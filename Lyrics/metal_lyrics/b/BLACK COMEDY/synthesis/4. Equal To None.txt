Donât you worry my life is unsaveble
Iâm just your average expendable motherfucker
Each day we pray to see another day but our God is laughingâ¦
Because whatever happens weâll believe we died in his name
And the rest of the whole can watch when true diplomacy makes its claim

Burst forth â like theyâd never see us coming
First fall â your words are never too insulting
Do we see the tragedy?
Just our nature to be cold
Does it hurt too much to care?
Ideal cause for a piece of land
Swallow truth
Something theyâll never be able to bear

Like the flags they wave when they send us away, would resemble some kind of comfort
Always in the hands of faith, why this love we have for this cycle of hate
Is this idealism? What are we moving blindly towards?
What have we to show? When all thatâs coming back is simply dead!

Feel the blood rush through your body, go in for the kill: itâs a feeling I canât explain
Never quite sure what weâre fighting for, we march straight back out all over again
Is this our destinyâs call, is this the solemn law
Make sure the rest of the whole world is duly fucking entertained

Burst forth â like theyâd never see us coming
First fall â your hate is never too insulting
Do we see the tragedy?
Just our nature to be cold
Does it hurt too much to care?
Ideal cause for a piece of land
Swallow truth
Something theyâll never be able to bear

What if we made a war so horrible?
That even God would have to step out of bubble
Well, whereâs your merciful God now?            

Do we see the tragedy?
Just our nature to be cold
Does it hurt too much to care?
Ideal cause for a piece of land
Swallow truth
Something theyâll never be able to bear
