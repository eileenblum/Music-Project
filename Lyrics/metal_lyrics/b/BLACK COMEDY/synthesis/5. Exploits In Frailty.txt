Now weâre strangers more than we ever were
Love executed with simple words
And I was the one who had to understand and accept
The final verdict you could explain yourself
Youâre thoughts can be summed up: Iâll do whatever suits me
Well at least someoneâs got it all off of their chest
Taking the easiest way out is what always you did best!

If itâs all the same for you and me
Iâm not the only one
Now that I am gone
It was all up to me?
So manipulative
Iâll never see you againâ¦
Fake from top to bottom
My eyes sorely blinded
Anticipating hate
Never see your face again

Evidently too much for you
Still ignorant to the damage youâve done
Do you truly know what it really feels like?
You donât even have your feet on the ground
Breaking up harder than you thought: well thatâs love for you!
Well at least someoneâs got it all off of their chest
Taking the easiest way out is what always you did best!

If itâs all the same for you and me
Iâm not the only one
Now that I am gone
It was all up to me?
So manipulative
Iâll never see you againâ¦
Fake from top to bottom
My eyes sorely blinded
Anticipating hate
Never see your face again

New shallowsâ¦ you never believed in a love where you had to give

I was a free-to-fall sucker blinded by love
Emotionally exploited beyond repair
And everybody could see what you did was wrong
The pain you prolonged!
These actions left me no choice but to hate
All the half-hearted shit you represent
Convenient silence, true neglect
Do you still think your judgement is unsuspect?

You still haunt me now in my dreams
Fucked me as long as I suit your needs
What she loved was herself
And I played your game
