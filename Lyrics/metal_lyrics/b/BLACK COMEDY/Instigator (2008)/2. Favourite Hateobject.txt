Left to make it all so easy
Cheating yourself of dignity
The former pillars of your life scorn
Laid the blame upon us excessively
Obsessed with external factors
Manipulation to control
From behind the mask you sought to undermine our task 
So you could get out whole

[Chorus:]
You cannot see it for yourself
Someone is trying to take it away
Another time, another place
To seek all your pain
Solution is hate

Chose to burn all the bridges 
To mark your anger and detest
But all the time you knew what you were
Backstabbing us at the best
Betraying everyone of us
But even worse you betrayed yourself
From now and for ever more
Youâve lost those who were once your real friends

[Chorus:]
You cannot see it for yourself
(Could never rid you illusions)
Someone is trying to take it away
Another time, another place
(Weâve come to the conclusion)
To seek all your pain
Solution is hate

[Bridge:]

Oh, 
Yeah

Make amends with all the shit in the wake of you?
Donât try â There is no gainâ¦ fucker!

Memories, we choose to sever line clear
You deal with your demise

[Chorus:]
You cannot see it for yourself
Someone is trying to take it away
Another time, another place
To seek all your pain
Solution is hate
