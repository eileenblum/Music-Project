We are all!

With your soul in my hand â a grip that compels, consumes the hearts
Drive on, lead on, or sink as you sell your right to live on
Pure market autonomy, the invisible hand distributes the shares just
Free the forces of greed and bring all those untouched to the light

[Chorus:]
No, uninhibited speculation â incentive to flow
No, state subordinate to the paramount of individualism
No, dollar signs in their eyes; canât you see how they glow?
No, penetration for acquisition â disintegrate capital account control!

Thatâs right! An ideology that seems all too right
Survival of the fittest â a rat-race put in to perfect system

Institutionalized cynicism â clear cut rationale, volatility ensures a victim
Assets, equity and property â the millions spent on bonds
Self-fulfilling prophecy, in market psychology we shall trust
So put your money where mouth is and make the bid
There is no medal for second place

[Chorus:]
No, uninhibited speculation â incentive to flow
No, state subordinate to the paramount of individualism
No, dollar signs in their eyes; canât you see how they glow?
No, penetration for acquisition â disintegrate capital account control!

Capitalism will free our souls
Necessity cleans the lice away
The anticipation of crude reward
Efficiency in its sickety form

Forward!
Forward!
Competition in its purity
Forward!
Forward!
Assert yourself accordingly

The bolt shall profit and seize

[Chorus:]
No, uninhibited speculation â incentive to flow
No, state subordinate to the paramount of individualism
No, dollar signs in their eyes; canât you see how they glow?
No, penetration for acquisition â disintegrate capital account control!

Debt for debt!
Debt for debt!
