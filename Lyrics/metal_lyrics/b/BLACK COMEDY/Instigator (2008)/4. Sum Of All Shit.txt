Well, it never ceases to amaze
Exalt the splendors of the music industry
Let entertainment value come to the fore
Sit down and get mind-fucked by the shit on MTV

And here we lie, in a state of perpetual calm
Eyes wide shut, as addicts we keep suckling on
Take in whole the full range of promiscuity
Force-fed notions of fervent superficiality

Control is the keyâ¦
Forever hail the youth of apathy

Minds cut short of dealing with complexities
Meaningless shows designed to induce complacency
So sell! So sell!

Oh, we let us play as fools
Our brains turned into dumping sites
Tell us how we must conform in order to feel a belonging white
I feel this burning desire to see this industry cleansed with fire
To be rebuilt with new ambitions and rid of its pitiful inclinations

Rectify? Cannot reverse the process now
So effectively our eyes have been blinded by snow
Wannabes, pimps, whores sell themselves incessantly
What ever happened to artistic integrity?

Standard recipe of successâ¦
Just add some bling-bling, glam and sex
So-called artists lined-up to be the next big superstar
Just need to label their antics as a new-found art form
Enjoy! Enjoy!

Oh, we let us play as fools
Our brains turned into dumping sites
Tell us how we must conform in order to feel a belonging white
I feel this burning desire to see this industry cleansed with fire
To be rebuilt with new ambitions and rid of its pitiful inclinations

Sell out?
Appeal to the most basic conceptions of our imagination
Sell out?
Fuck intellectual audacity if it doesn't make a buck

So, seamless and effortless the pipers lead on the fools
No need to contest the fact, the companies supply the tools
Yes, MTV shall be the proponent of our newborn reality
Add it up and try to make sense
The sum of all shit, shit, shit, shit!

Oh, we let us play as fools
Our brains turned into dumping sites
Tell us how we must conform in order to feel a belonging white
I feel this burning desire to see this industry cleansed with fire
To be rebuilt with new ambitions and rid of its pitiful inclinations

Sell out?
Appeal to the most basic conceptions of our imagination
Sell out?
Fuck intellectual audacityness as the new pretentiousness
Rid of its pitiful inclinations
