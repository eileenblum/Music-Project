Well letâs all celebrate because another war has just begun
A cause so holy that no one would ever dare leave it undone
This isnât just an acute gesture of national self-preservation:
Disprove all critics of our proud nation

To this unwarranted attack we resolutely respond
Prove to the whole world that no one can piss on our lawn
Hey! Who doesnât know that weâre vulnerable as everybody else?
And we know that security is what truly sells

No need to moralize, we know that everyone will be on our side
Weâll sacrifice a few good men, but theyâll weigh up for what we idealize
It becomes all the more easy when we paint the world in black and white
Assure us of those with or against us of our undeniable right

Itâs self-evident: the spirit of unity must subsist as our ideal
And dissupport our leadership with true patriotic zeals
Attention!
Aggression!
Concentration!
Ready-set-kill!

My name is Uncle Sam and I think I can solve your problem
Model on my homeland; home of the free; capital and religion
Never-mind the rest of the world weâll do as we fucking please
And those against us weâll eliminate with the greatest ease

Donât say â we are what is freedom
Donât say â if not against then with them
Donât say â truth is sold
Donât say â loss of liberty at the price of control?

Hear them! What splendour! Consolation for terror?
Fear them!? Is this the shell of our hollow pride?
My name is Uncle Sam and I think I can solve your problem
Model on my homeland; home of the free; capital and religion
Never-mind the rest of the world weâll do as we fucking please
And those against us weâll eliminate with the greatest ease

Donât say â democracy
Donât say â equality
Donât say â land of the free
Donât say â Man above the cause

Inhale the sulphur!
Inhale the sulphur!
Inhale the sulphur!
Inhale the sulphur!
