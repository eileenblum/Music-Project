Before you whip me into submission, torture me, exploit me
I think thereâs something you should know â I was born into the beating
Iâll let you decide the position, control my dispositions
Your pity I accept willfully â if say itâs so: itâs so wellâ¦

Some say itâs a game of mutual trust, but I donât care if you get too sordid
Donât you stop; weâve just started true ways of sodomy
The scarcity of really living â the sense of truly exceeding
Enter the role of the sodomite, hurt is just a temporary feeling

Last breath before the beating now
Suppress the questions why or how
Thereâs no rationale explanation
Mistress! Ready for my dedication!?

I know my place in the hierarchy
Lowest form must adhere perfectly
Oh, wonât you please teach me â
Oh, what it means to dominate!

Insane! Thereâs no room for pleading now
I sense the lust in your blows
I am S [-lave] and you are M [-aster]
Together weâre sadomasochism
Insane!

Hit me harder!
Submit to my tainted stick
Bow down youâre at the mercy of the whip
Never give-in to you
No need to explain, my solution is pain

To live you must learn to crawl, as a slave you canât have it all
Being a worthless piece of shit, doesnât make me feel small at all

Insane! Thereâs no room for pleading now
I sense the lust in your blows
I am S [-lave] and you are M [-aster]
Together weâre sadomasochism
Insane!

Hit me harder!
Submit to my tainted stick
Bow down youâre at the mercy of the whip
Never give-in to you
No need to explain, my solution is pain

The sweet sting to the cracking sounds
The brilliant touch of inhumanity
There is no shame, my solution is pain

Woh, free to fall and I like what I feel
Woh, you got that sex-appeal
Woh, and I know exactly what you wantâ¦

This is just a demonstration of my therapy
This is just a demonstration of depravity
This is just a demonstration of sincerity
This is just a demonstration of my intensity

Of how low I can goâ¦

Hit me harder!
Submit to my tainted stick
Bow down youâre at the mercy of the whip
Never give-in to you
There is no shame, my solution is pain

Thereâs no reason, way out treason, go down, lie
