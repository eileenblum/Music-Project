Machines produce the maximum
Increase spending to the unimaginable
To sustain weapons industry convince public of pre-emptive strategy
War tech lobbyist get there way, politicians arenât too hard to sway
Military industrial complex â first war to be won is on the stage budget

All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry

In heights or lows â weâll sell to friend or foe
Distinct affair â corrupt elites will get their share
And you shall know us by the trail of war
One superpower accumulating more and more
And if other countries dare choose to protest
Theyâll facing the might of our trade sanctions next

All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry

Recall the day you pledged to serve the cause
Ethics, schmethicsâ¦ this is the way of power politics
Politicians will always come and go
Make sure to reap the benefits

A war unjust, at least the threat is reduced to dust
No matter the cost, we showed the world not to mess with us
Reasons washed away, yet we still cash in on the pay
All this worth the price, diplomacy neutralized
Propagate that we must keep on fighting for freedom
Who says democracy is made by the tip of the gun?

All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry, all for the industry
All for the industry

Recall the day you pledged to serve the cause
Ethics, schmethicsâ¦ this is the way of power politics
Politicians will always come and go
Make sure to reap the benefits

War incognito, war incognito

Ideal war
Ideal stance
Wave the flag, oil tainted
Blood soaked soil in foreign lands
God bless the fortune of this landâ¦
