Letâs set aside for a moment
The idealogical connotations of the debate
And take a minute to reflect and acknowledge
Our true nature seems no different than amoebae
And I contemplate, ambivalently, over humanityâs behaviour
The strides and turns throughout our fraught history
And how we tend to out â complete the very things we depend upon

[Chorus:]
Swept away â even as our surroundings succumb we cannot find a way out
Procreate â a higher purpose is a figment of our imagination

Sex â the very things that all sentient life-forms share
The basic premise for speciesâ continuation
Funny how it makes us cast aside our attributes of rational thinking
Added irony, our basic urge to disseminate our genes
Turns out to be our most destructive weapon
The quintessential program which we are all equipped is a double edged sword

[Chorus:]
Swept away â even as our surroundings succumb we cannot find a way out
Procreate â a higher purpose is a figment of our imagination [x2]

Our evolution is interdependency by design
Or is it disparity with impunity?

Swept awayâ¦

[Chorus:]
Swept away â even as our surroundings succumb we cannot find a way out
Procreate â a higher purpose is a figment of our imagination

And we assume nothing, nothing of this world
Still believe thereâs an intelligent force behind our existence?
