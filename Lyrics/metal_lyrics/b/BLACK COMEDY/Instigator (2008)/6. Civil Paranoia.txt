We are so paranoid, weâve become the victims of our own fear
Rationality is subordinate, when tuned in to the âevilsâ out there
Oh, do you react to what they send?
TV depicts society like a war zone â ready to engulf us!

Feeding us an unscrupulous set of lies
Information corresponds to socially accepted stereotypes
Generalizations, preconceptions, news that lacks depth
We consume others tragedies to feel better about ourselves
Omnipresent political correctness â objectivity dead
Simplified news-reports persuade the dimmest of heads

[Chorus:]
So when freedom is at stake â our docility makes sure that we donât care
Just as long as we get what we crave!
Truth beyond sensation â subscribe to the pretense?
The will to entertain exceeds what really countsâ¦

Swayed public opinion and directed sympathies
Ignorance flourishing due to critical inadequacy
TV the instrument that keeps us in check
Our attentions diverted by the government

Oh, weâre slaves to the fucking trends!
Curiously poised by the menace of criminals and bin Ladens
This paranoia is shifting society
Becoming a nation of hyper-patriotic vigilantes

What cuts me up â I swallow the hollow lies they feed me
Enclosed by invisible fiends, media nurtures the fears inside me
Bored?
At least it keeps me glued to the tube
In anticipation of the next ferocious crime â
Comfortably pacified within they walls of my home

Tap into the horrors of the outside world
Information suited for mass digestion
Everyone viewing the same channels
Leave out what demands personal reflection

[Chorus:]
So when freedom is at stake â our docility makes sure that we donât care
Just as long as we get what we crave!
Truth beyond sensation â subscribe to the pretense?
The will to entertain exceeds what really countsâ¦

Woh, woh.
