The grim reality has taken a twisted turn
In favor of those who stand unapologetic
Fanatics attack the structures of society â
Preserving their faith as champions of morality

Performing Godâs work on Earth

What if we let ourselves be held hostage
to the rhetoric of irreconcilable values?
Hypocrites profound, denouncing all in their way
Poisoning childrenâs minds to maintain their position
through moral retribution
reproducing lies

The irony is as real as it is tragic â
religious zealots mobilize to bring on the second coming
Their strain of fascist idealism
meticulously designed to advance their own salvation

Ignite a war!

And is the end result holier than the means?
A pathetic attempt to restore some human dignity?
Paradox of democracy,
allowing those whom seek to destroy it
to exert their claims as we stand by and tolerate it as faithâ¦
Sic transit gloria mundi [Thus passes the glory of the world]

[Chorus:]
Weâre all in the same boat that barely floats
Yet true believers drive to see us drown
Fighting evil with evil â we choose replicate
History has a sordid-way of repeating itself
(Some obedient soul, oh-yeah)
Why can we never see this for ourselves?

Hey-ah!

Delusions of grandeur, since when did God represent peace and love?
Throughout the ages minions legitimized enemies shall pay with blood
Conformed rationale â self-righteous response
Judge theyâd rather see the world burn, than the fully of what they believe

Waiting for their prayers to be heard and observed
Manipulating the highest quarters of political power
Arrogance, ignorance, in such lethal combination
Blind adherence to these words has come to signifyâ¦

How enmeshed we are in lies â Odium by default

[Chorus:]
Weâre all in the same boat that barely floats
Yet true believers drive to see us drown
Fighting evil with evil â we choose replicate
History has a sordid-way of repeating itself
(Some obedient soul, oh-yeah)

Until the end
Programmed to the hate
Awaiting godsend
As the worldâs wars join as one
