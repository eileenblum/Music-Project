As if Gods and devils play out their schemes on Earth
Story of the God, the beast and the fools between [x4]
Throughout time men respond to their call
Story of the God, the beast and the fools between [x4]

Forever! Never seems to be a way out for humanity
We live as we shall surely fall
Creator: no longer need for him â outlived his functionality
We should live as if we were the It and the All

Prayers for solace never helped a thing
Story of the God, the beast and the fools between [x4]

Forever! Never seems to be a way out for humanity
We live as we shall surely fall
Creator: no longer need for him â outlived his functionality
We should live as if we were the It and the All

Playing our sensibilities â God never prevented tragedy
He lives in the fear of us all
Weâre made in the eyes of God they say â
loved and watched by the perfect deity
Weâre the living testament to his fallibility, his fallibility

Plain to see â God ran off from his responsibility
Plain to see â He let the demons run rampantly
Plain to see â We repeat our faults throughout history
Plain to see â Itâs time we took our place as successors to be

The pains of the world constructed to make us seek his mercy
Story of the God, the beast and the fools between [x4]
The plan is to bend every being into conformity
Story of the God, the beast and the fools between [x4]

Forever! Never seems to be a way out for humanity
We live as we shall surely fall
Creator: no longer need for him â outlived his functionality
We should live as if we were the It and the All

Playing our sensibilities â God never prevented tragedy
He lives in the fear of us all
Weâre made in the eyes of God they say â
loved and watched by the perfect deity
Weâre the living testament to his fallibility

The stars, they call for us
The Universe outside implores us

Fools between
Fools between

Time to depart this wretched Earth
Time to leaveâ¦
