I am the black knight of Satan
Through the unholy battles I ride
My sword is all red becaus I have killed you

My horse is a vampire and so am I
We share our dark desires, blood and goat semen
Every night we hunt in the dark Satanic Oulugia
We suck you dry from semen and blood
We are bloody insane

Oh the wolf of the night
I run with thee through the old forest
Eternal path in the forest of Oulugia
Leads to the Blackthrone

The moon is full in me
I become a werewolf always
The forest is covered with snow
So cold that it is sorrowful in the night

I have the magic of the fullmoon in me
I will howl in the mystical woods and the mountains of Oulugia
And I always have my panzerfaust with me because you never
know when the russian tanks attacks us in the night
