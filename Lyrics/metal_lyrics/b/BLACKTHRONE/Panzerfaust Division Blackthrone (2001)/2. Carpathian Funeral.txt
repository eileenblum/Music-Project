Carpathian funeral blasting the might of Satan
In this black sacrificial rite the clouds are black

Blood is raining from the sky
We enjoy it very much because we are vampires
And we don't need to hunt for our food
But we do because it has become a habit

A habitus nekromaur!
Our fangs are long and sharp to bite

The black eagle of Satan
and the owls in the forest
Hohoo's around
It is spooky and we are afraid
of Vlad Dracul!
