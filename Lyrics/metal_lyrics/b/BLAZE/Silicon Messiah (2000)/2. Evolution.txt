Eyes never tire, they never blink,
They never fade and they always see
And without fear, and without greed,
Emotionless they view us logically

The age of machines destined to rule all
World of machines behind the fire wall

The evolution

No need for doubt, no need for tears,
No need for wealth, no need for sympathy
They only wait bide their time,
Calculate it all so patiently

The age of machines destined to rule all
World of machines behind the fire wall

The evolution

It will come like the shadow of a cloud on a summer's day
Like the shadow in a picture, never goes away
Like a picture on a screen that you know is a lie
There's an enemy within that you can visualise

The age of machines destined to rule all
World of machines behind the fire wall

The evolution
