As I live, so I die
Here in endless night
Time to be, time to see
Infinity consuming me

There's a world of madness, light years away
That I once called my home
A sea of sadness, to sail away
Now I stare at the sun

Staring at a million million stars through the icy dark
Across the spinal arm
The yellow dwarf, a speck of light in perpetual night
Lifetimes away, there lies my home

Just can't seem to tear away my eyes
Is this real or am I still alive?

Stare at the sun
The end of the world has come
Stare at the sun, the sun
The ending has just begun

I knew I'd feel a little pain not so deep or so ingrained
Now I won't see home again
Earth seems to be so far away, this my cradle and my grave
Is this where my life will end?

Just can't seem to tear away my eyes
Is this real or am I still alive?

Stare at the sun
The end of the world has come
Stare at the sun, the sun
The ending has just begun

Just can't seem to tear away my eyes
Is this real or am I still alive?
Is this now the time that I will die?

Stare at the sun
The end of the world has come
Stare at the sun, the sun
The ending has just begun
Stare at the sun, the sun
The end of the world has come

As I live, so I die
Here in endless night
