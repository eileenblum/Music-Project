[Bonus Track]

I thought I stood on solid ground
I was floating near the stars
Never once did I look down
I was Falling Down how far...

To a place where I can't even say my name
I am the alien, the drifter, I'm to blame

The day I fell to earth

I fell to earth, thought I was dead
I was bruised and I was scarred
Took the time to look around
Started climbing and how far

To a place where I am shouting out my name
I am the alien, the drifter, I'm to blame

The Day I fel to earth

The Day I fel to earth
