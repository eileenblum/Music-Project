All of his life he has dreamt of this moment
Through all the blood and the work and the sweat
Focused or blinkered just so single-minded
Nothing could stop him when his course was set

To conquer each fear and to push every boundary
Never accepting the limits they set
What doesn't kill you can make you feel stronger
What makes you stronger gets you through each test

Oh, God speed to you

He looks to heaven and feels it surround him
Unknown unknowable foreverness
What lies at the end of this historic journey
No one can know you just take your best guess

Each thing he faces just seems so uncertain
He is strapped in for the ride of his life
Life in the hands of a hundred computers
12 million horsepower rocket to ride

Oh, God speed to you

To conquer each fear and to push every boundary
Never accepting the limits they set
What doesn't kill you can make you feel stronger
What makes you stronger gets you through each test

Oh, God speed to you
