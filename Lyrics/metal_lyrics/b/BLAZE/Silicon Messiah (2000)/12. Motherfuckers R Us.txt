[Bonus Track]

Wake up on my own and i wonder where i am
My mind begins to clear and i begin to understand
Today i am in phoenix so im feeling preety low
Would you like to skip the afternoon and get right to the show

Cause i live to rock
Rock alright
Just don`t care
What`s wrong or right
Living Loud
Living Free
You and me
The Mad Motherfuckers

I`ve been rolling i`ve been moving all night long
I`ve been to so many places i don`t know where i belong
I`d like to say this one thing and its in my only fans
Right here, right now it`s the only place that i can make some sense

Cause i live to rock
Rock alright
Just don`t care
What`s wrong or right
Living Loud
Living Free
You and me
The Mad Motherfuckers

It looks like Motherfuckers R Us tonight

Right over here
We`ve got the Crazy MotherFuckers
RIght over there
We`ve got the wild motherfuckers
Right over here
We`ve got the insane motherfuckers!!!!

Yeah!!!

And we live to rock
Rock alright
Just don`t care
What`s wrong or right
Living Loud
Living Free
You and me
The Mad Motherfuckers
