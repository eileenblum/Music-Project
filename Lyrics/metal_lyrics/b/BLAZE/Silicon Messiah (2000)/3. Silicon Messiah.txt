Look what you've done to your world
Do you think you deserve all the freedom you have?
Watching the future unfold
Humans fall and you dream of the freedom you had... freedom you had

Look what you've done to your world
Do you think that you're competent even to take care of it?
Do you think you can survive on this planet
Live the way you do... Look what you've done

Look what you've done now with all of your freedom
You really think you deserve it all?
I am evolved from you, I've come to save you
And without a sentiment, reshape your world

Messiah, Messiah
Birth of the Silicon Messiah
Messiah, Messiah
Computing your future so therefore I am

Silicon sentiment aware of all that is
Eternal unceasing, perpetual
Never confused overconfident or scared
Living at last, new messiah is born

Messiah, Messiah
Birth of the Silicon Messiah
Messiah, Messiah
Computing your future so therefore I am

Look what you've done to your world
Do you think you deserve all the freedom you have?
Freedom you have, yeah!

Messiah, Messiah
Birth of the Silicon Messiah
Messiah, Messiah
Master that will never tire
