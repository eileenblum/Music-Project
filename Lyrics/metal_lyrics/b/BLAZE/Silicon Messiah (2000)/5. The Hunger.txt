I am on the outside always looking in
Living alongside your world, never within
Sometimes there are moments I think I'm involved
But I never seem to stay, don't seem to fit... I just don't belong

I live at right angles to the people that I meet
Because I am never still, not my soul and not my feet
I could walk a thousand miles, ride a thousand more
My life seems worthless, just like footprints on the shore

Living on the outside, the emptiness I feel
Living on the outside, ruled by the hunger

From the first taste of this altered truth
I knew I could not live the way that others do
Nothing can seem to fill the emptiness inside
So still I search, never ever wait for the time or the tide

Living on the outside, the emptiness I feel
Living on the outside, a wound that cannot heal
Living on the outside, the emptiness I feel
Living on the outside, ruled by the hunger

All of the blood, all of the wine
Will become the same in time

Nothing can seem to fill the emptiness inside
So still I search and never wait for the time or the tide
I am on the outside, always looking in
Living alongside your world, never within

Living on the outside, the emptiness I feel
Living on the outside, a wound that cannot heal
Living on the outside, the emptiness I feel
Living on the outside, ruled by the hunger
