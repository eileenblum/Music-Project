[Bonus Track]

Beneath your calm,
Behind your smile,
You hide away your lies,
Intimidating, Manipulating,
The truth is in your eyes.

My days and nights get longer,
Winding on and on.
Love lost hours make us hard.
You are power mad
I think that's sad
Real powers in our hearts.

We live our way
Not how you say.
Our blood, our sweat
We have no regrets

Tough as steel,
Never show the pain we feel
Because we were tough as steel.

Every hour we are stronger
Inside us grows the rage
We cannot remain immune
To win you must kill
You'll never break our will
Our aim for glory is true

We live our way
Not how you say
Our blood, our sweat
We have no regrets.

Tough as steel,
Never show the pain we feel
Because we were tough as steel

Days and nights get longer
Winding on and on
Love lost hours make us hard
You are power mad
I think that's sad
Real powers in our hearts

We live our way
Not how you say
Our blood, our sweat
We have no regrets

Tough as steel,
Never show the pain we feel
Because we were tough as steel.

Tough as steel
Tough as steel
Tough, Tough,Tough,Tough,Tough,Tough,Tough

Tough as steel!!!
