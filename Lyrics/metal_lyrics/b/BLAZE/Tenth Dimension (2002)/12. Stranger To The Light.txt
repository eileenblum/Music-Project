As I walk in shadows I feel the darkness grow 
Fading to the distance the world I used to know 
From this single moment belief in all this grows 
Towards the final secret a new dimension I must know 
(As I walk in shadows I feel the darkness grow) 
This time with God deep inside I will brush away the sand 
And I'll see his one true face, will I recognise it? 
Already I have answers but will I realise? 
Are all these days of darkness leading to my grave? 
Oh-oh-oh a stranger to the light 
Oh-oh-oh a stranger to the light 
Facing the stranger 
Nature's true reality I will find and you will see 
Yesterday's future can change faith is all I need 
Faith in darkness and in light 
Path of dreams has saved my sight 
They have tried to hide this hide it with their lives 
Oh-oh-oh a stranger to the light 
Oh-oh-oh a stranger to the light 
Facing the stranger 
Your freedom is here, freedom is here 
In the tenth dimension
