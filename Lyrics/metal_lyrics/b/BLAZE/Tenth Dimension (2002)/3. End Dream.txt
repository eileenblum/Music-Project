Just like a child in the dark 
Frightened and too scared to move 
Annihilation of nations begins 
The galaxy tears apart in my dreams 
If I knew then, what I know now 
Would I have opened those doors? 
Dreams now they begin, time slows and then it ends 
Dreams now they begin, time froze the dream of the end 
The dream repeats and won't fade 
The future is stolen away 
What I have done now the darkness reveals 
The master's face is no longer concealed 
If I knew then, what I know now 
Would I have opened those doors? 
Dreams now they begin, time slows and then it ends 
Dreams now they begin, time froze the dream of the end 
Is this the dream world, is this the real world? 
Are they the same place that we must all face? 
Is this a nightmare that we must all share? 
Is this my demon, I cannot reason? 
Why do I hate me? Will Jesus save me? 
Machine created, man decimated 
(They stole the future) 
If I knew then, what I know now 
Would I have opened those doors? 
Dreams now they begin, time slows and then it ends 
Dreams now they begin, time froze the dream of the end 
Just like a child in the dark
