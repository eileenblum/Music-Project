All the force of nature, chaos and the death of hope 
Don't resist them and accept the death of all you know 
You walk alone and face the darkness you will be reborn 
Rediscover your existence in it's purest form 
Searching for the reasons why, will you know when it's your time? 
Time flashes before your eyes 
Watch everything change at the speed of light 
The speed of light 
As the future casts a shadow into here and now 
Time tells a secret whisper it without a sound 
You trust yourself your instincts or the answers of mankind 
Will you ever have the strength to leave this world and find 
Searching for the reasons why will you know when it's your time? 
Time flashes before your eyes 
Watch everything change at the speed of light 
Time flashes before your eyes 
Watch everything change at the speed of light 
The speed of light 
All the force of nature, chaos and the death of hope 
Don't resist them and accept the death of all you know 
You walk alone and face the darkness you will be reborn 
Rediscover your existence in it's purest form 
Searching for the reasons why, will you know when it's your time? 
Time flashes before your eyes 
Watch everything change at the speed of light 
Time flashes before your eyes 
Watch everything change at the speed of light 
The speed of light
