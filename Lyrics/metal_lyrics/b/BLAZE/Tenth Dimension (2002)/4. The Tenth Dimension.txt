Those self appointed secret rulers of this world, 
They are hypocrites liars and thieves. 
And with the arrogance that they confuse with wisdom 
They are controlling everything and you and me. 
They rule with fear and hide the path to freedom, 
Manipulating with their conspiracys. 
Inventing gods to make us fear the day of judgement 
So dreading death we beg for life while on our knees. 
(Here I am) Standing in the darkness 
(Here I am) Surrounded by the night 
(Here I am) Standing in the darkness 
(Must I be) A stranger to the light 
For all my questions they said they had the answers 
But then they said this is all my life could be 
I ask again about the reasons for existence 
But still the answers cannot satisfy my need 
(Here I am) Standing in the darkness 
(Here I am) Surrounded by the night 
(Here I am) Standing in the darkness 
(Must I be) A stranger to the light 
Oh-oh-oh, freedom is here in the Tenth Dimension 
Oh-oh-oh, freedom is here in the Tenth Dimension 
Their holy trinity 
Traps you in their beliefs 
Has sinchronicty 
Always been leading me? 
Their holy trinity 
Traps you in their beliefs 
Has sinchronicty 
Always been leading me? 
(Did you think we would allow you to share the discovery?) 
(Here I am) Standing in the darkness 
(Here I am) Surrounded by the night 
(Here I am) Standing in the darkness 
(Must I be) A stranger to the light 
(Here I am) Standing in the darkness 
(Here I am) Surrounded by the night 
(Here I am) Standing in the darkness 
(Must I be) A stranger to the light 
Oh-oh-oh, your freedom is here in the Tenth Dimension 
Oh-oh-oh, your freedom is here in the Tenth Dimension
