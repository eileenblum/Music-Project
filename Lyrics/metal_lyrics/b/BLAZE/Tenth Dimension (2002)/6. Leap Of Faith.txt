Sometimes in life you just have to take chances 
To get where you think you should be 
And don't be afraid to lose sight of the shore 
And reach out just because you believe 
Take your first step into the unknown 
It's your first chance to face the unknown 
Take a leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
Take a leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
You can have what you want if you find answers 
Answers are all that they need 
Prove to yourself that you are so much stronger 
Than you thought you'd ever be 
You will have the whole world at your feet 
At last it all will be within your reach 
Take a leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
Take a leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
Finding the courage of your own convictions 
It's now time that you spread your wings 
Soar like an eagle a life without fear 
God will forgive you your sins 
Take your first step into the unknown 
It is your first chance to face the unknown 
Take a leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
Take a leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
Take a leap of faith 
A leap of faith 
Take a leap of faith
