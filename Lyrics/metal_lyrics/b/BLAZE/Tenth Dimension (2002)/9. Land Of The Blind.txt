Tried so hard just to live and forget and forgive 
And to live by their rules 
And to try to fit in I would do anything 
Like a poor blinded fool 
"You must do what they say and not question the way 
"That was chosen for you" 
I thought that was the way that life had to be 
Until I found out the truth 
Now I open my eyes 
It's just like I was blind 
In the land of the blind 
In the land of the blind 
In the land of the blind 
Now they think I don't see, poor derision on me 
With their hypocrisy 
Cynical egotist, government hypnotist 
Too small minded to see 
And the truth is so bright like a blinding light 
My true path I could find 
Theories incomplete sceptics I must defeat 
For my own peace of mind 
Now I open my eyes 
It's just like I was blind 
In the land of the blind 
In the land of the blind 
In the land of the blind 
(I was blind to the truth) 
You think you got freedom now 
That's how they hold you down 
You think you got freedom now 
That's how they hold you down, down 
You think you got freedom now 
That's how they hold you down 
You think you got freedom now 
That's how they hold you 
Tried so hard just to live and forget and forgive 
And to live by their rules 
"You must do what they say not question the way 
"That was chosen for you" 
I thought that was the way that life had to be 
Until I found out the truth 
Now I open my eyes 
It's just like I was blind 
In the land of the blind 
In the land of the blind 
In the land of the blind 
(I was blind to the truth) 
In the land of the blind 
In the land of the blind 
In the land of the blind 
(I was blind to the truth)
