Visions of darkness in my dream fortell the future memories 
Why does the darkness draw me so near? 
Why has the light deserted me 
Is this the path that I should seek? 
Why does the darkness draw me so near? 
(There's more to this world) 
More to this world than they can see 
Dream of in their philosophy 
They always try but they just cannot explain 
They say I'm mad 'cause I believe 
Believe there's so much more to see 
That things don't end here that there is something beyond 
But I seek the truth 
So I am ignored I am a freak 
Mine is the name no one will speak 
Cause they are so in love with their own ideas 
Am I unbalanced dangerously? 
Losing my grip on sanity 
Have I seen visions of that place that is beyond? 
Now I seek the truth 
There's nothing to loose 
And nothing will stop me 
And nothing will stop me 
As I search for the truth 
Nothing will stop me 
They won't stand in my way 
I know that I must be strong 
I know that I must be strong 
Now I seek the truth 
There's nothing to loose 
It's the path that I choose 
And nothing will stop me 
And nothing will stop me 
As I search for the truth 
Nothing will stop me 
They won't stand in my way 
I know that I must be 
I know that I must be strong 
I know that I must be strong 
They cannot stop me 
You will not stop me 
Just try to stop me 
Nothing will stop me
