I feel the force of nature now, I feel it 
It holds the Earth third from the Sun 
The energy that binds us all, the power 
The energy in everyone 
Supremacy and tyranny authority and violence 
They desecrate and take control 
They just kill and destroy 
They use the hate within you 
To rape your mind and take control 
Kill and destroy 
Break out of their illusion 
They made you blind and took your soul 
I see a vision of the truth, I see it 
It is so deep and oh so pure 
A new world order takes control, dictating 
They live for murder and for war 
Subjugate and violate you're suffering in silence 
They demonise you gain control 
They just kill and destroy 
They use the hate within you 
To rape your mind and take control 
Kill and destroy 
Break out of their illusion 
They made you blind and took your soul 
A shadow with an unseen hand, they're ruling 
Just like a self appointed god 
To them we're dust and we're sand, we're nothing 
There is no way this can go on 
Subjugate and violate you're suffering in silence 
They desecrate take control 
They just kill and destroy 
They use the hate within you 
To rape your mind and take control 
Kill and destroy 
Break out of their illusion 
They made you blind and took your soul 
(Kill) Kill and destroy 
(Kill) Kill and destroy 
(Kill) Kill and destroy 
(Kill) Kill and destroy 
Break out of their illusion 
They made you blind and took your soul
