All the things that I never said spinning round in my aching head 
All the things that I meant to do, was it meant to be? 
Was a time that I almost died, felt just like a thousand times 
I wondered if it was my time, was it meant to be? 
As I live within walls and follow their rules 
I've taken a path that I just did not choose 
I do everything that they expect me to 
Have I now even turned my own back on the truth? 
All my life I have followed dreams, never cared where they've taken me 
Chasing shadows because I believed it was meant to be 
There's something that I have now seen makes me question my beliefs 
Does the end justify the means, is it meant to be? 
I must now make a stand and break out of these walls 
I'll make my own rules, I'll chart my own course 
They expect me to fall, they expect me to die 
But I've stood here before and I'm sick of their lies 
Is it meant to be? Is it meant to be? 
Is it meant to be? 
Now I stand as a man and I don't see their walls 
I make my own rules, I chart my own course 
No use them expecting me to fall that's not me 
I won't let them win, it's just not meant to be 
It's just not meant to be 
It's just not meant to be 
It's just not meant to be 
It's just not meant to be
