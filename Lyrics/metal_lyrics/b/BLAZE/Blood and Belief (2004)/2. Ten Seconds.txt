You love the rush, the rush of the win
Risk of defeat, risk everything
Feel you can cheat death one more time
There's nothing else till you cross the line

Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line, cause you've got to see

[Chorus:]

Ten, ten seconds
Ten seconds at at time you feel alive for
Ten, ten seconds
Living your life in a quarter mile

Time to focus, you picture the win
The engine roars,  feel the rush within
You must pursue this victory
There is nothing else you have to be

Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line, cause you've got to see

[Repeat chorus]

Faster than the rest you live to be
You're at the line, cause you've got to see

[Repeat chorus x2]

In ten, ten seconds

Ten, ten seconds

Ten!
