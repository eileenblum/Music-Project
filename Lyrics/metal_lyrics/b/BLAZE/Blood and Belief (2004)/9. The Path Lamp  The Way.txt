I'll find the path and the way on my own, I have before
Don't need them telling me who died for me
And what it was for

This may be a revelation for them
They don't understand my life or yours
Not conforming to all of their ideals
Makes me all wrong and them right of course.

So no, I don't believe in their religion
I don't believe their sacrifice
I don't belief their hell or heaven
I don't believe that they are right about my life...

People dying because of ideas
Ideas describing their god differently
It is their gods' world
So they rearrange it
arrange it to fit
distorted prophecies

[Repeat verse 2]

Oh no, I don't believe in their religion
I don't believe their sacrifice
I don't belief their hell or heaven
I don't believe that they are right about my life...

I'll find the path and the way on my own
I always have before
I'll find the path and the way on my own
I will open my own doors.

[Repeat verse 2]

Oh no, I don't believe in their religion
I don't believe their sacrifice
I don't belief their hell or heaven
I don't believe that they are right...

I don't believe... [repeat x 8]
