If that phone call is for me please tell them that I don't exist
I don't think I'll be missed
That call could signal danger that I might still be alive
I thought that I had died
Do you think the doctor lied?

The doctor said it's not my fault
I've been told I'm not to blame
There is just an empty space
Where there should be a brain
I'm an interesting case
Just like one that he once saw
About a man who doesn't know
He is really just a thought

The doctor said I've got a hollow head... hollow head!

The doctor said I should go home
And try to find my own safe place
That's not something I can face
Where all my feelings are my own
And everything is just ok
That's not for me
I'm really ill you see

The world is spinning round too fast
The sky is pushing down to hard
Everybody feeling scared
That they won't get the part
The extraordinary thing
Is that we are all the same
When we think we're all alone
We all feel so ashamed

The doctor said I've got a hollow head... hollow head!

The doctor said it's not my fault
I've been told I'm not to blame
There is just an empty space
Where there should be a brain
I'm an interesting case
Just like one that he once saw
About a man who doesn't know
He is really just a thought

The doctor said I've got a hollow head... hollow head!
