You tell yourself a lie and you will live a lie
You told me you could fly, I've never seen you fly

Tearing yourself to pieces
Tearing yourself apart
What are you trying to prove?
Who are you trying to prove it to?
Hiding your self destruction
Hiding yourself away
Showing everyone around you
Such a different face

You've got gear and loathing
You've got all the self abuse
And you think you caught it
From someone you almost knew

You have lost all your chances
You have lsot all your days
You can always find
Someone you'd rather blame
Decided that you would fall down
You know that it's all your fault
But still you try to make someone responsible

You don't need the things you want
You're always so confused
You don't want the things you need
Just what's wrong with you?

Tell yourself a lie, you will live a lie
Told me you could fly, I've never seen you fly
Told me you could die, I've never seen you die
Tell yourself a lie, you will live a lie
You lie... you lie...

You lie... you lie...

Tearing yourself to pieces
Tearing yourself apart
What are you trying to prove?
Who are you trying to prove it to?
Hiding your self destruction
Hiding yourself away
Showing everyone around you
Such a different face

You've got gear and loathing
You've got all the self abuse
And you think you caught it
From someone you almost knew

Tell yourself a lie, you will live a lie
Told me you could fly, I've never seen you fly
Told me you could die, I've never seen you die
Tell yourself a lie and you will live a lie
You lie... you lie...

You lie... you lie...

You lie...
