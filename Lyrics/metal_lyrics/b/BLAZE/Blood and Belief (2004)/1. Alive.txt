I, I missed the meeting
Where you were appointed god
Preaching all your misguided views
Only you decide what is true

[Chorus:]

You just want me to die
Then you'll be satisfied
It's a disappointing day for you
Because I am alive... alive...

Me, I'm only human
So you think you can step on me
Feeding on all of those around
From your nothing throne
You're ruling nothing now

[Repeat chorus]

If you knew anything about real life
Then you would realise
You don't know anything about real life
To me that's no surprise

[Repeat verse 1]

You just want me to die
Then you'll be satisfied
It's a disappointing day for you
You know I'm still alive... alive...

You know I'm still alive... alive...
