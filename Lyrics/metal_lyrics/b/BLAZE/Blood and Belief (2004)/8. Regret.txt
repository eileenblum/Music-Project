I still walk and I still breathe,
I'm not the man that I could be.
There was a hole here in my chest,
Now it's filled up with these regrets.

Is the ending written down
Before we even read the play?
And is the ending hidden there
Until we turn the final page?

If I'd learned my lesson sooner,
If I'd sorted out my head
Then I would still be with you,
And I would not have one regret...
I would not have one regret...

[Chorus:]
I still walk, I still breathe,
I'm not the man I could be.
The hole here, in my chest,
Is filled with all of these regrets....

[Repeat chorus]

What kind of sad yesterdays
Will all of our tomorrows bring?
Will they be the yesterdays
We won't regret remembering?

If I'd learned my lesson sooner,
If I'd sorted out my head
Then I would still be with you,
And I would not have one regret...
I would not have one regret...

[Repeat chorus x 2]

[Solo]

[Repeat chorus x 2]
