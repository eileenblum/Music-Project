Forget about what you think you know about your life
What would you have if you could have what you want
People don't even know they're truly alive
They're just sleep walking
Things unimportant to you, just let them slide
Then wake up fighting

All of them fear what they do not know
All of that fear they pour unto you

You have the will to win
The courage to fight
To get through anything

The will to win

Believe you can beat them down and rise above
Those bastards will hate you for what you want to be
They are the noose and the millstone you must survie
They're self defeating
They try and make you an outcast, a freak and a fool
So fuck them!

All of them fear what they do not know
All of that fear they pour unto you

You have the will to win
The courage to fight
To get through anything

You have the will to win
The courage to fight
The will to win

You can fold this word into a shape
A thing that will fit in your mind
Your own reality reflecting your dream
Reflecting the world that's inside

You can fold this word into a shape
A thing that will fit in your mind

Forget about what you think you know about your life
What would you have if you could have what you want
People don't even know they're truly alive
They're just sleep walking
Things unimportant to you, just let them slide
Wake up fighting

All of them fear what they do not know
All of that fear they pour unto you

You have the will to win
The courage to fight
To get through anything

You have the will to win
The courage to fight
The will to win

You have the will to win
The courage to fight
The will to win

The will to win
