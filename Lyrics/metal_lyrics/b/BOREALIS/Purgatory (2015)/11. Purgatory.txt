The face of fear
is all you see
There are no new days coming
Forever in this place you'll be
Stuck with fear and running

A special place
for broken souls
Who chose to take themselves,
both young and old,
invited here

What I thought what I wanted,
the sacrifice I've made
This is the face of evil
I'm lost and fallen

We welcome you with open arms
Forever I'm lost in the dark
The screams you hear
are just like you
Awaiting death so stark

A special place
for broken souls
Who chose to take themselves,
both young and old,
invited here

What I thought what I wanted,
the sacrifice I've made
This is the face of evil
I'm lost and fallen
