I need for you
to hear these words
Another angel
has fallen from grace

The love I never felt,
the scars I bared
All those words you said to me
Did they satisfy your anger,
and heal your misery

Where were you,
when I took my final steps
When I sacrificed it all,
you turned away from me
And I have no forgiveness,
Nothing left

When your world
Begins to fall
Bittersweet sense
of loneliness
