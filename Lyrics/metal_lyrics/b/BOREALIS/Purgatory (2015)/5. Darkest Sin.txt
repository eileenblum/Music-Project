I close the door of sanity
There's only one more place to go
I reached for your love
I can't reach anymore
It's time to set me free
I await the light ahead
My pain is gone don't worry dad
Your wish is my command

I believe you will understand
Your insanity pushed me to the edge
I rise above to a better place
My darkest sin, has taken me away

Your world is not for me
I see darkness in your eyes
I need to leave you so you'll realize
I create a fantasy
To escape your tortured mind
She's my only saviour
Who I will find

I believe you will understand
Your insanity pushed me to the edge
I rise above to a better place
My darkest sin, has taken me away
