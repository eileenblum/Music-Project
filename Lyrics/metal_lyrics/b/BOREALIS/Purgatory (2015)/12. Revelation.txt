You're the picture
that I hoped for,
you're the missing part I need
Cure my only weakness,
the lies that I believed
The time has come
to start our lives
Needing you was my life

Take my hand,
hold it forever,
guide my soul to freedom
Give me hope change my life
I found my way home

The fear is gone,
my pain will fade away
Promise me it's my home

Let me know
That you're out there
and that you know I'm here
Be my angel, my soul awakener
Show me that I'm still alive

Take my hand,
hold it forever,
guide my soul to freedom
Give me hope change my life
I found my way home
