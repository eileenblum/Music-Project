There are no answers,
for questions asked
No prayers
Only illusions,
killing me inside
High above the emptiness I can't break
We were told
that we would find you there
Forgive me
when I don't believe your fairytales
Closing the door of fire

My creation is my destiny,
ashes turn to dust
Building a memory without you
I erase my mind of mystery,
silence was the curse
Living an endless dream,
no answers

Can't you see we're lost together
Miss your words,
the burning pain you caused me
They stare at me
Like white lights in the dark
Life, soul, body, and blood

My creation is my destiny,
ashes turn to dust
Building a memory without you
I erase my mind of mystery,
silence was the curse
Living an endless dream,
no answers
