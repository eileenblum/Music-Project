I look back,
just to see you smile
Remember the time
you were here

Our moments gone,
my life will fade away
I can't forgive
the things I've done

Rest my child, your sorrow is over
A new life has just begun

I'm running away, but I can't take
I can't take this anymore
And I want you to know
That I was wrong

Now I'm alone, forever I deserve
Promise me you'll return
Time is over now, just another day
I gave you nothing to the world

Rest my child, your sorrow is over
A new life has just begun

I'm running away, but I can't take
I can't take this anymore
And I want you to know
That I was wrong
