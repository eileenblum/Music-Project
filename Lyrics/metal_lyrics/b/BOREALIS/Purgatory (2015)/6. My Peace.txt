Why did you leave me,
how could she let you go
Left with a stranger,
lying in her room alone
I'm lost without you,
I need you by my side
Looking for answers,
watching the world collide

Mother may I have this wish
My last effort to make my peace
Take me to a better place
It's the life that I deserve

Drowning in anger,
drinking my pain away
Losing myself to this,
losing day by day
I see you there resting quietly,
her poem to the angels
Her moment to be free

Father may I have this wish
My last effort to make my peace
Take me from your hollow world
Your hell is not for me

Robbed of ambition,
I tried to live my life
No stars tonight,
just a broken destiny

DAD
"I no longer see a reason
to continue on this broken path
Being taken from day after day
has left me with nothing left to give
I do not hate you
I feel sorry for what you have become
And what you have turned me into
I hope for you this place I go to forgiving
And we can be as we once were
This world has lost it's light
I'm sorry"

Mother may I have this wish
My last effort to make my peace
Take me to a better place
It's the life that I deserve
