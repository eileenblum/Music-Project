Soft melody floats through the air
As the darkness grows closer
Open your eyes,
your emptiness haunts me inside

Stand without gravity,
I don't hear your goodbyes
Too immersed in this fire,
to tell the truth from a lie

Free my silence
Heal my soul
If I had just one more chance,
I'd know to make it right
Nothing but hindsight

Take what you need from me,
your fault is not my crime
I grasp at the empty depths
To the lace you once lived

Free my silence
Heal my soul
If I had just one more chance,
I'd know to make it right
Nothing but hindsight

Never saw past the veil
I never stood up to fight
I'm left broken
