Darkness comes alive
I lay here in my bed, eyes wide
Leave the past behind,
I don't have what it takes

Tired of evil lies,
drowning his thoughts,
drinking his demons away
I give him mercy from the light
The only prayer from me tonight

Give me a sign,
I believe you're waiting
In my dreams,
you're the only one
Close my eyes,
here's the life I created
In my dreams, I'm the chosen one

I left for school today,
went with my friends,
they don't know I'm leaving
I said my goodbyes to the world

Time has passed me by,
punish the weak,
carry the torch of despair
Surrender my innocence away,
my story will be told one day

Give me a sign,
I believe you're waiting
In my dreams,
you're the only one
Close my eyes,
here's the life I created
In my dreams, I'm the chosen one
