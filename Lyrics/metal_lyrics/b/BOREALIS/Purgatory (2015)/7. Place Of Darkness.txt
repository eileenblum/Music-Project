Awake in a nightmare,
too scared to see
I'm alone with no answers
I call your name,
waiting for a helping hand

I scream and I run from the shadows
Hear their voice,
feel the pain from their sorrows
I see hell, but where is my heaven
My darkest sin must be unforgiving

Oh, take me away from your lies
Holding on to a wish, to wake from it all

I hear their screams they're calling me
To this place of darkness
Their hopeless cries of agony
Take me away forever

Reach for an answer deep inside
I'll be watching over you my child

I'm lost without you, you were my hope
I can't be here forever
I feel your soul
watching down over me

See the fear
Cut the rope of impurity,
Cleanse my soul
or I'm bound for eternity
Wipe my tears,
I'm lost with my weakness
Why am I here,
I pray for forgiveness

Oh, take me away from your lies
Holding on to a wish, to wake from it all

I hear their screams they're calling me
To this place of darkness
Their hopeless cries of agony
Take me away forever

Reach for an answer deep inside
I'll be watching over you my child
