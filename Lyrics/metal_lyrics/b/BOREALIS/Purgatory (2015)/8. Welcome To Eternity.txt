I sit amongst the sick and dying
Fight the urge to see,
embrace the dark ahead
I can't escape the screams and crying,
this isn't what I wanted

My only goal to see your face,
feel your warmth again
To be wrapped in your embrace,
trapped without an end

Welcome to Eternity,
where I lose my faith
and lost reality

I'll fight for my revenge
The sun shall never greet my eyes

Looking up as I descend,
The heat burns
The light is growing dimmer now
No sounds, no light, nothing
You've made your final choice

You thought, you'd have it all
When you crossed into this world

Welcome to Eternity,
where I lose my faith
and lost reality

I'll fight for my revenge
The sun shall never greet my eyes
Again
