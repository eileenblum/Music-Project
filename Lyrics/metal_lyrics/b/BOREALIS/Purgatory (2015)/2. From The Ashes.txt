My eyes are closed
but I lie awake and alone
My heart is frozen
and my soul has abandoned me

I battle through these days,
through these days so grey,
but I see no light beyond
This world brought me to my knees,
and my will to be is gone

I would walk through the storm,
just to hear your voice again
This storm will never end
I would give my life to see your smile
From the ashes the curse begins to rise

Remember me for who I was,
and remember the life we had
The fault lies not in her;
I beg you see her worth

Wrote yourself a tragic end,
and a new life was born
Try and take the life I love,
nothing of you I can see in her eyes

I would walk through the storm,
just to hear your voice again
This storm will never end
I would give my life to see your smile
From the ashes the curse begins to rise

I feel the pain, never be the same
Nowhere to go and no one to blame
Can't take the pain, wish you would stay
Rise from the ashes

I would walk through the storm,
just to hear your voice again
This storm will never end
I would give my life to see your smile
From the ashes the curse begins to rise

I can't stay here on my own
Not with her
I will forever pray to trade her life
For yours
