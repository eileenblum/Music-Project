Silence fills the streets as the last of us arrive
Silent moment for those who have returned alive
Parade of ages marching toward the blackened gate
Passing on through would seal out fate

Overwhelming silence, screaming in our ears
Of all weâve seen was the worst of our fears

Walk through the door, fall through the floor
Youâll find this world is now yours
With no way out, there is no doubt
This world of silence is yours

A holy shrine,
A test of time to break these walls
Who am I?
Yet I would sacrifice
Do whatever would suffice
No medals for us when weâre done
We are the forgotten ones
Silence will forever follow
No bright light a dead tomorrow
