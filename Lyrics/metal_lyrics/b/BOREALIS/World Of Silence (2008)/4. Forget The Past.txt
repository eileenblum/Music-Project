Through all the pain
Through all the tears
Can you explain
Why youâre still here

Forget the past
Itâs time to stand up at last

Fly away so we can say
Lifeâs better this way
Times have changed, weâre not the same
Lifeâs better this way

Forget the times
We were as one
Your lies and rhymes
Their time has come
