Who is that maiden dressed in black
Her head down and walking slow
Her black hair flies straight back
The rain is hard and cold

He wants to meet her eyes just once
She glances up then down
Heâll not forget those eyes
Theyâll haunt him now heâs bound

Ah

Oh, what is your name, why do you wander so resilient
I wish to see those eyes, crazy brilliant
Oh, where are you now, you left a memory magnificent
Longing for those eyes, crazy brilliant

Her footsteps fade on cobblestone
She continues on her path
Her long black cape swirls at her feet
He wishes sheâd turn back

He knows not what became of her
She vanished in the night
His dreams are filled with thoughts of her
But sheâs always out of sight
