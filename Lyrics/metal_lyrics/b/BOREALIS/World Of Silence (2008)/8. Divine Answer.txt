Black becomes this restless mind
The world passes me by
A mind is filled with hopes and dreams
Itâs only a matter of time

Tell me
What I am to see
When I gaze into the sky
There is life and death
Will fate hold my breath
Will I wake to breathe just once more

Is life a game forfeited to fate
Do we control our path
Divine is the answer, to me itâs unclear
Clarity rests in the clouds

Free me
From what I canât see
Show me we truly can fly
There is life and death
Donât let fate hold my breath
I will wake beside you once more
