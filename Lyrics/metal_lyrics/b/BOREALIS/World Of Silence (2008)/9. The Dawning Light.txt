Hope is drowning slowly
In this lake of tears
Wonât somebody save me
Surrounded by my fears

Fall into this misery
I will be your company

Leave the door
The dawning light
Breaks through the night
Dark no more
The walls in me
Iâve broken free

Ever fading lifetimes
Rise and disappear
Trapped inside this time line
Answerâs never clear
