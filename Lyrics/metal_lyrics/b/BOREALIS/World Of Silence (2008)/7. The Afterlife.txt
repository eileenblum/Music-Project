Condense this life into ash
It becomes in time
Will we ever find the path
Or keep on walking blind

The meaning hides deep in rhyme
We search on in vain
Time has come
I see the light I will forever

To the afterlife we fall
Take my hand and heed the call
Find the truth inside of you
Iâm only a whisper away

The great divide will separate
Me from you and now
Donât give in, resist the hate
Free your mind from all

Tomorrow holds a brand new life
Once again the sun will set
Look once more to the starry skies
And weâre together
