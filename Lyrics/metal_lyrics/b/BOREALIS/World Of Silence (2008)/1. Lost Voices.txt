Come help us please
The voices they call to me
They want to be free

For all of their pain
Iâll rise up once more
I will open the door

Voices are calling
In my head
Voice of the fallen
Haunting me again
They speak of the dying
Cold and bare
Children are drying
Men only stare

Voices screaming in my head
The shadows of the dead
Their time will never come
Behind me there is a noise
Of crying men and boys
Hearing the lost voice

Iâm never alone
The silence they still wonât go
Not until they know

Theyâre not gone in vain
They honor us with pain
So they call my name

Beaten and torn
How could I
Rid of the scorn
Only with my mind
Iâll do my best
Helping them
Peacefully rest
Silence will come then
