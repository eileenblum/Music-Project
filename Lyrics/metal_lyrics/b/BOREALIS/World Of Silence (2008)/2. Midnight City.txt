Beyond the cages of your mind
Past horizons of the sky
Lies a place cast in doubt
The long forgotten hellish town

Leave them behind, leave the night
Come to the city of the lights
Come for a ride now come in
Into the land of shameless sin
The Midnight City

Unseen, unheard your sinning ways
Leave your throne, but for a day
Forget the people, those who stay
And travel far away

Come on in, into this misery
Endless sin feel the midnight air
