As I close my eyes one more time
See the same things I saw last night
Fall asleep to the sound of screaming
Live my life as if Iâm dreaming

Images of you pass by me
You never stood beside me
In the dark I can see your light
In this darkness I spend one more night

Oh, youâll never see what I see
In just the blink of an eye
No, behind these eyes broken mind
Images never to die
Take me to a place where I wonât feel this way
And erase this dark pain
Too much of this sadness turns to rage
And a man gone insane

Lie awake, never sleep in this state
Darkness shows me things I canât take
Take control show the world whatâs been done
From insanity I canât run

Spiraling into the fire
Falling into the dark
Nevermore will I suffer
Follow me never again
