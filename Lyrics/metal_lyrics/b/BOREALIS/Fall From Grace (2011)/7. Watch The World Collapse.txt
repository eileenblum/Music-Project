See the smoke reach to the sky
Visions of my demise
A sight best left unseen
I know I'm not awake
But the pain I still feel
Who am I to say what's real

Free fall into paradise, a world of lies, when you
Free fall you will see what you cannot be

Take these memories when I wake
Of the years that have gone by
Emotions I can't deny
To have lived another life
In a world non-existent
How does one live again

When you feel your life is over
But you're really just asleep
When reality surrounds you
Realize it's just a dream

Try to leave this dream I'm in
These cold hands hold me down
Pull me deeper in my mind
I feel I'm going to drown
I see the world collapse around me
Feel the walls cave in
The sky is torn, the world is burning
I can't escape this hell

My sanity has betrayed me
This can't be real...
