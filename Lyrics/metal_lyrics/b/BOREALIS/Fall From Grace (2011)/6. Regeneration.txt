Without a paddle in the darkest sea
From the shore they call to me
Promising all of my dreams
I fade into the night

Change this life laid for me
Take home and pray
Take reality, take this life from me, oh no
I'm not free

Empty words, shattered pride I had
You lead me down a path of shame
The stories I write for myself
I'm not of your kind

Take reality, take this life from me, oh no,
I'm not free
Soon I'll rise and see, what I am to be, at last
Regeneration

My blood coursing through my veins
The gift for what I have done
Til now hiding bliss from me
This truth will now set me free
