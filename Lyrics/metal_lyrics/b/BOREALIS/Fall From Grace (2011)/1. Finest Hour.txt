Rise up to these bitter times
To uncertain rhymes
Find yourself between the lines, end of days

Within these pages lies a written memory
Of the story of the fallen ones
The pride and freedom, of the ones who risked it all
Made the sacrifice and gave their lives
Cause they were...

Free men, with the will to live
Knowing it would cost their lives
No flag or fail to end the night
Restore the broken pride

Where ever we may fight
In the wrong or right
Devotion and courage sees us through the night

On these pages
We'll write our history
Write the story of the world at war
Pride and freedom, we're the ones who risked it all
Made the sacrifice and gave our lives
Cause we were...
