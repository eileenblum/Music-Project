Tired enough to let it go
Awake enough to fight
Too proud to know you've sunk so low this time
Leaving you with an unknown reason
The strength to do and thought to see somehow

Now a life's work looks withered on your tired face
A new man I see with my eyes

Forces strike again, it's pointless to pretend
We can help the evil that's inside you
Taken away, but remembered to this day
That's what I failed to say while you were here

To live as young men in the prime of our lives
Chances lost, sights unseen
