Attack this broken soul
Take and leave me in
You think that I forgot you
Destroying part of me
You don't even know
Your scent is all I breathe

You left me long ago, walking on my own
You swear you won't return
In times of clarity, sky breaks through the clouds
And you will leave me be

Flash of truth, back where we started
Your peace, my war

It's warm inside this lie, the world escapes me
Just me and you again
You only wanted peace, for you that's the end
But all I got was war

The distance suits you well
You get to miss the show
I pray that you, you're happy
While I descend to you

Flash of truth, back where we started
Your peace, my war
Miles away, too close for comfort
Your peace, my war
