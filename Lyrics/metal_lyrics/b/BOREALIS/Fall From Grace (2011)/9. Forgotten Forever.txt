Mirror sees a different face
From what you recognize
New light cast on old place
And seen through empty eyes

One moment's thought defines a lifetime
And this moment will be yours
Take this time to see your new reality

You hear them calling
No one else will know
Don't you ever let these cracks show

When your thoughts become lost
What was good becomes bad
All at the damning cost
Of all you ever had

Another mind lost to the depths
To see what no one else can

An existence cast in a memory
And forgotten forever
