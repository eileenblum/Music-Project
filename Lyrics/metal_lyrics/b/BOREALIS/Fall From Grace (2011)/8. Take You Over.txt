How can I forget
If you cannot forgive
The past, ever haunting
I've nothing good to give

Fear overcomes you
Driving you insane
Feel it take you over
Feel the warming pain

When I close my eyes
I see you night and day
I dream of my revenge
You took and now I'll take

With left inside
You tremble in this...
