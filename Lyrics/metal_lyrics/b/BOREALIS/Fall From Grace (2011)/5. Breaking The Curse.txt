Another wasted night without you
Empty bottles to the side
Scattered pages lie around me
Written words of better times

I won't let you be the key
Unlock what hides inside of me
A restless soul that longs to see
What it can truly be

A lyric of a new beginning
A war against my demons will
Exorcise these thoughts from my head
Make time stand still
