Dreams of freedom
Lost in this forsaken land
No one left to find you
Running scared
Fooled by those greedy hands
Familiar places become new

Same old song
Pick up where the old ones left
He said he'd heed our calls
Far too long
Another reign at his behest
Dreams of freedom call
Hope is gone for all

Rob us, drown us in your evil lies
We don't recognize this place
Free us, promise us a brand new time
This will be our fall from grace

Brand new day
New beginning, same old end
Safe in his little shell
Chance ends soon
His opportunity to change
Then we can break his spell

Fear not my child, your day will come
Into the wild don't fear
