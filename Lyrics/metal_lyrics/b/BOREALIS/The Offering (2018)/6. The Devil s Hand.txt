Take the Devil's hand
Watch the world end
I beg for mercy

My dark reality
I'm lost in my insanity
Lead me away to paradise

Tears fall for your life
Your angels coming
We rise, you fall

Take all I have
This doesn't have to be
The rain will erase my fears
The darkness shadows me
I'm lost in a memory
They're here, I tried, I'm sorry

Tears fall for your life
Your angels coming
We rise, you fall
Leaving
We cleanse our souls together

Final hour
We offer the boy who's pleading
Lost forever
Hear his cries forever
