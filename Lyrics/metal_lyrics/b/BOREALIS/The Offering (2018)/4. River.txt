Will you inspire peace
Now that we've lost ourselves
Join us and be free
Repair the damage of hell

Hold me river
I'll need you until the end, my saviour
Catch me river
I'm alone without you

I can't feel, I can't see
My heart she bleeds to death
I try to fight back but
I can't conquer this world

Rise up, remember me
I cannot be forgotten
The storm is coming
I'm trapped alone in the dark

My mind goes numb
These walls come in on me
