A hymn for all the lost
Forsaken souls
(Forsaken souls)
Tempted by the words of
Salvation

You brought me here
You told me I'd save this world
(Become the second son)
They never told us we'll
Suffer through hell first

Hold on
I'm lying here my wounds still bleeding
Hold on
Beaten down and left me screaming
Save me
Please tell me I'm worth saving
And take me home

The days grow dark
I'm feeling cold
My wounds start to fester

The bleeding won't stop
And I'm all alone
Somebody please help me

Oh â we'll never change this world
No matter what we suffer
It's all in vain

I don't know
If I'll hold on
They've already drained
So much of me

I fear they've taken
Far too much
In search of what they believe

A false messiah
The second son
A saviour to cleanse the world

My withered state
I start to fade
My final drop escapes me

Hold on
I fade into eternity
A dark embrace
With death smiling back at me
Oh â and as I give my final breath I know
I'm not the second son
