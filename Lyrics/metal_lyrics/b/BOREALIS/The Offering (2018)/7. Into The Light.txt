Crawling further
Hold me down
Create the path for me
Into the light

Clear the water from my eyes
The torment slips away
Falling into grey

I'm being hunted
Where do you run, where to hide
I'm bruised and broken
My freedom, my life, I'll survive

I see a sign from above
As I open up my eyes
Provide me hope and set me free
I can't scream anymore
I rise into the light
I want to find the holy land

Light the fire
I'll watch them pray, as I burn
Catch me river
You'll save me and carry my soul away

My hands are tied, I'm lost in your world
The fire in my eyes, the frozen sky awakes

I see a sign from above
As I look up into the skies
Provide me hope and set me free
I can't take this pain anymore

I can't conquer these daemons alone
I'm awake in a nightmare
Please help me I'm losing control
I'll haunt you forever
