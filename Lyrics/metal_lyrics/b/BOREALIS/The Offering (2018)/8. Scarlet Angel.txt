Where do I run
What do I search for
Theyâre looking for innocence in us

Itâs time to fall asleep now
I close my eyes and see the stars above

Calling to you
Looking for answers
The falling leaves surrounding us

The storm is here
The dark is coming
You pulled me down
And now Iâm holding on

I feel the hands hold me
I feel the sun

Watch me burn
Surrounded by the cold
See the leaves fall
Be my scarlet angel

Light the fire
And watch me burn
My freedom my life
Iâve lost control

Helplessly waiting
My hands are tied
The light is gone
Release my soul
