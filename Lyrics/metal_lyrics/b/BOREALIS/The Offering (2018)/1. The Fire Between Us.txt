The memories of life we see
We find a reason
To realize together

Tomorrow holds another day
We look for answers
We will fight to rise

Your time is over
Follow the truth
That the world is ending
Feel the lies through
Your leaders' hands

Follow me, the time has come
Weâll change the world from the light
I will guide you there

Trust in the faction
Follow my path
The fire between us
Call onto the world above
