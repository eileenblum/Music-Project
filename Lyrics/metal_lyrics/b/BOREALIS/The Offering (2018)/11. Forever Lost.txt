I fear the day to come
What madness surrounds me
The pious preach of saviours
We'll break through suffering

I watched you all
Lead us astray
And cast us all to darkness
You made us feel like we could be saved
It's all a lie

Forever lost, forever gone
From the fires they will say
Save this world again
A sacrifice made in vain

The chains wrapped around me
The damned sing of faith
The frozen winter soul
Will melt against the flames

Their screams echo in my mind
The blind, lead the blind
They made their sacrifice

But I know the fire means the end
A sacrifice is made
No retribution, for the pain
