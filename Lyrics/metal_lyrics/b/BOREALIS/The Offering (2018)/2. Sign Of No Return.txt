I'll light the path
The forest and trees will save us
The rain will erase our steps
I take you away

We end this illusion
Join the circle of truth
The final solution
Shadows to the moon

Sign of no return
The sickness I endured

Leave all you know
Run far away from freedom
The end you will see
Abandoning your fate
