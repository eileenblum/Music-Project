Oh holy creator
We thank you for your patience and mercy
Please bless us forever
We're obedient to your word

We offer this soul and our savior
To prevent destruction

We pray to the spirits, allows us to
Protect us from the afterlife
We present the offering
His soul will be waiting
The Earth will be your paradise
The heat of the flame,
Your kingdom will be done

The sun will be darkened
The stars will fall from the sky
Judgement day is coming
We'll be ready to burn the grave with fire

We offer this soul and our savior
To prevent destruction
From the wrath of our god
