Bleed the heart of new found pain.
Conceal the loss, nil to gain.

The magnitude of bitter loss.
Broken in two.
Subtle vain attempts.
Falling your demise.
Hated worth content with loss.
Utopia denied.
Falling your demise.

You'll never clutch a shred of peace.
Inside your clouded mind.
Forgotten left behind.
Far blocked and blind.
Inner self is mere shadows.
Forgotten is yourself.
You'll never clutch a shed of peace.
Inside your clouded mind.
