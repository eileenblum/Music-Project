Ignorant in thought.
Distorts your twisted values.
Break your ancient chains.
And part with the ways of the past.
You don't have the right.
To force you own opinion.
You don't understand.
So you have to lash out.

Anti - homophobe.

We believe in freedom.
Whatever turns you on.
Life is short and full of woe.
So you have yourself a blast.
I may not be gay.
But I don't care if you are.
Live your life in peace.
And fuck them if they laugh.
