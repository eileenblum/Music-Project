Destroy our future, each breath last, now the final die is cast!
From within destroy and ruin, guaranteed to seal our doom
The truth we choose forever face, annihilate the human race.
- HUMAN ERROR -

- SEALS FATE -
- DESTROYED FUTURE -

- IN DREAD WE WAIT -
Remaining ever mute and bound, the truth we seek is never found,
Armageddon from inside, human race deserves to die
- HUMAN ERROR -

- SEALS FATE -
- DESTROYED FUTURE -

- IN DREAD WE WAIT -
