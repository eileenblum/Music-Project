Drawing.
From the truth.
Innocent few cast their chip in.
Praying.
Count accounts.
Believe in something for a price.
Cop-out.
Broken dreams.
Deceiving more - you've raped their heart and soul.

Capitalize - false gimmick for the weak and needy.
Blind angel - the shortest distance from the truth.
Rotted minds - believe your loaded lot of shit.
Forgotten few - sorry victims of divine crimes pay their lives.

You're faceless.
Beyond crimes - you've taken on a new level.
Hatred.
More spite...than any other.
Gutless.
Gutting victims, hollow shells, empty lives.
Lifeless lives.
