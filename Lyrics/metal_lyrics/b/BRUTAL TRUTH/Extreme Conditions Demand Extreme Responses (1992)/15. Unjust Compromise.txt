Visions behind walls.
Hide sordid truths.
Unjust suffering.
Upper hand blinds you.

Blind eyes never see.
Sheltering.
Forever unjust compromise.

Raping others.
Terminate will.
Forced extinction.
Capitalize the kill.

Blind eyes never see.
Sheltering.
Forever unjust compromise.

Ours not meant to be.
But you'll never see.
The tales of misery.
Small minds crushing fees.

Blind eyes never see.
Sheltering.
Forever unjust compromise.
