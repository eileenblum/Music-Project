Times a changing
Take control of your shiny toy
And break your hold
A failed reign of self control

A perfect imperfect laugh
Laughing down a hole
Searching for some clarity
Taste the powder on your tongue
Close the book on life today

Times a wasting -- take a look at yourself
Reflecting on your misery collapsing

Times a wasting -- take a look at yourself
Better late than never taste your powder burns
