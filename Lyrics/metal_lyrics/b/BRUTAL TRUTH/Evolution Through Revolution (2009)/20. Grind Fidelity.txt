I'll find a better way
Preach of love and hope another day
Face another day
Much the same as the useless day before
Drop my jealousies
My fooled ambitions of peace
While man destroys our earth
My life my ambitions lie

Punching through another day,
Swimming through disease
Reaching through your inner demons
While smashing all divisions

Lay to rest your tired dreams of grand design divisions
Lick the blood of razor wire
Cutting through thick mire.
Spilling empty policies -- mundane hypocrisies
Catapult your logic transgress inaccuracies...
And life deals
