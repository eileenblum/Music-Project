A social cleansing to brighten our shie
Our post world order holds the test in time
And all the devils smiling handfuls of thoughts
Their choking thoughts of my brave new world

A world of order, one of control
A world in broken dreams of something forgone
A world of selfless and expressionless thought
Of grazing sheep losing track of their flock...
Their flock

A world of order that evolves from the heart
I break the rhythm of all you would want
A system of pride with hopes and dreams
Broken shards of glass cuts deep through our seam

Evolution revolution watch you redefine
Evolution revolution watch you cross the line
Evolution revolution practice what you preach?
Evolution revolution watch you redefine...you define
