I taste the dreams of yesterday
Choosing wise of what to say
Move too slow, bitch and moan

I'll -- I'll find
Your future ain't so ugly
You'll decide
Watching you -- killing me

I taste the dreams of yesterday
Choosing wise of what to say
You move too slow, bitch and moan

I'll -- I'll find
Your future ain't so ugly

A curse within your wildest dreams
Believe in change... believe it

A curse within your wildest dreams
Negative thoughts of yesterday
