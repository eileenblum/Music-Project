Our blind ambitions only bleed us dry
Endless drama always killing time

Scratch your innocence

Consume the soul of mankind
Enslaved in our zombie dance
Claw through the dirt of man
Picking apart our holocaust
Pick it apart

A rabid lust to penetrate our being
Pursue our future
And calculate risks through global decimation
Pick it apart

Our blind ambitions only bleed us dry
Endless drama always killing time
Dogs in chains howling at moons
Brave new dreams with crazy fools?

Scratch your innocence
