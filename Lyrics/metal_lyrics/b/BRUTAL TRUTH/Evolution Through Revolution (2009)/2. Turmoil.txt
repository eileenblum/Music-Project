Forget your past -- fall in sync
Building lies with black deceit
Watch our lord bow and crack your mind
Watch them all form a line

Watch the lot follow sheep
Grazing fuels the obsolete
Build a life to surpass
Bending thoughts to false belief
End the crime of all mankind
Our sweet need to kill in your good name

Kiss the cross and hope to see
What those above have chose to seize
A world of turmoil, blocked in pain
Only to repeat again
