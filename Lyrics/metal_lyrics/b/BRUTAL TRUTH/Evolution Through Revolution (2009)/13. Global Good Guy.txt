Hell fire, feel my blood begin to boil
Dark religion, a doctorate charade
Preach your politics of global good guy
Watch our world catch cold and die

Watching it die
Trained monkeys
Grinding their pockets for crime
Lessons -- preach choirs and gospels reign down
Slipping -- the morals and crimes that you paint

Hell fire, feel my blood begin to boil
Preach your politics of global good guy
Fuck you

Poor vision previsions of booty
Good guys in black attack
The symptoms, the sweating, the sneezing

Trained monkeys
Grinding their pockets for crime
Lessons -- preach choirs and gospels reign down
Slipping -- the morals and crimes that you paint
Forgiving -- the gospel of choirs ring out

The gospel of bullshit and lies...
