War is good
Can't you feel the prosperity
Breath success
Knocking on the door
Handing out all the blood soaked money
Our future world collapsing in the infrastructure

Killing survival

Killing survival
Once you drop and break your silence
Killing survival
Our future world will explode
Killing survival
A life based on random crime
Killing survival
Would you rather educate

Kill or survive it does not matter
As long you do not educate
