You're searching for your mind don't know where to start
can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart
you think you know but you are never quite sure
your soul is ill but you will not find a cure.
Your world was made for you by someone above
but you chose evil ways instead of love.
You made me master of the world where you exist
the soul I took from you was not even missed.
Lord of this world Evil possessor
Lord of this world He's your confessor now!
