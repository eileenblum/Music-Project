your subtle swing, afflicted mind
no control, flawed traits released from your obvious end
next hand, start a new, or duck the shattered glass of your mind
time for ... change

can't you see, see your fears of moving on
clear of doubt, as on and the same regrettably
see your fears moving on, doubting the action
long forgone
controlled by inner games, with none to blame
