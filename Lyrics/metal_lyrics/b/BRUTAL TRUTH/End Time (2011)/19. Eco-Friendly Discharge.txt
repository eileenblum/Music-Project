Cleaning and sweeping, ever erasing my past malfunctions.
Iâm bored with the lot, itâs boring in plots, of all our pollutions.
Kissing the beauty of better living, chemical solutions.

Hold me tight and feel my eco-friendly discharge.
Balancing your life - finish your lifeâ¦
Balancing your life - finish your lifeâ¦ eco-friendly discharge.

Dissecting the past sands in a glass, time wastes dilutions.
Forgotten lessons of self destruction annihilated condition.
Sucking the heart from a green star, lust and embrace oblivion.

Hold me tight and feel my eco-friendly discharge
Balancing your life - finish your lifeâ¦
Balancing your life - finish your lifeâ¦ eco-friendly discharge.
