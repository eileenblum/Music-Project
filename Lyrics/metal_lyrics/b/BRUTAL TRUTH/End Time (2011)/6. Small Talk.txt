The flooding and grieving, our world ever changing, ignore itâs rumblings.
Seasons changing, tides are rolling, we tackle destruction.
All of it rushes under our breath - our world is useless in mean,
The useless act of communication.
Bringd excessive corruption.
Ever changing, ever evolving, ever patient, ever crawling.
