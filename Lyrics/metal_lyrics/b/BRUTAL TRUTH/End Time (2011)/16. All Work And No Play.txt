Our system is built on twigs of corruption, power and greedâ¦
Social disorder looting and rioting, killing greedâ¦
Grace in a world under siege - destructionâ¦
Pick off our weak - preach for a lifeâ¦ a quiet ending.
All work and no play.
Destroy world.
So quit your bitching, our worldâs ending - our lives are set on course.
A social meltdown, global implode.
Gouging prices social unrest.
Scavenging for our basic needs.
Zombies clawing brains for meat.
All work and no play.
