Drop a quarter in a dime-size slot.
Pick a number as you scratch your cards.
Double down crossing number off.

Play to win always lose your thoughts.
Roll the bones is the game Iâve only known.
Hitting back is the fact that I broke your bones.

Born to lose as I look at my tired face.
Aware of what my mind could trace.
Blow a line, draw a lie inside the crimes.

Play to win always lose your thoughts.
Roll the bones is the game Iâve only known.
Hitting back is the fact that I broke your bones.
Roll the bones is the game Iâve only known.
Hitting back is the fact that I broke your bones.

Drop a quarter in a dime-size slot.
Pick a number as you scratch your cards.
Double down crossing number off.

Forfeit heart and mind.
