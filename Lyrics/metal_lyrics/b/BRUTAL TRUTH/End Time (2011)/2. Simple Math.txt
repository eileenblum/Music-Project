The swelling of people dispelling our country.
The bullets are flying and bodies are dropping.
Depleting resources accepting the calling.
Compounding the forces and fueling falling.
Calling simpleâ¦ math.
Animal survival instinct engaged.
Plug in the numbers of simple math.
Continued depleted resources.
A human population explosion.
A world saturated with greed.
And crime crumpled social order.
Fall of man, impending doom.
Passing the ashes to our tomb.
