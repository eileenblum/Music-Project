Kiling time planet Earth.
Force fed your feed - despite all the swine usurp and breed.
Stuck in the guts of transparency.
The devils are taking aim to feed.
Ripping the stitching from our own needs.
Fear of thinking wrong or right.
Caught in the guts of transparency.
Killing for kicks is the call of the day.
Killing our time on planet Earth.
Check out the games we play.
Feeding our faces fat with greed.
Class of wealth and swineâ¦ close in their blockades.
Step foot to head, stomp on our hope and dreams.
Leeching blood from me.
Dear Christ in pain.
The Christ in me.
