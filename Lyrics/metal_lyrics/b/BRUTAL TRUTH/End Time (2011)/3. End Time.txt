Our future is now, our world is ending.
Our life for the disdain has brought about our end timeâ¦ itâs our time.
For those who would fail to see a future uncertainty, end time is certainly.
Bring in your lost and pray, our worldâs catastrophe, bring in the lost to stay.
The end time is our time - our time is the end time.
No matter what our self destruction.
A condition of memory suppressing past transgressions
Bring on our annihilation as our world in chaos collapses.
It never fails to amaze me how quickly we forget.
Watch our world in chaos collapse.
Our time.
Our time here on planet Earth.
Cradle oblivion.
Fall asleep in arms cradle oblivion.
