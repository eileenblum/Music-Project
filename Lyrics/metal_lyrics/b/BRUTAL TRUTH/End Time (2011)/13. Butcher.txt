A part of me just died.
Stare your death at me.
If you gave a shit and tried.
You might see.
Your friends youâre butchering.
Wonât lie.
Your friends youâre butchering.
So fucking done.
Butchering. Butchering. Butchering.
Youâd butcher God for your own greed.
Soulless, youâre fucking soulless.

Your friends youâre butchering.
Wonât lie.
Your friends youâre butchering.
So fucking tired.
Butchering. Butchering. Butchering.
Youâd butcher God for your own greed.
Soulless, youâre fucking soulless.

Breaking down your taxing sins.
Breaking down your taxing sins.
Youâre bedded down with bugs.
Attached with death in drugs.
Scratch and claw a thought.
Attached with death in drugs.
Youâre bedded down with drugs.
Attached with death in bugs.
Scratch and claw a thought.
Attached with death in bugs.

Butchering. Butchering. Butchering.
Youâd butcher God for your own greed.
Soulless, youâre fucking soulless.
