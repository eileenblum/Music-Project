Embrace my trouble mind - rattle on.
Connect between the lies.
A march back in the mines - rattle on.
Normality - relatively.
Life with me and no prosperity.
Inside my trouble mind.
Complicated.
To reach for this is wrong?
Reach for my warm embrace of poverty.
Rumbles on.
Inside that troubled mind.
A march back in the mines - rumble on.
Normality - relatively.
Life with me and no prosperity
Inside my trouble mind.
Complicated.
To reach for this is wrong?
Reach for my warm embrace of poverty.
