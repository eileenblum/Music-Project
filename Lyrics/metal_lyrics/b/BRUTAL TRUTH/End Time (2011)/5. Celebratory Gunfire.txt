Take your time and breathe in.
Before the cost of existence.
Consumes the light of humanity.
Kill the depths of your rage.
Take your time and breathe in.
Calibrate your visions.
Dial in repercussions.
Celebrate your taste for lead.
Open your eyes, our world, the fear grips you.
Complacent or motivated you lust for the fight.
Psyched to form your lies of your hatred.
Looking for life of what youâd like to be.
Spiraling down. Hopeless.
Celebrate with gunfire.
Celebrate the casualties dropping lead as rain.
