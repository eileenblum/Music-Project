[Brutal Truth]

[extra throat noise by Bill Yurkiewicz (EXIT-13) courtesy of Relapse Records]

Idle and silent
Idle and silent
Idle and silent
Burn alone

From time to time one can find
Reason enought to draw the line
Complacency charmes our world's decline
Progress is treason defined
Will you see beyond your black door mine
