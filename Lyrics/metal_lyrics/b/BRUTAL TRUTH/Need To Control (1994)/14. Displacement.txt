[Brutal Truth]

No more...
Blind falsity
Tears left to see
Fear left in me
Pain inside me head
No more...
Corporate casualities
Progress, myths and lies

Would you, call upon a book of lies
Blame aside, watch you try and rationalize

Push walls to the threshold of pain

Genetics unmatched in the inhuman acts of capitalist fucks
Cashing grants, the majority obvious to pain and suffering,

Would you, fall from grace, desensitize
Crawl inside socially fed mass genocide

Would you, face the truth or capitalize
Falsify, bloodshot cracks in visions eye
