[Brutal Truth]

Hated... time and time again
Force fed, supress senseless fear of difference
True self suppression, hollow dreams of misery

Blind wish to see
Indifference to be

Freedom, expressionless bouts of legislation
True self repression, take a stance of fall to your needs

Corrupt in the system
Laws bent to other needs
God fearing idiocy
Ignore just pleas

Blind wish to see
Indifference to be
Concrete hypocrisy
Weigh heavily

Idosyncrasy
Ruling powers be
Idiosyncrasy
Never really free
