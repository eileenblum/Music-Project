preconditioned
accepting your role
robbed of your and stripped of your soul
fall into the same routine
of drab existence, what does it mean?
Are you satisfied with the way that you exist
every single day, like the one before
don't you feel the need to express the way you feel
wake your sleeping head, there's so much... more !
just a walking corpse !
repeat first verse
repeat second verse
