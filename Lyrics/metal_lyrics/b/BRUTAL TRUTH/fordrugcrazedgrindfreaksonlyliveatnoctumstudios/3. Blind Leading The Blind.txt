pollutants arriving, the kids are all fighting
why turn your cheek, block reality
for in blind faith, you look the other way
you sittin' pretty, wait until another day
be true in yourself, have faith in what you're made
act on instinct, in all the rules you break
social disease, rotting time away
too late for preaching, hold your breath apocalypse
the time has come, the breaking point in our social decline
humankind oblivious, every life runs its line
toy soldiers march on, watch the blind lead the blind
much obliged
