i'll swing to the left, you'll sway to the right
think for yourself, zombie-ritualistic sight
fuck that
false-worlds, false words
fuels religions hypocrisy
fooled religious mockery
to justify your treason
obey, you prey
the hope in possibility
to preach life today
if love is lost pay the cost
bleed your fucking soul
break your hearts divinity
capitalist fucking whore
open cash proceure
to prey on social weak
fuck your reservations
i've tried your fantasies
