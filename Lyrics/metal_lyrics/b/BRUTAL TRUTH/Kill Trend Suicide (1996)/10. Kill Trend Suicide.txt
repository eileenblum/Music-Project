your fashion, kills trends to their end
your cycle of nonsense bleeds to its core, repeats once again
perfection, best play by the rules
this shit by you false-core will kill your own trip
play you the fool
kill trend suicide
false-core genoocide

the fashion, gone glory to capitalist ways
faceless, sold into corporate ways
no vision or thought is what you get out, fight for your own belief
for in the end you must give in, fuck off trend casualties

this way,
that way,
no way,
well anyway
