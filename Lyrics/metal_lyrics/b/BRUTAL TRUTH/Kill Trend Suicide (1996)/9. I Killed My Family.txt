[Originaly recorded by YDl]

I killed my family
why, why, why, why?

too much presure on my job
prices are rising way too high
something snaps, cracks in my head, in my head

I killed my family
why, why, why, why?

baseball bat connects with warm flesh
blood splattered walls, couches &amp; carpets
crush and smash their faces like a ripe grape, like a ripe grape
