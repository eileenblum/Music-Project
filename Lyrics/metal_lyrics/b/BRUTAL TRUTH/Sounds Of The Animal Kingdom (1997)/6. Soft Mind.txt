inbred the liars
they're bying and selling
in soft minds
castrate their mission
your loss of dscisions combine
your faith in the after
enslaving the present
varies in crime
your faith in the after
enslaving the present
divine in their claims

falls in their line
malediction - pass suspicions
through divisions by tradition
contradictions - pass suspicions
through divisions by tradition
all consuming

falls in their line
malediction
contradictions
all consuming
