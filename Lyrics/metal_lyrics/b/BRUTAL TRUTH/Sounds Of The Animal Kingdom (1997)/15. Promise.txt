life load, a time to re-evaluate
pitcure the crimes
you re-evaluate
pull unto your greater
promised land
punching through
the conscience of your
promised land

pull unto it's just a shame,
if not the same,
at fault is not the issue
if blood is red, it's not the same,
the end to meet is bullshit
the issue of its higher
conscience, its fucking
deathstrike
decriminalize, time at hand,
bring forth the promised land
