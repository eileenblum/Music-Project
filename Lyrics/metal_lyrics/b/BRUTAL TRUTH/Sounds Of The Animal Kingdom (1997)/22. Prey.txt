"...we are, despite all our great technological advances, still very much a
simple biological phenomenon. Despite our grandiose ideas and our lofty
self-conceits, we are still humble animals, subject to all the basic laws of
animal behavior..."

- Desmond Morris from The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal -

"Hell remains a very democratic place in most religions, with unbaptized
stillborns thrown in the same lake of fire with serial killers and child
rapists. What you call monsters are superior forms, beyond your understanding.
Isn't a man of genius a monster, like a tiger or a spider, like all
individuals who live beyond social lies. It isn't dying that's sad; it's
living when you're not happy. The sexual organ, far from being an object of
infamy and image of impurity, was a god. I took atrocious delight in accusing
myself, making myself uglier, more of an outcast and blacker than I was. Have
you become senseless - as senseless as a member of the majority? We live under
the laws of war. It consists of massacring as many men as you can in the least
possible time. Hospitality versus hostility?"
