if life could bring
about harmony
beyond those grey days
which way, pursue utopia

the punishment on our
daydream nations
calling you, temptations
countdown, oblivion
make no mistake

life has so much more
than you let offer
look for love, lok longer
my time with you is over?
i said it's over
yes i did
our time is over
