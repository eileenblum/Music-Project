production declined, machines
we all march on
life swallowed in lies
detachment conclusion
your taste for pure freedom

the passion is over
no last goodbyes
you gained your pure freedom
and left us behind

can't you lok back before you
fucking booted smack
thought it was cool, in fact
you're wrong for taking life
deal pressure from life, not stray
for today, don't run away
machine parts all march on
