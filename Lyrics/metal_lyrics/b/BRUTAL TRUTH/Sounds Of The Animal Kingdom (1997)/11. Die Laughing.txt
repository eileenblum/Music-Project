lick the walls of what you find
global thoughts, caustic signs
it seemed to be life was free
common sense, apathy?
push to fore, clear your mind
draw your battles on mankind
time for war, kill your find
butcher time - slit the throat
by design

under the guise of democracy
hide the cloaks of all mediocrity
as we pursue global anarchy
war humanity
right now bring it on
killing spirit to get it done
humane slaughter mankind
my killing spirit carries life
divine
divine
kill
