humanity rising
life depriving
mankind decline
black humor falls in place
evolve in catalogue
prey of progress
self-evolution contribution
retributin at hand
pitch your fall for the big show
grand illusion of fruition
through suspicions of our end

next in line
step to me and bass the buck
it's only human actions
force me to lash out and crush

every day i see
the cattle march by
clueless victims of society's
numbing effects
told to listen, forced to turn off,
obey... non-thinking

conform to norm
or be tagged as wrong
wake-up sleeping nation
or be gone, gone
