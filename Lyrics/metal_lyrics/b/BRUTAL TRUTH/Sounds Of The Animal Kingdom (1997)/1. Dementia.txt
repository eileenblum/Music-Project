front, front life

life in sedation
no mental addictions
frustrated mind tangled in lies
progress dementia

do follow your instincts,
let others be
guide your own life
through reality
perceive depictions,
why can't you see
blind to real life, can't see

life in sedation
no mental addictions
frustrated mind tangled in lies
progress dementia
fueling the industry
death's futile misery
fueling the industry through
death's futile misery, progress
dementia

for what you see is your life
for what's to be is no life

do follow your instinct
