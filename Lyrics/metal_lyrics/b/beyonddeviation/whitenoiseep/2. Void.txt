[feat. Remy Provencher of Obliterate]Now, there's no one holding us back.
I can show you how easily I can break necks, you coward.
I'll prove you everything you have ever heard.

This is real.
I'll make sure you never heal.
You'll beg me to stop when I make you drop, cunt.

There's no way I won't end your days after what you did.
You should've known that there's no one here.
I don't know what came through your mind
Thinking you might have the upper hand.

I'm not sure you're ready for this.
You shouldn't have accepted to fucking face me.
Say goodbye to your mommy,
before you came in here to fucking fight me.
But you know it's too fucking late.

What is running through your fucking mind
When I'm pummeling you with the rage so blind.
You came so unprepared and not a second will be spared.

Now that there's no one left to help,
I can show you how easy it is to end you.
I'll hit you so hard that you will be left crippled and toothless.
I won't show any feelings from hearing you squeal,
Except for this grin as I take away your last breath,
from your cringing body.
There's no one here.
What came through your mind?
You thought you could bring me down?
Think you had any second thoughts?

You won't get to live the life you had.
You must keep looking forward and accept your fate.
It's too fucking late
I won't let you go back
There's nobody that will make me stop.
