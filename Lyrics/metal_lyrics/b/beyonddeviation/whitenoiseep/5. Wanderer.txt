[feat. Tyler Shelton of Traitors]The blinding sun awakens me
All I hear is the screeching noise of the lost souls begging for mercy.
I hear the sounds of desolation, and I fear I follow the noise to reach
The chaos walking around my area.
I hear the sound of desolation, and fear I follow the noise
To reach the chaos
As the sun beats down upon my face
I awaken to the noise of lost souls begging for mercy.
Dissonance through the silence, I hear the screeching, now
I'm hypnotized and mindless.

I am surrounded by chaos and the sounds of desolation.
Lost souls beg for mercy, for total decimation.
They're all still here lingering, shifting and moving gruesomely.

I've realized they're also following the discordant commotion.
Dissonance, through the silence, I hear screeching.
I'm hypnotized and mindless.

I am not a sheep
But this sudden siren has me in a trance.
My soul is not to keep,
I am just a lost soul. Lost soul.
