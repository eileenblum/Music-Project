Chained, concealed.
Locked up in your mind
Every word she says will tighten the bind
These illusions are not letting you out.
With her own inflicted distorted reality
She pulls the strings attached to your lifeless body.
You can scream your lungs out if you please
Your freedom in our hands obedience is key.
How I possess the knowledge of the puppeteer
Is that she had her grasp on me
Feel the grasp of her illusion
Welcome to the puppeteer's delusion
...puppeteer's delusion....
She is the key to your freedom such a malicious demon
You can scream but the keys are
..the keys are with the heathen.
Feed the grudging puppeteer
She grows as you drudge in fear
Feel the grasp of her illusion
Welcome to the puppeteer's delusion!
