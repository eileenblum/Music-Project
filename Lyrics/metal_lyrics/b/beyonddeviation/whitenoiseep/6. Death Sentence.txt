I am what's left of a man
I hate myself everyday for what I do, what I did.
I don't believe myself worthy of any attention, any song.
What I need is a rope around my neck, and a delete button over my existence.

A couple years back life was simple and clean.
Love who you love.
Fuck who interfere, then you grow up and realize fuck everyone.
This ain't a game it's a death sentence.
The second I see sunlight it means the end of the tunnel.
Believe me when I say it's the end.
Your body is a tomb.
Let your feelings and thoughts get through the body
Even healthy is worth nothing
Except for a glorious place in the... grave!
My life is the remains of a broken man's dreams.
Kick the chair fall down. Cracking sound. Done.

A couple years back my life was simple and fucking clean.
