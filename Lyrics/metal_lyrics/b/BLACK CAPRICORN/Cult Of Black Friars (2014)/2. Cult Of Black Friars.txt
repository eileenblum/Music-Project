An Ancient Order Was Born
To Fight Heresies And Heretics.
To Destroy Those Who Threatened (The True) Faith Of God
Was The Purpose Of some Lords.
At The Beginning Were The Cathars
(And From)
There Began The Worship Of Black Friars.

A Spy Destroyed The Munster Riot
(But Then) Things Changed Their Faith
(And The Order) Became The Hound of God.
One Day The Banker Fugger Were
Scammed (By) Lusty Heroes.
They Went to the God Vicar
Asking For Revenge.
And The Church said Yes To
Hide Their Sins.

Hound of God
Do You Remember some years ago.
Another Banker Of God Punished
This Time And Hung Out Under The Bridge
The Black Friars Is The Bridge.
This Is The Cult Of Black Friars
Inquisitors And Assassins
By The Hands Of God And His Power
His Power On Earth

Manus Domini Sumus. Caeli Facimus Voluntatum.
Suprema Lex Justitie Verbum Dominie. Exercitu Domini Somus.
Invictamque Vis Qui PonitNos Super Rene. Adventus Adventus
Tempor Dominabus Venit Sic Vestri Finis Est Hic.
