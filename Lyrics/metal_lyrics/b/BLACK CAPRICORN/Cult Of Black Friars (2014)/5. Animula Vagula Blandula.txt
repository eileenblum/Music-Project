Animula Vagula Blandula
Horses Comesque Corporis
Quae Nunc Abibis In Loca
Pallidula Rigida Nudula
Nec Ut Solesdabis Jocas

Little Soul Gentle And Drifting.
Guest And Companion Of My Body.
Now You will Dwell Below In My Pallid Places, Stark And Bare;
There You Will Abandon Your Play Of Yore.
But One Moment Still, Let us Gaze Together On These Familiar
Shores On These Objects Which Doubtless We Shall Not See Again...
Let Us Try, If We Can To Enter Death With Open Eyes.
