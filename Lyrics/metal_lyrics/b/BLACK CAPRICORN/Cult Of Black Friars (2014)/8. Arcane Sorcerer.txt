A young man runs
away from his sins
To save his life he's willing
to make a deal with a Dark Lady.
Pledges the memory of his mother
until his mission ends.
Pushed by the Dark Lady, the young mans
went to a mysterious Lord.

Run away your life is doomed.
Try to trick the fate again.
Lost in the maze with no way out.
In search of freedom, freedom forever doomed.

This Lord a time a Priest
removed from the Holy Church
because of it's occult search
he was called the Arcane Sorcerer.
The young and lonely man
in a God forsaken castle stand
witness of esoteric signs.
Brings numerical codes outside.

Run away your life is doomed.
Try to trick the fate again.
Lost in the maze with no way out.
In search of freedom, freedom forever doomed.

In a deeply dark night the young man
exhumes the body of the assistant
he takes him to the Priest of the village.
But the body belongs to the Lord!
The young man runs away again
from the Dark Lady, but again
turns out to be the Aide
of the Lord of the Castle.
