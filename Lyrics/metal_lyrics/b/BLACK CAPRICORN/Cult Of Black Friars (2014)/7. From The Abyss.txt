Leaving the harbor to sail in the unknown
People tell stories of islands alive
I know something is sleeping down
Waiting for the next prey to strip

The sound of waves is a jingle sending to sleep
While the fear increasing my mind
Heart is pumping blood like a gun shoots bullets

Here comes the hound of the deeper sea
My eyes are staring at the beast so close
Total terror takes hold of my veins
The blood is gone now with my life

Now begins the pursuit of an abomination
To a piece of wood and sail
Anything not to end up
In the Abysmal sea of his reign

All the crew screams victory for now
The vessel did not tear apart from the jaws of the monster
The sound of waves pushes us to the mainland
I look at my companions and know it's not over yet

A second attack comes to a sudden
The Abyss is certainly his kingdom and he is the undesputed King
The fear now is mixed with desire to save his life
because such a death would be too horrible

Even the sound of the waves that carried us back home
Hope, fear time that passes without a moments respite
A tiny insect along its giant corpse so we are
We have no alternative escape run away

Do not get caught
Not to sink into the Abyss
Trapped under the abysmal fear
We are another story to tell
