Regret that haunts you each and every day
You wonât forget, it eats away at you like at disease

Infecting you
Strangling tight around your neck
Constricts every breath
Thereâs no coming back

Youâre despised
You search for answers that wonât come
The despised
Thereâs no forgetting what youâve done
The despised
It rots away inside of you
The despised
Tearing you apart from the inside out

Disgraced you take refuse inside the hate
Left to decay, I am a piece of human waste

[Chorus]

I canât take back all of the stones Iâve thrown
I still would not take back what I have done

It is too easy to throw blame when thereâs so much there to throw
Why do my decisions hunt me down like a demon in the shadows
There is no need for a scapegoat when we are all to blame
Iâm tired of saying the same things over and over again

[Chorus]
