I can feel my absence is crushing you inside
I can hear the pain in all the words you say
They cut so deep, the wounds donât even bleed
Blinded by resentment that tortures me

Canât bear the pain that I have put you through
As I fear for the beast that cripples you
Stolen away like a thief in the night
Broken each day
Try to forget but it wonât go away

Another empty minute, an endless stream of days
The time that never seems to move is driving me insane
Another passing hour, a sentence I disdain
Begging the faceless shadows to release me from this place

Canât bear the pain that I have put you through
As I fear for the beast that cripples you
Stolen away like a thief in the night
Broken each day
Try to forget but it wonât go away

The time has come for me to be set free
Anxiety, it over takes me, Iâm paralyzed right through
The distance in between our fate is my never-ending doom

Because Iâm stolen away like a thief in the night
Because Iâm broken each day
Try to forget but it wonât go away
