To the poor man and to the ones with their broken lives
As your eyes swell with tears of the memories that they have stolen away
When you canât see the truth because itâs covered in so much blood and lies

The ones with power want your obedience
They want the conquered people that have nothing left
With eyes to see you weep uncontrollably
From womb to tomb, youâre just a commodity for them to control

Suffer rotting away
Forced to suffer
You canât break away
From their oppressing reign

Tear down the system and tear down the idols
That they have overthrown, worshipped and cloned
The ones who rule created the conspiracy
Control-divide-excised from all reality
To reach a point of complete dependency
From cradle to grave, youâre just a worthless piece of meat
to slaughter and eat

Suffer rotting away
Forced to suffer
You canât break away
From their oppressing reign

Suffering rotting away
