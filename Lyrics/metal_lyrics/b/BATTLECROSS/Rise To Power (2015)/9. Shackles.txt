Awaken to a world filled of apathy
Itâs feeding off itself, the fear and self-pity
Now youâre fed lies as truth and still you do not see
The noose around your neck is your complacency

Slowly poisoned by your food
Slowly trained by your own news

All that youâve been led to believe
Is just to keep you on your knees
You cling to your shackles
Like an addict clings to their disease

This is the fruit thatâs been wrought
Bought and paid for by our silence and ignorance
Begging for scraps as they take everything

All that youâve been led to believe
Is just to keep you on your knees
You cling to your shackles
Like an addict clings to their disease

Youâve been consumed by your fear
Trained to believe what you hear
Complacent while the ignorance breeds
Too afraid to get off your knees and fight
