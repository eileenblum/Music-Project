Be terrified of all the demons in the night
And all the terrors that it holds
Apocalyptic visions drowning out the light
Exposing darkness and the evil within us all

Fear your demise as it awaits
Feeling the excess of those deeds suffocating squeeze
You will know that it is done
If darkness prevails, they have won

In this game that we all play
You must win or die
Bound by fear, thereâs no escape
You are trapped inside
Youâre fighting to survive

Itâs too easy to be caught in the tangles of everybodyâs lies

You can only light so many till you realize
Darkness is always at your back
So you must rage against the dying of the light
And fight against the demons that still haunt your mind

Fear your demise as it awaits
Feeling the excess of those deeds suffocating squeeze
You will know that it is done
If darkness prevails, they have won

In this game that we all play
You must win or die
Bound by fear, thereâs no escape
You are trapped inside
Youâre fighting to survive
