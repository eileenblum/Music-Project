Face the day that stands before you
Do not be afraid of what may come
Use your strength within to define you
Hold to your ground and stay strong
Swear to a god which you donât even believe
Only in times of your selfish need
Hold your belief through the hard times
Your fate is destined to come

On through the darkest days
And the never-ending nights
A legendary war
Choose your path and fight

Cast away the chains the blind you
Now your past can no longer define you
Tomorrow is promised to no one
Defy ignorance till youâve won
How easy is it for you to wear a mask
Conceal your true intention
Hold your belief through the hard times
Your fate is destined to come

On through the darkest days
And the never-ending nights
A legendary war
Choose your path and fight
