Youâve killed, you have killed yourself with grief
You crave undeserving sympathy
All your lies, a fictitious fantasy
All the hate, playing your game of self-defeat

Twisting words that you create
Deception controlling your fate
Manipulated like a pawn
Forever this will carry on

Iâm not your slave
I refuse to be a part of this, your fabricated game
I am not your slave
You have tricked yourself into believing
Youâre not the enemy

Drowning in your filth
A plague to humanity
Raped of all free will
Youâre blinded by vanity
As you sulk around
Seeking out empathy
Condemned to solitude
You are the enemy

You tried taking advantage over me
You failed to gain power over me
Now itâs done, I see you now for who you are
Now itâs time to forget you and who are you

[Chorus]

You can no longer pretend youâre the victim
The transparency of your lies will not conquer me
