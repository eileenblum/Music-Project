This chaos is just a ladder
Some attempt to climb and fail
Never again tempted to try, they break and fail
Cracking under pressure
Clinging to your vain illusions
When escaping death is your only motivation

You will never move faster than
All the whips that are set upon your back
Marching over the corpses of the defeated
Claiming my victory

Actions speak volumes of what youâre worth in life
The climb is all there is, all you need to survive

Do not choose your path just out of desperation
Face your enemies, do not bow to their will
There is no such thing as courage without fear
Your sentiments are meaningless
When the end of life draws near

[Chorus]

Break beyond the boundaries of existence
The point of no return
Climb over the bodies of your victims
Determination tearing down the boundaries
Like paper walls

[Chorus]
