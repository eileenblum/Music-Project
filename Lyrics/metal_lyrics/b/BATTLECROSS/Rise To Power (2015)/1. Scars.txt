Now all of your secrets slip away into the night
Donât be afraid to let the buried see the light
Give up resistance. Donât conceal the pain inside.
Iâll just sit back and enjoy this ride

Spiraling deep into self-destruction

I gauge the past by every scar that I have to bear
Reject the end, embrace the beauty of your own demise

Fight, abandon secrets guiding you away from life
Remembering the memories inside your mind
This is the only way that they can stay alive
Release the horrors of your past

Spiraling deep into self-destruction
Reaching a new all-time low, drowning your soul

I gauge the past by every scar that I have to bear
Reject the end, embrace the beauty of your own demise

As I beg unto the light, it never answers me
All I want is for this hell to die in me

I gauge the past by every scar that I have to bear
Reject the end, embrace the beauty of your own demise
