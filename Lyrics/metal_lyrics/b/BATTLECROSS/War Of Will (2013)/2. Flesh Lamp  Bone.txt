Overcome their hate
Don't let them fool you
Into self-defeat or desperation
Let them choke on their envy
Hold fast to your own beliefs

Cowards die
Many times
Before they reach their own demise
The brave and the fearless
Taste it but once in their lives

Don't fear your day or reckoning
Make it fear you

Push
Push your past aside
Don't let fear eat you inside
Grow through the pain
You're more than flesh and bone

A hopeless existence
It's not a life I want to lead
There is no redemption
If you can't fight for yourself

Don't fear your day or reckoning
Make it fear you

Push
Push your past aside
Don't let fear eat you inside
Grow through the pain
You're more than flesh and bone

Push
Push your past aside
Don't let fear eat you inside
Grow through the pain
You're more than flesh and bone

I learn from the failures of others
I watch their worlds burn
Cast a shadow to hide their hate
While they do nothing to save themselves, to save themselves

Don't let their sorrows, their pain
Sway you from your true identity

You're more than flesh and bone
Flesh and bone
