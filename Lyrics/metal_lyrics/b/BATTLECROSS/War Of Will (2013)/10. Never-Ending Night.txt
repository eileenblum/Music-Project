I'm sacrificing watching you grow
As I pay this price
I need to keep my good thoughts close by
So I can make it through this night

This never-ending night

Don't get me started on what it feels like
When everyone says that they're proud of me
Wilting away what's left inside
I can't stop this pounding in my head

It's myself in the mirror
That I can't stand

I killed the man I used to be
Family and friends - a luxury lost
If my failures are passed on to you
I must make sure you're strong

Any problems just let me know!
