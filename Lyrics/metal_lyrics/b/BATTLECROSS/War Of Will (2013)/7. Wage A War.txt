You could say I've lived a foolish dream
Becoming exactly what I wanted to be
Don't let regret take the place of your dreams
This is your choice to make
How your name will go on
When you're dead and gone
This is your choice

Stand on your own wage your war
You must prove yourself
Fight back hold your ground
Stand on your own and test your strength

In your pursuit to find yourself
Sometimes your dreams become your nightmares
Don't be afraid to fight
Count only on yourself

Stand on your own wage your war
You must prove yourself
Fight back hold your ground
Stand on your own and test your strength
