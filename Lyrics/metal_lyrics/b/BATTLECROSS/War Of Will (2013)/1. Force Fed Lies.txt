All hail another worthless remark is made
Of all that is and will be changed
We are all not ignorant and blind
We will never be rid of this

Force-fed your lies
You sow the seeds of their deceit
Force-fed your lies
They'll never have their fill
Until long after you're dead
You're just another number
To be checked and then balanced
A tax to extract

When you're tired from running their race and realize
The money's not worth the paper it's on
Think for yourself and you can never be bought
Then you will have the strength to weather
The oncoming storm

The oncoming storm is not what it seems
It's filled to the brim with ravenous creatures
Driven to rape and deceive
