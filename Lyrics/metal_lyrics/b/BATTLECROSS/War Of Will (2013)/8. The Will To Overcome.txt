Will you have the courage to stand and shout at the world
You won't break me
I'll not bend my knee I'll be free
Because all I have is the will to find the truth inside me
I will be free from your irrational fantasies

Adhering to my code of honor
Resist romantic lies you've choked down all our throats
You have become a slave to your selfish vanity
You idols are pleasure, comfort, and apathy
This weakness will never set you free

When I die I will have left my mark on this world
You won't break me
I'll not bend my knee I'll be free
Because with my own strength
I have changed my destiny
Adhering to my code of honor
Resist romantic lies you've choked down all our throats
You have become a slave to your selfish vanity
Continuing on the path that you think you've forged
A road traveled by many
Now you make your choice
You must make your choice
Self - loathing or sanctity
You must make your choice
