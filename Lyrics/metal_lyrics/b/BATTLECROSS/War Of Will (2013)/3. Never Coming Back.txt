Tell me your weak excuse
Of how I never cared to see
The pain you were put through
All you do is point the finger
And through your blame

What lies in the past
Is never coming back

It's the reality
Of your decisions

You can't run from the truth forever
It will always beat you in the end

As you stand there
Holding the shattered
Pieces of your life
Chiding everyone
For not protecting you
Believe that you're the martyr
And drowned in your own lies

What we had
Is never coming back
Never coming back
