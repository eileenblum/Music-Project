Sometimes horrors can be blessings in disguise
Why don't you try fighting instead of wanting more
You disgust me with every complacent breath you take
It's far too easy to give up before you fall

I try so hard to keep my demons at bay
I try so hard to keep the beast inside caged

I clawed my way to get here by working harder than you
If you weren't so weak and petty you could be right here too
Weakness isn't something that will wash right off
Be marked with pride and honor or covered with filth and shame

I try so hard to keep my demons at bay
I try so hard to keep the beast inside caged
Chains on my throat to save yourself from me
Fighting the urge to keep the beast from you
