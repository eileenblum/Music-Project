My race your hate
What makes you better
Your complaints will go unheard now that
You have leeched your way underneath
Go away you're not welcome anymore
You bottom feeding fucker
You're not welcome

My god you're great
How did you get so good
Nail yourself straight up against the cross
You have leeched your way underneath
You're a martyr in your own mind
You want a beating fucker
It's all in your head

Becoming your own savior leech
Your own savior leech
Dig yourself a mother fucking grave
Fade away you've become dead to us
You have leeched your way underneath
Rot inside you're not living anymore
Leech
