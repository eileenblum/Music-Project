Those of you with the appetite to deceive
Disgusting how you can turn your back on me
Deception
You will not be the one
You will not deceive me
Chivalry has served as your disguise
Hiding all the jealously and lies
lies

I see a traitor
I see a cut throat two faced punk
It's time to worry about yourself
When you can turn to nobody else
Deception
You will not be the one
You will not deceive me

I was sent to make a point
To show you what your not
While I stepped up to prove you wrong
To put you to a stop
Test me

Peel the skin right from your face
Reveal the soul that lies underneath
Deception

Breath in the lies
Choke on the lies
These are the lies
That ruined your life
