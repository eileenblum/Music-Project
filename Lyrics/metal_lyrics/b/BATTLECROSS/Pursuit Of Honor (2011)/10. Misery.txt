Misery you'll take it all away
You don't have to bleed like this anymore
Who will end your pain for you who end all your suffering
Who will end your pain for you who end all your suffering
Beg for mercy

Now that you have brought this on yourself you will repent
Now that you are trapped in this hell you will live in misery

Strip you of everything that has made you
Everything that made you believe in yourself
Who will end your pain for you who end all your suffering
Who will end your pain for you who end all your suffering

Now that you have brought this on yourself you will repent
Now that you are trapped in this hell you will live in misery

Drown in self-pity
Write off all of your life's accomplishments
BLEED

Take one good look at who you are
Know you've done this to yourself
To know there is only one way out
Just end it all

Go and kill yourself
Cus who cares now
You burned the bridge
Now you will drown in misery
Misery
