Take a skilled manâs trade and leave it all to waste
Strip him of his flesh youâll bear his skin and bone
The more heâs pushed around the stronger he becomes
This is where he will prevail
You can push this man yet he never falls

The strong and silent
The man of stone
The strong and silent
To each his own
There is no other way
Persistence
To each his own there is no other way
How can the weak depend solely on their fate

Keeping to himself he will never say a word
You canât tear him down his skin will not be torn
His face made of stone his heart solid gold
This is where he will prevail
You can push this man yet he never falls

The strong and silent
The man of stone
The strong and silent
To each his own
How can you be so strong taking it day by day

With all the politics and all the union filth
He will fight for himself
He will grow old
The truth will show
He will fight for his own

The strong and silent
The man of stone
The strong and silent
The man of stone
The strong and silent
To each his own
