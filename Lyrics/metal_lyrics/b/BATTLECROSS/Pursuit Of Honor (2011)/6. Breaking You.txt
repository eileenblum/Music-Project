You were controlling me right straight from the start
And I never thought to take a breath for myself
I will take this breath
Cus Iâll inhale while I am
Breaking you

Drowning inside of a pool of your faith
Release the weights that continue to drag me down
I will never be held back
Cus Iâll exhale while I am
Breaking you

Shame on you for all the shit youâve stirred
I blame you for all that has occurred fucker

Controlling lies of a fake
This will be your last mistake
I will not ever let this
Become the end of myself

You could not be further more from the truth
I will become the mother fucking end of you
I will become your end
Cus Iâll Inhale while I am
Breaking you

Inhale
Exhale
