If you understood how much patience it takes to watch you walk by
To look at your face, you'd bury yourself so deep in the ground
And end your life forever, coward

The temptation to rupture you, pour the salt inside the wound
There is nothing you could do that would stop me from tearing your face apart
Rupture

Feel the punishment you're about to embrace abrasions all over will make you feel raped
I'll bury you so fucking deep in the ground and end your life forever, coward
Rupturing, you're suffering
Rupturing your face, cunt
This is the end
