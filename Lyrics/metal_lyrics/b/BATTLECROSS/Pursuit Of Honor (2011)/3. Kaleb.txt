Kaleb my son, for you I would tear this world apart.
I don't want my son to be anything like me, 
or the bullshit fake people on the t.v., 
or even right across the street. 
You will be as strong as you make yourself to be.

Everything around you will bring you to your knees,
It's not how hard the world hits, 
It's how quick you get back up, how quick you get back up.

I can try to show you what's right and wrong but in the end it's your choice to make.
I can't be there to help you through every mistake, 
I can only show you how I've made it through my own battles and how I've made myself this strong.

You are everything to me,
I would fight through a thousand horrors just to keep you safe.

Everything around you will bring you to your knees,
It's not how hard the world hits, 
It's how quick you get back up.

Everyone around you will lie straight through their teeth, 
You must persevere and make it through your own battles,
and how you make yourself this strong.

You are everything to me,
I would fight through a thousand horrors just to keep you safe.

You are my reason for breathing.
