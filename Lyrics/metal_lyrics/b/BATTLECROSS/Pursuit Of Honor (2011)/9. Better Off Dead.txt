You're an addict and a fool
Nothing but a useless fool
There is not one thing
That would change my mind about you

I want to grab you by the throat
Cut the air and watch you choke
You can only make believe
That I will not destroy you

You're better off dead

I am why you can't sleep at night
I am the end of your life
You have reached your lasting fate
Now you're in hell

I will be the one to destroy you
On your knees begging for my mercy
I will be the one to close your throat
As you take your last breath
I will I will I will take your fucking life
Taking your life

I will piss on the grave
Where they lay you for eternal rest

You're better off dead
