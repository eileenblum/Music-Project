Stretch myself for this dream
Push myself until I bleed
Nothing
Nothing will hold this down
When control breaks amongst ourselves

Fate is nothing when you donât believe
No one will hear if you donât scream
Nothing
Nothing will hold this down
When control breaks amongst ourselves

This is plain black and white
This will never die inside
There is nothing between the lines
This will never die inside

Push
Pull
Destroy
