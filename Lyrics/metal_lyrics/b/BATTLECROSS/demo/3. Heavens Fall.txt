[verse 1]
descending from the sky
soon mankind will die
thundercloud will slay
burns blister gray

[chorus 1]
time of war driven insane
pull the hammer end the pain

[verse 2]
shadows cast the land
mercy-kill the damned
dark consumes the light
take your last breath tonight

[chorus 2]
time of war driven insane
pull the trigger end the pain

[bridge/chorus]
time of war driven insane
pull the pin end the pain

[verse 3]
caged in ice-cold steel
mending all thatâs real
pray to see the end
history repeats again
