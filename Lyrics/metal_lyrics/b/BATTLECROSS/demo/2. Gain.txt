[verse 1]
inside I feel my pride crushing like a whirlwind blow
my heart my soul in the palm of your hands now

[verse 2]
embrace all this passion play feel it getting ripped away
my loss my gain lifeâs no more than a game

[verse 3]
no matter how hard I try to live I will fall along the way
my torn soul dies I am reborn I will stand up again

[verse 4]
this world will be broken down this wall wont be standing tall
never trying is a loss greater than to lose in a struggle you have tried
