So once again we turn the page
Just what have we gained
We have forgotten who we are
Man is forever stained
Forever stained

A binding darkness
Hidden between the lines
Unseen spirits, poisoning the vines
Like parasites, they seek to devour
Eating away at our souls until the final hour

Nocturnal images
Between here and the spirit world unseen
Nocturnal images
A darkness the naked eye can't see

A growing hatred
Driven by design
Once foretold, we're given another sign
The parasites, they will rise to power
Through one man, who will stand in the final hour

Nocturnal images
Demonic images
Nocturnal images
Demonic images

So once again we turn the page
Just what have we gained
We have forgotten who we are
Man is forever stained
