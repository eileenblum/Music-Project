I've been in this hell for much too long; the pain that I feel is much too strong
My soul surrounded by this agony; all I really want is to breathe again

There is no hope inside of me; I want to know the meaning
What it means to be free; can anyone hear my cries
Trapped in this prison made of lies; made of lies

In the darkness I dwell; lost in the sorrow of my hell
In the darkness I dwell; is there anyone, anywhere
Who can save me from myself; save me from myself
Is there anyone out there; who can save me from myself

Long ago when you reached out your hand
You promised me that you would make me understand
With these walls, you've surrounded me
And who I am isn't who I thought I would be
My future written in the sand; this path of misery is more than I can stand
God can you hear me now; god can you save me somehow

In the darkness I dwell; can someone save me from my own hell
In the darkness I dwell; is there anyone, anywhere
Who can save me from you; and save me from myself
Is there anyone out there; who can save me from you

Lost in this silence I've been given here
My mind imprisoned for so many years
Lost for way too long; where do I belong
Brain washed, so much to chip away
I believed in you, your words were never true
At last I see my true awakening

Reborn in agony, will I escape; deceived again and again
I long for answers; finally I can see the truth, you were never
God please remember me; when I sleep forever

In the darkness I dwell; god please lift me from this hell
In the darkness I dwell; is there anyone, anywhere
In the darkness I dwell; I will choose to leave this hell
In the darkness I dwell; I refuse to dwell

Reborn from agony, I have escaped; now I see the true face behind the mask
No more lies, I've opened my eyes; the chains are broken
I will not follow you; because in the darkness you dwell
I will not follow you ; because in the darkness you dwell

There isn't anyone ever again
Who can pull me down to hell
