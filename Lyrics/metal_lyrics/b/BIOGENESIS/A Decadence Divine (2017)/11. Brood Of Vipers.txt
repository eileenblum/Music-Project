It was 1692
They were people just like you
Murder of the innocent
All in the name of god
A mass hysteria
Claiming the lives of your own
Who died and made you god
Pointing fingers from a man made throne

Hang the witch in the name of god
To the gallows, hypocrisy's rod

Brood of vipers; kill for heaven's sake
Brood of vipers; like the venom of the snake
Brood of vipers; drown them in the lake
Brood of vipers; innocence at the stake
Brood of vipers; you brood of vipers

You force them all to see
With your fist of hypocrisy
A pathetic paranoia
All in the name of Christ
20 innocents to their graves
Leaders become the devil's slaves
What part of let he who has no sin
Cast the first stone don't you comprehend

Hang the witch in the name of god
To the gallows, hypocrisy's insanity

Brood of vipers; children of the snake
Brood of vipers; atrocities for heaven's sake
Brood of vipers; your authority is fake
Brood of vipers ; innocent lives that you take
Brood of vipers; you brood of vipers

Interrogation, false prosecution
Liars dominion, execution

Spiritual genocide; breath of life denied
A dark cloud of death over Salem
Christian homicide ; the devil lives inside
Hypocrisy brings death to Salem
Death to the witches of Salem
Death to the witches of Salem
