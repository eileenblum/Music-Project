Now I will introduce myself; I'm known by many names
Lucifer, the devil; I'm the keeper of the games
So if you don't believe I exist; that's OK, I'll keep the beat
The more you roll the dice; the easier you are to defeat

Roll the dice; play your hand
Draw your card; check mate

I'm the voice inside your head; I'll make you think your life's in vain
I'm the author of your sorrow ; I'm the keeper of your pain
I know you think you know it all; but I bet you'll feel the heat
When you look away; you fall victim to my deceit

I bet your soul; bet your soul that you're wrong
What you believe ; what you thought ; that you knew for so long
I bet your soul; bet your soul that you're wrong
You know it all; but there's so much you could never know
What's your move

So now we must conclude this game; and you'll know my claim to fame
I'm the maker of every lie; and I just can't wait for you to die
So if you are satisfied ; and your choices are complete
I will see you in hell; begging at my feet

I bet your soul; bet your soul that you're wrong
What you believe ; what you thought ; that you knew for so long
I bet your soul; bet your soul that you're wrong
You know it all; but there's so much you could never know
What's your move

Just believe the lies I tell
The unseen ones, the angels that fell
Just believe there is no god, just as they tell
I will gladly welcome you to hell
