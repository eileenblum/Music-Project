[originally by Genesis]I must have dreamed a thousand dreams; been haunted by a thousand screams
But I can hear the marching feet; they're moving into the street

Now did you read the news today; they say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight; there burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people; making too many problems
And not much love to around; can't you see this is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in; and there are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying; to make it a place worth living in

Superman where are you now; when everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power; are losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place; so we look for the future
But there's not much love to go around; tell me why this is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in; and these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying; to make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago; when the sun was shining
And the stars were bright, all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight; my generation will put it right
We're not just making promises; that we'll never keep

There's too many men, too many people; making too many problems
And not much love to around; can't you see this is a land of confusion

Now this is the world we live in ;and these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying; to make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in; and these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing; just where our lives are going to
