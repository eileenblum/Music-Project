A fallen world; lost in an age of abominations
The moral decay leads the way; with each generation
With each passing day; we are walking further away
All the while we are leading; the little ones astray
The little ones astray
We are lost in our own grand illusion
Our eyes do not see; our ears do not hear
The warnings or the signs of the conclusion

The lost lead the lost; and we will know the cost
As we ignore the lines in the sand; drawn by his own hand
His command; we have erased the lines in the sand
The lines in the sand
Lines in the sand

A growing rage is setting the stage
For the next wave of deception
A tainted faith opens the gates
For an atheistic agenda
Turning wrong into right
Painting darkness in a heavenly light
Poisoning the well; carving out a pathway to hell
Carving out a pathway to hell

The lost lead the lost; and we will know the cost
As we ignore the lines in the sand; drawn by his own hand
His command; we have erased the lines in the sand
The lines in the sand
Lines in the sand

What have we become

The lines in the sand; his command
We have erased the lines in the sand

The lost lead the lost; and we will know the cost
As we ignore the lines in the sand; drawn by his own hand
His command; we have erased the lines in the sand
The lines in the sand
Lines in the sand
