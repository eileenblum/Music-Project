As he looks upon this corruption; of his own creation
He waits for eyes to see
An atheistic indoctrination
Flows through the veins of our children
Will their eyes ever see; will their eyes ever see
The beast is free to run; as the lies run through our blood
Violence, murder; the devil's gospel has begun

Let the tears of god fall like rain
Let the love in his sorrow heal our pain
Let the tears of god fall on me
Let the tears of god forgive us all

We have become all about ourselves; as the seeds of un-forgiveness grow
And we will know just what we sow
Greed and lust are forever more; history repeats, just like before
Close your eyes and follow me
As the legions lead us into the dark; the mirror's image begins to fade
From behind the mask they will persuade
To gain the world, we lose our souls
As foretold in the ancient scrolls; the gates of hell are open wide

Let the tears of god fall like rain
Let the love in his sorrow heal our pain
Let the tears of god fall on me
Let the tears of god forgive us all

God let us see our reflection in you
Remind us of who we are; made in your image
Show us our reflection in you
God please forgive us; we know not what we do
God please open our hearts; to see your face again
To see your face again; oh god, open our hearts again

A godless age has lead us here
Replaced our faith with primal fear
Suicide, genocide
No purpose to live, no place to hide

Tears of god; tears of god; shatter the facade; tears of god
Tears of god; tears of god; shatter the facade; tears of god
Shatter

Seeds of darkness; breeding hatred; in a world gone wrong
Loss of innocence leads to twisted minds; in the labyrinth of lies

We're running out of time; god please revive our souls
Before it becomes too late; we must and will choose our fate
We will choose our fate
In a world of never ending lies; a smiling face of compromise
In a world of never ending lies; face of compromise
God we need you
