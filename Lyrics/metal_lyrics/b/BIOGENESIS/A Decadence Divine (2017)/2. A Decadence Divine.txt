There will be terrible times in the last days
People will be lovers of themselves
Lovers of money
Boastful, proud, abusive
Disobedient, ungrateful, unholy
Brutal, not lovers of the good
Always learning, but having no knowledge of the truth
Liars

For centuries foretold
A great falling away
A darkness descended
Leading to a slow decay
Beneath the surface
Of an age of technology
A blinding darkness
Hiding in a cloak of beauty

The sight is so fine
Drink from the wine
Of the poison vine
Sit down to dine
Drink from the vine
It's a decadence divine

The lies of generations
Are slowly chipping away
A spiritual war
An Armageddon
The signs are here today
The lost lead by the lost
Their minds controlled by
A godless facade
False wisdom
So-called knowledge
An age of man playing god

Playing god
The sight is so fine
Drink from the wine
Of the poison vine
Sit down to dine
Drink from the vine
It's a decadence divine
