Politics of a heretic, consequence of the unknown
The putrid stench of lies, ascending from the throne
No matter the time, nor the place
It has always been this way
Tell them all what they want to hear
Make the people pay
Dominate and control,the creed is still the same
To suppress your rights is the reason for this game
Rob you of your voice, to suffocate the will
Say what they must, to gain your trust
Go in for the kill

Contriving deception
Seeds of propaganda
Spread like a virus
To breed their agenda

All for one and one for all
Some will never hear the call
All for none and none for all
And the empires fall, fall

Rise up, face it, but will we ever change it
Built on power to control the masses
All through the ages men have ruled with fists of iron
Man then becomes god, and the empires fall
Man becomes god, as the empires fall
Paid with warrior's blood
In the name of a man-made god
A false divinity, a malevolent authority

Follow me, a prevaricating fraud
Through iron and fire
Man becomes god

Pay with your blood
Kneel before your new god
We'll tell you what you believe
No need to think for yourself

All for one and one for all
Some will never hear the call
All for none and none for all
As the empires fall
As the empires fall
