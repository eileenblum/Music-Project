It seems that you were lost
In the darkness of your thoughts
The voices lied to you and you chose to listen
You were caught up in the silence, the pain of the moment
Now that it's all over
It's too late to change your mind
Now that it's all over
It's too late to ask you why

What about the pain you left behind
Did you ever stop to think of this
And what about all the ones who loved you
Who didn't have a chance to say goodbye

You thought you were alone
But you couldn't have been more wrong
You had a beautiful life
You could have chosen to be strong
But now we're left with the pieces
And the painful memories of a life that's lost
So I want to know
We want to know

What about the pain you left behind
Did you ever stop to think of this
And now I know a pain I'd never known
All because of one choice that you made

Caught by a lie
And now you're gone
And for you it's all over
But for me it never dies
Caught by a lie
Now you're gone
And for you it's all over
But for me the pain will never die

The gun you held in your hand
Was never your friend
The pain you felt would have passed
And faded in time
But I will always remember you
I remember you
My friend I'll never forget
But the last choice you made
I'll always regret

What about the pain you left behind
Did you ever stop to think of this
And now I know a pain I've never known
All because of one choice that you made

You chose a lie
For the rest of our lives
We'll be asking why
