This beast has come
It's got a hold on me
It's gripping my throat
Choking me so I can't breathe
It's blinding and blurring my eyes
So I can't see
It's ringing in my ears
So I can't hear myself think

The beast's fire is burning inside of me
I grab your hand through this deceiving desire
I'm the beast inside of me
I'm coming undone, it's controlling me
It's time to lose myself inside your fire
You're the angel too blind to see

This beast is grounding me to the floor
Running towards me
Paralyzing my feet
My heart is caught in this afterlife's door
I can't control it or move
Yet I feel the heat

I'm the beast inside of me
Inside the beast

This beast has me chilled to the bone
I can't resist the suffering you bring
I ache for the touch of your body's wealth
You've given my heart a reason to sting

The beast's fire is burning inside of me
I grab your hand through this deceiving desire
I'm the beast inside of me
I'm coming undone, it's controlling me
It's time to lose myself inside your fire
You're the angel too blind to see
Too blind to see
