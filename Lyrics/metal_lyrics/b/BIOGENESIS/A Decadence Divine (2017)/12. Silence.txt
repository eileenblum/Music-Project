You came to me like an angel of light
So innocent and blameless
Such a beautiful sight
And you were a gift from heaven
A pure and precious life
A love that cannot be broken
With silent words unspoken

The words that you never say
I so long to hear
I long to know the child behind
Behind the silence
The silence

Your laughter, it brings joy to my soul
The breath of life goes through me
A kind of love I've never known
My love for you will always be
My love will never fade away
The embrace will never be broken
But you're priceless words remain unspoken

The words that you've never said
I so long to hear
I long to know the child
The child behind the silence
The silence

I am just an imperfect man
But I will give you the best that I can
I will guide you, and show you
All my love is in your hands
But I want to know the child
Behind the silence
