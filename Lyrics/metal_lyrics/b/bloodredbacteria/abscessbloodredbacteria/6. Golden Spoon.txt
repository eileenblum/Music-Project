I ate the wisdom with a golden spoon
Now as a grown up I'm a soulless toon
Can't get any situation clear
'cause of the screaming voices that I hear

They tell my to rape myself
To hate myself

Get them all wrecked
For your own sake

Get yourself free
Get your instincts back
Get yourself free
Get the voices wrecked
