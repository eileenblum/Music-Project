At 3 we met at playground zero
At 4 we vote the 'climbing hero'
At 5 one of us had left
'cause some steel plugs stickin' in his chest!

At 6 'escaped from playground zero
At 7 someone felt injured evil
At 8 we started way back home
And mom asked 'where are these ulcers from?'

At 9 they checked in hospital
At 10 the whole world knew of them
'cause radioactive rays inside
They caused a million's death that night
