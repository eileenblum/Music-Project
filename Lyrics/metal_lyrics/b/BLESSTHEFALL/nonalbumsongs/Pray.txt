[version from "Black Rose Dying" EP]["Black Rose Dying" version]Now I pray, hearts been slain
Tears come down, I'm broken down

I'm waiting for my life to end
Dear God, please let me leave
Far from home, I'm all alone
This soul is way too deep
I've left behind my happy life
And I'm still asking how I died

Lay down (Now we pray)
Now 
Lay down (Now we pray)
Now

I'm walking through the cold of night
So I can see your face (I can see your face)
At your window I will stand
Your smell I will embrace
My eyes in yours and yours in mine
And now I know just how I died

Lay down (Now we pray)
Now 
Lay down (Let me pray) I pray!
Now (Oh!)

Lay me down (Stand back, get away)
Lay me down (Stand back, get away)
Lay me down (Stand back, get away)
Lay me down (Stand back, get away)
Lay me down (Stand back, get away)
Lay me down (Stand back, get away)

Lay down
Pray now
Lay down
Now pray now
