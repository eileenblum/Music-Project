I felt so anxious, for what we had in store,
But then you took that away
For all your dreams and desires
That I couldn't provide
I've got my hopes I'm a fighter

I won't answer what you need answered
I won't say a word (I won't say a word)
And I won't say a word (I won't say anything)
Bury me in ecstasy and take the pain away

Oh, you've gotta be kidding me [x4]

I won't answer what you need answered (it's so unfair)
I won't say a word (I won't say a word)
And I won't say a word (I won't say anything)
Bury me in ecstasy and take the pain away

I'm just selfish!

I won't retreat [x4]
