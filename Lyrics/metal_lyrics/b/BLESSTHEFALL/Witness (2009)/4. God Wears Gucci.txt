Take cover, run for your life
Cause Iâd rather die than let you get away
Get away from me

Run, take cover and save yourself
It's ok you'll be going under

Fall to your knees, is what you told to me
How can I believe? When you live a lie
Lie to my face, it's nothing new to me

This is going too far
You let them in on your secrets
And they're not following, not following
Now the best part is over
I hope you savored the taste

You think you'll save us with your false impressions
You think it's working but you won't change me

Fall to your knees, is what you told me
How can I believe? When you live a lie
Lie to my face, it's nothing new to me

Fall to your knees, Fall to your knees
Lie to my face, it's nothing new to me...

Your time is running out
You should have known better
Only you can save you now
But you won't remember 
[x3]

But you won't remember
You should have known better
So who's going to save you now?

"Girl: Hey Beau, you are a f**king liar, you are worthless, 
I never want to ever talk to you or see you again, so go f**k yourself, f**k you"
