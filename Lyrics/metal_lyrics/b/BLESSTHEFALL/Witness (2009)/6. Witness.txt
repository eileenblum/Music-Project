Look into my eyes
Tell me your alive

Look into my eyes
Can you hear me now?

Can you hear us now?
Speaking the words that will never cross your mind.

Can you see us now? 
Hope you found a place to bury the bodies
and you can't live without it.

I'm in your head 
I won't forget.
Your love is dead and you got nothing left.
Your promises have all been broken.
Sorry to say were so better off.
Sorry to say you're not.

Can you hear us now? 
Speaking the words that will never cross your mind.

Can you see us now?
Hope you found a place to bury the bodies
and you can't live without it.
And you can't breathe without it.
And you can't live without it.

Don't try so hard we see right through you.
Your a liar you don't need to breathe.
You said, you said, you said we're done.

Can you hear us now? 
Speaking the words that will never cross your mind.

Can you see us now?
Hope you found a place to bury the bodies
and you can't live without it.
And you can't breathe without it.
And you can't live without it.
