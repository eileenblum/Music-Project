Your choking on all your regrets
This world is cold and its just getting colder
Before you end this all
Reach inside for something more

Time makes it hard to breathe
But I'll live to see another day
And I'll stay strong
And this life is mine and I won't break
And I won't break
And I won't break

"Even God won't save you now 
'cause they're coming after you"
But they won't ever catch me

Time makes it hard to breathe
But I'll live to see another day
And I'll stay strong
And this life is mine and I won't break

I won't break, I won't break
'Cause this life is mine and I won't break

There's places I have been no one should ever go.
There's things that I have seen no one should ever know.
There's places I have been no one should ever go.
There's things that I have done no one should ever know.

So where do we run?
And how do we trust?
When the walls are closing in
And where do you turn and who do you trust?
When the walls are closing in
Closing in, closing in

No, this isn't the end
This isn't the end
This isn't the end
This isn't the end
