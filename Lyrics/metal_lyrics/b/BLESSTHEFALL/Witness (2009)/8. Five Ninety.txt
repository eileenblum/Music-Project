Keep all the memories (all that means to me)
Close to you
Keep all the memories (all that means to me)
Close to you

It so hard for me to let go of you
But I'm coming back, I'm coming back
And you are the reason that I've been waiting for

She said I'm going quickly
It's getting harder to keep my head above
I've never known all the answers (never)
But I'll find a way, I'll find a way. Don't forget.

It so hard for me to let go of you
But I'm coming back, I'm coming back
And you are the reason that I've been waiting for

This road is getting darker (darker)
You've been dying to find your inspiration
Don't leave me, let me find a way
Don't let go, we'll find a way

It so hard for me to let go of you
But I'm coming back, I'm coming back
And you are the reason that I've been waiting for
(that I've waiting for)

Keep all the memories (all that means to me)
Close to you

It so hard for me to let go of you (you, you)
And you are the reason (the reason)
That I've been waiting for
But I'm coming back (Coming Back)
'cause you are the one that I've been waiting for
(that I've been waiting for)
