Let the light shine in
Because we are not alone
We are not alone
Let the light shine in
Because we are not alone
We are not alone

We will tear away, we will tear away 
This awful feeling lets start the bleeding
We will rip away, we will rip away
All of your doubts this will be the last time that

You ever gonna hurt again 
I'll never sing this song without you (without you)
Remember the way that it felt
You never gonna hurt again 
I'll never sing this song
Remember the day
Remember

Hide your makeshift hearts
We're taking aim, we're taking aim
And we won't be leaving
Hide your makeshift hearts
We're taking aim (taking aim)
And we won't be leaving

We will tear away, we will tear away 
This awful feeling lets start the bleeding
We will rip away, we will rip away
All of your doubts this will be the last time that

You ever gonna hurt again 
I'll never sing this song without you (without you) 
Remember the way that it felt
You never gonna hurt again 
I'll never sing this song
Remember the day
Remember

Let your line shine in tonight, tonight, tonight.

All alone is where we've been before.
All alone is where we started
All alone is where we've been before.
All alone is where we started
All alone is where we've been before.
All alone is where we started
All alone is where we've been before.
All alone is where we started

We'll be testing the martyrs 
(We'll be testing the martyrs)
and bringing hell and high waters
(and bringing hell and high waters)
And we'll be testing the martyrs 
(We'll be testing the martyrs)
and bringing hell and high waters
(and bringing hell and high waters)
