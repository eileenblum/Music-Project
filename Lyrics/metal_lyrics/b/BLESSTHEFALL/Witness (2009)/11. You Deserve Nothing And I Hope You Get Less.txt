Oh!

So where's the one you've been speaking of.
Is he hiding somewhere or just inside your head?

You've built this prison by yourself

I can see you falling in front of me
And don't make it so easy.
I can see you're not getting anywhere.
So pretend this was never yours

Now you'll suffer, you'll suffer just like us, so 
Don't tell me, don't tell me where we go from here
Waiting for your final answer
Just give it up, just burn in hell

You've built this prison by yourself

I can see you falling in front of me
And don't make it so easy.
I can see you're not getting anywhere.
So pretend this was never yours
I can see you falling in front of me
You're making it easy

You've built this prison by yourself
Dug this grave with your own hands
Pretend this was never yours
I love the way you lose yourself
It makes it easy to forget you
Pretend this was never yours

I can see you falling in front of me
And don't make it so easy
I can see you're not getting anywhere
So pretend this was never yours
I can see you falling in front of me
You're making it easy

And you're not getting anywhere
And you're not getting anywhere with me
