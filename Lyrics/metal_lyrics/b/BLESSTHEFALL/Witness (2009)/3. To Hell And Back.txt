YEAH!

I'm leaving the same way I came in
Looking forward but I can't see straight
It's just like I know where I'm going
It's just like me to fool myself
I'm right here bitch
Buried by the words of a liar
I'm right here... bitch
But I'm alive and I'm still breathing (yeah)
That day becomes so haunting
You didn't say enough, we were mistaken
My mind plays it over and over

Slow motion
But we're moving faster, moving faster
So much further
Let's not lose control
Light a match just to watch it burn
Struck
Light a match just to watch you burn
Where are you going? How far?
Where are you going?
Let's give them HELL!

That day becomes so haunting
You didn't say enough, we were mistaken
My mind plays it over and over

Slow motion
But we're moving faster, moving faster
So much further
Let's not lose control
I'll bite the bullet
Just to save myself... Oh!
Oh no, this ship is quickly sinking
We gotta take control, gotta take control
Oh no, this ship is quickly sinking
We gotta take control, gotta take control

Slow motion
Now we're moving faster, moving faster
So much further
Now we're moving faster
I'll bite the bullet
