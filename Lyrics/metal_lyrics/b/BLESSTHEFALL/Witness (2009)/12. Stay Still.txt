Tonight is gone they'll tell you it's your time
But I won't let them take you from me.
And I never gave up on you.
We all feel the same.
(Can't stop this suffering in, in my head)
Can't turn this one around

If I could pull you from the wreckage.
We'd be alright.
Oh Lord, don't tell me this is happening.
If I could hold you for a second
We'd be alright.
Oh Lord, don't tell me this is happening

So when, does it start getting better.
So far from home.
The lights are fading out
So just Leave this all behind

If I could pull you from the wreckage.
We'd be alright.
Oh Lord, don't tell me this is happening.
If I could hold you for a second
We'd be alright.
Oh Lord, don't tell me this is happening

Oh, I never should have let you go.
And take me with you.
I'm dying on my own.

If I could pull you from the wreckage.
We'd be alright.
Oh Lord, don't tell me this is happening.
If I could hold you for a second
We'd be alright.
Oh Lord, don't tell me this is happening

And I know I'm not the only one
Don't tell me this is happening
And I know I'm not the only one.
Don't tell me this is happening
Don't tell me this is happening
