Keep moving down the line,
Whatâs sitting here is mine.
Youâve taken far too long,
Go back where you belong.
This place is not for the weak,
This place is not for the weak.

Theyâve all been begging for the truth
Itâs over now (itâs over now)

We gave our lives for this
Itâs all we have
Itâs all weâll ever know
We sacrificed for this.
When itâs said and done,
Weâll have the scars to show,
Weâll have the scars to show.

I am destruction,
Youâll never be the death of me.
You are deception,
I am the one that you betray.

We gave our lives for this,
Itâs all we have,
Itâs all weâll ever know.
We sacrificed for this,
When itâs said and done.
Weâll have the scars to show.
Weâll have the scars to show.
From now âtill the end.
From now until the end.

Itâs set in stone,
Now thereâs no turning back.
Weâll stand our ground.
We are unbroken!

Itâs set in stone,
Now thereâs no turning back.
Weâll stand our ground.
We are unbroken!
Itâs set in stone,
Now thereâs no turning back.
Weâll stand our ground.
We are unbroken!

We are unbroken!
We are unbroken!
We are unbroken!
