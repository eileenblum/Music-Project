I swear that this time it's real
I promise that I will keep true
My heart belongs to you

So let your love reign in my hallow land
Been waiting all my life to feel this, make me whole again
Just try and save me, just hold me in your hands
Been waiting all my life to feel this, make me whole again

All the time we spent just breaking out of this
we made it out
We are the ones with hearts of gold
I'm still the kid you used to know and I've got a lot to say
Make me the light for the rest of the world

You pulled me from my hell
You saved me from myself
and now this is who I am
at the end of the road
