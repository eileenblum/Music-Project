We won't fall when we're under the gun
When all your heroes have failed you

You'll never show your face, you are a coward
We'll never let you win ever again, never again
Preach your "gospel" 
Choke on your fortune and glory

No matter what they say we're not the ones who lost our way
We're fighting for our lives
It's not enough to say that we were the ones  who lost our way
We're fighting for our lives

All you built is in ruins
All you loved has been destroyed

and now's the time you'll be forgotten 
and now's the time, your time to be 
Forgotten under when walls crash down around you
