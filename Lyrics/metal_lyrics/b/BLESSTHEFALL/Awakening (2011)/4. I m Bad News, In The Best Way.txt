Tell me, what did you think when you found me lost 
and my hope was fading
Tell me, what did you say to make me feel again
your voice could take me
Don't let the darkness surround me
lift me up, I'll let you in

I said I'm sorry and I won't forget the past regrets
and now that's over
I said I'm sorry you're my only one the past is gone
and all that's over, not losing you

Please take me home, stay with me tonight
Please take me home, I'm not losing you
I said that you are the one for me
