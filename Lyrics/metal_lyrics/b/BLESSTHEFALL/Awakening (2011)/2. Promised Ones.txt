Watch as we start again
A different chapter now
So welcome to our fight
There will be blood
There will be blood

No one can take this from us
I taste the end, itâs so close
There will be blood
There will be blood on our hands

We are the promised ones
And nothingâs in our way
They can try
But theyâll never stop us
Tell all our enemies
Weâre ready for the war
Weâve been here and weâll never die
Now they have nowhere to go

And now weâve come too far
To give it all away
So welcome to our lives
There will be blood
There will be blood

Weâll brave this storm together
I taste the end, itâs so close
There will be blood
There will be blood on our hands

(You are nothing)
There will be blood
(You are nothing like us)
There will be blood on our hands

We are the promised ones
And nothingâs in our way
They can try
But theyâll never stop us
Tell all our enemies
Weâre ready for the war
Weâve been here and weâll never die
Now they have nowhere to go

Weâll meet you on the front lines
We have nothing to lose
Weâll meet you on the front lines
We have nothing to lose

Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose

Donât you know
We are the promised ones
And nothingâs in our way
They can try
But theyâll never stop us
Tell all our enemies
Weâre ready for the war
Weâve been here and weâll never die
Weâll never die
