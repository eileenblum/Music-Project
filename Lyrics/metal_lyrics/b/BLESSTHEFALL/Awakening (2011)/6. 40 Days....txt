Let's start at one, and count the days.
Let's hope to God that time flies like they say.
Cause this instance,
can distance my heart from yours tonight.
But I'm wide awake now,
and I'm holding your picture.

It's so cold here.
without you, without you.

And I need you now, cause its killing me.
And I wish somehow, you were here with me.

When I fall asleep, I feel you with me.
Till I fall asleep, and you are with me.

Could this be more,
I've been up all night, riding subway lines.
Now we're sleepin on your floor.

Can we make this a lifetime, you're all I want right now
Life keeps tellin me I need to go,
But what if I wanna stay.
Cause I'm lost here without you, without you.

And I need you now, cause it's killin me.
And I wish somehow, you were here with me.

When I fall asleep, I feel you with me.
Till I fall asleep, and you are with me

I've found a love I never had before you changed me,
And I will wait however long it takes.
You changed me.

You say the words, that I've been thinking
I'll never let you go.

And I need you now, cause it's killing me
And I wish somehow, you were here with me

When I fall asleep,I feel you with me
Till I fall asleep, and you are with me

You changed me.
You changed me.
