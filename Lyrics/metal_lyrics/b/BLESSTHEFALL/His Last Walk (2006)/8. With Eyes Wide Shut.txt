I know I'm not there to hold you 
Look up see the sky that I do 
You make me the happiest of men 
I am the happiest of men 

And if god takes me before you 
I just want you to know I love you 
And you made me the strongest of all men 
I'll remain the happiest of men 

(The happiest, the happiest, the happiest of men) [repeated]

You made me the strongest of men 
I'll remain the happiest of men 

I miss you 
Baby close your eyes 
Let's meet 
In our dreams tonight
