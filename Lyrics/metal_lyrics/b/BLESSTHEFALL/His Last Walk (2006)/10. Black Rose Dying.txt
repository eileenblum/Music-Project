Gouge out your eyes, pull your heart to the floor
With my heart, my skin, my kiss
Stand back, drop to your knees, I'll stand back as you bleed 
With my heart, my skin, my kiss

This blade it feels so cold, baby hold me while, I'm shaking,
This knife has pierced my soul, I sit alone while, I'm shaking
And yes I'll laugh out loud, with blind eyes, I'm shaking...

Gouge out your eyes, pull your heart to the floor
Sweetness loves me, tastes me, hears me
Stand back, drop to your knees, I'll stand back as you bleed
Sweetness loves me, tastes me, hears me...

This blade it feels so cold, baby hold me while, I'm shaking,
This knife has pierced my soul, I sit alone while, I'm shaking,
And yes I'll laugh out loud, with blind eyes I'm shaking...

Take me out of this place... 
Take me out of this place...
Out, take me out, take me out, take me... out
Out, take me out, take me out, take me out...
Take me, take me, take me... out

Gouge out your eyes, pull your heart to the floor until you hold me
With my heart, my skin, my kiss
Stand back, drop to your knees, I'll stand back as you bleed
Sweetness, sweetness
As I am, as I am, as I am, as I am
Sweetness, sweetness
Come on

Gouge out your eyes, pull your heart to the floor
With my heart, my skin, my kiss
Stand back, drop to your knees, I'll stand back as you bleed
Sweetness loves me, tastes me, hears me

Wait for them to come on in and take you, away from me again
Wait for them to come on in and take you, black rose dying
