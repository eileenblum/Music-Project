You scream don't look, you scream don't shout 
What have they done? What have I not? 
And every time I think about your voice I 
Start to tremble, and my throats aching 
And anytime you need a shoulder, I'm right there 
You just gotta find a way. A way!

She sits alone and tries to adjust 
She cries please let me go I won't tell anyone 
You scream don't look, oh please god don't shout 

You scream don't look, you scream don't shout 
What have they done? What have I not? 
And every time I think about your voice I 
Start to tremble, and my throats aching 
And anytime you need a shoulder, I'm right there 
You just gotta find a way. 

Oh god please help us, get her out of this
Oh god please help us, get her out of this
Oh god
Oh god
