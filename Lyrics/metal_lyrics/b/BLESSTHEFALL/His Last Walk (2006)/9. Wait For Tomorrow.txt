They say that I can change without you
That I can change without you
That I can change without you

Those nights I can't sleep. 
I'm stuck here. 
Lost in your dreams. 
I'm stuck in here. 

Like why can't I get much better? 
Like why can't I get much better? 

So swipe it and take it away 
And never lie to me (never lie to me)
So swipe it and take it away
And never lie to me (never lie to me)

The only reason my eyes close
Is so they open with you by my side. 

Like why can't I get much better? 
Like why can't I get much better? 

So swipe it and take it away 
And never lie to me (never lie to me)
So swipe it and take it away
And never lie to me (never lie to me)

And never lie
I won't never lie
I won't, wait for
wait for, wait for
I won't, wait for
wait for, wait for
I won't, wait for you
wait for you
I won't, wait for you
won't wait for tomorrow

So open your eyes my darling. 
Today's a new day it's like why can't I..

Like why can't I get much better
Like why can't I get much better
Like why can't I
Like why can't I
Get better...
