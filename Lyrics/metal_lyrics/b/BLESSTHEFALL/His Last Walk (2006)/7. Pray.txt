she's pulling out her eyelashes, from pain she bares 
now far from home i'm all alone this whole is way too deep 
and i've left behind my happy life, and i'm still asking how i died 
lay down, pray now 
i'm walking through the cold of night so i can see your face 
at your window i will stand, your smell i will embrace 
my eyes in yours and yours in mine and now i know just how i died 
as fire falls i've never made life before, i've never had this before
