Turn me on, let me feel you 
Turn me on, let me taste you 
Boundaries are starting to fall 
Conceiving has already started 
Kissing, caressing, indulge 
Is this really what you wanted? 

No, I just don't know 
If I can 
No, I just don't know 
If I can 
Is this really what you wanted? 
Is this really what you, yeah 

Even though, I don't know you 
I know for sure, I love you 
Anything that you'll ever need 
I'll try my best, to give everything 

I tell myself its nothing 
I tell myself its nothing, almost nothing 

Close your eyes, and take my hand 
We will rise, once again 
Close your eyes, and take his hand 
We'll be home, once again 
That's my father
