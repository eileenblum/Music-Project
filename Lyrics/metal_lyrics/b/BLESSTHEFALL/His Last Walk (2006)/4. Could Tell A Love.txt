Well here go
My big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love
And my heart and my blood
We'll make it out

Can I stand with the weight of the world? [x3] 
Here I stand with the weight of the world

And this is all I've got
I'll make it now or not
It's made up of my love 
I've fought so hard to fade
Our lives are meant to make
It's made up of my love
Made up of my love
That's how it goes, it goes

Well here go
My big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love
And my heart and my blood
We'll make it out

I won't fall down
My heart still pounds 
I'm breathing now
I won't fall down
[x4]

Well here go
My big plans
To build up this fortress into the clouds
It's made up of my love
And my blood and my heart
We'll make it out
We'll make it out
We'll make it out
We'll make it out
We'll make it out

We'll make it, our love out
You're not the only one
