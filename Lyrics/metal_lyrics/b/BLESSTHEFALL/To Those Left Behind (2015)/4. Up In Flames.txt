You always took me for granted
And never gave me a reason why
You left me stranded feeling worthless
Now all I see is death in your eyes
All I see is death in your eyes

If you're counting all my sins
Hope they all add up so pull the pin
Watch it all go up in flames
Watch it all go up in flames

Don't drag me through your nightmare
Don't tear apart what I am
You've got your demons, they parallel mine
You're not the victim, you're my parasite

You're not the only one
How could you be so selfish?
You never lie, you'll never see the truth
Your body's rising from ashes

If you want to point the blame
Hope you marked your words, you're not a saint
Watch it all go up in flames
Watch you all go up in flames

Don't drag me through your nightmare
Don't tear apart what I am
You've got your demons, they parallel mine
You're not the victim, you're my parasite
Don't drag me through your nightmare
Don't tear apart what I am
You've got your demons, they parallel mine
You're not the victim, you're my parasite

if you miss it
where you can see the parasite
never give up
we can learn to leave the past behind
so if you miss it
where you can read between the lines
if there's no walls
well never find whats inside

Don't drag me through your nightmare
Don't tear apart what I am
You've got your demons, they parallel mine
You're not the victim, you're my parasite

Parasite
You've got your demons, they parallel mine
You're not the victim, you're my parasite
You're my parasite
You'll never find what you lost inside
