Take back all the years that we've wasted
Your face hasn't changed
But you've become what we hated
What happened to us versus them?
Our worlds are divided
I'll never give in

It's too it late to turn it around
How can you live with yourself?
Your loyalty can't be found
How can you live with yourself?

In time
Their thoughts will fade
Their words won't mean
What we want them to say
Inside we watched them be
The enemy
That I thought that they'd never be

I took the fall for all your decisions
You call this love?
I call it blind ambition
You've turned all your diamonds to dust
I've tried so hard
But it wasn't enough

It's too it late to turn it around
How can you live with yourself?
Your loyalty can't be found
How can you live with yourself?

In time
Their thoughts will fade
Their words won't mean
What we want them to say
Inside we watched them be
The enemy
That I thought that they'd never be
Fighting in cycles
Living in shadows
Inside we watched them be
The enemy
That I thought that they'd never be

I would have given my life for you
But the path that you've chosen
Has fucked everything
You fucked everything

Take back all the years that we've wasted
Your face hasn't changed
But you've become what we hated
Take back all the time that we've lost
I've tried so hard
But it was never enough

In time
Their thoughts will fade
Their words won't mean
What we want them to say
Inside we watched them be
The enemy
That I thought that they'd never be
Fighting in cycles
Living in shadows
I
