Father, don't cry
It's not so bad here
I'm doing this all on my own
Everyone else keeps passing me by
I float through this place all alone

I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way

Revisiting this old familiar place
Just to see if you could find a trace
It's time to say goodbye
At least you have to try
For me

Waiting
Wasting
Away without you here
I'll come around just give me a reason
Drifting
Sinking
Searching for a way
To reach out and pull you close

I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way

I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way

Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me

Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me

Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me

Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait
Don't wait for me

Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me

Don't you cry now
Go to sleep
Dry your eyes
Don't wait for me

I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way

I know it doesn't seem like you'll recover
Suffering that never goes away
But I'm here with you
So carry me through
Use me as a light to guide your way
