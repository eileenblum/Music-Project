Sever the ties or it's all for nothing

Without a warning out of site
All these thoughts keep plaguing my mind
You saw this coming, you're out of time
So you can rot with the ones left behind

Nowhere to run, had this feeling
Right from the start
Another lie that I could not forgive
And now the rope's around your neck
Well it never was, yeah it never was
Well I hope you're good at starting over
Yeah it never was
And it never is going be

You act like nobody knows
If you're not at fault
Then who is in control?
Don't try to put this on me
Burn your bridges
Buried beneath
This can't be all for nothing
Sever the ties or it's all for nothing

Nowhere to run, had this feeling
Right from the start
Another lie that I could not forgive
And now the rope's around your neck
Well it never was, yeah it never was
Well I hope you're good at starting over
Yeah it never was
And it never is going be

One by one
You reap what you sew
The thought of revenge is all that I know
One by one
You reap what you sew
I'm calling you out
Just to watch you choke

One by one
The thought of revenge is all that I know
One by one
I'm calling you out
Just to watch you choke

Nowhere to run
Had this feeling
Right from the start
Another lie that I could not forgive
And now the rope's around your neck
Well it never was, yeah it never was
Well I hope you're good at starting over
Yeah it never was
And it never is going be
Well it never was, yeah it never was
Well I hope you're good at starting over
Yeah it never was
And it never is going be

This can't be all for nothing!
