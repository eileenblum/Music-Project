Where is the life within us?
Buried inside
Where is the light that blinds us?
Buried alive not ready to die
Go!

You found me at my worst
When I was far too weak to grow
Speaking all your shallow words
And always casting the first stone
In spite of all my fears
And how I may have lost my way
Only now I know the truth
You tried to suffocate me
Suffocate me
Look at what we've become
Suffocate me
Buried alive not ready to die

Awake and coming clean

If you can't sleep
It's your conscience
That's eating away
At the mess you made
So let's end this
Sew this last stitch
Lift this weight off my chest
I'll put you to rest
The past should stay dead

How did we find ourselves here?
Haunted by our own design
With everything that's come to pass
Makes it harder to confine
Reach up with open hands
Nobody left to pull me through
And if I lose my grief
Still better off without you

If you can't sleep
It's your conscience
That's eating away
At the mess you made
So let's end this
Sew this last stitch
Lift this weight off my chest
I'll put you to rest

If you can't sleep
It's your conscience
That's eating away
At the mess you made
The past should stay dead

You're like a cancer living inside of me
I feel the pressure it's getting harder to breathe
You're like a cancer living inside of me
I feel the pressure it's getting harder to breathe

You're like a cancer living inside of me
If you can't sleep
It's your conscience
You're like a cancer living inside of me
