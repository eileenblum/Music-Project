I hear your voice inside my head
Like a ghost returning
Got you on my mind
Well my eyes are not the same
When you're nowhere near me
Always on my mind

I try to tell myself
That I'll see you again
Try to understand
Why I still pretend
So I lie awake
Waiting for the day
You'll need me

The times we had
The moment's passed

I try to tell myself
That I'll see you again
Try to understand
Why I still pretend

I try to tell myself
That I'll see you again
Try to understand
Why I still pretend
So I lie awake
Waiting for the day
You'll need me

I try to tell myself
That I'll see you again
Try to understand
Why I still pretend
So I lie awake
Waiting for the day
You'll need me
