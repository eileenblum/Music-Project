Weâre reading psalms to the dead
Lighting candles to make amends
For a voice never to speak again
Six feet under for what never shouldâve been

Stop living like you walk on water
Looking down on all those left to drown
Stop living like you walk on water
Looking down on all those left to drown

And you know I couldn't find the words before
Only if I had another day left here
Iâd tell you, I'd tell you
If I had another day to try to take away your pain
Now you're so far out of reach
Itâs a lesson you can't teach

You love and you lose
I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach
You love and you lose
I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach

Iâve seen the scars youâve tried to hide
Searching for answers when you look to the sky
Say Iâm liar, say Iâm a fake
Iâm far from a saint
So Iâll live with my mistakes

If I'm a liar, if I'm a fake
Iâll take all these sins
And you can burn me at the stake
Iâll take all these sins
And you can burn me at the stake

And you know I couldn't find the words before
Only if I had another day left here
Iâd tell you, I'd tell you
If I had another day to try to take away your pain
Now you're so far out of reach
Itâs a lesson you can't teach

You love and you lose
I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach
You love and you lose
I wish that you know
That it's just a lesson you can't teach

Son of God, are you listening?
Son of God, can you hear my cry?
We put our faith into you
How could you just watch them die?
Son of God, are you listening?
Son of God, can you hear my cry?
We put our faith into you
How could you just watch us die?
