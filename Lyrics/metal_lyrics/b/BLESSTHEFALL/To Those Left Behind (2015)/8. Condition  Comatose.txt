Angels keep coming after me
Chalk outlines they captivate
Comatose concrete
Stole my hopes and dreams
It's getting hard to sink
When you're six feet deep

Am I dying?
Floating above my body
Armageddon running through my veins
I never wanted it to end this way
Dying
Floating above my body
I wish that I could numb this pain
We live and then we medicate

Hold me so close
Don't let me drift away
My whole world slips
Right out from under me

Comatose concrete
Stole my hopes and dreams
It's getting hard to sink
When you're six feet deep

Am I dying?
Floating above my body
Armageddon running through my veins
I never wanted it to end this way
Dying
Floating above my body
I wish that I could numb this pain
We live and then we medicate

Clarity
Is missing from everything
The fear that's inside of me
Pulling like tidal waves
Clarity
Is missing from everything
The fear that's inside of me
Pulling like tidal waves

Angels keep coming after me
Chalk outlines they captivate

Am I dying?
Floating above my body
Armageddon running through my veins
I never wanted it to end this way
Dying
Floating above my body
I wish that I could numb this pain
We live and then we medicate
