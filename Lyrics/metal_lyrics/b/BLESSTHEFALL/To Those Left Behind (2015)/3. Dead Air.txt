So long, this is harder than you know
But we'll remember everything
It's tough to let it go

Think of the nights we spent
When we were not alone
They remember everything
It's tough to let it go

Here we are again, falling for it
Here we are again and we're falling for it

You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go?

Now all that we have left
Are cemetery sites
Monuments of memories
To those we left behind

Here we are again and we're falling for it

You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go wrong
You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go wrong

So long, this is harder than you know
But we'll remember everything
It's tough to let it go
Here we are again, again

You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go wrong
You won't find me there
Cause I'm already gone
Looking for what's left to hang on
Where did we go wrong
