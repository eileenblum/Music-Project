How will I find the strength?
To make it out when you're pulling me under
How can I make them see?
You're so worthless to me
Recognize what lies before me
I will stare death in the face
Recognize what lies before me
I'll stand against the waves

So talk all you want
You can't see us
But we're at the top now
Never lost our way
Can't break our stride
You don't have what it takes

We hold our own
On our own
Still undefeated

I know it's hard to stay true
With vultures pulling at you
But if it's all the same
They'll find the worst in you
If we can take what we know
And give them somewhere to go
So if it's all the same
They'll find the worst in you

I won't be used
I refuse to be
I refuse to be misled
All the bullshit I've been fed
You're worthless to me

Don't count us out
The more you push only fuels the fire
We've paid the price
We're taking back
What you took away

We hold our own
On our own
Still undefeated

I know it's hard to stay true
With vultures pulling at you
But if it's all the same
They'll find the worst in you
If we can take what we know
And give them somewhere to go
So if it's all the same
They'll find the worst in you

Nothing can last forever
I won't let you tell me how to live my life
You can't control me
I won't let you tell me how to live my life
You'll never bring me down

I know it's hard to stay true
With vultures pulling at you
But if it's all the same
They'll find the worst in you
I know it's hard to stay true
With vultures pulling at you
But if it's all the same
They'll find the worst in you
I
