Wake up
Do I need these things that I'm asking for
So I'll give up
And turn in the dreams that I've been sold
You'll never know
The lines that were crossed
Just to make it home
So I'll cover up
The fear that I'm not there for anybody

Wish I was getting used to this
Every chance I get I let it go
Every moment spent is not enough
Wish I was getting used to all of this

I'm looking down from the edge
And would I do it again?
Would I trade the world that I know now
For a day that I don't miss you
I'm looking down from the edge
And would I do it again?
But it's getting hard to understand
Why I'm wide awake but barely breathing

I've spent all my energy
Justifying my failures at close range
Every chance I get I let it go
Every moment spent is not enough
Pull the trigger, I've been such a waste
Neglecting life and love it's one in the same thing
Every chance I get I let it go
Every moment spent is not enough

Wish I was getting used to all of this

I'm looking down from the edge
And would I do it again?
Would I trade the world that I know now
For a day that I don't miss you
I'm looking down from the edge
And would I do it again?
But it's getting hard to understand
Why I'm wide awake but barely breathing

I know I've got too much to lose
For me to turn my back on you
The writings on the wall
We were meant to fall
Don't regret the life we chose

Looking down from the edge
Would I do it again?
I'm looking down from the edge

I'm looking down from the edge
And would I do it again?
Would I trade the world that I know now
For a day that I don't miss you
I'm looking down from the edge
And would I do it again?
But it's getting hard to understand
Why I'm wide awake but barely breathing
