[feat. Lights]Love like a storm, like an ocean, endless
Love like a fire, like the world is burning
Shouldâve known better, shouldâve known better
But you see through all the lines and then
Prove Iâm not like all of them
Shouldâve known better, shouldâve known better
(Ooo, ahh)

If your love is just a dream, donât wake me up
Itâs hard enough to face the world alone
If your love is just a dream, donât wake me up
Itâs hard enough to face the world alone

You are the one I waited for, I knew it all along
(Knew it all along)
You are the one Iâm fighting for, I knew it all along

Love like a dream, like youâre never waking
Love like your last, like the sky is falling
Shouldâve known better, shouldâve known better
But you see through all the lines and then
Prove Iâm not like all of them
Shouldâve known better, shouldâve known better
(Ooo, ahh)

You are the one I waited for, I knew it all along
(Knew it all along)
You are the one Iâm fighting for, I knew it all along

Sing me something thatâll bring me to my knees
Thatâll put my mind at ease
Please tell me anything
We can build this like a dream
Letâs make believe, just you and me [x2]

If your love is like a dream, donât wake me up
Itâs hard enough to face the world alone
If this love is just a dream, donât wake me up
Itâs hard enough to face the world alone

If your heart stops beating, God rest my soul
Dig this grave for two, canât live without you
Itâs hard enough to face the world alone
If your heart stops beating, God rest my soul
Dig this grave for two, canât live without you
Itâs hard enough to face the world alone

You are the one I waited for, I knew it all along.
