There is a devil inside, staring out of her decay
She's left trying to turn it around, in search of clarity
I watched her from the surface, she's buried everything.
There is a devil inside trying to find its way out

Follow me, I feel like I can show you.
Give it up, put your faith in me.
Take your life in a new direction.

Follow me, I feel like I can show you.
Give it up, put your faith in me.
Take it all in a new direction.
Follow me, I feel like I can show you.
Give it up, put your faith in me.
Take your life in a new direction.

There is a devil inside, staring out of her decay
I can't keep looking down when it's right in front of me
I see you losing yourself again, don't let them in
I see you killing yourself again, the victim is you
The victim is you

Follow me, I feel like I can show you.
Give it up, put your faith in me.
Take it all in a new direction.
Follow me, I feel like I can show you.
Give it up, put your faith in me.
Take your life in a new direction.

She said, "I'm finally through the fog
And now I'm wide awake.
Feels like I've been gone for so long."
Give it up, put your faith in me.
Take your life in a new direction now,
New direction

You will burn! You will burn!

(You will burn! You will burn!)
I'm standing on the ashes of what you built for me
I'm standing on the ashes of what you built for me

I'll watch her ignite the flame, I'll watch her burn
I'll watch it incinerate, she's lost all faith in you

She's lost all faith in you
