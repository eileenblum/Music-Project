[feat. Jake Luhrs Of August Burns Red]Your pessimism is drowning me out.
I keep on screaming but you're holding me under!
I tried so hard to get it through to you.
You think you're better than everyone else.

Don't act so desperate.
It's time to get over yourself,
it's time to get yourself,
and you look so miserable.
It's time to get over yourself,
it's time to get over yourself!

You're not worth my time,
you're so full of shit.
Don't go running your mouth again!
I caught you lying to them,
I caught you playing with fire!
Don't go searching for sympathy.
I caught you looking at them,
I caught you playing with fire!
You'll get nothing from me.

Don't act so desperate.
It's time to get over yourself.
And when you reach,
reach for me
you know that someday
I will carry on.
And when you fall,
fall away you know
that someday
I will carry on.
I'll carry on.

Don't go running your mouth again!
I caught you lying to them,
I caught you playing with fire!
Don't go searching for sympathy.
I caught you looking at them,
I caught you playing with fire!

And when you reach,
reach for me
you know that someday
I will carry on.

And when you reach,
reach for me
you know that someday
I will carry on.
And when you fall,
fall away
you know that someday
I will carry on.
I'll carry on.

Don't go running your mouth again!
Don't go running your mouth again!
