I'm looking past the water, as far as I can see,
These mistakes that I've made are staring back at me.
So I'm ending where I started, I'm sinking in the sea.
It couldn't come much sooner, screaming back at me.

We've come so close to the end
Just to pick ourselves back up and start over again.
Without you, I'll start over again.

This is what I believe, you're never gonna take away as long as I'm around.
I can't forget, I won't stop now! It's in my blood I'll show you out.
This is what I believe, you're never gonna take away as long as I'm around,
And I know you'll never hear me now as long as I'm around!

Now crawling from the bottom, I'm digging my way out.
These bridges that I'm burning are slowly crashing down.
Not afraid of what I started, not afraid of going home,
If I never took my chances, I would never know.

Oh, and we've come so close to the end,
Just to pick ourselves back up and start over again.

This is what I believe, you're never gonna take away as long as I'm around.
I can't forget, I won't stop now! It's in my blood I'll show you out.
This is what I believe, you're never gonna take away as long as I'm around,
And I know you'll never hear me now as long as I'm around!

I can't forget, I won't stop now
This is what I believe
I can't forget, I won't stop now
This is what I believe
This is what I believe
This is what I believe

This is what I believe you're never gonna take away as long as I'm around.
I can't forget, I won't stop now! It's in my blood I'll show you out.
This is what I believe you're never gonna take away as long as I'm around,
And I know you'll never hear me now as long as I'm around!
