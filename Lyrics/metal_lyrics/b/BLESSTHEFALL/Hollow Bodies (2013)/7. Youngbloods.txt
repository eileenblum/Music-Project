[feat. Jesse Barnett Of Stick To Your Guns]If you can't find a dedication,
this life could swallow you whole!
If you can't find anything to believe in,
why are you still here?
I am far from perfect,
I am so full of sin.
Everyday you have the chance to take it.
Our time is now.
You're just a bitch!
And it was all a lie.

No one ever gave me anything,
what I have I earned!
And I'll take this to my grave.
Every time I turn around,
I see another face
trying to take me to my
take me to my grave.

What's there to fear?
Somehow I'll carry on.
(We'll all be dead in the end!
We'll all be dead in the end!)
I know you hear me,
for now I'll carry on.
We'll all be dead in the end!
We'll all be dead in the end!

Watch as we rise,
here until our time is over!
We'll all be dead in the end!
We'll all be dead in the end!
Watch as we rise,
here until our time is over!
We'll all be dead in the end!
We'll all be dead in the end!

The words you said,
it was all a lie.

Your reign is ending!
You never know when the time approaches!
Your reign is ending!
I've got the world on my back,
there's no way I'm ever giving up!

Your reign is ending!
You never know when the time approaches!
Your reign is ending!
I've got the world on my back,
there's no way I'm ever giving this up!

You will not be a part of this!
Don't kid yourself,
there's no room for you here!
You will not be a part of this!

You're just a fucking disgrace.
