You have to find me save me
Just hear me out
I can't remember
All of my feelings
Someone save me
My time is over now
and it's not too long now
Just hear me out!

Is this a dream?
Where do I go?
Is this a dream?
Or my subconscious

It's too late
It's too late
They won't let me go
They're sinking around and around you.
As your heart starts to weaken
your body's the reason.
So how can you save them tonight?
As your heart starts to weaken
Your body's the reason
This is not enough
I fell asleep inside your arms
I fell asleep inside

I need to find myself (find myself)
Just let me help myself
find yourself
find yourself
Before it comes to an end!

Show me your face!
It's almost over now
Don't fade away!
We're not the same

It's too late
It's too late
They won't let me go
Were sinking around and around you
As your heart starts to weaken
Your body's the reason
So how can you save them tonight?
As your heart starts to weaken
Your body's the reason
This is not enough
I feel asleep inside your arms
I feel asleep inside your arms

I feel it sinking in
I feel it slipping away
I feel it sinking in
I feel it slipping away (Away)
I feel it sinking in
I feel it slipping away (Away)
I feel it sinking in
I feel it slipping away (Away)
I feel it sinking in
I feel it slipping away (Away)
I feel it sinking in
I feel it slipping away
(So how can you save them tonight?)
I feel it sinking in
I feel it slipping away
(This is not enough!)
