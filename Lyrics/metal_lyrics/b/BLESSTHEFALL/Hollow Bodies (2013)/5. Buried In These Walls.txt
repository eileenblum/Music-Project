I found hope in misery
Sewed my eyes shut so I could see
I wonât throw it away
I wonât throw it away

I found truth in your denial
And Iâll suffer for a while
I wonât throw it away
I wonât throw it away

(I wonât throw it away)

Can you take me to a better place?
Somewhere I feel safe
Till weâre far away?
Can you take me to a better place,
Far away?
I wonât, I wonât throw it away

(I wonât throw it away)

(I wonât throw it away)
I wonât throw it away
