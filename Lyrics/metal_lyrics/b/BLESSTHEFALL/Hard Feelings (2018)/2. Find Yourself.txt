Too bad for you, I'm a walking open wound
Too close too soon, another sad excuse
Go on and take my mind, I'll keep you under my skin
I'll never let this go
Before I lose it all
Tell me now could you

Could you love what tries to kill you?
Will you trust what isn't true?
Can I find my own forgiveness?
Can I get to you?
So find yourself
After today will be all you remember
Before anyone else
Take all their words and rewrite them your own way

That's it for me, my last apology
I held us like glass, that broke inside my hands
We walk a fragile line, no matter what you find
Just keep me under your skin
And what I need to know
Before you let me go
Tell me how could you go

I know you'll never understand
That all my scars and stories
Are who I am
Tell me does it feel like home
Hanging at the end of your rope
You can tear it down or go your own way
