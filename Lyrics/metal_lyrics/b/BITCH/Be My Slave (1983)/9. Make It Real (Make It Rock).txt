Real, make it real
Show 'em how you feel
Hey, what's the deal?
If you wanna be a star then go on out and make it real

[BRIDGE:]
Money, fame
If you want it play the game
Lose...you could win
How you ever gonna know if you don't try and make it real?

Go, gotta go
Put yourself in center stage, get on with the show
Screw it! You can do it
Sit around and wish it, guaranteed you'll hit an all-time low

[BRIDGE:]
Shout it, scream it
Do it, don't dream it

[CHORUS:]
Make it real
Make it real, make it rock
Make it real
Make it real
Real, make it real
Don't just dream, make it real

[LEAD]

Yeah, it's a steal
All you need is talent and sex appeal
Grab it. You can have it
If you wanna be a star then go on out and make it real

[BRIDGE:]
Money, fame
If you want it play the game

[CHORUS:]
Make it real
Make it real, make it rock
Make it real
Make it real, make it rock
Make it real
Make it real, make it rock
Make it real
Make it real
Real, make it real
Make it real
Make it rock!
