Leather, leather, leatherbound
Leather, leather, leatherbound

When you look at me for a reason, just to tie me down
I've got some reasons...like lust for you
Just to have you around
I'm gonna do it to you
You're gonna do it to me
We're gonna do it together
We're all leather, leatherbound

[CHORUS:]
Leather, leather, leatherbound
Leather, leather, leatherbound

The whip is my toy, handcuffs are your joy
You hold me down and I'm screaming for more
Don't let me up, 'cause it's just what I asked for
I'm gonna do it to you, you're gonna do it to me
We're gonna do it together
We're all leather, leatherbound

[CHORUS]

[LEAD]

When you tie me up and gag me...
The way you give me pain
Give me lashes, come on and drag me!
You drive me insane
I'm gonna do it to you, you're gonna do it to me
We're gonna do it together
We're all leather, leatherbound

[REPEAT CHORUS FOUR TIMES]

Leather!
