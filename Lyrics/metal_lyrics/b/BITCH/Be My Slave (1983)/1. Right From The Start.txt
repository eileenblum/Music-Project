Ooh- when the lights come down low it really drives me crazy
Ooh- when I start the show it gets me really high
It gets my blood a-flowin' and I'm gonna tell you why

Yeah right from the start
I love to play the part
I'm a Bitch at heart
And don't mess with me!

I love to crack my whips and see you bow before me
I love to shake my hips and get you really horney
Every song on my lips will make you all adore me

Don't take your eyes off me
I'm a sight to see
Yeah right from the start
Just watch me now

[LEAD]

Yeah right from the start
I will break your heart
I'm a Bitch at heart
Yeah!

Just thought I'd let you know what you're gonna get tonight
Just watch me and I think you'll see that I've got my act down tight
And if you ask real nice you can come backstage tonight

Yeah right from the start
I love to play the part
I'm a Bitch at heart
Yeah right from the start
You can't help but leer
At the Bitch up here
I love to play the part
Yeah right from the start
