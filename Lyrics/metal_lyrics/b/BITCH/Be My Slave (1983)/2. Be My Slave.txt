I want you to be my slave!

I got you under my spell!
You'll never live to tell
If you don't serve me well
Then you'll go straight to hell

You live for my command
You'll serve at my demand
You're kept like an animal in a cage
The victim of my unruly rage

[CHORUS:]
I've got you under my spell!
Be my slave, be my slave
You'll never live to tell
Be my slave, be my slave
If you don't serve me well
Be my slave, be my slave
Then you'll go straight to hell

I'll force you on your knees
You'd better aim to please
I keep you locked up and I have the key
In bondage I'll keep you, you'll never get free

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
I paid a decent price, yeah-
You were on sale and you looked kinda nice
But you've been acting up lately
You just don't know your place
I'll just fix that with a slap in the face

[LEAD]

I am your queen of queens
And I can walk on water
For a message I'll send you to hell for and answer
I am the Devil's daughter

[CHORUS]
