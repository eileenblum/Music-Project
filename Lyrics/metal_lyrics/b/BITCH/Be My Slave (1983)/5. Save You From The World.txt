Watch out for you
That's all you can do
I just wanna save you
I just wanna save you
Just wanna save you from the world

[REPEAT]

Look out, be warned
No one loves you anymore
To fight for your right is a need
To win in a fight you must bleed
Watch out for you

Look out, be warned, beware
They'll castrate you, they don't care
Just think, they wont blink, they'll just stare
Pull your self up, if you dare
Watch out for you,
That's all you can do

[CHORUS:]
Just wanna save you from the world
Don't let them get you best, no
Just wanna save you from the world
The life you want has come to the test

If all I say isn't heard then you will pay
You must be the star in this power play
As life goes on there is no other way

[CHORUS:]
Just wanna save you from the world
Don't wanna see you in distress, oh no
Just wanna save you from the world
The life you want has come to the test

I just wanna save you from the world
