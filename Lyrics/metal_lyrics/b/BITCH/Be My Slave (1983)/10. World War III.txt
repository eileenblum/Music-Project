The world means nothing anymore
There's nowhere left for me to score
You're life is empty, so is mine
We both have met the end of time

[CHORUS:]
World War, World War III
World War, World War III

It's times like this I start to cry
I'm so afraid I'm gonna die
The sky is grey, the earth is black
Hold on, here comes the next attack

[CHORUS]

[LEAD]

There's nowhere left for me to run
There's no more bullets for my gun
Who cares, 'cause they've already won
My friend, the end has just begun

[REPEAT CHORUS FOUR TIMES]
