Riding in thunder, driving in rain
Sometimes I wonder if my life is in vain
Living in dungeons, rotting in cells
If I didn't know better, I'd swear this was hell

Riding in thunder, driving in rain
Locked up by myself, ooh I sure feel the pain
Nightmares of heaven, nightmares of hell
Imprisoned forever by the toll of the bell
Well...
What am I gonna do with my life?

Innocence, nothing
They don't even care
Escape ever-present
I don't ever dare
'Cause guarding my bars is a hound with a gun
Imprisoned forever and nowhere to run
What am I gonna do with my life?
What am I gonna do with my life?

[LEAD]

Riding in thunder, driving in rain
My mind is in pieces, ooh I sure feel the pain
The voices, they're screaming
They're inside my brain
If all this continues they'll think I'm insane
What am I gonna do with my life?
What am I gonna do with my life?
I ask you, I ask you
What am I gonna do with my life?
What am I gonna do with my....
....what am I gonna do with....
....What am I gonna do....
....What am I gonna do....
....What am I...what am I...what?!?
