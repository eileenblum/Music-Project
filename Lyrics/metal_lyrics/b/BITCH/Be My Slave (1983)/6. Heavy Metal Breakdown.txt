The music makes me wonder
What kind of spell I'm under
Heavy Metal is the game
I eat and breath and sleep it
I do believe I'll keep it
Though I'll never be the same
No, I'll never be the same
Heavy Metal Breakdown

Guitar is slashing my ears
It hurts so bad I'm in tears
Yet I just can't break away
The bass and drums will belt you
Well they're enough to melt you
I gotta have it every day

[CHORUS:]
I'm headed for a breakdown
Lightening and thunder of sound
I think I got it pretty bad
I was a nice girl, you see
Until this happened to me
This Heavy Metal drives me mad
It really drives me mad

You know, I tried the new wave
But I just couldn't behave
Everyone tried to calm me down
I said, "I'm leaving you, boys
I gotta find the real noise,
I just can't hang around."

[CHORUS:]
I found the Heavy Metal
And this is where I'll settle
Even though my ears are ringing
I just can't live without it
There ain't no doubt about it
Take it away and I'll quit singing

[LEAD]

At night I wake up screaming
Thank God I'm only dreaming
That there's no Metal anymore
But then my ears are ringing
My vocal chords are stinging
And I'm not dreaming anymore

[CHORUS:]
I'm headed for a breakdown
Lightening and thunder of sound
I think I got it pretty bad
I just can't live without it
There ain't no doubt about it
This Heavy Metal drives me mad
It really drives me mad
Heavy Metal Breakdown

[REPEAT]

Heavy Metal!
