The dying's clothing alive and in motion with vermin all chained together no need
For a warden disease chokes and deprives air resting in puddles of infectious pus

Unstoppable shaking consumes the mind and body staring into the faces if the dead
As they are drug around the room flaying off strips of skin and placing it on them
Welcoming the infections disease hastening final release
