Sadistic inclinations left unchecked by an absolute power interested in obtaining
The truth traditional methods fail to provide the desired effect

Torture a penalty in itself as a prelude to execution

Small cuts and stab wounds help ensure a lingering end importance falls on
The note that the victim shall fell himself die

Hung upside down legs spread wide saw slides between the thighs struggling and screaming
Fills the merciless executioner's eyes choking and vomiting on your blood
Flowing like Caligula's wine
