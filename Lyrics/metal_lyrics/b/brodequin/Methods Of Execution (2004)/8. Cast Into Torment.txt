Placed in a large iron hop hinged in two halves hands bound behind the back
Forced to kneel on the lower half with the executioner straddling the victim

Turning and tightening the screw clamping down the other section immovable agonizing
Pain begins anew

Pressing the body evercloser sweat and tears fill the eyes a slow swelling
Of the throat muffling the cries chest against the knees stomach against the thighs
Spine slowly dislocated breastbone and ribs obliterated
