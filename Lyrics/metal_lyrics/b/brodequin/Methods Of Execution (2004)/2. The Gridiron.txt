Searing the flesh as fat spills onto the ground coals crackle and spark whilst the flames
Grow higher

Preparing your soul for the eternal fires awaiting your arrival gridiron glowing
Red hot the skin burning away turning muscles black

A candle lit by god's grace that shall never be extinguished using fire
To exercise their ire

The remains of morality branded on the frame the punishment of infidels marked
In the holy name abolishing the wide spread disease of heresy
