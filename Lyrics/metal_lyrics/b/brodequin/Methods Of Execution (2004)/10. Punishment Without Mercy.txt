Blades open up the flesh cutting deep into the jaw and cheek forced to drink
Large quantities of wine members tied with a lute string

Slicing the throats of the victims wife and children before him so he knows
His seed also dies with a sadistic twist hot embers replace their eyes

Pleasing the congregation members intense pressure is applied so the victim
Can slowly feel himself die

A confession extracted by force death glazes over the eyes turns and stares
Toward the sky as blood floods the throat torment with death not quick enough
Cursing the killers with his final breath
