Taken back to the cell confined to a low dungeon which no light can enter laid
Upon your back strapped down spread eagle that there will be iron set upon your
Body as great as you can bear and greater

Fed three morsels of barley on the first day of questioning weights added on pressing
To plead still no crimes admitted or denied three drinks if water to sustain life
Through the day weights piling high upon the chest respirations becoming quick
And shallow pressure too intense for the body to sustain

Mind failing under the pain the plate of iron collapses into the lungs and heart
Ending the trial from which neither side has won
