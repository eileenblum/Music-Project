Restrained fastened to a plank outside world cutoff from witnessing the judgement
Set forth upon thee cloth placed over the mouth eyes roll back blood rushes to the
Head consciousness fading continuous stream of water poured in forcing the material down
The throat cloth removed and set to start again while uncontrollably choking

Head dropped downward with a struggling force swallowing up the breath from all screaming
And pleading clamping the lips together verdrinken mouth reopened with an iron and
Set in place then sensation of drowning being a suffocating pain water reingorging
Itself quickly flows choking the groans for help
From the rapid expansion body distorted and swollen
From the rapid expansion body distorted and swollen
