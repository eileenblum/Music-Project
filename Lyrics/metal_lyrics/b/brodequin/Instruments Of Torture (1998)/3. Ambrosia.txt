I put the bodies in their places,
Place expressions
Expressions on their faces
A headless torso lying naked amongst the piles of flesh so sacred.

Conducting experiments to preserve forever
Stages of dismemberment fluctuating from room to room
Flowing the sweet odor of death.

Dissolving limbs, boiling the flesh, power drill injecting acid into the brains of them.
Photos taken while dismembering.
