Mutilation, stretching while breaking on the wheel,
Tied down spread eagle on an iron bar breaks each limb.
Soothing the crowd's thirst for misery,
Cheers of approval following each scream.
Remove the broken body,
Spectators in wait of the ultimate torment,
Slow death by burning at the stake.
Tearing skin from the flesh every blow must hurt,
Strucki n the throat not deat yet body to be burnt.
In endless agony, for all the accusers to see.
Choking unable to see fastened to the stake fire is lit flames take hold death patiently awaits.
