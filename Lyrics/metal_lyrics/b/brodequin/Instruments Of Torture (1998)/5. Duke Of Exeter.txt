Behold the duke of exeter, lying awake eyes wide open beholding the instruments
Of pain ankles set wrists locked down all the boards put in place, muscles tense when
Questioning begins soon fail during restraint wrists and shoulders dilocated life fades
Away the duke of exeter, racked at the pulley, while beaten with cords,
Blood flows from the mouth while boiling oil is poured.
