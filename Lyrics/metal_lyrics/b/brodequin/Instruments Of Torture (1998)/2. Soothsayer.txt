Praise the lord the messiah,
Of ignorance and false prophecy,
Teaching your rules of hatred,
Promising immortality.
Let us pray to love our neighbor
While blessed bombs fall in place,
Entire races, civilizations lost all in the name of god.
Beaten and dejected leader,
Consumed with holy sickness
Promised land made free from pain
Living gods failing,
Venemous words poisoning minds of clear thinking
Leading the congregation into the silence of salvation.
Recycled ancient lies,
Fools try to warn the wise,
Faith in god to heal,
They'll be the first to die.
