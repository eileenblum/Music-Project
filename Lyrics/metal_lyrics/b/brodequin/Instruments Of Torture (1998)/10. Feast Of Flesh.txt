A ritualistic sacrifice set up to pass judgement on the chosen ones a covenant
Blessed with blood priests set with knives in hand anxious believers look toward the sky,

Skin shaven clean, blood flowing, puncture wound, life fading.

Bodies dismembered by the hundreds amongst the screams of bliss severed
Limbs are ravenously devoured baptizing the new in the blood of the feast of flesh.

Arms bound down, blood flowing, Feast of Flesh...
