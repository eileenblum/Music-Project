Burning for blasphemy cries of the dying silenced by
applause in the name of christianity church officials
parading limbless victims through the streets branded
and maimed stripped to the waist wearing only their
garments of shame laughter from the audience grows as
the hanged defecate innards removed slowly to increase
the pain heads beaten with hammers knee cape
pulverized the lungs choked with burning excrement a
celebration of death by witness others hung by
the wrists amputating both legs cauterizing the wounds
with torches
