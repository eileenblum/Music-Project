Carried from whence you came drawn upon
a hurdle to the place of execution led upon
the blood-soaked platform lying amongst
scattered limbs while beaten mercilessly
children hung by their ankles with throats cut
heads later removed and placed in a cauldron
parboiled for preservation tar sparking and
glowing entrails blazing blood and limbs boiling
bound and gagged awaiting further mutilation
ears removed and nailed to a post butchering
in gods name stomach cut open bowels pulled
out tied with a string heart fastened so the last
breath shall not escape to the trial
