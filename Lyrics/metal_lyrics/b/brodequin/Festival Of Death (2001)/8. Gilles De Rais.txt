Luring the unsuspecting young to his private chambers
quickly seized stripped then hung a man of the church
and political power reassuring no harm to silence the cries
of those being sodomized throat slowly cut braguemard
severs the head wallowing in the warmth of the intestines
masturbating upon entrails of the dead removing pieces
adding features previous pleasures litter the floor
disposing of others in public latrines
sex with a headless corpse the violet convulsions
enhancing the experience creating the need for more
bodies hidden under floor boards blood slowly flows from
underneath of secret hidden doors
Gilles De Rais before the courts
families of the victims pray for the release of the 
condemned believing him innocent discovery of more
bodies prompt the execution of Gilles De Rais
