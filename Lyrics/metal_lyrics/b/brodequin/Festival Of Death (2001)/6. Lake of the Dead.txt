Searched for the devils mark cord wrenched around the
head chained to the wall of the cell witches bridle forced
inside, prevented from rest a bodkin inserted
hung up by the thumbs burned between the toes
asked of conspirators judgement passed down
taken to the waters edge priests prepare a lost soul
on a quest to cleanse the land
left foot fastened to the right hand strung between
the shore and boat swung and pelted with stones
introduced to the lake
a guilty witch to float retrieved and quickly hanged
an innocent is sure to sink and cleared of past
mistakes,church officials watch for an sign of
pain to prove guilt,murdering allowed by their lord
