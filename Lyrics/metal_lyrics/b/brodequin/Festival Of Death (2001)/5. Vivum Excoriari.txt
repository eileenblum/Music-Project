Set on display for the public to see so they will
know the fate of those who would do wrong relieved
from the torture the wretched body encaged and hung
alive in chains lack of food and water enhancing the
weakened state forced to stand by a neck shackle or
suffocate blistered and burnt from the sun infected
weeping wound insects have found and feed upon
the unprotected body disease has filled to weak to stand
slowly suffocates,body remains displayed while birds
begin removing the flesh bones become brittle from the
hrash elements tar soaked clothing remains on the body 
still swaying encaged for one thousand days then removed
and given to the family,the cage prepared for the next guest
hoisted up awaiting a slow death crowds gather to witness
the severely beaten and unwilling participant
