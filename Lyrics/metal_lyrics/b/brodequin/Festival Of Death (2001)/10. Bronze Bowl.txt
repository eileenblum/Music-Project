Denying the crimes of which you?vebeen found
guilty bound hand and foot to the table a mouse
filled bowl overturned on the stomach trapping the
rodents insidea fire placed on top of the container
heating the vermin held within,attempting escape
from the flame burrowing though the skin
every bite intended to remind of the crimes and
false pretense a frenzied feast deep within
executioners witness movement under the skin
abdomen appears to be boiling as the panic filled
creatures enter the intestines spilling out the sides
of the body wracked with pain moving into the chest
cavity a slow devouring of the heart and lungs
Inquisitors smile sadistically listening to the screams
of the guilty
