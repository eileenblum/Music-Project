Led By a cleargyman to your
place of final occupate
turned facing the crowd the 
executioner approaches dressed in black
bloodthirsty audience awaits the mazzatello
to act,coffin,positioned,nearby close to
where the body should land forlorn
family members stand beside on hand
foced to pay the executions expence
the executioner grips the massive mallet
and steps behind out of sight aiming
striking one tremendous blow on top of the 
head blood sprays the front rows crashing to
the floor with a shattered skull the audience
expels a malicious roar unconscious in a pool
of blood the executionerslits the throat
answering the crowds screams for more
victim dying,placed in the coffin
removed from the scaffold,blood still draining
