Hanging high above the Inquisitors gathered
below ropes and shackles twitch in anicipation
placed upon the throne designed not for rules
but the sinful wretch
a belt fastened around the waist hoisted over the
cradle and lowered spike fixed under the spine
ropes attached to the feet rocked back and forth
questioned on faith weights shackled to the limbs
intense interrogation,spike set deep within the
flesh reducing the spine to pulp immense pain
fills the body with every tremor of the ropes
raised once again...
