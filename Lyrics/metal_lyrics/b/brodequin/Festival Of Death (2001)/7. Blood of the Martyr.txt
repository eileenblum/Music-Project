Wires drawn tightly around the fingers until they become
one solid mass separated again by wedges others sawn
in half bound to the framework with thin cords wrapped
three times around the limbs poles inserted between the
boards gradually turned lines enter the skin
slowly drawing the arms together while coughing up
blood both shoulders dislocated removed while the bones
are reset ribs and sternum fractured losing consciousness
bleeding profusely from the amputation of limbs
