The call for war
Hear the pure sound of the horns
Voices, bright and clear,
Loud and warm

They call for a battle
Against christianity
They call for a fight
For your gods

Father Odhinn,
Hold your hands right over me
Send me your ravens
Guard my soul

Black Messiah - that's what I call you
Christianity - the darkness for us all
The sign of the cross - symbol of the damned
Let me be free - for my fate I'm proud to die

The retaliation
Of the Northmen will fulfill
The grand vision
I have had

By the old oak
A bloodoath I gave
To bury the lambs
Of christ

So let the horns call
For the final war
Until the end
I will fight
