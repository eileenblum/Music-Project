It's time to change your faith, believe in me
I am the bringer, of the next dark century
Remember the past, false prophets, a weak religion
I'll promise you, believe in me and I will free your soul

I am the new Messiah
Follow me
I'll give you the power for a thousand years
Come with me

Blind your eyes, open your ears
My words are law to you
Follow my will, I'll give you immortality
My lies turn you to a mindless, weak slave of the dark

The world changes into another part of evilness
War and pain rules over the earth
Like a dark veil of destruction

Follow me into another dark millenium
