Rain, Storm, Thunder, Lightning
Giant Waves across the Sea
Now guide me, Father
On our Quest to Vinnland

Riding - Ride the Drakkar
On your Way
Riding - Ride the Drakkar
Day by Day

On icy Winds we're flying
Right to West on a Path of Hope
On stormy Seas we're riding
A Journey for the Glory
On icy Winds we're flying
Odhinns Hands above our Souls
On stormy Seas we're riding
Untill the End of Days

Riding - Ride the Drakkar
On your Way
Riding - Ride the Drakkar
Day by Day

Rain, Storm, Thunder, Lightning
Giant Waves across the Sea
Now guide me, Father
On our Quest to Vinnland
