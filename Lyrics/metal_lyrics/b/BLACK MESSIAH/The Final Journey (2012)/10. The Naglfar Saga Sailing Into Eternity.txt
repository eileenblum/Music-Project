Now the time has come, Iâm on the ship under Ymirâs thumb
Sad and full of grief my vision blurs and I feel numb

Weâre on the ship of nails under a thousand wails
We are all unfree, this is our destiny
Eternally undead as a malefic thread
Weâre on an endless rave on top of the crest of wave

The words of Mother Hel will follow me to the end of time
She did not give me a chance for recompense and to regret all my sins
I am damned, forever bound, only a slave on the Nail-Ship
Now I am forlorn, I am an unsacred soul so alone and despaired

Weâre on the ship of nails under a thousand wails
We are unfree, this is our destiny
Eternally undead as a malefic thread
Weâre on an endless rave on top of the crest of wave
