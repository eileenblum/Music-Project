A dark shadow above my soul
A salty taste on my tongue
The ground is moving from left to right
Now it is real, Iâm on board

On board
Iâm on board

Filled with fear I gaze to the ground
The planks are made of toenails
A rotten smell fills the air
I realize, Iâm on board

On board
Iâm on board

A leatherwhip hits my opressed back
I fall on my knees and I look up
An undead face is grinning at me
âHey, welcome here, youâre on boardâ

On board
Youâre on board

Dead bodies are moving around me
They do their work on this ship
From now I am a part of this crew
A warrior of death here on board

On board
Here on board
On board
Iâm on board
