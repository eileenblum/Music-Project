[Chorus:]
[Warrior:]
Oh Mother Hel, Iâm standing here
A man of fear and sorrow
Iâm on my knees in front of you
To plead for mercy,
Mother Hel, I lived my life
In a fatal way of darkness
Forgive my soul and set me free

I lived my life in a malicious way
Hate and grudge were my constant companions
Now I regret what I have done
I beg you to spare my soul

All my sins are coming back to me
All my doings brought me to the abyss
Now I realize my faults
Oh, grand goddess, please forgive me

[Chorus:]
[Goddess:]
Warrior, the golden hall is out of reach for you
Your soul is doomed, for you there is no rescue
Valhalla is reserved for the worthy men,
So Iâll send you to the abyss again
As an undead, will-less body

[Chorus]

[Goddess:]
I will send you on board of the Nail-Ship
