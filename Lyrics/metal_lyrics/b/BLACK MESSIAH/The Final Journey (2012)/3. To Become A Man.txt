Your eyes wide open and your breath is getting short
Your face and your body are covered in cold sweat
This will be the first time for you, young warrior
Itâs a matter of life and of death

Courage and belief will guide you on your unsafe path
Look forward, be strong and sly, my son
Use your sword the way I told you in the past
Trust in your skills and be a man

[Chorus:]
My hands lie on your shoulder â My sword is by your side
Your blood is running colder â We look forward to fight
Your piercing glance tells stories â About the fears of blood and death
The gods will save our human bodies â Theyâll guide us to our last breath
The first fight for an unskilled warrior â Will turn you hard from boy to man
Your childhoodâs ending here in battle â Now keep calm if you can

[Chorus]
