In front of Valhalla's gates, on a battlefield drenched in blood, Odin and Mimir meet each other on the evening prior to the captive's exchange, Odin was kneeling in front of the bodies of his brothers Wile and We, who died honourably on the field.
Only a few steps beside lies the dead body of the witch Gullveig, who also died on the field.
As Odin becomes aware of his friend he stands up and looks sorrowly at Mimir.
Together they stand on the field in memory of their departed brothers.
