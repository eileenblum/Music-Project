[Odin:]
"Now it's time for us - to retailate
Destruction shall prevail - a roaring battle
Vanaheim has to burn - a feast for the fire
It shall never rise - from the ashes
Burn..."

[Chorus:]
Words of tempation, foul and malicious
Spoken with hatred, by a wicked witch
Death and destruction, are her dreadful heir
Now gather the seed, Gullveig brought to you

[Odin:]
"And Burn... Vanaheim burn... Burn... Vanaheim burn!"

[NjÃ¶rd:]
"Oh, warriors of Asgaard - your punishment we fear
Please spare our lovely Vanaheimr - and go away from here"

[Odin:]
"Betrayers of the Ãsir race - Revenge is what we want
I'll plunder your sweet Vanaheim - I'll burn it to the ground

[Chorus]
