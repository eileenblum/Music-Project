Valhalla was close to fall.
The Venir use of magic nearly threw Odin's host off, but with their very last effort the Ãsir could withstand the storm and repel the hostile army.
As the Vanir felt that their march on Ãsirs' stronghold would not be crowned with success, they disheartendly began to retreat.
Now it was the Ãsirs' time to chase the Vanir back to their home.
Driven by their thirst for revenge.
Thor and Tyr lead the Ãsirs' rush on their horses chasing after NjÃ¶rd and his brothers and come to stop on the top of a small mountain providing a perfect view over Vanaheim.

[Thor:]
"Look, Brother. Down their in the valley...
this must be Vanaheim"

[Tyr:]
"This is supposed to be Vanaheim?
Let's burn it to the ground!"
