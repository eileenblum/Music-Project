Legends - told us by the elder ones
Of gods - honour, heroes trolls and thurses
Stories - Happened a long time ago
A Belief - Living in our blood

Of Myths and Legends

Let us bring to you
The secret of our father's heir
Feel the breath
Of the long forgotten bequest

[chorus]
Tales of Legends written by the Gods themselves
A golden age
Stories of a Nordic realm, a time of honesty
Age of war

Odin - Father of the Aesir race
Runes - Thrown to foresee your fate
Udgard - Lang of giants, land of evil
Bifrost - Bridge to Valhall

Of Myth and Legends

Let me sing about a world
of miracles and pride
Let me bring to you the spirit
of our fathers' might
Find the way to inherit the path of victory
A journey straight to Yggdrasil, the mighty, sacred tree

[repeat chorus]
