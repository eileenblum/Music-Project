I am the Wolf
Call me the Beast
Give me to eat
I come to appease my hunger for blood
My hunger for flesh
My hunger for gore
Feed me with human hearts, entrails and fear
Give me your pain
I need your hate
I need your feelings to enjoy your death
I love your taste
Your soul is mine
I am the wolf lacerating your soul

Bestial Hunt
The smell of your sweat awakens my lust
I come to appease my hunger for blood
My hunger for flesh
My hunger for fore
I am still lurking for you in the night
This night is dark
Your flesh is warm
I need your feelings to enjoy your death
I love your taste
Your soul is mine
I am the wolf lacerating your soul
