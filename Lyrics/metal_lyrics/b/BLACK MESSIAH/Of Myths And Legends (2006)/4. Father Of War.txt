Lead my sword for glory - Father of War
Hold my shield for victory - Guide me once more
Into your hands - I'm laying my fate
In this endless battle - You are my mate

[chorus]
Tyr - Father of War
Tyr - Guide me once more

If there is darkness - You are my light
A bronze warrior - Shining so bright
If there is coldness - You keep me warm
Lend me your Power - To defeat the harm

[repeat chorus]

Son of Hymir - Conqueror of Garm
In a divine battle - You lost your arm
God of Justice - Father of War
Aesir of Truth - Guide me once more

[repeat chorus]
