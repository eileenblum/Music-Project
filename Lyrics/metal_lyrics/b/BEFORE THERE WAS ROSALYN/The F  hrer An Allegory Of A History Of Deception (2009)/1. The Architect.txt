Like a father to a son, all thatâs mine is always Yours. The stars of heaven mourn for whatâs to come. I hear a loverâs song inviting me away. I know the first heart that breaks isnât mine but Yours. I know now all things they must pass. I know now all things they must pass, oh the cost. How can I ask to know what forgiveness is while my hands are still tied with guilt and the filth of mistrust? My hands have built the cross, oh the cost. My hands have built the cross, oh the cost... How can I ever look into Your eyes when my hands will nail You down? How can I ever look into Your eyes... How can I ask to know what forgiveness is... How can I ask to know what forgiveness is when itâs my hands that built the cross?...that built the cross? How can I... How can I account for this? How can I... How can I just walk away? How can I... How can I... Thereâs a flame that still lights the gate... lights the gate.
