We stand on the brink of the end. A familiar song coming from the horizon, the clouds part like the sea. This is the spark of eternity...eternity. I was born a slave. Iâve thirsted for You my whole life. Youâve changed not Thy ways. Changed not Thy cross. Youâve kept it firmly upon my shoulders that You might hear me...that You might hear me. I will hold this to the grave...to the grave...hold this to the grave...to the grave. Remove not Thy song that I might grow cold and turn from Thee. But hold me close, Oh Lord. A hundred thousand lifetimes have come and gone, and a hundred thousand lives would be given to stand where I stand. And the clouds of Heaven open and I hear... "How great is our God!" ...one familiar song... "How great is our God!" ...and I hear one familiar song. "How great is our God!" Hold me close, oh Lord. Leave me not... "How great is our God!" ...this last hour... "How great is our God!" ...this last hour. "How great is our God!" "How great is our God! How great is our God! How great is our God!".... Sing with me...
