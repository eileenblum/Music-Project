War... wages outside these walls, but your eyes are like the sea. Two oceans that pull and draw me in. Our hands in one anotherâs, this moment in time will pass too soon. History will devour the love between us both. History will devour the love between us both. Consequence will take me from you. âForgive meâ will be written on the walls of a room I will paint with the brush of regret and bind in a book I will seal with a kiss the night this century comes to... comes to an end. Oh my fabled Eve, itâs not you but I who still burns from the serpentâs tongue. Take this knife, split my heart in two. Iâll keep half of you, youâll always be the better half of me...youâll always be the better half of me. With your hand in mine I thought weâd last forever. I hope you understand. I have to hope we never meet again...never meet again. War wages outside these walls, it too shall pass. With your hand in mine and mine in yours, Iâd hold these gates forever, but the new millennium will see Ahabâs great white whale...traded for a...for a...for a...unicorned...unicorned...unicorned horse.... I will understand...I will understand...I will understand...I will understand your distance...your silence...your distance...your silence...you...
