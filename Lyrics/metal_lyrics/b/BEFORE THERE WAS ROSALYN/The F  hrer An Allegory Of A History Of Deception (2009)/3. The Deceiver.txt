Iâve been misled into the grave. Loneliness is the shadow of a word I used to know. Weak and broken they march on. They bring chaos. They bring war. I know... Iâve been misled. Iâve been misled. Iâve been misled. Iâve been misled. Regret sleeps in my bed. Regret sleeps in my bed. The weak and broken they march on. Towers rise into the sky. All our words confused, no one knows how to love. They bring war. They bring chaos. I know Iâve been misled. I beg for change. Thorns cradle my own two feet. I beg for change. Thorns cradle my own two feet. Loneliness... loneliness... whispers: Embrace me. The weak and broken they march on. They bring war. Embrace me. They bring chaos. I know Iâve been misled.
