Ancient serpent. Betrayer. War machine. Empires and kingdoms rise in your name. Towers are still being built. The dead lead the blind. A plague upon our house. Twin cities burn, pillars of salt are lost to the dust of time. Will you profit the world? Will you profit the world? Will you profit the world? Will you profit? No. Prophet, this world means nothing. Prophet, this world means nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing... Oh what a shame that we must learn of life from death. What a shame that we must learn of life from death. Take this world to the brink of war. KINGDOM. EMPIRE. REICH. Hell is coming. Better to die for truth than live for nothing. Better to die for truth than live for nothing.
