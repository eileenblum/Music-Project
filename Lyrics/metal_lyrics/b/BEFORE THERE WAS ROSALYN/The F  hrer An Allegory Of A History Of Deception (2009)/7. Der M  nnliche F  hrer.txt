I bring this message from above. Heaven watches and it waits and it knows your mouth holds a mirror that only reflects what you suggest. Liar. Deceiver of worlds. I bring this message signed in blood. Make it mine. Your touch is a plague. Your touch is a plague. Your touch is a plague. Your touch is a plague... Every knee shall bow in this life or the next. Every knee shall bow in this life or the next. Iâve sold this body to [...] in poor taste to lungs driven by the power of your deceit. A gift you gave to me like the silhouette of a betrayerâs kiss. I bring this message. Take my life if it brings Heaven home...if it brings Heaven home. A gift you gave to me like the silhouette of a betrayerâs kiss. Every knee shall bow. Every tongue will confess. In this life or the next... I know youâre there. I know youâre there. I know youâre there. I know... Oh... Liar. Liar. Liar.
