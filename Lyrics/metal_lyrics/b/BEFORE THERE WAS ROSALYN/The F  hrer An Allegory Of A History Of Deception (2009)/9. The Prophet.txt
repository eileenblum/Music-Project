Oh dear God, thereâs vultures everywhere threatening to tear my heart apart. Withdraw Yourself from me not even for a moment. Oh how I fear all might be lost. Iâve been down this road before, Iâve been so lost... I will not be afraid, I was born for this. I will not be afraid, I was born for You.... Oh there are vultures threatening to tear my heart apart...apart. Surrounded by a million faces, all they know is fear. All they know is doubt. All they fear is death. Death is not the worst that can happen to a man. Oh how thereâs prophets, priests, teachers who preach You with their lips... But Father, let us not turn our eye from the plow, no matter the cost. This world means nothing without Christ at the crown. I can sing of Your love forever. I can sing... I can sing of Your love forever. I can sing... I can sing of Your love forever. I can sing of Your love forever. I can sing of Your love forever. I can sing... I can sing of Your love forever. I can sing of Your love forever. Let me sing of Your love forever. Let me sing of Your love.... Oh how Iâd hate to think about everything Iâd be without Grace upon the cross...Grace upon the cross. Oh how Iâd hate to think about everything Iâd be without Grace upon the cross...Grace upon the cross...Grace upon the cross.
