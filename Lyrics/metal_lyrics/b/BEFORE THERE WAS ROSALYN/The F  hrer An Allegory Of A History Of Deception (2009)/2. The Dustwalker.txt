Oh what have I done? What have we done? This is the way knowledge courses through my veins. What a price to pay to know death is coming for both you and I. We stand naked in the valley of truth. The bone pulled from my chest still beats with your lungs... but your lips still taste warm from that serpentâs subtle kiss...subtle kiss...subtle kiss. Can you hear the sound of Grace? Can you hear the sound of Grace? Can you hear the sound of Grace? Can you hear the sound of Grace? All I hear is emptiness. All I hear is emptiness. All I hear is emptiness. All I hear... I am the first of many... I am the first of many... but I will hold to the promise. I will hold to the promise. Grace, walk with me again... walk with me again. I am so afraid to die.
