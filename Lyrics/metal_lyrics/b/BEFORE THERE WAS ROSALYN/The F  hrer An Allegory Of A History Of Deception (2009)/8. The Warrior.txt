Oh SIN atra! We only live once, but if you reap the second death, once is enough. Oh! Shake! Speare! The valiant taste of death but once, cowards die many times before the day. Angels sing to me a graceful song that I might taste of this with a smile. As far as I see, all I see are Pharisees. As far as I see from the tyrant to the beggar. When Heaven comes to fill the sands of time like the hour glass, all thatâs left is emptiness. This is our chance. This is our time. This is our fight. This is the fifteen minutes we have to leave a legacy behind. THIS IS OUR CHANCE. THIS IS OUR TIME. THIS IS OUR FIGHT. THIS IS THE FIFTEEN MINUTES we have... Youâre skin and bones but so much more. Youâre skin and bones but so much more...but so much more... Say something worthwhile...something worthwhile.
