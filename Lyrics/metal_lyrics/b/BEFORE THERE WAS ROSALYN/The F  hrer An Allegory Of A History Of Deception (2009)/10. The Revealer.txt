[feat. guest vocals by Dallas Taylor of Maylene and the Sons of Disaster]Weâve seen this before, through the eyes of the prophet. This is how the end begins. The holy city ignites with a great noise. Thereâs a fire above the sea with a flame that calls out to you and to me. The multitudes make their way, their sins are bricks in their hands, one more piece to add to the great wall of despair. Oh, we have seen this before, through the eyes of the prophet. Oh, we have seen this before, through the eyes of the prophet. This is how the end begins. (This is how the end begins.) This is how the end begins. (This is how the end begins.) The holy city ignites with a great noise. Heaven comes like a song that shakes the sun and the moon...it shakes the sun and the moon. And the judgment comes like the sea, with eyes lit with a flame that gives birth to the ocean...of time...the ocean of time...the ocean of time. I once was afraid to die, but I heard a voice call out: "Behold I AM the One who was dead... Behold I AM the One who was dead... Behold I AM the One who was dead... and is alive...is alive evermore." The holy city ignites with a great noise. Heaven comes like a song that shakes the sun and the moon. And this is how the end begins. The holy city ignites with a great noise... The dead seek death... ...with a great... ...but death flees from them. ...noise. I once was afraid to die. I was once afraid to die. I once was afraid to die. I was once afraid to die. I once was afraid to die. I was once afraid to die. I once was afraid to die. I was once afraid to die. "I AM the One who was dead...is alive. I AM the One who was dead...is alive. I AM the One who was dead...is alive. I AM the One who was dead...is alive." Oh... "I AM He. I AM He. I AM He. Elohim. Elohim. Elohim. Elohim."
