I am nothing more then a lifeless form of a dormant vessel
entombed in the shadows of a dissonant world of a festing race.
Iâll roam this earth with thoughts of a one day pure existence and on that day
the human race will stand and march as oneâ¦
o Fuck.
Fall to your fucking knees.
I have vowed to erase your existence.
Over and over again my hatred harbors a violent eradication.

This septic slaughter will judge you all.
Your putrid blood will fill these seas, until the streets awash.

These disease ridden corpses will pile and bloat on the streets.
Like a pig to the slaughter, iâll dissect every fucking inch.

I am nothing more then a lifeless form of a dormant vessel
entombed in the shadows of a dissonant world.
Iâll roam this earth with thoughts of a one day pure existence
and on that day the human race will stand and march as one.

Your putrid blood will fill these streets.
Iâll judge you all.

Welcome to damnation.
Welcome to judgement.

Breathe in the air and savor the earth you defiled.
Kneel at this altar, this is what you have done.
Accept your judgement, your time has come.
These gates will part
and welcome you to eternityâ¦
