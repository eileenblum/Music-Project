[feat. Kyson Sheperd of Signal The Firing Squad]Iâm feeling sick from the thought of you all
expected to walk when you canât even crawl.
Spoon feed lies at your first breath
count down the days till a beautiful death.

The spoilt filth that roam these streets
it begins to make me sick.
Now I have realised what I have to do
eradicate the all and send them to awaiting tombs.

Embrace me with open arms
itâs not too late to redeem you.
Is it youâre fault that youâre a waste of space?
Or is it just this fucked up world that consumes you?

I donât bring pity for those who are leeches of the sun
I wonât forget those you claim they are redeeming.
I wonât forget those until I have taken every one.

Can you hear all the lies? that surrounds you?
Can you speak the truth thatâs not found in you?

Iâm feeling sick from the thought of you all
expected to walk when you canât even crawl.
Spoon feed lies at your first breath
count down the days until a beautiful death.

(This rotting inside I feel it consuming
this hatred inside I feel it consuming)

Leeches of the sun

I dream of tidal waves consuming this world
picking off you fucking fleas that unfurl,
so if it doesnât happen I am here to serve.

Eradication of all that have turnedâ¦.
