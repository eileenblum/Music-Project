Itâs happened again
regained consciousness and find myself on the streets.
I retrace footsteps
to be led to a burnt down home.

Itâs coming back to me, I can now hear the screams
repeating again and again, their all begging me to stop.
I have no control now
so iâm left with these blood stained hands
I wash them in seas
forgive me please
its not my fault.

Where is this demon in me?
Or am i all alone?
How could i do such evil things?
I feel my heart turn to stone.

Now these days are closer
I must return home
I can feel my self convulsing
I donât want to be alone.

Oh my god I am possessed again

I run straight for the kitchen draw
to grab my sharpest blade
this hunting game is about to begin.
Run you putrid filthy fucks
as your front door is kicked in.

This is not a choice this is a way of life
I spread a plague of torment to cleanse this fucking race
iâve found a purpose here
these hands have been revealed.
Now I know what I must do to rid this world of a vile existence.

Iâve found a purpose here
these hands have been revealed
I spread a plague of torment
to cleanse this fucking race.

That shaking earth thatâs at your feet.
So without any time to waste
fall to your fucking knees.

Prepare to witness something you have never seen before
removing every piece of you starting with your teeth you whore.
Iâll keep breathing until I think the time is right
when the clock strikes three oâ three iâll end your fucking life tonight.

This is not a choice, this is a way of lifeâ¦
