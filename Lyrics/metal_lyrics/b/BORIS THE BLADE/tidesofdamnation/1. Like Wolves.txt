[feat. CJ McMahon of Thy Art Is Murder][Lyrics by Daniel Sharp and Chris CJ Mcmahon*]

My craving is one with the wolves, like vultures circling the new born,
The sun will rise and fall just as these days will pass, this black crown upon my eyes is taking its toll on me, its like the king of lands the conquer of seas, is me.

Now revealed a mistake that cant be controlled,
Once a man now in search of lost souls
Embarking on a journey endless lifeless conquest, there will be no forgiveness till these hands lay at rest,
With open land and open seas in front of me a past forgotten no resemblance to me ,
Can you smell the air tonight as the days dawn is at end?
I am here for another reason that you can't comprehend.

*(I wear this crown you bow to me cover this land there rotting and spreading disease , I am left with no name you'll remember me, gather your women your children to feed the beast) 

This is who I have become, I am not ashamed just an acceptance of the inevitable, I am here for another reason you can not comprehend..
This is who I have become.
Now does this all become clear to you? Never listened now Im screaming at you,

Unleashed with a remarkable rage I walk this earth immortal and every time I crave ill think of you in pure disgust , and now there is a reason you can not comprehend this is the final count so vicious from a real man.

My craving is one with the wolves, like vultures circling the new born,
The sun will rise and fall as I consume you all!
