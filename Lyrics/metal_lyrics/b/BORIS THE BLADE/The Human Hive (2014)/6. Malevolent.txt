New beginnings,
These hands have been set free.
These dreams of annihilation now a reality,
A new strength of hatred has risen,
Revealed before your eyes.
Your beauty will rot as this sun shall fall,
Reduced to this earth for eternity.
Your beauty will rot as this sun shall fall,
Reduced to this earth for eternity.
Sleepless winter nights still walking cold streets,
Searching with wondering eyes.
I can see you from the shadows,
I wait, I hide.
Walking fast your heart skips beats as tears fall from your face.
You feel death in the air as I begin to take chase,
Hatred is unleashed full force upon that beautiful face.
Can you feel my hatred?
It's hard to see with your eyes removed.
Now I'm seeking vengeance,
For every word was a bitter lie.
The time has come to show you passion,
As I send your loved ones to their grave.
I will drown you in their blood.
Their bodies left for flies.
I will fill these hand-made caskets.
Dismembered limbs, collected eyes,
Your beauty will rot as this sun shall fall,
You are reduced to this earth for eternity.
