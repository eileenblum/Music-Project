Bring forth the snarling jaws of the wicked
Embrace the carnage upon our nations.
I shatter the laws of humanity
I am my own creation.
I follow the stars of the blackest of nights,
Scorned upon the suns first light.
There are voices in my head keeping me alive.
I stare at my blade's reflection but only see the sky.
Could suicide soon be my sweet divine?
The skin is rotting right right before my eyes.
I feel nothing beneath this empty sky.
I can feel the misery approaching
Throughout these cold and horrid nights.
There are voices in my head keeping me alive.
I stare at my blade's reflection but only see the sky.
Could suicide soon be my sweet divine.
I have walked the path of the dead and followed you every footstep.
Leading me beyond this world.
Into the bowels of hell.
