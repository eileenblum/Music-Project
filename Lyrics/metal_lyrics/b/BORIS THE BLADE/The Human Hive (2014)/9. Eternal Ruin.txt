Feed him fear,
Feed him eternal hatred.
The skies will burn as they pillage the earth of life.
Tearing at the throat of existence.
They bleed us dry.
A million tusks and a million eyes emerge from the shadows.
Their jaws unhinge as they froth at the mouth with hunger.
Our hearts pounding with fear as the trumpets sound their ascension.
Birthing a plague of devastation.
A plan for bloodshed devised beneath our very soil.
The serpents shed their rotting skin and swarm the cracks of the earth.
In his presence they cower as he arises from his throne.
His gruesome slaughter unleashed upon the world.
Watch as the vultures circle.
Watch as the maggots feast upon this human wasteland.
The devour the flesh and blood of man with teeth of annihilation.
The earth turns to ruin.
Nothing is spared.
