Succumb to our violent ways
Witness my hate grow stronger with every passing day
The path of total destruction is here.
I can hear the serpents constrict the veins of the weak.
Their lungs will collapse, their bones will break.
The beast inside will reign down.
No one will be saved
The pungent stench of my catacombs linger in the air.
My vaults of death exposed, to strike fear in the eyes of the cowards.
Hypocrisy is granted to the most violent of kings.
No crown to gain, no throne to uphold
Your life is the only possession obtained
I bring forth the true vision of agony.
Marked for treason, forever staining your flesh
Feel the strength of my hatred
No one will be saved.
