These eyes have foreseen the end
we will fall under our own creation
the paths we've chosen
and the misinformation we have believed.
force feeding hollow minds
will dawn the darkest day of man

we are vermin
spat from the womb of mother earth
a walking miscarriage of flesh and bone.
hail destroyer
hail extinction
bring forth our gruesome ending.

this earth will rot to its core.
a daunting retrospective of your beliefs.
there will be no rapture -
no salvation
only eternal rot.
darkness.
the sky will fill with the smog of economic turmoil
feeding money into dead idols
icons of false hope.

servants of extinction -
moulded vessels of flesh

we have brought this on our selves leading this heard of human cattle into a merciless slaughter
no longer will I bare-witness to this endless design

this is the funeral of man.
darkness
the sky will fill with the smog of economic turmoil
feeding money into dead idols
icons of false hope

servants of extinction
moulded vessels of flesh

we have brought this on our selves leading this heard of human cattle into a merciless slaughter
no longer will I bare-witness to this endless design
