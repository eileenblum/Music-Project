I found you floating in the shallows,
Your wretched corpse bloated and half decayed.
The smell of rotting entrails still lingers in my mind.
You were a work of art
- A thing of beauty.
I pushed your body back out to sea.
Never to be seen again.
You left me wandering the shorelines,
Begging for your return.
But you never returned.
I drag their bodies to the sand and earth them into this water just for you.
You were inspiration in it's purest form.
You left me wandering the shorelines,
Begging for your return.
You will never return.
