Black out the sun.
Cast the shadows upon their flesh.
Let the purge of existence begin.
I feel the weight of the world,
With every breath in my dying lungs.
I hear the screams of the aborted daughters.
As the conquering begins of the kings,
And their rising sons.
They slaughter the strange and pillage the weak.
They stand tall at your defeat.
I gaze at the atmospheric effects induced to the earth.
Reduced to nothing,
The thrones of misery now bear the weight of their morality.
The dead will bring us new life.
The past forgotten - buried in the dirt.
This fucking world will suffer.
Black out the sun.
Cast the shadows upon their flesh.
I feel the weight of the world with my breath,
In my dying lungs.
I gaze at the atmospheric effects induced to the earth.
Reduced to nothing,
The thrones of misery now bear the weight of man.
I gaze at the atmospheric effects induced to the earth,
Reduced to nothing,
The thrones of misery now bear the weight of their morality.
now bear the weight of man.
