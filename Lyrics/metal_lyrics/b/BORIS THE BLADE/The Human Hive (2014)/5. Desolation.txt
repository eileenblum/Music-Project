tranquility emerges
as the dead seep into this earth
devastation intended for the cowards of treason
feel the earth tremble beneath your fucking feet

your face forgotten
nothing awaits you beyond this life
forever to rot
within the earth

this scorched earth ablaze with the scent of creation
a darkness fuelled by hatred is here

death will rain from the skies

my horrid visions
depict a world turned into dust
no life will wonder upon this soil
complete de-creation

the bastards sons and the innocent virgins
will feel the last wrath of my apocalyptic rage
temptations of a broken man
now set me free

your face forgotten
nothing awaits you beyond this life
forever to rot
within the earth

I will watch as you fade away
as your world turns to ashes before my eyes
and everything you've loved
will be nothing but a memory

I will watch as you fade away
as your world turns to ashes before my eyes
and everything you've loved
will be nothing but a memory
