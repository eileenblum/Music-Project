Bearing the servant's crown,
Wasting the flesh of man with every heaving motion.
Consuming filth and disease,
Our blood is ridden with parasites beneath our skin.
Merchants of extinction,
Hatred seething through our veins.
Spawned with the darkest intentions.
We spill the blood of man.
Feeding this machine.
As the parasites thrive within the blood of all humanity.
Feeding upon the cells of man.
Gorging themselves on our blood.
Inside this human hive.
They have embedded themselves inside our nervous system.
We are a host to an evil creation.
They riddle our bodies with hatred,
Turning us on each other.
Convulsions begin as they consume our internal design.
Forging their creation inside our mind.
Implanted in false memories.
We are the generation of the damned.
We are the hate creation.
We are the generation of the damned
Feeding this hate machine.
We will crush the skulls of every man, woman &amp; child.
Furthering our extinction.
