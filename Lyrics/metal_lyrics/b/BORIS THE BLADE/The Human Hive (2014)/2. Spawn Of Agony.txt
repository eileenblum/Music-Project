Stand in silence, in the presence of the modern man.
Bow at their feet and succumb to their every demand.
I must put an end to this wretched monarchy.
I bring forth a vicious path.
The spawn of agony.
I shall carve my name between their eyes.
Marked and left for dead.
Beneath the blackened skies
I can hear their cries.
Marked and left for dead

So let the cowards run for the fucking hills.
I will scatter their bones within the sky
As a monument for the whole world to see

The pack grows hungry
For the taste of their blood spill
As daylight turns to dusk and time stands still

So let the wolves feed upon the young
They ravage the corpses of those cast from the Earth

The pack grows hungry
For the taste of their blood spill
As daylight turns to dusk and time stands still

I shall carve my name between their eyes
Marked and left for dead
Beneath the blackened skies
I can hear their cries
Marked and left for dead
I shall carve my name
Marked and left for dead
Beneath a blackened sky
Marked and left for dead
