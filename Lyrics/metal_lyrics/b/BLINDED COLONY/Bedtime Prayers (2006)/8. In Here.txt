Cut me out from the belly, first light dazzling me
Gave me a name followed by a number

In here we cannot run away
In here we are meant to stay
In here, until we fade away
In here we are held back

Borders everywhere, musts everywhere
I don`t know where I want to go, but I won`t stay here

Late racists drew these lines
Locked up by your name in modern time
I eat, I sleep, I guard what`s mine
What they call freedom I cannot find

Forced to complete in this bloody game
It`s fucked how we don`t complain
I cannot live with the end when I can`t play

In here we cannot run away
In here we are meant to stay
In here until we fade away
In here we are fucked

What`s the price of the sun?
When you own it you?ll charge us all
What`s the price of this earth?
Since you own it you charge us all for living, for breathing...
I can no longer breathe in here

Late racists drew these lines
Locked up by your name in modern time
I eat, I sleep, I guard what`s mine
What they call freedom I cannot find
