Are you there, dear old friend? I really miss you
`Cos I can`t feel your beats unless my hand`s on my chest

Guidance, please! Now don`t you shut down again
Your guidance ceased and I fell down, I still don`t stand

Dear old friend where have you gone?
Now I can`t feel at all what`s right or wrong

I made wrong moves, a dog rose in bloom later withered
Then the shock, that shakes me still, came almost fatal

Guidance, please! Now don`t you shut down
again
Your guidance ceased and I fell down, I still
don`t stand

Dear old friend where have you gone?
Now I can`t feel at all what`s right or wrong

Don`t you leave me here alone!

Dear old friend where have you gone?
Now I can`t feel at all what`s right or wrong
