The perfect God makes perfect laws to fit his perfect creation; the man
Apparently not
He died for your sins, he died so you may sin
Murder ends with murder end with murder

Reputation`s like a mirror blinding you
We all know the sum of the whispering game; a twisted message
Trust in Him and you may kill
He`ll kiss you as blood is spilled
Burnt Leviticus with his sinful deeds
He must be no more

"Aaron`s sons Nadab and Abihu took their cencers, put fire in them and added incense;
and they offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, contrary to his command.
So fire came out from the presence of [God] and consumed them, and they died before the Lord"
[Leviticus 10:1-2]

Trust in Him and you may kill
He`ll kiss you as blood is spilled
Burnt Leviticus with his sinful deeds
He must be no more

Face the sinner you justify
Another servant of Satan, of course he died
Which God regrets? Not the perfect one

Reputation`s like a mirror blinding you
We all know the sum of the whispering game; a twisted message

Trust in Him and you may kill
He`ll kiss you as blood is spilled
Burnt Leviticus with his sinful deeds
He must be no more
