This very day you`ll take a last breathe and leave me
I`ve scrubbed myself `til bleed
I cannot make the tiniest mistake, `cos you`ll stab me
You turn lambs to murderers

What? Who shut the light?
My halo used to shine all bright! But now...
I`ve dug out myself in search of worms way deep inside
What now?

Clean, I can never be
Perfection
I hunt but will never catch
Hypochondria, I make a monster of myself because of forbidden fruit

What? Who shut the light?
My halo used to shine all bright! But now...
I`ve dug out myself in search of worms way deep inside
What now?

My halo used to shine
