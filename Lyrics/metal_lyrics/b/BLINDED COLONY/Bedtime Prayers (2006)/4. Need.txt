It`s broken again, it`s broken again
Always the same as no one gains
when everything is perfect
It`s all manufactured with a defect

And since they can live on us we live through them
Yes we live through them

They`re making us needing them in a physical way
They`re making us needing them in a mental way

Now rebellion ain`t no longer old
Che`s face on children`s clothes

Make us never stop needing more
Make us never feel self-assured, `cos we ain`t for sure

And since they can live on us we live through them

I am perfect when naked and unleashed

They`re making us needing them in a physical way
They`re making us needing them in a mental way

Fuck that bloody idea
Take a culture and sell it expensive

It`s all so calculated, it's all so calculated
With perfection it gets so complicated

It`s broken again, it`s broken again!
Always the same as no one gains

And since they can live on us we live through them
Yes we live through them

They`re making us needing them in a physical way
They`re making us needing them in a mental way
