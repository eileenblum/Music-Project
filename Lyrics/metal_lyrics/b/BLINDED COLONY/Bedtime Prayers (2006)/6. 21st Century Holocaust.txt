Hatred awakes from many years of sleep
We need a scapegoat again
I laugh out loud `cos I don`t know what`s worse;
cheap movie speeches or those who believe in them

We move towards the 21st century holocaust
We fear no war `cos we haven`t learned a thing
You dumb fucks!

The shit from out mouths suddenly makes sense
We believe our own lies
It`s so, so much easier to hate than to listen and try to understand

We move towards the 21st century holocaust
We fear no war `cos we haven`t learned a thing
You dumb fucks!
