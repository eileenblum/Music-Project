I will witness it collapse
So it does, just thanks to us
Our many words, not done just heard
We leave this world

I feel so ashamed that we`re to blame
Obvious lie as we all die; once bitten, twice shy

What will make you understand?
Holding death in your hand?

You`ve got a sign in your fucking forehead; slow down or be dead!
But hey, leave it our kids, let`s sleep instead

And when you`ve come to realize it`s way too late
God dammit you HAVE realized and it`s way too late

Once bitten, twice shy?
Then how come we all die?

Await the better days, don`t pull your weight
I`ll laugh when you admit defeat
I feel the taste, we`re laid to waste
Will you stand the heat?

No one`s perfect, no one`s even bloody close
My brain`s my body`s defect, programmed to lose

And when you`ve come to realize it`s way too late
God dammit you HAVE realized and it`s way too late!

Await the better days, don`t pull your weight
I`ll laugh when you admit defeat
I feel the taste, we`re laid to waste
Will you stand the heat?

Once bitten, twice shy?

What will make you understand?
Holding death in your hand?

Await the better days, don`t pull your weight
I`ll laugh when you admit defeat
I feel the taste, we`re laid to waste
Will you stand the heat?
