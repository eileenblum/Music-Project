Fade away in cold memories 
Nothing forfills the needs of a naked soul 
Walls of emptiness speaking without a voice, 
like a dismal ending revealed beyond the sky 

A dead eternity is transforming into life 
Without a trace or pattern ever known to mankind 
An awakening of immortal souls that deny the cross 
A pulse that strikes religion in a griefing sigh 

We will blind your all-seeing eye 
We will end your pandemonium 
A pain sent from another world, 
The true evil lies above 
Confront your chosen destiny 
Transfigure the christian God 
Discrown the holy 
A pain sent from another world, 
The true evil lies above 
Confront your chosen destiny 

Saturate their need for obedience 
Spew out your words of salvation 
Eventually, all your words will die 
A total purgation of your heaven 

A dead eternity is transforming into life 
Without a trace or pattern ever known to mankind 
An awakening of immortal souls that deny the cross 

A pain sent from another world, 
The true evil lies above 
Confront your chosen destiny 
Transfigure the christian God 
Discrown the holy 
A pain sent from another world, 
The true evil lies above 
Confront your chosen destiny 

Holy words without reverence 
An enigmatic trace of mankinds fall 
A dirge for survival 
but it's far to late 

A God of treason kept alive by lies 
A surreptitious Bible of no value 
Your perversion of life has ended 
You're dethroned and discrowned at last 

We will blind your all-seeing eye 
We will end your pandemonium 
A pain sent from another world, 
The true evil lies above 
Confront your chosen destiny 
Transfigure the christian God 
Discrown the holy 
A pain sent from another world, 
The true evil lies above 
Confront your chosen destiny
