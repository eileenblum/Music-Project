Aggressivly forced upon mankind, your ethical rules for living 
Striking fear into humanity to serve your own purpose 
Creating slaves in the name of christ, scared to obedience 
From generation to generation the lie proceeds 

Preaching from your book of holy lies you try to poison our minds 
Your god doesn't exist to me, I'm free to think for myself 
This pillage is unforgiveable, accepting no other beliefs than your own 
Don't think that when you die, you'll go to your precious paradise 

Your paradise is my hell, your belief is my disgust 
After 2000 years of a worthless legacy 

Enslaving the world to be yours alone 
A race of nonthinkers obeying your God 
Builing your Blinded Colony with stinking lies 
You are nothing but greedy hypocrites
