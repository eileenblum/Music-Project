Bleed.. 
Bleed for me 'cause I'm your God 

Franciscus of Asissi, a beloved son of God 
He climbed the world too find the truth and the purity inside 
He wanted the ancient knowledge, the matters of life and death 
And his gift became to bleed the wounds of Christ 

He thought that he had been spellbound by the abyss 
'cause he didn't stop to bleed 
But in fact the wounds was a gift from God 
and a proof of his purity.. a proof of his purity 

Bleed for me 'cause I'm your God 
Bleed the blood of my only son 
Die for me 'cause I'm your God 
Wear the marks of my only son 

Bleed for me 'cause I'm your God 
Bleed the blood of my only son 
Die for me 'cause I'm your God 
Wear the marks of my only son 

Franciscus didn't stop to bleed until he died 
He was the first to wear the marks of Christ 
He was a son of God and so he died 
But would he ever forget what his God had done? 

What kind of God does harm to his servants? 
A god of love? 
What kind of God rules this world? 
A God that failed? A God that failed? 

Bleed for me 'cause I'm your God 
Bleed the blood of my only son 
Die for me 'cause I'm your God 
Wear the marks of my only son 

Bleed for me 'cause I'm your God 
Bleed the blood of my only son 
Die for me 'cause I'm your God 
Wear the marks of my only son 

Messiah's blood fed our God and now we're in your world 
The bloodfeud brought us life so we can reach the mortal souls 
Part God and part Demon, this is what we are 
A race yet unknown to man from the gate that Franciscus opened
