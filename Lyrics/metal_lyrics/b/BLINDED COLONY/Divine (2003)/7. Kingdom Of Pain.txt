All that's left, just remains of human decay 
Traces of extinction in a world of death 

You can not fight, you can not hide 
But still you try to free yourself 
You can not run, not overcome 
Your world is gone and there is nothing you can save 

Powerless human being, defending a dying wrold 
So this is your fantasy of Gods creation? 

There is no way out, this is the kingdom of pain 
This is where you die, here in the kingdom of pain 

Can't you see the truth? Your God is dead 
Is this a dream? Look down deep inside yourself 

You can not fight, you can not hide 
But still you try to free yourself 
You can not run, not overcome 
Your world is gone and there is nothing you can save 

There is no way out, this is the kingdom of pain 
This is where you die, here in the kingdom of pain 

You can not fight, you can not hide 
But still you try to free yourself 
You can not run, not overcome 
Your world is gone and there is nothing you can save 

There is no way out, this is the kingdom of pain 
This is where you die, here in the kingdom of pain
