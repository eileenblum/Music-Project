Tearing, crawling under my skin 
Something behind me, 
something infront of me 
No-one there but still... 

The screams in my head 
The unseen stalker 
The growing nausea 
It's coming, I can hear it 

Blinded by absurdity 
Persecutied by fear, 
From a supremacy unknown 
I consign my life to the black 

Selfobtained paranoia, 
a constant feeling of fear 
Selfobtained paranoia 
a haunted world/death is final 
Forgive me father For I have... 
Praying for something non-existent 
Praying for help... 
No answer, No god 

Insomnia my everyday plague, 
ripping my hair off 
Cutting my veins 
This is my world of self destruction 

The screams in my head 
The unseen stalker 
The growing nausea 
It's coming, I can hear it 

Selfobtained paranoia, 
a constant feeling of fear 
Selfobtained paranoia 
a haunted world/death is final 
I find no solace in the eyes of your God 
I find myself obeying the wishes of my essence 

Searching inside my haunted soul 
Nothing, just empty darkness 
Immortality is the final target 
The immortality of non-existence... 

Selfobtained paranoia, 
a constant feeling of fear 
Selfobtained paranoia 
a haunted world/death is final
