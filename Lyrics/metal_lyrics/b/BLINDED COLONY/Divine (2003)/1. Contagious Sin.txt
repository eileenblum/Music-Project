Mankind is a source of many mysteries 
One of them is the sickness that we all bare 

A frightning virus, extremly contagious 
And every human child is infected 

Taste, see, feel and smell 
Nothing can stop this plague from expanding it's useless to try 
We stand by and look down as you try to save yourself with prayers, 
you're doomed, you will die 

Your sins are saved for the next generation 
And the Bible says that sins will make you burn 
Human souls in neverending agony 
The contagious sin will spread like fire 

Sinners are not hard to recognise 
According to the curch every human is a faliure 
People trapped in their false believes 
A holy crusade fullfilling all the lies 

Taste, see, feel and smell 
Nothing can stop this plague from expanding it's useless to try 
We stand by and look down as you try to save yourself with prayers, 
you're doomed, you will die 

Your sins are saved for the next generation 
And the Bible says that sins will make you burn 
Human souls in neverending agony 
The contagious sin will spread like fire 

Eidemic supremacy 
The world is drowning in filth 
It's their punishment 
It's the contagious sin! 
It's the contagious sin! 
It's the contagious sin!
