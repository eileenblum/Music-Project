A dead dominion, a world without human existence 
Your war of religion has cleansed this planet of life 

I defy your thoughts of a higher purpose 
You're a defamation of your own dying race 

You're living in denial, can't accept the fact 
That the world can live and flourish without your god 
Enticing others to join you, in your life of lies 
The judgement has fallen upon humanity 

Easily persuaded to bow their heads for an idol 
To go into war and slay in blind faith 

I defy your thoughts of a higher purpose 
You're a defamation of your own dying race 

You're living in denial, can't accept the fact 
That the world can live and flourish without your god 
Enticing others to join you, in your life of lies 
The judgement has fallen upon humanity
