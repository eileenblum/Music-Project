Humanity feast again upon the bittersweet agony 
Blameful souls made to serve the persevence 
Carving out the innocence bit by bit 
See the unpure flesh burn 

My morphine is your disbelief 
Your lack of knowledge, your fear of pain, your human weakness. 
An endless search for peace of mind, never resting. 
My morphine is your disbelief 
An idol nailed upon the cross misleading thousands 
Your belief in divinity, your weakness is your fear of God. 

This is the modest modern Messiah 
Serving all the blinded all the mislead 
This is the modest modern Messiah 
Thorned and weak 

Religion, your weak excuse for living 
Denying a lying world you're blinded 
You follow treason till the end 
But your son of nothing fades 

My morphine is your disbelief 
An idol nailed upon the cross misleading thousands 
Your belief in divinity, your weakness is your fear of God. 

This is the modest modern Messiah... 

Cant you see him for the lie that he really is? 
An illusion of past cravings 
No longer required in this dying world 
Your sins did not die with him
