Once again I've seen the dead red sky 
The burning blood in my eyes is my excuse 
A tragic devotion for you 
A memory torn asunder by flames 

My becoming is my remain 
The darkest creation constructed in veins 
A distant euphony which attract the monostry in me 
An asphyxia of my souls last remains 

A souls decay, 
Fragments falling apart 
Ripped to pieces 
By your blame 

Tortured by excistense 
An atrocity of everything holy 
Decline me of my darkness 
Arise demon, arise! 

A souls decay, 
Fragments falling apart 
Ripped to pieces 
By your blame 

The immortal remains of my former life, 
devote themselves into a tribute to chaos 
Open the gates to burning eternity 
Were those of my kind dwell 
The stains on my body reveals my chains of burdon 
What is claimed is forgotten 

The reflection of malice has faded 
Behold my deprivation of life 

A souls decay, 
Fragments falling apart 
Ripped to pieces 
By your blame 

I disguise myself as a human 
I'm only one of an infected race 

Demoniser 666!
