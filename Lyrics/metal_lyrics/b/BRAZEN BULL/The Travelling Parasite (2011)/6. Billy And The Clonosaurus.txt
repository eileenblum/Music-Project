this misanthropy grows inside, now it consumes me 
lemmings sway and shuffle to the cliffs edge 
each one identical, each a unique and beautiful snowflake 
contradicting myself now 
is this a sign of my acceptance? 
as the transparent, carbon copies of life pass by 
I question my own existence 
conform, conform 
life ends one minute at a time, yet it becomes so fulfilling 
when your potential comes crashing down 
should I join? 
is it now time to care? 
observing the mass production, of this modern, template for happiness 
was there ever such thing as freedom? 
did we ever have a choice? 
they continue to pull the strings 
simply puppets in pantomime 
distracted, deceived, and lied to 
they transform us all from Billy 
into just another, insignificant clonosaurus
