dont let the 
dont let the buckle break 
your unrelenting climb suit case lies whatâs inside 
projected words from misshaped stories 
build a mask to match your own 
watch the sheep flock together 
strive to be the shepard 
tighten the notches of impurity 
the top is near donât pity the truth 
kept it in like a jack in 
the box 
watch the cog on your soul 
big smile shake hands with the parasites 
watch the cog on your soul 
climb the chain donât slip on the 
grease 
lucky for that grip you have worked on 
will you reach the dream or in the end will it be just a dream wake up
