here i lye 
dry inside i fight life 
myself struggling suffering 
exhausted deprived 
losing sight 
burning up 
cant give up now 
my soul the pain this canes try 
savagely slowly scurrying to exist 
hope fades in each harsh sunset 
sleep, rise, is this the way that i die 
time ticks on will I survive 
each breath i choke on the dust in my lung 
every step is a mission over and beyond beyond 
strain feeling the burn 
there is nothing left 
pain unrelenting fatigue 
i push through the plains with a crooked crawl 
scratching at the barren earth 
scraping up survival 
sighted 
just another distorted image 
a fake hope a unwanted pleasantry 
set back the push 
becomes the pull 
horizons with no end 
a platoed view 
sparse environment 
gripping at the will to live
