lying here on the couch viewing the blankness 
Iâm trying to watch TV 
but I donât know what Iâm watching 
Itâs so lonely here 
me myself &amp; I reside in the night 
I want to sleep but it just wonât come it wonât come 
Iâm so tired of hurting and being alone 
I keep thinking about the pills in the cabinet but Iâm scared 
My head hurts so much from crying but if I take anything for it Iâm scared 
I wonât stop and I would want to stop 
want to stop 
I donât have any choice in the matter 
to make everything 
I canât make it right by living 
Iâm so scared I want out but oh I donât know 
Iâm so cold 
please do something 
I canât stand this 
empty feeling that Iâm having 
my head is horrible 
stop the pounding hurts so much 
stop 
I have no control over 
anything in my life. Iâm breaking into pieces. Somebody do something
