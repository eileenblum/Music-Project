lapping through the shallow 
touch and turn on ends 
happiness this brings 
decline of spine 
where to stay tonight 
float to feel alright 
I just donât feel right 
make a call to fight 
fine allude 
coach me to my fall 
tell me control me teach me 
letâs do this together 
form a bond to end all bonds one strong hold to lose all grasps 
swim away 
why Iâm still floating 
im still floating 
now Iâve found the way that pulls me down
