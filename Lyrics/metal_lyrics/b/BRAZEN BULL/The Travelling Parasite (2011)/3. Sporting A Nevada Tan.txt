I wonder why I did it If I thought and acted properly it wouldn't have happened.
I would like to apologise I saw that drama. I thought I'd do it that way 
in class still quiet washed upon a red ocean 
now where has she been at lunch time 
the bell is in i return to learn 
she paid Iâm fine Iâm right they noticed 
now find life 
sit down sit down 
cut the box open 
this way 
this to me 
how could you write this to me 
how could you write 
we used to play basketball
