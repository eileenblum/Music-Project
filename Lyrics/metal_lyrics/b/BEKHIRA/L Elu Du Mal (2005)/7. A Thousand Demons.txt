Admire sadness spilling in thier life
Disheartening those human worms
Heartrending thier hopes
To burn thier empty souls

A Thousand Fires, A Thousand Demons
Which burn all hopes of the so-called christ

A Thousand Fires, A Thousand Demons
We will enjoy to see the pain

We are waiting for the primordial torrent
We'll laugh watching humans dying

Only dark creatures will be still there
In the name of The Lord Chaos - Satan

A Nation will survive, maybe more
But Legions of Satan as we are
Will be still there to crush all kind of human life

Admire sadness spillin in thier life
Disheartening those human worms
Heartrending thier hops
To Burn their empty souls
