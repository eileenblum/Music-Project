Traitors don't deserve to die in dignity
Shame to those who betrayed Blood
Shame to those who run away from death

Traitors of the race will be banished
Traitors of the Demon race

Impure Blood shall flow - evil prevails
The Sombre Throne will be ours
We are climbing the steps
To Dark Victory

We, Demons and Children of
All that is Evil will triumph
Beyond the Death and accept
The Black Fate

We will fight with the Prince of Darkness
Our Father
