You're standing in front of
The gate of a new dimension
No one leads you
To the right decision

Burn remains, deny
Steal my soul, convey
Purswading sin inside I will be
No one understand my tears
Recollecting all, my fate but now rise

The wrong determines your life
Your life creates the pain
The world of shadows
Leads your wandering spirit

Burn remains, deny
Steal my soul, convey
Purswading sin inside I will be
No one understand my tears
Recollecting all, my fate but now rise
