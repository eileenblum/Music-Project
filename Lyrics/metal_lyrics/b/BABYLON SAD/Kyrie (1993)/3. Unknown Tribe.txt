Chained up all speeches and eeds
A book, a god, that's all their needs
Baptized under the voke of the ten
Do you dare to destroy them

I have decided and I think I should become a homosexual
Murder and shall get hold of young boys and bring
Them here where I am staying and I shall rape them and then
Kill them, I should not kill all the boys in the same way

Preparing worlds's end
With weapons the church has sent
Chosen to praise the false
In the mirror seeing the race

I have decided...
