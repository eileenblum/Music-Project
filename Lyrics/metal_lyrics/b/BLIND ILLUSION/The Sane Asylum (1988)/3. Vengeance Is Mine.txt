[M. Biedermann / M. Miner / G. Gilson]

Eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
You'll get yours
Before it's through

Living war
Up to your knees in blood
What are you dying for?
Peace and love?

Kill for peace
Kill for land
Killing time?
Vengeance is mine

Blood is thicker than water
Land is worth more than gold
Oil leads man to the slaughter
Greed will eat at your soul

Terrorists threaten our streets
So now they are mine fields
All powers will be unleashed
When killing is fashion we all must kill
