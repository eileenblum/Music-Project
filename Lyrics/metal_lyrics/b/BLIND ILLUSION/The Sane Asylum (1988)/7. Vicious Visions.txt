[M. Biedermann]

Voices ringing burns my ears
I see faces in the mirror
Defying gravity in my sleep
As I fly from dream to dream
And I dream.....

Ancient future blinds my eyes
Silencing screams that hypnotize
Ask myself what do I see?
No one's there to answer me

One day man will read what's written
Decide to steal what he wasn't given
Deadly knowledge twisting scriptures
Tapping into Hell's computer

Vicious visions warning you
Remember to forget what you once knew
Vicious visions telling me
Don't forget to remember what you used to be

Heed these words
Don't listen to me
Unless you've no fear
Of what you might see

Vicious visions
