[M. Biedermann]

When politicians refuse
To open their eyes
The world is blind
The future will cry

The mud will turn red
And the living are dead
When madmen rule the land
They'll be carrying out the plan

Do you understand?
You, me, them... kill!

Bloodbath - Death Trap
Walking down the sandmans path
Turning your head from side to side
No place to run, No place to hide

The middle east will ride the beast
They're preparing now, for the feast
We watch them as we sleep
Their menu is prepared, it's you they want to eat

The main course
For their holy war

Blood shower - Poison flower
Madmen sitting in the top of their towers
Rape the innocent until the final hour
When they're the only ones left to be devoured
