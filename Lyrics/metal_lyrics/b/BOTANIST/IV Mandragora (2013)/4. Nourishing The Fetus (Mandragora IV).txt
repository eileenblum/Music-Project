Gestation in womb complete
From mausoleum unearthed
Conjuration's final phase
Shrieking horror to cleanse the earth

In bovine lactose drown
Faunal sacrifice
Of chiroptera three
Magic philter source of life

From wax to wane
Human figure root
Drink deep

At satiety's end
Before hearth ablaze
Crackling flames
Verbena fire's warmth

Mandragora awake
