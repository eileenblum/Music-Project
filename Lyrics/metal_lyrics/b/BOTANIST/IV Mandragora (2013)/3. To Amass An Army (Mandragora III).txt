"The Budding Dawn is war
And war requires soldiers
Soldiers to bring about
The apocalypse of man"

"Seek the briony root
And raise the mandrake legion"

Where fetus rests
'Neath the hanged corpse
Vernal equinox await
Upon the day of the moon, disinter
Confide on a field of human death
Within the tombs of men
Amongst sepulchral remains
Fetus holy place

"The Budding Dawn is war
And war requires soldiers
Soldiers to bring about
The apocalypse of man"
