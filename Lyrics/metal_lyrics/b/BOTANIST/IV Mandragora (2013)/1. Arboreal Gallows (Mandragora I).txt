Pagan rite
Invoke the gods of the trees
Dangling in the boughs
Human prey held high

Their necks snapped irrevocably
Penance for their crimes
Atonement for their sins
From their death shall spring life

Death throes ejaculate
From the corpses plummet
Into earth imbibe
To sow the seed of the nightshade
Mandragore arise
