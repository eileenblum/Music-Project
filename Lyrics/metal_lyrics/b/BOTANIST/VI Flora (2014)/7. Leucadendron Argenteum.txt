The light shimmers off velvet leaves
Silver-sheened guardian beacons
Floral constellation glimmering majestic
Argent protea

Globose inriflorescences carried by the wind
Silken veils perfume the air

Like the fiercest fire
Leucadendron's life burns fast
From the flames of purification it rises anew
To shine on once again
