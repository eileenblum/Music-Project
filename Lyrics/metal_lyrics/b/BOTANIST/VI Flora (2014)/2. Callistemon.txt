Callistemon's thirst must be quenched
Legion thirty-four strong
Come the vernal equinox
Burst forth

Coaxed by flame
Seed capsules explode
From within smoldering stamens
As pollinated filaments turn to ash

Teeming with hepialid larvae
Its bark writhes with life
Burrowed deep within
To later take flight
