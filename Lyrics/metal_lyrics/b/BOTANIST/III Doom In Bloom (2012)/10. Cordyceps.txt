From the kingdom of the fungi comes this evil spore
Dwelling in the Amazon it lives forever more
Endoparasitical, as it invades its host
And like a sly assassin, causing terror like a ghost
A particular and most aggressive evil variant

The Unilateralis Cordyceps is not a friend
Spores that are inhaled advance towards a certain kill
It causes ants to zombify and let them do its will
Crawling in disorientation victims of this skulk
Their non-vital soft tissues being eaten by the bulk

Time comes, the mycelia network readies its parade
It soon enters the brain and then it seals its ugly fate
Climbing up a stem like a convict the guillotine
The mycelia gets the ant where it wants to be seen
And when it causes mandibles to anchor at the top
The cordiceps will burst the skull - to harvest and to crop

And finally the killer spore is breeding for a while
A matter of some days and then it will proceed in style
The fruiting bodies, sporocarps, appear and rupture, then
The spores spread forth their plague and soon contaminate again!

From the kingdom of the fungi comes this evil spore
Dwelling in the Amazon it lives forever more
Endoparasitical, as it invades its host
And like a sly assassin, causing terror like a ghost
