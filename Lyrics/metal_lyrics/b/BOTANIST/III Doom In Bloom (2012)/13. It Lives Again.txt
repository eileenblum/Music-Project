Heracleum Mantegazzianum
This royal beast
Destroyer of great cities in revenge
Dead and forgotten by the world
Now planted again
Taking mutated root
in the great gardens
of the Botanist
Awaiting his word
To strike out in anger
Threaten the human race,
Besiege their precious cities
Lay waste to their flesh and blood
With giant hogweed hairs.

"Blind their eyes
Disrupt the nucleus
Lay waste to flesh and blood

You royal beast
Destroyer of great cities in revenge
You are my warriors now,
And my word is anger."
