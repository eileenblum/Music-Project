Denying hood of priests stands the learned man
In ceremonial skins of Lappish rites
Ingest the holy flesh
Beat the drum of ancients

Tribes of the north
Wisdom of God
Let the visions come
The seer presides over
In shamanistic sight
Birthing future orders
Scouring the kingdom
Quest of sacred knowledge
So the names are given
Inscribed upon the world

Awake the sage in flame of the family lamiacaeae
Instate his reign â binomial taxonomy
Von Linne enthroned eternally

By thine order may we know the flowers of the butcher's block
And by knowing the war of all against all
May ye know God

Stamens, pistils
Recall organs of lust
Repulse foolish masses
The foe bestowed unto the weeds

In the hooks of every burr
And the seeds that fall in cracks of rocks
And germinate to shatter the earth
There is His order shown, now know the Lord

As the tendrils choke the garden
And as the orchardâs ripest fruit
Is devoured by beasts and life springs from their dung
So may we know the kingdom

By thine order may we know the flowers of the butcher's block
And by knowing the war of all against all
May ye know God
