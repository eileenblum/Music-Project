In churning cauldron imbibe
Pulverized acrid salvation
To drink immortality
While the others wither and die

Coumerin anticoagulation
Blood runs free
From mana mystic

Never grow old

Polyphoric guardian
Bitterness is my salvation
Mycelian hyphae thrombocyte
Live on
Live on

May I live for ever
And ever more
My flesh sustained
By the fungus Ganoderma
Lucidum immortal
While the others wither and die
