Three-headed guardian flora
Of actinomorphic corolla
In swampy marsh it grows
Foreboding harbinger of death

From its nectar, suicide
Lit aflame, its evil spreads
As it burns, murder
Poisonous smoke fills the air
Cerberin
Beating heart stopped dead
Apocynaceae

Mangrove
Those whose fruits consume
Shall cross the marshy banks
Of the river Styx
Return passage denied
By floral guardian of heads three
Forevermore
