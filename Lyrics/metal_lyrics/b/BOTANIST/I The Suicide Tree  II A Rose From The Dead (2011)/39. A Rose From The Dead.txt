War-torn land
Desolation
Floral slaughter
Desecration
Ruin as far as the eye can see

From the deathfield 
Solitary entity blooms
Up from the wasteplains
A rose from the dead

Spreading its roots farther
Strengthening hold
Biding its time
Till flora reigns supreme

One day, the turn will be theirs
Downfall of the human filth
Careless suicide, murder malign
Their end shall mark a new era
The age of the Verdant Realm

Upon the grave of mankind my flowers will grow
Tear shed only for the loss of the verdurous
Monolith marking the passing
Of an age of waste
And the arrival of a budding dawn
