Iridaceae
Eyes of black
About which crimson swirls

Wheel of fire
Sinister gaze
Perdition
At the wandflowerâs wave
Demise

Limestone denizen
Of tepals six
Stemmed cormels and
Coiled anthers
Leering
Dormant corms
Soon will awake

Ixieae
Sword-shaped leaves
Bladed star
Signals your demise
Sparaxis
Perdition
