Hallowed halls of Arecaceae
Adorned in fanned petioles
Spiny needles sharp
Jut menacing

In the hall of Chamaerops
Dioecious megametophytic spores
Scent the air
Released by flowers obscure
Borne in clusters dense

Amongst these corridors I wander
In misanthropic mirth
Brooding deep
Flanked by verdant brethren
