In darkness, Euonymous burns
Deciduous prince
Of Celastrales lineage proud

Above, ravenous
Frugivorous raptors circle
Royal servants of propagation
Instruments of princely immortality
Their prize, valved pods of red
Beckoning amidst serrated thrones

To he who should venture within these realms, woe
Misanthrope, within princely flesh wrath
Contempt for all mankind
Sickness and plague upon those who would consume him
As winged beasts leer above
