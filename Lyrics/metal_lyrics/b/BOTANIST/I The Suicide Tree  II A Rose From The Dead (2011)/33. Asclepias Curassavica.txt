Blood cyme silk
Asclepiadasceae
Lepidopteral ally
Poison to the filth called man

Pale grey stems
Oblong, lanceolate leaves
Ending acuminate
Corona lobes of orange

Fusiform follicles yielding seed
Floating on air, floral propagation
Rise anew afar
To further poison the filth called man
