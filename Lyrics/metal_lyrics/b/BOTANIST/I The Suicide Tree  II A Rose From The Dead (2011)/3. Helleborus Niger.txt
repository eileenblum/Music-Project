From ancient Antikyra
Risen from maiden tears
Magnoliopsida
Upon highest icycled peaks it grows

Flowered five-pointed star
Dark pedated leather
Evergreen
Wintery frost it weathers
Helleborus Niger

Upon wooden slats
In times immemorial
Hellebore strewn
Evil, begone

Sorceror
Adepts of darkness
Its black powder
In the air they cast
Through the world of men they moved
Undetected

Ranunculaceae
Poisonous, burning wrath
Hematemesis, vomiting blood
As the world spins uncontrollable
Helleborus Niger
