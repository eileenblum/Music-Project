By dark botanical magic summon
A seat of winter cold
Hibernal incantation
Invoke Veltheimiaâs throne

Undulating leaves below majestic umbel
Amass in frigid months
Under eternal snowfall
And icy blasts of wind
There shall I reign

Organic cathedra mighty
Formed by tubular raceme dense
Converge in chaos tangles

Seated there in solitary, sylvan authority
The world from afar I watch
From my post of entropy
Thronged by floral alliance
I await the fall of time
And the Armageddon of mankind
