Rosette of seven
Petiole blade lethal
Strangled in cilia
Anthocyanin death

Arachnid quarry upon fibers walk
Redundant triggering flash of demise
Trichomes close upon hapless prey
Napthoquinone plumbagin
Enzymatic end catalyzed
Proteolytic doom

In fire it laughs
As the world around it burns
Through cold strength it gathers
To rise again supreme
