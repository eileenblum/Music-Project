Chill and grim, the coming dawn
Seems a century away
For mist and dark first brought them here
And in dark and mist they slay

Arrows arching through the night
Bring flame within our walls
And spells they've sent to steal our souls
Hold many here in thrall

[Chorus]
Night is a fantasy take it away
Metal's unreal in the morning
These five million warriors 
Belong in a dream
You'll wake up if you scream out a warning
Night siege

So chill and grim, the castle now
Our prison and our grave
Yet, surely dawn will slay these fiends
If it comes in time to save

[repeat chorus twice]
