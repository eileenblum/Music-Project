I know 
You know
We know
That it's time to rock n' roll

I know 
You know
We know
That it's time to rock n' roll

Heard it on the radio
Seen it on the streets
Drives my mother crazy
But oh how I love the beat

Nothin' else I'd rather do
There's nothin' else for me
Standing up in front of you
For all of you to see

We're here to rock
We're here to roll you
We're here to rock
We're here to rock n' roll

I know 
You know
We know
That we're  gonna tear the roof down

I know 
You know
We know
That tonight it's comin' down
Comin' down

Heard it on the radio
Seen it on the streets
Drives my mother crazy 
But oh how I love the beat

Nothin' else I'd rather do
Nothin' else for me
Heavy metal music's what I need
to set me free

We're here to rock
We're here to roll you
We're here to rock
We're here to rock and roll

Come on, come on, come on,
We're here to rock n' roll
