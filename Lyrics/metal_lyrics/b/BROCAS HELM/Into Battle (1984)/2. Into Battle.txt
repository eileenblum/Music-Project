Into battle 
Into battle we ride
Throught the dark forest
With halberd by my side
In to battle
Into battle we ride
I've got the memory
Of my lady love deep down inside

And I'm crying
The demon lives in the king
Crying
His fire burns without sin

Broken hearted
Broken hearted I ride
I know I'll never see
My queen my love alive

Who is to blame
For the misery of I
You'll find the answer
If you stare the single eye

And I'm crying
The demon lives in the king
Crying
His fire burns without sin

Into battle
Into battle we fly
In my metal fortress
With my lazer at my side

Nothing has changed
The game's played the same
We fight the battles 
So the foolish kings may reign

Oh I'm crying
The demon lives in the king
Crying 
His fire burns without sin
