In a twilight blue and shadowed
As the faintest stars were born
In a month of summers ending
Earth's peace was shattered by a storm

Came a rider helmed with lightning
Racing down the skies
Magic weapon in his hands
And madness in his eyes

Lifting high his blade of music
To the world again he comes
Scarlet-eyed and masked in metal
Summoned by the battle drums

The sky is filled with screaming music
Anthem to a dream of hell
Lashing men to killing madness
The song of war will cast it's spell

In a twilight blue and shadowed
As the faintest stars were born
In a month of summers ending
Earth's peace was shattered by a storm

Warrior of both past and future
Let your magic sing
Chimes of peace or battle thunder
Which message do you bring?

Thunder rider, cloaked in darkness
The past burns in your eyes
On the quest for ancient treasure
Do you know where it lies?

Dark horseman
Caped in shadow
Sliding down the wind
Stranger to this place and time
Where will you begin?
