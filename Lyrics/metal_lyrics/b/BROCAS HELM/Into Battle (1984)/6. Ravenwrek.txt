Young man full of power
Sparkle in his eyes
Rock n' roll his only desire
Practiced until he died

On a ship he called the Raven
He would meet his doom
With the wind and spirits howling
He faded into blue

Ravenwreck
Sailing the sea
Ravenwreck
Eternally

Electric guitars and amplifiers
Strung stem to stern
He made a sound of monstrous power
Never before heard

His friends said he was a crazy high flyer
So they left him that day
With the sounds of guitars crying
He sailed away

Ravenwreck
Sailing the sea
Ravenwreck
Eternally

Ravenwreck
Sailing the sea
Ravenwreck
Eternally
