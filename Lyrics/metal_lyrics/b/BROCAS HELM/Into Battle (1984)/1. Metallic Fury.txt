Blackness is my music
Dark silver my guitar
Starlight feeds my power
Of flashing metal

Crescent moon must find me
Within a smoke of screams
Flames fingering my body
Wind howling through my dreams

I live in metallic fury
It seems I'm in control
For my fingers bring the thunder
To this storm called rock and roll

The songs afire inside me
Atingle with my fears
Will blaze and shriek a silence
That only you can hear

Blackness is my music 
Dark silver my guitar
Starlight feed my power 
Of flashing metal
