I stand before you, do you remember me
Or has it been too long ago
We used to sing and dance in the rain
It didn't matter if we had any money
But now those days are gone

Oh oh I'm not crying anymore
But you never kissed me goodbye
You never kissed me goodbye
You never kissed me goodbye baby oh no

Crazy winds they start to blow
Telling me what I already know
You play your games but you don't play to win
Now I find you've list it once again

Oh oh I'm not crying anymore
I wouldn't have it another way
Oh oh I'm not crying anymore
I wouldn't have it another way

In the end will begin again
And I'll show you what it means to be in love again
Until that day don't go too far away my love
You know you're always in my heart

Oh oh I'm not crying anymore
But there's just one little thing
You never kissed me goodbye
You never kissed me goodbye baby
Oh no

And I never forgot it!

Oh oh I'm not crying anymore
You never kissed me goodbye
You never kissed me goodbye
You never kissed me goodbye baby
Oh no
