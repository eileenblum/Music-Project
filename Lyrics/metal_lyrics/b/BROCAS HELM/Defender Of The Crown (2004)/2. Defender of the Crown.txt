Down from the Heavens, up from the sea
They came looking, looking for me
They'll never find me, I'll never tell
The stories they've written, are rooted in Hell

Again comes a rider, His eyes burning red
Sword to his side, Metal on head
He is your savior, He'll save your soul
Protect him well, Never let go

Somewhere there's someone who's looking for me
And if he finds me I'll never be free
Somewhere that someone he calls out my name
Hand me a sword and I'll go insane
DEFEND THE CROWN

Defender of the crown and of all that you survey
God save the King
Defender of the crown and of all that you survey
Set my people free

Ride with me brother, And never look back
Grasp hold the Glory, Repel the attack
Take what I give you, Call it your own
Live for the Metal, Rise to the throne

Somewhere there's someone who's looking for me
And if he finds me I'll never be free
Somewhere that someone he calls out my name
Hand me a sword and I go insane

Somewhere theirs someone who's looking for me
And if he finds me I'll never be free
Somewhere that someone he calls out my name
Hand me a sword and I go insane

DEFEND THE CROWN
