Children of the Nova Dawn
Screaming starship sailors
Ride unicorns of steel and silver
Howling thru the black and diamond gates
Of Antares
Planet seekers
builders of a new Magic

We slip thru melting pearl of moon
Searching thru the endless night
Longing for the endless light
Chasing starfire sorcery

Children of a new beginning
Ice jewels are our chain mail

The burning blood of the sun
We are always one
Starting from forever
Paint the sky with rockets

The burning blood of the sun
We are always one
Starting from forever
Paint the sky with rockets

We are children of the Nova dawn
Children that is where we are from
We are Children of the Nova Dawn
Children that is where were from

Children of the Nova dawn
Children from far beyond
Children of the Nova dawn
Children, Children, we are just children

The burning blood of the sun
We are always one
Starting from forever
Paint the sky with rockets
