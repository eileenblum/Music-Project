I heard the music in my sleep
Silence broken dark and deep
Return me
to a time of innocence

When a man could live by metal
His honor and his blade
Something never seen
Something like a dream

Then the world comes in and
you start to scream
something like a ghost story
a ghost story

They walk the halls of endless night
Without the past, without the light
Windows to nothing in their eyes
I look at them and freeze inside

Death is walking with his bride
Bones are scattered in the tide
Nothings wrong, nothings right
Insanity is king

Then the world falls in and
you start to scream
something like a ghost story
a ghost story

Where is the exit
Where is the door
Why do I think
I been here before

I heard the music
In my sleep
Silence came
Then dark and deep

Then the world comes in and
you start to scream
something like a ghost story
a ghost story
