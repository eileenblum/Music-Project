Crushing down the motorway six pack by my side
You know I really need it girl, it keeps me alive
I've got old number 7 in the back seat,
For good measure

Have you ever seen the way these people drive?
It makes me wonder why I'm still alive
Makes me think,
I need another drink

[Chorus:]
Drink and drive, I drink and drive
Got mothers against me I'm still alive
Drink and drive, I drink and drive
Got mothers against me I'm still alive

Everywhere I go I see the signs
Their all trying to sell me something I don't need to buy
When I'm behind the wheel
Of my automobile

When I'm low on petrol I know where to go
I can fill up my tank and get a six pack for the road
How can it be?
So damn' easy

[Chorus]

Now I've finally come to see the lights
Brightly flashing in my eyes
Johnny went and dragged me and said
Kid be glad you're alive
Now I've come to realize
All they ever told me were lies

[Chorus]

Now I'm riding the bus and I don't like it too much
Doing county time and I'm paying a fine
You see I really need,
I really need a drink

Don't listen to me just let the booze flow
But I ain't gonna drink it when
I'm back on the road
I ain't gonna drink and drive no more

[Chorus]
