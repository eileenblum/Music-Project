Lovers of the dark, step into the light
We know your brave, you've come to see us dream
Many times before, now we open up a door
To a world so flaming bright, a world you've never seen
Can you hear the Banshee scream
Can you hear the Banshee scream
Can you hear the Banshee scream

You know that silence
Is not our middle name
Can you recognize the game
Step into the gate and
Grasp the hand of fate

It's a time machine, a devil's dream
And yet it's in your grasp
Legends of the past
Can you hear the Banshee scream

Banshee howling in the city
Means a knight has died
For what reason for what glory
Who knows for what pride
Country king or criminal

War or vengeance, what the Hell
Death is all the same
If he died in shame or Honor
Who on Earth can tell

Lovers of the dark, step into the night
We know your brave, you've come to see us dream
Many times before, now we open up the door

To a world so flaming bright, a world you've never seen
Can you hear the Banshee scream
Can you hear the Banshee scream
Can you hear the Banshee scream

Lovers of the dark, step into the light
Can you hear the banshee
Can you hear the Banshee scream
