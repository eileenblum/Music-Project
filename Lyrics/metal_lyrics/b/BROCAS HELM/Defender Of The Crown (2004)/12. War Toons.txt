With battle lance and missile flash
Man kind begins and ends
Salute the dark with crimson wine
And offerings of skin

Incense of flesh and blood we burn
As tribal music swells
From mother earth and sun we turn
To kiss the queen of hell

War toons
Laugh and cry
War toons
Laugh and die

Angel of darkness
Send us your grace
Who among us
Hasn't sought your face

Goddess of death
Feathered in steel
We offer you our selves
In bullets breath and soul

War toons
Laugh and cry
War toons
Laugh and die

Angel of darkness
Send us your grace
Who among us hasn't
Sought your face

Goddess of death
Feathered in steel
We offer you ourselves
In bullets breath and soul

War toons
Laugh and cry
War toons laugh
And die
We sacrifice
The strong and brave
We sacrifice
The mindless slave

Black can be white
Or shades of grey
But red is all the same

War toons
Laugh and cry
War toons
Laugh and die
