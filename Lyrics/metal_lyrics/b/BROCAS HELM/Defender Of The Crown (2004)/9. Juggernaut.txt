In the beginning
There was light
Focus the beam
Now we use it to fight
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
In the end
you will rock with us
Juggernaut roll
Down the mountain
Crash the gates
Unlock the door
Junggernaut roll
Like a wheel
Crash the gates
Give me the key to my soul
Down from the heavens and up from the sea
They came looking, looking for me
They'll never find me cause I'll never tell
The stories they've written are rooted in hell
We will rock
Roll
Like a juggernaut
We will roll all over you
Ah ah ah ah oh
Juggernaut you will roll
Like a wheel
Give me the key to my soul
