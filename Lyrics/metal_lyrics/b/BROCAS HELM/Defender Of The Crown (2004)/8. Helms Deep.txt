In the month of the dragon
In the dark of the moon
Can you see the reflection
In the mirror of doom

In the glass of the Wizard
The picture was clear
Gean's marching to battle
With their weapons of fear

Helm's deep
Helm's deep

At the edge of nightfall
We must make a stand
For the chain of the beast
Has been placed in our hands

The key to the power
The key to the light
We march into battle
To slay the dragon tonight

Ride hard
Down low
Where the dark
Refuse to go
Draw the circle
Break the sleep
Slay the Dragon
To helm's deep
