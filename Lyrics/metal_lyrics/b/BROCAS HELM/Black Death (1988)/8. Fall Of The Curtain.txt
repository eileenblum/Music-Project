The fall of the curtain
Brings a tear to my eye
The fall of the curtain
A reason to cry
Release your prisoners
Release them all
Tear down your curtain
Tear down your wall

The wall of death surrounds you
The answer can be found
You will find
your new beginnings
From dreams you left behind

A new day is dawning
Leave yesterday behind
Tear down the curtain
Unleash your mind

You have the knowledge
Realize you hold the key
You have the power
To set your people free

Soon the wall will shatter
A better life for all
Free to live your dreams
In a world with no more walls
