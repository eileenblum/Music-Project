Black death on the water 
Black death in the air
Black death on the insects
Who nest in my hair

Black death all around us
Black death coming fast
Black death is the reason
That your kind won't last

Ring around the rosie
Pocket full of posie
Ashes, Ashes
We all fall down

Black death all around us
Black death at my feet
Black death is the reason
It's unsafe to eat

Don't you come around here
If your want to last
If you don't like it 
We'll kick your bloody ass

Around every corner
In every town
The feeling of death
It won't get me down

I'll fight to the finish
I'll fight till I die
Black death is the reason
You all shall die
