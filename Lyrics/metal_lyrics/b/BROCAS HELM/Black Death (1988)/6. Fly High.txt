Looking for answers
Searching to find
Is it more than a nightmare
Or is it my mind

What I've seen in my dreaming
I know we must flee
A black cloud from
a dark world
Has cast it's spell on me

Fly
Away from here
I want to fly high
Away from here

Ready for action
Ready to roll
The plague of the Dark Lord
Has taken control

Let's find a rainbow
And climb on it's light
Soon we shall battle 
With the armies of the night

Search for answers 
Search to find
More than a nightmare
In my mind

What I've seen
I know we must flee
A dark cloud 
Hangs over me

End of a nightmare
I rise to find
I am not sleeping at all
And there's no place to hide
