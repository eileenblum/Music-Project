[Lyrics by Jean Schumacher]

Demons arise
Your dragon's fire
is dying

A blood red wind is crying
Demon armies
Fill the sky

Kings and Princes
In you power
Make laws to keep us chained

Deaf and dumb 
Now look, now listen
Your beasts have gone insane

War is coming
Killing thunder
With lasers and with steel

The whip you hold 
Has lost it's bite
Revenge shall turn the wheel

Bastards arise
We bring you death
Touch our lightning

Take our metal 
Take our dreams 
Into a sleep 
Of endless screams
