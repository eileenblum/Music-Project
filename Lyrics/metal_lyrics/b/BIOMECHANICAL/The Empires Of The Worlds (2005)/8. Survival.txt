Indestructible
Designed human soul
Spitting blood at all
We shan't become tomorrow
Instinct wakes inside you

Look around, you are sin
Plagued, diseased dead within
All this time
Have you ever tried to fight your life?

Survival, Survival
You cant control your biological revival
Procreate to spread hereditary violence
Evolution of the species in defiance
Never letting go

Inconceivable
Subsistence veiled... Untruth
Turn the page and reveal
We're all one blood distorted
Free will sleeps inside you

Look around, you are sin
Plagued, diseased dead within
All this time
Have you ever tried to fight your life?

Survival, Survival
You cant control your biological revival
Procreate to spread hereditary violence
Evolution of the species in defiance
Never letting go

We're victims of our cellular conventions
Relayed through embryonic generations
I fight this plague of parasitic vengeance
Never you will be
Never will you see what I can see

Look around, you are sin
Plagued, diseased dead within
All this time
Have you ever tried to fight your life?

Survival, Survival
You cant control your biological revival
Procreate to spread hereditary violence
Evolution of the species in defiance
Never letting go

You can never tell me what I can or cannot do
You can never show me what I can or cannot do
You will never dictate me what I can or cannot do
You will never tell me what I can or cannot do

This is my survival
