[originally by Judas Priest]Faster than a bullet terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger he is half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller this is the Painkiller

Planets devastated mankind is on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies in answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder blasting bolts of steel
Evil is going under deadly wheels
He is the Painkiller this is the Painkiller

Faster than a lazer bullet louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured they have been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
He is the Painkiller this is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller deadly wheels Painkiller
He is the Painkiller this is the Painkiller
Painkiller cannot stop the Painkiller
