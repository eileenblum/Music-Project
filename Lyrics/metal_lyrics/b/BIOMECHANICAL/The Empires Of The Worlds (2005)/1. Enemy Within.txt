Arise of fear, no spawn of mine
Diseased, unamed, unleashed, alive

Turn my head to face another direction
Everlasting pain of a hollow deception
Can you tell me how to rid this infection?
All the time I feel it tearing within me
Parasitic vengeance rising before thee
Can you feel it growing, feeding inside me?

Don't forgive me now

I thought I had fallen in fear
Disappeared, though so near
Beneath the darkness forever

Retribution
Of the soul
Dissolution
You're the enemy within

Don't you know I'm you're slave no more?
Master, unbound, ruler of all

Blistering the undeniable shake down
Look around to see society break down
Desecration of the core, inner meltdown
The enemy will never fall to the pilgrim
Sick of sin I drink the bile of my victims
Teach me how to
Keep 'em alive for the maiming

Don't forgive me now

I thought I had fallen in fear
Disappeared, though so near
Beneath the darkness forever

Retribution
Of the soul
Dissolution
You're the enemy within

Lay waste and conspire to redeem my mind
Inspire my defeat I will seek
retribution of the soul
dissolution, you're the enemy within

The enemy within... I'm the enemy within

'Always around you... staring back
From the core of darkness'.
'I'm the source, I'm the cause,
I am consequence,'
