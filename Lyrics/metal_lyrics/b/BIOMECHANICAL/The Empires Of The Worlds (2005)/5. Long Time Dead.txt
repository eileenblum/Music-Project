I rise again
Clawing at the veils
Awakening my thoughts
To what has never been

Iâm reaching out
Blinded by the darkness still...
I feel what truth is left for me

Unending dreams

Beyond where I have been, just lies deceit

Unspoken words now told
And so the truth reveals

...âFight this fear
Infuse the liesâ...

â...break the fear
Unleash the lies...â

For what I am
Eternal hate can never break me inside Iâm alive
Condemn my heart, condemn my soul
But feel the light pulsating me alight
Now I know, yes I know
Iâve been a long time dead

Un recognised
Always Iâve been there
Unseen I walk through the recollections once again

Un-compromised
Not bound by worlds of the enslaved
Unnamed I rules the darkest skies
...that now imprison me

For what I am
Eternal hate can never break me inside Iâm alive
Condemn my heart, condemn my soul
But feel the light pulsating me alight
Now I know, yes I know
for what I am is what I am
I've never been I've never breathed
Iâve been a long time dead

For what I am
Eternal hate can never break me inside Iâm alive
Condemn my heart, condemn my soul
But feel the light pulsating me alight
For what I am is what I am
Eternal hate cant break me
Condemn my heart, condemn my soul
But feel the life pulsating

For what I am is what I am
I've never been I've never breathed

Throughout my life
I've always known
The poisonous lies
I've been fed through intravenously
My very soul instills
The fear of a long time dead
