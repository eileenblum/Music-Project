Break out of me
The end and the beginning
Fighting me wont erase the lies, forgiving has

Passed beyond
This divine assimilation
No faith, no fear, no lies just instant killing

Void of light
Sheds the dark I now see clearly
What will be
Frozen faces, eyes revealing
Ages of search for internal absolution
From within decay and rot I see me
It cant be undone!!

See through me this pain this fear
This uncontrollable corrosion
Acetic rain pours down on me
Impure and sinful fuses my skin

With inner death - soul decay
The essence of my existenz

Strike
Cant break me
I know I am forever
See my past
Poison refined through trepidation
What I am
Warfare, pure annihilation

No faith no fear no lies just instant killing

Go beyond
Boundaries of strength, unbroken
Strand of fate
Predetermined life
Unspoken is this truth
consumed by ignorance our spirits
Ceased to be, depressed, incinerated
It cant be undone

See through me this pain this fear
This uncontrollable corrosion
Acetic rain pours down on me
Impure and sinful fuses my skin

With inner death - soul decay
The essence of my existenz

Eight moons hiding in eternity,
Shadowing my destiny
All I was, all I am, all I'll ever be
Never known where it ends
What this life would be
All I was, all I am, all I'll ever be...

It cant be undone

See through me this pain this fear
This uncontrollable corrosion
Acetic rain pours down on me
Impure and sinful fuses my skin

With inner death - soul decay
The essence of my existenz

Pain... fear...
Crashed into silence

Fate... failed
Now I'm forever
With inner death, soul decay
The essence of my existenz

It can't be undone
