Rage
Unfolded
The primal feeling breaks through
The fake surroundings go down, thrown down
All you've been shown
Transmissions made to blind you
This cancer spreads beside you, inside you

Your eyes wont open
They've been sealed
with numbers
tear this membrane
watch/reveal

All you see is what you know
Awaken, forsaken
Unchanged disease within your blood flows
Transcending, descending
so endless, relentless

Cries
They terrorise
But never seem to matter
Genocides lost in urban rituals
Know what you are
Or so you think you're different?
Your names engraved in every bullet

Your eyes wont open
They've been sealed
with numbers
tear this membrane
watch/reveal

All you see is what you know
Awaken, forsaken
Unchanged disease within your blood flows
Transcending, descending
so endless, relentless

Your eyes wont open
They've been sealed
with numbers
tear this membrane
watch/reveal

All you see is what you know
Awaken, forsaken
Unchanged disease within your blood flows
Transcending, descending
So endless, relentless

so endless, relentless
awaken, forsaken
so endless, relentless
Transcending, descending
