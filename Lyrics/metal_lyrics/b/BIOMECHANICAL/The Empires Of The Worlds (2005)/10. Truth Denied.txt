Scar me, condemn me, for all my, redemption
The source of infection
My rights as a man for you
Deny my feeling, my knowing, my being
All I not, forgiven, for my believing?

Cant stop me you wont stop me
Cant break me you wont break me
Cant trust me you wont trust me
Give me cause to fight the system

Truth denied
Truth denied
Truth denied
Truth denied
Truth denied
Truth is denied

I'm the believer, a tainted deceiver
My thoughts are reshaped by the powers that be
Blind me design me construct me instruct me
But you cant refuse what I can see

Cant stop me you wont stop me
Cant break me you wont break me
Cant trust me you wont trust me
Give me cause to fight the system

Truth denied
Truth denied
Truth denied
Truth denied
Truth denied
Truth is denied

Cant stop me you wont stop me
Cant trust me you wont trust me
Cant break me you wont break me

Cant stop me you wont stop me
Cant break me you wont break me
Cant trust me you wont trust me

Give me cause to fight the system
Give me back the truth denied
