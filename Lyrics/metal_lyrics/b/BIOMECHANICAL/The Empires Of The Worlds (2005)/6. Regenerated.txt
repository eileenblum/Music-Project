I've found my life force again
I live I breathe the crucial elements
Re-shed my minds second skin
I am within
Power that grips me I rise with my ferocity
Tear at the reins
Relieve the pains of my blood caressing me
Re-born a victim of lies
Fatal reprise
When will I die?

Cant stop me
I'll suffocate till I'm blind
And revive
I have returned forever

Regenerated... Reincarnated
Regenerated... Reincarnated

A systematic attack
I cant detract the core that beckons me
A dark forgotten abyss
I fight the mist
Release my entity
Drive me to my extremity
Cannot protect, evil infects
The mind that breeds inside
Look at me straight in the eyes... fatal reprise
When will I die

Cant stop me
I'll suffocate till I'm blind
And revive
I have returned forever

Regenerated... Reincarnated
Regenerated... Reincarnated

Tear at the scar on my face
Let it feed my hunger
Release the knife from my back
Let it seethe in anger
Under attack

Forget the fear I've shown
Break from the tomb I've known
Destroy the soul of sin
Reclaim the power that I gloried in

Cant stop me
I'll suffocate till I'm blind
And revive
I have returned forever

Regenerated... Reincarnated
Regenerated... Reincarnated

I'm reborn undying
I've returned forever

Sinner deceiver
Call me what you will
