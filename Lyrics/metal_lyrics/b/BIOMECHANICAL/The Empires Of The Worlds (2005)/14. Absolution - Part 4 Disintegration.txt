I have you know the final day
You cannot get away

Go ahead
Grab the hand before you
It will destroy you

Broken down into dust
The fragments of your past

Descending fast
for all your sins and anger
It's all too late now

Hear, me, rising in the dark
Fear, me, ascending towards you
Come again and again
The power builds inside
Light enraptured

Come anger, Come hatred
Unleash this fierce eternal truth
Release me, reveal me
I cant contain the end of you

I am, I am, disintegration

Look around,
Can you tell
I'm ready to consume

Can you feel
Years of sin inside you?
It will devour you

In the end
I'm condemned
A martyr of the cause

God of men,
Born to kill redemption
The souls infection

Hear, me, rising in the dark
Fear, me, ascending towards you
Come again and again
The power builds inside
Light enraptured

Come anger, Come hatred
Unleash this fierce eternal truth
Release me, reveal me
I cant contain the end of you

I am I am disintegration

Come again and again
The power builds inside
Light enraptured

Come anger, Come hatred
Unleash this fierce eternal truth
Release me, reveal me
I cant contain the end of you

I am I am disintegration
