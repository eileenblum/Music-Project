Activate, inferred, de-locate / re-locate
Infiltrate, instigate, penetrate, violate
Your fear for survival, instinctive, addictive
It drives me it commands me
No escape
I follow so closely to watch you as you die
To hear you as you cry
As youâre screaming my name

Detected, infected, inserted with virus.
Acetic infusion, genetic intrusion
Incubate my offspring in the cells of your blood
What lies beneath my skin
You can never detract

I become you
As I watch you demise through your eyes
As feed from your death, from your life
From your dreams, from your pain
As youâre screaming
Assaulter

Neutralise, humanise, integrate, simulate
Dominate, instigate, extirpate, violate
Your fear for survival, instinctive, addictive
It drives me it commands me
No escape
I follow so closely to watch you as you die
To hear you as you cry
As youâre screaming my name

Impulsive, corrosivem aggressive, desire
I seek no redemption for I am forgiven
And given the power to reclaim my birthright
What lies beneath my skin I can never detract.

I become you
As I watch you demise through your eyes
As feed from your death, from your life
From your dreams, from your pain
As youâre screaming
Assaulter

Slowly assimilated
Brutally annihilated

Infiltrate, instigate, penetrate, violate
Your fear for survival, instinctive, addictive
It drives me it commands me
No escape
I follow so closely to watch you as you die
To hear you as you cry
As youâre screaming my name

Impulsive, corrosivem aggressive, desire
I seek no redemption for I am forgiven
And given the power to reclaim my birthright
What lies beneath my skin you can never detract.

I become you
As I watch you demise through your eyes
As feed from your death, from your life
From your dreams, from your pain
As youâre screaming
Assaulter
