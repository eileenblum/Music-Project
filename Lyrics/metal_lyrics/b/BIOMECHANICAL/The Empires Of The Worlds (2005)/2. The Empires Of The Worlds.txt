Since I was five I had a gun welded on me
I was taught how to hate
I was taught how to kill
Since I was five I had a dream

To fight for my race/to fight for my god
To fight for my kind
Destroy and expand re-live the story
Of humans past

All I need is war, all I need is hatred
From the fear thatâs in your heart
Iâm attracted like a shark in bloody waters

Hear my cries of pain, hear my cries of war
Itâs creeping in my flesh
Animal instinct
It always drives me to attack

I fight the empires of the worlds
Prolonging your demise
Blood red skies are open wide
Fight the empires of the worlds
For we the human race
Victory is genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide

The scars on my face
Can tell you tales of human wars
Enemy blood has run through them
And dried through them
I need some more

We slaughtered we killed proud and thrilled
Burned the enemies flags
Invaded each others lands
And celebrated a billion deaths

In the name of god? In the name of money?
In the name of power?
This is what we thought
And this is why we fought

Now we hold the truth
We donât fight each other
Forever our fear is abolished
Beyond the boundaries
Of the hated in our souls

I fight the empires of the worlds
Prolonging your demise
Blood red skies are open wide
Fight the empires of the worlds
For we the human race
Victory is genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide

Yes I know the truth I know how to kill
Knowing how to kill is knowing how to survive
Knowing how to survive
Is knowing how to spread the spawn
The spawn of my race
The human race

I fight the empires of the worlds
Prolonging your demise
Blood red skies are open wide
Fight the empires of the worlds
For we the human race
Victory is genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide
Victory/Genocide
