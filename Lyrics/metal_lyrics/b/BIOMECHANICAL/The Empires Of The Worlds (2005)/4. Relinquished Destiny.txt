Silent walls close in on me
The darkness stirs lost memories
Can you feel it preying on my mind
Waiting...
Recreating...
Yeah...

Indescribable fears hold my eyes to the truth
Of who I really am

Tell me this why is it

That when I look in the mirror
I see a man with no face

Hollow dreams
Shattered screams
Send forth the creature
That is stalking me night after night

Insanity
Writhes within me
Voices bleed the truth
Of my relinquished destiny

Memories Creep inside
A stream of blood through the innocent slain
Cleanses all of my sins
Slowly...
Painfully...

Indescribable fears hold my eyes to the truth
Of who I really am

Tell me this why is it

That when I look in the mirror
I see a man with no face

Hollow dreams
Shattered screams
Send forth the creature
That is stalking me night after night

Insanity
Writhes within me
Voices bleed the truth
Of my relinquished destiny

Beast of pray
Iâve become.
A leviathan in the deepest sea of consciousness
Insanity
Writhes within me
Voices bleed the truth
Of my relinquished destiny

Kill me!

Pull the trigger
Free me
Let me die before I awake

I need... I breed... I bleed... Inhumane innocence

Kill me!

âDeteriorating visions of horrific rituals
seep through my skin
crashing ,y outer defences
Reminiscence of carnage
Engraved deeply on my skull
Resurface one again
Is there no forsaking
Is there no awakening?â

Kill me!
