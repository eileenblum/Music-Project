Tortured roots of failed existence
Bind me in a fatal hold
Writhing in shudder of faded amnesia
Left thrusting convulsing
And crushing the soul

Lost in blind meditation
Lost in mind immolation
Lost in life termination

Frenzied fight against ill-advised sacrifice
Imitate simulate torment
Take a look at your death
The spirit roth before the soul

Even so, death's a cruel blow
Sow the sorrow
As you pass to shadow
Then let go

Lost in blind meditation
Lost in mind immolation
Lost in life termination
Dead inside

Violent descent
Break out in decay
Silent repent
Defaced by ferocity
Violent descent
Break out in decay
Silent repent
In violent descent

Butchered truth of life's persistence grinds
Me to a rotting shell

Lost in blind meditation
Lost in mind immolation
Lost in life termination

Frenzied fight against ill-advised sacrifice
Imitate simulate torment
Take a look at your death
The spirit roth before the soul
Spinning to earth
Fall, twisting, shrinking as you burn
Sow the sorrow
As you pass to shadow
Then let go

Listen to me
You must awake
This is my final offence

Violent descent
There is no awakening
There is no awakening
There is no awakening
There is

No awakening
