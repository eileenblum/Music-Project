Destruction, eruption.

Convulsions invoke the disease
Descending, the ending,
drain blood from the scars I receive
In me, through me, always, with me
Blackened the day, retract the light away
Victims, cannot, tell you, why

Victory is genocide

Incision, this vision, march on your final parade
Infected, rejected, disturbed, distorted, engraved
In me, through me, always, with me
Blackened the day, retract the light away
Rip at, break at, this lifeless, terror

Unspoken, soul broken

Fallen, Fallen in Fear
Over powering
All devouring Fallen. Fallen in Fear
Life will break me
Endlessly, I'm fallen in fallen in fallen in fear

Ascendance, in vengeance,
Restrained by the powers that be
Repressor, aggressor,
Re-stained by the hours I bleed

In me, through me, always, with me
Blackened the day, refract light away
Victims, cannot, tell you, why
Victory is genocide

Diffusion, intrusion, encroaching
The freedom of speech
Bred stronger, no longer, approaching
The life that you breach

Fallen,
Fallen in Fear

Over powering
All devouring Fallen, Fallen in Fear
Life will break me
Endlessly, Fallen in fear

Remonstrate
Visceral
Outcast I fight 'till I fall
Dissident, Enemy, show me another way
This won't be my final day

Destruction, eruption, convulsions
Invoke the disease
Bred stronger, no longer,
Approaching the life that you breach

Rip at, break at, this lifeless, terror
Unspoken, soul broken

Fallen, Fallen in Fear
Over powering
All devouring Fallen. Fallen in Fear
Life will break me
Endlessly.

Violent fight for this dream to end,
Fallen in fear
