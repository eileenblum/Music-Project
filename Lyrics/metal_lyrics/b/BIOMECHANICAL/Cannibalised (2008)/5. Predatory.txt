Liberate!
Conform reaction with spoken weapons

Thought suppressors

Severance! The apex predator
Feeds on instinct, one by one

Slaughtering the will
Murdering the weak
Killing to become
Equilibrium
It captivity, bred ferocity
Made to activate survival mechanisms
Of surplus aggression

Acceptance
Arise to predatory
Hid in faith
Ti kill is necessary

Reason reborn
Devour, carnivore
Resolve, evolve with the blackened

Don't you know it?
You're predatory
You never show it
You're predatory
God damn predatory!

Deprecate
For all that differ, succumb to live by
Enforced beliefs
Reciprocate, the primal instincts
With infant killings
One by one enforced beliefs
Reciprocate, the primal instincts
With infant killings
One by one

Inbred rivalries, animosities, led us to believe
That we are all deceived
Poison parasite, savage genocide
Memories inside, surfacing fiercely
Deformed regression

Of violet spawn
The creature born
To savage thoughts
Internal walls
Inherent
Aggressive carnivore!

Of sinful birth
The scavenger
Feeds on the corpse
The slaughterer
Denounces
God fearing sacrifice

The origin
Of nature's sin
A potent force
That writes the past
A black discourse
Though minds mature
The sins endure
The weak will fall in carnage!
Can you see me now...
Can you hear me!!

Those words of faith
Faded away
This silent air
Now frozen

The slaughterer
Hides in the light
Darkening eyes
I'm stricken

Of sinful birth
The scavenger
Feeds on the corpse
Destroyer

Can you see me now...
Can you hear me!!
