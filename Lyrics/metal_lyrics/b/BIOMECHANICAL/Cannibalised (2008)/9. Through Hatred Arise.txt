Now I feel
I feed from sorrow
All I see
Faces, hollow

This dawn awakens me to sin
The sunlight blisters through the skin
My past was never

Become enraptured
Burned alive
Fear of god relentless
I'm left defenseless

Rise, rise through hatred

Aberration
Race of devourers
Will scatter on fields of redemption

Ascension, deception
Tears won't heal the death of sorrow

I'm one with the lies
Hatred discussed
With incomprehension
Conpassion turns into dread
It burns through the lead
That perished the living

Now I feel
I feed from sorrow
All I see
Faces, hollow
