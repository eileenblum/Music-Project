Of dark emergence
All this life had been

Riddled with the unspoken
Bounded by the unbroken

The will of the many
Assimilates me

Excruciatingly

Is this the end for me?

No one was ever there for me
Every time I've looked back
I've seen to trace of me

Fallen endlessly
Broken ceaselessly

Load the
Needle
Shoot it
In me
Veins now
Hear me screaming

Now
See
If I die

Introvert dissection
Animates the agony
Pestilent injection

Drug induced delusions
Amplify the suffering
Chemical intrusion
Cries of pain are deafening

Death can't abate the will to live
Through faith the condemned will rise

Draining out the venom
Remedy the toxic sting

Stay, alive
It strength, survive
Await
Emotionless I stall, the bane
Deflect, the pain
Obstruct, the gunshot and the wound
You'll find the cure is in the voices
Hear them

Slow the poison
See if I die

Futile executions
Justify the savage reign
Bitter blood transfusion
To prolong mortality

Death can't abate the will to live
Through faith the condemned will rise

Draining out the venom
Remedy the toxic sting

Of dark emergence
All this life had been

Riddled with the unspoken
Bounded by the unbroken

The will of the many
Assimilates me

Excruciatingly

Is this the end for me?

No one was ever there for me
Every time I've looked back
I've seen to trace of me

Fallen endlessly
Broken ceaselessly

Load the
Needle
Shoot it
In me
Veins now
Hear me screaming

I never learned from
The sins of the sinless man
Stay away from me
Never look at me

With no fear or despair
I will break through the

Walls that
You've build
For me
But i
Can see
Right through you

Now
See
If
I
Die before the shadowed
Poison breaks me
