Emptiness
A vast sense of abandonment
Of cold silence in solitude
As the isolation transcends me
I am taken, consumed
Transfused alive

Bleak, despair, desolation
The devastation now
Renders me complete

I can feel the rising voices
They resonate through the remains
The pulse is weakening
Rebirth

Flames of darkness
Incinerate septic wounds of war
As I approach the blackened dawn

Consumed but not blinded
Yet. Just like all the others
They will all fall in the end
The dreamers awake in deep
Cryogenic stasis

One by one we believe
Freedom for all
Freedom to assimilate
To create weapons
To slaughter

The gods are watching and smiling
At the sight of death, so proud

I can feel the rising voices
The pulse is weakening
The eyes are dead
The eyes are dead

Consumed

Taken...

Emptiness
A vast sense of abandonment
Of cold silence in solitude

The universe folds momentality
