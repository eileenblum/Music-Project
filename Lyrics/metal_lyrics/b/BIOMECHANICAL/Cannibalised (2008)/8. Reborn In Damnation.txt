Done, life is gone, fallen from, elevation
Torn, scathing storm
No imminent dawn, of salvation
Stay, blackened day, slides away
From redemption
Rise, arise

Awake to fight my innocence
And feed upon my ignorance
Burn up the savage skies
Extremist legacy
Belief in blind supremacy
Belief in life left in dormancy

The lies are true
(Terror arise)
Emphasized in you
(Horror arise)
Look inside yourself
(Hatred arise)
And discover

The more I kill
Means the less I feel
So the strength grows building like a
Plague of impurity

Reborn in damnation
Obituaries reincarnate
Washed up on stagnant shores
The enemies I lost
Seek out, and drain this silent host
Repair the bonds forged in abhorrence

This fiery tempest won't subside
The cursed believers, with gun fire give
Freedom to the free
And death to heaven
The fallen descended from the skies
The fight controls me
The plight becomes me
Risen, fallen in damnation

Done, life is gone, fallen from, elevation
Torn, scathing storm
No imminent dawn, of salvation
Stay, blackened day, slides away
From redemption
Rise, arise
