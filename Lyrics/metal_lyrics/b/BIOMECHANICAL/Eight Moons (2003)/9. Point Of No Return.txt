The taste of smoke still in my mouth
the bullet's fired. I heard no sound
If life is a blessing don't let me be
It's when you smile I cease to dream.

Show me the Point of no return
I've chosen to draw a different end

Always my fears kept me away
I silently scream. I've broken the pain

I have seen what's there to be seen
From abandoned dreams you all feed and breed.

Infested core spreading so fast
don't shut your eyes this pain is real
Cathartic threat cuts me in half
open your eyes this pain is real...

[Bridge:]
How true are my own lies?
No more. I've realised
This life is mine for me to seize

Show me the Point of no return
I have chosen to draw a different end

The way out is within myself
Freedom exists in my own cell

Always my fears kept me away
I silently scream. I've broken the pain

xenomorphic
anthropomorphic
hidden inside
eaten alive

Show me the point of no return

Infestation
within me
Infiltration
unbeaten
Immolation

See me as I really am

Show me the point of no return

Xenomorphic
Anthropomorphic
Hidden inside
Eaten alive

Open...wound...implodes...I've broken the pain
No fear.......I've invaded the sphere.....of sorrow
eternally hollow....I decent in to the Abyss
I think am losing my mind

Show me the point of no return
There's no return!
