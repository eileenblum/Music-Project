[Verse 1:]
Cold-Bright-Infinite-Light burns.
Strong sense of mortal radiance
Draws me, disintegrates sanity.
Helpless. Unable to resist.

Under attack
Claws leap out from the camouflage of
White on white. The âHarvest of Iniquitiesâ starts

[Bridge:]
In a time thatâs not a time
and in a place thatâs not a place you will find

[Chorus:]
There are no shadows left to hide in
Hear your death knell
There are no shadows left to hide in
Fear wide open in a different hell

[Verse 2:]
White Death. Insanity
Vanity
They hide so quietly-perfectly
The terror of silent carnage
Death will come many times
âTil black honey
is extracted from its evil hive
Just pray the truth
Will flow transfused into the void.

[Bridge:]
