[Verse:]
Voiceless dreams
Silver whispers showing the way
To a cosmos forgotten by all Gods and Demons
I cross the bridge that I find within my own self
Deep down far out
ignite the fuse
Propelled by
Serpent fire
Burning in me.Rising
Raging
Out of control...

[First Narration:]
Through its eyes I see the changing fragile beauty of the stars
As the butterfly flaps its wings.
Spectacular galactic fireworks explode with awesome grace.
Shimmering nebulae reveal their delicate ribbons of prismatic colour.
Solar flares loom majestically against a glittering backdrop.

[Bridge:]
I witness my many deaths and all of my resurrections.
The heavens are torn apart. Revealing my fate.
They are calling me......

[Chorus:]
Eight moons
Hiding in eternity. Shadowing my destiny.
All I was, all I am, all I'll ever be...

[Second Narration:]
I am catapulted into oblivion
The journey begins

[Third Narration:]
Without effort, I project above myself
and see the overall creature that I am.
Omnipresent (lusting for knowledge),
I experience this new realm in one cerebal bite.
Abominable physiques clothe sentient life-forms.
Unspeakable rituals offered by
debauched and profane civilizations shred my sanity.
My soul plunges as my heart becomes other than flesh.
Is this the beginning of my death?

[Fourth Narration:]
The universe folds momentarily, then unfolds
As the butterfly flaps its wings.
