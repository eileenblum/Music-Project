Invisible
Iâm a shadow in the darkness
I move between your dreams and nightmares
I dance within the cries of pain, I suffered from you
I terrorize the core of power deep inside you

I melt the crown you wear
Burning through your skull
For Iâm within
I am without but within your fears

In the Core of Darkness
That is where you will find me.
From the Core of Darkness
Iâm staring back at you
From the core of Darkness
Staring back at you

Etch âregretâ on the meat of your heart
Suits by Mac Beth, your pen spills their blood
Wear your heart on a chain âround your neck
So every demon you meet understands

Burning questions
Shatter your reality
For Iâm within
Iâ am without but within your fears

In the Core of Darkness
That is where you will find me.
From the Core of Darkness
Iâm staring back at you
From the core of Darkness
Staring back at you

[Part 2]

Pure as pain
pure evil flows through me

I see the darkness ripping through
Open up your eyes and see demise
of the children who were never meant to be
Eat their bodies and be reborn once again.

Beasts of heaven are raging toward you

Angels of hell are craving for your flesh
Drink my blood and rip my heart out

Be my guest and see what I can see
Eat your flesh and become reborn once again

Beasts of heaven are racing toward you

Angels of hell are craving for your flesh

Beasts of heaven are rising toward you
Unholy saints they contemplate
Their thoughts as a dark sacrament

I Eat your flesh and become reborn once again
Ruler of  your Living Hell

[Part 3]

In the Core of Darkness
That is where you will find me.
From the Core of Darkness
Iâm staring back at you
In the Core of Darkness.....
