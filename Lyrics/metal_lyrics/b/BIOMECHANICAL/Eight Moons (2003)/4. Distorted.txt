Fateful
thirst for dark horizons
Hateful
infectious trepidation
My eyes
can see so far beyond
the boundaries of your miscalculated sanity.

So distant. I am threatening - infecting
your existence
Distorted
I am. An outcast
I am.
Rejected
I am. Unwanted
I am.

Distorted
I am. An outcast
I am.
Rejected
I am. Unwanted
I am
why don't you leave me alone...

Painful
realisation
Violent
is the birth of your creation
I hear
so far beyond the screams
Believe and be deceived
I've walked the path you've never seen.
