Embracing chaos
Imbued with its fury

Transcending planes of stagnation
Mastering vicissitude
Transmitting it to strength

Throwing off the veil of weakness
To realise that what I've perceived

As the walls of my prison
Are the keys to liberation
Led astray by languor

I've neglected solitude, sorrow and rage

I've suppressed the eternal call of darkness

In favour of this anemic half-life
Everything I despise

But this frailty is only a mask
Concealing burning rage
I see it disintegrate in ashes with the rekindling of a supine spirit

I'll shed no tears for those

Who have volunteered for vassalage
For those who wallow in weakness

The embers of rage have kindled
I forge a glacial path
From life unto death
