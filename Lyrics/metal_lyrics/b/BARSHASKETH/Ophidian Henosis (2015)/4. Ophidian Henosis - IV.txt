Shatter the illusions
That rot like a plague within
Project the shards outward
To tear through veils of delusion

Cornering weakness
Delve into its depths
Exacerbate the wound

Vntil strength blossoms from its corpse
The spirit years to ascend

Straining against its bonds
Cables drawn taut
Still firmly rooted in the carcass of weakness

A phoenix in fetters but the yearning
The desire to ascend

Is the seed
That will grow to shatter these chains
The spark
Of the metamorphic conflagration

Onward now to blacker hells
To bleaker spheres of desolation
To conquer misery

Another vassal in service to this burgeonig strength
Absorbing every failure
With ungoveranble strength

Nauseated by this cloud of feeble, mephitic will
I return to black faith
