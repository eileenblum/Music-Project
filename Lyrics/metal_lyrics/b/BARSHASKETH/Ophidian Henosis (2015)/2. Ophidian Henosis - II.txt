Crawling through the clawing, sucking mire of defeat
Ever upward, ascending to unattainable heights
Towards the self
I see it at the apex - triumphant and calm

With every pace, I slip back two more
But still I climb with aching muscles

Below, the gloom is warmed by the dazzling fires of apathy

And the masses pass me by, fleeing the self on shambling limbs
Descending towards the lights

Their faces merged into a rictus of vacant, asinine contentedness

And I'm tempted to join them
I confess in moments of weakness and despair,
I've let myself slip back, towards the warmth

Some stop to converse, but their tongue is as alien to me as the screeching of the crow

They are politely oblivious to the bloodied, soiled carcass
That I drag behind me with a taut golden line

Yet still they leave gladdened, ever towards the lights
And I continue upward

My dragging body becomes heavy as the detritus builds up

If only I had the will to severe that golden cable, to float at ease toward the self

But I lack the courage
That is my burden
