Emerging from unplumbed blackness
Cloaked in filth and horror
Emblazoned with untold miseries

Deny hope
Your shrines are hollow

Rejecting extraneous salvation
Seeking redemption within
Torturing failure until it becomes victory

Nurturing the unknown
Vntil it becomes wisdom

Rise from the corpse of solace
Profane metempsychosis

Wielding the anguish that burns inwardly
Strike out and transcend

My only sin has been submission
But true growth requires the blackest sin
Strike out and ascend

Becoming my weakness
Becoming my fear
Becoming the enemy

To realise true potential
And the extent of fortitude
Blind to the writhing mass
Grasping for hollow scraps

And siphoning pride from the deeds of another I master fate
A coronation of suffering

I sacrifice meekness
At the altar of true will

Adorned with the regalia of death

Bearing the putrid insignia of the horror of the void

I reign over this decrepit path
With ophidian obdurateness
