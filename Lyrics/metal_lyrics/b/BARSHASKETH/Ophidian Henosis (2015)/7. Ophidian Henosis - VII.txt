Battling the monad of despair
Atop the corpses of man's every hope

Beneath vacant banners
Shattered against the walls
Burning with every inevitable defeat

Armouring the spirit in the vestments of desolation
Reborn from the ashes of relentless vanquishment
The seed of incipient triumph

Germinating in the vestiges of ultimate defeat

The only true defeat is surrender
The only true death is submission
There are no martyrs here

Ours is the path of glorious triumph
