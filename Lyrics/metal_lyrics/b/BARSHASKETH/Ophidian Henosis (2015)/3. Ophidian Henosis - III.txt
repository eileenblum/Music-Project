I've seen beauty blossom, and permeate brightly through this sphere
Only to putrefy and cover the earth with its ashes

I've felt the hopeless despair of the finite
And the crushing weight of doubt

I turn inwards, with heavy lidded ajna
A blurred and filthy lens

And with the purging of ego, I'm overcome with ecstasy
And enveloped in blinding light

Without decay, beauty becomes banality
There is only one eternal strand
Fluctuating
The surging mass of desultory life
Moved by spurious forces through channels of stone

Is more frightening to me than the embrace of death
But without that fear, there can be no strength
So I reject the hungry arms of death again

Only through suffering can we know true joy
Only through blindness can we behold true light

I detach from the nimbus of occlusion
And tear through Maya with merciless attrition

The curse of the enlightened is that they're blind to their own elevation

Vnable to perceive it through grimed lenses

We will always be despised by the spiritually impoverished

Just as the immured detest the few beyond the bounds of their prison
