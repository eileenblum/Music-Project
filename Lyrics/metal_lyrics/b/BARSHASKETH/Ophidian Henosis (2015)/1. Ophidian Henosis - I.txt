Overflowing with an absence of will
And thus, I am defined
It's no great marvel that lost men

Stood beneath skies torn by gaudy starlight

And shrank under the weight of the infinite
That they gave that nothingness a name

And fell to their knees before its might to worship it

The tyrannical, uncaring personification of the void
Burdened by freedom

They constructed their own prison and damned their descendents to eternal interment

And I am like them
A coward before the vastness of nothingness
Crippled by the mocking sting of guilt

Dragged down by the burning expanse of emptiness that weighs in us all

Consumed by it, I've watched meaning slowly tortured until it becomes meaningless in itself

A twisted relic from an incomprehensible past

The only true defeat is surrender
The only true death is submission
There are no martyrs here

Ours is the path of endless struggle
The only true defeat is surrender
The only true death is submission
There are no martyrs here
Ours is the path of bitter rage
The only true defeat is surrender
The only true death is submission
There are no martyrs here
Ours is the path of burning sorrow
