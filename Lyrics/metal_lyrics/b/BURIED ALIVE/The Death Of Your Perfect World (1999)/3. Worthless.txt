You're worthless as you burn.
Everything about you makes me sick.
Your self satisfying ridicule makes me sick.
Condescending, contradictive.
I wait for you to burn.
Choke on your tongue of lies.
You burn.
Worthless.
You're worthless as you burn.
How does it feel?
For so long you've torn away.
How does it feel back in your face?
