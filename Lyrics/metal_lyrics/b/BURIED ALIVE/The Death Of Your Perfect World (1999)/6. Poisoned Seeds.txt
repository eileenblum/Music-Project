How much more can we take?
With all this weight we'll break.
Your so called god gave us life to grow and breathe.
All we do is destroy to satisfy needs.
We've polluted ourselves, our land, and our skies.
Greed kills our lives.
How much more can we take?
Mother Earth is beaten and she's raped.
An animal's life is sacrificed just because we like the taste.
Anything for human gain.
Anything.
Modern man, lost in lust.
Poisoned seeds, in disgust.
How much more can we take?
