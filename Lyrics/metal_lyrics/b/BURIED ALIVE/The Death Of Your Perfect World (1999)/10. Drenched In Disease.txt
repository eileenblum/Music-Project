Human waste, fallen prey, surrounding me.
A plague on life, corroded minds, a dying breed.
Morals decay, whores parade, it sickens me.
This human race, the living dead, drenched in disease.
Burn away, see this dead.
This world burns.
Everday I search for hope.
My hopes drenched in disease
Burn away, end this plague.
Drenched in disease.
This world burns.
