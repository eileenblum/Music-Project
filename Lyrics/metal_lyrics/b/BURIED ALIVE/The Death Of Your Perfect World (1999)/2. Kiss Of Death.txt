Infected by our callous acts.
Our blood flows the kiss of death.
Relentless disease as death tolls rise.
This virus breeds on human desire.
Whether you lust the needle of the flesh, you've sealed your fate, a fate of death.
Kiss of death.
Our blood flows the kiss of death.
The eliminator, taker of life.
An epidemic we feed and supply.
Kiss of death.
Now frail bodies are no longer immune.
No retribution, no cure to save you.
Consequence for our acts.
Kiss of death.
