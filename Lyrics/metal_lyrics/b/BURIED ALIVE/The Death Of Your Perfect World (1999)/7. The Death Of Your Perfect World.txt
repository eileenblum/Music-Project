Your perfect world is dead, and I'm the one who set it ablaze.
The ones you trusted, you breathed for, they took your life.
Dead in your world.
Victim of innocence.
Now you die.
The ones you trusted, you breathed for, took your life.
Everything you lived for burns before your eyes.
Every single ounce of lies dies.
Bound and gagged, forever scarred.
Those that gave you life took your life.
The death of your perfect world.
Your perfect world is dead.
Dead in your world.
Victim of innocence.
Now you die a thousand deaths.
