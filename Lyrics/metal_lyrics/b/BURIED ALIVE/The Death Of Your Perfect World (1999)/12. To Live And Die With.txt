I'd kill to keep this alive, and I'd destroy anything that threatened it's life.
Everday I fight to make sure this breathes.
Strike me down, but you'll never take this from me.
You'll never know all that this has done for me.
Or see the beauty that I see.
This is my everything.
The one thing that puts life into me.
We push towards extinction as we kill our own.
The backlash is self inflicted as we cut our own throats.
We are our own disease, and we will never be what we could be.
