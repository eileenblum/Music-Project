I see the same face but so much else has changed.
I remember what you once meant to me.
You compromised, astray.
Now I'm left with nothing but regret.
You died.
So look at yourself.
Are you better off now or then with your wealth and fame?
All your followers believe your words.
Words you can't explain.
To do, to say those things that meant so much to me.
You turned away.
Now you're gone.
There's nothing to believe.
I can't believe I ever believed in you.
Kill.
Let them die.
So I let them die.
Kill their past.
