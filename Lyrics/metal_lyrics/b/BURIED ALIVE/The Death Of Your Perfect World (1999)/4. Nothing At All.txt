Ease your mind with you simple life.
Don't tell me that you could never do this.
It's plain to see the truth is you don't care.
Your words fade, your actions speak for themselves.
In the end we both know you've done nothing at all.
All your excuses, excuses I defy.
Do you think that you're part of this?
Do you think that you've saved at all?
Actions speak for themselves.
You've done nothing at all.
Sacrifice yourself.
