Drain this blood from me.
Your curse runs through my veins.
Take this name you gave.
I don't want you branded on me.
Bloodline of guilt.
Your hate.
My solitude is my fate.
Everything I hated in you is now inside of me.
I want to tear you out and this is all you gave to me.
So how can I live with myself cursed in the womb?
I know this was beaten in you.
Your voice of hate runs through my head.
Now all I want is to see you dead.
Drain this blood from me.
Your curse runs through my veins.
Curse of the womb.
I want to see you dead.
