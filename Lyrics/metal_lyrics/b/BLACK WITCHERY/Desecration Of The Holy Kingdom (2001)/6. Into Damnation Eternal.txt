Undead Born Before the Stars
As spells of Black Magic Haunt through my soul
I fall into the Abyss, into pinnacle desolate
As the Queen of Ghouls and terror caresses my astral corpse
I Suffer in the Shadows of Thy Mighty Fortress
I call Thee Master, take My Sacrifice...
The Eye of Satan, like glowing Irons Now I condemn All to Hell...
Into Hell's Fires, the Halls of grim Eternity
Left Hand Path of existence was my choice
Now I hear our prey, they howl and moan in anguish
The Devil is laughing, with Thunder in His Voice...
