Falling from the Skies, Death and Holy Misery
Angels of the Light cursed in debauchery and Pain
Holy Kingdom Raped, burning souls of purity
weak, merciful God - face the Wrath of Blasphemy and Hate
Death unto the skies, storming from below
Flames consume the Heavens, Holy vision of death
Desecrate souls of Feeble descent shall perish Beneath Our Arise
Storming shadowed minions of the Horned One
Shall Rape the Holy Trinity
Death unto the skies, storming from below
Flames consume the Heavens, Holy vision of Death
Desecrate souls of Feeble descent shall perish Beneath Our Arise
Storming shadowed minions of the Horned One
Shall Rape the Holy Trinity
Unholy Vengeance of War Unholy Vengeance of War
Nocturnal Chariots of Death Burning with Hatred For God...
