Commander of the Raging Hordes The ones who bring eternal death
Black harnished guardians of our race Leading the Angelholocaust
Blasphemous Masters of the scene Grand Evil Fiends so Pride
Apostles of Satanic Will - Impale the Seed of Life
While the wheel keeps turning we do not stop our deathmarch
Confront the realms of frozen hope- hate shal fill the hearts
And Whilst they reign and sit in judgment
On their Morbid, Dark Eternal Thrones
Men won't stop suffering Angels won't stop burning
I summon ye Gods of War Gods of Death Gods of Fire
Gods of Plague Gods of Vengeance Gods of Lust Gods of Mayhem
Gods of Sin Now the Demonlords are Praised...
Commander of the Raging Hordes The ones who bring eternal death
Black harnished guardians of our race Leading the Angelholocaust
Weeping Angels Bleeding Corpses None shall survive Satan's Wrath
But we are free as we kill for Hell as we kill for Him as we Rule.....
