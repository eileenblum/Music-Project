I walked through a gateway within a gateway
in the midst of sulfur black darkness
blackened by the heavens the obscurity inside of me was lit by your Flames

Praise the darkness that covered the light
prophecies of the sign of doom
all of my flesh will come to your adoration
only here can my soul be reborn

Lord of the world, angel of the abyss
see the cathedral I built within my black soul

Invoking the sign of the coming end time
the apocalyptic scar reveals
the divinity's secret of the swine
proclamation of the sign of doom
Desecration of hollow purity
profaned seven angels with broken seven trumpets

Lord of the world, angel of the abyss
crushing the worthless era of silence and peace
the ever-flowing Darkness of Lucifer reigns
prayer and worship swept by profane blasphemies

Crucified to death the christian blind messiah ceased
death celebrated the advent of the cross
there is no risen corpse of God to see
pray for the judgement of the final arrival
