Black hearts of Damnation arise
Beast of abomination calls
Holy minions burning in mayhemic flames of doom
Victory of death and destruction!

Apocalyptic command for death
Black moon's rising over the nuclear mist
Praying for salvation as the holocaust approaches
The flock of god is engulfed by wrath of Darkness

Blasphemous storm of death
Darkness and evil attack
Crushing the Mass of christian slaves with Black Destructive Might
Inferno of sacred death vomiting forth
Scourge the race of the weak Jehovah's faith

Holy chapels are burning in blasphemous black flames
Sacred minions tormented to death
Invoke the Seventh Sign
Mayhem wind's death call
Legions of the blackest blood arise

Fallen Purity is scorned
Apocalyptic holocaust command
Sacred minions tormented to death
