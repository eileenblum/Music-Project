I've seen this all before
Scattered lives
blood points the floor
we're still the slaves
the look thats in their eyes
souls were sold and hearts burn cold
the rage that burns inside
we are the saviours, we are carrying the torch
this time
we are the saviours carrying the torch
This time, this time
we will rise
against the odds
to prevail
to defeat
we will rise
against the odds
to defeat
and we will rise
and we will rise
breakdown the walls and set them free
discarding this false economy
burn down the walls and set them free
discarding this false economy
the look thats in their eyes
souls were sold
the rage that burns inside
we are the saviours, we are carrying the torch
this time
we are the saviours carrying the torch
This time, this time

we will rise
take this town by force
together as one
every fist in the air
pick it up
I've seen the death of an empire
I've seen the birth of hope
rebuilding from the destruction
we vow never stand alone

Never stand alone!!!
Never stand alone!!!
Never stand alone!!!
Never stand alone!!!
Never stand alone!!!
Never stand alone!!!
Never stand alone!!!
Never stand alone!!!
