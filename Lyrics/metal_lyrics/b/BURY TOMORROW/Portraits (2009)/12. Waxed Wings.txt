[US version track]

decide its now the time to make up your mind, today's the day you'll hopefully
find, that freedom is granted our sentence has passed, and now we are floating
towards the light

and as i fall, i rue my mistakes, and my soul fades, i want to be where our
dreams first met tonight,
and as i fall, into the sea the waves consume me, i want to be where our dreams
first met, we wore our hearts around our necks

here i lay under the sun that burns my wings, our dreams are broken for all of
our faith has been taken away, take me to the sun and far beyond the clouds,
forever captured in your mind, when you look to the sky, i'm in your eyes

and one day ill take you there, to the point on the map where the sea meets the
sky, the sky, bring me the sun, the light, through the rain, i made a pact, the
promise was set, our efforts will not be in vain

and as i fall, into the sea the waves consume me, i want to be where our dreams
first met, we wore our hearts around our necks

if i gave you a chance would you open your arms wide
