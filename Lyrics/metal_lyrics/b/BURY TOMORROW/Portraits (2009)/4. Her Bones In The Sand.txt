GO!
I split these ocean waves
I carved a path right through you!
The sea has washed away
Discarded! memories!!
Searched the sea and you're not here, you're not here
In the sand we lay
You're not here now, you're not here
OHHH!! the anchors
Drag down
Your final rest
(The ocean floor!!)
I'll never rest until you're found
And tidal drags down
BAAABBBY!! OH!! in solidarity
I've searched beneath the tide
Too many times
I've failed my bride
I've searched beneath the tide
Too many times
I've failed my bride
I have fought against the tide
Too many times I've felt this
Searched the sea and you're not here, you're not here
In the sand we lay
You're not here now, you're not here
Searched the sea and you're not here, and you're not here
(And now she's gone)
And now she's gone
(And now she's gone)
And now she's gone
Her bones in the sand
She said she knew it was time
Her bones in the sand
She said ahhh
She said she knew it was time
