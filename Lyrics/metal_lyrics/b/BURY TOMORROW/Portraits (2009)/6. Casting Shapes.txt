(Your heart) is In my hands
Whys it so hard (to love tonight)
(Why is there only one side to your eyes)
And I'll take your heart and I'll rip it rip it from your chest.

And I'll say the words I wished I could

From the darkness, I am light and I wont forget the pain I felt
..these roots are buried so fucking deep into the ground
Seems like I've spent a life time ...trying to cut you down.

(Why is there only one side in your eyes)
I'll see for the blind and I'll hear for the deaf
(These chains are rapped around our lives far to tight)
I'll see for the blind and I'll hear for the deaf
(Why is there only one side in your eyes)

Those roots were buried and now I've dug them out
and in an act of suicide ..she swallows her pride

(Why is there only one side in your eyes)
I'll see for the blind and I'll hear for the deaf
(These chains are rapped around our lives far to tight)
I'll see for the blind and I'll hear for the deaf
(Why is there only one side in your eyes)
I'll see for the blind and I'll hear for the deaf
and I'll take back every word you ever fucking said.

Babe .I'm taking you for granted ..I'm taking you
.I'm taking you for granted one last time she said.

(She said) she said stay away ...(She said stay)
