I damned myself, Iâve taken all the time I need, to show you, what you
really mean to me.
So stand here with me in a bid that you will be set free,
I know itâs hard to fight again, I knkow itâs hard, I know itâs hard to
love again.
I know itâs hard.
Three years today, Iâve fought this war, three fucking years...
Iâve fought this war, Iâve seen the light shining through crimson skies.
Bless this.
