Breathe! Oh God, breathe!
Breathe! Oh god please breathe!
I hate everything about you
but it seems I have to clean up all the damage you do
so I just sit and wait
It's just a cut at the throat
For months I've had to swallow my pride
You don't know how much that killed me inside
And I'm waiting for a sign,
to show you that,
that this is my crime
and I know why,
I know why I can't
Confess to this,
Show you what I am
I said I'd find you I fucking did
I'll shred the integrity you have left
I'm so fucking sick of you,
it's just a cut at the throat,
it's just a cut at the throat
we'll see who's laughing now
and I want you to know
that this is a time for me to show
and I just want you to know,
that I just need those words, to go
waiting alone for a sign
to show you that, that this is my crime
and I know why, and I know why I care
Lets do this, show you what I am
we're set to sail all the skies
we won't be seeing the light anymore
I't's the price I've paid too much,
It's over, what have I done
what have I fucking done
bodies will fall, bodies will fall it's the price they pay! [x2]
It's the price they pay [x2]
