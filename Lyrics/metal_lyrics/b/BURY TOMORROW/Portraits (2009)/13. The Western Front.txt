[US version track]

I've seen this time and time before
Same run of play same end score
Could we be the better men this time
Could we be the better men this time

This is another invasion
So why do we call it war

This is who we are
Fighting again and again with no sense of direction or love
So it's here we'll die
Knowing that every step we take of this has all been a lie

I've never been one for uniform
Yet I'm suited booted ready for war
I heard them say this is our day
If you've never fired a gun son you've never felt alive
I'm sorry that's a fucking lie
I'm being spoonfed poison I'm clearly not ready to die

This is who we are
Fighting again and again with no sense of direction or love
So it's here we'll die
Knowing that every step we take of this has all been a lie

I'm taking over
I'm pulling rank
These western winds have taken
Too many lives to bring back
I'm taking over
I'm pulling rank
These western winds have taken
Too many lives to bring back

Take back every word you said
Take back every lie you sold this nation
Take back every word you said
Take back every lie you sold this nation

This is who we are
Fighting again and again with no sense of direction or love

This is who we are
Fighting again and again with no sense of direction or love
So it's here we'll die
Knowing that every step we take of this has all been a lie
