And as the light breaks through, with the hope that we had.
Years drag on, age is lined by the frame.
Light breaks through.

Through immortality, love is lost, powers gained.
I've sold the blood, from my veins.

As these winters fade, so do mortals lives.

The cracks that scar my face, enemies portrayed.
In vein never to be displayed.

As these winters fade, so do mortals lives.
But my heart remains, ever beating, ever beating.

STRIP IT DOWN.
Tear the place from the walls,
I am done, I want to see the age beneath my eyes.

And as the light breaks through, with the hope that we had.
Years drag on, age is lined by the frame.
Light breaks through.

I have seen, all the things within this life.
But i am damned to walk this earth.
I've seen some things, that will make your blood turn cold,
I've seen some things, that will make your blood turn cold,
STRIP IT DOWN.
Tear the place from the walls,
I am done, I want to see the age beneath my eyes.

And as the light breaks through, with the hope that we had.
My eyes burn at my face,
As the portrait's displayed.
