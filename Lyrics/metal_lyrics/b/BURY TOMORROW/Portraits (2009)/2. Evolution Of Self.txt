And with our heart we stand together our paths the same
And with our heart we stand together our paths the same
And with our heart we stand together our paths the same
And with our heart we stand together our paths the same
Will I resolve all my sins
Amend upon gestures I gave a long time ago
I've said the things I wanted to say
So I drive
Deeper inside the belly of the beast
The beast I needed to slay
I've come to far to leave this behind
Don't look any deeper you won't like what you find
And I just explain it don't turn away from me
Don't look any deeper you won't like what you see!
Theres never been a better time for me to shine
Theres never been a better way for me to say
So I tred these concrete times
Looking for a better way
So I drive
Deeper inside the belly of the beast
The beast I needed to slay
I've come to far to leave this behind
Don't look any deeper you won't like what you find
And I just explain it don't turn away from me
Don't look any deeper you won't like what you SEE!!!
You won't like what you SEE
You won't like what you see
So we haven't found an answer
And so we haven't found our answer
And so we haven't found our answer
And so we haven't found our answer
And so we haven't found our answer
And so we haven't found our answer
