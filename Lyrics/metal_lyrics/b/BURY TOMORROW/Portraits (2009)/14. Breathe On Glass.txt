[US Version Track]You never could see the message unspoken.
How I felt diseased.
This isn't how it goes, how love's supposed to be.
Breathe on the glass, see inside my mind,
see the secrets it hides for all the times I've stood by your side.
Breathe on the glass, see inside my mind,
see the secrets it hides and all I've despise.
Turn the page.
Show me how to forget this.
The heart I gave was all I had to.
Turn the page, bring me a reason I should care.
This was all I had to give.
As the warm rolls over our past is still.
I am forever in the present.
Breathe on the glass, see inside my mind,
this is for all the times I've tried and the times you've lied.
Oh!
Turn the page.
Show me how to forget this.
The heart I gave was all I had to.
Turn the page, bring me a reason I should care.
This was all I had to give.
And all I had to give.
There's nothing here now...
Turn the page.
Show me how to forget this.
The heart I gave was all I had to.
It's like I've said a thousand times.
Failure of the divine.
And time and time again I've spent bridging divides.
I never promised I'd be around.
I never promised I'd be around.
