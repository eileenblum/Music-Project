This has been shown to you and I, a path with faith and fear beside us
The weight of love and hate we bare will give the answers
Our path is made, determination to make it through
And so, hand in hand we walk this forest floor
Doomed to be apart for evermore
I gave my life for you

This has been shown to you and I
And you don't know and you can't see,
where the answers have been taking me [x2]

I am the one to bend backwards again, like you heard this before
Why won't you answer me, why won't you answer me

This has been shown to you and I, the path with faith and fear beside us
The weight of love and hate we bare will give the answers

This is a turning point, determination is just a farse
And so, our hands have strayed apart
This forest trail, led us back to the start
Doomed to be apart, for evermore

This has been shown to you and I
And you don't know and you can't see,
where the answers have been taking me [x2]

Sick of the sight, we are doomed to be apart
Doomed, we are doomed, to be apart, for evermore
