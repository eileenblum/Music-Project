I get the feeling this house isn't quite what it seems,
The skeletons are coming alive, the overwhelming sense of permanence
Has got you running scared, fear within your eyes!

Blood on the walls
There's blood on the walls and it seems so unreal
Blood on the walls
There's blood on the walls and it seems so unreal
I'm having some trouble distinguishing
The living from the dead
There's blood on the walls
Blood on the walls
Don't you see what I mean

Stop running away
Turn back and see this pain
The truth, your fears will change
You'll know it's all here to stay

The clocks are spinning back
Our time is running out
There's never been a better way
To expel your doubt
And if we make it through I would come home with you
Where we could take each morning as something new

Blood on the walls
Theres blood on the walls and it seems so unreal
Blood on the walls
Theres blood on the walls and it seems so unreal
The living, the dead
The glorified and the hated

I FUCKING TOLD YOU!!

(MOVE)
This would happen
COME ON!!

Stop running away
Turn back and see this pain
The truth, your fears will change
You'll know it's all here to stay
Stop running away (stop running, stop running)
Cos you'll know it's here to stay (It's here to stay)
This pain will never change but you won't wait for me!
Resurrect the dead
Redefine your life
Resurrect the dead
Redefine your life
The time has come
The time has come
To pay
The time has come
The time has come
To pay!
