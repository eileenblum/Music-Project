WE WILL, suffer under sacrifice
WE WILL, run to your side,
WE WILL, suffer under sacrifice,
WE WILL, watch as our city falls,

[Chorus:]
Will you keep your promise? can we find a way? (can we find away)
Will you keep your promise? can we find a way? (can we find away)
Will you keep your promise? can we find a way?

(Can we find a way) Can we find a way,

[Chorus:]
Will you keep your promise? can we find a way? (can we find away)
Will you keep your promise? can we find a way? (can we find away)
Will you keep your promise? can we find a way?

Can we find a way, can we find a way?

WE WILL, I WON'T BE ALONE AGAIN ,
WE WILL, I WON'T FALL THIS TIME,
WE WILL, I WON'T BE ALONE AGAIN,
WE WILL, I WON'T BE ALONE AGAIN
