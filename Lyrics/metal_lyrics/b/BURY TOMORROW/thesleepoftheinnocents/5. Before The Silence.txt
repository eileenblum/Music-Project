Save me tonight, you'll always be my only
You'll always be mine, save a prayer for us

Can you see it coming, can you hold me down
I've seen this dream before, It's coming

My hearts under these seas that infiltrate me
You, my love, I'd drown just to get you home

These cities swim in oceans, peoples lives are torn in two
There's nothing left to hold to, watch as their lives wash away

My heart is broken and my bodies bleeding
But I'll still find you my love, but I'll still find you my love

Find me now, my hearts still beating
