I can feel you running, and I can taste the sickness in the air
Go grab the stuff Kate, canât you see that itâs time for us to go
Our luck is turning, I can sense your sadness isnât fair
Just donât look back babe, Iâll be behind you all the way
The others are learning (the pages are turning)
The evidence is scattered on the floor (letâs get out of town)
My mind is bending, Iâve been here time and time before

These woods arenât safe for us, get up and save yourself
You wonât see the whites of their eyes babe, of their bloodshot eyes
These woods arenât safe for us, get up and save yourself
You wonât see the whites of their eyes

I see you running, I sense your sickness isn't fair
Go grab the stuff Kate, canât you see itâs time for us to go
Our luck is turning, I sense your sickness isnât fair
Just donât look back babe, Iâll be behind you all the way

Where would I be without you? [x2]

I can feel you running, and I can taste the sickness in the air

Thereâs something I never, that I never knew [x2]
