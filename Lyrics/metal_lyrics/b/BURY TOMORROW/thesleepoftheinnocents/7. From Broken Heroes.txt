We are the ones outside your door
As the light fades to black
We are the ones who hold your future
In our hands

So I walk alone, Iâll take that road
No one ever really knows or gave a fuck to what you said
A long life lived for a small gain

The Sun has risen
But I still wonât save you

Forget all your promises
Take back whatâs been said
Your dreams of a world less insecure
Your portrayal, your lost legacy
