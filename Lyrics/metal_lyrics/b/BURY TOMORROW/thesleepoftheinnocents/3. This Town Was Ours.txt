Take a page from my book, this chapters never ending
Watch your feet donât fall, this town is under, this town is under

I saw the lights, I came for you
You took my hand, and led me through
You stopped for me, when I was down
These flames are high but this town is ours

These places I belong, fake textures still remaining
The blind are paralyzed, pray for me, pray for me

Take my hand
