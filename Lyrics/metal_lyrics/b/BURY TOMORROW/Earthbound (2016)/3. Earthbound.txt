Do you remember a time,
When we looked to the stars at night?
Do you remember our lives,
Free from the poison, free from the lies?
Let me alter your surroundings
Step beyond all that you know
This could be the end of us
How far can our future go?

To live to feel the Earth in motion
I can see thereâs much hope in changing this world,
But no oneâs listening
Weâve been living our lives so long in denial,
Like whispers to the wind

EARTHBOUND!
We are shackled to the same ground
Our hope! One chance!

EARTHBOUND!
We are shackled to the same ground
Our hope! One chance!

This is a part of the future
I donât think Iâm ready to lose yet
We must be better than weâve ever shown
For your resolution
You should stand as you must
To bring life into a dying sun

To live to feel the Earth in motion
I can see thereâs much hope in changing this world,
But no oneâs listening
Weâve been living our lives so long in denial,
Like whispers to the wind

We were given one chance
To make this world our own
We were given one chance
To make this world our own
To let this becomeâ¦

DESOLATION!
Of all we know!
Desolation of our own!

To live to feel the Earth in motion, is all I need
I can see thereâs much hope in changing this world,
But no oneâs listening
Weâve been living our lives so long in denial,
Like whispers to the wind

EARTHBOUND!
We are shackled to the same ground
Our hope! One chance!

EARTHBOUND!
We are shackled to the same ground
Our hope! One chance!
