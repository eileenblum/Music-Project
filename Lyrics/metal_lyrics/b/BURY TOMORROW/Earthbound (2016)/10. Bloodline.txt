Welcome to the viper's nest
Don't look into my eyes for comfort
I'll make sure nothing's left
You've never seen anything as evil
I can see the strength within your eyes
Bu I know you've got death upon your lips
Feel the venom from our tongues
It's sick
I, the demon

I will show you how to lose control
Rip through the mask, reveal a face you've never known
Take from you the time you stole
All I'm owed
You must know

Get up
And show me what you think you've learned
I can tell right now you've never been burned
Or ripped apart at the seams
I'll show you disease
The serpent's scales don't weigh in your favor
There's no forgiveness, the is no saviour
Sentenced to the sickness

I will show you how to lose control
Rip through the mask, reveal a face you've never known
Take from you the time you stole
All I'm owed
You must know

Enemies of disease
Enemies
Enemies of disease
Enemies

So you think that you're a king amongst men
Once removed of crown, you'll never rule again

This is our bloodline
Risen from the depth
We have bleed enough times, drained, there's nothing left
This is our bloodline
We have bleed enough times
