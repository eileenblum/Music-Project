[feat. Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed]This is where the industry falls
Blow it up, blow it up, blow it up
Tear it down, tear it down, tear it down
It's time to rip apart the walls around your fortress
This isn't bitterness, this is our legacy
You could never be a part of anything real
You lie to sell and teach to steal

For all those whose only aim
Is destruction in search of selfish gain
I know that you will never learn
Fuck you for thinking I've been burned
We are the broken
But the fearless ones

You are nothing, you are worthless
Don't act like you've earned this
We will expose and let the truth be known

301!
Tell me where you came from
We are sick to death of hearing it
301!
Tell me where you came from
We are sick to death of hearing it

For all those whose only aim
Is destruction in search of selfish gain

I know that you will never learn
Fuck you for thinking I've been burned
We are the broken
But the fearless ones

Tell me where you've been and what you've done
And how you're better then everyone
Now you're perfect 'just because'
But to most you're a worthless cunt
No one fucking asked you, no one truly cares
Behind my back is your safest bet
Save us all your worthless threats
No on fucking asked you did I say care?
I know you're not the only judge
301
Tell me where you came from

I know that you will never learn
Fuck you for thinking I've been burned
We are the broken
But the fearless ones

I know that you will never learn
Fuck you for thinking I've been burned
We are the broken
But the fearless ones
