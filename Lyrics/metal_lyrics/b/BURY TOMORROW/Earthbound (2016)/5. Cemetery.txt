Amongst the old bones
Is where I call my home
Stories from the headstones
Old bones
Is where I call my home

I'd rather die than feel like this
To live in fire
Is it worth it for his sacrifice?
Far removed from the image in his mother's eye
This isn't life (this isn't life), this isn't life

Burn in the fire, the sulfur is stinging my eyes
Downfall of the liar, you have to pay for all you've sewn

Within the cemetery walls
Beyond the colour of stone
I've learned to know
Inside the cemetery walls
You're lost to bones
Within the cemetery walls
Beyond the colour of stone
I've learned to know
Inside the cemetery walls
You're lost to bones

Is there hope? Is there strength?
You've been looking to the sky for a while
And whilst I've made up my mind
You're seeking solace in the higher

I'm fucking buried,
I'm fucking buried in a shallow grave
I guess it's fear that holds me down
I am shrouded in the darkest of days
Will I be saved?

Within the cemetery walls
Beyond the colour of stone
I've learned to know
Inside the cemetery walls
You're lost to bones
Within the cemetery walls
Beyond the colour of stone
I've learned to know
Inside the cemetery walls
You're lost to bones

Was it worth it to sell your soul?
Was it worth it to know you'll always be alone?
Was it worth it to sit upon your fucking throne?
Was it worth it? I guess we'll never know
Was it worth it to sell your soul?
Was it worth it to know you'll always be alone?
Was it worth it to sit upon your fucking throne?
Was it worth it?
