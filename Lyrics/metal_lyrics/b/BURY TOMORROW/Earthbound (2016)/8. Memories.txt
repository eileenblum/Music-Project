Reveal the plan you have form me
Now I'm lost
Wandering endlessly
I hear
I hear their cries to me
Dragging me backwards eternally
Are you intent on returning me?
To the life I left so violently

I am fading
Forever falling
From the shadows
I hear you calling
Always drifting away
To never see the light of day

Just a memory gone
Just a memory lost without a cause
Just a memory gone
To be turned to an afterlife alone
Just a memory gone
Just a memory lost without a cause
Just a memory gone
To be turned to an afterlife alone

I have seen myself not in reflection
The broken promises that lead to no ascension
I regret my choice but what could I do?
I thought I did my best to be there for you
Cold

Just a memory gone
Just a memory lost without a cause
Just a memory gone
To be turned to an afterlife alone
Just a memory gone
Just a memory lost without a cause
Just a memory gone
To be turned to an afterlife alone

Just a memory gone
Just a memory lost without a cause
Just a memory gone
To be turned to an afterlife alone
Just a memory gone
Just a memory lost without a cause
Just a memory gone
To be turned to an afterlife alone

Just a memory gone (Just a memory gone)
Just a memory lost (Just a memory lost)
Just a memory gone
To be turned to an afterlife alone
