I am
Broken and cold
Restless and low
I am
A child alone
Lost in the road
I am
Broken and cold
Restless and low
I am
A body without a soul

Broken, I feel like my soul has been lifted
For 25 years I've been drifting
A shade so cold, a heart of stone
To the darkness I call my own
I am screaming
'Am I more then just flesh &amp; bone'

You don't want me to say, what I've wanted to say
It would unleash a hell
Worst than you've ever known

It wasn't ever meant to end in this way
We kept our heads below
The art of letting go
It wasn't ever meant to feel like this
No
We kept our heads below
The art of letting go

I am knotted, I am twisted
Silence, not a whisper
Mouth sewn shut, you never know who is listening
Haunted
So many things I could never say
For fear of destroying all the progress we've made

It wasn't ever meant to end in this way
We kept our heads below
The art of letting go
It wasn't ever meant to feel like this
No
We kept our heads below
The art of letting go

I am
Broken and cold
Restless and low
I am
A body without a soul
