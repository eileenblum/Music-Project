Follow the light
Down the tunnel
Just know I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you
Follow the light
Down the tunnel
Just know I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you

Learn to forget
Is what they tell me to
Destroy the past &amp; start new
I'd rather fade away
Than be dreaming awake

Have you ever laid on your back at night?
Stared into darkened corners
And seen faces of the dead alive?
Apparitions of a tormented mind

Let the light take my soul
I'm ready to let go
Lower my body below
Beyond the sky is home

Follow the light
Down the tunnel
Just know I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you

When they take me I will be happy
And when they take me I will be happy
I won't fear the touch of death
To see you standing next to me

Let the light take my soul
I'm ready to let go
Lower my body below
Beyond the sky is home
Let the light take my soul
I'm ready to let go
Lower my body below
Beyond the sky is home

A memory is not enough!

When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away
And I promise you I'll meet you at the gates
When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away
And I promise you I'll meet you at the gates
When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away
And I promise you I'll meet you at the gates
When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away
And I promise you I'll meet you at the gates

(When the light of day fades
My soul will drift away
And I promise you I'll meet you at the gates)
