I should've been first of know
When the cracks began to show
I guess I fell so
I guess I fell so; lost in the crowd
Not wanting to be found
We have to rise above
I just have to
I just have to

Hail no hero, fear no evil

So this is how I become
A man, alone, set free
The only way to survive
Integrity
The path I've walked down is one of uncertainty
So now the burden has gone I can believe

Just let it all go

See what I have seen
Believe, believe
Feel what I have felt
Believe

I have seen the depths of misery
Just one more year of this?
I don't think so, I don't think so
So I'll pass on the torch and I free myself from chains
I hope you can, I hope you can

Hail no hero, fear no evil

So this is how I become
A man, alone, set free
The only way to survive
Integrity
The path I've walked down is one of uncertainty
So now the burden has gone I can believe
I can believe

So take your cross back
And free me from the burden
So weightless I am lifted
And I'll let you feel your body sink
So take your cross back
And free me from the burden
So weightless I am lifted
And I'll let you feel your body sink

So this is how I become
A man, alone, set free
The only way to survive
Integrity
The path I've walked down is one of uncertainty
So now the burden has gone I can believe
