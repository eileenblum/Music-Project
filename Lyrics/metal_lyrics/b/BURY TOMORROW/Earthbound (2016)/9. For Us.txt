Remember this
Before you speak what's on your lips
You have to change the way you think
If not for me, for you

It seems we are born to hate
Eradicate, eradicate, eradicate
Open your eyes to lead the blind
We are the people under one sky
Listen and learn
Hear the ground shake
We're bound to, bound to, bound to break the laws the higher create
Living in a false sense of fate

Am I the only one who ever felt like this?

Remember this
Before you speak what's on your lips
You have to change the way you think
If not for me, for you
Remember this
Before you speak what's on your lips
You have to change the way you think
If not for me, for you

Can't you see we are bound to - break?
Can't you hear the ground shake?
Why must we allow others to dictate?
Can't you see that we are bound to break?

Remember this
Before you speak what's on your lips
You have to change the way you think
If not for me, for you
Remember this
Before you speak what's on your lips
You have to change the way you think
If not for me, for you

Whether it's the colour of someone's skin,
Or it's the god that they believe in,
It shouldn't matter
It's the same world we are living in
It doesn't have to feel like this
Enough

Fighting for borders that don't exist
Condemning others that try to resist

Remember this
Before you speak what's on your lips
You have to change the way you think
If not for me, for you
Remember this
Before you speak what's on your lips
You have to change the way you think
If not for me, for you
