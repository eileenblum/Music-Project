Let them hear us, let it be heard
Our bond will never be broken
No roads abandoned, no bridges burned

So follow us home
Our brothers wonât die alone
The future is ours to make it our own

Another year and the world keeps turning
No money could buy the lessons weâre learning
This family stands strong, to overcome it all
And we will never divide, never divide
Never divide the solid lines
Be proud of the choice of taking this side
Living out our lives

WE ARE THE BRAVE
WE ARE THE BRAVE

I feel that this is where we rise
Together looking for the light
It seems so clear to me now that we are, under the sun
I see us moving further on
The path that we first came upon
It seems so clear to me now that we are, under the sun

With our hands on our hearts
And our heads to the sky, heads to the sky
We stand as one, until we die

WE ARE THE BRAVE
WE ARE THE BRAVE

We will not abandon
No man left unsaved
Forever as one, nobody forgotten
We are the last of the brave

I feel that this is where we rise
Together looking for the light
It seems so clear to me now that we are, under the sun
I see us moving further on
The path that we first came upon
It seems so clear to me now that we are, under the sun

We seek no glory in vain, we are the last of the brave
We seek no glory in vain, we are the last of the brave
