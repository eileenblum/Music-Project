Fear of the sacred
We're blurring lines between the real and the fake here.
And so I scream, "Return to me.
Return to me. Return to me."

Breathe slowly; take shallow breaths
So I shut you down; there's nothing left
Why are all the saints sick of governing
the knowledge that we're insane?
Dear body, come to haunt me
We drive ourselves through the fire's light

"Free me," said the man on fire.
"Release me to the higher.
Fighting certainty I know, I won't regret this."
"Find me," said the man on fire.
"Release me to the higher.
Forever in the dark alone, forgotten."

My passion must be frightening
I just shout to the dark
And all I have is screaming
I see paranoia, dark is calling me
All the voices of the souls that used to be
I must find a way to drown out the sound
I must find a way to drown out the sound

"Free me," said the man on fire.
"Release me to the higher.
Fighting certainty I know, I won't regret this."
"Find me," said the man on fire.
"Release me to the higher.
Forever in the dark alone, forgotten."

Set me alight, for I am losing it.
Set me alight, for I am losing it.
Set me alight, for I am losing it.
Set me alight, for I am losing it.

Fear of the sacred
We're blurring lines between the real and the fake here.
And so I scream, "Return to me.
Return to me. Return to me."
