Take my hand
We are bound
You never have to feel alone
For we are found

Rise up all chosen
This is your moment to shine
âCause if you feel how I feel then thereâs nothing to fear âcause this is your life

I grant you eternity sat at my side
All I ask is for your loyalty until the end of time

You knew you could prey on my heart
You knew you could sell me from the start
Now I know that this could be the end of me
Falling for the same game that you sold to him
I see this for what it is, we need it to believe in
Youâve preyed upon us for the final time

Let go, lose control,
Forget the ones you used to know
We are your family, this is your home now
Donât fucking forget the mess we found you in
A gift turned a curse
A pact of blood until the end of the earth

You knew you could prey on my heart
You knew you could sell me from the start
Now I know that this could be the end of me
Falling for the same game that you sold to him
I see this for what it is, we need it to believe in
Youâve preyed upon us for the final time

Now I know that this could be the end of me
Falling for the same game that you sold to him
I see this for what it is, we need it to believe in
Youâve preyed upon us for the final time
