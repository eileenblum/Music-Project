We put all our hope in northern stars
I hope the end of the winter isnât too far
Itâs this chemistry thatâs forever pulling me
The feeling of wanting more than misery

Our hope is in each other
We must not stray from the path first chosen
As the light draws dim and the frost draws near
We must not fear
For it will clear

This is the path Iâve created
Hoping for the answers
Hoping that itâs not been in vain
Finding a way through the winter
Waiting for the harvest
Waiting to be rid of the cold

Move child
Now is the time
Weâve waited for these roots grow
And waited for the sun to shine
Leave now
Gather all you can
All our lifeâs work in one moment
Now stick to the plan
Stick to the plan

Year of the harvest
Hope of the lost
Year of the harvest
Hope of the lost

This is the path Iâve created
Hoping for the answers
Hoping that itâs not been in vain
Finding a way through the winter
Waiting for the harvest
Waiting to be rid of the cold

Rid of the cold
Itâs starting over and I cannot bear to consume
Trying to figure a way to get through

This is the path Iâve created
Hoping for the answers
Hoping that itâs not been in vain
Finding a way through the winter
Waiting for the harvest
Waiting to be rid of the cold
Rid of the cold
