[Bonus Track]Iâm told the end is not far away
Iâve seen the change, itâs ours to save
Before the sun has time, has time to fade
We must light the torch, to find our way

I felt the earth moving today
And I saw a change in the waves
The sky went from blue to black
And all leaves have all been burnt away

Iâm told the end is not far away
Iâve seen the change, itâs ours to save
Before the sun has time, has time to fade
We must light the torch, to find our way

Iâve heard the forest screaming
For help the riverâs pleading
How did we let it go this far?
Murderers

Iâm told the end is not far away
Iâve seen the change, itâs ours to save
Before the sun has time, has time to fade
We must light the torch, to find our way
