She beckons me, like a siren calling
Her bite will take your soul, frozen where you stand
My eyes have never seen her so cruel
The wrath she brings, steals the warmth of my soul

Draw near, let us keep our minds,
Donât let the dark and the cold take your lives
Hear our prayers
May the Godâs keep them near
Pray our shadows will appear
Hear our prayers
May the Godâs keep them near
We must hold on until the new year

Stay safe, until the frost is clear
To hide ourselves away, until the sun appears

Her voice upon the wind, letâs me know sheâs calling
Three have fallen, but we remain, surrounded
Pain turns to absent feeling

Our grasp may weaken but our hearts wonât be still

Draw near, let us keep our minds,
Donât let the dark and the cold take your lives
Hear our prayers
May the Godâs keep them near
Pray our shadows will appear
Hear our prayers
May the Godâs keep them near
We must hold on until the new year

Stay safe, until the frost is clear
To hide ourselves away, until the sun appears

Feel the cold, when the winds blow
Feel the cold, when the winds blow

Stay safe, until the frost is clear
To hide ourselves away, until the sun appears
Stay safe, until the frost is clear
To hide ourselves away, until the sun appears
