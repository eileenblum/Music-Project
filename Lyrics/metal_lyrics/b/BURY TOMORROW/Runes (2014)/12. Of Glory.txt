We are alive
We woke again to see the sun rise
When we were falling, falling from grace, did you catch us?
You never did, you never did
When we were falling, falling from grace, did you catch us?
You never did, you never did

We never asked you for your loyalty
But now the tides are changing
Itâs all you offer me
To break the chains that have been holding us
Weâve been held down too long to be free

Oppressor
Youâre perched so high that you canât hear us
Oppressor
I see your lies for what they truly are

Weâve remembered how this should be done
Weâve foreseen how life can move on
With the feeling that we can push through, it all
As our shackles fall away, remembering the glory days
We will never stray away, to forget the everlasting pain

This is our moment
To break the hold weâve always
Known

Weâve remembered how this should be done
Weâve foreseen how life can move on
With the feeling that we can push through, it all
As our shackles fall away, remembering the glory days
We will never stray away, to forget the everlasting pain

Oppressor
Youâre perched so high that you canât hear us
Oppressor
I see your lies for what they truly are

You said you were behind us but failed to see
At the end thereâs no time for defeat
Donât hold me back I feel full of belief
I am alive, we will not die

WE WILL NOT DIE

When we were falling, falling from grace, did you catch us?
You never did, you never did
When we were falling, falling from grace, did you catch us?
You never did, you never did
