[Bonus Track]All hail the dead
In our hearts and our heads
Press your ear to the wall
Hear them whisper it all
Stories of their bitter end
All hail the dead
In our hearts and our heads
Press your ear to the wall
Hear them whisper it all
Stories of their bitter end

The loved, the lost, they live in us
We must remember their names
Their memory must never die
For it canât be reclaimed

I will never forget you
But I will never forgive you
All the same
You left me on my knees again

I feel you breathing next to me
As I fall asleep itâs never hard to see
When I close my eyes,
I hear you, I hear you speak
I feel you breathing next to me
As I fall asleep itâs never hard to see
When I close my eyes,
I hear you, I hear you speak

All hail the dead
In our hearts and our heads
Press your ear to the wall
Hear them whisper it all
Stories of their bitter end

I feel you breathing next to me
As I fall asleep itâs never hard to see
When I close my eyes,
I hear you, I hear you speak
I feel you breathing next to me
As I fall asleep itâs never hard to see
When I close my eyes,
I hear you, I hear you speak

IN OUR HEARTS, YOU WILL FOREVER BE
IN OUR HEARTS, YOU WILL FOREVER BE
IN OUR HEARTS, YOU WILL FOREVER BE
IN OUR HEARTS, YOU WILL FOREVER BEâ¦
