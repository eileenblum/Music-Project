Iâm told the end is not far away
Iâve seen the change, itâs ours to save
Before the sun has time, has time to fade
We must light the torch, to find our way

I felt the earth moving today
And I saw a change in the waves
The sky went from blue to black
And all leaves have all been burnt away
We have to find a way to turn back the hands
Our time is running out, I can see it in the sands
Donât be afraid, for we can change
I have seen the future told, but itâs not set in stone

Free your soul before the fire consumes you
Ground yourself, before the winds remove you
Raise your head above, before the earth it buries you
Save your breath, before the waters they drown you

Iâm told the end is not far away
Iâve seen the change, itâs ours to save
Before the sun has time, has time to fade
We must light the torch, to find our way

Iâve heard the forest screaming
For help the riverâs pleading
How could we let it go this far?
Murderers
We have to find a way to turn back the hands
Our time is running out I can see it in the sands

The beacon of hope, shrouded in black
We have to see the dark away, just set the torch alight

Set the torch alight
Set the torch alight

Iâm told the end is not far away
Iâve seen the change, itâs ours to save
Before the sun has time, has time to fade
We must light the torch, to find our way
