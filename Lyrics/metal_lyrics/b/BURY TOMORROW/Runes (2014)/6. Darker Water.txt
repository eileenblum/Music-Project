I feel a storm is rising
The sound of the beast unleashing
This isnât how I want the story to play out
Thereâs something beneath the water, thatâs moving
The clarity in my reflection, Iâm losing
A serpent beneath the surface
A force that has been unharnessed
I cannot keep it bottled up anymore

Iâve become lost in the sea
Where saints become sinners
And hate needs to breathe
Iâve never felt this before
The darkest of feelings so far from the shore

Iâve been the viper since day one
Spitting venom with a forked tongue
The time has come, to shed the shadows
I, the demon unleashed

Thereâs something beneath the water, thatâs moving
The clarity in my reflection, Iâm losing
I see the serpent rising, I feel the rage is gathering
Iâm losing the battle between wrong and right

Iâve become lost in the sea
Where saints become sinners
And hate needs to breathe
Iâve never felt this before
The darkest of feelings so far from the shore

Iâve been the viper since day one
Spitting venom with a forked tongue
The time has come, to shed the shadows
I, the demon unleashed

The time has come, to shed the shadows
I, the demon unleashed
