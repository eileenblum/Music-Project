[Bonus Track]I am forever the watcher,
Oath sworn protector,
Foretold your savior,

I won't abandon you,
I cannot lose you,
I canât throw this hope away,
The hope you once knew

I pray this sickness never ends.
I will not leave you, to suffer at the hands of sin.
If I were silenced,
Your name, I would still speak it.

I am forever the watcher,
Oath sworn protector,
Foretold your savior,

I won't abandon you,
I cannot lose you,
I pray this sickness never ends.
I will not leave you, to suffer at the hands of sin.
If I were silenced,
Your name, I would still speak it.

If I were silenced,
Your name I would still speak it.
