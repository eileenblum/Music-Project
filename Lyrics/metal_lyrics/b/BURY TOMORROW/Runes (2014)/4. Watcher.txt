I am forever the watcher,
Oath sworn protector,
Foretold your saviour,

I won't abandon you,
I cannot lose you,
I won't throw this hope away,
the hope you once knew,

I pray this sickness never ends.
I will not leave you, to suffer at the hands
Of sin.
If I were silenced,
Your name I would still speak.

There isn't a moment that you will leave my eyes
As you become faint in person
You're stronger in my mind,
So fight the demon inside
Fight the demon inside

Let go, let others take control,
The poison will drain and the possession will lose its hold,

I am forever the watcher,
Oath sworn protector,
Foretold your saviour,
And I will never abandon you
I cannot ever lose you

I pray this sickness never ends.
I will not leave you, to suffer at the hands
Of sin.
If I were silenced,
Your name I would still speak.

I won't abandon you
I cannot lose you
I won't throw this all away
I won't abandon you
I cannot lose you
I won't throw this all away

I pray this sickness never ends.
I will not leave you, to suffer at the hands of sin.
If I were silenced,
Your name I would still speak.
