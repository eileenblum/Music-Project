Weâve seen the signs, we chose the path
Our fate was bound to stone
I saw a time we when we were free
A glimpse of pure redemption
I believe
That our luck is changing
We believe
Let our minds be our guide

I have seen, the lines of our journey
I have seen, a wealth worth earning
I believe, I believe uncertainty is the best for me

Iâm looking up into the sky
Reading in between the lines
The future will come for me
Iâm guided by the path that leads me

Iâm on the edge, too high to breathe
Yet I see it clearly, within my mind, never deviating
I believe
That our luck is changing
We believe
Let our minds be our guide

Follow me into the sky
My will is stronger now
The path burnt in my eyes
From the divine
Follow me into the sky
My will is stronger now
The path burnt in my eyes
From the divine

I have seen, the lines of our journey
I have seen, a wealth worth earning
I believe, I believe uncertainty is the best for me

Iâm looking up into the sky
Reading in between the lines
The future will come for me
Iâm guided by the path that leads me

Iâm looking up into the sky
Reading in between the lines
[?]
Reading these signs is the key

Follow me into the sky
My will is stronger now
The path burnt in my eyes
From the divine
Follow me into the sky
My will is stronger now
The path burnt in my eyes
From the divine
Follow me into the sky
My will is stronger now
The path burnt in my eyes
From the divine
