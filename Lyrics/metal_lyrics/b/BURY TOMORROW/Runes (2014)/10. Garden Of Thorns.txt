Look now, at what youâre becoming
Just an empty shell of the man I used to know
Because youâve paid the price
Youâve sold your soul and life
And now I hear them coming to drag you back to hell

Wash away the blood
But we still see the sin
Nothing short of hell is what youâre living in, living in
Wash away the blood
But we still see the sin
Nothing short of hell is what youâre living in, living in

A fear of falling through the cracks it guides me
I must stay away, be sure not to stray
A shot at fighting through the hate that fills me
I must stay away, be sure not to stray

What have you become?
Salvation comes to those who look above
I never said that this would be enough
Your sins are far great, youâve come here too late
This is your fate

To learn you must suffer
To repay debts youâve stolen
Repenting is now the only way
Or there is no salvation here
Get up off of your knees and learn how to bleed

Wash away the blood
But we still see the sin
Nothing short of hell is what youâre living in, living in
Wash away the blood
But we still see the sin
Nothing short of hell is what youâre living in, living in

A fear of falling through the cracks it guides me
I must stay away, be sure not to stray
A shot at fighting through the hate that fills me
I must stay away, be sure not to stray

What have you become?
Salvation comes to those who look above
I never said that this would be enough
Your sins are far great, youâve come here too late
What have you become?
Youâve sold the souls of all you know and love
I never said that this would be enough
Your sins are far too great,
Youâve come here too late
This is your fate
