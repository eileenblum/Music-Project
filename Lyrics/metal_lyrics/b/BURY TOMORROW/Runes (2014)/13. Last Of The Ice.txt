If you can hear us calling
Weâre breaking down the walls that lie between
Then you can see us living
Weâre living out the words for all to see
So you believe in me

Let me be the first to break down
The boundaries of what weâve always known
Iâm always telling you that you should just be you
Donât let them pull you down
If I could guide you like I was guided
I think we could succeed this time
Raise your hands high, reach for the light
Let us show them how to feel alive

For too long theyâve walled themselves away
But now the past is moving to the present

If you can hear us calling
Weâre breaking down the walls that lie between
Then you can see us living
Weâre living out the words for all to see
So you believe in me

Itâs not for a sense of mystery
Iâm calling you out as conceited
Raise your hand high, reach for the light
Let us show them how to feel alive

Being human is not a burden
Donât let them tell you different
We are equal
Being human is not a burden
Donât let them tell you different
We are equal

If you can hear us calling
Weâre breaking down the walls that lie between
Then you can see us living
Weâre living out the words for all to see
So you believe in me

Calling
Breaking down the walls that lie between
Then you can see us living
Living out the words for all to see
So you believe in me
