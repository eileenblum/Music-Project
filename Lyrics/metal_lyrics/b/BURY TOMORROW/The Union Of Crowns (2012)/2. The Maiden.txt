I will be dead before I lose
My chance to stop this and refuse
To pay the price for time it takes
To kill and stop before it breaks

I will take it all
Before I die
Holding back the truth
Will take over my life

A speech I knew I'd have to give one day
Maybe it would be better saved for another day
Who am I to say?

Who am I to say?

I'll be free without you
I'll be back to the start again
Without this weight around my neck
I can put this all to rest

I'll be free without you
I'll be back to the start again
Let's take this time to realise
Learn from what's been said

Find me among the ashes where I belong
How do I become stronger?
How do I survive this?
Find me among the ashes so where do I belong in this?

Ever morning world
Ever moving space
Maybe it would be better saved for another day

[2x]
I spoke to the maiden
She hasn't said a word
I told her I wasn't coming home
She knew she'd forever be alone

I'll be free without you
I'll be back to the start again
Without this weight around my neck
I can put this all to rest

I'll be free without you
I'll be back to the start again
Let's take this time to realise
Learn from what's been said

Find me among the ashes where I belong
How do I become stronger?
How do I survive this?
Find me among the ashes so where do I belong?

I'll be free without you
I'll be back to the start again
Without this weight around my neck
I can put this all to rest

I'll be free without you
I'll be back to the start again
Let's take this time to realise
Learn from what's been said
What's been said
What's been said
