Separate the life you once knew,
let me take you back to years ago; you never knew what I could do!
Weâre running out of time!

I am, the fucking viper!
The very venom that stings your tongue!
I am, the very demon..youâre not the man you thought you knew!

We went alone, into the world unknown,
it wasnât until later on, that my true face was shown.

I asked you for your soul, then corrupted all that was so beautiful.

Youâre alive but youâre barely living.
You were my saviour, I was your sin.

Exorcise me! Oh, the demon...the demon, it has me!

Always looking for a new horizon, nothing ever seems to satisfy me,
Iâm the new kind of monster, I am the cause, the catalyst and your
disease.
Iâm spreading the lies,
you need to sever the ties!
Youâre alive but youâre barely living.
You were my saviour, I was your sin.

The betrayal we were living in!
Nothing could prepare you for that life of sin!

We went alone, into the world unknown!
