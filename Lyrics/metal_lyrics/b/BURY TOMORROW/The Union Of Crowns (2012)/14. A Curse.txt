The way I feel has been a curse.
Forever lost...Â 
I should've learnt.
It's how you feel,
and what you thinkÂ 
combined as one
decide within.Â 

To write this overÂ 
to be around
I held your hands,Â 
though mine were bound.Â 

I'll never go back to the start
nothing would change here.
I'd break your heart.Â 
Never forget usÂ 
for it was real.
If we move on apart
in time, I'll heal.
