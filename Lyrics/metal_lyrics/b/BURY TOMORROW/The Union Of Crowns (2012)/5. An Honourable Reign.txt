Reign upon me, show me how I will survive. Try and tell me a way to feel alive. Bring it back to life, to whole new heights and tell me what is needed. I know you'll guide me home down this darkened road. Rain upon me, shower me with the tears of salvation. Hold me close, hold me near.

I find myself another year spent facing a wall... My life; our path has never been shown, but we move on. Fighting to keep our reign from them.

We will fall into the blacker sense of reason. Choose your side. I hope to God you pick the right one this time.

We are The Crown! We are The Crown! Stand up and scream it loud! Triumphant; immovable.

In darkness we find ourselves.

I knew we would pursue the right path, even if it was long. We haven't changed, we stay the same; ever strong.

Show me the new day...know as long as our hearts are beating, we will always find our way.
