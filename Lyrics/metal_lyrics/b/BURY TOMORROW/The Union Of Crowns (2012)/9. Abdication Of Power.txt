Iâll watch the life drain from your eyes,
Iâll pull the teeth from your smile, first let me just show you what itâs like to be alive.
Youâre nothing more than a parasite, spending all your life treading over all the ones you love.
You have cornered me for the last time and by the dawn,
I will rise again!

I look inside and canât forget the way you shot me down, just like an enemy, and thatâs all you are to me.
Itâs time for you to see what this has done, what you have become!
Too blind to see; you are my enemy!

What makes you think youâve gone unnoticed?
You were too blind,
I knew your game years ago.
Show me one good reason why I shouldnât remove the blood from your veins!
You took all I had and you tore it apart and set it into flames,
You made me a hollow shell, but by the dawn I will rise again!

I look inside and can't forget the way you shot me down like an enemy
And that's all you are to me
It's time for you to see what this has done, what you have become!
Too blind to see... You are my enemy

I'll stop fighting to believe

Never again will I trust you
Never again will I stand by your side
Never again will I trust you
Never again will I stand by your side

I look inside and can't forget the way you shot me down like an enemy
And that's all you are to me
It's time for you to see what this has done, what you have become!
Too blind to see... You are my enemy

I look inside and I can't forget
The way you prove me down
This time you've got what you deserved
I'm finished wasting time on you
