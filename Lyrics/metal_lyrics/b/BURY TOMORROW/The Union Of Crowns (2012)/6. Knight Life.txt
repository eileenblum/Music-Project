My life becoming worthless
I'll never learn, I'll never learn from it
My worth becoming senseless
I'll never learn, I'll never fucking learn

I live for the knight life
But nothing I can do can make me feel alive
Standing on my own tonight
My blurring vision, I see nothing in plain sight

I live for the knight life
But nothing I can do can make me feel alive
Standing on my own tonight
My blurring vision, I see nothing in plain sight

Have I taken this too far?
Have I gone over the edge?
Because I cannot believe in this or what anyone has said
I have broken this line...
I have wasted my time...
I need to grow up and move on
Before this takes over my life

Lie after lie I've shed and every chance I had
To finally better myself in life
I took all you had to give
It left me washed up and worthless in society

Overcome!

I know you'll never trust me
If I cannot ever trust myself
I know you'll never trust me
If I cannot ever trust myself

Have I taken this too far?
Have I gone over the edge?
Because I cannot believe in this or what anyone has said
I have broken this line...
I have wasted my time...
I need to grow up and move on
Before this takes over my life
