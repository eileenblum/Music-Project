Thereâs no sacrifice; you donât need to justify, free from all your shackles, sheâs gone but not forgotten.

Did she tear the tongue from your head? Are you voiceless now?
Speak up, speak up!
Did she tear the tongue from your head? Are you voiceless now?
Speak up, speak up!
It will never be the same.

I hear the serpent lies,
But I resist them this time,
For the message spoken
Will leave me broken...
I will suffocate.

I won't be, I won't be swayed, I know the game
I won't be, I won't be swayed, I know your fucking aim
It won't be long, forever torn, we can move on.
Itâs not the way we planned this, you arenât the one I loved when we first met that day!
Itâs changed and I canât stand it.
Donât try and test me, Iâve been locked inside your labyrinth for far too long, and now weâre breaking out!

It won't be long. Forever torn, we can move on
It's not the way we planned this
You aren't the one I loved when we first met that day
It's changed and I can't stand it

I hate the way you pushed me! My life became so empty, through times that hurt and killed you lost me.
Letâs break this chain and try to get free, letâs get through and break out, itâs for the best.
Put this to the rest; I will never forget, donât stop now; take it on, the final test!
See what this means... thereâs nothing left!
You need to hold inside and you need to realise she wasnât who you thought she could be.

Follow me, and Iâll show you,
Follow me, and Iâll show you who you used to be.
