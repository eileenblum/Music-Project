Will I be left here, alone in sadness?
I feel the end now, I've gone and lost this.

When I think of you from time to time
I know the differences means I'll wait a while
Until the sun rises on your side of town
I hope the signal I had can still be found

I feel alone, I fear I won't get through this
All this has shown; the truth in the madness.
It's time to breathe and know that you've got it.
All this has shown; the truth in the madness.

Will I be left here, alone in sadness?
I feel the end now, I've gone and lost this.

Can you not hear me? I can't keep trying...
I wouldn't leave this without an ending.

I have had my thoughts. I'm sure you've had your dreams.
When your life has no plan, you don't need schemes.
You learn that the road is a home and when the strangers stare, 
you know you're never alone. (Never alone)

I feel alone, I fear I won't get through this
All this has shown; the truth in the madness.
It's time to breathe and know that you've got it.
All this has shown; the truth in the madness.

Will I be left here, alone in sadness?
I feel the end now, I've gone and lost this.
