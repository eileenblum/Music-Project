Oh ive never seen myself before
spending all of my time in promised lands
and our home the only place ive ever known
im not alone

Lionheart
you were the one who had my back from the start
Lionheart
you were the one who had my back from the start
from the very start
Lionheart

Over and over and this is how it ends
time after time our passions never ends
this is where we came from
and this is were we met
faces remembered we'll never forget

Now is our chance to make a stand
this is the era of the common man
burn us alive with the fire thats in our eyes
burn us alive our bodies end where our souls survive

Over and over and this is how it ends
time after time our passion never ends
this is where we came from
and this is where we met
faces remembered we'll never forget

over and over
time after time
this is how it ends

over and over and this is how it ends
time after time our passions never ends
this is where we came from
and this is where we met
faces remembered we'll never forget
