Oh Lord, have mercy, don't tell me I have sinned...
For no one in this world has seen the sights that I have seen!
I wouldn't wish it upon my own worst enemy
I haven't slept in days, my reality fades...
I'm not sure that I'm awake

The dead are dead in your eyes, but they are alive in mine
The dead died in your lives, but the live in mine

I've looked for a lifetime, I've seen so many things
But nothing could be clearer in this god forsaken scene
So this is where I am now, just trying to survive!
I'm holding close this secret until the day I die

I know it 'cause I've seen it
I have been on my knees for weeks
I can't decide if it's a trick of the mind
Or the absence of sleep...
The absence of sleep?
If there's anyone within these four walls
Make yourself be known

The blood upon the walls is now upon my hands
The blood upon the walls is now upon my fucking hands!
The blood upon the walls is now upon my hands
The blood upon the walls is now upon my fucking hands!

I've looked for a lifetime, I've seen so many things
But nothing could be clearer in this god forsaken scene
So this is where I am now, just trying to survive!
I'm holding close this secret until the day I die

I see your bite marks baby
I'm not going to lie and say it's all okay
I see your bite marks baby
I'm not going to lie and say it's all okay
I see your bite marks baby
I'm not going to lie and say it's all okay
I see your bite marks baby
I'm not going to lie and say it's all okay

The blood upon the walls is now upon my hands
The blood upon the walls is now upon my fucking hands!
The blood upon the walls is now upon my hands
The blood upon the walls is now upon my ...
The blood upon the walls is now upon my fucking hands!
