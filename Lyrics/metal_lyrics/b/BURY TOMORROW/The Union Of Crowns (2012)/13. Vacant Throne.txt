Take it back to sanity; to reason,
we are lost, at the breaking point; half way between struggle and relief.

We have to find the way through; we have to find a way!
We have to find a way through to find a better day.

Vacant throne, we ought to know, that the only way that we can succeed is
to overthrow.

Release control, relinquish all youâve ever known!

Our father... creation rebuilding hope within our nation,
our mother... forgiveness, she helps us find the faith within us.
Take it back and back, to where we started,
through the wars we came; we fought and lasted.
Iâll go through hell to bring you down!
Take your life, your crown. The throne youâve lived with...weâll take it
all, no one can worship!
Iâll go through hell to bring you down,
take your life, your crown.
