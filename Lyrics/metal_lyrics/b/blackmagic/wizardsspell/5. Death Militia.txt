Roaring thunder from the skies
As day fades into night
A vast cloud of obscurity
Behold a crimson light
Plunging through the heavens
A storm of evil force
Dwellers of the underworld
Has come to kill you all

Coming from the sky
Death is all you see
When the end draws nigh
There's no escaping the death militia

Defenders of the evil throne
The lords of deaths domain
As lightning strikes the silent earth
Terrror rules again
Blades of steel carve through your flesh
Like a hammerblow from hell
And you enter eternal fire
Now you're inside his spell

Coming from the sky
Death is all you see
When the end draws nigh
There's no escaping the death militia
Death militia
Death militia
Death militia
