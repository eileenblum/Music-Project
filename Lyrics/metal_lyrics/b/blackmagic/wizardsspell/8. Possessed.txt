Darkness strikes the earth in the light of the day
Drawn into forever why can't I turn away!?
Screams of torment whispers of death
Morbid visions haunts me as I take my final breath

Possessed
Possessed

Welcome to beyond
Behold the sight of slaughtered corpses
Silent as a dead cold grave...
Only with life as a living dead
I face the sea of darkness!

Possessed
Possessed

Priests of doom evil spells
They have opened the seven gates of hell
With fire burning in their eyes
And so shall the living dead arise!
