Raging it's way through the mist of the night
A force which no one can explain
Evil not of this world comes to life
Things can never be the same
Obsessed by the horror
How can we escape
The sorcerer of souls
Soon there'll be nothing left in our brains
Demons are taking control

Whena black flash of light
Fire arise and thunder roars over the land
And out from the dark comes the armies of death
Killing at the beasts command
With cold blades of steel damnation will seal
And when the sky has turned to red
Then you'll face your final punishment
Can you hear to thunder of the undead

A hole in the sky as the hammer of hell
Crush through the chains of beyond
Cursed by the evil the wizard possess
Sad wings are destent to fall
Flesh eating winds tornados of sin
How can we ever survive?
When taking our breath
Militia of death
And the power of hell comes to life!

When trapped on the soulside no saviour for you
Satan laughs as you eternally rot
