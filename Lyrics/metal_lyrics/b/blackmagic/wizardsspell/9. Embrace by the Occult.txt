Hypnotic chants rules the night
Total darkness unholy rites
Cold winds emerge from below
The forest calls for my soul

Embraced by the occult
Under the freezing moon
Possess me as I burn
Rendering the rite of doom

In the shadow of the night
Among demons and ghouls
Where the fire's burning bright
Where Lucifer rules...

Embraced by the occult
Summon the fire and worship the unholy one
Embraced by the occult
Summon the dead tonight!
