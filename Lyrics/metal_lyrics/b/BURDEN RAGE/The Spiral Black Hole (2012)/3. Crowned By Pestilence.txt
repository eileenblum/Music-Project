[Lyrics by Vulcano]
Â 
My time has come to stay for good
The shape of things is too hard to see
Thereâs nothing new in this box made of steel
My finger points where the dusk eats the sun

Between the past and the future left nothing
Thereâs only a bridge that leads to pain
Here all my regrets are worthless
Because this wreath on my head forever remains

[Chorus:]
The will of be and the eternity
It seems a warpath between the world and me
The will of be is reaching the infinity
Until the end of times with this crown I must live

Come to my side and follow me in this path
Itâs full of children from ancient times
They whisper melodies that invoke the death
I beg for mercy in this endless trail

Between the past and the future left nothing
Thereâs only a being that in nothingness rests
Over my head hangs the crown of pestilence
I curse the day their king I became

There is no sanity, spectral fantasies
Schizophrenic own redemption
Despising morality

Contradictions lurking, destroying humanism
Still creeping in wicked grounds
Trying to reach the skies
The flock of haze now is back
Corrupting all inside
Peace is not a divine gift
Itâs just a way of life
