[Lyrics by Shawn/Toiran/Furno/Vulcano]

See the drowning of your life as I become a stronger god.
You donât belong to this secret paradise
Far beyond the fog.

Begin to gaze as the ground splits,
As the flames burn your will to live,
As your neck feels the devilâs breath.
No chance to run away from hell.

Chaos! This spiral black hole is draining souls through me
The nether path is narrow, dark and terrifying.
The crawling victims shed the guts and spill the brain.
The carcass of the corpses full of maggots will decay.

My land is surrounded by these abominations
Descend to this maze and you will find horrifying fate

Begin to gaze the chamber of your death
As the crows devour your meat
As your bones turn into coal
The final link between the fetter and your soul

Inmersed in the fog of my world desperated for a ray of light
Forgotten remnants of what once lived
Sentenced by their human condition my fury ate them all
Disciples of my wrath will be forever

I'm the void in the light, divine and ancient
Lurking in the dark universe, rejecting the sun

Redeem yourselves to this spiral black holeâ¦ and suffer!!!!!!

Ruins are all that remains in this wicked mortal world
No one lives after tasting my poisoned core
The life has expired in that useless rotten reign
The squeezed souls are now living through my veins.

More beings to sacrifice!
My hunger never ceases
I suffocate my victims till the last drop of their mind
More spiral black holes rising.
More power to consume
My greedy hunger nourishes
This circle never ends.
