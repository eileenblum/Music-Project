[Lyrics by Shawn/Toiran]

The lamb is awake now
You must open your eyes and see the rising
Of that who breathes fireÂ 

The seventh sealâs been broken
You must prepare now for the destruction
And raping of your thoughts

The dungeons are ready for hosting death
The plagues overrunning minds
Thereâs sulfur in your veins
An abscess in your face
Itâs too late for regrets

The wicked master will arise
You have been warned
Now get ready for total devastation

The greatest son of calamity
Begins to conquer this world, and you'll suffer
Until the end of days

The release of disease
The advent of this throne of perdition
For all eternity

âDo you think I am your saviour?
Nothing was ever further from the truth
I will destroy this whole existence
Avenge my torture with your total disappearance
Do you think that kneeling is the answer
Begging for deliverance, mercy and forgiveness?
Let me tell you, all your principles are a lie
Look around and see the weeping of the damned soulsâ

The wicked master has arisen
You have been burned
Now get ready for total desolation
