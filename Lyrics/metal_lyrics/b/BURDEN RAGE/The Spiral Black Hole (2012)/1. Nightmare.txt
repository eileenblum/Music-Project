[Lyrics by Shawn/Vulcano/Toiran]

This trail of cruel thoughts
Starts when I smashed all the laws
Forced to believe that wasnÂ´t real
This mind gets blind and the horror begins

Beaten and tortured
Iâm the prisoner of your rage
Misery is the only thing I know
Disillusionment runs through my veins

[Chorus:]
IÂ´m trapped in this dream of horrifying lies
And I canÂ´t wake up
IÂ´m living in this real nightmare
And I canÂ´t escape

Almost a life of calamity
Full of torment, a maze in my head
Unwanted existence
This mind gets blind and the horror always returns

Psychologically abused
Iâll only be free by killing their beliefsÂ Â Â 
Emptiness is the only thing I have
The shadows and sorrow take my heart

IÂ´m trapped in this dream
But seems to be real
This wounds in my skin
Remind me of the grief

Please take me away from this nightmare
I donÂ´t want to live this way anymore
Please take me away from this nightmare
I leave this place and you will never know

Please take me away!
