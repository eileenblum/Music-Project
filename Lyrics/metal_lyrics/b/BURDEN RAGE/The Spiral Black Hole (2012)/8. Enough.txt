[Lyrics by Furno/Shawn]

The Figures and their voices don't let me choose
They run and scream the prices that i've to pay
Sometimes (I've) mutilated people, sometimes I've burnt
This is when I will stop it and draw the line

Hollow of voices, how could I stop?

I'll drink a lot in the chosen date, never be enough
No letters on the table, neither named names
I'll slowly climb to the chair up and hang the rope
I'll put my head just through it, and let it go.

All the things I did, no one can forgive
Everytime I scream the past comes to me

I came to this dead end
This twisted mind (has) corrupted me
Step towards this sought end
My legs don't fell the floor
The rope dazed me
Collapses all my senses
Everything turns so black
My bastard guilt is not enough

I saw the fear sorrounding me and I've shared the pain
The lonely darkness fills my corroded brain
There's no light, no silence at the end of the way
No matter how you feel, I'm already dead...

Let my body decay
