[Lyrics by Shawn/Vulcano]

Growing in the womb of his dying mother
He will come for the second time
Preparing the annihilation
Our king will be born

[Chorus:]
With our sins he cleans his hands
And our body tortures without mercy
This time it won't bring light, only destruction
This is the end

The north star is shining again
The four horsemen have came from the abyss
She screams and dies in the night
The king of hypocrisy is born

From the skies a war begins
Domination is incomplete
He faces his father for all control
And kills him to inherit the throne
A black fate for mankind forever

All of them put their lives in his hands, now are all damned

The cross and crown are waiting for the human race
He has the power of god and brings Divine Punishment
Thereâs no pray or hope of salvationÂ 
Until the end he betrays all humanity

Years of lies come to the end
Now the real evil and truth have been released...
