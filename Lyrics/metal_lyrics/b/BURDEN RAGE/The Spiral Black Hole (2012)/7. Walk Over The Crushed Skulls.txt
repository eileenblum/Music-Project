[Lyrics by Vulcano/Shawn]

I follow the path of the purification
To preserve my soul
Forge my sword with innocent blood
I'm the knight of all this carnage
Â 
Guardians of time and protectors of the divine
Please donÂ´t throw me to the pit where the fallen lie

And now my victims, ageless spirits of this land
Beholders of my failure, witnesses unscrupulous
Trying to find my loophole, leaving this void behind
Return to my broken utopia and laugh in the face of God

Now take my hand to walk
Over the crushed skulls
It seems to be the only way to redeem our soul
Now come with me to roll
Over these endless flames
This is my scapegoat in this unknown world named death

I was deprived of my mortality
Trapped in this sinister hole with all my sins
Breathing all this death whoâs coming back to me
Wandering into nothingness, never to be released
