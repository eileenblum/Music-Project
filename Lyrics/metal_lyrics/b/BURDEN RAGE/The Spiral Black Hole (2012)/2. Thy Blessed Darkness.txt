[Lyrics by Vulcano/Shawn]

Unholy powers, reborn from the flames of rage
The lack of wisdom are pulling the strings of all despairs
Now we shall burn in the bonfire of all the sins
Â 
[Chorus:]
Forsaken kingdom crawling to the edge
The abyss calls to punish this mediocrity
For thousand years, only ashes will remain
The gates of oblivion are open to receive
Thy blessed Darkness
Â 
In the horizon, itÂ´s possible to see the past
Like herds of shadows, beating against us
Return for glory, sowing all misery
Â 
Upon the throne you see, images of ancient icons,
Dimensions of the minds which die in slavery
ThereÂ´s a voice inside, thereÂ´s a thorn within
And thereÂ´s no sickness that has not been released
ThereÂ´s a distant being,Â  pronouncing the entire race
And thereÂ´s a judgment, extracting the souls from the flesh
Â 
Their dead souls trapped in a glass
Among the rotten corpses of the fallen
Rebellions of shadows, show us the gate
Where the end of eternity is to come
