[Lyrics by Vulcano/Shawn/Toiran]

Chambers of repulsion and bodies on the walls
Hanging heads in darkest halls and columns made of bones
Welcome to the kingdom where the air smother lungs
Of bloody fates of horror and piles of corpses without essence

Diabolic nature the unholy art of sin
The flies eat the disposal flesh without any kind of blame
An ancient smell of death dwells in the tortures stairs
Years of scorn in this place have been carried out

And from the Mount Palatine the cult of anger rise
The Tiber River drains the blood of the ones who died
This bloodbath is a punishment for those who broke the rules
A trail of tombs absorbs their hostages to the holes
Organic sculptures and monoliths of flesh
Decorate the macabre agony of this place

[Chorus:]
The Gemonias overflowed by the masses
Of disfigured human structures and disgusting wrath
The impaled ones and the laments of the crucified
Constitute the core of this hell

And in the shadows a disgraceful fury arises
The beast destroys their flesh and feed of the unjustice
This bloodbath is a punishment for those who broke the rules
A trail of tombs absorbs their hostages to the holes
Organic sculptures and monoliths of flesh
Decorate the macabre agony of this place
