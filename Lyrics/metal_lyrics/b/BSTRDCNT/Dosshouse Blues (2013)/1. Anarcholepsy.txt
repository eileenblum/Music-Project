Too sautis ('lazy'), too self-involved
to live up to your fucking mouth
you think that we idolize
we all think you're a fucking clown

You lust, therefore, must
You've got no control
Feed your petty need
You've got no control

Kill the posers, they must die
kill the scene 'cause you're a lie
I hate your band, I hate your face
you're a fucking joke, disgrace

You lust, therefore, must
You've got no control
Feed your petty need
You've got no control
