Harvesting souls to fund crusades
pushing false hope, their madness reigns
all in the name ov placebo messiahs
a poisoned world that's damned to pyre

You've lost your self trying to find
something else to hide behind
so split my skull and drain my eyes
for I must slay this fictitious 'Christ'

Dogmatic principles adorn the farce
just mortal men with cauld, black hearts
so I will grin this open casket smile
for I'm long dead to this world defiled

I will shite
on your church
your vestments
shoved where it hurts

Burn your chapels
to the ground
as you plead
I hear no sound

Virgin whores
holy ghosts
I have heard
no greater joke

I am reality
that's why you
cant handle me

(we're) between the legs ov death
