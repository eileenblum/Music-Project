I gave you all that I had and you cant even give me the time ov day
call me a cunt behind my back 'cause I wont allow you your childish way
you're not a friend to anyone, you're like a bullet without a gun
weak as piss, cant stand your self, from your thoughts you run

I will not cease nor desist
life is not a right to exist
your presence will not be missed
time for you to suffer the fist

Suffer!

You try so hard to be the man but you cant even wipe your arse
try to wield authority with a jaw that's made ov glass
if it wasn't for me, you'd be on the street, think about that 'fore you call me a creep
endured your stench, endured your lies, now my rewards I shall reap

I will not cease nor desist
life is not a right to exist
your presence will not be missed
time for you to suffer the fist

Suffer the fist!

Sucking on a blast
booting up a fit
please be to turning around
and be suffering the fist

See you next Tuesday

Suffer the fist!
