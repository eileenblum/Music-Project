There's maggots in your skull
devouring your rotten brain
nothing seems to please much
too much skag and Jesus
and both are such demons

Decaying sacks ov wasted flesh
sheepish minds, knowledgeless
condemned to the poison you secrete
and living on your knees as if you had no feet

your bairns dead by your hand
a broken hourglass with no sand

Abolish humanity
