No knowledge ov what you are
no knowledge from where you come
know nothing ov the score
the life ov bacteria

You are the human plague
another futile exchange

Spawning filth to survive
a virus that blankets all
I am the vaccine
for all that stands in my way

You are the human plague
another futile exchange

(watch your back)

Why do I even waste my breath
when there's fuck-all oxygen left?
robbing us ov all that's good
yet wonder why tragedy befalls you

Left with nothing but my name
another futile exchange
You are the human plague
that which can not be saved
