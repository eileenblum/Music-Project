Will it never cease?
The pain of absence
Will you never subside?
By the time it had happened
I'd lived it a thousand times
Behind closed eyes
Its keen edge blunted
But the ache still resides

The cold eased its grip on my bones
This sun was the first I'd known
The mad chorus calmed at the touch of your hand
The voices disarmed

The wind calls my name
I dare not answer
I dare not speak

But had I known the collared throats
The hand on winter's wrist
Heard the command of your lying lips
I would have bitten off your tongue
During our first kiss

There was no misery
Nor sadness, nor pain
Oh how I long to be one with the void again
[2x]

Oh how I long to be one with the void again
The pain of absence
I'd lived it a thousand times
Oh how I long to be one with the void

&amp; the hand on winter's wrist
Heard the sound of your lying lips
(The frost could never be as cold as you)

I stand at the mountain before the abyss
(The wind calls my name)
Though the biting wind is cruel
(The wind calls my name)
Put the winter back in my veins
(The wind calls my name)
Because the frost could never be as cold as you
