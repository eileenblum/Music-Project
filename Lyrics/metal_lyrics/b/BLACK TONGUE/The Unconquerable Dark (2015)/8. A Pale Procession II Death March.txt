This world is in a tragic state.

Everywhere I look all I see is murder.
Everywhere I look all I see are mass graves.
All the people pushing to the front of the line of the Death March walk side by side into oblivion (Death March).
Take my hand and walk with me into extinction (Death March).

There is a darkness in man, darker than a pit pole to pole; a demon with an endless hunger and it calls the heart of man its home.

And the people are pushing, ever pushing, to get to the front of the line.
Did they see it coming?
Did they feel the stares and the hands at their backs when it was their time?

(Death March)

Was it the pains of life, or the way that we are designed, that leads us with our own hands to drive home the knife?

There is a darkness in man, darker than a pit pole to pole; a demon with an endless hunger and it calls the heart of man its home.

Watch as the darkness devours and is never sated until it feeds upon itself.
The darkness will devour.
