Let the wolf - Herald of fire, voice of ruin - run rampant, through the heavens.

His fangs carve a bloody swathe; red stains the maiden's gown.
Blood and the snow.
Her bonds tighten, her cancer stands to attention.
Blood and the snow.
Cough black tar into the dust.

The devouring son is risen.
Pray the earth is swallowed by the sun.
An infinite night.

[Chorus:]
This cold is all consuming, I dread these shadows looming.
The sun is setting with the lights burning low.
Horned crowns and cloven hooves; the unthinking callow youth; these demons walk with a sickness in two.

I feel it growing [2x]

Walking the earth; creatures of deception, loathsome since birth.
Blood. Snow. Herald of fire. Voice of ruin.

[Chorus]

Horned crowns and cloven hooves
The unthinking callow youth
