As you get older your gaze is fixed over your shoulder, because if life has taught you one thing: you won't see the knife that is coming.
Everyone wears a mask and the mouth is always smiling; it is impossible to tell if they're laughing or crying.
It's in our nature to lie - constantly raising walls, now our hearts forever shrouded, leading only to pain and our minds always clouded.
It's in our nature to lie.

When it happens, I hope you cannot breathe and I hope that the walls close in.
And if by chance there is a heart in you... Well I hope it bleeds.
Blood flows as you grieve, spilling over your hands and rising up to your knees.
You can't stop it. I hope you panic.
And you know that it will never cease.
(Drown in a sea of misery)

Nothing is sacred, an eye for an eye.
There is none righteous.
It's in our nature to lie.

Depravity: it's a mother chalking lines while her child is in the womb and the father making use of the son that hasn't bloomed.
An entire race crippled by subconscious masquerade and the voice that's in your head screaming to get away.
Get away.

Show me where it hurts; I fucking hope it's everywhere.
Tell me how you feel, because I feel nothing.
Neither love nor lying, neither form nor void.
The regret before dying?
No. Nothing.

Blood flows as you grieve, spilling over your hands and rising up to your knees.
You can't stop it. I hope you panic.
And you know that it will never cease.
Drown in a sea of misery.

Nothing is sacred, an eye for an eye.
There is none righteous.
It's in our nature to lie.

Everyone wears a mask and the mouth is always smiling; it is impossible to tell if they're laughing or crying.
It's in our nature to lie - constantly raising walls, now our hearts forever shrouded, leading only to pain and our minds always clouded.
It's in our nature to lie.
