A fell darkness sweeps the land - Black Death.
Speak to the hearts of men.
I wist our words, control our breath.
A darkness that consumes, a darkness that imbues, we're nothing but a vessel for a necessary evil.

A city turns to ash - black death.
The flames grow tall, charred husks, blistered flesh.
This sickness forced our hand.
We had to take a stand against those who reprimand this necessary evil.

Everyone casts a shadow where even light can't reach.
It hides our deepest, darkest desires of which we dare not speak.

Curse the earth. Take it back.
The night is always darkest before the dawn, but there's still always black.

This is the way.
We are humanity - a walking scourge - the twilight phase of living disease.
We are humanity - a walking scourge that curses the earth.

Shall we rejoice that we live in dusk and not the night?
Is it enough to merely suffer?
After all, our sons will be the ones left alone against this final blight.
Shall we rejoice?
Shall we rejoice at the dying of the light?

Silence is deep as eternity, speech is shallow as time.
Onwards, always onwards, our unending misery in silence and doom: this eternal gloom.

Shall we rejoice that we live in dusk and not the night?
Is it enough to merely suffer?
After all, our sons will be the ones left alone against this final blight.
Shall we rejoice?
Shall we rejoice at the dying of the light?

Ruin upon ruin, boundless night.
Long is the path away from doubt, void of light.
