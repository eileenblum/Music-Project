The cross I bear cracks the earth at my feet.
For the love of god, stay away from me.
Everything I touch turns to rust, I'll only drag you down with me.

This world breaks us all.
All life is suffering and life is long
Nothing eases the pain, nothing halts the rain.
Nothing eases the pain; the sun will never shine on me again.

The winds whisper to me.
I await their call to feel death brush by my fingertips while the flames around me grow tall: a world consumed by fire and ice, with a beast on the throne condemning all life from a tower of morals and bone.

Nothing eases the pain.
The sun will never shine on me again.

The cross I bear cracks the earth at my feet.
For the love of god, stay away from me.
Everything I touch turns to rust, I'll only drag you down with me.

Pulled under (I'm falling apart).
Crumble to ash.
I can't articulate anything to anyone.

Is this living?
Who knew life could be so unforgiving?
I never asked for this, nor do I want to exist.
I don't want to exist.
