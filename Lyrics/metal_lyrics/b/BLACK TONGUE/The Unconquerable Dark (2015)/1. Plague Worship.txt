I live in the weak and the wounded.
I wait for what the wolves leave in their wake.
And when mankind draws its final breath, through its gaping mouth its soul I'll take.

The death cult is rising; join me in annihilation.
All will fall before the dark.
Eliminate the sufferers and those causing the suffering.
This is plague worship.
Now, kneel before the onset of human abolition.

Human life is scorned.
This is nihilism given form.
The only beings that are capable of evil - fulfill your moral duty and destroy your people.

Pestilence, decay and rot: a plague deity to wash away the sins of man.

Prostrate yourself before the altar of contagion.
Breathe in deep this gift of deadly exhalation.
Decay is the way of all things, careless of a peasant or king.
Only death prevails.

Prostrate yourself before the altar of contagion.
Prove your fealty to The Plague.
And when mankind draws its final breath, only death prevails.
