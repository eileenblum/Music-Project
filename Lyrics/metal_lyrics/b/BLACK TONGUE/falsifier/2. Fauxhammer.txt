UGH

How dare you convey to me that Iâm worthless
Without the balls to say it to my face?

Iâll watch you screaming as the world comes crashing down
You are an insult to the human race
BLEGH

How does it feel to be a victim of your false accusations
This is my retribution

For years Iâve been biting my fucking tongue
Now the blood is filling up my mouth
Before I choke I have to spit you out
This is the time that our worlds collide
My mind is free of doubt

STEP THE FUCK UP
They say that when youâre out for revenge
You better dig two graves
So believe me when I say
I will gladly split the earth
I will gladly split the earth twice
Iâll stay hanging above your head like the sword of Damocles
Iâll hunt you with everything Iâve got
Nothing left to lose
Nothing left for me
And when I run you into the ground
Scared and broken on your knees
Iâll carve my hate into your chest
How does it feel?
You never deserved me
Am I worthless?
