This is the City of Hate
We let the anger flow
Straight through our veins
This is the City of Hate
No youth, the lost soul state
We are bred in fear

And prepared to fight tooth and fucking nail
Against our enemies of truth
It didnât have to be anything close to this
How many lies must we be fed until weâre sick?

The taste of betrayal and deceit
I hate these city streets
Paved with fucking lies
Kids without direction and hollow eyes
This is the city of hate (of hatred)

We are the lost
A dead city of forgotten people
We are
HULL CITY HATE CREW
FUCK YOU

I hate these streets
They will never let me leave
This is the city of hate (of hatred)
