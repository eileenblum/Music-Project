This is the age of lies

The sins of the Father prophesised
They have built a foundation
On which they forged temporary structures
Houses of straw
Towers of sand
Monolithic in structure
But built by frail hands
Pillars and idols of man
Canât withstand the storms that followed

The waves of betrayal crash against these walls
And with fear in our hearts we watch them fall
Now the architects are safe in their tombs
Sheltered by the carcass of the mother they raped
Protected in death by the Earth

Now all thatâs left is this sea of shit with a film of gold painted over it
And the child now awake understands his fatherâs treachery
The Ocean reclaims this world

As he clings to the mast of this sinking ship
Timbers sinking down to the crushing depths
The Ocean reclaims this world

The waves of betrayal crash against these walls
And with fear in our hearts we watch them fall

Now the architects are safe in their tombs
Sheltered by the carcass of the mother they raped
Protected in death by the Earth

Under a blackened sky
The child of man is left to die
Bloated and swollen, he sinks down and joins the land
His fate sealed by his fatherâs own hand
Father, why?
How could you murder your child?
This wasteland is all thatâs left
And youâve condemned your son to this hell
