This world is in a tragic state
If we act then at least we decide our own fate

There's not long left, we shall not last
Resources depleting much too fast
We are an age of men made of glass
Intellect worsening as generations pass

Even our skies are filled with waste
Pieceby piece we are being encased

Crush our spirits
Destroy our Souls
Whilst youâre herding people with mind control
We will grab you by the throat
Held by the neck
Youâre starting to choke
Now your kingdom of ashes has been overthrown

I mourn for this world always kept in the dark
Every single fucking day is a funeral march
A pale procession follows at my back
This planet is dressed in black
Dressed in black

This world is doomed

Even our skies are filled with waste
Piece by piece we are being encased

There's nothing left, we will not last

Meteorites falling from the sky
A welcome embrace for those ready to die

No way back

Weâre all fucked

This is the price we pay for our apathy
Point the finger at yourself âcause you are to blame

I mourn for this world always kept in the dark
Every single fucking day is a funeral march
A pale procession follows at my back
This planet is dressed in black

Now youâve made your death bed out of waste and severed heads
Lay your bodies down
You will not survive

I will gladly walk an Earth where no human is left alive
