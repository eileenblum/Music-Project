Humans are a plague on earth

Conditioned for destruction since birth
Disrespectful for their selfish greed
Taking advantage for their own need
Creating disease, war and famine
Pollution, irreversible damage

Raping our land
Seeping out pollution
Deforestation
Causing mass extinction

These malevolent pigs will eventually fail

Their deeds of injustice cannot Prevail

Weâll be the ones to hammer the last fucking nail 

This is our fate

We are the generation of hate

The industrial revolution

Was the birth of our devolution

Humans are a plague on earth

Conditioned for destruction since birth
Taking nothing from the lessons weâve learned

As we choke on the smoke

Of the bridges weâve burned
Ire upon the Earth
This world is a sacrifice
We spread God's lies and bring demise
Ire upon the Earth

The decline of this Self righteous institution

Thatâs built upon corruption
This is our fate

We are the generation of hate
