I break through the veil beyond the plains of despair
I awake in Hell
What have I done?
I cannot look in the mirror
The man I see looking back isnât me
The voice inside my head is not my own
Every reflection is a fucking blasphemy
What kind of existence is this?
What part of the lie did I miss?
Fear has befallen me
I can't believe that every cloud I see has a silver lining
When everything keeps getting worse
And in this life that we grasp
There is no turning back
The decisions we make have a lasting effect
How can we be so wide awake yet still asleep?
Free my mind of misery
I still suffer
Draw the poison from my flesh
End my sorrow
Set me free
Stepping out of the light into the darkness
Turning around to find the door is closed
Breaking through the veil beyond the plains of despair
I awake in Hell
I can't believe that every cloud I see has a silver lining
When everything keeps getting worse
And in this life that we grasp there is no turning back
The decisions we make have a lasting effect
How can we be so wide awake yet still asleep?
