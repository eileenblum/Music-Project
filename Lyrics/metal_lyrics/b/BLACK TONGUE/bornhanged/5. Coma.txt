Fuck this world
I'm so sick of your temporary bullshit
I want the light at the end and I know how to get it
If it takes my life then I will gladly die
Open your mind
Realise we are slaves
Forced Draconian mind-state
Open your eyes
We live in a world made of smoke and mirrors
Bear witness to the problem at hand
Open your eyes
Bear witness to the sickness of man
You spend your lives trying to survive
You spend your days wasting away
I can't take this any longer
What doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger
Just wake up
There is no happiness
There is no love
Ash and the void
Extinguished suns
Rent flesh and blood
We spend our lives trying to survive
We spend our days wasting away
We can't take this any longer
What doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger
Martyr
I have become
My light is dying inside
Blackened the sun
Martyr
I have become
Send me to Hell 'cause I don't give a fuck
Open your eyes
Bear witness to the problem at hand
Open your eyes
Bear witness to the sickness of man
I'm so sick of this temporary bullshit
I want the light at the end and I know how to get it
If you could glimpse at the world inside my head
You'd scream until your lungs collapsed
Open your eyes
Martyr
I have become
My light is dying inside
Blackened the sun
Martyr
I have become
Send me to Hell 'cause I don't give a fuck
