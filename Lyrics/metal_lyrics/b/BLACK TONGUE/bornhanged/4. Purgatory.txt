Behold my pain
My soul is rotting away
I feel a little more crumble every day
The will to live or to breathe has gone
I've grown used to the stench of decay
I pull the nails out of my hands and feet
Try to move but the wounds still weep
And even if I can get rid of them
I'll still be crucified in the morning
My soul is rotting away
I live in purgatory
Purgatory endlessly repeating
Tormenting me
It wonât end 'till I stop breathing
There's a man living inside my head
He has my voice
But I never used to think the way he tells me I did
There's a man living inside my head
And he talks to me in the dead of night
Lying in my bed
And he says in my own voice
"You wish you were dead."
And Iâm starting to believe what he says
I wish I were dead
Behold my pain
Driven by a force past comprehension to a state of abject fear
Torn from conception
Birth
A perfect contradiction
Welcome death
Die before life begins
