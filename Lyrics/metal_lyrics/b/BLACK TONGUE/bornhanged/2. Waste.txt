We are the salt of the Earth
In that we salt this Earth with our bodies
Conceived as a curse
Condemned as a child of waste

We are born hanged
And we die in peace

Lay our bodies to rest
We do not fear death

Usurp our legacy
Spare us an eternity
In Hell

We are nothing but a jilted existence
Conscience in a prison of flesh
Forsaken life

Conceived as a curse
Condemned as a child of waste
We are born hanged
And we die in peace

One more second in this life and we'll break
Hopeless nothingness is all that we face
I can see the light
I can see the point of escape
Bring me the hangman
Let me slip through the gate

No heaven
No forgiveness
Born hanged into a world
To witness

I can see the light
I can see the point of escape

We treat death as a long lost friend
He gives us freedom from this world in the end
But strike me down
Take me instead
For when I was born
I was already dead
