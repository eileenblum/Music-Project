So as the world comes to an end
Men will beg for death
They'll beg for death
They'll never see the sun rise so let it set
And in those days at the end of the darkest road
Crying for their mothers to take them home
There's nothing left
There's nothing left
I don't want to see the sun rise so let it set
So set a fire in my flesh
Men will beg for death
They will beg for death
They will not find it
The Reaper flees from them like a shadow flees from the flame
They will not (they will never) find it
The Reaper flees from them like a shadow flees from the flame
This is what I've seen in the darkest parts of me
But don't get me wrong, I'm not a prophet
When the ground collapses beneath our feet
There's nothing we can do to stop it

"And the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth.
And to him was given the key to the bottomless pit."

Every night I pray
Please God let me die in my sleep
Or at least kill the voices in my head
There is no release
No respite
No peace
No place for a wretch like me
I throw myself into the sea
There is no release
No respite
No peace
No place for a wretch like me
Fragments of what once were beautiful minds are now scattered and fucking lost
This madness
A chamber of despair
Must be filled
Whatever the cost
This madness must end
Beg for death
Eclipse the world
We are the sun that cannot rise
Eclipse the world
We are the son thatâs born to die
This is what I've seen in the darkest parts of me
But don't get me wrong, I'm not a prophet
When the ground collapses beneath our feet
There's nothing we can do to stop it
This is what I've seen in the darkest parts of me
But don't get me wrong, I'm not a prophet
When the ground collapses beneath our feet
There's nothing we can do to stop it
Fuck
