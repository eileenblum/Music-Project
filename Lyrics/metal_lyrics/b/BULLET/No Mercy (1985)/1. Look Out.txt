Tonight's the night
Today's the day
I feel like flyin' away
Another drink
I'm feelin' fine
Lady let me drink your wine
Get myself in a dirty mood
This stuff must be good
Feel like flying away

You can see by the look in my eyes
You can feel by the touch of my skin
Baby, baby, I can't deny it

Look out
You better look out (look out)
I said look out
Look out for me

[Solo]

My heart is beatin'
My eyes are closed
I'm losin' the ground
From under my feet
This must be a dream
I started to pray
Get myself in the fast lane
This stuff must be good
I feel like flying away

You can see by the look in my eyes
You can feel by the touch of my skin
Baby, baby, I can't deny it

Look out
You better look out (look out)
I said look out
Look out for me

Look out
You better look out (look out)
I said look out
Look out for me

[Solo]

Look out
You better look out (look out)
Look out
Look out for me

Look out
You better look out (look out)
I said look out
Look out for me

Look out
You better look out (look out)
Look out
Look out for me

Look out
You better look out
