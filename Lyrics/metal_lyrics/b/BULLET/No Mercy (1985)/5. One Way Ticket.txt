I'm standing at the station
Waitin' for the very last train
Oh lady, how I've missed you
Can't get you out of my brain
My heart beats out of rhythm
I'm getting nearer to you
The miles go by so slowly
Can't find a thing to do

The nights alone, just aching, dead and gone
Rushing through the darkness, driving on and on

Train keep on rolling home
Rollin' on till the night is gone
Train keep on rolling home
When I'm home, I'll never leave you alone

You've been waiting at the station
Just starin' down the line
Don't expect too much babe
I couldn't spare a dime
I see your disappointment
But listen when I say
I've always been a drifter
Don't you want me to stay

The nights alone, just aching, dead and gone
Rushing through the darkness, driving on and on

Train keep on rolling home
Rollin' on till the night is gone
Train keep on rolling home
When I'm home, I'll never leave you alone

[Solo]

The nights alone, just aching, dead and gone
Rushing through the darkness, driving on and on

Train keep on rolling home
Rollin' on till the night is gone
Train keep on rolling home
When I'm home, I'll never leave you alone

Hey train
Keep on rollin'
Keep on rollin' home
