Baby we can talk
Talk all night if you want
But if you feel you love me
Please take it all

Baby, in your eyes
I can see that light
I can read you want me
Don't be so shy

What can I say
What can I do
To show you, that I love you baby
Unbroken dreams
Paradise screams
We'll fly high, fly sky high

Girl, let's take our chance
It's more than just a romance
It's more than words can say
Words can't explain

What can I say
What can I do
To show you, that I love you, baby
Unbroken dreams
Paradise screams
We'll fly high, fly sky high

[Solo]

What can I say
What can I do
To show you, that I love you baby
Unbroken dreams
Paradise screams
We'll fly high, fly sky high, oh baby

What can I say
What can I do
To show you, that I love you baby
Unbroken dreams
Paradise screams
We'll fly high, fly sky high

Baby, we can fly
Fly sky high
Fly, fly sky high
