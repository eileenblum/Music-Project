Don't tell me that it has to be
No escaping from World War III
On the streets there's a different cry
Politicians sitting high and dry

No mercy, no mercy
No mercy, no mercy

Who can run from the Holocaust
Countries melting for no good cause
Sixteen hands control our dreams
But who'll be here to hear our screams

[Solo]

See the strong man bend and shake
Earth and heaven, all will quake
Took so long to the this far
But poison hands now drive the car

No mercy, no mercy (no mercy)
No mercy (no mercy)
No mercy (no mercy)
No mercy (no mercy)

Hell will be the only place to hide
