Yeah, hound dog worry, 'cause I'll fetch ya tonight
You got your chance now it's gone
Yeah, she's my babe and you knew it all the time
I know you used her for fun

Expect no mercy tonight
No other way than a fight
Ain't got no fear, step aside
Ain't no place to hide

Just me or you
No place for two
You ain't got that right
I know what's mine

I told it to you forty five hundred times
To keep your hands off my chick
Yeah you didn't listen, now revenge is mine
So get yourself into this

Expect no mercy tonight
It has to end in a fight
Ain't got no fear, step aside
Ain't no place to hide

Just me or you
No place for two
You ain't got that right
I know what's mine, what's mine

[Solo]

Just me or you
No place for two
You ain't got that right
I know what's mine

Just me or you (just me or you)
No place for two
You ain't got that right (you ain't got that right)
I know what's mine

Just me or you (just me or you)
No place for two
You ain't got that right (you ain't got that right)
I know what's mine

Just me or you (just me or you)
No place for two
You ain't got that right (you ain't got that right)
I know what's mine
