I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna take you out tonight
I'm gonna give it to you

You want me to want you
You want me to need you
You want me, pretty baby
You want it, pretty baby
You want me, pretty woman
You want me, pretty woman
You want me to want you
You want me to need you
You want me, pretty baby
You want it, pretty baby
You want me, pretty woman
You want it

I take you out tonight
I'm gonna show you my world
I give you everything you need
Just take my hand and we'll walk away

You want me to want you
You want me to need you
You want me, pretty baby
You want me, pretty baby
You want me, pretty woman

I take you out tonight
I'm gonna show you my world
I give you everything you need
Just take my hand and we'll walk away

[Solo]

Hey you, what the hell are you doin'
Hey don't walk away
I was so pleased to meet you
So don't let me down

You want me to want you
You want me to need you
You want me pretty baby
You want it pretty baby
You want me pretty woman
You want me pretty baby
You want me to want you
You want me to need you
You want me pretty baby
You want me pretty baby
You want me pretty baby
You want me
