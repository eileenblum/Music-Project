sold my soul, my soul to rock 'n' roll
Now I am losin' my mind
I sold my soul, now I can tell
The devil's got me, on the line

Every night, hot stage light
We all wanna bring you in tune
Every night's like a deadly fight
Time is short, we'll dig it soon
The show is over, the lights are out
The smoke just fades away
Hotel bed, last song in my head
Still feel the beat, still feel the heat

I sold my soul, my soul to rock 'n' roll
Now I am losin' my mind
I sold my soul, now I can tell
The devil's got me, on the line

[Solo]

Another stage, another town
Another heavy metal show
Always give my best, feel I need a rest
But nothing's gonna stop me now
The show is over, the lights are out
The smoke just fades away
Hotel bed, last song in my head
Still feel the beat, still feel the heat

I sold my soul, my soul to rock 'n' roll
Now I am losin' my mind
I sold my soul, now I can tell
The devil's got me, on the line
The devil's got me, on the line

The devil's got me, on the line
