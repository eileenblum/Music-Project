Hey come on
I think we'll have a really good time
Hey you
To spend the night with me ain't no crime
All I need tonight
Is a case of champagne on ice
If you want a piece of the action
Then take my advice

Feel so good, baby
There can't be no better place
To spend my time with you, babe
All my sorrows fade away

Hey come on
Another drink before the lights go out
Oh Lord
I wanna scream and shout
Feelin' dizzy
I can't believe my eyes
Don't wanna think of tomorrow
Tomorrow's time enough to die

Feel so good, baby
There can't be no better place
To spend my time with you, babe
All my sorrows fade away

[Solo]

Feel so good, baby
There can't be no better place
To spend my time with you, babe
All my sorrows fade away

Feel so good, baby
There can't be no better place
To spend my time with you, babe
All my sorrows fade away
