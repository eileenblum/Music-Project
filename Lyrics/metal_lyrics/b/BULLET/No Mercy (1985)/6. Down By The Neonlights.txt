Guess I've always been a gambler
Lived my life from day to day
Drunken night owl, midnight rambler
I don't care, won't change my way
It's survival in the city
With your back against the wall
Life's so hard but seems so pretty
When you hear that night voice call

Down by the neon lights
Meet me in the corner bar
Down by the neon lights
Step inside my brand new car
Down by the neon lights
Hot legged girls and shady guys
Down by the neon lights
The face of night's so bright but full of lies

Break the rules of law and order
Be an outlaw for one night
But take care of this small border
Behind there's violence and crime
Like a fool you'll spend your money
Discos, bars and gamblin' halls
Life's so hard but seems so pretty
When you hear that night voice call

Down by the neon lights
Meet me in the corner bar
Down by the neon lights
Step inside my brand new car
Down by the neon lights
Hot legged girls and shady guys
Down by the neon lights
The face of night's so bright but full of lies
So full of lies
So full of lies
So full of lies

Down by the neon lights
Meet me in the corner bar
Down by the neon lights
Step inside my brand new car
Down by the neon lights
Hot legged girls and shady guys
Down by the neon lights
The face of night's so bright
The face of night's so bright
The face of night's so bright but full of lies
