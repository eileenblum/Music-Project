Now it's time, The clock is nine
You've been waiting in the line
Forget it all, It's your call
Your ignition is our mission

Midnight hour
We gonna blow it up
Midnight hour
And we will never stop

The show is on, We're all as one
You know all doubts are gone
I always said bang your head
Rock'n'roll, Out of control

You're the fire
And I am the dynamite
