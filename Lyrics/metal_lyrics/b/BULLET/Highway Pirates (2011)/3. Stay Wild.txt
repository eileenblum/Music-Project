Another drink, another bar
Wild women and loud guitars
Let's loose control we're on the run
Full speed, ears bleed
Yeah that's all we need
We want it all while we're still young

Stay wild

We're mean and extreme
A fire breathing steam machine
Right to the top we ain't coming down
Plug us in, turn on the light
We gonna boogie tonight
We want it all while we're still young

Stay wild

Stay wild in the streets
Wild between the sheets
Wild in the hair
Wild everywhere
Always do what you wanna do
There's no doubt for me and you

Stay wild
