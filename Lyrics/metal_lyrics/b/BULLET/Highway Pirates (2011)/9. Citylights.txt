You keep on talking 'bout  the rocking dude
You never had a clue
And when I'm asking of your favorite band
You don't understand

I bring you truth when I say you're out of your mind
I'm gone and I know what I wanna find

Listen 'cause tonight I face the city lights
Tell me who are you that won't raise hell and shout

I put my fate in a cold dry gin
And sink another drink
The I race you for the Nr.1
Got no time to think

You waste your time when you say I'm out of my mind
I'm gone and I know what I wanna find

Listen 'cause tonight I face the city lights
Listen 'cause tonight, tonight, I know things will be alright

I'm on the midnight run, the midnight run
Far away from the sun, I'm on the midnight run again
