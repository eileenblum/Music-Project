Witching hour, close to midnight 
We rise when the full moon strikes
Yeah ahead is the open road
Switched on to the rebellion mode

Legacy from the past
We are the highway pirates
In the middle of the night
We are the highway pirates

This is not a masquerade
It's the way we look
Wild at heart we enter to win
Dressed in back we live in a sin
