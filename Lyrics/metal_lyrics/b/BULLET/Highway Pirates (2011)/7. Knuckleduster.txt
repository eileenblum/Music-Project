I got my aim locked betwen your eyes
I'v been holding back one too many times
And if you wanna play my game
Well I'm not the one to blame

When you're in the dirt
Eating dust tonight

Beware, there's a price on your head
Look out, my vision is turning red
You don't even know my name
Still you wanna play my game

Until you're in the dirt
Eating dust tonight

Got all my senses open wide
Crossing boundaries to the other side
I can see it in your eyes
You wanna roll the dice

Until you're in the dirt
Eating dust tonight

You can run but you cannot hide
