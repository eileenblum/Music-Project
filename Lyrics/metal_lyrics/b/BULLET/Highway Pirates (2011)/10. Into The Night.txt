Something haunts me when the darkness arrives 
It compels me when the night comes crashing down

I race the city streets through the neon lights
Out on the highway, I'm going into the night

I'm on the fire, I'm electrified
With dark desires impossible to fight

No remorse, no obstacles in sight
Out on the highway, I'm going into the night

I defy the night to seek what the darkness hides from me
I deny the light to find the treasures the eye cannot see

Into the night

Something haunts me when the darkness arrives
It compels me, speed is all I need
