You know the feeling when the good times coming your way
We're back on the road, what more can I say ??
Let's have a drink we're hanging out
No time to think just scream and shout

Turn it up
Scream and shout
That's right
Let it out
Shout all night 
We're back on the road

They try to tell me wich way I'm supposed to take
To worry 'bout things like that makes my head ache
We're in the mood the night is young
Let's hit the road we've just begun
