You got a caravan, I got no place to stay
Hey gipsy woman, Can I stay with you ??
My woman ditched me for no reason at all
You're my last chance, I got no one to call

Naggin' on me night and day
Now I'm off to stay with my

Caravan Woman, She's my caravan woman
Caravan woman, she makes my blood run hot

Once I had a nice place, Once I had a home
Those glory days are forever gone
Your wagon looks cozy, Please let me in
Takin' care of your neighbour is not a sin

Naggin' on me night and day
Shut up woman when you hear me say
