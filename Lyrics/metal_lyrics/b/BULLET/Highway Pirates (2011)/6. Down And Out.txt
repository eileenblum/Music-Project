I'm on my way to a paradise hell
I wanna go, cause I know
I know the crooks and I know what they sell
I want it all, I wanna crawl

I wanna go where the moon shines all night
Where the wolf's howl till morning light

Cause I'm down, down and out
But I'm still on my feet, spinning around
And I'm down, down and out
Spinning round and round and round

Hey pretty baby, Can I follow you ??
Let me know, I wanna go
We can do it all before the evening is through
You wanna know, I'm gonna show

I'm gonna show you where the moon shines all night
And by the morning I'll be out of sight

I'm in a daze
I'm nowhere bound
Stuck in a haze
My feet don't touch the ground
