I shoot straight heavy metal dynamite
Something shakes the ground tonight
Time to run and I can tell
There's no speed limit on the road to hell

And I like it
I do

No worries 'bout tomorrow
No worries 'bout tonight
Something's on my mind and it's alright

On and on
Rock'n'roll
Got my face to the floor, I can't take it anymore
But I like it

But tonight
I'm heavy metal dynamite
