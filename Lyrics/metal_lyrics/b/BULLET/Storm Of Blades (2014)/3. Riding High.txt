Ride on, join our forces
It's time to meet again
In the streets in the alleyways
Let the game begin

And we ride on
Ride the sky
Ride on
Through another night
We'll be riding high

Raise your cup
And swallow the poison
Propane in my veins
Lap up
And raise your voices
Comin' on like a bullet train

And we ride on
Ride the sky
Ride on
Through another night
We'll be riding high
