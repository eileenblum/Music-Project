Burning on
Forge the hammer, maul the sledge
Raw power
Pound the anvils ridge

The tide is turning
Dark age recalled
Fate's emerging for us all

Hammer down
Hammer down
Battering the ground
Hammer down
Hammer down

Under siege
Grind the axe, make the stand
Uprising
Break shackles from the hands

Red-hot ashes
And dust awaits
Breach the walls and ram the gates

Hammer down
Hammer down
Battering the ground
Hammer down
Hammer down

[Lead: Alex]

Hammer down
Hammer down
Battering the ground
Hammer down
Hammer down
