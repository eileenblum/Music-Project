[Lead: Alex]

Up ahead where the road stretch out
Asphalt bending in the pale moonlight
On the run, gotta go
Vagabond life, desperado
Howlin' blues of the wolverine
Year twenty-thirteen

I'm down
I'm down in the crossfire line
Crossfire

Try to fit but the rules don't apply
Cross the bridge to the wild side
Full armor, Marshall roar
Vagabond life, desperado
Scandinavian leather, keep it clean
Year twenty-thirteen

I'm down
I'm down in the crossfire line
Crossfire

[Lead: Hampus]

I'm down
I'm down in the crossfire line
Crossfire
