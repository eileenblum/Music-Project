With strength in my fist
And force in the palm of my hand
Cyclones of vengeance will weaken
The ground where you stand
You wear the blinders
I choose the narrow way
I walk past, I look down
I spit in the pit where you lay

[Chorus:]
Run with the hunted
There's no going back
I'm way past the point of regret
Run with the hunted

[Lead: Alex]

I trigger my will
Sign in aim to K.O.
Straight in the firing line
We'll meet toe-to-toe
And as the bell tolls
The exits are all being jammed
The stronghold you hide in
Turn out to be made of sand

[Chorus]

[Lead: Alex]
[Harmony lead: Hampus &amp; Alex]

Run with the hunted
There's no going back
I'm way past the point of regret
Run with the hunted

[Chorus]

As time's running out
I sense that you're down for the count
Run with the hunted
