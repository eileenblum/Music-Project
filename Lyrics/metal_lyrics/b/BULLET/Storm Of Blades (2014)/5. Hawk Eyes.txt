Pierce through all that surround;
Watch from afar with laser sight
I can see from miles away
The things you try so hard to hide

Hawk eyes locked on you
Hawk eyes see you through
You're caught in my view

And then comes the nightfall
I got my claws aimed your way
And when you don't expect
The hunter catches the prey

Hawk eyes locked on you
Hawk eyes see you through
You're caught in my view

Attack / Prepare to strike
Deadly claws / Lethal bite

[Lead: Alex]
[Harmony lead: Alex &amp; Hampus]

Hawk eyes on the scout
Hawk eyes with laser sight
Hawk eyes locked on you
Hawk eyes see you through
You're caught in my view
