[Lead: Alex]

Vast open spaces
And relentless lands
On a journey bound to never end
A blood red horizon
Staring back to me
On the move as the sun descends

With wheels keep on rolling
A motor sworn to burn
Heart and soul destined to never learn

[Chorus:]
Clean shot
Power up
Through the smoke clouds
I'm coming in loud

[Lead: Hampus]

Blazing pipes at nighttime
Lightens up the dark
The goal is straight within my sight
Watched by the vultures
Caught in their eyes
I leave behind their dire cries

With wheels keep on rolling
A motor sworn to burn
Heart and soul destined to never learn
I'm highway bound

[Chorus]

[Lead: Alex]
[Harmony Lead: Alex &amp; Hampus]
[Lead: Alex]

With wheels keep on rolling
A motor sworn to burn
Heart and soul destined to never learn

[Chorus]
