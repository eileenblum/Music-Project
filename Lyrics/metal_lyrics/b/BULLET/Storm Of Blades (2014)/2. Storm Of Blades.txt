A shadow blocks out the sun
Will you hold fast or tremble and run
The foundation will shake
Will you bend or break

Deadly rain cutting clean
Like the blade of the guillotine

[Chorus:]
Heavy Metal!
Swords in a pitch black sky
Heavy metal!
Razors and flying knifes
Heavy metal!
Beware of the uprising wrath of hades
Prepare for a storm of blades

The hour is getting too late
And sharp is the edge of fate
Turn tio ash in a flash
There will be no shelter when blades starts to slash

[Chorus]

Hear the screams that cut through the skies
AN oncoming menace with purpose to slice
Be on lookout or be carved to shreds
The storm of blades will dice up your head

Cu! Slice!
Shred! Dice!

[Harmony lead: Alex &amp; Hampus]
[Lead: Alex]

Deadly rain cutting clean
Like the blade of the guillotine

[Chorus]
