[Lead: Alex]

It's on, here we go again
It's time to fly
Full speed, no regrets
With flaming eyes

Bruised and broken
Soaked in sweat
Force the entrance
Charge is set

Let's roll, no time to waste
Shake some dust
Change gear in burning flames
Away we ride

Sole survivors
Can't go wrong
Raging vengeance
We're pushing on

[Chorus:]
It's on
We're in your town tonight
It's on
So gimme all you got

[Lead: Alex]
[Lead: Hampus]
[Harmony Lead: Hampus &amp; Alex]

It's on, here we go again
Still stuck in time
Keep racing down the road
With flaming eyes

Bruised and broken
Soaked in sweat
Force the entrance
The charge is set

[Chorus]
