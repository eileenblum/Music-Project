Got you caught in the eye of the storm
Listen up and be warned
Feel the ground shake like an earthquake
This night is mine for me to take
Right now we turn it up
You better hold on to what you got

The world starts to spin

[Chorus:]
I'm high up in the sky
Tornado
You're caught in my eye
Tornado
Sparks begin to fly
Tornado
I twist and I turn I'm a
Tornado

Stand back, watch it all turn to waste
As I stir the sky up in a haze
Feel the earth rock, it's a battle shock
Spin around, twisted mind like a warlock
Kicked down, tough luck
You gotta hold onto what you got

The world starts to spin
Let the rampage begin

[Chorus]

[Lead: Alex]
[Lead: Hampus]

[Chorus]
