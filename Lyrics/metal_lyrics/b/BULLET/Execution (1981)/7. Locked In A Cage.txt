Come on baby, don't want to wait
We gonna have some fun tonight
Come on baby, time is late
You know I never give up a fight

Take care of me, you know I need to be free
I'm in a restless age, I feel like locked in a cage

Come on baby, get it hot
I need some crazy action now
Running sweat, knockin' blood
You are a great attraction, wow

I drink my booze, nothing to lose
This night could be the end of the game
Street fight, nothing to choose
To die is better than alive to be framed
