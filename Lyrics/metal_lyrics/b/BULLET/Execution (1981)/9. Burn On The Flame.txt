It's a Iong time ago since we met here
Down in this place
I just remember your body
Not even your face
You don't need to please me
For doing the same old crazy nice game
All you've got to do is

Burn on the flame, burn on the flame
Burn on the flame, burn on the flame

Let's remember the past
We had days full of laughter and fun
I still remember each hour
We spent here for love
You don't need to remind me
Of all those lovely nice days
All you've got to do is
