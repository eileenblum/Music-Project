Oh Lord I'm feeling blue tonight
This night wiil be my last
I've never known what's wrong or right
But I will do my best

'Cause it's my execution
When the sun will rise
Wait for my execution
In that Night

I've struggled all my life in mud
I never had a chance
The judge he spoke the death sentence
My iife ain't worth a pence

So people won't you pray for me
Oh Lord have mercy with me
They carry me to the hanging tree
A crowd gathers around
To wait for my execution
