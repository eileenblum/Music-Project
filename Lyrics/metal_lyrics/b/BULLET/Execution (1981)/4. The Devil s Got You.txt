A house out in the wilderness
They call it no men's home
But I know who's living there
It's the devil and the dogs of doom
I tried to find out at midnight
It was a full moon in the sky
I hide myself behind a rock
My heart was pumpin' and my throat so dry

The devil's got you, he's burning like fire
The devil's got you, he's burning like fire

I felt the evil, it was in the air
My heart was as cold as ice
He shook my bones and burned my hair
And then I heard his thundervoice
He said, I'll punish you with blindness
So you will never see the Iight
And you will always be my prisoner
And then he blew away my mind
And took me for a ride
