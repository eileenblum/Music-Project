When the night comes down
And when the sun turns black
And all the evil nightmares
Are trying to break my neck
Oh, it's a real blue feeling
Dying every day
My fate is wheelin' and dealin'
Like a damned poker play

It's going up, it's going down
But I don't like to play the clown
Ain't see no light, ain't see no hope
I'm just a dancer on a endless rope

And when the light goes out
And the flame of Iife burns low
And no one hears you shoutin'
That means the end of the show
I got that restless fever
Look at the signs on the wall
Yeah, I'm a foolish believer
Out in the distance they call
