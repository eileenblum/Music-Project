Baby, I want you to love me
Baby, you'll get what you need
Let's make a ride in our dreamboat
Baby, I can't stand the heat

I need your loving tonight
I want your loving tonight
I need your loving tonight
That would be alright, alright

Baby, I need you forever
Baby, let's make it together
Don't stop to hold me in your arms
Baby, I can't stand the heat
