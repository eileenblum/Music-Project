One day she came, stars of love in her eyes
But now she's gone, her love was only a lie
She left me standing right out In the rain
Like a poor lonely child

She didn't care about my endless pain
Oh Lord, she drove me wild

She was a cold hearted woman
And she knew it well
She was a cold long-legged woman
And she did so well
She was a cold hearted woman
And she knew it well
She was a cold long-legged woman
But now I wish her to hell

Take care good girl, what you're doing to me
Your love's so cheap that a blind man can see it
I Ieave you standing right out in the rain
Like a poor Ioneiy child
You no longer tease my mind
Oh Lord. I've got that right

I leave you standing right out in the rain
Like a poor lonely child
You no Ionger tease my mind
Oh Lord, I've got that right
