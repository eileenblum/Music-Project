Hey you, are you talking to me
Trying to teach me the way to be
Preaching so loud about your lifelong school
I need no reasons, I need no rules
Hey mister, do you wanna feel pain
Iâm coming on like a bullet train
Rocking so hard, rocking so fast
We blow the block like a shotgun blast
Ha ha ha

Raise Hell
Heavy metal rebel
Raise Hell
Raging black leather

Playing faster than ever before
Canât get enough, I always need more
Just plug me in, turn up the sound
We rock you up, you fall to the ground
Donât teach me how to live my life
I got a will as sharp as a knife
An open road is all I see
A metal rebel I was meant to be
Ha ha ha

Raise Hell
Heavy metal rebel
Raise Hell
Raging black leather

Hey you, are you talking to me
I never listen, canât you see
Try to find reasons to bring me down
Solid as a rock Iâm nailed to the ground
Hey mister, you better step back
You canât stand the coming attack
Iâm not alone, thereâs more of my kind
A metal rebel snorting a line
Ha ha ha

Raise Hell
Heavy metal rebel
Raise Hell
Raging black leather
Raise Hell
Heavy metal rebel
Raise Hell
Raging black leather
