I was born to ramble
You know I never think twice
I got no regression, honey
So letâs roll the dice

I always do what I wanna do
You will never understand
Iâm a rambling man
A rambling man

When I enter your hometown
You better be prepared
You know late night boozing
Until the last man stand

You might see me as crazy
You will never understand
Iâm a rambling man
A rambling man

Ramble
Iâm a rambling man
Ramble
Oh yeah, Iâm a man

If youâre starting a riot
You will see me there
Cause I was born fearless
And I still am

I got your daughter in my van
âCause she donât understand
Iâm a rambling man

Ramble
Iâm a rambling man
Oh yeah, Iâm a man
Iâm a rambling man
