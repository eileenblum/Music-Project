High heels, bad deals
She keeps me up at night
Fooling around, canât slow her down
She got the evil eye

A dirty woman, a dirty love
Dressed to kill, ready to thrill
She gives me what I need

Hard luck lady
Sheâs a rock n roll machine
Cold satisfaction
Raw, dirty and mean
Bad boys rising
Yeah, thatâs what we do
Cause the hard luck lady
The hard luck lady is you

Long hair, long legs
Sheâs a beast in black
Unleashed every night when she turns out the light
She got the evil eye

A dirty woman, a dirty love
Dressed to kill, ready to thrill
She gives me what I need

Hard luck lady
Sheâs a rock n roll machine
Cold satisfaction
Raw, dirty and mean
Bad boys rising
Yeah, thatâs what we do
Cause the hard luck lady
The hard luck lady is you

A dirty woman, a dirty love
Dressed to kill

Hard luck lady
Sheâs a rock n roll machine
Cold satisfaction
Raw, dirty and mean
Bad boys rising
Yeah, thatâs what we do
Cause the hard luck lady
The hard luck lady is you
