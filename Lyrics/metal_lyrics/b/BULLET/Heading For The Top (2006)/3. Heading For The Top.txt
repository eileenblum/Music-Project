Weâve been running out of gas
Running out of fuel
Weâre stuck in this hole
But weâre bound to continue
Life on the road
Always on the run
To seek new thrills
I was born to be the bad one

Itâs a burning desire
My engine blockâs running hot
Itâs time to jump in the fire
Weâre on our way

And weâre heading for the top

Some people say Iâm crazy
They call me insane
I guess theyâre right âcause I live to ride the fast lane
Living hard, dying while weâre young
Itâs fine by me, âcause I chose to be the wild one

Itâs a burning desire
My engine blockâs running hot
Itâs time to jump in the fire
Weâre on our way

And weâre heading for the top

I seek a life in first class cars
Pretty women in hotel bars
Nothing can stop me
Iâm gonna have it all

Itâs a burning desire
My engine blockâs running hot
Itâs time to jump in the fire
Weâre on our way
Weâre on our way

And weâre heading for the top
