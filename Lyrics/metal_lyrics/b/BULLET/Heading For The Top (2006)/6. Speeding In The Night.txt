Thereâs a feeling inside, the tension draws near
When time to ignite comes around
Thereâs a power to grind
No anguish or fear
When screaming hot steel starts to pound

The road sets me free
Thatâs all I wanted to be

Feel the pressure, the strain, desire to reign
Awaiting permission to run
Hear the roar of the engines, they call out for vengeance
A flash of green light and Iâm gone

The road sets me free
Thatâs all I wanted to be
Speeding in the night
Makes me feel alive

The road sets me free
Thatâs all I wanted to be
Speeding in the night
Makes me feel alive
