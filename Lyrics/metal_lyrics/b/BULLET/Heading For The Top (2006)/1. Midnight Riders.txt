Weâre moving out when the time is right
When the dusk has passed and eaten the light
Faster than all Iâm burning inside tonight
Speeding once more, weâre breaking the walls
We are dynamite, alright

Weâre the hunters close on your heels
Weâre the children of the night, bastards on wheels
Faster than all, Iâm burning inside tonight
Speeding once more, weâre breaking the walls
Weâre dynamite

Cause weâre the midnight riders
Breaking the rules
Tonight weâre running a rampage
Weâre the sinners and fighters
Aiming at you
Go on and challenge your fate
Cause weâre the midnight riders
Breaking the rules
Tonight weâre running a rampage
Weâre the sinners and fighters
Aiming at you
Go on and challenge your fate

A burn out at the end of the road
A flash of light I totally explode
Faster than all, Iâm burning inside tonight
Speeding once more, weâre breaking the walls
Weâre dynamite

Cause weâre the midnight riders
Breaking the rules
Tonight weâre running a rampage
Weâre the sinners and fighters
Aiming at you
Go on and challenge your fate
Cause weâre the midnight riders
Breaking the rules
Tonight weâre running a rampage
Weâre the sinners and fighters
Aiming at you
Go on and challenge your fate
