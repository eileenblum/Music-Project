Câmon with me babe, take the midnight train
I got some tickets to show
Just run away, break out of your cage
You got the guts to rock nâ roll
Letâs take the chance, letâs be a fool
I know youâre tired of it all
I say just come along and forget about your rules
Donât worry about your mama, she will be there too

Set it free, let it out
I wanna hear you shout

Get ready
Rock steady
I wanna hear you shout
Get ready
Rock steady
Weâre raging out tonight

We bring it on if you are ready or not
We bring it on for you
There is a fire, feel it getting hot
I see it burning in us all
Weâre rolling down, weâre moving out
Nothing will stand in our way
You know weâre getting strong
Get ready to shout
Get rid of your chains, thatâs what itâs all about

Set it free, let it out
I wanna hear you shout

Get ready
Rock steady
I wanna hear you shout
Get ready
Rock steady
Weâre raging out tonight

Get ready
Weâre running out of control
Cause we know
Itâs gonna save our soul

Sp set it free, let it out
I wanna hear you shout

Get ready
Rock steady
I wanna hear you shout
Get ready
Rock steady
Weâre raging out tonight

Get ready
Rock steady
I wanna hear you shout
Get ready
Rock steady
Weâre raging out tonight
