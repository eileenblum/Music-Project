I know whatâs your desire
Ohh, when itâs midnight
I bring you down for pleasure
I bring you down for pain

Donât you know, tonight the night has come
You will see, Iâll teach you right from wrong

I bring you leather love
Iâm hungry for you
Leather love
Are you ready for me, are you ready to feel the heat
Leather love
Iâm hungry for you
Leather love
Iâll teach you how to do

And when youâre down and dirty
Not your clothes, your mind
So get down on your knees
And do what I please

Donât you know, tonight the night has come
You will see, Iâll teach you right from wrong

I bring you leather love
Iâm hungry for you
Leather love
Are you ready for me, are you ready to feel the heat
Leather love
Iâm hungry for you
Leather love
Iâll teach you how to do

I bring you leather love
Iâm hungry for you
Leather love
Are you ready for me, are you ready to feel the heat
Leather love
Iâm hungry for you
Leather love
Are you ready to get down on your knees,
And do what I please
Leather love
Iâm hungry for you
Leather love
Iâll teach you how to do
