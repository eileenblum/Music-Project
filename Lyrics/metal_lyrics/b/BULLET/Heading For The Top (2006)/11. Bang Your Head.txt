Weâre driving out to the highway
Heading for the stage
Weâre back in chains and leather
You better be aware
Too much frustration inside me
Iâm waiting for something to begin
Hey you, Iâm a time bomb
Soon I will explode

Weâre sick of hearing you complaining
This is our life
We have our own beliefs
Heading for the top
Donât try to bring us down
Weâre never gonna stop
Hey you, Iâm a time bomb
Soon I will explode

Tonight weâre gonna rock
Weâre ready to burn
In to the pit
Thatâs where I belong

Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang your head
We wake up the dead
Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang your head
We wake up the dead

When the crowd begins to bang
Weâre ready to rock
In to the pit
Thatâs where I belong

Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang your head
We wake up the dead
Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang your head
We wake up the dead

Are you ready?
Come on, raise your fists
Bang your head
Show your fist and bang your head
