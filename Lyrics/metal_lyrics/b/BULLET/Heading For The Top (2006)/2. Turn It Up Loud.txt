Every day feels like the same but we know what we wanna do
We wanna turn it, turn it up loud
Thatâs what we have to do

Weâre as one with the sound, it takes us high
We canât get enough
More power, more gain
Letâs blow the fuse

Turn it up loud
Turn it up loud
Weâre one with the crowd
Turn it up loud
Turn it up loud
Weâre one with the crowd

We are the boys that bring you the noise
Right from the stage
You are the crowd, screaming so loud
Thereâs no me and you

Weâre as one with the sound, it takes us high
We canât get enough
More power, more gain
Letâs blow the fuse

Turn it up loud
Turn it up loud
Weâre one with the crowd
Turn it up loud
Turn it up loud
Weâre one with the crowd

Turn it up loud
Turn it up loud
Turn it up loud
Weâre one with the crowd

Turn it up loud
Turn it up loud
Weâre one with the crowd
Turn it up loud
Turn it up loud
Weâre one with the crowd
