The touch game, we got the stakes
A big word for us took apart
Down on to get it, just admit it
You got a job when they tell you to go

Run free in the fast lane
Wrong side of the track
If you find yourself get lost
Youâve got a long way back

Rush, rush hour
Iâm gonna go
Rush, rush hour
Iâm gonna go
Youâd better cut and win

The night still, itâs gonna count
You got the picture but back it off
Before you know, down in the cold
Your brain part before your soul

Run free in the fast lane
Wrong side of the track
If you find yourself get lost
Youâve got a long way back

Faces of strangers
You see them on pick
When itâs rush hour
Youâd better step on the gas

Rush, rush hour
Iâm gonna go
Rush, rush hour
Iâm gonna go
Youâd better cut and win

Rush, rush hour
Iâm gonna go
Rush, rush hour
Iâm gonna go
Rush, rush hour
Iâm gonna go
Rush, rush hour
Cut and win
Rush, rush hour
Iâm gonna go
