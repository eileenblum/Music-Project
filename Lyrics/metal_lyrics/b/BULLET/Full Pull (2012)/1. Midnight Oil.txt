We rise form the dungeons when itâs midnight hour
We get around falling in line and breaking ground
Thereâs a power blade into letâs go
Set the charge and itâs ready to blow

Turn to light after night

Feel the flames
Fire fills the sky
Send the flames
Just in their mind, the burning midnight oil

Weâll be dogs deliver lives by their command
Thereâs a spirit in there, just canât comprehend
Sunk the charge, you get name
Take back the charge you blame

Turn to light after night

Feel the flames
Fire fills the sky
Send the flames
Just in their mind, the burning midnight oil

Feel the flames
Fire fills the sky
Send the flames
Just in their mind, the burning midnight oil

Feel the flames
Fire fills the sky
Send the flames
Just in their mind, the burning midnight oil
