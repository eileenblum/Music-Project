[Bonus Track]If I swing by down was only just walking in the park
You bring me baby, longer the power
Rocking in the evening when the sun is down
Me and the dog, guess whoâs bringing âem down
Rocking and rolling as they get her away
It could be rolling, it could be rolling

Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Well let me be. Rocking and rolling free

Well all the apartments in the sweet Carolina
Just walking and rolling, baby get down
Down to be a switching lane in my pulley
Everything said, got my hold in wrong
Got to be excused, to ping pong bag
They got the rolling, they got the rolling

Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Well let me be. Rocking and rolling free

We countdown baby, got you with them wrong
Where is the shelter? Iâm rocking the pole
Just to be embarrassed sheâs rolling around
Ainât gonna walk through it, Iâm rolling it down
Got to scurginâ off the neighborhood
It could be rolling, it could be rolling

Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Weâre gonna roll, it got the moving on

Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
We can work on time, rocking and the roll

Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Just to put your eyes right off in your face

Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Something you said, rock in his roll

Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Get on! Get on baby! Get on!
Get on! Get on! Get on!
Get on!
