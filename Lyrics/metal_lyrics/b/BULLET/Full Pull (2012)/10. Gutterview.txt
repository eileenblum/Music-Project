Past and down the gutter
You cannot bring your point of view
Throw kinds the same lane
The cityâs closing in on you

From your Gutterview
From the Gutterview

Brought him in from the corner
Hanging by a thread from my stupid life
Flow kind and pity sake
Looking for some vent to pull you through

From your Gutterview
From the Gutterview

Bad things from the past
All things kind of sad
On and we ainât got a wheel
Going for the kill

The bad thing, we are vengeance
Letâs see tonight whoâll find the 2
Bring back the embrace
Donât let the city get to you

From your Gutterview
From the Gutterview
From the Gutterview
From the Gutterview
From the Gutterview
