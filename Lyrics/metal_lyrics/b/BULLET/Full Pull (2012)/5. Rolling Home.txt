Letâs reel the machine lights
Get started, rolling
Letâs put him a show, let the people get moving
Racing on the drive track
Never want to turn back
We gone out soon to make it last all night

There ainât no stopping once weâve got this far
Letâs burn the freeway down

Why you donât sway down in a rolling home?
Tear it down to the ground, just rolling on
Why you donât sway down in a rolling home?
Tear it down to the ground, just rolling on
We are rolling in a rolling home

Time to start it up
Get started, rolling
Play with ready
There ainât no party, you know it
Bumping down a dog path
Running with a wolf pack
If you didnât have guns this time
A long wait off

There ainât no stopping once weâve got this far
Letâs burn the freeway down

Why you donât sway down in a rolling home?
Tear it down to the ground, just rolling on
Why you donât sway down in a rolling home?
Tear it down to the ground, just rolling on
We are rolling in a rolling home

There ainât no stopping now
Letâs burn the freeway down
Come on

Why you donât sway down? (rolling home)
Tear it down to the ground (rolling on)

Why you donât sway down in a rolling home?
Tear it down to the ground, just rolling on
Why you donât sway down in a rolling home?
Tear it down to the ground, just rolling on
We are rolling in a rolling home

There ainât no stopping now
Letâs burn the freeway down
Letâs burn it down
