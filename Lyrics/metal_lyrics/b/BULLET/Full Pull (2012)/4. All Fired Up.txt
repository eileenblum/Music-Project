Once again we ravage its leads
Down to get it on, letters of steam
You made a point
You made it head over heels

Thatâs right
Theyâre right on top of you, donât know how it feels
Weâre ready
Weâre going steady

All fired up
All fired up and weâre ready to go
All fired up
All fired up and weâre ready to go

Let it loose, based out of loose
Rock ânâ roll city
You bang your head and you wait all day
Rock ânâ roll city

We may be crazy but weâre not out of form
No way
We keep on going til weâre fried on the floor
Weâre ready
Weâre going steady

All fired up
All fired up and weâre ready to go
All fired up
All fired up and weâre ready to go

Weâre gonna ride to the morning too
Shock âem all
We shake the city when weâre passing through
Weâre ready
Weâre going steady

All fired up (come on)
All fired up (what got wrong?)
All fired up (yea)
All fired up and weâre ready to go

All fired up
All fired up
All fired up
All fired up and weâre ready to go

All fired up
All fired up and weâre ready to go
All fired up
All fired up
All fired up
All fired up
All fired up
All fired up
All fired up..
