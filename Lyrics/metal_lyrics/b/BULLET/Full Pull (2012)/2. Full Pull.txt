Got the power, I got the kiss
This will be monsters running in here
Never surrender, never pull out
I canât go through it, now Iâm tied to it down

Full pull
Full, full pull
Full pull
Full, full pull

Unsuspecting, out on the road
Donât chill, await your fun
Iâll be the agent, Iâll be the heat
I canât lose, this will be my seat

Full pull
Full, full pull
Full pull
Full, full pull

Full pull
Full pull
Full pull
Full pull

On fire in the night
Whatâs he after? He know that itâs right
Got to get ready, got to move on
Burninâ weather âround of you

Full pull
Full, full pull
Full pull
Full, full pull

Full pull (what we are)
Full pull (Iâve got to take it)
Full pull (yea)
Full pull (Iâve got to win)

Full pull
Full pull
Full pull
Wow
