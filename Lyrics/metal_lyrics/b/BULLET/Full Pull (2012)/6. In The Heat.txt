Come on

Riding to full with nothing to gain
Afraid of darkness, thatâs shit my friend
Go go shape up, got something down
You pushed me up one too many times

Pull that trunk right down the wind
âCause weâre back to back
In the heat again
In the heat again

Do you want since when I have gone
And when youâre not, are you ready to do?
Iâve got a ring, now Iâve got this fine
And itâs really just start, 28 to it again

Pull that trunk right down the wind
âCause weâre back to back
In the heat again
Iâm in the heat again
Iâm in the heat again

Iâm in the heat again
In the heat again
Iâm in the heat again
Iâm in the heat again
