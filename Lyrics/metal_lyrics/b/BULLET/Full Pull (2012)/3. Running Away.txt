I pack a bag with all of my things
I pack a bag for good
Stuck in the rough, got my mind made off
Iâll leave the king the doll

My believers in the air from afar
Distant calling
Now Iâm down at the station
And I jump down to south bound plane

âCause Iâm running
Running away
âCause Iâm running
Running away

Everybodyâs nagging
Everybodyâs picking on me
Do this, do that
I just couldnât get them to leave

Somethingâs got to give
âCause nothing ever happens âround here
Now Iâm down at the station
And I jump down to south bound plane

âCause Iâm running
Running away
âCause Iâm running
Running away

âCause Iâm running
âCause Iâm running
Running away
âCause Iâm running
Running away
âCause Iâm running
Running away
âCause Iâm running
Running away
