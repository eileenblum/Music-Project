Weâre on the city streets, dead of night
A mind to quote through the dark
Blow the thing that surround the street lights
Casting shadows on the walls
Stopping this spell and run for days into the air

We walk the past streets, weâre all alive
Our minds are set to survive
They take me high, and Iâm in lines
But we donât stand to be confined
By the power of the members of the highest in our chain
Weâll both throw

One night on the run
When chairs will bring you home
One night in the city
When chairs will bring you home

Iâm on the path pace and the city rats
Weâre gonna break away, we are the warriors

We are the old crops through the bang
Growing up from underground
Thereâs a cold, winterâs sweeping in
Thatâs when winter final run

Then the tide shifts from the wind that does our things
But we groan to you

One night on the run
When chairs will bring you home
One night in the city
When chairs will bring you home

Iâm on the path pace and the city rats
Weâre gonna break away, we are the warriors

We are the warriors
