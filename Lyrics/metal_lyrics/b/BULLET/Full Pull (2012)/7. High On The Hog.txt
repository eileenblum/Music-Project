Sheâs got a smooth way of walking
Takes it down with a rude way of talking

Weâre just launched as it once was your way
There to live for one way
What you want? Sheâs got a gun
Sheâs gonna get your gun

Sheâs high on the hog
Gonna get you down and pull you up
High on the hog
I pray that weâre ready to roll, Iâm âbout to go
Thatâs right

Night time is right for a sweep
Had the prey like a wolf running free

Weâre just launched as it once was your way
There to live for one way
What you want? Sheâs got a gun
Sheâs gonna get your gun

Sheâs high on the hog
Gonna get you down and pull you up
High on the hog
I pray that weâre ready to roll, Iâm âbout to go
âBout to go

You know what Iâm talking about?
Sheâs high on the hog
Come on now
Mr. Detroit show me what you got

Sheâs high on the hog
Gonna get you to white off your lines
High on the hog (so high)
You know the kind, youâre coming up now
High on the hog
But always complaininâ and a woman defends you the boy
High on the hog
I pray that weâre ready to roll, Iâm âbout to go
âBout to go
