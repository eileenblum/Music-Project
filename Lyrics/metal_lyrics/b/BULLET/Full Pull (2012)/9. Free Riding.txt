I think the petty brought adults
Fear the will but I wonât
This new domain and I couldnât try it
Iâm not your average man
Itâs hard to understand in a working both man
You give it all you can

I canât stand, I canât stand it
Iâm in deep, Iâm never losing
Iâm gonna die, the fear of dying
Iâm riding on you
Free riding on you
Through and through
Free riding on you

Holes in my pocket, Iâm on a roll
Chasing the dime and itâs gone
Fall on you, beg him to
Mark ahead their fiends
Itâs all insane, all over again
I gave it all I can

I canât stand, I canât stand it
Iâm in deep, Iâm never losing
Iâm gonna die, the fear of dying
Iâm riding on you
Free riding on you
Through and through
Free riding on you

Riding on you
Free riding on you
Through and through
Free riding on you

Riding on you (Riding on you)
Free riding on you (Riding on you)
Through and through (Riding on you)
Free riding on you (Riding on you)
