Caught in a web
Gambling with empty hands
Try to fool the one who always stands
For much too long
Youâve been aiming for the first price
Made a move but you slipped on the rolling dice

Now trouble coming your way
Nowhere to run nowhere to stay
Raising the stakes but you know you will loose
Watch out âcause hell is catching up on you

Hey you!
Keep on running, donât stop for nothing
Hey you!
Keep on running, or pay the price

Live on the edge
And you wonât back down
But if you fall you will end up the clown
No turning back
Now what you gonna do
Listen up because I got news for you

Now trouble coming your way
Nowhere to run nowhere to stay
Acting the man but you know youâre a fool
Watch out âcause hell is catching up on you

Hey you!
Keep on running, donât stop for nothing
Hey you!
Keep on running, or pay the price
