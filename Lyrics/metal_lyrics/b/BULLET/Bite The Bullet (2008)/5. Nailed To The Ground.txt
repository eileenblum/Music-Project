You know the feeling when your heartbeat start to rush
Itâs here to take your soul
5000 miles away no matter where I roam
Two tire fire bring me home

I reign the streets as I leave my past behind
On my own that suits me fine
The earth is trembling as I nail it to the ground
When lightning strikes Iâm around

I seek the truth, The fastest man in town
The one whoâs next in line
I wonât escape a challenge if you dare to challenge me
Thatâs the only way to set my soul free

I reign the streets as I leave my past behind
On my own that suits me fine
The earth is trembling as I nail it to the ground
When lightning strikes Iâm around

Iâm nailed to the ground
Iâm nailed

I reign the streets as I leave my past behind
On my own that suits me fine
The earth is trembling as I nail it to the ground
When lightning strikes Iâm around
