Weâre rolling down going to the city
We gonna get it tonight
And all the girls looking so pretty
In the neon lights
Lets get rough itâs time to rip it up
Thereâs gonna be a shakedown
The boys are all here we gonna make it clear
That Hell is back in town

Because all night long from dusk til dawn
We gonna give it all we got
So buckle up and get ready to go
All night long from dusk til dawn
We gonna paint the town red
We gonna loose our heads

Weâre raging down town
In blue jeans and leather
And all the girls getting so wild
It couldnât get any better
Crimes in the night you better watch out
Weâre not looking for trouble
But if you want a scene and try to pick a fight
You gonna get some rumble

Because all night long from dusk til dawn
We gonna give it all we got
So buckle up and get ready to go
All night long from dusk til dawn
We gonna paint the town red
We gonna loose our heads

From dusk til dawn
