Listen up folks to what Iâm about to tell
Beware of what weâre about to do
Weâve been silent for long but always been strong
And now itâs the time to fight back

Weâll set your town on fire and leave it to burn
It will light up the night of the rebels return
Burst straight through your heart and into your soul
Weâre back for vengeance, weâre back for you

Midnightâs coming the rebels return
Weâre gonna make you burn

Weâre back to stay forever
Weâre back and weâre rockinâ all around town
This night we gonna change it all
Weâre back câmon hey!

Weâll set your town on fire and leave it to burn

Weâre back and weâre rockinâ all around town
This night we gonna change it all
Weâre back câmon hey!

Weâre back to stay forever
Weâre back and weâre rockinâ all around town
This night we gonna change it all
Weâre back câmon hey!
