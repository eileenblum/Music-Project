I know youâre tired of your boss, Your daytime job
Youâre sick of paying dues
And youâve had it with your stupid girlfriend
Sheâs giving you the blues

But forget about your everyday loads tonight
Remedy is coming your way
Avenge the world with the sound and light
Come on we gonna rock this town tonight

Youâre like a preacher when no one believes
And so you hit the streets
Youâre like a doctor but thereâd no disease
Why donât you join the feast

And forget about your everyday loads tonight
Remedy is coming your way
Avenge the world with the sound and light
Come on we gonna rock this town tonight

Join the crowd raise your hands and yell
We gonna rock this town all the way down to hell

Join the crowd raise your hands and yell
We gonna rock this town all the way down to hell

You gotta spit it out whatâs pulling you down
And say 1 2 3 4 party time!
Take your troubles and throw them away
Set yourself free before itâs to late

Join the crowd raise your hands and yell
We gonna rock this town all the way down to hell
