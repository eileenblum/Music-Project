The hotter it gets the closer weâre to hell
You can not break free you can not break the spell

Thrills in the night the rise of full moon light
Ready for action release your reaction

It is time to set your spirit free
What are you waiting for?
I stand up and shout
Rock us tonight!

The hotter it gets the closer weâre to hell
You will not break free you wonât break the spell

It is time to set your spirit free
What are you waiting for?
I stand up and shout
Rock us tonight!

The reason to rumble
The reason to rock
No reason for nothing
I do what I want
Itâs your time to choose
Give âem all you got
You got nothing to lose

It is time to set your spirit free
What are you waiting for?
I stand up and shout
Rock us tonight!
