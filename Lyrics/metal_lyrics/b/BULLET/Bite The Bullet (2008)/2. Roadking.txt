Out on the street thereâs gonna be some action
I wonât hesitate no time to waste
Smoke round my wheels good signs for good deals
650 horses hell yeah it feels

There are no boundaries for me
No way Iâll change
High speedâs my satisfaction
Alright!

Wild king, Roadking
Spinning wheels are smoking
Wild thing, Roadking
What a mean machine

You better run you better not stay here
Time is something you should fear
Down the highway you wanna play by the rules
If you canât run the line your ride is mine

There are no boundaries for me
No way Iâll change
High speedâs my satisfaction
Alright!

Wild king, Roadking
Spinning wheels are smoking
Wild thing, Roadking
What a mean
Sheâs a mean machine

Wild king, Roadking
Spinning wheels are smoking
Wild thing, Roadking
What a mean
Sheâs a mean machine
