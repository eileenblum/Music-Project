Open skies above, Highway floating by below
Iâm running tracks of flames and smoking burnt rubber
Can you feel the heat? The sound of the engine beat
Got no destination, I measure my route in gasoline

I gotta find myself some space
This dirty old town that I call home
You know I canât stand that place

The wheels keep on turning
Let the fuel keep on burning

Got no time to waste, Got no plans to settle down
I just want to run away from this godforsaken town
Working 9 to 5, What a way to waste my mind
Got no regression Iâm just leave it all behind

I gotta find myself some space
This dirty old town that I call home
You know I canât stand that place

The wheels keep on turning
Let the fuel keep on burning

Open skies above, Highway floating by below
Iâm running tracks of flames and smoking burnt rubber
Can you feel the heat? The sound of the engine beat
Got no destination, I measure my route in gasoline

I gotta find myself some space
This dirty old town that I call home
You know I canât stand that place

The wheels keep on turning
Let the fuel keep on burning
