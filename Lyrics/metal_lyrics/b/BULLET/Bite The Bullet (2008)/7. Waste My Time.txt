Welcome to the city, The city of sins
Welcome to a place where no one wins
Nowhere to go no place to hide
I canât return from where I am

There is no turning back
Always on the run
This place is killing me

Donât wanna waste my time

Desert streets from hell descends
Ghostlike shadows nailed to the walls
Nowhere to go no place to
I canât return from where I am

There is no turning back
Always on the run
This place is killing me

Donât wanna waste my time

There is no turning back
Always on the run
This place is killing me

Donât wanna waste my time
