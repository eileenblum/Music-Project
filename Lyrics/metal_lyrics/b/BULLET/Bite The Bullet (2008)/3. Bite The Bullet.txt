She was a girl with opinions about everything
Who found out the hard way
That I am her king

Every night without a fight she bite the bullet

She Bite
She Bite the bullet
She Bite
She Bite the bullet

I know that Iâm not a beauty but I play rock nâ roll
Well thatâs all is takes folks
For girls to loose control

Every night without a fight she bite the bullet

She Bite
She Bite the bullet
She Bite
She Bite the bullet

She used to tease me every Friday night
But now she just please me
And it feels so god damned right

Every night without a fight she bite the bullet

She Bite
She Bite the bullet
She Bite

Are you ready to bite?
The bullet
