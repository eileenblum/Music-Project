Oh no, not me
Dare I think about it?
They're leaving me all alone
How low? How mean
I think I'm getting the taste for it

I need you on the telephone
Like now
I feel you
I'd kill for it
I'm ready for it

Oh no, not me
Raving on about it
They really left me all alone
How low? How mean
So easy when you think about it
I'll never hang up - it is on

What in heaven's name did they do to you?
I feel you
No one lasts forever yes it's true
I feel you
I'd kill for it
I'm ready for it

Halls of inquisition
Kill it, reposition (sic)
All along the ledges
People standing, waiting to get shoved
