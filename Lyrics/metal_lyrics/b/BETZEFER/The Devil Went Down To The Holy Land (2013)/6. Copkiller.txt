"Goodbye, us two soon shall meet"
Were his very last words as he took to the streets
Not sure if he'll live up to his word
As he lived by his pride and will fall by their sword

He was a
Cop killer
A whole city was there to reclaim
By a cop
Killer
Not to trust yet never to blame

It was his fate
There came the date
When serving
Got degrading
With nothing to lose he was up for the fight
All alone had to stand up for everyone's rights

He was a
Cop killer
The last bastion of freedom for all
Was a cop
Killer
Who won't stop till he's dead and gone

They knew all along...
