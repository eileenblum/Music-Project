It's funny 'cause it's true
The way you let yourself away...
To hate yourself like you do
Must be a talent

That ring around your finger
Could it be something you loath?
Tell me where's your halo
Baby come on

Just notice when you reach for the stars,
They're never easy to grab
Let all the accusations fly from you forever

That ring around your finger
Could it be something you loath?
Tell me where's your halo
Baby come on

Just notice when you reach for the stars,
They're never easy to grab
Let all the accusations fly and when you finally take
That one good look at yourself
Don't be alarmed by the disgrace
(You were just a little blind)
'Cause LOVE cures everything
And you got addicted to the Medic

Why can't you see
You got addicted to the Medic
