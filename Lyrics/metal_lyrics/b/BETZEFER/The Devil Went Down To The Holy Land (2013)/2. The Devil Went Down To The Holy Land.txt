The devil went down to the Holy Land
Saw it was already fucked and he thought to himself
"What a mess, beautiful mess, my bidding is done"

Not a man could be trusted even by his own brother
And the people were scared as they hated each other
What a mess, beautiful mess, Rock n'Roll

Thought police was firmly in control
And little girls went on display, just trying to fill a hole

And I thought to myself
"Where is the innocence?"
And that it's no surprise it's been so god damn hot as of late
We're never gonna be cold...
You know the Devil is lord

The Devil went down to the Holy Land
He took a piss on our backs and we could swear it was rain
What a beautiful piece of mess, Rock n'Roll

Thought police was firmly in control
And little girls went on display, just trying to fill a hole

And I thought to myself
"Where is the innocence?"
And that it's no surprise it's been so god damn hot as of late
We're never gonna be cold...
You know the Devil is lord
