Until the day is done
Surely I'll be gone
Can you hear me now..?

Some days are all about envy
Some days are all about gain
Some days can't get out of bed, dear
And some days there's just ain't no rest for the wicked

Some days you can not believe it
In others, you wish it was wrong
Some days you can't help but notice that
Your own foresight was simply too strong

Taking good care of your children
And taking good care of your wife
It's a life-long commitment
Here's a bottle of bleach, a knife and your plane ticket
