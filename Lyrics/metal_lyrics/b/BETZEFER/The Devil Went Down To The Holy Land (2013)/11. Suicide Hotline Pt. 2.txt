Oh no, I'm a liar
It's the dent in your smile
Causing the friction
Oh no, what a riot
It was never the sex
Just the affliction

I'm all about receiving it
And my television set is on it
It's too late for any real action
And my fluctuations grab me by the tongue

Oh no, what a riot
Just a piece of your led
Left in my meat, still
Oh no, I'm a liar
Such a terrible day
Just give me a reason

Let out a sigh
You can't deny
You take my call
We only stall

I'm all about receiving it
And my television set is on it
It's too late for any real action
And my fluctuations grab me by the tongue

All tired of regret
You'll be soon to forget
That all my love is a lie
You caught a glimpse of my eye

Oh no, I'm a liar
It's the dent in your smile
Causing the friction
