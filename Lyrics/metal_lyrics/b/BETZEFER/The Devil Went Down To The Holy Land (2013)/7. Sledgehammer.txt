I take the bullet for you
It makes me feel OK
Love sticks and I'm rejected
Could be I might just take offence

Would you reassess it for me?

This screams amateurism
Fail, your pet elephant stepped on the scale

Let's both promise to never surrender
Hail!
It's the sledgehammer beating on the rusty nail...

I filled your tank with anger
You drained up all of mine
I slept since last December
Oh happy birthday, it's your time

Don't you kinda feel like a second class mime?

This reeks amateurism
Dead. I got rabid dogs pulling my sled

Let's both promise to never surrender
Hail!
It's the sledgehammer beating on the rusty nail...

The silence I have here with the riot you've got there
Somehow they make for the peace we share together

Because you and me, baby, make 75% a human being
