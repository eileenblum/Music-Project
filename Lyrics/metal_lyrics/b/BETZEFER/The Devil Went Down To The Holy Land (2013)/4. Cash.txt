Look at all that cash!
Baby cold hard cash
Falling from the ceiling
It's creating affection in us all
Stand up for your right
Take it to the place where nobody else thinks about it

And away and away and away we go
'Till it hurts and we lost all control
And I don't feel obliged to pay

You know it has to get better some day...

I'm the turmoil man
Rubbing everybody in the wrongest of ways
It's only fair
So stand up and admit
I'm headed to that place where it's all in the mix, you know it

That away and away and away we go
'Till it hurts and we lost all control
And I don't feel obliged to pay

And away and away and away we go
'Till it hurts and we lost all control
And I don't feel obliged to pay

You know it has to get better some day...
