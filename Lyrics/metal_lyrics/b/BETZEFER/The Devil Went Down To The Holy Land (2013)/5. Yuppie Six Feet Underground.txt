The way it occurred to my head
That I'd rather be dead just
Made my heart wanna stop
Living fast is easy - ask me how!

You'll bask in your riches
And I'll be dead and gone
Pay your bills while I am resting
Sure sounds like lots of fun

The way I learned that today
Was the longest I'd stay has
Made it OK
To say "hey,
Life could be much worse so
Let's play hard"

It's the travelling light that lets me feel the abundance
Can't I score a hole at one?
I'd rather keep retrying
Staying poor means working hard, you know

You'll bask in your riches
And I'll be dead and gone
Pay your bills while I am resting
Sure sounds like lots of fun

And as I live on in
The hearts of everyone
You'll stay the same old rotting
Yuppie six feet underground
