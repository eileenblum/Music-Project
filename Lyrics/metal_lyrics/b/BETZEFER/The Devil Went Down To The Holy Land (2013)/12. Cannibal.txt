Watch my step
Smell my waking terror
Test me for signs of weakness
Trace my blood

Catch me fall
I felt my fatal error
Right about when I thought
I heard you say

"Hell, it's full of ways to slay you
But I'd travel to unknown extents
And I'd eat someone
Let it be a lesson to you all" 

Now I'm caught
In between the living
Living in between
The dead and I

One last touch from a midnight savior
One last time to hear you say

"Hell, it's full of ways to slay you
But I'd travel to unknown extents
And I'd eat someone
As a lesson to you all"
