Well I've been getting the hunch
That there isn't much of a fuss around you lately
And I've been setting straight
What's to anticipate
Because I know that you wanted more

And I've been killing the view
That you feel anew
'Cause let's face it - you're gone tomorrow
It could be yesterday,
There would be hell to pay
Right now it's anybody's game

Tell me what you think of that old man, show me your plan...

So just take what you can
While you're able
Not to give anything in return
Because to give it all is to give it up
And sometimes
To give sometimes is to give it all

Well I've been testing my luck
And I'm grinding my cock
Just not giving a fuck
And I'm skimming through way too fast
Well I've been down like you
And I too feel blue
So nothing we could create together
Will ever last

Tell me what you think of that old man, show me your plan
Been through hell and back again

So just take what you can
While you're able
Not to give anything in return
Because to give it all is to give it up
And sometimes
To give sometimes is to give it all

And maybe you can shine
Only time will tell us what's the deal

In hindsight we never ask for more
There's always enough

So just take what you can
While you're able
Not to give anything in return
Because to give it all is to give it up
And sometimes
To give sometimes is to give it all
