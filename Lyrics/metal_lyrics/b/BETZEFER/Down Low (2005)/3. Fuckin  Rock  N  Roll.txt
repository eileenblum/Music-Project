The enchanting feel
Of everything sliced,
Anatomic waste,
Anything gazed upon

Will seek that part in me
That redifines,
When edge
And mainstream
Collide,
Bite on your tooth hard

You can't stop the belief
It's getting strong in many,
Can't kill the old riff
It tears you up inside,
You can't stop the collision
This is fucking rock n' roll
Come on

Old grinding axe
Opened my eyes,
All my demons let
Me have some damn good times,
It's free, hell yeha, it's true,
True to myself, sane beyond a clue -
So I'll brake it off to you

You can't stop the belief
It's getting strong in many,
Can't kill the old riff
It tears you up inside,
You can't stop the collision
This is fucking rock n' roll
Come on

I was away -
Forgive me earth,
It's been a while
Though I rather not say so
Those damn machines
(Squeezing those knobs)
Can not affect me
As long as I know who I am

You can't stop the belief
It's getting strong in many,
Can't kill the old riff
It tears you up inside,
You can't stop the collision
