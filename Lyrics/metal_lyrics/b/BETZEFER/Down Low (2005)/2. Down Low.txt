All problems consist
Of people caught in frames,
Freedom is enemy
To everyone of them
On legacy They'll spit
And all because of fear
Of proving to be no one
When no one else is near

But these marks on my skin I can't replace
And in turn, all will prove to help me last
Yeha these things just don't let me ever die
And if I'm a bit over the edge
Please forgive me
I'm already gone away

What's behind your eyes
Is what you should all treasure
Shit you drink, crap you like
Don't make you fucking special
Whiskey's fucking scotch
And beer's fucking lager
And reign in blood is the best
Damn fucking album ever

Still you want to take a chance?
Well take a good look at the painful truth
A new kind designed to stay
Will always come around

But these marks on my skin I can't replace
And in turn, all will prove to help me last
Yeha these things just don't let me ever die
And if I'm a bit over the edge
Please forgive me
I'm already gone away
