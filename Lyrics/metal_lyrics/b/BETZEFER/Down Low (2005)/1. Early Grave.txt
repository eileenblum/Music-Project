I am
I am
Torment, bone and flesh I am
Breeding
Bleeding
For something I can't stand

And I change sometimes,
A few opinions
Anything that ever crossed my mind
And I'm thinking too much
And I can't take it

I sleep
I sleep
Almost every night I sleep
Breathing
Breathing
For something I won't stand

And I shed my skin,
A few incisions
Anything that ever crossed my mind
And I've been here too long
And I'm a kill, see?

Don't say nothing now
'Cuz I'd rather not know
If only days in which I suffer
Could be over than I would
Say nothing else
Even though I'm allowed
It all just tastes somewhat fucked up
And you fade away

Read it in the fucking book
I wrote it yesterday and used your sisters blood as ink
Spread it against all fucking tollerance
And I'm free now
Senile
By all torn-out means I vow
To bring the end
Bend as far as I can bend

And I shed my skin,
A few incisions
Anything that ever crossed my mind
And I've been here too long
And I'm a kill, see?

Don't say nothing now
'Cuz I'd rather not know
If only days in which I suffer
Could be over than I would

Say nothing else
Even though I'm allowed
It all just tastes somewhat fucked up
And you fade away

(As) In early days, when I thought
Skin could ever exist without cuts
And pain was nothing but a lure
Let me bite
Give me nothing in return,
In disgust,
It's marking me...

Dance on the youngs early grave
See the distant fallen light
For which I crave
Can not escape it...

(You can't stop this for happning
It's all shit
Let it split)
