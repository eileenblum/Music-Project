Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

In times of the new concrete
Both I n I pictue the end
All smoking on new found spliff's
Conceive from behind
In these times of conspiracy
We're all caught back to the wall
All lies and ignorance
Are soon to be gone
Rest assured now I won't give a shit about shit
Warp it up and go
Shove your speech into the new crack
Down below

We alone - forever we trust in the wound
True to ourselves
With no fucking tears left

Strapped, locked and fucked up bad
With general hate of the world
Not lost in your abyss
No longer compelled
And I'll burn your stupid flag any day
Took it of my back
What was once real to us was fragile
Let it crack

We alone - forever we trust in the wound
True to ourselves
With no fucking tears left

Shoulden't try a lot cuz I will remain
And you'll turn to be my gimp
It all just seems to take me higher
And what did it do for you?
Just say "What's done is done" and "Let it be"...

Alone - forever we trust in the wound
True to ourselves
With no fucking tears left
