What, what if this comes stressfully
Climb up some throats easing
Thoughs of falling on not so bright
Bones of inherited sons of light
What is this pain climbed fierce fully
Up your throat alienating
Those who relate not so tighty
To slaves to the stars
Where no one takes wives

Oh the eye will come out
When I push it in deep I always
Inhale and suffocate as it's cutting me open

Only in it for the poon...

I need xl fist to shove
Down your throat
I know you'll like it too
Cuz I fucked you
You know that I just can't be wrong
And all you know is delirious
Lets pierce this all at once
You all circle round
But no one sees why

Oh the eye will come out
When I push it in deep I always
Inhale and suffocate as it's cutting me open
And what if all three of them eyes
Come fold back again
They all sure as hell lightened no fucking pain
Let it be hereby
Acknowledged

Tell me what if these seizures told me to
React on ground level towaros you
And all my rage just can't be worong
What if it told me to slaughter
What if?
What if I fart like you when I talk?
I can't take it
To kill, cast asdie and dismiss is ok

Bend while you take it
Down, down, down...
Down, down, down...
Down, down, down...
Down, down, down...
