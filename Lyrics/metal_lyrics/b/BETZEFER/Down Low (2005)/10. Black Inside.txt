Agrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Today, I stood against all that I am
Tried to relive a moment from long ago
And I said "hey, we blend
And still everyone is unique as I".
Took off all costumes
I've Put on since I was born
And felt love
Spread though my body
Took my last breath - let there be no...

At last, took that last look at all I evet was
And suddenly all I saw was my mothers face
And I started thinking
Oh whether I did or didn't die
That all my life I've been living by foreign codes

(That's right)

Three whole weeks of night
Took all the joy from my home
Everything once so bright
No longer seemed to shine on
I cut it once and for all
Cuz it didn't seem to go there
God save me now,
I'm on my way to nowhere...

Traded all my innocence for black
And I can no wait till you turn away
You will turn and find me black inside
Hell I left to come back - still I will hand you my life today
You will turn and find me black inside
Inside...

Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeahhh ehhhhhhh
Let me turn a-wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy yeahhh yeahhhhhhh

Damn go with it!
Traded all my innocence for black
And I can no wait till you turn away
You will turn and find me black inside
Hell I left to come back - still I will hand you my life today
You will turn and find me black inside

Traded all my innocence for black
And I can no wait till you turn away
You will turn and find me black inside
Hell I left to come back - still I will hand you my life today
You will turn and find me black inside
In-side!
