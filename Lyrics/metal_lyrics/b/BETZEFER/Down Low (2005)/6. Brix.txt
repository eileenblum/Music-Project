Ayyyyahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

God sit me down on bricks
And watch me as I wait till never
Shed me into a recessing line
Of thought that you'll never get
Punish me with a life of tortue
In with I'll see forever
Let me show what went wrong
It won't take a long - you'd not regret
Then take a look into my eye

Cuz I can see the end from here
To where all lights are always flickering again
Where all people are insane

Where nothing dies
Well? I'm waiting...?

Will forever be for sale?
Show me how cuz I can't trick it away
Or pray with me while instead
Of skinning me cold
Cuz I cannot wait much longer
Until I let them all know that
You never lied

Lieddddddddddddddd

Where nothing died
When I met you
See, nothings gets to me really
Got shot direct tween the eyes
Feel not sorry for me
I really am worried about you

Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Bring it to me

Where nothing died
When I met you
