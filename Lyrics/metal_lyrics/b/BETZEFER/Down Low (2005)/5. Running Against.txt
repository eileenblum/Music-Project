I'm running against all odds
Trying to be something more
More then you'll ever be
You fucking poster take a look at me
And you'll see something undisguised
Something brutal, honest, no lies
Take a step back and realize
All this shit is pouring from your eyes.

Never wake up
Never walk
Never wake up
Just shut up damn stay close
Never wake up
Never walk
Never wake up
Just shut up and stay close

I'm running against the grain
Trying to do worst I can
But my worst is better then your best
You mother fucker can't you see I'm not impressed
By your music, lifestyle, your anything at all
You cant even take a fall,
Because you're weak, you're down and can't resist
The revolution's coming like a fist

Never wake up
Never walk
Never wake up
Just shut up damn stay close
Never wake up
Never walk
Never wake up
Just shut up and stay close

Yeahhh just shut the fuck up
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Arghhh never wake up
Never walk
Never wake up!
