This world, for me is such a lie
And I'll flee for it's too much
We consume, while taking shit as we spawn
We S P A W N

Pieces
Is what they cut me into
Pieces
They feed on these pieces
My generosity is peace-less
And nothing's left to do or say
But a due
To find a prey

Two years
Been running scared through my own dreams
Sip of this lost flood springs to my eye
Sip of this life pumps into my vein
Pushing me on
For this beauty means nothing
I can't help myself no more
For these two years
Are pushing me
Take your sit this is not so right
You can be alone
Need to redefine
Before...

Two years
Been running scared through my own dreams
Sip of this lost flood springs to my eye
Sip of this life pumps into my vein
Pushing me on
For this beauty means nothing
I can't help myself no more
For these two years
Are pushing me
