Render me nothing
Because I am nothing
There's nothing to see
And from what I once stood for
I will always be free
As the flesh that I devour
Is a part of me
And I am done

When the substance that flows
Through my veins is irrelevant
And the lie, it just sets me free
For the shit that you told me
Can no longer do for me
For you have what it takes
To get me paused for you
And a waste a part of my time
I am not what you thought of me
I am not what you foresaw
I am nothing you thought I could be
I am not what you can describe

Peelings of extra skin
Fall down and sometimes reduce to
The unlikely uses
Of puny excuses
That can't even fit for a day

When the substance that flows
Through your veins is irrelevant
And the lie, it just sets me free
For the shit that you told me
Can no longer do for me
For you have what it takes
To get me paused for you
And a waste a part of my time
I am not what you thought of me
I am not what you foresaw

I am nothing you thought I could be
I am not what you kill
I'm just wasting my time
Shit fucking lot's of it,
Wasting my time
Wasting a lot of it, yes I
Waited until now
I had to just 'cuz I already knew it's fucked
And I looked up, opened my eyes and staked my head
Against that pole
I
