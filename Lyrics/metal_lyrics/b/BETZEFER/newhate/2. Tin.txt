Walk on this world
And this shit will resolve in me
killing all people alike
and we'd cover ourselves with brains
with brains
it pains
the way I see it
and pure semetric demise
I will find
in your own edge
accompny me, my edge

Needless to say I was dead to begin with
I can't belive I'd be saved...
It takes needles &amp; needles &amp; nothing can't take that cold fear from my eyes...
I know I'm better off.

Want to be alarmed
at every time you take swing
at this colourful sin,
full of lies -
you will find
all this hate
to reside deep inside in my pride

Took so much - It's over
we can touch bases at last
I whitness all this shit from levetation
Damned fuckers crucify me
just for I fucking display all your other fucks invisible wounds?
FUCK!
look through my eyes &amp; I'll be
t! oo much for you to sieze &amp; you could die for a touch
and sub_sonic deafning noise will slice through your ears
and redeem what is mine
for this one time - I'd do it again, if I could
don't forget it is my type which keeps your kind sane
Could'nt shield my eyes from this shattering rain
&amp; now I don't feel awake while I'm running away from the pain...
&amp; now I can't sleep while I'm cleaning myself of the puss...
&amp; needless to say I was.
