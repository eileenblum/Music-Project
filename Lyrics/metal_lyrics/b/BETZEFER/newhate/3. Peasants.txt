As I already have you here you can
Never even try ant hide SHIT from me
Don't think of nothing you can't fucking see
Keep running
Dark
All over
Is everything that you're like
I'm erasing such severe demands
Give you directions, let you feed off me
Posses me now, it's all I really need
Cover me
Dark
All over
(With everything that you're like)
CUT 'cuz there's nothing to believe in
CUT 'cuz there's nothing to believe in
CUT 'cuz nothing really ever
Made no sense
It doesn't matter
CUT 'cuz you can't stop this SHIT from streaming
Now when it's all over you
Can you feel one fucking thing?
I know I can't so I keep cutting
(Can you even feel a thing,
just let me loose 'cause I keep wanting)
To take you as I am
Could it be my depression you are feeling?
...Guess who taught me how to bleed
SAY IT
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
FUCK me like that dirty whore I
Always tended to adore just
Pull my body through because I
Don't know if I ever wanted
To SEE it
To BE it leave me alone and you'll find ME
'cuz only you know when nothing left
So kill me,
FOR I HAVE ALREADY EVERYONE ELSE!
