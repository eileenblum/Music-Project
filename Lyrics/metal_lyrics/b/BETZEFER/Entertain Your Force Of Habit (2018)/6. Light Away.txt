Sucking up every lie that they feed you,
why don't you question it?
Swimming in pools of blood makes her feel safe,
so poetic that it's gotta be fake

And you chew on it, bite it, drink it all up,
don't you feel like a fool?
Lives are ruined, people are used,
just so you'll have something new to dispute

Light away, little girl, for us all,
lives are ruined for another crappy TV show

Artist, sociopath, murderer,
God help us all,
lies, some half-truths, just mix 'em together,
we're gonna have a ball

She took her own life just to fit your own narrative,
doesn't it make you sick?
It fits so fucking perfect,
so you had to institute it

And you shove it down, spray it, on everyone's face,
keep pardoning your "truth",
lives are ruined, people are used,
your ratings are through the roof

Light away, little girl, for us all,
lives are ruined for another crappy TV

Artist, sociopath, murderer,
God help us all,
lies, some half-truths, just mix 'em together,
we're gonna have a ball

Artist, sociopath, murderer,
God help us all,
lies, some half-truths, just mix 'em together,
we're gonna have a fucking ball

Dreaming of a true existence made of flesh and bone
with eyes wide shut that can see everything,
is it a confession or poetry?
Murderer!
