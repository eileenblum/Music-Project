We've been decaying for far too long,
holding on to something rotten, no value in it, nothing's wrong.
hold on, hold on, we're almost near the end
let's take a leap together, hand in hand

To Hell, no, we're not gonna take it
Choose a side, then weâre gonna break it,
When you feel your blood boils, hotter than hell, you know that it's time to tear it all fuckin down.
Tear it down

There's no time to reassess, we're bleeding out of control
Just turn it all the way up and let's bash our heads into the wall
Keep pressure, keep pressure, on the wounds
We're all out of hands, so let the blood flow as it should

Hell, no, we're not gonna take it
Choose a side, then were gonna break it,
When you feel your blood boils, hotter than hell, you know that it's time to tear it all fuckin down.
Tear it down, let's reclaim the crown.

March on. Join bravely. Let us to it pell mell
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
