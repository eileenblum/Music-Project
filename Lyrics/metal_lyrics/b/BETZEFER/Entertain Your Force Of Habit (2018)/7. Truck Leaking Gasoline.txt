Gimme, gimme, gimme all your needles and pins,
gimme your delusions, I will soak them in,
hydrofluoric acid in a barrel or two,
problems disappear and maybe you will too

Constant static noise in the land of freaks,
running around in circles trying to get their fix,
oh, what a scene,
run them all over with a truck leaking gasoline

It's a force to be reckoned with,
an asteroid spinning out of control,
comin' atcha supersonic speed,
just good ol' pissed off Rock 'n' Roll

Grab your torches, set Heaven in flames,
there will be no rest in peace, we'll die for fame,
spiraling down to the end of the line,
let's enjoy the ride and have some blood red wine

What a scene,
run them all over with a truck leaking gasoline

It's a force to be reckoned with,
an asteroid spinning out of control,
comin' atcha supersonic speed,
just good ol' pissed off Rock 'n' Roll

Set 'em all on fire,
watch them burn
into a flaming mess

Mess, on the pyre
Rock 'n' Roll!
