Making me
Pretend to no end, it looks as if the fog I walk in
Is gonna stay with me. I fear that I'm alone
My mind is bent. Passively I wait for death to grab me
Takes all my strength away. Taking over me

Fall. Far. This hole is way to dark
Never been allowed. Drowned. Take me the hell out of here
Never been awake

God damn. I'ts weird. A walking corpse I feed
A looming, consuming, bag of flesh and bones
The light is bright, and yet my lenses have cut it out
For everyting I know escapes reality

Fall. Far. This hole is way to dark
Never been allowed. Drowned. Take me out of here
Never been awake

Please tell me, tell me now
Is this all there is to me?
Confusion
Regret and utter stupidity
Conciousness is teasing me
So closely walking next to me
Was I ever alive?
