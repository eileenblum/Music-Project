I did it for the honeys,
I did it for the fame,
I never cared for money, why am I still complaining again? I'm sick of this

Why am I always running?
Life seems to stay the same,
I find it kinda funny, dragging the mud all over again

It matters to me,
if only for a drink,
a revolution, dying man,
dying

I hope this lasts forever,
don't wake me up again,
the dream is so much better then reality smashing again

I only wanted money,
I've always wanted fame,
just the approval of strangers, I am my own man

It matters to me,
if only for a drink,
a revolution, dying man,
dying man

Just give me all your honeys
and give me money too,
this fame is overrated, I'll live in a hole, consist on a soul

It matters to me,
if only for a drink,
a revolution,
a revolution,
a revolution,
revolution

Dying man,
dying man

Yeah

Doesn't matter anymore,
already drunk and dead,
I feel rejuvenated,
it doesn't feel like the end

Dying
