Felt all your pain and I'm
feeling all the strain and now I'm
fucking with your mind merging with my
own mind

I never saw how beautiful it all seemed,
stab me and throw me aside,
all of me

Yeah, I'm a bit obsessed,
you know I've been depressed,
you've put my strength to the test

Oh but it's too obscene,
to be my dream, I can't handle it

Crash into lead,
I know it's got to be me

I've been misled,
I know it's got to be me and me only

Fell forced awake and I've been upstairs,
looked down all day and now I'm three, four doses in and it's
oh, so much more than what I bargained for,
in the beginning of this show, my killer, so close

I'm just a bit obsessed,
you know that I'm depressed,
how long you think it'll last?

Oh, but it's too obscene,
to be my dream, I can't handle it

Crash into lead,
I know it's got to be me

I've been misled,
I know it's got to be me, it's got to be me

I've lost the way and now I
know I lost my way and now I
feel I lost our way, yeah I fail

I was so obsessed,
clinically depressed,
it all went so fast,
it was my dream,
it's now obscene,
couldn't handle it
