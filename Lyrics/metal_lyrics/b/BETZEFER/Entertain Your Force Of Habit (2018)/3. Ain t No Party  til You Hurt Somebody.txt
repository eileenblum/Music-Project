Well listen up kids, I won't say it twice,
sit down, look up and listen to my advice,
from the beginning of time to the end of this world
the same law rules above us all

I know it's easy but it never gets old, yeah,
that's the way to make Rock 'n' Roll,
I'll leave you to it, it's the best I can do,
there is not much to do for you

Entwined soft mind,
pathetic and weak,
a prophetical lie,
what of this is me?
What of me is all this?

In the end of the day what I'm trying to say,
let go, let's go, keep on turning away,
push it down deep in your soul,
raise your hands and make the call

Ain't no party 'til you hurt somebody!

Entwined soft mind,
pathetic and weak,
a prophetical lie,
what of this is me?
What of me is all this?

In black ash we dance away,
sum of all our twisted ways,
drink up, you have much to do,
in black ash we dance away,
away, away
