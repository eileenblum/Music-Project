Watch what you're sayin',
the walls will crawl into your mouth,
a twisted tongue speaks to the dead,
no longer playin',
this cross is far too much to bear,
I've become the liar

Fold, maintain your imperfections,
play, oppress, obey,
just leave something

One way to no way,
all ways, they lead us one end,
so climb aboard this humble train of pain and self-destruction,
I won't believe it,
it's only resting, never dies,
I have become the liar

Fold,
maintain,
oblige

Play,
oppress,
obey

Fold, maintain your imperfections,
play, oppress, obey,
just leave something

I'll die; I've got to have it, right now,
entertain my force of habit, now

Fold, maintain your imperfections,
play
