Three hours, all it takes, three whole years of mistakes,
looking back, this life was not much, only gives no takes,
the shadows that are hanging over a disappointed face,
break the cover of a live disgrace

Hell bent, I'm dancing with the Devil,
tough break, you'll find me six feet under,
black snake has coiled tight around me,
this is the last song ever

A clock is ticking, overthinking seconds into years,
a broken mechanism, mental terrorism,
adrenaline has left the building many years ago,
in its place the drink of death will flow

Hell bent, I'm dancing with the Devil,
tough break, you'll find me six feet under,
black snake has coiled tight around me,
this is the last song ever

This is my testament,
this is my monument,
the last breath I'll ever take
will speak out all of my mistakes

This island is dangerous,
the water is burning red,
when I'll feel the ocean breeze,
I'll drop thirty-six degrees

This is my testament,
this is my monument,
the last breath I'll ever take
will speak out all of my mistakes

This is my testament,
this is my monument

This is my testament,
this is my monument

This is my testament,
this is my monument

This is my testament,
this is my monument

This is my testament,
this is my monument

This is my testament,
this is my monument
