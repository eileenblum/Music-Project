There's no way around it,
keep playing the game
of working hard, doing drugs every weekend,
doesn't it all feel quite the same?

There's no question about it,
I know you feel it too,
take your money and your deadlines
back to when we had fun in two thousand two

A blank sheet of paper makes you high,
add some substance to it, then you fly,
there's no reason to it 'till you die

Put your lines in order,
rock 'n roll your notes,
keep fueling your force of habit,
just for the sake of your high hopes

You're starting to lose it
but in perfect control,
it's not about winning or losing
when it's not supposed to make sense at all

A blank sheet of paper makes you high,
add some substance to it, then you fly,
there's no reason to it 'till you die

Now it's time to wake up,
needle stuck in your heart,
pull it out, get over yourself and carry on
