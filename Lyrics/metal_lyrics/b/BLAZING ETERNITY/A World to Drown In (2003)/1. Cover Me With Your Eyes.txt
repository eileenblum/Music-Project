[Music: M. Lybecker/L. Korsholm - Words: P. Mesnickow]

Drifting away
In your now so seeking eyes
The taste of confidence
In my mouth
I want to give you
More than I can
Stuck in ourselves and the distance doesn't change

Words from you
Is a touching expression
Haunting
Bitterness
Is tearing me down
To be with you
Is to be with the world
Untitled reasons are carried with the wind

That autumn night we could have gone to the stars
But you leave me
With that stolen look of love
These days I hear our hearts beating as one
And you know for me
You will never be gone
