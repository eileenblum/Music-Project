[Music: M. Lybecker - Words: P. Mesnickow]

Trying to see but can't break through
Silver skies talks to me like ghosts of the past
Ignoring call from electric skies
And the house of cards
Fall to the ground death

Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still lost in the white lines
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors

A December could only apply to myself
Going to the lake of freedom but water is to cold to swim
I can go back but I can't move
Temptation can burn
But will I drown

Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
