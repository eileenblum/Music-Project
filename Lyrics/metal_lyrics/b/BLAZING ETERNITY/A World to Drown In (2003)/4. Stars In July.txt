[Music: M. Lybecker - Words: P. Mesnickow]

And so the day went
We had our time
Now we met at the park in July
I took your hand and held it high
I dreamt that this love
Could be undone

We shared our feelings
We had our moments
Maybe you were the one
No love can ever have a place in me
I'm closing in
On myself

Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate

And so the day went
We had our days
Now we were at the park in July
You took my heart and held it high
I thought that this love
Could now be done

And so the night went
The moon was full
Now we slept at the park in July
We took our lives and nailed them to the ground
I knew that this life
Could now be gone

Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate
