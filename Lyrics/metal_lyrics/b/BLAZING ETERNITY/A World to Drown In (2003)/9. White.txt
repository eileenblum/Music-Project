[Music: L. Korsholm - Words: P. Mesnickow]

And so may I be the next to know
Knowing the times before they are
Are they deep timeless wanderings and the mace of wrath
In these evenings
The blood seems to boil

Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white

I'm still the one I used to be
But the age of this fiery obsession has been too long
It's now colder than the freezing mind of you
Alive and glowing

Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white

Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
And heaven will know the taste of rain

Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
And heaven will know the taste of rain
