[Music: M. Lybecker/L. Korsholm - Words: P. Mesnickow]

Does love come wrapped in lies
Am I flying just to fall
And as I grow older
Life seems so much more colder
It's not a secret of mine
That I want love to really hurt me
Your bright smile at dusk
And all my love is blown to bits

Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you

Our words are so far apart
Mine broken, yours full of dreams
But let me find you in those dreams
And take you home tonight
Do you think the sky will ever part
And leave a tiny hope of love
For us to hold on
But to what, why or who

Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you
