[Music: M. Lybecker - Words: P. Mesnickow]

Serenity
And the ice cold feeling
Of an uncertain future
Spark glow in the dark
Waiting for no one
At the halls of tomorrow
Surrender may I
But only if you beat me twice
(Beat me twice)
I can't see through
Your lies and your crying eyes
(your crying eyes)

So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die

Would you believe a word I'd say
If it was true
(if it was true)
Could you challenge your horizons
Into a voice of silence
(a voice of silence)
Wherever you may fall
I'm falling with you
(falling with you)
And whenever you may leave
I'm leaving with you
(leaving with you)

So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die
[x2]
