And even though the winds seems so everlasting cold 
The nights are yet even longer 
The creepy feeling of solitude burns my skin 
When the spring of another winter is facing me now 
So torn emotions did you dare to walk the path 
That never were crossed did you dare to question the light of a candle 
When the walls were watching I was alone without you 
Without without you 
Did you ever see the moon drifting away 
Only for you I can't hold time back (I wish that I could) 
I can't hold time back (I wish that I could) 
I can't hold time back and it's all gone now and forever 
You reach out for me but I can't stop the fall 
I can't hold back I'm falling deeper into the wide paths 
The wide paths of sorrow horizons are getting nearer 
And the room is moving I can't hold back 
I'm falling deeper into the wide paths 
The wide paths of sorrow stars falling from the sky 
So clear with icons of ebony skin slowly moves throughout the night 
With grief of centuries slowly dying 
Dying from myself (but still I can't see you) 
Addicted to you (but still I can't reach you)
Only sorrow reflects through time and you die 
Falling again the bitterness of winter leaves me dying here 
In grey oceans and I don't even know if I will find myself again.
