Slowly room turning grey feelings oflost 
Love seems to shatter the way 
The way to the heart seems so dim to me

Seeing her masquerade 
Feeling her empty face 
Breaking her circles twice 
But my words seems to rust 

Seeing her masquerade 
Feeling her emply face 
Breaking her circles twice 
But my words turns to dust 

Ways of losing hope 
Dark landscapes of the mind 
Together we can be 
But white lines seems to shadow 

Seeing her masquerade 
Feeling her emply face 
Breaking her circles twice 
But my words seems to rust 

Seeing her masquerade 
Feeling her empty face 
Breaking her circles twice 
But my words turns lo dust
