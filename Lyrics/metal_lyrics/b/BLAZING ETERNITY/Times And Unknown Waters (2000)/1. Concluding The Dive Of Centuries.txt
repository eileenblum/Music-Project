Whenever the words seems so hard to say 
Whenever we fall as stars through the sky 
Whenever you say that things will change 
I know it's nothing but a tower of lies

You and I took the dive of centuries 
You kissed me goodbye and I felt the world crack down 
Through the never-ending shores of our lives 
We both know that time is just a lie 
That time is just a lie 
Losing today I'm riding on the wings of destiny 
Forests of melancholy can't save me know 
I'm trapped along the walls of death and despair 
Losing myself time falls apart the world cracks down 

Over black moors we both have wandered but still I can't see you 
I'm weeping up the words of times and loss the journey is lost 
The times they are changing the world goodbye 
Over black moors we both have wandered but still I can't see you 

Whenever the words seems so easy to say 
Whenever we fall as stars through the night 
Whenever you say that things won't change 
I know it's nothing but a castle of lies
