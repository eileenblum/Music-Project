As being carried through the winds of disgust 
Your breath stroke me like the autumn sun silently 
Your life turns to dust and my soul withers without a hope 
Seeing you walk in the night underneath you hide from the trees 
In the shadow of your new born light 
Night without a sign 

Ved dette skafol i oprorets tid i delle sekund 
med nallen sa hvid ved bjerge ved sletter 
med sj?lenes bid da sorgen blev min banemand 

I gave you my life 
Gave you my life for blood 
I gave you my life 
Gave you my life for grief 

Still it's been so many nights ago 
You ripped my heart to pieces 
And the autumn water melted my soul 
To he one with night and one with you 
So many nights ago 
So many nights ago 
So many nights ago 
You stabbed my heart with the knife of sorrow 
Drowning myself in seasons of tragedy 
Falling further down the blood falls with tears from the heavens 
Falling further down at the edge of the bleak cold hills 
I cry falling further down loosing myself in the embrace of death 
Falling ever down 

Ved dette skafol i oprorets tid i detle sekund 
med natten sa hvid ved bjerge ved sletler 
med sj?lenes bid da sorgen blev min banemand 

Melancholy flows like wine in the river of hope 
In the autumn of eternity I gave her my word. 
And her body flew through trees that may whisper 
Melancholy flows like wine in the river of hope
