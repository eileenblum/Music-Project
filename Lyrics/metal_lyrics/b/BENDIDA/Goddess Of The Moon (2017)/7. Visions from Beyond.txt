When the winter sun goes down
Shedding last rays around
When all the lights are dying
Kissing the land goodbye

Then from the snowy heights
Of mountains and plains behind
A real magic will arise
Suffusing the crimson sky

Splendid is the light
Sparkling in the Night
Clouds down below
Paths to unknown

Mystic and divine
Flickering silver line
Cross snowy tops
Guiding the lost

Visions from beyond
From another world
Realms of crystal light
From the other side

Through ancient snowy woods
In one enchanted world
Hidden views never seen
A wonderful winter scene

Reflections of snow and ice
Illuminate the skies
Touching the inmost dream
With magic crystal beam

Here under the vault
Atop the world
Just take my hand
I will guide you and take you away
