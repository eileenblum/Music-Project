Snow and ice are freezing harder day and night
Dogs and wolves are howling at the northern light
Hoarfrost and mist fall brought by blizzard gale
The whirlwind's narrating its winter tale

Somewhere in the Arctic, in the Frigid Zone
There's a reign of snow white princess of the cold
She turns into white frost with her gelid eyes
Everyone who dares to come into her sight

Here comes my coldest day
With chill and snow
Blood freezes in my veins
I am a prince of cold

Tender lips are yearning to caress my face
She holds tight my body into ice embrace
Chilly air from her breath is blinding my eyes
And my heart's transmuted into piece of ice

White indolence is melting all my body senses
Ethereal silence is ringing in my head
How is lovely the world when I take last breath
She is kissing my soul with the kiss of death

Here comes my coldest day
With chill and snow
Blood freezes in my veins
I am a prince of cold
Here comes my time of fame
With freezing eyes
Blood runs cold in my veins
I am a Prince of Ice

Slow falls the snow
On through the night
A brave new world is born
From the other side

Shivering and trembling not with fear, nor cold
But anticipating here I belong
My soul will surrender to the whiteness of the land
I'll commend my spirit into wintry hands

She is looking distant, gazing at the wold
Love so purifying and desire â cold
She endows my mind with endless sacred vision
Charming is the pale veil of oblivion

Here comes my coldest day
With chill and snow
Blood freezes in my veins
I am a prince of cold

Here comes my time of fame
With freezing eyes
Blood runs cold in my veins
I am a Prince of Ice

Slow falls the snow
On through the night
A brave new world is born
From the other side

Here comes my coldest day
With freezing eyes
Blood freezes my veins
I am a Prince of Ice
