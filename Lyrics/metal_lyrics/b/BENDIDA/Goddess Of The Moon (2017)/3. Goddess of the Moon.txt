In the ancient land of Thrace
Goddess Bendis was born
Atop the sacred mountain
At the hill Perperikon

She is rising with the Moon
In the night from the east
She is huntress and archer
Ruling over men and beasts

She is the Goddess of the Moon
And the keeper of the nature
She is bearing the sacred flame
And the spark of the creation

In the deepest forest
Of the ancient Thrace
She is roaming and wandering
Through a mystic space

So divine and august
Goddess of the Moon
Dazzling with her beauty
Running with the wolves

Keep the sacred mountain
From the cruel raids
Chase the false infidels
Free the holy lands

At the top of Belintash
The Sabazios rocks
The Moon light shadows dance with her
Under mystic midnight stars

Feel the wind of Tatul
Sacred place of the Thrace
And hear the song of Orpheus
Over mountains and lakes

Wild goddess of the moon
Raise your spear in the air
And tame the beast with your smile
Dancing with your samoviles

She is revealing the secrets of life and death
And the wisdom of the nature
She is the Goddess of Moon
The keeper of sacred flame of the creation
