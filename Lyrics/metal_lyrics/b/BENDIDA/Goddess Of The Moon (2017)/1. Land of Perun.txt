Once I was there
Over snowy peaks and limpid lakes
In the secluded enchanted woods

Magic dwells there
Passed through the ages and eons
With the ancient runes carved on the stones

He was ruling here
Sitting on his mighty frozen throne
Beyond the limits of our mortal world

Clash of the gods
Unleash the great war in the sky
And the time of false prophets arrived

A mystic age, forgotten time
Clash of two worlds, end of the line

Raise and swing your hammers high
Scream and yell the battle cry
Shake the ground with heavy growl
Sons of Perun

Call to arms with swords in hand
Ready to regain the land
There still rides the unicorn
Land of Perun

Orbelus â the frozen dome
Mountain of the ancient ones
Lost forgotten hidden realm
Land of Perun

Everlasting ice and snow
Where the chilly wild wind blows
Standing in oblivion
Land of Perun

Once I was there
High above these splendid ancient lands
Over glaciers and snow covered dales

Flash in the sky
Hear the rising thunder from above
Distant echoes from other epoch
