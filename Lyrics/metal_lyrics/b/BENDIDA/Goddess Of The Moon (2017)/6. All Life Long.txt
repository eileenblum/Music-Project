Crashed are the altars, dead are all the gods
The prophecy is forgotten, the king is dethroned
The wisdom of old ages now is something wrong
But the bard's songs remain
Here forever All Life Long

Orcs and evil creatures plan their wicked deeds
Towers and castles from ivory they build
The elves were gone in long time, sailed to the light
But the bard's song's alive
Sounds on and on through the night

Thunder and lightning are shaking the land
Demons and dragons â raising their heads
The sound of metal is sharp like a knife
Harder and heavier goes through the night

Everything is changing, now darkness rules the world
The bard has sung for grandeur, for glory and love
For beauty of green valleys, where I belong
For all forgotten heroes
To bear 'em in mind for All Life Long

Crushed are the altars, dead are all the gods
Buried in the past are their broken skulls and bones
The bard's forever gone, but listen to his last song
That song will remain
Alive and lovely All Life Long
