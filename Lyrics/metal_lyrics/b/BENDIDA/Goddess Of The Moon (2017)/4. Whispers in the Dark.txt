Whispers in the Dark

They're coming from depths of the space
From the most awful nooks of the cosmos
Long before the birth of the human race
They build their houses deep in the oceans

Detestation in aliens mind
Beyond all the Human perception
Visions undisclosed for the eyes
And from the depths see Dagon arise

You can't escape from the rising horror
Creeping and freezing deep in your mind
Last thing you'll hear before being devoured
It's whispering voice in the night

Don't you look at the book of the names
Unspeakable words and forbidden stories
It's a horrible book for the laws of the dead
For still sleeping creatures, but slowly they're crawling

Detestation in aliens mind
Beyond all the Human perception
Visions undisclosed for the eyes
And from the depths see Dagon arise

You can't escape from the rising horror
Creeping and freezing deep in your mind
Last thing you'll hear before being devoured
It's whispering voice in the night

Swimming in the sea of madness
Falling horror from the stars
Now in your sleep
You can hear their whispers in the dark

Follow the Deep Ones in the ocean
Hear them singing in the night
Watch the Great Cthulhu is rising
At the end of time

Swimming in the sea of madness
(Whispers in the dark)
Falling horror from the stars
(Falling from the stars)
Now in your sleep
(At the end of time)
Cthulhu's rising 'til the end of time
(Whispers in the dark)
