Belial, hear my call
Rise in flames my demon lord
With halo of your magic force
It will be taken from the source

Witch, cast thy magic spell
Invoke me from the depths of Hell
Black shadows in the twilight hall
Possess my Demon Whore
I shall meet him in the twilight
I'll sow the fiery hole
With the seeds of the evil
For the breed of new world

For the fall of the heaven
And the rise of the damned
A new king of the mankind
Soon will enthrall the land

Snake fangs and raven eye
Dried wing of dragonfly
Infusion with a flesh and bone
The chosen one will be reborn

Rise, rise the spirit higher
Dance in trans around the fire
I will rise the dead back from their graves
The mankind will be enslaved

So it's written with ancient runes
In the book of the dead
For The Witch and the Devil
Soon they will get engaged

For the earth of the mortals
A new era arrives
And the day will becomes darker
Than the black of the night

EX NUNC AD AETERNUM NIGRA TRISTIS
ALAS FATA OPERIAS TERRAM

Come, come, high or low;
Find your way from below
In the name of the inverted cross
Father, son and unholy ghost

So it's written with ancient runes
In the book of the dead
For The Witch and the Devil
Soon they will get engaged

For the fall of the heaven
And the rise of the damned
A new king of the mankind
Soon will enthrall the land
Soon will enthrall the land
Soon will enthrall the land
Soon will enthrall the land
