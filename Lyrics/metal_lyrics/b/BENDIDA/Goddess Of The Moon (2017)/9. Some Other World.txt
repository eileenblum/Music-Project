See the falling stars in the space around
Catch the ray of starlight, a cosmic ray from distant sun
You know who I am, I know who you are
You whisper my name, the way is close but yet so far

Follow me, take my hand and hold me tight
You'll find the world from the other sideâ¦beyond

Some Other World with charming light
No pain and fear under clear sky
A magical world full of delight
Spread your wings and you will fly

Star gate waits for someone to find
A parallel universe beyond the borders of the mind
Fabulous land is calling back for you
A mystical planet where all of the dreams comes true
