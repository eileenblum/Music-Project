Down in the depths across the death line
Weak is the spell, dark are the signs
Ghostly light shines through this sinister cave
At the end of the world the souls are enslaved

Shadows and spirits come into sight
Screams in the air from the other side
Enter the place where the whole evil dwells
To face the one who's reigning in hell

He shall ascent to the throne and the might,
Who has crossed the dark land alive
And come to The Farthest Shore of the day
Passed through the heart of the Realm of Death

I forgot the meaning of the words
I forgot all the names
I feel so lost in this dark world
Where the fire burns with cold flames

I forgot the wisdom of the words
I forgot all the names
I'm in a hole between the two worlds
Where the fire burns with cold flames

Crawling through Earth and Sea the darkness is closing in

In ancient time Dragons are spreading their wings
Flying to the Sun so wild and free
Now between the worlds through the half open gate
Creatures are bringing terror and hate

The mighty dragons are dying in vain
The Magic gets weaker losing its strength
Now is the time for what's told by the dreams
He's back from the dead and he will be king

I forgot the meaning of the words
I forgot all the names
I feel so lost in this dark world
Where the fire burns with cold flames

I forgot the wisdom of the words
I forgot all the names
I'm in a hole between the two worlds
Where the fire burns with cold flames

Crawling through Earth and Sea the darkness is closing in

Sail away to the end of the world
Across the raging sea, to The Farthest Shore
Bright the Hawk's flight on the empty sky
Across the Earth and Sea beyond The Farthest Shore

Out from the depths across the life's line
In flight with dragons through the blue sky
Only in silence we hear the sound
Only in darkness light can be found

He shall ascent to the throne and the might,
Who has crossed the dark land alive
And come to The Farthest Shore of the day
Passed through the heart of the realm of death

I forgot the meaning of the words
I forgot all the names
I feel so lost in this dark world
Where the fire burns with cold flames

I forgot the wisdom of the words
I forgot all the names
I'm in a hole between the two worlds
Where the fire burns with cold flames

Crawling through Earth and Sea the darkness is closing in
