Poverty, and violent crime are only words to our leader,
What does he know about where were from and the challenges which face us and were powerless to change
The things that need to be changed we are all living in a country run by power hungry freaks were powerless to change.
We have the world at our feet but were held back by rich manâs politics the only life which we know is a life of crime
In an ideal world equality would set us free but for now we are bound by social classes
This city could be great if you let it positive impact starts with the people.

MAKING A CHANGE no turning back the damage is done
Improve our chances of a better life by making a change
Your selfish actions are destroying our future take action now or things will only get worse
And time is not a healer without action things will only get worse
