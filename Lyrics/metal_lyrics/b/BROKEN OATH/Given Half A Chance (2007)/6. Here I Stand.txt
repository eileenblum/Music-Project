Here I stand honestly with my head in my hands and my heart on my sleeve
Redemption never did me any good kept my voice held low like every good kid should
But I'm still here as a constant reminder of the things you once longed to be

I know you so well you'll never change still using people for your own gain
I don't hate you but I've got nothing to prove all I have is a lack of respect for you
You are your problem you just cant see always blaming others only you can set you free.

Close you eyes but it wont go away realisation is your only chance to see you've got to change
Playing games is not for me you are everything you said you wouldn't be
