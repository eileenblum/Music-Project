A scene built on unity best known for friendships
These are meant to be the best days of our lives friendships built on false pretences
Has left me questioning how hardcore are you
To all my real friends we will always stay true regardless of music or fashion or dance moves
You were there in my time of need and I will be there for you

When did I lose the point of this show since when was there a point to prove
I wish things were different but I don't need to name drop and I don't need you.
To all my real friends, we will always stay true
You were there in my time of need, and I will be there for you

Maybe I am part to blame but it takes two
Why should I justify myself when you have got nothing to contribute
I don't need to name drop, I don't need you
To all my real friends we will always stay true regardless of music or fashion or dance moves
You were there in my time of need and I will be there for you
To all my real friends, we will always stay true
You were there in my time of need, and I will be there for you
