I can see the games you are playing the truth behind the lies
Everybody's got to watch their backs you wont stop until you get what you want
Walk over everyone in your path you'll get what's coming to you you'll get what's coming to you
Actions shame you I got your cards marked your actions shame you
It is not the first time we have been here before don't look at me.
Go your own way, choose your lifestyle and stay true don't look at me.
Be yourself because you are going to change what will you do when your lies fail you

Preach your straight edge some where else it is all a front for kids who don't know better
Preach your straight edge some where else it is all a front for kids who don't know better
Turn your life around stop lying to yourself don't tell me how to live you're a walking contradiction
