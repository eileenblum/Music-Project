Who the hell are you I've never seen your face before
Opinions spitting out your mouth who made you the law
If like me they only knew what a lying fake you were
The respect you got was premature you brought it on yourself
You brought the shame upon yourself
Your cause doesn't need you your efforts are an insult to them
Your life's a lie there's no denying and a failure is all you will ever be

You should give up if your heart is not in it there is no shame in living your life
Honesty will gain you more respect instead of living off scene points from a lie
Your cause doesn't need you your efforts are an insult to them
Your life's a lie there's no denying and a failure is all you will ever be

You owe them nothing there's no honour in a pack of lies and your time is up
Time will reveal you your lies I have no sympathy for you.
Your cause doesn't need you a failures all you'll be 
Your cause doesn't need you your efforts are an insult to them
Your life's a lie there's no denying and a failure is all you will ever be
