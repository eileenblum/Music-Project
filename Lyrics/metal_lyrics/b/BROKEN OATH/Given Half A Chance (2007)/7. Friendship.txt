Face up I wont play your games you betrayed my trust who is lying
There goes the knife into my back again deeper every time
To see two friends go head to head locked in battle it doesn't mean I'm going to choose a side
And your friendship means the world to me the flaws, unspoken
I will be honest until the day I die some things never change
You shall be heard make no mistake but I make my choices on my own alone I stand.

I am here for you you know it but its easier to be alone than play games most times it is me
Being played like a fool I will only take so much and then it is over
It is then you realise what you lost I survived before you were here I will get by when you are gone
