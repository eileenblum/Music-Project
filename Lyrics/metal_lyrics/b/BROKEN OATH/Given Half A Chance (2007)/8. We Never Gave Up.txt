Where is your passion that at one time burned so brightly
So furious in your heart outspoken fought for all the things
You cared about I though we'd last the pace together couldn't tear us apart
But the fire faded, died as you turned your back
On everyone on everything you once held dear on everyone on everything

Are all those words just lies now we trusted and now you're gone
Did you ever mean a thing that you said did you ever really believe
That we could change this world the way it thinks the way it acts
If you choose to walk away now your efforts were pointless were all for nothing
On everyone on everything you once held dear on everyone on everything

WHEN DID YOU STOP AND GIVE UP WHEN DID YOU STOP CARING
WE NEVER STOPPED AND GAVE UP WE NEVER STOPPED CARING.
