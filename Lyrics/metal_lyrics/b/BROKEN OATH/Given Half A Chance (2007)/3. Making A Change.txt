No turning back the damage is done
Improve our chances of a better life by making a change
Your selfish actions are destroying our future take action now or things will only get worse
And time is not a healer without action things will only get worse

Global warming must be prevented we must make some lifestyle changes
And time is not a healer without action things will only get worse
Make a change for our children, their future
Make a change turn this world into a better place
