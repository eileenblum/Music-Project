Two years on,
Nothing has changed.
Was anyone listening?
Did anyone really care?
The same old stories,
The same old lies,
The political race.
Blood
Cleanse the streets,
Your work here is done,
Until you're thirsty for more.
Is religion the biggest cause of war?
Would any real God let the killing spree take place?
Can we really change Then we must start on our doorsteps first.
