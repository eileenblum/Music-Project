One chance to make a change,
One chance to take back those things you said,
Now we must suffer.
Lost out to stubbornness again,
Please realise these feelings never end,
Break the cycle,
Stop fighting,
Stop talking,
Make a positive change.
Should never have left it to you,
This is not my way.
Stop fighting,
Stop talking,
Make a positive change.
