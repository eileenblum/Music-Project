Violence has ended,
Now the truth unfolds,
Was it everything you thought it would be?
Left feeling cheated once again,
Helped create a new fear.
Are you getting what you wanted,
Was the message all you came for?
My message could not be clearer.
We will not welcome you.
We will not welcome your lies.
Gunfire marks the start of something new,
A new kind of fear,
Left on their own now to rot,
Fear of their country,
Fear of their government,
A future unclear.
War masked the lies they didn't want you to see whose burden did you ease?
