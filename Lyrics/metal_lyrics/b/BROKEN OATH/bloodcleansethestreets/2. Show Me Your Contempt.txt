Switch on,
Tune out into this non-reality,
Act like you've got a brain, I'm sure you do but can you use it?
You choose to hide behind the comfort of your username,
But face to face your story's changed,
And everything's fine.
Accept the fact that times have changed,
Not everyone thinks the same as you do,
Just because it's your opinion doesn't make it right,
Diversity could be good for you if you let it.
Ignorance doesn't solve the problem,
Offer a solution.
Show me your contempt, I'll throw it back in your face.
