We don't claim to know it all,
That's what  brought us here.
We don't judge you for who you want to be.
Always think you know right but when it's not going your way, you turn your back on the "scene"
You started this fight,
Let's end it right here.
We will have our say.
We will be here to stay,
We here made out mark,
This legacy stays.
