Helpless gnawing at your insides, I'm powerless.
I'm sorry I can't help you cope.
Your strength and courage are an inspiration.
In the face if adversity you stand strong.
I can't stand to see you suffer in silence,
Can't watch as you slowly slip away.
I barely recognise your vision before me,
A frail silhouette of what used to be.
In the face of adversity, I wait slowly at your side,
So make this suffering end.
