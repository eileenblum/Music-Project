No turning back,
No regrets.
This friendship's over,
Never meant that much anyway.
You brought this on by yourself.
No-one else to blame,
Now we won't stand for your stupid games.
To all our friends that stayed true...
Open hearts and open minds is what set you apart,
But they'd rather judge you.
We built this scene out of nothing and we're still growing.
We won't stand back and watch you ruin it all.
Still seeking answers to what went wrong,
Always looking in the wrong place.
We're here to stay.
