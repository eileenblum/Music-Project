Turn the knob to reveal the light
Stare across the empty night

Dark worlds engrossing ... our sun is sleeping
The dance has lost its step
The teeth will be shown no more
Alone we find the escape
(We walk and walk and walk)
Alone we risk it all

Turn the knob to reveal the light
Stare across the empty night

The world has lost
Our minds roam free
