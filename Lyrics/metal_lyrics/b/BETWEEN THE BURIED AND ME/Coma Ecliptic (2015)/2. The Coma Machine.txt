You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
Lift our limbs to focus
We soon drift through the night

The getaway ... we drought the cloud of life
A quick escape to velvet

Start to drift in slumber. Smoke fills the velvet room

No more options to cope. A glimpse of the hanging rope.
Madness embrace the vault. Cannot wait any longer.
A string of light blink ... mesmerize my senses
A pulse that keeps me together for one last time
No more options to cope. A glimpse of the hanging rope.
Madness embrace the vault. Cannot wait any longer.
A string of light blink ... mesmerize my senses
A pulse that keeps me together for one last time

Lift our limbs to focus
We soon drift through the night
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there

Travel through a string of tears
Screams crash down like waves
Flushing my mind of a new world
(Afraid to open my eyes)
Climb the hill of the wrist ... enter oblivion
Oblivion

Foreshadow the Shadow:
My last exhale...
Knees crash down on...

Now rewind

You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there
You teach us what was
You teach us what was out there

What once was...
