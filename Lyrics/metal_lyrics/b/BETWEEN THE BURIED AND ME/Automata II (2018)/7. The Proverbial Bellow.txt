[Night six]

Let's stay here forever
I am I ... what is this?
I am I ... what is this?
A God-like floating sensation
Hands cover me
Jolting ... erupting
Sensory bliss
I am I ... what is this?
I am I ... what is this?

The mark is spotted
They have found me
Electricity screams through the fingers below

I am I ... what is this?

Move me to the ambulance of thought
Tiny electric movements

Please pick up the phone ... it's been ringing for years now
I'm so alone here
Sensory bliss

I'm now elevated
Yellow eyes stare below me
You/him/us: multiple versions of my inner search

The church of regret emits welcoming ... please don't shut us out
The red glow creates shadows ... mountains
Shadows of our choosing
Lights in their eyes start flickering ... the proverbial bellow

Let's stay here forever

Beautiful eruption ... we've made our creation
Sunshine beams on their faces ... as they melt into one
The slight hum of the grid

Please pick up the phone ... it's been ringing for years now
I'm so alone here
Sensory bliss
