Come a little closer now ... let me tell you what you need
A snake-tongued devil by your side

I will creep right through your mind and swim right through your veins...
Let your blood flow over me

I want to dine in your mind
Trust me ... we'll take it from here

Let's all hold these dreams in our broken hands of filth
Replace ... begin ... forget it all
Shut it off ... now ... all of it
I'll make you understand that they are really here and gone

I want to dine in your mind

Collapse on you
The inner rot
We are the Voice of Trespass

Voice of Trespass

We hang you out to dry...
Dollar signs in your eyes...
Crooked steps by design...
You're going somewhere fast...
It will never last...
Disembowel your formal aim...

I'll start slithering ... my pockets are getting big ... the dollars are in my eyes
The Voice of Trespass

We hang you out to dry...
Dollar signs in your eyes...
Crooked steps by design...
You're going somewhere fast...
It will never last...
Disembowel your formal aim...

The lizard tongue snaps at its prey
Clinking glass of celebration ... another puppet is lost in our world
Jolted out of reverie...
Break out ... break free
The lizard tongue snaps at its prey

This is not perfection
Find yourself...

Wake up
Please wake up

We are hollow
Condemned to the gallows
