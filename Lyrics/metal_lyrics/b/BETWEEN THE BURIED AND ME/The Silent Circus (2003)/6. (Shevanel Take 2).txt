My head will not rest on this pillow
As it's gripped in my arms tonight
Like reality, too tight
If a dream could last forever
I would hold you here
Time need not freeze, I need not fear
This world inside
Is a world I have longed to find

And I will not be afraid to love
I won't be afraid to lose
What I once deprived myself of

My tear drops have salt-stained this pillow
As its loosened from my weakened cluth
Like the sun's light: too much
But there's a hope today
That I'll find a way
To make my dream reality

Sometimes I run and sometimes I crawl
Sometimes I fly and sometimes I fall
But this dream of mine won't change at all
