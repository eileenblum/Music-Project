These hours seem like years...
I've been staring at this wall, wondering when it's going to take all of our lives.
I'm just glad we have jokes.
I think way too much back here.
My eyes are slowly closing; boredom is causing this loss of interest.
When will I awake? Asleep...
This party of four includes three grown adults and myself.
The first adult is very shy and wise enough to keep the second one from conversation.
(They're on a mission).
Gender is not recognized.
The third adult is a male and talks too much.
The stench of shit is in the air...
The room storms with laughter... fours turns into a hundred and the noise is unbearable.
"It's time, you are in hell, this place will kill itself soon!"
I cry, and the hands surround me.
Born into a hell...
I never wanted to wake to this.
I have experienced nothing, yet I feel I'm the only one who has not done harm.
If only I could understand how to change things...
I can't fucking think. The noise is unbearable.
THE noise STOPS.
