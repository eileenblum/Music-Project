[Day two]

This frame... it does nothing to soothe
Thoughts of worst-case seep through its fiber
This frame... ignites every step
Engulf the shadows it creates

Smash
Ignite
Destroy the creeping eyes
Hang the rope
Destroy this weakened frame

Two eyes lock onto my pulse
Love comes crashing on my conscience

Change my focus, lift my spirit... boy
Change my focus, you are my spirit... boy

The crimson moon shines down
Hold your tongue, let me speak
There's more to this than it may seem
