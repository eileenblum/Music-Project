[Night one]

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Goodnightâ¦

Gripping the brightest grid
A surgical drive to increase the noise
Ice cold realization of the silent wind slowly drags me up into a splintered reason
Emptiness engulf me

Align the love inside me
Let misery wake me

Search lowâ¦
Search lowâ¦ abandoned

The creaking floors cry out below
A limping glimpse of next steps
The fog showers the last light of day

[Voice of trespass:]
Destroy the wooden frame
Trust the creaking sounds
Seek the tunnel to walk high above
Search low
Trust the creaking sounds
Seek the tunnel to walk high above
Search low
Destroy the wooden frame
Confront the night

Warm blood drips on cold snow
The curtain surrounds logical thought

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned

Crimson moonbeam lights my journey
Crippled with time desperate strides into nothing
Crimson moonbeam lights my journey
Hear the waking
Crippled with time desperate strides into nothing
