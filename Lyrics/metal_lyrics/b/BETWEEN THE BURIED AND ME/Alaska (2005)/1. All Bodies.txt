We all create this imagery.
We all increase this lunacy.
We all create this imagery.
We all increase this lunacy.

Floating, melting...
Open sores for exploration...
Floating, melting...

Exploding worlds... surrounding imagination?
This will conclude our story... the first date of existence seems to be changing...

We are their property, we are their slaves... we surround all bodies... focus-time stands still.
We are their property, we are their slaves... we surround all bodies... focus-time stands still.

Keeper of the stars, I hope to never find..
We are just mortal souls left to die.

We all create this imagery.
We all increase this lunacy.
All bodies contortion
All bodies contortion

[The Discovery]

Ego controlled killing...
The tables have turned..
Obviously a poor creature of existence--
We die one by one.

We overlooked our control... fire swarming, engulfing, transforming...
Human restoration incomplete... the end.

[The Landing]

This beautiful scenario can't last forever... we must go see the conclusion...
This beautiful scenario can't last forever... we must go see the conclusion...

Starting a new species, classify nothing... life grows with trees on high...
Nature create this mechanical lust...
Nature form this force fed trust...
Cancellation...
Motivation... creativity--
Nature create this mechanical lust...
Nature form this force fed trust...
We will soon live in peace...
We will soon die in peace.
All bodies contortion
All bodies contortion
All bodies contortion
All bodies contortion

Keeper of the stars, I hope to never find...
We are just mortal souls left to die.
