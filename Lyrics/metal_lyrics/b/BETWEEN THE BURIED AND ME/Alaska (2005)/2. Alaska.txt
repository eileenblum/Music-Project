The road is dry... I'm fucking delirious right now...
Life goes on... glorious evening of nodding and jump starts...
I need to make a personal dance party.
The brain works very weird at this hour...
Not the best time for lyrics I suppose...

Keep writing... keep dreaming...
Keep writing... keep dreaming...
Keep writing... keep dreaming.

Nope, can't be awake and dream, drift in and out, in and out...
Nope, can't be awake and dream, drift in and out

Eye motions... in out... heat lightning,
Scares us both... the only two people awake at this fucking hour...
I won't remember this in the morning...
At least I wrote this all down... please pick the right song...
The one that keeps the eyes wide...
Creepy... creepy... creepy...
Yes, creepy...
The idea of control...
Controlling death with alertness...
When is the fucking sun coming up.
The idea of control...
Yes, creepy...
Controlling death with alertness...
Controlling death with alertness.

Then it all changes, same scenery but sun involved...
Shouldn't be much different...
Alaska, Alaska.
Then it all changes, same scenery but sun involved...
Shouldn't be much different...
Alaska, Alaska...
the brain works very weird at this hour...
The brain works very weird at this hour...
The brain works very weird at this hour.

Tick tock tick tock... the rain is pouring now...
Wide-awake... at least for now... nature can be the death of me...
A thing we'll never overcome... in out in out.

Nature can be the death of me...
A thing weâll never overcome...
Nature can be the death of me...
A thing weâll never overcome...
Nature can be the death of me...
A thing weâll never overcome...
