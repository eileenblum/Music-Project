Prescribe me: corrupt me...
Put your guns in my hands...
In the hands of the young...
Let's kill...
Let's die...
We're all equal tonight...

Prescribe me: I don't want to feel what is happening.
I don't want to know what I see, please don't let me cope alone, joystick revolution move me.
It's all a dream...
Redneck lord, you still soothe me...
Behind your black tie revolution, this is just a party...

Prescribe me: become the whore...
Please drug the young...
Follow the gods, for sex and greed bring the smiles...
The rich, sexy smiles that blow the minds of every goddamn male pig out there...
We all just want to fuck...
What is love, the idea of love...
Corpse play, traditional/marriage: we don't have to take this serious...
Have you seen the cities... have you seen the images...

We have to be you.

2005 welcome to perfection...
Prescribe me, indulge me...
You have won.
