Iâll sleep now.
My teeth taste funny today...they seem more jagged than normal.
Iâve been told, Iâve been told, Iâve been told that I have been grinding them like gears during my dream hours...
I wonder if itâs just my thoughts fusing into one frequent dream...
One which parts with the night, the night.
I saw them dragging the other day, other day.
Scraping their knees...
Seems the high horse is taking them all home...
I canât leave myself out.
Seems the high horse is taking them all home...
I canât leave myself out, self out.
Why should we sleep today...
Why should we awake tomorrow?
We can just pop back a few and drift through this pre-programmed flight.
We can just pop back a few and drift through this pre-programmed flight.
Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek...
Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek...
This seems to be what Iâve needed.
Across all oceans... a windy, noisy trek...
Across all oceans...a windy, noisy trek...
The view used to be better...lands are growing into one.
We wanted it this way.
We were brought up to grow into one.
We were brought up to grow into one.
Iâm going to fly up soon and seek other lands.
The soothing air of flight...
A birdâs eye view into what Iâve always imagined life could be.
Will it be sought after?
It might just be useless writing and ideas that laziness will corrupt in the end.
Bones of dust need hardening.
I think the prescription.
I think the prescription is found.
Sleep on...
Sleep on... fly on.
In your mind, you can fly.
Sleep on...
Sleep on... fly on.
In your mind, you can fly.
Sleep on...
Sleep on... fly on.
In your mind, you can fly.
Sleep on...
Sleep on...fly on.
In your mind, you can fly.

My teeth grin oddly today...
They seem to gleam more than normal.
Maybe it will be noticed.
Walking dead.
Walking dead.
