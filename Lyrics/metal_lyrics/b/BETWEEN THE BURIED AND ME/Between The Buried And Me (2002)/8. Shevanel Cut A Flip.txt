Dream of me... we can live how we want now... this world
has no boundaries. We shall never wake up. Let's kill
them all, let's torch the world. This is for us. Let's
meet them for the first time... this isn't awkward, is
it? It can't be... there are no worries... all we have to
do is cut the switch... wake the fuck up... this is all
I've ever dreamed...

this dream is all I've ever wanted,
cared for, I only hope things haven't changed when I
awake... life doesn't work like this... once a night my
life is "yours to create"... mold me and make me the
child of the night, with all the ambition in the
world...

my hate and worries cease to be... my fucked up
little head controls me... "dream is destiny"... wake the
fuck up...

I kill, I love, I end nightmares, I begin
romances, I travel through sexual situations, I only
hope to never wake... I only hope, cause the exterior
world is not making sense anymore... I tend to get
scared... wake the fuck up... no... "Whatever you do, don't
be bored. This is absolutely the most exciting time we
could have possibly hoped to be alive. And things are
just starting"... make this dream reality... love you...

"And if the world that we're forced to see, if it's false - and nothing is true, then make this dream real!"

"And if the world that we're forced (forced to see) if it's - if it's false, and nothing is true (nothing is true!) then make (stop holding) we'll make this dream, we'll make it real!"
