[Lyrics by Thomas Giles Rogers]

The inner thrust jolts the body into this colony.
Invention upon invention, swaying to the movement of our ticking grip. This lunacy tagged our storyâ¦ a dreadful play entangled in our deepest fears.
To watch it play out amongst our darkest ideas. Every time.
"Never stops," he saysâ¦ Never will he stop.

Upright position and ready for this sense of reality to melt.
Distrust reality into a gleaming sphere of pointless thought.
Melt/Meld/Melt
Thoughts chill to the core.

To watch it all unfold.
Driving force within can claim all of us again.
To watch it all unfold.
The speech upon the night claims everything in sight.
Grin awayâ¦

Our crops watch below as we float by with a gas-like stench.
Asleep in their beds while our bodies contort around our pointless possessions.
They didn't save us.

We put our trust and comfort into this lonely state of greed. Alone.
Alone with them allâ¦ the scarecrows overhead.
Keeping watch as our spines dance down on the sleeping slogans. Stay intrigued.
Crush this concept, create the maze.
Eyes upon Is
Eyes upon Is
Eyes upon Is

Upright position and ready for this sense of reality.
Melt. Meld
Distrust realityâ¦ refuse reality
