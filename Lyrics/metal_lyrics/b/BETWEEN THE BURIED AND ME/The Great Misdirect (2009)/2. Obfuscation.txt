From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem.
An entire existence revolving around what we canât acknowledge.
From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem, as they seem.
A brain malfunction weâll never admit as defeat, defeat...
A constant determination to find truths, to find truthsâ¦ to find reason...
To find reason... to find truths... to find comfort.
An unspoken religion in being the all dominant, all dominant, all dominant...
This is what we call a brain.
This is what we call a brain.
This is what we call a brain.
This is what we call a brain... a brain.
This step will allow, allow the universe to run its course.
We have a short ticket and a lot is in hiding... so letâs take in what we can for now.
Just like here on Earth, a notion we do comprehend.
Hide what âothersâ canât understand.
The universe is the biggest, biggest threat... overachiever that commands attention.
Brute force of hysterical, hysterical reasonings...
There will always be a Marfa.
Close one eye.
Step to the side.
Close one eye.
Step to the side.
As humans, we could never be content with knowing all.
Yet we canât be content with the fact that our brains will never know.
A mental surgery... a never-ending journey... a technological drawback.
Pushing us further from our natural minds.
There will always exist a Kryptos.
Even things created by other humans should be considered.
In the experiment of an entire species of understanding.
A magicianâs pure joy...
A mind bend for the common folk...
Follow the straight line...
A full house watching what we canât see.
The ultimate deceiver...
Close one eye.
Step to the side.
Step to the side.
We will always be part of the great misdirect... stepping in and stepping out.
We will always be part of the great misdirect... mirrors and Obfuscation.
