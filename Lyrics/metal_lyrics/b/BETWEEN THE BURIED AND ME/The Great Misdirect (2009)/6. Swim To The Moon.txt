Itâs been a long night... away from it all.
The grabbing authority of my peers...
The rusty cage that never seems to open...
When can I escape?
When can I swim to the moon?
Iâve heard this expression my entire life... never realized how peaceful a statement it is.
Iâve heard this expression my entire life... never realized how peaceful a statement it is.
All alone on the worlds waters... here I am.
The sunâs slowly drifting past the edge of the world...
All alone on the worlds waters... here I am.
The sunâs slowly drifting past the edge of the world...
Iâm the loneliest boat on this entire body of water.
Rest will give my awakening purpose... this is why I have come here in the first place.
A peace I have never felt... a life I did not want to live.
I will awake through sleep...
The drifting drifter... look into the picture...
No more panic, no more regret.
No more hoping for a new mess.
Slide into the water.
Become one with the sea.
Life seems so much smaller.

Swim to the moon.

I awake with a cool breeze blowing through my dirty hair.
Rested, stable... a first.
A caffeine junkieâs longest wish: peace and quiet...
No wake ups, no expectations...
A strange feeling... suddenly drifting...
No wake ups, no expectations...
A strange feeling... suddenly drifting...
This âAs Seen on TVâ anchor is just another lie, I guess... hoping for something not there.
Filling a void that I canât quite put my finger on.
Filling a void.
This loneliness I always seek.
Iâm in the middle of black water.
No sign of human life in any direction...
The most peaceful event of my life seems to have typically turned into a struggle.
Iâm in the middle of black water... no sign of human life.
Panic takes over my body.
Panic takes over my body, over my body.
I have indeed floated due to a non-reversible decision to flee.
Just for a day I told myself... my survival skills were lost years ago.
Here I am: no food, no clean water, and this extremely embarrassing attempt at a âget away outfitâ.
This is an inevitable death, inevitable death.
Slide into the water.
Become one with the sea.
Life seems so much smaller.
Swim to the moon.
Look into the picture...
Look into the picture...
Look into the picture...
Look into the picture...
This is what I lived to be.
This very moment is the first time in my life that Iâve felt pure joy.
Slide into the water.
Become one with the sea.
Life seems so much smaller.
Swim to the moon.
Slide into the water.
Become one with the sea.
Life seems so much smaller.
Swim to the moon.
Slide into the water.
Become one with the sea.
Life seems so much smaller.
Swim to the moon.
