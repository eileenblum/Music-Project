Don't think. Don't speak. I will do this for you.
Every natural thought or feeling you've ever had will change tonight.
Don't think. Don't speak. I will do this for you.
Trust the pedestal, for now we become a higher being.

I am your new mind.
I am your new you.
I am your new sin.
I am your new lust.
I am for you now.
Control... and collapse... collide.
Control... and collapse... collide.
Control... and collapse... collide.
Control... and collapse... collide.
A letter plagued by a twisted word.
Slave. You will become mine, for there are no more options.
There will not be a sweet consolation... this is what is supposed to happen.
A predetermined destiny put in motion by my stronger power, power.
You are me.

[Child:]
I sit on this dirty floor.
A weak mind for a cause.
A cause I do not know.
Don't know what to live for.
A compliment I've never heard.
A comfort I've never felt... it's here, even though it won't last for long.

[Man:]
Sit down.
Stand up please.
Lay down... drink this please.
You'll be in peace soon.
A tribe within itself...
A vision I will display... to blind the caring.
I have regrets.
A tribe within itself...
A vision I will display... to blind the caring.

Too late...

I am a cult by definition. I am a friend by first impression.
My task: to recycle this earth.
To not repeat human history...
Start from scratch... rid every sound.
Deconstruct...
Deconstruct...
Iâve bid every method into the hands of my employees.
I have saved you.
Now you will follow my journey... my destiny.
Tonightâs your death.
Resurrect my new you.
Resurrect my new you.
I am a cult by definition.
I will end this human world.
This world is shit and I have proved this with my followers.
Fuck humanity, end life.
You are now dead, and I soon will be.
You are now dead.
Disease, injury.
Disease, injury, madness.
