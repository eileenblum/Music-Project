Sweet candy populous... a worry free entrance into the worldâs history.
Never underestimate... never think beyond, beyond their thoughts.
The satellites have been tapped and Cloud Mountain will carry on the commands of our ancestors.
Indeed we work from here.
We have for centuries... hearing every breath... watching every disease.

Indeed we work from here.
We have for centuries... hearing every breath... watching every disease.
The leaders are driving to the farthest retreat.
Sit back, relax, enjoy the ride.
They have been speaking for years.
Every night while youâre asleep they have been discussing what the future holds for us all.
The outer space takeover.
The outer space takeover.
Worlds collide in a dreary pre-determined idea brought by our fellow night owls.
Their stories have been mocked... their ideas have been crushed...
But after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out.
Their ideas have been crushed...
But after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out.
A government overthrown...
But after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out.
We have come to tell you all that we could have prepared for this.
We have come to tell you all that we could have prepared for this.
We have come to tell you all that we could have prepared for this, for this.
The apocalypse, at least our apocalypse, will happen sooner than we think.
If we donât read the journals our station has prepared for you all.
We call ourselves the ânight owlsâ.
Weâve roamed the Earth for years and kept your world afloat.
Weâve made it so you stay comfortable in your precious homes.
While you sleep, we discuss.
Discuss our future... your future.
While you sleep, we discuss.
Discuss our future... your future.
Our journals give detailed instructions on the machines and weapons we must build.
These are weapons that none of you would even begin to think could harm the outside world...
Everything you know is false... your first instinct is now your last.
Like Iâve said before... we have been discussing and planning this for decades.
We donât have time to explain everything, but just know that everything will soon change, will soon change.
Trust us and we will all be safe.
We are the new government.
Trust us and we will all be safe.
We are the new government.
Trust us and we will all be safe.
We are the new government.
In simple times, we must take control.
With simple skies, we create... more sky.
A simple land we must change... for man... is god.
A simple life we must break... move on.
How fast we grow...
We must move on.
We must move on.
We must move on.
We must move on.
We must move on.
We must move on.
We must move on.
We must move on.
