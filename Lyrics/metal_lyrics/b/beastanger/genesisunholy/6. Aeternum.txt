Dominions of death 
Divine death  

Satanâs tyranny 
Luciferâs monarchy 
Belialâs dynasty 
Leviathanâs anarchy  

May our souls forever be 
Enwreathed by the blazing 
Fire of the abyss  

Our time has come 
Time of terror  

Hellish gatekeepers 
Beelzebuthâs gaze 
Asmodeusâs stare 
Perpetual darkness  

Per semper diabolicum 
Et baphomet imperium
