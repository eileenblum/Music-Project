A chant so powerful
Leading storms and fire  

Slay the limbs of the sacred ones 
Offering death by flames 
Assembling symbols of unholy fate 
Invoking six thrones of pagan hate  

Ritualistic black mass 
Presenting quakes and water  

Break the limbs of the sacred ones 
Offering death by floods 
Assembling symbols of unholy fate 
Invoking six thrones of pagan hate  

Asmodeus, Beelzebuth 
Unveil the path for darkness 
I conjure thee, come forth 
Six demons of destruction
