Gathered warlords of Hell 
The pentagramâs fulfilment 
Begin the cast of the spell 
To lay the curse upon them  

Apocalypse glance  

So demons possess humanity 
Visions of the end are drawing near 
Stigmas and dogmas are bleeding black 
The infernal rise, congregation of the dark  

The horizon brought the night 
The pagan moon conspired 
Hatred born agaisnt the light 
To the appearance of fire  

Apocalypse scent  

So demons possess humanity 
Visions of the end are drawing near 
Stigmas and dogmas are bleeding black 
The infernal rise, congregation of the dark  

Decades filled with terror 
A darkest sight, the new blazing era 
Holiness petrified
