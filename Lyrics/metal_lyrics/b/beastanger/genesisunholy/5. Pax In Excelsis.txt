Slay Gabriel for his words are denied 
And let the unspoken form a race 
The most beautiful angel agony amplified  

Court the nephilim to their rightful place 
Asmodeus, torture Raphael  

For his healing hands were severed 
Murder Tobias and rape Sarah 
Submit all your might into pleasure 

Pax in excelsis  

Dilacerate Uriel for his wrong answers 
And let the truth be heard 
In your dogmas I am the cancer  

Ripping the pages from your book of absurd 
Satan, eviscerate Michael  

For his blade has struck 
Crush his head on the last nightfall 
Avenge all the children he murdered 

Pax in Excelsis  

Satan, blazing hellfire 
Leviathan, serpent of water 
Ruler of the earth, Belial 
Master of the winds, Lucifer  

The rapture of angels in pain
