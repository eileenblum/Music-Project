I found a way out
From life in despair
I found a better day
But forgot how to find my way there

I sensed a morning
Not ravaged with fear
I felt a better place
And I knew that it couldn't be here

But I tell you that things
Will be better
Tell you that things will be fine

Would I make you
Believe if I told you so
Would I make you believe I said

Okay I was lying
Not telling the truth
I've seen no sight of day
And it's not like I've been in pursuit

I saw it on TV
Or read in a book
Thought I'd make you believe
Things are not half as bad
As they look

So I told you that things
Would be better
Told you that things would be fine
