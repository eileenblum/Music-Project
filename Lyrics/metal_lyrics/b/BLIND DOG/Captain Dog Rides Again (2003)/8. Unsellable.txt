Thought I could avoi temptation
Lying to myself again
Heading for disintegration
Seems like nothing more remains

I thought you wanted it this way
A time when everything's for sale
Go out and shop and you'll be saved
But nothing's worth a dime
I hope you're happier this way

Sold myself for liberation
Prostitute my mind again
Whoring for appreciation
Bend over and don't complain

[Chorus]

Nothing is sacred
Nothing to small
To weird or at all
Unsellable

[Chorus]

Guess I'll get back in line
Guess I have nothing more to say
Guess I'll just bide my time
Just hope I'm happier this way
