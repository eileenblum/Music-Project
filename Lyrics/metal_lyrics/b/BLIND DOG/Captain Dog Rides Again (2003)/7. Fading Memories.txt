Bloodstained visions
Cast a reflexion of the past
Fading memories
Under ones more built to last

Past days mischief
Left to dissolve on memory lane
History is founded
On the centuries of pain

Call on the misfits
To take the blame and
Set things wrong
A chance for the man
To stand up and show
The world we're strong

To keep united
We need something to be joined again
Fading memories
Didn't this happened ih the past

Under the lid this kettle's boiling
Under the rug this floor's unclean
Always someone
Whose plans need foiling
Making sure we control the means
