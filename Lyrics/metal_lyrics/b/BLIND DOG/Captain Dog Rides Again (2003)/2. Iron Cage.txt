If I told myself again
That I'm one of a kind
Would I have myself to blame
If I was told a lie
If I told myself again
Have I been told a lie?

If I stand here all alone
Would I be my own man
And be wholly in control
Of what is in fates hand

Could I make it on my own
If I was standing in the cold
If I was my own man

If I speak my peace today
Would I have nothing said
Maybe I would just repeat
That planted in my head

We might have a right to speak
But long since lost the right to have
Anything to say

We're marching towards
Demystified times
And thus closing in
On the polar night
We're loosing ourselves
In the iron cage
Who'll reside there next?
