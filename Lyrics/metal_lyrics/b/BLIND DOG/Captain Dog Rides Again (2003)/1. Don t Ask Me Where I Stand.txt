This is a war
Of the opinions
Battle to win before the fields
Enter our minds
Alter our egos
Telling the tale of wrong and right

Sitting beside
Watching the barricades
Seeing them leave it one by one
Crouching inside
Common opinion
Safer to play the sovereigns game

Don't ask me where I stand

Got to look good
Dressed in commercial
Don't want to fade into the crowd
Got to stand out
Being proverbial
Scent of the bad but still allowed

Got to make way
For modern Midas Touch
Making the world a giant mall
New world improved
Turn all to plastic
Waiting the last and final call

Don't ask me where I stand

There is a code
There's a convention
There is a list of things unsaid
Better be true
To the opinion
That has been planted in your head

I wanna know
Is this the modern day
Is this the way we had things planned
Is it the end
Or the beginning
About time to don't give a damn

Don't ask me where I stand
