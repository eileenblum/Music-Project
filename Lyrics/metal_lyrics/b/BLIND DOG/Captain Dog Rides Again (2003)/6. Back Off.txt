We won't give in
Till you surrender
Until you acknowledge
Our demands
Because you know
A human rights defender
Can not let mere
Numans spoil his plans

Back off

You cannot keep
The weapons we gave you
Don't worry there's
Plenty here with us
Off course we might just
Let you have a taste too
We will tell you when
You've had enough

Back off
