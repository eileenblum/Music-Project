Holy
- The only reason we will ever need sacred
- And that is why we're gonna bomb 'em to hell
Jesus
- The man provides us with an alibi
Stand up
- And only hope that you're he last one in line

There must be better ways of losing your mind

Showtime
- It's a rehearsal for the holoaust
Lean back
- It will be coming to you live on TV
Trendy
- And in the comfort of your very own home
Sold out
- Don't miss the broadcast of coming demise

There must be better ways of losing your mind

Nuke 'em
- We'll get the ones that chose to not agree
Good thing
- It's the oppressor that's defining the lies
This time
- The ending gonna be spectacular
This time
- We're making sure we're leaving no one behind

There must be better ways of losing your mind
