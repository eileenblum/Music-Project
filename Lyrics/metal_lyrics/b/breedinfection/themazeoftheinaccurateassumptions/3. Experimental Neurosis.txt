They say our transfer lasted lightyears
And if we don't remember anything
It's because of hypersleep
A wide spectrum of light

Dazzling radiation
A strange lab

With different human
Modern equipment

Unknown technology
The odour of rotten meat

Penetrates deeply into the brain
Ambiguous dimensions of phobia
They call us ALIEN
