Looking for energy resources
Towards the endless galaxies
Hypotheses of a few scientists
Inaccurate assumptions

From the unknown destination
Evolution of knowledge

For the survival of existence
Energy consuming to find it

Making effort towards failure 
Of which we are aware
Making effort towards a goal
That has never been existed

Low price for nothing
Gradual extinction of humanity

For the survival of existence
Energy consuming to find it
