Tall black walls
Just were watchers
Outer space debris
Just were covers
Cast away and captive
Inside twisted metals

Use of time to survive
Repeated cycle
Spend to time waste
Repeated cycle

This is infinity
This is unique dignity
To peace and eternity
Black sphere
To peace and eternity
Black vortex

You understand when reach its deep
You were feared when disappeared

Supermassive black hole
Gravity's relentless pull
It swallows all galaxies
To terminate essence of being
To terminate essence of being

For recasting calmness
Event horizon
Everlasting weakness
