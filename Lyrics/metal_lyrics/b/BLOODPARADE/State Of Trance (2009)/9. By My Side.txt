The cold is back
That far eternal grey
Those deep fears
Flow from my mind away

I go through the nights away
And dawns each fucking day
While the sun
The sun it fades away
Fades away!

Right now!
Everything should die
It's time!
Time to fucking rise
Wake up!
Walk with death by your side.

The wind dried
Those dark fucking tears
That I left behind in another life
That I saw die by my side
By my side!
