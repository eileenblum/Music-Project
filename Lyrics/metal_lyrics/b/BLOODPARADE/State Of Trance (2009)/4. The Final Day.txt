I know the walked path reached to an end
My cold heart agonizes in front of pain
Beg for mercy and wish you could escape
Beg for mercy

Now I see the truth
And I see that light
I see the days left behind
And I feel this truth
And I see that light
And I see my soul wave goodbye

There's nothing more to lose in this life
Only the intense and catchy silence, and
The void is immense and penetrating...
The void is immense and...

Now I see the truth
And I see that light
I see the days left behind
And I feel this truth
And I see that light
And I see my soul wave goodbye

Now I see the truth
And I see that light
I see the days left behind
And I feel this truth
And I see that light
And I see my soul wave goodbye
I see this truth... I see that light!
