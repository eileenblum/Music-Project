There is no revenge
That could wake me up from this nightmare
That attracts humanity

If you cannot see
What never existed
You will just recognize death
Faithful desire to take it away

There is no devastated end
That could stop, stop the impulse
To so much loneliness

Give up the run
You have no place to go
The end is coming
It doesn't depend on you

Where this hate grows, together
Where death is forever
Behind the smoke
Hiding remembrance
Where the hate lives
Only the blood that flows like water

There is no life anymore
No beatings to hear
There is no life anymore
Anymore...
