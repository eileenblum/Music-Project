If you only want
If you only want to forget
What has stunned and hurt your heart

If you only want
If you only want to prove
That you haven't lost,
just won,
that's your decision

Your try today is satisfaction

Now you can
Now you can look ahead,
there's nothing that
There's nothing that
Could stop you now

Your try today is satisfaction

You can ignore,
can ignore
You can ignore
And no restrain the evil action!

You could removed that deformity
In your mind
Which only hid the strength
Of your greatness

Now I know you're in the other side,
I tell you goodbye (bye bye)
In the other side!
I tell you goodbye (goodbye)

Now you can
Now you can look ahead,
there's nothing that
There's nothing that
Could stop you now

Your try today is satisfaction
