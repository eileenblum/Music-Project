I have reasons to be alone
Dying til I see clear
There's no revenge to explain
Will never come back

I perceived your look
My time is running out
I don't stop thinking
I relax my tension... exhale again.

I think again I feel so little,
exhale again... feel so little.

To lose didn't change your life
Taking everything away
Everything until the end.

I have reasons to be alone
Dying til I see clear
There's no revenge to explain
Will never come back

I see it will never come back!

I think again I feel so little,
exhale again... feel so little.

To lose didn't change your life
Taking everything away
Everything until the end.

I have reasons to be alone
Dying til I see clear
There's no revenge to explain
Will never come back
