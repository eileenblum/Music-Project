All began like a sweet game
My eyes followed your steps
A bitter taste in my mouth
You left in me when you got away.

And the moon was my witness,
while she stole my dream,
and the dream was breaking me...
And my only wish was to run away!

I knew the game was gonna last,
but the game was over,
and the game was gonna last,
but the game was over.

My days were so amazing that,
that the night led me to lies
and the sunlight hurt my blood,
I return again!

I return again!
I return again!
Return again!
Ah!
