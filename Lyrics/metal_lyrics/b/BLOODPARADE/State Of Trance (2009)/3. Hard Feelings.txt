Isolated with your hate,
desired of all destruction
Feeling your anger adrift
Days go by, you can't find yourself.

You don't know how to liberate
So much hatred inside you
You don't imagine your life
With no pain, no lies

Cruelty loneliness
Got over your murders life
And death played a dirty evil game
You don't imagine your life
Without evil and no hard feelings
Hard hard feelings
Hard hard feelings

Your path is ending and gets lost in the fog
With no direction, imagine life
That you'll never live
That you'll never live again

You don't know how to liberate
