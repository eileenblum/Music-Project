This moment lived was just a dream,
The seemed pain's eternal
Just like the wind, time to took it away
Never thought I'd wake up
From this doom
My world has disappeared
It's not my world

I go to other worlds
Where my instincts carry me
Today my instinct is accurate
Nothing will ever change it

Ever change it!
I don't hear that madness whisper
That has vanished in front of me
I never should have believed
In that dream
Which caught my days
Slowly I touched death
It's not my world!

I go to other worlds
Where my instincts carry me
Today my instinct is accurate
Nothing will ever change it
I go to other worlds
Nothing will ever change it!
I go to other worlds
Nothing will ever change it!

This moment lived was just a dream,
The seemed pain's eternal
Just like the wind, time to took it away
Never thought I'd wake up
From this doom
My world has disappeared
It's not my world

I go to other worlds
Where my instincts carry me
Today my instinct is accurate
Nothing will ever change it

Ever change it!
Ah! Ah!

I go to other worlds
Where my instincts carry me
Today my instinct is accurate
Nothing will ever change it
