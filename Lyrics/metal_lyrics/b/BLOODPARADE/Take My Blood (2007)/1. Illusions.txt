It wasn't impossible
to see that mirage
at every step
Go into his world
of madness and pleasure, and pleasure.

Impregnated of that illness
which hammers my head, hour by hour
tacking me down an in existent unreality, yeah!

It wasn't impossible
to see that mirage
at every step
Go into his world
of madness and pleasure, and pleasure.

Leaving the sound, the empathy moments
Leaving the empty fright you made
hour by hour,
tacking me down an in existent unreality, yeah!

Leaving the empty freight you made
involving me into his wishes
Leaving the empty freight to me
saving me from that cruelty

Oh dreaming, oh dreaming
one eternity
Oh dreaming, oh dreaming
one eternity
Leaving marks of that illusions
Leaving the empty freight you made
hour by hour
Tacking me down an in existent unreality

Leave the empty freight you made
involving me into his wishes
Leaving the empty freight to me,
feeling the taste of the unknown.
