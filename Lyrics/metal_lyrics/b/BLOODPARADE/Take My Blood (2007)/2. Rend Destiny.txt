Heartbreaking destiny, tell me who I'm desiring!
Time couldn't heal so much sorrow
It only opaque the wounds, the love fade out

I erased the past leaving the suffering night behind me
Dead step by step, no colour, no future
Unknown life, incomplete doubts

Immense solitude follows from lies
Uncontrollable feelings disappear in silence
Repeating and dying time to time

The past is dead
All get lost in distance
It get small, it made me ground
Colour without pain

Rend destiny, I just want to know
If the time will carry my agony or it just would hide my fear
Leaving me free to never ever fall again?
