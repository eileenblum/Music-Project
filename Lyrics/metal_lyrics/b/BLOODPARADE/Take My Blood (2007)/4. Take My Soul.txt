I run quickly behind that hell
It's cruel and hurt me
You feel me in sorrow
To know that you're waiting for me

I like that, I know you like that
Take my soul, do it.
Just catch me, hide the light
Just enjoy the pleasure
Stop the time
No doubts
It doesn't matter to die

Look at me, take me
If you like what you're seeing
That's all what a want?
It doesn't matter to die
If in the end you will be mine
Just do it
Give me the eternity

Take my soul
Take my body
I know you want it
Just do it!

Without a course, I'm coming to you
Destiny whispers it to me
And I know you're waiting for me
I like that, I know you're observing me
Come on take my soul,
I know you're...
I think about it, come on take my soul
