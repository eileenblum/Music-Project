Can't you see?
The fire is melting out its splendour
It's leaving ashes in the space
It fills me with glory, I'm strong again
I'm strong again!

Insane mercy melting in me
Far agony faraway from my soul
A world of hate is leaving my being
I'm strong again, I'm strong again

The wish is functioning again,
the mind whose lying in another life
Unflagging pleasures
Give the power back
And wake up from a long and anger sleep

Insane mercy melting in me
Far agony faraway from my soul
A world of hate is leaving my being
I'm strong again, I'm strong again
