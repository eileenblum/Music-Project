Desolated and  silent
Absorbent and enveloped the night
Penetrating the thought in an only pain
Shut in the suffering memories
An impatient delirium of terror
Eyes in flames, defeated eyes.
The retina has forgotten the beauty
Drawing dark..the horizon!!!!
Dying the past of an unknown void!!
Destructive and devastated!!!
Guiding you to the worst!!
Desolated and silent
Absorbent and enveloped the night
Penetrating the thought in an only pain
Shut in the suffering memories
An impatient delirium of terror
Eyes in flames, defeated eyes.
The retina has forgotten the beauty
Drawing dark..the horizon!!!!
Dying the past of an unknown void!!
Destructive and devastated!!!
Guiding you to the worst!!
But desired  the end
Taking perfect souls at the end!!!!
Destructive and devastated
Where the dreams are only nightmares!!!
The nightmares!!!
The anxiety splashes the skin with scars
Destructive and devastated
Guiding you to the worst!!
But desired the end

Dissolved  in a sea of fire
Destructive and devastated
Guiding you to the worst!!
But desired  the end
And enslaving bloodly your destiny
Destructive and devastated
Guiding you to the worst, your cruelty!!!!
The anxiety splashes the skin with scars
Destructive and devastated
Guiding you to the worst!!
But desired the end
Taking perfect souls at the end!!!!
Where the dreams are only nightmares!!!
Your cruelty!!!!!!
