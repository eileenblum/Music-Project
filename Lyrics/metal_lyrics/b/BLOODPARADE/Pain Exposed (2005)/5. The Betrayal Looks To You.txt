That loneliness tears
That evicts tears
Where here from for beyond and...
Brought pasts images to your head,
You live with the pain,
And suffer of many people.
You know, what you did
You only try to forget
And you pass to a new page,
The hate pursues your step,
And the resentment grows up,
The betrayal looks at you
And you looked away,
You take a moment and you exhale
You know it's soon, feel the madness.
You know, what you did,
You're only, trying to forget,
You only try!
Many broken hearts,
Destroyed life,
Revenge!!
Because of you deceit,
The betrayal looks at you,
And you don't know how to escape
You know what you did,
You know what you did,
You're only trying to forget,
You only try!
You betrayed his confidence,
Because of you deceit,
The betrayal looks at you,
And you don't know how to escape.
You know, what you did,
You know, what you did,
You only trying to forget,
You only try!!!
