Fear of the human things,
There's confusion inside of me
I wish it Would be part of my dreams
Do you really want to see?
All these changes in me,
The heartbeats go faster  and this
Bloody destiny.

I just want to escape
Just want to find you
And the strange pleasure will reign
Since the time brought it to me.

I can read their minds
An disturbed state
You are in despair to understand
What you'll never feel

This pleasure is so obscure
And the pain rests in me
feelings get tangled up
Around me.

I just want to escape
Just want to find you
And the strange pleasure will reign
Since the time brought it to me.

This passion is so obscure
And the pain rests in me
And the pain rests in me
the feelings get tangled up
Around me.
Feeling around me!!!!
Feeling around me!!!!
Feeling around me!!!!
