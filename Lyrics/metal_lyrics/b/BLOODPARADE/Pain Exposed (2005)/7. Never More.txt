In The solitude of the night
I Think about how you followed me
You stole my desires
I want to die!!!!!
Have you Thought about my pain
You've hurt my heart
and killed  my illusions
I said ... nevermore.
With Fury and mercy
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me.
In this darkness.
With Fury and mercy
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me.
In this darkness.
Do you feel shame for me?
I will be someone else
After I tasted your poison
I said ... nevermore.
With Fury and mercy
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me.
In this darkness.
And now where am I
If you Forgot our memories
Nothing is important now
But turn out that flame
Burned some other time
Burned some other time
Burned some other time
Burned some other time
With Fury and mercy
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me.
In this darkness.
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me.
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me.
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me.
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me
Nobody feels me
Nobody hears me
nobody feels me.
