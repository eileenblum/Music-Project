She is in my dreams
Beautiful woman dressed in red,
She has the charm of the seduction,
And the power of the Lust.
She comes further on,
Only her statuesque figure
Appears and disappears,
In front of my eyes.
Be witching woman
Your dance, your dance catches me.
Woman of the darkness
Your guffaw troubles me.
She is in my dreams
Beautiful woman dressed in red
She has the charm of the seduction,
And the power of the Lust.
Brave and daring drinker of blood
Your voice like the song wheedling
Your movements appeared through the fog
The wind brings your message to me.
Woman of the darkness
The delicacy,
And the sensuality
And the face against truth.
The flowers petals
Fade beside you,
The men surrender on your feet,
They lost their heads beside you.
Queen of the darkness,
Take me with you wherever
Your unmistakable aroma,
You, who see and know everything
Tell me where you're carrying me...
Queen of the darkness,
Takes me with you wherever,
your unmistakable aroma
Announces, Your Presence!
You, who see and know everything
Tell me where you're carrying me...
