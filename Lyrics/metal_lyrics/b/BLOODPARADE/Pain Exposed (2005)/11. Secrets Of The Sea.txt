Sounds of loneliness cross,
In front of me far away,
From where I'm sitting,
In the darkness...
I try to forget from a cliff
I contemplate a memorial precursor...
Land...CAPE!
that full moon was witness!
That dark sea was witness
Was witness!
That same winter breeze, was witness
Was witness!
The noise of the waves,
Behind that world,
Where... I can't forgive
The grey and cloudy sky is witness
The sky of tears was witness...
That bloody sand, was witness
That dark sea, was witness
Was witness
That full moon, was witness
Was witness!
That bloody sand, was witness
Was witness!
The tides smash against the stones
That voices that talk to me
Leave one mark...
The murmur of the wind
Call me to adjust
The void from that abyss!
I belong to that world... where time
Doesn't pass
The sky of tears and the dark and
Warring sea
Will keep in depth the secrets of...
My blackened soul.
The same winter breeze, was witness
Was witness
The grey and cloudy sky, was witness
The sky of tears was witness!
