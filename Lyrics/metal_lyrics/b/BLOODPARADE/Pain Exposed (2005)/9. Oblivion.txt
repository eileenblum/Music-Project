Reflections that threatened your days
Looking for a distant horizon, distant from you.
Dawn the memories that punished
Your consciousness, and without a rest
I reach the end
The pain begets pain,
The soul that you will never understand
Blinded agony was born
The exit is guiding you
The exit is guiding you
The exit is guiding you
And you only see that the exit is guiding you.
The time had many strange ways
to express, itself
lying cold, dark silence fiction
Invading that heart.
Who marked it? Who marked it? Who marked it?
The oblivion, the oblivion, the oblivion yeah!!!
And I know that you never imagined
Such prison
I know you wish to see everything inside of you
But a high abyss came...without conviction
It was a memory and now oblivion,
I curse it, I curse it, I curse it!!!
The Oblivion, the oblivion, the oblivion!!!
It was a memory and now oblivion
It was unfair, I curse it!!
It was a memory and now oblivion
It was a memory and now oblivion
Now!!
