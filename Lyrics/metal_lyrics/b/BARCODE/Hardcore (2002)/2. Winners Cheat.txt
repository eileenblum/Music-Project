Now I've got the title
And I've gained the respect
I am throwing weight around
Now I correct
All common sense that ever gets in my way
What I lack in brains I have in digits on my pay check

And I push it way too far
Even if all you fuckers came begging on your knees
I'd still keep on belching out unreasonable orders

There's only one way to always win
Gotta play the game smart - saints lose so I sin
Fairness won't build no reputation
Winners cheat and cheat hard

Still respected
