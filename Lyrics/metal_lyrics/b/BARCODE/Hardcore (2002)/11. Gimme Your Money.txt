You used to be ok
And you were never late
You used to pay on time
Used to be fine
You used to know the rules
You normally kept it cool
Now I want back what's mine
You've crossed the line

Gimme your money
Run for your life
Gimme all
Don't think twice
Gimme your money
Run for your life
Gimme all

So make a choice
If you do give a damn
D'you wanna pay or be a dying man 
Don't fake it

No more talk - no more shit - no more lies
Gimme no phony alibis
Mark my words and keep them all in mind 

Can't be worth the price that you pay
Settle score and get back in the game 
Or lose it all

Now
Time's up
