This day something happens and of course you're there
This day or another you are always near
Mingling incognito - always claiming your share
Gimme gimme something - best pals I swear

This day or another you would never care
This place or another you are everywhere 
Chit-chat small talk - guess who's there
Go get a life - get the fuck out of here 

Numb in your mind - in your head
It must stop 
It must come to an end
Dumb inside your head
Time to stop
You have come to reach the end

You're like a bad habit
Never left behind
No getting rid of
Like things you can't deny

Listen up 'cause it's time for you to get the fuck out
