Locked up - doing time behind bars
Main attraction - I'm a superstar
Life sentenced to keep it cool
Monkey business is the world I rule

What's up

The reason why I fly so high
I bang away all night
Is this hardcore
The reason why I fly so high
They'll blow me 'till I die 
Is this hardcore
The reason why I fly so high
I bang away the whole damn night
The reason why I fly so high
They'll blow me 'till I die 

This is my show
I'm pulling monkey tricks
I can't say no
To all the gorgeous hairy chicks
I pay my dues
It's dirty, mean and raw
By now you'll know
I'm Mr. Jungle Law
