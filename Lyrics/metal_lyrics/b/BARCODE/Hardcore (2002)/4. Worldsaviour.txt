I heard you snotnose punkass
I heard you - fuck you too
Sometimes it's spit or swallow
Sometimes it's up to you
Sometimes there ain't no reason
Sometimes it's time to leave
'Cause if you keep on bugging
It might fire back at you

I don't feel an urge to save the world
So please count me out
I don't feel no need to scream and shout
Any revolution way out

Go bark up someone else's tree
'Cause I'm not in the mood

I heard you fuck you too
