Push it to the limit - screaming wheels - I'm a cannonball
Ride like hell - it's addiction - it's Satan's call
Speeding's my liquor and the road's the liquor store
I'm a speeding devil and I always come back for more

And I'm thinking to myself 
My way and my way only
It's my race and I do not care
I take the lead - I'm in control

Shooting through the curves - burning rubber - I'm a highway star
We're one hell piece of the action - me an my car
Driver's seat's my domain and I rule it hard
The rules are very simple - play it smart

So let me ride them wheels like I was fucking mad
'Cause then I'm in my prime - definition of bad
Overtakes - sky high stakes
The engine roars - the pipe exhausts - I lead this chase
stay behind - ridiculous wannabe pro
This game is not a drill - no place for sissy ass hos
Pack your bags - low life class 
Kiss my ass
