No more - no
Deny
Not satisfied - not - never
Go for all - stand or fall
Lose your marbles as you crave for more
More
Tonight the leash's out wide
Reach for the end of the line

Step inside
Whatcha waiting for
Right on time
Whatcha waiting for
Step inside
Come on
Whatcha waiting for
Right on time
Whatcha waiting for

Come try the end of the line
Steady mosh to the beat of the hardcore
Tonight's no wrong or right
There ain't none satisfied

Let's take it to the max motherfuckers

End of the line

You can call
You can cry
You can do
You can die
You can't stop this thing - don't try - you'll lose the fight
