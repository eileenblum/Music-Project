I try to do what's wrong 
Try to fuck it all up
I try hard to unbehave
And I, I move 'round beyond what's sane

I'm jumping overboard
Try to fly without wings
And I always miss the call
But I - I don't seem to care at all

There's no ground
Float or drown
Filthy few
No help is around
There's no ground
There's no ground

Far out
Groping 'round
Just keep on pushing it
No shit
