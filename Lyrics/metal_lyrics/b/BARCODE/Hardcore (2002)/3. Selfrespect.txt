Just don't try
To reply
Keep it to yourself
None of your cheap lines
None of your fake smiles
Gimme something else

What you make and what you do can
Count for what you are
It's the things you believe to be true
That will bring you far

You can respect yourself
If you play for real

There's a brand new day
There's a past 
It's never plain and simple
There's narrow greed
There's fucked up deeds
You know
You know damn well
