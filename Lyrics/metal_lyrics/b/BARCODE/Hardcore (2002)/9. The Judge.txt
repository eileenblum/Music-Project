One
Is it alright
To say that you don't
Like any kind but your own kind
Two
Is it ok 
Your claim to fame
When your claim is lame 
Well if one is alright
And two is not
Where's the limit and who's to judge
But if you know 
Practice what you preach
There's choices to be made 

Who's to judge 
Who's to judge
It's a hardcore job
Who's to blame 
Who's to not
It's a hardcore job

You say you know 
'bout right and wrong
You say it makes great sense
So take the seat
And practice what you preach
There's choices to be made
Choices to be made
