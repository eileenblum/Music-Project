What's up 
What's the word in the house
Which school's representin' the real shit
What the fuck, go pretend or be true
Still it's coming down - coming down on you

What's it to you
The way that it goes
Does it move you - push you out of control
No opinion whatsoever at all
Straight up plain and simple

Now what
Keep it up - come on
Action
Step forth - don't miss nothing at all
Go
Now what
It'll conquer all
All you see - all you ever saw
Game is up
Go play the ball

Ain't no wrong or right this time
No u-turn - no run and hide
It's been built up slowly and now it's coming on strong
Ain't no wrong or right this time
No u-turn - no run and hide
Make a stand - make a move
Let's rave on
Hardcore
