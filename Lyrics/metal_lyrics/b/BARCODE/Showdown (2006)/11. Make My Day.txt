Michael Stipe â sissy whining tart
Fucking Phil Collins â the pent-up fart

Gary Moore is not bluesy but sad
Armstrong, Leblanc and the doped detour
Sorry Stephen King â there ainât no cure
Michael Jacksonâs too kind to the kids
DJ Ãtzi fucking swindler bitch

No fucking reasons â just annoy and ignite
Delivering a genuine reason to cry
Make my day â go ahead and die

Britneyâs Beers â show us your clit
Claudia Schiffer â because youâre not worth it
Ewan McGregor donât deserve the force
CÃ©line Dionâs got the face of a horse
No more surgery for little Richard
Osama â whereâve you Bin? â you fucking coward
Dieter Bolen is a popstar fool
Bill Gates needs a new hairdo

No excuse is the game tonight
No fucking reasons â just annoy and ignite
Delivering a genuine reason to cry
Make my day â go ahead and die

Bob Geldorf â self-righteous Santa
Axle Rose and his ugly bandanna
Germanyâs national football team
Play like shit â but they always win
Hairball Nickelback â epic cry-baby
Steve Martin â whereâs the fun gone lately
Jimmy Page could have been eternally all right
If not for Puff Daddy â the fucking parasite

No excuse is the game tonight
No fucking reasons â just annoy and ignite
Delivering a genuine reason to cry
Make my day â go ahead and die
