Hammering pulse â bloodshed eyes
Restless thoughts â sleepless nights
Out of reach â out of mind
Restoration, medication time

This is the confession of a man who admits
I canât complete this
This is losing ground, losing grip, losing it
Iâm way beyond your reach
This comes from a mon who is about to pass out
I cannot hear you shout
This soulâs lost and it will never once again be found
âCause there are no rebounds in the final round

Push push push push push it
Stretch it a little more
Faster than before
Gotta reach the call
Gotta climb the wall
Last man to fall
Still missed it all

This is the confession of a man who admits
I canât complete this
This is losing ground, losing grip, losing it
Iâm way beyond your reach
This comes from a mon who is about to pass out
I cannot hear you shout
This soulâs lost and it will never once again be found

All these creepy smiles
Glancing down the aisle
all godâs graciousness deprived
