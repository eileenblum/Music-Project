I pledge obedience for the Brag of the United States of Amoebica and to the Repugnance for which it stands one nation under Goth, in denial with obesity and prejudice for all

Timids fucks gone way off the edge
Anachronistics â thin end of the wedge
Flashing values out of keep with today
Dangerous fanatics hunting enemies to slay
Hypocrites far beyond consistence
Take it from someone observing at a safe distance
Faranchise Burka King to al-Queda for profit
Still, youâre offended by a prime time black tit

Youâre with us or against us
Tell you what, Mr. Wuss
And make no mistake about my shit
I wonât be part of your game

One nation under God
One nation overboard

Christian Coalition â obedience NRA â ignorance PMRC â now censor this
You phobic puritans â all shit to me
