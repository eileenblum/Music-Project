Guys without crew
Guys without a clue
Dropped the parades for a life in the shades
Got no goal
Got no grip
Drifting around like abandoned ships

They ainât got no lust for life
They wanna be left alone
People like you
People like me
They cannot cope
They ainât  got no lust for life
They wanna be left alone
People like you
People like me

On their own

Diffuse â Wonât move
Choose to lose

They ainât got no lust for life
They wanna be left alone
People like you
People like me
They cannot cope
They ainât  got no lust for life
They wanna be left alone
People like you
People like me

Guys without hope
Guys with no scope
Saved by the belt â they experience hell
Grasp nothing more
Cold to the core
Feel no joy and they ainât got no choice
