Thereâs gonna be a riot tonight
Lose your head â dive into the fight
Sense and sanity â leave it behind
Set it off â go way outta line
Reach the limit and set far beyond
True insanity will loosen the tight bonds
Scum fucks, trash, slobs, mentally stunned ones
Release â explode â weâre a megaton bomb

Full scale pure mosh â adrenaline rush
United â flat lined â dead dumb blind
No quit â full tilt â love it and lose it
Nothing beats another round in the pit

This night will be the end of this place
Rest assured â thereâll be nothing left â it wonât stand
The blast will be a full scale discharge
Weâll be back â next pit â next show â weâll never quit because

Thereâs gonna be a riot tonight
Lose your head â dive into the fight
Sense and sanity â leave it behind
Set it off â go way outta line
Reach the limit and set far beyond
True insanity will loosen the tight bonds
Scum fucks, trash, slobs, mentally stunned ones
Release â explode â weâre a megaton bomb

Full scale pure mosh â adrenaline rush
United â flat lined â dead dumb blind
No quit â full tilt â love it and lose it
Nothing beats another round in the pit
