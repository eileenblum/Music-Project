Alright Yâall
Long time no see â good to be back
Host of the finest â my friend youâre the best
This town, this bar, lord of my dreams
Start the merry-go-round â fill me up â knock me down
Pouring wine â serving draught with style
Getting laid by your booze feels great
Master, ruler, drinkslinger, god
Tender you got me by the balls

Canâ get enough
Wanna get loaded and fucked
Boozt me â blast me â fill me up
Smash my pitiful body with â best youâve got
As long as you are able to load me â Iâll be your slut

Hey hey hey

Set for sin and Iâm playing to win
Hooked at the bar â Iâm a rock ânâ roll star
Tender bring them drinks on parade
Ladies help yourselves â or let me
Let the ritual dance begin
First we get drunk and then we get ill
You can cover all of my needs
Tender you feed my dirtiest deeds

Canâ get enough
Wanna get loaded and fucked
Boozt me â blast me â fill me up
Smash my pitiful body with â best youâve got
As long as you are able to load me â Iâll be your slut
