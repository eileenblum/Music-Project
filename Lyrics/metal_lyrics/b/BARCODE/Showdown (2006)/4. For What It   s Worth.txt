Donât want your interest
Donât need your worries, too
For what itâs worth â no less
Giving up on everything
Iâm leaving it all behind
The crucial sacrifice

Bypass
Recast
Go kiss my fucking ass
Last rites â the final blast

Unstable hallowed the restless for evermore
Withdrawn immunity
These unreliable bonds
This lust for lowest low
This need for no response
Let it go

Back off â my life â my show
Out of sight â out of mind â let go

Bypass
Recast
Go kiss my fucking Ass
Witness the final blast
