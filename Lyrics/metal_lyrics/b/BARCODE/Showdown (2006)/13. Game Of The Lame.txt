This one goes out to all reality starfuckers and wannabes
The sick and twisted twenty four seven three hundred and sixty five worldwide exhibitionists
The pathetic need to confess guys they rebuild my ugly body girls
The way too mentally deranged to find a partner by myself morons

Motherfucking blastaways

Iâm sick of it â take me away
Donât give a shit about what I gotta do â as long Iâm paid
Rule me, fool me, use me, abuse me
Push me way too far
Wanna see my face all over the place
I wanna be a star

Game for fame
Game of lame
Real time destiny

Riding high
Riding prime time
Keep the tape rolling â pass me the mike
Give it a try
Expose every weakness â confession unveiled
Turn my inside out
A ridiculed fool whoâll claim to be cool
And Iâll be acting proud

Say goodbye to dignity
Lose it all in the game for fame
Farewell to integrity
All it takes is the mind of the lame
Reality game
Game of the lame
Insane
