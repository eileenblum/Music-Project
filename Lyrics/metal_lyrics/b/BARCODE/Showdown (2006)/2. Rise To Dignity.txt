Talking shit behind my back
Accusation â coward attack
Cheating liar â cheep complaints
Barking mad dog out to restrain
Speak up â speak out loud
Spit it out â Right here â Right now
Grab this opportunity to
Take back what you know is untrue

Guilty conscience

Never found a place in the herd
Sweet talk turned to bitter words
Speak up â Admit or die
Poor stray dog bark too late
Timeâs right â to put up a fight
One of us is going down tonight

Accusation

Guilty, conscience rise to dignity
Whatâs it gonna be
you fuckinâ stare back â sending those innocent eyes
Cheating cold glance â total denial on time
Too wrapped â too strapped â in your pack of lies
Canât swallow your pride

Change routine
Return to crime scene
This time reversing the deal
