Omen of death fear the snake's breath
Mosquito sting cursed by the king
Suicide dreams where the Nile streams
Ancient scripts told a curse of old
Cursed by the king

Risk a short glimpse on mummified limbs
What do you see your king is he
Obey the master blood runs faster
Go now and kill doing his will
Cursed by the king

Disease, weak flesh murder, car crash
He laughs in his grave for victims he craves
It is living on until the work is done
Death comes and then he is dead again
