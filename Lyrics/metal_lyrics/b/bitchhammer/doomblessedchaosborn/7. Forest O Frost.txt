Only trees around me taste of blood in my mouth
I hear them calling calling for me
I am lost in this forest 
I am lost in this forest of frost

Feeling the coldness running though snow and ice
Seeing the madness madness in me
I am lost in this forest 
I am lost in this forest of frost

White darkness around me shade of hate in my mind
I hear them screaming screaming so loud
They are lost in this forest
They are lost in this forest of frost
