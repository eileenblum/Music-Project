With no sense of mercy with a heart full of hate
With fire we will burn you and the world you have made
Within us lies evil it is the source of our might
No one can stop us as with Satan we ride
We will arise, you will die in pain under the whip of cruelty
You will fall and we will reign upon the throne of blasphemy

Your altars we will stain your children we will rape
You thoughts we will infect and your will we will break
Because hatred is stronger than every faith
Terror and torture make way to enslave
We will arise, you will die in pain under the whip of cruelty
You will fall and we will reign upon the throne of blasphemy

We will arise, you will die in pain under the whip of cruelty
You will fall and we will reign upon the throne of blasphemy
We will arise, you will die in pain under the whip of cruelty
You will fall and we will reign upon the throne of blasphemy
