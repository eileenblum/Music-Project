We like hell, it is where we want to be
Darkness is endless, it is what you will see
Torture and fire are waiting for you
We will be the masters, crushing you fool

Black Metal is the sound we like hell
Turn the music loud we like hell
Satan is the master we like hell
Play your metal faster we like hell

We like hell because it is full of lust
We trample on you while you lie in the dust
Devilish music is hurting your ears
His screaming voice awakes all your fears

We like hell, it is where we want to be
Darkness is endless, it is what you will see
Torture and fire are waiting for you
We will be the masters, crushing you fool
