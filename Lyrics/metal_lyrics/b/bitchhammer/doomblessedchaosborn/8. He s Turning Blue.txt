[originally by Carpathian Forest]He hung himself in the middle of the night
Found dead in the morning bright light
Got no more lithium, gave up life
They say you better give up now
It is not worth the strife the soul constipation
He is turning blue and nobody cares

He withered he is not the only one
Come on, get it over with you are not the only one
Through fires of hell
He is turning blue and nobody cares
