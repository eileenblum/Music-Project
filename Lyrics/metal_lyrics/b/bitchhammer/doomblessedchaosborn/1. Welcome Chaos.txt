War receive our blood
Pest bestow us decay
Vice temptation is here
Magic transition is near
Welcome chaos, welcome hate
Time for dying, it is too late
Welcome chaos, welcome doom
Set a fire, watch the fume

Revenge this is the way
Blight blow up their lives
Doubt forced suicide
Darkness nowhere to hide
Welcome chaos, welcome hate
Time for dying, it is too late
Welcome chaos, welcome doom
Set a fire, watch the fume
