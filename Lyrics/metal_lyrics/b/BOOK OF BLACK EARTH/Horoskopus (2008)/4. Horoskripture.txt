Horoskripture, words to shape the will and indoctrination of all, to punish the flock. The flock of the fools, damned souls to serve  the godless souls of their masters, the unholy thieves. "Worshiping light" must cast a shadow. Yet they worship the sun in denial. Like Mithra before, and the water bearer after, the signs of a "true christian god" are found in the Horoskopus. Carved in their minds of redemption, kept constantly weak. Through my will I gain ascension, to become my own god. Carved in their minds of redemption, kept constantly weak. Through my will I gain ascension, to become my own god. Foolish sheep wait for the sign, Horoskopus rise. And the devil is the only god left. And I am god. Horoskopus the signs and constellations from the black up above to the black down below, to blacken the earth. The stolen prophecy speaks the nightmares of sheep to an undying sun. In the shadows of Mithra. The false gods are reborn.
