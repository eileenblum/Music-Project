Seance for serpentine, these are the days. The living dead, living the dream, with a god's eye. Winter forever no solstice in sight, the sun will die. Blackout forever the end of light., the sun will die. The sun will die. The sun will die. The death of the sun. The death of the sun amounts to chaos you reap what you sow. Tend the garden where nothing can grow. Fire for humanity, if humans they be. Blood sucking sacks of human waste. With a god's hand. Winter forever no solstice in sight, the sun will die. Blackout forever the end of light., the sun will die. The sun will die. The sun will die. The death of the sun. The death of the sun amounts to chaos you reap what you sow. Tend the garden where nothing can grow. Dissect the sun, drink its blood.
