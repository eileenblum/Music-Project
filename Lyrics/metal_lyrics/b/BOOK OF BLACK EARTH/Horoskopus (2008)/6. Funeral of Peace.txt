Silence is the key, so turn the other cheek, oh funeral of peace. Oh funeral of peace. Fire in the tomb, to blacken out the moon, oh funeral of peace, oh funeral of peace. Silencing the worms churning in the womb, the sickening embrace of the darkest of the tombs. Their screams the ghastly choir, like smoke it fills the night and the plague unleashed made angels sing Lucifer, Lucifer was right. Is this the end of days? Then why why are they afraid, oh funeral of peace. Oh funeral of peace. Silencing the worms churning in the womb, the sickening embrace of the darkest of the tombs. Their screams the ghastly choir, like smoke it fills the night and the plague unleashed made angels sing Lucifer, Lucifer was right. The silence is broken by broken bones. Hallowed grounds hit with hollowed skulls. The nightmare that follows into light the days of sorrow serves the might of men. Try to silence, I will speak, leave the cross to the weak. If I suffer, I will speak. Leave the gods to the weak.
