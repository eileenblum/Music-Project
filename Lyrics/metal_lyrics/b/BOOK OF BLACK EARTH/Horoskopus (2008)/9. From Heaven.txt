An old new testament of faith, ripped from the hands of the dead and placed on the cross. Just as the light from above is captured below, the christened king of their church is a stolen concept of the sun. I won't wait for tomorrow, I won't wait for a sun that won't rise a god that is dead, buried in lies, I won't speak of forgiveness, to those who have no true will of their own, their fate has been sealed, their blood has run cold. I am the sword of hell and in the words of god "he who cannot be torn from heaven".

I will not sleep, I will not sleep, never.
