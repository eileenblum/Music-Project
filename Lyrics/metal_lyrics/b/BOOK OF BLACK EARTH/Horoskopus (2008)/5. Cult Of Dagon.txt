The fire that grows in the hearts of men. The thought of divine inspiration is the heart of the sun. So I wake the gods from the tomb of the ancients, hail the sun. Look to it and go blind. So I lift the veil and pass through to the other side. The will of the gods is the will of my own the will of the gods is the will of my own. There is no god, like the will of my own. There is no god, like the will of my own. All hail the sun. Murder your brothers, destroy yourselves, hang your families, all for the love of the sun. Humanity fails, the ultimate form of insanity is the cross. To deify the ultimate star in the sky, insanity. Humanity fails, the ultimate form of insanity is the cross. To deify the ultimate star in the sky, insanity.
