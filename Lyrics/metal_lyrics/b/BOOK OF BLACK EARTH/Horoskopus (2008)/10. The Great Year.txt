I can't believe in as above so below. How could this happen? Even if there was a god it would hate this fucking planet. Pray for tomorrow, pray for today. Look to the sky, worship the sun. Mutilations in the name of god. Look to the sky. Look to the sky. Sacrifices, in the name of the sun. Worship the sun, worship the sun. Spill the blood in the name of god. Look to the sky, worship the sun. I have waited forever for this age to come.
