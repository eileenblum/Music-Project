The liars, the thieves the bastards of the century have risen to die. They worship the sun based on an ancient pagan god under the sign of pisces. The sun will die. Over and over again. The god of war, bringer of desolation. The sun has set on the anointed one. The god of war, bringer of desolation. The famine that spreads from the holy land. Such as the desert itself, vacant, lifeless, covered in a holy shroud. The famine that spreads from the holy land. Such as the desert itself, vacant, lifeless, covered in a holy shroud. The god of war, the sun has set.
