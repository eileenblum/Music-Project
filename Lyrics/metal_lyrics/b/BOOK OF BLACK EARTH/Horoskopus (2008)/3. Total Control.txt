In the age of liars and thieves, no use for morals. Based the credos on die or believe, and we'll all gladly follow. SUmmon the strength and rise. Turn away from the grave. Live forever, in undead land. Though no one has ever returned. Liar. Defiler. Summon the serpent. Take total control. Liar. Defiler. Die or believe. Summon the serpent. Take total control. Summon the strength and rise. Turn away from the grave. Live forever in undead land. Though no one has ever returned. This is the way, this is our fate hatred of a world gone mad.
