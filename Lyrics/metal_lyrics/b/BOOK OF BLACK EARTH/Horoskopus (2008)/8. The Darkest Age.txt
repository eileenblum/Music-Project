In the age of astrological divinations they usurped thrones of ancients ripped apart the kingdoms then they burned all the books. For possession of power. The procession of aeons ago. Culmination of chaos. Shaped the world, the world that we know of fire. A messiah undead, war, war without end. Fire and chaos in an unholy land all for the cult of Dagon. For the possession of undying hands. Theives of history stand before me, bastards be judged. Liars, For the possession of the darkest age.
