In the time of Pahadron. Born in terror and sick with disease. Covered in eyes, I witness demise, and with their sword drawn agents of destruction let the floods begin. Let them wash over me, let me eat their flesh, let me drink their blood, and witness the demise, insanity. Civilization on its knees, because they are weak. Civilization on its knees, we are dead, if not dying in the eyes of man, in the eyes of god. Wait forever, wait for your god he will not come. Spend forever on your knees because you are weak. It begets my heart it begets my soul it begets my life, this is our church, this is what we've created. This is our curse, this is our congregation.
