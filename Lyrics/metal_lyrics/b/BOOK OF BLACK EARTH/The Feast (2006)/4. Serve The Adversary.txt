Theasuel guide them to their freedom to be cast out to serve the adversary. What more can men pen to these horror scriptures? The seeds of truth are planted in the garden, on stolen soil and with a stolen god they worship disease. They praise the ancients onces. Not known above but thriving deep within the old are called to rise and reign again. Hope is lost you resemble nothing of your anglesong. The only thing I've ever known is that your true lord lies in the shadows. Rise ancient ones see the flock that follows and sings your name. Dine elder gods feed on those who sorrow resembles our pain. Serve the serpent see the flock the before you see the chaos see the grand design. Rest in silence turn the Earth  you lie in. In defiance of this cult of lies. Hope is lost. There is nothing that resembles your anglesongs. There is nothing in defiance.
