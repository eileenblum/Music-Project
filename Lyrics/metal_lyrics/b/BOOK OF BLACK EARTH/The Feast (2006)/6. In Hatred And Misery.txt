This an offering of shadows to the grand machine. Hail your false gods in hatred and misery. Let them hate us, let them curse our names. Let them strike at us. You cannot kill what you did not create. Older than the oldest of ways with chords that run deep. Stronger than the strongest of spells with new forms rising, colder, faster, darker, let the holy ground be thy tomb. Turning of the gears mechanical, hatred, slowing of the cogs by their own blindness. The iron prison, false Christian world. Serving to remind us of our own ancient ways. Turning of the gears mechanical, hatred,  slowing of the cogs by their own blindness. The iron prison, false Christian world, serving to remind us of our own anti-Christian ways. Stray far behind us, lose your way. Lay this curse upon you in my wake. Fail as you've never failed before. Suffer in hatred and misery. Your prophecies are false, your legacy is done. Your followers grow weak. You are the feast. Your prophecies are false, your legacy is done. Your followers grow weak. You're hatred is our feast.
