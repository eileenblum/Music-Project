in an endless world of endless death
frozen in their screams
icy hands bringing icy death
cold eyes and frozen breath
frozen in their screams
haunted
tortured
by this irritating spectre

in an endless world of endless death
frozen in their screams
icy hands bringing icy death
cold eyes and frozen breath
frozen in their screams
haunted
tortured
by this irritating spectre

pushed to the edge
of the abyss
staring down
a million eyes are staring back at me

violence, torture and pain
all in the name of a ghost
damned yet free
silence as icy hands close
their cold, dead hands around my throat
i will scream
spectre

silence as icy hands close
their cold, dead hands around my throat
i will scream
spectre
irritating spectre
