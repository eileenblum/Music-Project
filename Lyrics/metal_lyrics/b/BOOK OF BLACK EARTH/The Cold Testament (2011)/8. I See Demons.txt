taking possession of human remains
everywhere i go, it's always the same
when i close my eyes, i can still see the faces
frozen dead eyes and the coldest embraces
no chance of survival, no way to escape

they creep out of darkness and into my mind
holding me hostage with unblinking eyes
slowly, they'll strangle and render the flesh
mangling bones, they'll devour the rest
i am frozen in sleep, i am paralyzed

when i'm down so low
holding out your cloven hoof
sing our songs up from the grave
into the blackest of nights

taking possession of human remains
everywhere i go, it's always the same
when i close my eyes, i can still see the faces
frozen dead eyes and the coldest embraces
no chance of survival, no way to escape

when i'm down so low
holding out your cloven hoof
sing our songs up from the grave
into the blackest of nights

i
see
demons
inside my mind
