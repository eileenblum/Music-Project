fuck the four horsemen
we're hungry like wolves
we're covered in filth, we smell worse than death, we'll ruin your world
let's trash this party
let's break all this shit
let's light it on fire and burn it to the ground, 'til it's a smoldering pit

we are the road dogs from hell
we are the road dogs from hell
we're shit out of luck, don't give a fuck, this is the life we chose
we are the road dogs from hell

from the highest of mountains
to the bottomless swamps
we're bringing you hell with a terrible smell, we won't ever stop
you can't see our stripes
we aren't ever clean
the life of a demon, the shape of a dog, do you see what i mean?

we are the road dogs from hell
we are the road dogs from hell
we're shit out of luck, don't give a fuck, this is the life we chose
we are the road dogs from hell

fucked up forever
'til death do we die
we won't even die, so don't even try

fuck the four horsemen
we're hungry like wolves
we're covered in filth, we smell worse than death, we'll ruin your world
let's trash this party
let's break all this shit
let's light it on fire and burn it to the ground, 'til it's a smoldering pit

we are the road dogs from hell
we are the road dogs from hell
we're shit out of luck, don't give a fuck, this is the life we chose
we are the road dogs from hell
