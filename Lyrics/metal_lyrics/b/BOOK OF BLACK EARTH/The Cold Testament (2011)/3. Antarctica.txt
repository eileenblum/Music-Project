fire is all
all they see
they won't believe anything
they won't be cold
until they freeze
they won't speak unless they scream
follow the footsteps of an empty god
forget, forget the past
just like a nightmare that you can't wake from
to antarctica
leave me here, i'm not afraid to die
i'm already dead

they won't be cold
