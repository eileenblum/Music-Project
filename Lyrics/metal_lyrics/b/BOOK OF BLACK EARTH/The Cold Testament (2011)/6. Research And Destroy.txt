burnt all the offerings
blackout the tombs
learn to forget it all
too many names to know

cut out the witches' tongue
throw it in the old well
crusade the old way
too many names to tell

where's the wisdom handed down?
we were told to behold all that's found
and just knowing is killing me
so it goes, on and on
research and destroy

i keep searching, it will never die
it lies hidden behind the all-seeing eye
and the pressure is killing me
so it goes, on and on
research and destroy

it's not forgotten, it's not destroyed
it's only buried in our souls

burnt all the offerings
blackout the tombs
learn to forget it all
too many names to know
