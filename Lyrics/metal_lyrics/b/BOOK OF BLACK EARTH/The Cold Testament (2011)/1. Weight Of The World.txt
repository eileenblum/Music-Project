shelter the continent
bury in ice
deny the obvious
forcing the way
forcing the weight of the world

grind away the axis
the cosmic will is churned
this one's for the old ones
forcing the way
forcing the weight of the world

into the coldest of nights
a storm of detestation
the ice is taking your life
you will go, never to know the way down
forcing the weight of the world

forcing us to new directions
into realms of unknown
rip apart old dimensions
oblivious to the cold

buired deep, long forgotten
in a tomb made of ice
i'll awake all the old gods
and watch the world fade away

into the coldest of nights
a storm of detestation
the ice is taking your life
you will go, never to know the way down
forcing the weight of the world

into the mountain of ice
a storm of detestation
the ice is taking your life
you will go, never to know the way down
forcing the weight of the world

shelter the continent
bury in ice
deny the obvious
forcing the way
forcing the weight of the world
