Did you hear the rumble of the morning rain?
Did I always stay alone, awake, all in vain?
Do you still wait there for me?
As I will 'til the end of our days
I'm not sure I feel all sane
I lack this bitter but it's all the same
There's not much left from me
But the words of this serenade
Do you remember us the way I do?
Do you see the beauty the way I saw in you?
Taste of last kiss, the promise was it bitter?
I'm sure you knew
We had it all
We have it all
And we always will
With coldest heart that's buried deep
My last words in voiceless sound of sleep
I've done, given all my everything
Could you kill the grief and turn this into sweet relief?
Until my last inhale we'll breathe the same air
As we will dance
This one last serenade
Do you remember us the way I do?
Do you see the beauty the way I saw in you?
Taste of last kiss, the promise was it bitter?
I'm sure you knew
We had it all
We have it all
And we always will
Take my hand and hold onto me
As we face the last break of dawn
Together we drift to the unknown
Hold my hand in this one last serenade
Do you remember us the way I do?
Do you see the beauty the way I saw in you?
Taste of last kiss, the promise was it bitter?
I'm sure you knew
We had it all
We have it all
And we always will
Did we run into the hearts of the great unknown?
Did we ever choose to choke in fire?
Did we only hide the truth in the lies and silence?
Take my hand, hold onto me
As we face the sweet relief
