I am running but I don't know
What is the price or the way to go
Change me, to find the leak in my soul
My system, the blood is draining in
Come on, down here, align with me
Where every moment is dead to me

I have come a long way
Fought through this, insecure
Tears have drawn this road paved
And stacked with the hearts and shades

Brand new haven, hold me in your hell
Oh you can't kill these dreams inside of me
Maybe all we have is part of the glory
The unfinished story with no end

With blue eyes staring brand new sky of silver lines
Forever I now prevail

Maybe we could turn this into heaven
Maybe we could leave out all hell
Now please tell me it was worth the pain
And patch me up from this dead man's opera
