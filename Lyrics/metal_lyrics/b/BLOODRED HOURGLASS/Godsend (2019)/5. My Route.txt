This is my route, I've started with loneliness
It's all, well, unknown for the most
With all these bumps as deep as truth that hurts
Twisted with endless turns where
I feel so blindfolded
All dark, every turn
I had a dream of waking up
From all this stored in me, gone, undone
I have no answers, I have no lullabies
Can we just pretend everything is fine?
My route
I've drawn when hopeless
It's all, well, undriven for the most
With all these wounds as deep as truth that hurts
Twisted with endless turns where
I, I had a dream of waking up
All this stored in me, all gone, undone
All dark, every way
I had a dream of waking up
From all this stored in me, gone, undone
I have no answers, I have no lullabies
Can we just pretend this one time
Everything is and will be fine?
Run, route that I've shown
God, I'm still faint
Gas, brake, stuck in my throat
You feel so slow
Could you still show me the way back, my broken road?
Now, will you take me home?
On my route
Paved with all my tears, slippery for the most
With all this love as deep as daggers turn
Twisted with endless turns where
I feel so unguided
All dark, never learn
I had a dream of waking up
From all this stored in me, gone, undone
I have no answers, I have no lullabies
Can we just pretend, can we just pretend?
In a dream of waking up, all gone
Dead memories stored in me, all gone
It's all metaphors, I have no lullabies
And nothing's broken this time
