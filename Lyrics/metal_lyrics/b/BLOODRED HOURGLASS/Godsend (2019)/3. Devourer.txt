Stuck inside a downward spiral
Out of all this mental disgrace
You're something more
Follow me, I'll show you the early grave
Like a portrait for the diseased
Paint the picture of me

Sitting on a throne of grace
I do not beat my own heart
The only thing here not so vague
We cannot live forever
If you seek for your salvation
All you have is a tribulation
Just hold onto your fucking self

We don't even know ourselves
The mirrors show no permanence
Our house is turning into a grave so
We close the curtains for the change

All vague, are we awake?
When you look back, asking, begging for more
I'm sure you knew that it's all gone wrong
When you are lost and only begging for hope
I'm sure you'll comfort from
Starting a fight, a doom in a mind
Whatever you do, keep begging the skies like
Our humans with no humanity

When you look up, asking "Are we alone?"
I'm sure you know that it's not too far
When you are lost and only begging for rope
I'm sure you'll comfort from
Keeping it tight, the vision in sight
Whatever you do, keep begging the lies might
Give a shit about the reckoning

We hide the certain
Our hearts are the countdown clocks
Just clicking into being done
Our minds are the counters of this
Loneliness, the death will devour
