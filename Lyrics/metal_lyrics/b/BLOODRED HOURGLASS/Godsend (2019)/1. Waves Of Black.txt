The truth we all hide from
When trapdoor swings out from
Beneath your feet you'll find the
Bottomless free fall
It's nothing superior
We're only inferior
Come hell or high water
There is the greed for more

So tempted to close our eyes
Pretend that we're safe and sound
But when we are lost
There is no one left for the search of us

This is the universe not made for me
And this is the universe, not made for you
We are the paradox, we can't live forever
In the waves of black
Where the dead whales can't wave back

It's a system of balance
We are disguise of reality
It's a conflict and health
We are friends, we are enemies

But every time I take a look at us
It's like the wisdom is forbidden in us
We are no reason of creation
But a humiliation
