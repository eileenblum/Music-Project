We were given all once into our hands
We explored the chances to make it last
We discovered a way to integrate
We stopped, rewinded, repeated everything

Days of glory turning to extinction
Only the strong will survive this fall

Every wave is new until it breaks
They say there'll come the day
There will come the day

Even the last of us will fall
Proud of what we stood for
The day that we will be gone
Proud of we still stand for

This is the last of us
I have prayed for the gods and seven seas
These are the last of us
I sacrificed my love and all my dreams
I have sailed from my safe harbors
Catching trade winds on my sails
And then they say there will come the day

Even the last of us will fall
Proud of what we stood for
The day that we will be gone
Proud of we still stand for

Proud of we still stand for

They say there'll come the day
There will come the day

Even the last of us will fall
Proud of what we stood for
The day that we will be gone
Proud of we still stand for

This is the last of us
We are the haunted, dead or alive
These are the last of us
This is where we stand 'til the end to come

This is the last of us
We are the haunted, dead or alive
These are the last of us
This is where we stand 'til the end to come
Take my hand and we end this one
We, the last of us
