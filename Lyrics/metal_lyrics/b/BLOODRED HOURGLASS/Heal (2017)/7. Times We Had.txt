If we come to face the days
Of falling skies and burning seas
Will you be there holding my hand guiding me
If we come to face the days
Of dying hope and broken dreams
Will you count on me if I will
Guide you through

No matter how far we are
We will always have this life
No matter how far we've come
We will always be connected

The times we had
They'll never come back
Unless we try our best to get rid, to see through our past
Times we had
Guess they only fall down to me
Down to you
As an endless truth

It was clear from start
That I will end up scarred
Like no one here before
You sure will leave a mark
But I will carry my wounds that no one else can see
Asking only question how this life could have been

You are my river â my land
Air that I breathe â the trees that stand
You are the stars â my moon
My everything â the end of me

You are my river
You are my land
The air that I breathe the trees that stand you are the stars
My moon, my endless truth you are my everything the end of me
