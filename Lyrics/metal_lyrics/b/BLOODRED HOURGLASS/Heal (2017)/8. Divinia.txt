I have lost all the signs that I followed
Light in horizon has faded away
Now I'm left without no soul, no companion
Trusting only myself on this very day
Guess I'm a man
Who already blew his shots
Still aiming at all directions
Against every single odd

I have drank from the well of the gods of the lost
And suddenly it seems so clear
Now that I'm leaving alone I will
Forever drift here

All of regrets goddamn meaningless
When I turn the page, when the skin recreates
I have seen the light afar from this darkness
And it shines my steps to the future where my heart is
My heart is where my home is
So can you feel it when
I am leaving and I'm asking you to follow me
I am asking you to follow me

All of my life
I've done my best to beat the rest
But the biggest of all the rivals found within myself
I am leaving and I'm asking you to follow me
I'm asking you to follow me

With everything in my hands
I have never been satisfied
My paradox, oh my path
This is my true paradigm

All of my life
I've done my best to beat the rest
And there is this fucking rival
- myself

My heart is where my home is
So can you feel it
Will you still feel it
