In fear
Last chapters of our hope
These are my final words
I've waited evermore
And you were not there for me

In tears
We were Cain and the Snake
We faced these same mistakes
I've waited evermore
This is my one last serenade

A soldier from our past oh father of time
These are my last days
I have more words left than have days
And so I choke in

In grace
My scars grew deep and old
They no more make no sound
This is of the requiem of our century

There's only so much pain
As there is salvation
We seek it through our -
We seek it through our hopes
We fall, we fall out of this grandeur
Lo and behold
Hearts and souls
They will cry evermore

When there is no tomorrow
When we crawl through the times, oh so sour
Alone we face ourselves
The only crestfallen
We're the ones with broken reality
When every morale is built on hypocrisy
Not one - no one
Will ever be writing history
Come and carry me into the night
In the cradle of eve hold me this one last time
No love - no trust
Never together but maybe weâll meet in hell

I'll take you down
It's like an avalanche
The way you brought it out
Only killed your lonely shouts
There's no more
Your little paradise
You have shown
Every shade of disgrace
This is the world
The only paradigm
Time to rise, time to fall, time to carry on
This is the war
Oh little seraphim
There is only the monolith of solitude

On this hour they declare a war
May love now take back the place
To tie hands from being apart
To become one

Lo and behold
Hearts and souls
They will cry cry so evermore
As we fall down through these skies of no hope
We paint the chapters of our own
When we cry in times of desperation
We have nothing we can heal
