Let the bloody heaven fall
We've already seen it all
In the destruction we've had to rebuild
That's how we've kept the evolving in

Way to go, welcome the fall
Right about to lose it all
None but ourselves are guiding the way
Lighthouse of faith all down from the shame

It's all the same
You keep the change

Depress the darkness
Defile the shadows
A will to find the day
Find the day and we will find the way

Mesmerized,
Paralyzed
Suckers bite their holy blood
Never had a thought where you gather it all our headaches,
Shit storm servants

We have the freedom,
We have the will
Not exactly we're out of the sins
Never ever questionize my eyes
They burn the fire inside

Hide the wings to fly when darkness surrounds
Off the world we'll find our way

Depress the darkness
Defile the shadows
A will to find the day
Find the day and we will find the way

Depress all the darkness
Defile through the shadows
Have a will to find the day
And we'll find the way

Depress the darkness
Defile the shadows
A will to find the day
Find the day and we will find the way

Fly away like a firebird
Run away with the heart oh so hurt
If I let you fly alone will you find the way?
