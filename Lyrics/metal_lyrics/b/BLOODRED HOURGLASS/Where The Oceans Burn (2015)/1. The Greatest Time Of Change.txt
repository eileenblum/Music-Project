Sin for the sorrow
Scream in a broken heart
In these frail days we keep burning
In darkness without fate

We fade

In this greatest time of change, we keep falling
While this fire inside our hearts burns our wings

In this greatest time of change, we keep falling
All this hollow remains won't fade away
The end has a ghost for you
The end has a ghost for me
As we fall out, we escape

We seek the savior in silent cries
All for nothing, with death aside
We feel forsaken despite the raging fire
Fractured mind, we still fight
Stigmatized we still ignite
In the end of it all, lose the battle
We all fall
We all fall

Our dreams have become dead, our blood has become shed
Our weakness, out of regret, no longer bleeds the core
We all fall

Where you gonna head when the sky is black?
Who you gonna stare with the eyes oil black?
Will we ever see the end of the road?

If you let go, you never know this far in the grounds unknown
If you choose life maybe you'll find the price at the end of the road

Or suffer in the wait for sanctity
Straight out from nowhere
They tear the sun down
In the darkness, in fear
Our night remains

In this greatest time of change, we keep falling
All this hollow remains won't fade away
The end has a ghost for you
The end has a ghost for me
As we fall out, we escape

Run around, your blood runs out
In the darkest of the hours we have become only ghosts
guidance to the home we will never reach again, no salvation

Circle of blood
Life is just freezing right inside of you
Circle of blood
Tears feel so burning right inside of me

Frozen and doomed to walk
Kill the light that would guide us home
Hear their call, the wind, the fire
Tears fall out, in defile
My desire

We heal the fear in shelter
We melt the tears my loved one
We fade and die

Face of hopeless, the eyes of grace I drown in
The end awakes, the last are the words my loved one
We never see home

In this greatest time of change, we keep falling
All this hollow remains won't fade away
The end has a ghost for you
The end has a ghost for me
As we fall out, we escape

In the greatest time of the changes, we're falling
In hollow that won't fade away
This is just a ghost of me, just a ghost of you
Into the wind we fly
