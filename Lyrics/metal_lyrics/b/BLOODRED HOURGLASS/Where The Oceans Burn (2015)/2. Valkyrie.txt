We built this fallen bridge
The very first day we met
Never said I did any better
My heart all over the place

Just a remind of days
Will make it burn both ways
Sure as hell we blew it together
With blood all over the face

Since the day I breached through to you
My breath shall burden yours too

Was it for me to take
Only for you to break
Maybe just another way
You my little parasite
Really just to seek me
Maybe fight to live in me
Or just another day
For you my little paranoid

I've lost my mind
In the final fight
We've passed through the final night
Bestowed by the hope of light

Was it for me to take
Only for you to break
Maybe just another way
You my little parasite
Really just to seek me
Maybe fight to live in me
Or just another day
For you my little paranoid

Oh my valkyrie
I'm so lost in my disbelieve

I was so lost in your paranoia,
Your sound, killed your noise

Was it for me to take
Only for you to break
Maybe just another way
You my little parasite
Really just to seek me
Maybe fight to live in me
Or just another day
For you my little paranoid

Was it for me?
Or was it for you?
