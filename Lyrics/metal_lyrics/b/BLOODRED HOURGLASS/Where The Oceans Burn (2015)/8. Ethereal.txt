This vile curiosity consumed her faith
Gone into the wind with the ashes of the agony and sin
This flickering faith she fell
Turn it lose and let the omen burn
This world will keep on changing
But you never learn

Until you never wake up again

Shooting down the odds
Welcome the misfortune
We have learned to swim just by watching you drown
Shooting down the stars
Confined and forsaken
Confined and betrayed
We must fight through this life of our time

And never wake up again
And never wake up again

Destruct
Burn the witchcraft hearts
Restruct
Burn the fractured scars
Ancient power, lies and greed
You selfish, control your breed
Angels holding hands in the world
Soon we'll never wake up again

We will never wake up again

The world is set on fire
We have a thing to save
Save your breathe and your sermon
It's the last thing to ever retain

The world is set on fire
We have a thing to save
Now, you have nothing to say?

Shooting down the odds
Welcome the misfortune
We have learned to swim just by watching you drown
Shooting down the stars
Confined and forsaken
Confined and betrayed
We must fight through this life of our time

And never wake up again
And never wake up again

Just a crest of wave
The justice, a part of what's gone wrong
Running to the outcome
We have nothing to save

Angels keep dancing 'til the end of the days
Playing the same song right 'til the end
And never wake up again

Soon we will never wake up again
