For once I have stood in trust, in the name of the days been born
May this be the way that I refuse to be the one to fall
Abandoned I faced myself when lost the traces
Bloodstained in front of your face I burn the pages

So what if I will never accept to say it to you
Shall I burn in hell or heaven in the flames of your fury
Last daylight
All the hope that fought went - gone in hell
So empty, cold-hearted human stains

We are doomed to walk alone here
From the moment we are born in
We will fight the field with honor
Our hearts only as cursed as blessed of being mortal

So what if I will never accept to say it to you
Shall I burn in hell or heaven in the flames of your fury
Last daylight
All the hope that fought went - gone in hell
So empty, cold-hearted human stains

So what if I will never accept to say it to you
Shall I burn in hell or heaven in the flames of your fury
Last daylight
All the hope that fought went - gone in hell
So empty, cold-hearted human stains

Nothing will last forever
There is no eternity
And we will never win before losing everything
The wings will guide us home
To the place where we belong
To become everfree

Become dead supreme
Become dead supreme
