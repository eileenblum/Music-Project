Fearful faces
Stranded hearts
Between birth and death we all fall
Heartaches, fatal words cares of the waking world
Come to terms with our days and scars as decorations

Final heartbeats giving in
Lose the battle to flatline in my sweet end of the world

My sweet end of the world

On a day when the thoughts can be found
In a stone and six feet down the ground
Your world will bleed out of blessings

Breathe in
My sweet end of the world

Are we planning to die tonight
Drift nothing learned where the oceans burn
Are we planning to live the night
Or paint the skies with the ashes of the world

Burn

Oh my sweet end of the world
The revelation of desire and the final flame out
Fade out

Are we planning to die tonight
Drift nothing learned where the oceans burn
Are we planning to live the night
Or paint the skies with the ashes of the world

If you're planning to die tonight
We'll hold the skies for a while

Die tonight
Never learn
Live the night
End of the world

If you're planning to die tonight
Don't bloody wait me
You'll bring us a world to breathe

Drift with nothing learned
Live through the night
Grey the skies of the world

Are we planning to die tonight
Drift with nothing learned
Planning to live the night
Grey the skies of the world

Oceans on fire will freeze on the day
We drift to silence in safe
