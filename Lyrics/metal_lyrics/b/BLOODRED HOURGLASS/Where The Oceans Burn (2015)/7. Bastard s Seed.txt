Feed it with fire
Seed it to life

Born to witness this life here
Hard not to feel the shame
Shame on you for bringing the sorrow earth down to her knees

In this world of greed uncontrolled, selfishly
Fuel the flames of seed when nothing remains
The victim is stained
Where is your planet b?

Creation on hold now or we will fall
Crash and burn down
You feel no remorse

Buried alive we've torn open
Heart of the earth, so broken

Her sore eyes keep begging for freedom
But your pale hands keep shoveling graves
What have we done with this power
Lost the control of running this breed

This world has overcrowded, paralyzed,
Blinded by the fear and lies
And I cannot believe
How this humanity is withered in bastard's seed

You brought her so much of the hollow
Families the sorrow
With your useless burning greed

Creation on hold now or we will fall
Crash and burn down
You feel no remorse
Buried alive we've torn open
Heart of the earth, so broken

Feed it with fire
Seed it to life

Feed the fire with infinity
But you're bringing in the final destruction
We run out of air
We run out of room

Because of people like you

We run out of air

We run out of room
Until we run out of people like you

We run out of air
Until we run out of people like you

Someday you will open up your eyes and see
This world has overcrowded paralized and blinded
...
Cannot believe still you bastards seed

Someday you will open up your eyes and see
This world has overcrowded paralized and blinded
...
Cannot believe still you bastards seed
