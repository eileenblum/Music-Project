Time is up
Count me out from the rest of the days
You may try to fight the reaper inside of you

Leave you try the wrap of sanity laid on you
Ask your gods what are you going to do
When there is nothing left to lose

I have already wondered enough in the time to be chosen
I'll take it from here on my own
While your heart goes frozen
Questionize your path of sorrow
Keep your laws in your own graves

In the end we all
To the safe we fall
Buried alive by the darkness
Now what you need is what you breathe

Take a look into these eyes
Let me say my last goodbyes
I wanna see the sun falling
So fall in and dream out of sorrow

Never leave me die here hopeless on the grounds of the holy-hearted suckers of the sorrow and lies behind the suffer
The circle will complete and pass my pain away
Now can you judge my strength here with more ignorance in veins

It's to be chosen when life goes on around here
There is no room for weakness right inside here
You are the reborn
Generation fail

Give me the doctrine of eternal sleep
Bring me the beauty what you can not see
You fucking piece of generation fail
We have no reason to suffer all the pain

In the end we all
To the safe we fall
Buried alive by the darkness
Now what you need is what you breathe
Take a look into these eyes
Let me say my last goodbyes I wanna see the sun falling
So fall in and dream out of sorrow

Never surrender to pain
They say you'll survive
Burn it in your sermon
Freedom of soul
Give me my way to go
Weak upon my heart will die
Cannot go back and rewind my time
All that hate this world gone through
You bought yourself the fucking rules
Just to lie
Just to wait 'til we die

From the love that you break free
Turned into hate can't be prayed free
Tearing our loved ones down
We were soulmates we were one

And I cannot believe it
Face the world as you see it
'Cause we were one until we're done
Soon to be gone

All the love that you gave me
Burns in the heart soon to fail me
Tearing my life came down by force fed lies
On starless skies
Again no longer the pain revolves in me
Never ever wake up in me

Now what we deceived (deceived) in this life that forms us the sorrow (sorrow)
As we wither (wither) paralyzed in our prayers (prayers)
So we receive this choice to bring in the hollow
Still we dream on while you kill our final hope

Never ever wake up in me again
Never ever wake up in me again
