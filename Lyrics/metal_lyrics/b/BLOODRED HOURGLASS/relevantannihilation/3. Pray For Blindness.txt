Bury my lies inside my pain shell
Make you another ripped apart victim
Cover it up - to let go - set 'em all on fire
Bleed to death and torn asunder
Suffer under the black sun
Memories laid six feet under

Another rejection
You'll never pay off
A re-arrangement
In the suffering dimension

Fucking ripped and torned apart asunder
The merciful plague
The judgment of mortal law
Clever of the arrival
No really need to mention
Fed to breathe?
There's your death to bleed

Feed my eyes
The more you feed your personal torment
Bury and deny you
Step aside underneath my eyes

Bury my life into my plague shell
The enlightenment of the chosen
I'm here to fuel the fire
Of your personal torment
So fucking strengthen
Won't see the light of day
Another soul to rip apart and broken
