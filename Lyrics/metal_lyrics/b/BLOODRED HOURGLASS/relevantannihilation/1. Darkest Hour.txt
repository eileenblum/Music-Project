Massacre
Serious mental empire
Generate your life through the lies
And you still walk over

Spread the ache
Black-hearted you will become
One faking truth and denial
Bury the absence to become

Two steps to point so last
No one ever crawled in the name of sense
Last chance to dance in this
In the sense of agony
In the serious mental empire
The presence of the darkest hour
