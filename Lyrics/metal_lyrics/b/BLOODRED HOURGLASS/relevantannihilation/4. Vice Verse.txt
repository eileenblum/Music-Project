Ripped all apart and
Burned it down to the ground
Failure - traitor - phenomenal dimension
The dice thrown testimony
Build my rest in agony

Single fuckin' tear to cry
To form the lake of death no hide

For my eyes falling
Fuck my torment- don't know how I feel
Fate in my eyes falling down
Praise my life for falling
Fuck your judgment - don't know how I feel
Death in my eyes crawling back

This shit now has been rot
And the guilty one lives with a judge
Filthy - traitor - the lies are undenial
Nothing but your own knowledge
You wish never had gain

You'll throw the hate
I'll catch the fear and rise to loose it all
Failure - total - fucked up consequences

I beg you father to take a part
I rip you down and beat you to the ground
I rip you down and slick your fucking throat
