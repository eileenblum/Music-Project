You're a cancer to me
A coexistence
Fill you with regret
Unleash the disquiety
It's all ripped by the plague
Break your record just listen a second
Hear the story of the fearless glory
The rope hanging around too free
Sufferless equals instant freedom
I will defy
Until you've come through me
Spinning the bottle - can't soulmate but bottom

Trespass my reflection
It's stated so around
It's stated so loud
It's stated down to the ground
Path in the ground
Leading to the unknown
Too far from where it used to be alive

Blame was it here when you came to see
Closing the walls so endlessly
Embracing with my sins
The truth swared the most hated

My life went you never came to see
We broke the glass hand in hand
And those are the hands
The hands that now bleed
