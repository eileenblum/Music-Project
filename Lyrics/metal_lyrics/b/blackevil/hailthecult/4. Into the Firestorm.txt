Total suffer â die in pain
The age of fire is still insane
Mantichoras is ascending
Satan's triumph is unending

Hellish leagues are on their march
Infernal horns â they're rising up
The ancient spirit still lives on
All the sanctums, they are gone

Darkened force attacking hard
Oh what a diabolic art
We're tingling with dark desire
Pentagram is held up higher

The only might â the hell emperor
Final end for christian terror
The horde is swimming through the Styx
Wicked lust â 666

Fuck the angels, eat their flesh
Profanning all their sacraments
The mighty monster is spitting fire
They'll burn on the funeral pyre

We drink their blood on the fire â throne into the firestorm
We drink their blood on the fire â throne up the fire horns
We drink their blood on the fire â throne Blackevil to the bone
We drink their blood on the fire â throne into the firestorm
