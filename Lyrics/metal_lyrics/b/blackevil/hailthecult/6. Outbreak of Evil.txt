[originally by Sodom]It's time to die
Death stands behind the door
Satan sends his warriors
Demons break out of hell

Shrill cries
Angel dies
Shrill cries
Outbreak of evil

With swords and axes
The fight hard
In a massacre
They feel the hot smart

None can survive
People will destroy
Souls like hell
Where demons make a toy
