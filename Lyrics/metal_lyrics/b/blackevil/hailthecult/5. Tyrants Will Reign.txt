In the temple of the grey
The cold winter light
Ancient throne
Tyrants will reign

Tyran'ts power rise
Into the night
In spheres of time
Raging like storms

Flames reflecting in their eyes

Forgotten crown
Walk the gates that are open wide
In spheres of time
Diamonds of black

Conquering the realm of light

In the temple of the grey
The cold winter light
Ancient throne
Tyrants will reign

Possessed by fire
The eternal flames
Darkened supremacy
Tyrants will reign

The black ones has risen
Mighty hordes are against the light
In spheres of time
Towards the end
Clothed in robes of blood and gold

Holy father
Heavenly doors are now their hell's gates
In spheres of time
Will of God is no more
Hatred burns within their veins

The wolf head's tyranny
