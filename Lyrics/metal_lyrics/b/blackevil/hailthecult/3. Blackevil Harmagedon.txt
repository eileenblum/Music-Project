Seven angels you will see at night
On wings of pestilence and scarlet eyes

Blackevil harmagedon
Seven seals will be opened in a rite
Smoke out of the pit is rising to the sky
Seven plagues will appear with all their might
Souls of the martyrs on the altar cry

Blackevil you bastards â return of pure sin
Blackevil you bastards â fervour under your skin

Seven trumpets you will hear at night
Thunder and lightning, hail and fire mingled with blood
Seven bowls of wrath are pouring out
We all are blaspheming the name of God

Seven words and the rise of Babylon
Dead seas of blood and the seductive whore
Seven kings will reign â collapse of the worlds
Seven obscure visions in the final war
