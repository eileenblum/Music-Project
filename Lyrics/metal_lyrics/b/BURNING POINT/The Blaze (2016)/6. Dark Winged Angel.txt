Down on my knees
Granting you the full control
Head over heels
But so blind to the truth

Use and abuse go as you please
Life's build on lies

Another night alone -
Dark winged angel
Born with a heart of stone -
Dark winged angel

Ruthless to the bone
Only a game you play
Your own killing zone
You won't take no prisoners

Use and abuse go as you please
Life's build on lies

Another night alone -
Dark winged angel
Born with a heart of stone -
Dark winged angel
Memories will fade away -
Dark winged angel
Forsaken your soul will stay -
Dark winged angel
