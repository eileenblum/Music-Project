Raging this fire inside
So hard to tame
Rearranging my life once again
Gods of war will guide my way

On the wings of fire
My spirit spirit travels on to Valhalla
Hunger and desire
I'm gazing at the stars in the western sky

I'm restless the battle awaits
The honour is on the line
Endless the love for the blood
Imprisoned to this lonely life

On the wings of fire
My spirit travels on to Valhalla
Hunger and desire
I'm gazing at the stars in the western sky

Searching for the answers
Looking for the truth inside
Bursting from the frenzy
The sword is gleaming in the light
