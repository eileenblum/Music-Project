Nations are crying
They're falling deeper
Overkill of the urges
Wake up sleepers

Lost in the valley of lies
Insurrection comes from behind

Discontent and creed
Pay the piper what you owe him
Shadows from within
Assure the innocence
Just escaped the hands of hangman
Evil from within
Chaos rising

Cold-blooded killers
Society's crumbling
Infiltrate to this madness
Mankind stumbling

Lost in the valley of lies
Insurrection comes from behind

Discontent and creed
Pay the piper what you owe him
Shadows from within
Assure the innocence
Just escaped the hands of hangman
Evil from within
Chaos rising

Feel the breeze it chills the bones
It's a mind disease
Spreading all the world
