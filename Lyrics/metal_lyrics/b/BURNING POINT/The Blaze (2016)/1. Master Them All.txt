My canvas is blank
It's time to paint the new world
Relight the embers
Of my dying soul

Angels on my right
Guide me tonight
Let the demons set me free
In a quest for the truth I live in a lie

Come wind come fire
Bring rain and the storm lightning
And thunder will roar
Determined to conquer
The highs and the lows
I will master them all

Persistence is futile
The evil minded say
My heart is on fire
The passion never fade away

Demons on my left
Pretending they're dead
Let the angels set me free
In a quest for the truth I live

Come wind come fire
Bring rain and the storm lightning
And thunder will roar
Determined to conquer
The highs and the lows
I will master them all
