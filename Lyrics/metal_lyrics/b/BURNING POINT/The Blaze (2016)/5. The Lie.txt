Don't lose yourself
In the storms of the world
Pressure is strong so strong
You just want to survive

Certified madness
Boarding this ship of fools
The trip to nowhere
Enter the Neverland
Neverland

Eternity will fail
So frail the times
And the memories
Dream the dream
Tell me the lie it's forever

Destination unknown
Everytime as a new day dawns
We have high hopes so high
Obscured by desire

Certified madness
Boarding this ship of fools
The trip to nowhere
Enter the Neverland
Neverland

Eternity will fail
So frail the times
And the memories
Dream the dream
Tell me the lie it's forever
