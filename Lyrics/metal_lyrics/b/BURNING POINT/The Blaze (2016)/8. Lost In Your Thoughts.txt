No straight line
There's always a twist
Talking in circles again

It's very clear to see
Your mind is so sick
Always someone to blame

Too blind to see
Too deaf to hear the truth
Too innocent to feel the guilt

Demon dances with your soul forever
Always lost in your thoughts
Demon dances with your soul together
Forever lost in your thoughts

Your creation
This monster inside
Screaming to break free

Declaration of war
In your mind
Another killing spree

Too blind to see
Too deaf to hear the truth
Too innocent to feel the guilt

Demon dances with your soul forever
Always lost in your thoughts
Demon dances with your soul together
Forever lost in your thoughts

Rise and fall of this
Sad and lonely soul
Demon calls
Another banquet is
Ready to be served
