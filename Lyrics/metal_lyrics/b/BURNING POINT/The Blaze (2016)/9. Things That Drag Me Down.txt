Apologies from me
I was behaving badly
Everything I did you deserved

Out of the black
Straight into the heart of darkness
No turning back
The end is on the way

You're not a friend of mine
The parasite you suck the life
My soul is drained from black
I'm free for all the
Things that drag me down

I'm sorry I have to say
I did it all again
Still it's far less what you've earned

Out of the black
Straight into the heart of darkness
No turning back
The end is on the way

You're not a friend of mine
The parasite you suck the life
My soul is drained from black
I'm free for all the
Things that drag me down

I regret the words
That was unfairly spoken
Verbal abuse don't cover your lies

Out of the black
Straight into the heart of darkness
No turning back
The end is on the way

You're not a friend of mine
The parasite you suck the life
My soul is drained from black
I'm free for all the
Things that drag me down
