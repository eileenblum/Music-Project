Malicious spawn from hell
Angry devil's sent
Wicked like an fallen angel

Infected by the past cutting like broken glass
Outrageous like a total stranger

Nowhere to run no place to hide away
Shock to the system it's an ultimate dismay

It's endless I'm helpless
Save me incarnation of Jekyll and Hyde
Out of nowhere the cold stare
Save me incarnation of Jekyll and Hyde

Distant memories under lock and key
Confined in the darkest dungeon

Shadows dancing on the walls
Grotesque masquerade ball
Souls being torn asunder

Nowhere to run no place to hide away
Shock to the system, it's an ultimate dismay

It's endless I'm helpless
Save me incarnation of Jekyll and Hyde
Out of nowhere the cold stare
Save me incarnation of Jekyll and Hyde
