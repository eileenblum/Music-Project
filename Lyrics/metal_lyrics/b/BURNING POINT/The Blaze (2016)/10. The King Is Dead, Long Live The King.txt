It's the strength of the will inside
Lost the battle lay down and die
The essence of you is gone

So much power to break the walls
You're unable to resist its call
The essence of you is gone

Walking on a wire
You lose the balance you lose it all

The king is dead, long live the new king
Savior of this world of ours
Take it all my soul's wide open, embrace me

Diving in to the pool of blood
Humble servant of the new god
The core values have changed

Chasing shadows in this lonely world
Headstrong to the blind curves
The core values have changed

Walking on a wire
You lose the balance you lose it all

The king is dead, long live the new king
Savior of this world of ours
Take it all my soul's wide open, embrace me
The king is dead, long live the new king
Bringer of the endless pain
Surrender to the powers unknown
Enlight me

Feast upon this soul on fire
Let it burn to the ground
Bleed until the last drop falls
Until the last drop falls
