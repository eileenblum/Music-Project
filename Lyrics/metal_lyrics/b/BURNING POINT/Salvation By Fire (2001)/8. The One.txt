[music by P.Ahonen, lyrics by P.Ahonen &amp; J.Kyro]

For what it's worth, there's nothing I have learned
I've seen a thousand wars

Desperate cries, filled up my ears
sorrowed lands drowned in tears

[Pre-chorus]

There's no love in soulless man
we are torn apart like slaughtered lamb

Who possess the power, in the final hour
Who will claim your soul?

Covered in blood, is the future of mankind
crystal ball tells it all

[Pre-chorus]

There's no love...

[Chorus]

Who is The One?
who will you turn to?
(and) when the day is done
who's The One you fear?

The world is full of wise men and fools
Do as thou wilt, choose one of our rules
(Do as you will)
because all in all we end up the same
pale and naked we wait for judgement day
