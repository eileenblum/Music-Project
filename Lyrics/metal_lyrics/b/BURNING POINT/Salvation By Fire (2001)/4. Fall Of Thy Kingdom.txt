[music and lyrics by P.Ahonen &amp; J.Kyro]

Suspicion grows inside my head
the life I have lived
makes me see red

It's time to make the tables turn
all the bridges will burn

[Chorus]

All the secrets unfold
all the stories will be told
it's the Fall of Thy Kingdom

Repeating phrases from the book
your future is already doomed
it's the Fall of Thy Kingdom

Abandoned by your faithful few
breaking the spell
taking our lives from you

Your walls will come crumbling down
you have lost the jeweled crown

[Chorus]

Finally kings and queens
were defeated by the servants
silence falls on empty halls
the reign of terror has gone
