[hidden track]
[music by P.Ahonen, lyrics by P. Ahonen &amp; J. Kyro, Arrangements by Burning Point]

In-completed life something was missing
Left all alone in the cold

Cries in the dark, but no one was listening
Was it indifference that killed the spark?

Preachers of the kingdom they say I never die
But do I want to live an endless life?

I can be the judge, the jury and the hangman in one
Medals of honor will shine on my way

[chorus]

The law was weak, they could not keep me
Locked in my prison sell.
I won. I'm your prodigal son
And now I'm finally free.
Words of wisdom, deceived the system
I'm free from my prison sell,
Minor error will turn to terror
'Cos now I'm finally free.

Where's the life I was supposed to live
Where's the world I was thought to believe

Beneath the surface lies the beast
All calculated no chance to flee

[chorus]
