[music by P.Ahonen, lyrics by J.Kyro &amp; P.Ahonen]

Despite all the pain
I have a strong belief
darkness and rain
won't bring me down

[Pre-chorus]

Through fire and water I run
borrowed time Under the Dying Sun

I remember the time
The time of innocence
a child-like belief
the faith in god

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Forever I'll try
through my lifetime
You won't see me cry
before the last sunrise

'til the end of it all I will fight...

I still stand on my own
last days are passing by
I have to be strong
I never let go

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
