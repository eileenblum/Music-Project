[music by P.Ahonen, lyrics by P.Ahonen &amp; J.Kyro]

[Introduction:]
Far away from foreign land
came the strange soulless man
drove all the righteous men
out of their homes

Hear the whole nation cry
help from the other side
against the eastern dark
The Battle of the End

I hear the sound of the thunder
coming from distant skies
dance of the dead
in the circles of fire
keeping the gods on our side

Blood of a man stains the green land
leaving the mark of death
falling from grace
into quicksand
it makes you hard to breathe

[Pre-chorus]

(Those) bright burning eyes
reflect a soul of a warrior
born from the fire of ancient gods

[Chorus]

Salvation by Fire will come
reflecting the deeds undone
face the destiny

Salvation, Salvation, Salvation will come...

Deliver us from the evil
deliver us from the go(o)d
deceiver reigns in silence
this is the end of my world

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2]

Salvation by Fire will come
reflecting the deeds undone
face the destiny

Salvation by Fire will come
reflecting the deeds undone
repeating history

We lean on the ones,
the ones who let us down before
We die for a cause:
a cause long lost in the history
