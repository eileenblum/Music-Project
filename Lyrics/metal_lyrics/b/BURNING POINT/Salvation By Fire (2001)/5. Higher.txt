[music by P.Ahonen, lyrics by P.Ahonen &amp; J.Kyro]

I'm disappointed in you
we passed the turning point
there's nothing to be done
we're darkness and light

I'm disappearing into you
your mind is like a maze
you can't see my point of view
we're drowning in lies

[Pre-chorus]

Show me, the darkness of your
heart grown cold
open your eyes and see...

[Chorus]

Higher, emotions will rise
Desire, still burns behind the lies

Unspoken words can't be heard
if you don't keep an open mind
distant skies will turn to red
the puzzle unsolved...

Is this battle all in vain
the pain and the suffering
the question still remains
is there light in the dark

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
