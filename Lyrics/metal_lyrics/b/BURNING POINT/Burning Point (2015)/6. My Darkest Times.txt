Bruised and battered
There's a hole in your soul
Abused and shattered
Impossible to make it as a whole

Twisted view
How love lives and breaths
How little I knew
We didn't share the same dream

You lied to me
You weren't truthful to yourself

I spend my darkest times with you
Iniquity rose, you were untrue

Hollow words
They were all based on lies
Now it seems absurd
You are a devil in disguise

Confused and dazed
I did the best I can
Punched in the face
I'm glad it ended before it began

You lied to us all
You weren't truthful to yourself
