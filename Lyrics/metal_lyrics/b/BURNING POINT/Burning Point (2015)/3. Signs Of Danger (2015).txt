Acid rain keeps falling
You gaze at the sky
(But) you don't know how many cry in pain

Have you ever wondered
Is there a guardian angel
Hearts of the world shout her name

But it's hard to survive
When you're fighting against the odds
Evil descending from the sky

Signs of danger
Filled the sky in the night
Guardian angel
Take the hell from our lives

No turning back the endless time
Attack of the demons living
Houses made of concrete and blood

Now it's time to break the spell
Stop this evil madness
And send them back to hell
