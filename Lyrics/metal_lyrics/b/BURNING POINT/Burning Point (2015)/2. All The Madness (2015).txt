Into the new horizon
I gaze with my eyes open wide

My heart is lonely
I need a new way of life

Am I the last survivor
From these ruins, someone called "life"

What's beyond, it's my future

I rise from the ashes
And tomorrow I want to be gone
I want to stand proud and strong
But the memory still remains

Just a war, nothing more, all the madness
It's the end of the human race
Too deep in sorrow and sadness

I see the sun is rising
Uncovers the remnants of war
My heart is bleeding

I rise from the ashes
And tomorrow I want to be gone
I want to stand proud and strong
But the memory still remains

Just a war, nothing more, all the madness
It's the end of the human race
Too deep in sorrow and sadness

Just a war, nothing more, all the madness
Your voice is lost in the endless game
Too deep in sorrow and sadness
