Face to face
With your demons and alone
Fall from grace
The future is fading away

You pass the blame
And hide from the truth
Just a walking shame
Actions speak louder than your words

Say, say what you mean
Mean what you say
Don't turn away deceiver
Never played by the rules
Treated us like fools
We left you there in the shadows

Be a man and stand your ground
But you can't, you choose to be
A coward and a liar

Crawl back
To the bed you made yourself
Battle test
And you failed to stand in line

Acting like a victim
When the plot is thickening
Run and hide!
The answer is there
Take your time and stare at
All the corners of your soul
