[originally by Kiss]How many times have they lied
With the truth in their eyes
Treat you like dirt, wasting the days of our lives
They try and deny it,
Ain't gonna buy it, just look around
Before it's all over, it's gonna get rough

I've had enough -

(Out of the cold into the fire)
Nothing and no one is stopping me now
(Out of the cold into the fire)
Just hang tough and we'll make it somehow

How many times have you given up more than you got
Countin' on things turnin' out, but you know they will not
Ain't gonna take it, kick it and break it, just look around
Before it's all over it's gonna get rough

(Out of the cold into the fire)
Nothing and no one is stopping me now
(Out of the cold into the fire)
Just hang tough and we'll make it somehow

Wishin' and hopin' won't get you nothin'
Prayin' and schemin', no time for dreamin'
I've got the power, this is the hour now
Wishin' and hopin' won't get you nothin'
Prayin' and schemin', no time for dreamin'
I've got the power, this is the hour now

(Out of the cold into the fire)
Nothing and no one is stopping me now
(Out of the cold into the fire)
Just hang tough and we'll make it somehow
