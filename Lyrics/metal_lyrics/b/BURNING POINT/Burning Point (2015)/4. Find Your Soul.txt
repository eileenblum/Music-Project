Action is long overdue
Deed is not done
We're waiting
Anticipating

We've reached the end of the line
Now it's the time to search from within
Be humble and confess your sins

Find your soul
Embrace the light
Just push back the endless night
Journey through mind
Carry the torch through the falling rain

Interference in the balance of peace
Fragmented stories of truth and lies
It's your disguised

Unavoidable casualty of war
Step out the line and you'll burn in the fire
You crumble and lose your desire

Find your soul
Embrace the light
Just push back the endless night
Journey through mind
Carry the torch through the falling rain

Find your soul
The power within
Fire up the flames and you will win
Journey through mind
Carry the torch through the falling rain

[Solo]

Find your soul
Embrace the light
Just push back the endless night
Journey through mind
Carry the torch through the falling rain

Find your soul
The power within
Fire up the flames and you will win
Journey through mind
Carry the torch through the endless pain
