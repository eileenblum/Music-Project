Rising from the shadows
The walls are about the fall
Fully armed to battle
And I'm standing tall

Through the storm and lightning
The war rages on
Our lines are tightening
We are answering the call

Burn away all the evil from the past
Stay away, the sky is about to crack!

I am here and you will see
I'm the one, eternally
This is what my heart desires
Standing tall, one for all
I am never gonna crawl
This is me the queen of fire

Intoxicated from the miracles of life
Emancipated from all the strifes

Searched and rescued
My soul is finally free
Found the refuge
Hear my battle scream!

Battle lines are drawn
Master plan will be revealed
United we march, side by side
Let's celebrate the victory
