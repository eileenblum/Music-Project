You're the worst I've seen
One without a conscience
I've had enough of your kinds
Conducting symphony
With your stick held up high
Repeatedly your dreams
End up in a nightmare

Denying evil is the start of it all

Concept of loyalty
Is a total stranger
When you're reaching
To the higher grounds
Burning bridges
Leave the past behind you
Disregarding morality
Ends up in disaster...

Denying evil is the start of it all

It's the dawn of the ancient war
No retreat, no surrender
It's the dawn of the ancient war
No looking back...
The violence just begun...

Diminished capacity
Of the brain activity
Lacking respect towards another
Counting hits I laugh
You'll never achieve it
Repeatedly your dreams
End up in a nightmare
