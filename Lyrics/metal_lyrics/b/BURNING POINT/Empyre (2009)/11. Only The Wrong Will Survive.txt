You act like a king of 1000 dreams
The superstar of mankind

You're blocking my view
You're not worth the pain
The chances are few
Still you drive me insane

Masters of mediocrity
The rulers of the world

You're blocking my view
You're not worth the pain
The chances are few
Still you drive me insane

Always, why is it always
Only the wrong will survive
No change, there is no change
Only the wrong will survive

To the eyes of the world
You're nowhere in sight
Who's the ruler of mankind

From the start to the end
This world I make believe
My wound do not mend
I'm going insane

Always, why is it always
Only the wrong will survive
No change, there is no change
Only the wrong will survive

Wings of fire burn down my nightmare
Endless desire will keep my flame...
Keep my flame alive

Always, why is it always
Only the wrong will survive
No change, there is no change
Only the wrong will survive
