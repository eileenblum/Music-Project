Watch your own reflection
Force yourself to see
You are not your only enemy
Look behind the mirror
See behind the lie
Feel the pain and let it multiply

So many nightmares that are real
They are alive
Don't let them set your soul on fire

Sacrifice your love and hate
Sacrifice your heart
See the meaning of your fate
Tear your world apart

Fly down from your heaven
Climb up from your hell
Realize, it's your own soul to sell
Melt the ice around you
Hold your torches high
Feel the power, let it come to life

So many nightmares that are real
They are alive
Don't let them set your soul on fire

Sacrifice your love and hate
Sacrifice your heart
See the meaning of your fate
Tear your world apart
