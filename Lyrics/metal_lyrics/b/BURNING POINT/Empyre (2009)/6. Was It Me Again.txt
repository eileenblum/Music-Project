I build a wall
Impossible to climb
My hands are sore
From the times I have tried

It's no easy thing
For me to pour my heart
But it's a necessity
Or we're drifting apart

There are times that I've been wrong
And maybe the words came out too strong

Was it me again, I blame myself
For the pain I put you through
It's always the same
Always the rain, it comes down hard...
Was it me again

I have tried and failed
But still I'm coming back for more
It's a relief to see
That I'm not rotten to the core

There are times that I've been wrong
And maybe the words came out too strong

Was it me again, I blame myself
For the pain I put you through
It's always the same
Always the rain, it comes down hard...
You can't see the tears from all the fears
That have burned inside my soul
I'm not unkind but I'm hurt inside
I just can't tell... was it me again

Between the walls of this unholy church
I open the doors and the evil emerge...
