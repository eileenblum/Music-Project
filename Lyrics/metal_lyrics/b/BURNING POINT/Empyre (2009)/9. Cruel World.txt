Silent place of emptiness
Like through eyes of a drunken man
Quiet thoughts, peaceful mind
It's so strange, feels like I'm fine

I can't hear that noisy world
Can't see the smoke of my inner burn
Feels like I'm a reborn again
Like my soul is almost unbroken

Cold darkness of night
Why can't I stay in the light
When I finally can
Continue my journey to the unholy land

I this world I cannot stay
Soon I have to go away
I wish I could open the door
And make this cruel world
Exist no more

Song of sorrow, song of my life
I can see tears in the drunken men's eyes
There are so many destinies
So many broken hearted stories

Through the silence I found a way
To drown sorrow and make pain go away
Finally I can set myself free
Of this sadness and misery

Cold darkness of night
Why can't I stay in the light
When I finally can
Continue my journey to the unholy land

I this world I cannot stay
Soon I have to go away
I wish I could open the door
And make this cruel world
Exist no more

No one can take this pain away from me
Flames of my life burned too fast
My spirit climbs high and now it flies free

I this world I cannot stay
Soon I have to go away
I wish I could open the door
And make this cruel world
Exist no more
