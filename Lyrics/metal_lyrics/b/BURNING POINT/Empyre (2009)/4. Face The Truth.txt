No one cares what you say or do
So why even bother
It's all clear now, no room for two
We have to turn against each other

Scorch the land
Remember my name

Deny me, ignore me, refuse me
But face the truth
Bow down before me, deny me
And face the truth

Beneath the surface the beast awaits
To be released to the world
On a judgement days we storm the gates
With powers you've never heard

Deny me, ignore me, refuse me
But face the truth
Bow down before me, deny me
And face the truth

Scorch the land
Remember my name

No one cares what you say or do
So why even bother
It's all clear now, no room for two
We have to turn against each other

Scorch the land
Remember my name

Deny me, ignore me, refuse me
But face the truth
Bow down before me, deny me
And face the truth
