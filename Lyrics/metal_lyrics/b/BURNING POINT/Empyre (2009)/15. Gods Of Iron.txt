[bonus track]
[Originally by Running Wild]

Shrill screaming sirens are calling
The branded victims to death
A sacrifice to the Gods of iron
Everybody is joining the mass

The blinded multitude is screaming
The defenseless victim is killed
Pools of blood are screaming
The tribute to the Gods is fulfilled

Slavery to all are rebellious
It's a venture if you resist
Hu, challenged rulers of the universe
All under their merciless fist

But fight them as long as you can
Or they hunt you until you are dead
But stand up and fight for freedom
So free the slaves from all dread

Detain and destroy the Gods of iron
Fight them before it's too late
Guard yourself from their defying
Stand up and don't hesitate

Shrill screaming sirens are calling
The branded victims to death
A sacrifice to the Gods of iron
Everybody is joining the mass

The blinded multitude is screaming
The defenseless victim is killed
Pools of blood are screaming
The tribute to the Gods is fulfilled

Detain and destroy the Gods of iron
Fight them before it's too late
Guard yourself from their defying
Stand up and don't hesitate

Detain and destroy the Gods of iron
Fight them before it's too late
Guard yourself from their defying
Stand up and don't hesitate
