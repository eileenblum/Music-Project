Should I do that, did I say it like it was
Who's in the shadows, who will count the costs
Perfect balance between hell and paradise
Who dipped the scale, who will be the sacrificed

I don't need no excuses to throw you out
The pressure is off without a doubt

Stuck in between...
Evil whirlwind
And a manic merry-go-round
Like you haven't seen
Evil whirlwind
And a manic merry-go-round

Why leave it halfway, just dump me when you've done
My mind is lost, did someone block the sun
No more tears, I've done all that I can
But it's not over, have I failed the master plan?

I don't need no excuses to throw you out
The pressure is off without a doubt

Stuck in between...
Evil whirlwind
And a manic merry-go-round
Like you haven't seen
Evil whirlwind
And a manic merry-go-round
