March to the sound of the pied piper
Hypnotized by the power it will bring

Push aside the human behaviour
Take the place reserved for you in the ring

Do this, don't do that, don't act against the orders
Never too late to be bad but no crossing the borders

One by one we march to the beat
Of enchanted drums
Come join the fool's parade
One by one we march to the beat
Of enchanted drums
Let's join the fool's parade

Over-powered by the false messiah
Rational mind falls into oblivion

Do this, don't do that, don't act against the orders
Never too late to be bad but no crossing the borders

One by one we march to the beat
Of enchanted drums
Come join the fool's parade
One by one we march to the beat
Of enchanted drums
Let's join the fool's parade
