The war is over but the battle's just begun
I met the devil's minion. It was case of hit and run
It was time to do or die...

Giving up to my demons, mistake that I won't do
Blinded by neon for a while I was a fool
But now we have built...

Brave new empyre
The untouchable, the unbreakable
Brave new empyre
Reaching new horizons
Storming with defiance

Am I to blame from your imperfection
It's truly a shame
You gained nothing from the lecture
And now it's all about

Brave new empyre
The untouchable, the unbreakable
Brave new empyre
Reaching new horizons
Storming with defiance
