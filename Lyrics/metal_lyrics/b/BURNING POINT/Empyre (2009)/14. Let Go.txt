[Originally by Q5]

In the darkest hour, tangled in despair
I looked around and I was dreaming
I walk the border of the other side
And all the time I heard a screaming

Let go... let go!
If you want to get back to the place you were at... let go!
Let go... let go!
If you tear at your heart
It will rip you apart... let go!

And in the mirror I saw a shining light
It beckoned me with distant hunger
A rage that's burning, consumed by itself
I couldn't stop it now or never

Let go... let go!
If you want to get back to the place you were at... let go!
Let go... let go!
Well he laughs at your pain
You've got nothing to gain... let go!

And when I woke up, I had a gun in my hand
I just can't do it, I want this dream to end

Let go... let go!
If you want to get back to the place you were at... let go!
Let go... let go!
If you tear at your heart
It will rip you apart... let go!

Let go... let go!
If you want to get back to the place you were at... let go!
Let go... let go!
Well he laughs at your pain
You've got nothing to gain... let go!

Let go... let go!

If you open your mind
See what you find... let go!
