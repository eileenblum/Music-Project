Hey you, what's your name?
Never mind, to me it's all the same
May I rest, I'm feeling tired

Last in line, first in the fire
I was caught between temptation and desire
May I rest, I'm feeling tired

Between these walls of stone
A place I call home

Is that a smile on your face
Or just distorted image filled with hate
You can't hide the pain
It reflects from you

So cold, blood in your veins
Break me and you'll be crushed by shame
I can't hide the pain that reflects from you

...No more playing with my desire
Leave me and I'll be free
So cold, the one who stole the fire...
