You try to burn the witches, from day to day you moralize
You cried the wolf but now it's catching you
There are no more excuses, no guardian angels for the damned
You drink the poison from the cup of gold

All the towers falling down
Your crying can't be heard no more
Your lies won't set you free

Eyes open wide â you're blinded by the darkness
Eyes open wide â you're blinded by the darkness

With your own eyes you saw the signs
You read them all across the skies
None of them did stand for victory
The double-talking false attacks and the stabbing
Of the backs never got you where you wanted to go
