On my way to the promised land
I got lost in the sidetrack
Demons &amp; angels
Envy &amp; hatred paved the way

Search and rescue the enemy
Consequences from my aim to please
Destiny's calling, wielding &amp; holding the
Two-edged blade

Under the Fire
I stand, I crawl, I die
Under the ageless burning fire

Sign my name under the cross
Glorious
Sign my name under the cross
Glorious â Victorious... Holier Than Thou

Tools of war in my hands
Tame the mutiny, make demands
Feeding &amp; bleeding, always receding away
From pain

Under the Fire
I stand, I crawl, I die
I'm crucified
I rise, I fall, I cry
Under the Fire
I laugh, I weep, I lie
Under the ageless burning Fire

Rest in peace, leave me be,
the fighting goes on
Say a prayer, avoid stare of eternity
