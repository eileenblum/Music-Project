Temptation takes over
Forcing me to speak against my will
Denying the demon
Doesn't protect you from its skills

Oblivion beckons me, diving to its lap
I'm sinking deeper and deeper in to black
Wishing and waiting that...
Someone would free me

My Everdream
Shifting the worlds
My Everdream
And I won't look back

Freedom is waiting
Landscapes of peace and harmony
Monster is screaming
Wearing the suit of reality

On fire, reality's burning my soul
With the desire
I'm fighting to reach my goals

My Everdream
Bound to be free
My Everdream
And I won't look back
