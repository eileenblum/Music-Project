Passion runs deep
Like a fuel to the flames
Burning its way to be free

Lake of desire
Surging with dreams
Shores of the damned torch my soul

All the way until the end
We never break we never bend

Darkness of time
Won't crush mighty will
Absence of light makes it strong

Fenching your wealth
Attracts thiefs in the night
Fire at will shoot on sight

Warrior's soul, brave from the heart
Restless and wild, we never break apart

Eternal flame
Burns forever
Eternal flame
Salvation will come
