[Bonus Track]Blood is persistent no matter what
Relentless forever

Burst of existence I will not stop
Ruthless endeavours

Refuse to be
The last in line
Refuse to see
The end of times

The gates are wide open
The flood rushes in
Unstoppable nature
Edge of darkness, threshold of pain
Calling all stations

Refuse to be
The last in line
Refuse to see
The end of times

Give me freedom, confess your sins
The search is over, the blood will win
