[Bonus Track]Spoiled to the bone
Priceless to the world that surrounds you

Vicious and alone
Minions without fate, shining in your mercy

Turning your head like a wheel
Souls of the damned you will steal

Ice Queen â Ice Queen
Keeps the fools in control
Ice Queen â Ice Queen
Dreams are not yours anymore

Lurking in the dark
Seeing and capturing every moment
Raise up your guard
Walls of ignorance don't protect you
