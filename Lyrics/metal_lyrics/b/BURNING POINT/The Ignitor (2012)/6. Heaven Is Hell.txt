What seems to be wrong
Am I twisting the noose too strong?
Just try to hold on, I'll never let go

Playing with fire
Can't you see what is best for you?
Living a lie, you don't follow the rules

Go for the throat
Go for the throat
We will never fall

Heaven is hell
Promises turned to dust
Heaven is hell
Without fear we will fight...
Till the end of time

Endurance of pain
Growing stronger day by day
Cold and strange
Is the way of your world

Turning the tide
Stepping off from the fool's parade
Emotions run wild
Shadows fading away
