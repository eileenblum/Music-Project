Imagine the world without you
Better or worse,
What will it be in the end?

Sleepwalking in a daydream
Waking up in a middle of a scream

And the nightmare closes in
Merging two worlds in my mind

In the night
Memories holding me tight
In the night
Secrets pushing the light... Away

Turning circles in square one
Surrender to the power of unknown
Drain the tears to the pool of my mistakes
Face the fears, descend from the skies

Aiming higher,
My feet don't touch the ground
Soul's on fire, it's lost and never found
