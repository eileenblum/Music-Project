We fed the flames of illusion
Still keep coming back for more
Realized the conclusion
We're here to settle the score

Building empire of madness
We manage to survive
Rising up from the ashes
The game of conquer,
Conquer &amp; divide

We are here to feed the tire
Time after time
The keepers of the burning pyre
Night after night
(The Ignitor comes)

Heaven turning to hatred
Was the plan all along?
Nothing is sacred
Throne of chaos,
Falling down so strong
