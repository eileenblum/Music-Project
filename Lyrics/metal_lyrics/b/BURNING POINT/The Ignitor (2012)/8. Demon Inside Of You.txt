Down, down on my knees
My wounds still bleed
Numb for all the pain
This vicious game paralyzes my heart &amp; soul

Curse, curse of the past
Tides turn so fast
Rules, so many rules
Obey the fool and you're lost
Inside your mind forever
You're a prisoner

Crush my heart
Tear my soul to pieces
Burn my fate
There's a demon inside of you
Crush my will
To live forever
Build a storm
There's a demon inside of you

Insane, you were insane
You pass the blame
Rules, so many rules
Obey the fool and you're lost
Inside your mind forever
You're a prisoner
