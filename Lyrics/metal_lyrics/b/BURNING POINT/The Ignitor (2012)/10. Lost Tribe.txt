Heart of a lion beating hard and heavy
To the beat of the brotherhood
No words left unspoken
No chains won't hold us down
Passion's strong, we stand our ground

Neverending the desire that burns
The vision we must conserve

Woooaaah, The Lost Tribe
Woooaaah, Freedom's Call
Woooaaah, The Lost Tribe
Woooaaah, Standing Tall

Spirit of a warrior
Stands the test of time
Dominate the future and the past
Never undermine the sanctity
Of a soul that's breaking free
Never turn your back
To your fellow man
