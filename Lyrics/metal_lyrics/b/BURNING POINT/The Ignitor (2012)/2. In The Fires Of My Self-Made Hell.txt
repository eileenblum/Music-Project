I got my limitations
I'm a friend of pain
I'm afraid your expectations
Will drive me insane

Crawlspace of a different kind
Deep in the heart of a twisted mind

I'm burning, I'm turning
In the fires of my self-made hell
I'm crying, I'm bleeding
In the fires of my self-made hell

I'm human incompletely
I'm no better man
I promise very weakly
To do the best I can
