All across the land
Castles built with sand, they're drowning

Pain has gone away
Sorrow's here to stay, still I'm not learning

Impossible to dream
Hide behind the scream, I'm dying

Hand in hand with the master of it all
Someone calls out my name

Minutes turning to hours, hours turning to days
I am losing sleep
Minutes turning to hours.
hours turning to days
I got my promises to keep

Distance closing in
Devotion starts to dim, it hurts me

Unfold the secret sins
Determination wins, it suits me

Eye to eye with master of it all
Will you call out my name
