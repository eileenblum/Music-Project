Drifting aimlessly
Crossing the lines
Meeting constantly
The traveler of time

Outside the walls of endless pain
The master awaits

Silent screams in the heart of night
Haunting me, echoing in my mind
Silent screams in the dead of the night
Whispering, running free in my lonely
and restless mind

Something died inside
Something was born
Learning to survive
Trying to be strong

Outside the walls of endless pain
I will be free

Can't you see me?
Are you able to hear my voice?
Get away from me
You don't leave me no choice
