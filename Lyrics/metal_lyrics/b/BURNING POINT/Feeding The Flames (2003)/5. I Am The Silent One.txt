I'm so tired day after day,
I pretend I'm awake
I've been losing sleep
Balancing in between,
dream and this cold world

Helplessly trying to keep
Little bit of my sanity
sand's running out of my hourglass
Quietly I start to wait the burning hate
And now I hear it calling my name

[Pre-Chorus]

Through the darkness and pouring rain
I fight my battles all alone
Descending blackness the source of my pain
Once again my fears start to rise

[Chorus]

Walls of stone
Between shadows and my dark desiress

Walls of stone
Keep this pain inside my mind

Faceless friends of mine
In this space and time
Couldn't read my warning sign
Push me over the edge it's too late to beg
'cos now it's too far gone

[Pre-Chorus]

Through the darkness and pouring rain
I fight my battles all alone
Descending blackness the source of my pain
Once again my fears start to rise

[Chorus]

Walls of stone
Between shadows and my dark desiress

Walls of stone
Keep this pain inside my mind

No life to live
I always stayed alone...
Save Us...
It's judgement day
I don't have to wait anymore

I am the silent one.

[Solo - Pete]

[Chorus]
