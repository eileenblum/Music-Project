No true emotions, (but) you jump into the fire
Disease without a cure

The lack of wisdom (you're) driven by a desire
Straight down to hell you're lured

All hopes and dreams flattened by real life
Stray bullet, forever?

Learning from the lessons (but) it's not your way of life
Straight down to hell you're lured

[Chorus]

Like castles of sand
Lost and lonely man

Washed away with the tide
New dawn without pride

No one can blame you, endlessly you'll try
Attention! I want it, I need it!

The truth is there, open up your blurry eyes
Straight down to hell you're lured!!

[Chorus]

Like castles of sand
Lost and lonely man

Washed away with the tide
New dawn without pride

(You) act like a damned
Lost and lonely man

Wiped away with the rain
You try to stay sane

(but) you're longing for something not there

[Solo - Pete]

[Chorus]
