Denying the existence, out of sight - out of mind
Far in the distance, no one to find
Powered by visions, picking up the best from the lines
In future decisions, make sure that you are deaf and blind

History's the future, they convince you to stay
(when your) feelings are mutual, you're on the way
Death to the false gods, their guiding light
(but) without the heart, you are destined to fight

[Pre-Chorus]

From the cradle to the grave ( they force feed you )
Mediocrity to blame ( if not the chosen one )

[Chorus]

Obey the orders from high above
Words that blackened the sun
(until the death you must fight)

Soldiers be ready to march
Under the cold moon and stars
(until the death you must fight)

Hungry and restless, are the soldiers ready to fight
Nameless and faceless, without wrong or right
Words are deceiving, if they come from those who rule
If you don't know the meaning of hope then you are doomed

[Pre-Chorus]

From the cradle to the grave ( they force feed you )
Mediocrity to blame ( if not the chosen one )

[Chorus]

Obey the orders from high above
Words that blackened the sun
(until the death you must fight)

Soldiers be ready to march
Under the cold moon and stars
(until the death you must fight)

Dying dream of a lonely man,
Consequensies were too much to bear

Visionaire extraordinaire
Morbid plans in the end were destined to fail

[Solo - Pete]

[Chorus]
