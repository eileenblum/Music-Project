Don't ask me no questions,
and I tell you no lies
Ignorance is a bliss

Secrets of my life could light up the sky
And bring pain like a Judas' kiss

[Pre-Chorus]

You don't have to know me
My actions won't be explained
But you're destined to tear me ...apart

[Chorus]

Into the Fire     You put me through hell
Twisted Desire    in the world of Orwell
Total Control               of body and mind
...into the fire

Impervious to reason , you don't hear a word
(you just) emphasize the power of rules

I am wrong doing right, you turn black into white
To you we are just ignorant fools

[Pre-Chorus]

You don't have to know me
My actions won't be explained
But you're destined to tear me ...apart

[Chorus]

Into the Fire     You put me through hell
Twisted Desire    in the world of Orwell
Total Control               of body and mind
...into the fire

Into the Fire but I'm not alone
Thousands of us chained to our homes
Total Control of body and mind
...into the fire

[Solo - Pete]

[Chorus]
