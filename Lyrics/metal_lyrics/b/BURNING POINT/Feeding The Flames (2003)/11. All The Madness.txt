Into the new horizon
I gaze with my eyes open wide

My heart is lonely
I need a new way of life

Am I the last survivor
From these ruins, someone called "life"

What's beyond, it's my future
I rise from the ashes , and tomorrow I want to be gone

[Pre-Chorus]

I want to stand proud and strong,
But the memory still remains

[Chorus]

Just a war, nothing more, all the madness
It's the end of the human race
Too deep in sorrow and sadness
(I want to get out of this place)

I see the sun is rising
Uncovers the remnants of war

My heart is bleeding
I rise from the ashes, and tomorrow I want to be gone

[Pre-Chorus]

I want to stand proud and strong,
But the memory still remains

[Chorus]

Just a war, nothing more, all the madness
It's the end of the human race
Too deep in sorrow and sadness
(I want to get out of this place)

Just a War, nothing more, all the madness
Your voice is lost in the endless game
Too deep in sorrow and sadness
(I want to get out of this place )

[Solo - Pete]

[Chorus]

Just a war, nothing more, all the madness
It's the end of the human race
Too deep in sorrow and sadness
(I want to get out of this place)

Just a War, nothing more, all the madness
Your voice is lost in the endless game
Too deep in sorrow and sadness
(I want to get out of this place )
All The Madness - Sorrow and Sadness...
