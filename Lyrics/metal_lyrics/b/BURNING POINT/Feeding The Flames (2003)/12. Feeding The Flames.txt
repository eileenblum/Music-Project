Escape before the Others
Search for privacy, make a change
Close the door, without a sound
Hallucinations, I have my doubts

[Pre-Chorus]

I miss the silence of (the) life
when I heard the waves hit the shore

I lye awake in my cell
Wish to escape from this hell
Master plan, to run to the east
Finally, I was hiding the beast

[Pre-Chorus]

I miss the silence of (the) life
I was never alone...

Prisoner inside my own mind
I need to get whole control

[Chorus]

Face to face , with the remains of my past
Scars so deep, my soul will keep.
The bridge I never passed

But some day, once again I will reign
Wounds so deep,but my soul will be,
Feeding the Flames

Falling, I am falling, I hear the calling...
Oblivion.
Drowning, I am drowning, I see the black light...
Have to fight or disappear.
Deeper, sinking deeper, into world of...
Insanity
Fighting, I am Fighting, No surrender,
I won't give in Oblivion

[Solo - Pete]

Resurrection of evil
I try to hide before your eyes
Promises so hollow
Couldnt help my inner peace

[Pre-Chorus]

I miss the silence of (the) life
I was never alone...
Prisoner inside my own mind
I need to get whole control

[Chorus]

Face to face , with the remains of my past
Scars so deep, my soul will keep.
The bridge I never passed

But some day, once again I will reign
Wounds so deep,but my soul will be,
Feeding the Flames
