Between valleys, I drown in deepest seas
I'm on the edge of forever

Lost in the twilight, collision of darkness and light
A new day dawning, it's time to fight

[Pre-Chorus]

Enchanting voices won't leave me be
Throwing me choices, making future so hard to see

[Chorus]

Voice from the past
Forever lasts
On and on it echoes in me

I've been there done that, the story of my life
I need an extension, in my bloodline

I wish upon a star, but it comes crashing down
I am lost and never found

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo - Pete]

[Chorus]
