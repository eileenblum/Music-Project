In the realm of shadows
Where limits unbound

He searched the worlds
Lost and found

Discovered the ways of eternal life
Walls of stone quaranteed the endless times

[Pre-Chorus]

He opened up the world of pain

Treat the loyal like dogs on leash
Loosen the rope and plant the seed of hope

Unearthly shine of your new world machine
Blinded your eyes and ended supremacy

[Pre-Chorus]

He opened up the world of pain
Life would never be the same

[Chorus]

It seemed to be like endless slavery
Day after day the resurrection machine

It seemed to be like endless slavery
Day after day the resurrection machine

He'll be trapped for all eternity
Still bonded to this disabled world

He is searching for serenity
Immortal soul, Immoral quest

[Solo - Jukka/Pete]
