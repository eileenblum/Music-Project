Falling ashes final warning
Signs of nature the blood red skies
Quiet rumble from the distance
Something strange something evil this way comes

[Pre-Chorus]

Descending from the sky
My choice, my master
Quicker than the eye
You should make your move faster
or die.

[Chorus]

Hear his scream across the crimson sky
As he gathered the demons around
He unleashed the desperate battle cry
as his minions were shot down in flames

He was standing on the holy ground
Thunder roaring, lightning a light the sky
Earth was trembling, heaven's on fire
Nature's forces the power that divide the night

[Pre-Chorus]

Descending from the sky
My choice, my master
Quicker than the eye
You should make your move faster
or die.

[Chorus]

Hear his scream across the crimson sky
As he gathered the demons around
He unleashed the desperate battle cry
as his minions were shot down in flames

[Solo - Pete]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Hear his scream across the crimson sky
As he gathered the demons around
He unleashed the desperate battle cry
as his minions were shot down in flames

Hear my call across the freezing north
Over the mountains and frozen streams
Winter ends the life too short
Still I dream to be forever free
