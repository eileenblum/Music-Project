Mesmerized by the ancient years
Despised leaders, empty but full of fear
...just let me leave

Scorched earth was the vision from the beginning to the end
Dare to question and you're surely enemy's sent
...they put you back in your place

[Chorus]

You try to hide it in the veil of a secrecy
No sense to fight it, better left as mysteries

Use the weak the defendless, the rules are in the book
For heaven's sake don't tell the truth
...don't cross the line

Brought darkness straight in our hearts
Guilt in the name of the Lord
...nothing remains the same

[Chorus]

You try to hide it in the veil of a secrecy
No sense to fight it, better left as mysteries

[Solo - Jukka/Pete]

Lesson learned, but the pain is still within
Second coming, what might it bring?
...you sealed our fate (faith?)

The gate is open, but unwanted we are,
Although we travelled so far
...not the chosen ones?

[Chorus]

[Solos - Pete]
