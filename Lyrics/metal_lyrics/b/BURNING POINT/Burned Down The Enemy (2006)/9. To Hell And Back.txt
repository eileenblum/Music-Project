[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

Between you and us there is no love lost
Curtains that fell revealing your private hell
You cheat and you steal no compassion you feel
Feeble minded bloodsucker suffer... and burn

We leave you behind and the parasite will die
and the neon lights will fade away
You mastered your craft please, don`t make me laugh
Simple minded bloodsucker suffer and burn

[BRIDGE]
Countdown has started
you`ll never win, we never lose
You`re so blackhearted
you`re the king of the fools

[CHORUS]
To hell and back - To hell and back
We survived through it all
To hell and back - To hell and back
We survived through it all, You`ll be destined to fall...

You`ve awakened the beast you`re last in line, you`re the least
You`re no stranger at all just a loser about to fall
You cheat and you steal no compassion you feel
Simple minded bloodsucker suffer and burn

[BRIDGE]
Countdown has started
you`ll never win, we never lose
You`re so blackhearted
you`re the king of the fools

[CHORUS]
To hell and back - To hell and back
We survived through it all
To hell and back - To hell and back
You`ll be destined to fall
To hell and back - To hell and back
We survived through it all, You`ll be destined to fall...

[SOLO / Pete]
