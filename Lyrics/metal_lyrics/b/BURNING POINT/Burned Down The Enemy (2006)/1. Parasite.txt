[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

So vicious inside you`re like rats in the underworld
No places to hide there`s no shelters you`re looking for

[BRIDGE]
We`ll condemned you to hell you will burn in our fire
You`re nothing like humans you`re no more than a liar
Your ass will be nailed to the crusifix of the truth
We`re safe from your lies WE`RE METAL you`re just a fool

[BRIDGE]
We`ll condemned you to hell you will burn in our fire
You`re nothing like humans you`re no more than a liar

[CHORUS]
Neon parasite -- just crawl back to your hole
Evil and so blind - you can`t tell the difference of the right and wrong...

You denied all the facts, you`re just crumbling in the dark
We`ll show you some light, we will leave our mark

[BRIDGE]
We`ll condemned you to hell you will burn in our fire
You`re nothing like humans you`re no more than a liar

[CHORUS]
Neon parasite -- just crawl back to your hole
Evil and so blind - you can`t tell the difference of the right and wrong...

[SOLO / Pete / Pekka / Pete]
