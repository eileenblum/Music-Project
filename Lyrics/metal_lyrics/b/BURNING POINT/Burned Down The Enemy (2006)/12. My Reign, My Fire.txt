[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

Could it be the saviour who`ll get you out of here
(but) it turned out as a failure, the core , your biggest fear...

Words can be so fatal, you`re reaching much too far
Silence in the graveyard, it`s nothing and it`s all

[BRIDGE]
It all was gone in a moment
Tragically you lost all to me...

Finish what you`ve started, I`ve been teached to act
You live your life so guarded , it`s so true and sad...

[BRIDGE]
It all was gone in a moment
Tragically you lost all to me...

[CHORUS]
My reign, My fire
I`m claiming the throne It belongs to me ( It belongs to me )
My reign, My fire
and finally it`s the end of tyranny, misery, we all see....

[SOLO / Pekka]

[BRIDGE]
It all was gone in a moment
Tragically you lost all to me...

[CHORUS]
My reign, My fire
The kingdom is mine It belongs to me ( It belongs to me )
My reign, My fire
and finally it`s the end of tyranny, misery, we all see...
My reign, My fire
I`m claiming the throne, this kingdom is mine, it belongs to me
My reign, My fire
and finally it`s the end of tyranny, misery, we all see....
