[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

I stood tall in this trial by fire
I survived it all
Chain is broken and my only desire
is to avoid the fall

[BRIDGE]
You`re leading, leading the cult of the damned
You`re feeding them right out of my hands

[CHORUS]
Against the madness of time
I finally killed the snakes in paradise
Against the madness of time
the search is over I `m out from the twilight

In too deep unable to escape
Haunted me in my sleep
Whats in it for me? you selfishly asked..
Your promises just try to keep

[BRIDGE]
You`re leading, leading the cult of the damned
You`re feeding them right out of my hands

[CHORUS]
Against the madness of time
I finally killed the snakes in paradise
Against the madness of time
the search is over I `m out from the twilight

Against the madness of time
I finally killed the serpents and the lies
Against the madness of time
the game is over I unveiled your disguise

...Sleepers awake now it`s time to pray
for the souls of the dying
The night after day it`s the bringer of pain
to the lonely souls that are crying...

[SOLO / Pete]

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
