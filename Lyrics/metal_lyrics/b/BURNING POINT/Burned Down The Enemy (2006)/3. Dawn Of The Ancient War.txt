[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

You`re the worst I`ve seen one without a conscience
I`ve had enough of your kinds
Conducting symphony with your stick held up high
repeatedly your dreams end up in a nightmare

[BRIDGE]
Denying evil is the start of it all...

Concept of loyalty is a total stranger
when you`re reaching to the higher grounds
Burning bridges leave the past behind you
disregarding morality ends up in disaster...

[BRIDGE]
Denying evil is the start of it all...

[CHORUS]
It`s the dawn of the ancient war
no retreat, no surrender
It`s the dawn of the ancient war
no looking back...the violence just begun...

Diminished capacity of the brain activity
lacking respect towards another
Counting hits I laugh you`ll never achieve it
repeatedly your dreams end up in a nightmare

[BRIDGE]
Denying evil is the start of it all...

[CHORUS]
It`s the dawn of the ancient war
no retreat, no surrender
It`s the dawn of the ancient war
no looking back...the violence just begun...

[SOLO / Pete]
