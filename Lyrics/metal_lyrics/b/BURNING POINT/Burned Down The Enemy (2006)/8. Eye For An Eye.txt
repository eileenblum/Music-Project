[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

From the shadows you rose gave me a lethal doze
rip the heart of my chest and left me to die
Pointless arguments I dive in to the deep end
watching the world go by ...oh no...am I living in a lie...

[BRIDGE]
Do they hate me because of my sins
Won`t you save me from the evil within

[CHORUS]
Eye for an eye welcome to my world
It`s like the blind blind leading the blind
Eye for an eye haven`t you heard
It`s like the blind blind leading the blind
straight in to the heart of the night...

You say life ain`t fair , no one really cares
you put the blame on me and you walk away
Target at my sights too numb to even try
closing the pages, eternally, I stand back and watch your demise

[BRIDGE]
Saints will fall in to the sinners hands
If you want to crawl, I shout my demand

[CHORUS]
Eye for an eye welcome to my world
It`s like the blind blind leading the blind
Eye for an eye haven`t you heard
It`s like the blind blind leading the blind
straight in to the heart of the dark...

...Have mercy on me, I`m so tired as a man can be
I`m not the same as I was before
Where this path is leading me, I do not know, but I`m anxious to see
what the future holds for me...what the future holds for me... what is there
for me...

[SOLO / Pete]

[BRIDGE]
Do they hate me because of my sins
Won`t you save me from the evil within

[CHORUS X2]
Eye for an eye welcome to my world
It`s like the blind blind leading the blind
Eye for an eye haven`t you heard
It`s like the blind blind leading the blind
straight in to the heart of the night...
