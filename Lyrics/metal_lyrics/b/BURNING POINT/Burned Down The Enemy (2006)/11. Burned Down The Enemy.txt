[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

Losing grip of reality
Revolution in this brave new world
Glimpse of evil in the child's eye
Persecution begins to emerge

Salvation came in a form of fire
Torches lit across the lands
Feeding the hungry we kept the flames alive,
but our hourglass ran out of sand

[BRIDGE]
Face the truth, shut your mouth, calm the storm,
but if you want it all, WE ARE READY TO FIGHT
Dethrone tyranny ending supremacy, the quest for honour has begun....

Out of the barn hoarsely spoken man
claims he owns our fire
Crawl back to your hole you`re not from this world
YouÂ´re not the kind I admire

[BRIDGE]
Face the truth, shut your mouth, calm the storm,
but if you want it all, WE ARE READY TO FIGHT
Dethrone tyranny ending supremacy, the quest for honour has begun....

[CHORUS]
Host of palace in the dark
In silence lies the victim, we BURNED DOWN THE ENEMY
Out of the belly of this beast
We`re back in the light, we BURNED DOWN THE ENEMY
and we burned the evil past....we`re second to none we`re here to last...

... And now the battle is done and the war is over
all the heroes unsung join with me in the praise of glory
Only the ones with pure heart they survive, they`ll stand victorious
It`s up to us to kill the beast once and for all...

...This ship of fools is sailing without a course
the captain is changing and he`s taking new force
and now we head out to the new seas...

[SOLO / Pete / Pekka / Jussi/ Pekka / Pete]

[BRIDGE]
Face the truth, shut your mouth, calm the storm,
but if you want it all, WE ARE READY TO FIGHT
Dethrone tyranny ending supremacy, the quest for honour has begun....

[CHORUS]
Host of palace in the dark
In silence lies the victim, we BURNED DOWN THE ENEMY
Out of the belly of this beast
We`re back in the light, we BURNED DOWN THE ENEMY

Host of palace in the dark
You have played with fire, we BURNED DOWN THE ENEMY
Out of the belly of this beast
We are ready to fight, we BURNED DOWN THE ENEMY
and we burned the evil past....we`re second to none we`re here to last...

WE BURNED DOWN THE ENEMY!!
