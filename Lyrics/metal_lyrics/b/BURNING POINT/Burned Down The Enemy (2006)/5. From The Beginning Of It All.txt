[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

Desperately searching for the one who could heal the wounds
...but no one to be found...
Nowhere to turn always on the run it`s a game I could only lose

[BRIDGE]
I thought of the better days, but you shot me down in flames
In so many ways I denied my shame...

[CHORUS]
From the beginning of it all - I was too blind to see your lies
From the beginning of it all - I should`ve seen through your disguise...

Needed the distance, could not get away, do you believe me
...oh no you don`t
Equal to none in this pain I feel so deep inside

[BRIDGE]
I thought of the better days, but you shot me down in flames
In so many ways I denied my shame...

[CHORUS]
From the beginning of it all - I was too blind to see your lies
From the beginning of it all - I should`ve seen through your disguise...

[SOLO / Pete]
