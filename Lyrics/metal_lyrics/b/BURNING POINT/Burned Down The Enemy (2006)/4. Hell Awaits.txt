[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

You`re so condescending there`s no way I`ll be bending down,
down with your rules
Two worlds colliding I`ll be rewriting your future
and the victory is mine

[BRIDGE]
Say what you say it doesn`t mean anything
Play what you play, but in the end I will take it all...

[CHORUS]
Hell awaits when you`re near me
Hell awaits if you try to deceive me believe me I`m breaking you down

Sucking out all the lifeblood in the end there`s no rivals
standing alone on the field
Actions speak louder than words ever will,
but you`re not wise enough to understand the truth

[BRIDGE]
Say what you say it doesn`t mean anything
Play what you play, but in the end I will take it all...

[CHORUS]
Hell awaits when you`re near me
Hell awaits just try to deceive me

Hell awaits when you`re near me
Hell awaits if you try to deceive me believe me I`m breaking you down

[SOLO / Pete]

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
