[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

Pain... welcomes me on it`s daily show
Forcing me to take the hardest of the roads

Helpless... I will be as my energy running low
I can`t see nothing more just the pain I feel

...Save me....

[CHORUS]
THE COLDNESS OF THIS WORLD
THE CRIES ARE NEVER HEARD, I`M ICEBOUND
THIS ISOLATED WORLD
WHERE EVER I WILL TURN , I`M ICEBOUND

My mind breaks I`m giving up to the endless black
I feel unsafe and the feeling grows there`s no returning back

...Save me...

[CHORUS]
THE COLDNESS OF THIS WORLD
THE CRIES ARE NEVER HEARD, I`M ICEBOUND
THIS ISOLATED WORLDs
WHERE EVER I WILL TURN, I`M ICEBOUND

... Spark of light in the morning makes me think of the better days
God of the sun the one I`m calling clear the sky and let me live...again...

[SOLO / Pete / Pekka / Pete]

[CHORUS]
