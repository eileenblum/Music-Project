[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

Storm approaching I can feel it coming
and soon it`s past the point of no return

Read between the lines there`s a thunder roaming
and I`m giving in to the urge to tame the land

[BRIDGE]
I feel the waves rushing in...
Every second counts and every passing minute, the hour is here...

[CHORUS]
Deceiver -- Mistreater
Deceiver -- Mistreater

Blind to the truth there is no believing
doublecrossed me from the very start

Endless thirst for blood hunger grows inside me
you will get what you deserve

[BRIDGE]
I feel the waves rushing in...
Every second counts and every passing minute, the hour is here...

[CHORUS]
Deceiver -- Mistreater
Deceiver -- Mistreater

[SOLO / Pete]

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
