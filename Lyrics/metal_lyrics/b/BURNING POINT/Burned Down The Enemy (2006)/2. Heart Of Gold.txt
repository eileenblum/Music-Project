[Music&amp;Lyrics / P. Ahonen]

I hear the voice calling out my name
without a choice I have to live with this pain...deep inside

I see myself as an image of the hurt
I locked you out....will I ever learn...
will I ever learn...?

[BRIDGE]
Stranger came - it brought me to my knees
Devil`s game -- another day is deceased
Live or die - my options are growing short

[CHORUS]
The darkness reveals all it`s secrets to me
from this unknown land that no one has seen
The beast will arise from the depths of my soul
it`s the end of the Heart of gold

I sealed the fate when I try to ease the pain
and at the gates I bow my head down with a shame...I can`t take it
anymore...
Out of focus- reality`s swept away
Am I just a pawn -- in this devil`s play ...in this devil`s play

[BRIDGE]
Stranger came - it brought me to my knees
Devil`s game -- another day is deceased
Live or die - my options are growing short

[CHORUS X2]
The darkness reveals all it`s secrets to me
from this unknown land that no one has seen
The beast will arise from the depths of my soul
it`s the end of the Heart of gold

[SOLO / Pekka / Pete]

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
