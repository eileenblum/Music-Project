[Music: D.Bugeja O.Grech]
[Words: D.Bugeja]

Crawling down obscure passages in utter revulsion
Deeper into vaults of metaphysical interception
Radiant substances entrance this reign
Lucid visions projected from an impetuous brain

[Solo : David]

The scars that extinguished my will to be
I now behold before me
Past and present infuse become one
Hideously mutated, life's undone
As I wallow hollowly inside this torture
Through murky clouds of an adverse texture
Ghostly beings evolve out of nothingness
Despondent animations of embodied bitterness
Unbelievable sights - my eroded sanity is at stake
Within this timeless slumber there's no awake
Self-created purgatory - the peace I'll never find
Here my ravaged soul shall eternally be confined
Travelling deeper inside this lunatic domain
All signs of life wither as I drown in pain
Heedless of what shall dare decide my faith
For I've parted from a world I've learnt to hate
Tired of life I crave for another existence
Where flesh and bones no longer disturb my essence
Not knowing what encounters lie waiting for me
I commit myself to this painstaking journey

[Solo: David]

Hatred rages oozing from my bleeding soul
Washing away the anguish with a life full of woe
The scars and wounds that only time can heal
Soon I will no longer be able to see nor feel
Here is where my I now shall belong forevermore
Amid these astral walls with a new life to explore
Undisturbed for all eternity,
I'll procreate In a realm where no
God shall ever dominate
