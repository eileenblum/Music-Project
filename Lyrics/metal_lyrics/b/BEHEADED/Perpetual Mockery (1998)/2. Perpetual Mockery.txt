[Music: D.Bugeja O.Grech T.Fenech]
[Words: D.Bugeja]

Absorbed within this lunatic world
Premature lifes habitually misled
Messengers of a nihil belief
Dispel thoughts that deceive
Thriving on all weak identities
Devoted ones, abused subtlety
An inherited course of malice
Bestowed on those who share their chalice

[Chorus:]
Oblivious of own infirmities
To fade subserviently
Forced into a falsified reality
Perpetual mockery
Sowing seeds of adversity
Ripping at sanity
Revel in eternal sanctity
Perpetual mockery

All faith is being severed
By the fallacies that are revered
Obscured minds, impaired veracity
Fertile ground for Christianity
Beliefs void of any proof
Pay homage to a twisted truth
Spiritual icons created to elude
Emotions grimly misconstrued

[Solo: David]

[Repeat verse 3]

[Solo: Omar]

Intimidated by the thought of a second life
Restricted eyes can't see beyond these walls of lies
Creativity's lost, choked within a life of dissidence
False ideologies spread with malicious pretence
Rejecting moral values, reality's slipping away
A fragile grip that's fading, weakening day by day
A frivolous place in heaven will surely be secured
For all sacrifices that are vainly being endured

[Solo: David]
[Repeat 1st verse, chorus &amp; verse 3]
