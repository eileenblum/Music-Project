[Words: D.Bugeja M.Scalpello]

"God, I mourn for my counterfeit existence in surmise I defy your spineless 
... grace"
Far beyond belief resides your reality
Drowned in the inscrutable stream that baptised me
It's chasten waters rid me of my skin
To leave my soul venturing in the realm of sin
The stale crimson sky above my head
Emanates the stench of souls that are dead
Forbidden thoughts, fruit of a morbid destiny
Now I'll find peace in eternal blasphemy
Day after day I mourn in tribulation
You pose on your throne (while I live in damnation)
Heaven's divinity can't heal this affliction
Cursed is the hour of my conception
Angels praise your divine dominance
There's no truth it all stinks of putrescence
I lust to perpetuate your crucifixion
It's my last temptation to relieve this confliction

[Solos : David]
