[Music: D.Bugeja]
[Words: O.Grech]

Strengthened by a call of abnormal parentage
Echoes reverberate off this (incantatory) patronage
My footing's uncontrived in an urge for revelation
As I trace the aforehead voice in ascendant volition
Sun's rays - perforate the horizon inaugurating another day
Nature's music - halts my dream withering the night away
Dawn's light - melts against me giving birth to a misty haze
Her voice - touches me deep setting my restless desires ablaze
Inborn lust temptates my incandescending crave
Visualising forbidden allurements -
I'm enslaved Helplessly divulging the sound emanating source
Imperative sensuality discloses to follow its course

[Repeat verse 2]

Churning and twisting
Inside these flaming scars
Unveil your stained identity
Tear off my horrid mask
Buried within my ruthless obsession [X2]

With outstretched hands I grope at the misconceived
The same voice guides me as the calling perseveres
Wallowing on planes roamed by fatidic entities
Nailed to prolonged solitude and contentment depravity

[Solos: David, Omar]

[Repeat verse 4]
