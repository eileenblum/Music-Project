[Music: D.Bugeja D.Cachia T.Fenech]
[Words: D.Bugeja M.Scalpello]

Chalice of fire, heed my summons for war
Defiling false preachers an affliction of gore
Choke the vapid words of their credulous lore
So they shall reap the fruit of day no more
Ancient Gods Your will be undone
Dominions fall
Withered forever gone
Silence shed upon religious crimes
Victims tortured in the beloved name of christ
Martyrdom granted to those who abstain
Sanctifying the ones who have died in pain
The lesser ones
With vengeance I will strike
Their deftness
Shall appease my apetite
