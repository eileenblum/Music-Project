Journeys dwell - shelled in a mind of boundless tact
Wisdom flows - ideologies formulate down his hand
A will to create - looming in ascendant vigor
In wait to liven a dream embraced for so long

A procreation mirroring an existence bound in flesh
A volition risen foreseeing a new order given breath

Nearing the hour of birth, engulfed in neoteric light
Morphed from synthetic seed, blood of a satitated rite

Wombs gorged by embryonic matter of twisted origin
Spawning fast, beings transmute and swarm in legions
Regiments of cloned essence clutter, avid to scavenge
Dawned in fear, a day sworn to horror and banishment

Troops march on, wrenching their way, rapture's undone
Silhouettes contort against a blood stained sun
An ill-bred race bound to lapse in demise and hate
A new breed radiating wrath conceived to dominate

Pestilence unleashed to cleanse all sludge and impotence
Epidemic given light to eradicate all shallow existence
