A curse in slumber, restored for a timely reparation
Unbound and set upon a race that spews depravation
Oblivious of shadows cast by a looming extinction
Imbued with fallacies and engrossed in deception

Unseen powers propagate above turbulent skies
Mystically enshrouded from scavenging eyes
Astral bodies align preparing for the final dawn
Banishing all forms of life to eternal oblivion

The earth heaves - sacred shrines of mockery stand no more
Revered icons - shattered, their impotence revealed to all
Frivolous beliefs - now renounced by a race condemned
Panic struck - let the inexorable darkness descend

Self-righteous thoughts from an unblemished kind
Ripped apart by forces inconceivable to the mind
So grand is their weakness - so grand their ignorance
Dwarfed by indelible visions of an unearthly stance

Future's now hanging by a thread
For millions that are soon to be dead
Choking new life at its first breath
To clean the filth off this unfit earth

A scourging repudiation forced upon a misguided herd
Purging of impurity from which no life shall spared
Complete eradication executed with intrepidness and anger
Beneath chaos-drenched skies cloaked in perfect splendor
