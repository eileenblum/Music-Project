Winds howl across this desert called man
Their arid nature wither the scope for dreams
Artistry annulled from this soreful land
Staring into the eyes of stone soaked with tears

Granules blown apart and scattered in time
Sands embedded in sands - hour after hour
Melodies ring out the pain from oceans of grime
Sufferage fed into the prey awaiting its devourer

Brotherhood ceased its existence
Warmth inversed into chilling abhorrence
Adversities forged the path of hate
The senseless truth that failed its intent
Benevolence laid waste across this creation
Silence lacerates through walls of deliration

Within the folding depths roams the sore
Descending the eerie pathways of this horrid bane
Inured by time and drowned in odious lore
Helplessly lapsing into vaults of ageless pain
Ravaged by the bloodlust that reigns supreme
Congenital apathy imposed sentiment denial

Mentally maimed, begging for reprisal
Echoing bitterness rips inside this
Desolate dream

Brotherhood ceased its existence
Warmth inversed into chilling abhorrence
Adversities forged the path of hate
The senseless truth that failed its intent
Benevolence laid waste across this creation
Silence lacerates through walls of deliration

Winds howl across this desert called man
Their arid nature wither the scope for dreams
Artistry annulled from this soreful land
Staring into the eyes of stone soaked with tears

Granules blown apart and scattered in time
Sands embedded in sands - hour after hour
Melodies ring out the pain from oceans of grime
Sufferage fed into the prey awaiting its devourer
