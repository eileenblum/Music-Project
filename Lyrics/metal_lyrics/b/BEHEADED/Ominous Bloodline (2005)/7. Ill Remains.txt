Dominions lie ravished - spread thin across this face
Bloodsoaked aeons, legions pulverised - end embraced
Unearthly light engulfs bodies - deformed by blazing fire
Silhouettes mid propagating flames - pitching higher

Incinerated ruins exhaled through the purulent
Mouth of doom
Ashened carrion scavenged by hordes
Origin of perpetual gloom

Incinerated ruins exhaled through the purulent mouth of doom
Ashened carrion scavenged by hordes, origin of perpetual gloom

Sinisteral gates pulled apart in wait for the ill remains
A charred descent down the depths of this godless reign
An ageless butchery burdened upon this infirm race
Scorn roots odium within defaced planes
Withering flesh transmutes to dust as hours march on

Bitterness of utter purity drenches the evil of epochs gone
Shackled in a dream pursuing the wisdom
Evaded since inception

Immersed within ethereal waters, entangled
In the roots of creation
Belying inscriptions describing the rapture that never rose
Adulated through pierced eyes - intellects suspended in frost

Equity inflamed since the dawn of time

Immersed within ethereal waters, entangled
In the roots of creation
Belying inscriptions describing the rapture that never rose
Adulated through pierced eyes - intellects suspended in frost

In wait for the ill remains

Imagery of mangled beings outstretched on arms of wood
Blindfolded ideologies - annihilated existence - pain endured
