Dimmed existence cast forth its forlorn dominiance
Ill-fate scrolled down from beyond greying skies
Realmless supremacy banished to an inept dimension
Fortitude shallowed through words of misconception

Boundless deliberation instigating
The weirdest of artistry
Mesmerizing imagery of maimed bodies inured by lividity

Sanguinary dream, origin of a twisted presence
Insipid faces staring in the null through eyes of Decadence

Boundless deliberation instigating the weirdest of artistry
Mesmerizing imagery of maimed bodies inured by lividity
Sanguinary dream, origin of a twisted presence
Insipid faces staring in the null through eyes of decadence

Afflicted and mangled through ages of repent
Kingdom mutates to ruins as misery transcends
Dawn of mourn incepts the torture of another day
Somber hours slowly dragged upon a dismal domain

Barren planes lie stale, crushed by the hand of aberration
Early light forges the shadow upon paths of desolation
Effigies portraying tribulation rooted in profundity
Epitaphs reciting inflictions of utmost atrocity
Tears trail down cheeks soaking the aridity of existence
Trickles of bitterness seeping deep in soils of abhorrence

In pursuit of solace upon the wings of contemplation
Afloat upon devastated fields, echoing with pertubation

Dimmed existence cast forth its forlorn dominiance
Ill-fate scrolled down from beyond greying skies
Realmless supremacy banished to an inept dimension
Fortitude shallowed through words of misconception
