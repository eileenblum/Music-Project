Revenous eyes essence oozes off dazing walls
Preyed upon by eyes - impaled by looks of gall

Mentally conveyed unto seas of senseless lore
Adrift upon waters - veiling the depths of sore
Faces contort, limbs entwine in one surreal carnage
Bewildering imagery fruit of a regressed lineage

Melancholic poesy perpetuating autumn tones
The November breeze heading for times now gone

The blood bath is spilled soaking arid earth
Raging cries saturate air in a dissonance of ailment
Cadence of disease set at an ascendant pace
Withering time claws at moribund remains

Crawling in an absolute absence of vision
Absorbing grim - radiating in utter revulsion

Melancholic poesy perpetuating autumn tones
The November breeze heading for times now gone
Crawling in an absolute absence of vision
Absorbing grim - radiating in utter revulsion

Swarming ideologies cluster as one ill creation
Orb of inverted wisdom spawning since inception
Undurated at heart whilst tracing the path of rebirth
Submerged in loathe - seeking to heave off the absurd

Blindly - enthralled in an ominous bloodline
Roving mids fragments of memory
Set apart in time
Nourished by abhorrence down the ages
Ancestral odium woven in centuries remerges
