Abomination within the light of god
Subdued earthly believers inhumane toil
An unleashed affliction upon mankind
Perceiving enslavement to the mentally blind
Divine dream sets ablaze their twisted minds
Demented thought of insurrection unwinds
Rigorous aberration of cataclysmic climax
Succumbs to a mystical ominous vortex
Mourn for the looming twilight ordained,
evangelist's lore endlessly profaned
The bloodline that poured for so many years,
stains the undefiled stream of tears.
Crucify the misbegotten child

[Refrain:]
Disciples cherish his butchered corpse
Gore runs off the sanctimonious cross
Futile act of benevolence
A sinister way to achieve deliverance
Biblical orisons, testimony of the unblemished life,
In a time where nailed anatomy wasn't strive

[Solo: D. Bugeja]

Ripping human flesh, carnage of our ancient Lord,
epitaph of this sacred stone, sates the unquenchable horde.

[Solos: T. Fenech, D. Bugeja, T. Fenech, D. Bugeja, T. Fenech]
