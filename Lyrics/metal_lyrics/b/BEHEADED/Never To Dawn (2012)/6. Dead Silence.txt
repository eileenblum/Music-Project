Squalid Earth
Futile prayers falling on deaf ears of ancient hybrid gods
Banned desert, banished land regressed to dreck and dirt
Exiled, engulfed in scorn
Abandoned by it's own architects
habitat to worms, vermin, insects
Abhorred continuance of neglect
Expulsed to the abyssal eternal black
Echoing screams of tedious scorn
Futile prayers to hybrid gods
The mournful cries of an afflicted horde
Echoing screams of tedious scorn
transcend through the ages of squalor
Imposed asphyxia, premonitions from the ages of old
Constrained perdition to an inhibiting soulless ground
Echoing screams of tedious scorn
Dead silence, dominions fall, chalice of fire
Forever gone, dismal illusion, apocalypse aftermath
Inverting creation, death's genesis
