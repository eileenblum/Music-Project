Elapsed into a vortex dispersed in extinction
Submerged where the oceans flowing streams carry the millions dead

Shattered remnants of the sacred godheads of a world
In agony, pain, demonic screams, symbiosis of the unseen
Consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulphur

Multitude of burning souls
Reeking mist ascends from the ground
Spirals of pungent vapour abscond in ghostly forms

Dissonant melodies in synchronicity
Cancerous tunes looped into eternity

''And let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth''

The unsung melodies on the altars unblessed
Rupture of primordial instincts are entangled in erotic carnage of the flesh

A Crimson mask hollowing deeper in it's cavity
The idle march on to the dawn of an abducted sun

''And let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth''
and so it was

Elapsed into the vortex of the dead

The sun turns into darkness
The moon turns into blood
The beast with ten horns is rising
Upon it's seven heads the name of blasphemy

Elapsed into a vortex of death and extinction
Spheres warped into unknown aeons of transilience 
Recluse of the olden predictions
Scribes of the heretic sages
11th hour. The golden dominion
Bloodline of the millions dead

Shattered remnants of the sacred godheads of a world
In agony, pain, demonic screams, symbiosis of the unseen
