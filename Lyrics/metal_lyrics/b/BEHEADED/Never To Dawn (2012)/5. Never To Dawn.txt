Eternal eclipse scathing the skies
Prurient vultures casting a spheroid glide
Over a warped horde of lesser beings
Bodily devolved, abnormalities

Constrained to mere recollections of the blossoming Earth
Reminiscent of time gone

Slugs, diminished to a scavenging state
Grovelling abdomens unto dirt
A daubed contagion stretched it's reach
And obscured their every memory

Constrained to mere recollections of the blossoming Earth
Reminiscent of times gone

An asphyxiating darkness looms with vigorous imposition
Onset of an aesthetic dilapidation

Never to savor the breath of life
Never to sense the immaculate air
Never to catch a glimpse of sunlight
The imperative predicament
Never to dawn

Constrained to mere recollections of the blossoming earth
Never to dawn
