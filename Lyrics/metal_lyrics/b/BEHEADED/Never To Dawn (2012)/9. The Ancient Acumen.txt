In profound depth retiring afar
Astute reflections misalign the omen of the stars
Upturned scribes spew malignancy
Surrealism beyond the explicable
Beyond humane
Wedged in an ageless opaque abyss
Wisdom of the ancient acumen
Frozen winds from distant ages disperse
In a contiuum of unitelligible labyrinths
Secluded in a subsequent remote existence
Absorbed amid the ethereal infinite paths
Secrete, entangled symmetries mold
Taciturn monoliths recount the abject bleakness of a remote existence
Wedged in the frozen abyss
Drowned in the frozen abyss
Dead in the frozen abyss

Corroded vestiges of symbolic structures
Evocative relics of the lifeless forms
Perturbing aesthetics of insanity disturb the convulsing parallelisms of equilibrium
Death was inscribed by the ancient acumen
