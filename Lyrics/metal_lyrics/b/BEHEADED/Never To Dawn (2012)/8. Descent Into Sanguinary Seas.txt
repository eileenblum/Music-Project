A putrid stream of murk lurks in viral anguish, retribution
Unconscious wrath of this hallowed Earth
Ruins lay buried deep in stagnant sanguinary seas
Amongst the remnants of that which once was the epitome of splendour
Terrain formations of horrid shapes
Lurid figures amid scorn taking the place
To reinstate the delusion of supremacy
Entwined calamities, nature's caress
exposed human failures and feebleness
Descends the golden city in darkness

Turbulent force igniting the fierce motion
Distorted roars in humid winds echo
Atrocious inhumane, ruthless in its vengeance, ita inert
Crushing tides arise

Glories of a supreme and triumphant nation
Sunken in blood, deceased in devastation
An empire in tragedy, abode for the ones who died
Under great wings of the timeless skies
Scripted lament, the lore of immortal dreams
Presences still roam in mourn suffused in deadly seas
Amidst slime, on submerged moribund walls
An empire in tragedy, abode for the ones who died
Under great wings of the timeless skies
Ruins lay buried deep in sanguinary seas
Terrain formations of horrid shapes
Lurid figures amid scorn taking the place
To reinstate the delusion of supremacy
Entwined calamities, nature's caress
Expose human failures and feebleness
Descends the golden city in darkness
