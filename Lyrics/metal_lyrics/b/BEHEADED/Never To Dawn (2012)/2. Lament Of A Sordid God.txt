Spurn no to dreams that come in sleep and somnolence
Rivers dividing the worlds in conveyance of the dead

Serpent to human perception
Artifice to the unseen land
Embark amongst the imprisoned shades
Set sail on the black clothed ship
A stout drift along the dreary coast
Whence the sun is seen by no man

Serpent to human perception
Artifice to the unseen land
Ferryman upon winds of lamentation
Sordid god of the underworld
Embark amongst the imprisoned shades
Set sail on the black clothed ship
A stout drift along the dreary coast
Whence the sun is seen by no man

A coin is placed under their tongue
Whit eyes like hollow furnaces of fire
Spew a fierce and keen gaze
Unfolding beastly wings
Obtruding the deadly plague
Great moors of an ageless path
The path which all must thread
Whence the sun is seen by no man

Serpent to human perception
Sordid god of the underworld
Embark amongst the imprisoned shades
Set sail on the black clothed ship
A stout drift along the dreary coast
Whence the sun is seen by no man
