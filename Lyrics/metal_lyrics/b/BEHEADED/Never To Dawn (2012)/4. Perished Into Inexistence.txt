Glaciers protruding from the oblique ocean floor
Erroneous timeline delineate deities once adorned
Of an emerald kingdom contorted to stone

Shrine to the mystic to great kings
Golden metropolis now habitat to headless beings
Lethargic nomads with bloated skin
Roving abruptly in meaningless, patter less motion
A habitat to headless beings
An earthly paradise swallowed by the sea
it's magnitude annulled by relentless catastrophe
The incessant floods
The rush of the oceans
Encapsulate the realm in an ageless dimension
The stirring of mud
The wrath of great seas
Humanity dead
Perished into inexistence
Descendant of giants
Offspring of the gods
Diminished to a bizarre embellished grotesque form
Disfigured architectures devoured by algae
Forgone icons of greatness once symbol of a dream
