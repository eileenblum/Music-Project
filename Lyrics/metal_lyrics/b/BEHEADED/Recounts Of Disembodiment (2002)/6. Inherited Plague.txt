Twofold existence forced upon this shell
Futile journey put to rest as precompelled
Malicious edge incised in fervent flesh
Beg to recoil amid those now laid to rest
Melancholic verses rotate within still minds
Surreal visionary inscribed in hollow eyes
Paths entwine across this distorted plane
Roads pursued upon this lunatic domain
Inherited stigmas abort distinct convictions
Eyes sewn shut the very day of conception
Pursuing a voice which yields transcendence
Entangled in a mass of echoes exhorting abhorrence
Prophecies repudiate the terror of ages to come
Fear pervades the hearts of the mentally numb
A racial plague infected the epitome of existence
Ramifying its roots in minds seeking credence
Ages darkened by forced illiteracy
Ears deafened by the sole dirge of conspiracy
Humans indicted of witchery set aflame
Prophecies repudiate the terror of ages to come
Fear pervades the hearts of the mentally numb
A racial plague infected the epitome of existence
Ramifying its roots in minds seeking credence
Ages darkened by forced illiteracy
Ears deafened by the sole dirge of conspiracy
Humans indicted of witchery set aflame
Scenes of torched bodies meeting the depths of pain
Flesh ripped to the satisfaction of the inflictors
Annointed in fire spirits freed from this earthly horror
Ethereal essence parts from its putrid remains
Heaving to the dimension where no time pertains
