For years confined in an unadorned reality
Wretched &amp; scorned by relentless atrocities
Scared to unearth truths spewing depravity
Overpowered by (opposing) figments of insanity
Dismembered dreams wither away
Choked by the anguish this world portrays
Broken thoughts of righteousness disavow
Reason of being sinking, spiraling down
A harassed mind fed on incessant lies
Stripped of own virtues, identity slowly dies
Cold inanimate beings filled with emptiness
A domain run by bearers of utter worthlessness
Unable to fight this inbred sense of defeat
Summoning ghostly shadows, dispersed in retreat
Hatred runs in arid veins, nerves start to boil
Subordination turns into hatred, raging turmoil
Beguiled hordes clash in a war born of greed
Chaos rules galore feeding on abominations seed
Bodies burn as they fall down abysmal depths
Absorbed by vortexes devouring the face of earth
Coveted gods lie vanquished in an array of impotence
Uncovering their meek and shallow form of existence
Reaching for this portal, seeking for survival
Amid scattered fragments of a shattered reprisal
Unable to fight this inbred sense of defeat
Summoning ghostly shadows, dispersed in retreat
Hatred runs in arid veins, nerves start to boil
Subordination turns into hatred, raging turmoil
Beguiled hordes clash in a war born of greed
Chaos rules galore feeding on abominations seed
Bodies burn as they fall down abysmal depths
Absorbed by vortexes devouring the face of earth
