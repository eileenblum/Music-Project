Derision obfuscates the vision to be
Entities fed upon blinding mockery
Defunct echoes misconceived by the fresh cast
Renaissance shall banish the effigy of our past
Pulsating will sets the new legion free
Fresh ideologies injected in this mental spree
Intertwined voices haunt this malformed existence
Scriptures set ablaze to abolish the vile reminiscence
Necrose and crippled by the hand of time
Epochs fall in ageless slumber beneath grime
Evict the contents of dismal minds
Set a new pace to salvage regressing lives
Disgust inscribed on faces tensed with revenge
Odium gushes in the eye of the discontent
Dethroned lords turned to immutable slaves
Finalised coven satiates the risen crave
Pestilence spreads its wings upon a race drowned in disdain
Rotting souls scavenge amid putrefying remains
Morrow awaits the reconstruction of the new breed
The cycles revived as progenitors transmute off their seed
Necrose and crippled by the hand of time
Epochs fall in ageless slumber beneath grime
Evict the contents of dismal minds
Set a new pace to salvage regressing lives
