Voices dwell in chambers of ages surpassed
Resentments echo within vaults suffused in the past
Thirst for insurrection remained unquenched
Alleviate this demented presence of its timeless sufferage
Perdition tightens its grip suffocating every scope
Anguish perforates its roots consuming each drop of hope
Undulating perceptions wallow within this ill-bred mind
Light cleansed away from eyes conferring black to the blind
Unassuaged existence burdened with forced derangement
Insurmountable horror disturbs this earthly confinement
Twisted meditations fruit of prolonged abstinence
Senses tortured through ages of utter penance
Twisted meditations fruit of prolonged abstinence
Senses tortured through ages of utter penance
Vain reasons unsaturate this dehumanizing intent
Significance of pleasure inversed in dismal repent
Void instigated through inebriated preachings
Perpetuated maelstorm forges this hollow sense of being
Absurdity flows incessantly from demented mouths
Regressed lore furiously spat in intimidating shouts
Pain burnt deep within this morosed sanity
Hindered into oblivion from a manipulated destiny
Voices dwell in chambers of ages surpassed
Resentments echo within vaults suffused in the past
Thirst for insurrection remained unquenched
Alleviate this demented presence of its timeless sufferage
