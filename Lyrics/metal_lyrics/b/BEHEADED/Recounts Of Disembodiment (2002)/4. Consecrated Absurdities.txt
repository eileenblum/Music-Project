Perpetually lurking through undefiled regions
Like a stream of sludge - a spreading contagion
Inundating all the boundaries of a dying earth
Bringing complete doom wherever it sets
Swinish fornication - procreating humanity
An ungoverned lust that transcends all rationality
Feeble creatures compelled by ignorance
Blunt against the true reason of existence
Defenseless amid outbursts of adversities
Randomly decimated by unforeseen iniquities
Inflicted atrocities are returned in a strain
To wash the filth off this shallow domain
Devastated and scattered by winds of retribution
Defying null beings enthralled in misconception
Adulated by litanies and lamentations of repent
Endlessly awaiting the day of atonement
Consecrated absurdities - icons of deception
Instilling infirmity amid an utter lack of perception
Gifted with eyes that discern the fabrics of time
Eyes that can never pertain the mentally blind
In a final hurl - together they shall be wiped away
Man and god - an alliance that is bound to fail
A fallen prey - the predator will gradually gorge
Resistance is - futile against natures scourge
Inflicted atrocities are returned in a strain
To wash the filth off this shallow domain
In a final hurl together they shall be wiped away
Man and god an alliance that is bound to fail
A fallen prey the predator will gradually gorge
Resistance is - futile against natures scourge
