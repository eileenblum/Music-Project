Impassively waiting as life painfully takes its toll
A narrow path of existence I behold with remorse
Compelled in derangement preordained living hell
Ceaseless tribulation in defeat I shall dwell
Self-possessed in absolute consternation
Pensive slights divulge scenes of aberration
Dismembered dreams from a bludgeoned past
Taunting last fragments of inherent lust
Burden of life I can no longer sustain
Can't overcome this unbearable mental strain
Emerging from this deviant form of slumber
Unable to fit the mould that pushed me under
Impregnated sense of guilt pursues me
Disturbed I fall in the bizarre grips of destiny
Bestiality originating within an ill fed mind
Banish the feeble beliefs encrusted in time
A single murmur unleashed my ominous desires
Watching their faces infatuated in blazing fire
Melodic lines of agonising bodies echo restlessly
Saturating my necrotic crave for pure insanity
Drenched with ideologies I long to find
The lost path pursued by the mentally blind
The merge of a new art - dawn of creation
Projects my inner self into the astral dimension
Self-possessed in absolute consternation
Pensive sights divulge scenes of aberration
Dismembered dreams from a bludgeoned past
Taunting last fragments of inherent lust
Burden of life I can no longer sustain
Can't overcome this unbearable mental strain
Emerging from this deviant form of slumber
Unable to fit the mould that pushed me under
Drenched with ideologies I long to find
The lost path pursued by the mentally blind
The merge of a new art - dawn of creation
Projects my inner self into the astral dimension
