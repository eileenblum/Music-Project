Remain in silence or death arrives
at strange doors we are now
Quiet in tranquillity or everything breaks
the bow is strung up
No stepping forward no stepping back
better to remain transfixed
Balanced in calmness
lest one twig shall crack
A brimful chalice
Just one drop more
and everything cascades
Benighted stillness
Elusive daylight
Escape in masquerade
A brimful chalice
Just one drop more
and everything cascades
Benighted stillness
Elusive daylight
It''s our twilight
Devoid of strength
It is lingering
No voices no words
One move to deceive the haven
God-forsaken without lucky stars
soon to breathe but not yet
In silence to endure this
or our twilight
