As dry as they come
This desert 'neath a hollow sun
With nothing ahead
But the ragged shapes of the dead

A smile of the crazed
Comes, settles and stays
Empty before me, empty behind
And the sun forever shines

Nothing is the fire inside
This be all end of life
Waiting for the flame
To tear through the game
Ashes
Night to revive

The merciless tide
That brings neither change nor life
Carries a shapeless derelict
On spectral waves of static

There is a locker inside
Where my heart forever lies

[2x]
On burning fields of blackened grain
The flesh is a lie
I am but a sigh
In a storm of soul debris

Wrecked is the ship that tore through the crust
For untold ages is strode with tattered bloody flags
But in the depths where black voids erupt
A still force engulfed the vessel's might

[6x]
Be all
End all

Sailing on
Towards the sun
The flame will tear through the game
Night is revived

Sailing on
Towards the sun
Tortured eyes repeat the lie
The flesh am I

[3x]
Be all
End all
