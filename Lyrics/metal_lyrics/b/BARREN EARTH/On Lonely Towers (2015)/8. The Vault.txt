Now that all is said and done
Time for the falling leaves
Follow the heaviest heart
Letting go of promise
The promise of tomorrow
Under corroding rain
The smile of the newborn
Falling to her grave

Extinguished like fire
Like freedom in chaos
I study my victories
Now lost in bitter endings
Will to betray eternity
Withers with the flowers blue
The skies darken in celebration
Celebrate the raven

All life bows to sirens of oblivion
As they begin their eternal song
The sweetest voice in a world that bums
Where beauty always wants to die

The path unfolds, the path is mine
Now that you touched with your light
The path unfolds, I seek out my grave
A human gesture, forever cleansing

From solitude to here, from here to eternity
The seconds of solace arrive
In this final chapter, a voice calls my name
Before the darkening skies

Ravens of the burning sky
The sirens of twilight
Set alight, now we're coming home
For all this beauty wants to die
