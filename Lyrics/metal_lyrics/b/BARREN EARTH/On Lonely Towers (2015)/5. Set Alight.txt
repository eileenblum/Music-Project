Hiding is
A life for some
We wait for the storms to come
Maybe they
Are always there
Striking down on others where we can't go

Crashing into their hearts
Souls ablaze
Thunder shaking their minds
Wide awake
In the dashing lightning
In the pouring rain
As their bodies bum
A jolt of life for one last time

As die rumbling drifts by and fades
I can only claim to have dreamed
And when the flicker in the clouds is to be seen no more
I travel on

Here we walk
Every day
Searching and dreaming ourselves out of the grey

Colours bled from our hearts
Ornate stains
Flowing into our minds
Wide awake
In the flashing lightning
In the pouring rain

As our senses fade we feel desire to catch fire

Call the storms
To gather
Mind from matter
Let the fire
Split the atoms
Reassemble

Ignite us
Unite us
O fork of electric demise

Autumn's grey
Floods the skies
Colours fading from your eyes
Fertile clouds
Drifting in
Waste no time
Lightning strikes

Crashing into our hearts
Souls ablaze
Thunder shaking our minds
Wide awake
In the flashing lightning
In the pouring rain
As my body bums I feel alive one last time
