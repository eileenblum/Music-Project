I taste the broth that seeps down through the gorge
I wipe the blade I once wrought from the forge
The taste of flesh, the ash of oaken fires
I bide my time by the mire until it dries

To me the world is a heart
No chambers void, some shallow
And when the light prepares to depart
A pulse for my breath to follow

I sense the throes of twilight born anew
I fear its wrath as all my brothers do
Though life turns dark and movement steals the night
I rejoice in the spoils at morning light

To me the world is a heart
No chambers void, some shallow
And when the light prepares to depart
A pulse for my breath to follow
Retrieving senses dormant while daylight reigns

The eyes of dusk ignite
A promise of teeth and claw
Revoke my bones from sleep
Upon my tongue a feral howl

Stars!
Watchers of the dark
Blood drips from my wailing plea
Stars!
I seek your blessing
To paint the blood of my hunter
Upon the weapon that reaps my prey
