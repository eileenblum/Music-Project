I will rest here
And I might not awake
Was there ever a place for one to lie
It must be here
An ocean green
My hands on stone
Scarred and battled

Shreds of banner cloth
Dance recklessly in a desolate breeze
Clinging to their weathered rods
Perched on lonely towers

Praying for faith under darkening clouds
Songs of chaos burning holes in the sky
Praying for faith under darkening clouds
They marched on lonely towers

Their screams live on
As wraiths in the wind
And only when time ends
Their voices may be stilled

Dire winds
Break the leaves
Failing suns
Beyond the mist

Who are you?
A promise from the spirits of life

Darkness has ceased
To flood my mind
I will wait until the dawn
I will wait until the dawn to die

My body is weak
But my will takes flight
I will wait until the dawn
I will wait until the dawn to die

And as you speak
My fear subsides
I will wait until the dawn
I will wait until the dawn arrives
