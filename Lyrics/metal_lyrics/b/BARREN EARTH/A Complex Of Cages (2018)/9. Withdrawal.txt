And so they move with narrow purpose
A metropolis brought to the boil
Rush through the rain
Head down in trenches
Departure, return
And the sum of all is none

A new morning is given me
And I'm not ready
Again the countless paths
I choose them all once more

How long 'til dawn
How long 'til evening
The days hang heavy on each hour
They seem so far gone
In a complex of cages
And the dreaded breakout looms

A new morning is given me
And politely received
Still the countless truths remain hidden

Down bound from honest misery
Who could settle for tears alone
No fire, no frost, no flesh to distract
From a light so mindless

How close we kept empathy
Did it serve our intentions well?
No mind, no soul, no will to abstract
From a light so mindless

Down bound from honest misery
Who could settle for tears alone
No fire, no frost, no flesh to distract
From a light so mindless

How close we kept empathy
Did it serve our intentions well?
No mind, no soul, no will to abstract
From a light so mindless
From a light so mindless
