There was a time
Of a roaring fire storming inside
A dull disinclination now
Has come to you to abide

Prematurely strayed away
From the howling storm
Sense the wilted flower
And enter the pith of solitude

The stars revolve in black
As thine aching lust has awakened
Evading dusk, the flames of ecstasy
To the pith of solitude
I shrink as I bewail
The giant of red
Shed no light of sympathy

Respite of vanish relentlessly
As you repose
In the briny depths of the sea
Strayed away
From the howling storm
And the dying stars...

The stars revolve in black
As thine aching lust has awakened
Evading dusk, the flames of ecstasy
To the pith of solitude
I shrink as I bewail
The giant of red
Shed no light of sympathy

Restless in stillness
Once relieved by tribulation
Delivered by the moon
Ushered to the desolate sea

Guts of wind rising
Serenity destined to wither

In the twilight hour
As shrinks the daylight
I stand beneath the eyes
Of forgotten aspirations

The void is swollen
By the ghost unborn
And I lay down the burden
Of infinite mysteries

Prematurely strayed away
From the howling storm
Sense the wilted flower
And enter the pith of solitude
