Walls and waterfalls
Ground to mist against them all
Bronze shackles rip
Tear at flesh before they break
The flood took the fires
Carried them away from here
Bleak attempt to reach
Above where the echoes flow
And gush, gush off the plateau
Seething on my hold

A shiver halts from stride...
Yet you were promised painless aeons
You've watched it all go by

A shiver halts your stride
A weakness in design
With pride and lowered head
You bless the wayward dead
Throw dust in their smiles

You've watched it all go by
A blinded world
You've watched it all go by
A blinded, cursed world

Enter
Dig deep
And find them fireless and low
Pour those white streams
Into each hollow crevice
Bless them
Bind them
And leave them harnessed in the fold
Passionblind scavenger
Consume the noxious riverglow

Zealous heart
Beyond the frail ashen voice
Jagged shard
Of a once worshipped choice

Zealous heart (be still now)
You've watched it all go by
Jagged shard (tumbling through)
A cursed world
