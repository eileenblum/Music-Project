Writhe futile
Flutter into shallow reprieve
And for a bleak while
Heaven doth upon, bare to achieve
A living fortress now revolving in stasis
Well maintained self
Scatterprey willing

A pulse in the haze beckons
Into the traction of sky icons

Cast a shadow foe far across the water
Break the paltry light in the undergrowth
Where the fearful lovers pray
For the wind to come

Fledglings, gaze to the wind
Hearken the whisper you ride
And viciously you sever the final thread

In the whirl, back they float
Higher (Higher) in the thermal column
Circle slow, fiercely scan
Wired (Wired) to dilute the air of song

Was lost in sound
The scent reversed
A swift rebound
Now undeterred

In the whirl, back they float
Higher (Higher) in the thermal column
Circle slow, fiercely scan
Wired (Wired) to dilute the air of song

Mired (Mired) in the path I've taken
