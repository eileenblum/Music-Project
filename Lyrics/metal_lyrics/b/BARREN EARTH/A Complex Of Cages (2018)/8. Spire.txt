In the accolades I rub my spirit raw
In every crack regalia fester
(golden scars to testify)
A rolling gait
Through plebs impassions one and all
To subjugate and turn to power designs
(battering minds)
I feel encouraged by the threat
That overhangs my rage
Spurs me on to pierce the veil
(regain the strides that drowned inside)
Getting closer the source of an honor
I believe that this is where the ire began

Higher higher
Cast into more than being
Dire words
Lashing me on

Lawless, piercing through the echoing avarice
Riding on the blackened waves forlon
(Reflecting waves like broken shards)
Introspective, anchored, malevolent
Bleak resolve, all bets are open!

Higher higher
Cast into more than being
Dire words
Lashing up harrowing fiends
Higher higher
On the teeth of a raging sea
Then immersed
In the flash of a still forming spire

(Loss) I've repaired this enclosure
Mourned the loss of a notion
For days and years
(Years so low)
Low was that world
(world without will)
Will all this silence be broken while
(We live)
(Ever long)
I've repaired this enclosure
(Wrath of the ocean)
Battled the wrath of this ocean
Around our isle

Proud astride the grime-tressed mare
I interjected
And called the hordes to me
All the while lacking the skill to lead

Thus vexed I laid my scorn
On bleating masses
Swung the workhorse of despair
Took the gallop towards the precipice

(Loss) I've repaired this enclosure
Mourned the loss of a notion for days and years
(So low)
Low was that world
(world without still)
Will rose higher devotion found
(We lived)
(Ever long) I've repaired this enclosure
(Wrath of the ocean)
And seen the wrath
Of this ocean reform our fears
(Downcast)
Cast into more
(more than mere will)
Will all these shards remain broken still?
(Lashing me on)

On - Forlorn blackened waves
On - Lashing me on
On - Forlorn blackened waves
On - Lashing me onto the spire
