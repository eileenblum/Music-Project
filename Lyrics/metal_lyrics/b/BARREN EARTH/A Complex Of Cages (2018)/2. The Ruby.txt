Borne in the spiteful red

Long lost
I've feared to meet those eyes
And I might only reach that level
In tatters
Flow recollected
Scraped out of soil

(No sides) There appear to be no sides to take
And skywards points the ruby
Concealing codes (codes unrepaired)
That harbour the way out
(This void) Oh I wish there was something at stake
These voices cracked the ruby
What codes (code retraced)
Could harbour the way out of this

A chance to falter
A loss without dissent
One step towards the distant ravine
Carnal honour wreathed in toxin
Vile by design

(No sides) There appear to be no sides to take
And skywards points the ruby
Concealing codes (codes unrepaired)
That harbour the way out
(This void) Oh I wish there was something at stake
These voices cracked the ruby
What codes (code retraced)
Could harbour the way out of this

We, the righteous two
From one to another
Sever this jagged shard
Borne in the spiteful red

(No sides) There appear to be no sides to take
And skywards points the ruby
Concealing codes (codes unrepaired)
That harbour the way out
(This void) Oh I wish there was something at stake
These voices cracked the ruby
What codes (code retraced)
Could harbour the way out of this
