[music &amp; lyrics: MÃ¥rtenson]

Without a sound
Saw the eagle rising
The bringer of storms
Under dark clouds flying
The forlorn waves rowing ashore
The island with no name
Many a ship
Here lost its way
A few return
From the cross swell may
Brave men of old
Their screams now silent
Forever gone
As the sea embraced them
The forlorn waves rowing ashore
The island with no name
A man unknown
Sailor of the seas
Cast overboard
Here he found his peace
