[music: Laine, Lyrics: Laine &amp; KotamÃ¤ki]

With words of scorn they call
Through the times they burn
Where they go death always follows

Through the skies like the wind they storm
Birds of doom
Filled with a holy rage against you all
With words of scorn they call
The stranger is an enemy
Servants of a false god they are
Holders of innocence
Drowned in blood
Blameless observers of eternity
Drowned in blood
In the hopeless land of no return
Through the times they'll burn
The stranger is an enemy
Servants of a false god they are
Holders of innocence
Drowned in blood

Through the fire the passage goes
Years turn to black
At the dawn of the coming times
Where they go, death follows
