[music: MÃ¥rtenson, lyrics: Jussi K. NiemelÃ¤]

Wash her
Kiss her
Feel myâ¨
Thunderâ¨
She's goneâ¨
Like my wrathâ¨
She's goneâ¨
You screamâ¨
Watch meâ¨
Kneelingâ¨
Touch herâ¨
She's here
Heat fireâ¨
She's hereâ¨
Summoning me
Blessing our griefâ¨
My loveâ¨
Lie down
Prayingâ¨
Worshipâ¨
Dying
My life
Bleedingâ¨
My lifeâ¨
Sleepingâ¨
Weeping
Hear myâ¨
Silenceâ¨
She's gone
Fireâ¨
She's gone

Hold the candles and slay the skyâ¨
Take her home
Sanctifyâ¨
Curse the darkness to make it rightâ¨
Watch the dawn, closing her eyes
See it shineâ¨
See me rise
Like the sunâ¨
Breeding lifeâ¨
Make her sleepâ¨
In my heartâ¨
There she waits
Fireâ¨
And I feel the raysâ¨
Closing in on meâ¨
And her spirit stays
Fire
