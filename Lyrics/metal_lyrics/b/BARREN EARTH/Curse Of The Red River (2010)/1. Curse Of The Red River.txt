[music: Laine &amp; Yli-SirniÃ¶, lyrics: Laine]

On pathless ways you wither
And hope has flown away
Rise before my sight
In the great eternity
Darkest obscurities
No sun will ever shine again
As the days of gold have passed
Never to return
Just like a dream too bright to last
Is the curse of the red river
See the raging torrent
Wash your soul to the valley below
To the graves
Of the sea of oppression
And see the bleak reflections
Of the days that are no more
From the dreadful shadows
As the days of gold have passed
Never to return
Just like a dream too bright to last
Are the beds of blood by the rivers of red
