[music &amp; lyrics: PerttilÃ¤]

I could hold that hand no more
I turned away and tried to swim back to the shore
To let go of joy and fear
Forsaking all that will melt down to tears
Forever shifting place and time
Caught in delusion
This dream is only mine
Released from
All sorrow
You bring tonight
Reflecting
A sunrise
As I close my eyes
In the distance for evermore
Swimming miles and miles to never reach the shore
Last flicker of reality
All I can portray is only real to me
Released from
All sorrow
You bring tonight
Reflecting
A sunrise
As I close my eyes
Drifting with
True wonders
To never touch the ground
Merge sorrow
With beauty
As I close my eyes
Another truth
A different sun
No infinity could be the only one
So I embrace
The other side
And it hits me with sunlight
And shatters the space
Purpose and time
Rejoice this night
Is shifting worlds
A thousand suns
No one can share this end of time
