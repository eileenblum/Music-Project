[music &amp; lyrics: Laine]

The pining silence
Crying from solitude
Wandering pathways
Waving from grass
Beside the fence
Lies the mortal clay
The echoes from the past
Flavoured by dismay
Bleed for the one
Who scattered in sorrow
The stars above her
Foreshadowed a lorn tomorrow
And as I'm crawling
Across the weedy acres
Towards the dismal calm
That in the soil awaits
Each morn a thousand
Heartaches will bring
Moreover to the woes
Of yesterday
The pining silence
Crying from solitude
Wandering pathways
Waving from grass
And as I'm crawling
Across the weedy acres
Towards the dismal calm
That in the soil awaits
By day I find no comfort
Nor repose by night
The stars are calling
Luring with their divine light
Bleed for the one
Who scattered in sorrow
The stars above her
Foreshadowed deserted morrows
