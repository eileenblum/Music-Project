[music: Laine, lyrics: Laine &amp; Koskinen]

Stream of time has been broken
Blessed is the infernal soul
Dark desire has awoken
And I see the angels fall
In the moments of silence
As the wind has abated
The clouds of black come in sight
Down pour the tears of god
Sailing down on the tears of god
On the way to oblivion
And we sleep without dreaming
In the eternal wake of the leer
From beyond the end is creeping
Fleeing bliss redressed by agony
From above the eye is leering
For what has been and what will ever be
