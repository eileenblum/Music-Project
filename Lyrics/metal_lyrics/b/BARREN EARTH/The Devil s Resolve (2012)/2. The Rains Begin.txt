[Music by MÃ¥rtenson
Lyrics by Jussi K. NiemelÃ¤]

Against the sky a silent choice
She takes me in her pulse within
Beyond the deep the green voice calls
Touching my skin

Her touch is cold yet suddenly
I feel the heat that's feeding me
She rules the waves inside
Alien
And again
Takes my hand

I move myself towards her eyes
She lets me in, the rains begin
About to break the holy ties
Strange, freezing and thin

Her touch is cold yet suddenly
I feel the heat that's feeding me
She rules the waves inside
Alien
And again
Takes my hand

Inside the storm
Madness is born
Love-like
Immersed by her
Ocean waves burn,
Love-like
Closing her eyes
Shutting the skies,
Love-like
As they reclaim their kin

Her touch is cold yet suddenly
I feel the heat that's feeding me
She rules the waves inside
Alien
And again
Takes my hand
