[Music &amp; lyrics by Laine]

The verge of reality
Faced by the traitors of the mighty unknown
Returning back from the aeons
To embrace the epitomes of horror

To the paradise
Of forgotten souls they fall
Over and over
For the wonders of beyond they call
And the spirits
Of reality fled before the emotion
Altars of illusion
Lured to sacrifice the devotion

Into an oriental pyre
Drifting far from the ocean of your thoughts
Tempted by skies so eerie
In the distant horizon

Awake at the final gates
Grasping for the sand of time
Fearing no shadow
As you slumber
In the hollows of dead desire
To the paradise
Of forgotten souls they fall
Over and over
For the wonders of beyond they call

Into an oriental pyre
Drifting far from the ocean of your thoughts
Tempted by skies so eerie
In the distant horizon

Into an oriental pyre
Drifting far from the ocean of your thoughts
Tempted by skies so eerie
In the distant horizon
