[Music &amp; lyrics by Laine]

Ghosts from the past
Two of them in flesh
Sailed across the seas
The ultimate invasion
Cause of deprecation
Storming the fields
Of a hostile kingdom
And absurdity

In the minds of the deranged
Are the laws of holiness
To be re-arranged
Morbid messenger of god
In sonic warfare
Sets the rites of immortal
And a burden to bear

Restless souls preventing sleep
Craved by the tired eyes
Forgotten ones
Of the lost decade
About to lose another one

Forgotten ones
Of the lost decade
About to lose another one
And all shall decay

For the unholy grail
Roaming fifty leagues a day
Bless the corpses of the past
Who rose upon the dawn

In the minds of the deranged
Are the laws of holiness
To be re-arranged
Morbid messenger of god
In sonic warfare
Sets the rites of immortal
And a burden to bear

For vintage warlords
