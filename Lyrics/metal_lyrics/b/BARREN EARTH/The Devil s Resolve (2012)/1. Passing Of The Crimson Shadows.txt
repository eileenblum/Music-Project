[Music by Laine
Lyrics by KotamÃ¤ki, Laine]

Lead me to the bridges of isolated emotion
And we shall meet no more
Into the arms of time I hasten before
The final moonbeam falls

No blessing for the poor
Nor for the hungry ones
No blessing for the ones who grieve
No mercy for the suppressed ones
Lonely be the latest hour
The spirit sleeps in the ocean
Dying star beneath the day
Slowly lapsed into its grave

Can you sense the shadows of crimson passing by?

Lonely be the latest hour
And the spirit sleeps in the ocean
Soon from flesh to part
Sense the passing shadows of our lives
Dying star beneath the day
Slowly lapsed into its grave

No blessing for the poor
Nor for the hungry ones
No blessing for the ones who grieve
No mercy for the suppressed ones
Lonely be the latest hour
The spirit sleeps in the ocean
Dying star beneath the day
Slowly lapsed into its grave

Can you sense the shadows of crimson passing by?

Sworn to this blackness
Soon from flesh to part
Sworn to this blackness
Failed under the eyes of god

Forsake the light
Under the eyes of god
Bow to none
Farewell to light
Lonely be the latest hour
Bow to none

Lonely be the latest hour
The spirit sleeps in the ocean
Dying star beneath the day
Slowly lapsed into its grave

Spirit in the ocean
Star beneath the day

Passing of the crimson shadows
