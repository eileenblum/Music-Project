[Music &amp; lyrics by Laine]

Sheer insanity
The order of the immortal
Beyond the boundaries
Of human imagination
Lie in thy ground
In the valleys of incantation
Rejoice the dreams
Of the ancient

Below the winds of doom
The hills of desolation
Listen to the whispering
Of immortality
Recall the nights of wonder
The moaning of the moon
Before the burial of the dead

Sheer insanity
The order of the immortal
Beyond the boundaries
Of human imagination
Lie in thy ground
In the valleys of incantation
Rejoice the dreams
Of the ancient

The dead exiles
Eternal seas to cross
To the deceitful wiles
Of the shores of agony

Weave the woofs of death
And close thine eyes eternally

The heads of hollow
Fleshless creatures underground
Gloom of pandemonium
Between the ribs they're crawling
The dead exiles
Eternal seas to cross
To the deceitful wiles
Of the shores of agony

Way beyond the dream
The shine of life is weakening
Battered hopes and broken vows
Gone with the wind

Way beyond the dream
The shine of life is weakening
Battered hopes and broken vows
Gone with the wind

Way beyond the dream
The shine of life is weakening
Battered hopes and broken vows
Gone with the wind
