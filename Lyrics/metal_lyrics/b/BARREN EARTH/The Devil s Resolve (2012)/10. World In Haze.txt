[Music by MÃ¥rtenson
Lyrics by KotamÃ¤ki]

Old man walks down the road
Waves last goodbyes as he walks by
One thing led to another disappointment
That marked the path to his grave

Sorrow piles up on your shoulders
Smile of a stranger can't reduce the weight
Just keeps you falling down
Falling down

Old man at the end of the road
All his burden left behind
One thing led to another disappointment
That marked the path to his grave
So all his shattered hopes
Transparent and cold like the man old
Flushed down the drain like dirt
Will anyone remember?

Sorrow piles up on your shoulders
Smile of a stranger can't reduce the weight
Just keeps you falling down
Falling down

When there's no one to catch you
At the darkest dead of night
You are fading away
Fading away

You can't hide all your life in haze
After dawn it's gone
You're torn apart
If the sun in your heart
Burnt your soul and died
You are fading away
Faded away
