[Music by MÃ¥rtenson
Lyrics by Jussi K. NiemelÃ¤]

You storm the mountains
We close the gate
You scream your hate
You flood the fountains
Summon our faith
It's not too late

You blind their eyes
Their spiteful lies

Reign
Reign
As it is written
Maim
Maim
As it is written

The walls are crying
You bring as down
We kiss your crown
The waters dying
You let them sleep
We hear them weep

Our loving god
You spill their blood

Reign
Reign
As it is written
Maim
Maim
As it is written

Like it is written
Devour the moon
It's all too soon

The soldiers kneel
The walls of steel
The fading skies
My bleeding eyes

As it is written
