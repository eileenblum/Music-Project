[Music &amp; lyrics by PerttilÃ¤]

This is where all stories end
Under cold and distant stars
Abandoned cities shine no light
Losing battle against the sky
This is when all fire goes out
End of lonesome winter's tales
Every dream dies unfulfilled
Under cold and distant stars

The horizon tears open
To shine its black light

The horizon tears open (slowly down the ashes fall)
To shine its black light
See the ring of heaven (before my eyes the ashes fall)
Two ends of the night

In rising winds our ashes fly
Seal the world in oblivion
Burying a dark morning
Torn by infinities
Infinities

As the sky distorts
Hovering eye sheds no tear
Weaving our light
In a spaceless shape

Frozen lakes and a dying sun
Eye in the sky sheds no tear
Consuming singularity
Among cold and distant stars

The horizon tears open (slowly down the ashes fall)
To shine its black light
I'll see through the skies (before my eyes the ashes fall)
Two ends of the night
