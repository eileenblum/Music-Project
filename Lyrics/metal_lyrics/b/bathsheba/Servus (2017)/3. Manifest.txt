From within the wounds of my mind
Arises the thunder called "I"
The stars are but thistles in the sky
I was conceived of a jackal
Your pain is but a splinter on the cross child
Thy will be done
For this is the Sanhedrin of the Sabbath

I will be so powerful
No need to take on a form
Casting spells upon the weak
No need to believe
Speak the words out loud
A manifest of space and time

A manifest of life
My Satan dances with his devil

He is my human bloodhound
Deeply attracted by the scent of my darkness
