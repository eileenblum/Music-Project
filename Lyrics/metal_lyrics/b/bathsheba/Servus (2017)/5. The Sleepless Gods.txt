In the dust when all seems to fade away 
Everything seems peaceful

But it's never quiet

I'm always dragging me down
I've been told I'm mad
And something stirs my heart
I'm wearied down all the time

All the gods they close their eyes in time
But mine they burn like raging fires

My mind is wearied down all the time
I'm wearied down all the time
