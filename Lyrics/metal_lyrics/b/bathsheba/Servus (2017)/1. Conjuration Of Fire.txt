(Oh, my father
Lord of Silence, supreme God of Desolation
Though mankind reviles yet aches to embrace
Strengthen my purpose to save the world from a second ordeal and Jesus Christ
And his grubby, mundane greed)

Wandering in stillness 
Covering the pages 
Ancient secret 

Conjuring the madness 
Breathing in the fire 
Carving symbols 

Will they know us, when we come 
Key of Wisdom 

Worshiping the grandeur
Summoning the Seven 
with a whisper 

Honoring the being 
Crying out the power 
Supreme virtue 

Will they know us, when we come 
Key of Wisdom 

Art of chaos 
come over me 
I wander endlessly 
Are you the One 
the One for me 
Divided in Earth and Sea 

I whisper thy name 
The Archer remains 

Restless souls an endless claim 
We all must die, and end in pain 

Art of chaos 
come over me 
I wander endlessly 
Are you the One 
the One for me 
Divided in Earth and Sea 

Art of chaos, come over me 

(The soul leaves us and goes into another,
altering it and conjuring the fire)
