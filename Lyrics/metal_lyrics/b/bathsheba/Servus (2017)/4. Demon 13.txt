Have I harvested, what I've sowed? 
Smelling the lilies and seeing the carcass 
I will put them to sleep 
Tonight, I will put them to sleep 

Stars will shine 
On the Archer 
Slit the wrists 
Bite the throat 

Feel my fingers 
Clutching 
See my eyes 
Burning 

It's all a lie 

I talk to them demons 
I have been shown the way 
Wandering and lost 
They will come to stay (oh yeah)

I might be lost forever 
I might be gone 
I might see the sun 

Where hereafter will belong 

Singing to the sun 
Singing to my son 
Weeping his song 

Purge me with poison 
And I shall be cleansed 

That my desired end may be effected
Through Thy strength

The conjuration of fire
I am who dignified 

And when I comprehend
The speech that was made unto me
I understood 
That in me was the knowledge of all creatures
And no man is equal to me
