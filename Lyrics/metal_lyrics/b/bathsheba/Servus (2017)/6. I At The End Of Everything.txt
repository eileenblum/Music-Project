Behold us 
This life is pain 

Blood, it hurts 
This life is pain 

Open your eyes 
Open your mind 
Am I to wander, Highest Mind 

Open your mind 
Open your eyes 
Am I to wander, Highest Mind 

This life is pain 
This life is pain 

Behold us 
This life is pain 

Blood, it hurts 
This life is pain 

Open your mind 
Open your eyes
Am I to wander, Highest Mind 


Open your eyes
Open your mind
Am I to wander, Highest mind 

Creeping delirium
Place your knife upon the earth
I wonder, who am I 

Behold us again 
Remember my name when you rise 
The symbols of God 
Now and forevermore 

And by the virtue of the Highest One 
I command Thee 
To perfect the Creation 
Make me myself again 
Universe tremble again 
You who is worthy of all praise

(Show man instead the raptures of thy kingdom
Infuse in him the grandeur of melancholy
The divinity of loneliness
The purity of evil
The paradise of pain)
