My Beloved One, 

Come into me 
I want You to come 
into my soul 

The hours 
awaiting 
make us numb 

Deliver us from all the pain 

I am the Malicious One 
Hated by all 
but One 

Eternal Shade 
come inside me 

Take the torch 
Let's burn 

The Knowledge 
within the Eternal One 
I am invincible now your name is known to me 

Deliver us from all the pain 

I am the Malicious One 
Hated by all 
but One 

Eternal Shade 
come inside me 

Take the torch 
Let's burn 

The Knowledge 
within the Eternal One 
I am invincible now your name is known to me
