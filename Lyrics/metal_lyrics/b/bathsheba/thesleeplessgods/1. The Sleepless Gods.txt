In the dust
When all seems to fade away
Everything seems peaceful
But it's never quiet
I'm always dragging me down
I've been told I'm mad
And something stirs, in my heart
I'm wearied down, all the time

I'm wearied down all the time

All the gods
They close their eyes
In time
But mine, they burn
Like raging fires
My mind, is wearied down, all the time

I'm wearied down all the time
