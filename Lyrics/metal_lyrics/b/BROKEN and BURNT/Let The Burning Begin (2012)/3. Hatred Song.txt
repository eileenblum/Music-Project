Hate you, hate it
Hate this shit
Hate your words, hate your ways
Hate my words 
Hate my ways

I fucking hate myself
I fucking hate you MORE.
Just know how to

Hate, down my spine
Hate, raging wounds
Stuck in my soul
All I know is 
Hate is in control

Name it
Blame it
Fake it
Hate!
Hate to lose
Hate your days
Throw away

I fucking hate myself
I fucking hate you MORE.
Just know how to

Hate, down my spine
Hate, raging wounds
Stuck in my soul
All I know is
Hate is in control
