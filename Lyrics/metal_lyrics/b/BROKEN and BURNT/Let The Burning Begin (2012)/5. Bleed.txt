You see the world
Through images you flinch
Hide away, as if there was nowhere to go

But try not to bleed...

You see the world
Through eyes long unsure
Run away, as if there was no way to go

But try not to bleed
And you'll fail again and again

As you feel it running down
Nothing is better than the look in your eyes
The fear in your eyes
The crown has hit the ground
Sorrow is saving me from the taste of your mouth
Words from your mouth

Try not bleed
And you'll fail again and again
