Sure you look cool
Your Skin is brand new
You know how to be in control
No chances you waste
An ultimate ass you've got

You're the bait I won't bite
You're the bait â The one I won't bite

Lighting soon
A hell of time will be through
Who and how will you be?
Probably out of tune &amp; fading away
A picture is all that you've got

You're the bait I won't bite
You're the bait â The one I won't bite

I can see you 
Can see you growing
Growing stronger Day by Day
I can see you
Can see your life
You life crumbling minute by minute

I can see no way out
I can see no coming backs
i can see no compromise
But I can see, yeah, the day that you'll die!
