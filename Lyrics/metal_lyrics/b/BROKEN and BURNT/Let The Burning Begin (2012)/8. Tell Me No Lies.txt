Tell Me No Lies,
I wanna hear it straight from your mouth
What's gone and how things are now
I wanna hear it, hear it all
Before I take my steps into the falling part of my new life
The new part of my life

Again I'm alright
Another lie I tell straight into night
Before I have another shot of liquor on ice
I wanna leave it, leave it all
There's more to it than just saying out loud 
That everything shall pass

You're trying to be...
Keep trying to make me believe...
Keep trying to be what you're not
What you're not
What you're not

I don't believe a word you say
Just can't get hold of any of them 
All Trust is gone but yours
Burying yourself yet rejected by the ground
