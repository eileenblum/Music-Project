I ride alone on the saddles of freedom
I speak the truth
Damage won't be undone

"Right" or "wrong"
Two places to roam
Wait for no one
That's what I've become

Face the truth,
Your eyewitness failed
To tell you the truth about me
Maybe life's a false start
Not for me.
Swallow the facts, now.

We break, we burn
We break then we burn it all

Ashes on trays
Aces on games
Alcohol in veins
Go insane
Breaking and Burning
Breaking and Burning
