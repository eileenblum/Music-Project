Something else is coming for you
Smarter and screwed
That's your business
Going against the 

Whole World alone
Just looking for more
Busted lips drain
You've got a broken bloody nose

My short-sighted solution
It leads to your
Your destruction

Biased opinions
Always come from without

With no bullets in the gun
Where are you from?
Good riddance
Busted lips drain
You've got a broken bloody nose

My shortsighted solution
Is your destruction
