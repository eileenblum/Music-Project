Yesterday I felt just dead
I wish I weren't there
Thoughts of failure 
That I couldn't make it
Like a thousand times before

Those down shall rise,
Those on the top shall fall to ground
âCause every dog has its day
Yours is gone

I'm not where I should be
I'm not who I should ever be
You're not where we should be
We're not what we see
"WE" are not âcause "we" are over

But! Those down shall rise,
Those on the top shall fall to ground
âCause every dog has its day
Yesterday's Gone!
