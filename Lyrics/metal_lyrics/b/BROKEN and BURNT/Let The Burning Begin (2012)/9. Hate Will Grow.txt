My chest will explode
But before that I'll throw all my HATE into YOU !

You don't know, what you do
You don't know, what to say
You're down below this floor I've been treading around for years

You don't know, What you are
You don't know, what to be
If it's about what to do, what to do about me

You've gotta bleed inside
A bloody rising tide
It'll overflow
And then my HATE WILL GROW

An Insect, that's what you are
You'll feel my boots when I step on you
You'll never be gone
Your prison is home
