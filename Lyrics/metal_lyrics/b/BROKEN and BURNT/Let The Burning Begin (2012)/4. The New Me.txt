As older as I get
There's less &amp; less regret
As nasty as it gets
My life is
Reproving me
Failing me
Remembering me
Of all I was

That I no longer am
That I no longer have
Welcoming THE NEW ME

As painful as it gets
As weaker as it gets
As numb as it gets
I feel like resetting it all
Ending it all
Forgetting it all
Yet keeping it all

The two sided-me 
Meets the unforeseen part of myself
Along with all I was
That I no longer am
That I no longer have
