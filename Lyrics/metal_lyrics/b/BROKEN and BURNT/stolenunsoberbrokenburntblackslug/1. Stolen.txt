Stolen
Everything went missing from me
Stolen
Every single piece of what I

Never really cared
Never really gave a fuck
About it all
Never really cared
Never really gave a fuck
About it all
About it all

Driven
Everyone disappointed but me
Beaten
The wrong door of a goddamn place I

Never really cared
Never really gave a fuck
About it all
Never really cared
Never really gave a 'fuck'
About it all

The touch of my hands won't rearrange a thing
'Til nothing's left
And there's nothing more for you
For you to steal
