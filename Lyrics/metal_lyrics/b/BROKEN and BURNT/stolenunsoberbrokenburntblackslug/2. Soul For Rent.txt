Never had a single possession
Never ever had a name
I've been only playing the devil
Guess life was supposed to be a game

And I never had a decent job
I've always had my bills to pay
'cos I never 'been just one in the mob, baby
It's something that I have to say

Got no money
But used to have peace
Got no worries
You've put me down on my knees

I've got a soul for rent
To pay my bills and not fall in this bend
I've got a soul for rent
I'm sorry to tell ya, but this is not the end

Never ever felt regrets
Never ever felt no pain
I've always have made my own tracks
Didn't waste my time in vain

Life's gave me a slap in the face
But I'm not gonna lose this race
I now regret those tears on my face
Won't be like a mouse in a maze

Got no money
But used to have peace
Got no worries
You've put me down on my knees

I've got a soul for rent
To pay my bills and not fall in this bend
I've got a soul for rent
Sorry to tell ya, but this is not the...

Not the end of my life 'cos I'm gonna get through
Not end of my crimes with or without you
It's the end of a cycle and I ain't gettin' blue
The end of my times...
