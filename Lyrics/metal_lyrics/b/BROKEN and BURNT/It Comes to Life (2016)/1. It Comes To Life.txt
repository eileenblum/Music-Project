[Volume I]

Feel down
Death struck my own surround
Lost the one I loved and all I left behind

It comes to life
Through my hands
And it feels like dying
Failure

The bitterness of disappointment, hell to be
I seek shelter from the wretch within me

And I'll never understand my deeds
Sickness, fear and misfortune
Brought you to the living
Filthy demons rise
