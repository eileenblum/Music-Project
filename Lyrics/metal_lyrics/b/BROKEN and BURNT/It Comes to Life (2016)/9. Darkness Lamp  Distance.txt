Good-bye dear friends seems my time took its toll
This one is not alive
Confusion lies in the darkness within
Laughter, cancer of mind

I got so tired
Be not so surprised
By the sense of life
When itâs taken away

How many times have we began anew held in a prison of mind?
How many times will we run from our own tides?

Waiting so long
