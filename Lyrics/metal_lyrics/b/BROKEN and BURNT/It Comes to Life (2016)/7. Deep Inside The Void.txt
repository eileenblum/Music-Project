[Volume III]

Iâm walking down the stairs to where I feel I belong
Iâm sinking fast into the waters I once found joy

Drown deep inside the void
Float all across this world

Iâm opening both eyes to all the sides inside of this
This odd sensation in which my bones have turned to ashes

One try (fading out)
One ride (into nowhere)
One lie, written all around here

One kind (empty words)
One god (said alone)
One lie, written all around here
