Don't take it away now
One step closer to freedom as you crawl
Don't get in the way now
For you know how the pain feels

Wonât bring it to light
Wonât create a lie
Wonât open her eyes
I wonât, I wonât

Don't get in the way now
Two steps further from freedom drag you down
Don't get carried away now
Do you know how the pain feels?

I wonât try

The Dead womb locks in silence
Wounded walls that trap the lights in
Stockholm syndrome lets you
Breathe inside of her
