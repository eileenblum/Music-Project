Bestowing animation upon lifeless matter
Giving birth to the unknown
Consequences take control
Bestowing animation upon lifeless matter
I was left aside and my revenge will arise

The work will soon be brought to live
Remarkable this name will be

Distort the product of thy greed
The son whoâll come to life without a seed

Who am I? Lost inside
Who am I but the rest of others?
Who am I but the rejected monster?
Who am I but the lonely wanderer?
Who am I but the one you've forgotten?
The one who'll make you Crawl
