[Volume II]

Disowned, cast aside
Undeniable leprosy
Unborn frozen seed
Led to paralysis
Breathing, all I see is either past or incomplete
Grotesque only son
Feel the nails coming in

Stones blacken the sun
Shedding its skin
Along the way

Hollow accident
Corroded lines in ecstasy
Tasteless apathy
Staring at the unforeseen
