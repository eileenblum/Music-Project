The hills erode, a change of landmarks 
And ancient trees are skinned
Of (leaves) branches and the outer bark
By an ever blowing wind

Its rule and strength lead the rise and fall
Insects drift along the sweeping regime
At mountainous locations massive rainfall
Still, birds follow their inner scheme

From the polar cyclone
A timeless and transparent grindstone
And by the trade winds of the equator
The air flow builds a subtropical gyrator

The hills erode, a change of landmarks 
And ancient trees are skinned
Of (leaves) branches and the outer bark
By an ever blowing wind

From the polar cyclone
A timeless and transparent grindstone
Pressure is high but the sun angle is low
Dominant winds

Pressure is high but the sun angle is low
Dominant winds scalp the ridge's crest
Cooling and condensation grows
It hauls from the north and heads from east to west

We're strapped in this blusterous maze
Still unaware of its daily toil
We'll get a glimpse of its power and pace
As we're standing on degraded soil

From the polar cyclone
A timeless and transparent grindstone
And by the trade winds of the equator
The air flow builds a subtropical gyrator
