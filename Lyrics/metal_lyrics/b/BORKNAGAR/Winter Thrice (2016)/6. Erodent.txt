The trails of existence thrust into the future
A future that crumbles, riddance by revulsion 
Woven roots uphold the ground, earthly bound
The ground we walk, the ground we fought

Rivers drift into eternity, draining the potency
The endless maze, the blinding haze
Shimmering uphold the course
(the plains we scour, the plains we tear)

Waves that rave the coastal line
Rain that reaps the breeding soil
Wind that pierces the heart of man 
The fire that burns all creatures around 

The trails of existence, entwined through history 
Eras that passed in degenerative haste
Grind the roots, withering grounds
The ground we walked, the ground we fought

Waves that rave the coastal line
Rain that reaps the breeding soil
Wind that pierces the heart of man 
The fire that burns all creatures around 
The ground we walked, the ground we fought 

A past that holds the dawn of man
A march that crumbles stones to sand
The vast exploration, the last ravage
The prodigies of ruination

Erodent
A past that holds the dawn of man
Erodent
A march that crumbles stones to sand
The trails of existence, entwined through history

Waves that rave the coastal line
Rain that reaps the breeding soil
Wind that pierces the heart of man 
The fire that burns all creatures around
