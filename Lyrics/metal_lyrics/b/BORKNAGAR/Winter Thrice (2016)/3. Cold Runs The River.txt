Cold runs the river
Warm runs my blood
The old signs quiver 
And my mind mountain releases a flood

A life nerve in a barren era 
Raised in the heat of the sun 
I drink its potion from well and caldera 
Through earth-veins it flows, forming a canyon 

Ice draped rocks, flesh cover bones
The cabals of eternity burn in the night
As the watercourse that rinses all stones 
Unify my path with the river site

Cold runs the river
Warm runs my blood

Groundwater recharge, blood pumping heart
Circulation systems refined
Streams of wonder, where my torrent starts
Time and motion aligned

Ice draped rocks, flesh cover bones
The cabals of eternity burn in the night
As the watercourse that rinses all stones 
Unify my path with the river site

As the river of time and nature's crown
Face season's last breath and the final exploration

Cold runs the river
Warm runs my blood
The old signs quiver 
And my mind mountain releases a flood

As the river of time and nature's crown
Face season's last breath and the final exploration

Ice draped rocks, flesh cover bones
The cabals of eternity burn in the night
