Inner landscapes provide the ground for structures
Development plans, architectural design 
nature in it's purest form, the very idea of being alive
Intuitions feeds the progression

Read me, decipher every word
Then multiply the dormant issues 
Just tear me down, then build me up again
Accentuate, proliferate, recreate

Vines and trees, new species on cultivated grounds
Planned sequences and astonishing leaps
Everything grows, everything dies
Everything regenerates, slightly altered

Blueprints come in three letter systems
Inside repeats the outside repeats the inside
The distance between what we see and how we see it
A perpetual cycle of adjustments

Read me, decipher every word
Then multiply the dormant issues 
Just tear me down, then build me up again
Accentuate, proliferate, recreate

Echoes of what was
Resound in what is
Between organic structures
And inside them
