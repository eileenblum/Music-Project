A long gone presence unfolds
through the eye of the winter eclipse
Where the moments of history hold
the shadows of a vast ancestral cast

This path walked by generations
eroded by man, illuminated by the Sun
Ancestors and fathers, as fathers and sons
the everlasting continuance

Of time, space and diversity
the bias of cosmic regency
manifested by the vast complexity

The winter seasons, the pain of sorrow
The fallacy of chaos, the emptiness of hollow
The cogency of reason, the reversion of future
The maze of evolution, the ways of elucidation

Ruinous and regenerative
the hive of an oscillating existence
Resounds through the halls of silence
rebounds under the dome of origin

Ruinous and regenerative
the hive of an oscillating existence

Of time, space and diversity
the bias of cosmic regency
manifested by the vast complexity
through the winter eclipse

This path walked by generations
eroded by man, illuminated by the Sun
Ancestors and fathers, as fathers and sons
the everlasting continuance

A long gone presence unfolds
through the eye of the winter eclipse
Where the moments of history hold
the shadows of a vast ancestral cast
