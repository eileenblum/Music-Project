The impact of meteor collisions
sprays rock over desert sand
I've seen the subversion changing our conditions
in the wildfire that scorches the land

A region flooded by horizontal cataracts
drowning in the debris flow
A force that despoils every human artifact
the deep and the shallow

Chains of extinction
in disruption's primordial hall
I hear the roaring legion
of ocean waves, trumpeting the downfall

I taste the salt, the seasoning of time
and smell the smoke of lightning's clime

Chains of extinction
in disruption's primordial hall
I hear the roaring legion
of ocean waves

A sudden cloudburst mounts the sky
lashing the shores of hope
I feel the arctic cold
as the elemental hazard
unfolds...

Years turn to decades, centuries to an era
A worldwide crisis opening its caldera

Chains of extinction
in disruption's primordial hall
I hear the roaring legion
of ocean waves, trumpeting the downfall
