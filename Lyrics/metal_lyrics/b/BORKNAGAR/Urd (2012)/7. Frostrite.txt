Moving through fields
away from the great sea
up to the barren and cold

The wind gathers might
as the last trees passes out of sight
I plunge into the blight

Frozen landscape
see me, feel me
Awe strikes where even the air bites
and ice ceaselessly survives

Blue shades on white
announcing the rite taking place here tonight
Fading to black then explode in attack
hits the blazing northern lights

Spellbound I fight
the chaos, the colors painted in flight
And I watch and I sink in the snow but in spite
of this call from the other side I rise

My mind at ease
war harvest peace
Blood, fire
death cannot freeze

My father's gods
grant wisdom and odds
this is their gift through the bond

A spearhead, a zeal
I know what is real
to no one, nowhere I kneel

Frozen landscape
touch me, heal me
Awe strikes where even the air bites
and ice ceaselessly survives
