[Limited Edition Digipack Bonus Track]Through the wind of inquisitiveness, 
A total view travels the ray of nature's benevolence 
From the nest of fragments wholeness once flew
To set out a striking confluence

Where eye meet the biospheres ability
Chaos and order shaded by equilibrium
In coherence with progression's liberty
to form an intrinsic dictum

The practice of the mountain
A symbolic father and volcanic fountain
Refined by time and knowledge 
A tower for future generations
Illuminating the age of creation
As we build a world with mind, hand and heritage

Until we mount the philosophical throne
Bowing to the lords of this ecotone

Where a chaotic substance condenses into solid black
An old servant in the play of havoc 
Painting land over craters grounding
A creator now numb by man's eager pounding

The prominent pillars, the pyramidal peaks
Map impressions in the chamber of exploration
And keep them safe from a sun to bleach
sculpting inner elevation

The practice of the mountain
A symbolic father and volcanic fountain
Refined by time and knowledge
A tower for future generations
Illuminating the age of creation
