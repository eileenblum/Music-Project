Behold the northern plains
the entwined wintry mountains
Seasons of the cold, haven of the bold
the greatest column, the bearer of the sky

The winds are stirring and blurring
the seditious omen of erosion
A frozen spear of disharmony
the shattering yet celestial notion

Through the forests, wandering
Through the valleys, hasting
Upon the mountain shoulder, bleeding
The summit, the release of mind

The winds are stirring and blurring
the seditious omen of erosion
A frozen spear of disharmony
the shattering yet celestial notion

The rough side of the mountain
climb the bastion of existence

Hail this mountain, cherish these paths
the vast outskirts, the verge of existence
Where the winds sweep, corrode and explode

Behold the northern plains
Behold the wintry mountains

Hail this mountain, cherish these paths
the vast outskirts, the verge of existence
Where the winds sweep, corrode and explode
The momentum of horizon
the call of Mount Regency
