Concrete cracks, gives way to green
forests fall come glass and steel

The beauty of dead cities
the splendor of nature

Glass framed cities
untamed gardens
Wings in the meadow
asphalt hardens

Everything in its place
the duality of the natural order
An unforgiving faceless warder

Powerful green forces gray away
steel constructions lead life astray

The beauty of dead cities
the splendor of nature

Nature regains its natural place
cities absorb their needed space
The duality of the natural order
