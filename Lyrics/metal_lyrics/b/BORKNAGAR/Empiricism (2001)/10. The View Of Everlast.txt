Great and pounding in its ways
Stirring the roaming cosmic sea
Oceans rise, planets igneous fall
As chaos and beauty in fierce rage

Furious are the storms
Forever its rage carries on
Disintegrating to create, upon fate
Weaving the web of solar cast
Hasting the view of Everlast

Exploding, Imploding
Ascending, Descending
A spear through life and death
Exploding, Imploding
Poised in all chaos' directions
In fierce affection

Spawning the orbs of furious light
My sons of fire, you're children of the storm
Breeder of life, harvester of all
The last breath of the fall

Exploding, Imploding
Ascending, Descending
A spear through life and death
Exploding, Imploding
Poised in all chaos' directions
In fierce affection

Weaving the web of solar cast
Hasting the view of Everlast
