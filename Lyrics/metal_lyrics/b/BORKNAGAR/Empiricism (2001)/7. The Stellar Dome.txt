"Who am I to behold?"

Time revises the existence
Forms the timelessness of substance
Thousand paths of furious chaos
Circles the spine of the universe

All the ways that I have been
All the stars that I have seen

I have seen the haven of eternity
The hive of random universal unions
Expire, expand to extinction
Energized by the primal reflections

Resile the innermost inning
The energetics of the substance
Enframing the salt of existence
The gloat character of the gods

All the ways that I have been
All the stars that I have seen

I have seen the path of eternity
Solid constellations, formations
Sinking, through the black substance
Drifting, swiftly through dimensions

Through...
The Stellar Dome
My haven, my home

Through aeons sterile yet stentorian
I am circling twice my visions
Thrice the bait, dive with faith

Decipher of the immersed profuse
The frequency of foresight
The archetype
Of the stellar dome

[Lyrics by Brun]
