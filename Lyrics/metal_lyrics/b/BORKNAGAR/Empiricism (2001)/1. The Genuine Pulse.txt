The zephyr, the sullen breath
Horizons of history re-erodent
The haven, where the stars are set
Constellations of manifestation
Aglow, expanding through forever

Fall with the rain, rise with the ocean
Drain to expire, the shrine of fertility
Burn as the flame, as strong as it came
Twine the existence, sense the serene
Thousand senses of virtual faction
Existential inputs, prediction of mind
Instinctive, raised to find

As the salt in the sea, burns in me
Forever, the taste in your mouth is I
Eternising the soul-soaked estate
Solvable as fractional fragments

Divine gracious divulgence
Pulse, rotation, the spine of creations
Wane as the circle of zero

As the salt in the sea, burns in me
Forever, the taste in your mouth is I
Eternising the soul-soaked estate
Solvable as fractional fragments

The genuine pulse - the link of a thousand senses
The genuine pulse - entire celestial allegiance
The genuine pulse - dense induce of the indomitable
Never to fail, thus existence I sail
Through the elements of four

The zephyr, the sullen breath
Horizons of history re-erodent
The haven, where the stars are set
Constellations of manifestation
Aglow, expanding through forever

Measure the circle of eternity
The treasure of ability
The Genuine Pulse
