Nature is about to regain
The firm bastion of existence
A circular and furious monument
Of the everlasting remnants of evolution

The winds rove beyond the mountains
Lurking the bate-the delusion of faith
The storm distends,retribution descends
The people of the sham,kneels in shame

Havoc...

As the blood in my veins
Comes around to claim
As the roots of my trails
Come around to tame
The dignity of Nature

The winds rove beyond the mountains
Lurking the bate-the delusion of fate
The storm descends,retribution distends
The mankind of earth,praise the new pagan path

As the blood in my veins
Comes around to claim
As the roots of my trails
Come around to tame
The dignity of Nature

Nature is about to sustain
The evolver of existence
The moment of care and fear
The revolution of evolution

Storm of the millennium, havoc the moment
Rivers unfold, abruptly in deep oceans

A breeze, a storm -havoc

Storm of the millennium, havoc the moment
Rivers unfold, abruptly in deep oceans
