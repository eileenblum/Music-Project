A new dawn is rising
To enlight the ruins of the future
As a distant echo from the past
Circles above , roves of the skyline

Circles above, roves the skyline
Dives into the future cast

Years to come, years that passed
a presence cached by the wind
Woven in reminiscence and mystery
Manifested by the dome of history

Nature strives towards a new dawn
Mankind oppresses, resigns and falls
Into perverted conceitedness

Millions of nights
Millions of days
existence endure through sharpen margins

Thousands of years
Thousands of ways
all paths lead to the final steep fall

Through the brim of the sun
Along the ring of the verge

For a thousand years to come
Comes the autumn, winter, and spring
For a thousand years to come
Comes birth, life, and death

For a thousand years...

For a thousand years to come
Comes birth, life, and death

Nature strives towards a new dawn
Mankind oppresses, resigns and falls
Into perverted conceitedness

Millions of nights
Millions of days
existence endure through sharpen margins

Thousands of years
Thousands of ways
all paths lead to the final steep fall
