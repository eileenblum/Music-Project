There was a time
A time when every moment showed
A place where the symphonies shone
Through branches and leaves
The symphonies of nature...

There was a time
A time when one grew with trees
A place where the seeds were falling
Through branches and leaves
The creation of the Nature...

There is a time
A time when the past returns
A place where winds stir
Through branches and leaves
The dawn of a brighter sun
A disharmonic enclosure

There comes a time
A time when the sun implodes
A place where the current stills
Under the branches and leaves
The moment that ends
The night of eternity descends

The last sunset of my domain...
