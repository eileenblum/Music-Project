[Bonus Track][Lyrics: Ãystein G. Brun]

My everlasting rivers
The breach of symmetry
Empowers the bloodline

The nature and I
Echo's the quake of the entities
The fierce disharmony
Defeats harmony

The river, the course unfolds
Drains the rain, snow and ice

The rock, the sleeping bastion
Cleaves the ice
Dissolves the snow
Divides the rain

The river, the course unfolds
Drains the rain, snow and ice
The summit, the gravity
The steep line of existence

The story of chapters sealed
Monuments never seen
Of coalition and conflict
The river and the rock

The sand, the rock, the ruin
Piles where the winds roar
Frames existence in certainty
The nature and thy
Echoes the quake of the entities
The fierce harmony
Defeated disharmony

The river and the rock

The river, the course unfolding
Drains the rain, snow and ice
The summit, the gravity
The steep line of existence
