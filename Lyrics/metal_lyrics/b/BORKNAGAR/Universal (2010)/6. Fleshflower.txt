White petals
Red lines
Highest heaven
Deepest mines
Vertically green
This is how it's seen

I never thought the world would come to this
I never thought it would come to this

Sturdy feet and arid ground
Dusty shoes and not a sound

Sturdy feet and arid ground
Dusty shoes and not a sound

Soft, red glow
Ever so slow
Never
Near
the flaw
