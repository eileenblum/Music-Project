The principles of the nature
Firm shapes of consistency
A treasury concealed in time
Inevitable, invincible, an axiom

Diversity crafted by evolution
Yet the path of the future is carved in rock
As the horizontal horizon
As the vertical steeps of summits

The master and the apprentice
Forgotten moments in history
Mankind wanders, mountains stand still
The master and the slave
A congregation that never deceives
Mankind dies, havoc never stills

Fire oppose water
Water oppose fire
Earth oppose air
Air oppose earth

The way of the world
The route of existence
Worldwide - mankind's resistance

The way of the world
The route of existence
Worldwide - nature's persistence

Fire oppose water
Water oppose fire

The master and the apprentice
Forgotten moments in history
Mankind wanders, mountains stand still
The master and the slave
A congregation that never deceives
Mankind dies, havoc never stills

Diversity tamed by devolution
With delusion comes confusion
Where the crossroad never crosses
The path circles for all eternity
