The principles of the quintessential four.
Surrounds the inevitable future lore.
Untangle the path of a circular cast.
The symbiosis of earth, air, water and fire.

Soaked by water, a blinding tear.
Nothing to see, nothing to flee.
Burnt by fire, the future I sear.
Everything I'll see, everything I'll be.

Raised by earth, womb of all origin.
Nothing to seed, nothing to breed.
Exhaled by air, puzzle of gaseous spinning.
Everything I'll breathe, everything I'll feed.

Midst of the parallax, I mirror the illuminations.
Fall, rise and further evolution.
Midst of the parallax, the maze of illustrations.
Fall, rise and fatal conclusion.

Soaked by water, a blinding tear.
Nothing to see, nothing to flee.
Burnt by fire, the future I sear.
Everything I'll see, everything I'll be.

The principles of the essential four.
Strengthen and bond, the core.
Tangles the math of a circular cast.
The erosion of earth, air, water and fire.

Omnifarious - earth.
Omnipresence - air.
Omnipotence - water.
Omnivorous - fire.
Ominous for the omniscient.

Soaked by water, a blinding tear.
Nothing to see, nothing to flee.
Burnt by fire, the future I sear.
Everything I'll see, everything I'll be.

Raised by earth, womb of all origin.
Nothing to seed, nothing to breed.
Exhaled by air, puzzle of gaseous spinning.
Everything I'll breathe, everything I'll feed.
