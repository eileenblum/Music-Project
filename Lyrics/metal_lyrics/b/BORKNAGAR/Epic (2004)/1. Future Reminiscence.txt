The mysteries of a hidden past.
Precession of the planetary relations.
Cosmology, a linear or circular cast?
Restitution of a genuine consciousness.
Return to the haven of the first and the last.

Beware, stare towards the horizon new.
Sear, tear the sensation of distant propinquity.

Through the secret moments I flew.
As one among the very few.

The everlasting zero, a glimpse of a million.
The forever million, yet a ubiquitous presence.
Coronate the path of the Gods, the Elder.

I am a remnant of the forever origin.
I am the soul of every phantom fallen.
I am rising as I am falling, silent as calling.

"The precise prelude of the cataclysm".
Apocalyptic visions of the future fall.
The aberrant taste of the conceiving past.
As a slave of the next moment of presence.
The ones among the very few.

Restitution - summons the sight.
Emancipation - circles in presence.
Renunciation - for a new era to enlighten.
