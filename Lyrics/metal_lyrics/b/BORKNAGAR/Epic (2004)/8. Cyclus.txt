I am soon to reach the pith.
My spherical vile so sacred.
Engendering the divine fusion.
Visions of emerging stars.
I am about to stake my stance.
Fly above the precluding fence.
The cosmic feast I am to gasp.
To honour the divine cast.

Cyclus - frames the core of the causes.
Circle - the way of the forces.
Gods, I am here to prevail.
End the subsequent existence.
The resound of thousand tales.
Hear the call, stirring the fall.

Reinstate the lurid, lunar existence.
The renaissance of primal founders.
Stamina, the retrace of revival.
Synergy of entire universal courses.
Energy of the stellar host.

Cyclus - frames the core of the causes.
Circle - the way of the forces.
Gods, I am here to prevail.
End the subsequent existence.
The resound of thousand tales.
Hear the call, stirring the fall.

Gods, I am here to be and become.
Combine the rotating sequence.
Trig the fall of the presence.
Here the call, stirring the fall.
