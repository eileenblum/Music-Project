Algae and plankton sporadically rinsed up effectively.
Seaweed clad naked continents in green veils.
From stardust constructions, cells elusively.
Rearranged the scenery in numerous scales.

A primitive organism, predecessor of mutations.
Along the evolutionary ladder crawled ashore.
In water transformed during thousand generations.
Then made its debut on the primary action floor.

Still its ensemble accumulates our presence.
The expression of oceans lurk inside.

The building block, water, is our essence.
We're like a moving, perpendicular, biological tide.
Salt spices blood, sweat and tears.
As the bodily recipe's most essential grain.
Due to the wave creator, Heart, pulsation rears.
As rivers through what anatomy calls veins.

And limestone-white structures hold our marrow.
As in marine animals that swim free.
(But we're) separated, through tiny variations along time's
arrow.
Unknown to the fetus in the Amniotic Sea.
The quintuple man, the five senses division.
Add two for the number of world's oceans.
And two hidden gene threads may fulfil that vision.
Intuition and instinct create the seven faceted motion.
Particles that once streamed astray.
Now form the basis in our DNA.
Salt spices blood, sweat and tears.
As the bodily recipe's most essential grain.
Due to the wave creator, Heart, pulsation rears.
As rivers through what anatomy calls veins.
