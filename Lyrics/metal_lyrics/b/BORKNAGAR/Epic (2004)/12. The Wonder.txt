Celebration of life in all its forms.
The visionary scope of wonders.
Confluent and figural scenery.
The resilient existence of the past.

As a drone of the inevitable progress.
The carrier that breach the horizon.
I see the winter all summer through.
Moments inducing the way and sight.

Dark is the astray, as the olden domain.
Illumine the wonder new.
Spiritual moraine, a phantom brew.
The wonder - of the solar/lunar peak.

Through the glimpse of the moments.
Query presence of celestial wisdom.
Mirrors summoning fires igniting.
Fires inducing the day and light.

I see the winter all summer through.
Moments inducing the way and sight.
The path I have chosen is the spring of you.
A wonder ignites, ahead, towards infinity.
Welcome!
