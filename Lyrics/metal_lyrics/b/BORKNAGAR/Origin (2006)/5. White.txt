Again
The empty room
White and unmarked,
though touched
With a sensible structure
Underneath the surface
Hiding in the corner of the eye
Or resting right outside the field of vision
No doors or windows
No entrances or exits
Only bright light
Forming a shining empire
Of electrical impulses
Never to leave the premises
Never to be caught
Only sensed

[Lars A. Nedland, February 2005]
