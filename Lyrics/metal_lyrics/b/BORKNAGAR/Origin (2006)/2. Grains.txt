The grains of my solid roots
Go deep into the youth of existence
They mirror the path of my forefathers
Through the winter way alone
To mount and rove- to evolve

As the sun, the very one
Enlightened the road I found
Along the grains of ages
The roots of my being
Projects all that you are seeing...
