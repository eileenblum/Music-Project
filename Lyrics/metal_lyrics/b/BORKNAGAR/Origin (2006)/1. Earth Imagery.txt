Amongst the elements, I surrender on eternity's behalf
The soil on which I walk, the air in which I talk
The drop I swallowed, the fire I followed
- is the circling direction of time, the vague line of existence

The earth defines my synergy, the mountains refines me energy
The fire clouds my distant view, the flame erupts my fiery due
To Mother Earth

The ocean mirrors my purpose, the rain affirms my goals
The air shrouds my presence, the wind reveals my existence

[Oystein G. Brun, January 2005]
