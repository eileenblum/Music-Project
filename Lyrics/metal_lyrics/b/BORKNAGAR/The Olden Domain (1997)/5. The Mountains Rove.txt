I came from the utter fields
Carving shame on the tender shields
On my path I wandered high
Acknowledged beneath the sky
The hate I carried, recalling why!

I walked towards the rising Autumn
And cursed the summer
with the promise of a Winter
Where my foes will quiver in frost
A circling saga, not forever lost

I came from the utter fields
Carving shame on the tender shields
On my path I wandered high
Declaring war beneath the sky
The hate I carried, boiling within!

I mounted all the hills my eyes could count
And roved wherever the sun escaped sight

I drifted from the deepest tarn
Till I saw my saw my name in aruinic sign
Graven so deep in the crystal bark
Of a lodge I sojourned years ago

Crying war beneath the sky
