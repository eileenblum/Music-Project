Awakened by a thumping heart growing in his chest
Impulse of generations free sounding in on men
Calling him all ready

To climb the peaks to reach the sun
To rise above
To rise above
To climb the peaks to reach the sun
To rise above
To rise above

There's a time a time for all
No man's in memory
Eyes are glowing
Life and possibility
Wild father's heart

There is a time a time for all
To rise above
To rise above
There is a time a time for all
To rise above
To rise above

Reason and reverence
Lot of flowing him and knows who follows
Wild father's heart
Driven by natures excellence

Wild father's
Wild father's heart

There is a time a time for all
To rise above
To rise above
There is a time a time for all
To rise above
To rise above
