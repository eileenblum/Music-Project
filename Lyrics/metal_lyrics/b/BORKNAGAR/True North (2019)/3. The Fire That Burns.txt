The fire that burns
The light that governs the heat
Igniting the passion, the eternal appetite
For things to come
For thoughts to create
The independent nature of man
A creator and destroyer
Deeply rooted, widely spread
The will to strive, the need to push
Fire, fire that burns
Fire, fire that burns
The spark that glimmers
So that visions appear in a flash
The independent nature of man
A creator and destroyer
Deeply rooted, widely spread
The will to strive, the need to push
Fire, fire that burns
Fire, fire that burns
The adventures of the mind
And the conquest of the flesh
That glimmers so that visions appear in a flash
Initiating the chain reaction
Culminating in the very fuel
That drives us on
Independent nature of man
Of man
The will to thrive, the will to leap
Above the highest, the highest peak
The will to thrive, the will to leap
The will to swim
Beneath the deep
Fire
Fire that burns
The adventures of the mind
And the conquest of the flesh
