Mankind's constructed fallacy
Aggressively upheld a reality
Fit for an age without questions
But these constructions of delusion now crumble
A new complexity rises
Violently force themselves
Into stagnant waters of old
As progression descends
Serving us evolution on a plate
Mankind's infancy is over (over)
Our vision is finally clear
Man derives from the great old blue
From mankind's disavowal
Grew confusion, grew delusion
In a haze
From human curiosity and logic
Reason and clarity are born
Fashioned worlds corrode
Bewilderment of old
We've reached the summit
The zenith of our mountain
And the clouds of delusion
Are finally beneath us
Mount rapture crumbles
Stale ignorance implodes
Reality shines through
Mankind's constructed fallacy
Aggressively upheld a reality
Fit for an age without questions
But these constructions of delusions now crumble
Fashioned worlds corrode
Bewilderment of old
