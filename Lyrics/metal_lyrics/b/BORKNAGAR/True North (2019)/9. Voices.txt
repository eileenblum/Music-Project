There are voices in the air
There are voices in the air
They always find me - oh they find me
No matter where I go

There are voices in my head
There are voices in my head
They won't leave me - never leave me
No matter where I go

There are chains now in the field
There are chains now in the field
There's no freedom - no freedom
There's no freedom in the field

There are voices in the air
They always find me in the air
There are voices - oh there are voices
No matter where I go

There are voices in my head
There are voices in my head
They won't leave me
They won't leave me
No matter where I go

And there are chains now in the field
Yes there are chains now in the field
So there's no freedom, no freedom
There's no freedom in the field

There are voices in the air
There are voices in the air
They always find me oh yes they find me
No matter where I go

I will lay there in the field
Without voices in the air
When I finally draw my last breath
I will lay there in the field

When I finally stop to breathe
When I finally stop to breathe
All the voices, all the voices
Will only linger in the field
Will only linger in the field
Will only linger in the field
