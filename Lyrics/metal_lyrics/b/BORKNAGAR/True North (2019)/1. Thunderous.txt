Up high and far away, where the air is clear
A vast horizon shimmers
The cold wind seems to carry the light away
As the earth's rotation closes the day
Beyond the towering peaks
Recurring shadows bow deep
Into the raging rivers
Beyond the towering peaks
Recurring shadows bow deep
Into the raging rivers
The ground runs cold and hard
Throughout the dark seasons
The ebb and flow of growth and regression
Seasons build, seasons tear down
The northern hammer
Keeps beating, beating
Hear the echoes rumble
Hear the echoes rumble
Beyond the towering peaks
Recurring shadows bow deep
Into the raging rivers
Into the raging rivers
Beyond the towering peaks
Recurring shadows bow deep
Into the raging rivers
The ground runs cold and hard
Throughout the dark seasons
Roots grow deep in order to keep
Clinging to the gusty plains
The wind hushes the earth to sleep
The ebb and flow of growth and regression
Seasons build, seasons tear down
The northern hammer
Keeps beating, beating
Beating, beating
Hear the echoes rumble
Across the thunderous sky
Summers reveal, winters conceal
The thunderous sky oversees it all
Up north and far away, where the air is clear
Vast horizons call
The mighty force of winter
Shapes a merciless scenery
Throughout the dark seasons
Roots grow deep to keep
Earth to sleep
