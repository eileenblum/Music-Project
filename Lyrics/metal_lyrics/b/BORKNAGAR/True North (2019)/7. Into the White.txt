They left it all behind
Crawling through the snow
Every peak a spear piercing the sky
In the twilight glow
Into the blinding white
Swallowed them whole
The freezing wind drained them of all life
Then left them cold
Cold
Life in a flash of red
Pushing the white death
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Heat is white and they can not find their way
Back into reason, into their lives
Into the white
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
Hear them calling you (Floating in the white)
When there's nothing left to save
But an empty shell
You sink into the white
You sink into the white
Into the white
Into the nothingness
White
Into the nothingness
White
Into the nothingness
White
Into the nothingness
So the winter finally brought them home
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
Into the white
