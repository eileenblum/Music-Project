When the dotted lights
Crawl like bugs
On the canvas high above
All I love
And the answer's in my sheets
I forget about tomorrow
And my sorrow
Leave it to the great painter
To open the world and my mind
In the morning light
Leave it to my mind
In the morning light
In the morning light
The air vibrates
With awareness
So now that you see me
A servant in the snow
And now that you hear me
I broke free long ago
I took the world and broke it up
To force it down
I picked the pieces up
And wore them like a crown
And the light shone through forever
And the sky would never hold
And my light shone through forever
And the sky would never hold
So now that you see me
A servant in the snow
And now that you hear me
I broke free long ago
My heroes
They all died so long ago
My heroes
They all died so long ago
To expand on his creation
I took the world and broke it up
To force it down
I picked the pieces up
And wore them like a crown
And the light shone through forever
And the sky would never hold
(No, it would never hold)
And my light shone through forever
And the sky would never hold
Leave it to the great painter
To open up my mind
And leave it to me
To expand on his creation
My heroes
They all died so long ago
My heroes
They all died so long ago
Freedom exists on a greater scale
Freedom exists on a greater scale
Freedom exists on a greater scale
Freedom exists
