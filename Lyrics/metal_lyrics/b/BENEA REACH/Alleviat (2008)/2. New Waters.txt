Those calm hollow waves
We embraced, held silence.
Deserted seas surrounded us all
until we raised sails towards new oceans.
From lifeless waves to shining days.

You and I conquered new waters
We emerged, we made this moment.
All the lies, beyond and erased
What remains is pure and solid.
There is nothing here that will harm us, no more.
Rain or shine creates no difference
You and I, we will maintain.

Like every sail lives for new winds
my soul never ceases to move with you.
Deserted seas never fill the needs
that unite us here, nevermore alone.

You and I conquered new waters
We emerged, we made this moment.
All the lies, beyond and erased
What remains is pure and solid.
There is nothing here that will harm us, no more.
Rain or shine creates no difference
You and I, we will maintain.

You and I conquered new waters
We emerged, we made this moment.
All the lies, beyond and erased
What remains is pure and solid.
There is nothing here that will harm us, no more.
Rain or shine creates no difference
You and I, we will maintain.

You and I conquered new waters
We emerged, we made this moment.
All the lies, beyond and erased
What remains is pure and solid.
There is nothing here that will harm us, no more.
Rain or shine creates no difference,
we emerged to a new beginning.
