Two sets of footprints,
close to each other on the ground.
Together forever.
Nothing seems and nothing feels
impossible anymore.

Arms wide open
to everything that the future will bring.

Time takes us further without fear,
without dread of tomorrow.
Never alone, never.
No, we will never be alone.
Distances can never keep us apart.

Two hearts beating as one,
so close no matter how far.

Time takes us further without fear,
without dread of tomorrow.
Never alone, never,
no, we will never be.

Time takes us further without fear,
without dread of tomorrow.
Never alone, never,
no, we will never be alone

Unexplainable two-way emotion,
unconditional devotion.
Naked confession of love and affection,
of our love I will sing.

You and me, always.
You and me,
it feels like even more than it sounds like.

Unexplainable two-way emotion,
unconditional devotion.
Naked confession of love and affection,
of our love I will sing...

...and scream!
