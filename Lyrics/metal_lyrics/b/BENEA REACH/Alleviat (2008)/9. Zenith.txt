And again your beauty shines in silhouettes,
carries me to the rest,
where venom turns to grace
and teardrops to seas.

I carry the marks of your shining inside of me.
Your presence amplifies my need to be.
I breathe, I hear, I feel, I see
and I reach zenith, that redesigns everything.

Sense it all closing in,
of all moments, this is it.
Gain my strength to elevate away from nadir
Sense it all near.

I carry the words of your whisper inside of me.
Your presence amplifies my need to be.
I breathe, I hear, I feel, I see
and I reach zenith, that redesigns everything.

Your beauty shines in silhouettes,
carries me to the rest
where venom turns to grace
and teardrops reshape to seas of tranquility.

Silhouettes carries me to the rest
where venom turns to grace and teardrops to seas.

Sense it all closing in,
of all moments, this is it
Gain my strength to elevate away from nadir.
The time has come to shine,
from nadir to zenith.
