Eyes, I lionize eyes that uphold just,
that see deeper beyond.
Seek the honest, devote assistance
to the wounded and the naked.
Pure devotion overwhelms the hollow actions
that limit pure ambitions to prevail.
Lionize eyes that see.

Shape me to master, surround me to feel.
Armour the foundation, rebuild on solid ground.

Master, surround me to feel.
Armour the foundation,

Sow the new in me, something that will remain
Spread your shine and let it rain again.

All, I lionize all that unfolds just,

Hollow, distorted,
I lionize all that seeks.
