Be here my all, my reason.
Carry me to the nest, where I can rest
and find the lost and erased.

Belong with me, my warrior,
armour me inside your wings.
Close within, embrace me to rest.

For I know your wings reach fields far from here,
and you show your heart bleeds for me
now and again.

Be here my all, my reason.
Carry me to the nest, where I can rest
and find the lost and erased.

Take me to the place where I should be,
let me feel your heart beat inside of me.
Help me understand the words that you speak,
then I know that I will find what I seek.

Keep me in your wings and fly,
elevate me to new heights.

I will be safe here inside your embrace.
Hold me closer to this presence of grace
Make the winds move and the clouds disappear,
spread your wings and tell the stars to steer.

Keep me in your wings and fly.

For I know, your wings reach fields far from here
and you show your heart bleeds for me
now and again.

Belong with me, my warrior,
armour me inside your wings.
Close within, embrace me to rest.

Be here my all, my reason.
Carry me to the nest, where I can rest
and find the lost and erased.

Find the lost and erased.
