Naked you have conquered the fields of war to victory
The shattered armor you've lost
Is nevermore to be found
Another trial by fire won by pure desire
Rewarded with a crown, rewarded with a crown

Tears will heal the scars and bring tranquility
Raise your crown again and claim your territory

Raise your crown above this ground
Seek meaning and it will be found
Nothing will keep you down - Nothing

Raise your crown above this ground
Seek meaning and it will be found
Nothing will ever keep you down - Nothing
Nothing will ever keep you down
When desire brings you thy crown

Raise your crown above this ground
Seek meaning and it will be found
Nothing will keep you down
When desire brings you thy crown

Arise - Kings and queens
