Lost - We are lost

Here in the dark everything dies
Unperceived by our blinded eyes

No one can see

Lost - We are lost in the dark
Lost - We are lost without a spark - Of light
Lost - We are lost

Here in the dark everything dies
Before our blinded eyes

We can't see no one else
We can't see ourselves
Unnoticed we will live
Unnoticed we will die

All we need is light, a single spark
No one can see here in the dark

Blinded by a ray of darkness
