Real is just perception
And life happens when we're busy making plans
Living the way we know how
Exclude any fear and doubt

We share this lifetime
These moments of invisibility
Brought here to serve this purpose
Bringing a new era

All these days are a life
Pursue your mind and feel it's grasp
No one will be neglected or fade away
Feel the pulsating aura
