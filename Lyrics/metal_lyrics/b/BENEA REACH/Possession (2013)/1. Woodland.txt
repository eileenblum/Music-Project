I choose the path of the wolf and I run
To the center of the woodland once more, once again
Here in the dark I rest, rebuild, erase
In the woodland I become one

The orchestration of life and death
Changes me to more
With every single breath I take
One tear gives meaning
More than thousand words

I choose the view of the owl and I fly
In the woodland I become one

In the breath of the wolf
In the sight of the owl
I lay myself to rest
And let the moon cover

My eyes see clearly
The path forward from here
I sense nature whisper
And guard my trail

Where I run, where I fly
One tear gives meaning
More than thousand words

Where will silence find me, if not here
Where will solace guard me, if not where
The kingdom of life and death shines inside me

Run - Fly

In the breath of the wolf
In the sight of the owl
I lay myself to rest
In the woodland I become one
