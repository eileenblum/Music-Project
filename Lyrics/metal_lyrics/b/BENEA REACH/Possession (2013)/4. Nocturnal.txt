Nocturnal creatures
Children of the night
With pale features
Hiding from the sunlight

Lurking in the dark
From dawn till dusk
Just waiting

In the shadows
Where we roam

Waiting for the darkness
To cover us
From dusk till dawn

In the sunlight
We can't survive, we can't survive
But every night
We come alive, we come alive

Nocturnal creatures
With whiter shade of pale features
We are nocturnal creatures
With whiter shade of pale features
