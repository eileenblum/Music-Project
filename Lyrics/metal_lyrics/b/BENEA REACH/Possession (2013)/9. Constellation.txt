Goodbye, I'm moving on from planet earth tonight
This is not where I belong
Unroot my feet from the winterstreet
Goodbye, I'm moving on tonight

I am on my way to discover
Every constellation of stars in the sky
On a mission out to recover
The place where we were born and will never die

Searching every galaxy to find my destiny
Beyond time and space
Eventually I will find my home

No matter how far it is
And no matter how long it takes
I will find my home
