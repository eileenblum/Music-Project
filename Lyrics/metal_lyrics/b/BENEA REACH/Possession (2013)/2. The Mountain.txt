Push up, without looking down
Nothing can make us turn around
We're gonna pull up and we won't stop
Until we reach the top

Climbing up the mountain
On the steepest mountain wall
One false grip. One false step
Becomes a merciless fall

Tiring ascent, so tiring
But we are still ascending

Gotta push up and gotta pull up higher
For us the only way is up
But it's a long way up and a long way down

Following the mountain higher - Higher
Without fear of ever falling - Falling down
We are following the mountain higher - Higher
There is no limit to how high - How high we can go

Go, go, go all the way to the top

Push up, without looking down
Nothing can make us turn around
We're gonna pull up and we won't stop
Until we reach all the way to the top
