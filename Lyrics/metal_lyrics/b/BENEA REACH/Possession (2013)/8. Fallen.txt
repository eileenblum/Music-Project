Fallen from the sky towards the ground
No longer strong and proud
Like you used to be

Your strength and your pride - Fading
Your strength and your pride - Fading away

Look at you now
Without your confidence
If only you could see what I see
And believe like I believe - In you

Fallen down from the sky, hitting the ground
You have made it through safe and sound
Only bruises and scars
Now you are stronger than you were then
So spread your wings and fly once again

Stronger, falling down has made you stronger
Rising up made you stronger
Falling down and rising up has made you stronger

Your strength - Regaining - Your pride

You will be
Rising from the ground towards the sky
Even more strong and proud
Than you used to be
