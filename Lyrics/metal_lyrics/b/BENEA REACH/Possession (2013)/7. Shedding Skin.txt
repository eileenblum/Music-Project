Hiding the fangs and the claws
Concealing the hidden underneath within
Smiling through every handshake
while hiding the fangs and the claws

There is a beast inside the beauty
And beauty inside of the beast

For a prodigious moment
The surface becomes translucent
Shedding skin
And revealing the hidden underneath within

So hideous, oh so hideous
Bu oh how beautiful it is to see
The hidden showing through the surface
So hideous, so beautiful

For a short prodigious moment
The surface becomes translucent
Shedding skin, shedding skin
