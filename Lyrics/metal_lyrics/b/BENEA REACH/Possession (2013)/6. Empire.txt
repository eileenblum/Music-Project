Rig me to a set of wings
And I will burn the feathers
Set me on fire, I will turn to ash
Growing roots to the ground I won't move

I am getting close to a heavy brigade
I am taking you in
All so beautiful, all so calm

When winter falls, we will feel it's grasp
We are within reach
All so beautiful, all so calm

You can't tempt me with pride
Nor will I fall for your pretty face
I can't fail, not today

Fragile particles reunited
We are building an empire, building an empire

A glimpse of light is all we need
A drop of faith is sufficient for a spark to grow
And for a light to be dazzling
