Falling asleep safely in our bliss.
Waking up in a grave.
I'll damn that nightmare.
An Illusion.
Fire redeemed serpent.
The lake of suffer.
At the end it begins.

Itâs too late for regrets.
Pandemonium.
When the world comes crashing down.
Itâs too late to pray for mercy.
Pandemonium.
When the world comes crashing down, down.

Falling deeper below the surface.
Swallowed by inferno.
Diabolical premonition.
Eternal fire burning, infernal flames piercing the mind, the body, and the soul.
At the end it begins.

Itâs too late for repents.
Pandemonium.
When the world comes crashing down.
Itâs too late to pray for mercy.
Pandemonium.
When the world comes crashing, the world comes crashing down.

This illusion is real.
This nightmare is true.
This illusion is real.
This nightmare is true.
Eternal fire and infernal flames piercing the mind, the body, the soul.
Eternal fire and infernal flames piercing the mind, the body, the soul.
This illusion is real.
Diabolical premonition.
This nightmare is true.
Pandemonium.
