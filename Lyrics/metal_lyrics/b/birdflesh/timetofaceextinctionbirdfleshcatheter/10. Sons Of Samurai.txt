[performed by Birdflesh]My father was a samurai
My mother was an astronaut but feel in love with an alien 
I was taught to fight with a sword
I slaughtered everyone in my class
I wasn't caught
I am one with my sword
I can hide in the trees
And fly away like a bee
My brother is a ninja
My sister was a geisha  but choked on sushi
I am Shogun Ansjovis
I'm thinking of my dad and the men he killed

Son of Samurai my soul will never die
Son of an Astronaut I don't wanna know
Son of Samurai my soul will never die
Son of an Astronaut I don't wanna know
