[performed by Birdflesh]Iâm looking for nothing but can not find it
Iâve looked everywhere I tell you the truth
When I find it I will destroy
Lock it inside a tiny box and throw away the key

Everybody is talking about how they wanna dance
They decide their faked lives to romance
I bring the trash inside when I come home
To the sound of a silent radiostation from Rome

What the fuck I was looking for
I always forget and it makes me insane
When I forget I want it even more
Could it be a hat or a piece of fudge
Mongo man get a life at least a second hand brain
