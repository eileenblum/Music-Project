[performed by Birdflesh]Far beyond the world the live wizards, goblins and elves
I am the king of their kingdom ugly I sit on my throne

On the weekends we ride together
On the insane winds of Ulvaland
Some of us fall to ride again
On the insane winds of Ulvaland

The sky is black as they march around my castle of steel
When they have marched enough I give them a dragonmeal
In the mountains the magic flute is hidden
To find it you need the enchanted wand
Walk through the woods and swim across the lake
Then ask for the five-legged baboon
