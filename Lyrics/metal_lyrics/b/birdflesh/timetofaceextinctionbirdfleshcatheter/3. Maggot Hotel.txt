[performed by Birdflesh]Rotting existence, tired of all fuckinâ shit
Been living lifeless, I go to bed to decompose
I am so hungry, but will not eat
Ready to die now, awaiting the arrival of the maggots
Maggots are checking in my body is their hotel
The maggots are rockstars, thrashing every signle room
I want to be a corpse rotting in peace
Dead to the bone not a maggot hotel
Here are no vacant room, even the penthouse is booked
I hope someday the terrorist maggot will come and blow up the hotel
