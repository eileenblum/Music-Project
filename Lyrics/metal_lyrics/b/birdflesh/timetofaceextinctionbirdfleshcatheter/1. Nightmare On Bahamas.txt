[performed by Birdflesh]The sun in shining in my eyes, this is truly paradise
I lost my wallet in the sea, when a shark at up my knee
I watch the sunset very night, I sleep under the moonlight
Many insects and animals, I woke up with malaria

Coconuts are falling on my head
I'm living hell on Bahamas
I can not go back to my country
Cause someone stole my plane tickets

No money left to go home or eat, my dreams ends on a Caribbean street
A caveman took advantage of my ass, the pain he caused will always last
I've never felt this kind of hell before, I became the baboon's favorite whore
A mighty sandstorm came this day, and swept my life of hell away
