[performed by Birdflesh]Soulless, heartless, brainless, I can't remember who i dismember
I know gore-nothing more, and you are invited to the feast

Barbecue I love you!
You can stay the whole day
I'm the man and you're my guest
And you know my food is best

Barbecue I love you!
You can stay the whole day
I'm the man and you're my guest
And you know my food is best

I can't think but drink and grill what I kill
Welcome home to the Morgans, we grill fresh-we grill organs
Have some water and watch, when I slaughter your daughter
The scent from my grill and the blood I spill makes my wiener boil by thrill
