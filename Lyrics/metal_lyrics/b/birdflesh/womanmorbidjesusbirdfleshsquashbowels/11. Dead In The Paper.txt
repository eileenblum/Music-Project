[performed by Birdflesh]Iâm reading the newspaper, drinking a cup of tea
In the obituary I am dead [x2]

Sumo, sumo dead in the paper
Sumo, sumo dead outside [x2]

I donât understand, but in my hand
I put a grenade and myself immolate [x2]

Sumo, sumo dead in the paper
Sumo, sumo dead outside [x2]
