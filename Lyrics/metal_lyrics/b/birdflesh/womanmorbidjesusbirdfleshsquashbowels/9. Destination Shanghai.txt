[performed by Birdflesh]On the top of Fuji I stand
I watch the sun rise
Then I spread my fingers
And fly over the mighty land
I land on my dojo to visit my sensei
Then I take off again
Destination Shanghai

Sayonara my sensei [x4]

Geisha sushi

Sayonara my sensei [x4]
I will never forget you
