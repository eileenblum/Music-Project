[performed by Birdflesh]You pick a song and wait for your turn
In the speaker you hear your name
The crowd is crazy, time to entertain
You growl and scream a song you haven't made

Too drunk to see the lyrics - death metal karaoke
A beer bottle in your head - death metal karaoke

The mosh pit in the bar killed some men
The police arrived already drunk
Shot some girls then themselves
The karaoke of death all night long

Blood on the microphone - death metal karaoke
Surfing on bones - death metal karaoke

After your song came the silence of death
Many people died in the pit
The people who survived were screaming for more
And started another mosh pit of gore
