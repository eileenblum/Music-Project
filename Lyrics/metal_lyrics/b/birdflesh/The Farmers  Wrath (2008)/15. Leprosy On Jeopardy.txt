Iâm so smart i know itâs true
I am the lord of quiz
And trivial pursuit
I crushed the other competitors
In the final of jeopardy
I won a lot of money
But died from leprosy

In the first round I lost an eye
In the second I lost a thigh
It was very hard to stand,
To hear and to see
A million people
Could see my brutal death on TV

Leprosy on jeopardy

In the end of the show
I looked like a corpse
But nothing could stop me
On my way to victory
The final question was said
By my off-fallen head
I became the master of jeopardy
But dead

Every channel on TV
Was talking about me
I was the head news on BBC
People were in shock,
They couldnât believe
That their kids wanted to be
A star on jeopardy

Every kid in town wants to be like me
Donât wanna be a clown
They want to die from leprosy

Die!
