In the night I sneak outside
No one knows what I do at night
I meet my friend of eternal might
It's a goat and we ride behind the light

Soft fur
Big red eyes
Kind mind
Always there for me

Goatrider

We ride far we ride short
We ride from the south to north
One night we ride from Falcon Crest
All the way to the wild wild west

I am a rider of goat
It makes me feel alright all the night
Some nights I don't sleep at all
cause I want to ride on my goat all the night
