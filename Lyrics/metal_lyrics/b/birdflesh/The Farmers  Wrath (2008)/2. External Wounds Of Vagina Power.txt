In the sun, a corpse left to stink
The head was smashed
With something pink
Flies and maggots 
Are making me weak
Bodily juices now begin to reek

Rumors are spreading
All over the land
Cuntless corpses found in the sand
A killing spree is now taking place
People are dying by cunts in the face

This is a sick and twisted drama
Everybody sings, a cunt force trauma

Organs have lost its place
Someone hit it on their faces
Birds are falling from the sky
Blinded by the cunts in the eye

Tourist life is going bad
Empty shores itâs so sad
A horny man going mad
He likes the pussy He thinks itâs rad
