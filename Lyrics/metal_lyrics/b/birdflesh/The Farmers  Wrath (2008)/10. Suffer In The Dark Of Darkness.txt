I live in the dark I never see the light
Iâm hanging on a hook all alone
I used to be wanted but
Now Iâm old and ugly
I just want to burn and disappear

Iâd love to see you dead
Slice your kidney
And rip off your head
Wanna make you feel
Eternally worthless
And paint your house pink and red

Your neigbours would laugh
And never visit you again
Then youâd feel what I feel

Wanna crush your enormous TV
With your ripper off head
Vomitate on your PS3
And murder your best friend Ted

This is what I would do
Immediately if I could
But I am just an ugly shirt
I am just an ugly shirt
