I was out with my boat one day
Searching for tropical fish to slay
All of a sudden I saw something sick
So I had to hold tight around my dick

A zombie throwing
Schoolgirls to the shore
An African albino
Who turned into a whore
A 90-year old lady with a giant beard
I turned my boat around cause it was too weird

I tried to get away but something
Called my name
I knew I had to stay in the sickness
Of the sea

At the other side
I saw a boy with two cunts
A four-eyed fox
Drowning James Blunt
A horny pirate inhaling his anal gas
I had to play saxophone with my ass

Is this place for real?
I havenât even met a seal
My buttocks are shaped like a dome
This sick place feels like home
