Heâs the funny cool little man
Making you laugh
He doesn't have a tan
If you see him
you have to be his friend
You won't be bored
and never cry again

He's the funny ice dwarf
He's the funny ice dwarf
He's the funny ice dwarf
He will make you laugh and scream
beyond your wildest dream

Life is good when life is nice
Together with this funny dwarf of ice
He makes the world
a much better place
I love to kiss his ice cold face
