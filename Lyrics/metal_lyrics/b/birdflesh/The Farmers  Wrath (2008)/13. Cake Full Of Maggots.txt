For Godâs sake it was time to bake
A chocolate and cream stuffed cake
Unfortunately the cream was old
But I found out much too late

Cake full of maggots
Theyâre crawling inside
Cake full of maggots
But it looks so nice

I invited my friends to my house
For some coffee and fresh cake
My friends are the delicate treat
But from their mouths maggots fell

Maggots crawling in reeking vomits
Screams of hate and disgust
I canât be forgiven for my treat
On this day I lost all my friends

Cake full of maggots
Make everyone puke
Cake full of maggots
Make everyone leave
