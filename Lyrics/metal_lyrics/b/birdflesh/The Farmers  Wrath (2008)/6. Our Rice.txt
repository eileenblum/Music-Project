Enchanted by the rising sun
Time to have crazy fun
Party with a samurai
Why must we die
Running up the highest hill
Yakiniku on the grill
Happy in the park to eat
A delicious dish of rice and meat

The rising sun goes down
And darkness comes to town
Eucalyptic clash
Under a pale grey sky we eat our rice

After darkness comes the light
I canât remember last night
Sake makes me glad again
With a blow of Uncle Bens
One more party in the park
I am the only monarch
With a fork and a knife
Kuruniku for life
