He comes from a grave in Spain
Bringing you pain
On the dancefloor
Your legs turn to gore

The flamencorpse is coming
To make you suffer
When he stars to dance
You have no chanceâ¦ to survive

The dancefloor is slippery
Fear and sorrow
For all the discokids
Thereâs no tomorrow

The flamencorpse is coming
To make you suffer
When he starts to dance
You have no chance
A rose in his mouth
Twist and shout
Hasta la vista
Disco anti-christa

A broken discoball
In your face
The flamencorpse will
End your days
A huge amount of
San Miguel
He brings back to his
Grave of hell
