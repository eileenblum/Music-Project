Iâm lying in my bed
Sweaty and paranoid
Canât lie still feel like Iâm in a void
My never ending fear
Sends shivers down my spine
The hair is rising on this neck of mine

Eight legs on my skin
Eight legs on my chin
Eight legs in my hair
Eight legs everywhere

I see something crawling
Through a crack in the wall
Giant spiders are infesting my hall
Trying to fight them off but theyâre
Already on my back
Screaming and crying a spider attack

Eight legs on my legs
Eight legs on my head
Theyâre crawling in my mouth
Now when I am dead
