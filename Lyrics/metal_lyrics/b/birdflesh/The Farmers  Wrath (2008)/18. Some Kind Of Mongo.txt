The battery is dead
It tickles in my head
The power must be fed
Bays, the anger in my face
Takes me to a place
Where I can spend my days

Some kind of mongo

Iâm falling down the stairs
I guess that no one dares
To enter the affairs
Now I really have to go
So I start to row
With my ancient toe
