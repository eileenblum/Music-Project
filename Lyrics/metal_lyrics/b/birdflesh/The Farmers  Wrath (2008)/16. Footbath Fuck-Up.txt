Last night I used my footbath
It felt so good I fell asleep
But something was wrong,
The footbath exploded
Bubbles were spewing
And I had no feet

Footbath fuck-up
Farewell to my feet
Footbath fuck-up
At least they were clean

Bloody foam filled my house
And drowned my wife
I screamed in pain
So the windows cracked
Pieces of glass stucked in my face
I flew into my garden
And down in the well

Footbath fuck-up
Farewell to of hell
Footbath fuck-up
In the well I dwell
