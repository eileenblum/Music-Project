Itâs Friday evening me and a friend
Sitting at home having some bears
Nothing special just to relax
After some hours
We want something else

Lift a fist and into the mist
And finish up our beer
Heading for the booze nothing to lose
And nothing left to fear but ourselves

Into gorilla behavior
With vodka and bourbon
Endless party in my apartment

Lift a fist and into the mist
And finish up our drink
Heading for more booze
Nothing to lose
Totally unable to think
Our eyes are closed
And weâre having fun
Gorilla behavior feels so good
We canât speak so we sign
Words from another world
