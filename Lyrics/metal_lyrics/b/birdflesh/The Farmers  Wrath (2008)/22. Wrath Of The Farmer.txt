The farmer woke up
In the middle of the night
He thought he heard his animals fight
He looked out the window
And saw his barn on fire
He screamed in panic blinded by the night

Violent explosion
Burning carnage
The wrath of the farmer
Echoes in the night

The Farmers' wrath

The farmer cries as his animals flied
Pigs and cows and horses
Filled the sky
Frightened cats ran for their lives
The farmer's work disappeared in the night
