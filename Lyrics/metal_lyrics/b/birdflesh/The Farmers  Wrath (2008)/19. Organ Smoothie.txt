I arrived at my home
Just came home from work
The people who work
There are a bunch of jerks
I take out my blender
Ready to make dinner
When I suddenly notice
That Iâm getting thinner

My doorbell rings I answer the door
Some colleagues of mine
Fall to the floor
I seize the chance and slit their throats
Put them in a blender
Before they begin to bloat

Organ smoothie! Organ Smoothie!
Chop and cut and hack
Cock and balls and sack
Slice and dice and saw
Tits and ass and jaw

Organ smoothie! Organ smoothie!
Rip and break and tear
Heart and lungs and ear
Organ Smoothie

Do you want one my dear?
