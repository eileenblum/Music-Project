Today is my payday!
A lot of cash on my account
The day after payday
All bills payed no money left
I'm longing for payday
So i can pay my bills again
No trip to Bombay
But maybe to my living room

Payday mayday payday 
Payday mayday payday 
Payday mayday payday 
Payday mayday payday 

Today is my payday!
Happiness in my heart
The day after payday
The bills have raped my account
I hate payday
It only breaks my heart
Take me to Bombay
And make me a holy cow
