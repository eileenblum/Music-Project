The son of satan drove his Harley 
On the highway to hell
Listened to AC/DC on his walkman
But the music was too slow

He joined the band
Wrote some songs
And they became the gods
 Of deathmetal
They toured a lot around the world
With bands like Asbest and Autopsy

They did 200 records a year
And every single one sold gold
Their show at the MTV awards
Went out of hand
And 200 people lost their lives

Michael Jackson and Madonna 
Did the wall of death two times
Heads were flying kids were crying
Everyone sung-a-long as they died

They killed many people
With their brutal music
So their mission was complete
The band gathered around
The unholy fire
Then it was time to die

Sacrificial Suicide
Into the fire with their gear
Drums and guitars, flesh and leather
Flash from the fire
TNT
AC/Deicide
