Iâm a fearless cripple,
Looking for the kill
I am called the brute,
Looking for the thrill
Bought an ancient sword
From an ancient lord
Began my human feast,
Iâm a handicapped beast

Wheelchair impaler
With wheels
And swords of doom
Wheelchair impaler
Gonna get you entombed
Wheelchair impaler
Feared on my mighty steed
Wheelchair impaler
Letâs drink to rolling steel

Every fucking day
When the clock strikes nine
I make them drink
My crippled ass like wine
Lurking in the dark,
I always hunt them down
Asses filled with swords,
Iâm the master of this tow
