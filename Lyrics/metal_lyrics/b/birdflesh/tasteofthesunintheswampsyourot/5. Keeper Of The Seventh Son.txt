You have seven kids.
But one of them is missing.
You wonder where he can be.
But you don't have a clue.

He's not on top of the hill.
He's not behind the moon.
How can I be so sure?
Because I know where he is.

He is in my apartment.
I treat him really good.
I give him candy.
And a lot of toys.
I know you want him back.
But your son doesn't miss you.
You have to look some more.
But you don't know where I live.

Just forget your sun.
Because he wont come back.

Keeper of the seventh son.
Keeper of the seventh son.
