I enter the bar like I was kind.
On the stereo they play Sting.
It is early Saturday.
So it's very cheap to drink.

I get insane power.
Happy hour, crazy hour
Beware of my golden shower.
Happy hour, crazy hour.

I order a beer I get four.
I'm getting drunk I want more.
I still got cash in my wallet.
I'm not gonna walk through that door.

I get insane power.
Happy hour, crazy hour.
Beware of my golden shower.
Happy hour, crazy hour.
