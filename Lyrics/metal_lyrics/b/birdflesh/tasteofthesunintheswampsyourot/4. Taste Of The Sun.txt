So refreshing.
Taste of the sun.
Looks like lemon.
And it is for free.

Yellow - in the snow.
Ice cold - let it flow.
Thirsty - never again.
Share it - with your friends.

You must hurry.
Before the spring will come.
Eat and eat and eat and eat eat and eat,
This wont make you fat.

Yellow - in the snow.
Ice cold - let it flow.
Thirsty - never again.
Hungry - eat the ones with chocolate bits.

The best things in life are truly free.
Enjoy what nature has to give.
One of the things is piss,
That you find in the snow by the road at winter time.

Take care of your dog.
