You lived your life as an angel.
You never hut a fly.
You went to church every Sunday.
But now you have died.

Your life was holy but you're rotting.
In the evil coffin, in the evil coffin.
Satanic maggots crawl on your skin.
In the evil coffin, in the evil coffin.

You said your prayers every night.
And thanked god for the food.
You helped old people across the street.
You have never been rude.
