From the first moment I saw you
From the first moment I touched you
You've made me sick everytime I think of you
I get a volcano inside my stomach
I will always hate you you stinky ugly monkey
Get out of my sight or I'll pull your fucking eyes out
I will always hate you you're a fucking asshole
get out of my town or I'll beat you fucking down
I know you love me and I know that I hate you
I wanna hit you with my car
Or maybe impale you on a cactus yeah!!!!
On our first date I puked once
On our second date I puked twice
On our third date I puked three times
And I don't wanna date you again ever!
I will always hate you you lying expensive whore
Getting out of my life as I cut you with my knife
