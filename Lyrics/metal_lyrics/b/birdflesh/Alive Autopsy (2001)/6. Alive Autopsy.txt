Walking an endless corridor
Suddenly a door smashes my face
I fell to the door unconscious
People thought that I was DEAD!
I opened my eyes and felt the stench of death
I was laying on the table naked and cold
A man with a knife dressed in a coat
Cut my stomach open so my gore fell out
Alive autopsy!
They thought I was dead
When they opened my head
Alive autopsy!
Mutilating surgery painful misery
Bloodtaste in my toothless mouth
No arms no legs only one eye left
Too late to say that I'm alive
So the autopsy went on
At the funeral I was still alive
The casket was a matchbox
And I was raped in the eye by worms
