I take all my money and I go to the bar
i don't want to get drunk but I always go too far
Time is out I start to shout
Kicked out on the street but I don't land on my feet
The last bus has left long ago
I'm laying on the ground
The rain is pouring down I'm freezing as hell
I have a broken head
Wrooom wrooom wrooom, where's my motorbed?
Where is my motorbed????
With the sound of the wind it comes flying for me
To rescue me from my drunken misery
A nice warm bed with satin sheets
I'm fed with tropical fruits
By bikini babes who warm my feet
I'm taking off leaving the losers behind
It finds the way home by itself
So I can just lay back and relax
I love my motorbed
In my motorbed I am the king
You are rotting on the pavement
