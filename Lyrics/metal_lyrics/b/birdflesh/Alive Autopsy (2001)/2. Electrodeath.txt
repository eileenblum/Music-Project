I'm so fucking depressed
Cause my life is a little bit messed up
Cause yesterday I found a mysterious little shop
The owner of the shop was a gorilla from Taiwan
I think he was a criminal but I didn't care
He had a lot of stuff that I wanted to steal
But he had one thing that I just had to buy
It was an electronic game with a lot of slaughtering
People blown away machineguns and knifethrowing
In the game bullets rained
A man and a woman died with their kids
I felt a little strange when they faded away
I turned off the game and ran to the phone
With the speed of fart
I phoned home but no one answered
I thought they weren't home but they were dead
I felt guilt cause I killed my family with my game
The shop is closed the gorilla is gone
I am accused for murder
Electrodeath!
I wait the execution I will die by electrocution
Nintendo havohej konika I'm sorry
