Captain Captivus is sitting on his jellythrone
Surrounded by gore blood
Is dripping on the fleshless bones
Insane Jesuskids are crucified on a burning rat
The captain is the Lord for him they lift their hat
He feed his world
With chocolatemilk and childrens head
People are blind
They put my fingers in their ears
Captivus revolution watch the world in devils bed
Let the final fart explode
This is the age of bullchrist
The rats of humanity believe he is Satan's son
Your mom is scared your cat is dead
Just because his dick is green
Headless children are floating in the blood filled massgrave
The milk is red
And the bread you buy is your grandma's butt
Your toilet and your bathtub is filled with cunts
You cannot stop this gory madness
As bullchrist sings his peppermint blues (J.O.)
The number of death continues
This is the age of bullchrist
This is the age of bullchrist
On the wave of your blood he surf
