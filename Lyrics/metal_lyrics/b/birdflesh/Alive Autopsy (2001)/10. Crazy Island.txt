I took my fullpacked bags and ran to the bitchy beach
There I stole a motorboat and headed for the horizon
The sun burned my skin and I was out of fuel
In the middle of the ocean I tried to handle my panic
I can say it was pretty hard
As I was attacked by sharks
They are my food they ate my clothes
They are my bags
And the fucking sharks ate my boat
I threw myself into the chaotic sea
Immediately the sharks were chasing me
But my stomach was filled with gas from beyond
A bombastic fart rescued my
From a sure fucking death
I landed on an island where no one has been before
There i met a baboon who became my loveslave
It built me a house and a resturaunt
Where I had to eat
But the food sucked so the baboon had to die
I kicked two coconuts into the bleeding monkey ass
Then I pissed in its eyes and forced it to jump from a tree
Cocobutt eyes of piss it had to jump
And it had to land on its head
A broken baboon is laying in the sand
Now I"m alone on a crazy island
I am rotting I can see my bones
I guess I'm on my way to a sure fucking death
