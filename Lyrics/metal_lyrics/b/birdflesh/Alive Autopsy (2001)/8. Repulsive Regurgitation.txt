Peeling the skin of the vomit
Shrimps are screaming for air
Infested by headless mice
Naked we're running amok
Puking in the fur on the dogs of war
REPULSIVE REGURGITATION
Dancing and barking
Two fingers down the throat
REPULSIVE REGURGITATION
Crawling morons are eating from their feet
the morning paper is blank
As the night falls our dicks are standing tall
Mustard up your ass run til you fall
