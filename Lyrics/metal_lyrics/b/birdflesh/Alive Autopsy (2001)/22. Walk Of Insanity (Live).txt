Today I went for a walk
I can't believe what I saw
I thought I was sick in the head
But you are sicker than me
A man masturbating with a stick
A mother giver head to her son
A dog with a machinegun in its ass
I saw a self-mutilating cop in the grass
Is this a sick world?
Or is this meant to be?
I really hope so
Cause I am horny, I saw
A priest shitting on his crucifix
A viking giving birth to a wolf
A whore selling fish from her cunt
I'm so glad I"m not blind
A rabbit beating up a little kid
A schoolbus driving around on a man's head
A corpse upon a roof fixing a house
A girl giving cunnilingus to a mouse
