You go to the church and sit down on the bench
You close your eyes and listen to the priest
Preacher of lies raping your mind
Thousands of bibles fill your house
All your stupid shit about all this stupid shit
For me there's only one way to say it
Satan is boss I kick on the cross
Slaughtered Christians in my garden
Lambsteak on my plate
An inverted cross on my head
A pentagram tattooed on my face
Jesus and god think you are funny
When you bitch give them your money
Evil shall rise dark and nice
Satan is boss and I kick on the cross
Kick! Kick! Kick on the cross!
