Suddenly it stood in front of me and I was paralyzed
I couldn't scream I couldn't believe my eyes
The nightmare has finally come true
The birdgorilla is coming for you
COMING FOR YOU!!!!
Blasphemy! Identity unknown!
It will put his wings around you
And make you his own
Brutality! He'll make you fucking burn!
You drive your car but it will explode
When you turn TURN!
When it appears the curch turns to dust
This mongolized monkey no one can trust
It spread its wings and show you his bra
You know he is back through you have no brain
The creature of evil and murder
It is back for good
All tivolis on Earth destroyed
You'll be fucked after death
Save your prayers! You need help forget about breakfast
Bloodbath rising! You will swim in your family's gore
Birdgorilla! It's the return of a funeral fuck
It bring us evil!
