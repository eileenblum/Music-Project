In a world where no women live
Where men are in love with each other
Buffalo Ben grew up up with cock in the ass
And flowers in the bed
Happy holiday whore hacking horses hallelujah
Ben left the gayland with bags filled with snow
His friends waved goodbye and screamed: assbetrayer!
He swimmed across oceans
He walked over mountains
His feet were rotting he slept in the trees
And he ate the leaves
Distortion! His voice got distorted
Farts from hell! he farted sourly
Aching head! Eternal migraine
Where to go! he didn't know
He found a lot of nuclear weapons on the way
He called himself a hunter the nuclear gay
Everywhere he walked bombs explode
Pissed off and armed ready to kill
In another world under the ground
Where the sun has never been seen only the moon
A demon arise with fires form Hell
With his first in the air he left his satanic womb
It's the gay and the demon
When Ben slept one night he dreamt about evil
When he woked up the demon was staring at him
The demon took his hand and they became friends
After a lot of gaydrinks and demonic beer they got an idea
