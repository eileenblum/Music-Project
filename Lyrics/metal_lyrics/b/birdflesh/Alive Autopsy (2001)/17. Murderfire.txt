You were cooking so you couldn't feel
The stench of burning
But in your living room your couch was on fire
When the flames came into your kitchen
You jumped through the window
And the glass cut your skin
With blood in your face your an on the street
You looked like a maniac so you people got scared
No one could help you because everyone escaped
And the fire from your house was still after you
Try to run away form the fire today
It will put you in a grave someday anyway
Hey baberiba he baberiba
Try to hide at the gas station
Running and running the fire was running fast
Your family was caught and the funeral was burnt
The tears from the priest couldn't stop the fire
He ran to the church but it burned down too
Now you're standing naked with a burning face
Just because I threw a joint on your couch
You'll never find out that it was
I who destroyed your life
Cause now you are dead and I'm a police
Murderfire murderfire murderfire murderfire
I took a smoke and you were burned to death
Murderfire murderfire murderfire murderfire
MURDERFIRE MURDERFIRE
