Excuse me excuse me
I'm sorry I'm sorry
I didn't mean to call this late
But I have to tell you something important
I know you think that our families are good friends
I think you and your family should die
Yeah I remember the dinner
It really sucked
And that trip we did to Jamaica
We were bored all the time
We won't cry when you die
We'd love to see when you die
Excuse me excuse me
I'm sorry I'm sorry
I can hear that you're upset
The truth hurts and I hope your death will hurt
I know that everything you've said has been lies
That's why my family wishes yours eternal cries
You think you're tough
But we've had enough
You're not cool to hang with
Now I'm hanging up
We won't cry when they die
We'd love to see when they die
One million chainsaws I throw at his house
And six thousand spiders down his wife's blouse
We don't really hate them they're actually pretty nice
I was just bored and they had to pay the price
