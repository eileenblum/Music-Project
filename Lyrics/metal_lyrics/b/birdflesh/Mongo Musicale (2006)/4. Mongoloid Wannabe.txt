You want to be someone
Attention denied
Everyone knows you're a fake
Go home and cry
You're not what you want to be
Just get it out of your head
Please accept what a fool your are
And leave us all alone
Twisted and braindead
You are not
Wicked and retarded
You are not
You're not what you want to be
Just get it out of your head
Please accept what a fool you are
And leave us all alone
Mongoloid wannabee
Mongoloid wannabee
Mongoloid wannabee
Please go to sleep
