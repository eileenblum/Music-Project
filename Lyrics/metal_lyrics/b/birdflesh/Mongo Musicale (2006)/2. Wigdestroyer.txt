Here I come bored of everything
I go downtown to look for you
You are the ones who lost your hair
And tried to replace it with an ugly wig
I rip it off and throw it to the ground - wigdestroyer
I know you can not help it
And I can't help that I'm sick in the head
So let's shake hand
Before I rip it off again
