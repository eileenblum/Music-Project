In the jungle, the filthy jungle
I am searching for love
I know there are a lot of horny creatures
But I know what I want
I have been with snakes and frogs - and some monkeys too
But there was no real love - just a lot of poo
Now I've finally found a friend - damn, it took a while
She is my everything - she always makes me smile
Oh, I feel alive
With my crocodile
Yeah, I feel alive
I am a crocophile
And we never fight
We gonna have a lot of crocokids
That we gonna feed with banana skids
It's the smallest things I love the most - like her breath of the dead
And when she serves me breakfast - while I'm still in bed
When she gives me presents - like some hunters head
And when she is blushing - her chins turn red
