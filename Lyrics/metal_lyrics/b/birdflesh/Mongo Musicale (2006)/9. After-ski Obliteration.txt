Snow is falling to defeat
Snowballs crushing every street
Cry for beer to survive
The cold winds in the night
Heavy drinking all night long
After-ski obliteration
Slippery skis below my feet
After-ski obliteration
Frozen rain from the sky
Bringing pain make us die
Down the hill one last time
So fucking drunk goodbye punk
Smash my head against a tree
Eyes filled with ice
