You gave birth to a kid
That fell asleep immediately
He wakes up when it's time to eat
Then he falls asleep again
Born tired - born to sleep, live to rest
Born tired - floor is good, sofa is better, bed is best
25 years later he's still tired
After dinner his eyes are closed
He wakes up at 5 am
His head hangs low all the time
