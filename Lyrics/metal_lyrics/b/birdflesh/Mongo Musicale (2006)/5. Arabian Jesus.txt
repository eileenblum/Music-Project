On a cross in Baghdad
He was born with a mighty moustache
He had a nice mother
And 15 violent dads
He was a famous kid
He healed the wounded ones
He turned water into oil
Arabian Jesus superstar
One day he was abducted by the stormtroopers of garlic
They put him in a cradle with grass wet from lemon juice
When evil came close to him stars fell from the sky
A star landed on the stormtroopers so they all died
Arabian Jesus
Arabian Jesus
