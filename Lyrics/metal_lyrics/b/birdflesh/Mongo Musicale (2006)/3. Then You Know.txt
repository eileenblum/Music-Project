You put on your shorts and open the fridge
Grab an ice-cream and call yourself a bitch
You go outside to catch some sun
You slip on ice and land in snow
No this can't be happening
Where are all bikini girls?
No the sun is supposed to be warm
And I'm supposed to swim in the lake
Frost on your sunglasses
Ice-man in your bed
Skiing kids in your garden
Snowball attack
No this can't be happening
Where are all bikini girls?
No the sun is supposed to be warm
I'm supposed to swim in the lake
Honestly, where did it go?
All I see is snow
May I introduce myself
To Mr. Gangrene
When you stand
With Christmas gifts in your arms
Then you know the summer is gone
When you wake up dead after sleeping outside
Then you know the summer is gone
