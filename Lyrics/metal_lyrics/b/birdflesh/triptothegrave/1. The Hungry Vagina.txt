When I was walking down the street
I heard a voice screaming for meat
Then I met the girl of my dreams
She said her vagina was hungry for me
I was horny and followed her home
We took our clothes off, then i knew I would die
Her vagina screamed for meat
But it couldn't reach
It turned into a big mouth
And chased me all around
I tried to escape but all doors were locked
Only a small window open
I tried to get out but my erection was still too big
Nowhere to go and a hungry vagina behind
I was horny and followed her home
The girl of my dreams, the hungry vagina
Her vagina screamed for meat
And climbed out of its hole
It took a bite of my head
Hungry vagina I'm dead
