I was killed on a Birdflesh concert
My back was cut off in the pit
SO my parents put me in a grave
But I wanted to mosh
I am metal to the bone
And bones are all that is left
But a true metal freak never dies
Manowar and I war friends
He is the brutal corpse
Of jeans and leather and gore
He will never rest in peace
And he will never listen to sleaze
I'm drinking beer from the Hell
When I'm sitting in my tombstone by night
I'm listening to metal and punk
Falling down in my grave when I'm drunk
He is the brutal corpse
Of jeans and leather and gore
He will mosh on your floor
And then he will mosh on your door
"I would like to start a band
But no one around here is interested
The all just want to lie in their graves
And they hate me cause I"m playing my tapes"
Yes, I'm indeed the brutal corpse
And the big bad bench is my friend
We mosh together all night
And if a pop-corpse come we will fight
