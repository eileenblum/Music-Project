Sweat of the old man its impossible
Sweat of the old man to wash away
Sweat of the old man I'm the garbage boy
Sweat of the old man...
I do a lot of work
No time for soap
Sweat of the old man
I get it all the time
I cannot make new friends
The stench scares them off
Sweat of the old man
You'll get it in your nose
I wear the same clothes every day
I can't take them off, I can't put new on
All perfume I refuse, deoderant I will not use
The scent is not my style
I always sweat old man's sweat
It's like a shell on me
Can you image how I smell?
I'm even hated by the shit and the flies
I do a lot of work
No time for soap
Sweat of the old man
I get it all the time
I cannot make new friends
The stench scares them off
Sweat of the old man
You'll get it in your nose
Party on the farm - part
Sweat of the old man its impossible
Sweat of the old man to wash away
Sweat of the old man I'm the garbage boy
Sweat of the old man....
