I am a slave under the clan of spicy food
My name is Mutanga and I cook all day long
I cook for my familty, I cook for my enemies
But whatever I cook
There's always one thing wrong
More garlic
My mom's moustache is bigger than my dad's
More garlic
You cannot use enough
Our country is covered with garlic clouds
Garlic gives us strength and a reason to live
Achmed Abdul ride the Arabian bull
Garlic in my mouth the scent is in your nose
More garlic
All relatives live in the same house
More garlic
Eat garlic and be cool
More garlic
My mom's moustache is bigger than my dad's
More garlic
You cannot use enough
