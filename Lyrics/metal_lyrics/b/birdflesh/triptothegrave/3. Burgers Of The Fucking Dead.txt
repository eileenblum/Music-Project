I went to a concert to watch my favourite band
What I did I don't understand
I took my knife and killed some girls
Then I made some burgers of ham
Young girls strips of flesh, on the rotting bread
Young girls strips of flesh, on the rotting bread
Come and buy my burgers of the fucking dead
I sold the burgers tot he crowd
And the band was playing so loud
I couldn't hear my customers speak
So to the stage with the band I sneaked
I killed the band with my gun
To see them die was very fun
I made some more burgers to sell for a high price
But I forgot to get the burgers signed
Strips of famous flesh, and cracked bleeding heads
Come and buy my burgers of the fucking dead
No autographs on the bloody burgers
Couldn't sell them for an extra high price
How could I be so fucking stupid
And kill the band before they had signed?
