I bought a trip so expensive
It costed all my money
I thought it would be the trip of my life
But it was the trip of my death
I had saved for this trip for ten years trip to the grave
I sat down in a plane so bit
Trip to the grave
I said to the man next to me
Trip to the grave
This trip will be fun trip to the grave
The plane had not even started
When the man next to me cut my throat
The blood was on his peanuts
And the gore was on his leg
I had saved for this trip for ten years
Trip to the grave
I was on it for ten minutes trip to the grave
For all the money I saved trip to the grave
I got a trip to the grave trip to the grave
What was the name of the trip? Gravetrip!
What was the name of the trip? Gravetrip!
What was the name of the trip? Gravetrip!
What was the name of the trip? Gravetrip!
What was the name of the trip? Gravetrip!
What was the name of the trip? Gravetrip!
