In my dreams I travel to the land of the sick
The people who live there aren't very friendly
They say hello with a kick on my dick
And as my balls swell
My dreams turns into a nightmare
I can barely walk when I feel something from behind
Two bloody hands in my face
And something giant between my buttocks
As I screamed in pain I ate the hands
The fingers crushed like crackers by my teeth
And I was brutally fucked in the ass, by a giant tree
Then I wake up from this dream
My head is in my anal
I see a piece of the tree, the land of the sick is for real
