[performed by Birdflesh]I'm sitting by the fire
Evil is growing inside of me
I haven't read the bible I do not go to the church
I guess I'm going to hell

I am satans child
On a goat I ride
I deserve to die so KILL ME!
Crosses I invert
Jesus for dessert
Christians I do hurt I LOVE IT!

No fucking heaven for me cause I'm evil tonight
I belong in the hell where the darkness is light

Light! I do not need
I have eyes like a cat and like a wolf I bleed
My teeth are sharpened so I can chew the raw christian meat
