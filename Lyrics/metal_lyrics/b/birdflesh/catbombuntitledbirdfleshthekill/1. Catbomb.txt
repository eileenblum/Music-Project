[performed by Birdflesh]A lonely little man
With cruelty and hate in his mind
Torturer of pets
In his garden your lost cat you'll find

Goodbye to the meat
Get off the street

One day a woman came by
And gave the man a kiss
He ran to the toilet
And took a shit for six hours

Out from his open hole
Came all cruelty and hate
The kiss brought love to his soul
So he bought a cat and a dog
The cat ate the dog
The man kissed the cat
The cat turned into a bomb
And blew the man to hell

Blown into hell! Blown into hell!
Love sent him to hell! He loves Satans Bell!
