[performed by Birdflesh]I need help my lips are dry
I'm in pain I will die
I've got lipbalm on a stick
I will put some on my lips

Lipbalm death Lipbalm death
Someone has poisoned my lipbalm
Lipbalm death Lipbalm death
It itches and burns it destroyed my breath

Someone has poisoned my lipbalm
Someone has poisoned my lipbalm

I can't smile my mouth is shit
That fucking stick was no hit
Who the hell did this to me
I guess I will never know
