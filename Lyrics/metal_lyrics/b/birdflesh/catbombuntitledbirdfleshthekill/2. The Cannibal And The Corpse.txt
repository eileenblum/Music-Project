[performed by Birdflesh]A hungry man was walking in the jungle
He couldn't find anything to eat
Then he met a corpse who whispered "you can eat me if you want"
The corpse gave him some ketchup and some salt and a glass of milk

The man started to feast on his friendly friend of the dead
Ketchup and blood on his head
All he missed was a piece of bread
