Too late to turn back now
Content with silence
Agony was endured
The guilt of death
Seeped right through her stares
The silence was ignored
No one cared why
Resulting in a
Conflicting regret
Corruption of a peaceful mind
Offering an easy way out
Regret There is not forgiveness for the
Sins that you've created
Regret
You're in denial because the
Truth remains
He's still dead
That brought her to pray
For nothingness
No forgiveness
And nothing more
She decided to vanish
All the pain
And take away
What was left of her life
Corruption of a peaceful mind
Offering an easy way out
Regret There is not forgiveness for the
Sins that you've created
Regret
You're in denial because the
Truth remains
He's still dead
It's an eternal session
Between the past and a tattered soul
regret
