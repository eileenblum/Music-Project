I awake inside myself
Seeing nothing but black
Seeing nothing through all the darkness
Can't breath, can't see
Can't feel a thing
What's happening to me
I turn around
I see a light
What lies beyond
What lies inside
Can't breath, can't see
Can't feel a thing
What's happening to me
Entwined together
Harvest angel
Break the cycle
Turn the tables
The suicidal dreams
That run through my head
I get the feeling if I don't wake up
I'll be dead
I'm ready to see
That this is real
I'm ready to wake
Before I desensitize my fate
The anger inside of me
Won't change a thing
Someone release me
And take me home
Another chance, another life
Just give me, one last time
To make things work
To make things right
Just give me, one more
Still awake inside myself
Feeling nothing but guilt
Feeling nothing through all the dark times
Death sees, through me
My greatest fears, are coming to haunt me
Destroying lives, betraying friends
For what it's worth, I'll make amends
Death sees, through me
My greatest fears, are coming to haunt me
Entwined together
Harvest angel
Break the cycle
Turn the tables
The suicidal dreams
That run through my head
I get the feeling if I don't wake up
I'll be dead
I'm ready to see
That this is real
I'm ready to wake
Before I desensitize my fate
The anger inside of me
I'll leave behind
Someone release me
And take me home
Another chance, another life
Just give me, one last time
To make things work
To make things right
Just give me, one more
(I wish I could change things)
(why can't I see)
(someone release me)
release the bloody rage
And strive to overthrow
Everything I used to be
And accept what I've become
Another chance, another life
Just give me, one last time
To make things work
To make things right
Just give me, one more
