I was born a thousand years ago
Yet I walk the earth today
I was granted eternal life
Death is foreign to me
I am immortal
My life is non-fatal
I live to not die
Forever, lost in eternity
Living life again and again
Never to be free
What happened to me
Immortality
A freak of nature
I watch mankind
As they fall short of glory
Unharmed I walk away because
I am immortal
I'll be here when they're gone
Everyone I've loved has past away
Forever, lost in eternity
Living life again and again
Never to be free
What happened to me
Immortality
This curse of immortality
I'm fighting but it's crippled me
No explanations
I'm petrified to be alive
I'd kill myself but still survive
Why can't I die
Forever, lost in eternity
Living life again and again
Never to be free
