Behind my head in pain thoughts are tumbeling around.
Thoughts that never can be written in words.
Oh, I felt your grief.
I'm weak when the laughter is gone.

Endless rain is falling down. Endless roads to go.
Deep inside the sadness grows.
I'm right in the middle of nowhere.
The stones upon my chest are making it so hard to breathe.
I feel the hopelessness as I meet...

A dying lanscape in a dying world.
A grey sky in a black universe.

I'm gazing towards the horizon.
I wish that I was there.
Fast, faster and faster to my waiting grave.
Sometimes I'd like to walk and do you know.
You are the breaking skies above.

A dying lanscape in a dying world.
A grey sky in a black universe.
