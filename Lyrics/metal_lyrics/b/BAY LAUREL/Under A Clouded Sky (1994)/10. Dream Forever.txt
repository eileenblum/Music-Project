I'm walking on the path as I've done a hundred times.
The wind is whisteling. It is so cold.
My steps are fixed. To the forest I walk.
The rain is whipping my face and I'm freezing to my bones.

I'm standing alone with the night.
The rain is making me feel.
Temptation is making me seek the truth beyond the sad life.
The dark sky has something that keeps me in obsession.
Will I meet the unknown? Can I dream forever?

I've dreamed the same dream every night
and now I'm here to make it happen.
Hand in hand with the lost I'm walking towards the end.
Let the sky fall down becuase I'm here to walk in.

I'm standing alone with the night.
The rain is making me feel.
Temptation is making me seek the truth beyond the sad life.
The dark sky has something that keeps me in obsession.
Will I meet the unknown? Can I dream forever?
