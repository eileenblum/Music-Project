Flying on a dream of gleaming lights.
Lost and alone with you.
Passing through the days in sanity.
Time has ceased to be.

You turn to me with your smiling face but now I know.
Your real face lingers.
I'm falling away from you.

Your hands reach out to touch the sky
but I know you've been there before.
You say you can't stand another night but I'm not of that 
kind.

Don't try to get me high tonight because I know your ways.
I rather leave now than finally stand forsaken.

Your hands reach out to touch the sky
but I know you've been there before.
You say you can't stand another night but I'm not of that 
kind.

You're not my kind.
