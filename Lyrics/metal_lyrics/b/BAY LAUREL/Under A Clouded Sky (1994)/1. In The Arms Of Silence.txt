When I'm gone, will they remember me?
When I'm gone, will the flowers cry on my grave?

I face the fear of the unknown path.
Pictures are passing by as I think.
Tomorrows words may not be spoken.
Tomorrow can be the day to fly.
My last kiss for you my dear?
My last goodbye for you my friends?
When I sleep in the arms of silence?

Will flowers weep upon my grave?
Candles shine beside my name?
Will they remember?
Will they forget? I wonder.
When I'm gone.

I see a hall with thousands of people.
Forsaken souls who never died.
Their names shall never be remembered here.
Grey dawn, empty eyes.
Dreaming shadows dreams with the night.
Dreams on, dreams with the night.
When I sleep, will I share their dreams?

Will flowers weep upon my grave?
Candles shine beside my name?
Will they remember?
Will they forget? I wonder.
When I'm gone.

I face the fear of the unknown path.
I cry in despair when I see it all.
Tomorrows words may not be spoken.
Tomorrow can be the day to fly.

I know it's time because I can feel it inside.
My guardian angel is since long times gone.
The creeping silence is closing in.
Closer and closer.
Soon it will reach me and take me in it's arms.
Take me to it's empire. Take me in it's arms.

Will flowers weep upon my grave?
Candles shine beside my name?
Will they remember?
Will they forget? I wonder.
When I'm gone.
