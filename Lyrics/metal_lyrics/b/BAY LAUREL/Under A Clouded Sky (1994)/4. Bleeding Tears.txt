All these feelings are ending up in frozen words.
All my dreaming has been shown to be only dreams.
My heart is black as the night.
I'm walking on a bleeding road again.
I can't live in a dream forever so I'm trying to forget the 
time
together.

Lost withing this feeling.
The black world keeps turning. The black time is here.
I'm lost in this dark night when depression takes over and
fills my eyes with bleeding tears.

Life has turned to grey.Ttrapped inside a vision of pain.
I hate this life and I hate this cruel world.
My eyes don't need to see becuase my mind can feel.
I'm standing lost again. I dream with the night of a better 
day
when the truth comes out to be filled with pain.

Lost withing this feeling.
The black world keeps turning. The black time is here.
I'm lost in this dark night when depression takes over and
fills my eyes with bleeding tears.
