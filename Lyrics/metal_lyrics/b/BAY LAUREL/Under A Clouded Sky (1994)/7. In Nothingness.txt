I'm lost within my dreams.
Hiding from the life that I'll never see.
Nothing to see and nothing to feel.
My body is no longer a part of me.
I'm away... I'm alone...

In nothingness I can't see your endless suffering.
I can't see your red eyes.
In nothingness I can close the doors to the world.
I'm in nothingness while time dies.

I see faces in fear. I hear screams in pain.
I'm standing impassive with indifferent eyes
because I don't feel the reality in the world outside
and I don't feel the fear that is dragging me down.
I'm away... I'm alone...

In nothingness I can't see your endless suffering.
I can't see your red eyes.
In nothingness I can close the doors to the world.
I'm in nothingness while time dies.

Searching hands are trying to help but for me they are 
stealing.
Trying to take my inner world from me.
Taking my world from me.
Please let me be.

Don't talk to me becuase I'm not even listening.
Don't take my hand to make me see the fear.
Take away the flowers you've brought me because
they are reminding me of the world outside.
I'm fading away into a deeper life
where dreams are dwelling and feelings are gone.
I'm all alone when you're all here.
I'm alone...
In nothingness.
