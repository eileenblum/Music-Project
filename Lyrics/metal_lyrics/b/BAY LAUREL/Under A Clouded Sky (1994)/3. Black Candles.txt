Drop your final hope into the abyss of fear.
Lay down your wings to never fly again.
Walk with the shadows to the darkened place inside you mind.
Light the fire and mourn for the passed times.

For the night, light up the black candles.
To feel the grief, light up the black candles.

Leave your dreams and seek the sanity.
The sanity within this peaceful darkness.
Bring your mind to a deeper life.
Take your final hope and leave it in the abyss of fear.

For the night, light up the black candles.
To feel the grief, light up the black candles.
