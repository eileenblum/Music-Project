I'm locked in here, crimson skies has fallen
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
I'm scared of the cold outside
But when you warmed my frozen world
I felt truly free and I almost forgot that you'd soon be gone

I'm back again, it's so black again

I wish I knew
Lets all drown in the fleeting silence
Somehow I lost my way, somewhere out there
I lost my faith in life
And now I fighting the present lousing for you
Drifting in sorrows tide

And the sadness comes with darkness as you fall
Vanished when you know I need your spark
I gaze in rain I gaze into the night where you went down
The sleeping world is gone before my eyes but when you die

In your fires eye I've been tumbling around
Been burnt a hundred times but I don't want to get out
In your nightfall I've been flushed away
To lake of tears a lake of dreams
Drifting around in our own sorrows tide

And the sadness comes with darkness as you fall
Vanished when you know I need your spark
I gaze in rain I gaze into the night where you went down
The sleeping world is gone before my eyes but when you die

In sorrows tide
