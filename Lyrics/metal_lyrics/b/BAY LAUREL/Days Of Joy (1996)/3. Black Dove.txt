She's been out black dove no pride
She's been out breaking your seals
She's been out you'll never sleep with her again
She's been out a few hours too long

She's been out a few hours too long
She's been out breaking all the seals in the world
Black dove no pride you wish her dead again
Black dove no pride you'll make her bleed again
Black dove...

Pouring tears on her precious skin
Bloodstained carpet in your room of decay
Underneath the jealousy rules
You're screaming until you drop... dead

Paint black nothings left helpless she's crying
Once she was beautiful but now disgust is all
You see nothings left, mighty fist crush her bones
God is dead mighty fist crush her soul

See the fear in her eyes feel the fear
Death lies on your bedroom floor
You'll make the black dove fall

Pouring tears on her precious skin
Bloodstained carpet in your room of decay
Underneath the jealousy rules
You're screaming until you drop... dead

She's been out black dove no pride
She's been out breaking your seals
She's been out you'll never sleep with her again
She's been out a few hours too long
