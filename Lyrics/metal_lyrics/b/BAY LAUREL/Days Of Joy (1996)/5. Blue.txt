Blue eyes on fire, gushing hate inside
Blue sky you're higher everytime I try to climb
With cold hands you stripped me
And left me screaming on the floor
Sail on to enchanted world
I'm lying dead behind

Blue ocean of grief
Take me to your kingdom
I'll never reach the skies
So let me drown in your sorrows
When I break your surface
I'll never fall again. I'm blue...

Blue eyes on fire, gushing hate inside
Blue sky you're higher everytime I try to climb
I reached out in vain
Your touch was cold as death
I can never reach you, so I die...

Blue ocean of grief
Take me to your kingdom
I'll never reach the skies
So let me drown in your sorrows
When I break your surface
I'll never fall again. I'm blue...
