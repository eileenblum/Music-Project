Turning back to you
You once where the days that shined
Now the dark breaks through
And will you ever smile
Like you used to do

Grey snow dies
Winter falls beyond our cries
You're staring into the wall
And you know I won't leave
We can kill some more

We're waiting for forgiveness
And we're waiting for the fall
Noone seems to learn
And we'll always end up torn.....apart

Bring in the thunder
Let us just die
In here nothing is left
So why keep on fighting

Love is in ashes
Despair in this room
My heart turned to stone
But right now I'm lost and weak

We're waiting for forgiveness
And we're waiting for the fall
Noone seems to learn
And we'll always end up torn.....apart

Turning back to you
You once where the days that shined
Now the dark breaks through
And will you ever smile
Like you used to do

We're waiting for forgiveness
And we're waiting for the fall
Noone seems to learn
And we'll always end up torn.....apart
