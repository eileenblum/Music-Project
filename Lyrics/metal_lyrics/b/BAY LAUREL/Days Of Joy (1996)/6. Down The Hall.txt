Take me down the hall
Take me slow baby
Taken me from my stinking home
Mother take me down

My love is gone, yeah
Thousands miles away and
The red wine is pouring day
Another hangover has blown away

The town lies cold outside
I'm lying cold inside
Somehow something went wrong
Somewhere somebody's crying
But i'm home...

Down the hall
Fuck me dead and leave me baby
When my soul is gone
The sun will burn down the hall
