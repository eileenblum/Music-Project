Kill me dear because I'm weak
I've never felt so much
Kill me sweet because I'm the dark
Lurking in your big red heart
I treat you bad sometimes I know I've been wrong
Our love can be sick and tiring but I'm not the only one, yeah

Take me where I have to be
I used to think that you would
Take where the dreams we used to have
Push it against the wall
Into the time with pain slice up out healed hearts
The fire will burn you but I have to die, yeah

Our hangman will wait until the end
Our hangman will smile he knows you can
There is no need to let me slip by
Make me feel closer... my grave

Somewhere we lost our path
Somehow we lost our love

Kill me dear because I'm weak
I've never felt so much
Kill me sweet because I'm the dark
Lurking in your big red heart
Into the time with pain slice up out healed hearts
The fire will burn you but I have to die, yeah

Our hangman will wait until the end
Our hangman will smile he knows you can
There is no need to let me slip by
Make me feel closer... my grave
