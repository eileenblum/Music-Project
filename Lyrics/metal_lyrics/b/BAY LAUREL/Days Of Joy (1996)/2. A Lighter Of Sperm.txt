Raging liars are buring my hair with a lighter of sperm
Oh, she's sweet and lonely sex is our world and god is a pervert
Blossoms blossoms see them grin hair is burning hair is stinking
I'm stuck in this town and I rot

Black blood is flushing inside my veins
Blond hair is burning in mellow flames

A violent crowd of angels are crushing our hours with love
The boys and the girls have gathered tonight
So we shoot them down with our brand new guns
Bloodshed bloodshed outside our filthy house
Our god is wheeping but we are laughing tonight

Black blood is flushing inside my veins
Blond hair is burning in mellow flames
The gods are crying where slaves of devils breed
Our souls are dying I'm a lighter of sperm

Sadness fills the room and the friends I've had are leaving
I didn't realize you told me today was the last day we spent up here
Sadness sadness I didn't think I would feel this way I remember
And I know that it will never be the same again

Black blood is flushing inside my veins
Blond hair is burning in mellow flames
The gods are crying where slaves of devils breed
Our souls are dying I'm a lighter of sperm
