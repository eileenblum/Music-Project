I feel them crawling under my skin
I'm a home for the worms inside
I'm not starving I'm fat and warm
I can feed all the warms in the world
Just dig in my flesh it's yours
I'll show my friends with pride
They'll beat me up and say goodbye

I'm waiting for the summer baby
I'll be swallen up
In the heat I will explode and
Cover you with worms and blood

I feel them feast under my skin
Slowly I rot, slowly I cry
Spring is burning in my eyes
Suck me swallow me feed your filthy lies
Kill me rape me and when my time is through forget me
I'll die before my friends with pride
They'll spit on my corpse and say goodbye

I'm waiting for the summer baby
I'll be swallen up
In the heat I will explode and
Cover you with worms and blood
