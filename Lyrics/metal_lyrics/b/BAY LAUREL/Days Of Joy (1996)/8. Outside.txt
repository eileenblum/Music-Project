Gazing, pale black eyes
Longing, to see them
Bleed for his needs and cry for their lost lifes
He's telling us all but we're cold and small
I can't feel. I'm just bored and out of reach

Life is our only world
I'm watching the wicked play outside
Life is our only world
I'm watching the wicked play outside

We will hide the reasons come close
And die with empty eyes he will
Kill your sweet dreams stragle your whole world
He's growing inside, under blackend skies
I can't feel I'm tired and I don't care.

Life is our only world
I'm watching the wicked play outside
Life is our only world
I'm watching the wicked play outside

Fill me some more, I'm waiting for your blood
He's telling us all but we're cold and small
I can't feel I've seen in all before

Life is our only world
I'm watching the wicked play outside
Life is our only world
I'm watching the wicked play outside
