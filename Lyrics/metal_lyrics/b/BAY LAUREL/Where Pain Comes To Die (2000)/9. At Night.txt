It's all too late. The sun won't rise again.
I'm so ashamed and there's nothing that I wouldn't do for you.

Full of life but tired.
In the night we cry.

I'm so afraid but I'm trying hard not to show.
It's all unreal. I try to be strong but I feel so alone.

Full of life but tired.
In the night we cry.

Let us out of this dark ride. It's time to make things right love.
Time to sort things out. Let us out.

I'll give all I got. I'll try to be good.
Just make it through the night until dawn.
I'll give up my life. I'll give you my soul.
If only I remember this time.
It's all a lie.
