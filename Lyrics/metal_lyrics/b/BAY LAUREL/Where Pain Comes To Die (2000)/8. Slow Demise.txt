You're down so let me in.
Crawl beside me as I descend.
Try not to cry.
I hate your tears, they make me feel so alive.
In different times, in different lives.
I could have made you happy. Now it's all too hard.
I've become so cold.
Something is dead. I'm not the one you loved.

Wicked cold slow demise.
A desperate try to find something to hold on to.
Something that lasts for me and you.
Strange desire. Slow demise.

When I'm gone I miss the warmth.
When I'm home it seems we're trapped in the cold.
Eyes, tired and dull.
I don't want to loose what makes it worth while.
Maybe we could try to move on.
Try to find something new without any goals.
Time to move on.
Try to move on.

Wicked cold slow demise.
A desperate try to find something to hold on to.
Something that lasts for me and you.
Strange desire. Slow demise.
