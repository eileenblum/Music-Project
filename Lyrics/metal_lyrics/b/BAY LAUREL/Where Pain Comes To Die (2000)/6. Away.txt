I don't get rid of the fear that's growing inside my restless mind.
Something is chasing me I got to move on.
Got to find something new to get me one step further away.

I don't want to stop to think. I just want to move.
You don't know the anguish I'm going through.
It's in my mind. It's in my blood.
Someone please help me to get me one step further away.

We're talking about the days to come but we're not in the same world
