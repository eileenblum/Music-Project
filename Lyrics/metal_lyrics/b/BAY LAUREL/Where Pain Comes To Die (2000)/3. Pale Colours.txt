Today we're through with this life.
Today there's no need to try.
The time is here but we've got nothing to fear.
We're not alone but it's so hard to go.

And you know...
It's much better now when I'm gone.

Pale colours of life. The world that we made has died.
Now we're bitter and weak. Sometimes it's better to leave.
The time is here but we've got nothing to fear.
We're not alone but it's so hard to go.

And you know...
It's much better now when I'm gone.
