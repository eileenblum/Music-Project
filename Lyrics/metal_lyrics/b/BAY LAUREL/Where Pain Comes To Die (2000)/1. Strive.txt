Mesmerized I swallow a piece of your toxic mind, a taste of decease.
I don't know why you've chosen me to be one of the guinea pigs in your game.
Now I'm a wreck in hell to please you.

In this life we strive to feel so fine, to feel so alive.
On the way there's something new to try.
I swallow a piece and hope it's not a lie.

All around there are people who feel that it's all about the things that we need.
It's not right what you've done to me but it might be a way to make them see.
Now I'm a wreck in hell to please you.

In this life we strive to feel so fine, to feel so alive.
On the way there's something new to try.
I swallow a piece and hope it's not a lie.
