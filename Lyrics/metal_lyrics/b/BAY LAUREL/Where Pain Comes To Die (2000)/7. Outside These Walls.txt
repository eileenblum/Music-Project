Don't make me stay here too long.
This day is too good and I'm so tired.
Tired of waiting for you to come.
Today I must face what's been after me so long.

Outside these walls.
Words don't mean much but you want it done.
Outside these walls.
You can do what you always do.
I'm in here for you.

Don't make me stay here too long.
I just want to find a flow where I can glide.
Get to the end of what I do.
Something is wrong but it's all here for you.

Outside these walls.
Words don't mean much but you want it done.
Outside these walls.
You can do what you always do.
I'm in here for you.
