On my way up I trip and start to fall.
This state of mind takes away the will to fight.

Scared, and certain to die. Running into a wall of anxiety.
Cold, but not alone. You're always beside me.
I want you to take me from this darkness.
I want to move on. I want to be strong but it's hard.

Feelings that I hide crush me like a child.
It's taking over. Making me realise, there's more inside.

Scared, and certain to die. Running into a wall of anxiety.
Cold, but not alone. You're always beside me.
I want you to take me from this darkness.
I want to move on. I want to be strong but it's hard.
