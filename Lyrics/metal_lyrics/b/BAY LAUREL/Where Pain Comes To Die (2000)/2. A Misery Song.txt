Getting away from here.
A line of people just like me.
My hometown is covered in blood.
I don't know what's about to come.

At night the madness starts. We watch the darkness fall.
We're all afraid to walk into the flames.
The night has just begun. We're all on the run.
The sirens wail, cuts through my body and soul.
A misery song.

The night is cold and we're so tired.
Someone's screaming, fear is or guide.
Close together walking in pain.
People crying for help in vain.

Death is all around. We're praying not to be found.
It's so unreal when beautiful lights fall down.
To the ground with a sound that shivers down my spine.
The sirens wail, cuts through my body and soul.
A misery song.
