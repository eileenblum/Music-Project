Feeling tired, bitter and weak.
We're trying to keep the dead from falling asleep.
Something is lost and it's hard to tell right from wrong.
There's a war going on, it's breaking us down.
At least we're not all alone in this cold.

It's time to call our God and ask what's wrong.
I know I was wrong but there's so much to come.
I don't want to see all this pain around me.
So call...

It's all going down when everything's fine.
We need a cure but we don't know what for.
It's sad but there's no one to blame. Time is always right.
Maybe it's just who we are, the game that we play.
To leave must be better then end up this way.

It's time to call our God and ask what's wrong.
I know I was wrong but there's so much to come.
I don't want to see all this pain around me.
So call..
Please call..
