A day like this. In a room far from bliss.
The world is right outside with an offer I must refuse.

I've been here too long. Waiting for something to come.
Dead faces on the wall. Show me how to get on.

Take me down that long bright road.
The time is now so let's leave this town.
A way to come alive and a reason to get out.
A place where pain comes to die.

The days roll by. I'm still here but time's running out.
Climbing on the walls.
It's taking my mind, it's stealing my time again.

Always the same. Nothing changes, never will.
I just have to get rid of the pressure on my chest,
the pounding thought of not getting there.

Take me down that long bright road.
The time is now so let's leave this town.
A way to come alive and a reason to get out.
A place where pain comes to die
