There is no way to stop me
But you're free to take your chances and try
Lock me up, try to break me down
Like a bullet I'll shoot straight for the sky

While my soul is on fire
All my dreams are just a heart beat away
But on the toll of the morning bell
I must hide it till the end of the day
And fly away

Calling hero in the cold night
Calling someone to amend this world we're in
Someone who'll stand up when all else fall

There's a rumor going around
And they say you're gonna save us
Cause the greatest hero lies within us all

Yeah, within us all

Tell me is there still justice
In our world that's run by madness and hate
When blind violence rules in the streets
Show a sign that we can all still be saved

Shining bright in the moonlight
Pushing hard against the weight of the world
Keep surviving against all odds
Break 'em down and go for glory again
They'll never win

Calling hero in the cold night
Calling someone to amend this world we're in
Someone who'll stand up when all else fall

There's a rumor going around
And they say you're gonna save us
Cause the greatest hero lies within us all

I'm still calling for a hero
Calling someone to amend this world we're in
Someone who'll stand up when all else fall

When I hear thunder in the night
I just know that you can save me
'Cause the greatest hero lies within us all

Yeah, yeah, yeah, the greatest hero
Yeah, yeah, yeah, lies within us all
