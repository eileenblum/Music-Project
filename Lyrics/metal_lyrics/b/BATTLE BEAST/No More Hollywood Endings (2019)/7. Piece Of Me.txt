Hey you, what's going on
The fire is burning hot
No use, can't make this up
We're gonna go and fuck shit up
Going on and on
All shame is gone
You're gonna scream and shout it loud
You need
Getting pleased
Got to bleed
Up to speed
Come on

'Cause you want a piece of me
The only thing you ever need
Just a little piece of me
The only thing you ever need
You're burning

Dream on, you crazy fool
Who the fuck do you think you are
Good lord, you need to pray
No one's gonna save you now
Twisting your head
Ripping it to shreds
Your ego undefined
Gonna crush
Gonna grind
Gonna kill
Gonna thrive
I'm a queen

And you want a piece of me
The only thing you ever need
Just a little piece of me
The only thing you ever need
You're burning

And on and on it goes
You need to take it slow
And on and on it goes

'Cause you just want a piece of me
The only thing you ever need
Just a little piece of me
The only thing you ever need
You fool

'Cause you want a piece of me
The only thing you ever need
Just a little piece of me
The only thing you ever need
Dream on...
