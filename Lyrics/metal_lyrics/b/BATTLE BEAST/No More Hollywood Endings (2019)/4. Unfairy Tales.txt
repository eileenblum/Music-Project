My dreams and secrets
Are no more just mine
Ripped on the screens
You're next in line

Twisted terms of use
In this dark house of cards
For hidden abuse
From cradle to graveyard

Who keeps my memories?
Are they friends or enemies?
We ain't just ones and zeros
But human souls
Falling into rabbit holes

What makes us human
Is now on sale
Crushed for the sake
Of unfairy tales
Where heroes fall
And justice crawls
Is this the end?

Creating memory holes
They steal the rights
Of our troubled souls
Blinded by blue light

It wasn't a free ride
In this insane loop
Got nowhere to hide
I made a deal with my doom

Who keeps my memories?
Are they friends or enemies?
We ain't just ones and zeros
But human souls
Falling into rabbit holes

What makes us human
Is now on sale
Crushed for the sake
Of unfairy tales
For twisted dreams
For endless greed
We want it back!

Time goes by far too fast
It's hard to see the present and past
Once freedom was liberty
Now liberty is privacy

What makes us human
Is now on sale
Crushed for the sake
Of unfairy tales
Where heroes fall
And justice crawls
Is this the end?

Crushed for the sake
Of Unfairy tales
For twisted dreams
For endless greed
We want it back!
