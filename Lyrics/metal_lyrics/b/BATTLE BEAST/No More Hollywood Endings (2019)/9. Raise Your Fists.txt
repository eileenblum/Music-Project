With power
We've come so far
Through valleys
And mountains high
Flame eternal burns in your hearts
Hear the call
Raise your fist into the sky

Rise up you beasts and critters
Wake up from eternal sleep
Time has come to claim your place
In the halls of twilight
Gather your strength and trust your instincts
Bend the earth, move the seas from the way
You're strong, now go and carve your path through aeons

With power
We've come so far
Through valleys
And mountains high
Flame eternal burns in your hearts
Hear the call
Raise your fist into the sky

A mighty blast, that's what you're craving
Gushing through the storms within
Earthquakes nor tides won't stop you from racing forward
Run wild through peaks and ridges
Break a path through fire and ice
All that you dreamed of are now yours for the taking

With power
We've come so far
Through valleys
And mountains high
Flame eternal burns in your hearts
Hear the call
Raise your fist into the sky

No one can stop you...

Against the storm!

"Behold the might of the sea and sky as they clash in a storm of frozen bitterness
In a whirl of fire he runs through the night and takes his toll on mankind
He's fierce, he's strong, his will is made of the hardest iron
A Titan, risen from Earth, Wind and Fire, he storms through the night"

With power
We've come so far
Through valleys
And mountains high
Flame eternal burns in your hearts
Hear the call
Raise your fist into the sky
