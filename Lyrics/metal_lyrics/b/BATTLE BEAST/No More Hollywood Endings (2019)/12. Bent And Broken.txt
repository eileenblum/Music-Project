I see your scars, your tears
And the pain in your heart
It's killing me, consuming
My soul and all beyond

You're bent and broken
You're bent and broken
You're bent and broken
You're bent and broken

Come closer now, hold me
And please keep me warm
So much agony, so much pain
Please save me now

I'm bent and broken
I'm bent and broken
I'm bent and broken
I'm bent and broken

All that you fear is bound inside
You fight, you die
All that despair just makes you blind
You're crucified by lies

You're bent and broken
You're bent and broken
You're bent and broken
You're bent and broken

You're bent and broken
You're bent and broken
You're bent and broken
I'm bent and broken
