Venom keeps on running through our veins
It keeps on haunting our mortal remains
We're playing with fire
And the flames grow higher and higher

This must be my last dream
I see the skies falling
Is this now my last scream?

When city lights
Hide all the stars tonight
Forever is too far away
In the end
Deep darkness will descend
It's not too late to change our way

Wildfires are dancing on our graves
Ice sheets are drowning under the waves
We're filling with poison
It's not too late, we still have choices

This must be my last dream
I see the skies falling
Is this now my last scream?

When city lights
Hide all the stars tonight
Forever is too far away
In the end
Deep darkness will descend
It's not too late to change our way

It doesn't mean it's fake
'Cause you don't like it
It's not a mistake
'Cause you don't get it
It doesn't mean it's fake
'Cause you don't like it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa-whoa

When city lights
Hide all the stars tonight
Forever is too far away
In the end
Deep darkness will descend
It's not too late to change our way

(The news is fake
'Cause so much of the news is fake)
To change our way
(But they can make anything bad
Because they are the fake, fake, disgusting news)
To change our way
