Underneath the silent skies
All the stars are out of sight
On the empty street
My sorrow and me

Those trees have grown much taller
While I was finding my way
That playground seems smaller
Than back in the day

I knew the world I'm from
The future was still to come
I'm coming home
Feeling unknown

I wish you could see me now (You could see me now)
I think you would be proud (You would be proud)
You said one day I would understand
But I'm still waiting for Peter Pan

I wish you could see me now (You could see me now)
I think you would be proud (You would be proud)
You said one day I would understand
But I just want you to hold my hand

They say I'm a lot like you
Wish you were here too
You didn't see me growing old
Didn't see me getting strong

It's time for words from a sermon
Time to say the last goodbyes
Time for coffee and bourbon
I just want our last goodnights

I whisper to the ground:
"Thought you would always be around"
Wish you were not alone
In the great unknown

I wish you could see me now (You could see me now)
I think you would be proud (You would be proud)
You said one day I would understand
But I'm still waiting for Peter Pan

I wish you could see me now (You could see me now)
I think you would be proud (You would be proud)
You said one day I would understand
But I just want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
