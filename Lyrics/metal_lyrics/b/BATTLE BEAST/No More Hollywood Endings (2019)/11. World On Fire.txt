A path to the great unknown
A wiser man's tale
Spinning out of control
I need you right now
Hope and prayers burning insides out
A wish to be with you, my heart and soul

Take my hand
Let's face the world on fire
A glorious stand
Through most chaotic times

Hold my hand
Let's face the world on fire
You're the one for me
You're all I ever need

Together we're standing tall
Through every stumble
Mending our broken souls
By each other
Love is burning bright, embrace it now
A tale from lullabies and stories told

Take my hand
Let's face the world on fire
A glorious stand
Through most chaotic times

Hold my hand
Let's face the world on fire
You're the one for me
You're all I ever need

A fate divine, our everlasting fire
It burns so bright, where a thousand stars align
No fear
No pain
You and me against the rain
Eternal glory unfolding

Take my hand
Let's face the world on fire
A glorious stand
Through most chaotic times

Hold my hand
Let's face the world on fire
You're the one for me
You're all I ever need
