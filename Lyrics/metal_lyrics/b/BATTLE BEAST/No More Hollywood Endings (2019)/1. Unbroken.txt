It was a sunny afternoon
Her name was on the cake
Lots of red balloons
But nobody came

She said, "Mum, don't you worry, everything's alright"
Through her tears it all looks blurry
She's broken inside

As the sun is falling
It echoes in her head
Distant voices laughing
All the things they've said

How to call for help
When nobody hears
How to hide inside her hell
Blinded by tears

She keeps on praying:
"Just let me be!"
She keeps on hiding
But no friend seeks

Your weeping heart
Is growing stronger
A soul full of dreams
Remains unbroken

You're not alone
You're not alone

It hurts deep within
In the silence it screams
It crawls on her skin
And haunts her dreams

Their smiles were always fake
Her tears were always real
Though the heart now breaks
In the end the wound will heal

She keeps on asking:
"Why me?"
She keeps on hiding
But no friend seeks

Your weeping heart
Is growing stronger
A soul full of dreams
Remains unbroken

You're not alone
You're not alone

I promise you
I've been there too

Beast of my past
You've sealed your fate
I'm free at last
Won't waste my hate
I don't forgive you
I won't pretend
I will forget you
Don't call me a friend

Let someone know
You're not alone
I promise you
I've been there too
