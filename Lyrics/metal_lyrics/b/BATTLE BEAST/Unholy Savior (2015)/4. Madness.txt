One and only reality
Fatal journey to infinity
Chase the monster of the seven seas
Face it, kill it, and you'll be free
I am thy strength, I am thy sword

My name is madness
And I'm the light you need in darkness
You can't escape from me
'Cause I'm madness
And I will tear your soul apart
We die as one
As one

Know your demons to know where to strike
Dark is their home and well they hide
Bloodbound battle, a quest for truth
I'm the last one to die in you
I am berserk, I fear no fear

My name is madness
And I will hunt you down in darkness
You can't escape from me
'Cause I'm madness
The demon slayer in your head
I'm always there

No one can hear you scream
No one will find you
There's no way out of here alive

[Chorus 2x]

Until the end
