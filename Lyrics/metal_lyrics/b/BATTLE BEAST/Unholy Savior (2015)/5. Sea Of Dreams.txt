I, I still remember the feeling deep divine
But time has stolen my love for you
Oh angel, my beauty in white

The kiss of death is all I need

Set me free from the night
To a place without a name
Wake me up from the sea of dreams

Now, now the storm is over
And the sky is clear
The ruins of my past
Are standing so still and silent
Fading into eternal sleep

My frozen eyes have opened up
The dreamcarnation is dead

Set me free from the night
To a place without a name
Wake me up from the sea of dreams

Guide me through all the dark
Into the glory of the heavens
Rising up from the sea of dreams

Set me free from the night
To a place without a name
Wake me up from the sea of dreams

Guide me through all the dark
Into the glory of the heavens
Rising up from the sea of dreams
Sky-high

Take my dream
Take my everything
I'll be nowhere to be found
