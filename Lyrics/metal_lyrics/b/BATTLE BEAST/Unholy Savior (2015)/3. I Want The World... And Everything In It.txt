Got the eye of the tiger
You will see me touch the sky
Come power and glory, all just for one man
On the road to the castle, sacrifices must be made
Can you see the fire in my hungry eyes?

I want the world and everything in it
I'll take it all with my passion and my crime
I want the world and you along with it
Living like there's no tomorrow

I steal from the heavens
I receive rewards from hell
No way I'm gonna let my dream slip through my hands
Too drunk on power to tell who's friend, who's foe
Get away, bloody vultures, who feed upon my flame

I want the world and everything in it
I'll take it all with my passion and my crime
I want the world and you along with it
Live and love just like a wild child

I want the world and everything in it
I'll take it all with my passion and my crime
I want the world and you along with it
Living like there's no tomorrow - one more time!

I want the world and everything in it
I'll take it all with my passion and my crime
I want the world and you along with it
Live and love just like a wild child

I want the world, yeah
