I am all that you remember
Among the buried memories
I'm the tears running down your face
I'm the angel who sings you to sleep

When you cry in silence
When you feel all alone
Angel cry

I'm the love that you desire
I'm a secret just one heartbeat away
You don't have to reach for me
'cause I'm already yours

When you cry in silence
When you feel all alone
When you cry in sadness
Weep in darkness
Cry your tears into sleep

When you cry in madness
Faceless darkness
Cry your pain into me
Oh, angel cry
