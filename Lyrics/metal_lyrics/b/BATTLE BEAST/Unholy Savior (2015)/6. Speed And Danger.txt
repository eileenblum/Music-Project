Are you a mad man or a girl gone insane?
You're welcome to join our circles of doom
Taking no orders, we spit on the rules
You got what you came for, it's race or die!

Speed and danger, speed and danger
Nitro in my veins
Speed and danger, speed and danger
Driving me insane
Car wrecks and bodies and damage beyond repair
Its kill or be killed
That's how you play this game

Put your pedal to the metal, it's time to rock and ride!
Keep the engine roaring louder than hell
Machine guns are singing
Can you hear the dying screams?
Better to die with your boots on than beg for mercy

Speed and danger, speed and danger
Nitro in my veins
Speed and danger, speed and danger
Driving me insane
Car wrecks and bodies and damage beyond repair
It's kill or be killed
That's how you play this game

Get out of my way, man
Get out of my way now
Get out of my way, man, or you will die

[Chorus 2x]

Whoa yeah!
