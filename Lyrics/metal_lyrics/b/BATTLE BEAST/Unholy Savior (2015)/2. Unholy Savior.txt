Silent cries
Desperate sighs
An endless run in fear

Who am I?
A godless child?
The answer escapes my mind

Drag me deep
Steal my screams
To oblivion I kneel

Flay my flesh
In torture's nest
Hell's desire manifests

Unholy savior awakens within
Salvation in disguise
The undreaming darkness

Unseen skies
Oceans beyond
The birthplace of my kind

Lost in lies
Dreaming blind
Truth can wear no crown

Unholy savior awakens within
Salvation in disguise
The undreaming darkness

A graven image, a hero to some
Destroyer, cold as death
The slayer of hearts

Unholy savior, forever to be
Salvation in disguise
The undreaming darkness

I'm a shadow in the corner
Begging to be found
Suffering in silence
As the world spins round and round

[Chorus]

Salvation in disguise
