I hate to watch how you fall apart
I hate to be in the scars of your heart
Does it matter who is wrong or right
I will end this hell tonight

If one day I've los all the games
And drfit along without a name
If in the end I'm all alone
Please find me in the great unknown
I'll be somewhere in the dark
Maybe I'll heave learn my part
Please save me from what I have become

Far from heaven
So keep me far from heaven
I can never be forgiven
For knowing one day I would leave

Far from heaven
So keep me far from heaven
There was never a you and me
There was only me

I had the power to pull you underneath
To hold you down until you couldn't breathe
I didn't care, I didn't even try
I just made you burn and cry

If there's no one left to blame
Where we don't need a name
If in the end I'm all alone
Please find me in the great unknown
I'll be somewhere in the dark
Maybe I'll heave learn my part
Please save me from what I have become

Far from heaven
So keep me far from heaven
There was never a you and me
There was only me

Far from heaven
So keep me far from heaven
I can never be forgiven
For making you believe

Far from heaven
So keep me far from heaven
We were never meant to be
There was only me
