Conceived by the god of thunder
Walking on the earth
Born and risig by Viking brethren
Soon he'll rule the world

Master of the sword and axe
Training 'til the day turns dark
Power and beautiful
He's gonna face the demon hordes

Bastard son of Odin
Born to kick your ass
Bastard son of Odin
Living hard and driving fast
Bastard son of Odin
Sworn to fight and die
Bastard son of Odin
To Valhalla soon will ride

Legends spreading like wild fire
Of his mighty deeds
Roaming through the lands and oceans
Like a fiery breeze

Once he's got the taste of you
There's no turning back 
Brace yourselves to be consumed
For now he will attack

Bastard son of Odin
Born to kick your ass
Bastard son of Odin
Living hard and driving fast
Bastard son of Odin
Sworn to fight and die
Bastard son of Odin
To Valhalla soon will ride

The halls of Valhalla have heard the cries
Thou shalt be the ruler of Asgard
Now go my son, and ride!

Bastard son of Odin
Born to kick your ass
Bastard son of Odin
Living hard and driving fast
Bastard son of Odin
Sworn to fight and die
Bastard son of Odin
To Valhalla soon will ride
