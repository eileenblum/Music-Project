Am I dead or just asleep?
Did I dive into the deep?
I'm lost in black
I see no wound, I see no blood
But I'm buried the mud
Can't find my way back

I am coming out of hell
I saw how angels fell
I'm not the same
Just watch me coming out of hell
I'm still here, alive and well
I'm not the same anymore

Like in endless dream
I am dancing with the beast
Faster and faster
Spinning in this twisted feast
I am dancing with the beast
Running on melting ice
It was the last roll of th dice
Every time

Oh, it hounds me when I fall
In the shadows in the wall
I hear it's call
In a nightmare, not asleep
Without light and without dreams
The beast is in me

A creature from the other side
It's walking by my side
All this time
It is burning but won't kill
I still have my mind and will
I save my last dance for me

Like in endless dream
I am dancing with the beast
Faster and faster
Spinning in this twisted feast
I am dancing with the beast
Running on melting ice
It was the last roll of th dice
Every time

I'm dancing with the beast
I'm dancing with the beast
I'm dancing with the beast
I'm dancing with the beast

Like in endless dream
I am dancing with the beast
Faster and faster
Spinning in this twisted feast
I am dancing with the beast
Running on melting ice
It was the last roll of th dice
Every time
