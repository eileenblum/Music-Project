Good evening ladies and gentlemen
On the Battle Beast radio tonight: Rock trash
These guys really got the license to rock

My mum used to smoke too much hash
Maybe that's why I ain't no slash
But somehow I picked the right card
And ended up here, just to party hard

We have a license to rock
Wake up the whole block
Create a heavy shock
Because

We are rock trash
The lust for life
The crazy nights
Make us feel alive
We are rock trash
We don't blush
We don't hush
Until we crash

Oh well, that was something I didn't expect
Let's try something a little bit less trash
Oh dear, is that Battle Beast coming in?

I don't care what happened to the cash
Tomorrow in my brain titans will clash
I could hit the brakes and meditate
But I'll misbehave and bang my head

We have a license to rock
Wake up the whole block
Create a heavy shock
Because

We are rock trash
The lust for life
The crazy nights
Make us feel alive
We are rock trash
We don't blush
We don't hush
Until we crash

I wake up, don't know where I am
I hear a language I don't understand
Was our afterparty in another land?
I see a reindeer, am I in Lapland?

Oh God, I wanna go back to Tampere

Rock trash, come on!

We are rock trash
The lust for life
The crazy nights
Make us feel alive
We are rock trash
We don't blush
We don't hush
Until we crash

Rock trash!
