We can be your new best friend
Or make you suffer 'till the end
You will bleed for our greed
We are masters of disaster

How can the stars glow
Above this creepy show
Which lie to chose
To believe and use

We feed the fear

The sun as gone
A long time ago
We're waiting for the dawn
That will never show
Our hearts are getting hard
Souls covered by scars
We are made of stars
But we are lost in wars

Lost in wars

We're the ones you never see
Spilling blood but staying clean
Committing crimes but walking free
'Cause we own those who make the law

Stolen yesterdays
Tomorrows drift away
No dreams to dream
The nightmare became real

Screams in the night
My dark lullaby
No melody
Repeating endlessly

We feed the fear

The sun as gone
A long time ago
We're waiting for the dawn
That will never show
Our hearts are getting hard
Souls covered by scars
We are made of stars
But we are lost in wars

We take away your right to speak
We take away your voice
This game ain't no hide and seek
You don't have a choice

Hungry machine keeps on turning
Doing crimes that won't get cold
We're burning down our future
Turning Gaia into gold

The sun as gone
A long time ago
We're waiting for the dawn
That will never show
Our hearts are getting hard
Souls covered by scars
We are made of stars
But we are lost in wars
