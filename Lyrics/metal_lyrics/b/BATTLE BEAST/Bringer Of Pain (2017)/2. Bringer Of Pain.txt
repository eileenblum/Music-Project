The stream of blood and tears
Are running down the hills of glory
Now men are fighting
They are dying for a cause unknown
For they were never told
The reason for their sacrifice
And now the truth comes out
There is no doubt
Their fate as been sealed
Forever!

No one will hold
The bringer of pain
She'll make you kneel
The bringer of pain

The smell of agony and burning flesh
Now fills the air
The rusting swords
Slitting open necks 'n' guts 'n' hair
It's time to fight or die
You can't scape your destiny
Grab it by the horns, forget your flaws
Embrace the judgament day
Her payday

No one will hold
The bringer of pain
She'll make you kneel
The bringer of pain

You will be taken down
There 's no way out

No one will hold
The bringer of pain
She'll make you kneel
The bringer of pain
