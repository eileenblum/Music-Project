Behold the living God
A power inhumane
The burning of the blood
I'm the venom in your veins

A savior sent to earth
The one to bring the pain
Into a grand rebirth
From armageddon's flames

Glory for eternities
To claim the trone
Kingdom of a thousand years
We stand alone
Offer me your sacrifice
There's no scape
Fall into my arms again
Into my cold embrace

Raise your hand to hail your king
While the world is crumbling
See the flags rise and fall
For the God of war

All united for the cause
Land of glory waits for us
Cities burn, worlds will fall
For the God of war

Those who would resist
Are hammered into dust
Unleash the hounds of hell
To rule at any cost

Ash returns to ash
Lucifer rise again
A beast I'm growing strong
With every life I claim

I will sooth your deepest fears
I'll feed your brain
Drown 'em in a sea of tears
And screams of pain
Face the cruelest mastery
Confess to me
Final truth will set you free
And a slave eternally

Raise your hand to hail your king
While the world is crumbling
See the flags rise and fall
For the God of war

All united for the cause
Land of glory waits for us
Cities burn, worlds will fall
For the God of war

God of war!
