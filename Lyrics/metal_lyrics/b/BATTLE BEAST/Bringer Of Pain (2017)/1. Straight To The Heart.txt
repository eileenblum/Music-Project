In the still of the night
Hear my heart beating through
So won't you come and get
What you've been waiting for
When the moon is high
I'll be hunting for you
And when the night is done
You'll be screaming for
more, more, more

Straight to the heart
Light me up before I'm done
Straight to the heart
Hear the thunder roar
Ooh, my love
We'll never get enough
Straight through your heart!
I'm out for you
And I never miss my mark

No, no!

My wicked love
I'ts the weapond I wield
No need to beg on your knees
I'm always there for you
I am not what you want
But I got what you need
Give into my arms
And I'll set you
Free, free, free

Straight to the heart
Light me up before I'm done
Straight to the heart
Hear the thunder roar
Ooh, my love
We'll never get enough
Straight through your heart!
I'm out for you
And I never miss my mark
