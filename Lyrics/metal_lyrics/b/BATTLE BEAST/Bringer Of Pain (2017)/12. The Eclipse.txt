The sun has died from the sky
Monstrous demons now trive
How did we end up here?
Betrayed... deceived and misled by our savior...

Rise your shields and your swords
Be prepared, no despair, we will fight
Never give up, no retreat, I will be on your side

Call them forth, monster
Use your raw powers
Sacrifice all that
Even you once held dear

The eclipse
The eclipse

All my friends they have died
Their screams pierce Through my mind
Why did I survive?
Revenge... The only thing that keeps me Breathing

Your new powers are great
But you still have to run from my wrath
Hunting you down is my passion
My meaning, My path

Call them forth, monster
Use your raw powers
Sacrifice all that
Even you once held dear

The eclipse
The eclipse
