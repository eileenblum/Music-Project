The dawn is arriving for new day
The field's growing cold silently
I hear the legions marching on, from distance
Thousands of feet they beat the soul
Making the ground play their tune
There's no turning back from here nomore
Prepare for war

We will fight
There's no surrender
To the bitter end of daylight we will stand
We will fight
Always remember
In the darkest times the beast awakes inside

The field gets darker and darker
You're sensing the fear of the dying men
Now you are the voice of the fallen, the sacred
The legions are walking under
The shadows of false, faceless gods
There's no turning back from here no more...
So hear me

We will fight
There's no surrender
To the bitter end of daylight we will stand
We will fight
Always remember
In the darkest times the beast awakes inside

We will fight 'til the end of the daylight
We will stand 'til the dawn of the new day
In the dark times beast awakes inside
