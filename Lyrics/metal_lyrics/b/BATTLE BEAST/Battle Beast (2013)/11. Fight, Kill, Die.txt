Let's go!

This night is perfect for bloodshed
Countless enemies ride ahead
Challenge yourself, no limit for the pain
Fight till the end with Hell hound's rage

It's a soldier's life,
In a world of war
Feel the claws of death
I got the guts to fight the fight
Fight, kill and die

I live to hear the sound of swords in battle
There's no bloodless way for me to die
Gods or demons, animals or men
To me it makes no difference when I go berserk

It's a way of life,
In a world of war
Feel the touch of death
I got the guts to fight the fight
Fight, kill and die

Fight, kill, die

It's a soldier's life,
In a world of war
Feel the claws of death
I got the guts to fight the world
I got the guts to take 'em all
I'm not afraid if I might fall,
'Cos I got the guts to fight the fight
Fight, kill, die
