In the darkness, she's dancing with her lover 
In the silence of her mountain hall she'll rest forever

It's a life of a warrior, who never comes out 
It's a song without music, she's one of a kind
She's a black ninja!
You can't see her in the night
She's a black ninja!
You can feel her in the dark

Close your eyes, feel the magic of the night
lonely voices whispering her ancient name

It's a life of a warrior, who never comes out 
It's a song without music, she's one of a kind
She's a black ninja!
You can't see her in the night
She's a black ninja!
You can feel her in the dark

[Solo]

It's a life of a warrior, who never comes out 
It's a song without music, she's one of a kind
She's a black ninja!
You can't see her in the night
She's a black ninja!
You can feel her in the dark
She's a black ninja!

[Solo]
