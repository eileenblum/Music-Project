A silent watcher, hanging on the edge
Staring into darkness as it stares back at me
it's a long, long way down now in a rain of tears
My future is my past as
I'm chained to the shadow of my dream

Rain Man, bring it on I can take it all
Rain Man, wash away my crimson tears of love
Rain Man, more and more let me feel the pain
Rain Man, it's all crashing down on me

For so long I've tried to get rid of the pain
Tried to fill the void where my heart once was
I thought I had found peace in your embrace
But you're killing me you heavenly Angel of Sin


Rain Man, bring it on i can take it all
Rain Man, wash away my crimson tears of love
Rain Man, more and more let me feel the pain
Rain Man, it's all crashing down on me, yeah 
yeah

Rain Man, bring it on i can take it all
Rain Man, wash away my crimson tears of love
Rain Man, more and more let me feel the pain
Rain Man, it's all crashing down on me, yeah
