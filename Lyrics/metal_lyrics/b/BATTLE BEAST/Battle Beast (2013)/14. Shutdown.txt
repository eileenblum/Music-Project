[German Bonus Track]The saviourâs here, tonight we strike
And they will know what itâs like
To be destroyed, to crash and burn
âCuz we survived and fought the curse
Itâs payback time!

Shutdown, a system overload
Shutdown, destroy the cyber world

On wheels of thunder we ride
Eyes burning bright, weapons shine
Steel versus flesh, man against machine
Itâs the showdown of the century
Give them hell!

Shutdown, their fortress will not hold
Shutdown, destroy the cyber world

Steel versus flesh, man against machine
Itâs the showdown of the century
Give them hell!

Shutdown, a system overload
Shutdown, destroy the cyber world
Shutdown, their fortress will not hold
Shutdown, destroy the cyber world
