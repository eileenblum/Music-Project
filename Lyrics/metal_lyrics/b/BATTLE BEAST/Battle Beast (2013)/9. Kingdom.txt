I've planted my seeds, I've done evil deeds
I'll Sacrifice you for my dream
My future is set, I bear no regret
I'll conquer worlds of gods and men

Kingdom, a castle in the heavens
Kingdom, the one that keeps on shining evermore is mine
Kingdom, to feed my dark desire
Kingdom, a demon world is dawning, raising Hell on Earth

My body's decayed, my mind's gone insane
Oh Crimson Behelit, call them forth
Black Angel, white Hawk, but same is the spirit and soul
Behold the fifth and final God Hand

Kingdom, a castle in the heavens
Kingdom, the one that keeps on shining evermore is mine
Kingdom, to feed my dark desire
Kingdom, a demon world is dawning, raising Hell on Earth

I live my dream, I live my dream
I live my dream, I live my dream, I live my dream
I live my dream

You're chosen the path of vengeance and wrath
You'll never touch me here up high
My future is set, I bear no regret
I'll conquer worlds of gods and men

Kingdom, a castle in the heavens
Kingdom, the one that keeps on shining evermore is mine
Kingdom, to feed my dark desire
Kingdom, a demon world is dawning, raising Hell on Earth

Kingdom, a castle in the heavens
Kingdom, the one that keeps on shining evermore is mine
Kingdom, to feed my dark desire
Kingdom, a demon world is dawning, raising Hell on Earth

I live my, I live my, i live my
Kingdom
