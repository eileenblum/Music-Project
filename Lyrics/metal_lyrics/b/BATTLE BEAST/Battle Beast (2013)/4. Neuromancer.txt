knowledge is burning, computers are learning
The wonders of nature recede
Augmenting bodies with high-tech solutions
Man is a ravenous beast married to the dark

Neuromancer
I am the land of the dead
Neurmancer
I am the land of the...

Life's hanging low as your body and soul,
Wallow in a land of decay
Smother your conscience, the future is bleak
Forbidden is the love that you seek
Welcome to the real world

I am Neuromancer
I am Neuromancer
I am the land of the dead
I am Neuromancer
I'm the land of the dead

Forever Neuromancer, forever, forever
Tell me now what's the answer, n-n-n-Neuromancer
Come to the Neuromancer, come to me, come to me
Tell me now all the answers,
Neuromancer, Romancer

I am the land of the dead
Neuromancer
I am the land of the dead
Neuromancer
I am the land of the...dead

Forever Neuromancer, forever, forever
Tell me now what's the answer, n-n-n-Neuromancer
Come to the Neuromancer, come to me, come to me
Tell me now all the answers,
Neuromancer, forever, forever

Neuromancer, forever, forever

Neuromancer.
