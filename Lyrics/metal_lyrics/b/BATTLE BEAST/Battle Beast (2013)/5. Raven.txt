Night sky is glowing, city ablaze
Worldwide chaos spreading like a fire
Cybernetic fingers rewiring human brains
Obedient and evil, freedom's calling

Raven, the witness of manking's destruction
Raven!
Raven, blak symbol of death in the sky, wow!

Cutting-edge technology, a tool of self -demise
Braindead cyborg armies terrorize
Virtual reality, Hell or paradise?
Once you're in you can't get out 
freedom's calling

Raven, the witness of manking's destruction,
Raven!
Raven, blak symbol of death in the sky

Some of us scaped to sewers and caves
Living with the rats in nuclear waste
Cybernetic soldiers demolishing our homes
Run or die! Freedom's calling

Raven, the witness of mankind's destruction,
Raven,
Raven, black symbol of death in the sky
Raven,the witness of mankind's destruction,
Raven,
Raven, black symbol of death in the sky

Raven fly! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
