Die hard warrior the undefeated
Born with a heart of a lion - Born to fight
Mma-mma my adversaries shall fall before me
I will not bend I will not break

'Cause I am
Die-hard - No one beats me
'Cause I am
Die-hard Die-hard

Time after time they think they got me
Again and again I keep getting up
My fists are made of steel my heart is made of gold
I will not bend I will not break

'Cause I am
Die-hard - No one beats me
'Cause I am
Die-hard Die-hard

'Cause I am
Die-hard - I'm the best ,no one beats me
'Cause I am
Die-hard Die-hard
