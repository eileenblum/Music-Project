On the eve of destruction 
Ferocious Hell-Demons
Are bound to be pulverized by the Hand

Iron Hand

In the dawn of a new life
Some die being born dead
And the River of Blood flows from the Hand

Iron Hand
Iron Hand

The one who can face death
Must know what true life's like
It's living by the sword of truth
Look out!
There's a man who can change fate
He's called the Black Swordsman
He'll fight 'til the kingdom falls by the Hand

Iron Hand
Iron Hand
Iron Hand
Iron Hand!
