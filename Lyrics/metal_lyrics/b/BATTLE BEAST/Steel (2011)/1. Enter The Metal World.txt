It's not the Sun in the sky
That shines on me when I cry
It's not the one we all can see
The one that lives in me

I'm afraid of never finding her on time
Gonna pray I'll never die
The nightmare has begun

Enter the Metal World of Doom
Into the hands of the machines 
Enter the Metal World of Doom
Beware the killer jaws of steel

It's not the Black Moon that heard my lonely calls
And turned my wish into a curse
Someone I love lies underground 
I hear the voice inside "Build me alive!"

I'm afraid of never finding her on time
Gonna pray I'll never die
The nightmare has begun

Enter the Metal World of Doom
Into the hands of the machines 
Enter the Metal World of Doom
Beware the killer jaws of steel

I see a monster in her eyes
The monster claims I'm her kind
Obsessed with immortality
Fight an unseen enemy 

I'm afraid of never finding her on time
Gonna pray I'll never die
The nightmare has begun

Enter the Metal World of Doom
Into the hands of the machines 
Enter the Metal World of Doom
Beware the killer jaws of steel
