I type this secret code again
And plunge into another realm
Welcome to cyberspace my friend
You have got access everywhere

Yeah! I wanna welcome you to Hell
Reality is just a shell
You live a dark life on the edge
I can exceed all boundaries
And realize my filthy dreams
I will return for more and more

I am a cyber warrior
I'm able to take any form want
Into electric masquerade 
Identity remains untraced

Yeah! I wanna welcome you to Hell
Reality is just a shell
You live a dark life on the edge
I can exceed all boundaries
And realize my filthy dreams
I will return for more and more

I will return 3x
To cyberspace
Cyberspace 3x
