[Bonus Track]Black heart black soul
Bow to the dark lord
Live in the shadows
Let them embrace you

Whenever life gets hard
Stay black

Deep scars drained blood
Can you endure the pain?
Stay in the shadows
Let them embrace you

Whenever life gets hard
Stay black

Watch out! I live in the shadows
Beware of the man in the dark!

Black heart black soul
Bow to the dark lord
Live in the shadows
Let them embrace you

Whenever life gets hard
Stay black

Whenever life feels bad
Whenever life feels damned
Whenever life gets hard
Stay black
