Welcome to the action
Welcome to the pain
Oh, wicked ways
Slitting throats open
Bloody swords and knives
Oh, our way of life

Take us for a ride into the sky
We never leave our brothers dying
Griffith, lead us to the fight!
Facing the most gruesome enemy
On every single battlefield 
We give'em death and take their gold

Extremely skillful 
Extremely strong
Oh, the slayer of a hundred men
Raid leader Guts
Too damn tough
Oh, for anyone to handle

Take us for a ride into the sky
We never leave our brothers dying
Griffith, lead us to the fight!
Facing the most gruesome enemy
On every single battlefield 
We give'em death and take their gold

The sign of the Hawk rises on the hill - They kill!
The heart of the damned - Blood runs down the hill - Victory!

What's going on in your mind
Just the moment before you strike?
What do you feel when you take a life?
Do you ever cry?

Oh, it's time to burn

Take us for a ride into the sky
We never leave our brothers dying
Griffith, lead us to the fight!
Facing the most gruesome enemy
On every single battlefield 
We give'em death and take their gold

The sign of the Hawk rises on the hill - They kill!
The heart of the damned - Blood runs down the hill - Victory!

Victory!
