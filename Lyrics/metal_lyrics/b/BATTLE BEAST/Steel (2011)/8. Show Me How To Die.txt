Black sky
No light
Satan is here tonight
War cries
Men die
The battle starts

My journey has just begun

Show me how to die
Show me how to die
Life is not enough
I need to die

No fear
No lies
A better world awaits
Hell yeah
I'm done
No coming back

My journey has just begun

Show me how to die
Show me how to die
Life is not enough
I need to die

My journey has just begun

Show me how to die
Show me how to die
Life is not enough
I need to die
