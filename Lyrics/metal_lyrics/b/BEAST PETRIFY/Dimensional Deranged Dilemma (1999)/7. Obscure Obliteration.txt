Only numskulls will be easily obsessed by persecution
Rights and left were no more showing directions
Vicissitude can be known so easily, tribulation will always come so freely

Trying to wrest the way, which will forever gonna stay
Ominous necromancy will this obscure obliteration?

Ruthless child obsolate guidance, reasons which say no more neolithic
Primitive future flows to his gate, xenophobic act will surely find its place

Trying to wrest the way, which will forever gonna stay
Ominous necromancy will this obscure obliteration?

As he is enveloped into the dismal fog, resurrecting the dead once foretold
To bring the power of the lord, that was how the story has told
His mind when blank with incantation, a simple mistake would mean damnation
Then it came, the horrifying abomination, send him on his knees to oblivion!!!

Even no words could say, everything has a price to pay!!! Obscure obliteration!!!
