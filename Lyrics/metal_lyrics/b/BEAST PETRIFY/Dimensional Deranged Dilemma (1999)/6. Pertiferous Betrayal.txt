Human trust is deniable by twisted tongue, empty promises can be seen at once
Hoping rewards, burns in anguish, faith in humanity had finally deceased

Words, just more than words that will ever be
Truth, the lies made are like games of insanity
Fools, trusted words made are unexpected from 'em all
Burn, burning hopes will lead you to conspiracy

Fighting for glory! Cooperations not competitions! Fighting for glory!
Ashes to ashes and dusk to dusk
Sign of victory, glory awaits, path to be proud with, honest support that will lead.....

Where does your support lies? Ripping off innocents in need, deranged upon our minds
Burning aggressions to thy extreme, some do love, some do care
Some do share the piece of music rhythm, different thoughts, unadored
Weakness is found in all humanity
Some do share the piece of music rhythm, different thoughts, unadored
Weakness is found in all humanity

Liars, betrayers, misleaders, you shall not see the light of day anymore
Shall all rippers rot and deceased, may our beloved rest in peace (Remains In Harmony)

Fighting for glory! Cooperations not competitions! Fighting for glory!
Ashes to ashes and dusk to dusk
Sign of victory, glory awaits, path to be proud with, honest support than will lead
Leading you to destiny.....
