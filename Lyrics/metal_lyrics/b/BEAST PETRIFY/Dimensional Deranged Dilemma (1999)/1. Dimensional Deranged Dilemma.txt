You are now ridicule. You were contemptible and you have low moral
Why have you become like this? You simply don't even care
Is it because the lust, consolation and persuasion of Satan?

I'm just human, has the instinct and feelings. I've seen the burying of my destructive minds...
Through weapons of creation which brings dark ends.....

Do you think there's million eyes watching you?
Do you think there's million ears hearing what you've gone through?
Wake up from your slumber. Get out of the dark
Before you find yourself sleeping. And our pulse stop breathing.....
Die!

Stressing emotions. World beyond floating above aces high
Life strange. Fading courage prevailing darkness insanity
Choice of living. Choice of dying. Divided they shall fall.....
Blinded guardians. Tearing souls apart from beloved eternity

Divine nations existed. Surrounded by dilemmas
Critical decisions may abolish my world to an end
Either fate or reality. Corrupted minds still infinity
So say hi new future! So say bye my old world!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

What has the world done to me? Are we forced to live this way?
Deranged Dimensional Dilemmas. Hatred. Sufferings. Torture Remains!!!

Living on Earth. Horrifying nightmares. Rotten problems unsolved. Drug abuse is the key
Time is no more game. Man has gone insane. Malicious destructive violence
Deranged Dimensional Dilemma

Derange Dilemma. Dimensionally, Deranged Dilemma
Obscurity is what I see!

Conscience agony. Confessions for martyrdom. Lascivious ladies
Monotonous massive maledictions
The choice is yours with vigorous forces. Obliterate the neolithic world and fate is yours

Derange Dilemma. Dimensionally, Deranged Dilemma
Obscurity is what I see!
