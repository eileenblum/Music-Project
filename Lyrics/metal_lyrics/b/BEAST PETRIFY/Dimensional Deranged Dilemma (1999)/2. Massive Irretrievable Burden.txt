With the look of horror through the eyes of terror. Mistrust synchronizes monstrosity
Searching for salvation. Ferocity of man will it be?
Begging for mercy, ominous persecution might be the cause
Never to conspire nor to annihilate your future, it's just your trust we need!

Nowhere to go, no one's waiting, the cry of destiny
Betrayed, mislead, irretrievable justice, deceived mentality
Shattered dreams, massive depression, conscience agony
Eerie emotions, feeling of insanity, we'll give you your sanctuary

How can we help you if you don't externalize your desire
Obscured future might be the answer, sordidly awaits
Unexonerate expressions expectant for a cure. Unspeakable truth, mindloss just upholds

Nowhere to go, no one's waiting, the cry of destiny
Betrayed, mislead, irretrievable justice, deceived mentality
Shattered dreams, massive depression, conscience agony
Eerie emotions, feeling of insanity, we'll give you your sanctuary

No more fear, no more tears, obliterate your worries, just lead yourself to your sanctuary!
Unprovoke your mind, retrieve your faith, massive irretrievable burden will now desolate!
