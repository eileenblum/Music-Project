Inspirations, limitations, an imbecile way of living has just begun
Vindictive, trepidation, servile obedience to hatred
Vulturous, status, crisis born between two. Heavy criticism by sanctimonious fools
In life you have to be a solivagent. Not to imitate your inspirations
An enthusiast that will never fail. So why imitate? Why be it?

Scrimshanker, the curse for servitute. Skulduggery actions, segregating the two
Scrimshanker, the curse for servitute. Skulduggery actions, segregating the two

Depress, express emotions, repress, express, directions
Thrash your way to threshold. Search the door to threshold

Reaching out, stressful mind, internal bleeding as he acts like a maniac
Ego, accompanied, bullshits born through useless acts
Prevention, precaution, useless as guilty remains. Revenge, thrash, gorever corrupted and deranged
Limited, creation proves your world of useless damnation
Subject, rejection of ability caused by your heart's putrefaction
Legion's vision, liberty found when leaving is my decision
Vengeance, satisfactions I gain when vortex is doomed from my actions

Scrimshanker, the curse for servitute. Skulduggery actions, segregating the two
Scrimshanker, the curse for servitute. Skulduggery actions, segregating the two

Depress, express emotions, repress, express, directions
Thrash your way to threshold. Search the door to threshold
