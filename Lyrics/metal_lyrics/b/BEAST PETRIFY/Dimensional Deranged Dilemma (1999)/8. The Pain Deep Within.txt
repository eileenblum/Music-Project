As the sky turns dark &amp; starts to rain, darkness surrounds my obscured room
Still it doesn't ease my pain, the pain that spells my impending doom!
Who cares about my life? Questions related to answers that doesn't exist
My animosity began to rise, the elder ones are my disease!

Deep within my inner self, as the anger silently builds, must break free from the wrath!
To ease the pain deep within!!! Forbidden listening to brutal noises, forever forlorn shall I be
Banned to implore my dark deep desires, my life is like a calm sea!!!

Morbid thoughts recite inside, suicidal crawls within the brain, within these walls, I must die
To break this invisible chains!!!

"All alone, with no one by my side, forlorn. I'll hold the hanging noose, with Fear. I'll put my head inside, laughter, to the other side I'll choose!"

My tendency fails, always to die, reincarnate truth in holy lies
Deceptive spells condensed me here, choking in me and my death is near
