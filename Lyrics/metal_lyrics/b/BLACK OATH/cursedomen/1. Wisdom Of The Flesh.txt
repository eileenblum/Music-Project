Eternal silence
The seventh curse
Seals are broken
Hear my call
Day without night
Eyes full of fear
Night without day
The end is near
A frozen wind blows
Through my soul
My prayers've been answered
Wisdom of the flesh

...and blood is drawning me
A new dimension of eternal fire
God of chaos finally returns
To show me wisdom of the flesh
