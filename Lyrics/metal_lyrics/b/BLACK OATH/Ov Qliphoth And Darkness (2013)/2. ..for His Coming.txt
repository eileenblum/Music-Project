Darkness stands above us
A dying soul lay within
Let your coming be our plague on earth
Whispers break the quiet
Cries bell a serenade
Let us be unspoken words of you
As a prophet's dream
Soon to be revealed
Be your throne rebuilt and our faith reborn
Moon and stars are hiding
In twisted round we dance
Hear our screaming prayer and give answer
I slept with Devil's daughter
Drank her poisoned tears
Hold her hands in mine from night till dawn
Trembling in ecstasy
Free from lies within
Creed of freedom praised as word of law
And my soul be safe in you
Stay with me
And our time won't never go!
Be your coming engraved in stone
Live in me
As your temple I am born!
