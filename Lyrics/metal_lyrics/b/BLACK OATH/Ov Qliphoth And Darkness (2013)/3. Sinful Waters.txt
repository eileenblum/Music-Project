Unholy mother
Hear your sons
Dying waves in ocean's tomb
Can't you hear them..
Can't you hear their cries?
Baptize them in blood divine
In venomous sea
Please poison me
Take me in your arms
And I won't fade away
Wash me through your holy waves
Breathing fragrance I reborn in time
In sinful waters I'm alive!
In venomous sea
Please poison me
Hold me in your arms again!
Throw myself into your waves
Swimming in poison I adore
In sinful waters!
