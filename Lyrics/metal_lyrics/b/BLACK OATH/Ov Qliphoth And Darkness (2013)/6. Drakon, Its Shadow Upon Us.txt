Staring into the unknown
Paralyzed in fear
These walls are place I don't know
Blood is turning like ice
Its form is more than clear
Already seen that shadow &amp; horns
I won't hide no more
Heaven's a place I don't belong
I won't hide no more
But let me taste the sweetness of hell
Another step into the unknown
Paralyzed in fear
These walls are place I don't know
Lost into my own nightmare
Voice can no more scream
Lips and throat are turned to stone
I won't hide no more
Heaven's a place I don't belong
I won't hide no more
But let me taste the sweetness of hell
So many the secrets I am going to reveal
Leave behind all you've done
And die .. to reborn
My eyes are the mirror
Channeling to desire
Just be my flesh weapon, bringing higher my fire!
