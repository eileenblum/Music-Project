Bring us back in time..
While shapeless form came
With hateful eyes
Longing creatures crying..
Still unsatisfied
Ten are rising from below
To rape what bright as stars
Kabalistic power soon to be denied
Hands of darkness rise
To reap knowledge kept inside
10 are seals to break
And 10 their ancient names
Carrying blood, disgrace while elements
Are melting in fire
Angels beg for mercy but still
There's hunger to satisfy
Where were you when they cried, for
Whom they drown in tears..return
Your soul to sleep again
A new religion.. ov Qliphoth and darkness
Where are you know they died..return
Your soul to rest in pain ..as a new creed
Is about to see light
Sephiroth ..your secret is stolen!
I endured the pain
And crucified myself
But my will was never buried
Steal the elements
And divine knowledge
Left hand path the way I am falling!
