..midnight in silence
We gather as one
Nameless spirit
Unknown beasts
Sons of the night
..oh our precious god
Stand by our side
For those flames are burning
To illuminate our mind and heart
On Valpurga's night
We close our eyes
Reveal your presence near
And touch us with a sign
Knelt before your throne
Which stand so high
We ascend our spirit
Reaching fumes above grey sky
We are coming home
Unholy master spread your wings
Under your shadow, bless us in sin
Your solemn dream our place to be
Remembering your name in every fear
