Servants of death
Yearning for time to come
The plague shall end
Another fire burns
Confess your fault!
Our last rite, your last words
No matter how long you scream
Flame will caress your soul
Another girl at stake .. to burn
Let her fear plague and hate
For her tongue is blessed by fire
..in Devil's mouth 'em all devoured
Knelt in darkness
Laying crying alone
Praying without hope
No sign from above
Smile in sadness
Salvation from below
Can God forgive my sins?
..or just let me burn
Have I to justify my dreams?
For I flew upon his wings..
Have I to pay for I have dreamed!!?
As you throw the stone
I kiss his fire
Hide your hands
As I praise from hell my Messiah
..and now..
Cry another witch
For her burning flesh is scent for God
