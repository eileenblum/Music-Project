Light is slowly fading
And so my heartbeat does
Clouds are hiding sun
I feel your love is close
Let me feel you
..take my hand

If I can't free what's deep inside
How could I know the truth
So dig within my skin, my bride
And blood drops flow to you
..yours is my soul
And I don't have to be
..yours is my spirit
And I don't have to die

Eternally in you
My beloved death
