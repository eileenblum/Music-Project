Wandering in Your Light
I Can't Find My Way
Poisoned Are My Eyes And So My Flesh
I Know MY Path Is There Somewhere
No Forgive For Me...But No regrets!

Am I The Rising Shining Moon
Over The Earth...Above Your Silent Tomb
Lies You Hide Behind Twisted Words
Will Reflect The Truth Inverted For Me

Is The Eye Of Horus Now Revealed
The Revelation I Heard In Silent Ground
A New Magick Aeon To Walk As Path
It's The Mass To Celebrate Your Death!
...
What i Lived 'till now...Was Just A Portrait of The Dead
