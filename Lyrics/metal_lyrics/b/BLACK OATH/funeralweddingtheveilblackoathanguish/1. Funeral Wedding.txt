[performed by Black Oath]- I come with the shadows
To show life beyond life
Enter my realm and feel the Reapers scythe -

I hold my Last Breath
Waiting in dark cold loneliness
I feel your face it's near
One Last step to walk the edge
One last tear before I die
The bells of Requiem start to chime
Now I can clearly hear
Your laughter upon my grave

- Come with me
Walk by my side
for I am eternal
And eternity will be your bride -

My head between your hands
The sands of time have reached the end
I face the night without fear
...And lay my soul to rest
Black Plague, I summon thee
Scent of death upon my flesh
Your Truth will be revealed
As answer to my prayer

- Come with me -
In unholy flames I will be reborn
- Worship me, Love me -
I won't feel pain anymore
- Come with me -
In unholy flames I will be reborn
- Join our funeral wedding -
Engraved in sin

Hear my last prayer, my funeral call
A voice from beyond
My bride wears black as I join her in a funeral wedding.
...In beyond.
