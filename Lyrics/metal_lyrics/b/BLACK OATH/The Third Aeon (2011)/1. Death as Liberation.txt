Hidden voices from the darkFear the coming of the nightThink you've seen before this darkened placeGod and hope belongs to the past...You wonder... Is it your time?Even if your beating heartTonight no sky will cry a tearAs the daylightAround you dies!Do you feel painCraving death's embraceStill feeling pain...Death as liberationSerpent rising from the voidDust of ancient dying pastAs above your time has come belowWill this be your day to dieIts arms will take you to nowhereAnguish belongs to carnal lifeJoin a new dimension...For your body is dustAnd your soul is foreverDo you feel painCraving death's embraceStill feeling pain...Death as liberation
