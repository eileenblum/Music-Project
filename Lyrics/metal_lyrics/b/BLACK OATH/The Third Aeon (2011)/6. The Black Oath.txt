Let the shadows of our lordCover the earthI try to see beyond my blinded eyesWith blood as offering and faithfull prideI fill the cup on the altar of sacrificeEverything so clear now even if the darkLet the light be raped by horns of my beliefThoughts from within devour meI feel I am possessedTorment in my fleshI call thy nameThrough flames and painA glorious night deserves no lightBlessed are my eyes and so my soulTurned off my mindGivin' myself to the black oathIn this temple of ritualDarkness is calling my nameWith your strength I am fearlessLucifer be praised thy name
