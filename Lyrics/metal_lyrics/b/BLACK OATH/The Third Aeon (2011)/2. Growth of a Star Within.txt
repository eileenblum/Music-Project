A whisper in silenceI hear call of the windDemons will rise from withinLike visions in my dreamI've waited this moment in timeWhen heaven falls downAngel's voice can only cryTheir trumphets no more soundLet my soul rise from the abyssCalling it homeGuiding a rebel horde angelsDefending my gold throneCurses are falling from skyA new aeon is bornWill it be healt of mankindA poison for us allLet my soul rise from the abyssGlorious and strongRiding with demons my vengeanceDefending my gold throneA different sun still burns in meThere's a void inside my soulThe growth of a star from withinTheir voice in silenceI still hearDemons are calling from withinThe beast arises devouring all the lightEnlightened by dark baptized in flamesI am the chosen star of menI saw the beast.. Arising! Arising!A different sun still burns in meThere's a void inside my soulThe growth of a star from within
