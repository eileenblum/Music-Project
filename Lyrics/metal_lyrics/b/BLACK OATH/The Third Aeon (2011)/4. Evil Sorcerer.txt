Another eve without moonCreepy eyes staring me tonightThe ancient queen ofDarkest rites is guesting us in her graveGrass is bleeding at her feetShe walks beyond the Eden's edgeRise through the ashes and fireBabalon queen of my nightBurning flames of desireLike a phoenix you brightEvil breeding in her skinNo sudary cover her faceHowling breaks the silenceAs the smell of death in her breathRise through the ashes and fireBabalon queen of my nightBurning flames of desireLike a phoenix you brightMy blood will satisfy herClouds are crying last rainIt seems the night will pray for meBut there's no way to escape from her
