...And again I turn my face towards the skyLeave myself so far behindStare at me but pleaseDon't blame me for your sinsFor I have tried to reach the sky aboveAs an open book nothing left for you to hideI saw your magick in the eyeWelcome homeIn my horcellJoin me now in my horcellWill means lifeNo restriction walks my pathTry to see beyond human eyesAltered state of mindWhere delight will satisfyBoth my flesh and thoughts insideWelcome homeIn my horcellJoin me now in my horcellDo what thou wiltLaw is revealedFrom ashes of old a new aeon's begun
