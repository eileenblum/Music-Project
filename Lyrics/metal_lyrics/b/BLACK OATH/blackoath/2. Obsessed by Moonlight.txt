Living under a SpellAll Senses cast asideIn the Distance I hear the KnellWith Darkness as my BrideEvery Night I leaveThis Temple where I sleepTo prowl the Night for youAnd your Soul to keep I can't believe what the Moonlight does to meAt Night I turn into some otherwordly BeingThe Creatures of the Night sing their Songs to meI just wish I'd wake or die and finally be free Living through this HellThe Darkness wails insideIt's like someone in me dwellsLike a Nightmare's RideI look at my ReflectionThe Mirror shows me LiesEvery Night I'm out for BloodAgain someone dies I can't believe what the Moonlight does to meAt Night I turn into some otherwordly BeingThe Creatures of the Night sing their Songs to meI just wish I'd wake or die and finally be free I will never let you goYou know I'll always be there
