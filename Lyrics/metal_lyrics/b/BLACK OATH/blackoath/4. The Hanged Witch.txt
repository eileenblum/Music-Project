Followed by servantsAn Old Woman walks the landWith a quiet Smile in her faceHer eyes are emptyReady for the ritual ... to be hanged on the highest tree A Cold Fear Reach My BonesNow again her eyes are pointing Me!! Don't want believe what I have seenIt seems a nightmare in realityI hear her voice laughing againShe's the one beyond the dead Now I know my life has met the darkI can't deny what I have seen tonightThere's no reason now to close my eyesI've found what I searched for a life!!
