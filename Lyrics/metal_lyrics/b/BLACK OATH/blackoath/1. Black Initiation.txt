...A call in the nightto join the circle Wind speaks to me about his coming Orgiastic dance of perverted soulsScreams of devotion and orgasmAll Unite for this Black InitiationAll unite to wait our Lord I leave a life full of miseryI join the darkside to set me freeAll Unite for this Black InitiationAll unite to wait our Lord Blasphemic MantraTo reach our real natureAs nocturnal beastsWe rule the night Oh Fallen Angel we Summon TheeIn Glorious Union In victory'cause it's the night of sabbatic pleasureIn this Night We Came as God Drink devil's ChaliceTo feel what no human being shall ever feelThy Will.. our commandOur law Shall be the inversion of All laws
