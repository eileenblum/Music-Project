A wall of silence we beg to question
The transition beyond existence
Intense speculation from above
Infinite extremities, closing in our end hastily
Awaiting imminent destruction
Every last human being will suffer
Where you stand becomes your grave
Long overdue, this is the end of every day
Forever in ruin only to remain
Turn of a page, end of an age
Turn of a page, end of an age
