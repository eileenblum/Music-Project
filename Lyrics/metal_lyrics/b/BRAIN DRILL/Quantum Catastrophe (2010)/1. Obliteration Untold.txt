Thrown into a void of perpetual darkness
Outlasting the ideals of a futile existence
Absent of all technological advancements
The world envelopes into a casket
Unimagined calamity of epic proportions
No turning back now, blistering destruction
Ecliptic darkness begins covering the nations
Unveiling the chaotic transition of global decimation
No escape for the human race, sparing not a single soul
Fated to misfortune in our final days
Seeking no shelter from the constant cosmic rays
No escape for the human race, sparing not a single soul
Fated to misfortune in our final days
Skin begins to melt and tear away
Disfiguring mutation of bubbling decay
Obliteration untold
Abandon hope
Fated to misfortune in our final days
Seeking no shelter from the constant cosmic rays
Abandon all hope
Obliteration untold
