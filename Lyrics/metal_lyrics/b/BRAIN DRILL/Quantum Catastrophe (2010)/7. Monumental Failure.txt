A pandemic disease has been spread.
Leaving our hopes to thoughtless scientists.
Mankind has met its own demise.
Residing in the sudden threat of constant annihilation.
The consequence in greed and ignorance of nations.

Monumental Failure left in disarray,
Witness the end of the human race.

An appalling ordeal of mass destruction.
Countless victims forever infected.

Monumental Failure left in disarray,
Witness the end of the human race.

Falling into our own demise.

Monumental Failure left in disarray,
Witness the end of the human race.

The earth comes to a close.

Global extinction, an existence gone awry.
Screaming in agony, blood shooting from the eyes.

A dormant nightmare come to life.
There is no escape, no end in sight.

Forever mislead, dead and gone.
