Ancient cultures with advanced knowledge
Have foreseen a chaotic transition beyond existence
Astrological premonitions
There will be no steps deploying planetary defense
Imminent end
Heed the prophecy, quantum catastrophe
Heed the prophecy, quantum catastrophe
Celestial pestilence
Devoured by the force of a gravitational rift
Leaving the earth in ruin to solar influence
Mass devastation plagues the fading horizon
Celestial pestilence
Mass devastation plagues the fading horizon
Precession of the equinox
The final alignment
Drowning cosmic rays begin to burn your skin
Peeling flesh away while melting you from within
There will be no compromise
Mankind meets it's own demise
Entering the end of an age
Drowning cosmic rays begin to burn your skin
Peeling flesh away while melting you from within
Heed the prophecy, quantum catastrophe
Heed the prophecy, quantum catastrophe
Every last man slayed in the darkest coming days
Astrological premonitions
Devoured by the force of a gravitational rift
Leaving the earth in ruin to solar influence
Mass devastation plagues the fading horizon
Precession of the equinox
The final alignment
Drowning cosmic rays begin to burn your skin
Peeling flesh away while melting from within
There will be no compromise
Mankind meets it's own demise
Entering the end of an age
Every last man slayed in the darkest days
Every last man slayed in the darkest coming days
Astrological premonitions
Devoured by the force of a gravitational rift
Leaving the earth in ruin to solar influence
Mass devastation plagues the fading horizon
Precession of the equinox
The final alignment
Drowning cosmic rays begin to burn your skin
Peeling flesh away while melting from within
There will be no compromise
Mankind meets it's own demise
Entering the end of an age
Every last man slayed in the darkest days
Every last man slayed in the darkest coming days
Astrological premonitions
Heed the prophecy, quantum catastrophe
Heed the prophecy, quantum catastrophe
Have foreseen a chaotic transition beyond our existence
There will be no steps deploying planetary defence
There will be no compromise
Mankind meets it's own demise
Entering the end of an age
Every last man slayed in the darkest coming days
There will be no compromise
Mankind meets it's own demise
Entering the end of an age
Every last man slayed in the darkest coming days
