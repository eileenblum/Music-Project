Desecrated beyond recognition.
Digressing through the transcendence of our time,
Still barbaric urges run rampant in my mind.
A sickening obsession to witness your last breath.
Bringing your life meaning only in sudden death.

You will be left, beyond bludgeoned.
Your screaming means nothing, smash your skull merciless.
Hope fading with the will to resist.
Gushing blood from every orifice.
Decayed and displayed.
The tale of your tortures shall remain endless.

Suffer agony, eternal anguish.
Beyond bludgeoned, beyond bludgeoned.
Beyond bludgeoned forever slain.

Erasing your existence with excruciating pain.
