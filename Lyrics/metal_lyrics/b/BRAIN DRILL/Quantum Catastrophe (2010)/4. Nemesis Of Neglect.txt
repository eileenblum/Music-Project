Pandemonium
Screams are heard throughout the night
Constant pestilence, no place to hide
Overwhelming calamity shifting into havoc
Ruins will be all that remains
The plague of death returns from the grave
Humanities reached it's end
At the brink if extinction
We have no time left
Nemesis of neglect
Ruins will be all that remains
The plague of death returns from the grave
Humanities reached it's end
At the brink of extinction
We have no time left
Nemesis of neglect
Awakening the dead
Unleashing turmoil
Through the hills and across the plains
Ravaging through the burning remains
They will not spare your blood
Killing off every last man's son
They will not spare your blood
Killing off every last man's son
Devouring all that's left, nemesis of neglect
Devouring all that's left, nemesis of neglect
