There is no place left to cower now.
Run as far as you can.
Zombies ravaging across the land.
No end to their hunger.
They will hunt you.
Guided by the force of hell.
Countless bodies to impale.
Your prayers fall on the deaf ears.
Nothing left the same, living lives now turned to slaves.
An endless feasting now, you are consumed alive. [x2]
A mass extinction, Living lives now turned to slaves.
The feasting calls forth, human lives never the same.
Apocalyptic feasting of the masses, they are enslaved.
Pile bodies lead a trail, they are enslaved.
You are hunted until your death. Now one of them living in death.
