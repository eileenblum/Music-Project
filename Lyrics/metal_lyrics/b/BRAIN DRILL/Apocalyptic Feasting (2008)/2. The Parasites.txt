Trailing the freeways like ants and roaches, headed towards the nest.
The earth is a rotting corpse, hesitate to infest. Parasites, killing the very air we breathe.
Parasites, too much rebirth of disease.
Like a disease on a dying body. Killing the air we breathe. A step away from the prophecy.
Consuming every resource until there's nothing left. Polluting the earth and killing eachother.
We've almost reached certain doom.
Parasites [x8]
