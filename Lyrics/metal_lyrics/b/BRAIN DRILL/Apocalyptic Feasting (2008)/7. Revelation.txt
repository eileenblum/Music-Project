The end is coming soon.
Humanity has reached its doom.
Fire falls from the sky.
The earth erupts into flames.
No escape from the inevitable, end of days.
Planets have aligned.
We have no more time this is the end.
The end of existence, the end of mankind [x2]
Witness the end of existence, we have no more time [x4]
The end of existence, the end of mankind [x4]
