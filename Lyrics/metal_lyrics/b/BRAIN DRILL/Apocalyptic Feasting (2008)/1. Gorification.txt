For that thousands of souls, rest in torment
And the thousand of those yet to fall
How much longer must we persist
Stack their bodies
Masquerade and defecate the innocent, for your own self advancement.
We reside in a land of guiltless fate, Where the blood soaks our hands.
Choking false ideals unto dismemberment. Now's the time to crush your hope inside your skull.
To welcome this sense of digress.
As I tear you from limb to limb [x2]
As I tear you apart to think you could try to escape.
A pile of guts you'll remain [x3]
obliterated by the rules of engagement.
