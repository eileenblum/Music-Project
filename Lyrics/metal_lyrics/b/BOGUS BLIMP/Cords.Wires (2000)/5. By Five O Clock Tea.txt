Citizens of the World!
He was the devil. He was the brain.
He went for world domination again.
But his twisted, wicked mind could get stuck
on matters it did not ought to:
Why does the dungeon of doom
keep the devil in the next room?
The public demands an answer.
Some say potato. Me, for one, say otatop.
Backwards masking may not scare you, but,
down here I am considered to be just too tough.
I put the kettle on. Pick up the telephone:
Give me world domination by five o'clock tea.
I have got a nuclear bomb, and I know how to use it.
Calling long distance from the top of the world.
I am the devil.
