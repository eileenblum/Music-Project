President of the World: Brothers! I have got a mission for you of the 
very most
importance, regarding the survival of the human race! Yes, I know, you just
got back from a mission... But this time it is for real! You are indeed the 
only force between victory or distinction!

[Robot Stooge:] Hey, you! What do you think you are doing!? You can not just
walk in here and steal the secret plans regarding the destruction of planet 
earth!
That is the only copy we have got! ...And what do you think you are doing
with that spacecraft? That is the personal belonging of my evil master.
The evil, evil Mr. Ping!

[Brother 1:] Here is one for being a bad guy! ...And here is one for hurting 
my hand! Let us go, brother!

[Mr. Ping:] Escaped? What do you mean escaped? Got away? What do you mean got
away? Marsian missionaries! What do you mean?! Ah... The marsian 
missionaries!
Revenge! REVENGE!

[Brother 1:] Look, brother: Marsian missionaries. They are funny! Oh... They 
are attacking! Let us get out of here!
[Brother 2:] I can not shake them! I just can not shake them! They are on our tail.
We are done for. We are done for!
[Brother 1:] Oh... Wait a minute. They seem to have trouble with that groovy,
groovy bongo rythm of yours. Go brother, go!

[Singer:] Spaceborn adventurers, brothers of space, saviors of the human race.

[President of the World:] Welcome home, brothers. The planet salutes you!
