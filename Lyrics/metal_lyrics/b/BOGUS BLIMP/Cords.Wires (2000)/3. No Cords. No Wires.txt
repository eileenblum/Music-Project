No-one tells me when to laugh or frown.
Still I can not free myself from the thought:
I am not that unique at all.

I watch me on TV. On-Off. Left, right, mute
You hear nothing. You see nothing. No cords.
No wires. No wonder I can not free myself
from the thought: I am not that unique at all.

I hear nothing. I see nothing.
It is the only complete remote controll.
I watch me.
