Bashed my skull in, making room for God.
Opened a vein.
Opened another vein.
Stiill no room for God.
Realized God is in everything,
though, not inside.
Tried to put myself together,
using wallpaper glue.
No good. Magic Tape. Worse.
God was all over the place.
Dripping. Slipping. Sliding off the walls.
Falling down on the ground with a curse.
Dead.
