Gather your sticks and stones.
It is still life in these old bones.
There is gas on the rusty car.
I have brought my candy jar.
The sweets are red and fresh.
Young flesh.

Candy Mandy. Sugar Daddy.

Get off the streets, kids.
Do not talk to strangers.
Do not recieve anything from strangers
and never, ever get into strange cars.
Call the police.

Sweets and love
