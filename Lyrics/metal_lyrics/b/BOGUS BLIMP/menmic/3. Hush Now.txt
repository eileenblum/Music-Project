Hush now, little spaceboy.
The moon is shining bright.
It is time to say goodnight.

Kurt the super sonic,
three eyed Teddy-creep,
needs his beauty sleep.

Let me tuck you in
and put your helmet on.
The countdown has begun.

Ten-nine-seven-eight.
Five-four-three-two-one.
Six, Oh, never mind.
At the speed of light there is no time.
