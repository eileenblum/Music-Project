Smiling and laughing and having a jolly good time is 
definitly not everything.
Stand by for some important thoughts consering the survival 
of mankind.

I have been a good boy for all of my life,
eating my vegetables.
Yum, yum, yum, yum.
It is time for dessert.
Extra large portion, please
with sugar on top, bottom and both sides.
That is what it is all about.

Yes indeed, I guess everyone, every single one of us want 
to save the world.
Well, no time for that.
So get your creditcards,
children and guns
and head for the giga-store to avoid
the crowd on armageddon.
