What shall be my tower of light, in an endless night ?
What remedy shall appease my blight ?
(And) who shall come to my aid, and who shall stay to fight ?

For the fight that lies on sight
Is won within, within the heart...
No legions, no masses
Nor mob, or a knight
Just a single soul needed
Armed with passion of a love and the vigor of a child

I have not the comfort of indulging in fantasies
And as many reflections collide, clarity seems so dim
I brook no mysticism, and no romantic inwards dream

My fate now dust But shall form my epitaph
My old flesh is dealt with scorn
Yet, in another time, another place

I am reborn

Oh "truth", leave me be!
Vanish, for only one moment
For I am betrothed to thee
And thy art my murderer and umpire
Thou art my nemesis, yet part of me
I truly believe that tomorrow brings destruction
A part of me must die
And another, the soar, the fly
I truly believe, it's time to end the lie
A part of me must die, and another to burm the sky

But the death-sting shall pass over me
A lifeless life will end, without a sigh
No blood of mine shall stain the earth
My cuts are unseen, a red thread entwined between
The earthly and the courts are held up high

Valor thy bark so week...
Valor for you i seek
Oh valor, you have caused me harm
For now you are my only companion under the sun
