And if plunge into the past, you will surely see
What horrifying death awaits for thee
Thousands of tales and speak of pain
Uncounted screams, and tortured limbs
Engulfed by the fire or frozen yet living
Hungry, diseased, or murdered in your linen!
Now think how fortunate you will be
To just wither away and never be
Unveil the curtain of sanity...
