The world's fucked up and we lit the fuse
It's all used up, what you gonna do
There's a devil in the desert, there's a devil on the TV
There's a devil in the mirror and it's fucking with me
Turn the fuck around and you get your fucking face split [x3]
Motherfucker

The worlds will collide
A fire from the sky
The afterlife will await you

The man on the TV is all you need to see
Well freedom is our message but money is the key
Media is a weapon selling fear and deception
Painting propaganda and disbelief
Load another round and cut the fucker down [x3]
Load another fucking round

The worlds will collide
A fire from the sky
The afterlife will await you [x2]

Murder
Shut the fuck up
Murder

Keep the public busy so they'll never see
Keep them so busy that they're full of greed
Never ask a question and never ask why
Ship em to the desert now watch them die
Turn the fuck around and get your fucking head split [x3]
Motherfucker

The worlds will collide
A fire from the sky
The afterlife will await you [x2]
