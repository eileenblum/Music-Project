We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on the afterlife
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on oblivion

Oblivion

We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on the afterlife
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on oblivion

Oblivion

We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on the afterlife
We're all afraid to die
We are living a lie
Bring on the endless night
Bring on oblivion
