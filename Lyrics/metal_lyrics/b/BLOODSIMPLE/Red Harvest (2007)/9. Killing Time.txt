Weapons engaged,
The satellites have their position,
The threat is imminent,
We have proof and probable cause,
Strike and we shall be victorious.

Let the killing begin,
Here's where the killing begins.

Your orders are clear to search and destroy,
Leave nothing alive,
Women and children are collateral damage,
In keeping them nothing can be gained,
To destroy them is no loss at all.

Let the killing begin,
Here's where the killing begins.

No there ain't no hope,
There is no feeling left in this heart of stone,
And so it goes, set to explode,
We are the killing machine set to unload.

We now reserve the right to invade your homes and,
Seize your properties, and search your persons at will...
Meanwhile your ports are a gaping hole,
The casualties will be enormous.

Let the killing begin,
Here's where the killing begins.

No there ain't no hope,
There is no feeling left in this heart of stone,
And so it goes, set to explode,
We are the killing machine set to unload.

Now that you're surrounded,
And cut off from all support,
The nemesis rises as the targets acquired,
And you look upon the sky and pray,
To the gods above...
To the gods above...

No there ain't no hope,
There is no feeling left in this heart of stone,
And so it goes, set to explode,
We are the killing machine set to unload.
