The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived and he...
He paid a visit to his brother and then he...
He walked on down the hall, yeah
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
Father? Yes son? I want to kill you
He said what?
And mother? I want to...

I want to fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
It's coming back to you
So what you got

The other night I was out riding in a friend's car
And out there on the side of the road
There was this snake
This snake had eyes of fire and fangs from another world
But he was selling something
He was selling devotion
He was selling dreams, he was selling lifestyles
And I said sure man what you got
I'm interested in anything that's gonna get me off
And the snake just stood there and smiled with the spit in his eye and cried

Fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
It's coming back to you
So what you got

He was selling dreams and he was selling lies
I met the prisoner of my own device
He was selling love, he was selling bliss
He sold me anything, I could not resist
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me
Ride with me

I had the freedom to live how I wanted
To take what I wanted to take
From anyone at any time
Forever in heartache
As the snake just stood there and smiled
At my demise
I wasn't scared

So fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
So fuck you
For what you put me through
So what you got
