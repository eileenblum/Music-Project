Retribution is a pleasure,
We won't beat your fucking hate,
I've been looking around,
Some people can't be found,
It seem they are locked in a solitude,
It's hard to get by,
All the head full of doubt,
To take possible positive attitude,

Heart scarred...On the top,
All clawed...is life

It's a fight to the top of the system son,
So suck it up and be a man,
Before your vision is dead,

Retribution is a pleasure,
we won't beat your fucking hate,
All though the faces may change,
The song remains the same,
Is how you deal with the gratitude,
Always get kicks in the blood when begin,
And I will show all you folks how it is to lose,

Heart scarred...On the top,
All clawed...is life

It's a fight to the top of the system son,
So suck it up and be a man,
Before your vision is dead,

No... It's gone...
No... [4x]
I'm feeling right,
I'm feeling fine,
I know I'm the motherfucking suicide [2x]
Suck it up [4x]

One, two, one, two, three, four
