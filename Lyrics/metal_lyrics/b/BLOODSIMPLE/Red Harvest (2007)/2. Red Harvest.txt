How many people can I hate in my mind
With an intention of murder
Have the people fear me
The people bleeding

Once they're conditioned, it's easy to provoke aggression
This premonition is evil

Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins
Killing begets more killings
The blood lust begins

What kind of visions can I build in my mind
To harvest the hearts of the people
To create the fever you need a reason

Once they're conditioned, it's easy to provoke aggression
This premonition is evil

Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins
Killing begets more killing
The blood lust begins

It makes me feel alive in my eyes
It makes all the pain subside

Just out after sunset
I take a walk down the streets
Ya know, try to clear the head
And I feel like I gotta put my fist upon the wall
Feel the cold concrete as it tears apart my knuckles

Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel I'm breaking down now [x4]

Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel I'm breaking down

Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel...

Take it, feel it, you freak
I feel I'm fucking up

Take it, feel it, you freak
I can't get out

Take it, feel it
