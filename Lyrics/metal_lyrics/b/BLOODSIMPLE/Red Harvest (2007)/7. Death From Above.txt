Desperate Cries In The Hour Of Vengeance
Merciless The Way Of The World
Traumatized By The Hours Of Chaos
No Place You Can Run
Seal Your Fate
A Relentless Attack
Rising Of A Foreign Flag
Revenge Doesn't Matter On Who
As Long As It's One Of Them

Submission,Relentless
Obliterated From The Past
Fire, Destruction Now There's No Turning Back
Show 'em No Love
The Bastard Is Ripe And Fit For The Bleeding
Death From Above, Death From Above
The Bastard Is Ripe For The Bleeding

Crucified, The Profit Is Vanquished
Killing Of The Newborn King
Justified By Those Who Compel
Us Servants Of A Different Fate
Certain Death Signs Of A Hysteria
Confusion On The Way To The Way To The Gates
Terror Among The Ranks
Now You Will Be Laid To Waste

Submission,Relentless
Obliterated From The Past
Fire, Destruction Now There's No Turning Back
Show 'em No Love
The Bastard Is Ripe And Fit For The Bleeding
Death From Above, Death From Above
The Bastard Is Ripe For The Bleeding

He Who Shall Arise
Like A Phoenix From The Flame
Demon Shall Arise
Lay Your Soul To Waste

Show 'em No Love
The Bastard Is Ripe And Fit For The Bleeding
Death From Above, Death From Above
The Bastard Is Ripe And Fit For The Bleeding
