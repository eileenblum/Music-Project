Burn it down
It's a production of fear
Take another look isn't it clear
It's all so sadistic, annihilistic, it's so fucking vicious
It's getting harder to feel for all the people I kill
No time to cry for those who died
They stay unjustified

Through these eyes I see the catastrophe lying in my wake
Voices inside my mind shiver my spine
I am not ashamed

Look at me I'm a dead man walking
Put another nail in the coffin
On the hill I see the bodies burning
Burn it down

Looking back at the fields, all the blood that I've spilt
There's no emotion, just destruction of another person
Look at the blood on my hands
I feel no pain in my heart
Take a paxil, take a xanax
It won't erase the memories

Through these eyes I have seen such misery
I am not afraid
And if I should die tonight that would be just fine
Lay me in my grave

Look at me I'm a dead man walking
Put another nail in the coffin
On a hill I see the bodies burning
Burn it down [x4]

False evidence appearing real
So superficial, so superficial [x2]
So superficial, so superficial
