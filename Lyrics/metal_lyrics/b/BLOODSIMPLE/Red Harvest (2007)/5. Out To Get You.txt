She's like the young white rabbit with bloodshot eyes
Dreaming of another place inside it's mind
Well it's a lonely place that houses the suffering and feeds the pain
So what would you do for fifteen minutes of fame
Out on your own

Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin [x2]

She's been chasing dragons for endless nights
So afraid to live and yet afraid to die
Well it's a lonely place that houses the suffering and feeds the pain
So what would you do for fifteen minutes of fame
Out on your own

Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin [x2]

Another night
Just another night

Some friends are out to get you
Some out to do you harm
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of sin [x5]
