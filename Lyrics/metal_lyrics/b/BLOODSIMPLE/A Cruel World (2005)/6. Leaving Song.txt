Sit there all in all
Waiting on the phone
Push my body to the floor still you never call
She's still with me kiss still kills me
Can't feel guilty it's just a memory

All the things you put me through
The hopeless nights I tried to make it right for you
Show me how it's to lose and who the hell are you
To drag me down with you?

Flowers that I bought are now dead and gone
Love that was before is gone evermore
All my hurting, all my yearning, all that burning
Can't you see that it's me? My beautiful...

All the things you put me through
All the hopeless nights I tried to make it right for you
Show me how it is to lose and who the hell are you
To drag me down with you

Every time I looked in your eyes
Crucified again
Every time you sold me your lies
It was justified in the end
Just like some face lost on a runaway train
Pass me bye and wave goodbye

All the things you put me through
All the hopeless nights I tried to make it right for you
Show me how it is to lose and who the hell are you
To drag me down with you
