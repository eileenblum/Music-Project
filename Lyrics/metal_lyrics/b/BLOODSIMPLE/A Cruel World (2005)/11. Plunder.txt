Discontent slowly drifting far away
Low feeling no healing a heart of stone
And as I plunder
As I fall astray
And if I should wander
Could you help me find my way
Intercept lonely tears along the way
No passage here after, you're on your own
And as I plunder
As I fall astray
And if I should wander
Could you help me find my way
