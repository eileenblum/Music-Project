(Sometimes I wish I could just sew up my eyes so I don't have to witness and realize the monster that has become of me)
There's something wrong with a fatal attraction
For every action there's an opposite reaction
It's like a trip to the brain, trip to the brain
That drives me fucking, ah fucking insane, fucking insane, fucking insane!

(It's a....)

STRAIGHT HATE!
(You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you)
STRAIGHT HATE!
(You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you)

(To me there is nothing but a diluted state of reality cause hell has fucking frozen over for me)
And from my knees I beg and plead for salvation
I'll kick and scream with broken teeth until damnation
It's like a trip to the brain, trip to the brain
That drives me fucking, ah fucking insane, fucking insane, fucking insane!

(It's a....)

STRAIGHT HATE!
(You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you)
STRAIGHT HATE!
(You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you)

Come revolution, I'm down for the kill
Fingers on trigger to be used at will
Pledge your allegiance and die for the cause, the cause
We rise red, white, and blessed blue

STRAIGHT HATE!
(You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you)
STRAIGHT HATE!
(You're just a pawn in the game so fuck you)

There's something wrong with a fatal attraction
For every action there's an opposite reaction
It's like a trip to the brain, trip to the brain
That drives me fucking, ah fucking insane, fucking insane, fucking insane!

Pledge allegiance!
You better go!
Walk away, you never had a chance anyway
Walk away, you never had a fucking chance anyway
