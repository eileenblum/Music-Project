Leave your mark etched in time
You be yours and I'll be mine on separate sides
You know I've been lost in so much fuckin' sadness
My life kills me

Won't you give me a reason a path to prevail
Injustice, this treason this rape of all that I believe in
It's dragging me down

To split the lip and leave a scar
Do you in and do you wrong it won't be hard
You know I've been lost in so much fuckin' sadness
My life kills me

Won't you give me a reason a path to prevail
Injustice, this treason this rape of all that I believe in
It's dragging me down

You can't count the times I've been worked over
You're full of shit, I vow now to return
I've been your God

Won't you give me a reason a path to prevail
Injustice, this treason this rape of all that I believe in
It's dragging me down
