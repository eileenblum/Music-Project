I'm a little insane, I'm a little deranged
I got this stake stick in my heart
Eyes filled up with rage, haven't slept in 10 days
But it's the fuel I need and I shall rise above

Blood in blood out
Don't you ever fuckin' let me down

Now you're back in the game
Can't keep up the pace
This race was mine from the start
Fuck life in the cage, break all the chains
The fuel I need and I shall rise above

Blood in blood out
Don't you ever fuckin' let me down

Lie for the money, die for the money
Cry 'cause you're all underpaid
Lie for the pussy and die by the pussy
Cry in a world of pain
And you, that fuckin' fashion queen
Fuck the fashion, fuck the city and that dream

Blood in blood out
Don't you ever fuckin' let me down
