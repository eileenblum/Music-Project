5 A.M., laying still, lonely
Yeah head over heels falling
What's out tonight calling to nothing

Can't seem to rest with a fuckin' pain in my chest
There's no sense in running from nothing

Can't seem to shake myself awake longing
So I call out your name somebody to save me
But there's nobody there 'cause nobody cares
No one cares

Can't seem to rest with a fuckin' pain in my chest
There's no sense in running from nothing

It's all in my head
Everything is done, everything is gone

Can't seem to rest with a fuckin' pain in my chest
There's no sense in running from nothing
