Enslaved in the name of democracy (disguise)
The age of distrust and hypocrisy (that tries)
Unemployed living in poverty (to divide us)
It makes me sick to witness
It's kill or be killed in the street (danger)
Obscene and rank with defeat (murder)
Hold true to what you believe (of the savior)
Beloved Jesus of Christ

We're gonna be extinct so let's prey

Image of death and atrocity
Unconscious unrest and anxiety
End of peace, end of love and unity
Deliver us from evil
It's kill or be killed in the street (danger)
Obscene and rank with defeat (murder)
Hold true to what you believe (of the savior)
But the fear...

We need some revolution
We need assassination
Bring on some Armageddon
Rape it, hate it, love it...

We're gonna be extinct so let's prey

Here we are, lost in the, lost in the world
A crazy place of consequence
Lost in a wilderness of heroes of another day

We're gonna be extinct so let's prey

Let all your rivers run and take me with the flood
