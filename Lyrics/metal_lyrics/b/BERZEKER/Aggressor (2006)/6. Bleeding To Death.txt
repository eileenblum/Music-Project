I see your eyes and they reflect fear,
Your soulâs consumed by your guilt.
I have the power to change your path,
So be aware of your acts.

Darkness consumes my inner peace
As I rot there beneath you.
I swear my skin is inside out
As I rot here alone
I need your love to set me free.
Why canât we be? Why canât we be?
I was born in love with thee.

Who is keeping us from being together?
Well he will be damned and he will pay,
You will lay with me today.

Try, you will never defeat,
Seek a lie,
Your searching will never come to an end.
The tide is changing now.
 Arise, arise yes Iâll arise and you wont deny

Now is the time, this is the time to taste my blood to live free my love
This is the time to taste my blood to live free once more
