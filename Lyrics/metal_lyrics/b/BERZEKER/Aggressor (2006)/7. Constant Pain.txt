Unknowing dreams grew bed with undescriptible passion
Illusions starved behind lies and crying souls
Can I find a way to let them fly away?
This eternal war keeps me going through this dead way

Keep me safe until this beast is gone
Iâm scared, frightened, but not alone
Weâll join ourselves in hell
Forever alone with no, with no safety home

Growing pain behind corruption
Your soul consumes everyday without control
Walking through a tunnel that never ends
This could be hell, death, or simply nothing but a dream
Can I find a way to let them fly away?
This eternal war keeps me going through this dead way

Keep me safe until this beast is gone
Iâm scared, frightened, but not alone
Weâll join ourselves in hell
Forever alone with no, with no safety home

Living is a constant pain
This is not a lordâs place
Hell will be our home
Until the time goes through
Until the time goes through!!!

My mind is blinded by lies
And abstracting words of pain
This is your end to come
Your mind blinds your lies
Another way to fly
And seek nothing but lies

Keep me safe until this beast is gone
Iâm scared, frightened, but not alone
Weâll join ourselves in hell
Forever alone with no, with no safety home

But finding a short-cut
Seems to be the only way
But giving my life now
Seems to be unsafe
