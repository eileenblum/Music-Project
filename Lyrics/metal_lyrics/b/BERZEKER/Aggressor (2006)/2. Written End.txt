Only if I see you it would be your end
Hate is everyday overwhelming me
Look at that dark sky
At this grey night
Only if I see you it would be your end
Hate is everyday overwhelming me
Look at that dark sky
Today will be your end, watch my hate, youâre gone!!!

Cry, cry, cry!!! Youâll better
Fears will be a part of you
Now and for life in eternity

/Coming each day closer to my revenge
Youâll die without pride, with any more lies
Come on, walk to your written end, hell is waitingâ¦
And now Iâll take you there!!!/

Cry, cry, cry!!! Youâll better
Fears will be a part of you
Now and for life in eternity
