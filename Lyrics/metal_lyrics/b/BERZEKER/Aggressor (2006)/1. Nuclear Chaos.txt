Big wars start sicking me
Life seems to have no sense now
Killing for power is always the way toâ¦

â¦bring the dark sky to finish the day!!!

Now itâs a little wobbly here and there
Heal me now; Iâm ill, here in this cell

Frightening dreams fear me today
Frightening dreams fade out this day!!!

Agony grows everyday with no solution
Facing me now with revolution
Waiting forever a final revenge
Spelling at never, tormentors that fell

â¦bring the dark sky to finish the day

Expatriation of people
Of several environment
An exposition of dead bodies
Is life now in extinguish

Frightening dreams fade out this day
Fearing out this way!!!

Wide open eyes waiting for the battle
In taverns of fucking loneliness inside of us
Killing each other because canât forget the past
And deadly feelings get rid of this corps
And deadly feelings get rid of!!!
Get rid of this corpse!!!

Thrashing everything on our side
With gargoyles telling us what to do
Picayune creatures own this chaos
Incarnated devil, incarnate the end!!!
