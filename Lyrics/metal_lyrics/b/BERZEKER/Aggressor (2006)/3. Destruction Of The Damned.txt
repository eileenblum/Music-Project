â¦I came from heaven toâ¦ kill!!!

I came from heaven to finish you up
This is your end, die!!!

Hornet, my son, donât let me fail
I know you wonât cause I need to forgive you
To give me thirst for more

I can feel now, I feel my skin is burning.
As I rot through hell,
I know my wings will keep on moving.
And you fear my name,
So be aware you filthy maggots
And get ready for your death!!!

Run, youâll better run!!!
Run!!!

Run, youâll better run!!!
Run!!! And die!!! Run!!!
