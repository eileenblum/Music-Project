Letâs go!!!
All they come to see you
Come to see you die
Come to see you
Just sick minds!!!

Lies they hide,
 Beneath your face a dying heart.
Your soul is lost,
Forever lost.
 I will dig and bury you
Lies they hide,
 Beneath your face a dying heart.
Your soul is lost,
Forever lost.
 I will dig and bury you!!!

/Your mind is dead,
Youâre consumed by society
And forgotten by all,
Your brain burns in your hell!!!/

Gone with fears
You are hunted by your fears,
You are dying and no tears.
You are not what you used to be.
You are not what you used to be.
Just die!!!

/Your mind is dead,
Youâre consumed by society
And forgotten by all
Your brain burns in your hell!!!/

/Your mind is dead,
Youâre consumed by society,
And forgotten by all,
Your brain burns in your hell!!!/
