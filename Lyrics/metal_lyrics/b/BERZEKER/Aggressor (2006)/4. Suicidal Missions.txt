Frightened they sent me to war
With less than a reason to fight for
Only two opinions killing for power
Absolute control is this cause
Absolute control is this cause!!!

Suicidal missions,
Nightmares and visions
Suicidal missions,
Oh fucking suicide!!!

Feels like Iâm walking to an electric chair
Fading is out of control
Cause Iâm only a man
Killing is not for them
Theyâre people just to blame
Blame!!!

But only one thing I tell you
Thereâs no holy temple
So become men now!!!

Suicidal missions,
Nightmares and visions
Suicidal missions,
Oh fucking suicide!!!
