Torn into pieces
Dead again now
Wanting you to die
For you I breathe

But now Iâll just fadeâ¦ in your head
I donât exist so why should you care? No!!!
I know thereâs no way out cause Iâm dead
And thatâs the way that things should beâ¦
No!!!

But now Iâll just fadeâ¦ in your head
I donât exist so why should you care? No!!!
I know thereâs no way out cause Iâm dead
And thatâs the way that things should beâ¦
No!!!

Waiting to escape this damn nightmare
I wish I could wake up
But it keeps grabbing my will to stay
I guess this is just a wayâ¦ but no!!!

/Cause now Iâll just fadeâ¦ in your head
I donât exist so why should you care? No!!!
I know thereâs no way out cause Iâm dead
And thatâs the way that things should be/
