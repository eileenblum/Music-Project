Each rock in my way means spears and battles over me
 witch hammers wizards and trolls they arenât a threat to me
Brave soldiers taking my soul but this just can not be.
Cause my soul was born in love with thee.

The true reason of this battle,
Is to conquer your heart
With my hate!!!

Now that Iâve lost my battle
Iâm a warrior with courage
But without a land to protect
Forest of fears and confusion
They just kill.
Kill!!!
Kill!!!

Only my cape
Covers this face,
With no physical form,
Now that the fear and loneliness consumes!!!

Now that Iâve lost my battle
Iâm a warrior with courage
But without a land to protect
Forest of fears and confusion
They just kill.
Kill!!!
Kill!!!

Only my cape
Covers this face,
With no physical form,
Now that the fear and loneliness consumes!!!

â¦I hope my heart forgive me for ripping yours out.
â¦I hope he forgives me for ripping yours out
â¦I hope he forgives me for ripping yours out!!!

â¦I will forever be the metal warrior!!!
â¦I will forever be the metal warrior!!!
â¦I will forever be the metal warrior!!!
â¦I will forever be the metal warrior!!!
War!!! (8 times)
