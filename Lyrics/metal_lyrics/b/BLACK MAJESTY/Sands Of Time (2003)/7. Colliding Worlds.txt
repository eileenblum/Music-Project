The life you led had you in chains
Losing the touch
There's no controlling your mind
Forever grieving in your heart
The mysteries you hide contribute in losing the battle

[Bridge]
I see, clearer when you're drowning in your words
Forced to, betray, you're delusional in thought

[Chorus]
I see the light
To guide my way through the darker shadow
Why can't you try?
Give me strength to live
in colliding worlds

Reciting all the answers
Avoided the trust
Your negative views are revealing
Falling emotions now unfold
You're fading through lies
Entwined are you now
by the web that you're weaving

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

This fatalistic dream has gone
Vanished away
This image that you once created
Inspired by new beginnings
Moving through life on wings that are giving me freedom

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
