The lady is waiting
She sits and she stares
She'll only wake when she's called by my command
Her hands are of mercy
Her heart's filled with pride
Even in sleep she protects the path that I choose

[Chorus]
Guide me with your visions
Lady of the lake
Enchanted is the steel that I hold a gift from you

I will return this gift that you gave
Only to hold it until the need will arise
So lay in your water
Sleep in tranquillity
I thank you again my old friend
We'll meet once again.

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
