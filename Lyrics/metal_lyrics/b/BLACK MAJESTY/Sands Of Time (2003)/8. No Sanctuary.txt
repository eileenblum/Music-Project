I feel the pain blessed is the touch on my face
I can see what you want me to see
This velvet jail has bound me
and now surrounds me
I feel your temptation
awaiting for salvation

[Chorus]
Blaspheming, forgiveness,
You'll find no sanctuary here
Deceptions entwining your realm
Your demons, suspicions, familiar yet they're so estranged
You're haunted by your own regrets

It's drowning me, I can't escape
Enslaved it's too late
Breathe near me
Just enough to catch my breath
You stare in your denial
Why don't you just set me free
I wish for temptation
Still waiting for salvation

[Chorus]

[Solo]

I feel no pain
Your shame will leave
no scars on my face
I have seen nothing that you wanted
Ilusions I've created
that now surround you
You feel my temptation
There will be no salvation

[Chorus]
