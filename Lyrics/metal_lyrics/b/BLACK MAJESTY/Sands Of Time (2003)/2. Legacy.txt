We're all waiting for a sign
Show me a way which is divine
We're following paths where the blind leads the blind
If this world has fallen behind
Do we blame it on mankind?
For all the sins we've left behind
When will we rise again?

[Chorus]
On these sad wings we write this history
to leave behind our legacy
The future holds the key
that opens many doors
The choice is yours
Choose carefully

There's a light that guides our way
Close our eyes and we may say
we're only to blame if this world is in flames
Persevere 'til we can achieve
A harmonious reality
With open eyes what will we see?
Our rise again

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If you follow the path that your visions have seen
They'll be blinding your eyes
And then stealing your dreams
Don't confuse love with hate
You can follow the path
In which your heart believes you'll be sure to receive
all your dreams have foreseen
Now go and make that choice

[Solo]

[Chorus]
