When the wind filled your sails
Sent you out to sea
The remaining memories of home
Left on the shores of your land
If the tears of the dying
You were shedding in vain
Let there be no regrets if this journey awaits you

[Pre chorus]
Would you bleed for the sign?
Take them back to the sea where they belong

[Chorus]
The sands of time lay dormant
They lay there - waiting for you

There are whispering voices
That are guiding your path
Will you choose the one that you know that is right?
Don't let confusion take over
Now as time seems to falter
All your reasons will fade
Is it worth giving your life
in finding the final prize?

[Pre chorus]
Should you bleed for the sign?
Drive them back to the sea where they belong

[Chorus]
See the sands of time they lay dormant
They've been waiting - for you to arrive
The sands of time they have been dormant they're waiting for you

[Pre solo]

You've been shown the right path to follow
Now hide it well
Don't let no one find the way
There's a light in the distance
Gather strength so you'll reach it
Now you run
Run and find the final sign

[Solo]

[Bridge]
Find the sands of time
Send him a sign
There are mystical secrets before you
Will they arise, your visions divine?

[Pre chorus]
You have bled for the sign
Now throw them back to the sea where they belong

[Chorus]
See the sands of time
They have been dormant
They have waited so patiently
Now that you've reached the final prize
What will you do with the sands of time?
