Life has passed us by
as though time was standing still
An endless era like the melting snow
Fifty years have gone by
but not a day will pass
To remind us of the pain
I'm lost in thought and my body is standing still
Now glancing into darkened state of mind
Memories from the inner self
The threads of life that bound me were
severed long ago

[Pre chorus]
In a time when all was chaos and the truth
Would lie the world saw lost corrupted minds

[Chorus]
We are searching for a world of change
Conflicts divide and they unite
Fall of the Reich
When a nation is united and the people are as one
Fall of the Reich

Throughout the ages the stories have been told
Visionary madman who have tried
to rule the world
Manipulate the masses to reform their ways
They'll rebel against the call

[Solo]

[Pre chorus]

[Chorus]
