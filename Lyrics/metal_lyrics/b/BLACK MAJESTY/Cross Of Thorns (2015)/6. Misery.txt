As we have fallen from a dream 
These eyes have opened wide 
And welcome a brand new dawn 
Hearing the truth in cunning lies 
Suspicious alibis 

Can't recognise your misery 
Your weakness is sure 
Filthy and shameless 
Now healed our scars 
And freed our mind 
Darkened days are the ones to forget 
They're all forgotten, got it 

And till this day we're doing fine 
Take care of your lies 
And drawn in sorrow 

Hey misery, are you dead? 
Are you still open legged through your day? 
Letting filth slide inside of you 
So misery did you get 
What you really wanted in the end? 
We're still here 
And you're still a whore 

Let's not forget that little man 
Mystery Orical Rocker 
She had his balls in her hands 
That dirty snake he surely lied 
Had her head buried between his thighs 
His manhood stolen, stolen 
We've recognised your misery 
Your weakness is sure 
Filthy and shameless, shameless 
Now healed our scars 
And freed our mind 
Darkened days are the ones to forget 
They're all forgotten, got it
