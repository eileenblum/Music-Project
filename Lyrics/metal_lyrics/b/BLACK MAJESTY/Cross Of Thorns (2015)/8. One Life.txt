Saw you staying up all night 
Sitting waiting for the light 
That you may never see
Now that your back is to the wall 
In this suffocating fear
There's shadows crawling underneath your skin
Like a river watch it flow 
Time is running out the door 
Now close your eyes just once and forever
You're saying no
Can you really live forever? 
And so it goes 
Can you really live forever? 
Eternal life you cannot choose 
Mortal men is what we are
If you walk in the fire
The fire will burn 
Still you sit and contemplate 
About eternity your fate 
Never realising there's only one 

Letting go may be the hardest thing you'll face 
So make it sure you live your life to the fullest 

One life for everyone 
Yes it was given so enjoy 
One life for everyone 
It's not just you 
One life for everyone 
Who in the hell you think you are? 
It's not just you
