The masterplan unveiled 
To reign its hell on earth 
And bring its terror 
See them on their knees before him 
The darkness will enshroud 
The sinners and the saints 
Bring deliverance 
Suffocating into madness 

At this point of no return 
At a time when light will fade 
There is really no escape 
I feel fear inside me 

In this hellish cavalcade 
At the apocalypse of time 
We've killed God 
And laid law to emptiness ideal 
In this maniacal idea 
We have implicated fear 
We killed faith 
And laid law to emptiness ideal 

We wanted to be Gods 
So on our wings we flew 
Revengeful angels falling on the earth in anger 
Now hear the cry of man 
Repenting all their sins 
From paradise we've fallen 
To become unholy
