They were there on the night
When it all went wrong
Just an innocent soul
Not the devil own
Now she is standing alone
Fear enshrouds her soul
Her possession is beginning to take its toll

Hell is it near?
She can hear the demons talking
Trying to save her from the darkness
Help to free her from this madness

Anneliese no longer dreams
And all she does is scream
Her hellish voices
Eating the soul inside her
Anneliese no longer smiles
And all she does is fear
The demons that enslave her mind
Into this madness

As the evil embraced you
Holly water was hell
And the God that has made you
Was no longer around
Endless the suffering
Agony is in extasy
She must take her life

Anneliese no longer screams
And all she does is dream
Her hellish voices disappearing from inside
Disappearing from inside
Anneliese you'll never scream again
Just dream
