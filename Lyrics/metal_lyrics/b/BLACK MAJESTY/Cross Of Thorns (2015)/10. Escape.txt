Twisted in this cell 
This silence kills
The silence kills the mind 
Darkness has entombed 
I cannot live 
I cannot live in fear 

Most of my life I'm in hell
The other in heaven 
And I don't know why 
Can someone set me free

Escape my life 
How can I ever live 
Without no regrets? 
Escape this time 
I can't live 

Tearing flesh from bone 
Now can you see
Now can you see the man
Fragment memories
Am I insane? 
I've gone and lost my mind
