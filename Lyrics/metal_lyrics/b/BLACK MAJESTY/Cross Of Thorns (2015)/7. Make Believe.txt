Some may wanna watch the world burn 
They're not caring anymore 
Building dreams in castles 
Them they're tearing them all down 
Some may want to catch the rainbow 
They are living fantasies 
Dreaming of an eden 
When they're watching their t v

Welcome back to reality 
Destiny waiting 
Walk through the door

Make me, make me, make believer 
I can't be another dreamer 
Brightly coloured memories if yourself 
Can make believe it 
Make me, make me, make believer 
I can't be another dreamer 
Shimmering stars wish them as they fall 
Now that you are free 
Take this world and make believe 

Some may want to live in darkness 
They have lost the will to fight 
Burning all their bridges 
Now they're living on one side 
Some they surely love their preachers 
They love listening to their words 
Putting them on alters 
While their life is lost in hell

Stars are falling 
Rainbows forming 
Set yourself free in this world 
You can make believe again
