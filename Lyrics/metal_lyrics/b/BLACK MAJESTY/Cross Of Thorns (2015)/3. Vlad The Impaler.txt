Tear down the walls I'm coming in
Your kingdom now has fallen
I'll take no prisioners in this war
The enemy taken to flight
Chase them deep into the night

Kill them seek them down
And disemboweled them
Kill them, burn them to the gorund
Kill them, see their fortress devastated
Kill them, leave no one alive

The enemy is broken
They've fallen one by one
Deny them all of their last right

Impaled so they will guard my walls
Let any who dares come within

Vladimir the impaler
Merciless he was
Vladimir the impaler
Killer of humanity

Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill...
