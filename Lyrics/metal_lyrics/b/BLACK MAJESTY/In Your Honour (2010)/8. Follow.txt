Dressed in her lace
She comes out at night
One more lonely heart
She had to fight
When all she wants
Is out of reach
Lights that shimmer call
Nights young she walks
When there is no pain left to feel
Memories will all fade
What remains is rage

The trials of life are lessons learnt
And that is what you follow
It's taken you from years to tears
Hold on just can't let go
Living on rage
He's on the run
One more life to take
He surely would
When all he wants
Is out of reach
There's no more taking
While walking the mile
