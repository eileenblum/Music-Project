As the light turns into darkness
We are headed for the abyss
No conception to direction
See our world is standing still

In new millenniums we wake to realize
This quest for knowledge
Was it worth it now can it be undone?

Millennium
Set in stone, we're all condemned to wait
Millennium
Set in stone, we were told
To be patient and wait
New millennium

As the age of reason
Declines into an obscurity
It will take a million lifetimes
To achieve what has been seen
