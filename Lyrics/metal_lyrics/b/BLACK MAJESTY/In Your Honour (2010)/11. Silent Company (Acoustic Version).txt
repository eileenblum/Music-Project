[bonus track]

We all try hard to find our faith
But circumstances choose our paths
What awaits us will stand at the end of the road
So we work to buy our time
We watch our children as they strive
Still not understanding what is passing us by

If it's free I want to be like a sail set out to sea
Set a course never returning back to the shores

Our time will come and will surely pass us by
What remains are only memories worth remembering
Silent company observant they rest and they wait
For our life an end to arrive

We're all content and satisfied
Whether there's truth within the lies
There's a purpose for every reason that comes our way
Never noticed to wonder why
Our eyes are open still we're blind
There's a fear in knowing what's on the other side

If it's free I want to be
Just like them I'll ride the breeze
Walk alone and knowing never alone we will be
