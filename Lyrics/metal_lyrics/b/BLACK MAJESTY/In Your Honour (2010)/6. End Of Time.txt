Don't recall my memories
Immerse themselves deep in my soul
I breathe the air that brings me down
Standing firm on this solid ground
My belief is spinning 'round
Learnt behaviour slowly fading out

I tried to make believe
So now I'm going to run

So now I run
Where the spirit takes me further than my will
That's where I rest
Only then to think of circumstances
I run again
Just to free myself from mind and spirit
I'll never stop
Just keep running from now until the end of time

Try to find my sanctuary
This solitude my masquerade
They will regain my final day
Feels like sifting through the sand
The more you move the less you find
This cannot be my final stride in life
