Was it meant to be like this?
Being lost within a dream
Faceless people staring out at sea
Can't remember where it was
Can't recall the final toll
Only visions will be reappearing

Senseless images were meant to disappear
See them drowning slowly
Only to resurface once more

Get me out they call
Am I losing space?
Is it all just images? Pull me back within
I'm not losing face
Am I racing further than insane?

It was not so long ago
Had to learn to let it go
Reoccurring manifestations
Was it voices in my head?
Just before I laid in bed
It's this vision that will reappear

Invading images collide
They were meant to all subside
See them drowning slowly
Only to resurface once more
