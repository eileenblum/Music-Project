[bonus track]

Were they born under the sin
Where the moon and stars collide?
And were torn forever more
Into distant galaxies so far away

They never learnt and should have known
There's no heart without a home
Now they're falling, drifting endlessly

Two hearts that beat as one
You promised them life then gave them games
Now watching the sand fall
Now two hearts will never be joined as one

They were gone without a fight
Not an enemy in sight but their sorrow was with pain
And they knew things wouldn't ever be the same

They should have learnt and have seen
There's no heart without a home
Now they're falling, drifting endlessly

Innocence was not the crime
They were damned and then condemned
An infinity of lies, an eternity of guilt and Novocaine

Who could have seen this tragedy
There's no heart without a home
Now they're falling, drifting endlessly
