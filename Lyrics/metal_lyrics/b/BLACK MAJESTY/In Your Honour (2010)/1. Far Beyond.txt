There is something that resides within us all
Where the calling is getting stronger
And it's testing our will

Journey out
To the unknown
The undiscovered
Open your eyes
And let the magic
Uplift you

To new horizons
Just you
Can see it through

You were born to ride
You were born to fly
Under this sky and far beyond
You were born to ride
You were born to fly
Way far beyond

Let the world know
Your existence is within
Make them feel
Take your presence deep into their soul
Don't back down
Success is counted by persistence
Then you will see that you will shine just you
Shine right through
