When your ships have sailed
They take you where you want to be
Right there
Right there where you belong

It's never going to be the same
Never be the same
All that you hold dear will soon be gone
Letting go is the only way of you learning how to
Say goodbye

Set your dreams for the stars
And to hope a safe return
Spread your wings and learn to fly
For a safe and better life
Let god speed be your guide
And protect you on your way
Wish you well dear old friend
Until the day we meet again
When all else is gone
Keep a hold onto
This key to life
You'll be alright
As it will serve you well

Never gonna make mistakes
Never make mistakes
All that you hold dear will soon be gone
Letting go is the only way of you learning how to
Say goodbye
