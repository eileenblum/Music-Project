I can't remember how I learnt to fly
When the images and words were soaring
That was maybe other stories
Throughout the days and nights went passing by
Sails were full of wind but never moving
Onto new horizons

Now I recall there was a time
Just happened to be free
I'm free to live again

I'll break these chains
Once again
Flying higher to never set my feet on land again
Terra firma nevermore
They'll say to stop but I'll keep going on
Never backing down again
No nothing can hold me down

When you're searching for the emptiness
There's a void that you must fill with sorrow
Just to make you feel less hollow
I can't recall how did you ever fall
And never learn to get
Back on your feet again
You'll never learn to fly
You're a rainbow without sun
There's nowhere you can run
