So here I stand with my back against the wall
My face wears the pain of emotionless
Now that I see it through my sands of time

Help me I'm falling, you cant hear me calling,
I'm wondering where you are?
Hearing the bell toll it's taking my life

The scars I bare are all from you, they are not mine
But still this life I leave behind wasn't all mine

All that i was I may never be again
My inner self was torn it will never be the same
Now that i see it through my sands of time
