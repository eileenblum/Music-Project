[Digipack bonus track]

Another night I'm the unknown
The misconceptions in my head have gone
All I have left is what I fear
Searching for salvation
The tide to come

This mirror won't reflect
The images and words
Another night I'm left alone

In this where the angels lay to rest?
It's the miracle that I await
With the knowledge I have gained
And the life that I have lived
It's the secret of my memories

I'm the prisoner in paradise
Or am I dreaming aface of sorrow?
Remember me for when it's time
Sweet is the silence in my mind
