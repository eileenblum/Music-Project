Time goes by
Turn the page
I've got to move on
Set myself at a better pace
Hours they fly
I am left behind

Say goodbye to old memories
It's a new day now

On new wings we learn to fly
And leave the past for someone else to find
Soaring over to a higher plane
Now that I have earned my wings to fly

Though I've tried
Feels so strange
Took the test of time
I'm in a better place
Years they fly
All is left behind

Say goodbye to old memories
It's a new life now
