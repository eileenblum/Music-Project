Sisters and brothers
Blood spills on their land
A place where they were meant to be born
Fathers and mothers
They'll crucify
Their own sons forever more

Forever turning the war machine's calling
They're asking for something more
See your reflection
Do you recognize it?
You're not the same as you once were

Faces of war
Are they ever going to change?
A call to arms will always bear your name
Masters of war
They're deciding on your fate
Of who's to die
Who will live through another day

Cities and countries
They're devastated, they're burnt down to the ground
Children, stop running
You must endure to unite the world as one

They had seen the worst that war can bring
But what were they fighting for?
May they find a brighter future with a new beginning
