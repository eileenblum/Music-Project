[Digipack bonus track]

On Judgement day
A figure arrives
Dressed like the night
His eyes are a blaze

In amazement he lays in his bed
And he's thinking of time
Now he's wondering where its all gone
And how will it all end
The Kingdom above
Or the kingdom below
where will you end
From your passion of life?

Misguided light
He came dressed in white
Bringer of life
Healer of pain
Forgiver of lies

In amazement he lays in his bed
Wandering names through her head
The silence is broken by crying
A new life's begun
