They were deceived, made to believe
Their eyes were blinded by daylight
If you had seen what I had seen
The fields will be burning
Burning at night
Look at what we've become

You fought the millions
Created empires
And still they say
Put your trust in me

Tell me why
Do legends never cry?
Brave words are here forever
With stories to be told
Can't you see
Your vengeance star is rising
Fighting for the nation
With victory in sight
And evil in your eyes

Now filled with greed this bleeding world
Resistance not going our way
Our leaders scream
We have not failed
And still they say
United as one
We're nowhere to be found
