Here you are
You're beginning from the start
From the descendant you've ascended
Here to forge a land

Now you stand
You have everything in hand
Even though you had it all
You still wanted more

You will hopefully see the light today
Until the sun will probably rise again
Wait for the warmth of the rays
To make you feel that you're alive

Now, tell me now
Just where will you go?
When you're left with this bleeding world
I want to know, where can you go?
All is left is this bleeding world

New horizons
Seems they're far away
When the world is burning
There is still a calling
Always wanting more

Now you see
How it all could have been
With your selfishness
And foolish ways
That brought your own demise
