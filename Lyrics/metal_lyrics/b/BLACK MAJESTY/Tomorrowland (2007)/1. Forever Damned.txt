Why we fear things we can't see?
Why there is fear we can't believe?
Do you feel that you've walked the line?
Can you withstand to be contrived?

Believer, you dreamer
Where's the justice if you can't see us?
Forever searching and seeking for signs
Come dimensions away from your home to the place I reside
Let beyond guide your way to your soul again

You've played the hand now you cannot hide
Bare with the pain 'til it all subsides
Now that you're trying to find the time
This ride you've been on it is over now

All alone at the edge of your world
Can't go on now forever you're damned
Left beyond find a way to your soul
Now that you know forever you're damned
