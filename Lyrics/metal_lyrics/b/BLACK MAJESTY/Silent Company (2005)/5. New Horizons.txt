Softly immersed into this world
Silence broken by screams
Breathe in your first breath
Into damnation
Open your eyes and see the world
What have you seen that I have not seen?
Imagination expands
In the darkness there's madness confusion
That is all I recall

In time you may learn to understand
If you listen you may reach new horizons

So now it begins
Walking a tightrope watch out you may fall
Life's easy it seems
You must learn to stand before you walk
Now walk

Lucid in your thoughts
You begin to fall
Now hiding behind locked doors
Surrounding whispers holding you in fear
With open eyes now you see the world
Now that you've seen what I've always seen
Imagination recedes
Your mind is a desolate wasteland of madness
