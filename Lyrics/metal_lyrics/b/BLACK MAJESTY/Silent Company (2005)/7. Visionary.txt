What would you say to a man if he had a vision
Of making this world a better place?

Gathering thoughts
Have been spoken by millions
Our dominions arrived

Well armed with his words
He has a vision as he tries to change the world

Would you mock him and curse him, hail him and praise
Even though if his words made no sense at all?
The madness you've seen throughout histories turn
Consequently they fall onto all mankind

Gathering thoughts
Have been spoken by millions
Our dominions arrived
Our dominions arrived

Well armed with his words
He has a vision as he tries to change the world
Are these just words that were written by visionary men?
They're only visions of a man
