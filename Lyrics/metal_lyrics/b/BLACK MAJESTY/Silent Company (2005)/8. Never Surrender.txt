All that I hear
Excuses and no reasons
So step aside
And lose yourself within yourself

Lose your mind, lose control
Don't forget don't lose your soul

I feel your pain
When consequences arrive
You're wasting my time
With all your sorrow bullshit

You wasted days, you wasted years
Most of all don't waste your life

Never surrender my belief
That it's you that once said
Your fortune in life is to live in this misery
There is a new dawn just for you
New dimensions there to say
Reality calls
It's time that you stop the fall

I couldn't see all the sorrow
And maybe there's no tomorrow
How will I know?

You tasted life, you took the ride
Now it's the time to take to flight
