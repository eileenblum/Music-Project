Now that the war is over I have returned to find myself
Things that I've said and things that I have done
Come like lead ricocheting off a steel wall

Lost in a dream reality a haunting song sings out a tune of sorrow
Never imagining what we once had lays buried beneath the sand
Buried beneath the land

Firestorm
You left us to fight on this holy land
Now alone
Eternally burnt in my mind is this firestorm

Clouds hanging low the bodies below are your children
They have died for your gain
Scared and confused you've lost what you found now you cry now you cry for mercy

Still in a dream reality a haunting song still rings this tune of sorrow
Never remembering what we once had lays buried beneath the sand
Buried beneath the land

Firestorm
You left us to fight on this holy land
Now alone
Eternally burnt in my mind
Firestorm
You left us to fight on this holy land
Now alone
Eternally burnt in my mind is this firestorm

Reality is not a dream no haunting tune to sing a song of sorrow
Always a memory what we once had
Lays buried beneath my sand
Buried my land
