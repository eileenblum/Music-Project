[European Acoustic Bonus Track]I can't get the sleep while laying in this bed
made of stone, I'm so cold
Look into my past,
this room is very vast
I'm alone, so alone

I need you shine light,
shine light on me,
just to guide me through the darkest time
shine light on me
like a candle in the window
shine light on me
can you shelter me tonight?
and then I'll trust you always shine a light

Will I ever rest still trying my very best
take a whole on my own
the prison never last this future seem so far
I'm so tired and alone

Well I am shine light,
shine light on me
just to guide me through the darkest time
shine light on me
like a candle in the window
shine light on me
can you shelter me tonight?
and then I'll trust you always shine a light

[2x]
Shine light on me
just to guide me through the darkest time
shine light on me
like a candle in the window
shine light on me
can you shelter me tonight?
and then I'll trust you always shine a light
