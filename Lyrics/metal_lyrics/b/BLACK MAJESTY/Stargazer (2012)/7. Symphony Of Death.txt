You will remember me tomorrow
are you forget them yesterday
when all is said, and all is done
this roll is now become as one my melancholy
symphony of death

When our life is glimming
that's when the child belong
there's no chance for us tomorrow
still we look for yesterday
there's no image as tomorrow
only memories, only memories today

There are two images of you staring back on me
when I blinded turn my back tot he fire and hell
so cast this bound to separate me from you drop me down to real lives
you're not as ..
there's no more cheers tomorrow
you're in a world of sorrow
nothing will stand in the way

Oh can you be so shallow,
I don't want to be alone
symphony of..with no regret
..singin this would be the last of me
to make it the rest..
meet me just a..gone in..
that's a distance of separate..
I'm on from being with you

[2x]
There's no more tears tomorrow
you're in the world of sorrow
nothing can stand in the way
How can you be so shallow
I don't want to be alone
symphony of you..with no regrets

How can you be so shallow
I don't want to be so alone
symphony of you..with no regrets
