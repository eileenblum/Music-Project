There are many that have walked on this road before
Lost on their way, there wonât be no return
Still theyâll be searching for more
To find their way out of the dark

I used to wander, with your eyes
Look up to the skies
Still fantasizing, can there be something above earth and beyond
Still the mountains must we climb
Until you reach that shining

[Chorus]
Stargazer, others still ...tears to find
Thereâs a world over, where you choose to be
Far away where your fantasies lie
Star chaser, what will the child become of men
Thereâs a world over, where you choose to be
Far away where your fantasies lie

Iâve been living for now, to try in somehow
Erasing the life that has never been burnt
Hiding inside your mind, letting your wounds never heal

I used to wander, with your eyes
Look up to the skies
Still fantasizing, can there be something above earth and beyond
Still the mountains must we climb
Until you reach that shining

[Chorus]
Stargazer, others still ...tears to find
Thereâs a world over, where you choose to be
Far away where your fantasies lie
Star chaser, what will the child become of men
Thereâs a world over, where you choose to be
Far away where your fantasies lie
Fantasies lie, fantasies lie, fantasies lie

Still the mountains must we climb
Until you reach that shining

[Chorus]
