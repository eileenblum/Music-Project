We're on the way to Mexico
we're..through the night
we..regrets..of light
can fight it for..before that you..the cause
they coming and must be provin
say the evil follow us on the ..
they are following on..

Secret landin ..and said the..to the nation
but there was still so many matters and many..tryin
let the..let you down
when the sacred land of ..
all the ..reason, all the evil preaches

[Chorus:]
Holy killers, the youth of..God's needin
to save the..to the nation
Holy killers don't bring the secret land or the preachers
holy killers

The right of wings of light to be safe
still the wonder of the darkness of a life
should let it go when the loud come into you
should let it go when ..

On the ..of reason
on the evil creatures

[Chorus]
