You're all the ways far eyes can see
Wide awake is the lost... in a dream
Found a way, now you have to stay
Search for you, taste tomorrow!
..all your sorrow
I'm not afraid to look beyond what is real!

[Chorus:]
You just landed on the edge of the world
Never know what truth you'll be taking when things to come
Never rested, cause you're restless, you are young, wild and free
Take a chance while it's your eternal flame!

Try to find the light...
Why don't you take a chance on your reality
Let me show you what... really meant to be
I did get something to follow
Now you finally come to real life!

[Chorus (x2):]
You just landed on the edge of the world
Never know what truth you'll be taking when things to come
Never rested, cause you're restless, you are young, wild and free
Take a chance while it's your eternal flame!
