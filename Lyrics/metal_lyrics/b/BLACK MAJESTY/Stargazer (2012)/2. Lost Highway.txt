I am said high sails to set
Cause I may never come back home again
Wander through the twilight, all has started
For more speaking like well
Whisper winds they call my name
Welcome to your ground lost...
Take me, where the fantasies ignite
Where my eyes are not blind and maybe distorted by light

Take me, far away from monsters yeah
Where the morning sun will shine so brightly
Let it shine on meeee!
It's too late my vision's all faded
My looking glass is shattered
And locked me inside yesterday
There's no time to borrow,
Hopes be draining, hopes be draining once again
Whisper winds they call my name
Welcome to your own last rising

Take me, where the fantasies ignite
Where my eyes are not blind and maybe distorted by light
Take me, far away from monsters yeah
Where the morning sun will shine so brightly
Let it shine on meeee!
Whisper winds they call my name
Welcome to your own last rising

Take me, where the fantasies ignite
Where my eyes are not blind and maybe distorted by light
Take me, far away from monsters yeah
Where the morning sun will shine so brightly
Let it shine on meeee!
