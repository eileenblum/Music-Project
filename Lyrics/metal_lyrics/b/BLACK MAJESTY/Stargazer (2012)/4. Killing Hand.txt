Angels were falling
Out in the shadows
There was mistake with the blood on the sins
Darken and fallen
From deep down below
I was a ...came,
Itâs time to resolve all your lies

[Chorus]
Stand alone and youâll believe it
Can you feel the killing hand?
...donât you hold the killing hand.

Demons are calling, screaming they names
Unholy, unchained by their souls
So rise out the darkness
Run into the light
It was a ...came
Itâs time to resolves all your lies

[Chorus]
Stand alone and youâll believe it
Can you feel the killing hand?
...donât you hold the killing hand.

I hear you call again
...here to take my soul away
...by the killing hand,

[Guitar solo]

It was a ...came
Itâs time to resolves all your lies

[Chorus x2]
Stand alone and youâll believe it
Can you feel the killing hand?
...donât you hold the killing hand.
