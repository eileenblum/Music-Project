Your all can go
you have never seen and never...
I do accept
Beyond the softer mind
to softly infiltrate your world
Now looking back...

[Chorus:]
There's a journey that we'll take,
that explains where we've been wrong
It was written in the Scriptures of your soul
One more journey left to take
All the war is never lost
..a journey to the soul!

So please..
to the darkest...
So close the door,
it's only an illusion
You're... journey of the soul
Not looking back...
Still search the path and live your own life!

[Chorus:]
There's a journey that we'll take,
that explains where we've been wrong
It was written in the Scriptures of your soul
One more journey left to take
All the war is never lost
..a journey to the soul!

Illusion ... all the masters of the dark
That does...the taking of the life.
No looking back, there's no distance...now
You search the..

[Chorus:]
There's a journey that we'll take,
that explains where we've been wrong
It was written in the Scriptures of your soul
One more journey left to take
All the war is never lost
..a journey to the soul!
