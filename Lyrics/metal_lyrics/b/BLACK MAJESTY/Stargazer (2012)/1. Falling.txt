They never speak, never fly in their dreams
Awaken but falling again
They never speak, we can hide reality
Only to reach our fantasy

Canât remember anything
All I see is black and white
But the stains they still remain
The pass of time

[Chorus]
Falling, falling on myself
An angel saves my soul once more
Save me, save me from this ...Iâm seeking
Deep down, deeper, ... pull me out

Then I walk away, leave it all behind
It is my will, it wonât fade away
This is way beyond ...
I can see more black and white
But the stains they still remain
And just the same

[Chorus]
Falling, falling on myself
An angel saves my soul once more
Save me, save me from this ...Iâm seeking
Deep down, deeper, ... pull me out, pull me out

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
