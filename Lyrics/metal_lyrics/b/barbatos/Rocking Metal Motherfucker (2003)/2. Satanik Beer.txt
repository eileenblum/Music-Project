Everyday every night
Waiting the right time to die
Hurting people, hurting me
I'm waiting for the end

Waiting for the taste of blood
Waiting for so long...
I like its colour, like its taste
This fluid belongs to hell!

I like to get myself drunk
I like to feel the pain
I need beer, I need blood!
I sold my soul to Satan!

I below off my mind
I got high for sure
I'm a slave of beer
This is a satanik beer!

Hell! Give me beer!
Hell! Give me the best beer!
Hell! Don't wait so long for the second turn!
Hell! Give me beer!
Hell! Give me the best beer!
Hell! Yours tonight! Make me feel free!
