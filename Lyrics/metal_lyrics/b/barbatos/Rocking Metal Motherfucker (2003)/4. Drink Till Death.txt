Alright this night you gonna die

A thrashing rage
In front the stage
Drunk maniacs curse
We are getting worse

Puke the god old beer
Teach the kids to fear
What the Devil say
You will fucking obey

Mosh your head
And posers dead
Total violent night
Metals fucking might

Drink till death
Smash your head
We want you all
So fucking dead

Cut your studded arms
Denim booze and scars
Beat the fucking bitch
That evil horny witch

Drink more than you can handle
Snort shit like never before
There is no time to waste
When death is at the door

Mosh your head
And posers dead
Total violent night
Metals fucking might
