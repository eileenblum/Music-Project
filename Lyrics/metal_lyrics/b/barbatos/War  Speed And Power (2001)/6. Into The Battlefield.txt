Proceed in the desert
To help a supporter
They are silent like a woman
Suddenly go wild
Storm dances suddenly
I can't imagine in battlefield

Believe me
Survive
Hail victory
For the mother country

What is victory?
Painful
As for the public
This is final battle
We get eternal flame
There is no target
Before us that
