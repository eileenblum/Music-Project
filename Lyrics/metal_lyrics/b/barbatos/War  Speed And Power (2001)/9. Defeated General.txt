We are real warriors
We are samurai
We are Japanese
We will die for rising sun
No more disgrace
Charging in from hell
Blood thirsty soldiers
For victory we charge

Prisoner of war
Brutal atrocity
We believe in death's call
The blood will flow
Deadline to meet
Death destruction
Infernal raging steel
Pungent burning flesh

Let's fight â join us!
Let's fight â into war!
Let's fight â join us!
Let's fight â for the kill
