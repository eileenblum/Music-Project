The sweet smell of this sumptuous
elixir is still around me
I'm mostly dead after drinking
these whole bottles

After two days in this horrible room
The effects are now gone
But I still remember his perfume
The perfume of the poisoned sake!

I cannot more; I'm too weak
The poison is still running in my veins
I want to die the pain is too strong
I want to puke, but I can't

I want to drink more and die
I want to taste the pain in my veins
