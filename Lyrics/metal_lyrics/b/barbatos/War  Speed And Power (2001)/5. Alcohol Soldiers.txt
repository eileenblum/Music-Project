The sky which nothing can see
Full of targets around
As for being believed
One's head and arm
I return by full of wounds
Let's drink beer
Before go to hospital
Bloody pilot

I'm fighting for this alcohol
Beer? Whisky?
It's Japanese sake!
This is the No. 1 alcohol
I'll be a bottle again tomorrow
Can you drink beer again?
Dead or alive
No one knows

Final war
To Hell
