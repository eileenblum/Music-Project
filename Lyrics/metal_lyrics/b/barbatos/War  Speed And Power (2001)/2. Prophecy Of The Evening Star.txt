From hell's heart it is him
Evening star. Lucifer, the light
Bringing strife and division
and a hatred of mankind

Blood vapour a mist upon the land
Tears boil in hellfire...
Prayers to heaven, stopped by a sword
Serpent shadow across the land

Centuries old stories of paradise lost
Rewritten by cloven hoof
A prophecy now reality
Eclipsed â the setting sun

Serpent shadow across the land
A prophecy â the setting sun
A mist across the land...
