[Music &amp; Lyrics by C. KÃ¶tterl]

[Verse 1:]
Turning back is out of hand
With all I dread unleashed
These thoughts are eating me up from within
As my tongue teaching to teach you

[Chorus:]
Could you ever understand me on the inside
Where all the wishes grow
Could you ever understand and have some insight
To where all the fear takes hold

[Verse 2:]
Counting my steps on this burning ground
The way back overgrown with thorns
With the ghost of a chance and shivering hands
I pass the point of no return

[Chorus:]
Could you ever understand me on the inside
Where all the wishes grow
Could you ever understand and have some insight
To where all the fear takes hold

[Leads: Sheep Berger / KÃ¶tterl]

[Chorus:]
Could you ever understand me on the inside
Where all the wishes grow
Could you ever understand and have some insight
To where all the fear takes hold
Behold A Burning Soul
Behold my burning soul
