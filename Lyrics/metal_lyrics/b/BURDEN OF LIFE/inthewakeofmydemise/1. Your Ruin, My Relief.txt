[Music &amp; Lyrics by C. KÃ¶tterl]

[Verse 1:]
Caging myself beyond all reason
Witnessing the madness within
I am prisoner and jail guard
I'm virus and infected
Merging it all I am left a nervous wreck
Losing focus and losing track
Who's still preventing escape I cry
Finally perceiving my tears' reflection

[Pre-chorus 1:]
Shattering the mirror
This impostor made of glass
I realize my foolishness
And how all this could ever last

[Verse 2:]
Trading my love for mercy
My self-respect for surrender
Accepting my emotional suicide
Dead inside I crave for salvation
Crave for this hell to end
All that's left is to let you feel
We're done

[Pre-chorus 2:]
Shattering the mirror
This impostor made of glass
I realize my foolishness
And how all this could ever last

[Chorus:]
Turning my back on you
I return the hell you put me through
Now these days will end
The days you mauled my hand feeding

[Bridge:]
Your Ruin, My Relief!
Your Ruin, My Relief!
Release me now!

[Lead: Sheep Berger]

[Chorus:]
Turning my back on you
I return the hell you put me through
Now these days will end
The days you mauled my hand feeding
