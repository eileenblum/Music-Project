[Music &amp; Lyrics by C. KÃ¶tterl]

[Verse 1:]
Scattered memories on a dusted shelf
Exhibited obviously only
To make sure that your so-called experience of life
Is Displayed for people's envy
This is all your life can offer
For I know these feet never hurt like mine
But it makes me release all the pain from within
A shape where I'm free of fear and sin

[Pre-chorus 1:]
In search for snow fields and oases
And all that's in between

[Verse 2:]
Perambulate all known terra firma
From Ayer's Rock to Cheop's Lair
Wash of the sand in Amazon River
And desiccate in the Valley of Death
All the things I need to be
Can not be grabbed by mortal hands
They are locked so deep within my soul
Never to be taken away from me

[Chorus:]
I follow my heart to take me home
Just to leave again and continue to roam

[Verse 3:]
Time after time I come back to the place
Where once I left and I will leave again
For I will not rest till I know
What made me choose this path
Nothing compares to learn the beauty of it all by yourself

[Chorus:]
I follow my heart to take me home
Just to leave again and continue to roam

[Leads: Sheep Berger / KÃ¶tterl / sheep Berger / KÃ¶tterl]

[Pre-chorus 2:]
Still searching snow fields and oases
And all that's in between

[Chorus:]
I follow my heart to take me home
Just to leave again and continue to roam
