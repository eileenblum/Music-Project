[Music &amp; Lyrics by C. KÃ¶tterl]

[Verse 1:]
Surrounded by pointing fingers
At the futility of my life
I feel so unwelcome
For my demise they strive
Suffering this self-loathing
I start to tie my own noose
The coin gets flipped another time
Heads - you win, tails - I lose

[Verse 2:]
Paranoia is the next step on my way
To a state where all I feel
Are the eyes burning holes into my back
The night of the unspoken rules
I will take my soul and flee
And leave them to feast on my body
I will leave them my heart to devour

[Pre-chorus:]
In The Wake Of My Demise the world rebuilds itself
Wipe me off the surface and the world rebuilds itself

[Chorus:]
Watching the Angels
I remember why
Why can not the stars lead me home
Alone I stray
Towards old Gaia's end
For all my sorrow
Will soon be safe
In her hands

[Bridge:]
Still this is long and winding road
My path will not seem to end
But turning back I want to read face
Nothing but lies!

[Lead: KÃ¶tterl]

[Verse 3:]
Surrounded by pointing fingers
At the futility that I bear
I feel so unwelcome
Why would they even care
Suffering this self-loathing
I just did not want to be used
The coin gets flipped this one last time
Heads - I win, tails - you lose

[Chorus:]
Watching the Angels
I remember why
Why can not the stars lead me home
Alone I stray
Towards old Gaia's end
For all my sorrow
Will soon be safe
In her hands
