[Music &amp; Lyrics by KÃ¶tti]

This decision makes me crawl
Though it makes me yawn for more
As it sends me through a track
Full of traps and ways to die

Ridiculous it seems
For you for the rest not for me
May I ask you one last question
When did you lose your sense for sanity?

Every note
You play to me
Carefully
Cuts my throat

While I try to stand my ground
You sing the Harmony Of Death
It makes me crumble watch me fall
Watch me how I learn to decompose

Every note
You play to me
Carefully
Cuts my throat

[Leads: Haimi/KÃ¶tti/Schafi]

Every note
You play to me
Carefully
Cuts my throat

Every note
You play to me
Carefully
Cuts my throat
