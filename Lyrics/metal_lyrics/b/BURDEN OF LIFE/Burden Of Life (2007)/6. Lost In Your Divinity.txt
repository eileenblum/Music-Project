[Music &amp; Lyrics by Raffi]

The first moment to see you and the glance of your eyes
Is still a memory so clear unforgettable for me
Led by your divinity
This chapter of my life began

It's deeply affected by sorrow and pain
It almost killed me almost extinguished the flame
Which used to be the only sense of my life

[Bridge:]
Good things come to those who wait
It just proves true for me
Now my memories desecrate
Your once so-called divinity

All wounds are healed scars will never rest
For I learned my lesson believe me
Now I know what I detest
What I detest is thee

I can't believe that I once was so blind
To fall for your poisoned affection
But now I see the absolute truth behind
And for now I forget your purgation

Good things come to those who wait
It just proves true for me
Now my memories desecrate
Your once so-called divinity

Ending the tale, closing the book
And covering it with black roses
But then throwing it away, forgetting it at once
Is what my intuition chooses

I can't believe that I once was so blind
To fall for your poisoned affection
But now I see the absolute truth behind
And for now I forget your purgation

[Leads: KÃ¶tti/Schafi]

I can't believe that I once was so blind
To fall for your poisoned affection
But now I see the absolute truth behind
And for now I forget your purgation

As I now arrest my endless hate
I see it's not even worth to call it a tale
My memories forever desecrate
Furthermore forget you
