I'll never get along with you cause you're the one can't stop to scream
I hope you're nothing but a dream so one day I'll get rid of you
But everyday I'm feelin' weaker now I don't sleep the dream is true
Standing rigid stronger one is you I lost the control about it

[Bridge:]
It's like climbing the stairs of insanity

I'm My Own King
I'm My Own King
I rule my life as My Own King
I'm My Own King

Step by step and one by one slowly creeping inside my brain
Ripping out my nerves that's how you control me
But don't think it's that easy I hate your ways disgusting 'n' sleazy
I need to be on my own again leave me the hell alone again

[Bridge:]
I'ts like climbing the stairs of insanity

I'm My Own King
I'm My Own King
I rule my life as My Own King
I'm My Own King

[Lead: KÃ¶tti]

I'm My Own King
I'm My Own King
I rule my life as My Own King
I'm My Own King
