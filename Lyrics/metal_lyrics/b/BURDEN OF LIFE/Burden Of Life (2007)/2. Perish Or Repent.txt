[Music by KÃ¶tti/Haimi &amp; Lyrics by Raffi]

Striving for dejection for the destroying of my life
It seems my old friend's challenge is still to deprive
Myself of my happiness

To keep on being satisfied
When will this all have an end?
I think after I've finally died

[Bridge:]
As I sink into this darkness my sadness gets revealed
I can't see no light at the end of the tunnel that would show me I could be healed

So I carry on dragging myself over this path well-known
I try to get rid of solitariness
But still I stay alone

I think depressions are the thing I'm really living for
When will this all have an end?
I don't care anymore

[Bridge:]
As I sink into this darkness my sadness gets revealed
I can't see no light at the end of the tunnel that would show me I could be healed
I wonder if the day will come when the friend for me will be sent
Perish Or Repent

The old friend comes haunting me again
The old friend's name is love
He will go on till I'm a broken man
My old friend
Perish Or Repent

[Leads: Haimi/KÃ¶tti]

Should I fight or should I give in I can't decide this now
So I live on in this predicament
It has to work somehow

[Bridge:]
As I sink into this darkness my sadness gets revealed
I can't see no light at the end of the tunnel that would show me I could be healed
I wonder if the day will come for me when the friend will be sent
Perish Or Repent

The old friend comes haunting me again
The old friend's name is love
He will go on till I'm a broken man
My old friend
Perish Or Repent
