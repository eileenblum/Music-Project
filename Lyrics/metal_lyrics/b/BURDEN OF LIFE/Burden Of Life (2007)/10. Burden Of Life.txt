[Music and Lyrics by KÃ¶tti]

Come closer welcome to my vault
Still alone I'll keep on crying for a moment
A moment longer than your whole life has lasted yet
Help me please stand up again

Resting here eternally
I finally find my destiny
Left to end in tragedy

Haunted by a nightmare my angel wings turn black
Hidden in the shadow with nothing but a knife
Fly away? impossible with a burden on my back
Tied down to the ground no way to save my life

Left is nothing but one question
Could it be I'm the fallen angel you've been loking for?
Could this be the end of my inner struggle? my infinite war?
In the end I'm wrong again (illusions build my own reality)

In ruins of my man-made hell
I try to get the best out of this nearly buried life
This Burden Of Life

Haunted by a nightmare my angel wings turn black
Hidden in the shadow with nothing but a knife
Fly away? impossible with a burden on my back
Tied down to the ground no way to save my life
