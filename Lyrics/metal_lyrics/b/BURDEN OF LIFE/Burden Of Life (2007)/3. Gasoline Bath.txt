Sometimes when I stand in flames
I jump into a lake of gasoline
To make the fire even reach the sky
And as it burns my skin my flesh and my bones
I accept that there's no water near
To kill the flame and save my life

[Bridge:]
There's no way out ...

[Refrain:]
I have to live with it
And start to get over it
I'm laughing into the fire
It seems ridiculous

The heat gets a bit more comfortable
And my fingers are falling to ashes
I don't have a problem with my situation now
"How could i've ever had?" i wonder

[Bridge:]
There's no way out ...

[Refrain:]
I have to live with it
And start to get over it
I'm laughing into the fire
It seems ridiculous now

[Lead Harmony: Schafi &amp; KÃ¶tti]

[Bridge 2:]
All this pain made me reach bottom
All these flames brought me on my knees
I lost my last piece of self-respect
And everything just because of you

[Lead: KÃ¶tti]

[Outro :]
I have to get back to my old self again
