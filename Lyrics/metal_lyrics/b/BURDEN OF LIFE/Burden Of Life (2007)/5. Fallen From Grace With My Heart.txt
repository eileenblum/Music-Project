[Music by KÃ¶tti/Haimi &amp; Lyrics by Raffi]

Tears are falling
From the ruins
Of my heart
Being burnt to ashes

Hate's deceitfully crawling
Into where grief begins
My dreams torn apart

[Bridge:]
But the worst has still to fess up

Memories unfold my pain
And the abundance of my head
Melancholy seems to stain
And I wonder why we've ever met

As my head wants to claim
And wish that you were dead
My heart wants to feign
That I still can hold what I had

[Bridge:]
But the worst has still to fess up

Memories unfold my pain
And the abundance of my head
Melancholy seems to stain
And I wonder why we've ever met

[Leads: Haimi/KÃ¶tti/Schafi]

Memories unfold my pain
And the abundance of my head
Melancholy seems to stain
And I wonder why we've ever met

Now illusions blind me
Confusions solve myself
Still I cannot see
What my fellings will choose as their shelf
