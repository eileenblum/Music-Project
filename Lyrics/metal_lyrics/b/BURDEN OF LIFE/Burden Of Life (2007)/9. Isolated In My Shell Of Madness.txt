[Music &amp; Lyrics by KÃ¶tti]

I can't stand this anymore
You're in heaven an angel I suffer in hell as a sinner
Isolated and left alone
Believe me here none would feel like a winner

Your hands ... I want to hold'em
Your eyes ... I want to drown inside them
No matter how this all will end
I'll breakout of here

[Bridge 1:]
Out of my shell of madness
Into the void of sadness

I can't go further without you in my arms
Even if I would have to be scourged
With thousands of nails drilling inside my skin
Every second without you is wasted nothing but wasted

Cannot see the shining of fullmoon and sun
Due to millions of tears
But I do feel the pain
Standing alone open wounds inner bleeding

[Bridge 2:]
Out of my shell of madness
Into the void of sadness
Now I am by your side again
You tell it's late too late for us

I can't go further without you in my arms
Even if I would have to be scourged
With thousands of nails drilling inside my skin
Every second without you wasted nothin but wasted

[Bridge 3:]
So I sit here all alone and lose my mind
Isolated In My Shell Of Madness

[Lead: KÃ¶tti]

I can't go further without you in my arms
Even if I would have to be scourged
With thousands of nails drilling inside my skin
Every second without you wasted nothin but wasted
