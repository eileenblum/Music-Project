[Music by Ludwig &amp; Lyrics by Stefanov]

[Verse 1:]
Shouting that I serve you not
I torn you from your sleep
I hold your hand in dismay
Assuaging your desperate sight
We stare at the hills below
Into the azure of tonight
A crimson flash shoots through my eyes
And from within my demon cries

[Chorus:]
My burden is to shelter you
I preach to you to apprehend
That every teardrop on your face
Is not self-evident
Now my fulfillment is Achieved
I seize the day
You have lost all that you believed
My Beloved Sanctuary

[Verse 2:]
You grasp my hand we run away
Black clouds shape in the sky
The filthy blackness of your soul
And the sable in your eyes
Now tell me what you really need
Is it your precious god
Not even he bestows you heed
Open your eyes to see the fraud

[Bridge:]
Run faster run faster
I scream as you cry
Impostor impostor
I shout into the sky

[Chorus:]
My burden is to shelter you
I preach to you to apprehend
That every teardrop on your face
Is not self-evident
Now my fulfillment is Achieved
I seize the day
I remember how you were called
My Beloved Sanctuary

[Leads: Schaferberger &amp; KÃ¶tterl]

[Bridge:]
Run faster run faster
I scream as you cry
Impostor impostor
I shout into the sky
Run faster run faster
I scream as you cry
Impostor impostor
I shout into the sky

[Chorus:]
My burden is to shelter you
I preach to you to apprehend
That every teardrop on your face
Is not self-evident
Now my fulfillment is Achieved
I seize the day
You have lost all that you believed
My Beloved Sanctuary
