[Music &amp; Lyrics by KÃ¶tterl by Stefanov]

[Verse 1:]
Staring on my riven self devoided
I realize I'm still a slave
Louring on this shattered state
I let the sun blind my eyes once again

[Prechorus:]
And I never ask why
Because I already know the answer

[Chorus:]
Before you take one last breath
Another breath of fresh air
You know your strength has left you
Was it really worth the share

[Verse 2:]
But something's missing where's your dignity
I find new chains every time I bleed
They rip my skin defile my flesh
Almost as your feeble embrace
The border is the bone
I'm abandone afforded by the sun's effort to give me warmth
But soon I realize
That light has never shone

[Lead: Haimerl]

[Chorus:]
Before you take one last breath
Another breath of fresh air
You know your strength has left you
Was it really worth the share
Now listen my child no one escapes
Not even well-off maggots like you
We to the same diseases
Now tell me what's your share
