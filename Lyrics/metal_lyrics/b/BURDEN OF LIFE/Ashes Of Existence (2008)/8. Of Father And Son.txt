[Music &amp; Lyrics by KÃ¶tterl]

[Verse 1:]
Look right into my eyes
Watch the blind man lock his soul
It's the silence I despise
Leaving a heart with one more hole
Look right into these eyes
Can you see the king of lies
Shutting up where he should speak
Where's the moment I still seek for

[Prechorus:]
Read my thoughts
And find your own

[Chorus:]
Shall we persist
In remaining silent
Oh father tell me
After all these years of irrelevance
Speak to me

[Verse 2:]
When you descended to what we are
To all the things that we've done wrong
To what we could have done so far
I held your hand as I wished to all along
The moment we broke the ice
Death started freezing it again
These few words just were not enough
To take this everlasting pain away

[Prechorus:]
You red my thoughts
And found your own

[Chorus:]
We did not persist
In remaining silent
Oh how I miss you
After all these years of blindness
You made me see
