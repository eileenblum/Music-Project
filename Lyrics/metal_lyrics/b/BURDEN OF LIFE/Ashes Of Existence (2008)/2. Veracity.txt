[Music by KÃ¶tterl / Haimerl &amp; Lyrics by KÃ¶tterl]

[Verse 1:]
A black box full of heart-shaped pieces of paper
Is all that's left from you
Wretched remains of irreplaceable
Deliberately thrown away

The dead heart inside me scream for resurrection
Revive it one more time
I want my wintersun to shine again

[Chorus:]
New thoughts of failure rising
I kill the old ones every once in a while
I searched for love and security
But in the end I soon lost it all
Everything ...
Left alone to cry in hate and pain

[Verse 2:]
Deep inside me this selfishness kept breeding
For far too long
But still it's just not fear
To hear myself scream, "No one else!"

Now I wrapped this shell around me
But I still want to mourn for
More than a year of everything I needed
How can this year already be gone

[Bridge:]
Even meeting my dead end
There is nothing I repent
I must accept my sun has now set
But still there's nothing I regret
Apart from th end
I'm dying now

[Chorus:]
These thoughts of failure raising
I can not preventable myself from bleeding again
This search for love and security
Will finally end in pain and misery
Everything is lost
Left to die alone in hate and pain

[Lead: KÃ¶tterl]
