[Music &amp; Lyrics by KÃ¶tterl by Stefanov]

[Verse 1:]
Though nothing's changing
We still search for something to harness
Into the deepest cavern
Our dead bird's songs never rest

[Chorus:]
The Fire That Still Burns Grey In Our Eyes
Ashes from the pyre
Imprisoned but who denies

[Lead: Sheep Berger]

[Verse 2:]
As we were solemn
Our incubator nurished our content
Now lying broken
Woefully we pay the eternal debt

[Chorus:]
The Fire That Still Burns Grey In Our Eyes
Ashes from the pyre
Imprisoned but who denies

[Bridge:]
And we were dancing ...
Oh you flames you dark ones in my hell
I open wide ...
And pour the bitter ness of life within

[Chorus:]
The Fire That Still Burns Grey In Our Eyes
Ashes from the pyre
Imprisoned but who denies
The Fire That Still Burns Grey In Our Eyes
