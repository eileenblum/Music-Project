[Music &amp; Lyrics by KÃ¶tterl]

- January 1942 -
Today I found my dearest friend ... dead
The face of an aged and tired you
While I covered his stomach still warm
With my frozen fingers
I finally and absolutely Realised
That this raging war is nothing but insanity
I write these words with tears in my eyes
As for now I know
They could be the last I leave to this world cursed
We failed to see through the web of lies
We failed to understand that there is nothing glorious about war
And now we have to pay ...

[Verse 1:]
Back then when things all fell into place
We got intoxicated by that's shady embrace
For the welfare of our rich
We took victory for granted
Just as we were told
Years went by and by now we are in doubt
In doubt of our charge across the lands
The dying we can not be of avail witt Possessed
For anyone

[Prechorus:]
The clock of war will prove
That hope is in vain but
Obliterated youth
How shall we bear up all the pain

[Chorus:]
We've marched on as the ones who still believed
Before our minds perceived
The downfall's closing in on us and
One by one the sun will set down on us
Our memories to dust
Our Farewell though'll be sung forevermore

[Verse 2:]
This war is a shortcut to the absolute demise
It's all unfolding before our eyes dying
The death of millions of fathers
The death of millions of sons
No longer will I care soon all be gone
Yet still forced to march on

[Chorus:]
We've marched on as the ones who still believed
Before our minds perceived
The downfall's closing in on us and
One by one the sun will set down on us
Our memories to dust
Our Farewell though'll be sung forevermore

[Leads: KÃ¶tterl Berger &amp; sheep]

[Chorus:]
One by one the sun will set down on us
Our memories to dust
Our Farewell though'll be sung forevermore
One by one the sun will set down on us
Our memories to dust
Our Farewell though'll be sung forevermore
One by one the sun will set down on us
Our memories to dust
Our Farewell though'll be sung forevermore
One by one the sun will set down on us
Our memories to dust
Our Farewell though'll be sung forevermore
For our cause we sacrificed
For the cause we sacrificed
For a cause we sacrificed
For which cause we sacrificed
For nothing did we sacrifice ourselves
