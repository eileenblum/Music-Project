[Music by Ludwig KÃ¶tterl &amp; Lyrics by Stefanov]

[Verse 1:]
When was the last time I slept?
I do not know
It seems this time
I'm crawling on the bones

[Prechorus:]
This boat's fate is to break swift
And sink asunder
And this time there's just no rock
To crawl under

[Lead: Sheep Berger]

[Verse 2:]
It's this distinct rage
Engulfed by fear
This monument of pain I want to sear
His screams direful
Rend fissures in my ears
Internal clocks are ticking
Loudly for a tear

[Prechorus:]
Emotional strain slithers merciless
My deceiver my eyes of glass

[Chorus:]
No I do not need your amendment
I do not depend on you
Please tell me you're the ned
I do not require aid
I'm not a part of you
I'm only suffering the truth
The circle that we run
Forever In Despair
Subsconciousness his lair
I conflict this disease
Conflict his disease
He can not be seized

[Lead: KÃ¶tterl]

[Verse 3:]
I reach out for myself
Hoping his grasp will become weak
As I gaze upon my arms
I see his the one I seek

[Prechorus:]
Now I perceive that my mind is distinct
Shall I give in or follow my instinct

[Chorus:]
No I do not need your amendment
I do not depend on you
Please tell me you're the ned
I do not require aid
I'm not a part of you
I'm only suffering the truth
The circle that we run
Forever In Despair
Subsconciousness his lair
I conflict this disease
Conflict his disease
He can not be seized
