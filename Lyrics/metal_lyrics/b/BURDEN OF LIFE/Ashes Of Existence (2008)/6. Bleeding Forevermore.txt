[Music by sheep Berger / KÃ¶tterl &amp; Lyrics by Diestelmann]

[Verse 1:]
I become aware of all these lies
Life is to blame for
Dirges always turn into futile cries
As I'm Bleeding Forever More

[Prechorus:]
Nothing to see Which could comfort me
Not even my pride remaining could win this fight bitterly cold

[Verse 2:]
Whensoever one anguish is over
The next begins
But much more Which intensity
And one way less to flee

[Prechorus:]
Dirges still turn into futile cries
As I am Bleeding Forever More

[Chorus:]
One step closer to edge of insanity
I joggle my prison bars with might and maim
I wonder if I will ever find the key belonging
And if I'll ever escape this mental chain

[Lead: Sheep Berger]

[Verse 3:]
Finally I try to continue and I succeed
For I begin to adore every sorrow
Now I resolve to heed
That this will not change tomorrow

[Prechorus:]
Dirges still turn into futile cries
As I am Bleeding Forever More

[Chorus:]
One step closer to edge of insanity
I ooggle my prison bars with might and maim
I wonder if I will ever find the key belonging
And if I'll ever escape this mental chain
