"Run, it's your only hope"
Take cover from your thoughts
Your eyes are bleeding hate
"Your mind and soul are entering to the game"
Distant voices claiming
"Save me, for the punishment of my head"
At your command I assume death

This is how ends all
The earth has born
To see the fields on fire
The sky is red
The clouds are smoked
On dust and violence

Flying all over the wasteland
Between hunters and preys
Close to the stars
Overflying death

I' m dying with honor
I' m killing with pride

This is how ends all
The earth has born
To see the fields on fire
The sky is red
The clouds are smoked
On dust and violence

Prayers to the void
It comes the storm
To tear out, the flesh of the liars
The floor is red
The smoke is choked, on your neck

Where is your god
The earth has born
To see its sons burn on fire
The floor is melted
Like acid rain
It's flooding mindless
