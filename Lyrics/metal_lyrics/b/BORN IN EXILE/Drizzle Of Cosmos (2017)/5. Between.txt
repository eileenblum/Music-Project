Rain is outside
Laughing at death
Doesn't regret
Let the mist
Cover you

Silence inside me
Sadness again
Under my skin
The cruel world of hate inside of us
Silent noise
Trembling
Between me and you

In my dreams
I scream into the void
In the sky
Crows feel sorry for me
But your finger points at me
Manipulating my mind
I can't sleep, I can't breathe,
I can't live without the pressure

When your arms are
Crushing my throat
Whispering
To kill them all
To kill them all

Silence inside me
Sadness again
Under my skin
The cruel world of hate inside of us
Silent noise
Trembling
Between me and you

I can' t let you win this time
Forgetting all suffering
So many thoughts to regret
Don' t break down my dreams
You're not living in my mind
I know you are real
Needles ripping in, my eyes
Nobody can see you, only me

Sharp tears in my eyes
But without them
Your face will be lost
Will be lost
Pain makes me feel
Like I've lost the fight
But after all
I am strong
I am strong

I see you
In every face, every walk
I promised not to run away
I hear your voice
I run again

Silence inside me
Sadness again
Under my skin
The cruel world of hate inside of us
Silent noise
Trembling
Between me and you
Between me and you!

And you know
When I close my eyes
There I will be.
