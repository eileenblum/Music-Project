Don't believe your eyes
Don't believe your ears
Not all glitters is gold
Every damn rotten time

I woke up dead this morning

Hearing bombs
In my tomb
Sirens are shouting
More than you
This is now
Our rotten kingdom
Visions of freedom
Inside the womb

The end of the world is coming
I woke up dead this morning
Six guns are crying, oh well...
It's your desire

Dollar kings
Pesticides
Poisoning our markets
Fluorine, yeah
Fuck you all!

The end of the world is coming
I woke up dead this morning
We will be dead
Before the day it's over

These selfish cowards
Who steals our health?
This ugly business
Who steal our dreams?
I'm just a dot in a map
Waiting to explode

You can see my face
Bloodstained on rage
A fire burning
Growing way too deep

Will you join
Fill the streets and spread the word
And you may know:
This is the end of the world

The end of the world is coming
We woke up dead this morning
We're the kids of the dead creators
Now let's fight for what you stand for!
