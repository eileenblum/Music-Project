The mark of the beast
Written in your forehead
So sweet, the day you were born
I can smell your deadly guilt perfume
You can't believe what have you done
Then and now, you around your pathway
We only need to wake up
Between ruins, rocks, and dead bodies
Who is dancing in your walk?

And stabbing all the feelings
Come with me as a whore
"Give me the snake of the wounded"
Stab me a little more

This soul only live in loneliness
Alone we die
Jump off to the sea of the scars

The corpses are around you
Right now you cannot talk
You didn't wanted a homeless
Neither a prophet more
You cannot lie to yourself
Not even anymore
You've killed the man and the kid
That you were before

This soul only live in loneliness
Alone we die
Jump off to the sea of the scars

This soul only live in loneliness
Alone we die
Jump off to the sea of the scars

You are a coward if you can not understand
Love and death is now the same
