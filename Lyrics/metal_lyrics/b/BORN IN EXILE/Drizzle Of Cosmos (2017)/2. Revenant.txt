I was made of poison
So much as to kill you twice
You don't know how much I've cried

Always breaking all the rules
Waking in the love, confused
This is how my show starts

Silent there
People waits
Your apron in blood
Fireworks, "Du bist so schÃ¶n"
Darkness lay in my jaws

This rage,
My love for hate
You're not going to see me dying
Because I was dead after all
Beware my love for hate
I don't have more time to trying
Because I was mad after all

And she said one more time
"-If I am a bride, in the church
I will run by your hand"
The lake, the mystic, all we had
Goodnight wishes of despair
Missing somebody who never was there

Shouting there
Disappear
The shadows in your room
Fireworks, now you are burnt
This is how the show goes

This rage,
My love for hate
You're not going to see me dying
Because I was dead after all
Beware my love for hate
I don't have more time to trying
Because I am mad after all

Taking care about you is
A slow process to not exist
Wasting a life
Your rotten past will always last
Tomorrow is now and now
I'm done, I'm gone!

This rage,
My love for hate
You're not going to see me dying
Because I was dead after all
Beware my love for hate
I don't have more time to trying
Because I am mad after all
