Born in a desert of greed
Quarrying the soul of Earth
Born in the temples of kill
Killed in the temples of birth

Conquer the world
Conquer them all!
Conquer them all is your aim

Their cry, a thunder you will never hear
Their force, a ray that will destroy your world

Your money stained with black blood
Is spreading oil over our lives
Your coins will be or guillotine
And will sprinkling oil our souls

And time will rot your mind
Please, break this walls
This world is collapsed
Forever... Forever more

Your life is a never ending fall
But your path an endless return
Our hands, the ones can break chains
Is the only way we can change

This life is a never ending brawl
But your mind is and endless circle
Us, the ones can break chains
Is the only way we can change

Conquer your world
Conquer it all and be free
Dispel all the greed
Take some air
Stupid faith
You take the reins of your age
To die in anger or rotting in envy
