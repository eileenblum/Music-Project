We still alive
More than ever
Rough times has passed now
We will rise up

I will fight for this
Until I break my bones
I scream to death, in your head
We are burning the stage tonight
Stare at what you will never get!

I am right here
Another million souls we've conquered
Your failure is my success
Hear the drums
Earthquakes below your feet

"Power belongs
To the ones who take it"
Two guitars, deadly weapons
A battle cry inside your ears

I will fight for this
Until I break my bones
I scream to death, in your head
We are burning the stage tonight
Stare at what you will never get

We are born again
We are born to create this
Hear the depth of the bass
This is my last breath

I am the vanguard now
I have found the oracle
And it revealed to me
We are the chosen ones
Chosen ones!

'Cause you walked away
You're no longer part of this
We were lost
For a moment between two walls
Ravenous!

Do you know...
Know how much we can do?
Don't you remember anything?
We were lost but...

I will fight for this
Until I break my bones
I scream to death, in your head
We are burning the stage tonight
Stare at what you will never get!

We still alive
More than ever
Rough times has passed now
We will rise up
Go!

I will fight for this
Until I break my bones
I scream to death, in your head
We are burning the stage tonight
Stare at what you will never get!
Never get!
