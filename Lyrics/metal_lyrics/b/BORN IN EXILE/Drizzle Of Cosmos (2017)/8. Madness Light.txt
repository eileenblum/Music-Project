Around us for ages
Growing so fast your madness
So many reasons to fight
Your rage is coming through the sky
Running is your last option

Boneless skeleton
Your kingdom is rust

They will not surrender
We will not surrender!

Long time ago
Your dark secrets
Something we know
Now: your sentence

So here we are, and now...
Now this is your last time

In this new world disorder
Now leave your wrath and let us fight
Fight is much better than die
Your sins will be punished at dawn
We are, we are
Go!

Seeking us for ages
Burning so fast your emptiness
So many reasons to fight
The rage never will see the light
Crying is your last option

Boneless skeleton
Your kingdom is rust

In this new world disorder
Now leave your wrath and let us fight
Fight is much better than die
Your sins will be punished at dawn
We are, we are!

You don't know
Who we are...
You don't know
Who we are!
