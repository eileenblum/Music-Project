I'll be your Apparatus,
Take me anywhere you go
Anyone won't lower my status
Your eyes will let me know
Oh, oh I need you so bad
Bad luck is all that I have
Baby if you let me be

Hey girl, so come on
I want to be yours, yeah

I will be your apparatus,
I'll take good care of you
You'll find it's me you can trust
All your senses too
I need you so bad
Bad luck is all that I have
Baby if you let me be

I will be your Apparatus,
I can be anything you say
I can paint you a brighter picture
I'll be there when you say
I need you so bad
Bad luck is all that I have
Baby if you let me be
