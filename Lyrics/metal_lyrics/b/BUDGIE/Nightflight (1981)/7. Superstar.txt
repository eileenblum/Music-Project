You make a turn to the left
You make a turn to the right
You show your big blue eyes
Beneath the big white light
You send the little girls wild
With your little white lies
You excite the child
Or you hypnotize

You're a star, you're a star
You're a superstar
You're a star, you're a star
You're a superstar
(That's what you are)

Your black automobile
You got your blonde at the wheel
And with a big time roll
You try to settle your soul
Standing mean and wild
You're just a little child
You can never really learn
You've got nowhere to run

You're a star, you're a star
You're a superstar
You're a star, you're a star
You're a superstar
(Hit me one time j.t., please)
