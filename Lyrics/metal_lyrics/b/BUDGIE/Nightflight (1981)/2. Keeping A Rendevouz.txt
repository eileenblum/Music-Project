Making me warm under the storm
Keeping a rendezvous
Making me warm under the storm
Keeping a rendezvous

I couldn't stand the rain
Without you to keep me dry
You wouldn't stand it
So we'll meet before we start to fly

I've got a thousand miles to fly
But I can make it by the morning light

I haven't seen you girl
So long, it seems like years have gone
Some things can be so good
It happens time and time again

There's nothing new so we can play
I'll be there sooner girl than yesterday
