If you change your ways, I can always tell
You can always come to me
If you change your ways, I can always tell
'Cause the feeling's so unreal

So little girl, I've been waiting
For you to reveal yourself
Your life's been hesitating
So come on make it tonight

If you change your ways, I can always tell
You can always come to me
If you need a friend, I am always there
You can call me and you'll see

If you change your ways, I just seem to know
I can feel it in the air
You can come around, when you're feeling down
If you need me I'll be there

So little girl, I've been waiting
For you to reveal yourself
Your life's been hesitating
So come on make it tonight
Make it tonight,
I can make you feel alright

If you change your ways, you can always come to me
If you change your ways,
'Cause the feeling's so unreal
