Oh sweet sixteen when she caught my eye
She made a first time love like an apple pie
I got all choked up when she ran around
She just used me up and she threw me right down
Right down on the ground

I wanted her for my loving plan
But she ran out of town with another man
My friends all knew that she ran around
'Cause she used me up and she threw me right down
Right down on the ground

I was cut up bad when she did her stuff
My heart gave in and my love broke up
I'm a broken man so I play the clown
'Cause she used me up and she threw me right down
Right down on the ground
