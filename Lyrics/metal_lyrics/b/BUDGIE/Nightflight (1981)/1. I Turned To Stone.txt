I was born yesterday
Trouble seemed so far away
Now it seems my friends no longer call
Everything was better then
I can still remember when
I saw the future with a certain glow

So I turned to stone
As I learned to know
When I turned to stone
Tell myself I'm feeling all alone

Many days have passed me by
Celebrate with sunny skies
Still I know I need a helping hand
And the friends I thought I knew
See them change my every view
Now it seems I'm seeing them as they really are

No I turned to stone
As I learned to know
When I turned to stone
Tell myself I'm feeling all alone

I was born yesterday
Trouble seemed so far away...
