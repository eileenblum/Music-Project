Lay down, baby don't lay down and die
Hold on, don't lay down and die for no reason at all
So long, you've had it bad
One day soon, you'll laugh aloud
What you're being so sad
Is it really so bad?

Lay down, won't you show me a life
Shake it, blow it away or it cuts like a knife
Bad times they seem to be yours
Certain times only get through if you open the door
Listen to me, then you might see

You've got it wrong, hold out some more
Build a new hope, don't lay down and die

I said lay down, baby don't lay down and die
Save it, we're always alone so lift up your eyes
Stand on your own,
Be what you are do what is right
Life is your own,
Not for too long if you give up the fight
Listen to me then you might see
