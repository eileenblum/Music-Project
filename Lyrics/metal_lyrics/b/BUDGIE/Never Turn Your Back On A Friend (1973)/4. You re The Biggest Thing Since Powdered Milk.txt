You're the biggest thing since powdered milk
Believe for me it's true
I can't give you any old thing
But we just got to be good too
My oh my, my kinda woman
In an all time winning gaffe
I knew some sunny story 'bout a novel and a man

Though it hurts me when I cry
Oh woman child
Oh give it all to me

You're The Biggest Thing Since Powdered milk
Believe for me it's true
I can't give you my guitar
It's all decided blue
You're all I ever want
Oh I need you more and more
But I don't need nobody else
To give me what I came here for

Though it hurts me when I cry
Oh woman child
Oh give it all to me

[Solo]

Watch out or the woman will ruin my soul
Watch out or the woman will take you whole
Oh woman to woman no tears, my soul
That kinda of a woman will ruin my home
And when you want him you tell him 24, tell him 24

The mind is burning
Bright lights in my brain
My mind is confusing
The rich with the sane
Oh woman to woman

Not afraid of the snow
Believe me woman
Don't lead me home
And when you want him
You tell him 24, tell him 24

Oh Yeah

What kind of a woman will ruin my soul
What kind of a woman will leave me whole
Woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, oh woman
