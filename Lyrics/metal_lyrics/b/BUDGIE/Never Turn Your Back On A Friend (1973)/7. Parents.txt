When I was a little boy
They would say to me
Don't go in the world and play
It's bad company

All they had was child and faith
Let him grow and let him wait
Just to find out what it was to be free

But now I'm over twenty one
Growing up I've had my fun
And I know it's got to be

Baby lying in a womb
Are you free or in a tomb
Let me in,
I feel I want to cry.

Oh the road is long
Oh the road is long
Come on back, back.

Wash your hands and up to bed
Mind your manners
Or you're dead
Mind the cars cos you've got school on Monday

Put my trust in God
Who is he I know not what
Something mummy said one Sunday.

Maybe love is life but life is not
It's something I need plenty of.
Oh! I wish I'd died and never lived a day.

Now there's no one near me now
Tell me what to do and how
Take me back and sing my cares away.

Take me let me sing my cares away
Oh! the road is there
Oh that road is there
Come on back, back.

Oh! I'm empty now
Rainy pain has left me now.
Think of what my people used to say.

Black is black and white is white
Which to choose and which is right
Guide me to a place where I can stay.

Wrap me up and keep me warm
Hide myself far from the storm
Sleep and love will keep my mind at rest.

Only now I realise what my parents had to try.
Love you all and keep you all my life.

Oh that road is there
Oh the road is there
Come on back, back.
