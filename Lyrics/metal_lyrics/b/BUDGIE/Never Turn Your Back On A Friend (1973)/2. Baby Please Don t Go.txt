Rollin' off you go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

Why don't you mind that guard
Why don't you mind that guard
Why don't you mind that guard at the County Farm
With your shackles on
Baby please don't go

Gonna be a doll
Gonna be a doll
Gonna be a doll to get your way down here
To make you walk along
Baby please don't go
Don't you go
Don't you go
Yeah ha

Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby please don't go

Why don't you mind that guard
Why don't you mind that guard
Why don't you mind that guard at the County Farm
With your shackles on
Baby please don't go
