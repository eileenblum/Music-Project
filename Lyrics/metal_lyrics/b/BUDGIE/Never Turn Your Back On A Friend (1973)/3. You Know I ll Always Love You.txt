Sun and moon and sky above me.
These are things I treasure most
Sun that lights my way goes on and on and on.
Simple things will not be lost.

You know I'll always love you,
No matter where you are
Feel it all around you
My love will travel far.

Sea of grass and earth below me.
These are things I treasure most.
Men who read the signs go on and on and on.
Better things will soon be gone.

You know I'll always love you
No matter where you are
Feel it all around you
My love will travel far.
