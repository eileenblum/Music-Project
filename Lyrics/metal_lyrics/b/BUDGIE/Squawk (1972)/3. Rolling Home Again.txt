2, 3, 4, I'm going back
To find a place where I came from
And its hidden deep in my heart

There is a way
Shows you all where we came from
And its hidden deep in my heart

Oh well I can't wait a minute longer
My heart ain't gettin' stronger
It didn't deep inside me, me

There is a way
Think I've found another day
And its hidden deep in my heart

Yeah yeah whoo whoo do do etc. etc.

I can't wait a minute longer
My heart ain't gettin' stronger
Its hidden deep inside me, deep inside me

Yeah-ee-yeah

Oh I'm goin' back
I'm goin' back
Find a place where I came from
And I'm headin' here in my heart
I'm just rolling home again
