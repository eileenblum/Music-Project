Oh yeah
Going down to the town
I've gotta f-f-f-f-find where I've gone
Anyday anyway
I've gotta d-d-d-d-do it alone
Gotta go and I know
That I will never never leave her alone
She's a whore at her door
That I could never never never ignore

I don't know what you are,
Will you hold my hand
I don't know what you are,
Help me understand
You will understand

She's as hot as a dockers armpit
She's as hot as a dockers armpit
She's as hot as hey hey hey yeah!
