Stranded! stranded like a lily on a pond
Stranded!
Stranded and I think that I've gone wrong
Stranded! won't somebody help me get away
Stranded! there between the time of night and day

I'm stranded every way I look
I'm stranded on a river
Stranded like a honeysuckle gypsy to a giver
Stranded like a damsel locked up in a tower
Stranded like a minute stranded in the hour

Stranded! every every every way I go
Stranded! stranded and I think you ought to know
Stranded! stranded I've got problems on my mind
Stranded! stranded and I think you're not my kind
Oh no, you're not my kind!

Stranded! stranded every every way I go
Stranded! stranded and I think you ought to know
Stranded! stranded like a fish upon a beach
Stranded! stranded and I think it's out of reach

Well I'm stranded every where I look
I'm stranded in a river
Stranded like a honeysuckle gypsy to a giver
Stranded if you wanna be stranded if you don't
Stranded like a martian landing in a font
Yeah yeah!
