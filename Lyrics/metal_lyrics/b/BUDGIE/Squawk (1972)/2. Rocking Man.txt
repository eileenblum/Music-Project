Just like a river, well I keep rolling along
Just like a singer, well I keep singing a song
And like a hobo, well I just ramble my way
Across a night time, behind the milky way

So if you see a sign of a rocking man
Look at what your doin'

I keep a flying, until I see light of day
And they are standing, until the band starts to play
And where were rolling, well I see, know what you mean
I know the feeling, well it is kind of a dream

Oh and if you see a sign of a rocking man
Look at what your doin'

Oh oh yeah
Just like a hammer, well I just hammer a song
It's like a boulder, and I just tumble along
I never worry about the things that I plan
I'm not a preacher, I'm just a rocking man

Oh if you see a sign of a rocking man
Look at what your doin'
