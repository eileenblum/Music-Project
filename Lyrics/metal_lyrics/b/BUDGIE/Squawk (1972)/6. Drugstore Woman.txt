Don't need no drugstore woman
No I don't need no drugstore girl
I don't need no drugstore woman
Oh every every every way I go
Oh day or night well it's alright
Hey hey yeah, oh yeah

Said I don't need no pirate queen
Well I don't want it, do you know what I mean?
Well every way I look, and every way I go
Every day I see her in the window
'cause I don't want, and I don't need
Hey hey yeah, oh yeah

Oh I don't need no drugstore woman
No I don't need no drugstore woman
Well I don't need what I don't see
Oh every every every way I go
Well day or night well it ain't right
Oh hey yeah, oh yeah
Like I say
Well I don't need no drugstore woman
