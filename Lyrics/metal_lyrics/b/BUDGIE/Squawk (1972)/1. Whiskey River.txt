Oh lay me down girl, 'cause I'm going
Like a river, overflowing
I hear someone who is crying
I don't know 'cause I am dying

See my father tell my mother
Tell my sister tell my brother
Get me out girl and I'll feel better
Bring me round with whisky glitter

Now I lie here I have fallen
Hear the sound of music calling
Mirror mirror I am seeing
Half a man but not believing

Oh, don't like believing
