Young is a world where I often go
To live alone I will everflow
I can be big, somebody says I'm a man
'til I met you and do you know what I am
People are strange everywhere I go
But you're not strange, I will let you know
I can be big, that is only to say
'til I met you life is only a day
Only a day, only a day

People are strange everywhere I go
But you're not strange, I will let you know
I can be small but that is only to say
'til I met you and life is only a day
Only a day, only a day
