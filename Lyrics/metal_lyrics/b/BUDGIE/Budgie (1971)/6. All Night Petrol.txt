Come on baby take me to your heart
Just take a ride up in my car
Oh, I'll just refuel before we start
The day is night before we part
What a perfect living, what a perfect day

You think you've got no place to go
And your daddy's kicked you on the road
You need a lover not a foe
So you just relax and then unload
What a perfect living, what a perfect day

So you think you're foolish playing hell
All night petrol beats you with its smell
You take a burning lamp and tell time
Slumped upon the floor where we once fell
What a perfect living, what a perfect day

You want me no
You let me go
You won't say no
