Happiness is what you want, all I get is pain
But if I left you pretty baby,
Would you have me back again?
You need somebody baby, to tell you what to say
You need somebody baby, to show you all the way
Need somebody baby, tell you what to say
You need somebody baby, to show ,
Show you all the way

Hey woman, wipe off the ink from your eyes
Hey woman, why do you think you're so wise?
Hey lover, what do you punish me for?
Hey woman, what passes behind the door
Give me a bite of the apple, my hands are tied
Give me your inky pen and come on back,
Come on back to me

Hey woman, why don't you love me again?
Oh woman I wanna be your best friend
Ooh lover, what do you punish me for?
Hey woman, past is now behind the door
Give me a bite of the apple, my hands are tied
Give me your inky pen and come on back,
Come on back to me
