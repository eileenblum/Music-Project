You've got me living in sin
You've got me breaking my heart
You've got me out on a limb
And I am falling apart
The sun is burning my face
My insides running a race
I need somebody with soul
You are my life and my goal
I need your love, love

I want somebody who's good
I need somebody who's right
I need a lover who will
Not a lover who might
I wanna love you again
And then again and again
I'm gonna empty you out
I wanna be with you now
I want your love, love

Love, love me yes
Yeah you'd better love me
You'd better love me yes
Yeah love, you'd better love me

Love, love me yes
Yeah you'd better love me
Lord you've gotta help me
Love me yeah, you love me yes
Lord, you love me yeah

You've got me living in sin
You know what to do
You've got me out on a limb
I feel it coming in two
