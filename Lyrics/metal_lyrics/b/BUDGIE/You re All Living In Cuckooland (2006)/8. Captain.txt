Captain, captain, won't you take me round the world with you
Captain, captain, on the love boat I will be the crew
Oh and I'll be with you

I can scent the filthy seas, sulphur in the morning breeze
How are we to find our way? Without your guiding hand I'll stray
Round the mountains made of tyres, bridges stacked like Eiffel towers
Somehow you will navigate, through the maze and out the gate. Away

Health and safety pirates hide, like rag worm just above the tide
for unsuspecting men like me, to nip and trip me as I flee.
Voices call from swollen lungs, to other threats in other tongues
Aliens from other worlds will meet us to exchange a word or two

Captain, captain, won't you take me round the world with you
Captain, captain, on the love boat I will be the crew
Oh and I'll be with you

Somewhere is a far off land, with crystal water, golden sand
And all the trees are full of fruit, light years from the grimy soot
'till you say the final word, at the end of all known worlds
you take my hand and comfort me, now we cross the endless sea
Forever, ever

Life is like an endless sea, I'll make it if I know you're with me
We can take the highest wave with you I am safe

Captain, captain, won't you take me round the world with you
Captain, captain, on the love boat I will be the crew
Oh and I'll be with you
