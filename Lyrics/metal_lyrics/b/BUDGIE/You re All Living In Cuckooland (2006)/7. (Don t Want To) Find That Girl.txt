She likes to party with the high class
Yeah, to make a big noise
It's said she's always perfumed
Yeah, to please the naughty boys
Do you wanna be her, yeah, to get, get, get your way
Do you, do you, oh yeah to fill a dizzy day
One for the Gucci shoes in a row
Stepped on a pile of knives, kept for show

D'ya wanna find that girl? (Don't wanna find that girl)
D'ya wanna find that girl? (Don't wanna find that girl)
D'ya wanna find that girl? (Don't wanna find that girl)

You've got your book with all your numbers
Yeah, to make a rendezvous
Your little Peep toe matches living in a human zoo
Do you wanna be her? Yeah, she's selling her soul
Hah, do you, do you? Yeah, goodtime for 'mark it down'
One in the money, two to the show
Go get the bling now walk out go

D'ya wanna find that girl? (Don't wanna find that girl)
D'ya wanna find that girl? (Don't wanna find that girl)
D'ya wanna find that girl? (Don't wanna find that girl)

Cats eyes, cats eyes, cats eyes every time I look at you
That's why, that's why, that's why. I'll never be attracted to you
Make up, make up, make up, what kind of thing do you mean?
Wake up, wake up, wake up, you just wanna be seen on the scene.

Well yeah, you ordered your aromas you got secret stones
You call the paparazzi (yes) to get your picture shown
Do you really want her? Do you wanna be that girl?
Do you, do you, yeah, you'll only get yourself burned
It's one for the Gucci shoes in a row,
Make for the Cadillac, Quid pro quo.
