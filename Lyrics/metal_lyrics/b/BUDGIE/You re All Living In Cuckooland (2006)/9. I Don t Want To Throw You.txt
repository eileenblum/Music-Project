I don't know why I make your sparks fly
And bring you down and I steal away all your tears (yes I do)
Are we messed up like oil and water
Or I'm an octane and maybe you're the fire

Don't want to throw you but this thing is going nowhere
Don't want to throw you but this thing is up in the air

It's like eating a razor sandwich when
Under your tree while in a lightning storm (yes it is)
If my music is dead to your ears
And your friends hate it but I can't change my form, oh no

Don't want to throw you but this thing is going nowhere
Don't want to throw you but this thing is up in the air

You're so pushy and I won't take that
And did you notice I'm moving on my way. Yes.
