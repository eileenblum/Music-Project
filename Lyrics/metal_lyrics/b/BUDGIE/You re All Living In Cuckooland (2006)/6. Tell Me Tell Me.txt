It's a kind of life that was meant to be
All you ask, if you ask, well you asked of me
Can it be that you met someone who smiles
When you say that you wanted to delete my files

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, What's wrong with you?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, What can I do?

Well, I know if you're feeling hot or you're feeling cool
If you ask me to try, will I be your fool
Give it up if you care, it can change your mind
If you feel that your goal has to be refined

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, What's wrong with you?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, What can I do?

State of the art, state of your mind
State what you need, State your kind
If I try, if I try to receive the wave
At this time of life nothing can be saved

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, What's wrong with you?
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, What can I do?
