Love, love, love is enough
All through the storm it will keep you
Love, love, love is enough
Fill up your heart and be free

Love, love, love is the stuff
Better than gold, making you whole
Drink, drink, drink from the cup
Fill up our soul and be real

Close your eyes and think about it
All the light will go without it
Put away your fear about letting go
So you'll find life in the word

Love, love, love is enough
No more in need, no more to bleed
Love, love, love is enough
Make it your life and be free
Lift up your heart and be free
