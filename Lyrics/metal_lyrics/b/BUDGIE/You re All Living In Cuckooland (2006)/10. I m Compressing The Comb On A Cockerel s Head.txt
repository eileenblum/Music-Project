Oh I been on my knees I can't say my prayer
I've been up a mountain, falling down the stairs
I can't fix my bones, got to put it right
What you gonna do boy, if you've got to fight
Yes it's our chance, wanna bit more dance
Get down on my knees now or I'll go to seize
I can't move my toes I can tie the knot.
Yes I'm gonna lose, oh my legs are shot.

I'm compressing the comb on a cockerel's head
I'm compressing the comb on a cockerel's head

Yeah, think I've got the cure, think I found it out
Baby it's a joke, won't you scream and shout.

I'm compressing the comb on a cockerel's head

Got to mend my bones, got to run a race
Got to play my songs, got to lift the bass
Got to shake my head, got to move my feet
Got to wake the dead, girding up the beat yes

I'm compressing the comb on a cockerel's head
I'm compressing the comb on a cockerel's head

Seizing up my hip, think I'm gonna die
Got to bite my lip cos I'm running out of time
Heard about the same state, got to make it pose
That is not the way that I can hear you grow

I'm compressing the comb on a cockerel's head
I'm compressing the comb on a cockerel's head

My heart ain't broken my bones are broken
My heart ain't broken my bones are broken
My heart ain't broke my bones are broke
My heart ain't broken my bones are broken
