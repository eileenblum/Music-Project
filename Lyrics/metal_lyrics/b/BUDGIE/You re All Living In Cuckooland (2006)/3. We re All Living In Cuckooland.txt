I can see we're tumbling down to earth
As for me I'm falling for all I'm worth
Everything that's wrong isn't right for me
I'm not wrong cos right is the way to be
You know, you know
We're all living in cuckooland!

All the killers celebrate victory
Unbelievers check out your history
And all the helpers dying to help you out
Everybody's drinking us to a drought, no doubt
You know, you know
We're all living in cuckooland!

Words are twisted so you can't understand
The aural menace spreading across this land
Even love is hated for being good
That'll end when people do what they should do
You know, you know
We're all living in cuckooland!
