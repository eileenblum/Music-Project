I tried to crawl away from it all
All that I did just speeded my fall
Falling, falling

I know the take, write it in haste
Now that the world is up to my face
Falling, falling

All through the day, all through the night
I keep on hoping that I'll win the fight
Falling, falling

Giving it up, I can't give it away
Giving t up, I can't keep it at bay
Giving it up, I can't give it away
Giving it up, I can't keep it at bay
