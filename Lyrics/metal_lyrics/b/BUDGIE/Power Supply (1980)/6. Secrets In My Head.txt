Secret in my head
Secret in my head

I get the feeling again
You don't believe it when I say
Sometimes each lonely day
Keeping these secrets in my head

If you could understand me
I would be drawn into your fire
But you could not relate
So I'm left with my desire

Someday I'll change my mind
Taking some action in my brain
Everything passed me by
I'll never be the same again
I have the same old feeling
That I was right in what I say
Sometimes each lonely day
Keeping these secrets in my head
