He stepped out through the door
Long face with a Stetson on
Hero of suicide, stepped into the light
He stood ready to fight

I called don't go
It's not the way that a man should go,
No, stand back and let it ride
You've already died, said you've already died
It's that bad feeling inside, yeah

Aiming low, he followed his hand
Gunslinger pose, classic stance
Bad glamour dream, into the sand
He fell to the floor
And he won't fight no more
He can't help being a bore
