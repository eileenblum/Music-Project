Hellbender what journey are we on?
Hellbender we journey on and on

Look at the man making a fast buck
Filling his pockets and bringing us bad luck
Breaking the rock is something we all do
Keep it on ice, magical voodoo you

Now where we gonna run?
Hellbender it's only just begun

Look at the world gathering armour
Losing a minute in every hour
Pity the soul coming to you
Keep it on ice, magical voodoo you

What journey are we on?
Hellbender where do we all belong?

Look at the man
Dirt in his pocket
Breaking the rock
Keep it on ice
Look at the world
Losing a minute
Pity the souls
Keep it on ice
Magical voodoo
