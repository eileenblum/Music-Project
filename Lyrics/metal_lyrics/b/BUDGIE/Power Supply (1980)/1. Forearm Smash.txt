Well I've grown up in a ring of tangles
Gonna make my move gonna use all the angles
Somebody said you were a spitfire cat
Burning love gonna put an end to that
Wanna clean break, clean fight
Shake my hand but you don't try anything rash
Catch you with my long throw
Take you by surprise
Gonna get you with a forearm smash

Baby, forearm smash
Baby, forearm smash

Seconds away gonna break your back
If you don't wanna play then don't give me flak
People spend money just to see you fall
When you're out for the count
They won't care no more, no more

I wanna clean fight baby so you'd better move over
I'm a heavy weight killer with a featherlight mover
It's a long time holding my arms around you
I'm gonna fight dirty 'cause I'm gonna get you
Oh, he hit me, he cut me
Pulling my hair, aiming below the belt
It's a prize fight and I was right
It's a grudge fight over woman that gives me hell

Baby, forearm smash
Baby, forearm smash
