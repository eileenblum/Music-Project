Don't wanna leave my electric house
My lover got electric bills
I won't die in an electric chair
My power is everywhere

Power supply

I am an independent man
A love generator is what I am
And I give another million watts
This power supply is hot

Power supply
Power supply

A magnetic personality
Soaking the duality
My power supply will be
My love for eternity

Power supply
