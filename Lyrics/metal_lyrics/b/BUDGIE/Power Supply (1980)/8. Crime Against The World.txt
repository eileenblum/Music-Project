Get up, get out of bed
I'll wrap my fist right around your head
Shut up, sit down, sit tight
Interrogate you roaming in the night

Crime against the world
Crime against the world
I am against the world
Crime against the world

He comes down and out with his stuff
I don't cry baby even when it's tough
He's wise he knows he wants you
And if he takes you what you gonna do?
The world's full of these mystery men
Who turn up, drag out my brethren
It's ain't right, it's all wrong
The backside of a very shiny coin

Hey hey
Why won't you listen, won't you listen to me
Hey hey
You, I'll think he'll get you

I get you mad, I get you bad
It's the worst I've ever had
Let me out, let me be
I am a brave man going to be free
