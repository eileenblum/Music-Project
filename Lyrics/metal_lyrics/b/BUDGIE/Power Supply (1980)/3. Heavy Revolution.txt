Put your hands on your black guitar
Hit the chord for a rock and roll star
Our heads jumping up and down
Heavy rock bands are back in town
(You'll be coming too, and a hope you're alright)

Singing in the night, moving finds a solution
shaking in the night, it's a heavy revolution

Now you been struck with an ice machine
And we do it till the peoples scream
You let loose when the lights go out
Let's move and sing and shout
(Come on I wanna hear you play that music baby, clap your hands)

They cried with a mighty roar
Ten million people or more
They stand like a mighty hand
Heavy music is in the land
So put your hands on your black guitar
Hit the chord for a rock and roll star
Our heads jumping up and down
Heavy rock bands are back in town
(Hear my message to you, it's for you. yeah I sing my song)
