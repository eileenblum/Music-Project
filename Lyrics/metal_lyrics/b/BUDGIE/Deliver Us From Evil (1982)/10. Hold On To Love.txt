Keep the fire of life alight,
Give it all you can
Open up your hand, reach out
Your positive reactions fight
Your run of empty luck
Empty 'cause they've snuffed love out

Hold on to, hold on to love
Why don't you hold on to love?
Hold on to, hold on to love
Everyone hold on to love

There's a school of higher thought
That hears the frequency
A universal key, sing out
Although it's run is separate
Like islands in the stream
Tune in to the beat listen out

When you're disillusioned with
The path your life has run
There is only one remedy
What's the use in having
If you don't appreciate
Love can turn to hate so easily
