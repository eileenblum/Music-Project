Young girl so naive
Young and hungry, seventeen
Sweet thing, peaches and cream
Sells her body, lives in a dream
She found love, she found it in his eyes
Drifts about so all she does is cry

Young girl learning fast,
She's so different she has no past
Nightlife takes its toll on the sweet thing
She's growing old
She found love, she found it in his arms
Drifts about, he's always telling lies

Young girl tired of rejection
Young girl needing some affection

Young girl realizes her body,
Is her ticket to life
Sweet thing she walks out
So she tells him and starts to shout
She found love, she found it in his eyes
He's got a gun now she's gonna die

Young girl, tired of rejection
Young girl, needing some affection
Young girl, tired of rejection
Young girl, needing some affection
Young girl
