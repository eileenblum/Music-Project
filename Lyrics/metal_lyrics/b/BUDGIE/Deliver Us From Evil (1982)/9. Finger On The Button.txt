I touched a nerve and made you jump
I sounded so unkind
A wild effect might come and hide
Upon your troubled mind
I could have used a little tact
Instead of speaking out
Your temperament was much too quick and hot

Finger on the button,
You're ready to shoot me down
Waiting to set the world on fire
Finger on the button,
You're waiting to shoot me down
Some things I say
Are not meant to be taken that way

You took my words so literally
It made you look the fool
But obstinence should not incite
Such sweet revenge so cruel
But having taken orders
I will apologize
But don't you think it's time we really tried?

Hold it back
Hold it back
Remember I'm a friend
