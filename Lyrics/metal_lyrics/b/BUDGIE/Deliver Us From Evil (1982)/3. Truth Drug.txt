Never believe in the bellicose talker
Pretending his cause to be just and strong
The onrushing torrent of words to convert
Entice me to follow along

Truth drug! Sell it to the bad boys
Making all of their noise, ringing in my ears
Truth drug! Give it to the bad guys
Don't you know that their lies,
Are not allowed in here

The energy relays rhetorical speeches
The sugar sweet voice tells me this is the best
The durable quality lasts for a second
I fell for the scam like the rest

You think it's funny, to make your money
By telling your lies.
Crawl back under your stone!

I got it wrong when you wrote me a letter
That said you would love me forever and ever
Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind
Keeping respect for each other
