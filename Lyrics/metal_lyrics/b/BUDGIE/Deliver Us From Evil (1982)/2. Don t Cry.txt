Don't cry, don't cry
Hold on, we'll meet again
So long to Independence Day

Don't cry, don't cry
Be strong, the mist must fade away
My heart goes with you today

Don't cry, stand on your own
Don't cry you know you're never alone
Don't cry, don't cry

Oh, my life is just the same as yours
Your will, open up the doors
Don't cry, don't cry
