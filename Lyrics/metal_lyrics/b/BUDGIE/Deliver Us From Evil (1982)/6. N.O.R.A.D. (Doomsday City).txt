Light, missile coming, sun is dawning
Early warning, flash of a light in the sky
A long black cavern, Cheyenne Mountain
Minutes counting, warning to keep you alive

Fade out! One of the names for killing the masses
Fade out! It's your fault
Fade out! Extreme in demise, we can't take a chance
Fade out! It's your fault

Look at the world through the eyes of NORAD
Look at the world through the eyes of NORAD

Wait, before reason, now the season
Changes to the coldest of all in the fall
There, down below, that they were told to
Take a loaded gun to be held at the head

Fade out! You cannot be saved so blow up the world
Fade out like defcom
Fade out! We must be insane it's really a drill
Fade out like defcom

(A sycophant is not what you think
I feel helpless and practically double dictated)
Look at the world through the eyes of NORAD
Look at the world through the eyes of NORAD

Look what you've done to the world
