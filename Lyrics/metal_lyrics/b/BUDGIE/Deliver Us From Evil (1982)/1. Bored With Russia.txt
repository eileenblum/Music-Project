You and I don't talk now
It didn't start out that way
I'm bored with the game now
I think it's too late

I've had time alone
To think things through somehow
I can't hold back to forget the pain I'm feeling now
Oh, Russia what went wrong?
Why won't you tell me aren't you that strong?
Cut out my heart with your switchblade eyes
There's no alibis

I'm bored with Russia (bored with Russia)
Hanging out in Stalin square
I'm bored with Russia (bored with Russia)
You won't talk so I don't care

What are you hiding?
I've asked myself a thousand times
You said it's no good,
Why don't you make up your mind?
Oh, Russia I've got to say
I'm tired of feeling this way
Oh, Russia before it's too late
Set the record straight
