Give me the truth, give me the truth
Righteous you are to follow the star
Give me the truth, give me the truth you do
Why don't we see oh the simplicity?

You might think that I'm falling down on my luck
But you were wrong 'cause you know
That what you get is the undiluted real, you feel

Give it a chance, love is like Lennon said
Love is the bread we'll be happy to spread
Give me the truth, it's tuned to its proper sound
And this part I play is the music for me

You might think that I'm falling
Into the trap that tension has laid, but I say
What can I do when I know I feel this way, this way

Give me the truth, everyone criticize
Don't take offence, but pride is a brand of lies
Give me the truth, give me the truth
Righteous you are so follow your star
