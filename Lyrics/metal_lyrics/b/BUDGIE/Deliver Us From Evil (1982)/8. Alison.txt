Alison, Alison
Locked inside your head
Keep the words I said
And you'll always remember

Alison, Alison
They come to you and cry
Help to dry their eyes
Soothing their sorrow

Waking in the morning
She is moody as she opens the day
Slowly through the hour
She will open like a flower
And smile in her way
