I don't want it honey you believe it
I don't need no quacktor to tell me why
I can't see it why do we believe it
I don't need no quacktor to tell me why
Taking all my money away,
But I don't understand what the bureaucats say

Keep up to my pace, crawling through the rat race
I don't need no quacktor to tell me why
Exploitation, inter city nation
We don't need the quacktor to tell us why

Oh working an assembly line
But the money we make is a bureaucats slime
Oh when I'm walking home
Got my heart in my mouth that it hurts me yeah
And I'm almost gone
I know a man he won't let me know

Extra extra read all about it
I don't need no quacktor to tell me why
They take the high road we take the no road
We cannot go back to tell us why

Singing on the radio waves
But the man in the box
He's talking no raise, so pay

I don't want it honey you believe it
I don't need no quacktor to tell me why, why
I can't see it why do we believe it
I don't need no quacktor to tell me why
Oh when I'm walking home
Got my heart in my mouth that it hurts me no
I'm almost gone
I know a man he don't let me know

Oh working an assembly line
But the money we make is a bureaucats slime
To me, to me
Oh, and what's cooking
Keep on looking
All the time
