Black velvet stallion, you are gone
Chasing a windsong, be my son
Always here wondering
Hoof beats are thundering through me
Maybe you're running from me

Black velvet stallion are you near
Carry me far away from my fear
Son of an Arab mare
Roaming on solid air and free
While you are living be free

Black velvet stallion be alone
Send me a messenger call me home
Pictures and silhouettes
Spending a pirouette on me
Maybe you're coming to me

Black velvet stallion you're my child
Flower of tenderness growing wild
Look through my wilderness
No one would ever guess you're me
What I am seeing is me
