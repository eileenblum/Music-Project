You're opening doors, I'm showing you mine
Kill some time, and taking our lifetime away
I know I feel lost following you
Holding the sign that promised
Room for another view

I never worry about the wind and rain
I never hurry it tell me you're the same
I couldn't live with a black tomorrow
And I'll be sure that it heard its name

Well you know the tale
I told you before
You're calling the shots
Making my reason fly out the door
