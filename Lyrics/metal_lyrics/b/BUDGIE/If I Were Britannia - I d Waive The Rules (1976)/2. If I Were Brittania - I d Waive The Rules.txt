Some people try to tell me that life is a joy
Others think I'm crazy when I say it's a toy
Only the lonely understand that it's true
Only Britannia has the right to waive the rules

Any man can realize that love is not a sin
All you do is shake it up and then you let it in
Any man can realize that life is just a toy
Take a chance and waive the rules
And make your time a joy

I met a woman the other day,
She told me that it was egg on my face
It was a certain disgrace, I can't take it no more
I'm just insisting I do understand,
I'll never be a part of the band
They start to teach you at school
If I were Britannia, I'd waive the rules

Temptation's on your mind,
It's gonna make your body high
Although you know it was only pride, but I paid

You'll earn your ticket out of rock and roll
But some are pulling you home
I take it that you don't know,
It's just a part of the show
They couldn't make me see why,
There ain't no blue in the sky
That's like they teach you at school

Temptation's on your mind,
It's gonna make your body high
Although you know it 's pride

If I were Britannia, I'd waive the rules
