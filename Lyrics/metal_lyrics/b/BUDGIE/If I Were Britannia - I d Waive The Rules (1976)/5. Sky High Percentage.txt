Heaven knows your name
Like the river it flows through my veins
Children speak the same
As the voice, that I hear plays its game
But I know, I know that they'll know
That the man in the moon
Has a traveling tune

Heaven has its face
As the thought in my head takes its place
You seek it and you will find
That people might say you were blind
But they know, they know that I know
Like the sun and the moon
I'll be traveling soon

Heaven has no doors
Just the thought in my head and it's cold
And the voice that we hear
Says the words that are close to my ears
I'll know, I'll know that they'll know
Like the sun and the moon
I'll be traveling soon
