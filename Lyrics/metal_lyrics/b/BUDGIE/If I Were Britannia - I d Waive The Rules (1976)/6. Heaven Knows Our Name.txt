Ten thousand men are waiting to take the place of you
Much money to be made, they're exchanging point of view
Baby I don't need the action, show me the way to the door
Always a sky high percentage, why do I come back for more
Love is the reason they ain't got no place in with me.

Life is a game of chess boy, you're just another pawn
Homebreakers claw your heart out
They hide with curtains drawn
Baby I don't need the action, show me the way to the door
Always a sky high percentage, why do I come back for more
I'm just protesting 'cause people keep messing me round

You keep your eyelids open, don't ever be forlorn
'Cause if the money's coming, your battle chips are down
Baby I don't need the action, show me the way to the door
Always a sky high percentage, why do I come back for more
Love has been wasted it should have been tasted by you

Love has been wasted time and time again

Over and over
Baby I don't need the action, show me the way to the door
Always a sky high percentage, why do I come back for more
I got the notion that love is an ocean of weeds

Ten thousand men are waiting to take the place of you
Much money to be made, they're exchanging point of view
I've got a piece of the action, don't need a key to the door
I'm on a sky high persuader why did you come back for more
Love is the reason you ain't got no place in with me

Love has been wasted
