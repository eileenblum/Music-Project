I can't see my feelings open my eyes
I can't see my feelings open my pair of eyes

I can't see my feelings keeping me high
I just keep on reeling bought me back tell me why

I just stand there screaming,don't even try
Music bans all feeling
If it'll tell me why

I can't stop that feeling showing me why
Man I love that feeling yeah
Floats me right through the sky
