In the morning light of day
Leaves are falling
Slip away
Slip away with you

And the reason, men are told
Is the feeling
Of never growing old
Growing old with you

In the daytime feel like it's almost gone
And the evening gently lingers on
And the feeling warms my glow
Faking time
Taking time, we know

In the morning light of day
Leaves are falling
Slip away
Slip away with you

Gently slip away
Gently slip away
Gently slip away
