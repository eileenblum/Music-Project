Ooh, big man with a grip of steel
And a hard fast time with the kicks
He ain't big when the chips are down
I bet you got a guitar lick
He turns back and rolls over
Curls up in a ball
Someday I guess we gotta find out
We're all alone
So we'd better stand tall o.k.

We are more than the answers
And we are here never few
Those silly things when people tell me what to do
We're alone in a dark sheet of blue
Sweet loving, sweet loving I run for cover
Stop giving your pain to me, sweet talking and liberty

You are all I could need,
Grown a thousand from my sea yeah
We must do what we must do and then in time
I will talk and I'll take my line
Sweet loving, sweet loving and run for cover
Stop giving your pain to me, sweet talking and liberty, yeah

My daddy is a bigger man
He's the lone wolf run with the pack
Ran out after living his part
And he told me to never look back
Don't dilute the water man
Look ready to beg
Someday I guess we gotta find out
We're all alone
So we'd better stand tall alright

My daddy said to me just give it a try boy
Said you ain't got a monkey on your back
I said oh I don't know why
Don't dilute the water man, don't dilute the water man
Don't dilute the water man, don't dilute the water man
Don't do it to me
