Love divine, it's got a hold of me
It's changed my life for the better
For the better
By one hundred degrees
Heaven is open for earth to see
All I want is love for you and me

Love is devotion
Led myself away from you
But when your soul gets lonely
You'll hear love calling you
Heaven is open to earth and sea
All I want is love for you and me

Oh oh got to love
I got to love
Stay with me
In time
I'll give my all to you
