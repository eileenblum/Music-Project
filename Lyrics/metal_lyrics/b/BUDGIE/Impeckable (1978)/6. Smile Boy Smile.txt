I don't wanna woman who would make me cry
I don't wanna woman who can tell me lies
I don't wanna woman with fancy eyes
I don't wanna woman who is sweet as pie
I only wanna woman to make me smile boy smile

Oh make me, take me lord
Don't wanna woman to make me cry
Make me, take me
Don't wanna woman to cry

I don't like the feeling when I'm on my own
I need the kind of loving that I get at home
I want your body and I love you so
But I don't wanna reason and I don't care why
I only wanna woman to make me smile boy smile

Oh make me, take me lord
Don't wanna woman to make me cry
Make me, take me
Don't want my woman to cry

I need you in the morning at the break of dawn
You know I can't stand it when I find you've gone
I feel kinda lucky when I hear this song
Well I might be crazy but I can't say why
I only wanna woman to make me smile boy smile

Oh, take me lord
Don't want my woman to make me cry
Make me, take me lord
Don't want my woman to cry
