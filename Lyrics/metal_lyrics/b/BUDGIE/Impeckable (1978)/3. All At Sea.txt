Oh but you know we're almost gone
It takes a whole lot of heart to build a man
'Cause we are all at sea
We are all at sea
But nothing you do can do me no harm
Back on the road back to the farm
Where everything's bright
And every thing's rosy too

Here on the farm and bright so warm
We are here, we are here and on a phone
And we are all at sea, we are all at sea
Nothing you do can do me no harm
Back on the road back to the farm
Where everything's bright
And every thing's rosy too

Bells have been rung so we can see
My veil has been made by ego me
I have been all at sea, I have been all at sea
But nothing you do can do me no harm
Back on the road back to the farm
Where everything's bright
And every thing's rosy too
Rosy too, rosy too
It's a rosy rosy

All at sea
All at sea
All at sea
All at sea
