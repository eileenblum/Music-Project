Still the sound of voices whisper tenderly
Still the sound of voices whisper tenderly
Don't go away, don't go away

Oh the summer time, pictures in a dream
Do the people play the game?
And fill an empty stream
When it comes to reasons for what is said and done
All the lights are broken
By another lonely tonight
Still the sound of voices whisper tenderly
Don't go away, don't go away

Sit you down beside me, light my darkened way
Someone said look out for now,
The future still remains
Past is gone and now the day is slowly drifting by
Look out my friend don't be a loser
Save yourself and cry, have abandon freedom
Don't go away, don't go away

Life can last a love time, open up your book
Come and take a look inside this heart of mine
I'll reveal behind my seal of endless words I say
Pass a little love my way don't hide
Only fools would turn a page
And walk away from me
Don't go away, don't go away
