I know what I want and I'm able to grow it
But fashion dictators believe that you own it
Material things ain't got the last laugh girl
The pyramid way is a thing of the past girl

The way people try to escape only I'll know
The latest in style is a pyramid of love
The light, the light that is calling me home
Pyramids, don't you think you're a dead stone
