I give my best to you, it always seems I do
But underneath it all, I'm feeling very, very small
Afraid I am you see, to tell you who with me
Because you might withdraw, before I am no more

Listen to me woman, listen to me woman
You claim that I am mean, telling you what I see
I have to face the truth, guess I'm the same as you

Don't wait outside my door,
When I am lying on the floor
Pretending I am strong, although I know it's wrong
My cover seems to be, a special part of me
Depending on the mood, I am my life I rule

Listen to me woman, listen to me woman
You claim that I am mean, telling you what I see
I have to face the truth, guess I'm the same as you

I am a faker, I am a faker
