Melt the ice away, that's what they say
Say it, say it, say it's safe
Don't you breakdown under hailstone
Yeah you can do what you want
You can be what you want
It's a bad bad world,
Yes, you know they can hurt
I'm the same as you, I need loving too

Cold winds are blowing
I think it's time I was going
Sad sad city
When you're giving for a living
Yeah you can have it with me
It's a perfect dream
You can be here too
There's a lot you can do
By the way you appear
In the eyes of the world
Take my word

You can see the sign coming from afar
You can see the sign coming from afar
Can you see it there?
Oh, oh, melt the ice away

When we're attacking, red lights flashing
Oh, you can burn out a wire, it's a crazy desire
You can go with the wind, you can be my friend
You don't need a hand, oh it's the promised land

You can see the sign coming from afar
You can see the sign oh yeah it's there
Oh, oh, melt the ice away
Melt the ice away, yeah, melt the ice away
