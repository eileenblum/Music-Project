Living ain't easy it opens your head
Layin' and prayin' you wish you were dead
When I was born I was given a will
That the meaning of life is
I'm in for the kill

Loving knowing giving showing
Love is seeing and ever being
Motor cruising midnight boozing
Altar singing and bells that are ringing

You got a reason to listen to me
For I am a messenger carrying the key
Money is nothing to hold into wills
And the meaning of life is
I'm in for the kill

You see me moving around playing on people's minds
But I won't be for nobody I only have a way of return
Take me make me do what you want
You ain't gonna mock up me
Well I am the tolls and I am the right
And I am the earth and the sea

Hey there you with a lock that is boozed
Gonna say it with a face that's red
It's only the ones who can take the pain
Who can take that golden hat
I'm only trying to help you love in a world
That is hot and rough
It's me and you and a cat named boo
And a woman who has run out of stuff
