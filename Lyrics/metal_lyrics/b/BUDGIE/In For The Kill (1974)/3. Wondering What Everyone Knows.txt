I never walk in the street,
Or gather round where people meet
With you on my head and me on my toes
Wondering what everyone knows,
Wondering what everyone knows

I bystand for the post, but all my letters are lost
With you on my head and me on my toes
Wondering what everyone knows,
Wondering what everyone knows
Wondering what everyone knows

Darkness in white you can feel through the light
of the darkest cloud and touch my hand

You are a sound in my head,
Sew up my ears with your thread
With you on my head and me on my toes
Wondering what everyone knows,
Wondering what everyone knows
Wondering what everyone knows
