will love leave you senseless
attached to your dreams
in your bittersweet, selfish aroma
paint you hysterical with your ideals
in your own erotic coma
will love leave you trembling alone in your bed
caressed by your skin and your body
scared of the lights of future sunsets
regretting you ever had memory?

will love turn your shyness into verbal disgrace
unable to lie or invent
as pride equals pain, you harden your face
your lips never spoke what they meant
will love paint your eyes red
consuming their faces
hoping they would understand
you watch as they're fading into different places
still wishing you were one of them?
