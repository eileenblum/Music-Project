Your love is drowning me
Your love is strangling me
Deny my right to breathe
Deny me my feeble existence

I despise your love
I despise your strokes of tenderness

Pity love
Salute the lack of emotion

And let me feel the chains
I can feel the chains pour down

Pity love
Salute lack of emotion
