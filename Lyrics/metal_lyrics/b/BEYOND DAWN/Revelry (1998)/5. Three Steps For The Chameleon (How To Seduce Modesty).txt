I'm clean trust me
I'm overwhelmed by your radiance
please save me

come let me hear you say
we kissed on the first of may

strong, i'm strong
I'm the strongest there is
I'll never miss a heartbeat
I'll never waste a kiss

don't try to denay 
you raped me on the first of july

use me, just use me 
feed me, I'm greedy
abandon me, never leave me

please remember 
you drowned me on the first september
