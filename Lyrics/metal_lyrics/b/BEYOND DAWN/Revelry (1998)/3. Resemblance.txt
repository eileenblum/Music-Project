now i don't love you
i just want your to feel like I was always there
like the bliss of what you want the most
i'm not your friend, i'm merely a ghost
when magic has entered your veins
i'll swim in your blood
and when you feel like a queen
i'll sleep in the mud
with the taste of your lips deceiving my brain,
like all that's beautiful, like all that's insane

now i'm drifting helpless
through cold bright pictures
in a deep brown river
through talking insects
and they sting
their faces are kind
ignorance enthusiasm
side by side

and i know you're somewhere inside this open wound
i want to hurt you now, will i see you soon?

now i'm drifting helpless
through cold bright pictures
in a deep brown river
through talking insects
and the sting
yeah they sting
their faces are kind
ignorance, enthusiasm
side by side
