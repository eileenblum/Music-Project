now as the evening steals the sun
i claim the air inside your lungs
and you have killed your heart in vain
now i'm your freedom, i'm insane
your selfish beauty wants to live
into this ocean, you won't breathe here
a homesick child with leaking eyes
where's the sun? am i blind?
it's growing deep between your thighs
it's so meaningless and its mine

sweet, sweet, sweet
buried in your bloody conscience so deep

the mild unconsciousness of time
left the future behind 
it pushed our luck into the ground
with the memories and the sounds
of screaming children kept in shrines
like our love and love is blind
it slipped our hands, but it got stuck in our minds

sweet, sweet relief
buried in your bloody conscience so deep
