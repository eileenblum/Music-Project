welcome to clarity
this is your mind speaking
regret we ever met
i'm here i will let you forget
you bore me like dignity
so this is your love leaking
like the blood of a dying dream
through the holes of an empty sea

remember the taste in your mouth
when you swallowed your only wishes
and remember the beautiful world
that always denied your kisses
and the frightening freedom to change
that i sheltered you from in my cold lonely hands
they embraced your drunken body at night
and you wonder killed your plans

now i am a drug
but you may pretend
that your eyes are clear and your senses are true
and your mind is a faithful friend
