It's about time you caught up with me
Or should I say I caught up with you
Anyway it was inevitable
Love's sweet aroma leaves quite a trace
Too bad it doesn't last
It never has, it never will
It just can't last
Damn (why can't it last?)

Step down
Let my hollowness embrace you
Step down
And my emptiness corrupt you

Do I ever get lonely?
There's only one of us left now
What do you think?
Of course there's always old Mr. Hate
Not too much company in him after the apocalypse
Too bad "travel" is not part of my vocalbulary

Step down
Let my hollowness embrace you
Step down
And my emptiness corrupt you
