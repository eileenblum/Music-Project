Ten thousand bodies entangled in a strange room
A formless struggle leaves a question of demise
And as a handful of lies is a weapon
As dignity confused with pride

Tie me up and let the dogs in

This kind of sympathy attracts me no longer
This kind of tenderness suits me no more
Designed to harvest, I feed on tamed warmth
Constructed envy, I've adapted a cold

Tie me up and let the dogs in
