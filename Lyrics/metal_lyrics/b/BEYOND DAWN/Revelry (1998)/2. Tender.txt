First, let's start with a catastrophy
A deceiving yet gentle disharmony
When silence turns into an odyssey
A hazardous flight through anatomy
And the listener starts thinking
"Is this where I want to be
Is not this music luring and pulling me
Deep down into a space where I have no ability
To withstand unconsciousness and futility"

It makes him feel oh so tender
It makes him feel oh so soft
It makes him curl up inside
And spend all the love that he never got

Second, when we are done with the cowardly
Who evidently had no shred of dignity
We start with the naked and foolhardy
And force him to utter addictively
"Why is my God lying and cheating me?
Is there no end to this forcefed hypocrisy?
Is it I or he who has got the best of me?
That is served with this religious monogamy"

It makes him feel oh so tender
It maked him feel oh so soft
It makes him curl up inside
And spend all the love he never got

(This is how the slightest disharmony turns into a lucid disharmony)
