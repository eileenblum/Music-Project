I saw you naked a December morning
The earth was trembling and the stars were falling
Tall, slim and slender, you slunk towards me
A sight for the whole world but me to see
The flames that once consumed me are dying
As you said "I love you", I knew you were lying

Under the cross a beggar is lying
Barefoot on the ground and he is crying
"Flee from me God, you're no longer with me
Release me from my role as one convicted"
The flames that once consumed me are dying
As you said you loved me, I knew you were lying

In the field, the peasant is kneeling
Hands and feet on the ground and he is screaming
"I've worked this soil yet it's betrayed me
That's the price I pay for loyalty"
The flames that once consumed me are dying
As I said "I love you" I knew I was lying
