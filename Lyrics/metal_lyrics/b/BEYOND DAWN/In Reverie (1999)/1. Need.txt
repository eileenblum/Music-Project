No need to feel
No need to be
No need to be down here in this corporal sea
No need to comprehend
Adapt or pretend
No envy nor distrust
In the end - lust

This is sex without touching
This is love without speech
This is where the angels in exile
Like you and I, meet

Give it up and give in
This is love, this is sin
Give it up and give in
This is love, this is sin

This is love and I'm infected
You're the drug that I've had injected

Give it up and give in
This is love, this is sin
Give it up and give in
This is love, this is sin
