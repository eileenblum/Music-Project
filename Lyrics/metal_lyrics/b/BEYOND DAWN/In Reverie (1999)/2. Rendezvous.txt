Like a rendezvous with a long lost friend
Who had finally shown his face again
Warmly, it welcomed the rest
When its last faint grasp at life
Had resounded in a peaceful sigh

Its eyes had been gone for hours
Not granting them any goodbyes
Its eyes - not granting them any goodbyes

Like a rendezvous with a long gone friend
Whom it finally caught up with again
It had no sympathy for their pain

Its eyes had been gone for hours
Not granting them any goodbyes
Its eyes - not granting them any goodbyes
