Honoured crowd
Excellent taste
Will sleeping beside you allow me to rest
Upon the surface of my disgrace
I'm completely closed to all kinds of suggestions
But I dream of you asking me questions
Yes, I would like to die
Should I have other wishes
I should kill all the friends
I answer with honest kisses

Thank you for not speaking
Loud and clearly to me
Thanks for not fooling around with your eyes
Not reminding me
How I will turn insane
How possible it will be
I'll starve on the ground
I'll drown in the sea

I'm dying, my friends
As confident as hell
I'm dying, my friends
As confident as hell

Yes, I should change
If I could, I would change
Into a charming, youthful disaster
I'd force my needful body upon you
And blind our thoughs with laughter
I saw you below me
In a dream or a movie
Embracing my face with your hands
Talking, clever, about love
And how much courage that demands
Yeah
