My apathy knows no end
One touch makes a world of difference
Don't start a flood
Ever so fragile - I'm deeply touched

Envision my void
Figure the searing emptiness
Rascals rage with innocence
Ever so focused - I'm deeply touched

The corrupted smiles
The laughing lies
The embryo of hatred so sweet
Captured deep beneath
Ever so humorous - I'm deeply touched
