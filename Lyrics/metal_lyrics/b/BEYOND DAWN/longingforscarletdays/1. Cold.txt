Morning frost came early
Creeping out of the night
Bitter is the road to forgiveness
This room needs no clock
Standing on my bare feet
In a circle of pain
With the untold truth
Resting at my shoulders
Doves are bleeding for me
Aeons since I shed a tear
Where are you now
My host of lament
Where are you now?
