Arena of kings
Playground of wargods
I kiss the dust
And those who give their lives
Shall never be lost
Chaosphere
Wheel of being
Throwing your daggers at us
Making our time miserable
I raise a toast
For I will be its ruler
I will be their king
I will be your humble servant
The ringer of armageddon
They'll hear my tolls
