Bleak, it's bleak
And bleaker it will be
The first
Sunbeams of the newborn day
Splintered my sleep
Made it all come back to me
It's all the sun's fault
I started to imagine
What it would be like
If one day the sun did not rise
Would I wake up or
Would I stay safe in my sleep
Safe from all my days to come
And all my days that were
Would they stay asleep too?
Then came the dreaming
Black... it's black...
And blacker it will be...
