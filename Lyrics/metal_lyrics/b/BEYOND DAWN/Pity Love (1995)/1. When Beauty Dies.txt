In A Cold Room, Nothing Breathes
No Light Can Reach
When Beauty Dies
In A Dead Field, Nothing Grows
No Life Can Be Sown
When Beauty Dies
In My Heart, No Love Is For Real
Where No Grief Can Be Healed
When beauty dies...
Dies...
When beauty dies...
In a dead field
Nothing grows [nothing grows],
No life can be sown [can be sown]...
In a dead field
Nothing grows [nothing grows],
No life can be sown [can be sown]...
When beauty dies...
Dies...
When beauty dies...
In my life,
No light is for me in my life,
No light is for me...
In my life,
No light is for me in life,
No light is for me...
