Paint Me
Lift Me From These Pagan Shores
I've Kissed My Saint
Embraced
The Tears Of A Lesser God
O' Allfather
Why Am I Caught
In The Eye Of A Storm?
Why Can't I See Myself
As I Used To Be?
Daughter Dreary Sunday
Haven't You Always Been Stepping
Over The Ghost
Of Yesterday's Trials?
Eaten Anyone
Of Your Own Size
Foe, Saviour
I Saw You At The Coven
Dancing Around Your Swastika
Now I Sense, Now I'm One
