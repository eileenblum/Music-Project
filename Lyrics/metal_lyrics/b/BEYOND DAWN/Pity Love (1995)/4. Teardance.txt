Embrace My Skin
Blend With My Sweat
Purify My Heart
Let Me Boil
You Smelled So Good When You Fell
And Drained Me Of My Thirst
Heaven Is Weeping For Me
Weeping
Pain Had Not Left Me
Still Stuck Like A Bolt
Nailed Right Through My Heart
Pain
Make It Rust
Make It Flow
Make It Wash Away
You Still Smell So Good And Fresh
LIke A New Skin
And I'm Not Thirsty Anymore
Heaven Wept For Me
