And I Watch The Birds
Even Though They Don't
Sing For Me
I Just Like To Watch
They're Flying Again
Like The Ghost Of Something
That Never Was
I'm Lying Again
Pearl On My Cheek
And Another
Salt, Not Sweet
The Taste Of My Longing
To Be Haunting, Not The Haunted
In An Eyewink I'll Be Gone
At Once
When They Unlock The Cage
Isn't It A Pity That I Have The Key
And I Say The Words
Even Though They Don't
Sing For Me
