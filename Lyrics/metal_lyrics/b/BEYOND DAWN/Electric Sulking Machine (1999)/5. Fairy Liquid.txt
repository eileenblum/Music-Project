What a cruel sensation 
To feel the shape of bones beneath your aging skin 
Your naked emotion 
Meets with the fear -now will you give in? 
You may hold your life 
In these fleshless hands -there may not be more 
What a wrong decision 
To dig into the nature of what you adore

And there is sweetness in the thoughts familiar 
In any book of any capable dreamer lying buried below 
There is beauty in the feeble killer 
Inside the drugs that make you shiver, tender, out of nothing at all 
You may fool your mind 
All of the time -now will you ignore 
This cruel sensation 
And all those shameful years 
'Cause there will be more

You are choking and it's serious 
Well you can't see it's delirious
