Out of the tunnel comes the train 
Into the bright light of the day 
Into the overwhelming sun 
Into the staring eyes of anyone 
TheyÂ´ll never leave you alone 

And the sand on the pavement you walk 
Are like rocks inside your shoes 
And the people like door frames 
As you enter their rooms 
Something supernatural 
Always likely to occur 
When all the lights are out 
And nothing really hurts 

And all of these derailments 
Deform their point of view 
They are all wonders to the eye 
They won't become distant to you 
Open or closed 
YouÂ´ll swim in deep pacific blue disorder 
Yeah, it's a wonderful drug
