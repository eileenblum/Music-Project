My self confidence has resigned 
Now I walk with indifference 
With my will and my fear 
Following me from a distance 
So presence please 
Make love to me 
Clean my head with nonsense 
You are a whore that I can afford 
Nobody wants my conscience

If I cannot open to what I love 
Then will it be gone, along with the sun 
That shines just slightly 
Upon anything I hope for 
I'm alone where dreams are born 
Where my eyelids hide your picture from the sun 
This stupid dolled up longing 
That I cough up every morning 

This is my skin you see 
Stretched all over me 
Tightened around so perfectly 
Exposed to other peoples eyes, 
Safety-pins, razorblades and knives
