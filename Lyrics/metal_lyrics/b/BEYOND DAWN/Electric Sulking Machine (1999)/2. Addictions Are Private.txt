Am I being loved 
By under-estimating fools 
With a certain distaste 
For progression and the new 
Like the negative photograph 
You see when you close your eyes 
Slips away in a moment or two 
You don't get me, do you? 

I didn't really put myself out 
But I fulfilled my expectations 
Perhaps it didn't feel so grand 
Neither was it so convincing 
In dreams I've seen all of these things 
Now it seems as if I was awake 
And they were human beings

Changing by the hour 
While I stayed here all day 

Now there's just a few 
That makes any sense 
Of all these objects viewed 
Through the palm of my hand 
To leave this room 
Means going straight 
Out of fiction and into the great 
Sentimental truth

Singing little clichÃ©s 
Though I am not in love 
Failing to define 
What I'm thinking of 
Dreaming that I speak of 
Things I cannot say 
Hiding in my pockets 
Well, all addictions are private anyway
