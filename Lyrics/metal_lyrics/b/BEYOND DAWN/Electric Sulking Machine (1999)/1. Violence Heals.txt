Are you breathin' 
Right here under my nose 
The air has turned so pungent 
Like being inside the restless cars 
Or the bodies they pick from the pavement 
And I shudder, I am sickened 
By my presence like a narrow-mind routine 
As I'm trying to disappear 
Into a self-supporting cloud of nicotine

Here is the scene 
Where infinite beings 
Must rely on his hands and knees 

As night turns the shape 
Of the creatures obscene 
I really do hate their existance 
Surpassing themselves in the ugliest ways 
Like a crowd that won't keep the distance 
I am sinking, I am lowered 
Into a pool that isn't water, is it dear? 
But violence heals 
The wildest deceits 
Of a mind that's forgotten its human
