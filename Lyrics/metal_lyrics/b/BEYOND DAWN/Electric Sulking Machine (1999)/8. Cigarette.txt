There's a cold, constant neon flicker 
Filled with an odour of decline and sour liqour 
Where bodies intertwine and spirits linger 
I suck the blood of a left hand finger 
And with it I release my self-esteem 
A reason to redeem 
I'm a failure - I'm unclean

There's not an action I regret 
I light another cigarette

And through the smoke, I feel the scent 
Of something far beyond an incident 
A lecture for the trivial 
Artistic, not theatrical 
And she moves just like an erotic cabarÃ©t 
Leaving the lust for both happiness and dismay 
The softest lips, gold gracious fingertips 
As she moves, I watch her hips 
This is chaos, this is karma 
Coming down into a drama 

This is what I feed on - I won't forget 
I light another cigarette 

We inhale the honey gently 
Planning a smooth and thoughtful re-entry 
A first world war documentary 
With a touch of the twentyfirst century 
Two calculative wannabes 
Running dry on energy 
With poison floating through their veins 
Superficial intolerance 
Four blurred eyes taken leave of sense 
Intoxicated, in pains 
Confronting, colliding, exploding 
As if our lives would end this very day 
With lethal words that sting and say 
I've seen it all 
I'll take anything, come what may 
Given the world into my hands 
There's something I wouldn't miss 
The fruit of an evening like this 
The reuniting kiss 

Take aim, fire - this is what you get 
We light another cigarette
