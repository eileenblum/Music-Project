Certain qualities are required 
To make you feel concluded when you fall 
You may find yourself with all your clothes off 
Standing three feet above them all 
The flames will be up to your neck like problems 
Far more concerning than the thought 
Of being someone, however not worthy 
Of anymore attention from the world 

Do you feel like those 
Who lie silent in their graves? 
Do they seem that close 
To the fertile earth behind your dreaming eyes?

Certain qualities are required 
To remember pleasure when it's gone 
You may lack the wit to see misfortune 
More entertaining than a stone 
Just like convenient crimes where noone gets hurt 
You wouldn't notice any wrong 
Inside those lines that I'm producing 
To make you feel connected to this song

Oh you bitter one, your love's labour lost 
Or was it nothing? 
Were you ever close 
To achieve the gift of understanding?
