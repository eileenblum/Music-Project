It's gonna bring me down
The posh will be friendly
And I will hardly make a sound as I fall
With guilty eyes and a foolish smile
I'm increasing the gravity
It's not like getting high
Could I just keep quiet for a wonderful minute
The air is full of snow my heart with meaning
I sing along as it melts
Upon the tongue like a taste of electricity almost gone

Everything beautiful it's just a matter of distance
Between the city lights, things have a way of leaving me out
Where in the universe lies the location that I spoke so highly about
It's recommended to lie and change the subject
Every goddamn time and avoid confrontation
I may be strong but not equipped with anything more than a stranger
Would easily remove, I know!
