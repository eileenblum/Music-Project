Sometimes I feel free enough to twist my and gets up
So comepletely well I don't know why indecision and a pair of clear blue eyes
I must admit it only looks stupid now
Unawake when it hits me with an unrealistic rush of surprise
With my open mind I'm down with species of any kind of sidewalk
On the rainsoaked pavement I leave my fear behind

Sometimes I feel free in a world of coincidence
Distant and careless unfuris around me
