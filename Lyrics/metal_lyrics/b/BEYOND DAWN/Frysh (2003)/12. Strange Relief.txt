Here I can smell the rain
And the city underneath 4 a.m.
It makes no difference to me
It's all below my feet
If desire was a reasonable friend
I would be imaging this
But Saturday has left a vaccum up here
I'm just glad I lfet

I tried to adjust to it
The violence had me erected but none the less cold
Walking up the stairway eleven floors into the appartement
And well inside another world...

However deep your empathy goes
It's hard to get carried away
By drunken confessions
I feel a strange relief knowing
I have ruined everything....
