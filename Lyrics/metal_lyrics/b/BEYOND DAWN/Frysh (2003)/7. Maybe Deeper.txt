Like I'm seventeen and the world turns hostile around me
I keep my distance but somehow I slip into their arms
And the well kept secret
Handing out compliments and stupid opinions
I loose myself

Figuring out how long I have pretended that I live here
Inside the private lives and ugly suicides
I would never bother among commercial signs and common sense
Maybe deeper I can't relate to the facts and I'm unable to act surprised
It's too familiar

Safe and sound inside of trouble deep feeling clever
There's not a thing that could wake me
You see like anyone of you people
Will be back here again to wake me when it's over
