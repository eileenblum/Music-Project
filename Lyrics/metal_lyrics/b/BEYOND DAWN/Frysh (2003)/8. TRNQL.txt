The drugs were expensive I'll stay behind they do not disappoint as I 
expected I don't need anything more. Simple amusement somewhere beside the 
point where the suns coming up and I feel good now I don't.

Pull up your defensive shield and walk around with me, meet the environment 
with silly sounds in our ears. It's hilarious when the people won't buy it I 
don't know about you.
I can control my excitement, don't say you're turning in. hold on to the 
table and we'll try again...
