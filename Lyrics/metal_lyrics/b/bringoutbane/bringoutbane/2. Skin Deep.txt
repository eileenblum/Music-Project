Do you believe in faith after all the shit youâve done?
Do you believe deep inside you canât be wrong?
I wish you would leave it, well enough alone
So sad you donât see it, the damage youâve done

But you keep running from all the fear inside your broken life
You keep running out of time

Youâre not the same one that I used to know
If I dig a little deeper, every piece I find is a bit weaker
The thing youâve become, is tearing a hole in my soul
Skin deep

Another lie would lead the way when you were blind
You burned the ones you loved and trusted deep inside
If you only could see it, how you went wrong
I wish you could feel it, now that weâre gone

But you keep running, from all the hate you've learned to know so well
You keep running out of lies

Youâre not the same one, that I used to know
If I dig a little deeper, every piece I findâs a bit weaker
The thing youâve become is tearing a hole in my soul
Skin deep

You say youâve done nothing wrong, that itâs all my fault
Trying to give you a reason, trying to wake up the demon
Have you ever seen someone, turning stone cold
Skin deep

Youâre not the same one, that I used to know
If I dig a little deeper, every piece I find is a bit weaker
The thing youâve become is tearing a hole in my soul
Skin deep

You say youâve done nothing wrong,that itâs all my fault
Trying to give you a reason, trying to wake up the demon
Have you ever seen someone, turning stone cold
Skin deep
