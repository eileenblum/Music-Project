Crawl back where you came from
You don Ìt belong here
The damage that you have done
Thereâs nothing here but fear

Run, hide yourself
Wipe that grin off your face
It will chew you up and spit you out
Consumed you Ìll be left alone to die

Son be afraid
Remember you canât always walk away
The dreams youâve made stuck in my head
While you became a sick man
Sick man

Wash all your sins away
Try to wash it clean
Get down on you knees and pray
Youâll feel obsolete and so obscene

Bad blood, is what youâve tasted
Corruption, wherever you go
It will fill you up and bleed you dry
Remember to ask yourself why

Son be afraid
Remember you canât always walk away
The dreams youâve made stuck in my head
While you became a sick man
Sick man

Son be afraid
Remember you canât always walk away
The dreams youâve made stuck in my head
While you became a sick man

Just let it go
Have faith in whatâs left and stay away
The more you Ìll burn, youâll understand
That violence doesn Ìt make a man
