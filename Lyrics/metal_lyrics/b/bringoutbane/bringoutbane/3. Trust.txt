Your lips are moving
But I canât hear the words you shout
I hear a tremble
But itâs too damn hard to make it out

Speak
Tell me what you wanna say
Listen up and shut the fuck up
Just turn around and walk away

Youâre sorry, but itâs too late now
One of the things Iâve learned
So sorry, but words ainât enough
In a world where trust is earned you will burn

Your words are poison
I flush them down just like a pill
Spoken from a narrow mind
The snake is there, but silent still

Shut up
Thereâs nothing here for you to gain
Stand up and back the fuck off
You canât take back years of pain

Youâre sorry, but itâs too late now
One of the things Iâve learned
So sorry, but words ainât enough
In a world where trust is earned you will burn

And I know this how?
You made it clear
Canât make it right, itâs too broken here
In a place where I needed you the most
Thereâs nothing left but a ghost

So sorry, but youâre in denial
Canât hear a word I say
Youâre sorry, but itâs all in your mind
Now see me walk away
