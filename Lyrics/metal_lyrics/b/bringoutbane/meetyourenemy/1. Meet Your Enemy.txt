Drop the shit
All you do is minimize
Your words are spit
Fear turning into denial

Iâm finding out your weakness

Hey!
You condescending fuck
Always falsify
Your lies are stuck
Your lifeâs one big fucking lie

Iâm riding out your sickness

If this is how you define bravery
Now deal with my ascendance
You thought you could get away with it
Now meet your enemy

The doors are shut
Now try and run for cover
Hey! Is that all that youâve got?
Now see what I truly covet

Leaving me relentless

If this is how you define bravery
Now deal with my ascendance
You wonÂ´t win it, thereâs no way when Iâm in it
Youâre terrified, solitude means slavery
The fear of itâs insanity
You thought you could get away with it
Now meet your enemy

If this is how you define bravery
Now deal with my ascendance
You wonât quit it, time for you to relive it
Youâre terrified, solitude means slavery
The fear of itâs insanity
Youâre gonna be here alone with it
Now meet your enemy
