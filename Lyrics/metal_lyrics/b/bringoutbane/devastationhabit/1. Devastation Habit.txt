Swing away, you know thereâs nothing left to say
DonÂ´t pull away, I know youâve waited so hard for it

I wonât bow down to the fiend
This piece of filth in front of me
Dance with the devil and you will see

I believe it when I see it
I wonât hesitate cause Iâm not afraid
Get ready, believe it
Thatâs the price of my devastation habit

You think youâre one of a kind, think again
Nothing here for you to find, but a world of pain

I wonÂ´t treat you differently
Than what youâre throwing back at me
Get in the ring and Iâll make you feel

I believe it when I see it
I wonât hesitate cause Iâm not afraid
Get ready, believe it
The dangerous part about me

All your faith, you will need it
Cause I will see it through to the end
Risk it all just to feel it
Thatâs the price of my devastation habit

Swing
I dare you to
Swing
