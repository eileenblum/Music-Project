Four libertines beneath chandeliers
Sanctimonious is their impression
True nature unveiled when they speak
Linking futures
Underfoot; the will of free man
No one impedes them, spun beneath temples of sand
Laws to govern suffering
Any semblance of innocence driven out
In time, these pedophilic crimes reform
In time, more violent fetishes push forth
Winter months uncoil the depths of this decay
Ushered by cruel hands
Now forming a creature
Their forms distorted and blurred
It descends; donning costume
Serpentine body omnipresent throughout the estate
In this manner, they can watch from behind one face
