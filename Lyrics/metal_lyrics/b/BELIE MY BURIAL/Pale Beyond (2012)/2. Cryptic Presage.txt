Consciousness can't reveal his presence
Downturned eyes; trapped, hesitant
He's lost himself again
Tranquility remains, subtle feelings receding
Now the rituals grow fervent
No sign of a god above
Trapped in all that's quiet
This, his practice; nurtured by absence
Doubt upon his mind
Voyeuristic practice employed with zeal
She's lost herself
Subjects change each day through misfortune of fate
Following; sowing a spectre of doubt for their thoughts to berate
