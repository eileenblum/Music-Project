As darkness swirled, fell dead into the night
Left us all asleep; a spoiled dream tangles us all
A funeral to bury the world over and over again
A lifeless cycle suspended in gold

Awake; I feel my heartbeat no longer
Replaced by all these gears; I've grown colder
Awake; my heart beats no longer

Abandonment; as the streets narrow with cancer
Dark legacy contorting all of our answers
It outlasts, all our pasts and our futures

How our fortitude dies
Reported on and synthesized

Setting the dying sun
A sinking light of our failures
For all to come undone
There's nothing left here to savor

Abandonment; as the streets narrow with cancer
Dark legacy contorting all of our answers
