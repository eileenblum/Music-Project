Through tired eyes, these years take yours and mine
As all my wasted time birthed a war inside
Destroy the lines, leave no place to hide
Cross out the days
Dissolving into memories
To race against unhappiness
This isolation turning over in my heart
It's only blindness that keeps us apart and alone
Sadness waits in the shell of our futures
To move inside the end
Through dust and dirt, I've held my breath
Carried in a current
In my own head
Cursed by the shades that have promised unrest
As my hands reach for all that is left
Swallowed in the mouth of the sun
And held captive by absence
Fevered in the silence that grows underground
As waters rose and left me to drown
Withering; a seemless decent
Held captive by absence
