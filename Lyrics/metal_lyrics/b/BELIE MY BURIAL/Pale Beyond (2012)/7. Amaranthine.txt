With borrowed lives, the space inside magnifies
A paragon, a deft disguise, hemic mind
Borrowed the space inside
A paragon, hemic mind
Curtains drawn form a wall of deceit
Memories incomplete
Assumptions bred in a jealous dream
Collapsing through the beyond
Forced to recall; white noise obscures the faces
Obscures the places
As guilt takes hold, assembled over time
Glowing lights
Bodies transposed; divine
Just for a moment before it all dissolves
Repeated lines, alone
Mortified to rewind this time
Repeated lines, alone
Mortified to return home
