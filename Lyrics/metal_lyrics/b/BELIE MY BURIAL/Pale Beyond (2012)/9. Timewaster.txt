Sanctioned from a world that inbreeds denial
Turning over the hourglass
They walk the streets alone; dissolve into unknown
A shapeless growth of what I have to show
An endless bind; defile as we define
The ground to shelter our end-time
Trapped under night, I feel nothing
We're ashamed of what we've been put through
We fade through our skin to feel something
Left in vain of what this has led to
I can't forget the faces human no longer
As moments kept; and turned the emptiness over
As doubt finds faith strangled in cold grasp
The attempt to recreate darkness at last
Here we're left searching; trapped under night
Fade to feel something, with darkness left inside
