So bleak a winter beckons us to take arms
Now we are only few
These walls bear witness to our boundless despair
As we contrive our stand
Torn away from all we knew
With every morning stolen away
Our waking moments filled with misery
The dread is more profound each passing day
The oppressors have their price to pay
If death be close at hand
For each other, we'll rise on splintered legs and move asunder
I've forgotten everything I said
Their shadows stifle my thoughts
All I see is all what we have lost
We stand lifeless in our skin
For every body they stole, despseration grows
I'll never hear her voice again
There is no love inside this place I see
A place to disregard our memories
