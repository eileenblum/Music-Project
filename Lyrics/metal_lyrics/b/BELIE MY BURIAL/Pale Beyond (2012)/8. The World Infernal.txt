Weeks stand still in time for all their eyes to see
Their vile, abhorrent light gleams upon humanity
Sacrifice succeeding debasement
Incitement of the world infernal
Flesh transfixed by glacial knives
The sun was robbed from their eyes
Swallowed up en masse
Horrors their words conveyed echo far beyond; forever
