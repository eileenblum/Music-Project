The earth is a compost of human decay,
Dark conceals identity behind their cries of pain,
Oh; there be the riders,
Legions seek to kill all the non-believers,
We are the walking dead,
No direction,
No escape,
Doomed to repeat our empty days,
No answers,
Constant rebirth,
Dark one disguised,
Legion of followers to war another time,
This is the last of days,
This is the end,
Exodus for the wise,
It's long past time,
Start an exodus for the wise,
It's long past time, stillborn hopes,
Aborted lives,
Liberty is silenced by our own kind,
Human shit is all that's left,
Our future teeters on a precipice this time,
A war for their Christ and country to be intertwined,
Human winter is for all seasons,
We must live with our diseases,
Bow your head before corruption,
Your lord, your savior; an assumption,
Together; we dig the graves that will bury this hope,
We are the slaves that have died by this rope
