Light will pass through me
Returning object of my pain
Blue light sent
Shine upon
I invest presence
Falling down
Relapse
Left in ashes
Burning

Broken at last
In my dreams too late
Realign
All returns to shape
I drown in the end
No substance
Lower my eyes
No more open doors
Shallow reminder
Your prison
I saw the world separate to show
Inhumane
My oath
Night forms a circle now

I shed my skin
To rid myself of truth
It leaves me incomplete
I can't gain control

Son of lies
I pray soon arise
Until its dawn
I hide in wasted time

Lay me down on a bed of swords
Lay me down
Drown

Lay me down on a bed of swords
Let me feel this pain no more
Son of lies
I pray soon arise
Until its dawn
I hide in wasted time

Tomorrow it returns
I will be waiting
Cloaked by hollow winter
Eye for eye
Masking my true void

I drown in the end
And I see myself above this
