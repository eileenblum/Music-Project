A mourning ring
Left in regard of one unnamed
Still I dismiss
Bound by common hands
I will be led to a vision of suffering
Unsolved regret

I cast a stone
No thought where it would come to rest
So sick to death
Of living on a borrowed breath

In time
The masonry will be aligned
A monument
To all my crimes

Drink from the flood
Enshroud the sun
I can't outrun
What's come undone

Desperate struggle for breath
Slowly fading breath
Diffraction grating in my sight
Slowly fading
Death
