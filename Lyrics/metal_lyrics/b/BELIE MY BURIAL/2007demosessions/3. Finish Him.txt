white lights have turned to red
I am what has been bled
we are the children of the bowels
I have seen mountains
and watched them all fall
we look back to what we have lost
and i don't see what i ever had
falling under
under fate
we are the children of the bowels
i have seen mountains
and watched them fall
white lights have turned to red
i am what has been bled
what has been bled
