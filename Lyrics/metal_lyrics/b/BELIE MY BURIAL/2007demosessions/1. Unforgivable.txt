i had tried to hold onto your severed lies
foolish ghosts, mouth to mouth
has fought for second life
but my hands
will not be tied
you will stay awake tonight
all the time never knowing
thou, you art a villain
staring at you
watching you turn to putrid flies
i never questioned what I am
we have become our own
castles and thieving rats
not around our hearts
and i will carry you broken words,
sneering kings raping virgins
but you hollowed out your eyes
honor, no color can signify your lies
suicide is a jealous act
to betray your former kind
i cant wait for the day
til i see you fucking die.
