I am sick of watching this pointless masquerade unfold before me
for years, for centuries
the menacing machines have churned out thoughtless believers,
drones whose purpose is to sow
the seeds of hate, intolerance, exclusion, delusion
where did history go wrong?
this iron gate you guard
religious imagery abound
will fall to the thoughtful
renounce this golden cow
deception, detention, segregation
by ignorant souls
time to face the fucking facts
read between the lines
the book you've based your life upon
is nothing but a fucking lie
I see through you
force fed lies
regurgitate, purge
and at the end of the day
when all is said and done
did your selfish prayers help anyone?
no faith lies within lies
