Consummatum est! The weight of long years is upon us now
The entirety of ages but a falling

Dreadful compression, inevitable pull of the abyss
A singularity of pain and anguish

The mouth of Hell!

The age of wrath is upon us!
Who will withstand the fires of the judgement?

The age of wrath is upon us!
Who will withstand the fires of the judgement?
An aeon of wrath is upon us!
Who will withstand the fires of the pain?

What hope for desiccate husks? A sea of moldering bones and ashes
As dry dust are we become, yet as tinder awaits the flame!

An aeon of wrath is upon us!
Who will withstand the fires of the judgement?
The age of wrath is upon us!
Who will withstand the fires of the pain?

Gnashing teeth of Hell, grinding all to residuum
The tower is broken, we fall headlong into desolate depths

"Term of all that liveth, whose name is Death and inscrutable, be thou favourable unto us in thine hour"
"Term of all that liveth, whose name is Death and inscrutable, be thou favourable unto us in thine hour"
"Term of all that liveth, whose name is Death and inscrutable, be thou favourable unto us in thine hour"

"Then arose the Great Dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and the garden was made desolate"
"This is Leviathan, the crooked serpent"

"This is Leviathan, the crooked serpent"

A holocaust from on high, flaming triad descending... flaming triad descending...

"He bowed the heavens and came down and the darkness was under His feet
He hurled forth his lightnings and destroyed them"

"Before Him went the pestilence and flaming fire went forth at His feet"

Consummatum est!
Presentiment of dawning dread, pandemic revelation

For the world shall end in conflagration!

Consummatum est!

Shadow of the Sun! Seat of the avenging one!
High priest of the Silent Temple of Death!
Glory of the Sun! Sword of the avenging one!
Guardian against the multitudes that sleep through the light
Amidst the flames, a dreadful wail, in myriad tongues resounding, yet...
The smoke is rising, rising, rising!
