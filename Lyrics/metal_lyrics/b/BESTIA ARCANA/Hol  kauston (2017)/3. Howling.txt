Behold the dusk that swallows all
With the devouring of the Sun, harken to the baying
The clamor that is rising above all empires
For it is the howling of wrathful Gods

Blooded and glutting, hear their gospel clearly, for it is the litany of the world
Behold the dawn, Sun of Death rising, the heart of Hell

Shining perihelion of the Inferno's sum
All eyes shall upturn to be blinded by its light, as it turns all lands to shadow

Son of Death risen, to make a throne of desolation

Beneath an escutcheon of carrion wings upon locut winds, for it is the age of blood

Blood that drowns as deluge in storms unceasing, washing over all

I hear the Gods clearly, they are wanton
I hear the Gods clearly, they are feasting

I hear the Gods, I hear the Gods clearly, above the din of nations
I hear the Gods clearly, they are howling... they are howling...
