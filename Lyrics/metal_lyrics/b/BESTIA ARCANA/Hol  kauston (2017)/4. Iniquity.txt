What a glorious end we have reached that it should hold for me upon its horizon's

Storms illumined red, O' Heosphorus, and ill stars pulsing
Their bleak light shed, enclosing heaven's arch, the cosmic tomb

"Our hands are full of blood, oh Lord, our hands are full of blood"

"Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire
Your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate"

"We should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah"

"Our hands are full of blood, oh Lord, our hands are full of blood"

For we do delight in the blood of lambs
Let the devouring sword that falls from your mouth fall unto us
We would wield it against nations and like unto you, who art nemesis
We "prepare slaughter for the children, for the iniquity of their fathers"

With our breath we stoke the embers of Tophet to furious blaze
And alight this darkest night, with the offerings of your kin

"Our hands are full of blood, oh Lord, our hands are full of blood"

"Our hands are full of blood, oh Lord"

They are all sick with madness like unto Babel
Their words hath become confounded like unto Babel

The tower is crashing down and within its ruins they will name us devils as we garb ourselves in demon skins
We must become as asuras, by needs we must be as titans

We must uphold the Sun

Black with wrath, as it burns this world to cinders, a thousand swords our crown
We must uphold the Sun, black with wrath, as it burns this world to cinders, a thousand swords our crown

"Our hands are full of blood, oh Lord, our hands are full of blood"

"Our hands are full of blood, oh Lord, our hands are full of blood"

For we do delight in the blood of lambs
Let the devouring sword that falls from your mouth fall unto us

"Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire
Your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate"
