O, bleak stars of revelation shine!
A dread name given to these dread signs
We align our hearts within the darkest node
Resplendent with the rays of Death's abode, crown of the dark face of God

Neigh traced to completion through the black ogdoad
Masks of discord, despair and fear

Whom art your word, your lightning spear that strikes down the ramparts of all men
Praise to He, whose hand lays upon us all, impenetrable veils through which we fall

O' Great Obscurator, your light hath darkened the world
As the ancient Drakon's coils unfurled

Falling down through aeons from the vault of heaven
To devour the Earth 'neath clarion horns of Seven

Enemy redeemer, they curse You
Enemy redeemer, to You I bow
Enemy redeemer, they curse You
Enemy redeemer, to You I bow

O, bleak stars of revelation shine!
A dread name given to these dread signs
We align our hearts within the darkest node
Resplendent with the rays of Death's abode, crown of the dark face of God

O' Great Obscurator, your light hath darkened the world
As the ancient Drakon's coils unfurled

Falling down through aeons from the vault of heaven
To devour the Earth 'neath clarion horns of Seven

Masks of discord, despair and fear
Whom art your word, your lightning spear

That strikes down the ramparts of all men, offered to seven maws with horns of ten

Praise to He, whose hand lays upon us all
