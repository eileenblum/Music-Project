I see pale Achlus within thy eyes, oh Scion of Adam, begotten of mud and mire. The clay from which ye were spawned shall swallow and keep thee, drowned in filth, a feast of sand and worms. Thou doth lie at the threshold to the gates of oblivion, in a shackled procession before the Devil's maw.
"Like lambs in his mouth shall ye be carried away as children in the breach of his windpipe," plummeted into stygian dark.
Who amongst the perfidious shall find salvation in pernicious descent? The death-fog is within thy eyes, oh sons of Adam.
