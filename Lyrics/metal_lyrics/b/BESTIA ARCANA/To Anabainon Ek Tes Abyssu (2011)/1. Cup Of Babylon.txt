Let now the fifth angel sound. Let now all men be bowed by The first woe.
I come before the skulking horror of seven maws to taste of its flesh and copulate with she who sits astride gilded behind seventy horns.
Her name is MYSTERY and Babylon and from her cup I sate my thirst.
"All Lords and Kings have I wooed with my gifts, and all in turn have glutted upon my fruit. Their seeds are mine to sow and I now give birth to abominations ten thousand fold to rend and tear the earth. It is I alone who rides the Beast and prepares this world for the coming of the rising Shadow, the ruin that wears a princely crown. Know my beauty and despair for I am the storm before the doom to come, the Harbinger of the End!"
Oh, Great Bloodied Whore, bath me in thy wine of divinity.
Pestilence, slaughter, famine, and woe!
Embrace me with the burning brilliance of the end as we welcome the ineffable Lord of Derision.
