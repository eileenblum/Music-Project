"What terror is this that now walks upon the face of the earth?"
It is he who wears a diadem of seven sabled horns and is swathed in vestments of famine and war.
It is he, whose prayer is at the baying of dogs and the wailing of whores, whose hymns are as the lamentations of lepers and the pox-plagued outcast.
It is he, whose name is as the nine-tailed scourge across the spine of the world. Lord of emaciation and fever. Angel of anxieties. Archon of onslaught. We harken unto thee and walk within they shadow. Lead us now into desolation. Lead us now unto ruin. Lead us now into the glorious radiance of perditions light.
