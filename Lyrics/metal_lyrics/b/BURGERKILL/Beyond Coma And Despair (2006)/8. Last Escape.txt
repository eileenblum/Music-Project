In this stillness, stiff and cold
Drowning into the hole, pale face got last resort
Goodbye ..

All your hope left, by your soul flying
I'll pray for you ...
For the last time, I want to see you again my friend
Now you're in eternal life, now you're in eternal life
Rotting away ..

You passed away, in a prophet ways
With the needle in your hand,
Agony injected .. With no regret
Worthless piece of life, drag you down to last escape !

Bitter taste of pain, within your desperate
You're gone forever, Goodbye ..
