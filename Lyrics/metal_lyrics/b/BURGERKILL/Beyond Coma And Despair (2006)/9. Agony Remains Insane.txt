Let me healing cure for madness
I'll reborn, I'll reborn..
Incarnated holy sin
buttfucked all sinners
Revealed the disease, spreading the hatred..

Agony Remain Insane..

Worthless life terrorized
I'm a weak and have no gut
Remain insane..

Get it lost...Get it lost!
Too scare to hear you.. I lost
Withers in my autumn soul.

Shattered faith.. Scattered brain.. Lost!

I can't feel my wrath anymore, I'm stuck in my autumn soul..
Stuck in my autumn soul!
