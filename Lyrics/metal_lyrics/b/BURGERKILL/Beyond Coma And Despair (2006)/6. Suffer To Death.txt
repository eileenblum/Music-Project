Let me breathing..
I got no cash, I got no place to stay
What a worthless life?
I got no plan, I got no future yet
Everything just same old bullshit

Why I can't stop to complaining this way?
Why I cannot stand..
Make me suffer to death
Make me lost my mind.. Why?
Why I cannot stand?

Nothing new and nothing change
I got no pride to live my life
I need more space to change my destiny
Everything so dark...Unpredictable...

I need friend to sharing
For these so much pain
All the faith despair..
I need friend to heal,
For this so much hurt
I cant through this hell..
I cant through this hell..
