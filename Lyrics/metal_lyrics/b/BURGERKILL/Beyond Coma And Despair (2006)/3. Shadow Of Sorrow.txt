Today my heart is dying
No more feeling, just a fucking thing..
Bitter taste of desperate..

Reject, disappoint is the word
For many excuses
I've lost in my own faith..

Sold my heart to nothingness
Broken faith I cannot fix
My heart is dying...

Give me one last breath
To prove myself right

Shadow Of Sorrow..
Just A fucking thing,
Kill Me !

Give me one last breath
To prove myself right
Give me one last breath
To live my way, To live my hate..

Shadow Of Sorrow..
Dying..
