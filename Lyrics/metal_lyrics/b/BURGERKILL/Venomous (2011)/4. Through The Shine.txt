No One Heard Me
No Compassion And No One Cared
There's No Fucking Page To Draw My Words
My Sins Keep Haunting My World

I Held A Gun So Close To My Hearrt
Like A Foolish Child I Sat And Cried
Didn't Realized What You Have Done
Tears Mixed With Blood, Falling Slowly To The Ground
Face My Past... And Crap My Regret
This Goddamn Black That I Cannot Take
This Black That You Cannot Take

Now! Walking Through The Shine From Restraint
I'm Not The Only One Who Screaming Aloud

Now My Turn To Gain What I Have Lost
Just To Prove What Kind Of Words I've Had
I Will Take This Fucking Pain

Can't You See My Hate?
Can't You Face My Fate?

Now! Walking Through The Shine From Restraint
I'm Not The Only One Who Screaming Aloud

Now! Walking Through The Shine From Restraint
I'm Not The Only One Who Screaming Aloud

Everlasting
Starring Through The Light And Revenge
