Youâre The House Of Greed
Fake Smiles Surround Me All Day
Selfish Lies Youâre Set Out To Prove
Now You Pretend To Care
You Pretend To Feel What I Feel
The Whole Things Just A Pack Of Lies
This Constant Bullshit Overloading
Fuck Your Selfishness! Fuck Your Greed!

Your Time Seems To Be Wasted
No One Will Trust You... No One Will Pick You Up
You Have No Shame! You Have No Shame!
Anger, Hatred, The More I See The More I Hate
In This Raging War...

You Offered The Truth
Youâre Acting 
Like Iâm A Deaf And Blind
You Just Care About Your Self
What Do You Expect From Me?
Iâm Not Your Fucking Path To Choose
You Canât Change Me, 
You Never Dare

How Hard Youâll Try To Broke My Faith 
And Seize My Soul

Iâll Never Give It, 
Donât You Ever Try It
As I Close My Eyes, 
I Can See It Now
Thereâs No One Will Follow You Down

My Heart Bleeds A Thousand Times
I Will Not Let You Take Our Blood
I Will Destroy 
Anything Youâve Got

Too Much Crap And Bad Drama 
That We See From Your Side
My Blood, 
My Flesh, 

My Dignity Give Me Strength To Force You Out
Youâre The House Of Greed, 
Fuck You!

Aarrrrgghhhh
Fuck Off!

How Hard Youâll Try To Broke My Faith 
And Seize My Soul

Iâll Never Give It, 
Donât You Ever Try It
As I Close My Eyes, 
I Can See It Now
Thereâs No One Will Follow You Down

Youâre The House Of Greed
