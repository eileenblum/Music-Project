Hey You! Yeah You Motherfucker!
Listen To Me.. I Won't Be A Part Of You've
Created
I Owe You Nothing!
There's Too Much Cracked White Frames
These Days
... In The Name Of Religion With Disgusting
Ways
Violence Is Your Best Part To Destroy The
Opponent
Determining Who's Good Or Bad, Like The
Holy Man
And Deciding Who's Gonna Live Or Die 

Our Days Are Getting Shorter
I'm Afraid The Worst Will Crush Us
I Watch My World Crumbling Down
All I See Is Damnation, This Is An Absolute
Horror
Who The Hell Are You
I Won't Live In The World That You Have
Created
I'm The Beast That You Fear The Most
I'll Kick You Down. I'll Choke You Down
'Till Your Heart Stops Beating
I'm Proud Watching You Fall
And I'm Proud Watching You Bleed
Until Your Heart Stops Beating 

I'm Proud Watching You Fall
And I'm Proud Watching You Bleed
Until Your Heart Stops Beating
You Can't Stop Me. You're Playing God!
I Will Shake Your Hand With My Bloody
Fist
And Justice Means Nothing Today
It's Faded By Lack Of Tolerance
Through My Eyes I've Seen The Lies
Nothing Has Changed Cause Nothing Was
Done
I'm Your Foe... The Fearless Foe 

I Know The Roots And I Know The Truth
This Is Not The End!
You Think You Can Control Me
There's Nothing You Can Do To Stop Me
You Are Not My Enemy. But My Fucking
Worst Enemy!
