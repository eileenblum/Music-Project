Everything turns so disgust when I stayed at home
No more shelter or anything called salvation
Away from home prove I'm the real scumbag
So I begin to hate arrogant people around me

Cross the line.. Revolt !
It's time to.. Revolt !

They ruin my confidence be contemptuous of my way
So I try to find my real behaviour in my inner-self
Act like chatty boy it's gonna be over
The way I chose is the way you lose
Reaching for something out of sight make me feel so thick
There's nothing better in my life lost everything I ever had
