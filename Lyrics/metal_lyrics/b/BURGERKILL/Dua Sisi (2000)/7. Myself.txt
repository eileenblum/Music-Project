Can't explain my feeling don't know right words to say
So I'll do what's right for me although it's wrong
Confuse.. confuse, feel like something in me died
That's enough for me no needs to explain

Nothing be my confident.. Hurt!

Hatred.. Hatred, feel like everything burn
Broken.. Broken, scattered around the gutter

I feel so guilty of being me
I feel so waste of being me
Dissapoint!
