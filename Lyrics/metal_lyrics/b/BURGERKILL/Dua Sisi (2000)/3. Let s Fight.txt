Everybody says we're always wrong
But I believe we much strong
Take every spirit inside our heart
Against everything that we had

This is our fight to survive
This is our fight and no one's right

Now it's the time that's right
Cause we know we have to fight
Fight forever don't ever waste
Stop all those fuckin' hate

Get the light and we'll be free
In this fight and we'll see
Get a light our lesson learnt
In this fight our fingers burn
