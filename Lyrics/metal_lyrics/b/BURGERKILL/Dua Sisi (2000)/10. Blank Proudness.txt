Let the ocean dissolves away my past
Let the sun burns away my future
Let the god take away my soul
Let me be on my own, let me piss myself off this life
Let the people judge my life
Let me die inside I lost everything..

Sometime to realize that you're well,
Someone must come along and fuckin' hurt you!

I learn my lesson well all from you
To be confident to the way I chose
After all these years of dumped and hatred
Now I'm becoming with no regret

All lesson learn in life never have to feel sorry
I love you once and I'll leave you alone in the end

I arm myself and I extend my whole lives
Try to remember what the fuck I live for
This great escape to light my sense of thought
And now I've made all the answers of my question

Listen to me..
I'm not kind human who doesn't know to say thanks
But if these all you want here's my graduation and
Don't ever blame me with all these crack words
Look into yourself, these are what you want?

No regret..

We try to dive our own mind
You just nothing one who dumped me out
Now, I'm becoming with no regret..
