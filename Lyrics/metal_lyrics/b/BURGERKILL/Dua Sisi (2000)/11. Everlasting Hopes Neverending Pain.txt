Lay my body down I'm getting restless and tired
Too many problems shock take me down to your embrace

This lonely night feel so long
I hope and pray for better tomorrow

Lay my body down trying to release this bond
Too many problem shock take me down to your embrace

This lonely night feel so long
I hope and pray for better tomorrow, it was sucks!

I'm alone here stuck on my own mind, fell so sick
I'm surrender and I just shut my mouth and close my eyes

For god's sake I'm getting tired
Too many problems shock, it was sucks!

Shut my mouth close my eyes
So confuse then I drunk this madness seems can release
It's sucks !

I'm sick of being my self !
