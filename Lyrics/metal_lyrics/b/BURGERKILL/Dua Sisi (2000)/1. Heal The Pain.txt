These hard days got me thinkin'
To pass this never ending pain
Heal the pain take the pain away
Please down kick me when I'm down

My goddamn whole life is full of hell,
So what kind of hell do you want me to build

Always feel bitter never feel better
My goddamn whole life is full of hell
I got myself lay down on the ground
Feel so helpless and dying..
