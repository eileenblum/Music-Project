What have you got from your society
They just make you being pressed down
Do you ever think to break down the wall
And let me be what you wanna be !

Bring your hatred away from home
Let's stand apart from society
Struggling our life survive in the street
Forget the statue that's the way we're

Here we are from the street scream and shout
Hear nothing feel nothing just straight ahead
This is the way we live forget your self
Different mind different styles but keep rebel
