Massive chaos, society chokes itself
Dead eyes see no future, in all us breeds the fire

Arcane's the dense - veil of distress
And dread feeds the flames that burn my mind to ash

Line up - all you doomed people
And say welcome to the ravening darkness
Judgement day, the world burns

Doom makes the blood run cold
Fast redemption, hope is gone
Damnation, nemesis, don't play with fire
Our deepest sympathy for the lost souls

Scorched earth, dead ember
We follow wake of devastation

Like hungry zombies we're on manhunt
And wrath corrodes our darkened minds

The noose - merciless tightening on us
We're finished, out day has come
We killed ourself, oh what a great day
Our world ends right now
