Lashing rain patterns against the window
And reflects my crestfallen mood

I feel the autumn storms coming closer
In hopes of cleansing my wounds

Restart - the night made way for the sunlight
And left behind the dark days of your saturnine past

I sense it's time for new horizons
I take my joys and sorrows and start for a new world

Far, far away, my feet take me to a better place
To live my life immune from poisoned air

Sun's rays flatter my anguished heart
And i can erase from memory the darker times
