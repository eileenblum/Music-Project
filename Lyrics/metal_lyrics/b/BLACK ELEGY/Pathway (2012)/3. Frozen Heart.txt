Deep within my heart i've always felt the fire
That warmed me in the cold, cold world

And times changed and seasons went by while my heart stood still
And just a reflection of love remained

I have lost all faith in trust in honesty, love and caring
My frozen heart forgot to breathe and stopped to beat

I was left lonely and broken, poisoned by a treacherous kiss
Oh what wicked deceit, all i've felt and all, all i've longed for left with you

Will i ever awake, will i ever feel again
Will my heart ever be revived

And years passed by and nothing released me from misery
And there's no room left for hope
