It is in all heads, the society falls ill with itself
One pants for air and drags his infected soul day to day

One fulfills his duties, last hope dies
Daydream or nightmare - it's time to wake up

Beyond recall - one stands his ground as a soldier
And thus in his memory, there sleeps just an idle wish

The speech is about fear, fear of the future,
Of poverty, job loss - last hope dies

An ideal world when parents cured the wounds
Who will now?

Inside our souls, there slumbers the desire for safety
In Childhood we experienced it every day
Lots of love, we had no danger and no difficulties
It was an ideal world

Beyond recall - one stands his ground as a soldier
And thus in his memory, there sleeps just a sheltered life

Lack of change kills, so please don't resign
Other-directed, the lack of creativity

One trudges home and hopes for permanence
No responsibility, no praise
Unsocial one doesn't sit down to the weir
Depressions programmed

Last hope dies - safe and...
Last hope dies - safe and sound
