Do you care for all delusion in your dreams?
You see the light in nights when fear's surrounding you

I remember scary things that still seem real,
I try to run and hide

Run away, feel the strain - overwhelmed by fear
Lost in a maze of...

Dreams - they can be reality
Your mind pretends you bad emotions
Lost deep inside our souls
This is your darkest night

Back to life my thoughts in-between day and dark
I pass my dreams unreal, can't breath 'til i wake

I know that's a dream, just thoughts of curiosity
Being part of my soul and my destiny

Why nightmares fill my mind throughout the day
Delusion scares me now, i shiver full of fear
So cruel i feel he's grabbing around my neck
Falling down so deep

Try to hide, you're my dream - fear in my face

Trapped in my...

Run faster,
No one can avoid his destiny
