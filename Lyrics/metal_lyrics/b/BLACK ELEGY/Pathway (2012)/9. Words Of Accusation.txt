Still, so many stones that obstruct the way
Yet, so many tears that flooded your eyes
And all the grief that that spelled doom for you

A hard blow that hit you deep,
A sudden loss that burned your hopes to ash
And all the pain haunts you like a ghost
In a really bad nightmare

It's the bitter truth at the end of the line

No way back just the pain that speaks,
That speaks the words of accusation
A sting of remorse aches within

And leaves coldness deep within my soul
It's really serious how you suffer inside

Your name is eternalized in my heart
Forever your words will echo
Your words of love and devotion still caress my heart

This is your only bequest and I will keep this remembrance
Until the sky darkens and the pain, the solitude kills me

Locked up in a veiled inner panic-room
It's so very cold, desperate and oppressive
Life and death are struggling for their prevalence
Forsaken i retreat into my shell

Still, so many thoughts lost in the past
Yet, so many lights that stopped to shine
And all the feelings that...that wither on the vine

A hard blow that opened your eyes
A sudden loss that shattered your fragile world
All the pain descends upon you
You're the lead in worst case scenario

The pain that the speaks the words,
Laying the blame on you

Forevermore solitude attends me

But maybe one day time can heal
Your deep wounds that ruled the bitter years
All the tears have washed away your woes
Just a dream, just an illusion? For now...
