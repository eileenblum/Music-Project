Empty skies, after sunshine comes the rain, darkening rises

Silence nourishes the pain
Fly away on wings of equability
Nothing matters, no one else

Better Times have passed or still to come
Leaving now and don't look back
Life is hard so just fight back, its worth a tty
No further chance, no last goodbye, live your life

Dream again, let the pictures wash away, swept aside
Hide your feelings deep inside
Enjoy yourself, life's too short to stay behind
No damn thing be in my way

Grey to stained, no more blurred
The streets are paved with gold
Breaking out never give in again
Leaving the impair events again and again
Force your way, you're the next in line

Watching clouds passing hope in pleasant white
Now comes the sun, it's warming breath you take
Indulge yourself, cheering up is what you need
Chains fall down, just be relieved
