The soulreaver, he's coming around to devour your soul
You're just what he is waiting for

Willed sacrifice, the devil incarnate feeds your greed and fools your mind

High day in hell, another sinner sold his soul

For nothing more than a golden cage

Faithful servant, the reaver takes your hand and leads you to your grave

Run, run, as fast as you can, the reaver's on your trail
He's coming to suck your life, smash your world and cut your throat

It's the souleater, he's coming around and your greed
Feeds his greed for more and more of your soul

Willed sacrifice, the devil incarnate drives you over the edge

Harvest time, the time has come, come to pay
For all your...all your foolery

Faithful servant, the reaver drains your fate
And leads you to a house - a house of mirrors

I cannot breathe, the debt it takes my last breath
And fills my lungs with black smoke, help me !
