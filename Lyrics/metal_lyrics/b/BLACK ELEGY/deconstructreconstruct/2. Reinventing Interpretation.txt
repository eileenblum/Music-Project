In need of another way to explain
Reinventing interpretation
Replacing reality with nothing but lies
Laughing away moralities

No hesitation, no time to lose
A moral fraud to an alarming extent
The scale of the massacre of ethical values
Larger than we ever could accept

Though thereâs no attempt to question their deeds
No resoluteness to defy their words
Weâre sinking deeper into the dark
Hopelessly lost, no return?!

Dissembling words are spoken by the devious
Truth and lie with intent watered-down
A densely web of lies is setting up around
Our minds are turned from upside down

So our fate is sealed, we are caught in this web and
Moveless we accept our life in a mental cage, do we?

Weâve reached a land-mark
Itâs time to decide
To take opposition or allow to die inside

Two-faced priests appear on stage
They assure us itâs safe to believe
In their words, sanctified by god
To proceed to their open arms

Trappedâ¦in oppressive restriction
Watchedâ¦by the eyes of control
Nevermoreâ¦will you doubt again
Servantâ¦this is your name
