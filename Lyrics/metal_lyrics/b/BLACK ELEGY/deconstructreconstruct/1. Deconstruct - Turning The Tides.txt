Confessed offenders availing the virus
Advanced, refined as deadly
Venomous poison for minds and hearts

A comedy of intrigue
With a view to oppression
To delude rogue intentions

Unconceivably simple is how itâs all done
A stroke of genious of lousy con men
injecting the fire thatâs burning veins,
killing souls to harvest obedience

Conscience offered up for authority
Sanityâs been buried

A repentant devotee:
Tell me whyâ¦did I fall from grace andâ¦
Tell me whyâ¦did I lose my faith, soâ¦
Tell me whyâ¦did I fool myself andâ¦
Tell me whyâ¦did I sell my soul

Morality given up for dominance
The tides have been turned

The oppressors:
Deconstructâ¦assimilateâ¦
free will to dustâ¦resistance is futile
Annihilateâ¦eliminateâ¦
obliterateâ¦the soil has been burned

Unforeseen by the seers though planned by the liars
The meaning of words was turned upside down
The true believers, too convenient to question
A fake accepted as fact

Unbelievably barefaced
Winding the drama
A feat of a truly skillful player
acting in cold blood, speaking words of inanity,
burning hearts, killing minds to dominate

Corruption mixed up with ignorance
The facts have been strained
Morality given up for dominance
The tides have been turned

All hope dies in rousing cheers
in front of the delighted world
