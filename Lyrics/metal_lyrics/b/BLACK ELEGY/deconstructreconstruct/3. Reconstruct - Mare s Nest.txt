Fallen for a mareâs nest
For insidious trickery
For perfidious corruption of an amoral sect

The call of deceit, the stench of lies
Donât listenâ¦to all these foolish preacherâs words

Delusion rebuilt on fragile columns
Lost souls ready to take their place in the flock

Obvious untruth worshipped by masses
Donât followâ¦a blinding light that hides betrayal

Nourished by the ones of colossal lies
Slithering like a doubtful snake
Spreading the venom of the false dawn
Praying malice, terror, hate and scorn

â¦dependants of liesâ¦

[The preacher:]
I am god my words have been sainted
Believe in me, I know the way
Bow to me the two- faced father
Donât you dare to doubt of me

Conformâ¦to my despotism
Obeyâ¦.all my empty words
Comeâ¦and be my spineless servant
Kneelâ¦before my unholy throne

As a child of god, in the arms of indifference
Affecting a sheltered life
The bottomâs heâs at one with self-deception
Straight fall for a liar

Avid to pay the price for their salvation
For a place in a doubtful collective
Blessed by those of feigned belief
Donât act like a fool canting facile speeches

Holding sway over those of feeble minds
Controlling the fate of the weak
Dominate, enslave, manipulate
The core essence how religion kills

â¦and it doesâ¦for sure it doesâ¦

[The slaves:]
For all of our lifetime weâll be serving
Obedient children of light
