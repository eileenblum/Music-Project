Creatures of darkness are calling my name,
Burning my mind invisible pain
The walls of Thalarion are rising in my mind
And it seems to me to die, it seems to me to fall
I know you don't care, I see it in your eyes
But soon you'll start to cry

[Chorus]
Pulling the trigger, fear in your eyes
When I see a burning sky
Pulling the trigger, firing with hate
When I see a red sunrise

Run to the stairs try to survive
Your blood starts to flow, out is the night
The mighty Thalarion is ruling my mind
Follow the will, follow the sign
The mighty Thalarion wants blood hate and fire
And tow it's time to die

[Chorus]

Awake from this nightmare, a gun in my hands
And it seems to me to die, it seems to me to fall
I've killed a man, blood on his head
The fear keeps my eyes

[Chorus]
