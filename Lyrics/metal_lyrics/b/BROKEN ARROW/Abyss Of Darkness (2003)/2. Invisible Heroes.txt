Running and the time is getting closer
And the lights are turning off
And my breath seems to be louder
Waiting and each second seems a life
And my life has been too short
That's my destiny: glorious

Fighting and the night becomes my mother
And I hear the call of God
And the fear is now my power
Crawling feel th eheartbeat of the empire
Who rule the darkest side
It's time to die... warrior

[Chorus]
Oh... feel the power in my hands
See the fire burning red
Feel the sweet smell of my land
Let my hate explode

Voices, they are coming from below
They are sure to have control
But the time is getting closer
Vengeance, now I know the chance is come
Revolution will go on
See your father's eyes... warrior

[Chorus]

Running and the time is getting closer
And the lights are turning off
And my breath seems to be louder
Waiting and each second seems a life
And my life has been too short
That's my destiny: glorious

[Chorus]
