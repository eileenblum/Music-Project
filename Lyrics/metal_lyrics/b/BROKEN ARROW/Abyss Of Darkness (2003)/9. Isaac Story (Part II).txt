A little boy of ten years old was crying in the car
Isaac Murphy was his name
He was found by the CIA in the area of the landing
The fear in the eyes, the Isaac's story

This was the last affair for the old agent Riggs
Who was driving pensive to the base
He didn't realize this strange, incredible case
But now he starts to listen the Isaac's Story

[Chorus]
Do I believe
The things I've saw
In the desert night
Fire ni the air
Lights in the night
Fear from the sky

Isaac dreamed of a crazy star dancing in the night
Then he fell in a lake of fire
Strange faces, unhuman voices, he couldn't move at all
Lost inside a dream, the Isaac's Story

[Chorus]
