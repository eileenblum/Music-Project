They thought it was the end
Demons from the sky
The army, loaded guns behind the wall
Let the nazis come and pray your little star

Another day forgotten in the fog
In a winter paint in blood

[Chorus]
Stalingrad there's a course on you
Stalingrad they stalk behind you
Stalingrad the guns are blazing
In the middle of your heart lost and frozen

And the fate did its work
As the snow started to fall
The black ones fought a war against a ghost
The fire raged and they knew that all was lost

Another day forgotten in the fog
In a winter paint in blood

[Chorus]
