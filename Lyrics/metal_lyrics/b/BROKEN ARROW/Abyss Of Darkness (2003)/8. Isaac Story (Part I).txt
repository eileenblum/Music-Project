Darkness creeps to the cell, Isaac is locked down in steel
Darkness, silence and fear, switch off the alarm gear
Take the guy out, leave the base, and save your own lives
The general Powell wants you dead, so run in the night

Darkness, in a night without moon, a car darts on the road
Darkness, cold on my face, when the rain starts to fall
The chase is on as the general screams: "Take the guy at any cost"
The chase is on, no time to waste, they cannot be so far

The car is roaring on a desert road
Evil thought: "We can hide forever"
It seems we are living a sensleless dream
The way is lost

[Chorus]
Lights come from the sky
And my mind trapped in the ice
And the guy starts to be strange
... starts to be strange
He answers the call

Darkness, the face in the hands, Isaac still gaze to the sky
Darkness, I don't understand, what happened, te reason why
A blinding lights coming from the sky, a spaceship's on my head
Hypnotic I cannot move, they come, it's time to die

Hundred shadows around the boy
Evil claws tearing lukewarm leather
Isaac is losing his human shape
God! I am lost

[Chorus]
