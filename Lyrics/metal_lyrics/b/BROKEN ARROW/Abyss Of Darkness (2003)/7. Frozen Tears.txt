Here, now, fire against the shadows
Fight, now, try to save your life
A wasted land and sorrow
The scene of the retreat
A wasted land and sorrow
Men died in the ice
And we fight, and we fall
And the snow is turning blood

Hear, them, coming from the shadows
Fight, run, they'll never let you go
We'll never see tomorrow
The strongest faith has gone
We'll never see tomorrow
The hands down in the ice
And we fight, and we fall
And the snow is turning blood

[Chorus]
Winter... Silence... Try to carry on
Winter... Silence... Marching on and on
There's no reason to fight this war
Alone and far from home
The sky is ice
I'm losing the control
Ad we fight, and we fall

Here, now, fire against the shadows
Fight, now, try to save your life
A wasted land and sorrow
The scene of the retreat
A wasted land and sorrow
Men died in the ice
And we fight, and we fall
And the snow is turning blood

[Chorus]
