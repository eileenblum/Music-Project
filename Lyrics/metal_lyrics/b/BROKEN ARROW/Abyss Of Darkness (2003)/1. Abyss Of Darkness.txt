The sea was calm, Orion in the sky
And we were ready to dive
The engines whizzed in a cold northern sea
The crew was ready to fight

Course three point five, an endless night
The silence filled our souls

[Chorus]
Feel the breath of hundred fighting men
Falling down in a nigtmare made of steel
Feel the breath of hundred fighting men
Falling down the darkest killing thrill

The point was near, the commander gave the sign
The fear broke on our mind
There was something strange,
In the torpedo compartment
A rumble shook the air

[Chorus]

Course three point five, an endless night
The silence filled our souls

[Chorus]
