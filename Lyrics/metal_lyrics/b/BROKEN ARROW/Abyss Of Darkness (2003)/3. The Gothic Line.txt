Tonight, our life fade away
We feel the breath of the wolf
One light, lefter, creeps on the snow
Now we've got to be strong
Hear the nazis get near
Fire! Do it again

My life, the freedom of the land
Behind the gothic line

[Chorus]
The days go by as the winter rages
And the terror is rising in my veins
The days go by and the sun is blind
Lost inside the darkened light

Don't cry, running away
You have to hold the control
The last fight has yet to come
And we have to go on
See your brothers falling down
Fire! Do it again

My life, the freedom of the land
Behind the gothic line

[Chorus]
