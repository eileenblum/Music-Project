Dead on the inside

Raised by wolves, in sheep's clothes that abandoned me 
But taught me to get up when I fall on my knees

Man makes monster, monster kills man
Taking your crown's always been part of the plan
If you weren't so stuck in your own head, you'd be where I am now instead
Nobody's gonna hear you
When you're calling for help
When you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you
Because the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out

Drown you out

I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am 
And to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside

Dead on the inside
Dead on the inside 

If you want an enemy I'll be the last one that you ever meet
But I can tell you now, that you don't stand a god damn chance against me
Nobody's gonna hear you
When you're calling for help
When you're calling for help
Nobody's gonna hear you
Because the sound of my screams are gonna drown you out

I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am 
And to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside

Fuck that, fuck this
If you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim
Fuck that, fuck this
If you're gonna burn a bridge
You better hold your breath and learn to swim

I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am
And to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside

I've learned a lot but it took me too long to find out who I am
And to prove you wrong
How can you live before you die
When you're already dead on the inside
Dead on the inside
