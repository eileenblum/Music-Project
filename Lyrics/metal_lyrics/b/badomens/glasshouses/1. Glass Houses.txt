I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the devil
More than I've seen god
[2x]

Cover your ears
And shut your eyes
'Cause whatever I'm bout to say is gonna ruin your night!

This is a call out
And I'm not scared to drop some names
You've dug your grave and you have no one but yourself to blame

I see the world
In black and white
Because true color always fades under the right lights

I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the devil
More than I've seen god

And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you say

You've run out of luck and I'm calling your bluff
You stab me in the back...
But not deep enough!

But not deep enough!
I see through you

I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the devil
More than I've seen god

And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you say

I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the devil
More than I've seen god

And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you say

You said I'd never make it
You said I'd fall on my face
But now I'm right where I belong and I put you in your place

You said I'd never make it
You said I'd make a mistake
But now I'm right where I belong and you've got nothing to say!

I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the devil
More than I've seen god

And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you say

I see through you
I know what you are
I've seen the devil
More than I've seen god

And when he has you by your neck
I hope you choke on every fucking word you say

You stab me in the back
But not deep enough!
