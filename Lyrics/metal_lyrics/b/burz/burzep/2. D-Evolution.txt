Life
Tell me its something
Living isnât wrong

Time
Isnât a moment
wrap your lies with a blanket

God
isnât a human
How come I am god?

everything

Now, he is calling!
Games, are a warning, a warning
for you

How can you stand it?
stuck in a little game of chess?

roaming souls, in your fucked up game
curse you, and curse your name

Light makes the sun (chant)

stupid games, stuck in
worthless names, stuck in
stupid games, stick in
made up names fuck it

The names, the games, the lies, the cross
