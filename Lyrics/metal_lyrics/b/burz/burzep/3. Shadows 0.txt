I am the one, who has nothing
may reflect in your mind
I cannot save, those from dying
these seven seconds will fly

a singer sings, without returning
a singer sings into flame

I need a sinner, who can speak slowly
I need to think about painâ¦

Now Now now

Waves, lives, echoes
There is a name

Flames, cries, bellows
There is a king

I am the one, who has nothing
may reflect in your mind
I cannot save, those from dying
these seven seconds will fly

rage, claims, decrepit
None other than I
More, lives, wasted
Iâll let you die

Now

Thanks to burzburz99 for sending track #1 lyrics.
