Rise, these, the fakers
leave not, the righteous
shrunken hollow binded flavors
now they can receive the flood
Rise

Needles piercing filthy
forests echoes with demise
come join the waves of ascension
Be thou flies, in the wake, of a demon
Rise

Hold me the world is below you
These flavors of glory destroy you
Forced cries it's hard to ignore you
3 eyes, may God be here for you

There comes a day, when no one is waiting
Great giants, cradles of fire, with 3 kinds of eyes
