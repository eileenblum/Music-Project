Breaking out in a cold sweat,
Darkest nightmares are stalking me
Distortion, set me free!
Breathless, lost faith, death is near

Turning my life to ashes!
The birth of madness,
Stay! Pray!

Donât look back, chase the light
All your demons left behind
Read the evil signs,
Eyes wide open, now!

Thereâs no witness, thereâs nothing but sickness
Integrity lies on the ground
You fight, I stand, the truth in my bare hands
No time to Waste

Donât look back, chase the light
All your demons left behind
Read the evil signs,
Eyes wide open, now!

Burning bridges, take it or leave it,
In the shortest possible time
You run, I stand, be careful or be dead
Avengers of sense!

Donât look back, chase the light
All your demons left behind
Read the evil signs,
Eyes wide open, now!
