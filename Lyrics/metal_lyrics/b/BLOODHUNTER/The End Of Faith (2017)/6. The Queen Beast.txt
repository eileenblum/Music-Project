The ancient lands
were her dominion
her homeland
The temple of the chant

Until the day
that the shallows turned to red
and the oldest crow
sang for the end of joy

Kneel down!
Fear the new empire
Bowed down!
To the ring of fire

Invoke the queen beast
Her scent of death is near
The forbidden words
will form her freedom song

Moonlight, shining bright
The cold night comes, falling fast
Release her, she lays on the ground
Awake! Take their lives!

Invoke the queen beast
Her scent of death is near
The forbidden words
will form her freedom song

Evil signs are made by the knife,
Sacrifice! Let her guide your hand

Moonlight, shining bright
The cold night comes, falling fast
Release her, she lays on the ground
Awake! Take their lives!

Feel her wrath
Sheâs watching from the stars
Abstraction of life
The air, the nature, the skies are now her reign
The shades in darkened silverlights
The black flame burns!
The highest priestess arise

Invoke the queen beast
Her scent of death is near
The forbidden words
will form her freedom song

Evil signs are made by the knife,
Sacrifice! Let her guide your hand

Moonlight, shining bright
The cold night comes, falling fast
Release her, she lays on the ground
Awake! Take their lives!

Moonlight!
The cold night comes, falling fast!
Release her!
Awake! Take their lives!
