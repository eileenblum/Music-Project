The trails of shame
will lead you to your end
...your end!
Look straight ahead,
the world is in your hands
The pain goes away

Head up, stand up,
No one will make you fall
Wire fences inside
Make a difference in your life,
Lessons behind, realign!

It doesn't matter if you're the only one
Still standing up!
Break! Change!
Thereâs nothing you can't reach
Forgive or forget!

They want to close your eyes,
Your weapon is your courage
Donât let them live in glory
A victory in the struggle for life
Savage! This is our war!

And when you see them behind
worshiping a false Goddess
that rises from her ashes,
They make you think that they're right
What liesâ¦ Beneath?

Beware the greatness
of all that preachers claiming
that want you to shine
Honor betrayed,
Why don't you break your chains?
Release from the past!

It doesn't matter if you're the only one
Still standing up!
Break! Change!
Thereâs nothing you can't reach
Forgive or forget!

They want to close your eyes,
Your weapon is your courage
Don't let them live in glory
A victory in the struggle for life
Savage! This is our war!
