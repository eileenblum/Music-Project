All my sins,
bleeding skin
Feel my breath,
under the Earth

No one can save me,
Nobody can hear this claim!
No one can save me,
Nobody can hear this claim!

All my fears,
Dying breeds,
Buried down,
For So long

These tears were falling drop by drop,
To the sea
No one can hurt me anymore,
You will see

Through the darkness, I found light
This soul has learnt to fly
I have nothing but this heart,
The strongest power is Inside

Pulling weeds on my knees,
Couldn't find the right path

These old trees and its ancient seeds,
The deepest roots
Will lead you to the true
hidden wounds.

Through the darkness, I found light
This soul has learnt to fly
I have nothing but this heart,
The strongest power is Inside

Let the storm come!
Let the storm come!

Through the darkness, I found light
This soul has learnt to fly
I have nothing but this heart,
The strongest power is Inside

Let the storm come!
Let the storm come!

Wake up!
Are you ready to fight?
Wake up!
Are you ready to fight?
