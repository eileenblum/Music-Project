Raised my head, innocenceâs gone away
Iâm lost, this shiver, I canât go anywhere
Your empty words, this pain overload in me
Your soul destroys, Itâs the end of faith

Bare feet, cold graves
Shades of fire, despair
Ashes everywhere, my bodyâs been thrown away
to this void, my delusions are my own fortress!

In dark caves, ancient worlds, no domains,
The ruins of a life, am I living or dead?
The pouring rain falls down and whispers your name
Shine on, feel me, donât leave me this way

Thereâs a voice in my mind
Iron nails, in my heart
Black star fading fast
Guide me through the right path!

Gates of stone, locking up my ghosts
Sea of souls drowning in this shore
Rising force, lift me, Iâm yours,
Cosmic chaos! Light! Blood!

Bare feet, cold graves
Shades of fire, despair
Ashes everywhere, my bodyâs been thrown away
to this void, my delusions are my own fortress!

Raised my head, innocenceâs gone away
Iâm lost, this shiver, I canât go anywhere
Your empty words, this pain overload in me
Your soul destroys, itâs the end of faith

Gates of stone, locking up my ghosts
sea of souls drowning in this shore
Rising force, lift me, Iâm yours,
Cosmic chaos! Light! Blood!
