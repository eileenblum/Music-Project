Grabbed my ashes
to build my soul,
My only intention
was fair, as hard as stone

Iâm still infected,
don't let me die
The words rejected
will fly to distant lands

So wrong, for so long
Denial!
I'm the one
It's meâ¦ that fire!
This is the end

That healing process
of change was failed
Iâve been through hell,
The scars in my chest,
I was livingâ¦ living on the edge

Possessed by myself,
condemned to death
My tears are frozen,
canât feel the pain

Empty promise,
Felt in void space
Time runs out
Between us!

Just write another line,
Bring memories to life,
Show me your cards,
Release your chains
Your fucking chains!

And when you're safe,
You see their faces,
No time to waste,
Don't be afraid!
Stand by my sideâ¦ Forever!!!

Grabbed my ashes
to build my soul,
My only intention
was fair, as hard as stone

Iâm still infected,
don't let me die
The words rejected
will fly to distant lands

So wrong, for so long
Denial!
I'm the one
It's meâ¦ that fire!
This is the end

That healing process
of change was failed
Iâve been through hell,
The scars in my chest,
I was livingâ¦ living on the edge

Possessed by myself,
condemned to death
My tears are frozen,
canât feel the pain

Itâs written inside,
You can read the signs
The flashes of bright lights
enlightening the darkened skies

A world of lies
Between us!
We're victims of time
My eyesâ¦ just the mirror behind...

Your eyes
Forgive us
Again, we shall overcome
We are one
