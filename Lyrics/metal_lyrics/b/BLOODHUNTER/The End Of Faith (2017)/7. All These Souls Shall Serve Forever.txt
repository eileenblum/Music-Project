Join me in hell,
Join my sacred reign
All your sins remain
In the hands of faith

When your
Everything is nothing
Shades of death are watching
Redemption is near

Watch the searing flame
Smell the burning flesh
Close your eyes,
The visions are hidden in your mind
The voice says
âGive up!â

Everywhere
domination itself!
Let! Let their blood run!

No restraint! No regrets!
All these souls shall serve
...Forever!

My salvation is not under your control!
Elevation!
I am free!

Shine through me
Darkest mother
Let me see them
Falling in glory

Breathe in, feel me
Horror grows
Behind your door

My salvation is not under your control
Elevation!
I am free!

Candlelights
The cold wind blows fast
Light my fire,
Desire

Sighs with delight
Follow the sign
Evil lives inside!

Searing flame
Burning flesh
Give up
Concilium, Iâm your life!
