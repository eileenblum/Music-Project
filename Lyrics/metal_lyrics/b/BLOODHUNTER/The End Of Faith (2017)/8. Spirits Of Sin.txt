Lost my voice in this empty grave,
Ashes to ashes, no words to say

The essence of life
is inside your veins
Vultures surround me
at the gates of death

Reborn, rebirth, the skies
are turning red
The visions of time
shows me my final end

Step aside, it's me under the corpses,
I canât breath, I canât feel, I'm frozen

Over and over,
I face my fears.
Stumbling over the same stone

It's destiny
No revenge, no glory,
Itâs blasphemy
Choose your star,
Your own path
Legends are written in stone!

Step aside, it's me,
I hear your voices,
Spirits of sin,
Dead roses

Lust for blood,
dying hearts
Fire inside
Wolves and crows

Black is my flag,
Empire of the sun
Burn! Burn it down!
I am the knife
Cry! Afterlife comes!
