Do not look for
The face of God!
The great beast
is watching you all!

The power overload
Oooohhh!! Burn it All!

Nightmares chasing, the eye of the storm,
Spitting the blood!
Bring me horror, madness, end of hope,
Destroy your lords!

Chaos found the silence in my voice,
Spitting the blood!
Wake Up! Violence! Feed me! Give me more,
The old dark legacyâs releasing your soul

Do not look for
The face of God!
The great beast
is watching you all!

The power overload
Oooohhh!! Burn it All!

Donât let go!
Face it all!
Lose control!
Take it all!

Reach the Top!
Donât give up!
They are strong!
Killâem all!

Nightmares chasing, the eye of the storm,
Spitting the blood!
Bring me horror, madness, end of hope,
Destroy your lords!

Chaos found the silence in my voice,
Spitting the blood!
Wake Up! Violence! Feed me! Give me more,
The old dark legacyâs releasing your soul

Thereâs no way of breathing enough
My hands around your neck!
Are pressing for so long

Donât be afraid
The End is coming along
our way, your destiny,
Our Pride! Take this life, go!
