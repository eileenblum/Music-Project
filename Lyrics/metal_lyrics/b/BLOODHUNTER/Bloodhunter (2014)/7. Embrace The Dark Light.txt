Scratching your entrails
There's nothing to say
The silent voice
Surrounding your head

Deep down inside
Follow the blind
Oblivious to stand
What's real or bright

Into the abyss
You fall, you will die
No one can save you
Your fate, your world is face down

Unconscious, suspicious
The walls are shut down
The void, the wisdom
The flight of the unharmed,

What will you do?
Where will you hide?
Over the top
There's nowhere to run

Embrace the dark light
The truth, the unknown
Are possessing your mind
That presence, the essence
Frost in your eyes!

What will you do?
Where will you hide?
Over the top
There's nowhere to run
