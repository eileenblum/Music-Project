In the darkness, the shadows...
A poisoned sound runs deeplyâ¦

Burial tomb
The oldest truth
Tell me your secrets
The mystery of you

Save me! Take me!
Fading to non-sense!

Come to me, sorrow
Join me in grief
Inside and outside
This corpse is still me

And I bleed,
Here in the void I live
Silence comes over me

Put here my dagger
Ripping my insides
Dissect now my flesh
Asphyxiate my needs

I canât feel,
Suffering makes me believe
Death is my only relief

Pride is forsaken!
Thereâs no tomorrow!
Only the blind faith
Will guide your dark thoughts
The broken mirrors reflecting smoking bones

Ohhh, dethroned queen, the seeds of evil
live in you,
A frozen liar, remains still...
Sharpen her skills, time to kill!

Black thorns, red roses,
Cold mist fills me
Drinking the absinthe
To kill my disease

And I see,
My body floating in the sea
Bitterness breaks through my skin

In the Darkness, the Shadowsâ¦
A shattered soul was haunted...
Unchain my Heart...
Come to me Sorrowâ¦
