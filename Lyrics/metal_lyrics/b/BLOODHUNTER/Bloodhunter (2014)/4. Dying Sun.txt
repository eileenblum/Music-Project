Once we were one
Both good and bad
The world was divided
which is my side?

Defeated, Insulted,
Vengeance is mine!
Itâs my Time,
Black legions, Rise!

Chains, bleeding inside,
Faith is only lies,
All you can see are blinded hearts,
Worshiping a deity that preaches spreading the fire

Feel the dark light taking your life
Out of nowhere, where angels cry
Raping your minds
Dying sun!

The Mightier, The Meaner
The Saint, The Sinner
The Fallen, The Leader
The Sacred, Forbidden

Chains, bleeding inside,
Faith is only lies,
All you can see are blinded hearts,
Worshiping a deity that preaches spreading the fire

Ashes behind, curse the Altar!
Kingdom of will, find freedom, fight!
Your world is mine,
Sacrifice!

Feel the dark light taking your life
Out of nowhere, where angels cry
Raping your minds
Dying sun!
