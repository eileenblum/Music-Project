Holy darkness
Hidden behind the glory of times
Sacred nightmare
Iâm not afraid of God

BLOODHUNTER
Drink from the black chalice of death
HELLWARDER

This sun of vengeance
will raze to the ground
this lineage was born to
spread the great suffering

Slaves in Heaven,
go down, Antichrist,
after his baptism
the last star will fall

For thousand ages
Weâve lived buried and insane
This fire raged
in your lost souls with howls of pain

BLOODHUNTER
Abyss servants will remain!
HELLWARDER
Annihilation in your veins
BLOODHUNTER
Rites of murders killing your faith
HELLWARDER

This sun of vengeance
will raze to the ground
this lineage was born to
spread the great suffering

Slaves in Heaven,
go down, Antichrist,
after his baptism
the last star will fall

Blood! Death! Holy Fire!
Putrid Ashes! Bodies Scattered!
Evil Lust! Flames Burning!
All the Spirits Marching!

WAR IS OUR REIGN!!!

This sun of vengeance
will raze to the ground
this lineage was born to
spread the great suffering

Slaves in Heaven,
go down, Antichrist,
after his baptism
the last star will fall

Holy darkness
Hidden behind the glory of times
Sacred nightmare
Weâre not afraid of God!
