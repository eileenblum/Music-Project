Saints of sand
The holy power will remain
Taste their flesh
Angels falling

Feel the pain
This sacred torture never ends
Bow to the death
Forget your prayers, you are dead!

Hear my command:
you all are slaves,
you cannot change
your final fate

You live in sin,
the sacred flame
This is my will,
you must obey!

The mighty eternity
has led you to your tragic end
Youâre blindfolded, wounded and guilty
Youâre victims of your own spell

Here is the last judgement
the prophecy will destroy the Earth,
Oceans of souls in agony
Embrace the apostasy!

Hear my command:
you all are slaves,
you cannot change
your final fate

You live in sin,
the sacred flame
This is my will,
you must obey!

Saints of sand
The holy power will remain
Taste their flesh
Angels falling!

Feel the pain
This Sacred torture never ends
Bow to death
Forget your prayers, you are dead!

The Human Race
will not resist
blessing the ground
becoming weak

Hear my command:
you all are slaves,
you cannot change
your final fate

Saints of sand
The Holy Power will remain
Taste their flesh
Angels falling!!!
