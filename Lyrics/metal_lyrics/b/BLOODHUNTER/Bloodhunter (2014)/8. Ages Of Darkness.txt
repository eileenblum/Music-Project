The words were written
When she just closed her eyes
She kept a secret
No one should have known

Judgement, feeding lies,
Save this honor,
My sin is giving birth
To the king of pain

Funeral pyre
You will burn alive
Thereâs no redemption,
Youâll pay for your crimes

Judgement, feeding lies,
Save this honor,
My sin is giving birth
To the king of pain

The sacred mother
The first, the chosen one,
Her holy virtues
Tear down the heavensâ gates

Oceans of fire
Freedom for the damned
Ages of darkness
The legend will prevail

When the sun goes down
The code is open,
Their bones, their lonesome rides,
Despair, hear their cries!

Justify,
Save his life!
No remorse,
He will fight!

Let me go,
Here and now,
Itâs my blood,
Daimonas!

Justify,
Save his life!
No remorse,
He will fight!

Let me go,
Here and now,
Itâs my blood,
Daimonas!
