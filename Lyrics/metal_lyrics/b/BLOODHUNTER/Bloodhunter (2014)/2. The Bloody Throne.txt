Over your head
Black shadows falling
Drag me to hell
This is the end of the universe

You canât deny it
You never will be safe
from this nightmare
Youâll never break your chains

Destruction
Itâs the only way
of salvation
The darkest kingdom is everywhere

Cremation! Incineration!
Just corpses desecration!
Damnation! Exasperation!
Masochistic masturbation!

The sacred fire
The bloody throne
Sickly desire
Their heads upon our swords

The sacred fire
Another reign has come
Sickly desire
Of a new era to come

You canât deny it
You never will be safe
From this nightmare,
Youâll never break your chains

Destruction!
Itâs the only way
of salvation
The darkest kingdom is everywhere

Cremation! Incineration!
Just corpses desecration!
Damnation! Exasperation!
Masochistic masturbation!

The sacred fire
The bloody throne
Sickly desire
Their heads upon our swords

The sacred fire
Another reign has come
Sickly desire
Of a new era to come

The sacred fire!!
The bloody throne!!
Sickly desire!!
Their heads upon our swords!!!
