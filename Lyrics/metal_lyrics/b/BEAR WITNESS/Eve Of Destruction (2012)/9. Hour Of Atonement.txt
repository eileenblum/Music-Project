Break the paradigm 
The ties that bind
I refuse to submit to false ideals
Itâs a jaded world 
Consumed by hatred
I wonât live in judgment
Iâll rip your forked tongue out 

Led blindly by a headless leader
Break the chains and grow stronger

This is the struggle 
An uphill battle
Spark revolution

We must break these chains
We must rise up and fight to change our ways 

Take off your mask 
A weak facade
Accept the fact that you canât disguise a hollow soul
Against all odds
We will fight all who oppose
The underdog will have his day
