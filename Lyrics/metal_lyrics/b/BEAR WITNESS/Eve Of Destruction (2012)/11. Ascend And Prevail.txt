Speak not of tongue
Your words will fall short
Victory is forged through heart
The weak will be slaughtered 
No quarter 
No mercy 
Pierced to the hilt 
Gutted and bled dry
Slain by inherent weakness
Buried by the foot of the code

A Faceless aggressor
Looming in darkness 
Hunting in great numbers
Thirsting for the blood of the damned
Rip
Shred
Decimate
Pound 
Crush 
Suffocate
Smother 
Strangle the victim
Leaving no one to tell the tale

Choke on those words
And never forget

We exact our revenge through ruthless aggression
Weather the storm 
Ascend and prevail 
Your reign is at its end 
Crumbling 
As we capture the crown
