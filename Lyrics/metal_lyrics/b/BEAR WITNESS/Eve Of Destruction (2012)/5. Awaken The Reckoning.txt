Hate hammer
Confrontation with deadly force
To cleanse the earth
Awaken the reckoning
The covenant of retribution
I am the face of hatred 
That you have denied
Cast aside
I have the tongue of the truth 
To expose your lies

Be dignified 
Eyes drown with tears
Behold the strength to conquer

I will hone my hatred
And use my strength to target the wicked
Face down on the concrete
Execute them one by one

Believer of justice 
Surviving this pain
Defender of freedom 
Living enslaved 

Sedated and captive
Sadistically bound
A permanent solution to a temporary condition

Welcome to a mind full of hate
A masterful ideology 
Eradicating scum from this earth
Violence the outcome 
Dealing deathâs hand
