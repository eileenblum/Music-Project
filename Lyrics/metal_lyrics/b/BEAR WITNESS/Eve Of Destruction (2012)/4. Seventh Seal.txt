Beware of nightfall
For at dusk the hunt begins
Behold the fury unleashed in darkness
As the moonlight burns its cursed skin 
Once human
Now feral 
Transformed in pain to serve evil 

I awaken to a blizzard 
An onslaught of swirling snow
The winter wind surges and pummels 
Relentless under the full moonâs glow

My heart is pounding 
Unphased by the bitter cold 
This rage so blinding
A thirst for blood I canât control 
A primal calling to maim and slaughter 
Bearing the wretched mark to yield this beastly form

Fleeing the forest
A maze of twisting turns
Hear the piercing cries of the hunter
Sacrifice to serve his father
Footsteps are closing in 
Your life is at its end
Stare into the haunting yellow eyes 
Pouncing
Mauling 
Tearing limb from limb

The rotten breath of the undead beast
Fills the air soured from the feast
An offering of the purest blood
Possession of the ultimate power
To feed this wretched soul

Spill their blood 
Ravenous rampage
A warriorâs heart beating furiously 

The royalty now sacrificed
The seventh son spreads fear
Moving under the cover of darkness
The nightly hunt continues
A sacrificial feast

The beast will devour
The lord of night 
No longer confined

In a blood red sky 
A full moon rise
Another mortal victim 
Another human life

Eternally the night will fall
And the beast will surface
Each passing day of this blessed curse
A transformation unfolds
A constant threat to humankind
Innocent blood feeds
The ferocious predator
