What the fuck have I done?
I donât know where I am 
I donât what I did
Or even who I am 

Is this real or just a nightmare?
I canât wake up from this
Is this just my imagination?
Someone save me from this hell  

Has the whole world gone fucking crazy?
Am I the only one whoâs not insane?
I seldom find this life worth living 
Because of you

Why torment me?
What did I do to deserve this?

Trapped inside a demented state of mind
I can see myself transforming before my eyes

Destroy

Itâs been a long time coming
And it has just begun 
I spent a long time bleeding
And now the damage is done

Now that the deed is done
I must admit 
I have no remorse and no regrets

Iâm going to carve out your eyes 
And then burn you alive 
I want to shatter your skull
Fuck you up

Going to carve out your eyes
Burn you alive
Shatter your skull
Fuck you all

Iâve got blood on my hands
But Iâve got no regrets
Your blood on my hands
Iâm not done yet

Blood on my hands 
Your blood on my hands

Itâs been a long time coming
And it has just begun 
I spent a long time bleeding
And now the damage can never be undone
