Welcome the author of sin 
The bitter taste of hope
The bright white divinity 
Deeper than the darkest intentions
Watching, waiting 
For the ending of a pitiful story

Conceptualizing 
The wrongs that we have suffered
Victimized by injustice 
Catatonic and hollow
A sensation of unspeakable terror 
Endless hours of torture
Enduring the damage plagued with madness

May the blackest of blood rain from the sky
Bringing no mercy into this trial
Darkened heart subhuman scum 
I remember those words that you said to me and the echoes are haunting me still
In a lifetime of triumph and tragedy
A commitment to this dying will

Liberated for a purpose
And may this oath be spoken eternally
It doesnât change me
It sure as fuck doesnât change you

The silence of excommunication
Clinging hopelessly to all that was lost 
Now the purest heart dies a painful death
Innocence desecrated and defiled

Save your last breath for one last wish 
Final words
A dying will

I pledge my oath to this sacrifice
I put my heart on the line
For the end of all time
To this dying will
