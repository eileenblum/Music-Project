Biological experimentation  
Governmental blasphemy
Bring forth this human experiment
To unleash their fury on the enemy
The swarm will descend like a plague
And cover the earth with our blood
Confronted by evil 
Initiate the fall of man

Theyâll keep on storming until thereâs nothing left to destroy
Manufactured killing machines
No sense of pain or remorse
An empty conscience with an unrelenting need to kill

Programmed in heart and mind
To serve the bidding of the master
Hell bent on world domination
Incapable of being conquered

Genocide the most effective way
To impose the will of the empire
A new breed designed to consume the world with fire

Thrown away and cast aside
A byproduct of a failed experiment
Buried beneath the surface lies an ugly truth
These creatures wonât relent until theyâve buried us all

Devoid of human emotion
A decadent uprising
As the clones become independent
The heart that mourns no longer exists
A soldier returns from the war
Believing that death endured his suffering
Yet the suffering has only just begun

Manufactured killing machines
No sense of pain or remorse  
An empty conscience
An unrelenting need to kill

The swarm will descend like a plague
Covering the earth
Confronted by evil 
Initiate the fall of man

Hope has died
Man has failed
Abandon faith and move onward
The killing fields littered and burned
No surviving the onslaught
This is the end of the line

Some say theyâve been sent from Hell
The chosen to destroy the human scum
Or maybe itâs God just killing us off once and for all
Unleash the swarm
