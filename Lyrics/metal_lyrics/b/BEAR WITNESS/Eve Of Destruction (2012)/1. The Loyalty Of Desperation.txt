Stranded
Blinded by the snow
Five souls now hopeless
Crippled by the cold

The hourglass is running empty 
Deranged by famine 
Hunger is all I know 

Like pigs to a slaughter
Whoâll be my first to die? 
A pick axe my ordnance
One blow to split you wide 
Madness begins 

Deranged by famine 
Hunger was all I knew
Every man for himself 
Forced to be born anew  

Stalking
Now you are the hunted
Primal instincts taking over
Starving, out for the kill 

As your bloods runs cold
Avert your eyes  
Ashamed of what Iâve done
I must survive
