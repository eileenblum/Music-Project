You canât escape
This is our nature
Struggling to fight infection 
All will crumble in our wake 
Born of chaos and malice
The fiercest evil surges through our veins

This is a war  
A war we are winning 
Infecting the mind to manifest your doom
Laying waste to your precious world 
Spreading like a plague
Engulfing all you know

Hunger is setting in 
On your brains we will feast
We canât be stopped 
Canât be killed
Tear the flesh from the bone 

Rip the eyes from their sockets
Entrails line the ground
Weâll never stop, never die
We will consume evolve and multiply       

Rising from the grave 
Undead slaves of pain
We will not fail 
We will prevail

Bring her to her knees 
Bring forth the decay
Weâll find another host  
The end of days

Burn it to the ground   
Let her waste away
Weâll find another home
The end of days

There is no hope 
No other way
These are the end of days
