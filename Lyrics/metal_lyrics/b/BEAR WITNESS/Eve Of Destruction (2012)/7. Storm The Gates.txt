In a world overwhelmed with corruption 
I find it hard to believe that you cowards live by morality 
That you wear on your fucking sleeve
You force-feed your philosophy 
But youâre not going to feed it to me 
Not then, not now, not ever
No truth is what it seems

Heaven is burning 
Why wouldnât it be?
Just take a look at us now
What should we believe?

We are at war with the world
Weâre bringing the fight to your front door
Thousands are marching now
Toward your eventual demise
They have been trained to kill
Get ready to die

In a world thatâs filled with deception 
I wonât believe religious lies
Iâll reject your bullshit rhetoric until the day I die
Why is it so impossible for so many to see?
You live a life of contradiction
Yet you are judging me

We are at war with religious control
You better make a call to your savior
Hundreds of millions pleading 
Canât stop whatâs in store
Youâre on your knees crying and bleeding
You might as well be praying to me
Because no one hears you as heaven burns

Feasting on our own infection 
Buying the lie that brings us torment
Set us free on by one 
Creation comes undone
And you can bet one thingâs for sure
The worst has yet to come
This is a message of hate 
Opening up your eyes
We remain defiant as heaven is burning
