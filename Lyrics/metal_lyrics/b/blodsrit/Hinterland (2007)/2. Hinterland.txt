I see a black hole in each and every face
A vulgar display of creation
I undivine the beings slow
And monumental stands the truth
Depravity and decadence is the only legacy
Inheritance is gone and death is for real
Let the blood flow
Let a massive raperoar sound
It might cleanse the corrupt
I speak for the free

Hinterland, I still breathe, I still curse the marker
Hinterland, hours of darkness, no fear, allegiance with the absolute, total bereavement

O how it purify
This celestial rape
Raised fists and bleeding mouths
All turned to you, against you
And nothing
Nothing will be the same
