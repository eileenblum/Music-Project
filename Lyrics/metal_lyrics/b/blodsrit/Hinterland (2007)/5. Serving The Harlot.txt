The guilt is laid upon me
The move to strike was mine
There are no reasons why
But you did cross my line
The shame is laid upon you
And the suffering is yours
A lamb dragged to the slaughter
But you did cross my line

Nemesis, my will ain't yours
Enemy of mine, I wish you harm and pain
So feed your lies into the raging wind
Set aflame the dreams of yours

So deliver all your hatred
Cast spells and curse upon my name
I do despise you from the root of my plagued heart
As sure as the day will turn to night

Nemesis, my will ain't yours
Enemy of mine, I wish you harm and pain
So feed your lies into the raging wind
Set aflame the dreams of yours

Desire not what you can never have
So let it wither away
