She danced like a snake 
And spat her poison
Directly at the sun
Burned, Skinned, Fleshless
Still with a grin
No one, Gods or Devils
Can measure her sin
She's the unknown soldier
A pitch black provocer
With the brightest of skin
I know her as hope
She moaned as I strangled
Her with a rope
Come measure my sin
Her voice and the choir of thousands
Will be silenced, one by one
This is nothing but tyranny
Nothing but joy
Nothing
And the nothing is the all
To seek a death
Where death is victory
And the final fall
