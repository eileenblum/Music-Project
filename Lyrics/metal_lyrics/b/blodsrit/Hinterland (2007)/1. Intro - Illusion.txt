I follow
The tattered entourage
Entering the mist and haze
I bow down like the first in line
Freeing the pipes
Setting the tune
For a darker gospel
No need for waiting
Thou the tourches are lit
I'll make another try
No needs at all
For the hands are delt
And a grim truth is staring in my face
This is the inverted truth
From shades to greay in a misty rain
No more slendering aournd
This time, thus time
Gods mime
Shepards loosing their cains and joyfully bow down
Thrails with up side down
Chosing to drink from the heavens
Marbel eyes keep staring back
Speaking in riddles
Passion is a darkside journey
Don't hesitate again
Hate is young

Shattered to pieces
No regrets
The womb hollers
This can't be undone

Let it begin
