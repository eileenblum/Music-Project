The ravens head turns,
The moon is in his eyes,
Releases his spirit in hollow cry,

He spread his satin wings,
My heart enters his midnights;
My spirit melts into the moon...
Into the dark

Lay open my life the raven cries,
Red rage at all that I have seen,
Dark sorrow at that I have missed,
Slow melting spirit folds swiftly into the mist

The ravens head turn,
My spirit in his eye,
Opens satin mouth,
He cries your spirit is mine,

In dark silence we left,
I die!

He spreads his satin wings,
My heart enters his midnights,
My spirit melts into the moon,
Dark silence...
I die
