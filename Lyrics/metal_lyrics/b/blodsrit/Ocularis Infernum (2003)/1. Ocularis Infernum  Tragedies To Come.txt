All that can be seen
Lifeless forms and tragedies
Dead trees naked,
Leafless in the storming winds of hate

When birds fall dead from bleeding skies
When the rivers float by in death

When the maggots does seek the light
And the sound of laughter has died

The icon of the Earth's destruction lies
Engraved in the heart of us all

Tragedies to come
Creation undone
Dark horizons
Prophecies foretold

All the forms of life
Has come to pass
Lost in seas of boiling blood

The icon of the Earth's destruction lies
Engraved in the heart of us all
