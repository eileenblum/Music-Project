In far distance
I behold thy flames
Consuming the creation of God
Thou appear in might
In the shape of a burning dragon

So rise impending doom
Unleash infernal hell

Upon the mountainside, we do stand
Greeting thy raging fires
Ruler of the roaring depths
Embrace us!

Once was hope... dreams and laughter
Lay to waste all that is held dearly

Smell of sulfur,
Stench of death
Failure of humanity,
Victory is ours to come

At the dawn of the apocalypse
Nothing does exist
We hail the glorious march of thy flames
All beauty will be found in death
