In the poisoned veins of my being
Lies infinite wisdom and secrets unveiled
Injected, knowledge of the earth consumed
Inhaled, the dust of an angel inside me

At dusk I fell from grace into infinity
Into the shadows of a dark divinity
Led and guided by the unlit stars
Drifting with the furious winds

Solitude, inside myself I am the ruler
Insanity, within my mind I crushed all faith
You may call me legion, 'cause inside these
Mortal walls of flesh -- we are many

At dusk I fell from grace into infinity
Into the shadows of a dark divinity
Led and guided by the unlit stars
Drifting with the furious winds

As shadows risen from the dust of heaven
The cure against reality
We rule the kingdom of my mind
A blurred abstract fantasy

Solitude, inside myself I am the ruler
Insanity, within my mind I crushed all faith
You may call me legion, 'cause inside these
Mortal walls of flesh -- we are many
