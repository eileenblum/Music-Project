[Music &amp; Lyrics; NazgÃ»l]

The pagan fires are burning with might
tormented remains of angels sodomized (with evil)
extacy gained through the burning of holy

for years I've been a deciple of thy darkened ways
I've carved the mark of sin into my flesh
for blaphemic glory I've shed blood
the powers of His might have painted my heart black

I spear the holy with perverted disease
I slay the angels and I curse their god
I am starvation, torment, agony, war and pain
I carry the banner of war with lust and pride

I use my body as a blasphemic altar
a host wherein demon soldiers dwell
wherein hellish fires burn
wherein nocturnal powers are unveiled
