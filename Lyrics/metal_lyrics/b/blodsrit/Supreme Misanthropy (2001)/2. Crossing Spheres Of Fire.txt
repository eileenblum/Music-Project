[Music &amp; Lyrics: NazgÃ»l]

mighty are the storms in which I breath
infernal are the powers I possess

like many times before
I ride a thought of insanity
but far away I see a dawn
a new dawn without a God

and if I'll manage to spread
these wings of an insane mind
and pass the border to another reality

then I can be free
and forever be my own God

a journey into the unknown
where only fires paints the skies
where suffering is the only real
where I will let my soul rest
forever...
