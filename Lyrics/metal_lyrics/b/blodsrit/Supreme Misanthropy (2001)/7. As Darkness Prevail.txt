[Music &amp; Lyrics: NazgÃ»l]

Diabolical Winds Blow Cold
Ravens Circle in the Nightly Skies
Summoned are the Souls of Damnation
As the Hour of Final War is Here

As Darkness Prevail
The Light will Fade
As Darkness Prevail
The Angels Cry

Spears Shall be Lifted Towards the Heavens
Swords Shall Penetrate the Hordes of Christ
As Our Legions of Darkness Prevail
And Wolves Howl Sadly Towards the Moon

As Darkness Prevail

Angels Cry in Shameful Despair
As our wizards cast their spells
Of the Darkest Evil Art
That Freezes the Lord of Light to Dust
