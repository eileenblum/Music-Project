[Music: NazgÃ»l Lyrics: Nordh]

In each path thee have ever wandered, 
the endless sorrow seem to be thy guiding star. 
No matter whom or what thou decide to follow;
failure keep scrathing thy soar back.
I am pain, I am the pain in thy every single breath.
I am the pain in thy every single step.
Vain desperation, the straw thou always choose to draw.
Vain desperation, the outcome of thy flaws.

The knowledge comes in death's relieve, 
let thyself in the stream of its glory believe. 
Thou might find thyself to die alone, 
but by the embrace of shadows thou art gathered 
amongst the friends of thy own. 
Why try to tame the beast of thy own beliefes, 
it shalt in solitude then yet live only to snare 
thy shattered dreams.

Social psycotic wolves grinning thier deceivful tune, 
can ever the peace of thy innerself, be of orderly form? 
Thou can not see, thou art by the shadows going blind. 
Embraced by the shadows, no will to excist. 
Emerging in thy colorful spectrum, seeming so naive to life. 
In this very moment, by the command of my hands, embracing shadows...
shalt send thee back to where roots art only to found rot.

Ye art born to wander as living form to be, 
though matters of outmost urgency (become thee not at all). 
Here within these blackened walls, shadows remain the same. 
To me the answer lies ahead, to thee they art beyond an neverending
horizon. 
Invoked by the shadows, the ultimate rebirth.
