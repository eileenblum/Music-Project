[Music: NazgÃ»l Lyrics: Vampyr]

The pentagram of my desires fullfillment
glows with inverted unholy inner force
baphomet, I draw your sign deep inte my flesh
enter me, and use my satanic body for war

Grant me a touch through Leviathan
set fire to my soul of Anti-Christ

God of the underworld, split open my black heart
fill me with unholiness and color my soul in hate

fever runs through my blasphemous being
I am my sacrificial gift to the goatlord
I cry out to thee, Baphomet, appear in me
create a storm of immolation, to kill God

possess me now and see all my hatred
I am a human torch of devestation

master of teh grim domains, I call your names
while I rape the angels of an impotent God
