[Music: NazgÃ»l Lyrics: Vampyr]

Star of Darkness, shine on me
let satanic shadows draw near
the hour of eternal evil here
and I am facing the black circle

see my blasphemous torture
that you lit with darkness
the witches must be gathered
and to stand in your light

star of evil winds, shine
let your shadow down on me
hear me cry out infernal names
near the circle of Ninnvam

the black eclipse draws closer
the witches are gathered
I dream fantasies of torture
and fornication before God

Diabolical night, dwell our souls
let your evil shadows draw nearer
to possess our immortal flesh
and to breed abominations
