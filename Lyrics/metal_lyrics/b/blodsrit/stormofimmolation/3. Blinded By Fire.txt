[music &amp; lyrics: NazgÃ»l]

Standing on a moonlit field
cold rain whipping my skin
warm blood draining me of life
oh, I feel my death draw near

The pale moonlight is reflected
in the steel that has opened my veins
my life is now fading away
into the deepest of shadows

now it is time to end this mortal life
I kneel and welcome my death
my eyes are blinded by the fire
which has been feared for centuries

here I will burn for my sins
still, there is nothing I regret
death is my deliverance
from this pain called living

with a sigh of relief I die
thrown into the raging fire
laughing as I burn
oh, dark ruler of the fallen
this is my final sacrifice
I grant thee my life
