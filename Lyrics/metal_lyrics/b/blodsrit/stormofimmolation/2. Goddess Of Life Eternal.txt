[Music &amp; Lyrics: NazgÃ»l]

You are the shadows dancing in the mist
You are the fire lightening the blackened skies
you goddess of sin
that have torched my soul

you are the raging wind blowing through the pagan lands
you are the lust and essence of my being
you goddess of death
that painted my heart with darkness

you are the hatred running through my veins
you are my hunger for the purest blood
you, goddess of vampiric evil
that granted me thy life eternal

You are the pale moonlight reflected in my eyes
you are the wolves howling, echoing through the night
you nocturnal goddess
that granted me demonic powers

you are the twilight in the infernal storms
you are the despain in every enemyÂ´s soul
you, goddess of war
that gave my life a meaning

you are the blasphemy in every sin
you are the pain called love that I cannot feel
you blasphemic goddes
that killed my emotions

oh you, goddess of the eclipse
that dwells within me
oh you, apocalyptical goddess
I worhip thee
