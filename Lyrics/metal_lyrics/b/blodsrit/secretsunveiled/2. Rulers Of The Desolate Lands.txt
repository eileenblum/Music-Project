[Music &amp; Lyrics: NazgÃ»l]

Night casts its shadows
to fiercely rule the desolate lands
Feared creations reborn at night
bringers of despair and devestation
lead thy legions forth!
embrace the world with melancholy!

oh night of beauty, I admire thee
choke the flame of heavenly love
drown the sun in everlasting fire
drown the sun in everlasting hate

yet... everything will end
nocturnal silence, shattered and lost
slaughtered by daylight
and my search for hell, a circle of chaos...
...neverending

I curse all light, while I cut the living flesh
holy blood leaves my being, I spit upon the gift of God
God, my final breath... 
...an abomination thrown at thee
