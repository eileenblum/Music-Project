A subtle texture subdued by continuous motion
to prove a from previously nonexistent
illuminated by one's own mark exclusive to specific motions
these are motions that can only be emulated in their truest form
by their creator
this cementing one's own individuality in the medium
which acts as the true root of human existence
in this state we can create and understand our nature
purified and devoid of clutter
that consumes free thought
the physical manifestation of betrayal
lies in the surface area
mentality with nothing to anchor to
there is no hope reaching for an epidemic
to strike the world and free myself
trapped by an ever-changing countenance
with a static mentality an abundance of lust
finds its way into the beautiful world
and taint the sexless whore
an illusion of hope beckons
who will answer its call
who would answer at all
on and on into the world
devoid of life never forget what they did to you
