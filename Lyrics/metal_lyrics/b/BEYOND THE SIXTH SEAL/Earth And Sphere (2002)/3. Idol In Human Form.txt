How could this be all that was held true now is burned under suns of madness
ruins of the beautiful structures graves of the fallen angels
the angels that sang your name
I am burning my memories they are too painful
I am burning my memories for they are killing me
like a blackened earth barren and desolate
so I find absence in harsh words why can't I remember
it as a moment of trust when the words that redeem
strike me with former thoughts
I relax my soul fire in the earth and in my heart
the relative circles and the intertwined majesty
the only way to enlightenment was through pain a birthing
ground for disaster when the words that redeem
strike me I know it can only be a dream
I felt her will to be reborn and daybreak
destroyed me wishing away the deeds of the pasts
throughout times in the earth maybe an end will erupt from the earth
and swallow us all let the eruption take place
I want all of it to burn to prove my dedication
I will prove myself worthy screaming for closing worlds to burn
it was always deep inside now it has died
