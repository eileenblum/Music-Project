A journey through a world of mental exhaustion
I seek a new path into your world once
I considered the weakness new ideas are open to extraction
there was a time when these words were unspeakable
but now the waves of unworthy cowardice bearers scour the grates of the most worthless
how could it all come to such a devastating end
that we could form a manner of speaking of knife wounds
I would like to get to know your wounds
and embrace the ashen remains of you these possibilities of impaled heats
impaling this heart of stone is impossible for at one time your medusan image
reflected upon it pure as the fallen snow undone by bloodshed
and when you walked that path of burning statues without hesitation without remorse
