Blackened earth and sphere pronounced stronger than before
it bleeds for all reason it bleeds for the earth and sun
I cannot recall the choices that taste of relief
feel the essence choices made out of pure lust
dull the concerns for the universe is lost will I join the circles of madness
or will I nurture the ghost the illusion of repetition
is no illusion to emanate for earth and sphere wasted
flesh and the sphere of light combining the earth and
its retribution and I become the signs of lust dawn of war
and flesh-ridden spheres scourges of truth and if so it ends
I grind the statues in my madness
I have forgotten how this fells but
I cannot learn from ashen wounds and corruption incarnate
banner of falseness fire-cleansed flesh dull the
concerns for the universe is lost warring mentalities will hear me
