Focus in the ourward direction the chaos direction
I expand in mental conquest and burst like a spore
cloud into the populous no destiny too great
an infinite journey in all directions
look to the south and recover the worthlessness
all will feel the force emanating from my carcass
a fall of mankind's everything no one will understand
nothing is left dissolved by the immortal conscious with burning
hands clasped around the birthing apparatus and spilling from its convulsing tubes
I worm into a hiding spot and worms join me in death only enlightenment
the flesh a tome of strength and the mind beyond the limits
destroy the body and embrace the universe to the reprisal of stars and spirit
