Awaken from dreams that are not my own
to experience a mass of expulsion
wars pouring from an empty figure
the spirit of time is abandoned
I walk the earth searching for stars
I blake the victims for what they've lost forever
in wails are true feelings trapped only to search
beyond pass over the one who frees you and shun the essence of life
to escape the air like a bird of prey is to live forever
I will not leave you behind
