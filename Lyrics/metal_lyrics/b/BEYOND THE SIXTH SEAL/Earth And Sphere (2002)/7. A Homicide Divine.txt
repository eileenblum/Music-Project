Disgust drives deep into my flesh and the lightest of day lifts me into your longing
to live surpassing our standards and once again falling into your final branded
the weak I fell it burn I see the fire beneath you eyes your hate for you leaves
these scars bleeding imprisoned myself in your narcissism
I am surrounded by words that mutilate my mind
and beneath my skin your lies clot within turning my insides
cold envision your blood streaked across the tiles drying
like paint around my hands battered I lie on the floor as a child coming closer
to death I wonder what makes me chant conquered
you've left my aspirations I fall with your help we abolish creation
your hatred is for yourself your rain lashes hard upon my shoulders
I fall to my knees wishing that you could see yourself
