A potent wing lies helpless away as a burden
a potent wing lies worthless forever seen as an anchor
accept the world as a war of the ages to expose the softest and embrace

nothing rears are scorned with zealous rage emotions are hidden away
a breath taken is a dollar lost and madness mistaken for ambition
hordes of whores tear through the symptoms
like maggots upon an early grave
moral boundaries smashed to nothing
worlds of grief collide
endless seas of heroes died
flood the earth forcing the illusion away
for the shortest time a potent wind flows breathless
spreading sickness to human crop
a potent wind blows callous true being lies in ruin
