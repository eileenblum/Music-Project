I've crumbled to this too far
My life has come to this so far
The darker side of me
Comes and goes as the sea
The night is just the same so far

You were the fire to light my way
You were my light my night my day

Standing in the window eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memories
Will leave your spirit soon
The burning never dies the calm is lost inside
This life won't set me free so far
