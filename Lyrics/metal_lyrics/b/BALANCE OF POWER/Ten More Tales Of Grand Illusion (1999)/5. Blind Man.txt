There's a place that's soft and warm it's a shelter from the storm
There's a whisper in the air if I call you will you hear

Pull me in I'm a drowning man breath in all of the love you can
Pull me in your arms again one more long cold mile to cross

When the blind man calls tonight remember your darkest hours
When the blind man calls tonight uncover the love that's in your hands

Whisper nightime into day blow the dark clouds far away
Be my island show me sun give me sand to walk upon

Make the dawn come around again silver sun burning through the rain
Make me new make me see again touch the hand then heal the heart
