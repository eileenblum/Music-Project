Slow down pour a glass
Of what gets you through the day
Send all your senses far away
Slow down I'll whisper words
You don't want to hear
It's too late
But it's now or never

How many times can one heart bleed
Spread your golden wings and fly
A subtlety change but change indeed
Brings me to the final lullaby

After savage tears
Can you take a breath when there's nothing left
After savage tears
When all the life is gone when it's really gone

So far satisfaction hides away from me
Maybe you're the remedy
Oh you are closer now to no return
One heart slows and one grows faster

Close your eyes and go to sleep
Send a flickering goodbye
Closing down your soul for keeps
Feeds a need and keeps me so alive

Let me ask you one more question
Even though you can't answer me
Was the euphoria so deep
Could you feel the savage silence
Why don't you answer me
You never answer me
