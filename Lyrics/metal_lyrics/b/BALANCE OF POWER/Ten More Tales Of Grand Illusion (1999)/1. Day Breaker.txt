Come to the edge of reason embrace the sun in place of night
Come to your senses sometime never witness an understanding
Before the dawn surrenders light

Damn the dawn for turning my world red before too long my perfect night is over
Damn the dawn tomorrow is calling again before too long

Enter the realms of madness open the doors and close your eyes
Entertain thoughts of endless wonder call for the visionary
Call for the one who reads the skies

Damn the dawn it takes the deepest breath away before too long another night is over
Damn the dawn turn your world your own sweet way before too long

Day breaker are you the silent sinner day breaker so unpredictable
Day breaker live on and on forever day breaker give up your forgiven dawn

You are the breaker of my promises do you have something I can keep
You are the keeper of my yesterdays give me something that I need
