Go wash your conscience clean the way it's never been
The eyes and ears surround you
Hesitation takes it's turn anticipation burns
Enough to light the way before you

Silence is broken into nothing more than lies
Just another token telling just for the surprise

Ten more tales of grand illusion
Ten more tales of life

Beyond your inner soul the heart controls the mind
The mind was made to wonder
And if nothing more is said when all your truths are read
The masses are left to ponder

Another empty promise another empty lie
Glorify imagination try to justify
