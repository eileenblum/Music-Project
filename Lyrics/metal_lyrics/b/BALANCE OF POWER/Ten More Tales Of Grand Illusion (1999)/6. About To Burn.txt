Why am I taking all your time
All I want is what was mine
Am I talking to your inner feelings
Time didn't conjure up a cure
Is there anybody more
I can't turn away forever

Who's to lose who's to win
It's all about the state you're in
Who's to know

It's all about to burn wind has changed the fire has turned
It's all about to burn just like it never started
It's all about to burn take away my better days because
It's all about to burn

Nothing's for nothing so I've heard
There's a reason this occurred
I'm not talking 'bout your superstition
Easy or not the time has come
Face the new or turn and run
I'm not llable for your condition
