It's dark so dark I've been lying alone for days
It's cold so cols I'm alive can I still be saved

Have you ever been lonely have you ever been that far
Are you sure of the meaning do you know do you care who you are

Too far so far there's a journey I just can't make
From here to your heart is a million miles away

Can you feel the confusion can you reach that far
Under no disillusion will you ever get back to the start

Close your eyes you're falling under the spell
Look inside you're falling under the spell
Close your eyes you're falling under the spell
Look inside you're falling under the spell

And it goes that far every breath knows where you are
