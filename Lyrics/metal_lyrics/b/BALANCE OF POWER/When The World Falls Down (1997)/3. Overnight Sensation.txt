One more time, I'm sitting here thinking,
How you rule my world,
But still draw the line,

[chorus]
Someone said that your here and your gone,
And that's all that matters,
Someone said that I'm blind to the fact,
And my heart got shattered,

[chorus]
I'm just another night,
Overnight sensation,
Overnight sensation,
So tell me I'm right,
Overnight sensation,

Am I so easy to please, or the only answer,
You always love to tease, tease me til dawn,
You always move me like a mountain,
I don't care why,
The buck stops here,
Let's make it clear,
No more goodbyes,

[bridge]

[chorus]
