I'll introduce myself as someone that you know, I sink your skin,
I captivate your soul,
A sudden sense of being empty comes to mind, and as I suck you dry
I swear you'll never find,

I'd hold the gates of heaven, open on my own,
I'll walk through fields of fire,
Just to let you know,

I'm taking calculated risks at your expense, and in a moment
I would come to your defence,

I'd ride the wildest horses, I'd sell my soul, I'd burn a thousand torches,
Just to let you know,

[chorus]
If your world falls down,
I'll be your balance of power,
When it all falls down,
I'll be there 'til the end,
If you'll only be my friend,

If I'm a double standard, standing on my own,
Then all you have to understand is all I know,

I'd stop the world from turning on my own,
I'd stop the sun from burning,
Just to let you know,

[chorus]

"It's all a misunderstanding, a misguided chance of fate,
And it's in the lap of the gods,
If I never understand, the rules, the real, the wrong,
Then I'm walking blind, blind in the sun"

[chorus]
