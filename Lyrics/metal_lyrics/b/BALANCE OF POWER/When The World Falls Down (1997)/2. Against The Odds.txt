Try, Yeah I'll try,
To overcome this hurt inside,
What about tomorrow?
Will I feel your love still follow me?
Over and over, I keep seeing you,
I keep seeing you and I know,
If we're worlds apart, I'd never let you go.

[bridge]
They tell me the oceans are too wide,
But what they're trying to say,
Is taking it's toll deep inside,
I'm starting to slide,

[chorus]
I never thought I'd see your face again,
I need to feel the love that I thought was lost,
I never thought I'd see your face again,
I'm still in love with you,
Against the odds,

Here, right here,
Is all you ever need to find,
Knock down the fences,
Lay bare surviving senses,
Can I be broken,
I keep seeing you, keep seeing you and I don't know,
If I could touch you know,
Could I let you go,

[bridge]
They tell me the road only goes so far,
But, what they're trying to say,
Is twisting and tearing at my heart,
I'm falling apart,

[chorus]
