Feel free to be all you want to be,
And feel the pain when your wrong,
I believe in your own destiny,
You wrote the story all along,
So turn the pages,

To make your mark in a world that does not care,
It's like a naked flame in a storm,
Take the spark and hold it if you dare,
Feel the fire you control,
Turn the pages,

[chorus]
Can't close the book,
(Can't close the book)
'Til you've finished the story,
Can't live your life,
'Til your dreams alive,

Turn around and your out there on your own,
Stand your ground, your the driver,
And giving up a thought you never owned,
You're made of stone,
A survivor,
Turn the pages,

[chorus]
