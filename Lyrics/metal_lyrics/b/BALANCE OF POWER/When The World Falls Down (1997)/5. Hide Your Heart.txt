Come a little closer baby, by my side,
Look into my eyes now,
And tell me what you see,

Loving you, it seems so hard to do, you see,
You're all I ever wanted,
All I ever needed in my life,
All night long, waiting for the dawn so I can,
Take you by the hand girl,
Make you understand,
Yeah understand,

[chorus]
You can't hide when the loving starts,
You can't hide your heart,
You can't stop when the loving stops,
You better hide your heart,
Hide your heart,
Hide your heart,
Hide your heart,
Hide your heart,

Losing you I never wanted to because,
You're everything I asked for,
Everything I prayed for, pray for me,
A twist of fate, could take it all away,
So tell me that you'll stay now,
Never lock your love away from me,
Away from me,

[chorus]

Hide your heart, hide your heart,

[chorus]

Hide your heart, hide your heart,
