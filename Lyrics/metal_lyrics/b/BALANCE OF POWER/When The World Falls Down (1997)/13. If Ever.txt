[Bonus track from Japan]

Do you see me how I see you?
Could you walk for one day in my shoes?
I'd like to be inside of you.
Through your eyes the world looks colder.
A sudden fear of empty space.
Can't shake the memory of you face.
I cannot hide, I know I've tried,
Maybe one day you'll come back I cried,

[Bridge:]
Remember the Love
Remember the pain,
Will things ever be the same,

[Chorus:]
If ever you need someone,
I'll be right here waiting,
If ever you need someone,
Baby call me, call me yeah,
The more I learn the less I know,
The less I know is better for me,
Making sense is no defence,
Losing you won't set me free,
You disappeared without a trace,
Can't shake the memories
of your face,
Now it's up to you,
I'm in your hands,
Bring back my heart and if you can,

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Guitar solo]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Remember the love...
