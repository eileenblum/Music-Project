Seems like a years gone by,
When I was lost out in the cold,
That day when you caught my eye,
I got caught in a whole new world,
I always smile when I think of that time,
I guess I always will,
And here you are still mine all mine,
Let me tell you how I feel,

[bridge]
Remember this,
Take a look around,
Look at what we've found,
Remember this,

[chorus]
These are the days,
We will be talking about forever,
These are the days,
We will always remember,

Seasons change and time goes on,
Only one thing stays the same,
Nothing come close and never will,
We're getting stronger day by day,
Some feelings you never touch,
Yeah and some are searching still,
And here you are still mine all mine,
And did I tell you how I feel?

[bridge]

[chorus]
