I'm always searching for a reason,
Searching for a reason why,
Why I ever thought I'd leave you,
Who am I to change your life,

Now that you're gone,
I just can't feel without you,
Is it too soon, too soon to cry,

[chorus]
Don't you wait until tomorrow,
Don't you wait,
Don't you wait until our love is over,
Don't you wait until tomorrow,
Don't you wait until it's too late for love,

Now I'm lying here without you,
I can't get you off my mind,
Life without you is so empty,
How could I be so unkind,

Take my hand,
Is it too late for sorry?
Why can't it be
Just you and me?

[chorus]
