Do I know you? Do you know me?
I can't stand this hazy in between,
What would you do, How would it be?
Is it black or white or technicoloured dreams?
Never underestimate the power of the silent man,
Go before it gets too late,
Do it now while you still can,

The walls around me are getting closer,
I can't breathe, can't exercise my mind,
The signs surround me, they say its over,
Now I see that I've been walking blind,
If I stumble, if I fall, at least I'll die by own hand,
When there's nothing left at all,
Maybe you will understand,

[chorus]
Well here's something for your head,
Nothing lasts forever,
Nothings carved in stone,
No matter how I try,
Something for your head,
Remember all I told you,
Nothings carved in stone,
Well I lied,

What's the story, love or hate?
Well it's cut and dried that's how it's always been,
Say it slowly but say it straight,
'Cos I'm sick and tired of wasting all my dreams,
So I finally give in and walk away a better man
And I finally begin to turn the boy into a man,

[chorus]
