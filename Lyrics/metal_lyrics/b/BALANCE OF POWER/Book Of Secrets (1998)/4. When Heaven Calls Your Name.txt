-And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes and death will be no more.
No mourning, no outcry nor pain be anymore.

Suddenly it's colder, suddenly the sun has gone
But if the real world's over then your life has just began

And if I promise not to cry, will you promise not to die
Live on inside of me you stay forever young forever young

[chorus]
When heaven calls your name
Your spirit stays alive
Safe in my heart
When heaven calls your name
You are free and you can fly
Here in my heart

And if time can heal the pain 
Then I won't be healed again
If your light went out too soon
Then I'll burn the flame for you
Burn the flame for you

[chorus]
