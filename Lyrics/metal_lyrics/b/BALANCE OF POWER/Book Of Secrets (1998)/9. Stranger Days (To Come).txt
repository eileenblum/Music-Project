It's a personal feeling how your world is turning
You can blind your eyes, but, you decide
And something is aching
And your world is breaking down

There's a whole lot more than this
That you're dying to resist
There's a whole lot more than this

[chorus]
There are stranger days to come
When all the rivers run dry
There are stranger days to come...

You can almost taste it,
But you can replace it
There's a homegrown madness going on
Get to know your feelings
The emotion can explode

There's a wider world I hear
Let your conscience disappear
With an easy ride from here

[chorus]

There's no sun in the sky forever
I see stranger days than these
In my heart in my dreams
When the world stops spinning me forever...

Forever
On and on and on and on and on
Forever, forever
Forever, and ever, forever, forever
I see stranger days...
