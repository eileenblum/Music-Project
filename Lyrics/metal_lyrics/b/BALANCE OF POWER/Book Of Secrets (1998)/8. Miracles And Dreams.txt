So much for reaping what you sow
Isn't time the enemy again
Believing cuts deeper than you know
Never was a natural believer in the end

Through these eyes
Images and stories
Left unheard, slowly burn
In these skies are centuries of promises
Unlearned never learned

Holding out what's coming in
Keeps the heart from burning

[chorus]
With those miracles and dreams
Taking all my senses and colouring between
Miracles and dreams
How can I get by without the harmony within, do you know
Tomorrow could be taken from your hand,
Yes it can

After this wave your world goodbye
And never kiss your love again

If I'm strong enough
And live long enough
I still believe in those

[chorus]

-The distinction between past, present and future is only an illusion.

[chorus]
