You won't find me laughing,
I don't think I can cry
I'm mentally wasted and you're the reason why
You won't find me guilty,
You won't find me wrong
You won't find me home
Cos I'm already gone

[bridge]
Sleeping deeper
But I still wake up on the wrong side of the bed
Sleeping deeper I'm sleeping deeper
But it's way too soon I can't sleep in the middle yet,
When it's over it's over

[chorus]
I'm walking on top of the world
and dancing on the memories of the past
I'm walking on top of the world
The trouble with forever is forevers made to last

I'm suddenly flying, I'm finally sure
cos all that you left me is stronger

[chorus]

-Einstein overturned present reality by adding a fifth part, a fifth dimension.
The depth between good and evil, the greatest divide of all.
