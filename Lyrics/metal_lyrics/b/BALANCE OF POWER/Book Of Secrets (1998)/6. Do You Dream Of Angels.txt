Now your sleeping now your still
Softly tell you how I feel
And if you dream a thousand years
I still be here, forever here...

Hold me in your sleepy eyes
Hold me closer, whisper me goodnight
Let the moon light have it's way through the silence
I can hear you say

[chorus]
Do you dream of angels
Well I do when I'm dreaming of you
Do you dream of angels
I do when I'm dreaming of you
I dream of angels when I see you

Fill me with your symphony
Overtures of love in harmony
In your silent journeying
Take me with you...Can I hear you say

Now your sleeping now your still
Softly tell you how I feel

[chorus]
