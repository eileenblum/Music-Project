-Make secret these words and seal up the book until the time of the end.

Too many lines to read between
Too many minds are coming close to the
extreme
Are you the named are you pure
Dare you believe in something never seen before

[bridge]
Secrets soon to be secrets soon to be told 
Take another look at the open book
Secrets soon to be secrets soon to be told 
Take another look at the open book

[chorus]
The book of secrets
The words of wiser men than I
The book of secrets
The code is falling falling from the sky
Falling from the sky, falling from the sky

Is this the dawn of something new
The clock is ticking and there's nothing I can do
In place of guessing what's to come
Unlock the secrets close your eyes
And kiss the sun

[bridge]

[chorus]

At the close of the twentieth century,
We are threatened
With the kind of chaos that
The world has never faced before.
We have built weapons 
That can destroy human civilisation in a single day,
These weapons may be on the loose.

[bridge]

[chorus]

-But neither in heaven nor earth was there a single one able to open the scroll or look into
it. And as for you men of vision everything will become like the words of the book that has been
sealed up.
