A change of heart is no excuse to turn me loose
And I play the part but the fool in me could never hear you

Fools love
My fingers ache from holding on
Fools love
The clouds that hide your love are gone

[chorus]
It's not over until it's over
Flying in the face of love
It's not over until it's over
Power of the heart is strong enough

All of the time
Feeling wheels are turning over now
Read the signs
There's so much more to rediscover

Say when 
It's easy to replace one more
Say when
The answer is worth waiting for

[chorus]
