Lend me your lonely faces sheltering in darkened places,
The reckoning is at hand
Unchain tomorrows rain lets wash the evil far away
The world will have to understand

Too dark to see
Cover me with everything too dark to see...and...

Shelter me, the cold wind of illusion's crying
Shelter me, keep me warm oh
Shelter me, the underside of evil's coming
Shelter me, from it all

Here in the Shallow waters, cooling in the waves at wonder
How can this be all bad
It's all the same, if you are blinded by the spell you're under
Too bad, it's too bad

My eyes are red,
Ultimately everybody's eyes are red...so...

Shelter me, the cold wind of illusion's crying
Shelter me, keep me warm oh
Shelter me, the underside of evil's coming
Shelter me, from it all
