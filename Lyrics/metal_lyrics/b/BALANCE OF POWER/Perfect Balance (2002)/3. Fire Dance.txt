I woke up still dreaming, the air was static
My eyes can't see, my senses turn to automatic
So I dream again,
The waves have reached the shore
So I dream again,
And wait for something more

No sign, no answer
I'm looking at mountains, but I'm too close
No sign, no wonder
I'm looking at every way to break the circle

Dance me to the fire dance
Following steps in the sand
Dance me to the fire dance
All hell has come loose, the future is out of my
hands...not what I planned

I'm stolen, I'm broken, I'm changing colors
The veil has gone and so has everything that matters
Come and hear the song
Of silence in the haze
Can you hear the song
The colors that it makes

No sound, no images
This must be Darkness by another name
No sound, no answer
Some kind of Evils come to carry us away into the...

Firedance
Following steps in the sand
Dance me to the fire dance
All hell has come loose, the future is broken
Dance me to the fire dance
Following steps in the sand
Dance me to the fire dance
All hell has come loose, the future is not what I planned
