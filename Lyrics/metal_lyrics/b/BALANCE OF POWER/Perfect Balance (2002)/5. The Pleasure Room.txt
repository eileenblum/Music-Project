No one needs to know...
I'm in league with strangers, I'm talking all the time... How's the weather?
When I need the danger, I find it every time....Come whatever...

Cause I'm damned if I'll be chastised for my healthy, Wholesome pastimes
And I pray that I'll remain forever more.... In the Pleasure Room....

No one needs to know...

Is the Weakness winning? Scared of what you'll find....Pain or Pleasure
If your dream are damning, are you the forgiving kind....for Now, Forever....

All at once I feel the weight of what I've seen and how I've prayed
That one day I'll be safe, forever more....In the Pleasure Room....

No one needs to know....

As I weep inside my prison cell, I keep alive my private hell
I pray that I'll remain forever more.... in my Pleasure Room....
