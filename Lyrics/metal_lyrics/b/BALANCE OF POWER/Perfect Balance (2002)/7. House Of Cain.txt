Look inside those crazy eyes
A blackened, hazy mind
Think you've found a secret power?
Mmm....better close those eyes

(Feels so good) Living under city towers
(Feels so right) Fallen apples rotting under
(Feels so good) Warming under sunny
summer shys...
Open up the real world, crawl inside

Worshipping the house of Cain
Poisoning your life away
Worshipping the house of Cain
Poisoning your life, poisoning your
life away....

Once you had a real name,
Now you caught up in life's little pains
Never thought of asking why?
Wake up, come and kiss the sky

(Feels so good) Underneath the dying flowers
(feels so right) Eye to eye with all that thunder
(Feels so good) Thinking of chemical suicide
Turn out the lights and crawl inside
Worshipping the house of Cain
Poisoning your life away
Worshipping the house of Cain
Poisoning your life, poisoning your
life away....
