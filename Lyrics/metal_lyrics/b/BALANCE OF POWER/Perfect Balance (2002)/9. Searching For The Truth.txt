There's no mistake, there's no regret,
what I know it there's no room for changing
All I own is one degree
that's in life, that's in me
This is fast becoming my philosophy
Feel the truth...the unmistaken, unclean truth
and see the truth...my eyes are open wide
'Cause I'm stronger now,
I last much longer now
But I still hunger now,
So I'm Searching for the Truth again
I'm older now
and I feel bolder now
but I'm no wiser now
So I'm Searching for the Truth again
Sudden changes make their mark
this fascination has no explanation
even now I feel the sting
somethings wrong with everything
Check your pulse you could be stone cold dead now
