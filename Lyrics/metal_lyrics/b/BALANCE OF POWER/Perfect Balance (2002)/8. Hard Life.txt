The days of a child are over,
The fields are gone
There's nobody there, who knows your name
Remember the games you played
How you laughed at everyone
It's a shame, how can time
take away, what is mine
I'm gonna bury the memories
One by one by one....

Anyone here who feels the same?
(Who here feels the same)
You can shake it around inside
But it always comes out just the same

The rivers flows to wash away a Hard Life
A cool, cool breeze can empty out your soul
Another sunset comes to calm a Hard Life
So kiss your past goodbye and let it go

Beyond the new horizon, beyond it all
There's a heart, theres a soul
There's a part of us all
That's gonna carry the memories
On and on and on....
