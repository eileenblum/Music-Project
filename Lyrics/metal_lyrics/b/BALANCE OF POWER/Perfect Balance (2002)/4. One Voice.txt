Do you hear the sound between these walls
Can you see the shadows as they
Crawl around and fall around
Here comes the velvet covered scream,
Here comes the never ending
Wall around, it's all around.

There's one small voice
And there's a never ending diamonds in the sky
One voice, for each and every one
There's one small voice
And this world could turn blood red if you let it fly
One voice and you're the one

Cover up the lost, alone and dead
There's a time and place where
No one cares about, why you care about
Wipe away the tears, the blood, the sweat
It's all so clear now there's
no cloud around, no clouds around

There's one small voice
And there's a never ending diamonds in the sky
One voice, for each and every one
There's one small voice
And this world could turn blood red if you let it fly
One voice and you're the one
