[Written by: Southern &amp; Ritchie]

Sit down beside me let me feast upon your dreams
You can fill up all your emptiness from here
Tell me all about everything and ask me what it means
'cos I'm loaded with the things you want to hear

And if I see the invisible yeah I know it's impossible

It's a necessary evil

Underneath the pin pricked blanket if the purple sky
You can still make out the shadow of the stone
How high can feelings run with crutches by your side
And how brightly do you burn when you're alone?

And I feel the invisible yeah I know it's impossible
And I see the invisible yeah I know it's impossible

It's a necessary hunger
It's a necessary pain
It's a necessary craving
It's a necessary evil
Evil
It's a necessary lusting
It's a necessary bleeding
It's another kind of healing
It's a necessary evil
Evil

It's a necessary evil
Evil is all I have.
