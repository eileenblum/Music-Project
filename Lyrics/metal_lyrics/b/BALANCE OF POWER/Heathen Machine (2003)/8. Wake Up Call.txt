[Written by: Southern &amp; Ritchie]

What about here and now
The ever afters sitting on the big reveal
It's all about one defining moment
And I'm damned if I can pass it by
It's just the way I feel

Imitations of life are all I see
You'll be screaming at the walls
'til you break the crystal ball
Imitations of life are all I see
Random acts of circumstance
Are staining me draining

This is your wake up call don't let it get away
This is your wake up call it's been so long
This is your wake up call now open up your mind
This is your wake up call

Better than dead you are
Another day has come
And still you're staring at the stars
Maybe you missed your supernova
Like you missed the truth come over you
And now your ass is ours

Imitations of life are all I see
As blackness chokes your atmosphere
Is that crystal ball still clear?
Imitations of life is all I see
You only got one chance one chance to be.
