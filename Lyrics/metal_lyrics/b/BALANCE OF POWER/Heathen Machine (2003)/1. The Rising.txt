[Written by: K &amp; Hicks]

Light turns to darkness hope to despair
The machine is rising the machine is rising
For me the light was so real a scar so hard to heal
Deception graced from blazing heavens eternal sin 
Time stands forever unending dreams
Never Know the endning this is my fractured life
The machine is rising the machine is rising from within

Heathen machine...
