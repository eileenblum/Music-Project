[Written by: Ritchie, Southern &amp; K]

Images of the world now make no sense
Noises fused without a warning
Open eyes it makes no difference
There's nothing there for me to see

Hear me forgive me
No answers can release your sorrow
Slowly drifting towards a stormy sea

I'll hold you stronger
Stay with me horizon's star
It bleeds from within you
And reveals what's left so far

Follow the dream
Unveil the secret fate within you
Slowly drifting taken away
Reach out for me

Just beyond the rain I'll be waiting
What I am trying to say
Is goodbye
Goodbye

Did you know just before you go
There's a deja-vu here
If I let you go now will you swear
You'll never leave again

Just before you leave
