[Written by: Southern &amp; Ritchie]

Enter a land where the sky still bleeds
Empowered to turn every mountain into sand
And fears to dreams
Falling from grace bears a price I've learned
Blinded by this you can dance in electric fields
Where the fires still burn

Still waiting holding on
Colder than grey colder than grey
Still waiting holding on
Drawn like a moth to the flame

Frozen utopia's slowly steaming
Only the touch of an angel can ever heal
The silent screaming
Sacrifice all of your hidden demons
Promise me this
Will you wade through the clouds of calm
And come to no harm?

Some things just have to be
What's meant for you will not pass you by
Some things are meant to be
Under and over the sky

The eyes of the world
Addiction is priceless they're watching and waiting
The eyes of the world
The blood that is raining is so entertaining
The murder in the skies is calling you calling calling
The eyes of the world
Addicted to pain and so blind to the warning.
