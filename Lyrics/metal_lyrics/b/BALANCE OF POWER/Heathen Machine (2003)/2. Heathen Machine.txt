[Written by: Ritchie]

Find a way or make a way.
There's nothing sacred
Cut me off so amputate
What you created
Nothing here is made of stone
Where's it all gone wrong
Tear up the plastic corners
One by one now

Enter the kindred where have you been?
Welcome kindred come on in

Heaven stained is screaming lullabies around me
Catch my spirit freaking as it dies without me
Once inside there's nothing left
To activate your soul
The armoured hearts are melting
One by one now

Breath out so I can breath you in heathen machine
Heathen machine like no man can ever be
Now long before your walls fall in heathen machine
Without heart and soul
You're dead to the world
Stay heathen machine

I'm drawn towards the enemy
Leaning in in spite of me
Without a soul there's hollow hollow ground
Breaking up in front of me
Tearing the whole thing down.
