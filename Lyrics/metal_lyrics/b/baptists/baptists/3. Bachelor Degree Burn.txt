Blank pages filled with professor's wishes
Bodies stacked learning useless and pointless words
Notes made for only one purpose
Brains tampered slowly, towards the majority

Paying into you paving my future will be the only lesson that I learned

Readings pushed forward, leaving no thought
All insight hindered
Bachelor degree burn
Bachelor degree burn

Paying into you paving my future will be the only lesson that I learned

Tuitions payed out to thrones
Governing all you'll know
Tuitions payed out to thrones
Governing all you'll know
