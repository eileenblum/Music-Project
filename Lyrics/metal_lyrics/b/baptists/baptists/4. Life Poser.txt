Can't fucking see the signs
Change ahead, broken lines
Moved forward by threat
Marketed and in debt
Forced to pick a side
Team player, dream regret
You will age with time
More is less, you're confined

With branches of options; your condo's a seed
Perpetual longing; a life as a weed
With forests of progress; opportunity knocks
With sands as a fortress; turn pebbles to rocks

What a time to be this age
What a time to be this young
