Drunk
Fights
Scolded and scalded and beaten
High times
Spent wasted/away
Hotels
Brothels
Alone with nothing but air
Court dates
Mold plates
Cuddle your bedbugs for warmth

Punch you goodnight
I am your mom
Listen to me
Feel my wrath
Stay cold
Drown in your bath
I was born once too
It's just part of every day life
Punch you goodnight
I am your mom
Listen to me
You are my son

You're just a shit from my womb
You're just a punk in your room
no one can take you from me
Mine
you're just a shit from my womb
You're just a punk in your room
No one can take you away
No one can take you from me
