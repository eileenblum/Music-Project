They multiplied
From a seed
Deeply sowed
By office'd beings
Blossoming
Gradually
Into their
Moulded dream

Think tank breed

Bastardized
And whittled down
By focus groups'
Empty hounds
Becoming what
Those who sit
At round tables
Fucking wished

Think tank breed

Casted by avarice
Forged by greed
Shit out on office desks
Empty
