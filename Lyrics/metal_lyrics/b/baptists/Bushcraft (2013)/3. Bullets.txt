Wire taps
To neural finds
Bridging gaps
To his mind
Knowledge quests
Sourced by ghosts
Keyboards scrolled
From the host

He's esoteric, he's abstruse,
He's enigmatic and aloof

His filtered feelings stay in his head
He can hear them breathing
He won't shed

He can hear them breathing in his head
He can feel their hold

A bullet for your thoughts, my friend
And pennies for your brain

Can't get it out
He's not bleeding
