When you glare through your eyelids
When you scream through your teeth
When you plunge from your island
Don't forget to breathe
When you bleed through your armour
When you cough out disease
Overcome your disorder medicate your defeat
When you trip on your souls
When you reek of deceased
Don't protect your odor
Wring you towel out on me
When you punch out your problems
Then you vent with your feet
Fill my ears with your torment
Then run from peace

Your eyes fill the fucking roots that
Suck up the time that I will never live

Your roots soak up my fun
