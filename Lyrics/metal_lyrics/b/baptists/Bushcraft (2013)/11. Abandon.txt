He don't feel it
When he bleeds
He still wants to
But just sees

What flows from his arms
It's left for me

And his problems
They're not his
And my problems
They're not his

No solace
No needs

But what was once intact
An internal shield
Set to deflect
His darkened deals
Has now become
A flooding gate

To intake
Void's embrace
Chaos plagues
Impulse praise

He wants cold and
He wants pain

In the eyes of his father
He is a martyr
In the mind of his mother
He is a struggle

He wants cold
