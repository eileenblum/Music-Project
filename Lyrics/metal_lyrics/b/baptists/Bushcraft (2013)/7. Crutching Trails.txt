Weak core obsessions
Life skills are nulled
Directed by faceless
Your path is foretold

If you are okay crutching rails mad by faith
I'll be okay stomping my own

You're asked for your earnings
To be continually blessed
These funds are not helping
Just building their nest
Your kneecaps are yours
Your morals aren't yours
A slave who prays
To do his own chores

If you are okay crutching trails made by faith
I'll be okay stomping my own

Burning my own
