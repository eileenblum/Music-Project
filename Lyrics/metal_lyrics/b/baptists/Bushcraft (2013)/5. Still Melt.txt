The ride stops
I get out
It's cold walls now
And a drought
Blow out a candle
And inhale
I get high from it
I get born
I tape feathers
To my bones
I can fly now
More like float
Catch custs of wind, kid it helps
My feet scraping
Evergreens
Your fingers breaking
Reaching the sky
Smoke more candle
And catch drifts
Guided by currents
In the air

And I feel like I am done

I'm all warm now
No thoughts
Swimming in the rain
Falling like death
