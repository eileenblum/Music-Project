Bullshit lies
Breaking skin
Homemade bombs
Blasting us thin
Terror threats
Made by friends
Mental debts
For retailed trends

I don't care what you fucking say
Won't lose my time over this
Won't lift your veil of dirt
Will forget your / you exist

Graves dug with your tongue
Missiles shot from your lips
Mortars as molars and spit
Watching me drink every sip
Counting the hits from my fist
Vise-grips on vices and slips

Volcanic ash, it lines your gums
You spew it out, it silhouettes where we have stood
A hollow shell is all that's left
The charred remains of what we will never have
