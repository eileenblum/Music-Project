Why did I have to do the bidding
Of a mad man behind the curtain
I will not fall or fear the way that I felt
That day, when the scar began to itch
And the burns began to tear my skin
I am cold, afraid that I will forgive to call my own
My own reflection is the fear of fear itself
Perceiving beyond is a fantasy

I want to laugh, I want to cry
Share the dreams inside
Reach for a dream, but you won't speak to me

You and I are dancing in circles on the wheel of life
Drowning at turns in the ocean of strife
You and I are dancing in circles on the wheel of life
Face it alone, I see no one in your eyes

Why would I have to pick up the pieces of what once was a melody
I will not fail
When the wounds began to bleed
And the burns began to scream
I am cold, afraid that I will forgive the sinner
Within the soul that I love to call my own
My own reflection is the fear of fear itself
Perceiving beyond is just a fantasy

The silence, unending silence
A sentence, a word
No answers, simply questions
