Back the fuck off!
What is thy name? My name is legion: for we are many!

Sightless eyes cannot see a thing do not believe in what you think that is real.
Accept this present or live on with this curse.
The choice is yours just remember there is no return.

Dull moments in life bring you to think this is wrong,
Denying all the work you have sacrificed yourself for.
Attend to deal with this fucked up nightmare,
You see yourself in forever.
