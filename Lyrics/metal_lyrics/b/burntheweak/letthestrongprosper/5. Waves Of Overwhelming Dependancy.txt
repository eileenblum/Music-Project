Living life as if it was a dream in insecurity of not playing a game.
Try as hard as you can to not let anything weaken you
If it was me, would you ever give it a chance?
This could be your goal, that you wanted to reach.
Do not pause and let your fantasies come true in your little never-never land.

Bring me back to life and I will leave everything behind.
In silence no one figures out what you are feeling even if you offer your heart to them.
The waves of overwhelming dependency make your heart grow fonder.
