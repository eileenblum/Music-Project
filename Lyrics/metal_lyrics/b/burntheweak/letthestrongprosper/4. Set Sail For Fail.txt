The only way of surviving this shame is burying everything you stood for.
To deny your family and your friends. 
And destroy all of your beloved memories taking all and erasing it out of your past.
Do not you know this is your destiny? No one will ever bring you of your path.
Set sail for fail, you snake this is your fault.
Set sail for fail, this wonât ever be assigned.

Do you really think anyone will forgive you 
After the shame you brought upon your surroundings?
You will be deleted out of the souls and hearts of the humans.
You are a waste of skin and bones, your life is meaningless without a purpose.
Never we will forget, never will be forgotten!
Set sail for fail, you snake this is your fault.

Donât stop this will be your last chance to bring it on, I will charge through your walls.
Donât stop this will be your last chance to bring it on, I will charge through your walls. 
Set sail for fail, you snake this is your fault.
Set sail for fail, this wonât ever be assigned.
