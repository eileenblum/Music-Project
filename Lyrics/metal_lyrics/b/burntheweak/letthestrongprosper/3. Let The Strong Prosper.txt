Honourable doings will be worth it.
You will have to bleed, for the things you did,
That went against your conscience plead for the aged and infirm.
You have never been befallen by this sickness.
No idea of how it is, to be one of the deceased.
Condemned to live your life, this is where the difficulties come through.
Beyond yourself stand up for you beyond yourself get this straight

This pride will overcome, your compunction of the actions you have done.
There will be no need to run you have no chance to be merciful.
Others will come to make you feel guilt and harm everything you love.
Be ferocious to your enemies and indulgent to your friends.
Think about it, someone else will claim your place his!
Beyond yourself stand up for you beyond yourself get this straight
Let the strong prosper and the weak perish.
