You saw the hate that I felt that, encouraged me to destroy this life.
Everything that fulfilled my life this lower creature has taken.
Praying for my saviour, this is the only thing that I will be able to do.
Praying for my saviour, this is the only thing that I will be able to do.

Trying to purge his disbelief erasing his abomination.
Unclenching my fist for my unending rage,
Praise the end of his ignorance.
Time to end this, once and for all.
Once and for all, once and for all.

Praying for my saviour, this is the only thing that I will be able to do.
Praying for my saviour, this is the only thing that I will be able to do.
Donât ever say you knew everything about my life
I just turned out the wrong way everybody thought of me
Donât ever say you knew everything about my life
I just turned out the wrong way everybody thought of me
