Wondering how much time is left until we get to our penalty.
That we have brought upon this earth through our pitiful sins. 
A sky is lit on fire.

Back off my priorities come first before everything else you say.
Nothing will change my mind for that you will be deceased. For that you will be
Sight set towards the end this will dis-burden you.
Release you from this shame a wish you have ever begged for.

A sky is lit on fire through your eyes you cannot see.
A sky is lit on fire do not start to hesitate.
A sky is lit on fire believe me this is real.
Believe me this is fucking real.
