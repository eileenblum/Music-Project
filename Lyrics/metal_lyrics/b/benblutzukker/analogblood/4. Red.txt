my diurnally death approaches
the sun will soon awake
the glamour of moonlight
will disappear

but even night
has lost its beauty
solitude freezes me to death
and enchains my mind

red - the colour of blood - a child of night is craving for
red - the colour of love - I'll covet thee forevermore
red - the colour of blood - it is running through my vein
but without love immortality turns to endless pain

my thirst for thy blood is sateless
just like anadipsia
my cut veins are opened for thee
come an lick my wounds

so I will stroll solitary
and watch over thy sleep
everlasting close to thee
but always unseen

because thy bliss
is more important than mine
and if I cannot belong to thee
I have to die alone

but anyway - I will love thee
