fire, fire burning bright
flitting shadows in the moonlight
the smell of sulphur will fill the air
and every hag will leave her lair

sisters, sisters
can't you hear the call
just follow your ambitions
come and praise the lord

sisters around the world convene you
dance around the fire, addicted to
the lord will give you might
he will give you flesh
'cause tonight is the night
Walpurgisnacht

sisters, sisters you all should know
our might is great an still will grow
they try to kill you at the pile
and just degraded us to be vile

witches, witches
get on your broomstick
come into the coven
and covet the lord

on the mount
in the woods
praise me!
the inquisition won't stop us!

sisters around the world convene you
dance around the fire, addicted to
I will give you might
and I will give you flesh
'cause tonight is the night
Walpurgisnacht
