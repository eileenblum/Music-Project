digital blood you live
digital blood I give
digital blood you seek
digital blood I bleed

out for the night
the intention is clear
you are on the hunt
an unseen hand
is controlling your path
now join my bloodbath

itâs your ambition
and my gift for you
let me be your donor
all your dreams come true

digital blood you live
digital blood I give
digital blood you seek
digital blood I bleed
digital blood you live the lust for more just day by day
digital blood I give to all of you the force of life
digital blood you seek the next transfusion I will seed
digital blood I bleed

tonight youâre free
reality is lost
no precepts at all
lights are flashing
feel exsanguination
now starts the sprinkler

itâs your addictive drug
and my gift for you
let me be your dealer
all your visions come true

itâs your estimation
and my gift for you
let me be your saviour
all your prayers come true

bleed!
