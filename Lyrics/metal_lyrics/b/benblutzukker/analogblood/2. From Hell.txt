I keep on hearing the police have caught me
but they wont fix me just yet.
I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track.
That joke about Leather Apron gave me real fits.

I am down on whores
and I shan't quit ripping them
till I do get buckled.

Grand work the last job was. I gave the lady no time to squeal.
How can they catch me now. I love my work and want to start again.
You will soon hear of me with my funny little games.
They say I'm a doctor now. Ha ha

From hell
I send you half the Kidney I took from one woman
and preserved it for you
the other piece I fried and ate it was very nice.
I may send you the bloody knife that took it out
if you only wait a while longer

Catch me when you can
Catch me when you can

I was not codding dear old Boss when I gave you the tip.
You'll hear about Saucy Jacky's work tomorrow.
Double event this time. Number one squealed a bit. Couldn't finish straight off.
Had not time to get ears for police. Thanks for keeping last letter back
till I got to work again.
