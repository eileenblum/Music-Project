Saved by His blood
Changed by His word!

You've been hurt
You've been broken
You've been sad
And the only time you feel good
Just won't last
Just when you think you've done everything

Holy Fire (in steps the King)
Holy Fire

You're not filled
You're empty
You've been drained
And the only time you feel good
You just complain
Just when you think you've done everything

Holy Fire (in steps the King)
Holy Fire
Holy Fire (in steps the King)
Holy Fire

Saved by His blood
Changed by His word!

Holy Fire (in steps the King)
Holy Fire
Holy Fire (in steps the King)
Holy Fire
