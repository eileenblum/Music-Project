Pleasures of the flesh seem sweet
Worldly thoughts rush in
We fight and fight for mind control
Our weakness turns to sin
Pride of man makes him fall
And lust is in his eyes
Such battle that we're in
Darkness feeds us lies, lies, lies

Evil forces of this world
Passions guide our way
Anger turns our hearts to stone
And robs the words we say
It's a Battle of the Flesh
With the rulers of the air
We have power in the Son
Power we can share

Battle of the Flesh, Battle of the Flesh
Battle of the Flesh, Battle of the Flesh

Pride of man makes him fall
And lust is in his eyes
Such a battle that we're in
Darkness feeds us lies

Pleasures of the flesh seem sweet
Worldly thoughts rush in
We fight and fight for mind control
Our weakness turns to sin
Pride of man makes him fall
And lust is in his eyes
Such battle that we're in
Darkness feeds us lies, lies
