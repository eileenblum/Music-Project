Feel the Heartbeat of the City
Hear it calling out to you
You've been robbed and you've been cheated, yeah
Be runnin' scared if you only knew

Too much time and too much money
Broken dreams and shattered hopes
Sell your soul, there's no tomorrow, no tomorrow
Your lips say, "Yes," but your heart says, "No!"

There's no way out
You're never gonna learn
You scream and shout!
Who ya gonna burn?
He's come for you
What are you gonna do?

You run, run, run but there's no escape
Your reckless love has made a trap
You made the choice but you knew better
Your faithless tears won't fill the gap

There's no way out
You're never gonna learn
You scream and shout!
Where ya gonna turn?
He's come for you
What are you gonna do?
(What you gonna do, huh?)

There's no way out
You scream and shout!
He's come for you
What are you gonna do?

Feel the Heartbeat of the City
Another time, another face
But you can't answer, you lie dyin'
Someone else will take your place
Someone else will take your place
Take your place
