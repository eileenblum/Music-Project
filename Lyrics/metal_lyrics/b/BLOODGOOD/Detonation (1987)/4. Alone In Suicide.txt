Who cares, who weeps? All is lost and the sickle reaps
Blank eyes look deep, love and hope crumble to the feet
I don't care if I've made my mark on this angry world
That's left me in the dark!
Just cut a message on my stone, "I want to be alone"
(I wanna die!)

Feel the knots twisting inside
As I look to the bullets to be my guide
In a razor's edge should I confide
To open my veins and bleed them dry
Oh, the endless pressure, how can I cope?
I try to release but the valves are broke
A psychotic grasp upon my throat
I wanna hang the rope!

Death you feel is your friend
As it calls from the black unknown
Voices hounding at your mind echo to the bone...
Alone in Suicide

I used to honor my day of birth
Cherish life and place it first
But now I view it as a curse
Dig my grave and rent the hearse!
Yes, every morning I take a walk
That leads me trapped in an empty box
A liar's face and the voice that mocks
I want to stop the clock!

Death you feel is your friend
As it calls from the black unknown
Voices hounding at your mind echo to the bone
Alone in suicide

Salvation calls (to the lonely)
On the abused (redemption falls)
God gave his all (that you might know him)
Tear down the walls! What have you got to lose?

Salvation calls to all of the lonely people
Tear down the walls, you've been abused
God gave his all to all of the lonely people
He stretched out his arms and died for you!
