A Vagrant People you shake your fist
The blade that cuts you turn and kiss
Your master hates you and he'll have your head
But I've opened graves and raised the dead

Look to the past from which you come
Gaze in the fire eternal son

A precious treasure you save on earth
But when it burns you'll see its worth
Your plans will fail you, who'll break your fall?
You might not have a chance to call

Look to the past from which you come
Gaze in the fire eternal son
Repulse the dark and evil one

I look in your heart and see a grave of rot and decay
I advise you look and see today is fading away

A precious treasure you save on earth
But when it burns you'll see its worth
Your plans will fail you, who'll break your fall?
You might not have a chance to call

Look to the past from which you come
Gaze in the fire eternal son
Repulse the dark and evil one
Pick up your swords and fight 'til dawn

Fight, stand and fight! Fight, the good fight!
Fight, stand and fight! Fight, the good fight!
