Blackmail and robbery from the liar
He sits and stokes the coals while you're asleep
He wants to burn your souls with his fire
Never letting up or giving you relief

Broken bodies wrapped in bloody blankets
But the victory was paid for at a price
Words of peace are met with screaming bullets
Now you're looking through a soldier's eyes

A greater life abounding in the Prince of Peace
He sits in intercession for your prayers
He wants to see your souls in prosperity
He's the only one who ever really cares

Battle-worn His flesh is torn and bleeding
Eternal life comes through the souls God's feeding
Words of peace are met with screaming bullets
Now you're looking through a soldier's eyes

Mighty words He spoke to us in Spirit
For He's come to give us life

Share the Bread and Living Water
Eat the Flesh, drink the blood of Christ

Battle-worn His flesh is torn and bleeding
Eternal life comes through the souls God's feeding
Words of peace are met with screaming bullets
Now you're looking through a soldier's eyes

Mighty words He spoke to us in Spirit
For He's come to give us life

Share the Bread and Living Water
Eat the Flesh, drink the blood of Christ
