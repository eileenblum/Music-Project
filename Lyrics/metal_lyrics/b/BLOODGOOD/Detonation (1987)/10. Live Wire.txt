With a shield and a sword
He crushes evil in the name of the Lord
In the fields of war
His victory is the nails he bore
With his head held high
He speaks the truth and he hates the lie
He'll scream, he'll die
But God will raise him back to life!

He's a Live Wire
He's a Live Wire
He's on fire!

With the bend of the knee
He can move a mountain or part a sea
He's hot to the touch
Like a burning flame that availeth much
His life's a flash
He'll crack the darkness like a razor's slash
But he loves and he cares
He'll pick you up when you're in despair

He's a live wire
He's a live wire
He's on fire

His arms are huge
By the weight he carries of verbal abuse
His back is torn
With the agony of an open sore
His face is marred
The dried blood of an open scar
The gates of hell shall not prevail
'Cause he's torn the veil

He's a live wire
He's a live wire
He's on fire
