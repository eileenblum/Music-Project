Pathway to heaven or highway to hell
Which one you're on is easy to tell
Live for yourself, no time for the Son
Don't blame God for your own Self-Destruction!

When it's all over, your life is done
No more chances and no place to run
You judge yourself if you turn away
Let him in, do it, do it today

The life you're leading's gonna cause you grief
You run from love, choke in disbelief
You say, "God is dead!", see what you've done
Don't blame God for your own Self-Destruction!

When it's all over, your life is done
No more chances and no place to run
You judge yourself if you turn away
Let him in!
Destruction! Destruction!

You think life is cheap, well I got some news
Jesus Christ paid a high price for you, yeah
Died a sinner's death, see what he's done
Don't blame God for your own Self-Destruction!

When it's all over, your life is done
No more chances and no place to run
You judge yourself if you turn away
Let him in, do it today!

Destruction! Destruction!
Destruction! Destruction!...
