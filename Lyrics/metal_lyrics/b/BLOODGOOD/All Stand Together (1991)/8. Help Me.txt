They said it would last forever
We'd taken our vows
We started our lives together
But look at us now

When did we stop trying
Now I feel like dying

Scars that will never heal
The damage is done
Arguments gone forever
But nobody's won

I thought love would make it alright
But all we could say was goodbye

Help me get through the night
Give me the strength
'Cause I feel I'm falling

Help me see through the night
I've got to believe
That a new day's coming soon

We started our lives together
We'd taken our vows
They said it would last forever
But look at us now

Help me get through the night
Give me the strength
âCause I feel iâm falling
Help me see through the night
Iâve got to believe
That a new dayâs coming soon

I thought love would make it alright
But all you could say was goodbye

Help me get through the night
Give me the strength
'Cause I feel I'm falling

Help me see through the night
I've got to believe
That a new day's coming soon

Help me get through the night
I can't close my eyes
Cause I feel tears falling

Please, please help me to see

Iâve got to believe
That a new dayâs coming from you
Help me, help me
Coming from you
Help me
A new day's coming
Help me, get through the night
Help me, help me
There's a new day coming
Help me, please help me to see
Help me, help me
There's a new day coming

[This song is dedicated to all those going through the pains of divorce. Let them get you through the night]
