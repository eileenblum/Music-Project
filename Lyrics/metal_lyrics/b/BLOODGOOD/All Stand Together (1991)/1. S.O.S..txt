Fire, spirit lit the flame
A blinding light that shows us the way
Higher, He's going to make us soar
And fly us up to heaven's gate

Yearning, mercy bring us home
We look upon our final day
Burnin', see the morning star
Trumpet blast will take us away

Glory to the King of kings
Power to the Lord we sing
Forever and ever

Callin' out S.O.S.
Save our souls
You are the only one
S.O.S. save our souls
Our life has just begun
Callin' out S.O.S.

Cyclone, the tempest comes at last
Man is finally put to his shame
White throne, fury of the King
Judgement comes because of His name

Stars are fallin' from the sky
Wrath of God, the Son's burning eyes
Blazing like fire

Callin' out S.O.S.
S.O.S. save our souls
You are the only one
S.O.S. save our souls
Our life has just begun
S.O.S. every knee gonna bow
And every tongue confess

S.O.S. save our souls
You are the only one
S.O.S. take away our fears
And all the bitterness
S.O.S. hear me cryin' out
This is my heart's distress
Callin' out S.O.S.
