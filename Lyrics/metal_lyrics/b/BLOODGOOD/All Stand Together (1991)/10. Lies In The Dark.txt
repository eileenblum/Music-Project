Babe, you whisper in my ear
Things I shouldn't hear
Oh girl, this time you've gone too far
It's like a falling star
You're givin' yourself away
Too much of a price to pay

Girl, temptation's all around
Our love has fallen down
Oh, baby, the passions of design
Our love is on the line
Affections have been misplaced
The scars we cannot erase

Lies in the dark
Words of love but they're tearin' us apart
Lies in the dark
Baby, it's true

Babe, you whisper in my ear
Things I shouldn't hear
Oh girl, this time you've gone too far
It's like a falling star
You're givin' yourself away
Too much of a price to pay

Lies in the dark
Words of love but they're tearin' us apart
Lies in the dark
Sounds like love but it's breakin' my heart
Lies in the dark
Words of love but they're tearin' us apart
Lies in the dark
What can we do

Lies in the dark
Words of love but they're tearin' us apart
Lies in the dark
Sounds like love but it's breakin' my heart
Lies in the dark
Words of love but they're tearin' us apart
Lies in the dark

Sounds like love but it's breakin' my heart, yeah
Lies in the dark
Words of love but there tearin' us apart
Lies in the dark
Sounds like love but it's breakin' my heart, yeah
