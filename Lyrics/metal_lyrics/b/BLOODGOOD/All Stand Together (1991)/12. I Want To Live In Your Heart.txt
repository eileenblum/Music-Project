I felt my heart was leading
I set my course on you
In your eyes I'm reading
Tell me what you want to do

I want to live in your heart
I want to be in your thoughts
Where you go, walk with me
And when you talk, talk about me

The whole world sits and wonders
How a man loves his woman
When passion's filled with thunder
From the trance they're under

When you're alone in the middle of the night
Let my love be your light
When you awake from your sleep
Know in your heart my love's deep
My love's deep
