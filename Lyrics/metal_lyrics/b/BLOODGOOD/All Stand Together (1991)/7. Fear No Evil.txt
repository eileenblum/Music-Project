Wasn't it just yesterday
The wall came down
Everyone was sayin'
Peace is all around

But now the tanks are rollin'
The missiles take aim
The enemy's approachin'
Tell me who's to blame

Fear no evil (even when it's at your door)
Fear no evil (ah, ah)
Fear no evil (tell me who you're fightin' for)
Even though the end is comin'
I have learned to fear no evil

When you hear preachers sayin'
Everything's O.K.
It's time that you were leavin'
Time to run away

Keep your eyes and ears on the Lord
Author of our faith
The prophecies unfolding
He'll take us all away
