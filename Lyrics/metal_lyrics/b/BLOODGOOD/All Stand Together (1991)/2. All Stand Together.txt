Nations will stand
Nations will fall
God will require
Accounts from them all

Arabian Oil
Mid-Eastern soil
Blood in the sand
A madman demands

But we'll all stand
We'll all stand together
If we all stand
We'll all stand together
Yes we'll all stand
We'll all stand together
As our hands reach towards the sky

People unite
With one common cause
As evil delights
In breaking God's laws

Dividing the thoughts
And hearts of all men
Wicked, relentless
When will it end?

But we all stand,
We'll all stand together
If we all stand
We'll all stand together
Yes we'll all stand
We'll all stand together
As our hands reach towards the sky

Side by side
Hand in hand
All you people
Take command

And raise your voices
To claim the land
That God has given you

We'll all stand, we'll all stand together
If we all stand, we'll all stand together
Yes we'll all stand, we'll all stand together
As our hands reach towards the sky
