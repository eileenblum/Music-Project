Homeless, Delinquent, Defenses
Surrounding his real feelings and personality
Not shaven, not clean, a sideline player
You know what I mean
Sonata, no lyric to his music

It's a crime, it's a down right shame
It's a dirty deal in a crooked game
It's a lie and he's not to blame
He's a victim and he's just been framed

He's a brilliant boy looking for an answer
But no one will employ a streetlight dancer

It's a shock, it's a jolt that kills
It'll open your eyes when blood is spilled
It'll tear and rip at your heart
When a young boy dies before he can start

Such a brilliant boy looking for an answer
But no one will employ a streetlight dancer

He'd be complete but he's missing a beat
The story is sad but true
By missing the mark he's lost in the dark
Not knowing what more to do

He's a brilliant boy looking for an answer
Evil could destroy this streetlight dancer

Homeless, Delinquent
Streetlight Dancer
Lifeless yet living
Streetlight Dancer
His spirit is weak
His flesh is so willing
Streetlight Dancer
