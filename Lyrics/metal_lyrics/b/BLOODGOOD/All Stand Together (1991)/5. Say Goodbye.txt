I want to kiss you one last time
I want to press your lips to mine
The hands I used to hold
The arms that stopped the cold
Where's the face I used to touch
The breath that whispered love

I never thought I'd say goodbye
I want to hold you one last time
We always said, "I love you."
Can't stop thinking of you

I thought I heard you at the door
I long to hear your voice once more
The laughter in your eyes
You made me realize
Love is not some fantasy
But now it's just a memory

I never thought I'd say goodbye
I want to hold you one last time
I always said, "I love you."
I never thought I'd say goodbye

The memories keep playing
Over and over
Turn my thoughts towards heaven
Now that it's over

I never thought I'd say goodbye (goodbye my love)
I want to hold you one last time
I always said, "I love you."
Can't stop thinking of you
I never thought I'd say goodbye (goodbye my love)
I want to hold you one last time
I always said, "I love you."
Can't stop thinking of you
I never thought I'd say goodbye
Goodbye
