You've been beaten up badly
Your life is a mess
Got no money in your pockets
Can't seem to get no rest

Got your eyes on the other's profits
And you'll steal to get your own
Got no food in your belly
Got no place that you call home

I believe in love
Love believes in me
From an act of mercy
The Word has set me free

Your hands are tied behind you
Even though there is no rope
Your friends they all despise you
But there's one who gives you hope

He's the one who stands before you
Even though you're in the dark
With His light He will explore you
And He'll cleanse your blackened heart

I believe in love
Love believes in me
From an act of mercy
The Word has set me free

Escape from the fire
No need to burn out young
Escape from the fire
And believe in the only one
Escape from the fire
On your way to the Father and the Son
Escape from the fire
I believe in love
Love believes in me
From an act of mercy
The Word has set me free

Escape from the fire
No need to burn out young
Escape from the fire
And believe in the only one
Escape from the fire
On your way to the Father and the Son
Escape from the fire
And believe in the only one
Escape from the fire
Escape from the fire
Escape from the fire
Escape from the fire
Escape from the fire
