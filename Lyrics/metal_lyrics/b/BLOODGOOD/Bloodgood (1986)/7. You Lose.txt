I feel like runnin' yes it's time to leave
My eyes see it but I don't believe 

Your life is like a white-washed tomb
You speak of love but your words are doom!
You speak of life but your words are dead!
The blood of Christ rests upon your head!
You lose! 

You think you're alright by the things you do
But then you disregard the Lord's own Truth! 

Your life is like a white-washed tomb
You speak of love but your words are doom!
You speak of life but your words are dead!
The blood of Christ rests upon your head!

You lie, you die, but you can't go on
You compromise it's the same old song
You play the part like you wrote the play
But the ending just won't go your way
You need Jesus....you need Jesus! 

Your life is like a white-washed tomb
You speak of love but your words are doom!
You speak of life but your words are dead!
The blood of Christ rests upon your head, on your head!
You lose, you lose, you lose, you lose, you lose!
