I've been a soldier of fortune
Took whatever I saw
I came for death and destruction
I came to break the law
I was a soldier of fire
Burned whatever I could
Then the Lamb overtook me, yah
Now I battle for good 

Soldier of Peace
Soldier of Light
Look out Satan
'Cause I'm coming to fight! 
I was a soldier of darkness
I overshadowed the land
Well I had no time for mercy
I ruled with an iron hand
I was a soldier of passion
Took whatever I could
Then the Lamb overtook me, yah
Now I battle for good 

Soldier of Peace
Soldier of Light
Look out Satan
'Cause I'm coming to fight! 
Then I heard the sounds of heaven
Crashing seas...seemed like thunder! 
I turned my back on the devil
'Cause Jesus broke my chains
Now I live for His glory
Shout whenever I can, yah! 

Soldier of Peace
Soldier of Light
Look out Satan
'Cause I'm coming to fight! 
I'm coming to fight!
Look out!
Coming to fight!
