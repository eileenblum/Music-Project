There's evil in the air, there're voices everywhere
And yet you lie asleep you fools, awake!
My time is drawing short, your faith will soon abort
And yet your eyes are closed you fools, awake!
They're coming can't you hear them?
A kiss will seal my fate
And still you lie in disbelief
Awake, my God, awake! 

My final hour is here, my death is drawing near
And now your hearts are filled with grief, awake!
My soul is torn in two, there's nothing you can do
Pray that you'll not fall my friends, awake!
I sweated drops of blood for you
And all the human race
And still you lie in disbelief
Awake, my God, awake! 

When darkness reigns (Where will you be hiding?)
When darkness reigns (It's me you will deny!)
When darkness reigns (Take your swords and fly!) 
My Father, hallowed be Thy name
My Lord, this is what I pray
Not my will but Yours be done
You're my Father, I'm your Son 

When darkness reigns (Where will you be hiding?)
When darkness reigns (It's me you will deny!)
When darkness reigns (Take your swords and fly!)
(Where will you be hiding?)
When darkness reigns (It's me you will deny!)
When darkness reigns (Take your swords and fly!)
