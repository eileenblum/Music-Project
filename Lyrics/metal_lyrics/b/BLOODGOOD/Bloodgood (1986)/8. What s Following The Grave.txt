Are you lost this evening
Can't you trust anyone at all?
There's a heart that's beating
While the hands are writing on the wall
You're afraid of bleeding
That's the life that's flowing through your veins
But your soul is needing
You're not sure what's following the grave 

What's following the grave
What's following the grave
What's following the grave
What's following the grave

Don't you try to break away
From the One who's standing at your door
All He wants is to save you
After all...you were bought and paid for! 

What's following the grave
What's following the grave
What's following the grave
What's following the grave

If you know Him there'll be life!
If you don't there'll be separation! 
If you know Him there'll be life!
If you don't there'll be separation from my God!
Oh Lord they're gonna die without the blood
Without the blood of Jesus Christ! 
What's following the grave
What's following the grave
What's following the grave
What's following the grave
