Does a child cry?
Does the world turn around?
Does a fire burn?
Is the earth also ground?
This we've learned
But what have found?
Does a snowflake fall?
And in fall does a tree drop its leaves?
Does water freeze? 

Does a change take place
In a young man's face?
Does he seem to learn
Through truth and grace?

Now he won't get burned
If he seeks the Lord
Oh if you ask for Him
You won't be ignored, no
Stand in the Light
Stand in the Light
Stand in the Light of the Lord (of the Lord!)
Stand in the Light
Stand in the Light
Stand in the Light of the Lord (of the Lord!)

You can stand in the Light
And break the chains of the night
He's got the world in His hands
And He loves who understands
And follows Him 

Stand in the Light
Stand in the Light
Stand in the Light of the Lord (of the Lord!)
Stand on the Blood
Stand on the Blood
Stand on the Blood of the Lord (of the Lord!)
