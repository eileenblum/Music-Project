Accept the Lamb of the Living God
Accept the Lamb of the Living God
Accept I AM He's the Living God
Accept I AM He's the Living God
Run in the night, can you feel your body's growing weaker
On the fright, expecting anytime a roaming creature
All of your days, are measured by the way you serve your master
Lives in a maze, loving all the time your own disaster
Falling asleep, empty
Screams from the street, "Not me!" 
Pulling away, from the bloody hands that try to hold you
Calls from the grave, you try to yell out but you're too afraid
Barely escaped, ensnared
Still he waits, no one cares! 
Except the Lamb of the Living God
Accept the Lamb of the Living God
Accept I AM He's the Living God
Accept I AM He's the Living God
Wasting away, as your dirty hand clinches the gutter
Lying in pain, as your needy words fall out in whispers
Always afraid, never letting up let no one enter
Never to say, "I've weaved this we, I'm lost forever!"
Falling asleep, empty
Screams from the street, "Not me!" 
Accept the Lamb of the Living God
Accept the Lamb of the Living God
Accept I AM He's the Living God
Accept I AM He's the Living God
Against the wall, as the hands of light reach out to hold you
Heed the call, on bended knees resist the fall
Falling asleep, in His arms
Screams from the street...all are gone 
Accept the Lamb of the Living God
Accept the Lamb of the Living God
Accept I AM He's the Living God
Accept I AM He's the Living God
