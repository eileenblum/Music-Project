Down, down, down below the grave
Heaven has turned away
Dust, dust, dust will be his feed
A lethal blow to end his days 
Lies, lies, lies are all he speaks
Contamination of your mind
Dark, dark, darkness fills your eyes
Delusion tries to make you blind

He's like a beast who lies in hiding
A mercenary of deceit
I hear the tolling of the death bell
I see his ultimate defeat 
He is the Black Snake of rebellion
He is the slayer of the young
He is the hell-born of the angels
His destiny will be the flames 
Death, death, death is all around
But you can surely break away
Blood, blood, blood has paid the price
The Prince of Peace will show the way 

He's like a beast who lies in hiding
A mercenary of deceit
I hear the tolling of the death bell
I see his ultimate defeat
He is the Black Snake of rebellion
He is the slayer of the young
He is the hell born of the angels
His destiny will be the flames

He who is in me is greater
Than he who is in the world
He who is in me is greater
Than he who is in the world 

He's like a beast who lies in hiding
A mercenary of deceit
I hear the tolling of the death bell
I see his ultimate defeat
He is the Black Snake of rebellion
He is the slayer of the young
He is the hell born of the angels
His destiny will be the flames
