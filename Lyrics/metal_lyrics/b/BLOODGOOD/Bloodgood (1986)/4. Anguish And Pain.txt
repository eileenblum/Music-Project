With a crashing of thunder and flashing of light
He comes like a warrior, a thief in the night
A double-edged sword coming out of His mouth
His words cut like razors, His whisper's a shout! 
His gleaming white hair streaking the sky
A banner of victory across His thigh
His eyes all ablaze they sear through the earth
He's heir to the Father by His virgin birth 

The Day of Judgement is at hand
Terror will reign across the land
The Day of Judgement is at hand
Terror will reign across the land

There'll be anguish and pain
For all that remains 

With a crashing of thunder and a flashing of light
He comes like a warrior, a thief in the night
With crowns on His head, He's seeking His throne
The title of Lord Sovereign King is His alone 

The Day of Judgement is at hand
Terror will reign across the land
The Day of Judgement is at hand
Terror will reign across the land

There'll be anguish and pain
For all that remains
Anguish and pain 
There'll be anguish and pain
For all that remains 

[Music &amp; Lyrics: Les Carlsen, Joyce Carlsen and David Zaffiro]
