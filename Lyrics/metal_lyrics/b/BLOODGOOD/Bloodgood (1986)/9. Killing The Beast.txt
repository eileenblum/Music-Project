Look at all the damage that he's brought upon the earth
His angry body coils in the sand
Stinging poison he spits on the hopeless ones in chains
The blood of all the dead are on his hands
Yes I remember clearly when he had me in his grip
The promises that blossomed into lies
Many still afflicted by the torment of his whip
Not knowing that he'd be there till they die 

He said, "I'll exalt myself above the stars of God,
And I will be just like the Most High"
Swollen in rebellion he awoke the wrath of God
And tumbled down like lightning from the sky
A fool in all his glory to think he'd overtake
The One who made the heavens in a day
Spewing accusations out with his tongue of hate
Against the children of the promised way 

Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, crushing his head!

One day the King of Kings will put him in an endless pit
And lock it up tight for a thousand years
The Alpha and Omega will begin His reign on earth
And crushing into pieces ancient fears
He'll receive all glory high upon His mighty throne
All nations bowing down in reverent praise
tears of joy and laughter will be our new place and home
Our enemy is doomed in a fiery blaze! 

Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast
Killing the Beast, Killing the Beast, crushing his head!
