Digging in the ground, load another round, fix your bayonet
Devil wants your turf, gotta know your worth, destiny is set
How ya gonna stand, how ya gonna hold, how ya gonna win the fight?
Put aside the hate, put aside the bad, gotta do what you know is right

In the trenches! In the trenches!

How you gonna grow, how you gonna learn, don't you know the trials are near?
Fall down on your knees, wisdom is the key to take away your fear

In the trenches! In the trenches!

If you believeâ¦don't be afraid
If you believeâ¦fall on your knees
If you believeâ¦then you'll be saved
Just believe

Lust turns into sin, sin turns into death, wants to pull you underneath
Nowhere else to turn, man you gotta learn there's only tears and gnashing teeth!

In the trenches! In the trenches!

If you believeâ¦don't be afraid
If you believeâ¦fall on your knees
If you believeâ¦then you'll be saved
Just believe

Don't be a dead man walking
Faith untestedâ¦is no faith at all
Nothing grows in the mountain tops, but in the trenches!

If you believeâ¦don't be afraid
If you believeâ¦fall on your knees
If you believeâ¦then you'll be saved
If you believe!

Sittin' in the dirt, fear and sweat
Thinkin' 'bout the things that we haven't done yet
Too young to die, too late to regret
We wanna live, but we're not outta of here yet!
