Via De La Rosa the road to the cross
The Lamb of God redeeming the lost
Carry the load and the disgrace
Willing to be there in my place

What about the Man, yeah the Man in the middle?
What about the Man, what about the Man?

What about the Man, yeah the Man in the middle?
What about the Man, what about the Manâ¦Man?

Torn in the flesh
Ripped open skin
Never cried out
Never gave in

Determined to die and go to the grave
This act of love, so all might be saved

What about the Man, yeah the Man in the middle?
What about the Man, what about the Man?

The Man in the middle is the flesh of God
The Man in the middle is a lightning rod
The Man in the middle is the bread of life
The Man in the middle cuts like a knife
The Man in the middle created all things
The Man in the middle is the King of all kings

Ah!

Son of Man
Son of Man
Son of Man
Son of Man

The Man in the middle is the flesh of God
The Man in the middle is a lightning rod
The Man in the middle is the bread of life
The Man in the middle cuts like a knife
The Man in the middle created all things
The Man in the middle is the King of all kings

What about the Man?
What about the Man?
What about the Man?
Man, Man, Man, Man
What about the Man in the middle?
