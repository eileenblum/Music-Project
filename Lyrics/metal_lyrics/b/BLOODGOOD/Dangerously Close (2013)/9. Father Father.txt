I'm hanging on a tree, 'cause I love You
Walking on the sea, 'cause I can
I'm comin' to visit, I'm not going to stay
I'll be out of here, in just a few days

Now my arms are wide open to embrace
The pain that I have is raw and real
But the joy! Outweighs the disgrace
Father, Father you know how I feel

If you hear what is right, then you refuse
I'd rather follow in His sandals, then to be in your shoes

Father, Father
Where are you now?
Seated on the throne at home.
Welcome, Welcome
All the saints in love
Join us now up above

If you hear what is right, then you refuse
I'd rather follow in His sandals, than to be in your shoes

Father, Father
Where are you now?
Seated on the throne at home.
Welcome, welcome
All the saints in love
Join us now up above
Do it, do it
Do what You said
After three days, raised from the dead

Do it, do it
Do what You said
After three days, raised from the dead

Do it, do it
Do what You said
After three days, raised from the dead

After three days, raised from the dead
After three days, raised from the dead
