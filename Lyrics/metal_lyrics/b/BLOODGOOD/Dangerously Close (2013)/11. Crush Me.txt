Waiting for Your genius
From Heaven where it flows
Like a seed within me
Itâs painful as it grows
See me struggle
Let me go on for a while
My lips say I adore You
But my heart is so wild

Love me
Find me
Break me
Crush me
Fix me
And give me life again

Love me
Find me
Break me
Crush me
Fix me
And give me life again

Like another piece of music
Hand written on a score
The symphony of wisdom
Swept from Heavenâs floor
And thereâs Glory all around You
As I struggle for my place
On my knees Iâm glad I found You
How I long to see Your face

Love me
Find me
Break me
Crush me
Fix me
And give me life again

Love me
Find me
Break me
Crush me
Fix me
And give me life again
