I can hold on, stay the road You put me on
My life, Your love, this is right where I belong

Itâs time for me to lay it on the line
Itâs only through Your light that I can see
Cause Iâve been living in a shadow
Of who I was not who Iâm gonna be

I can hold on, stay the road You put me on
My life, Your love, this is right where I belong

And I surrender the guilty memories
It doesnât matter what Iâve done before
From the moment I saw Your face
My wasted past is not welcome anymore

Iâll never stop fightinâ
Never stop trying, never denyinâ
Iâll never stop fightinâ
Never stop trying, never denyinâ
âTil the day I die

I can hold on, stay the road You put me on
My life, Your love, this is right where I belong

And when I stumble and if I start to fall
Or Iâm on my knees and donât know what to pray
Then I remember that this is not my home, no
And then I hear Your voice, the world fades away

Iâll never stop fightinâ
Never stop trying, never denying
Iâll never stop fighting
Never stop trying, never denying
âTil the day I die, âtil the day I die
I can hold on, âtil the day I die
Hold on âtil the day I die!

I can hold onâ¦
Yes, I can hold on
I can hold on
