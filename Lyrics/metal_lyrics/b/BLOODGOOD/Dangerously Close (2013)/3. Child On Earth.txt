Lord, oh Lord
Righteous One
Beginning and the end

The fall of man
You'll over come
To earth your Son you'll send

And He will be
The Lamb of God
And wash away our sins

Virgin birth, Child on earthâ¦.Amen
Crucify, pierced His sideâ¦Amen

Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye Baby
Heaven to earthâ¦ humâ¦ just to save me
My sin, my sin
Has gone away
The Lord has set me free

My friend, my friend
Beginning and end
The Lord has died for me

Virgin birth, Child on earthâ¦.Amen
Crucify, pierced His sideâ¦Amen

Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye baby
Heaven and earth, to the graveâ¦ just to save me
The Child grew and the cradle fell
Crushing the head of the snake from hell

Hearing the voices of the angels sing
I believe in Heavenly things
Glory, glory, glory to the kingâ¦ amen

Unto us a Child is given
Conquered death, He has risen
Bring us back to before the fall
Perfect us, after all

Unto us a Child is given
Conquered death, He has risen
To bring us back to before the fall
Perfect us, after all

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
