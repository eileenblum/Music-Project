When you awake your day begins
Speak to God, confess your sins
Call to mind the ones you love
Lift your enemies up above

Bring to Him the world today and pray
Pray, Pray, Pray!

Call for those who need some peace
They hurt so bad and seek release
And so you bow and make request
For those so tired in need of rest

Bring to Him, Heâll make a way
Just pray!
Pray, Pray, Pray!

And when you pray go in your room
And sing to Him a humble tune
He knows your needs before you speak
JUST PRAY!

And when you go to bed at night
Sleep until the morning light
If you should die before you wake
Pray to God your soul Heâll take

Bring to Him the world tonight and pray!
Pray, Pray, Pray!
