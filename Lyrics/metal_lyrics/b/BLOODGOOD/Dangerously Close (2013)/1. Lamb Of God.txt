Like tongues of fire lick up straw
The doomed go down into the dark
The last remark on dying lips
Breakaway from the fingertips 
He stretched out His arms to hold you
Gave up His life to know you

Lamb of God
Christ the Lord
Lamb of God

On His knees He washed our feet 
Poured His blood on the mercy seat
Told us to love one another 
Lay down your life for your brother

Born of a virgin
Water to wine
Taught in the temple 
Healed the blind
Holy Spirit
Fruit of the vine
I am yours
You are mine

Lamb of God 
Christ the Lord
Lamb of God
