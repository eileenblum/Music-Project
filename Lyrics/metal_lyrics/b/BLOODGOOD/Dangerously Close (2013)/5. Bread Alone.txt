We donât live by bread alone
But, by every word You say
Lost and found
That lovely sound
Is showing us the way

You know the world will tell you, âSatisfy yourselfâ
The most important thing, is you and no one else
And everything you own and all that you consume
Will not be able to keep you from the tomb

I want to testify and need to tell the truth
And as the years go by Iâm further from my youth
And thatâs just fine with me
These lines are living proof

We donât live by bread alone!

We donât live by bread alone
But by every word You say
Lost and found
That lovely sound
Itâs showing us the way

We donât live by bread alone
But by every word You say
Lost and found
That lovely sound
Itâs showing us the way

Fill me up with every thought of You
So we can reach the world
Andâ¦TESTIFY tell the TRUTH
As years go by from my youth
Fine with me, living proof, living proof

Every word from the mouth of God
Lord I know You are alive in me
And Iâm alive in You

We donât live by bread alone
But by every word You say
Lost and found
That lovely sound
Itâs showing us the way

We donât live by bread alone
But by every word You say
Lost and found
That lovely sound
Itâs showing us the way

We donât live by bread alone
But by every word You say
Lost and found
That lovely sound
Itâs showing us the way
