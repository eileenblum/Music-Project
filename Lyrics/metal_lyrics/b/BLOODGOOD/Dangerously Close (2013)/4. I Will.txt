I will sing Your praise
Through the darkest days
Crying out to You
Into the night
I will walk with You
Till my days are through
And Iâm standing there right by Your side
I will I will I will

Sing for your Glory and I wanna fly
On the wings of Your love
And Iâm gonna fly on the wings of Your love

Oh Youâve rescued me
Gave me eyes to see
Oh Your love for me is guiding my life
Oh You shower me with pure ecstasy
All the plans for me are shining so bright

I will, I will, I will

Sing for your Glory and I wanna fly
On the wings of Your love
And Iâm gonna fly on the wings of Your love
