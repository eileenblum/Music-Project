Outstretched hands, I see them as I crawl
On my knees and hands, yeah
Heart of strength love me after all
All I need is you my Lord

How I love the way it feels when You are leading me
Through the valley of love
I am Yours Iâm not my own
Breaking down this heart of stone
On my knees before Your throne

LOSE!...your life
FIND!....your self
STAY!...the course
Run the race that He has given you
GO!

To the Word of God where you find the source
Itâs His written voice, yeah

In the quiet place
A still small voice
Just you and God, yeah

How I love the way it feels when You are leading me
Through the valley of love
I am Yours Iâm not my own
Breaking down this heart of stone
On my knees before your throne

LOSE!...your life
FIND!....your self
STAY!...the course
Run the race that He has given you
GO!

How I love the way it feels when You are leading me
Through the valley of love
I am Yours Iâm not my own
Breaking down this heart of stone
On my knees before Your throne

LOSE!...your life
FIND!....your self
STAY!...the course
Run the race that He has given you

LOSE!...your life
FIND!....your self
STAY!...the course
Run the race that He has given you

GO, yeah go, RUN
