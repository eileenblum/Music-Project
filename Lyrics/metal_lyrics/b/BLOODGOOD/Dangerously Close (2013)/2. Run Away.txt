Hear her calling, voice so soothing,
Bed of linen, silk and lace

Her door's open, speaking louder,
Hear her crying, drink deep of love

Run Away (from the spider's web)
Run Away (you soon will be dead)
Run Away (the wise men said)
Run away and hide

Run Away (from where she lays)
Run Away (she's an open grave)
Run Away (the wise men say)
Run away and hide

Hear her calling (haughty eyes)
Voice so soothing (lying tongue)
Bed of linen, silk and lace

Her door's open (brazen face)
Speaking louder (pierce your soul)
Hear her crying, drink deep of love

I shouldn't be here... Oh God, help me
Give me strength to leave this place
What was I thinking?... I know this is wrong

Run Away (from the spider's web)
Run Away (you soon will be dead)
Run Away (the wise men said)
Run away and hide

Run Away (from where she lays)
Run Away (she's an open grave)
Run Away (the wise men said)
Run away, run away and hide
Run away!
