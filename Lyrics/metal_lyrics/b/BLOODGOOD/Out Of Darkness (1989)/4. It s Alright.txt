Now the day has gone away
You're sitting in the dark
When you say you are that way
You are because you are
With the tongue your mind can speak
Your will is strong when it should be weak
From your heart you overflow
How you feel is what you show

Oh it's alright, yeah it's alright
Oh it's alright by me
Oh it's alright, yeah it's alright
Oh it's alright by me

Soon you'll say you have to pray
'Cause praying is a start
Good for you 'cause I have to pray, too
I feel it in my heart
When you ask for your desires
He wants to please your soul
But when you stand inside the fire
He wants to make you pure as gold

Oh it's alright, yeah it's alright
Oh it's alright by me
Oh it's alright, yeah it's alright
Oh it's alright by me

Kindly souls they find a home
And very rarely lose
Life is light when switched on right
Your nature you must choose
When you seek a life worth living
You will find it in time
Don't refuse the gift he's giving
Death's a bitter wine
