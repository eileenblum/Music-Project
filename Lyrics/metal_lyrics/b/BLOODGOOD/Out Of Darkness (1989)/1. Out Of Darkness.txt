I am the witness of disaster
It seemed the only way was down
I saw the wicked in his scheming
I heard his victims crying out
Why do the evil prosper, his victims crushed
I see the shadows growing, I've had enough

Out of the darkness into the light
I heard ten thousand cry
Out of the darkness into the light
Turn or you will die

My God how long will you forget me
O Lord I need to see your face
The enemy has come against me
He laughs at me, prepared to slay
Yet I will trust in You, Lord, my heart will sing
I'll wait to hear your voice God, you'll hear me scream

Out of the darkness into the light
See the demons flee
Out of the darkness into the light
Jesus, set me free

You are the helper of the helpless
The adversary has no might
I hear your voice of thunder, the lightning strikes
The night will flee before you, you'll win the fight

Out of the darkness into the light
See the demons flee
Out of the darkness into the light
Jesus set me free
