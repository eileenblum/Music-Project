If you bark and bare your teeth
If you foam at the mouth you got company
The race is on to rule the streets
'Cause it's a mad dog world

We're all unleashed tooth and nail
Fightin' over a bone only to find the marrow's stale
You gotta survive or they'll eat you alive
'Cause it's a mad dog world

Where can you run to away from this place
Into the arms of goodness and grace
Where can you go where you will be safe
From this mad dog world, oh where

We're all in heat, tail to tail
Win or lose no matter what you choose
The future's pale
Can't satisfy those lusty eyes
'Cause it's a mad dog world

Where can you run to away from this place?
Into the arms of goodness and grace?
Where can you go where you will be safe?
From this mad dog world, oh where?

Wolves are dining on fresh meat
While the pups eat scraps that fall at their feet
Their longest fangs lead the pack
Runnin' hard 'cause they're clawin' at your back

Where can you run to away from this place?
Into the arms of goodness and grace?
Where can you go where you will be safe?
From this mad dog world, oh where?
