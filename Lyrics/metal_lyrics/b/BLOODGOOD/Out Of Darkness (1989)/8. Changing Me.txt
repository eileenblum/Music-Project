I can only hope to see what is changing me
Being here like I am
The world is spinning faster heading for disaster
He's changing me, Yeah changing me

Turn on light in the dark, I can't see
I can't taste what I'm eating
The earth is being tread upon and bled upon
Blood dripping to the sea

He holds the world in His hand
He took the keys and showed us His plan
He is the One who brought me down to my knees

I can only pray to find how to deal with this bind
Being here like I am
The world is spinning faster heading for disaster
He's changing me, yeah changing me

Turn on light in the dark, I can't see
I can't taste what I'm eating
The earth is being tread upon and bled upon
Blood dripping to the sea

He holds the world in His hand
He took they keys and showed us His plan
He is the one who brought me down to me knees

He holds the world in His hand
He took they keys and showed us His plan
He is the one who brought me down to me knees

Turn on light in the dark I can't see
I can't taste what I'm eating
The earth is being tread upon and bled upon
Blood dripping to the sea

He holds the world in His hand
He took they keys and showed us His plan
He is the one who brought me down to me knees

Bring on the sleigh I want to slide away
Are you hot? Are you freezing?
Slide away there's a price to pay
Are you hot? Are you freezing?
