He's a smile on the face of a killer
A charm on the end of a chain
A hurricane blowing out of it's mind
That washes the ruin with rain

He's a beast that appears beauty
A trap just waiting to snap
He's not what he appears to be
He's a con man with a great rap

He feels so clever when he pulls the lever
That makes you part of his show
Evil runs wild with a long lost child
Let my people go

He hides in dirty trash cans and in garbage on the street
Or palaces that belong to kings
But he never hides in the beat

He feels so clever when he pulls the lever
That makes you part of his show
Evil runs wild with a long lost child
Let my people go

He hides in dirty trash cans and in garbage on the street
Or palaces that belong to kings
But he never hides in the beat

He feels so clever when he pulls the lever
That makes you part of his show
Evil runs wild with a long lost child
Let my people go
