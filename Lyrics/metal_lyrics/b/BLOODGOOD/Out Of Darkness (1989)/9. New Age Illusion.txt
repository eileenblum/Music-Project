Straight from Hell, tongue of deception
With their words mystify they are breeding a lie
To deceive you
Dancers dream, new age illusion
'Cause it's only a whim you'll be out on a limb
Can't look back

Don't let those demons haunt you, they'll run if you pray
Don't let this witchcraft blind, turn you away

Jesus, call on Jesus
Look what He done for me
Jesus, call on Jesus
Get down on your knees

House of glass, crystal cathedral
But a positive mind will just make your heart blind
You're still lost
Visualize, Satan will lead you
But it won't change a thing and the demons will sing,
"What a fool!"

Don't let religion haunt you, lead you astray
Don't let these teachings bind you, call on His name

Jesus, call on Jesus
Look what He done for me
Jesus, call on Jesus
Get down on your knees
