I remember when you came knocking on my door
I wouldn't let you in
I kept hiding but you kept trying
And now my life is so much more

Hold me and believe me, on your Word I'll stand
Love me forever, make me understand

Every morning my heart is singing of your love
Renewing my soul
I will praise you and lift my hands to you Lord
I'll never let you go

Search me and know me on Your word I'll stand
Guide me and hide me in Your mighty hands

I will climb to the top of the mountain on my knees
Just to be with you
I will ride on the wings of the wind
'Cause I believe, I believe in You

I remember when you came knocking at my door
I wouldn't let you in
I kept hiding but you kept trying
And now my life is so much more

Hold me and believe me, on Your Word I'll stand
Love me forever, make me understand

Hold me and believe me, on Your Word I'll stand
Love me forever, make me understand

I will climb to the top of the mountain
On my knees, just to be with you
I will ride on the wings of the wind
'Cause I believe, I believe in You
