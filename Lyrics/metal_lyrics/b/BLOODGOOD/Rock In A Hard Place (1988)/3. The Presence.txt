I can't say what happened for sure
All I know is that I don't have that fear anymore
Something big has taken hold
And now my life is not my own anymore

In the presence, anymore, in the presence

The power came over me
And brought me down to my knees
Raised me up and set me high
Now I'm always there 'til the day I die

In the presence, in the presence
In the presence, in the presence

One on one I see Him always staring face to face
Closer, closer, always pulling towards His Holy grace
When I fall He's there to pick me up
With nail prints in His hands
In His blood that covers all around
I plea the righteous stand

One on one I see Him always staring face to face
Closer, closer, always pulling towards His Holy grace

In the presence, in the presence
In the presence, in the presence

15,000 years of man falling from His opened hand
His love for us counts more than grains of sand

Peace will roll on and on
His kingdom stands forever strong
The righteous words of praise to Him belong

In the shadow of His wings I wait
'Til death is past and hope is fate
Unveil the Bride which vows will never break

In the presence, in the presence
In the presence, in the presence
