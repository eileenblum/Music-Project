Too late to say what I feel
She's gone and the pain is so real
It was only a moment ago
I heard her words so clear
Now all that's left is a memory
Alone with my tears... She's gone

This hate burns inside of me
So dark I can't begin to see
All of God's creation watched
But had nothing to say
Now I regret anything I said
That hurt her in any way

'Cause now she's gone, nothing left to say
She's gone, no more light of day

I was there when they dropped her down
Inside the cold, cold earth
Blank stares and hopeful prayers
From those who felt this curse

She's gone
She's gone

I was there when they dropped her down
Inside the cold, cold earth
Yes, we all mourn the dead
While others arrive in birth

'Cause she's gone, nothing left to say
She's gone, no more light of day
She's gone, nothing left to say
She's gone, no more light, no more light of day
She's gone
