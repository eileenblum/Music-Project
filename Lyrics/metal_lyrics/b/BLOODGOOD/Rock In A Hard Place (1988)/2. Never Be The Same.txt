Pick me up, help me through the night
I'm So alone, gotta make it right

I need to feel Your touch
Right from the start

Help me, Lord, gonna lean on You
Touch me now, gotta see me through

I need Your guiding light
Right from the start
You are my only hope
I need Your heart

I am calling You
I am reaching out to You
I will never be the same

See me now, never turnin' back
Watch me now, stayin' on the track

I need Your guiding light
Right from the start
You are my only hope
I need Your heart

I am calling You
I am reaching out to You
I will never be the same
