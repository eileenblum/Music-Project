My heart is breaking as I walk alone
My spirit's aching out here on my own
Following a dream too good to be true
Is there any hope, tell me what can I do?

My tears are burning, living in despair
I turn my head to God, is He really there
Looking for answers, nowhere else to turn
All those years for nothing, did I ever learn?

What have I done?
What have I done?
I turned my back on You
The only one
The only one who ever loved me

My life's a ruin, I labored in vain
All I feel is sorrow, spend my days in shame
Words come to haunt me, visions in my head
Wishing I was someone else, wishing I was dead

What have I done?
What have I done?
I turned my back on You
The only one
The only one who ever loved me

How can I deny it
Now I'm all alone, all alone

What have I done?
What have I done?
I turned my back on You
The only one
The only one who ever loved me
