Don't be talkin' 'bout nobody else
You got enough trouble by yourself
Your heart's broken and so is mine
Ya better watch what you say next time

There's a Man who lives upstairs
He's the one who answers prayers
Let the holy rollin' dance begin
As the saints come marching in

Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin' it

He's a sinner thought he'd never be found
He got caught with his own pants down
Can't imagine how he must've felt
He should've tightened up his Bible belt

Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin' it

Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin', oooh yeah
Who will stand and who will fall?
Who will be there after all?
Shakin', shakin' His body

Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin', shakin' His body
Shakin' it
