There's a high speed chase on a freeway
While an old man pushes a broom
There's a young boy sleepin', a widow weepin'
And an artist paintin' a tune

There's an old woman beggin' for money
While a young kid's locked in his room
There's a rape victim screamin'
A little child dreamin' about growin' up too soon

And the world keeps movin' around
Yeah, the world keeps beatin' you down
With every beat of the drum the Kingdom will come
And free anyone who is bound

There's a fat man walkin' his dog
And there's a dead man in a tomb
A teenager cruisin'
A lawyer who's losin'
And a junkie fillin' a spoon

And the world keeps movin' around
Yeah, the world keeps beatin' you down
With every beat of the drum
The kingdom will come
And free anyone who is bound

He knows there's pain, but there is healing on His wings
His time's not come, but when it does we will sing
In His heart and in His eyes with every tear-drop He calls your name
And He says I want you home, my child
'Til then, there'll be pain

And the world keeps movin' around
Yeah, the world keeps beatin' you down
With every beat of the drum
The kingdom will come
And free anyone who is bound

And as the world keeps movin' around
You know His love can always be found
Within a beat of His heart the darkness must part
As the chains fall to the ground

Freedom... freedom

(There's a police raid down at the beach house
There's a wino about to consume
And a crime committed
A defendant acquitted
And a dog that's barkin' at the moon)

Freedom... freedom... freedom
