The light in your eyes and the touch of your hands
The warmth of that smile when you look at me
The way that you move around and through my life
I know it's the way that it's meant to be

I know you see me when I'm standing in the dark
You can't help cryin' out for every broken heart
'Cause you're heaven, heaven on earth

You are my desire, you are my fuel and fire
I trust in you for everything I need
The way that you move around and through my life
You come alive with every line I read

I know you see me when I'm standing in the dark
You can't help cryin' out for every broken heart
'Cause you're heaven, heaven on earth

You are my desire, you are my fuel and fire
I trust in you for everything I need
The way that you move around and through my life
You come alive with every line I read

I know you see me when I'm standing in the dark
You can't help cryin' out for every broken heart
'Cause you're heaven, heaven on earth

Heaven on earth
Heaven, heaven, heaven
Heaven on earth
