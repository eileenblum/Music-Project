God gave Jesus a revelation
And the Lord sent His angel to John
The faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead
The ruler of the kings of all the earth
The one who loves us and has freed us from our sins
His blood has washed us clean and now He's coming
So shall it be, Amen

Seven: the number of churches
Seven: the number of spirits
Seven: the number of lamp stands made of gold

Stars and seals, the number of horns
The number of eyes lookin' at you:
Seven... seven
The number of crowns
The number of plagues
The number of bowls made of gold

Trumpets, how many trumpets
How much thunder, and how many signs?:
Seven... seven

God gave Jesus a revelation
And the Lord sent His angel to John
God gave Jesus a revelation
And the Lord sent His angel to John
