Take a stand, stay your ground
No use in runnin', your courage found
Take up your cross and follow me
The battle's ragin', the place to be

Do or die, win or lose
Fight to the end
Do or die, stand or fall
Winner takes it all

The bullet's flyin', the armor's on
Your shield is ready, your sword is drawn
The evil grows in the final hour
We'll slay the darkness with heaven's power

Do or die, win or lose
Fight to the end
Do or die, stand or fall
Winner takes it all

The world is calling you, don't lend an ear
No compromise, there's a way out of here
The Master's calling, down on your knees
He is your strength, and your victory

Win or lose, do or die
Fight to the end
Stand or fall, tell you why
Winner takes it all
