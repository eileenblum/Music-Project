empires have been betrayed
The ruins of your damned kingdoms
foundations are now deceased
these pillars have been condemned to a world of perditions and misery

Fallacies are reigning among us
misconception of perception
the crown fragments are being torn apart
by the burdens of the world
engraved in our roots, all our hope is lost it all goes back to ashes and dust
slowly consuming our morals from the core
in the life we live and can't ignore
marching towards the road of destruction
Fallacies are reigning among us
misconception of perception
is taking over our conscience
The ruins of your damned kingdoms
fondations are now deceased how can we forget what you've become
behold the fragments of the fallen crown
