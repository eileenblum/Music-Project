[feat. Dominic D.D. from Depths Of Hatred]Demons are growing inside
lurking in silence
in the darkness
drained by your fears
here I am laying in the depths of hatred
Emerging from the roots of the earth
Arisen from the abyss
spreading the chaos to shape the new world
flooded by the sins of mankind
infected by the selfishness of the blind
vices and lies
I am sinking into a a vicious maelstrom
drifting away from myself
trapped in a storm of desolation
rising tides of dead souls
are surrounding me
levitated
by the hatred of humanity
and the tears of the damned
I am the end of your world
I am leviathan
I am your darkess nightmare, overcoming you from the inside out
I am your darkess nightmare, feeding on your fears of facing the thruth of reality and becoming an unholy monster of desolation
leviathan
I am the end of an era
a new reign of salvation
Demons are growing inside
lurking in silence
in the darkness
drained by your fears
here I am laying in the depths of hatred
I am your darkest nightmare
consuming all your fears
no one can fucking stop me from being the man I was born to be
no one can ever stop me
from being the man I was born to be
born to be
