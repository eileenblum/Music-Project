Slowly burning under the light of the sun
Left to rot in a desert of loneliness
At the edge of life and death
Waiting for my final hour to come
Left to suffer in agony
An endless pain
A torture
Between the gates of heaven and hell
I await the fatal judgment of my fate
Slowly burning under the light of the sun
Left to rot in a desert of loneliness
At the leap of faith of my existence
Lost in a void of darkness
At the leap of faith of my existence
Between the gates of heaven and hell
At the leap of faith of my existence
Seeking the end of the tunnel
Dreaming of reaching the light
Above the skies
Where the light reign and never dies
This nightmare is now over
Another one begins
My final hour is now over
Another one ends
Another one begins
Another one ends
