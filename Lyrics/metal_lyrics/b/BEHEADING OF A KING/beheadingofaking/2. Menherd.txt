Nothing is easy as it seems
Become accustomed to failure
Nothing is easy as it should
But still we beg for more
But rest assured we won't go down without a fight
Nothing is easy as it seem
Become accustomed to failure
Nothing is easy as it should
But still we beg for more
We live our life without a care for tomorrow
A generation built on false morals
Everyday we eat what is fed to us and await our doom
We're a herd prepare to be slaughtered, we're all sheep gone astray
We all live for nothing, for nothing, we all live for nothing
And we must look up to no one, to no one, and bring our enemies down with us In this world full of hunger for hate where is my place anyway
And tell me what's the use of living just to wither away
