Burning shades on a burning landscape
I see the torpor on their faces
The last feast has been eaten
We'll get to the under city
Where twilight reign
We'll meet ourselves in salvation
Within salvation
For tonight we join the rank
Of those who forever fight
Let's put ourselves in line
And prepare for the fight
Let's put ourselves in line
I am the torpor on their face

The last feast has been eaten
We'll get to the under city
Where twilight reign
We'll meet ourselves in salvation
Within salvation
Fight, rape, kill and spill
Tonight we've reached the Under city
Isn't what we wished,
Isn't what we lived for
To die in fight and fight in death
Our only regard was salvation
That's why we choose not to rot in peace
Six feet under where the maggots lies,
For eternity shall we, RUST IN BLOOD
Shall we rust in blood
Cause promises as appearances are somewhat
DECEIVING
WE ROT IN PEACE.
