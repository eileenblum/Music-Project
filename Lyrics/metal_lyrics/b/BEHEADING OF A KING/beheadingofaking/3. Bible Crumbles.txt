You know me
I'm a one man army with more then a trick up these sleeves
So nothing ever gonna stop me
You should know you
Life comes at you fast
And its gonna take all you got
To make it last
You brought me
Under your wings
Only to shelter me
From my true destiny
Settle not for less
It only makes you stronger
We live as sinners
Pretty day you make it big
Soon, fear with remorse
As the pillars of your temple
Collapse and hear your assets cry
As they burn alive
You know me
I'm so much more than this I will bite the hand that feeds me
And bring fear into man eyes
One thrust two thrust
It never stops
I can never be the man I was before It came down to this.
