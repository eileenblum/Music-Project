Your voice still echoes in my head
Like a song I can't forget
And your face is a painted portrait
But your already dead
Momentary and compulsive
The reason for my eruptions
Not to far to remember
You shouldn't of fuck with me is what I said
My face eclipsing the eyes from the light
The images becoming clearer
Head faced down with a gun to the temple
Deprivation makes me stronger
Creativity through my eyes is no less then macabre
Momentary and compulsive
The reason for my eruptions
Not to far to remember
How can I free me from myself
This addiction is forever
And your life is unimportant
Free yourself from life's despair.
