Ostracism of the walkers and banishers of integrity
I could lie and tell you that the music will be fine
Enter the chaos of the day the sound disappeared
When I first heard the last scream coming from this stone creature
I thought to myself that this was the sound that summed up this existence
The gods of the past have spoken through my mouth, as the mirror explodes in a shattering silence
Behold the false messiah
Behold the brothers of dirt
Behold this arrogance
Behold the fangs of the wolf
Behold the questions of life
Behold the fragments of time
I will not die without answers
Pandemonium
Support the force
Disharmony infested by the flies of sound
The strength of a nation that created something so strong
That it will eventually, definitely exterminate us all
Exterminate us all
The key to heaven is under your feet
The key to heaven... is under your feet
The key to the paradise
Euahhh!
Ehhyyy!
Will you take this creation of the race of men and adore it as your own son?
Accept all the consequences that might come with it?
Will you take this complete disaster for the better or for the worse.
