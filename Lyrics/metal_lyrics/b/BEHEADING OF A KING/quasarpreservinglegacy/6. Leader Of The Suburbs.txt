The laws of nature have just been bent
For the people of the imperfection
This is a calling to all of those
Who follow in silence
Don't you tell me it's nonsense
Ohhhhh!
I wear your bruises as a coat
And wear your scars as a lesson
We all decide the role we play
And the side we are committed to

Carry your name and the weight of your sins
Carry your name and the weight of the legion
Carry your name and the weight of your sins

Time as come to decide
Wether you're on my side or you're on the one of those pitiful existences
Who lead the modern era
And I'll curse this world for a better one
And i'm gonna keep on hitting

I am the leader of the suburbs

Evicerating the guts of the fearless council
Everblazing the light of a flawless living

Your legs now fail you
As the wolf devours the conscious
That lays beside your crime
I will never forget
What you did to us.

The bringer of undecision

United as one
We'll serve our own will
And they'll glorify me as the icon
Of a new concept.
