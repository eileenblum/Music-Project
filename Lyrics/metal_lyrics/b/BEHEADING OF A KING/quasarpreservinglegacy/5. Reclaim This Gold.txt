Emerge from the deep water

We sail into the dephts of this ocean

To gain evidences about his existence
We were once cursed by the prohibited gold

Will i ever know the end this time

Immerge in the deep water
Searching the forbidden treasure

A lifetime promising to treason
Salty waves invade my diseased heart
Concuding my hands to impurity

We are forever lost, but we'll never drown
The truth has been revealed
Beg the abyss as your last faithful thought

I am bringer of misery
I reign on crimson water

Emerge from your trapped corpse to lead the march

Their faces blemish at the sight of my ship

Reclaim this gold, RECLAIM THIS GOLD.
