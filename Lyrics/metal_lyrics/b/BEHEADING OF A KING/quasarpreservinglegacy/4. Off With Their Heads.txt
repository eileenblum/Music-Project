A crown adorns his face
With wretched judgement
Emblems of royalty have vanished
Suburbs are infested x 2
Now facing the blade
Up in the crimson sky

Facing the blade

Facing the war in the mind of the sane
I am crawling back to the source of wisdom
Of wisdom
And we'll make him fall
Fall as his throne crumbles

We'll make them collapse
Under the rising sun
For all to see
That their structures are taken down

New utopists
Your dreams died tonight
You the people
Your dreams died tonight

You've built so many reasons to believe the lie
No wonder why with theses wolves behind your back
This is the last time you'll ever see the sun
You realize your mistakes
As it now seems impossible to get rid of your misery
This is the the last time you will ever see the sun.
