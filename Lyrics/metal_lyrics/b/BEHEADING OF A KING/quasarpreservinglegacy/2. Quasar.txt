[feat. Alex Erian from Despised Icon]Surrender to the quasar
My body dissembles and slowly vanishes
I am consumed to death
The horizon is collapsing on itself
Surrender to the quasar
May I decline death's offer
It's barely worth it
You think the world we knew
Will bring us down
Quasar realize what you're facing

I am
Making an eye to eye contact
Craving for matter and worlds to destroy
For matter and worlds to destroy
Quasar

Realize the astral in agony
Pleading this consiousness
For our provocation was too intense
We are the architects of a revolution
We are the architects of this atmosphere
We are the builders of the basics
That rule the junkyard you're calling our world

This is the last moment
As the light in the sky loses its beauty
This is a strunghold of men
The nearest point of extinction

It's the end of innocence
Acting without consequence
At your expense, I'll have a ball
Contemplating man's downfall
I'll crush everything in my path
You'll feel the rush, the aftermath
Destroy.

I am the voice of the mute
And the ears of the deaf

And the time as come for us to try
To get out of this place alive.
