Gazing at the world from this mountaintop
Locked together; held together, mass disaster
Circle is closed as our net is dragged in
Illusion of freedom dulls your weakened senses

Gazing at the world from this mountaintop
Locked together; end together, drawing nearer
Circle is closed as our net is dragged in
Insulate and isolate together
No escape mechanical inter-dependence [2x]

There's a place within the mind; colored splendor there, you'll remember where...
A scene where beauty used to shine, never yours or mine, faded, broken lines...

Beauty, terror, secure, error, believe, decieve, this is something that can not be undone

Distrust, you must, silence, violence, be still, know that, you are
Something that never existed

There's a place within the mind; colored splendor there, you'll remember where...
A scene where beauty used to shine, never yours or mine, faded, broken lines...
Only traces are left behind. Sorry, silent stares breathing poisoned air.
Children shrieking towards the sky. Hatred they declare, and they care not where.
