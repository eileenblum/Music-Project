Father's dream; devour the twin. Sisters scream "for our sins."
They'll cut their flesh to make amends, and grasp for ghosts that savior sends.
Ghosts she sends. Those she sends... [4x]

We regress for our sins. [4x]

This road is ending. There'll be no warmth or light beyond. The sun is setting... [2x]

Ghosts she sends. Ghosts she sends... [4x]
