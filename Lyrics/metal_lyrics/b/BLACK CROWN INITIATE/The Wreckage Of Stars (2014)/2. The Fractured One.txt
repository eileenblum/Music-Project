Here it comes again, the fractured one of hostile beauty
In this life, it takes the light from our eyes
Though we try, we are not made to walk away from this,
And we gaze inside, realizing all that's died

Binding, enwinding, seducing, stolen light from our eyes

Who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
Fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind

Binding, enwinding, seducing, stolen light from our eyes

Who would not hate you for all that you'll never find?
Fear all that's near you and bless all you leave behind

(Fractured)

Forced to defend a broken process, a pitiful friend
Let us pretend that this is never needs to end
