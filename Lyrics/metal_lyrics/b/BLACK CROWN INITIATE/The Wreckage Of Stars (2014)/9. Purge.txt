I am sick man, old man, I am corpse; and I ask you for nothing
As I force my way to other shores, I'll ask you for nothing

Bind my hands, close my eyes; 
Let go of this
None is chance, all is life; 
You know of this

I am sick man, old man, I am corpse; and I ask you for nothing
As I force my way to other shores, I'll ask you for nothing

I'll go under, deep below the earth and purge;
Tear out my innards and burn
Turn the mind to darkest light and learn 
That none are real with human sight;
This human frame, a most pathetic rite
I'll purge...

Purge
(None are real with human sight)
