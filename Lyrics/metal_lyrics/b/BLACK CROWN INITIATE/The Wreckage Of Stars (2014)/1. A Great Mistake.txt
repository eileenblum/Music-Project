I, the burning arrow for the other shore 
And seething with a callous rage
A sacred object with a hollow core
And actor on an empty stage

We from the shadow will extend our hands
And turn our gaze towards the flame
The pathways darken as the poison spreads
We languish in this land of waste

I wish for a great mistake
To carry us away
And for an old beginning
Where everything's the same
May this strip our minds away
And lead us to our early graves;
Contorted and exhausted faces,
Soiled and ashamed

Writhe
Your brittle sanctum where your madness grows
A crumbling heart cursed by faith
Within, our visions are like fractured glass
We lick the venom from the blade

The red moon rises as the black rain falls
Revealing the blood upon our hands
The past we harken as the gateways close
Release the plague upon the lands

We saw the signs
And we towed the line
We're lost reflections of forgotten time
Realizing, despising

I wish for a great mistake
To carry us away
And for an old beginning
Where everything's the same
May this strip our minds away
And lead us to our early graves;
Contorted and exhausted faces,
Soiled and ashamed
