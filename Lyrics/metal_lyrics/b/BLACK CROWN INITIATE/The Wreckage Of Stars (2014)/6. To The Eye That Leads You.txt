To exist is to fear
Fear the I; fear the you
Nothing is ever true
To the eye that leads you

Consequence; 

There is a consequence

What if all you need here turns and walks away from you?
What if all you love here never thinks a thing of you?

Nothing is ever true
To the eye that leads you

This is your illness
This is your brain

Condense; compress all that you will never understand
Repress distress, and take comfort in this malady

Consequence; 

There is a consequence

What if all you need here turns and walks away from you?
What if all you love here never thinks a thing of you?
