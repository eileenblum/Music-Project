Hereâs to us, to the shells we've protected
To our futile hopes, and the selves we've projected
To shed this skin, weâll drown in the endless waves
Of all our sins and forget everything

Iâll pass on, leaving rain and the stars above
For you to hold; for you to love so much 
That youâll destroy all the things that could have surfaced
It fades away, the wreckage and our "purpose"
