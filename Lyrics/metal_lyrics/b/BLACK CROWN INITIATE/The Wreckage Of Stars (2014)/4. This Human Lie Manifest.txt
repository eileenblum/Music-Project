All we own is regret between birth and death,
The human lie manifest
There is no balance to upset, and no one to forget;
This human lie manifest
(Turning and turning)

Time is arrow
Expand and embrace us
Time is arrow
Contract and erase us

All we own is regret between birth and death,
The human lie manifest
There is no balance to upset, and no one to forget;
This human lie manifest
(Turning and turning)

Time is arrow
Expand and embrace us
Time is arrow
Contract and erase us

Here is something to remember
This will all return forever
You are nothing but a filter;
Broken and mislead forever

All we own is regret between birth and death,
The human lie manifest
There is no balance to upset, and no one to forget;
This human lie manifest
(Turning and turning)
