Behold the shape's collapse
It's (sic) sacred time has passed
One last desperate word,
And all distinction blurred

At long last...

The scourge of our eyes removed for all time
A box for a shell, a blank slate for the mind
In stripping away our eternal days,
No longer a beast. no longer a slave to the body

It lies with the body

Force the stone (close)
Tomb of gods (close)
Silence shown (close)
Tomb of gods (close)

Force the stone
Silence shown
Mind alone
All is known

The scourge of our eyes removed for all time
A box for a shell, a blank slate for the mind
In stripping away our eternal days,
No longer a beast. no longer a slave to the body

It lies with the body

Force the stone
Silence shown
Mind alone
All is known
