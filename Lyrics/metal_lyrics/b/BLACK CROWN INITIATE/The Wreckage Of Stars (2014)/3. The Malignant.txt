Bereft inside;
Malignant guards the shell with feeble pride

Body lulled to sleep; bound
Bury forms to keep...
Shrieking crooked words; near
Offer all you hold...

In the end an object upon a burning altar...

Body lulled to sleep; bound
Bury forms to keep...
Shrieking crooked words; near
Offer all you hold...

Worship the malignant, this beacon of worthlessness;
Oppose all you love
The glowing one, she moves with fear in her lying eyes;
She holds all you love

In the end an object upon a burning* altar...

Body lulled to sleep; bound
Bury forms to keep...
Shrieking crooked words; near
Offer all you hold...

[* The actual lyric sung is "broken", not "burning".]
