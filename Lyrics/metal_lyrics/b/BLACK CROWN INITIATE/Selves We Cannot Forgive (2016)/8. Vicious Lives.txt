Pouring out of you. Theyâre reaching out to you. 
The hands of love, the hands of liars; those that warned of this loss. 
Running next to you. 
Theyâre surrounding you. 
The other sides of vicious lives, the spirit of longing and loss. 
This spirit walks along a borderline. 
Yours or mine? Pay no mind. 
It speaks of nothing but wasted time. 
Yours and mine. 
Yours and mine. 
But there is nothing worth changing. 
Erase us. 
Erase us. 
But there is nothing worth changing. 
Erase us.
Erase us. 
Please, there is nothing worth changing. 
Erase us. 
Erase us. 
Please, there is nothing worth changing. 
Erase us. 
Disgrace us.
