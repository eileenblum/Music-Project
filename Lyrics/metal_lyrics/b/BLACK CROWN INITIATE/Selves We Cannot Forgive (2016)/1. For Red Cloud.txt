(fearing, breaking, clawing, shaking) Eternal, internal. 
Desperate human alive, conscience can not survive. 
Rain drops will never become the storm.
Rain drops will never becomeâ¦ Itâll always be the same for us. 
Fighting tooth and nail to ignore. 
(fearing, breaking, clawing, shaking) Eternal, internal. 
Desperate human alive, conscience can not survive. 
We sleep through crucial daysâ¦ Enemies of our descendants; we, the deceived.
Psychologically dependent on lies to believe. 
We speak in shattered waysâ¦ Enemies of our descendants; we, the deceived. Psychologically dependent on lies to believe. 
(fearing, breaking, clawing, shaking) Eternal, internal.
Desperate human alive, conscience can not survive. 
Rain drops will never become the storm. Rain drops will never becomeâ¦
