This space, not mine; a fragile body holding purest form of deathâ¦ Iâll crawl in cold, wakeful terror and clutch to my miracle; to the nothing I have left. Found, Iâm fallow; in the circles I traverse I have not felt, a sense of sin in my silence, a self in my sadness; this hand that I have dealt.
Gaze toward a setting sunâ¦ Take time, you dying onesâ¦ Our psalm is one of sorrow, our psalm is one of pain; and bitterness of knowing weâll never laugh again. The pit to hold our bodies was dug by those ordained. Our god is one of sorrow, our god is one of pain.
Those gone before. Spoken, no more. This face, not mine; a fragile body holding purest form of deathâ¦ Iâll crawl in cold, wakeful terror and clutch to my miracle; to the nothing I have left. Sound, Iâm shallow; in the circles I traverse I have not felt, a sense of sin in my silence, a self in my sadness;
As I beg toâ¦ Gaze toward a setting sunâ¦ Take time, you dying onesâ¦ Our psalm is one of sorrow, our psalm is one of pain; and bitterness of knowing weâll never laugh again.
