Broken in all its beauty. 
Processed by pallid eyes. 
Bound together in tribulation. 
Beg to see beyond the sky. 

Broken vessel shorn of beauty. 
Purity in pallid eyes. 
Lost inside its tribulation. 
Nothing lives beyond our sky. 

Hold onto hope forever. 
Devote it all with sobbing eyes. 
Love despite our wrathful nations, 
And never shake the urge to die. 

Imploding in all directions, 
As my name is forgotten. 
This broken worldly implication, 
We will never be forgiven.

Living as the selves we can not forgive. 
Leaving for the selves we can not forgive. 

Imploding in all directions, 
As my name is forgotten. 
This broken worldly implication, 
We will never be forgiven. 

Imploding in all directions,
As my name is forgotten. 
This broken worldly implication, 
Doubles back and scours me.
