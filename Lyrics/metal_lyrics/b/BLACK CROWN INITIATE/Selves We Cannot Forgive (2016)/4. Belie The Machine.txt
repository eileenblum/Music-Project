A species was chosen to lie for. 
A species was chosen to tame. 
A brain stem, emotion, and devastation; logic suppressed, spirit stripped away. 
A human was told what to stand for. 
A human was told who to blame. 
No questions for answers that retch for freedom; consumed in fire, mortar, and scorched clay.
Feign grace, save face at all cost. 
Now take our place with all that weâve lost.
Belie the machine that hurts you and you are ashamed. 
Belie the machine that breaks you and you are to blame. 
Here lie all the lives deserted, kept from the light. 
A human was told what to stand for. 
A human was told who to blame.
No questions for answers that retch for freedom;
Consumed in fire, mortar, and scorched clay. 
A reason was chosen to die for. 
A reason that no one could name. 
A grave for its creatures with no distinction. 
Logic suppressed, spirit-stripped away. 
Feign grace, save face at all cost. 
Now take our place with all that weâve lost. 
Belie the machine that hurts you and you are ashamed.
Belie the machine that breaks you and you are to blame. 
Here lie all the lives deserted, kept from the light of day. 
We will be shaken by the earth, and forsaken by the sun; as cursed rite of birth is frantically undone.
Backwards and downwards, through right and left nerves; stripped of all garments while gasping for words. 
Black sky above and infinite below, manifestations we no longer know. 
This is not a dream; this indignity. 
Writhe internally. 
Wake eternally. 
Feign grace, save face at all cost. 
Now take our place with all that weâve lost. 
Belie the machine that hurts you and you are ashamed.  
Belie the machine that breaks you and you are to blame.
