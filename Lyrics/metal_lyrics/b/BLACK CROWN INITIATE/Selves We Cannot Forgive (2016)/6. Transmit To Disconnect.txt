The depths that Iâve reached to become what you needâ¦ 
These deeds are my own but they sharply were forced out of me. 
Decaying, these dreams demolish my peace, the truth has been shown but it surely will not be set free. 
All these things were not for me, and this agony, forgone conclusion;
Timeless, hopeless, boundless lie. 
Enabled you, the reason, and this agony, forgone conclusion; timeless, hopeless, boundless lie. 
Timeless, hopeless, boundless lie. 
The depths that Iâve reached to become what you needâ¦ 
These deeds are my own but they sharply were forced out of me. 
Decaying, these dreams demolish my peace, The truth has been shown but it surely will not be set free.
Punished for my peace, so lowly even vermin will not clean flesh from broken bone, so lowly devastated sight unseen. 
â¦And all the things I canât control have slowly rotted me. I am the afferent misstep.
For all this talk of taking toll on my environment; I transmit to disconnect.
The depths that Iâve reached to become what you needâ¦ 
These deeds are my own but they sharply were forced out of me. 
Decaying, these dreams demolish my peace, the truth has been shown but it surely will not be set free. 
All these things were not for me, and this agony, forgone conclusion; timeless, hopeless, boundless lie. 
Enabled you, the reason, and this agony, forgone conclusion;
Timeless, hopeless, boundless lie. 
Timeless, hopeless, boundless lie.
