Patriarchal generations. 
Litanies of guilt and shame. 
Walk the line of his creation. 
Carry on his ghastly name. 
Mother asks her child why, the child did not let her die. 
On bed of tears the tired mother lies, her son, a man undone inside.
When all is still and silent, this deep wound is exposed. 
With broken door forced open, all other doors are closed.

(We are done fighting, tear down the sun and moon.)
