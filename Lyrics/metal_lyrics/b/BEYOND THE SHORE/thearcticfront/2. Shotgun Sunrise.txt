Words cross our lips
Laced with grace.
Stitched to every memory we ever shared.

I'd fight till the ends of the earth
Just to hang onto this
Haunting nightmare
That will never let go.
I'd fight till the ends of the earth
Just to hang on !

Storm clouded eyes will chase this sun down
Until theres nothing left.
Hands held tight,
I swear I'll never let go.

When I know the life you chose
Will end our days.
Never has this pain
Brought me to my knees.

There will be no sleep tonight.
(No sleep tonight)
There will be no sleep tonight.
(No sleep tonight)

And still I'll chase you till the end
Just to save you
From the treachery that lies ahead.

You'll search forever for a new beginning
And never see what lies right in front of you.
You'll search forever for a new beginning
And never see...

The ruins of a broken heart lay slain before you. [x3]

And still I'll chase you till the end
Just to save you
From the treachery that lies ahead
You'll search forever for a new beginning
And never see...

The ruins of this broken heart lay slain before you [x2]

This love is eternal
This love is forever
This love is eternal
This love is forever

And still i'd fight till the ends
Of this earth
Just to hang onto this
Haunting nightmare
That will never let go.

And still I'll chase you till the end
Just to save you
From the treachery that lies ahead
You'll search forever
And never see...

The ruins of a broken heart lay slain before you.

This love is eternal
This love is forever

(Never stop chasing the unbelievers.)
