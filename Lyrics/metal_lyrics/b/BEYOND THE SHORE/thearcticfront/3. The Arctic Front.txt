Im treading new ground.
What is standing between us
Now has had my heart all along.
My angel, I will forever dream.
Dream of your return.

Love.
The ice has come.
Somehow I know we'll find our way.
Constantly pushing
Against a world
That has laid diamonds in our eyes.
The ice age has come to devour us all.
This city sleeps.
Recognize.
This city sleeps.

Recognize. This city sleeps.

Your drowning your dreams.
I'm chasing my anchors.

I'm treading new ground.
And I've never felt so alive. [x2]
