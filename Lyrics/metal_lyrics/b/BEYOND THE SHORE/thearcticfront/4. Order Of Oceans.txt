I'll hold silence
As I grace the bottom
Of this ocean.
No lungs can find air here.
We have to hang on
To every waking moment.
Never sinking, never ending.

Everyone searches
For their place in this world, but will never hold the key.
The silence sings to me.
This lullaby is my saving grace.

Saving grace.

But I think you'll realize
The pain you have today
Only runs so deep.
Dancing ghosts under starless skies.
I think you'll realize
The pain you have today
Only runs so deep.
Dancing ghosts under starless skies.

Our dreams are unbreakable

Our dreams are unbreakable
Our dreams are unsinkable
Our dreams are unbreakable
Our dreams are unsinkable

The silence sings to me.
This lullaby is my saving grace. [x4]

Everyone searches
For their place in this world, but will never hold the key.
The silence sings to me.
This lullaby is my saving grace.

Is my saving grace. [x3]
