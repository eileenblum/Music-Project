Standing here on receding ground we become a little less than weightless.
As the tide carries into the abyss,
I can see black horizons closing in on this fading sun.
Yet still I stand here wishing for anything but these transgressions you've descended upon me.
Peering over a decaying shoreline, the darkest of days have begun... so sever these hands.

Thrown to the waves,
Humanity has brought this land to its ruins...
The blood leaks in.
Thrown to the sharks.

I'll never let another day pass where you hold me back.
I'll never let another day pass,
So save your breath for the depths.

Enter the realm of the sea,
Thy glass casket forever shattered it shall be.
Bound by grace our anchor claims the deep.
Limb from limb we sink, in shark infested waters.

Outlined horizons, lead ships.
Waking to the death in this crushing black oblivion,
Thunder from their jaws devoured all thats left of this shipwrecked galleon
