Upon us now, a land of fire and ice.
With an eye for deceit and a heart of piracy.

A burning essence, a sacred burial.
For the call for blood was too great.
His graceful hands of mercy,
Silence among these icy lips
That move with such mountainous treachery.
Forever close your eyes.
A burning essence, a sacred burial.

Your Highness thy crown has eternal reign. [x2]

A fire in the sky, the vital sign.
A vision of the throne has become our hope.
A fire in the sky, a vision of the throne has become our own.
Your Highness thy crown awaits eternal reign.
Your Highness thy crown has eternal reign.

What is said of all these wars for me to claim ?
These sadists will foresee the art of my forced decay.

Upon us now, a land of fire and ice.
With an eye for deceit and a heart of piracy.
A burning essence, a sacred burial.
For the call for blood was too great.
His graceful hands of mercy,
Silence among these icy lips
That move with such mountainous treachery.
Forever close your eyes.

We walk in loving arms in a kingdom where nobody dies. [x2]
