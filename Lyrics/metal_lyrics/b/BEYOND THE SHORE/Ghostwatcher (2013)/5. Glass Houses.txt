If I could reach up
And scrape the clouds out of the sky
I would rearrange them
In shapes that would leave you breathless
Not one would be the same
They would chase each other around
Until they returned to the dust as they came

The sun would hide behind the hills
Where it couldn't be found
We could walk across the ocean
As if it were glass not making a sound

Constellations of another generation are where I belong
Our navigation is only met by the passing ships on the horizon
Brushing the edge of this world

If I could reach up
And scrape the clouds out of the sky
I would rearrange them
In shapes that would leave you breathless
Not one would be the same
They would chase each other around
Until they returned to the dust as they came

The sun would hide behind the hills
Where it couldn't be found
We could walk across the ocean
As if it were glass not making a sound

Constellations of another generation are where I belong
Our navigation is only met by the passing ships on the horizon
Brushing the edge of this world

Don't give up on your dreams, son
The destination of where we need to be is hanging in the balance [2x]

Set sail far away outside this hell
Here we are more than royalty
No empty shell [2x]

Don't worry
No need to be scared
I'll keep you by my side
Write our names in the sand,
They'll be gone with the tide

Running along the water's edge is where I'll be
Avoiding strangers and monsters of the sea
