Thereâs nowhere else Iâd rather be.
Like driftwood that comes together to make the shapes of the sea.
Continents have drifted between the cracks.
A new beginning, a fresh start is all we need.
Reach around the edges and find the slave of our mind.
He doesnât mean any harm until we run wild in time.
Open pages to the extent of any imagination free to climb.
This sinking feeling can eat through the furthest of my dreams.
Desperate for the most secret hiding places, Iâve searched high and low.
And donât we all have our own, second chances always seem to hit home.
Swing for the fences, we donât want to be left alone.
