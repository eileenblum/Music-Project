Vipers say the poison we let out will always be in our veins.
Strong and sincere, inside these bones are my highways.
My lonely mind is all I can find these days to keep me sane.
So many sticks and stones are all that seem to find my name.
Bite down so the punctured wound will lose it's sting.
They say the venom will only spread if I let it.
Let it in, let it out.
There are things we hear we can live without.
Strong and sincere, beneath the bones are my highways.
To the heart is where I travel.
Hold on, the pain is only tearing you inside out.
Our words cut like knives placed behind poisonous teeth.
I wish I could sit still long enough to let the sunlight come through the windowpane.
Maybe then, Iâd find you outside right where I left you.
Strong and sincere, inside these bones are my highways.
The poison we let out will always be in our veins.
