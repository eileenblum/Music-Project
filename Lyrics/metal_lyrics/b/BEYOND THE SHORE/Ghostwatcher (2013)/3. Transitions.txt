Drift away, daydreaming into nightmares.
Alive in the structures without frames.
Teach me to count the seconds, learn all your names.
Clock watching makes it harder to find sleep.
Watch them turn back the teeth of time.
This vessel seeks the caverns of my deepest dreams.
The lights are out, but my imagination is finally free.
Remember, heavy limbs will never meet the sky.
So cross your heart and hope to fly.
A home is more than walls, bricks and mortar.
Let it run, let it run.
Your imagination has secret faces you wouldn't recognize.
Let your imagination run.
Our home is more than walls, bricks and mortar.
