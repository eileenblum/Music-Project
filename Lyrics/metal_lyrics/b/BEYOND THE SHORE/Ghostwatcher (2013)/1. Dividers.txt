I want to learn how to be the person in my dreams.
I want to learn how to be the person of your dreams.
We could draw beneath the shade, outlines of shapes to protect ourselves from sadness.
From what we know will come.
Iâd teach you to look through the mirror.
Iâd teach you to dream more.
They canât touch us here.
