I'll hold weightless words above your head
You won't even notice
The last thing on your mind was the only prize

The ocean sings a sweet song
I can see it in your eyes
Only to the grave

Collapse against the windward ground
You'll promise to be safe and sound
Watch as the limbs of the trees sway
Escape is only a breath away

I can taste the promise of better days
Oh I can taste the promise of better days
Sleepwalking on the tip of a tongue that can't pronounce
Forgotten words are the beginning stages
Far worse than our hearts we keep locked up in cages
So taste the promise of better days

Collapse against the windward ground
You'll promise to be safe and sound
Watch as the limbs of the trees sway
Escape is only a breath away

I can taste the promise of better days
Oh I can taste the promise of better days

I've watched the seasons change along with you all
The leaves from up above cut like razors as they fall
The ocean sings a sweet song
I can see it in your eyes
Only to the grave

Sleepwalking on the tip of a tongue that can't pronounce
Forgotten words are the beginning stages
Far worse than our hearts we keep locked up in cages
So taste the promise of better days

I'll hold weightless words above your head
You won't even notice
The last thing on your mind was the only prize
