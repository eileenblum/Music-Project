Teach me to walk without making a sound.
So I can roam the dark hallways of this empty town, where glass bottles cover the floors.
Youâre just basic buildings with no windows or doors.
They belong to the ships that promised to carry me away.
Through the icebergs that swore to keep me at bay.
Keep me at bay.
Through the icebergs that swore to, keep me at bay.
Teach me to fly high above the ground.
Teach me to walk without making a sound.
So I can roam the dark hallways of this empty town, where glass bottles cover the floors.
Youâre just basic buildings with no windows or doors.
Teach me to walk. High above the ground.
Closing in the weigh my eyes back to sleep.
Weigh my eyes back to sleep.
Years from now I wonât remember you, but in my dreams youâre so hard to forget.
So count backwards from nine.
Eight, seven, six, five.
As the sheep dance through your mind.
Knock out the lights as the wolves descend.
Four, three, two, one.
The floor youâre on wasn't built for this end.
