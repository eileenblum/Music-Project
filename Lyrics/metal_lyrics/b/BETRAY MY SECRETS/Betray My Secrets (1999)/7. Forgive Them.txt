You Fall Into A Hole
Into The Gap Between Weak And Strong
Eyes Blind
Peace Dying
Earth Breaks
You Fall

Eyes Blind.
You Fall.

Falling Down Life
Falling Down Pride
Your Weak Heart Feels You Dead
Deepest Hole
Feel The Fall Of Your Soul

See Justice Falls Into The World Of Lies
Cruelty Alive
Forgive Them, Forgive
Forgive Them, Forgive

Eyes Blind
Hearts Beating Death
Peace Dying
Earth Crying Misery
Forgive Them, Forgive
Forgive Them
They Did Wrong

They Did Wrong!
Forgive Them, Forgive
Forgive Them
And Mankind Fell.
Forgive Them
Forgive
Forgive Them
And Mankind Fell.

And Mankind Fell.
