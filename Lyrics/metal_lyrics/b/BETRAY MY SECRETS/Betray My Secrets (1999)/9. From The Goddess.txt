[Based On The Chant "We All Come From The Goddess" By Zsuzanna E. Budapest]

We All Come From The Goddess
And To Her We Shall Return
Like A Drop Of Rain
Flowing To The Ocean

I Close My Eyes
I Feel Your Presence
Waves Of Energy
You Spread Through Our World

Isis, Giver Of Life, Queen Of Heaven
Revealer Of Mysteries!
Astarte, Queen Of The Stars,
You Rule The Spirits Of The Dead!
Diana, Mother Of Animals,
Protectress Of All Wild Creatures!
Hecate, Goddess Of Magic,
Goddess Of The Moon!

Isis, Astarte, Diana,
Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna

Touch Her Beauty
Through The Circle Of Life
Feel Her Presence
From The First Day To The End

Demeter, Goddess Of Fertility,
Earth And Sea!
Kali, Goddess Of Destruction And Birth,
Beginning And End!
Inanna, Queen Of The Land,
Goddess Of Transformation!

Goddess, Goddess, From The Goddess
Can You Hear The Goddess?
The Goddess Is Calling!
The Goddess Is Calling...You!
Listen, The Goddess Is Calling
The Goddess, A Drop Of Rain
