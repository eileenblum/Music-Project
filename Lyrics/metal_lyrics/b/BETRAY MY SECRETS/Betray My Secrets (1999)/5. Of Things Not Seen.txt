Listen To The Voice Of The Prophet
Who Present Past And Future Sees
Whose Ears Have Heard The Holy Words
Words That Walked Among The Ancient Trees

'Till The End Of Mankind He Will Say:

âWe Are Lead To Believe A Lie
When We See Not Through The Eye
That Always Speaks Through Heart,
Through Heart And Brain"

Folly Builds An Endless Maze
Tangled Roots Perplex Its Ways
Many Stupids Falling There
They Who Lead Others But Should Be Lead

Pathless Comets, Stupids' Thoughts
Striving Aimless Through Their Life
Cruel, Jealous, Selfish Thoughts
Have Eyes Too Closed To Look Within Truth

Now On A Starbeam He Rides
With Thoughts Being In And Around Him
Words Being Storms On The Cold Calm Surface
In The Blue Depths Of Water, Deep Blue Water

Schlangen, Die Im Brennenden Feuer
Des Nichts VerglÃ¼hen
Es Sind Die Schlangen Die Im Brennenden Feuer
Des Nichts VerglÃ¼hen Und Die LÃ¼ge Verschlingen

MiÃgunst, Neid Und Eitelkeit
Tot Sein, Tot Sein
Wo Es Keine LÃ¼ge Gibt
