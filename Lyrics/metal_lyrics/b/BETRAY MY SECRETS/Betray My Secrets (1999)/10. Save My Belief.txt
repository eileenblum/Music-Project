People Doing Wounds
Piercing Through Souls
Blood Of That Mighty Pulse,
Don'T Vanish From My Heart!

They Cut Branches From My Tree
For Their Temples Of Delight
Cries Ascend The Clouds
To Escape From The Season

Save My Belief
Ease My Pain
Save My Belief
Give Me Faith

Earth Changed To Hell
In Eternal Space

I Fly Around The Circle Of The World
Wind'S Last Breath Had Tossed The Air
And No Living Thing Is To Be Seen
After I Watered Earth With My Tears

Cruelty Had A Human Heart
Jealousy A Human Face
Mighty Man In Their Misery Dead
And Their Hearts Hidden By Sins

Silence Is The Sound Of Peace
The Voice Of Solitude And Innocense
Now Lying Around The World
The Only Sound My Soul'S Beating...

My Soul Is Beating
It'S My Soul
My Soul'S Beating
