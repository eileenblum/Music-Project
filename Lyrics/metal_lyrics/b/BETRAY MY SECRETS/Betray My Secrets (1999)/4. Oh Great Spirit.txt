[Based On A Native American-Inspired Chant Written By Adele Getty]

I Am The Great Spirit
Earth, Sun, Sky And Sea
You Are Inside And All Around Me

The Sun Does Arise, Lightens The Skies
The Merry Bells Ring To Welcome Spring
The Birds On The Trees Sing Loud All Around
To The Bells' Cheerful Sound

Oh Great Spirit,
Earth, Sun, Sky And Sea!
You Are Inside And All Around Me

I Come Towards You,
Towards The Sun, Towards The Sea
Everybody Lies Ahead Of Me
And All Around Me

I Am The Spirit
Earth Sun, Sky And Sea
You Are Inside And All Around Me

Yes, I Am The Great Spirit
The Father Of The Sea
Earth, Sun, Sky And Sea,
All Lie Ahead Of Me

I Come Towards You
Towards The Sun, Towards The Sea
Everybody Lies Ahead Of Me

Inside Of You...Can You Hear Me?
I'M Inside Of You!
Feel Me Knocking!
I Am Your Heart
I Am Inside Of You
I Am Your Spirit
Can You Feel Me?
