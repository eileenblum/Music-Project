I See Deserts On My Flight
I See Dragons In The Glowing Night
The Tigers Of Eternity
Universal As Light

I See
The Desert Queen
I Live
My Shahmanic Dream

I Sail My Ship To Sunset Skies
Through The Red Feverous Night
I Leave Behind All Misery
On The Sinking Shore Called Past

The Night Turns To Day
I See The Opening Morn
When I Awake
To Face Reality
