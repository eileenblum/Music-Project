I Know The End Has Come
And All Hearts Stop To Beat
The Light Of Knowledge Will Be Gone
A Nothing Left In Darkness
In A World Where No Road Will Run
From God To Me, Me To God

Fire, Burn!
Thunder, Roar!
Wisdom, Flee!
Give Us Back Innocense!

Wisdom Grows Pale And Dies
The Tree Of Knowledge Will Be Cut
We Ignored Nature'S Call
Pain Has Been And Will Be!
Flee, Wisdom, Flee
Give Us Back Innocense...
