Iâm still waiting for you
On the false land
Black wave crawled to the shore
Reached my hand

Crushed
I canât move
Stunned
My body â numb

In vain I'm waiting for you
Someone mighty and vast
Put an image of your mind
But couldn't comprehend mine
A bad joke?
Or misconception?

With no shame
No back thoughts
Everything
I forgive you
