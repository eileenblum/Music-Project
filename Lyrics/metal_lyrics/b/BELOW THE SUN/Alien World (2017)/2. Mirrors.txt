We came to space not to conquer
We want Earth to be itâs size
Seek to find no smart creatures
No other worlds, we need a mirrors

Weâre coming here ready to find
Loneliness, fight, wail and death
We are noble, humane and kind
Shining knights of the sacred contact
But itâs a lieâ¦
Itâs a lie!

Early years (of) civilization,
Or men intelligent more than us.
We want an icon of human creation,
We seek a mirrors

We came to space not to conquer
We want Earth to be itâs size.
Seek to find no smart creatures
No other worlds, we'll find a mirrors
