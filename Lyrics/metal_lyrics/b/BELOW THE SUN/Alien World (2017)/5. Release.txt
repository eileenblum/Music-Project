Release

Deep in the Ocean
Your reflection was created
My illusions
Drowned there on the same day

I canât believe
That itâs not a lie
Sanity left me
When you came into my life

Deep in the ocean
Let us stop abhorrent things
Please forsake me
And forgive me please
I release

Why? Why?! Why???
You came into my life
