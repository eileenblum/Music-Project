My strength is ending.
I think I never get out from this gloom.

My soul hurts.
I can't contact my home.
I'm moving forward, but I feel like I stand on the spot.
Spacescape does not change.
It seems time has stopped...
I think this is the end...

Void presses my flesh
Blackness tears my mind
Sorrow replaces indifference
I'm losing myself

Drift In Deep Space!!!
Cold, empty, devouring Drift In Deep Space!!!
This is the end...
