Hell-bent on standardization; on Cartesian deliverance.  Time is the primary socializing tool.  Indelibly imprinted and structurally biased.  We are domesticated creatures of technical abstraction.  If rationalism/reductionism is our religion, then time keeping is our benediction.  Reified and ratified in fixed ideas and solid state circuitry.  This baptism took place on the hinges of history by the faithful who made repression a cardinal requisite.  By the faithful who made the timepiece as holy as the cross.  Hell-bent on standardization: the wheel keeps turning and we all turn with it.
