The calendar year is an imperial narrative.  The seven-day week is an imperial infliction.  Circannual holidays are imperial flag-posts.  Mechanical time is an imperial installation.  The merchant workday is an imperial offering.  Greenwich MeanTime is an imperial sanction.  The looming weight, uniformly imposed; as albatross and as anchor.  The new time-imperialists will get their way with those left: the rural, the feral, the frail.  Feed them a thread, that leads to a string.  They'll follow the string, until it leads to a rope, and from that rope every vestige of what was will be hung by the neck.
