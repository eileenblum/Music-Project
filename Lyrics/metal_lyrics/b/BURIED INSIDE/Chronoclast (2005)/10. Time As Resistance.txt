Time politics are power politics.  No denial, no exception.  The fallacy of science and tech is its complete objection.  All technologies are biased, this the Decadists knew: bringing a revolutionary backwash that flooded more power turbines for the clockmakers, the foremen, the officials, and the megamachine.  But the seams will split.  The myth will spoil.  The monolith will crack.  The soil will turn.  Death comes in time.  Death comes with time.
