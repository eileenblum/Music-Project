Let loose the clockwork dogs.  Pathological believers, faithful servants.  Reduced to servomechanisms with lock-step discipline and knee-jerk obedience.  Reduced to time-reckoners with Newtonian mechanics and a Promethean mandate.  Polishing and decorating each ideological cage.  Notch by notch, hammer by hammer, escape from freedom.  Prognosis: ideologies are habits of thought that defy thought and enable people to avoid thought.  Airborne contagions, communicable plagues, towing the weary down river like rudderless wrecks, and we are all sick with them.
