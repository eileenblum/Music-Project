The pace of life in the city is set by the pace of the technology that serves it;
The history that reserves it.
Mining through soot and cinder, grinding through flesh and bone;
Kroc and watt were engineers of the same breed, of the same sordid dream: volume speed efficiency.
Well hoot-dog!
Another orgy of shit.
Another disease which purported to be the cure.
Pump in the bovine hormones, dole out the shitpay.
Result: all species fall under prey under circling agri-vultures;
And in the end, cruelty is acknowledged only where profitability ceases.
Science.
Non-science.
Non-sense.
