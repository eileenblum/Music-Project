Time is money is time is regimentation, is standardization, is cyclical regularity.
Never an absolute.
The groundwork machinery; tool that consumes us.
As the pendulum swings, and technics unfold;
The measure is set, the story is told.
But mathematics can't solve everything, and as the chronoclast stated: all is relative;
And wage slavery is just a side-effect.
Taking control, faking control: friction without fatigue.
We are the time-binders.
We are the time-rationers.
We are the time-keepers.
We are the time-killers.
We are the time-savers.
We are the time-servers.
We are clockwork.
