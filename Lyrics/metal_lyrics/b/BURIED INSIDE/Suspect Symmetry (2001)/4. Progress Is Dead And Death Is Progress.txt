The edifice outlives the architect.
God is dead.
Bacon is dead.
Darwin is dead.
And the landlords of romance: smith is dead.
Arkwright is dead.
Taylor is dead.
The invisible hand slit the invisible wrist.
Life was judged by the extent to which ministered to life.
Regulating motion.
Institutionalized delusions.
Some doctrines sew the seeds for their own destruction.
Drawn and quartered by the horses of historicism, determinism, chauvinism, and eugenical racism;
Progress is dead and death is progress.
