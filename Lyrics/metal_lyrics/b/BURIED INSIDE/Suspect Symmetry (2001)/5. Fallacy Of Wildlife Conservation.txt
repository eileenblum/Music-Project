The fix is on.
Fucking dead and gone.
Because if you're working within the system you are still part of the problem.
Still sanctifying renewable ressource.
Still anthropomorphizing animal rights.
Still legitimizing the utilitarian imperative: god-damned unilateral imperialism.
It's preservation of wildlife for our sake and not for it's own sake.
And this is the fallacy of resource management;
The fallacy of environmental planning;
The fallacy of sustainable development;
The fallacy of environmental impact assessment;
And the tragic flaw in all ecology.
And that's all she fucking wrote.
