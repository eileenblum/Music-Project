Sound the alarm, get an ambulance, ready a statement: for reactive critics, for the OCI, for the rest of the back end.
In these museums to living history, lined with the artifacts of threat, risk management is a precondition for every colour of self-defeat.
Mandate piled on mandate, verdicts stacked high, dust-covered and time-worn, signed by solicitors general and bound by library services.
A mounting legacy of heroic solutions and failed actions that can't be normalized and interpreted away - used to placate all the lives shamed and denied.
Custom is the greatest of weavers: devoid of useful memory and locked in fixed movements.
No small madness confusing symptoms with cause.
A convenience of definition.
Condemnation narrowed to a point.
Better to drill it in.
Benign as a bullet, meanings are inseparable from purposes.

We want to do something, and a definition is a means of doing it.
If we want certain results, than we must use certain definitions.
But no definition has any authority apart from a purpose...
[I.A. Richards, Interpretation in Teaching]
