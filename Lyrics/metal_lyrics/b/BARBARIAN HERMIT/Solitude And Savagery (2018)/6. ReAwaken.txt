Awaken, in Technicolor nightmare
Yeah!
A stranger to myself.
In a strange land, that's oh so cryptic
Not even knowing who I am.
Surrounded by the deepest oceans.
So many deceptions that confound...

We are more than a mere number.
Must I conform, or make a stand?
I'll make a stand.

Mistrust! Our self-defence has faltered.
Can't let, the death grip take a hold!
Discord will only make us fall!

Escape, is always stalked by rovers
Take me and my consciousness
Eyes reopen right back where I started
No sense can be made of madness!

Who am I? You are number 9!
Who are you? I am number 2!
Who is, number 1?
You are number 9!

...Trip over logic, right down the rabbit hole.

I start, to make sense of confusion
Realisations clear and now take hold
The sheer, power of perception
No escape for those who take the throne.

I've made sense, within this confusion
The light has returned now, to this old soul
The sheer, power within knowledge
No escape for those who took the throne.

Re-awaken, re-awaken....
Re-awaken, re-awaken....

Trip over logic, spat out the rabbit hole.
The blurred, now in focus as I regain control

Re-awaken, realise that you are one

Re-awaken, realise that we are one

...Sing!

I am one!
