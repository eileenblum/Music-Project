[Numbers indicate the Egress/Circuit of consciousness surpassed]

[1]
Take another shot, to raise the dead - infuse the veins and corrode the head
Slam another buck, fast down on the bar
We've only started, there's no too far!
Yeah, right?!
Gotta' swig it down, cold and wet
Blurred vision nectar, it is heaven sent
Batten down the hatches, gulp it down
No better time to be the clownâ¦

â¦Senselessness, on a quest, relentless, intensify awarenessâ¦

The first seal is broken, as consciousness expands,
A glimpse of colour,
Leave others spinning...but I'm comin' back around

[2]
Time for another mainframe shift
Now movin' on, right through the gears
A change is made here in this night
Peel back beyond this layer, and gain insightâ¦

â¦Senselessness, on a quest, relentless, intensify awarenessâ¦
â¦what comes next?
To infest?
A ritual test? Transcending the levels!

[3 &amp; 4]
Another gate breaks, along with the next
Prismatic perception!
Ascending a sequence...To enlightenmentâ¦

[5 &amp; 6]
Time out - feel in the groove
Drift the mood
Float up, through the next two...
Embrace the spark within you
Youâll need it as the waves hit you!

[7]
Purge till bile
A mind now erraticâ¦
Lost the self
This change is traumaticâ¦
Eyes, ears, mind
It is systematicâ¦
Now, re-start
Kaleidoscopic!

What a trip?! See through the chaotic mess.
Comprehend a grander scheme, beyond complexityâ¦
(Surpassing the pattern)

Through one more, conduit, eclipsing reality.
Becoming, more than one,
Approaching infinity...
I can see, the all, as all is one in harmony
Entering, the ultimate epiphanyâ¦

I head up the staircase, rising through, the highest step.
The final door, yeah, was all that was left. Upon the plateau, I've reached mountain top!

[9]
Having hatched out of the shell
See beyond time and space...

No more seals left!
