As I look out, I wonder aloud, at this, vast multitude before us now (raw potential)
So many dreams in words, and worlds within the words
Angles of perception
And deflection. Yet time keeps ticking on.

Right on through, keep movin' forward.
As you walk, do you even feel the ground beneath you?
The world, that surrounds, in sun or cloud
With air, breathe new life in.
To light be exposed!

In the shadowed gaps of light.
When darkness falls, it spreads across the land.
Oh, there's such a chill
Come sit beside me!
...Will it all fall apart?

Right on through, keep movin' forward!
As you look out, do you even see what lies beyond you?
The worlds, that surround, in open or shroud
With love, breathe new light in.
To life be exposed!

Become the beacons.

Relinquish all the masks we wear.
Now, embrace reason!
Recalibrate sight and vision
Perception centred,
Deflection abandoned
See right through

A prophecy against Babylon, Isaiah son of Amos saw
Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, beckon them to cross the golden gates.
These commands prepare for war, warriors summoned, to carry out wrath.
Who will survive to rejoice?
Listen, a noise on the mountains
Like that of a great multitude
Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms
Like nations massing together!

Relinquish all the masks (aware)
Now, embrace reason!
Recalibrate the sight and vision, perception re-centred, deflections abandoned,
Division forsaken!

To get us through the night, the darkest of the soul.
To rebuild the self and break right through.
