Oh, can you feel? Rising up?
Ready to explode, from within
Nothing more real than this very moment, believe me?
Absorb it as part of you.
Oh-no!

From deepest slumber, through darkest night
Without warning, I had a surprise
As I looked down, to see myself
A cloaked mass, blacker than black, hovered before me!

Such frightful memories of my history
A deep sense of dread began to take hold
I span to change my course, yet
So many, ohâ¦ can't turn to run
From these burning habits of our fury,
Scarring the hands that hold on, to it
Oh such hellfire,
Let go and feel the release. Let's dance the blues away.
Oh Lord, can you hear us?
You must believe me, I speak no lie.
Can you hear or have you escaped through the sky?
I can completely sympathize.

Ooh, will we ever learn?

You may be feeling lost, with nowhere to go.
Come with me, baby
Let's move through this land, join with me
As sand will fail
Let's make some magic, bury it deep
Upon the rock
Freeing the sun to rise and shine.
The peace of release
Though sheer willpower, I made my way home

Through the wilderness, I meandered
Avoid the seeds that make living feel like death.
As winter flowers, begin to break through the haze
The colours flow as they now bloom

Though the ethereal window â¦I slid back out
Embraced reflections now, â¦I carve my stone
No longer slave to fear... crimes and confusion
Follow the lamp that leads the wayâ¦.

One moment can transform reality. In one the void looked into me.
In another I saw all! What have I even left to say?

Follow the lamp as it leads the way.
