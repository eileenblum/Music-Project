Stepping back on the path again, coming back from the wilderness,
I've had my fill of shit now, got to say what must be saidâ¦

I've wondered through darkness, journey back to find the light.
My fuel is ignited, throttle down and hold on tight, march on!
Moving forward evermore.
The past lies behind
No stopping 'til I hit the dirt

This is what I learned, how I burned, what I pass I outlast,
Never looking back, progress is pay back!

Within this, my eye of providence, no longer blind
Sight beyond sight, forever vigilant

This is what I learned, how I burned, what I pass I outlast,
As the flame ignites, afflictions now alight!

This is what I learned, how I burned, what I pass I outlast,
No more sacrifice, fire now inside!

Reformed from what was before.
My self-restoration, never will I be broken again.
My grip is ever changing, holding on to what is sacred, understood.

Keep it inside me, perfecting the groove.
Take my hand, let's move.

Moving away, night to day, dark to light, no more sacrifice.
Moving away, night to day, dark to light, no more sacrifice.

No more sacrifice.
No more sacrifice.

Move.
Groove.
Move.
Groove.

These are truths we all find. Now, evolving our relative lives
