The rebirth of the self.
Days turn to night as a crack opens in the sky.
Silencing all hope. In that moment, reaching out.
A purge begins as cages fall apart.

Transcendent alchemy, power to create or destroy.
The sky tears further, swallowing both sun and moon
Self destruction sharpens blade, lusts for all and screams.
We hold the infinite within our very selves, beyond the wall.

Smile a fake plastic smile, for the 1000th time
Eyes glazed over
Harder than a grave
A gravestone!
Scorch the land, boil the sea, blacken the sky
As we pour our fires, our burdens, upon the earth
And watch it die!

Is it too much to ask for? To seek the light in the dark that looms
This withered corpse of hope, we must now exhume
How much time have we wasted, scorned, lost, mourned and cursed.
Shall we fade or eternally, beyond it all?

The rule of Gold, the all is one, believe and behold. I sit and drink of a smoking chaliceâ¦

The travelled path from days of old. This heart still blazes bright
Alight
A sacred formula of all that is or ever was before
Marching onward we progress our understandings step by step
All facades will fall as we walk on by beyond it all!

The path of old, from lead to gold
Within our grasp
We will out last beyond it all.

Beyond the wall.

Yeah!
