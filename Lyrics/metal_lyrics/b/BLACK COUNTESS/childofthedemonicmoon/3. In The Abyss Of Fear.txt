Unknown forces are pressing my flesh
My exhausting moaning brain
Twisting fingers and tearing the soul
Uglifying the face by the grimace of pain
Alone among the dark grey walls
In the abyss of my own fear
I suffocate in the wave of hysteria
That infected my cold blood

It'll come to take me from there
Gathering mosaic from pieces of mind
And it s me who'll see it
My helpless silhouette on the grey floor

I m not alone now and this is side by side
Everywhere around me
I feel wicked presence
And see fast increasing shadows
Something incomprehensible - scared in them
Their washy outlines and... light
The light inside ruling darkness
The light that comes to take me

It'll come to take me from there
Gathering mosaic from pieces of mind
And it s me who'll see it
My helpless silhouette on the grey floor
