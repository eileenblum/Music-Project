Return to the Sinful Earth
In the very center of a huge earth rift
On the top of a lofty rock
Surrounded by the bottomless abyss
The Palace was perfect and unassailable

Our way lay through a tottering old bridge
Eaten away by rust
Cyberia and Persephone fearlessly stepped on it
I had no choice but to follow them
We walked over the chasm
Step by step approaching the Palace
Watching strange creatures passing beneath us
Swishing the air with their leathery wings

After crossing the dilapidated bridge
We came inside the mysterious construction
My companions in skintight latex gowns
Led me solemnly to the grand hall
There I saw an impressive crowd
Crying out the name of their Mistress
And then I saw Her sitting imperiously on a throne
Selene â my matchless Goddess

She expected something from me
Evidently and ardently
I knew it and came up to her throne
And then the crowd fell silent

I bent my knees before Selene
And in the moonlight I kissed her bare feet

I could not stop sucking these sweet toes
I was getting higher and carefully licked her thighs
Studying every inch of Selene's skin with my tongue
Until I set my face between her splendid legs

And there, in the intimate shade of her dress
I sensed the scent of her fluid

At this moment the crowd behind me gasped
And I reluctantly turned around
To my surprise I found myself sitting at the bar table

In my habitual time and space
I understood that my adventure was just a dream
But then I noticed familiar female legs
Their owner turned to me
This was Selene
She beckoned me and I followed her without hesitation
