Through the Emerald Gates
I enjoyed and exulted
As now I was a part of the performance
I was inside these splendid women
While their toes were in my mouth

And then I met again the eyes of my brunette
She watched me with a pleased smile
But soon she turned and left the penthouse

I was looking at her until an emerald mist obscured my eyes...

I woke up in the light of the setting sun
To the sound of waves breaking on the shore
I came to myself on a desert beach
By the voices of my new girlfriends talking nearby

Their perfect bodies were wrapped in latex gowns
Their hair was styled into amazing updos
The sluts were evidently preparing themselves to
something grand
And waited until I awoke

I rise to my feet
Shook off the dust from my black suit
And hurried to my chic companions
For explanation
