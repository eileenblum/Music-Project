Passing the Death Valley
We crossed green littoral hills
Leaving behind the waters of an unknown sea
And we faced at once the opposite
Of those tranquility and beauty

Meeting face to face with the power of the Death
We perceived its delicate devastated taste

A boundless burnt city appeared before us
With ruins of once grand skyscrapers
Collapsed stack interchanges
And endless lines of wrecked cars

I stood stunned at this desolate scenery
Looking at piles of concrete
Broken glass and various debris
Unable to control my trembling soul

And far away above the dead cityâs ruins
The Shining Palace towered splendidly

We made our way to it
