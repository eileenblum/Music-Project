The seed of cruelty is sown
Elizabeth leads a changed Eleanor to the hall
There is no more fear in Princess's eyes
But only carnal satisfaction
Recreated to seduce with her immortal young beauty
She steps along the way of new feelings without any tiredness

You come inside plunging into an atmosphere of vampiric nymphomania
Bloody bodies of exhausted knights are spread around
The smell of insatiable copulations and fresh blood excites Eleanor
The mask of nonchalance on her face is changed for the languid mask of desire

You are given with the bowls filled with red wine of opened veins
Accepting the source of life the Countess points at all around her
"Eleanor drink to the dregs and feel the whole power of Darkness
My heiress sometime it'll all belongs to you"

Your lips join together in lustful kiss again
And the tongues lovingly play between sharp fangs
Carnivorous Vamps in Red rapturously contemplate
Your supreme act of oral pleasure...

But the dawn comes near and it's the time to finish the dissolute feast
Coffins in darksome chambers wait their lecherous ladies
Elizabeth leads away the Princess and whores which are following them
Here comes the hour of ugly inhabitants of Succubia's catacomb...

Shapeless dwarves
Malicious gnomes
Corpse eaters
Crawl from miasmatic vaults of the Castle
To carry off the remains of bodies to their underground town...

Tired wayfarers
Welcome to the vicious Castle of Flesh
It's door is always opened for you...
