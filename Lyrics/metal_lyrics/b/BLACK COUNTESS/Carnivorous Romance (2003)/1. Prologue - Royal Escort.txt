"Welcome to the vicious Castle of Flesh
My door is always opened for you - wayfarers
Get rest, food, drink, divert yourselves
In honour of your Majestic Mistress"

Crooked branches of trees on a background of the Moon's face
Cold breath of the night kissing your lips
Eleanor - a noble daughter of the king
You see this picture again and again...
Your escort missed the familiar way
Leading to a small summer castle
And that is why you're in the domain of the Dark Woods
Attracted by your pure empyreal beauty

Looking at the singing stars you think about your chamber
And the shadows of the flames dancing on your splendid dress
You remember yourself sitting in an arm-chair in front of the fireplace
Virgin plunged into her own secret passions

Your loyal knights follow the unknown path
Crossing hills, gullies and mountain rivers
Vainly seeking the way to escape
From this spreading around Majesty
But soon the wood thins and recedes
Giving space to a forgotten cemetery
Your appearance is accompanied by flashing lights
A night work of monstrous Bifrons

Behind the necropolis towers the Castle's monolith
The black mystic palace on the dismal canvas of the night
Hidden from strangers' eyes by the dense coniferous forest
Succubia - the Dark Castle
The road has lead you here Eleanor

Nice child listen to the whisper of the wind and dry trees
See attracting moaning shadows and then bend your knees
The ancient Castle awaits you in the hour of the element's balance
You are given the galactic keys of your own universe
Open it
Rule it yourself

"Enter the heart of the Queen of Darkness
Through the vein - the path overgrown by weeds
A mysterious bouquet of moon flowers
Is for you Eleanor - the Princess of Innocence

Close your shining eyes of morning sky colour
Listen to your true internal voice
Smell the fragrance of my excitement
See my lascivious languid body"
