A man running in the mist of reason
You're vainly trying to get out of the Death's den...

The lust calls you to return but you are fighting with it
Overcoming the fence which's encircled the Castle like a snake
Who resisted the charms of vamps won't hide from the nightmare around
Tell better about your escape to nowhere...

You reach the familiar cemetery
But it's graves are dug out and empty
And the view of erotic phantasmagoria appears ahead
With twisting in filthy poses young Daughters of Lesbian Love

Sappho would be triumphant at watching them
Embracing and kissing in the shade of the enormous slimy creature
Fumbling with it's palpi between their vibrant legs
Giving birth to a symphony of lascivious female moans and screams

You jump into the wet dark grave
And madly masturbate without any forces to restrain yourself
At the moment of orgasm the ground disappears under you
And far below you see the fires of Gehenna

Disgusting stench of burning corpses and sewage beats the nose
You want to get out from the grave but the dirty skies soar up
Screaming and breaking the nails you scratch the soil
But the Darkness which swallowed your shade
Is devouring you like Manticora
