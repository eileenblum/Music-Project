Passing gothic pattern of an iron fence
The Royal Escort approaches the Castle's gates
Two semi-naked girls are opening it
Evoking an amazement of the tired knights

"Come inside and have rest after a long way
Succubia with pleasure will receive a lost escort of the May
For everyone got ready red wine and hot dish
You are permitted to treat yourselves by our Lady's wish"

Surrounded by her suite the Princess get into the hall
And sees a luxurious and majestic Dame from her dreams

"Many people get lost in a pine forest's mouth - it's enormous
But the one who's got out of it comes to my house
I hope you was not scared by it's dark silhouette
I'm a daughter of Lilith and Samael - my name is Elizabeth"

The Countess invites everyone to the table
Placing Princess Eleanor beside
Other servant-maids appear in the great hall
Serving each of the dear guests

Sweet taste of wine and good meal
The view of peerless female charms
Fill the veins of the noble knights
With entrancing belladonna's juice

The revelry covers the awaken Castle
With it's variegated gown
Releasing from the den a Blade of Lust
Which cuts the fruit of the Eden's Apple

Eleanor is in the ocean of desire
Elizabeth strokes the Princess under the dress
Between perfect and silken vestal thighs
Searching the gates of the Purity Temple

"You have known me - a lonely rose of human flesh
I'm the source of your lecherous thoughts
The sensual erotic splash
You're just like me - lesbo blood runs through our veins
The noble blood...
So follow me and take all sweetness of virgin pain"
