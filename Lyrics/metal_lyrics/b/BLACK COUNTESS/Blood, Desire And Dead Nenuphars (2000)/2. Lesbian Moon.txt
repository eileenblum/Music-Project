Clouds are parting giving the way to a full moon
Its light - is a seeker for chosen souls
Streaming like sweet wine from the bowl of skies
Giving life to eternal Temptresses - Whores of shades

Winged women - children of darkness, moon and sex
You see their faces under the mask of night
They are beautiful

Fullmoon erotica under their sweet languid moans
They perform their dance of seduction
Chosen girl - walking under moon
They call you join their lesbian love

You fall for their temptation
And lay on the wet grass
Down among the opening orchids
The winged creatures round you
You feel their fingers fondle
Your trembling body - they undress you

Their Queen throws off her black dress
She stays on the knees above your face
And you see her seductive sexual hole

Mistress's laying upon you embracing your flaming thighs
And soon you feel how she licks your clitoris
You also lick her cunt and moan in orgasm

Moon is lighting the orgy bewitching you
You unable to feel how their greedy mouths
Sticking into your flesh
Your pain seems sweet like wine, like sex, like moonlight
