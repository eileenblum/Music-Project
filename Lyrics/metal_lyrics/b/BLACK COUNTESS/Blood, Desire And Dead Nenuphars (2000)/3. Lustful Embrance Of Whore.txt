The wanderer under shroud of the night
Exhausted with hunger and thirst
Destiny guides you to the lost house
Heavy oak door opens and you see
The woman illuminated with light of candles
She smiles to you biting her finger sensually
Through translucent dress
Appear beautiful forms of her naked breasts
She follows you to the soft splendid bed
Puts candelabrum at its head
And brings a bowl of excellent red wine

You drink and thank her for lodging and wine
She answers with mysterious smile
And let the dress falling on the floor with ease
Staying only in narrow lacy panties
You fall silent from matchless surprise
Stopping your look between her thighs
White nenuphar in her hand arises
She puts it into your hair and whispers closing eyes

"Plunge into the world which's perfect and free
Take your forbidden fruit and cling to me
Touch my wet heated cunt, my sinny flesh
Fuck with me cause I'm so ready and fresh
Leave your past behind and let me kiss you
Let me wrap my long legs around you
I will satisfy you more and more
Because you'll don't dare to resist the Devil's Whore"

You lend yourself to her sexual voice
And Whore's laying you down your back
She's standing on her knees at your feet
In a moment you feel her fiery mouth
Covering your hardened phallus
Her tongue, lips and fingers fondle it

You see in her desirous and smiling eyes
She seizes you stripping her shameless hole
And straddling her thighs
She's thrusting her sharp polished nails into your skin
Starting sexual liaison
And terribly laughing with pleasing sin

You cum into her dead fruitless womb
Raving Whore is triumphing
Her sensual red lips's striping lengthened fangs
Her eyes is becoming black chasms
And you see her true face - face of Succubus
She throws herself on you

The wanderer under shroud of the night
Your scream - so sweet music for Daughter of Darkness
