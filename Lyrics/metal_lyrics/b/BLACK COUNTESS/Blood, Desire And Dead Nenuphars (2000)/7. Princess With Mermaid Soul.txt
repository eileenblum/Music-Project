She was a beautiful girl loving ocean
Young Princess with mermaid's soul
She felt its mighty majesty
And gave her flesh and blood
To his depth beating the stone...

Water is outlining new-born body pleasantly
It's naked
Hair creeps behind her
In harmony her movements
She is one of them now
She is a Mermaid
She is to go along her own underwater way

The death isn't the end
The death is just the beginning
And my Princess is alive again
Her element is water now...

I see her in my dreams
I hear about her from the legends
I know her...
