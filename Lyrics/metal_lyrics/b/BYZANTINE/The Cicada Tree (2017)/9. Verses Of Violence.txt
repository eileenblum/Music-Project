I never thought of you a friend
On whom my trust depends
You are a snake in all the tales
Where men went wrong
I never swallowed the lies
Or need them by my side
I can anticipate the darkness in the light

We never benefit from silence
It drags us down
And now our bearings are unknown
We'll never understand
Verses of violence
Dragging us down

And I run forever
From the glory and the praise
And I run forever
Till the end of my days

As we retrace where we went wrong
Gazed with wayward eyes for far too long

And now I look deep inside
To find words for the wise
We must eliminate the veil to see the face
And now we live in frightened times
With hearts ablaze
As we navigate this never-ending maze

We never benefit from silence
It drags us down
And now our bearings are unknown
We'll never understand
Verses of violence
Dragging us down

And I run forever
From the glory and the praise
And I run forever
Till the end of my days

As we retrace where we went wrong
Gazed with wayward eyes for far too long

My coffin dripping black
With pitch sealed by the sun
Dead flowers grip the outside
Weighing me down by the ton
The wisdom laid down
At my feet I will never receive
I'm pulled down by the body
Of my own machinery
