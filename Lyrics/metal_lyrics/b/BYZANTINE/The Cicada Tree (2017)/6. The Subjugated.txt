We've come prepared
Suspending all benevolence
You've bathed in arrogance
Our retribution we will bring
She flies on unforgiving wings
Your children in Heaven shall weep and grieve
As holy gates open and nothing leaves
So down the cattle chute you will move
And die for him who's died for you

Blinded by our pride we've missed the signs
We now beg of you, Lord, hear our cries

The scars you've made altered the plan
Our end will never be ushered by man
So down the cattle chute you will move
And the burden of Earth will be removed
You are quarantined to the abyss
With all life forms deleterious
You have lost all that you will ever lose
Your request to be saved by God, refused

Blinded by our pride we've missed the signs
We now beg of you, Lord, hear our cries
