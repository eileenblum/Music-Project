Pulling weeds of doubt and guilt
Clearing the path to clarity
Now my mind is free to think and ponder
No more squandering of time

Man will always try to surrender his free will
I have chosen never to obey
Wolves of the forest awake to a fresh kill
And you will always follow take the bait

I explore the inconceivable
The world is waiting at my door
Vicious tools of mass consumption
A trap we must ignore

Man will always try to surrender his free will
I have chosen never to obey
Wolves of the forest awake to a fresh kill
And you will always follow take the bait

I have put away belief in God
And Hell is now an afterthought
Shed myself from these restraints
And now my path is clear again

You trade the here and now for everlasting lies
Just a barrier to divide those side by side
They seek to define

Man will always try to surrender his free will
I have chosen never to obey
Wolves of the forest awake to a fresh kill
And you will always follow take the bait
