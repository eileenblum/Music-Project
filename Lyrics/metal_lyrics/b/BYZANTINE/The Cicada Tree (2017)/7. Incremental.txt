The lessons are severe
The pains of growth are needed
I do not posses the knowledge
By shielding myself from the rain

We bloom above the thorns we need
From the onset we ripen and rot
We know the bitterness of the soil
From intertwining long ago

The sign of things to come
The pleasure inside the suffering
Now guide the broken compass
Back to the point where you most learned
We bloom above the thorns we need
From the onset we ripen and rot
We know the soil's bitterness
From intertwining long ago

No more shall the weeds choke me
In increments I expand my horizon
