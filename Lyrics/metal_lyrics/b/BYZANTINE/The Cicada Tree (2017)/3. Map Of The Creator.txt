You mustn't cry for me
This is how it's meant to be
What I must do won't be forgotten
A million miles away
We're isolated by the space between
The Map of the Creator

We must inscribe the way
Hieroglyphic life contained
The more I learn
The more that I know nothing
Now you wait in the wings
The dynasty of all beautiful things
Designed by the Maker

My mind attempts to wane and wander
All of my thoughts in vain
Detachment washes over me
It's never over

I won't return unscathed from this
Astounding futility
Isolation takes its toll, subtly

Mother Earth has earned her challenge
Never to emerge the same
Cradling humanity
It's never over

I am tempted by thoughts of death
To crack the serenity
Contact has broken away
This is my reward
