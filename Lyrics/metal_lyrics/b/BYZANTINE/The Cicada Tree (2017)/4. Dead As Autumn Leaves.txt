I lie alone in silence
Of what will never be
A cry alone, empty silence
Dead as autumn leaves

We'll weave the truth
Crawling through rubble and combing
The wreckage for lies
Binding those you've victimized
All behold the hollow vacant eyes

When the dawn of the morning comes
I lie alone in silence
Of what will never be
A cry alone, empty silence
Dead as autumn leaves
Resent what you became

We seek the truth
Pausing the cower
I lay bare your unblemished guise
When the fire engulfs
And light wind blows
Stoking the pain consumed to purify

When the dawn of the morning comes
I lie alone in silence
Of what will never be
A cry alone, empty silence
Dead as autumn leaves
Resent what you became

I lie alone in silence
Of what will never be
A cry alone, empty silence
Dead as autumn leaves
Pretend that you could change
