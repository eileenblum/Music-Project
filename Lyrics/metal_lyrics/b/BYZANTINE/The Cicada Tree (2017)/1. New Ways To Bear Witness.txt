Violence imposed with max severity
Plagued by misery we canât give up the ghost
When all you know in life is partiality
You flee so easily from pillar to the post
Weâll hold the line as beatings grow
And possibilities of fatalities

One day those victimized will revolt
Against a world that views them as less
Exposing all they know through a lens the stories told
Viralized with no end

Silent eyes awake to see official crime
By those that we rely, deceiving their own kind
Whispers once low, now they shout what matters most
Streaming evidence confirms what we have known
They tow the lies, itâs no surprise
Dividing us in hopes of disharmony

One day those victimized will revolt
Against a world that views them as less
Exposing all they know
Through a lens the stories told

My children live in a different world
And I hold myself to blame
As they redefine accountability

How can I ever know whatâs good for you
When our faces are obscured by a screen
We need to touch, we need to feel, we need to hear
Or is it all just a dream

My children live in a different world
And I hope itâs not too late
As theyâre taught to love with humility
