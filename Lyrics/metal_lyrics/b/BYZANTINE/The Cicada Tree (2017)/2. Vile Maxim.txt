I will accept no more
Heirloom of hate has run its course
The result of our cowardice
A culture that educates
Through mass hypnosis

I know the strife it breeds
Toe the line or cut the strings
If you riot for change or
Look the other way and concede
They punish equally

Once more the instinct of disdain
Will feed their zealot ways
And they believe in nothing
Once more the instinct of disdain
It seems that nothing's changed
Vile maxim the masters of mankind

I won't weep for those
Relic of shame deserving burial
An out of date legacy
That has run afoul
Scheduled for castration
I walk to carry the load
Shoulder the burden
For the broken home
A weakness from within
You will not perceive
Give no quarter, no reprieve

Once more the instinct of disdain
Will feed their zealot ways
And they believe in nothing
Once more the instinct of disdain
It seems that nothing's changed
Vile maxim the masters of mankind

Now is the time we set the fires alight
I can't take anymore
This cult of intolerance
