I got the news today I've lost faith somewhere along the line
No chance for me to retrace innocence now washed away
An affair I forever reject, a puppeteer I soon will not forget
My hell is empty, the devil is here pulling my strings

Slithering silently
We suffer a snakes disease
Slithering silently
Smother out integrity

I'm searching for the moral hooks on which to hang my trust
No chance for me to retrace my good intentions drowned by lust
The levee deepens as the earthen dam begins to weaken
Surface a martyr today, a floating body tomorrow

Slithering silently
We suffer a snakes disease
Slithering silently
Smother out integrity

[Solo Tony]

I use this prosthesis one fucking last time
Then rip it away take back what's rightfully mine
We use this prosthesis one fucking last time
Than rip it away take back what's rightfully ours

Parasitic, lecherous
Maggots press their weight down upon you
Malignant, so cancerous
Stifling all you hold dear

You pierced the side and drank the wine and left me here to die
I long to lay my suffering down at the feet of my enemy
We bear the scars of the suppressed, revenge is for suppressors
I breathe in deeper today for your grip now loosened on my throat

Slithering silently
We suffer a snakes disease
Slithering silently
Smother out integrity no more
