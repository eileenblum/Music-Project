Hail the end time agenda
Bail the black art agenda

He who's down need fear no fall
He who lies for you will lie against you

Hail the end time agenda
Hail the black art agenda

It's a long road out of hell
When you refuse to do the devils work
Believe me when I say all is not well
And if I have time to kill, I'll be back for you

He who's down need fear no fall
He who lies for you will lie against you

It's a long road out of hell
When you refuse to do the devils work
Believe me when I say all is not well
And if I have time to kill, I'll be back for you

Tell me your gospel and pen it in blood
For there is no blacker ink to come clean with
Excuse me while rapid genuflections
I perform until perfection

By the grace of out God
We denounce diocese
Branded by this disease
Their communion is cheapened
Defiled without a kiss
Fueling hell by degrees
