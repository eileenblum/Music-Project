To hold a pen is to be at war
A calculated science of destruction
Consensual disarmament, dismembered
A campaign for the Armageddon
Bombs to Baghdad, Bayji, and Fallujah
Consensual dismemberment, disarmed

A call to arms in the key of rapture echoing through time
Young men coal hardened faces testing their resolve
They were taught discipline to see the battle through
From deep mines to the front lines
Centurions must sacrifice their lives

The dogs of war are pining for the corpses
Of soldiers marching ever forward
Consensual disarmament, dismembered
Dues will be paid and graves will be dug
For your sons and your daughters
My cousin now martyred
Consensual dismemberment, disarmed

A call to arms in the key of rapture echoing through time
Young men coal hardened faces testing their resolve
They were taught discipline to see the battle through
From deep mines to the front lines
Centurions must sacrifice their lives

[Solos OJ, Tony]

I'll crawl through the rubble
And scream to the heavens
Our mantra until we die
Montani Semper Liberi
Montani Semper Fi
