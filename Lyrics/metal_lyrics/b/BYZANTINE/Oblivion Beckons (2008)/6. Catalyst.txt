It's the beginning of a beautiful end
I drown again just to taste the sand
Praying to pinholes of light above
The unholy that we don't speak of

A sobering fact that my life has never meant a thing
A memory of perpetual lies
Can you see this pitiful life now on display?
An evolution of my suicide

We cast out liars
We cast out liars

These demons are mine, residing inside
Carving out the inner skull
Making ample room for more
They subdivide, evil comes in legions

A sobering fact that my life has never meant a thing
Whom the gods love shall die young
Antagonist, longing for the agony to persist
My scars shall ripen in the sun

[Solo Tony]

We cast out liars
We cast out liars
Isolated by fire
We cast out liars
