Idle hands are the devils playground
So let us inaugurate this disease
Set the blood agar to sow our greed
Don't underestimate my strength
Just to undermine my needs
Let the weeding out process
Begin with dastardly deeds

We want to live in another world
Where our hopes can just drain away
Overlooked and tossed away
We want to live in another world
No matter the cost we try
Not to live in a serene world
In God we lie

Trapped in a den of inequities
Forcing shots of insanity
It's time we find out who is the weakest species
A holy war for us all to see
Crucified on my TV screen
The final chapter in the book of man
Entitled, "Time to Die For Me: A Eulogy"

We want to live in another world
Where our hopes can just drain away
Unattended and left to fade
We want to live in another world
No matter the cost
We try not to live in a serene world
In God we die
