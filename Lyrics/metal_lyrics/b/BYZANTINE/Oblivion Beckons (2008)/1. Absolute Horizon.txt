Driven to the thorn
Unaware of the dying to come
Extinction opens her eyes
An event is on the horizon
Thank God it's time

We are bound to this earth only by the pull of the tides
For we are creatures of intelligent design

A bleak situation just got bleaker
Our ties with the maker get weaker and weaker
The absolution of what will befall you
The light at the end of the tunnel will smite you

Christ bait rising
Agnostic death
Annunaki
What do you believe to be true?

[Solo Tony]

Seas rise as trembling tears multiply, the end is nigh
Count your rosary for seasons blur their ceremony
Your beliefs are finally put to the test, how insignificant
Praise Allah, the patron saint of Armageddon

A bleak situation just got bleaker
Out ties with the maker get weaker and weaker
The absolution of what will befall us
The light at the end of the tunnel denies us
