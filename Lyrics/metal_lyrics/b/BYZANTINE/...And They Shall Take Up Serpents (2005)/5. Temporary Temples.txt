You are removed from the future database
No genetic code shall exist from this race

Hallelujah these scars are not permanent fixtures
They all shall fade away with time

[Solo: Tony]

The stars twinkle in the void
As two legged creatures scheme and dream in vain
In your minds you are temples
But in reality you are a disgrace

We give you temples of warning
Temporary signs of distress
The fissures you saunter are cracking
And your death, an imbalance it wonï¿½t make
