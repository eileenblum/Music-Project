Witch hunt is over
Six lives are over

Look to the father for the truth
The killer smiles without a tooth
Mothers weep as angels die
Witches burn for Salemï¿½s lies

These poor children gave their lives
Castrations upon the knife
Frozen still upon the ground
A life once lost without a sound

The truth will never set you free
A muting of the callow
Execute this paradise
Upon thy graves so shallow

Witch hunt is over

What we face is the price to pay
It is all debased and defiled
By the ignorant we nominate
To eradicate evidence of DNA
That would set the doves free once and for all
