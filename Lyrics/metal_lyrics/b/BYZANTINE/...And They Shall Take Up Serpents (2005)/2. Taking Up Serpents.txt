No religion persuades me but the religion inside of me
Iï¿½m alive
Tower of Babel fell for a reason the tongues that you speak is laid of flies
Your not anointed to take up the serpent youï¿½ve
backslid on all of your faith
This line to heaven shall not fit you in no room for such a disgrace

You deserve fire

Fire set alight
Burns the mark in my soul brilliantly
Rise following signs
I am catatonic the spirit is inside
Glory beï¿½

I burn all the bridges I see
We pull in sunder instantly
Embody the laws of all hate
A latticework of pseudo-faith

Why wait? Subjugate forcing the gospel outside itï¿½s own gate
This is an intimate portrait of faith of believers who fear the same fate
Lead me from hell with salvation cocktails I deny any treatment you praise
Fiction looks best when itï¿½s dipped in deceit of your
brush arbor meetings a virulent sweep in disguise

[Solo: Tony]

Fire set alight
Burns the mark in my soul brilliantly
Rise following signs
I am catatonic the spirit is inside

Glory beï¿½

I burn all the bridges I see
We pull in sunder instantly
Embody the laws of all hate
