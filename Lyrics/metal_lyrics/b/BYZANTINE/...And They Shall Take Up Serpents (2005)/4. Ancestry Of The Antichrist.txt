A fabrication woven from a burning Bush
Sent thousands to expire in a desert for oil
Our trust floats away in a pool of itï¿½s own blood
Snuffed out by our leaders to annex the soil

Fire at will

Let me reiterate we have bought into the scam
Halliburtonï¿½s running Uncle Sam
Abusing our military might
We have to stand up and fight
We cannot cave in now
We have to sacrifice all these sacred cows
Paving our solidarity
To upend a civilization that we do not decree

Fire at will

[Solo: Tony]

We lived so arrogantly
Until the trumpets screamed and burned the tips of the angels wings
So Iï¿½ll die in shameful agony
Knowing the Antichrist has a southern drawl just like me

This war ignites the flames of anarchy
Feeding on the sands of time
Letï¿½s pass the bill to kill our supremacy
Iï¿½ll be the first in line

Fire at will
Fire at will
Fire at our free will
