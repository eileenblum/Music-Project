There was a time when our bond rose above not long ago
Blinded by the allure I was running lost, navigating the lies
But I have learned from a life of mistakes to not look back at them
And never sow the deadly seeds of doubt in my mind

The Devil wants to take me again

It was a road less traveled paved with
Good intentions that brought me out of hell
And those intentions spread like ashes upon my life
And through it all I have sacrificed myself to never be the same
So who amongst you without fault come forth and cast at me

The Devil wants to take me again

No one knows the sadness that I hide
Failure breaks me down from deep inside
Feel this depression weighing down
Walls that once were gone, now they surround
