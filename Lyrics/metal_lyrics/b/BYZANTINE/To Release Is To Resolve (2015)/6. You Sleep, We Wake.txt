Hear ye, all you grovelers of Earth
You impede our constant inertia
No progression, your isolation now forms your beliefs
Our existence a truth your instruments can not perceive
You're not awake

Your will to struggle we shall deplete
Subjugation will be complete
We are still the architects of your fate, deter the disease
Our message is a mandate your answer a ballot, get off your knees
And face the truth without the filter of dogma
We don't forgive nor forget so now expect us

The deepness of sadness
Your rituals are useless now
Solutions decreasing
We bring to light your prophets false
Discoveries irreversible
Now laid upon cuneiforms
Extinction of denier's faith
Know the ally from your dominator

[Solo: Henderson]

Forever pull the plug from your light source
Now mother earth can heal through Terraform
From dark intentions of human overlords
It's time to sleep again forever more
You sleep, we wake...
