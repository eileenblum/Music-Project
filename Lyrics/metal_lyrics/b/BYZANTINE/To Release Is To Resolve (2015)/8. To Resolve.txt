Shed yourself of the albatross
There is no greater loss
For they will take you underground
Where you'll never be found

Loneliness is just a phase
But it's one that I retain
A place of comfort known to me
But to others, only pain

[Solo: Henderson]

Trust in me, my only friend
Mirror of despair
Seek a new beginning
For tomorrow won't be there

The devil wants to take me alive
All my life you'll see
The devil wants to take me again
Life you'll see
