[Solo: Henderson]

Nobody notices the difference here
Outside of me a hollow frame
I lie awake no feelings of shame
I smile when all of the fools believe
The path I've taken eroding from me
My eyes are dry they do not shed a tear
Sanctuary was taken from me
I laugh and talk and keep thinking that I'm still here

The fractured moments of our life they are lost
Hemorrhage the tears no more
You never tried to lift me up and let me fly with my own wings
Burdened by small and petty things
Our yesterdays erased, depreciation seeping from the lips, Judas
What is it like to live and love without the lies?
Tell before the seal is permanent

You fail to realize
Selfish acts will define
By grievance, you then will learn
A misery so cold
It blots out the sun, surrendered
The only one to fall will be yourself

[Solo: Henderson]

I cannot fathom what is happening
Never amnesty for me
You never tried what kind of life do you expect for me to lead?
An open wound for calm to cauterize

You fail to realize
Selfish acts will define
By grievance, you then will learn
A misery so cold
It blots out the sun, abandoned
You uttered we are done, the only words

I, let no calm groweth inside me
I, know that love is not the remedy
We arrive unsympathized
I, wave the white flag to misery
