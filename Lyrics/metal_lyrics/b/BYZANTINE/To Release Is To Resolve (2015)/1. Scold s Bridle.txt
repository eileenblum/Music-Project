We are collective entities
The framework of punishment for all to see
You've stolen something so pure to me
A life so full of shine now dulled intensity
We shall bereave

Stand up, show your identity
We decode and decrypt now with impunity
Your freedom, a fluid industry
Compiled under the guise of anonymity
Click to agree

[Solo: Henderson]

We comply and the truth is found once we toe the line
Our revelations all will be revealed
In time to the ones who seek with their open eyes
Who will be spared?

All gaze upon the scolded witch
Your speech is laden false, lies tethered inch by inch
Surveillance shall breed conformity
And press upon the tongue that speaks against me
