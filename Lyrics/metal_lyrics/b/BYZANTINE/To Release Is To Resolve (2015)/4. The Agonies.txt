Relent to the feeling you try to resist; now it has all come to this
Medicine cabinets are your treasure troves now the hunt is on
After the high a crushing low you scrape away the release because itâs slow
Driven to the mill to block the ills, pillbilly you are never alone

You were the light of your family 
A beacon of hope snuffed out before you
Everything changes nothing here stays the same
These West Virginia hills will sedate you

You rise again to fall again I cannot believe you would murder for medicine
Claw the guilt away as the crank bugs they burrow below
You wake to the misery of your life compounded from dependency
Coal mine scrip, Suboxone strips our pride is swallowed away

You were the light of your family
A beacon of hope snuffed out before you
Everything changes nothing here stays the same
These West Virginia hills will sedate you

[Solo: Henderson]

One manâs cure is another manâs malady
A door unlocked Iâm standing above you
Nothing is sacred everythingâs here to take
These West Virginia pills will sedate you
Oh, what a rush
