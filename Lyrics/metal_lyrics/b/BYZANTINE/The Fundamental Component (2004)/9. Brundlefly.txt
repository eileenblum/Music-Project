Genus specialized
Could the unthinkable to alive
Double helix split into two
My soulless metamorphosis has begun
Intake liquefied
Solids have no home to putrefy
Gravity lost it's hold on me

Now my heart palpates inside
All my organs discarded
I found a better place to hide
Inside compound eyes now gestated

Humans molecule
Decimation spearheaded by the proboscis
My soul is alive
Broken down reformed Gregor Samsa
Reflex intensified
I was once a man but the dream died
Gravity lost it's hold on me

As the wings push through my sides
All my organs interred
All my skin now falls aside
Seen from compound eyes now pupated

SIlence
Silence all humans composition
Silence
Strength immeasurable by design
Violence
Erupting on a molecular scale
Violence
Silence...
Violence
