I break your bones for the lord today
No physical demons to purge or crucify
Your holy bible just gets in the way
So stoning your Judas will free your pain

I feel so cut of from this godless word

There is no faith in your eyes
This is the one thing I despise

So gnash your teeth into the flesh today
No fallen angels to call or classify
The spirit of Judas lives in everyone
Our cross to bear is the weight of your own

There is no faith in your eyes
This is the one thing I despise

I feel so cut of from this godless word

There is no faith in your eyes
This is the one thing I despise

I feel so guilty for this whore
