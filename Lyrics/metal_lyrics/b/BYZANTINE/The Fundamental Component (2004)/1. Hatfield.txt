Help I've been detained
By these mountains that so poorly raised me
Burned out huffing gasoline
The redneck that I'm spose to be
Fuck that I'm stronger than my history
In pesticide I hide
These West Virginia hills can't sedate me

Kill your family tree, this soil is diseased

My will is broken
The black lungs have swallowed me
Viva Villa Long live the picket line in me
You want a war you've got one
You want a state with poverty
Remember 1882 because there is no excuse

Excuses are just tools of incompetence
Used to build monuments of nothingness
And those who specialize in the uses
Seldom achieve anything

Excuses are just tools of incompetence
Used to build monuments of nothingness
And those who specialize in the uses
Seldom achieve anything but excuses
