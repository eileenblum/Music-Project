The Devil's Arithmetic
I....I am your God
Outkast the sun
Science exact
Arrange my DNA recombinant
To form complete authority

Eyeless your father's led you
Shameless like sows they fed you
Cattle I penetrate your field
I desecrate you whole

My own devilization turns inside
The wick burns slowl against the side
Magnify the anomaly by nourishing
The hemorrhage of the soul

Adapt to my enviroment
On passive wills I will anneal
Your flesh is waht I mould upon
In time you will conform to the feel
Hammer upon my implement
To supplement my suffering
In time like any parasite
Discrard the host after the vile feasting

I saw God in you
A fake God in you
