[Music: Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda/Rakes]

Turn the page, fanning the flames of civil dissension
Indignation displayed with the masses looking on
Fill the role of martyr
While burning as a pyre

Strike a match, ignite the rage of passionate freewill
Sloughing skin falls from the bone faith of man revealed
Doused with fuel, a martyr
Effluviums to uprise
All issues now resolved

Cauterized in silent screams rejecting pain with zeal
Lighting fires in the minds of children in my midst

Rioting in solitude, denounce captivity
Conjuring the inner chi
Chanting through burning teeth
I shun thee... Ultracaninophile

We live in despondent times
The swarm is now paralyzed
Caldera burns bright
In your streets I clear my mind
 ~Rohrbough~
We live in despondent times
The swarm is now paralyzed
Caldera burns bright
In your streets I clear my mind
