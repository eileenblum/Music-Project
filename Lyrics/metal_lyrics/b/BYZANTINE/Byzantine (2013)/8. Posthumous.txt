[Music: Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda/Rakes]

Crawl inside my skin for just one day
Watch the fear of the coward led astray
Iâm defined by the gluttony to feel alive

Collapse from the perch on which you reside
Overcome by the need to burn you alive

Inside to reveal the lie that's always here
My infatuation is what you abhor
No matter what is at stake the blame is all the same
Crying eyes and the fear that the demons have held their sway
~Rohrbough~
Come crawl in my sin for just this day
Beaten down by the guilt and the slow decay
God grant me strength to keep up the lie

Inside to reveal the lie that's always near
My infatuation is what you abhor
No matter what is at stake the blame is all the same
Crying eyes and the fear that the demons have held their sway
~Ojeda~
Iâll never get this chance again
Infected olive branch to mend
Apologies are for the weak, the spineless
And Iâve done wrecked you
