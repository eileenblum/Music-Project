[Music: Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda]

Oblivion is thrust upon your xenophobic race
A cosmic disgrace
You kill for greed you kill for lust
A desert youâll make of your home

You are the inconceivable abomination
Your sole existence is beyond comprehension
Nauseating Homo sapiens
Abysmal mockery
Devoid of the laws of nature

Your judgment lies in a different world
From the love that you were born your forever alien
Infection never to be healed
~Rohrbough~
We are sentient divinity
Your feeble minds attempt to pluck our strings
We hide above just out of reach
Weary of bipedal leeches

Beware the beast of man for he breeds in great numbers
Praise God youâre locked away to dig for grubs in your arrogance
Such insolence
Your species on trial 
Feel the gavel of the creator

Your judgment lies in a different world
From the love that you were born your forever alien
Evil coursing through human flesh
~Rohrbough, Ojeda, Rohrbough~
