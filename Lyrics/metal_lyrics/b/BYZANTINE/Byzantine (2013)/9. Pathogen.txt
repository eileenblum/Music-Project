[Music: Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda/Rakes]

Destroy this fucking host
A god damn mass infection
Replicating uncontrolled
Colonized a billion fold

Stare out through blood soaked eyes
Widespread obliteration
Composting human hull
Sterilized by visceral insiders

These pathogens release inside
They flaunt your every weakness
Reflecting pool of humanity
Kill or be killed

Defined by the will to live
Designed for exploitation
Subjugate the Achilles heel
Breeding through our weaknesses

Continue the conquering
Innate propagation
The cunning guise of hell
A massive walking dead apocalypse

These pathogens release inside
They haunt your every footstep
Relentless hold on humanity
Kill or be killed

Our sickness is an undertaking of the mortal mind 
But desperate diseases require desperate remedies

With a goal to crush the will
Erosive, microscopic
 Assaulting of the cell
Idiopathic hemorrhage
Itâs been sent from hell
To devour all you motherfuckers now
~Rohrbough~
These pathogens release inside
They flaunt your every weakness
Reflecting pool of humanity
