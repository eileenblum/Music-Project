[Music: Rohrbough, Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda]

This world has whittled away my goodness
A graying bitter man displayed
An angel, 10 yrs old, repentant
A half dead heretic  

Embers of images playing through the Churchâs halls
A mind so full of hymns and lessons from the basement
The Holy Eucharist dissolved upon innocent tongues
Eternal backslide, Iâve lost my way

Here I am, a lamb defaced
Lost in the world of fables
The nearer to the pew 
The further from the Son and the light

In times of woe you cease to be
The rock for me to stand upon
Drowning in the sirenâs song for me
Never touch the face of love again
		~ Rohrbough~
In times of woe you cease to be
The rock for me to stand upon
Drowning in the tide that washes me
Swaying lifeless to and fro

Come to me now, why so afraid?
Your faith was tossed away 
Like branches withering and gathered for the burn
Now we come face to face, my son, the trembling apostate
This jealous God will show you what remains

I am the dumping ground of dreams unplanted in the soul 
A lantern left behind you stumble through the night
A life of broken dreams, I tear upon delicate seams
Eternal backslider youâve paved your way
