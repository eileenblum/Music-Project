[Music: Rohrbough/Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda/Rohrbough]

Explain my friend
How the mighty falls again
Hubris unbound
Found my comfort within pain

Accept your errors clear the score
Prove youâre wiser than before
Enkindle dreams left unmade
When all I touch bursts into flames

My life is to be a private funeral to see
The ship has run aground there to always anchor me

Youâve got a lot of nerve
The only enemy
Has a face that looks like me
A nihilist to the end

You forced me to go under
When in darkness I thrive
Well laid plans torn asunder
Fed to goats by my side
~Cromer, Rohrbough~
My life is to be only a catastrophe
A war that ends in silent shallow victory

You have got a lot of nerve
The only enemy
Has a face that looks like me
A nihilist to the end
