[Music: Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda/ Rakes]

A hollow grin through black teeth youâve found your way in
Your god is smiling at you from the foil
Youâve filled a vacancy in hell with your murder of crows
Itâs time to burn the bulb erase the soul

No use to lie now
You are indentured to a black tar lord
A diluted gain with vermillion stains
The peril remains
A pseudo blend of elation

When the devil reveals to be the source of your inner conflict you repress
Itâs the grinding of teeth and the opening of sores that ushers you in
~Rohrbough~
Mephitic tomb just a stoneâs throw away from your son
And now your singlewide is boarded up
A treasure gone itâs been plundered from your sunken eyes
Your mother cries she canât take no more

No use to lie now
You are indentured to a black tar lord
A diluted gain with vermillion stains
The peril remains
A pseudo blend of elation

When the devil reveals to be the source of your inner conflict you repress
Itâs the grinding of teeth and the opening of sores that ushers you in  

I crawl inside your lungs to set you free
Get thee behind me, Satan
Engulfed by the stench of self ruin
With numbness that feels complete
~ Rohrbough~
I set sorrow upon the family
Auditory hallucination
My tracks of love upon your face
We fall together into the grave
