[Music: Rohrbough/Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda]

Never will they take me alive

What do you want from me?
Come into my place of solace
Disrupting all I have ever known
You lie just to get to me
Stolen moments from my childhood
Picked clean my adolescent bones
Youâre just a thief

What is the meaning of this life?
When my southern wings were never meant for flight

Which side do you want to see from me?
The progenitor of pure evil
Which side do you want me to set free?
Nothing is gained without much pain

So low swings the pendulum
Sawing through my seasoned bones
Ripping the furrows in my skin
The sand from my life is crashing down
It drowns my purity
Descendants now outnumber friends
Long live the lie

What is the meaning of this life?
When my southern wings were never meant for flight
~ Rohrbough~
What is the meaning of this life?
When my southern wings were never meant for flight

Innocence left behind
When the childish things are wiped away by time
We have lost our sinlessness right now
