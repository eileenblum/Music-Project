[Music: Rohrbough, Ojeda, Lyrics: Ojeda, Rakes]

Hope is gone
It has slipped away from fingers now gone numb
Squeezing without ease
The engine of flesh now ceases to beat

Iâm holding on
What has seemed like years the memory is too strong
Death, he bends my ear
âLiveâ, he says âI am coming, do not fearâ

Life is slowly fading black
Iâve found my way Iâm coming back 
~Rohrbough~
Life is slowly fading black
Iâve found my way Iâm coming back to life

We all begin to die as soon as weâre born
And the end is bleak
Now I commence my last voyage
Into darkness I take the leap
And may their be no wailing at the wall when Iâm out to sea
For each sad moment of decay we rise
Thereâs much death in this life
