The wind carries us home
Tin cans recycled air end the minstrel's roam
Reunite body and mind
The walls left broken and crumbling
Oh but what did you expect
Gone for seasons of time
I've closed my eyes to dream
Woken only to have lost the spring
To bags cases and hearts on our sleeves
Held them high so they could watch them bleed
Held them high so they could watch them bleed

And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed

From up here the land a patchwork quilt
Sewn together by arthritic hands
Pursuit of passion persistent guilt
Anxious for a loving embrace
Dissolve this ache I've felt
Dissolve this ache I've felt

How could you have looked and seen anything but compassion
Left to watch alone jealous of false intentions
You'd felt it in my touch tasted it in my kiss
And still darling you screamed my affections were passionless
Despite every example of devotion every memory made
You still succumbed to boredom you let the pictures fade
You let the pictures fade
You let the pictures fade

And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
And I wear my heart on my sleeve
So you can watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
Watch it bleed
