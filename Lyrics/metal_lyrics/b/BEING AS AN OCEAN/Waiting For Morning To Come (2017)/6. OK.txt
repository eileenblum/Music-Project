"We haven't been in what you'd call love long..."
"She knew that?"
"She knew it first"

That bed of lies I felt had only begun to cut an inch
As much as you tried to hide it I know you were just dying to flip your switch
Taught to play dress up never learned to play house
Fear giving license to the words falling from your mouth

A love was lost
Your heart turned cold
And that was when
I let you go
I let you go
I let you go

Begin courses and growing lines
How could I have thought I'd be the one to drive your demons away
Romanticism seduced by the beauty of love
Those simple lines a familiar warmth turned hard and cold as stone

"I've lost track of which is love and which is hate but I'm through with being your punching bag and your referee and your battleground. I'm going to help myself"

A love was lost
Your heart turned cold
And that was when
I let you go
I let you go

Fall back to the upstairs bedroom
Way back when it all just seemed to make more sense than
Fall in place
There was a time when I felt okay
I felt okay
I felt okay
I felt okay
