Have you ever heard that love is a metaphor
A metaphor for the taste of the bottom the fall to the floor
I fall to the floor
I remember me and you
I remember what you did
I remember being numb
I remember feeling sick
For the taste of the bottom the fall to the floor
Have you ever heard that love is a metaphor
For the way you failed me and now I'm failing you

"I want you to listen very very carefully"

Like the serpent's tongue
Like the storm that shakes me
Like the hand that beats me
Until I'm black and blue
Like the autumn chill
Like the love that failed me
Let the earth remove me
Black and blue
Black and blue

Have you ever heard that death is a metaphor
A metaphor for
What if I'm not good enough
What if I'm not strong enough
What if I'm not kind enough
For what happens next
For what happens then

Like the serpent's tongue
Like the storm that shakes me
Like the hand that beats me
Until I'm black and blue
Like the autumn chill
Like the love that failed me
Let the earth remove me
Black and blue
(Until I'm black and blue)

(Like the serpent's tongue)
Like the serpent's tongue
(Like the storm that shakes me)
Like the storm that shakes me
(Like the hand that beats me black and blue)
Like the hand that beats me black and blue
(Like the autumn chill)
Like the autumn chill
(Like the love that failed me
Let the earth remove me)
Black and blue
