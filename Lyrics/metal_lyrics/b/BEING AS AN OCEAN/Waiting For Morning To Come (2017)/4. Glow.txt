There can be so much tragedy
In a smile such desperation in embrace
We all ache for a taste of humanity
As the widow for one last glimpse of her beloveds face
We long for security
Sanctuary belonging
What then prompts the heart of stone
Often the object of overlooked affections
To slash and burn before the harvest reaps what was sewn
To look half themselves in the eyes see the scars on their skin and continue to not pay fucking attention

Like street lamps we glow so dim
Shattered people shatter hopes
The four walks you shut me in
Don't be misery's company

If only more of us would choose
To look back contemplate those springs of youth
Recollections of laughter
Recall that sense of wonder
When nothing else seemed to matter
(Running through rivers swimming in fields of sunflower)
Time has a funny way of coercion
Tricks us into thinking that our past dreams
Were only passing lunacies
Better scattered to the wind
Lamenting I'll never love like my first though I've forgotten their kiss
I'll never be truly happy though I can't remember joys of heaven
I can't stop paying attention I swear I'll keep remembering

Like street lamps we glow so dim
Due to the shade in which we're placed
The four walls you shut me in
Homes were never meant to be prisons

So every time I pick up a mic
I pray my words only serve to remind
This life is what we make of it though we feel trapped in our own minds
From every morning breath we can choose
End the cycles of abuse
I'll embrace the vulnerable
I'll embrace the broken we can only show what we're shown
And I know that love is worth the risk
Blood is thicker than water of the womb let me kiss the scars on your wrists
And no matter who has told you differently
You are worth everything
