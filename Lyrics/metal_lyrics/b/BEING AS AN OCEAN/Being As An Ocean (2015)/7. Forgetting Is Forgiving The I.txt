Where our thoughts are, there we'll live
Whether it be misery or joy
Both of which life freely gives
(both of which life freely gives)
Languish in the mire of the past or steel our resolve
And leave the darkness at our back

Stand firm in the face of our sins
Owning up to all of it
Self-aware
Forgiving our shared part in it
Regret and death could never win
Self-aware

Forgiving our shared part in it
Regret and death could never win

A simple laying down of pride
Could spring a well of new
Life, but still we stay obstinate
Clenching our fists tight
We clench our fists tight
If the past be our only present
Then so becomes our future
Stained black with resentment
Infected from picking at the sutures

Forgiving our shared part in it
Regret and death could never win

Where our thoughts are, there we'll live
Whether it be misery or joy
Both of which life freely gives
(both of which life freely gives)
If the past be our only present
Then so becomes our future
Stained black with resentment
Infected from picking at the sutures

Infected from picking at the sutures

Character actors
Writing our own screenplays
Stopping to wonder
Why are all their roles all the same...

We play the victim
We play the victim...
