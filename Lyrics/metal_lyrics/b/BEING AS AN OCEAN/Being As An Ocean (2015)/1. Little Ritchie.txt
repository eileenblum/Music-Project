(How can we know Love when we were never shown it?)
Little Richie was the runt of the litter,
Given a thick hide by father and brothers.
Identified more with his sisters and mother,
Always felt a bit different from the others.
A loving marriage from the outside, but oh -
How ferociously heâd hit her.
Richie stood by the bleach white bedside.
Ma held his face in her hands while he cried.
âHush, now, precious lamb, everything will be alright.
I know how it looks but I swear heâs a good man.
Oh baby, G-d has a much bigger plan.
I have my family, I have my health, and Iâm quite content with that.â
âHow can you say this time
That it will be alright?
How can you still look in his eyes and see the love of your life?â
He works all things for good! In the end,
Itâs Love that wins!
In the end, it is Love.
In the end, it is Love.
Love was his inclination.
Belief, his dearest passion.
A beautiful escape from resentment,
Fear of the next crushing blow.

Heâd wait on his lonesome
For that blue hair in her station wagon.
Attending those Baptist services alone,
In the house of the Lord, he found purpose and a home.
Richie stood on a chair,
Peeked over the pulpit,
Reminded himself and the beloved,
Not lacking in youthful wit,
âThis is whatâs promised:
He works all things for good! In the end,
Itâs Love that wins!â
How are we to know how to Love
When every attempt is met with the back of a hand?
It would only be Love to mend the damned,
Who never grew to know compassion.
Just another unfortunate,
Beaten senseless by his olâ man.
âHow can you say this time that itâll be alright?
How can you still look in his eyes and see the love of your life?â
He works all things for good! In the end,
itâs Love that wins!
(How can we know Love, when we were never shown it? [2x])
An heirloom passed down before its day,
Legacy came
Violently to rip innocence away.
