This could be the One, the King to come and break our chains!
Ambassador of change
We were hungry, filled with fish and bread
How could we relent when legions remain well fed?

The multitude will press on, Gracious King at its head
To whom all dominion is given, no resource is spent!
We were thirsty!
Ever-flowering horde, ne'er reliant upon the spring!

[Chorus:]
We've waited in exile, in expectancy
All eyes eager towards the Sun
Knowing things had to get better eventually

I've held this endeavor in heart and mind, reflecting upon Lazarus, brought back to Life
I swear I've seen it with my own eyes
I'm assured that we shall never die

[Chorus:]
We've waited in exile, in expectancy
All eyes eager towards the Sun
Knowing things had to get better eventually

Bless the spotless sheep
The shame I feel is killing me

"Surely, Lord, it is not I!"

I stir from Sleep as I am handed the wine
Blood and body, take and eat, the Twelve, soon no longer in exile
As I kiss his cheek, I find to my defeat, a mix of Love, fear, and sadness
The Son Of Man handed over; Lamb led to slaughter

[Chorus:]
We've waited in exile, in expectancy
All eyes eager towards the Sun
Knowing things had to get better eventually
(Compliant savior loving Father.)

Bless the spotless sheep
The shame I feel is killing me
