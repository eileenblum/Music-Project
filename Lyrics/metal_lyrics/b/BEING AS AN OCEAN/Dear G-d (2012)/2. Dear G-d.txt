As I pen these things
It might literally be all I have
Ink on paper
Does any of this matter?
Then Iâm reminded of what Iâve seen
The places I love and the people Iâve been
Only Love could have brought me to this place
Holding in me a joyful heart while spit covers my face
Iâve come to forgive those whoâve wronged me
Knowing that theyâve helped make me into exactly who You intended me to be
Iâm trying my best to be a better man
Despite all my fears, I really am
I write these things to remind myself
That amidst this darkness, there still remains
Light, Hope, and a perfect plan
For the first time in my life
I am writing for the sake of writing
Living for the sake of living
Loving for the sake of loving
And Iâll live
So you can call this sort of life a hopeless endeavor
That this tiny vessel could ever endure such violent weather
Call it pointless
Iâll continue to carry out Grace none the less
I will scream it till my face is blue
There is a point to all of this and its always been You
