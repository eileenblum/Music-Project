I swear this isnât the end
But I still feel so alone
Even when Iâm surrounded by my best friends
Wordâs canât penetrate
A tree in the wind
I bend
Falling faster into the depths
Iâm falling, Iâm falling
Under such depression, I can barely even catch my breath
Words canât mend and love does not sink in
Why canât I see Your face?

Clawing at my chest
Looking for some sort of reprieve
I swear this isnât the end
But when will I feel comfortable in my own skin?

Knowing fundamental truth
Doesnât seem to matter
After such tremendous abuse
Cause Iâve worked this ground since my youth
And still, the land has yet to bare any sort of fruit
Iâll continue to toil and plow
Hoping one day Iâll make You proud
âWhat have a got to show?â
As I wipe the sweat from my brow

So tired, so tired of showing Love so deep
That most arenât even willing to feel
See what Iâve seen
Open your eyes and recognize that this is real
This season brings darkness so profound
Iâve become lost and canât seem to be found
Contorted, racked with pain
I know should feel free, yet I continue to sing this sad refrain
I canât sleep and food has lost its taste
God, Iâm so sick of this place

Then Iâm touched
By the hands of a brother
And like a rush
Passing through my exterior
I hear my name
A hush
A son, loved by a Father
Iâve been made alive again
