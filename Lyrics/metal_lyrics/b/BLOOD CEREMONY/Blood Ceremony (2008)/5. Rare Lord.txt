The universe is lawThis much i knowOf wonders conjured 'neath the magical domesThrough spells of necromancyHe prays to the signThe light of this king will dance in their minds The universe is lawIts gyres will turnAs philtres born upon demon altars burnThrough spells of necromancyInvading their mindsArmies of the night advance at his sign
