I once saw walking on my landA witch with garland in her handWhen laid upon some mottled stoneIt made the earth to shift and groan Up from the stone rose a magic treeWith faeries dancing happilyWhen purple skies began to foamAbove this tree of human bone Though some may swear they felt no fearMy soul went cold as she came nearA toad with speech,in her left handA familiar from undreamed lands Little ones you can be godsIn the black between the stars
