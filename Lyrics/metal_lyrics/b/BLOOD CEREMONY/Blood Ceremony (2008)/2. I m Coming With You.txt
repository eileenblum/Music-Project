They say these rites are dangerousThey say we are insaneI'm only here to help youFraternize with CainIt's a black mass and i'm ready to goThe dagger has been stainedWe'll call the demons you've dreamed aboutAnd soar the cosmic plane The magic cup is passingFrom the high priest's learned handThe enchanted one is sendingMagnetic thought commandsThere's a circle forming in my mindAs we invoke the devil's nameThe pentagram and the stars have alignedThe words that chill the brain
