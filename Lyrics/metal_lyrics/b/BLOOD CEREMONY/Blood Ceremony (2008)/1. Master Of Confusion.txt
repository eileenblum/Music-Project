Agliostro sits in his vault of nepenthe
The bird woman waits with a mystical hen
A spell awakens the narcotic eye
Necromantic soldiers armed with crystal scythes

Worshippers have gathered under cover of dark
The sorceress is stroking her Aeolian harp
A magnus seeks alignment of stars
Coffin-shaped citadel a door to Mars
