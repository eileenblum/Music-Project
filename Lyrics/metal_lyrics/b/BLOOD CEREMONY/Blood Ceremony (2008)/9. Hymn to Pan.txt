If granted license, what would I say?To gods who thrived in ancients daysWho've ruled the earth, the seas, the skiesNow they've gone, can anybody say why? Those few who knew the brightest sunIs fired with the light of devildomTo the crimson shrine, we'll find him thereEnter with noose and scarlet snare Pan, come with pipes and wicked cardsWith nymphs and satyrs for thy guardsIo Pan, through forest treesThrough blissful light, Pan, come to me!
