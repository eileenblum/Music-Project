The season of the witch is autumn longWeird silence falls upon the throngThey smoke black drugs with Saturn's bongAnd blast our mind with evil songI see witches in the skyFlying toward a Quaalude eye Visions of light from the demons sunGoat-headed serfs drink to this dawnA strange vintage brewed in casks oblongIn a perfumed black mass with reptile gongs
