Up in the skies
A rumbling sound
Our drunken Gods are
Tumbling down
Tumbling, tumbling
Tumbling, tumbling down
Falling with the rain
- Let them come down

Strange days indeed
In a circus - town
When all the acrobats come
Tumbling down
Tumbling, tumbling
Tumbling, tumbling down
Falling with the rain
- Let them come down

It's thundering, thundering
Thundering now
I never thought you'd
Let me down
Falling with the rain
- Let us all drown
Let it come down

Thieves and deserters
- Let it come down
To poison and perjure
- Let it come down
Arson and murder
- Let it come down
Everything into the ground
Everything into the ground
