The weather never changes
Forgotten yesterdays
At play in the aether
Begotten in the haze
All my children are as one
Within Carterhaugh
Listless they dream of demons unseen
In their bacchanal

[Chorus:]
They can't help but stay
There's nothing out there for them anyway
They can't help but stay
Tam Lin, my love, has run away

The Devil's Widow
The Devil's Widow
The Devil's Widow

Diversions and pleasures
The best in life, I say
Not given for tomorrow
Live only for today
Dead eyes wander, shielded from
The world; though it's too late
Graze my fairest. All but the rarest:
Tam Lin, the runaway

[Chorus]

You've gone and spoiled the happening
You wish to cut me loose
The things you say, you cannot mean
It's not becoming you
You used to be a shadow leaping
Upon my walls
You've split the scene and left your queen
Within Carterhaugh

The Devil's Widow [10x]
