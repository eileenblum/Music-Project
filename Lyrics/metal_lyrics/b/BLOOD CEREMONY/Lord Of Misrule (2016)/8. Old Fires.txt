Tongues of fire tell of ancient ways
Of long dead kings who ruled in pagan days
They knocked before their burning gods
Incandescent - worthy of our praise

Long ago we lost our way
Where's the thunder? Where's the light, you say?
In the darkness we retire
Let us light an endless fire

Old Fires! 
Dying embers expire; but the feeling remains
Burn bright, burn higher!
Old Fires! 
I know you see their flames

A regal sun once filled my days
When a cold wind blew in and swept our fire away
Without light how will I see you again?
Or were you ever there to find?

Long ago we lost our way
Where's the thunder? Where's the light, you say?
In the darkness we retire
Let us light an endless fire

Old Fires! 
Dying embers expire; but the feeling remains
Burn bright, burn higher!
Old Fires! 
I know you see their flames

Long ago we lost our way
Where's the thunder? Where's the light, you say?
In the darkness we retire
Let us light an endless fire

Old Fires! 
Dying embers expire; but the feeling remains
Burn bright, burn higher!
Old Fires! 
I know you see their flames
