As the light of the day slowly fades away
When our memories are all that remains
Do we fly into the past of play our endgame?
There's a case to be made, either way

As the light of the day slowly fades away
Let the coming night perform its shadow-play
If there's anything you need, just ask
Mephistopheles
Always kind with a trick up his sleeve

As the light of the day slowly fades away
See the sky open like a shallow grave
And everything it frees with a rattle and a wheeze
In the end like so many fallen leaves
