Lay down now
Lay down now
Lay down in the garden of dreams
Lay down now
Lay down now
You know nothing's as it seems

In between night and the dawn
I hear the call of an Orphie song

Phantoms, phantoms
To share this garden with me

Every corner has its fill of oleander
And each path that I see is shrouded in
Hemlock leaves
Oh so splendidly

Lay down now
Lay down now
Lay down in the garden of dreams
Lay down now
Lay down now
You know nothing's as it seems

Every night I dance among flowers
Rioting like maddened fauns
And with the light of day, my garden melts away

Every corner has its fill of oleander
And each path that I see is shrouded in
Hemlock leaves
Oh so splendidly

Eidolon
Eidolon
I'm slipping away
True love in a hothouse grave

Every night I dance among flowers
Rioting like maddened fauns
Phantoms, phantoms
To share this garden with me

Every corner has its fill of oleander
And each path that I see is shrouded in
Hemlock leaves
Oh so splendidly

Yes it's fine you see
