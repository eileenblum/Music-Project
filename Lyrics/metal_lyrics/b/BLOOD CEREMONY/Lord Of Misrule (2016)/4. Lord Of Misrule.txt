He's always known his time's at hand
His rule is someone else's dreaming
Abbot of the Saturnalia

His entourage of imps and satyrs
The lord and lady serve as waiters
Offering curious wines

It's four o'clock and getting on to dark
There's a feast of fools in the back of beyond

Master of life, master of revels
Laughter - the custom at his table
Till thirty days are up

It's four o'clock and getting on to dark
There's a feast of fools in the back of beyond

In the night we exist
Eat, make merry and get pissed

It's four o'clock and getting on to dark
There's a feast of fools in the back of beyond
