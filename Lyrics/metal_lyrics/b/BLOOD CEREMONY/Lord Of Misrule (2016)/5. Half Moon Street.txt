There's a horror in my soul
That I want so very much to know
I've learned the arts
From the worst blackguards
And now I'm living under the rose

I want to free this devilry
Hellhound running loose
Hothouse phantoms thrill my mind
If you only knew

Oh yes, I know
A place where evil grows
Like monstrous orchids in thorny rows
To rend and twist
With horrid artifice
Like Bacchus pursuing Amethyste

I want to free this devilry
Hellhound running loose
Hothouse phantoms thrill my mind
If you only knew

There's a light on Half Moon Street
In this house we often meet
As my enemies grew bolder
They moved in closer
But I'm in league with something older

And now it is time
Alive with drugs and wine
This world and all the rest I'll leave behind
Their mysteries I've been told
I've been brought deep into the fold
Of a circle unspeakably old

I want to free this devilry
Hellhound running loose
Hothouse phantoms thrill my mind
If you only knew

There's a light on Half Moon Street
London house of witchery
As my enemies grew bolder 
They moved in closer
But I'm in league with something older
