This river runs uphill, without end
And where it goes
No one knows
One simply cannot understand
You said there are no dead ends
Even so - it seems as though
We've circled back here once again
This river flows nowhere, so endlessly
If there's a way (though who's to say?)
Let this river meet the sea
We've always been here
And if we're never to reach the land
The Loreley's command
Keeps us all dreaming

[Chorus:]
And we'll sleep in the deep of a curious sea
Let them drown your soul in waves
Take my hand, bid a last farewell to the land
And here we'll stay
In the deep we will be unseasonably
Beyond the pale

This river flows nowhere, so violently
But it's the way, our only way
And ever after we shall be
And we'll go down, down, down, down, down
Much further down than we have ever been

[Chorus 2x]

If you ever want to see me again...
