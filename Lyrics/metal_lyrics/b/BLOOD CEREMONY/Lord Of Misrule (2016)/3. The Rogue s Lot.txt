How do the living raise the dead?
Up from the depths
There's much to say that's not been said
Appeal of bells
Ringing in time
Like cutting knives
A calling and a compromise
Follow the chimes - do join us in the night

[Chorus:]
In an echoing wood they sway
In the costume of their day
The dead and living dance together
It's the time and it's the weather

Common men, uncommon crimes
Long since denied
They're devils from the other side
Well now, if you hear their song
And feel compelled to stay
We'll note the time, we'll note the day
Follow the chimes - do join us in the night

[Chorus]

Rum and the devil's mob
In a dance macabre
And we've sent out invitations
To late friends abroad

[Chorus 2x]
