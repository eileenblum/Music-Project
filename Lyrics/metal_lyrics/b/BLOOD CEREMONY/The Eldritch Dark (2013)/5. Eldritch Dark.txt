Within dark wooded hills
Strange witchery's at play
It's long past
The time for
Recanting wicked ways

Hear the whisper of her blood
She's pleading for her life
Enchanting
Her body
The sacrificial knife

We send this spirit forth
Into the eldritch night
Ancient world
Forgotten
Alive through pagan rites

Now our hymns fill the air
Our prayers without light
Upon Candlemas Eve
We will an ever-night

This Candlemas Eve
Mid-winter witchery
On Candlemas Eve
This sacrifice receive
