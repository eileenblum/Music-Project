Who are you? What is your name?
You wish to leave; yet you'll remain
This night we play a most dangerous game
There is both rhyme and reason
And passion in my crimes
My name is Haddo, indeed the pleasure's mine

And I have come, to take what's mine
To possess this house, and all inside
Thoughts of the grave - drive them from your mind
You'll find your will is leaving, your life is now quite mine
Tonight, my dear, you'll be the devil's bride
Crimson-altar concubine

My name is Haddo and my will remains
To see this world away
Before another day

Beyond this world, we soon shall see
All that I've wrought with devilry
Yet what we call will not come willingly
Things of another season
Truths of another time
Tonight, my dear, you'll be the devil's bride
Crimson-altar concubine
