Will you follow me into another world?
Where shadowed images are forming
They take the shape of minstrels in a void
To play for us a song of mourning

It's quite a scene
These lords of Carnaby
Oh, they've so many folks adoring
Their joyous rites to the sun
Their endless revelries - yet;
Their tea parties do get boring

Goodbye Gemini, now sleep - your dreams, my sorcery
Goodbye Gemini, now sleep - and forget all you see
Goodbye Gemini, now sleep - I'll bind you close to me
Goodbye Gemini now sleep
