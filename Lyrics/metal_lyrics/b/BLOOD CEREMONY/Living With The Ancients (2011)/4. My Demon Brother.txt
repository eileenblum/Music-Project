Night of the devils has arrivedMy calling you should come as no surpriseI summon thee my demon, Lord of the FliesWith this commandment: thou shalt rise! Dreaming demon, open your eyesWe humbly ask of you your presence this nightWe call your name and offer sacrificeChanting forbidden hymns in black magic rites Unholy demon, my demon brother!Won't you see what we have to offer?
