The skies above have darkenedTHe stars have alignedWe're witness to a rite of black magic designMaster of witchesKing of the chaos-spherePastoral god whose altar burns with pagan fear The Great God PanBorn behind the starsThe ancients live again Song of the woodlandsPan Pipes are crying reedsHis maddened tune will lift the autumn leavesWe see the horned-oneWe see his shape assumeThe form of laughing wines &amp; sandalwood fumes
