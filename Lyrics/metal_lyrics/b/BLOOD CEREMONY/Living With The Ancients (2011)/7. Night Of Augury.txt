Look there to the mountain
That fiery bird!
Futile song echoing from days long ago

In its voice you hear hunger
No turning away
And its song pulls you under

No choice but to heed it
And making your way
Convinced by its preaching
From your templum to stray

You dared not to wander
There was no pulling away
As its song drew you under

In the flames it has found you
Jagged wings wrap around you
Your screams they turn to ashes
As the night's augury passes
