Io, Saturnalia! The gods will come tonightWe'll sit at their table, and sheir their infernal lightOh Lord of Misrule, your song is never the sameAnd you never leave one, the same as when you came Dark spirits will leave us now; the wind has filled with sighsThe roots of our witchery reach down toward the burning firesWe'll circle the hallowed tree and leave this world behindAscension through sorcery toward pleasures rare-to-find I know, I know all too wellThe wines of wizardry they're running through our spellsI know, I know all too wellThis world of death, this world of squaresWe'll leave it all for hell
