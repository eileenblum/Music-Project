Morning of the magicians
Whispering incantations
We witness the dawn, the sun's ancient fires
Invoking dark spirits to help us get higher

Morning of the magicians
Whispering incantations
Turning, we circle the eldritch pyre
Enchantments to satisfy evil desires

Morning of the magicians
I have entered a new world
Every man and woman is a star
A new season has begun
This dawn will see an ancient revelry
For what will be...
