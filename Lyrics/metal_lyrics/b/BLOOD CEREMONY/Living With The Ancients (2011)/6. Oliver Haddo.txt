Hard to please, isn't he?He asks only you let him take your mindHarvester of souls is heNecromancy and subjects of that kind Far beneath Paris streetsOur coven meets - the Sabbat is nighHaddo waits so patiently, before the altar of sacrifice Oh, will you walk away?And no, it would not be a good idea for you to strayThe rites of Haddo have begunHe's calling on the ancient onesThere are strange worlds hidden in his sorcery Many things have come to be through devilryBoth wicked and divineAs nothing ever comes for freeOur gods will need your blood as sacrifice
