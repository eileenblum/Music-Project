Take what you need forget the rest
as we proceed in our distress
as the world turns the beauty leaves
the dark failing mask you run to
while we face our disaster

the world keeps spinning faster

I canât take this I wonât make it
its hard to relate when i hear you say
you tried to destroy me
such cheap dishonesty
you failed to ignore me
now youâre descending
all the times we fought to avenge time
you lay down and surrender
come up and take away
broken dreams, unforgiven failures

This river of time
A fortune of gold
enslave my crown
revive my soul
I guess weâre fighting the hours
so make each moment yours

Iâm approaching the edge in a final defensive stand
so weâre living it up and weâre throwing away the plan
we're all in

you claw you fight but you always drown
we siege to be the true heroes now

in the failure I gained knowledge
in the memory I was let down

This river of time A fortune of gold
enslave my crown revive my soul
down stream in absence circles expand
direct the folds on a line
take my hand
