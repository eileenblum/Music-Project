It came in waves
As cycles divide and unite us
It comes in waves
These visions are unsightly

The day you walked in
Cycles divide and unite us
You should've stepped down
These visions are unsightly

Who have I become what have I done
I wish I had a path to choose from
Treading down every road
Will i see you now
I'm not ever backing down

When the page turns over
I will be found again
When the wait is over
This is our stomping ground

Regret is not an option
You know I've seldom pondered
Relief is such a pure fragile motion

Death is not an option
The story is not over
It's unlikely will we die

Resilience is our power
Driven by our actions
Our lives are here and now
