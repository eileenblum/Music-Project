It's time to react It's holding me back
If the design was built to fail
Can we avoid our absolute destruction
could you feel a sense of doubt
The first sign arrived and showed us something real

Don't hide away don't consume and delay
Begin to trace the truth of our ways
feel the need to see a direction
So we color in these imperfections
I can safely say it's love that connects us

When the weight of the world starts to break you
gravity brings down to reality
will you lift up and join me in the clouds
or stay planted to the ground

Will you cleanse your hands and eyes
From future corrupted minds

Escape from the body the bones and the flesh
Integrate soul in galactic distress
Layers and years tension and fright
The creatures beyond us in disguise
