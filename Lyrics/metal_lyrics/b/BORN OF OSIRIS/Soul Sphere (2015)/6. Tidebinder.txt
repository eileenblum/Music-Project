Unbind me from his cage I'm living in
From which I can't escape I need to get away
Unbind me from this prison, controlling so demanding
all colorless and grey
I can't take this expectations are getting in the way
Living in Silence Sheltered and afraid
If this is all that life is Then get me the fuck away

Its the timing reveal yourself Now unbind me
A cry for help
Open your eyes and make your story worth while
Reveal yourself

We've already come this far now its much too late to give in
into security its frightening how numb it feels
deny, don't descend into the grey

Running from your issues is not a strategy
restart, invent a new reality
A cry for help

Unbind me from his cage I'm living in
From which I can't escape I need to get away
Unbind me from these shadows expanding suffocating
so dark and full of hate
as I'm leaving opposition is holding me in placeThe sirens cry "emergency!"
Head to the fields
Our blood will run into weathered land
Time to face the weapon in me
