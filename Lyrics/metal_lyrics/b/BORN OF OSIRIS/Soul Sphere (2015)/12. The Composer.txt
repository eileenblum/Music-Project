and so we begin
frame by frame we pick each vision
who is your controller
who is your composer

youâre in denial and its hard to paint the picture
you've reached the end and its time to consider
moving on
don't let this pass you by
keep moving on

these complicated fragments are going over my head
when confrontation comes you scatter with regret

we all need to listen
we all need to see whats on display
rebuild what we've envisioned
fighting a battle no one will win

infatuated passion we know we're the same
our dedication has us full of intensity

and so we conclude
frame by frame we pick each vision
you are the controller
you are the composer

Thanks to travin95 for sending track #1 lyrics.
