Watch my back cause it will be in a grave next week
Watch my back cause it will be in a grave next week

Who's to know, who's to calculate
Life is meant to love and make mistakes

If I ever had a side, that could bold face lie
And get away with it every time
It would be the man, inside my head am I here or lost again, 
I keep telling myself, telling myself, this isn't how the story ends

I've come to paint the sky white and black
And when the morning comes, I won't be looking back
I know there's still beauty in the colors left to see
Somewhere, inside, I'll find the other half of me

I'll find the other half of me

The lines we break that make the shape of everyday routine
A step above the waves and chaos is simply me

Where's the heart and passion don't hold back
The frames that make each day unique as we proceed
Progress ahead the past cannot be lived again
I keep telling myself, telling myself, this isn't how the story ends

I've come to paint the sky white and black
And when the morning comes, I won't be looking back
I know there's still beauty in the colors left to see
Somewhere, inside, I'll find the other half of me

I'll find the other half of me

Who's to know, who's to calculate, it's the mystery
Life is meant to love and make mistakes

You're not lost, I'm not dead, we are moving side by side
You're not lost, I'm not dead, we are looking straight ahead
Watch my back cause it will be in a grave next week
Watch my back cause it will be in a grave next week
