I fucking lost myself again
in the heat of the moment
its a lost cause I know it
I try to be open

Still this feast will unfold
you dine and you know
how you corrupt my mind
but you can never destroy my hope

I lost myself again stuck in a free fall
you play the game and you always win
in the heat of the moment
I lost myself again your spirit is killing me
stuck in free fall pictures and memories
you play the game and you always win

I know things will remain the same
I know I didn't fix anything

So I aim to pretend this won't happen again
you can disrupt my mind
but you can never destroy my hope

You can laugh you can smile
Feel your heart is open let your spirit free
In this light I think I'm starting to see

I know that your leaving me
And I wish I could feel apathy
every time I close my eyes
all I see is your anatomy
a taste of what it used to be
pictures and memories
