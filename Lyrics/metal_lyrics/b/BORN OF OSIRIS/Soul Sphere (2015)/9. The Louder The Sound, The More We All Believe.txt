Confined in our own fashion we rise
Fantasies lie in your nightmare
You're not sticking to the point
So we're igniting every fallen dream
Fantasies lie in your nightmare

I know its more than a dream you and me so alive
A fading puzzle with one missing piece
A silent figure no words to speak
I see the faces the masterpiece
Its getting brighter and hard to breathe
Steps we've made to set us free
As we ascend the virtual grief

The louder the sound
The more we all believe
There's no time for living
With a haunting enemy
In our minds and in the people we meet
Lets lose our minds and be set free

The world we know turns at a constant speed
Like lightning we strike
Like thunder we breathe
