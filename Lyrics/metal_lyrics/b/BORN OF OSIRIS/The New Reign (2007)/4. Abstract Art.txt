Oh great shapes, you deserve this torture.
Oh great shapes you deserve this.
Let's end this conversation.
You've been so frustrated.
Get on the floor.

Torn and beaten your life lies in my hands.
A life just wasted nothing to bring it back.
[x2]

You and I withstand broken visions.
Search and destroy.
And we don't even give a fuck.
This is over with.
And we don't even give a fuck.
This is over with, and we don't even give a..
Your life lies in my hands.
Last chance to bring it back.

Don't be afraid, fade away.
[x2]
