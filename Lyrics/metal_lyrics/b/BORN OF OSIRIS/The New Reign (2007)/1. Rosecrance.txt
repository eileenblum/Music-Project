I'll be the one to reload it when there's no bodies left but you.
I won't be the one to condone it when I know that your time is through.
So don't you blink an eye cause that's all it's gonna take.
March yourself in to the end and praise it every step of the way.
March yourself in to the end.
I will find you open my eyes.
I have been blind.
I'll be the one to reload it just for you.
