Welcome to America.
Take a seat and grab a number.
Count down and don't you dare stand up.
'Cause you might just make a difference.
The city is paved without any shame and leaving your faith

has become standard grade.
Live with your falsehoods. Everyone is staring.
Everyone is watching. This is not reality.
Decide on where your soul should be.
This endless trap of treachery.
