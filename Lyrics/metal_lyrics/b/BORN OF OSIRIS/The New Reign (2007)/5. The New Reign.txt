I can't take this. Giver to the waves, I have come to destroy.
I will life this inhibition and we dawn the new day.
This is a shame calling this name out of reach.
Out of mind and with nothing left to gain.
We overcome the mundane and with nothing left to gain.
A new reason to live and with nothing to gain we are the new reign.
Sacrifice your own inspirations.
The price tags on temptation.
