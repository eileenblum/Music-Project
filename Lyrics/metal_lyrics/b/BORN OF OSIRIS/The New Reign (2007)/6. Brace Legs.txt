So distinct and out of reach.
Now we're laying awake.
We can't stop it now, don't you beg for mercy, fight

We never stop
Walk onto your death

Walk onto your death
And bring your glory back.

You chose the outcome

Pain, I'm willing to take.
Crawls through my veins
Burning sensations
It's all a mistake
Tell me your fate
Take me away.

Is it a dying wish?
Is it a fantasy?

It's not a dying wish
It's not a fallacy

[Undecipherable]

Give it up, we never stop.
