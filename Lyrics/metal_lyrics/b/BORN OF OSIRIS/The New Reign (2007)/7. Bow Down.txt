Fucking bow down!
You were the price of the killing,
While we were waiting on the other side.
The other ones were just standing,
But we were playing on the other side.
You can close your eyes.
Forget what you have seen.
Bless us all, they are guilty.
Bring back what is yours. We tried to escape but you still waste, waste away.
Nothing remains, nothing is safe. No mistakes.
You can't take what you've given away.
You were the price of the killing.
We were just playing.
