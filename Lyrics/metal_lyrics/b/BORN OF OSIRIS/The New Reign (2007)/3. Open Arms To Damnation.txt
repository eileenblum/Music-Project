Day by day, Let's pave the path to escape.
Pave the way, tragic endings passed away.
Bring forth sincerity, bring forth the change.
This portrait of dishonesty will be slain.
I will not hold back. I will not regret.
I won't hold back. I won't regret.
This place I now call home is nothing more than a fallacy.
Nothing more than a fallacy.
This is not my home. You got a one way ticket to hell with open arms to damnation.
You've got a one way ticket to hell with open arms to damnation.
