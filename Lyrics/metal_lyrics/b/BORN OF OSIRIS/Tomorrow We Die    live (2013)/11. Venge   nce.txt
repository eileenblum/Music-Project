We were built with the human condition
To expose the pain you create
(No remorse) No remorse for the weak and the hopeless
This the process of your extraction
Time to start a vengeance
Monsters instilled in us all
On the brink of eruption
The end result of life

Introducing a parallel existence
I want abstraction

We have been given the gift to proceed
So come on
We try to fill in the blanks you're missing
You need to open the door to begin
So come on
Will you be listening in?

The storm has settled
It washed away your fear
We listened
They took us captive
We held on
With our thoughts imprisoned

The blood line has ended
Now your cause sees its effect
Reaction, a little too late for a reaction
Little too late for a reaction
Enough is enough
