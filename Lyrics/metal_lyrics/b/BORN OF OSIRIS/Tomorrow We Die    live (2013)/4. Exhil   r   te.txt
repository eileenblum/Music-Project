I need to take a step back
And I need to take a step back
I need to face the facts
That I'm intoxicated, but now
I need to take a step back
Save your sanity
You will be facing honesty
And I said I'd never leave
I need to take a step back

In this chase
My optimistic agenda's unchanged
What's at stake?
A separation that leaves me unscathed
In this phase
I am standing and you're drifting away
Now you're facing
A chance to prevail among the wrathful

Your silence has awakened my abilities
It's taking over
Take this message as a gift from me
You need to listen to your heart
Can you tell what it says?
We got the plan here
Deconstruct, construct a new life
And never push aside your instincts, stay alive
And never push aside your instincts, stay alive

I need to take a step back
And I need to take a step back
I need to face the facts
That I'm intoxicated, but now
I need to take a step back
Save your sanity
You will be facing honesty
And I said I'd never leave
I need to take a step back

I need to take a step back
This is endless power
Coursing through our veins
Triumphant in this hour
You will never look at us the same
This is endless power
Coursing through our veins
Triumphant in this hour
You will never look at us the same
