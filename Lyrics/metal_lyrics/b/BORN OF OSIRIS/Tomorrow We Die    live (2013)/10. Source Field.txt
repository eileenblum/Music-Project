Do my senses deceive me?
Obstructing the wavelengths
Forward motion is rising
To find what is sacred
To find what is sacred

Have I entered a new life
An extension of my own perception
Can I retreat from this panic, from this tension
Or welcome the great unknown

Awaken, awaken into greatness
Not afraid to be in this space
Awaken, awaken into greatness
Manifest creation

We're home from the other side
And now we know (now we know)
The mystery was found, enlightenment
We were chosen to show (to show) you (you)
You were destined to become, to become unnumbered

They will try to persuade you
And slowly destroy one's integrity
They might as well take you to the killing fields
And throw you away
You look back (to look back), you risk it all (risk it all)
Don't stray from enlightenment
Stray from the darkness
Come into the light
Come into the light again

Now your senses receiving
Constructing the wavelengths
The signals are seeking
We know what is sacred
We know what is sacred

We know this is constant
Aware of the source field

Alive in this form we venture together
In the great unknown
Stronger than ever, arrive at the center
Of the great unknown

Awaken, awaken into greatness
Not afraid to be in this space
Awaken, awaken into greatness
Manifest creation
