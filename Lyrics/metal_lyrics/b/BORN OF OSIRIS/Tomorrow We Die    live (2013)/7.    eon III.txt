Rise
Lift from your informal lives
The sun will come to us to provide
As we form from the ashes
Burn (burn), reborn (reborn)
This century will thrive

The divine mother of earth
Showed us the way, gave us birth
Provided us with reason
Gave pure life clarity
But the truth of conception
Lied in able man
So the age of the pleasant
Fell from the mother's hand
A new generation born
Resurrected as the sun
A new aeon has begun

Surrender to the gods
As you flow
Through the river of the sky
Come forth and display
The proof of your innocence
To the judge of souls
Will you pass to the judge of souls?
Will you pass to the judge of souls?

The secret of death is revealed
Complete emergence
Into affirmation of the born less one (the born less one)

A new aeon has begun (it has begun)
A new aeon has begun (it has begun)

The insight of man's word (of man's word):
Destroy the light, shade the earth
But our sun, resurrected
Gives new life on this world

Rise
Lift from your informal lives
The sun will come to us to provide
As we form from the ashes
Burn (burn), reborn (reborn)
This century will thrive
This century will thrive
