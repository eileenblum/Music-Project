We conquered fate
Never abandoning our face
We will be found
Refusing the voice of doubt

We conquered fate
Never abandoning our face (intricate)
We will be found
Refusing the voice of doubt

Endless games you play
Why do you try to escape?
When will it become worth it
To convince yourself that you're satisfied
When the obstacles have been so neatly placed
In your design sensors miscommunicate
The failure lies in distrust of your natural instincts

I've seen the shattering of my composition
What an unfortunate visualization

We must undo the damage imprinted in
Our experience has kept us all detained
Now our design fuses missed and severed links
It will take time to reconstruct our primitive instincts

The essence of observation
Has shown us how to live
This passage in circulation
Gives birth to clarity

We are not alone (we are not alone)
In this game of exchange
In this game of retaliation
We are not alone
Endless games you play
Why do you try to escape?
When will it become worth it
To face the wrath in action
Erase establishment
To see they are worthless

We conquered fate
Never abandoning our face (intricate)
We will be found
Refusing the voice of doubt
We conquered fate
Never abandoning our face (intricate)
We will be found
Refusing the voice of doubt
