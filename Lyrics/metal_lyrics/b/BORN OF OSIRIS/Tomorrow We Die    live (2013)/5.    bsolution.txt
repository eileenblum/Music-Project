New beginnings erase the weathered plain
Our direction shapes this diverse industrial age
Will we never forget?
Will we choose to remain in the age of traditional ritual?

Gravity has brought us towards the universal living
Looking up and seeing the universal core
Overwhelming passion in all of us
Keeps on turning, forever flowing
Till the sun dies out

If your light subsides you
We will observe the fade
Face to face with the forsaken
Face to face with your mistakes

You know you can't see, can't see
Can't see what you (what you) believe (believe, believe)

Gravity has brought us towards the universal living
Looking up and seeing the universal core
Overwhelming passion in all of us
Keeps on turning, forever flowing
Till the sun dies out

Rejuvenate transformation
All of these pieces contained in the inner body
Unify and formulate to design new clarity
Look into their eyes feasting on absolution
As they capitalize the condemnation

If your light subsides you
We will observe the fade
Face to face with the forsaken
Face to face with your mistakes

New beginnings erase the weathered plain
Our direction shapes this diverse industrial age
Will we never forget?
Will we choose to remain in the age of traditional ritual?

You know you can't see what you believe
Rejuvenate transformation
You know you can't see what you believe
Rejuvenate transformation
