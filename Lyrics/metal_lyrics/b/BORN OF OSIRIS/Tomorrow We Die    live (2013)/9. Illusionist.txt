Should I believe in your prophecies?
Does it lead me towards false ideals?

Where is the evidence, can you show me some proof?
This is irrelevant to the people you elude
Separate from all your wishful thinking
I want to prove what my heart is seeking

It's hard to focus with this distance
How can I mend this war between us?
I've given all my trust in what you believe
Will you be reaching back to me?

Stay in this picture, no further decay
The risk will come at a price I'm willing to pay
We were fearless with passion for life
Now are we forced to say goodbye? (say goodbye)

Programmed over time (adapted)
Was I meant to take this path?
Confined, out of touch (absent mind)
Set me free to feel alive

I placed my trust in you

I noticed the threat in our exchange
The days goes on with no security

It's hard to focus with this distance
How can I mend this war between us?
I've given all my trust in what you believe
Will you be reaching back to me?

Stay in this picture, no further decay
The risk will come at a price I'm willing to pay
We were fearless with passion for life
Now are we forced to say goodbye? (say goodbye)
