Take another look at yourself
Tell me
What do you see? (what do you see)
Your soul's reflection
Is it (is it) what it used to be?
So take another look at yourself
Tell me, what do you see?

Answers revolve around our heads like figures of our imagination
Measures are taken to purge pleasure and take life in as pain

This is bigger than you and me
'Cause this is bigger than you and me
Alarms as you wake from this dream
Human fellowship is sacred
'Cause this is bigger than you and me

Take another look at yourself
Tell me, what do you see? (what do you see)
Your soul's reflection
Is it (is it) what it used to be?
So take another look at yourself
And tell me, what do you see?

As we move along, waiting here
Our days repeat and increase
Your default setting
Runs your life secretly

Which direction are you heading?
Escape this pressure
This is bigger than you and me

(Alarms) Alarms as you wake from this dream
Human fellowship is sacred
'Cause this is bigger than you and me
(Alarms) Alarms as you wake from this dream
Human fellowship is sacred
'Cause this is bigger than you and me

Separate yourself from the machine
Embrace your own identity
Separate yourself from the machine
Embrace your own identity
Escape the pressure

Take another look at yourself
Tell me
What do you see? (what do you see)
Your soul's reflection
Is it (is it) what it used to be?
So take another look at yourself
Tell me, what do you see?
Your soul's reflection
Is it what it used to be?
Your soul's reflection
Is it what it used to be?
What do you see?
