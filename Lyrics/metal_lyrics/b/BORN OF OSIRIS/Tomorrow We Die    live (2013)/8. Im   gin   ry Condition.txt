We endeavor to seek peace
In this state of control
Forced in formation
Uprise in the dead design

The newborn are faced with unreason
Shadowed by their imaginary conditions
What has been built
Brick by brick, with deception
What has been built
Brick by brick, with deception
Is bound to disrupt
Their false foundation

Reveal the answers
Placed inside our minds
React and question
Unveil the truth

We must react and construct
Restore the hope in us
We must react and construct
Restore the hope in us

We endeavor to seek peace
In this state of control
Forced in formation
Uprise in the dead design

Witness the shift as it comes closer
Our faction will become the defender
Here's your independence
Show them you're not defenseless

I set forth to find a connection
To bring peace to our foundation
I set forth to find a connection
In all of us
I set forth to find a connection
To bring peace to our foundation
I set forth to find a connection
