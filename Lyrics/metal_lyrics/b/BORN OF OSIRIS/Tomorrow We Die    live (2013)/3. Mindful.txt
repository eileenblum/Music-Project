Don't manipulate our own kind (our own kind)

You've engaged (engaged)
These gears in motion
Static waves
They disrupt the current
Set in place
Leaving the combines in disarray
Disrupt the harvest of the meek

I have made my decision irreversible
I have made my decision irreversible
The chaos is rapidly growing
Unnatural frames pouring out of control
Defying our unification

The machine will break you
It was made to make you a slave
Bound in chains

In this weightless state
We form to become more mindful
Connected to each other as one
The cycle completes
Our arms are lifted up
Now we understand to become more mindful
Connected to each other as one
The cycle completes

You've engaged these gears in motion
Disrupt the current they set in place
You've engaged these gears in motion
Set in place, disrupt the current
Set in place
Leaving the combines in disarray
Disrupt the harvest of the meek

Power in numbers
Power in numbers
You will salvage nothing from me (power in numbers)
Once the feast has begun (power in numbers)
The syndicate will dine at our feet (power in numbers)
No use of money or power or greed

I have made my decision irreversible
I have made my decision irreversible
The chaos is rapidly growing
Unnatural frames pouring out of control
Defying our unification
