My risen seeds will now begin
Spread out above, now time to live
With fellow man I kneel
I seek a better sun
Unconsciously I feel
The solution of the world
We are still stuck inside the wires
Secrets in our eyes
Will call out for a new
Tomorrow before we ever knew
That it was in doubt
Let us foresee the future drought.
