They will become the enemy
Suffering for eternity
No one can surrender
No choice but to bleed
The believers kill their own kind
Unless the followers take strike
To uphold our spirits inside
We must inform unstable life
You lost the connection
A blank interaction
Trapped in fear that all will be taken
Forget the past
As you take it in your hands
They will become the enemy
Suffering for eternity
Onto the horizon
Feel the future arriving
System failure
You know you can't stay this way
You know you wont be the same
The more you look outside this world
The more you can see happening.
