This is your Last Straw
We all have been waiting for you to come
Maybe one day everyone will see
That it's all a stage
I don't need anyone to tell me lies
This is your Last Straw
Don't hold back
Keep on moving towards the front
Time is always against us
Your message will not save us now
Too many illusions your eyes
Are blinded from this truth
They will see soon
Everything will be alright
None will be forgotten
Its almost time to nothing to be ashamed of
We will unfold this lie
This is your Last Straw
We understand and we know why
An action should be made
Does it make it easier
To think of your position
In the scheme of things
Opening your heart is the key
All the judgments will disappear
You've been facing this too long
A new path is seen
We understand and we know why
An action should be made
Communicate to the suffering
Translate their pain
Feel it so you can relate
Everything will be alright
None will be forgotten
Its almost time nothing to be ashamed
Of we will unfold this lie
Opening your heart is the key
All the judgments will disappear
Searching for a sacred relief
The solution is here
Farewell to the prophecy of misery
Farewell to the kings of deception.
