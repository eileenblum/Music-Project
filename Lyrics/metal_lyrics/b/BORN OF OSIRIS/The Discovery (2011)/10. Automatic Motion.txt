Came across an altercation
Of a destination to where we're heading
Speak the words of a certain secret
A failed attempt to hide what is out there
Tell me do you trust me to lead you
Tell me if your feeling alive
A quest to accomplish
The greatness we shelter
A unique elevation
The essence of wisdom surrounds me
This is instinct Automatic Motion
Incandescent signal
Insight will allure you
You must confront your inabilities
You must adjust to your capabilities
Tell me do you trust me to lead you
I can help you
Tell me if your feeling alive
I can help you
Stolen hopes and dreams broken desires we all face
Protect the innocence within
Guard your intuition.
