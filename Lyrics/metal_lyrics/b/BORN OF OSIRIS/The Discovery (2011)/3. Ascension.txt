Raise your head up its just one more step
Are you giving up now so close to knowing
The only hope that's left has been taken from view
A new journey awaits you
Time to begin
No one will ever break us
Join the experience
When you become ready
Encounter certainty
You will have to witness
All of this on your own
You will find the reasons
Not left to wonder why
Every moment matters
New discovered space
A shift of time is on its way
Together we will have to change
Another hope is known to me
Were gonna have to find our own beliefs
Looking up to a new idea
Were we all can focus
A mystery that's deceived
A subtle thought has been noticed
Of our ascension
The transition has come
Enlightened and courageous
You know what you can become
Our journey has just begun.
