I'm ready to go faster
Have you taken your seat
It's time we change things up
And let our impulse be the primary attraction
I'm looking at a disaster
A world that relies on deceit
The precious conveniences
Will leave us to only lose out faster
I've seen the blame at my feet
Allowed the evil to take me
Terminate the beliefs
That this is a masterpiece we're shaping
Embrace the slave ship
We are the undertakers
Taking Numbers
There is no direction from one another
Life is like a lesson can you interpret the truth
Why put your faith in question
If you cant see whats within you
Take a second to enjoy this
Before it passes right before you
I clearly see why
There's no answer for me
Cause I'm falling asleep
At the wheel of discovery
Chasing a dream that out runs every being
You look soon enough
But you'll never start seeing
The meaning of mischief the reason we kill
The itch that's inside us to indulge in the thrill
The sound of freedom will ring through the air
When we decide to take charge
When we decide to care.
