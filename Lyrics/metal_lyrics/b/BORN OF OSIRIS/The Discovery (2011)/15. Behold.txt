I can't stand
The bitter denial
Neglected consciousness
Forgotten rights
The book has been written
You cant change the ending
What is your confusion
Know your own condition
Lay down and think about how you've lived out
Your wasted time here is over and gone
They left us and we can start now our evolution
Expired,
Empty,
Expired,
Extinction
The refugees have deserted the city
No longer producing the age old concerns
Of how we can conquer and watch them crumble
It's far too late to question
They knew this would happen the book has been written
Set in stone now they've seen it now they know
Is this a miracle or imagination
your invention or destruction
We are here alone
At last we are finding answers
Reveal the meaning of what we really are.
