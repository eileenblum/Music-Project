We need to agree.
I have witnessed.
An abomination filling up the room.

Like I should have cared.
You know you've been here way too long.

Restore what has been done before the end.
Factor in the possibility of my life.
Give me the reasons to question the freedoms of life.
So I can survive.

Don't you ever go out of turn?
Do you ever listen to the answers?
Don't you ever see what's going on?
Restore what has been done before the end.
It will come down in time.

It's all on your side.
Show me what gives you strength.
We trusted you now how do we proceed?

Reaching out and receiving tranquility.
Are you feeling serene?

Though we thought it was all okay.
We don't warrant this covenant.
The agreement was thin and weak.

We need support you can't sustain.
You convinced me of everything.
But the words don't reflect my sentiment.

You could never hold on.
You could never face it.
