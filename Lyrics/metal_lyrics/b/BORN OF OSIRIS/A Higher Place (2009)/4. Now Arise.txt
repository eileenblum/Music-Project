Time is coming to an end
Prepare for the worst to come
You arise but your life has run dry
Show me the answers I've been looking for
Where did they come from?
I never wanted it to be like this
Lose what you have in mind
You all will be taken away

Nothing seems real anymore
I am no stranger of hatred and lies
We're lost and there's nothing left
Fear is the only thing that keeps us alive
Lose what you have in mind
What keeps us alive
You all will be taken away

Burn this place
So we can celebrate
A start of a brand new day
New beginnings time for change
New beginnings time for change

Don't always hide the fury and sit in silence
The less I hear the more I'm scared
Feel the victory and jump into a sea of serenity
Let the water clean your dreams
Afraid to let go of everything

Trying to keep unity and make a statement
But you bleed your head is spilling
All the judgments
All the wars
All the rivalry we face
Is leaking on the floor

When will it be okay to come outside
When the storm is dying and the rain is done
The composure of my soul is harmonized
By the sounds that travel into me

Show me the answers I've been looking for
Where did they come from?
Nothing seems real anymore
I am no stranger to all of this bullshit
Time is coming to an end
Prepare for the worst try to keep unity
Make a statement but you bleed your head is spilling
All the wars
All the Rivalries
The composure of my soul is harmonized
By the sounds that travel into me
