I heard you say something quite uninviting
Are you aware the state were in
Hoping to cover the tracks behind us
Try to let the tension in your hands release
And exist in freedom
What doesn't tear you apart gives you peace
Exist yourself in freedom

What's wrong here?
I was giving it up

Renounce your command
The subject constructed your hate
Now I shield myself from pain
Showing my own expression
In the midst of this disorientation
I'm in the midst of a sinking wreck
A choice to be affected or
Permit extinction

Putting the power at your feet
In your authority
I won't lay my will down
Renounce your command

Try to let the tension in your hands release
And exist in freedom
What doesn't tear you apart gives you peace
Exist yourself in freedom
