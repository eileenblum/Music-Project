Are you surprised that we ended up this way?
How could I not see this coming?

Let us show you how we operate.
Give us the meaning of devotion.
You lead us to the edge of corruption.
And threw us in a pit of despair.
Now we know you facing endless obstructions.
The results of our concerns are near.
Take notice of a changing dawn.

My blood flows faster and faster.
Feeling the pierce of destruction.

I remember when the deal was almost new.
We felt invincible and ready to.
Play out of the situations.
Now it's become too much for me to care.
About who's up on the chain.
Who's ahead of us today?
See what's its worth to reach a solution.

Forward or reverse?
I don't know in this abyss.
Gaining speed or just stopping faster?
I can't master these thoughts.

Show me the meaning of devotion.
You lead us to the edge of corruption.
And threw us in a pit of despair.
Show me the meaning of devotion.
You lead us to the edge of corruption.
So receive the present.
And be put to rest.

Be put to rest.
My dreams were just fiction.
A loss of intention.
The purposes you hold dear are not much to me.
There dragging me down.
Be put to rest.
Stop pushing the limits.
And be put to rest.
