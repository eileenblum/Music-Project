There has to be something worth fighting for
Is there anything to convince me?
I'm trapped in society
Looking to find the fucking exit
At the mercy of mankind

Bring me knowledge
Give me strength

The decision has already been conformed
Now we separate the relations
Masked from the world
I'm ready for this
Let's take control

Now incite together in a connected environment
Draining the shit we deal with everyday
If it's support you're after
Then try to see me in a different way
Let your eyes see truth - try to see me in a different way
Let your eyes see truth - now conquer the raising threat
Of existing in the tension and strain we're in
I declare when the dangers upon us
I will destroy every aspect of it
