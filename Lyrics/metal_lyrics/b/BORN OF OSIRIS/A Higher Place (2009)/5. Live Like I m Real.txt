Echoes of your voice filling up the hallways
I still walk here and you still don't disappear
Disappear (no hesitation)
I will move on (it's been over done)
Enough of everything
It's been too long
Erase the facts - erase the fucking past
This is the back of the front door
And I control you
And I still walk here
And as a matter of timing crumbles
And leaves us alone again with the wreckage
It still smolders here
Erase the facts - erase the fucking past
Enough of everything
It's been too long no looking back
I'll be alive - live like I'm real
Disappear now
I will move on
I'm hoping it's tonight when I can turn out these lights
And be alive
