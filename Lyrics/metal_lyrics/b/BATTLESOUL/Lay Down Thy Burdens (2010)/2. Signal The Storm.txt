Brothers of the north
Fallen like the snow
Pushing towards the line
Maintain form

Banners on the hills
Signal the storm
Battered with there blood
They are gaining ground

Speak to me with conviction
The eagle departs from my vision

Out of control
It started will the call
The shattering of shields
Strengthens my resolve
The beautiful canvas
The water of life
My brothers are dying
And my guilt is growing

Speak to me with conviction
The eagle departs from my vision
The strength of the one
Is all that remains
The weakness of the many
Is one and the same
