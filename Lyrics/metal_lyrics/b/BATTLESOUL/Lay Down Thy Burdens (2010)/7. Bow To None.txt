As our army grows,
We're bolstered by fear,
Of common foe

Leave not to chance,
We must be swift,
For my time is short

Bow to none,
For the future of gaul's sons,
Through the chorus of terror,
Bow to none

No stone and no marker,
No name to remember,
But why think of this when
Battles are near

Saviors,
Spirits of old,
Open the sky
