Sworn to defend and protect the realm,
Dreams have shown me a different path,
We command our destiny,
The time to rule has com to pass

Wash the field in the fire of gods,
The well of wounds pours endlessly,
Courage bestowed on us this day,
Given to man by the world tree

It's taken too long to turn back now,
We found them ready on the battleground,
Over the walls, hold your vows,
Shown them your steel cut'em down

Waves are ready to take us home,
For oaths we break we must atone,
We must shown the gods what we learned,
Cleansing fire must be left to burn

I clad the earth in cloak of blood,
I paid no heed that my warlike deeds,
Might one day be repaid
I am the oathbreaker, and i am king

What do you see now father?
I have reworked the stars
And written a new fate
I am the oathbreaker, and i am king
I beseech the gods, i dare not say,
That i never was afraid

The tomes of time will echo with the rhymes,
Of eternal conquest
Forget the fallen for this day, for always
The oathbreaker reigns
