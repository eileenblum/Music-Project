Vengeance panic, dept owed depts paid,
Stars fall, bone break wood shield splinter,
Star gaze tempest, hearts break, with time,
Vengeance panic, dept owed depts paid,

Flames of the council reaching out towards us,
Light danced along as methods were discussed,
Like lovers pouring over secrets long with held,
We make know our intention

I descend from a long line of kings,
I am the iron used to forged great lands

Trees sing us songs recourcing old tales,
We must recall to help our journey on,
The breaking of spears, shields and hearts,
Time itself is our greatest enemy

Liar are beholder to this display,
A showing of true courage
As the seekers take the test,
Moving out into the nigh tout of sight,
Blooding farewell they've seen they're sunrise,

Light have flickering with my eyes,
At the thought of going home,
A long forlorn return,
That's drifting away with the rain

Don't wait for a dawn that will never come,
I will stay, swords withdrawn,
Embracing the night forsaken the dawn,
Doing what is right

Please run,
Run my friends, my countrymen
