Your silence sings louder then
Your sword ever could

The wolf stand atop the slaughtered lamb,
Without meaning to eat of it's flesh

Your silence sings louder then
Your sword

Burn away that which was yesterdays,
I never thought i'd see the like,
I am the wolf who calls upon his pack,
Vercingetorix is my name

Burn away the day,
Sound we knew are gone,
Into the tales of old,
Bow down to my name

Burn away that which was yesterdays,
I never thought i'd see the like,
I am the wolf who calls upon his pack,
Vercingetorix is my name
