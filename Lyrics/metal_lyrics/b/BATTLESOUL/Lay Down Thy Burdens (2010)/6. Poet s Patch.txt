Don't cast your faith with the stones,
Remembering the phantoms of old,
They have departed,
I am all you have

So to do i depend on you,
My swords alone will end no wars,
Save to submit it in defeat,
A fate worse then death

We have come so far,
Sequence repeat once again,
Scars bathed the land in light,
We have come so far

The stars depart, across the sea,
Returning to me the memorial grows,
For those of fallen flame,
I swore I'd never release this land
