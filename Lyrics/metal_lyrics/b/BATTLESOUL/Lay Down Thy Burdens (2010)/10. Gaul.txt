Signs have come with the darkening clouds,
We have waited far too long,
I thought I knew the world at last,
But still I long for days now passed

We're run too fucking long,
Mist cleared from my eyes,
Lies spewed from their mouths,
Truths forgot too many times

We were once the joyous sons,
We knew what we become,
That fateful day the romans,
Invaded our home

Mourning for the man I used to be,
Keeps from growing into a seer,
Betrayed those thought of a life not lived,
