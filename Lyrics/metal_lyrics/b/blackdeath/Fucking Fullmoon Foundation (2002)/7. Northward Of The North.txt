The glitter of snow outshines the sun
Immense whiteness dazzles my eyes
I'm staring before me and see blackness only
The indifferent sky turns away from me

Crystallized air imbibes any sound
Inscrutable silence tears my eardrums
I'm crying but can't hear myself
The still-born echo laughs at me

The feet sink in the deep snow
Every step takes away my strength
All-absorbing drifts suck me so lazily
Deep like an abyss they won't notice me

Fatigue and cold lull me to sleep
Sweet dreams and promising hallucinations
The slumber carries away me on and on
Instinct of self-preservation forgot about me

My last memory was that I came here in sleep
And now I'm falling asleep in this unreal sleep
Cold, cold and cold again in the great beyond
And the way from this land leads only to death

I could see this dreadful world
Only because I came here by day
The day that's lasting a billion years
The day that's overfilled with the cold

At night this world ceases to be a world
The night without stars and polar lights
The night that's lasting a billion years
The night that's overfilled with the cold

Every life is dying here
Every pride is disgracing here

Every power is weakening here
More than north
Every triumph is falling here
Northward of the north
Every glory is declining here
More than north
Every majesty is fading here
Northward of the north
Every life is dying here
More than north
Every pride is disgracing here
Northward of the north

Northward of the north
