Yes, the Python knows your future,
Because the Daimon opened his mind.
Ask the possessed about your fears.
Time has no secrets from him.

Styx and Acheron gave their waters
Stone Idol told his recollections.
Ask the Pythron about your hopes.
He knows all your numbers.

Python!

No, the Python knows your future.
Make no doubt about it.
One keeps the silence 'cos He can't tell.
About things which never existed.

Shut up! We have no time...
