I went on blazing field
Metal flowers clanked their petals
death angel gave me his scythe
black flowers like hellish souls

Look on my vivified left hand
It's damnation for all living ones

I go into the hellish smithy
the battle flowers are needful stuff
for the casting of the fighting sword
the sword for bloody work
