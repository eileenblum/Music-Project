In the land of dreams I found
Lilith, so lustful one.

Her vagina is my aim,
Her cunt is on head

I tear vulva, I penetrate.
Into a core of Lilith

I am seized with fear
And delight of Death

The King and the Queen hold.
The table of the law

They give Me the Law
I fly...

The devil's eye watches me from dark
My own dream is myself
I don't exist on any level
or maybe world vanished around

My new birth through the long row
Of incarnations is tormenting exit
Now I am
Messiah
My number is
Six Six Six
Amen
