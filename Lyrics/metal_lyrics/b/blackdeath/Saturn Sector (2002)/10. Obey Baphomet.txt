The empire of baphomet
the cold call of Baphomet

Cry of flesh and spirit
Eternal pleasure and pain
Land of endless fire and ice
timeless baphomet's dominion

Deep in the ocean and
over the heavens and stars
I feel his breath and his odour
And answer the call

The empire of Baphomet
the cold call of Baphomet

Obey Baphomet
Obey Baphomet
