On the cold planet
I'm walking through ice
Any creature is banned
Condemned to sacrifice

Kingdom of no fire
Nobody dares bless
Land of frozen desire
Temple of the icy mess

The endless coldest season
Crawls through terrible storms
The ideas of frozen reason
Get the incredible forms

Waiting with nonchalant dignity
When conquers all the infinity

Something throws into disorder
Expanses with the lifeless mark
Remembering the ritual murder
Committed in the earthly dark

Waiting with nonchalant dignity
When conquers all the infinity

Shining of the unholy Crown
Discloses the tremendous sight
With trepidation going down
I'm about to get the Might
