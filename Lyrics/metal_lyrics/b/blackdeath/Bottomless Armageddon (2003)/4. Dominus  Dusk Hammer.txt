Worship! 
Titanic hammer is raised above you 

Dusk light heralds 
Darkness of black metal mass 
In the abyss of universe, 
Where stars are never born, 
This hammer was forged by those 
Who had risen above the gods 
It is destined for master, 
For dark overman 

Oh! Destruction! 
Domination is over each and all 
Bend the knee and think away 
Your follies and pride 
Becauseâ¦ 
Because this power is higher 
Than your fucking understanding 

Titanic hammer is raised above you 

Nobody will overlive 
World on world falls in nothing 
This is beauty 
It's worth seeingâ¦ 

On and on I look into the abyss 
And the abyss looks into me 
My emperor 
Lowers his hammer 

Oh! Devastation! Supervision is over each and all 
The noise from heaven bursts my eardrums 
My frightened mind is beating in the cranium 
I can't lower my head - I'm paralyzed by this greatness 

I waitâ¦
