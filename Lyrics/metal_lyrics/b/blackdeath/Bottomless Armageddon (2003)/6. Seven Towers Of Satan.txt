Seven gates of godless hell 
Seven abodes of fallen angels 
Seven dens of wizards and werewolves 

By power and fire you fettered the world 
All earth is your foundation 
The face of moon is seen from your tops 
You are so old, you are so great 

O seven towers of Satan! 

Dead warriors for whom the war will never end 
Hungry demons for whom the fire is eternal 
Violent winds for whom there is no rest 
They wait for your command to blast the peace 

O seven towers of Satan! 

Bristled fortress of unleashed hate 
Brilliant sickle aimed at the civilization 
Dark arch from Niger to Ural 
Poles of evil which remember the future 

"Nor is it to be thought, that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. Seven towers were, Seven towers are, and Seven towers shall be!" 

Power doesn't stop growing 
End is approaching 
Light is sucked in 
By seven towers of Satan
