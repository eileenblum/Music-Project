Cry of flesh and spirit 
Eternal pleasure and pain 
Land of endless fire and ice 
Timeless Baphomet's dominion 

Horror for eyes and mind 
Power of past and future ages 
Steel rivers and icy mountains 
Everlasting Baphomet's might 

Timeless Baphomet's dominion 

Vital triumph of death 
Logical sowing of madness 
Vortex of absurd emptiness 
The sun is under the throne of Baphomet 

Lord of the empire of no map 
Sovereign of troops of invisible servants 
King of the realm of thousands ways 
Master of wishes and passions and goals 

Sovereign 
Master 

Deep in the ocean and over the heavens and stars 
I feel his breath and his look and answer the call 
I change my soul and heart on the wings of black steel 
I'm imperial subject - I'm cold wind - 
Now I'm free 

The empire of Baphomet 
The cold call of Bathomet 

Lord of the empire of no map 
Sovereign of troops of invisible servants 
King of the realm of thousands ways 
Master of wishes and passions and goals 

Baphomet
