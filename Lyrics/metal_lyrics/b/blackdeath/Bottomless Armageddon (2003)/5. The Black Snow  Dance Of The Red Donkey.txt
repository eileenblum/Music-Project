The black snow 
Dancing on poisoned air 

White snow is one from a heaven 
Black snow is one from a hell 
White snow is frozen water 
Black snow is volcanic ash 
Cold snow is falling upon the earth 
Hot snow is falling upon it 
Black breathless steam is birthed by them 
It's rising to heaven with poison of hate 

Volcano which is everywhere 
Destroy all flesh with dirty earth 
Volcano which is apocalypse 
Kill the good shepherd again 
Death from the black underground 
Come here with darkness and chaos 
With the streams of the blasting lava 
With the fall of black snow 

Heavens cannot put out this diabolic fire 
How much whiteness they would dispatch 
Apocalyptic volcano woke up from waiting 
Nothing can stop the anger of hell 

I see the black snow dancing on poisoned air 
And I know soon I'll see the triumphal dance of evil 

Dance of evil
