Crush the city of Jerusalem! 

I hear the virgin's squeals from below 
Just men's moan echoes through the icy vacuum 
In darkness I see the cracking pearl 
And flows of melted gold around 

The twelve gates were blown up by fire 
By fire from hell, by fire of death 
No one will enter the city and leave it 
Diabolic fire roasted the holy spirit 

Last sacrifice 
Is the final mighty battle 
Nobody can find the enemy for hell 
Piety is a direct way into the slavery 
The end of time is the beginning of the new aeon 

Wings of Satan covered the abyss of cosmic chaos 
There is no second death for the Beast and hell 
In burning universe 
Seven angels are condemned to eternal death 
By the court of the dead 
Three demonic spirits and kings of the earth 
Extol the victory 

Menstruating tree of life is turned into ash 
Its leaves will never heal the peoples 
Ridiculous cubic city is only past now 
And its name will be forgotten 

Crush the city of Jerusalem! 

"â¦Und ich sah die Ruinen der heiligen Stadt, die Ruinen des neuen Jerusalemâ¦ â¦Und einen Tempel sah ich nicht in ihr; denn der Herr, der ohnmÃ¤chtige Gott, war ihr Tempel, und das Lamm. Aber sie waren tot. Und die Stadt bedarf nicht der Sonne noch des Mondes, daÃ sie ihr scheinen; denn alle waren tot." 

("â¦I saw the ruins of the holy city, the ruins of New Jerusalemâ¦ I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Impotent, and the Lamb, were its temple. But they were dead. The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for all were dead.") 

Crush the city of Jerusalem!
