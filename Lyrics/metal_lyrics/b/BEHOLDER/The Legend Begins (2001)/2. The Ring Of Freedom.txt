I'm gonna reach the island, I'm gonna break the spell 
I am the only real hope for my land 
To find the ring of freedom, I will be facing hell 
I feel inside me the power of faith 
Tonight the bright stars show me the way 
To find the Oracle I have to be at the island withtin the night 

[CHORUS 1:]
'Cause I'm riding to find now the holy ring, ancient simbol of victory 
To the doors of the Oracle I will go, to fight the shadow of my soul 

A legend told the story of this divine ring 
The power of immortality 
To gain this magic symbol, I'll reach the oracle 
to face the mirrors of my darkest past 
I'm ready to pass beyond the holy doors 
I close my eyes and I set my mind free, now I'm deciding my fate 

[CHORUS 2:]
'Cause tonight I will be the only warrior who returned from the Oracle 
with this ring at my finger I will survive, I'll have the power of my Gods 

[SOLO - Markus Mayer]

The Oracle: "Brave warrior, enter the Oracle now... 
You'll write the fate of your sacred land 
The ancient army of Ghoran is awaiting your arrival 
then you will reach the divine gates of Lorengaard 
Now cross the mirrors to gain the holy ring 
Then take your faithful horse and ride!" 

[SOLO - Matt Treasure]

From holy fields of Eilen, I'll lead my people to 
the sacred walls of Lorengaard 
My king has called my name, I'll be the only one 
to keep the ring of freedom 
Oracle, show me the fate of my land 
Then I will pass the divine gates to reach the shining light of the ring 

[CHORUS 1, CHORUS 2]
I'll ride to the victory!
