In a time of blood and pain there was a noble kingdom 
when everyone honoured the faith 
With their mighty sacred steel the armies on the field 
ready to sacrifice their lives 

They had no fear of the mighty northern enemies 
Riding beyond lakes and forest, singin' hymns of war 

[CHORUS:]
Fight immortal army 
Follow the way of your lord you are killing to survive 
Till the end, defend the crown of your land 

You are the chosen ones, the ones who'll fight for glory 
as long as God will give you strenght 
And when the sun comes down, the moon will see you standing proud 
your swords are brighter than the stars 

[BRIDGE:]
Take your shield and seize your sword to fight before the walls 
Run through blades and kill who wants to make your people fall 

[CHORUS]

[SOLOS - Markus Mayer, Matt Treasure, Pete Ryan (2 times)]

[BRIDGE - CHORUS]
