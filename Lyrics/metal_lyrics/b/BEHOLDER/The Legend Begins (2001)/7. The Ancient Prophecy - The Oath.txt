Glory is near, I will ride the sky, my dreams will come reality 
My mission is my only aim, I will consecrate my name 
My land won't be sacrificed, a holy kingdom's in my mind 
My sword is ready to destroy the black emperor to save 
All the brothers of the reign, they will forget the pain 

[CHORUS:]
And when the light will return we will be free, forever! 
Our dreams will come true and we will ride, toghether! Eternally! 

Lord, you're my witness everyday, I'm the one who can deny 
The return of evil reign, they will burn under my flame 
My sword is ready to destroy the black emperor to save 
All the brothers of the reign, they will forget the pain 

[CHORUS - SOLO: Pete Ryan - CHORUS]
