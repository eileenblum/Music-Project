Running in the fire, I'm looking for my way 
I will find a million walls, hiding my secret dreams 
'Cause I want to change my life, I will break the chains of fate 
Look at my eyes, I will shed my last tears 
I'm denying my past, for a new state of grace 
'Cause I will defend myself, take my hands and follow me 

[CHORUS:]
Time to follow my faith and walk alone on my way, steppin' into the light 
Time to follow my faith and walk alone on my way, riding to the sky 

[SOLO - Markus Mayer]

Facing the mirror, I'll see my bloody sins 
They will enter my mind, they will become my voice 
'Cause I've got to ask my soul what's the meaning of my pain 
I've been a slave, during my short life 
But I will cry no more, leaving my tears behind 
I am leaving my dark side and I'll run to find myself 

[CHORUS]

[SOLO - Matt Treasure]
