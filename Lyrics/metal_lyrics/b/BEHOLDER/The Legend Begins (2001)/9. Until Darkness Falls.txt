You'll be leaving tonight, my love, you will leave me here alone 
Don't you see the tears falling from my eyes again, I won't let you go 
You're my life and my fate, and I don't wanna see you cry 
Oh my love, kiss me once again, then let me go and keep on prayin' for me 

[CHORUS:]
Close your eyes and let your heart fly 
Every single moment I will pray for you 
Feel my soul and touch me once more 
Feel the sorrow of my heart, all night long 
I will stand here by your side until darkness falls... 

Now I'm so far from your eyes, trying to forget you're crying for me 
But my heart can't deny my sorrow, I'm so sad, I will cry tonight 

[CHORUS]
[SOLO - Markus Mayer]
[SOLO - Matt Treasure]

I'll be fighting for you, wait until you come back home 
I won't sacrifice my life, no! 

Close your eyes and let your heart fly (I won't lose myself) 
Every single moment I will pray for you 
Feel my soul and touch me once more (and more and more...) 
Feel the sorrow of my heart all night long 

Close your eyes and let your heart fly (Keep on prayin' for me) 
Every single moment I will pray for you 
Feel my soul and touch me once more 
(feel my soul and don't leave me alone) 
Feel the sorrow of my heart all night long
