My hands are chained and I'm screaming, I can't escape from here 
This is the Ivory Tower, right in the middle of enemies reign 
Who can hear my voice? Who will save my soul? 
I hear the silence of death, I have no chance to be free 
I raise my eyes to the sky! Lord, take me out of this hell! 

[CHORUS:]
I will return to fight, I'll march alone to be 
The saver of my land, the power's in my hands 

[SOLO - Matt Treasure]
[SOLO - Aldo Lonobile]

From Eilen my friends are coming to set me free from these chains 
I hear the sound of their voices, soon they will be here to save me 
Holy knights, prepare to go! We're the ones who keep the Ring 
Now I am finally free, my sword is ready to kill 
Once my Master told me: "Face the evil ones with your steel!" 

[CHORUS]
