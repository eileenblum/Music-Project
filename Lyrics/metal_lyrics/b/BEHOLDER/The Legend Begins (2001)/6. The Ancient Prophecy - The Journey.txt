Running to the emperor's town, we found an old source 
There was a stone with not many words, we read and it said: 
"Riding through the holy valleys you will arrive in a grey swamp where everyone dies, so you have 
to think about your past, 
if your heart is not pure you won't go on:" (won't go on:) 
That was the prophecy of the old bard, he lived in all the ages, 
He knew the warriors who didn't return, his heart was pure 
We have to overcome this bloody swamp, the king's waiting for us, 
we must not be late, cold is 
the night and warm is our heart, 
we've finally arrived at the emperor's town: (emperor:)
