Friend, look at the sky, winds of storm, dark clouds of war 
And now, remember him, our mighty king, he died yesterday 

[BRIDGE:]
He was a symbol of faith, he fought for peace and glory 
Lord, many battles he won, many lands he gained 

[CHORUS:]
But now, we are alone, noone could make us win today 
King, protect our souls, enemies are coming 

[SOLO - Matt Treasure]

Silence comes over the field, dead warriors' blood on the ground (and I pray) 
Enemies sing for the victory, noone's left of us all (and I pray) 

There will be the time for a revenge, the fallen kingdom will rise again 
We will live in a peaceful reign, no more tears we will shed 

[BRIDGE - CHORUS]
