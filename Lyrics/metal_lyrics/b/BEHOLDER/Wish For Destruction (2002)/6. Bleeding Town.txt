Sent to deny the freedom of every man on earth
To make the system fall, a new government will grow
the leaders gave the orders
No doubt about the plan: impose our law on every nation of the world
But now we want to change the rules
We won't do what they want
They will see what they created
No, there's no time anymore
And you will watch the show

Hot roads! You have to run away
Your time! No way to go
Your life we will deny today
All you have to do is praying now!

You'd better come back home now, pray for the last time
For now there's no more order in your bleeding town
Breaking the institutions the system has to fall
The seven leaders won't control us anymore

'Cause now we're going to change the rules
We are not slaves anymore
They will fear what they created

No, there's no time anymore
And you will watch the show

Hot roads! You have to run away
Your time! No way to go
Your life we will deny today
All you have to do is praying now!

Bleeding town, get down!
Hell's back, you know here comes the age of killers
There's no time anymore
And you will watch the show

Hot roads! You have to run away
Your time! No way to go
Your life we will deny today
All you have to do is praying now!
