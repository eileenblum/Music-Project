Last night we met to talk about all we need before we go
Testing sessions have been right, time has come to start the show!

My eyes are watching the rain falling on the streets now
I can't stop thinking about what will happen there
If our men will be soon eliminated
Discovered by some federal agent

I feel the time is right for changes
We'll have control on the world
Your eyes are going to see the show

Get ready to see the show

Are we the leaders of the world?
Are we the ones that can make the system fall?
Is this a dream or real hope?
We know for sure that we'll be damned or we'll be Gods

I feel the wind's blowing fast and the rain is falling
It surely will take away this hypocrisy
The world is ready to follow the right direction
We'll make it real,  our wish for destruction

I feel the time is right for changes
We'll have control on the world
Your eyes are going to see the show

Are we the leaders of the world?
Are we the ones that can make the system fall?
Is this a dream or real hope?
We know for sure that we'll be damned or we'll be Gods

Get ready to see the show
Are we the leaders of the world?
Are we the ones that can make the system fall?
Is this a dream or real hope?
We know for sure that we'll be damned or:
Are we the leaders of the world? Are we the chosen ones?
Are we the leaders of the world? We know that time has come for us to go!
