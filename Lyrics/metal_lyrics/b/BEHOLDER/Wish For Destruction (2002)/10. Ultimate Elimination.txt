There's no other chance to stop this bloody slaughter we can not control
All is lost!
We have failed and now we know that time has
Come to do the final move and
We will blow up the whole world: We've no hope!

3,2,1 to death! The count is on!

We're not winners at all
We won't change any law
Everything's out of control, time has come right now! So: farewell!

Program running, time is coming
No-men ready to destroy the whole world
Planet's end is near and we are
Praying God for his forgiveness
But there's nothing we can say: It's too late!

3,2,1 to death! The count is on

We're not winners at all
We won't change any law
Everything's out of control, time has come right now! So: farewell!

There's no other chance to stop this
Bloody slaughter we cannot control: All is lost!
We have failed and now we know that time has
Come to do the final move and
We will blow up the whole world: We've no hope!

3,2,1, death! The count is on

We're not winners at all
We're just losers today
Everything's out of control, time has come right now!
We're not leaders, no more
We won't change any law
We've lost the power to guide all the world
