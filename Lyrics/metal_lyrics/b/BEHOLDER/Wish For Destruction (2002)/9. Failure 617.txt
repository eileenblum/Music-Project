Why did the red alarm start?
Which one can tell the reason why?
There's a system failure
It should be a bug

No, we've lost control! Nothing we can do!
Failure 617! We have no solution!

No chance to find a way to stop the clones!
Try to reset it all! Try until system is over: or this may be the end!

Failure left our slaves free yeah
They now are all out of control
They are crunching numbers
They think by their own

No, we've lost control! Nothing we can do!
Failure 617! We have no solution!

No chance to find a way to stop the clones!
Try to reset it all! Try until system is over: or this may be the end!

No chance to find a way to stop the clones!
Try to reset it all! Try until system is over: or this will be the
End of our plan and a danger for the earth
Nobody knows the way to stop our clones
There's no way out!
