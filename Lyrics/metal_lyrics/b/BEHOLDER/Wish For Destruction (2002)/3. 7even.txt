Listen to me now, let's decide the way we'll go
Let the game begin to realise our evil will

We'll have a thousand slaves
Just bodies without a name
The system will fall on its knees and we'll rule the world

You'll come to serve our will
You'll walk alone on the way to hell

We are seven minds, ready to become second to no one
Our laboratory's working to create the clones

We'll lead an army of no-men
They will just do what we want
Following orders they will put your soul in our hands

You'll come to serve our will
You'll walk alone on the way to hell
