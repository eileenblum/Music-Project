Streets are invaded by thousands of killers
Total damnation's near
You'd better run away for this is real
They're gonna kill, you're the next
Here comes the fire
Fear's rising up and nobody knows where to hide
Death is the aim and nothing is left to do but crying

Here comes the fire the end is near
Here comes damnation's law
You won't survive you won't run away
Feel the scent of death, there's no other way

Presidents and leaders found at home
Bullets in their own heads
All the institutions burn in flames
They're breaking all, sheding blood
The world is on fire
No one can tell who's to blame for this bloody hell
Nobody knows if tomorrow the sun will shine again
Here comes the fire the end is near
Here comes damnation's law
You won't survive you won't run away
Feel the scent of death, there's no other way

Ladies and gentlemen your place is there
Cemetery of human race
The seven leaders are now the ones
Born to destroy and possess your mind!
No one will find a solution to put things right
Nobody knows if tomorrow the earth will see the light
Here comes the fire the end is near
Here comes damnation's law
You won't survive you won't run away
Feel the scent of death, there's no other way
