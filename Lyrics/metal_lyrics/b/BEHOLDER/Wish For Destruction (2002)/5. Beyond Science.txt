Science, beyond the limits of science, beyond the laws of men
Secret research for the one, now here we are!
Day by day working hard, testing stages
Creating copies of perfect no-men, we've got now all we need to go

Our mind is full of bloody hate, our plan is
A killer game that will not fail
We'll rule everywhere!

Killers, we have a thousand killers slave to the system we created
Ready to do what we say, now, what we want!
Day by day working hard, testing stages
Creating copies of perfect no-men, we've got now all we need to go

No one's expecting their arrive, no one will
No one will ever stop our plan
We'll kill everywhere!

Beware our no-men, they will lead you straight to hell no time to run away
They were born to serve and kill, realise our goal to lead the world!
