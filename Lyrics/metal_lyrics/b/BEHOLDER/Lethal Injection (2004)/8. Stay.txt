[Lyrics &amp; Music: Patrick Wire]

I'm Waiting For The Night To Come
Despite My Pain I'm Still Alive
Recalling All My Energies
Look At Me, There's A Hole In My Mind
And I Don't Know Where I Can Go
Going To Mowhere...

I've Gotta Stay
Don't Wanna Listen To The Voice Inside
I've Gotta Stay
If I Have To Go I'll Never Stop My Run

I Wonder Why That Bloody Night
I Was Insane Or What They Say
I Can't Remember What I've Done
They Say I'm Guilty Of This Crime
What Can I Say?

I've Gotta Stay
Don't Wanna Listen To The Voice Inside
I've Gotta Stay
If I Have To Go I'll Never Stop My...
I've Gotta Stay
Don't Wanna Listen To The Voice Inside
I've Gotta Stay
If I Have To Go I'll Never Stop My Run
