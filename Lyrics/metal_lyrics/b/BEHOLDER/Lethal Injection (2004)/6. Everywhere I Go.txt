[Lyrics &amp; Music: Patrick Wire]

Night Is Falling, Time's To Walk Away
Getting Out Of Matters And Questions
Nobody Knows How I Love To Walk Alone
Like A Soul Always Searching For Freedom

I Don't Know Where It Comes From
That Voice That Follows Me Always
I Can't Say Who Is The One
That Wants To Drive My Mind Away

I Feel It Everywhere I Go
It's In The Air, Is In My Mind
I Feel It Every Time I Walk
It's Like A Cry Breaking The Night

There's No Light On My Lonely Way
And I Am Following That Voice
There Are Nights When I Run Away
'Cause I'm Afraid To Discover The Screamer

Tonight I Am On The Way
And Now I Finally Know Where
That Voice Of Child's Coming From
Trying To Escape From My Memory

I Feel It Everywhere I Go
It's In The Air, Is In My Mind
I Feel It Every Time I Walk
It's Like A Cry Breaking The Night

There's No Light On My Lonely Way
And I Am Following That Voice
There Are Nights When I Run Away
'Cause I'm Afraid To Discover The Screamer

I Don't Know Where It Comes From
That Voice That Follows Me Always
I Can't Say Who Is The One
That Wants To Drive My Mind Away

I Feel It Everywhere I Go
It's In The Air, Is In My Mind
I Feel It Every Time I Walk
It's Like A Cry Breaking The Night
