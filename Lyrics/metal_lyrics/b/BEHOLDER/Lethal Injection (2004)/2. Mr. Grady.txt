Snow Falls On The Overlook Hotel
Winter's Coming Closer
No Way To Escape From There
Jack Walks Up And Down

The Hall Of The Hotel Is Full Of People
Dancing In The Night
Torrance Needs To Drink A Shot
Mr. Grady Is Waiting

Now Listen To Me, You've Got To Kill The Liars
They Want To Get Away From Here
You Have To Do What I Say
Follow Your Will, Before The End Of Winter
You Have To Kill Your Son And Wife
They Have To Respect Your Law

Wendy Wants To Get Away
From That Place Of Death
Danny Sees Bloody Scenes
Shining On His Mind

She Is Looking For A Way Out
Wendy Tries To Go
Growing Fear In The Eyes
Jack Is Going Crazy

Now Listen To Me, You've Got To Kill The Liars
They Want To Get Away From Here
You Have To Do What I Say
Follow Your Will, Before The End Of Winter
You Have To Kill Your Son And Wife
They Have To Respect Your Law

Just Look Around, Snow Is Falling Down, No Way To Get Out
Outside The Overlook The Storm Has Come, Death Is Waiting For
Rage Is Growing Through The Flats, Bloody Visions All Around
All The Lights Fade Away, Storm Will Bring The Pain

Now Listen To Me, You've Got To Kill The Liars
They Want To Get Away From Here
You Have To Do What I Say
Follow Your Will, Before The End Of Winter
You Have To Kill Your Son And Wife
They Have To Respect Your Law
