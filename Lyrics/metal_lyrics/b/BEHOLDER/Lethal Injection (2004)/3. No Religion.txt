[Lyrics &amp; Music: Patrick Wire]

From My Life I Received A Legacy
That Drives My Mind Away
A Lot Of Voices In My head
Screaming From The Depth Calling My Name
Nobody Takes Care Of Me
And Nobody Will Understand

I've Got No Religion, No God
Don't Ask Me Where I'm Going
Just Look Into My Eyes Right Now
And Tell Me Who I Am

Come With Me On My Way
And You Should See The Actors Of A Show
I Could Be Four Or Five
Characters And You Would Not Be Sure
If You Ever Speak To Me Don't Try
To Guess Who I Am This Time

I've Got No Religion, No God
Don't Ask Me Where I'm Going
Just Look Into My Eyes Right Now
And Tell Me Who I Am
And Tell Me Who I Am

I Am Walking Slowly On My Way
But I Don't Get Where To Go
I'm Feeling Deep Inside My Head
The Calling Of The Men I Really Hate
Break The Silence With Your Voice
And Tell Me Who's The Man That You See

I've Got No Religion, No God
Don't Ask Me Where I'm Going
Just Look Into My Eyes Right Now
And Tell Me Who I Am
And Tell Me Who I Am
I've Got No Religion, No God
Don't Ask Me Where I'm Going
Just Look Into My Eyes Right Now
And Tell Me Who I Am
