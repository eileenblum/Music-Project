[Lyrics &amp; Music: Patrick Wire]

You Are Walking Down The Street
And Your Eyes Look 'Round
Every Single Day You Say
This Ain't The Life You Wanna Live
'Cause You Are Born To Go On
With Your Real Skill
Everybody Say It's Not Your Way

Everyday You See People Are
Unhappy With Their Lives
What They Do Is Never What
They Really Wanna Do To Live
But You Don't Wannna Waste
All Your Lifetime
Break The Chains
Start Thinking With Your Mind

All We Want Is Not A Daydream, No!
All We Need Is To Be Free To Live
Try To Be Who You Really Want To Be
And Never Listen To No One
(Listen To No One)
Go Straight On Your Way If You Wanna Be The One!

You Know Everybody Wants To Be Someone
Let Your Mind Decide
What You've Gotta Have To Carry On
'Till The Day When You Finally Will Get A Chance
'Till The Day When You Will Play Your Game

Walk Alone Tonight Looking At The Stars
Shining On Your Way
They Will Tell Your Eyes The Place To Go
You ave To Be Ready
'Cause If You Fail Now
You Won't Have A Second Chance To Try

All We Want Is Not A Daydream, No!
All We Need Is To Be Free To Live
Try To Be Who You Really Want To Be
And Never Listen To No One
(Listen To No One)
Go Straight On Your Way If You Wanna Be The One!
