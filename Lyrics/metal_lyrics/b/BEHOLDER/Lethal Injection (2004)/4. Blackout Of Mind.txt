[Lyrics &amp; Music: Patrick Wire]

I Used To Cry, I Used To Get Angry, To Smile Or To Fight
I Used To Be A Man
All I Want Is To Go Where I Deserve To Go
All I Want Is To Break The Silence In My Head

Leave Me Alone
There No Second Way To Reload My Life, Let Me Go
Leave Me Alone
I'm A Shadow Of The Man I Used To Be, Pain No More

My Aim Is Clear, My Will's To Shut Down My Life And My Pain
For That's My Way
All I Want Is To Go Where I Deserve To Go
All I Need Is A Bullet And My Gun To Die

Leave Me Alone
There No Second Way To Reload My Life, Let Me Go
Leave Me Alone
I'm A Shadow Of The Man I Used To Be, Pain No More

All I Want Is To Go Where I Deserve To Go
All I Want Is To Break The Silence In My Head

Leave Me Alone
There No Second Way To Reload My Life, Let Me Go
Leave Me Alone
I'm A Shadow Of The Man I Used To Be, Pain No More
