[Lyrics: Patrick Wire, Music: Mark Vikar, Patrick Wire]

There's A Place Deep Inside
There's A Voice, When I Cry
It Reminds Me What I Feel
When You Look Into My Eyes
And You Smile To Me
All The World Fades Away

I Will Leave At The End Of This Night
It's Hard To Say To You
I Will Leave, While You're Sleeping Alone
So Hold Me Tight Once More

When I'm Walking Here Alone
No One Knows How I Miss
All The Moments Passed With You
Heaven Is A Place Inside
It's Inside Of Me
'Cause You Give Me All I Need

I Will Leave At The End Of This Night
It's Hard To Say To You
I Will Leave, While You're Sleeping Alone
So Hold Me Tight Once More

Far Away From Here, Far Away From You
No, I Can Not Go On
To Live Alone, To Live Alone
Live Alone, To Live Alone
Live Alone, To Live Alone

I Will Leave At The End Of This Night
It's Hard To Walk Away
I Will Leave, While You're Sleeping Alone
But I'll Come Back Again
I Will Leave At The End Of This Night
It's Hard To Say To You
I Will Leave, While You're Sleeping Alone
So Hold Me Tight, And Hold Me Tight...
