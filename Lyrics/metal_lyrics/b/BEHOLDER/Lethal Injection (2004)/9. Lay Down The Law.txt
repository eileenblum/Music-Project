[Lyrics &amp; Music: Patrick Wire]

Lay Down The Law Tonight!

Ruling The Night On A Highway To Nowhere
We Are The Riders Of Thunder
Breaking The Silence With Fire
Leaving The Town, We Do Not Have Destination
Tonight We'll Run Till The Sunrise
Nobody Will Ever Stop The Race

It Seems Like We're Flying To The Sky
Start The Engines, Hear Them Roaring Loud
And We Are Free To Ride

Lay Down The Law Tonight
Find The Way To Get Out Of Reality
Lay Down The Law Tonight
Where Your Voice Has The Power Of A Storm
Lay Down The Law!

Running Away, There's No Intention To Come Back
Life Is So Hard And We Know
All Chains Have To Be Broken Now
Singing It Loud, We Always Wanted To Be
The Brightest Stars Of This Rock Show
Nobody Will Ever Kill The Dream

It Seems Like We're Flying To The Sky
Start The Engines, Hear Them Roaring Loud
And We Are Free To Ride

Lay Down The Law Tonight
Find The Way To Get Out Of Reality
Lay Down The Law Tonight
Where Your Voice Has The Power Of A Storm
Lay Down The Law!

Lay Down The Law Tonight
Find The Way To Get Out Of Reality
Lay Down The Law Tonight
Where Your Voice Has The Power Of A Storm
Lay Down The Law!
