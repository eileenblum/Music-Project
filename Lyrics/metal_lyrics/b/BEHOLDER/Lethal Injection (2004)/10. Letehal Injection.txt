[Lyrics &amp; Music: Patrick Wire]

[Part One: The Executioner]

Once Upon A Time You Know
We Were Friends, We Were Young
All The Things We've Done
Lost Far Back In Time

Then You Became A Man
I Knew Nothing Of Your Life
'Till That Bloody Night
I Can't Understand The Reason Why

If You Look Into My Eyes
You'll See I'm Not The One
Are We Going To Kill And Innocent Man
Without Blame?
You're A Slave To The Law
Don't Ever Cry For Me
I Can't Watch Through Your Eyes
While The Venom Runs Down In Your Veins

You Know You Were My Best Friend
I Could Always Trust In You
Even If I Speak
Words Would Mean Nothing

I Keep Asking Myself Why
You Became A Bloody Killer
I Cannot Agree
If What They Say Is Right You've Got To Die

If You Look Into My Eyes
You'll See I'm Not The One
Are We Going To Kill And Innocent Man
Without Blame?
You're A Slave To The Law
Don't Ever Cry For Me
I Can't Watch Through Your Eyes
While The Venom Runs Down In Your Veins

[Part Two: Crying To God]

I Can't Say I Am Not
The Man They Search For
My Way Has Reached A Point Of No Return
It's Cold And I'm Alone

Sometimes You Feel It's Over
The End Is Coming Now
I'm Crying To My God
If He's Listening To My Voice
I Can Be Saved

Sometimes You Feel It's Over
The End Is Coming Now
I'm Crying To My God
If He's Listening To My Voice
I Can Be Saved

Sometimes You Feel It's Over
(Sometimes You Feel It's Over)
The End Is Coming Now
I'm Crying To My God
If He's Listening To My Voice
I Can Be Saved

I Feel The End Is Near...
(Near... Near... Near...)
