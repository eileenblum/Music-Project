Hark the howl ov pestilential wind!
Atem, devourer ov life forever blackening!

Sculpted in stone by the Assyrian wind
Semen ov Hanpa has vomited Thee forth
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer ov lies

Hark the howl ov pestilential wind!
Atem, devourer ov life forever blackening!

Unveil the primal chaos within Thyself
Daughter ov Anu slain, Lamashtu annihilate!
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer ov lies

Transcending the wrath ov The Great Black
Slay the reptile!
Slay I command!

May 107 complete the cycle
When aeon ov Seth emerges
The desert storms can not be tamed
When concubine ov chaos begins her dance
Reveal to us overwhelming might
Release Thy rage destroyer ov lies
