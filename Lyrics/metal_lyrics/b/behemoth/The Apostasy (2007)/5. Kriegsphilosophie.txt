From long forgotten aeons
At sunrise Thou shouldst come
Desired for so fuckin' long
Ascend at my command
Surmount the sea
Throw open portals ov life
And scale this endless mountain
Ov grace and ov tears
Oh voice unspoken, mourn unheard
Abandoned heart so desolate

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne
When sun is yet to rise
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond...

When heavenly chants mute
Thy apparition did I behold oh Venus, the sweetest ov them all
Let me bathe in Thy divinity
Descend! and Thou hast descended
Depart not yet!
I crave for warmth ov blissful rays
And fateless eyes encourage me
The ancient dreaming
The wolf's unchained
Disobedience has such a victorious taste...

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne
When sun is yet to rise
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond...

Forever abandoned among gods
...Since I have been made flesh,
And yet I challenge Thee!
Canst Thou hear my battle cry?

Non serviam my friends.
There are no gods beyond those made ov human flesh.
There is no more divine potential than a human potential and let this be the mightiest ov all laws!
