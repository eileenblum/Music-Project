Nergal's comment: "I remember it took as a few weeks to compose all the songs
and I was very determinate to record them in the professional studio. It was
still quite amateurish studio so did the session. We still were poor musicians
but we knew what our goal was...We were heading to the darkside and we called
our music BLACK METAL, it was very fresh and special feeling at that time.
We've never had such a relation between me and Baal before. It was something I
can't describe in any mortal language, we were still very young but "someone"
or "something" was leading us forward, to dimensions to be discovered later...
But let's back to the session for a while...I remember well we were completely
disoriented, I didn't know how to tune the guitar properly and Baal had so
many problems with playing on pad drum set which is audible on the record.
Hah, anyway, today some people still enjoy "The return.." a lot, there are
even opinions about this tape of being the best one, from everything we've
done so far. Well, eventhough I don't share such opinions I still like this
stuff and have a great sentiment...but that's obvious I guess..."
