mystic voices lead me to suicide
I will unite my flesh with him tonight
blasphemous son in my veins
into the magic circle

lord of dark winds
obscure my soul
burn my eyes
make me see illusions

burning in black flames forever
the child of my morbid perversion
is screaming glory of darkness
sing the occultic psalm

with the book of eternal oath
I created the face of the goat
unholy psalm to lead the souls
blood means the pact with my lord

cold winds of doom prevail
7 horns sing the prophecy
glory to the darkest depth
revelate my eternal prayer
