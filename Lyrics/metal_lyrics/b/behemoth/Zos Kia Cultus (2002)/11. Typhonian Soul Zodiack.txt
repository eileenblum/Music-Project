Above the high temple ov matter
Svastikas ov time slash the heaven
And from the pit, from the slime
From the thought
Gliphotic intruder decays
Lilith, Thantilaxath, Zi'uaq
Non-manifestation born in the dark ov a day

Can you hear distant desert call?
And stone you see - by Adytum builders
...rejected, damned?
Deeper, deeper, in the night, world, fear
Towards the noctuary ov the truth

From the mirror we crawls out
Devouring Eden's light
In the tunnels ov Seth he abides
Shugal, The Howler!

Who am I? Where I'm going? Where?
We live dreaming
Slipping from body to body
And nightmares still our breath
And his in our souls
Poisoning with the venom ov existence

Just say "Illusion"
When the first sunray falls
In your hawk eye
And don't look in the past
It hurts and there the Shadow lies in wait
So with every step on the oath
Beyond good and evil
Stronger GOD you became
