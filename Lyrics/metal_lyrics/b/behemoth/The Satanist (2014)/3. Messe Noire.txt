[music by Nergal; lyrics by Nergal and Krzysztof Azarewicz]

I believe in Satan
Who rend both heavens and earth
And in the Antichrist
His dearly misbegotten
The anguish ov our future
A Bastard spawned from lie
Born ov a harlot nun
Reign high in luxury
Aloft the kings ov man

I use words sharp as a sword
To rake Saints âshins bestrewn
Three days risen â the grand deceiver
I bless the world with ire and woe

So, can you hoard host like Zionâs coin
Belie progeny ov your pain?
IHWH, thou sayeth unto me:
Thou, disrupter, imbalance my creations!
Hence I transfix in bliss ov flagellation
I burnt in rapture, wafted ash aboutâ¦
Became the law above all laws
In asymmetry ov the horns

I cut loose the cord ov li(f)e
Depart celestial source
Rub mould in holy pages
Let woodworms eat the cross
I prayed Iâd die in you O Lord
I pray youâd die in meâ¦

Who shall crucify the last prophets
And have them wilt on splintered stems?
Who shall churn hells across the earth
And reascend to seat himselfâ¦
At the left hand ov Satan
Be gaoler ov the living
â¦And ov the dead
As it was in the beginning
Now and shall ever be
â¦World without end
Amen
