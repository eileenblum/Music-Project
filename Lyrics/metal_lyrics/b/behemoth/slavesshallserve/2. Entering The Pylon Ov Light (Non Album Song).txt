Earth bedewed with seed ov death
Sheds the blood red tears
And I saw the hearth ov youth
Painfully torn out by the mighty Apep
Heart which still wants to live

Here, among the sonorous chorals
Ov mourning clothed with rain ov blood
Innocence touches the heart
But this touch penetrates only empty air
There is no life but time for a shadow
And time for a night

Mithras, Abraxas, Phallos
Serpent power, awake the dawn
Rise the pyramids ov the inmost flame
To break through
Illusions ov life and the phantoms ov death

To exist is not given to you
Oh, Asar, you are the Past One
Go and dwell among the sorrows ov Asi
Awaken I dream and see sleeping gods
And I draw the curtains ov all worlds
The veil of Isis and thou art as Persephone
Who touches the flowers ov the underworld
Yeah! I descend into the depths ov thought
To find thee in the kingdoms ov Hades
In the labyrinth ov mind
To bring thee to life, to give a form
To incarnate into the flesh
To give priceless jewels, by sages called delight
And the senses ov the earth
