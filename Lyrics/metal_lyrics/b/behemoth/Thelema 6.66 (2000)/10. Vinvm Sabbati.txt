waters' running down
by the silver moonrays -
towards the foundation
reflecting themselves
in the mirror ov dreams
and creating deadly forms ov life

vinvm sabbati
crystal formula
melted by the fire ov lust

etera zetgiell
emoke selene a helios
bey este'ike eliech
zeresse'naa essekeeee

astral dominion
by the witches virtu's rul'd
desire equinox
tension releas'd
liberated
in the senses dance

vinvm sabbati
where the sigil branded
on the breast, for'head
and temple ov atlantis

rise we upon the ladder
ov blasphemies
towering o'er the heavens
where our empty laugh rings
and fingers touch the face
ov god disabled
