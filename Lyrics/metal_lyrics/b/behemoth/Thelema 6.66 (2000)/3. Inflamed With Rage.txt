listen ye all who can preach
I am the god's begotten son
I tell three woe shall be no more
woe, thou shalt end up in flames!

no horns I have nor pair ov wings
I am the balance ov thy universe
I have no number
I have no name
not fear'd ov laws
need to restrain

ancestor ov all gods
the one among the ancient ones

speak ye all who can speak
keep thy instincts ever alert
thou art the stars that shine among us
and honour me as thee adore the sun

and stand ye all brave and proud
and watch the babel hill turn into ash
admire my shapes among the ruins of jericho
behold my wrath I hath showered the earth

ancestor ov all gods
the one among the ancient ones
the paynim rite drew in my shade
I am the one who begot the earth
