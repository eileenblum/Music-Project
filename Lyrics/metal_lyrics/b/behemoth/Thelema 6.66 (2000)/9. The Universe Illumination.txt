ov circus my world wiseman call'd
ov drunken trickster bed
and not violators of thoughts they're
for life is a theatre
in which actors all we are
but when curtain is open
there is no time for any reh's

and as all lights turn'd on were
and the first act is begun...
...and the last my mouth I open'd
i, purple sage in the universal
and I speak in tongue unknown
and behold all stood in flames

su na'aq tem kah chaph keb ngaa sul tamed mes
no sedem cha'no umes maog etem chaph keb la'at
qui sulib

and hardly ye remember dark november days
when received ye rain ov sulphur
when earth came apart under thine feet
and wasn't it rage ov thine god
and wasn't ye his somdom
it's "only" laugh mine empty
sob silent and helpless gesture
