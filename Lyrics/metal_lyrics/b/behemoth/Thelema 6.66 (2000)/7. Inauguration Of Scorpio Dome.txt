lvcifer!
lvcifer!
aivass!

so every man and woman is a star
but who is scorpio by fire ring'd
where fall means increase?

when on the throne ov life he seats
the bloody sword ov freedom sways
and light ov hells in his eyes
and secret breath ov love

as the first whore ov the world
banish'd god from body
carnal divinity she restor'd
as infinite ov nightsky
augmn ov sothis
when tunnel ov tuat means disorder
past, future, painful
and from the eternal revolt we're born
to word can make flesh

a breeze- a leaf- a shadow the falling of a bud-
the wind across the meadow- a flesh of light-
a call- a patter on the wall-the air is bright as
blood a moment stands a shadow a moment
sounds a call
