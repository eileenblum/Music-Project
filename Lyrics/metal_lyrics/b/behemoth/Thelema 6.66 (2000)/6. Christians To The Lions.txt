behold bastard son
I am the evil one
no glory to be reached
no more thy slavery
the passion I besieged
spawn terror
smash thy will
ye pale dominion fades away my
will dominates

and watch my star arise
burning up the earth
sun - the eye of gods
threw into the space
watch ye moon eclipse
fallinf from thy grace
watch all nations cry
all feared ov his name
praise the flame!
watch angels falling from the skies
praise the flame!
I killed thy god
my will is done!
thou art lord

rise me! rise me high!
lead thru the gates ov sun
rise me! rise me high!
where angels do not dare to fly
invite to feast ov gods
and let me drift away
leave flames ov infamy
and watch me kiss the stars
