I, pan satyros
rise I through ye spiral light
follow'd I ye path ov a'yin,
where ye all-begetting eye rests
across ye cascade ov sensations
and ye consciousness ov body
volcano ov emotions am I
ye ring ov saturn -
two thousand years am I and more

by ye four powers ov sphinx
ye book ov albion open'd -
and four cherubic beasts
each in one quarter
wander'd across ye world

ye holiest gathering ov souls
ov ye fool empty sight -
ye devil - wild laugh
and my mourning, as snow white
paradox ov meanings
sacrifice is done
dogs ov darkness to ashes reduc'd
in ye sirius shine
that my way illuminates
in company ov heaven
ye eternal one
in madness ov night
in madness ov day
