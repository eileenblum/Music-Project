been haunted be the paws ov fear
and felt his breath upon my neck
I was granted with the pain divine
and my voice was heard no more in heaven

great in power
thus call'st me almighty
in not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee

come over to seduce your angels
been born to rape your mother's holy womb
rebel
so call me now
as I stand above ye all

leave me unworshipped
in the dens below forever I shall dwell
malice in heart was bred and lives again
my legions hid in south eden
my flaming passions
oceans ov love
and all thou call'st
the evil
I summon thee
bringer ov war
bearer ov light
earth's son

great in power
thus call'st me almighty
in not be first archangel
I shall be the last among thee
