Morning Star
Phosporos
How Thou shinest in the fiery
Empyrean above
Paracletus
How do I rejoice, for Thy apostles flock around

For Thou art Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within
Limbo is stirring up Thy cells
Below Sheol, where odium dwells
Reverse Davidian psalm
The jaws ov Hades set ajar

Let the cold moon
lick the blood from my stigmatas
Let the burning sun
devour gore from my wounds

For I am Christ a rebours!
L'enfer abides deep within
Limbo is stirring up in my cells
Deep down below my odium dwells
Reverse Davidian psalm
The jaws ov Pandemonium set ajar

"I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore."
"I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore."
