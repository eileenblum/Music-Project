I am she who spits out the lusts
The root ov sin derived from me
I am born ov sacrilegious uterus
Magna peccatrix
I am she who cast the adversaries out
I am the spawn ov her vulva obsolete
Libera nos blasfemia madonna
Magna hecate

With the sound ov trumpets!
With the pounding ov demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!

With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be exalted!
Come to be despised!

For i am Aurora's son
With no beginnin, with no decline
Sabbath ,atter dolorosa
A progency ov her lecherous cunt
Love me orgasmically
Fuck me estatically
Genetrix meretix
I pledge my heart to thee
I bow down devotedly

With the sound ov trumpets!
With the pounding ov demon drums!
Come forth within!
Come forth without!

With the roaring thunders
With the blinding light
Come to be honoured
And to be despised!

Blessed be the destroyer
For she's the creator!
