Begone!

Ye prophets ov Eucharist
My praise shall climb to your decline
May rust corrode on Michael's sword
Recession ov the progeny divine

Come forth ye!
Preachers ov imminent death
Let loose the mighty beasts upon
Damnatio Ad Bestiam!
Bring an end to this decrepit world

Countless my legions
Many my names
A thousand descendants
A goat ov Mendez

Come forth ye!
Heralds ov ruir
And mute to dust their anaemic way's
Futile relic ov an utopian age
King ov kings recrucified
What an ignominious end!

El Shaddai
Woe unto Thee O Galilean God Be Thou ashamed YHWH!
Woe unto Thee To aeons I curse!

Countless my legions
Many my names
A thousand young
A goat ov Mendez

For I am my Christ over myself
The accused became the accuser
For I am Satan incarnate
Serpent ov old immaculate!
