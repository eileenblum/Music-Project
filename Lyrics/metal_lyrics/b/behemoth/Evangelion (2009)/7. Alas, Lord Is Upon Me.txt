[Music and lyrics by Nergal]

"Let them hate me, so that they will but fear me." [Caligula]

"Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them
Bring them here and kill them in front of me"
[Jesus, (Luke 19:27)]

Behold! As Rome burns so do I...
'tis not the last empire to crumble
I bore witness to rise and fall ov tribes ov Adonai
And fallen short ov a glory ov god

Lord ov hosts
Whore ov salvation
Tear the skies as you spread your legs
Vomit forth upon my head
All afflictions and abominations known to man
