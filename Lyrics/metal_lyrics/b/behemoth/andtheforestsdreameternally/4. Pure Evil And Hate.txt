In the night of full moon sacrifice
We are joining with the sign of drums of war
Freezing moon opens the gates of paradise
Our swords are raised up to the skies

Pure evil and hate!
Sodomy and pain!

Where the holy angel's dwell we'll burn it down
We'll turn on hate god's flower of love
Brain of lust we'll spread everywhere
Our pagan brothers will sodomize Christ's flesh

Pure evil and hate!
Sodomy and pain!
