[David Bowie cover]

Space...
Space...
Spaceboy

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary

Spaceboy, you're sleepy now
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free

Don't you want to be free
Do you like girls or boys
It's confusing these days

But moondust will cover you
Cover you

This chaos is killing me
Space fucking boy

Spaceboy, fuck you
Space fucking boy

Bye bye love
Bye bye fucking spaceboy
Bye bye love
Fuck up Spaceboy!

Bye bye my love
