[Track recorded during the "Evangelion" sessions.]From the blood of the earth
From its sacred soil
That alters a spell
Contorting with the stars of revenge
Come forth, martyrs of the underworld!

Blessed, but thou are not!
Cruel godhead, thy child, and in the world for so long
Its expression I draw out and march towards the sun
Unleashing force
Can't stop me now!

Born of the seas
The setting tides confine reality
Between future ov the living, perdition I dwell
Anointed by blissful hypocria that never ends!

In unyielding expression of selflessness
Where I dare to challenge thy gravity
Thus, speaks the nature of my ways
Thus, the true light illuminates!

Here lie limitless sins ov eminence
Where valiant boats implode, drifts the world netherwards
Standing with face of hell, lest we flog what's crucified
I shall layeth with my soul to rest, until I reach the sun's might!

Nergal: guitars, vocals
Orion: bass
Inferno: drums
