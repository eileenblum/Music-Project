TysiÄc lat, tysiÄc pierdolonych lat
DziesiÄÄ ciemnych wiekÃ³w,
Dlaczego!?
GnusnieliÅmy w wilczych norach,
a naszÄ ÅwiÄtoÅÄ czas pogrzebaÅ,
i krzyÅ¼ wielki drewniany,
wciÄÅ¼ rzuca krwawy cieÅ,
na waszÄ przeszÅoÅÄ!
Co potrzebujecie bÄdzie wam dane
Czy ta zdradziecka bestia wciÄÅ¼ Å¼yje,
i nikt, nikt nie zapomni,
Nikt!,
Å¼e juÅ¼ czas prÃ³cz tego powolnego,
ktÃ³ry taki zgarbiony, niedoÅÄÅ¼ny
Ålepy na tronie watykanu.
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
To my jesteÅmy morzem Apokalipsy,
ostatniÄ nadziejÄ odradzajÄcej siÄ istoty,
Waszym piekÅem,
Naszym ukojeniem.
I nie topory, lecz wspomnienia,
bÄdÄ piÅy krew WaszÄ tam,
na ArmagedeÅskich polach
DziÅ my karcimy waszego
Åcinamy gÅowÄ Watykanu
KtÃ³rÄ wyÅlemy zanim przyjdzie tam
Gdzie wasza wiara rozpostarÅa
Swe brudne skrzydÅa
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!
Dzisiaj...
Åcinamy gÅowÄ Watykanu
w koronie
Ludzie,
ludzie siÄ od Åmierci ociÄgajÄ
NienawiÅÄ...
Lecz tego miejscca juÅ¼ nie ma!
Hail! Hail!
PomÅcimy!!!
PomÅcimy, tak!!!
Hail! Hail!
Wojna!!!

Nergal's comment:
"This has been the best period in our existence, the most successful, the most
promising one, a period in which the band proned to become as much
professional as it was possible. And I must say we really succeeded. Just take
a look at the album's artwork, everything has been done perfectly in each
smallest detail. The sound is another thing we may discuss on now...this time
we entered much better studio SELANI (the one VADER and CHRIST AGONY used for
their last albums) and it's audible for sure. It's much clearer this time, you
can't say a bad word about it...all the instruments are exposed in much
better way. The only thing I can complain on is the promotion done by
SOLISTITIUM REC. which in fact was none. No advertisements in pro-press, well,
yeah, we did the widest European tour so far, in company with ANCIENT and
BELPHEGOR, but it didn't help that much selling's numbers...Anyway, this
album should be seen as a first professional step towards becoming a top
band...this is a real proof we do our best to achieve our goals and we'll
definitely follow that way, that's more than sure."
