[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Leviathan!
eternally Thy powers rage within
I am reborn
purified
in the burning flames ov Sodom
by the powers ov the gods
awaken the mighty Will
that shalt carry me through eternities
Faceless One!
avenge my torment
materialise my utmost Will
beyond all legends and myths
Thou art the emmissary ov the beast
thwart the realm above
spawning might below

[backgroud lead: Nergal]

"Give us the flesh"!
"Give us the will" I command!
Dumuzi Lord
godhead immaculate!
Thou art the sun
toward the light feel no shame
Ia Asag!
forever Thou shalt remain

in victory I burn
masacrate the enemy
in battle that I hath already won
Thee I invoke
brothers ov Ariman's seed
Thou hast aroused all beings in me
come All in One
resurrected
stronger than death Thou hast become
revert my death
hail to my return
tis time to reign as a god among man

[background lead: Nergal]

"Give us the flesh"!
"Give us the will" I command!
Dumuzi Lord
godhead immaculate!
Thou art the sun
toward the light feel no shame
Ia Asag!
forever Thou shalt remain

[lead: Nergal]
[lead: Seth]

Appolyon
o resplendant flame
begotten ov beyond
may I coruscate eternally
gods ov all perfection
I command - come forth!
in company ov Ur
all doubts and fears eclipsed

[once again the Elder Gods accompany me in yet another one ov life's journeys. the Ancient Ones have always been present in my life. my gods are equal to my tools by which I crush the burdens ov disbelief and ignorance. they are like vipers, who slash with their beaks the weakness ov the flesh and crippled minds. they are guardians ov my mortality, full ov vitality and beauty at the same time being cruel and merciless to all the enemies. they defend me from the plagues ov the world, cleansing it with its knowledge and purity.]
