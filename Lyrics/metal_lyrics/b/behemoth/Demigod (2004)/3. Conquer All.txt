[music and lyrics by Nergal]

Mightiest Self!
cast out ov Thy Elysium
with blood ov nazarene
I write the story ov man
2000 years is nothing
thought it has been enough
come forth victorious
muting the foul angelic choirs!

none ov thy empty gods, shall ever stand above me
none ov thy weak brothers, shalt ever share my blood
my awareness, catalyst, ov godhate I have spawned
in sinister ecstasy eternally I decompose

race ov man!
the errors ov a wise make Thy rules
ye shall see
rather than the perfection ov the fool
the most divine!
I am many! among so very few
beyond redemption, beyond the weak
thus I beheld the truth!

none ov thy empty gods, shall ever stand above me
none ov thy weak brothers, shalt ever share my blood
my awareness, catalyst, ov godhate I have spawned
in sinister ecstasy eternally I'm decomposed

[lead: Nergal]

I am the pure flame that burns
I am (ever shining) Sirius son
I am the infinite space
I am the most conquering One

[Crowley said "I will give you a war-engine. With it ye shall smite the peoples; and none shall stand before you. (...) Conquer! That is enough." and with "Conquer All" I try to extend the meaning ov these mighty words. these lyrics are about life offering me so many opportunities which are at hand. my passions and determination are unbreakable. unrestrained will has brought me to this path I walk. it's the whole world... it's the whole universe I wish to conquer. it's all or nothing. my music and words I speak are unlimited. I see no boundaries for true art. here and now. here and beyond.]
