[music and lyrics by Nergal]

behold! children ov Cain
all beings not ov reptilian form
be upon them!
spare none! mercy cast aside!
those who feareth not my sacred blade
shall be blessed

repent not!
Thou art man
god is no more
rise now above the weakness ov flesh
come forth! join ye the arsenals ov blasphemy
follow the One
who spurred Roman warring legions

rise up! o power from sea below all seas
SIRIUS! DRACONIS!
awake from everlasting dream!
spirits ov abomination
formless Thou hath appeared before me
I am before all things

chthonic gods! those from beyond the stars
commander ov hosts devour the flesh ov man
may their weapons melt like wax
may their tongues be torn apart
may Apophis grind their bones
may their ashes be scattered all around...

[lead: Nergal]

hear me! o vermin!
how couldst Thou fall so low?
redemption thru denial
restriction becomes a sin
mankind! so pure...
castrate Thy impotent god
vomit forth the blasphemy
and forever shalt Thee win

[oh, how many times I have tried to express my deep inner gate and disgust towards everything that's so stagnated and one dimensional. so I had to create Demigod. being that expresses the most expansive and uncompromising virtues and instincts. I choose chose to take as my own: individuality, life affirmation, ambition, determination and vitality. musically it's just pure stream ov energy, and every time I listen to the opening theme I see the berserking, frienzied, undefeated Roman legions.]

["What is good? - everything augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself, in man. What is evil? - whatever springs from weakness. What is happiness? - the feeling that power increases - that resistance is overcome." -Friedrich Nietzsche, The Antichrist]
