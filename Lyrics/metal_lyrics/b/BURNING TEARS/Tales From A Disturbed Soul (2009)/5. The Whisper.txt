And while getting lost in dreams
And the bitter creations of the mind
IÂ´m only shadows

I whip against my image
The wasted tears of past
Because when strolling in my empty path
I tune the emptiness melody

In a subtle spell
I repeat the voice
That the melancholy gave to me
That winter's night

I rise the flight
I fall and don't get up
The current drowns me
And I can't move
I'm only what you see,
Emptiness feeds me

And my weak words can not reach you

You don't hear them,
You can not feel them,
The whisper of my sorrow,
Dying in your lips

They stroll in your streets,
The lost lodgings,
Forgotten kisses, emptiness,
That how I disappear.
