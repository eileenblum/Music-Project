And the fear got me,
And he bite me, slow and softly,
He made me fall, and he laugh,
Until he see me cry (suffer),
And my blood is flowing,
Going down to the floor,
Iâm bleeding, Iâm falling down

My arms are bleeding more and more,
My veins are broken,
They take away my life,
Iâm dying, and thereâs no return, to me,
Iâm dying, and thereâs no return to me, to me,
Iâm dying, Iâm dying, and there is no return to me.
