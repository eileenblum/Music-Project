The sun falls
And the night is strained into my room,
Shouts and moans surround me,
In my stay with suffering

Yesterday smile agonizes in a field of lies.
It is a long long way,
And I am exhausted,
The windows of this world are all closed to me.

The glances evade my wounds,
Dark souls run over again,
And they nail that cross to me,
That mine never will be.

What broke my face
Was the rage without a cause
It was an unfounded hatred,
Was a scar without any pain

Fantasies appear in this tired defect
Life, that with it's surprises
My future ruined
With it's bitter song,
Which freezes my desire to live
A happy and sincere life
Without sweat or tears
Being faithful to my dreams

The sun falls
And the night is strained into my room,
Shouts and moans surround me,
In my stay with suffering

Yesterday smile agonies in a field of lies.
It is a long long way,
And I am exhausted,
The windows of this world are all closed to me.
