Is the deepest moment in life,
It's a hard decision,
I used to rest my soul
In the spirit of darkness

Leave the past,
Open your eyes and see what's around,
Leave the darkness behind,
Find a new reason to live

Please help me,
I feel lost in this land of shadows,
Please understand me,
I feel alone without your arms

You can save yourself
Please help me
You don't need me
I do need you
All you need is to believe in yourself
Please help me, I do need you

I try but I can't leave this,
Is my cross and my curse,
I need a light to find a escape

You can save yourself
Please help me
You don't need me
I do need you
All you need is to believe in yourself
Please help me, I do need you

I need to burn the feelings,
They made me loose,
I need to fly with your wings,
Cause mine are broken.

I try but I can't leave this,
Is my cross and my curse,
I need a light to find a escape

I need to fly with your wings,
Cause mine are broken

I need to go
