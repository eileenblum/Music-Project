And then I saw another beast burning from the earth
With two horns, just like lamb
But it spoke like the monster
It uses the power of the first beast
and is completely on its service
It has the tip that the earth and its people
worship the first beast which deadly wound has healed
It makes wonderful illusions
Even make the fire go down from the sky to earth in everyone's presence
[Book of Revelations, revelation 13]

[Beast:]
With my power I embrace you,
I'll tear apart my enemies,
With the powerful thunder of my voice,
A casting spell that will hunt you.
Your souls are now mine like the flight of the crow,
Searching in silence through the whispering forest,
Burning the distend leaves on his way,
I'm the shadow that you can not see,
And my eyes will dissolve your reflection,
Because now you belong to me.
Everything you are
And what's around you,
I'm the rising moon
Lighting your path
To misery.
It is my will,
Rising my sorcerers illusions,
You are destined to remain
In this rotten earth,
The land there I give you
