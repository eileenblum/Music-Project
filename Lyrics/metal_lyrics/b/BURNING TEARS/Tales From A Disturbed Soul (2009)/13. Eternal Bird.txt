My body is so tired,
I'm a wounded eagle in a wonderful flight,
Wings of fragile feathers resist the gale

The penetrating winds of the mountains
Freezes my tears
And among crystals of temperance,
I discard all my doubts

I'm an eternal bird,
I deny all fears,
I scream my torture to the infinite
And my own thought have left me deaf

In the cooling of the white cloud,
In a delirious sign,
The eternal horizon guards me
And the time no longer exists

I'm an eternal bird,
I deny all fears,
I scream my torture to the infinite
And my own thought have left me deaf
