Subtract seconds from pain
'Cause time parts from my eyes
Feel yourself free and despise
That solitary heart

Loose the chains
They hurt your wrists
Full of dust
As hate inside your head

Come back and smile for me,
(And the sun will born again)
I'll bring you the moon tonight,
To let you path of darkness shine

Give time to forgetfulness
Remember thereâs a future to come
Or else past will return
To loose all itâs rage among you

Come back and smile for me,
(And the sun will born again)
I'll bring you the moon tonight,
To let you path of darkness shine

Subtract seconds from pain
'Cause time parts from my eyes
Feel yourself free and despise
That solitary heart
