Lost in this infinite labyrinth,
I see a face in the dark of the shadows,
Is the enemy within my mind,
The one that tortures me until I die,

And then it comes to me and I run,
But in this place there's no place to hide,
I'm scared about what he can say,
Then he smiles... he smiles

Your misery put a chain on you,
And your speech damned you,
The shadows devours you,
And your conscience rips open the iron of your chest,
The one who feeds the shame
Of the people who use to believe in you

Now I can't face my own reality,
I don't need those words, don't you see?
Why don't you realize,
That I'm not alone in this land.
