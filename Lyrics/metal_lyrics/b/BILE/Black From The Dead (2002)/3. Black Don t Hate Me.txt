Iâm just a hybrid of something morbid.
Take what it wants, it will stick you in the ass.
I am invalid, so fucking rigid.
Viciously rabid, foaming at the mouth.
Iâm smelling rancid, but I feel splendid.
But me, Iâm solid.
Chew and swallow me.
I am like acid
I see youâre placid.
Good thing youâre frigid.
Iâll break you into two.
Donât hate me because Iâm beautiful,
Donât hate me because Iâm right.
Hate me because Iâm better than you,
As you stumble home tonight.
Donât hate me because Iâm beautiful,
Donât hate me because Iâm right.
Hate me because Iâm better than you,
As you start another fight.
Youâre just a porker. [?]
Too busy walker. [?]
A childish bastard,
Begging change from me.
Youâre not a leader.
A blown out speaker.
A bullshit preacher.
Got no time for me.
A bad school-mate.
Could be all nitrate. [?]
It makes me vibrate,
Like you could never do.
But you inject me.
Youâll never be late.
Come do my prostate,
And lubricate myâ¦
Donât hate me because Iâm beautiful,
Donât hate me because Iâm right.
Hate me because Iâm better than you,
As you stumble home tonight.
Donât hate me because Iâm beautiful,
Donât hate me because Iâm right.
Hate me because Iâm better than you,
As you start another fight.
Itâs like a drug.
It transforms me.
Itâs like a drug.
It uses me.
Donât hate me because Iâm beautiful,
Donât hate me because Iâm right.
Hate me because Iâm better than you,
As you stumble home tonight.
Donât hate me because Iâm beautiful,
Donât hate me because Iâm right.
Hate me because Iâm better than you,
As you start another fight.
Donât hate me.
Eat yourself.
