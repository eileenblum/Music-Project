Ainât it strange?
You walk around behind my back playing all your games.
Donât think Iâm not wise.
I can see through your disguise.
Ainât it a shame?
All your excuses are selling the same.
Maybe in time one day youâll finally realize all my pain.
Never before and never again.
I donât think that weâll ever be friends.
Never before and never again, itâs the end.
I know youâre not the only one Iâll never comprehend.
Fine, go behind my back and sleep with all my friends.
Donât think Iâm not wise.
Iâll see through your disguise (disguise).
So whoâs to blame for all the times youâve lied and sweared upon your motherâs grave?
Ainât it a shame every time you bark, my own sounds the same? [?]
Never before and never again.
I donât think that weâll ever be friends.
Never before and never again, itâs the end.
It wasnât just sex to me.
I thought it was something more.
A real ride with ecstasy [?]
And I find out that you are just a whore.
Youâre just a whore.
Never before and never again.
I donât think that weâll ever be friends.
Never before and never again, itâs the end.
Never before and never again.
Walk around behind my back and sleep with all my friends.
Never will we be friends, âcause itâs the end.
