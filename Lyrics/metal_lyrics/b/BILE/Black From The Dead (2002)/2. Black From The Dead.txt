Heâs killed once heâll kill again.
Heâll kill âtill everything thatâs yours is his.
Heâll kill your reason, heâll kill your pride.
With a big fat smile when you finally die.
Dark and dreary and terribly dead,
Walking into heaven without a head.
Heâs killed once heâll kill again.
Heâs killed each and every one of your friends.
Heâs killed your pets, heâs killed your wife.
Heâs taken every important part of your life.
Dark and dreary and terribly dead,
Walking into heaven without a head.
Black, black, black from the dead. [x4]
Black, black, black from the dead. [x14]
