Creep.
She wants the needles removed from under her skin
She wants to feel like theyâve never been in
When she smiles, they just go deeper within
Shooting venom and poisons and beautiful toxins
It's a mystery, so much misery
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Super hard-core, sheâs a porno queen
Sheâs in denial of her romantic curse
The closer you get to her the stronger it hurts
So many zombies, so deep in her trance
Itâs so fucking easy when theyâre all trying to get in her pants
It's a mystery, so much misery
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Super hard-core, sheâs a porno queen
Ra-ra-ra, sis boom bah, such an evil bitch, la la la la.
Half baked, earthquake nine point nine
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Super hard-core, sheâs a porno queen
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Super hard-core, sheâs a porno queen
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Super hard-core, sheâs a porno queen
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Sheâs a creep, a creeper, a creeping machine.
Super hard-core, and twice as mean
