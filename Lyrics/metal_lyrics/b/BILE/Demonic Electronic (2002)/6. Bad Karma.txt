I'm the itch in your ear
The involuntary tear
I'm the chill you get
When no one is near
Smell of blood between your thighs
I'm the Rorschach telling lies
When you get your test results
I'm the fear that's in your eyes

Everything that you do will always come back to you
Everyone that you do will always come back to you
Everyone that you knew will always come back to you
Everyone that you blew will always be part of you

Why're you such an asshole?
You're such a fucking asshole
Your blackened heart and your soul
Why're you such an asshole?
You're such a fucking asshole
Your attitude is so cold

BAD KARMA

A smile from a whore
While they're tempting you to score
That feeling in your gut
That makes you go get more
The gore without the scare
The race your really are
The nothing you have done
To show just who you are

I'm the smoke inside your lungs
I'm the guilt when you are done
I'll be the last thing on this Earth when you try to have a little fun
I'm the blood pumping through your vein
I'm the vomit on your brain
Even is disdain
Can't have no war without the pain

Everything that you do will always come back to you
Everyone that you do will always come back to you
Everyone that you knew will always come back to you
Everyone that you blew will always be part of you

Why're you such an asshole?
You're such a fucking asshole
Your attitude is so cold

BAD KARMA

Why're you such an asshole?
You're such a fucking asshole
Your blackened heart and your soul

BAD KARMA

I'm the voice in the back of your head
Pushing you to your little self destruction
Makeshift suction
Commercial seduction
Light-wave reduction
Make you fucking serve my kind
A bad world

Why're you such an asshole?
You're such a fucking asshole
Your attitude is so cold

BAD KARMA

Why're you such an asshole?
You're such a fucking asshole

BAD KARMA
