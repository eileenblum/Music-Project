RED, RED
Red is the color in my head
RED, RED
Red is all I see
DEAD, DEAD
Hate yourself for who you're not
FIRE, DESIRE
Jesus was your father

Is dead is done
Rotten fruit of Satan
Is dead is demon
In the shadows, we are legion

HEAD, HEAD
The hand of God touches my head
DEAD, DEAD
Follows me in my car
He's a nut for fairy tails
His dad alone must make us dead
FIRE, DESIRE
Makes us who we are

Is dead is done
Rotten fruit of Satan
Is dead is demon
In the shadows, we are legion

You're dead
You're demon
In the shadows, we are legion

We are legion
