Depression sets in
My world is dim
Depression sets in
Taken me in

I am so low
I am at a low
I'm beneath the hopes and dreams of everything I know
I see the road to nowhere, it's tattooed in my brin
I'm spitting chunks of bile because I'm insane

TEKNOWHORE

Depression is in
Post-life is grim
Depression is in
Taken me in

I am so low
I am at a low
I'm beneath the hopes and dreams of everything I know
I see the road to nowhere, I've seen it in my brain
What I want and what I am will never be the same
