You say Iâm not good enough for you
But then you say Iâm not good enough for anyone but you
You say you just have to be left alone -- so now you're alone
So you curse me and hit me and you claw me until I bleed
Then you want, and you want, and your want turns into need

Submission is free, itâs just what we need
When I talk, you'd better listen to me

Wake up, to me you're just slaves
Now here's a treat so you'll behave

So I grab you by the back of your mane
You say itâs not good without a little bit of pain
You say I do nothing but hurt -- Iâll show you hurt
So you curse, you curse, you hit, you hit and you claw me until I bleed
Then you want, and you want, and your want turns into need

Submission is free, itâs just what we need
When I talk, you better listen to me

Wake up, to me you're just slaves
Now here's a treat so you'll behave
