Wanna take the pain away
Today after school?
Tie me to the table in your basement
It'll be so cool

I have nothing in my mind
And I'm a big fucking waste of time
Push your weed away
I've thought about this moment everything single day

It's time you brought me down
To woo my constant frown
So cut away my pain
And use my corpse for your little games

Do doo doo, do doo doo
JERK

Start with something fun like a baseball bat
And beat me hard in the chest
Make slices and incisions everywhere
Mmmm, I think I like that the best

Watch my blood starts to flow
And video-tape my show
Fist fuck me, I'm your whore
Saw through my bone, right too my core

What a viscous final ride
Now I can die with pride
Chop my head right off of me
Hold it up so I can see all the beautiful work you've done to me

I want this done to me

JERK

I want this done to me
So we all can see
What is really me
Yes this is really me

JERK

Do doo doo, do doo doo

I want this done to me
Please, PLEASE
