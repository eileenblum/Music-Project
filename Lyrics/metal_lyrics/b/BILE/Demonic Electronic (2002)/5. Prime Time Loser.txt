Not liked and not wanted
Not needed, don't flaunt it
Not cool or down with it
Loser, just stay seated

NO ONE
Gives a damn about you
NO ONE
Cares any less what you do
NO ONE
Wants to feel what you feel
Because what you feel is not real

You feel nothing
For this golden future
Because you're a prime time loser

HATED

Not liked in all aspects
Not cool in your backseat
Not liked in all your minds
Loser, you are my kind

NO ONE
Gives a damn about you
NO ONE
Cares any less what you do
NO ONE
Wants to feel what you feel
Because what you feel is not real

You feel nothing
For this golden future
Because you're a prime time loser

HATED

Are you so hardcore?
Do you know who you are?

Live how they want you to live
Die once you're told to die
Love who they want you to love
Die when you're told to die
