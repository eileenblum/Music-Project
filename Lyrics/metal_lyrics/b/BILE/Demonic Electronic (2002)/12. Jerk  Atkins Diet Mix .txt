SNAP BACK TO LIFE
Oh yea, plant your knees right here
Yea that's right and there ain't nothing we can say about it, you fucking cunt

I am faster and to me I'm soul drained
Knockin' down towers like the wrath of a hurricane
Beaten the odds in a sea of black life
I fucked her little tits and made her my good wife

When I turn, if I turn
When's it gonna be my turn to burn?
'cause I sucked in air and I yelled out loud
I punched a toothless mother fucker right in the gray glove

It's compound pressure
it is our power
They devour

I headed over to the corner
I see the junkies on the street
The pisses ran and fell at my feel
I watched five boys play with knives
As I approached they poked out thier eyes
There in the corner, the tears on her face
Clutching her arms around her in disgrace
A user of needles and the witless skin head
Light, dark, it doesn't matter

It's compound pressure
it is our power
They devour

YOU AIN'T NOTHIN'
