I can talk and talk and talk
You wont listen to what I say
I could scream 1,000 screams
You'll always find a way

You are stuck in a little world
Closed mind to your fate
The more and more you look at me
The more and more I hate

NO, I DON'T KNOW
I ain't body-snatched

Feel a little love
Feel a little hate
I can't decide
Which one to take

Things you do
They drive me up the wall
You do them to dig into
Hoping I will fall

Well I've got some advice for you
So as not to waste your time
I'm coming to a boil
And vengeance will be mine

NO, I DON'T KNOW
I ain't body-snatched

Feel a little love
Feel a little hate
I can't decide
Which one to take

NO, I DON'T KNOW

Feel a little love
Feel a little hate
I can't decide
Which one to take

Feel a little lust
Feel a little more hate
Turns me around
Brings me to hate
