Voices screaming to reject my will, engulf me, control me, command me to kill. Ripping and
tearing and fucking me to death, raging flame of hate inside, builds with every single breath...
IN FRONT OF ME! BEHIND ME! INSIDE ME! SURROUNDS ME! GET OUT! Constant vibrations, twist through
my blood. Thrusting me forward to what I've come to love. I'm getting beat with my own brain to
slaughter with a smile, my ears bleed, my eyes cross, I'm drowning in my own BILE... IN FRONT OF
ME! BEHIND ME! INSIDE ME! SURROUNDS ME! GET OUT! VANISH!
