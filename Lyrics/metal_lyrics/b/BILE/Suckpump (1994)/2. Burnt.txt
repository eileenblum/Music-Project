BURN! BURN! I just burn! Minds to open, things to learn. My dead brain is my concern. So leave
me be and let me burn! BURN! BURN! BURN! BURN! That's my fate! Let my lungs evacuate! Feel no
love, feeling hate, feel no urge to contemplate. BURN! BURN! THAT'S MY FATE! Peering through
these eyes of red, feeling high, feeling dead. BURN! BURN! For you and me, all alone and my
T.H.C. Burning all my time away, always got too much to say. Burning all my time away, always
got too much to say. Burning all my time away, Save it for another day. BURN! BURN! THAT'S MY
FATE!
