As I bake in this rancid oven that we call earth, hard to breathe through filth and muck that
rides our air. All I taste, the bile phlegm collects within. Feeling like shit, again, again,
again, again! URA FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE NOTHING! Never rise, stuck within the depths of
which I dwell. No way out, feel I'll meet my maker soon. I'm just waiting to die and take a
different form. I am cold, smiling as hate keeps burning my soul. URA FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE
NOTHING! You're a fucking loser! That's all that you'll be. You're just a fucking loser! No, not
me! URA FUCKING LOSER AND YOU ARE NOTHING! FUCK OFF YOU AIN'T SHIT!
