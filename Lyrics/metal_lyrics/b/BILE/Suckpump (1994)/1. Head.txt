Screaming in horror, deafening in hate. Bleeding with fear, writhing in pain. Retribution.
Vindication. MY BRAIN IS POUNDING! MY BRAIN IS POUNDING! MY BRAIN IS POUNDING! MY BRAIN! Dying
slow, wash away my thoughts. Flying low, evil in its force. Screaming in pain, screaming in
pain, screaming in pain, scream! MY BRAIN IS POUNDING! MY BRAIN IS POUNDING! MY BRAIN IS
POUNDING! MY BRAIN IS POUNDING! Let me out! Let me in! Let me out! Let me in! I want in! Cancer
eating, cancer feeding, cancer eaten! Vindication! Feeling so old, retribution untold. SCREAMING
IN PAIN! SCREAMING IN PAIN! SCREAMING IN PAIN! SCREAMING IN PAIN! My brain is pounding! Mass
redemption, hate obsession. Monstrous, distort in fear. Ostracize with staring eyes, Right this
wrong until it's near. SHUDDERING IN DISGUST! No love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no
love...... POUNDING! POUNDING! POUNDING! NO LOVE!
