You love her,
And she loves him,
And he loves somebody else,
You just can't win.
And so it goes,
Until the day has died.
This thing they call love,
Is gonna make you cry
I've been through diamonds,
I've been through minks,
I've been through it all,
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
Two by two, and side by side.
Love's gonna find you, yes it is,
You just can't hide.
You'll hear it call,
Your heart will fall,
Then love will fly,
It's gonna soar.
I've had the blues, the reds, and the pinks.
One thingâs for sure, love stinks.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
I donât care about that Casanova thing
All I can say is, love stinks
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
(Love stinks) Love stinks, yeah, yeah.
