You donât turn me on anymore.
As a matter of fact, you've become a bore.
You say you know what is best for me.
You canât even figure out what sets me free.
The ways about you, the ways bore you.
The ways about you, the ways bore you.
One thing doesn't make it right.
Want will flow like wine tonight.
Love doesn't make it alright.
How can we love when youâre always right?
The ways about you, the ways bore you.
It's always about you, it's always for you.
[unintelligible]
The ways about you, the ways bore you.
It's always about you, it's always for you.
Always comes back to âcause youâre in love with you.
