You say Iâm not good enough for you.
And then you say Iâm not good enough for anyone but you.
You say you just have to be left alone (so now youâre alone.)
So you curse me, and hit me, and you claw me until I bleed.
Then you want me, and you want me, and your want turns into need.
Submission is free, itâs just what we need.
When I talk, you better listen to me.
Submission is free, itâs just what we need.
When I talk, you better listen to me.
So I grab you by the back of your mane.
You say, "itâs no good without a little bit of pain."
You say I do nothing but hurt (Iâll show you hurt.)
So you curse me, and hit me, and you claw me until I bleed.
Then you want me, oh and you want me, and your want turns into need.
Submission is free, itâs just what we need.
When I talk, you better listen to me.
Submission is free, itâs just what we need.
When I talk, you better listen to me.
Submission is free, itâs just what we need.
When I talk, you better listen to me.

When I talk, you better listen to me.
Submission is free, itâs just what we need.
When I talk, you better listen to me.
Submission is free, itâs just what we need.
When I talk, you better listen, better fucking listen to me.
Listen to me.
Wake up, to me you're all just slaves.
Now hereâs a treat so you will behave.
Wake up, to me you're all just slaves.
Now hereâs a treat so you will behave.
Wake up, to me you're all just slaves.
Now hereâs a treat so you will behave.
Wake up, to me you're all just slaves.
Now hereâs a treat so you will behave.
Wake up, to me you're all just slaves.
