How do we get out, from all we put out?
The feelings are let out, and we give our best out.
When it becomes put on, all you do is look on.
You can't put your shoes on; convenience is pulling you down.
How do we get out of this filthy bed I've made?
It's long and it's overdue, no matter what I've said.
And suddenly, it comes to me, through all the pain and the misery.
All I ever wanted was you here with me.
I'm not the only victim of stubborn, foolish pride.
I'm not the only one who has something bare to hide.
And suddenly, it comes to me, through all the lies and the misery.
All I ever wanted was you here with me.
And suddenly, I realize, all I ever, ever needed was you here with me, you here with me.
I'm not the only victim of stubborn, foolish pride.
I'm not the only one who has something bare to hide.
How do we get out...
