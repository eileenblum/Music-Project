Depression sets in, my world is grim. Depression is in, post life is dim. I am so low. I am at a low. I'm beneath the hopes and 
dreams of everything I know. I see the road to nowhere, it's tattooed in my brain. I'm spitting chunks of BILE, that's drowning me 
insane! TEKNOWHORE! Depression is in, my world is grim. Depression is in, it's taken me in. I am so low. I am at a low. I'm 
beneath the hopes and dreams of everything I know. I've seen the road to nowhere, I've seen it in my brain. What I want and 
what I am, will never be the same! TEKNOWHORE!
