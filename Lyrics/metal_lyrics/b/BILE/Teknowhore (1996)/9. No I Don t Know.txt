I can talk and talk and talk, you don't listen to what I say. I can scream one thousand screams, you always cry, "No way!" You are 
stuck in a little world, a closed mind, your fate. The more and more you look at me, the more and more I hate. NO I DON'T NO! 
Things you do drive me up the wall, you do them to dig into me, hoping I will fall. Well I have some advice for you, so as not to 
waste your time. I'm coming to a boil and vengeance will be mine. NO I DON'T NO! Feelings of love, feelings of hate, I can't decide 
which one to take.
