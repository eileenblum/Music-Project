Pain in my eyes, in my head, in my soul. Pain for the way that you take control. Pain for the way that your kissing my skin. Pain is 
the key that will let you in. Pain is the feeling that's never subsiding. Pain is the word that the whole world is fighting. Pain keeps on 
growing 'cause you are all lying. Pain is my friend now that everyone's dying. Pain on my hands. Pain on my feet. Smile on my 
face. Death so sweet. A habit of fear. A habit fear. Fear is here in my habitual sphere. Begin the mutation to a castrated witch. 
Implode through my arteries, slice off that bitch. I will be strong yet body so weak. Through death I live, true death I seek. A habit 
of fear. A habit of fear. Fear is here in my habitual sphere. Fear is here in my habitual sphere.
