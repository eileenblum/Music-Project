All of them are losers! All of them are fake! All of them are demons! All of them just take! All of them are two-faced! All of them 
just speak! So wrapped up in their own lies they don't see themselves so weak! NO ONE I CALL FRIEND! You are not my friend! All 
of them are pathetic! All of them are shit! All of them aren't worthy! They're not worth my spit! All of you are victims! All of them 
are thieves! Consume, devour and fuck themselves just like a piece of meat! NO ONE I CALL FRIEND! You are not my friend! 
You're all fucking losers! Left you all behind. I took some time to realize, you are not my kind. All of you are gluttons! All of you 
are mutts! Flap around in your own BILE, you fat, fucking sluts! NO ONE I CALL FRIEND! You are not my friend! You are not my 
friend!
