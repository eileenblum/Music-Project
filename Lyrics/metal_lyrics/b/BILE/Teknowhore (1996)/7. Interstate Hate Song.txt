I'm drinking the chalice, that is filled with BILE. There is no love, just hatred, bleed with a smile. A slit wrist, a big kiss, send you on 
your way. Come down here with me, and blacken my day. They've already killed you, you can't be alive. There is no 
indestructible, no one survives! They've already killed you, you are not alive! You are not alive! No one survives! Disagreement, 
argument, judgement, then war! Peaceful harmony - these things I abhore! A bonfire, a bullet, burnt at the stake. I hate you, I 
hate you, I hate you! I HATE!
