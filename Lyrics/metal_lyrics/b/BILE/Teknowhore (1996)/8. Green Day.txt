Toxins in the airways, venom for all to taste. A death grip love for my remote, spewing blood, shit and paste. Help me take my 
medicine, so the pain will go away. I'm all fucked up on valium, I can't move my lips to say - The world is so beautiful, 
everything's O.K. The world is so beautiful, what the fuck day is it today? It's a green day you dumb fuck!
