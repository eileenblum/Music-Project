You are my life, my phantom god. You've got all I desire. You're not me, that's the strongest point of you. Abnormal lust, infects 
my blood. You are all I admire. I am the lowest form of you. Piss all over me, I piss all over you. Despise my life, 'cause I'm not 
you. I know that I'm a liar. I am the lowest form of you. I beat myself for you. I give myself for you. I'll do anything to, anything 
to meet you. I'll lose myself for you. I end myself for you. I'll do anything to, anything to make you...piss all over me. I am the 
lowest form of you.
