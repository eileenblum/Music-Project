Cheat, lied, stole from your friends

I am not the only one, I've been killing you for fun

Degenerate, exterminate, imaged to fools disgrace
Human face, human race, you are God's biggest mistake

Social, inept, fortified, no matter how much filth we buy
Now their fees come down in price, for the cause I sacrifice
Little girls, little boys, inexpensive little toy

Degenerate, exterminate, imaged to fools disgrace
Human face, human race, you are God's biggest mistake

Dire critical
The part of you I never knew
Dire critical
Don't tell me that you're blind
Don't tell me you can't see
This fucked up shit in front of you
It's not in front of me
I don't care

Human face, human race, you are God's biggest mistake
Exterminate the human race, you are God's biggest mistake
