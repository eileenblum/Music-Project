Why can't you speak, we can be one
You feel deep inside me, like I have done
Do I want you? 'cause you wont change
And you will cause me to stay, the same

Rubber love, rubber glove, mechanical love, with a latex heart

You made me want you, and you can tell
Now that you have all that you wanted you can tell
Did you want me?Â  So you can change
'cause now that I've got you, I don't feel the same

Rubber love, rubber glove, mechanical love, with a latex heart

No conscience, no shame, no guilt
Play the game

My rubber glove, my rubber love, my rubber has no guilt
My rubber glove, my rubber love, my rubber has no shame
My rubber glove, my rubber love, my rubber has no guilt
My rubber glove, my rubber love, my rubber has no blame
My rubber glove, my rubber love, my rubber has no regret
My rubber glove, my rubber love, my rubber has no name
