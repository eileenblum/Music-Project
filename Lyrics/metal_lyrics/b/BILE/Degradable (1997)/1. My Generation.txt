[originally by The Who]People try to put us down
Because they think we get around
Things I do look awful cold
I know I'll die before I get old

It's my generation

Why don't you -- HATE ME
Don't try to dig what we are
No, not going to conquer me (hate you)
Talkin' about my generation

It's my generation.

I know I'll die before I get
I hope I'll die before I get
I will die before you
Old
