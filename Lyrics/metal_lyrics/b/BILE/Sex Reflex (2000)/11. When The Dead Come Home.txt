Interception, contortion, domineering, ignoring, Cancellation of frustration. far cry from realization, between suffocation's mind. 
Dulling lies, there is no alive, WHEN THE DEAD COME HOME everyone smiles, when they're dead. Psychology of fear, the agony 
and ecstasy makes death stomp and cheer, it's taunting me, it's taunting me. Argument, indecision, false pleasure is all that your 
given, it's what you're living. There is no alive, WHEN THE DEAD COME HOME everyone smiles, when they're dead. If your fucking 
with the demons on the slimy side of town, you've got to keep low down and try not to make a sound. If they catch you with a 
razor and you're trying to slit your wrists, you'd better make sure it's worth it before you take on that bitch. There is no alive, 
WHEN THE DEAD COME HOME everyone smiles, when they're dead. There is no alive, WHEN THE DEAD COME HOME everyone 
smiles, when they're dead. When the dead come home.
