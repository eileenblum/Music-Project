A wang, dang, dang and a double fang, put you six feet underground. Flush all the fashion and your old school passion, our world 
lives underground. Living for the money, so dead fuckin' funny, with your three piece suit and your wife that calls you honey. 
You're raw meat, now ain't that sweet? Our world lives underground, SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! You're 
my bitch, now do what you're told to do. SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! Get down on your knees and 
thank me. Vampire folklore old stone age, hypodermic wet dream narcotic stage, an undead anthem to the blackest days, a tribute 
to the original. SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! You're my bitch now do what you're told to do. SHUT THE 
FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! Get down on your knees and thank me. SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE 
SPOKEN TO! You're my bitch, now do what you're told to do. SHUT THE FUCK UP, SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO! Get down, lick 
my boot and thank me. I was taken on a Tuesday night, a summer's night, around midnight. Blood flows silently to candlelight, yet 
I re-animate in shadows. Purveyor of the horror, tormentor in techicolor, governor to the terror but still I'm trapped in limbo.
