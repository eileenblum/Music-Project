Lost-lost-lost, finding nothing. Lost-lost-lost, finding nothing. Am I destined to reap what I have taken? Temptress to drag down, 
down, down, down. Cheat, lied, stole from your friends. Cheat, lied, stole from your friends. Cheat, lied, stole from your friends. 
Lost-lost-lost, finding nothing. Lost-lost-lost finding nothing. Not worth the dirt, not worth the dirt I step in. Not worth the dirt, not 
worth the shit I step in. This is what you've made me, they're all out to get me. The others before me, there is no me, this is who I 
am. Sunny days and happy trails, blizzard baths and slicing rails. Coughing fit and untrue grit, pack up all my shit and split. I seek 
revenge, never again, never again, can we be friends? I seek revenge, never again, never again, can we be friends? This is who I 
am.
