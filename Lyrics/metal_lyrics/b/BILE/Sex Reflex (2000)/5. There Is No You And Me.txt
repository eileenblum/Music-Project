What I'm gonna be, has nothing to do you see, with anything of you and me, there is no you and me, no you and me. You pushed 
me to the limit, tried to take what I've got, watch me take away what I gave you, you'll see what you have is not. You love your 
torments, think you're above all around, well how does it feel when I go up and you are dropping down? What I'm gonna be, has 
nothing to do you see, with anything of you and me, there is no you and me. You pushed me passed the limit, you take not. 
Nothing that I want that I gave you, you were just a prop. Push aside your remnants, downplay you all around, well how does it 
feel when I go up and you are dropping down..down.. down.. down... down......What I'm gonna be, has nothing to do you see, with 
anything of you and me. THERE IS NO YOU AND ME.
