Pretty boy with a gun, bang- bang, fun- fun. Pretty girl with a knife, watch your back it's your wife! Heroin, load my blood, shoot- 
shoot, fun- fun. Pretty girl on ecstasy, now she wants to fuck me. We are the dead, we are in league, we are the doctors of low self 
esteem. We do it wrong, we don't believe, we are the congress of the new disease. Pretty thing with no head, that's OK, better off 
dead! Warm blood everywhere, shave off all my hair! Pretty girl, what's she worth? Stick it where it really hurts! Government 
experiment, welcome to my accident. We are the dead, we are in league, we are the doctors of low self esteem. We do it wrong, 
we don't believe, we are the congress of the new disease. We are the dead, we are in league, we are the doctors of low self 
esteem. We do it wrong, and we have no fear, we are the anti of all you hold dear. Social disease, down on your knees. Covered 
in fleas, give me a freeze. I am a clown, I am disgrace. It's always thrown up in my face. Through ignorance, I always fight. Better 
face it, I'm always right. We are the dead, we are in league, we are the doctors of low self esteem. We do it wrong, we don't 
believe, we are the congress of the new disease...
