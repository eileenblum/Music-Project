Again I'm stranded here
The coldest place in the universe is mine
Nightmares forewarn, the danger I fear

It's blinding the sun creating no shelter
With fire and storm the final judgement arrives
In grief it comes to make you see

[Chorus I:]
ITS RISE IN A MOMENT OF VIOLENCE
BORN IN A TRAGICAL WORLD
TURNING THE DAYS INTO DARKNESS

THE SPARK OF IGNITION

The light growing fainter squeezed in the dark
Into the space which no one can define
One wrong decision could lead us astray

For ever and ever we exist
When we unite our dust will always remain
Before the light, the shadow returns

[Chorus II:]
ITS RISE IN A MOMENT OF VIOLENCE
BORN IN A TRAGICAL WORLD
BURNING THE STARS INTO DARKNESS

THE SPARK OF IGNITION
THE SPARK OF IGNITION
THE SPARK OF IGNITION
THE SPARK OF IGNITION

[Midpart / solo]

[Chorus II]
