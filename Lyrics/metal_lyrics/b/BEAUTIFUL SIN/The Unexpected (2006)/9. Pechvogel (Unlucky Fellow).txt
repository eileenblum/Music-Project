I woke up on a terrible morning
I should have known 'cause it came with a warning
Switched on the radio and that's what I've heard:
"Watch out for an aggressive bird"

Attacking people on the "B55"
I just woke up like my dog, that's my life
Forgot about the importance of news
So I just gave a shit and I tied my shoes

Finally up, I made my routine
I took my bike and I wiped it clean
Drove my cycle out of the night
Down the alley whee the trees stand tight

[Chorus I:]
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU BUT IT HAPPENED TO ME
IT COULD HAPPEN TO EVERYONE... EVENTUALLY
I'M A PECHVOGEL, I'M NOT A THE LUCKY ONE
P... P... PECHVOGEL

I said to myself: "Oh what a nice day"
I can assure you that thought passed away
Cause nevertheless a noise came closer
I turned pale and I thought "oh no sir!"

I had a look, but it wasn't the bike
It was the buzzard ready to strike
Straight like an arrow he busted my neck
The roaring bird in his frontal attack

[Chorus II:]
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU BUT IT HAPPENED TO ME
IT COULD HAPPEN TO EVERYONE... EVENTUALLY
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU IT COULD HAPPEN TO ME
IT COULD HAPPEN TO EVERYONE... EVENTUALLY

And again it was me
Unlucky fellow...
All my life was full of nightmares...
Over and over again...
Unlucky fellow

I lost control and it fell on the ground
My knees were bleeding and my keys never found

"I'm not the lucky one"

[Chorus II:]

WATCH OUT ! I'M A PECHVOGEL... P... P... PECHVOGEL
P... P... P... P... PECHVOGEL !!  OH NO SIR !!!
