All your life is just a disguise
All you gave, a thousand lies
I know hate's no clue
Don't want to stay where there's no answer

With myself I'm in disgrace
But I was pushed into this maze
Oh my thoughts are new
Now I am sure to remember

I'm wasting my time to wait for solutions
I seek out the sun, a ray of light to clear my way

[Chorus:]
THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL DREAM
WE ALL DRIFT WITH THE POWERFUL STREAM
FINDING A WAY TO ESCAPE INTO ANOTHER WORLD

Here I am, my soul has grown
I've learned from everything I've done
Yeah now my love is true
I know it will stay forever

And all my life was built on illusions
I seek out the sun, a ray of light crossed my way

[Chorus]

[Midpart / solo]

Spent all my life to wait for solutions
I seek out the sun, a ray of light to clear my way

I've found a guide through my own emotions
A field of light, my new horizon

THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL DREAM
WE ALL DRIFT WITH THE POWERFUL STREAM
TRYIN' TO ESCAPE INTO ANOTHER WORLD

...This is not the original dream...
