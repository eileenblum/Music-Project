I am not a fiction I cope with the other they are so much weaker they say
Fulfilling my mission there is no premonition I'm massive and blow you away
Strong I am rolling much faster and louder than everything bigger before
You will be a goner and ex-person soon if you try to escape and ignore

[Chorus I:]
CAUSE NOW... NOW... NOW YOU ARE INSIDE OF ME
YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE
CAUSE YOU HEAR THE METALWAVES

I never surrender I creep in your ear and I enter your brain 'till you scream
Inject the infection I crawl in your blood, through your body, within to your dreams

[Chorus II:]
CAUSE NOW... NOW... NOW YOU ARE INSIDE OF ME
YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE

'CAUSE YOU SWIM IN METALWAVES

[Chorus III;]
'CAUSE NOW... NOW... NOW YOU ARE A PART OF ME
YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE
'CAUSE YOU HEAR THE METALWAVES

[Midpart / solo]

[Chorus IV:]
'CAUSE NOW... NOW... NOW YOU ARE A PART OF ME
YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE
'CAUSE YOU SWIM IN METALWAVES

[Chorus I:]
