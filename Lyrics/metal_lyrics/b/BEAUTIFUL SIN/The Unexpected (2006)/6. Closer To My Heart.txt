Nature's beauty grows in sunshine
Magic colours all around
Mysterious painting on a blue sky
That's not everything I found

Hungry hearts and lonely people
Too much anger in our world
I'm against a foolish liar
Who denies the singing bird

[Chorus:]
MOONWALK, BLACK AND WHITE, COME CLOSER TO MY HEART
MOONWALK, THE DISTANCE DISAPPEARS
MOONWALK, NOT FAR FROM HOME, FEELING SO APART
MOONWALK, THE DISTANCE DISAPPEARS

Create a picture while you are sleeping
Awake your fantasy tonight
Another melody can lead you
Hear the music deep inside

[Chorus]

I don't need another preacher
I don't want a new belief
Longing for a free existence
That's not everything I feel
