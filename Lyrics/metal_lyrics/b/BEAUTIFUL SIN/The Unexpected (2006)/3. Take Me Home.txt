We drift through the ages of time
Your flame was held in a secret
Now I am standing alone
Is there space for everyone?
Go through a million illusions
Too long to find resolution
You were not the only one
To be loved and found

[Bridge:]
When I die do I find you in paradise?
All my worries and doubts disappear?

[Chorus:]
TAKE ME HOME TO YOUR MAGIC
I'M READY TO FEEL
DON'T LEAVE ME LONELY AND HELP TO REVEAL
TAKE ME HOME TO YOUR MAGIC
I'M READY TO FEEL

You claimed all the colours in life
So fast you got resurrection
All my memories passing by
Yet before before you said goodbye
I try to discuss with that demon
Why your life was so full of treason
In the end we're all the same
There is no one left to blame

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
DON'T LEAVE ME LONELY AND HELP ME TO SEE
...DON'T LEAVE ME LONELY AND HELP ME TO SEE

[Midpart / solo]

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
DON'T LEAVE ME LONELY AND HELP ME TO SEE
...HOME TO YOUR MAGIC I'M READY TO FEEL
...DON'T LEAVE ME LONELY AND HELP ME TO SEE
...I'M READY TO FEEL
