I see the people int he streets
Dictatorship from the adjusted
In the village and the cities
Do they live with all their lies

Men and women, young and old
In the office and the factories
In the school and in their hoes
Shut their mouth and turn away

[Chorus:]
YOU HAVE TURNED YOUR EYES AWAY
IT WILL CONTINUE DAY BY DAY
GIVE UP, ONCE FOR ALL, IT'S OVER NOW
ALL YOU DID WAS ALWAYS WRONG
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT BEFORE?
GIVE UP, ONCE FOR ALL, IT'S OVER NOW

North and south and east and west
Dictatorship from the adjusted
Moneys vibration and on gene chips
A free commerce dictates their life

The media helps to make them stupid
A strong state helps make them dumb
The people like to be alone
Don't give a shit about the others

[Chorus]

I see the people in the streets
Dictatorship from the adjusted
Millions have been killed by them
Allow  torture, hunger and murder

Poisoning the rivers everywhere
The air the ground and all the seas
Pretend to be not guilty
I have enough of all their lies

[Chorus:]
ALL YOU DID WAS ALWAYS WRONG
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT BEFORE?
GIVE UP, ONCE FOR ALL, IT'S OVER NOW
