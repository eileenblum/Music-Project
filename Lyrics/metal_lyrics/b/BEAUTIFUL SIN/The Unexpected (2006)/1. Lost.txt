In a dream you came along and tugged me in the heat
Although warned by all my friends to stay away from that deceit
Trapped into a fateful web, my instinct couldn't tell
On my own with my decisions, decay into that spell

[Bridge:]
"If I know how to then you go with me"
Both we touch the sky
"For the rest of your life I will follow you"
Both we can't deny

[Chorus:]
LOST... IN A DREAM I FOLLOW
LOST... NEVER TO RETURN
LOST... WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW
HIGH ON EMOTIONS
LOST... IN A WASTE LAND
LOST... WITH A BURNING FEVER
HIGH ON EMOTIONS

Torn with struggle, finding back myself, out of that vicious circle
Set me free I'm drifting on a wave, yeah I'm waiting for a miracle

[Chorus]

[Midpart / solo]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

"If I know how to then you go with me"
What about tomorrow...
It's a whispering in my head...
"For the rest of your life I will follow you"

What about tomorrow...
