It takes too much time
And it seems the world is based on lies
I'm always aware until the last day has arrived

I've opened my eyes
And I saw nothing's as bad as it appears
Just for myself deep inside I've found out

[Chorus:]
'CAUSE I'M REAL
YES I'M REAL, YES I'M REAL

In fact there is more to reveal
But under the surface I scratch and I fear
It's twisting my head but my soul is free to fly

[Chorus]

[Midpart / solo]

REAL... YES, I'M REAL, 'CAUSE I FEEL

REAL... OH I FEEL SO REAL, SO REAL
'CAUSE MY SOUL IS FREE TO FLY...
