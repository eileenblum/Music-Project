This is a periodic tale 
of strength and stainless glory 
at war with time and entropy 
forged from flames to prevail 

Blood-coloured corrosion 
Compounds intrude like a Trojan 

These reactionary elements 
must come to a grinding halt 
Their covert assault 
is a ceaseless imminence 

The united forces of water and air 
infiltrate the army of zinc phosphate to impair 

Resist the rust
Hammerite 
The alkyd arms convert decay 
Hammerite
It shields from harms 

The tables have turned, 
advantage now reversed 

Blood-coloured corrosion 
Compounds intrude like a Trojan 
Now an idle feat 

This is not about metalcore 
Hammerite 
It's all about metalcare 
Hammerite

[A humble attempt to write an epic metal song about rust. The equivalent of watching paint dry...]
