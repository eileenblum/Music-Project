Progress fades 
The end of the line 
A new creed 
Cruelty enshrined 

Infidels and gentiles 
Make bulging graves 
When limbs dissolve 
Stack 'em on piles 

Reason stands trial 
In the new Dark Ages 
And shining bright 
Is Satan's smile 

Kill, maim, and burn 
A bloodgod glorified 
See the smirk of saints 
Dialogue denied 

Pungent fumes 
Scorched earth policy 
Heartless horrors 
Epitome of doom 

Reason stands trial 
In the new Dark Ages 
And shining bright 
Is Satan's smile 

Kill, maim, and burn 
A bloodgod glorified

[The most heinous and the most cruel crimes of which history has record, have been committed under the cover of religion. Crusades, jihads, fanatical sect violence, the inquisition, faith-driven terrorist attacks, countless bloody wars â religion has been spreading dogmas of hatred as well as practicing bigotry, discrimination and judgement since the beginning of mankind.]
