Valar morghulis 
death will come for all 
No craft, no artifice 
can stop the destined pall 

Death brings deliverance 
mercy to the slave 
It restores the balance 
no masters in the grave 

The faceless men 
their names forsaken 
a chthonic cult of assassins 
devoted to death's transformation 

Valar dohaeris 
serve the many-faced god 
Killing as catharsis 
worshiping through blood 
Bestow the gift of death 
a fatal sacrament 
To expel one's breath 
is benevolent 

The faceless men 
their names forsaken 
a chthonic cult of assassins 
devoted to death's transformation 

Valar morghulis 
All men must die 
Valar dohaeris 
All men must serve 

Every death, every cut 
every welling of blood 
is an act of worship 
to Him of Many Faces 

Only death can pay for life.

[Inspired by George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, and the TV series Game of Thrones, in particular the mysterious cult of assassins known as the Faceless Men, who worship Death.]
