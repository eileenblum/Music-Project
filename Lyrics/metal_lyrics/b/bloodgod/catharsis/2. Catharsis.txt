Now, with your eyes adjusted to the dim light in the club 
You perceive the bar, get a drink, check the merch, hope the sound guy will speed up 

This is your life, it's ending one moment at a time 
Pogo, skank, or stage dive â all dancing is sublime 
Circle pit and wall of death, you get knocked off your feet 
The taste of blood and sweat, catharsis is complete 

Ear-splitting and hot as hell 
The toxic waltz is fierce 
Moshing and slamming and breaking necks 
while cries of rage through heavy riffs pierce 

Raise your horns and scream along 
Forget about all daily shit 
Full of adrenaline and testosterone, you're ready to join the pit 

This is your life, it's ending one moment at a time 
Pogo, skank, or stage dive â all dancing is sublime 
Circle pit and wall of death, you get knocked off your feet 
The taste of blood and sweat, catharsis is complete 

Dive in and mosh it up 
Fuck bullies with their flying kicks 
When someone's down you lift him up 
No need for dirty tricks 

This is good clean violent fun 
the best you've ever had 
If you ain't been there, you won't understand 
Bonding by thrashing like mad 

This is your life, it's ending one moment at a time 
Pogo, skank, or stage dive â all dancing is sublime 
Circle pit and wall of death, you get knocked off your feet 
The taste of blood and sweat, catharsis is complete 

This is your life, it's ending one moment at a time 
Pogo, skank, or stage dive â all dancing is sublime 
Circle pit and wall of death, you get knocked off your feet 
The taste of blood and sweat, catharsis is complete

[Entering the mosh pit is good clean violent fun and a great outlet for energetic stress release that may even bring spiritual renewal in the process.]
