When you die I will lay you to rest
I will send you to the reaper with no beating heart inside your chest
Death is real I'm a merchant of pain
Ill drain the life your veins
And I will leave you bloodless

Death is Among Us

I hold my hands at the end of the noose
that carries you to your death
as I steal your last breath

I hope that you find
solace in the fact you left a knife in my back
you left a knife in my back

you fool you let your pride consume you
Now your world comes crashing
down

The bell it tolls for you
indulge yourself in sin
There's nothing you can do
just let the devil in

I haven't felt alive in years
