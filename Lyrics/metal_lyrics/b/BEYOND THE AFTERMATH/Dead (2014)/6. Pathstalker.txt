All I see
are shadows disfigured faces
I'm void of light all the I see is darkness
I'm surrounded by a horde of the faceless
Wearing masks of everyone I know

Is this what you take from me
I'll give you agony
I'll drag you down to my level
I'll make you kiss concrete

Is this what you take from me
I'll give you agony
I'll drag you down to my level
I'll make you kiss concrete

I am the jackal in the skin of man
out for your blood you will die by my hand
I am the jackal in the skin of man
out for your blood you will die by my hand

I have no sympathy for people like you
I have no sympathy for people like you

I have no sympathy for people like you
I have no sympathy for people like you

And when the life leaves your eyes
I'll be the last thing to run through your mind

Laying in darkness ripped the flesh from my face
ripped out my tongue to dispel this putrid taste
I'll drain my veins on the blood I am fed
speaking solely in the tongues of the dead

I'm not the man that I claim to be
living solely on the blood of the deceased
I am the demon running through your head
speaking in the tongues of the dead

Your life flashes before your fucking eyes
