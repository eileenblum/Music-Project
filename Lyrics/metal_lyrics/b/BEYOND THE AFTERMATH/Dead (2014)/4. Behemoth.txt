[feat. Braeden Branch of Serpent Bearer]I swear
that this is the last time
I'll ever fall to the likes of you

Shrouded in shadows
covered in the deepest fog
I lie in wait
and I bide my time

Years in the making
who knows how long I've honed my skill
my only hope is the chance to survive

I have never in my life been a victim
never shown myself to be a fool
its getting harder to breathe on the outside
my life is flashing before my eyes

You're living a lie

I hear the sirens singing
Death knows me by name
Ill make a fool of everyone who came before me
You will know the face of true glory

I will not know defeat
I will not know defeat
I will not know defeat
I will not know defeat

Belie my blade to the mouth of the beast
trying my hardest to quench my thirst
Covered in malice and drenched in despise
Don't fail me now I see the fear in its eyes

I am supremacy
yet there's still no peace for me
And in the end
you'll only be a memory

I cant go on
trapped in my skin
breaking my back
again and again and again

Hanging on by the skin of my teeth
I quench my thirst of my victims blood
