I know your game punk
You prey on others fucking weaker than yourself
come to me and you'll breath your last breath
You show me fear? I show you death.

Inhale fear
Exhale death
You're scum and you thrive on power
I'll show the world you're a fucking coward

Inhale fear
Exhale death
You're scum and you thrive on power
I'll show the world you're a fucking coward

Coward
Coward
Coward
yeah

There's no place for you here you fucking hypocrite
You better pray you hit the ground before your face gets hit
Your fake tough guy act wont fool me
So tell me what its fucking like, to be a piece of shit.

Inhale fear
Exhale death
You are scum, no where to run

Inhale fear
Exhale death
Bitch you're scum, no where to run

You show me fear
Now listen here
You hold your tongue
For death has come
For you
bitch

No mercy for you as you're begging for your life.
