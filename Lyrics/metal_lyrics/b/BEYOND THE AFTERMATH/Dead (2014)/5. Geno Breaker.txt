[feat. Matt Gagnon of Villiska]Decaying flesh and the look of betrayal
All you're innocence I washed away
All you're loved ones cry at your funeral
They will know you by the closed casket

So this is how its going to be
Don't think you ever meant shit to me
Left out to die left out to rot
buried deep beneath the soil and bedrock

As I

walk this path I've laid before me
I am the predator with teeth of mortality
its been this way for as long as I remember
I will not stand for your treachery

Treachery

I wont let
you forget
you're just a parasite
in spite of this state of mind

I wont let
you forget
you're just a parasite
in spite of this state of mind

And in the end when you cant sleep at night
You watch your back cause I'm right by your side

Dragged down against my will
a lowly fucking dirtbag
with the intent to
kill

Loyalty means nothing to you
I know that nothing
will ever change
cause this is what you do

I hope that you know that I will
To never fucking
see you alive

death marks the ones
to take
and ill be coming for you
two faces snake

Did you really think you'd get out alive
I've been waiting for you all this time
nothings really what you see
and at the end I see you;re lying to me

Head racing chest convulsing
Scream till your temples pulsing
my insides fucking churning
bathed in the blood of the innocent burning

Head racing chest convulsing
Scream till your temples pulsing
my insides fucking churning
bathed in the blood of the innocent burning

Treacherous
Despicable fucking
treacherous
Despicable fucking
treacherous
Despicable fucking
treacherous
Despicable fucking
treacherous
