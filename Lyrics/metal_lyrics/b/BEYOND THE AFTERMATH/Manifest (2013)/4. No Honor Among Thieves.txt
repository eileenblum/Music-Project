They call me destroyer
life's a battlefield and you're on the ground
you talk shit
you get hit
you're just a bitch with no reason to be proud
we are everything that you wanted to be
watch your language when you're talking to me
you're fucking fake
OOH
you talk big shit for someone so fucking small
you'd say it to my face if you had any balls
you're the kind of person to go and lie to all your friends
we all know that you have fucked up means to fucked up ends
I'm tired of all your bullshit hope you die I hope you rot
good luck on starting another band while I climb to the top
I'm a fucking warhound you're a stupid fucking kid
quit denying all the shit we know you fucking did
you turn your back on others
the second they are not around
you're lucky someone hasn't just driven you're face into the ground
if it were up to me id rather see you drown
you're a self entitled prick
you're existence makes me sick
and if you were to die today
no one would turn the either way
you're a self entitled prick
you're existence makes me sick
you're a self entitled prick
you're existence makes me sick
I would rather see you drown
