descend to the deepest depths that you can reach
and tell me if you bring back anything you think is real
I never thought that id survive
but in the end I cant agree to this deal
by visions blurred and my mind is weak
but I can make it out on my feet
id say an injury's becoming of me
plus you know I like to see you bleed
your dreams are dead the final phase is complete
don't come to me with fear cause I eat the weak
your final resting place is six feet beneath
I have never seen anything like this
so hellbent on a death wish
bones cracked from the pressure of the weight of the world
broken beaten bloodied corpses decorate this forest
too many to bury and too many to burn
so here I am back again a guilty thorn in my skin
a battle with myself that I cannot win
I'm seeing things that I cannot believe
but here I am fucking accepting defeat
ill fight till I collapse
this weight upon my shoulders will never fucking pass
I will stand my ground never back down
on my fucking deathbed never to found
