This is our first kill
The war has just begun
Now you'll see lots of blood
Crushing - Blasting

No you can not hide away
No you will not stay alive
Now you'll see your own blood
Killing - Screaming

We will not fail
Steel must prevail
We will not fail
Steel must prevail

We're here,
We're proud
All losers they
Shatter by fear
We're loud,
We're mean
We're carving a crimson career

Liars and betrayers are scared
Cause their blood
In the gutter will flow
Brimstone move forward to reign
As we're carving a crimson career

The battle is goes on
The war is not over yet
There is more blood
To be spilled
Burning - Destroying

The wimps can not hide away
No they will not stay alive
Our knives will cut them deep
Exploding - Killing
Heavy metal shall reign
We'll distort your brain

We're here,
We're proud
All losers they
Shatter by fear
We're loud,
We're mean
We're carving a crimson career

Liars and betrayers are scared
Cause their blood
In the gutter will flow
Brimstone move forward to reign
As we're carving a crimson career
