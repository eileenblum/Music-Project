All these fashionschanges passes by
I see them rise and take control
Just to fade out and die
From love to hate and boots of steel
I don't care what you say
I know this magic's for real

The fire the satanic spell
Raging power from the pits of hell
It binds your soul and
there is no return
The tunes of thunder
In your heart forever burn

Times will change
Like summer turns to fall
But metalheads
Can not be stopped
When they once heard the call
No laws can keep
This power chained
Hear the roar as
Heavy metal
Attacks you again

The fire the satanic spell
Raging power from the pits of hell
It binds your soul and
there is no return
The tunes of thunder
In your heart forever

Lightning strikes
An earthquake shakes the ground
As every metalheart
Begins to pound
Like a mighty raven it
Will fly forever
Tunes of thunder
Cracks the sky

The fire the satanic spell
Raging power from the pits of hell
It binds your soul and
there is no return
The tunes of thunder
In your heart forever

Lightning strikes
An earthquake shakes the ground
As every metalheart
Begins to pound
Like a mighty raven it
Will fly forever
Tunes of thunder
Cracks the sky
