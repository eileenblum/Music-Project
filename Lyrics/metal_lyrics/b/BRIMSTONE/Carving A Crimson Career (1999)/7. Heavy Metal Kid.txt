He is back, for the revenge
So cruel and mean
He is a killing machine
Just waiting for his
Pray to show
Hear his call, he will kill
Just for the thrill

He is
The heavy metal kid

Has come win and stand tall
Destroy all the liars
Scream a mighty metal call
To death he will
Defend heavy metal

He is
The heavy metal kid

He is back, with rivets
and chains
So cruel and mean
He's raw and he's bad to the
Bone
In his blood metal still flows

He won't cut his hair again
He won't change his ways at all
You can't put him
Down no more
You'll get what you deserve

He's
The heavy metal kid
