Oceans of sadness
Overflows me
Feels like I'm leashed
And can not move
Depression entering my lungs
And as I choke it graps my soul
It feels like I am dead
But I am still alive
Will I ever wake up
From my dreams
To see the moon again

Rain from the darkened
Autumn skies
And I watch october rise
And it fills my heart with pain
Yet, I greet this
Mournful autumn

Autumn
I fade away
Autumn
See it all turn pale

Coming to take me away
It's the autumn
It feels like I am dead
But I am still alive
Will I ever wake up
From my dreams
To see the real world again

Rain from the darkened
Autumn skies
And I watch october rise
and it fills my heart with pain
Yet, I greet this
Mournful autumn

Autumn
You fade away
Autumn
See it all turn pale
