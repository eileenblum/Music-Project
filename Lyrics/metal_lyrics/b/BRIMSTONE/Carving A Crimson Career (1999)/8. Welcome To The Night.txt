Welcome to the night

Now when the moon is full
It's getting late
It's time for bed, you
Better sleep
Inside your head the nightmare is true
The dance of the dead
Then you feel a cold breeze
It's scary and cold
No love at all
Things they go bump
Inside your mind you surely
Will find things that disturbs

Your little soul
Maybe will fall
Into the deep hole
You scream for help
But no one hears
Your call
Nobody at all
The nightmare's for
Real and all true
Welcome to the night

Close your eyes, fall asleep
Don't wake up
Ride the skies, don't fall down
Welcome to the night
Now when the bell
Strikes midnight
Don't turn around
You'll better watch out
Hold on to your soul
You'll never believe
What hides in the dark
When the moon is full

Your little soul
Maybe will fall
Into the deep hole
You scream for help
But no one hears
Your call
Nobody at all
The nightmare's for
Real and all true
Welcome to the night

Close your eyes, fall asleep
Don't wake up
Ride the skies, don't fall down
Ride the dragon, close your eyes
Fall asleep, don't wake up
Ride the skies, don't fall down
Welcome to the night...
