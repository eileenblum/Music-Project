All of a sudden
The watch shouted out:
"It's time to prepare cause
the Ireland shores are in sight"
A christian town is in our reach
We're ready
And we've taken a stand

Fighting til death
Breaking the waves
Fighting til death
Breaking the waves

Violent, furious
We ride the sea
With no respect for death
Fearless, dangerous
We cross the sea
Merciless
Breaking the waves

The plentiful legions of Oden are here
We loot and destroy
We're raising our axes and swords
Let's get ready for the kill
We'll crush the christian hordes

Fighting til death
Breaking the waves
Fighting til death
Breaking the waves

Violent, furious
We ride the sea
With no respect for death
Fearless, dangerous
We cross the sea
Merciless
Breaking the waves
