Our ancestors saw this holy man
Golden cross around his neck
He was promising eternal life

9th century christian missionary:
"I promise to take your sins away
And if you don't believe what I say
My knights will enforce it
anyway they can"

Let's march forward pagan sons
Let's go forward now
And proclaim this land
The land of the free
Let's march forward for revenge

Kill with pride
And kill with hate
Pagan sons, that is your fate
Kill, kill, kill,
Kill, kill
Kill with pride

Our ancestors saw this holy man
Holy bible in his hand
He was sentencing a girl to death

17th century priest:
"She has to burn for the sake of God
and if you don't believe what I say
My knights will enforce it
anyway they can"

Let's march forward pagan sons
Let's go forward now
And proclaim this land
The land of the free
Let's march forward to pay back

Kill with pride
And kill with hate
Pagan sons, that is your fate
Kill, kill, kill,
Kill, kill
Kill with hate

Kill with hate - For revenge

Kill with pride and kill with hate
Pagan son, it is your fate
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill...
