Conclusion ending, another day, another year, of giving in
And taking it all back, living in fear
Afraid to lie, questioning unjust,
Unable to trust and all that was my life
The darkness that I bring

Spite like in a feeling, seems to be
Another me looking out from me so
Hopes are too involving, constantly sensing
To serve me, just this constant beating

Spite like in a feeling, seems to be
Another me looking out from me so
Hopes are too involving, constantly sensing
To serve me, just this constant beating

Being sure, lacking and insecure
Facing consequences you donât feel you deserve to serve,
All the failures that you bring

When I wake up this wonât be my life
When I wake up Iâll be someone else
When I wake up I wonât have a purpose
When I wake up you will break me

When I wake up this wonât be my life
When I wake up Iâll be someone else
When I wake up I wonât have a purpose
When I wake up you will break me

Rapture, experience despair
The soul, generating poverty
Come on, and feel the gloom I bring
The soul, this life is happening

The soul, thatâs what is happening
Complete, corrode the suffering
The soul, thatâs what is happening
Complete, corrode the suffering

Round, at the round
At the round
At the round

Round, at the round
At the round
At the round
