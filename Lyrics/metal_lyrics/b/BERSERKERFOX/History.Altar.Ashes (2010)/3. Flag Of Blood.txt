Fight fire with fire, darkness engulfs the blind
Hearts left out hollowed, faith and hope have run dry
Breathe in deep, the air of what once was
Ask no questions, just hold your gun
Fear enticed in soul, dethroned the king of hope
Fire empty questions, knife to throat
Pay with life, graveyard piled up high
Colourless, faces stone gray

Paid justice, to the highest bidder
Faceless, instill martial law
Scare the population, lambs to the slaughter
Puppets to the powers, flag of blood
Fear enticed in soul, dethroned the king of hope
Fire empty questions, knife to throat

As the hammer of justice crushes all below 
The guiltless watch and laugh
Holding the strings of their puppets
You will do what they say, when they say
Back to the front
No sorrow for lives lost, just empty contempt
As for the soldiers they realize,
They kill for wrong, not for freedom
But for hate
Craving power precedes war
Sheep follow the master, fuel for fire
Unrest develops in ranks as they realize
They live under a flag of blood

Forth come, the winds of change
Laying all to waste
Last test, last breath, digest
Gehenna has come

Forth come, the winds of change
Laying all to waste
Last test, last breath, digest
Gehenna has come
