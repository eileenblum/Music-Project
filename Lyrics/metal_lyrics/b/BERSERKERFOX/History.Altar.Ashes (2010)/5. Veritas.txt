Falling to grey
Now feel the morning light.
From the dark side of the moon.

The struggle in too deep, the world collapses around me
Constant blackmail, clouded judgment, the noose to take me
Past fortunes squandered, empty breath of life
The frozen lake stares back at me, last time

Falling to grey
Now feel the morning light
From the dark side of the moon

Pain hope misery, the remnants of all I owe
Abated hate for life, ones own misery
Construct the broken, piece the puzzle
Beat the leader, the prophecy rings true

Betrayed by my own, the result of a silent world
Answers with no questions
Punished for my failure

The past rises to haunt the future, intrinsic rot
Do as I say, not as I do, the rule now taught
The fires inside burn and turn a black heart
Conformity is society, the will, the way
