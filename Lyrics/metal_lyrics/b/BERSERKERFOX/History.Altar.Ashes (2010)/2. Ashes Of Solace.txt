Pacified, gagged and bound
Left cold in this life
Shattered dreams, wretched lies
Burnt inside
Seething truths compound, set to ruin
Set to ruin

Open the door that leads below, pure river of hate
Bound by hands that always scribe
Etched into lost fate
Judge the world in righteousness, faceless, concrete authority

Now, ask why my world hates
Why, I feel no pain
When, my world disintegrates
Perish now, let it consummate

Find solace, in the shade of sanctity
Antagonist views, shatter order into fragments

Poisoned nerves, never ending winter
Silence forever more, deafening innocent ears
Empathetic stares, burning hollow
Permanent scarred horizon, reach breaking point

Breaking point
