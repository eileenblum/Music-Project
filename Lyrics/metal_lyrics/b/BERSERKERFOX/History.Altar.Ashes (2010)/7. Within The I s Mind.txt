The voices in my head
Makes me as tall as I can
Itinerant, itinerant, where are you
Why arenât you suffering

The voices in my head
Makes me as tall as I can
Itinerant, itinerant, where are you
Why arenât you suffering

Cause you consume me all.
Why wont you slay me, let me stay

Cause you consume me all.
Why wont you slay me, let me stay

You question everything, allow me
Iâll break, we cry
Together we die

Build it higher and higher
Invest the catch, conscious desire
Burn all in this place
Till nothings left and want is nil

In this disdain life, for I am eternal
I take it you breed here, letâs go down and drown
I see your treachery, itâs held on to
The suicide in you, lets go down and drown

Go, let me stay
Now, do as I say
Please, Iâll be free
Hell, is where youâll be

NO!
