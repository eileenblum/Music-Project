The taste of destruction pacifies you
Follow the wrath of all before you
Hopelessness coincides with reality

The grave robbed of its tranquility
Darkness the shadow on which hands feeds
The green serpent lashes
Against the self professed throned kings
Pestilence in check, laughter in the gallows

As the hunger grows, greed follows
The pain of rebirth begins
Infanticide and infatuation rules king

Fear bred, by our own
Consume all but I

Two rules, two worlds
Execution of the mandate, within our own walls
Hanging of the patriot, death of the crusade
The new day brings more nightmares
Insurgents bring hate and pain
And all in the eye is burnt
