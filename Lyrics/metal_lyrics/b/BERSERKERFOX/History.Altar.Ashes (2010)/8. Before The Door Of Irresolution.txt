Societies downfall through our own generation
Itâs not my fault for who I am.

Drug dependencies broaden the divide
As the young pop all the green blue and white
Leaving life behind, as we ask ourselves
Why the conscious has no alibi

Why they donât know, whatâs wrong from right
Coz we reap what we sow, every night
Fasten clandestine, blackened repertoire
Buckled down as the bottles passed

The sting of censorship, has lost all its pain
Deadened by the fear of conformity

Failed society, steady slow demise
Unrepentant fortunes all a lie
Blackened dreams and sight, fatigue and anguish lie
In the breath of societiesâ ignorance
The tool of failure, now born within
To do away with life, no virility
As the plague spreads, now all dark disease
Destruction of the future burns the breed

Burns the breed.

Bred a jealous, hate in everyone
Who doesnât follow, who doesnât lead
Every species has a power chain

Statutes march as they crucify, heaven comes to those with will to die
Close your eyes, welcome night

Lay your arms down as you rise to the sky
All hell, pain and suffering will flow

End I
