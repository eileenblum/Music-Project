Born and bred in a sheltered life, the world unknowing
The fruits of life hidden from me
Torn and pulled, asunder knowing all but wrapped
In the cold of nothingness
God help me

Rise in me, flood the banks of greed, chosen is my future
Hate keeps death near
Find your need in no-one, constant purgery, ripped from the womb
Falling through fear

Find your way, blank eyes stray, in the dust of the past.
Understand the rule by which I must obey
Shunned by elders yet hunted by the hurt decay
Apparent lifelessness, lonesome I roam alone and 
By myself is my blackened life, ashes in tow

Misery, is understanding, the world around you.
Wanting to find whatâs, wrong inside, is the answer
Yet lost is the question

Know nothing, I know not, constant degradation
Sow but do not reap my life
Rumours, circle the sky, illuminating false hope 
Shot down by the never ending lies of deceit
Knowledge holds no power, for the wise
Simple minorities keep the constant faÃ§ade of power

Constant search for the life I've missed
Unbeknown to all that could be 
Blinded by the hand that leads

Free me
Free me
Free me
Free me

Repay my life
