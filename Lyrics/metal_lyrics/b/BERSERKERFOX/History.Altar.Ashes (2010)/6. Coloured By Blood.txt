Itâs all fucking hopeless

Diversity, eroded from the mind of the young
Repelled from the image of the norm
The same breed of birth yet bred apart
Under the same sun

Coloured by race as the majority lend rule to its own
Hindering the mix a time ago, all were one
As change surged forward en mass, asphyxiated by the lighter shade

Inherent claustrophobia brought on by hate from birth
Conditioned to turn away
As time trudges on it becomes apparent, all has changed
Less hate, less divide, rise up against the tide
Break the walls, kill the partition
Humanity learns weâre all the same, blood and bone
