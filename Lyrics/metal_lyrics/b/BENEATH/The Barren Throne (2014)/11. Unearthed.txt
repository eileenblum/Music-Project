swirling from the ground
terror embodies as flesh
light rushed through eyelids
sawn shut with the strings
holding existence
into expanses of unearthed horrors

as the barrier crumbles and fragmentizes
the dream of prowling worshippers
and his waking nightmare expands

hallow spirits
mournful discharger
hallow tempter
enlightens its mind

their rightful heir
is consumed by terror
crush the neck
of revival

brute manifestation
embody the pure
the corrupt seed of truth
planted onto fields of sin

hallow desire
blotted truth
depth of mind
shallow regret
