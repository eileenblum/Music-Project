he who may lie, bitter trust
the eye for an eye
the tooth for malice
lust shall bestowed upon a confronter

hammer its skull so melts
the ore into Jewels of gold
trust is the furnace for hope to vapor
and scatter onto the path

desecrate the vessel
revoke the honor
rip the strings so pride may bind
and carry you from the path

hammer its skull so melts
the ore into Jewels of gold
trust is the furnace for contempt to grow
where suns show no mercy

the path of strenght

doctrine where affection is praised
may lead the fool to reason
look beyond a skyline
it purifies the smokeless blaze

the carrier of seed
nurtures an omen
to life
and growth

he who may lie, bitter trust
the eye for an eye
the tooth for malice
lust shall bestowed upon a confronter

hammer its skull so melts
the ore into Jewels of gold
trust is the furnace for hope to vapor
and guide you from the path

the path of force
