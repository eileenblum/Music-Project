pillars built with teeth of steel
fallen from an iron jaw
that lured a virgin to his grin
and left her weightless

for worms to nest and breed
inside a weightless shell
fate will crack the iron jaw
the hive will spawn a kingdom

out of her
stringed mouth

rays from burning eyes
glass forms with gathered tears
kissed decaying lips

as skin melts with steel
and dirt summons a crown of gold
Crystals reflect through the haze
draining glare from unspoiled eyes

in an empty shell

the virgin breath becomes a shadow
and scatters from light so chokes her neck forever

rays from burning eyes
tears of black to give way
kissed decaying lips
