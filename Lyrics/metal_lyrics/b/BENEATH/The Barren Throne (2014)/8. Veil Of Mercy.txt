as the curtain burns, blaze reveals
the hate that poisoned its well
behind the veil of mercy
saviors may drown

into the body where hunger is constant
where desire withholds its breath
until the sickness may heal
and corrosion provides our need

blind need

but mass will combust
and shatter from
the howl of glorification

until the waves calm
and start to whisper
whisper obsctructive poems
whisper condemning songs

nothing can feed the hunger blaze
or nurture it to a star
for rain will pour
and still the waves
although reduced to ashes

as the candle burns
blaze reveals the hate that posoined its wel

behind the veil of mercy
saviors may drown

into the body of suffering
where silence withholds its breath
and light emits the black storm
rain which only yields horrors

nothing can feed the hunger blaze
or nurture it to a star
for blood will pour
and still the waves
although reduced to nothing

mother of contempt
guides the stream
draining the well
withers the oak
pray for a calling
of merciful hope
pray for the dawn
of peaceful rest

blind faith
follow the stream
and fall into the depth
of the waterfall

into the body of suffering
where silence withholds its breath
and light emits the black cloud
rain which only yields horrors
