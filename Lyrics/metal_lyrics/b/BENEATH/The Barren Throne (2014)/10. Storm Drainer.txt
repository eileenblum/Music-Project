through the eye of the storm
a time and space standstill
this yearning entity unfolds itself
and galaxies succumb

blooming, a flower of ignorance
this life form won't prevail
calling, the harvesed terror
pitiful existence long ago silenced
echoes, torments from distant
ages of unseen ferocity
calling, for only dead silence
so eyes can finally rest
so eyes can behold

lineal shaped void
fabricated essence
he who shouts empty hate
cannot bloom beyond death
strained into sleep
lasting until the blizzard stops
drive the fabric of
binding dimensions to clash

a circular current
through which hordes of souls combust
the exit to nothing
the exit to purity
tearing the orbits
planets shall clash to form
exits to nothing
exit to purity

withering a flower of logic
this life-form won't endure
reaping the seed of terror
pitiful existence long ago silenced
shouts, echo from distant
nightmares that mirror hidden realities
inside, closed eyelids
flashes of bloodsheds are burnt forever

tearing the orbits
planets shall clash to form
exits to nothing
exit to purity

through the eyes of the wolf
