dying breed of slaves that built these walls of reason
masks from hidden kings, lashing them forward
liquid sand shall form, the pyramids with time
although they stand, for no one to remember

withered hand, points the way
cut the rotting limb, so spreads infected
truths will drive, the stones to dust
truths will drive

as rust forms a crown of thorns, colored red from lust
frozen sphere plunges into the lake of being
from a hidden mask, tears of blood will pour
and form the massive stream which sinks the kingdom

dying breed of slaves that built these walls of reason
masks from hidden kings, lashing them forward
bones shall form, these pyramids of glory
although they stand, only for time to mock them

burnt flesh guides the way
sever their heads, and scatter throughout

the aeon where silver runs through veins
and clots their hearts, so bursts from ignorance

electric storms have cometh
acid rains will blot
and golden masks will turn
to stones

feed the sun with sacrificed hearts
tears of the newborn will bring down the sky

worhipping an eagle upon its throne, drink from the deifying cup
tortured minds long for an end, but cannot gain eternal rest
water for the sacred ground, will not prevent the agony

from dirt they rose
into dirt they will return
