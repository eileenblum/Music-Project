This never fulfilled thirst
Of wounds which may not heal
Even as sand dissolves to dust
The threads of distance fail

Thirst

Which guides the tongue
And Burns beyond ashes

So pure those mournful tears
They drown it's lungs to sleep

This never satisfied lust
Of wounds which may not heal
Even as sand dissolves to dust
The threads of distance fail

Hidden in mothers chest
A decaying limb of compulsion

Chalice of fire
Sacred realm of truth
May the glow guide me
Through empty shade

Wisdom of fire
Decaying limb of truth
May the past guide me
Through hollow ground

Monument for crippled lust
Searching beam which guides
Even as sand dissolves to dust
The threads of distance fail

With flames reflecting 
In the mirror from beyond
The whispers engrave all reason
Leaving only an empty mind

Chalice of fire
Sacred realm of truth
May the glow guide me
Through empty shade

Wisdom of fire
Decaying limb of truth
May the past guide me
Through hollow ground

This never fulfilled thirst
Of wounds which may not heal
Even as sand dissolves to dust
The threads of distance fail
