inner core, unjust revival
conscious mass gains spite
the clogged vein
cannot burst free
surging through
fruiltess space

urge to feast 
on flesh and bones
to spark
its claimed growth
never to kneel
but Always bow
from the weight
of aged remains

crooked shell in eternal chains
anchored through its back

empty shell, with an eternal gaze
orbits, depleted kingdoms
barren ground, plowed with fear
kissed by lifeless lips

a spark of progress emits a light
poisoned thorns abounded in time
may it never kneel but Always ow
from the weight of hope

faint warmth urges
through futile space
a starless core
light is born
into the expanding cradle
reflective window to exhausting peace

as Sparks that beaconed, through this world
waste all need to sustain
so dense in glory but exhausts the fuel
finally collapse from their weight

pulsar of hate weakens until
only empty space forgives all

urge to feast 
on flesh and bones
to spark
its claimed growth
never to kneel
but Always bow
from the weight
of aged remains

but from nothing an empire will again form
so completes the cycle of depletion

empty shell, with an eternal gaze
orbits, depleted kingdoms
once their paths was tightly bound
with fabric of time
