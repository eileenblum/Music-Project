tragedy befalls me
powerless locked in stasis
scheming's of removal
unable to speak
unable to act

my fate is sealed

once free to roam
now bound by demons
carried over familiar fields
left for recycling, to become one with all
a feast to remember
natures work has begun

skin pecked open, bones gnawed to dust
guts pulled apart
black cloud covers my mind

sky burial
