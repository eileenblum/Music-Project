Archaic tales handed down for centuries
Simple words loaded with dread
Bereft of comfort, compelling restrains
To be obeyed as law

Inscribed by hateful imposters
Striving to remain in control
Oppressing those that follow them
Bind them to their mandate

Lies of the Dead

Used for subjugation instead of wisdom
Foundations built in blood
The meaning no longer relevant
As long as all comply

Bloody wars fought over simple words
Civilizations laid to waste
Those that look for different paths
Exiled and forsaken

All this grief built on
The lies of the dead
All those words just
Lies of the dead

Still used to oppress
The flock kept under control

Trying to save the souls
Of the ones who are lost

Politicians their modern warlords
In their neverending war

The truth behind their lies
Those worthless souls will never be saved by those empty words

Archaic tales handed down for centuries
Simple words loaded with dread
Bereft of comfort, compelling restraints
To be obeyed as law

Inscribed by hateful imposters
Striving to remain in control

All this grief built on
The lies of the dead
All these words just
Lies of the dead
