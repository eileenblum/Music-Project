I crave your blood, rushing in your veins
The fluid of life, for ages it has sustained me
An endless trail of victims, faded from my mind
A price Iâm willing to pay, for my bloodlust 

Confined to the dark
From now to eternity
My only
Thoughts of my prey
Warm blood within
Rush of the kill
My awakened beast

The scent of your fear
As I hunt you down
Almost as vitalizing
As your blood

Bloodlust

My victims impaled, for all to see
Drained to death
The massacre continues, for Iâm insatiable
Bloody reign of terror

Confined to the dark
From now to eternity
My awakened beast

After all these years
I stay the same
A vicious hunter
In my prime

My brutal legacy
Written in your blood
In darkness I shall remain
For all eternity
