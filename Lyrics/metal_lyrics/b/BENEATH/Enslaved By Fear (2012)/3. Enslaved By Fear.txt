Mindless slaves controlled by their words
Blindly believing the good book
Told what to think, told what to do
Never question their dogma
Told what to think, told what to do
Never question

Fed on their propaganda
The endless spewing lies

Manipulated by fear
Of the unknown, of the hidden
Fear of darkness, of death
What is different must die

Mindless slaves controlled by their words
Blindly believing the good book
Told what to think, told what to do
Never question their doctrine

Enslaved by fear
Follow whatâs written
Enslaved by fear
A hellish world

Crushing, the weight of the world
Stray from the path, the end is near
Itâs time to rise against the oppression
Destroy the shackles of hate
