Gods among men supreme in every way
In our wake you will follow
Higher beings, you bow before us
Obey our bidding

Ascend to our thrones above
Built by your blood bones
Adorned by our grisly conquests
Our rightful place

We overthrow your kings
Cast down your lords
Banish your hierarchs
Abolish your religions

As gods we walk the earth
As gods we walk the earth

Above your moral retraints
Follow no mortal codex
We are immortal ones
The ones who will lead you

Our wrath you should fear
None in your path will be spared
Torn apart, obliterated
You will find no mercy here

Revel in the carnage
Neverending bloodbath
Adversaries ripped apart
Left behind, forgotten

As gods we walk the earth
As gods we walk the earth

We overthrow your kings
Cast down your lords
Banish your hierarchs
Abolish your religions
