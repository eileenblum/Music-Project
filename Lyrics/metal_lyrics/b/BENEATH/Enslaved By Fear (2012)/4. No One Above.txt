I am the way
Freedom of self
The one true path
No one above

False idols or imagined figments
Are meaningless to me

You wonât tell me what to believe
My path is not of your flock

Strength in me
No one above

I am my own master
No one higher than me
No gods dictate me
I am free

Do what I will
Is the whole of my law
I renounce
The book of lies

I have no fear
I have no guilt
I have no sin
I have no remorse

You wonât tell me what to believe
My path is not yours

Your prayers will never be heard
There is no one above
