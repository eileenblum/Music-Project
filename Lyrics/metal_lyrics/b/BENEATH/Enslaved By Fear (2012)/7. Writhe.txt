I walk among you mortals
Undetected, unknown
Resplendent in my true form
Too much for you to know

Writhe

Constantly I tempt you, whisper in your ear
Unattainable goals, slightly out of reach
Make it seems so easy, the path ahead is straight
Just cross the line, a step of no return

Lies
Lust
Greed
Wrath

None of you can resist me, each of you will fall
One by one, you will heed my call
My promises are too tempting, but all are empty lies
Your tragic mortality broken, all of you are mine

Writhe in torment
In your depraved Hell
Endless self-torture
Living with yourself

Give in to my tempting
Succumb to the sweet sin
Only a question of
When you will damn yourself to hell

Constantly I tempt you, whisper in your ear
Unattainable goals, slightly out of reach
My promises too tempting, but all are empty lies
Your fragile morality lies broken, all of you are mine

Writhe in torment
In your depraved hell
Endless self-torture
Living with yourself

Writhe

Give in to my tempting
Succumb to the sweet sin
Only a question of
When you will damn yourself to hell
