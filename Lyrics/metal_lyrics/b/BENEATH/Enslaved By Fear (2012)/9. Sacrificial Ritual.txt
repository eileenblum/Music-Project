Climbing the steps, you prepare for the knife, your day of distinction
Itâs your hour at last, on this holy day, your blood will flow
Waiting impatient, itâs your place in line, the highest form of death
The ultimate honor, appeasing the gods, as they drink your blood
Drink your blood

A holy ritual on the highest step
The sacrificial stone awaits
Youâve never felt such pain
As the high priest hold high your still beating heart

Lifeless bodies cast aside
Waiting for the butcherâs knife
Mutilated corpses dismembered
For cannibalistic beliefs

The victims, warriorâs feast
Utmost honor give glory
Devouring human flesh
Newfound strength with every bite

Thousand slain to honor the gods
The rivers overflowing with blood
Endless streams of willing subjects
Securing the blessings of the gods

Brutality inspiring terror
Consolidating their society
Traditions centuries old
Demand fresh offerings

Blood for the bloodgod

Waiting impatient, itâs your place in line, the highest form of death
