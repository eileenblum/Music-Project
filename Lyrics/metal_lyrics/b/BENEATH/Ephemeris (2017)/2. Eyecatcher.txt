Force fed flock of empty shells
The kind that have no being
Endless lines through halls of time
Waiting to be done

Coded to fail
Built to be destroyed
Expansion or depletion
Call on those who fear it most

Ephemeris
Of two eyed moons that orbit nothing
They follow the falsified backward - step of motion
Clockwork built upon this sidereal time
Realize the pattern of the nodes

Coded to fail
Built to be destroyed
Expansion or depletion

Call on those who do not speak out
Call on those who fear it most
Call on those who do not speak out

Winding up the gears of destruction
Forward or nothing
Embedded into the eye
Which cannot see beyond the horizon
All must be traced again to complete
The inner working of the universe

Force fed flock of empty shells
The kind that have no being
Endless lines through halls of time
Waiting to be done

Ephemeris
Of two eyed moons that orbit nothing
They follow the falsified backward - step of motion
Clockwork built upon this sidereal time
Realize the pattern
