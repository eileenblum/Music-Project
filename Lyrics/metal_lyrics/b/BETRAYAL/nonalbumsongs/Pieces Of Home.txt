I'm ready to break at the start of the race
I can't keep the pace
I'm not sure how much more I can take
Now I'm cutting corners
I watch it break

I'm watching it break
Fall to the street
Wall to wall
Brick by brick

Keeping count of every heart beat
Losing track of every step
Putting back these bricks into place
One breath
Don't let it slip away
I knew, I knew
It wouldn't be the same
When I got home
I knew, I knew
Every step I take
Would be away from
Ever finding what it means
To stand on my own
Always searching
For these broken pieces
Of my home

I've lost my grip
Of what I thought I'd become
Got lost inside the walls of my mind
When all I wanted was a way back home
All I found was
All I found was
Pieces
Pieces of home

Keeping count of every heart beat
Losing track of every step
Putting back these bricks into place
One breath
Don't let it slip away
I knew, I knew
It wouldn't be the same
When I got home
I knew, I knew
Every step I take
Would be away from
Ever finding what it means
To stand on my own
Always searching
For these broken pieces
Of my home

I knew this wouldn't last
Because all we had is left in the past
Bring me back
Bring me back
Bring me back
Bring me back

I knew, I knew
It wouldn't be the same
When I got home
I knew, I knew
Every step I take
Would be away from
Ever finding what it means
To stand on my own
Always searching
For these broken pieces
Of my home

I knew, I knew
It wouldn't be the same
When I got home
I knew, I knew
Every step I take
Would be away from home
And all I found was pieces
Pieces of my home
