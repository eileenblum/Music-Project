No tall tales time to understand
A sinister clan has a master plan
They're dedicated to evil intent
Into vulnerable lives is where they're sent

Their cause
Is hate
They'll prey
On the weak

Perverting values and God they abort
Morals and order their goal to distort
They pray and fast in diligent attack
For the pleasure to see a righteous man turn back

God's power
They shun
Separations
Begun

Sent to the chapel on an early Sunday morn
Just to show the arrogance and scorn
Demonstrating defiance determined to mock and resist
The satanic visitation is easy to be missed

To see
The church
Deceived
To fall

Families in disarray
Senses attack
Of indescribable strength
Who will fight

Your mind's
Off guard
Off God
They'll kill

The marriages seemed to have a chance until one arrived
To offer immorality and infidelity disguised
Molesters and abusers watching over our little ones
But all accounts invalid because they're the young?

They know
The game
To discredit
To shame

Danger lies in waiting for destruction stay
Disbelief their victory as ignorance doesn't pay
No fabricated story or paranoia fear
Just the assassin in the midst knowing they're near

Don't discount the satanic alliance sent to deceive
Darkened disciples are plotting domination to achieve
Wisdom and discernment is where the battle's won
Allowing God's intervention let his will be done
