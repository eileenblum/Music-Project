Abandonment of Lord
Performing spiritual adultery
Forsaking God their Deliverer
Prostituting themselves to Baal

Sent to end this apostasy
The last prophet enters the story
Standing in the power of God
Sends words exclaiming, "Elijah is here!"

The challenge is given to the king
To summon the prophet of Baal
And the people of Israel upon mount Carmel
To settle who is God, Lord or Baal

Elijah instructs, "prepare two bulls
Cut into pieces and place on an altar
You can call your god, I'll call the Lord
And the one who answers by fire, he is God"

Calling and babbling, ancient chanting arose
450 prophets of Baal danced around
The altar all day with no response
"Shout louder!" Elijah taunted
"Oh yeah Baal is god, Ha! Ha! Right
Maybe he's off somewhere travelling
Or taking a little nap, just maybe!"

The prophets of Baal shouted louder
Slashing themselves, letting the blood flow
Continuing frantic prophesying till the eve
With no response, no answer, no fire

Elijah smirked, "drench my altar
With water just for fun"
Then he prayed, "Lord let it be known
That You're the God of Israel"

The fire of the Lord fell
Consuming everything and burning the altar
The people fell face first and cried
"The Lord is God! The Lord is God!"

The Elijah commands, "seize the prophets of Baal
Don't let them get away
Slaughter them according to God
For you've seen the Lord's authority today!"
