Blood shed, down Calvary's cross
Is the place the story starts
It continues when you know Who it was
Who shed His blood for you and me

God's only Son gave His life
So you and I can live and reign
Death and hell's flames have no hold on us
So claim Christ's name!

In the midst of hell's attack
With backs against the wall
Think upon a Saviour's blood
The cross and the shedding of His blood

There's a power in the blood of Jesus
It breaks the chains that bind
Stand your ground let grace abound
For victory you will find!

So you say you don't need Jesus today
But who will you call on when your soul is burning away?
Will you plead for His blood when you realize it's too late?
Receive Christ's forgiveness today by the price that He paid

The final scene the Judgement Throne
A cross and a sinner
Prosecuting, the accuser from the flames
Speaks lies, "he's mine"

You're kneeling face to the ground
Awaiting the final verdict, "no guilty!"
"I know him because
He's washed in My blood", says the Son of God!

"Enter to thy kingdom"
The Almighty God will say
Or, "depart from me you evil doer
For I do not know you this day"

For those who accept Jesus
Will live eternally
The Prince of Peace has shed His blood
What will you do with it?
