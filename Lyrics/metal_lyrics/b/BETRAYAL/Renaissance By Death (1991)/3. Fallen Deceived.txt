Indescribable sounds of horror
As another screams to die
Rising up in sorrow from hopelessness
As millions in anguish they cry

Heckling demons mocking their victims
Emotions given to fear
As they ever burn in the presence
Of the father of all lies

All I keep hearing
Over and over again
Is I could've gone to heaven
And escaped eternal torment

Some have been here thousand of years
With no ending to come

We pray for final death
Free us from this pain

The deception of hell is a realization
Of a lie found too late
As the saints go marching into heaven
The unrepentant will receive their fate

Peace and treasures
Is what they'll enjoy above
But we'll all rot in damnation
Since we've turned away from God's love
