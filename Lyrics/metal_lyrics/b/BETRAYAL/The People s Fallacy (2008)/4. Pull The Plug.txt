All of the lies pierce right through my heart
Leave me speechless there is nothing left to say
All of the false hope built up again
Over and over again

But now I, I am through
I am fucking through with you.
What does a promise mean to you?
Break me like you've broken them.

You have not seen the last of me
Try with all the might you have
I will perserver on my own
You will regret what you have said.
This is the key watch as I swollow it
Deadbolt the door and never look back.

All of the false hope built up again
Over and over again
But now I, I am through
I am fucking through with you.
I put you into your grave. [4x]
