You all stand divided.
WE STAND AS ONE!
You're here for yourself.
I'm here for everyone.
I know it's hard to stand alone.
We work to stand tall.

This is the people's fallacy,
for those who choose life after greed.
We saw this some time ago.
Stand with us and never fall.

Your selfishness is your downfall.

All of this greed, will ruin you.
Drain you of what you are worth.
I know it won't be too much.
Your life comes to an end.
Your end comes now.

You all stand divided.
WE STAND AS ONE!
You're here for yourself.
I'm here for everyone.
I know it's hard to stand alone.
STAND WITH US!
