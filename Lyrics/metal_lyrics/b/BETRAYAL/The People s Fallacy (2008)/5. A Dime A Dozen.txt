You think you're so original,
but you're nothing new.
You're just the latest model,
worse than the one before.

An empty face, lost in the crowd.
Filled by nothing else
than those around you.

You find yourself through an image .
An image not your own.

Hear these words.
You are not better than them.
Take a look around.
We are equal.

[Guest vocals by Justin Ichi from The Linden Murder]

HEAR THESE WORDS

Your eyes are filled with lies,
and these eyes show,
show the truth!
