Don't pretend like you want to be here.
It's clear your mind is somewhere else.
Leave me to bask in my own glory.
Quit the act.
It's clear your mind is somewhere else.
Leave me to bask in my own glory.

You play me like another fool.
Cover me with a jester hat.
I will not be covered any longer.
You will back the fuck down.

Take a step back.
Look at yourself.
See all the lies?
Just give up now.

Raise yourself up from this mess.
I know how you feel.
What you're going through.
But I'm beyond that you sunk down. [x2]

Get your satisfaction. Get your fix.
Just know I will not clean up your fucking mess. [x2]

GET YOUR SATISFACTION! GET YOUR FIX! [x2]
