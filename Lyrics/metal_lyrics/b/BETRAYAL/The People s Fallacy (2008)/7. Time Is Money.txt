A new enemy to face, but not face to face. A fist will do you no good.
How can you kill what you cannot see? Or that you don't believe in?
Kill more of what's killing you. One stroke is another moment lost and never coming back again. Don't try to change what you cannot control, or even worse, what you don't understand. Appreciate, show some courage. Show us all you can be. And now you see, you cannot win.
You're undeserving. Enjoy your demise. Step up to the challenge.
Overcome your debt, face up to this struggle. Overcome your debt,
You're down and out.
