You left me no choice.
Iâm so sick of you,
and your fucking lies.
Stay the fuck away. [x2]

You were never meant to feel this way.
All your thoughts have gone to fucking waste.
Keep to yourself and we all will succeed.
Your ambitions donât matter to me.

Keep Away!

Your vision means nothing in my eyes.
You speak your words, I hear nothing.
Keep talking like youâre something special.
Turn the fuck around, youâre not welcome.

You left me running on empty and expect me to take you back.
Donât act like this changes nothing.
Youâre on your own now, face the fucking facts.

Just make yourself
stop breathing. [x2]
