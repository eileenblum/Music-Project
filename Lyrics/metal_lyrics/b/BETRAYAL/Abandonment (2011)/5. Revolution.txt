Ignorance will get you nowhere. An end to intolerance. No longer a democracy. Bow down to a new born king.
This is a fucking warning, evacuate the life you live.
The dawn of change, a chance to secure your redemption.
Everything that you stand for, I stand against
Everything that you want to be, I want to destroy
Ignorance will get you nowhere. An end to intolerance. No longer a democracy. Bow down to a new born king.
Picking myself up everyday
The nightmare continues but we stay the course. Sleep with one eye open so you won't miss out on the destruction.
Your entire world is in flames. In a matter of seconds, life as you know it ceases, ceases to exist.
A new life comes with a new day. A new life comes we're here to control. Revolution.
