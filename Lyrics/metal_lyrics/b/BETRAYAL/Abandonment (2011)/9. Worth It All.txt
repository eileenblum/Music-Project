You can't live if you have nothing to live for, you only live to rot another day.
You won't die if you die for nothing, never looking back, we will remain.
You look like you have nothing to live for, you only live to rot another day.
You won't die if you die for nothing, never looking back, we will remain.
I'll fight this war waged for your approval. In with the new, out with the old. Now I'm the only one whose judgement matters. I'm sorry I have failed you when you've been by my side since the beginning. Where has all the time gone?
Unconditional loyalty. Throw everything earned away to gain one thing worth it all.
You can't live if you have nothing to live for, you only live to rot another day.
You won't die if you die for nothing, never looking back, we will remain.
Two decades later, this is all I have to show after you've given me everything. In the end, my life is yours. Now I know I owe you the world, every second, no more lost time. My time is found our time is right now. Illuminate the sky, the above, a sign that we've reached the top. No looking down, no looking back. This is what I'll live and die for.
This is what I'll live and die for [2x]
I'll die for you. I'll die for this
You can't live if you have nothing to live for.
You can't live if you have nothing to die for
