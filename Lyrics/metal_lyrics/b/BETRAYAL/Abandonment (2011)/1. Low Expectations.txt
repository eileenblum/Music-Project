I never knew that this could be so hard. Always in the dark, wondering.
Who the fuck have i become. I always thought that I would know myself.
Always in the dark. Becoming what I never knew. Who the fuck have I become?
I'm never coming, always going and expecting the worst.
Expect the worst. Who the fuck have I become?
I'm the exact person I hate. My words are venom. It's killing me from the inside out.
Who the fuck have I become?
I'm never coming, always going, i expect the worst. Always in the dark.
I hope I see that light again.
Who the fuck have I become?
What the fuck have i become?
Condemned, imprisoned in, in my own head.
I'm always, kicked down and dragged out by my own hand.
No one should ever live this way.
Who the fuck have i become? Become.
On one should ever live this way, never coming always going.
Who the fuck have I become.
Expect the worst.
