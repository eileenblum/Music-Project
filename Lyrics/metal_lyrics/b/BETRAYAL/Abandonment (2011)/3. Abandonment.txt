Another hopeless victim to the cruel game you play.
We're left alone, left to fight, left to suffer.
The loss of life, the beginning of a darker tomorrow.
Brought to your knees and forced to serve.
Encaged in steadfast thought, abandoned.
No way out, no excuses, abandoned. All the time in the world an outcast, abandoned.
Recognize your flaws, your setbacks, abandoned.
No longer reaching for the stars, for the stars. Hands to my heart ready to take charge.
Leave this behind, nothings holding you back, but this is home. This is all I know. Burn the flag of surrender.
