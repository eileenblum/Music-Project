Im so sick and tired.
Tired of everything. 
Ignored, pushed aside, when I need you most.
My mind is failing.
My body disintegrates in my hands.
I'm falling apart. I'm falling victim. 
What do I have to do to get your attention?
To get your concern? 

I'M BREAKING DOWN!

I live life everyday waking up on my deathbed. 
Why am I the only one that sees this?
Hoping for the worst, wishing with no belief.
This is all catching up with you. 

And you'll start every day waking up on your deathbed.

Why do I even bother? 
Why do I even care? 
Living another day without life.

I'M BREAKING DOWN!

I live life everyday waking up on my deathbed. 
Why am I the only one that sees this? 
Hoping for the worst, wishing with no belief. 
This all catching up with you. 

A point of no return. 
The time to meet your maker. 
Everything you loved stripped away.

I'm breaking down.
