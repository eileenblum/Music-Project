A broken back with a heart of gold, the legend of a martyr with no soul. I'll cough up blood to clear my lungs.
Sinking to the depths. Dragging me to the ocean's floor. With broken wings I fly alone. I see your eyes as I'm sinking.
I've always heard that the good die young,
At least I know (at least I know), know that I'll die young.
I've always heard that the good die young,
But with this heart of gold I have no fear, no fear.
No fear of what's to come.
Weighed down by this heart of gold.
No blood within and lost all without. A shadow of a man flesh and bone. I'll cought up blood to clear my lungs.
Sinking to the depths. All I know is I'll die young. Lost everything I called my own. I see your eyes as I'm sinking.
I've always heard that the good die young,
At least I know (at least I know), know that I'll die young.
I've always heard that the good die young,
But with this heart of gold I have no fear, no fear.
No fear of what's to come.
Born self destructive, at least I know that I'll die young.
Weighed down by this heart of gold.
