Slowly changing everything, but we're getting nowhere fast.
My word against the word, everyone is right in their eyes.
Why add to the fight? Why change who we were made to be?
Secure in numbers, when together, we outnumber the world.
Set yourself free from the war within. No one wins this. It's all or none.This time its me against you all. This time its me,
I'm my own God
Define the name, stripped of everything.
Held on a pedestal yet all eyes still
Still look down on you.
Why go against the grain? Why go against it all?
When going with it is just as hard?
Never be ruled.
