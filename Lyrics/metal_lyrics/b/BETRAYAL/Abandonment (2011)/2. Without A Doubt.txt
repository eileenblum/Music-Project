Cast upon me like death upon life
Your words mean less to me than dirt.
Pretend you know exactly who I am
This is where we rise up
No matter what you say or do,
I won't hear a word you say
Someday you'll know exactly who I am
Someday we will prevail

To those who cast doubt upon me
My life, my choice, my fate's on me
I can't be your sight when you fail to see
Never falling down, always on my feet
To those who cast doubt upon me
My life, my choice, my fate's on me
Get off my back I'm trying to breath
I'm not living for you, I only live for me

I only live for me

Speak what you mean,
Don't hold it back.
The lies eat you away,
the truth is killing you.

We will prevail

To those who cast doubt upon me
My life, my choice, my fate's on me
I can't be your sight when you fail to see
Never falling down, always on my feet
To those who cast doubt upon me
My life, my choice, my fate's on me
Get off my back I'm trying to breath
I'm not living for you, I only live for me

I only live for me

We will prevail
Reject your will to fail
Always on my feet
Our will can never be beat

To those who cast doubt upon me
My life, my choice, my fate's on me
I can't be your sight when you fail to see
Never falling down, always on my feet
To those who cast doubt upon me
My life, my choice, my fate's on me
Get off my back I'm trying to breath
I'm not living for you, I only live for me
