Death of memories. Don't second guess what this is about.
You know what this means to me
This is the cause and effect and you deserve nothing less than this.
You will walk this world alone as I kill this memory.
Embrace a life that never was, a life that never was.
Make your face as invisible as the blood washed from your hands.
Death of a memory. Don't run away from what's become the past.
You know what this means to me. Look at what you caused, blame yourself.
You're guilty of it all
Forget
Death of a memory
Forget the past.
