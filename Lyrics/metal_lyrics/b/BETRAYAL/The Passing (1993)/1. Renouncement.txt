[Marcus N. Colon]

insurrection, upheaval to remove, your wicked requisition, from my life.
dissipation, of your rule, reviling your darkness, no longer your fool.
Satan denied, death is denied, deny the lie, all sin must die.
no more vomit does this dog want to eat - hear this -
I renounce your perverted ways, retribution for my pain you'll pay,
for the blood now covers me this day, you're cancelled in my life.
renouncement! I renounce all I've done and said, against my Lord,
now I stand beneath, the cleansing flood of His precious blood.
Satan denied, death is denied, deny the lie, all sin must die.
no more vomit does this dog want to eat.
