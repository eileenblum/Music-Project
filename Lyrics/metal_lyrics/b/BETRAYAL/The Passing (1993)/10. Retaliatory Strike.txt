[Marcus N. Colon]

the remnant few who follow, Jesus our King, no sound of retreat, time to rise and besiege.
retaliatory strike! an assault with authority determined by the, work done on the Cross, we invade on warring knees, in Christ's name on high, we follow the cries of victory, of the saints that have gone before, will we falter at defeat? no! we may lose a battle but we're sure to win the war.
retaliatory strike! onwards, onwards, a blood stained cross on our battle flag, forward, soldiers, the sword will pierce the enemy.

[Solo Bob]

retaliatory strike! a forceful kingdom, made of forceful me, in violent travail, hell has been shaken again, we follow the cries of victory, of the saints that have gone before, will we falter at defeat? no! we may lose a battle, be we're sure to win the war.
