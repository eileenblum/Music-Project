Devastating greed, calling to the masses
Falling on your knees, inviting the deatholation
The rest of reason set aside
Hands are tide with rusted wire
Gasping sounds thickens the air
Acid melts your eyes

Blinded by the lights
As the flesh bleeds death by the hour

Smells of rotten meat, makes your veins cold
Pain exceeds the toleration point
Swallow pills to dwell all suffering

Blinded by the lights
Flesh bleeds by the hours
Mushroom detoxing your brain
Dead and devoured

Deatholation calms the air
Extermination of silence
Makes the unborn feel like it is good to be alive
Create an army of the damaged
Call upon the sheep of God
Another priest will fall be killed or step aside

Be sure the deathchair is comfortable
She pays to see what's under your skin
Pleasure of the flesh gives a burning sensation
Devil lays his hand on your face and exhales

Deatholation calms the air
Extermination of silence
Makes the unborn feel like it is good to be alive
Create an army of the damaged
Call upon the sheep of God
Another priest will fall be killed or step aside

Reason depraved, hands are tied with rusted wire
Gasping sounds thickens the air, acid melts the eyes

Blinded by the lights, flesh bleeds by the hour
Atomic eruption detoxing your brain

Smell of rotten meat, makes your veins cold
Pain exceeds the toleration point
Swallow pills to dwell all suffering
Deatholation calms the air
Extermination of silence
Make an army of the damaged
Call upon the sheep of God
