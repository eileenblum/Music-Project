Heavy lust stands tall
And angel's blood's raining down
Heaven's black, and hell is blurry
I see clearly through my victims eyes

Gore infested tortured mind
Howling froth will gasp on time
Sodomize and self-endure
Rape the future, smite the injured

Hollow mind and endless rage
Tolerate no cure to plague
Ridicule the last salvation
Cut away from flesh
Forcefed on the skin and bones
The dead are once more rising
Calling from the tomb
I sit on my blood red throne

Taste so fresh, i cannot deny
Forthcoming of declaration
Burning skulls, self victimize
Settlement of faithless lives
Follow me into the abyss
Crush all that comes
To close to the sacrament
Savage tribute stands dement
March of the undying
Splits the ground
Calling from the graves

The end has now begun
No hope for the victim as the kill is done
Wrath is descending as i force my self to come

The dead are rising
Bury me bury me please
I bow in mercy and cover her face with dirt
No insanity will ever explain the things i do
I just listen to the voices
And all the shit they tell me to

All the tears my offerings share
I use to breed my garden of despair
I plant the seed in dirt of the dead
And i cut the leafs from the rotting heads

Hollow mind and endless rage
Tolerate no cure to plague
Ridicule the last salvation
For the last interpretation
Cutting through the flesh
Forcefed on the skin of bones
The dead are once more rising
I sit on my blood red throne

Flesh so fresh, i deny,
Forthcoming of reckless lies
Skulls burn, victimize
March of the undead
