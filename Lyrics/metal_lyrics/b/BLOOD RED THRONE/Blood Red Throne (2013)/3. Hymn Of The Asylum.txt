Execration's all i know
Staring at the blackend hole
Locked in this demonic force
Everyday i detest them more

Why is it wrong to be a serial killer?
Why should someone decide
Who gets to stay alive?

Screaming of hate to lure my enemies in
I want to see the bleeding begin
Solitary trapped inside
Forced insane with illusions of truth

Why is it wrong to be a serial killer?
Why should someone say who stays alive?

No sledge no bones can get through to them
You go insane as i rip out your hair
Schizophrenic doors are opened
Uncovers only walls of despair

Why is it wrong to be a serial killer?
Why should anyone ever stay alive?
Solitude they scream for mercy
Burning Gods warm the hollow mind
Screaming of hate to lure my enemies in
Let my bloody future begin
