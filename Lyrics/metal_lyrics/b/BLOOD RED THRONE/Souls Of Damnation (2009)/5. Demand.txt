Manipulate the beast, serving, control
Swallow the praise of dirt
Salvation for me

There is no such thing as salvation

Chaos supreme...
Cut out my tongue, and I will tell you the truth
It grabs me, it makes me remember the devil...
The curse stands as a monument In time, forever...
These are the skulls of tomorrow

Kill... fade away
And once again
I use my knife,
This time I cut your bone.
Your flesh falls to the ground.
Your blood hits my eyes.
I crawl inside your head, bringing out your dead.

Watch them cry
22 days of struggle.
Praise, fight, desire, demand

And we bring you the glory
The throne will never fall...
No longer dead.

Manipulate the beast
Serving, control
Swallow the praise of dirt
Salvation for me

And we bring you the glory
The Throne will never fall
No longer dead
