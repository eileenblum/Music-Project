Cheerful screams under the evening sun
A happy family out on picnic fun
Morning breeze brings the stench of death
Mutilated carcasses and rotten flesh

Unaware that death is at door
The family of four are victims of gore
Stuck their heads down into the food basket
They were found in caskets

Jack throws acid on their youngest son
A fucked up view on what is fun
He stuff her mouth full of glass
Then looks around because she is not going to last
She chokes on blood, which means
Two down and two to go

Mutilated carcasses - day of the dead
Sliced up into human filet
Gauging eyes - Black to the blind
Death - the meaning of life

Daddy dearest who loved his wife
Now lay on the ground non so vile

Jack dresses up the youngest one
Turn her into an innocent looking nun
Under the burning sun
He rapes her to death - just for fun
