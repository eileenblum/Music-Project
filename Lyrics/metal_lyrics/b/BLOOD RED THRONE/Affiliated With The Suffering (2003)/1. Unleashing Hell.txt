Chaos uprising
Unleashing hell
Human waste
The will of the few
Will dominate the many
Human flesh
Scattered remains

From the sky above
A lethal force of mass destruction
Is casted upon the flesh
That lie below

Devastation unleashed
Fuel to the internal fire
A will of stronghold
And unquestionable belief

Life means nothing
Only the religious belief
Into oblivion
With the deceased

Another martyr screams
Faith in the unseen
Dying for their moral stupidity
The gods are preparing a human feast

The end complete
Peace retrieved
Law forces upon the free
Extreme measure
For the extreme at heart
The flesh always summons pain

From the sky above
A lethal force of mass destruction
Is casted upon the flesh
Unleashing hell below
