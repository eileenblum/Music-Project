Armoured invader
Superior machine
Crushing its oponents
Battlefield screams

A blaze in the sky
Roar of thunder
Flames of hunger
Devour the spirit of war

"only the dead will be ignored"

Machine gun fire
Penetrating, tissue ripped apart
Pulverized

"death will take us back for more"

Hiding in a pile of dead
Trying to escape the madness
Engine accelerate
Crushed into the dirt (earth)

Chaos rising
Approaching war
Among the living
Cruelty exceed

Gather the dead
As far as (I) the eye can see
Chaos rising
Battlefield screams

A blaze in the sky
Roar of thunder
Flames of hunger
Devour the spirit of war

Machine gun fire
Penetrating
Tissue ripped apart
pulverized
