I recall waking up
Shivering of some kind of hunger
Soaked in blood and confused
But with a strange feeling
Of having been amused

Unbearable screams from across the room
Nightmare of somekind confirmed so soon
This pisses me off
Why wont they die?
I fucked them up bad
Even cut out their eyes

Bleeders lament
Bleeders lament
Bleeders lament
Bleeders lament

Enraged by disgust
I abuse them again
Then forcing them down in their own blood to drown

Finally death is overcoming
Fragmental pictures comes to mind
Clusters of gluttoning maggots
Remains in chains

Severed hands crushed by a tools impact
Pile of dead humans,
None of them intact

Bleeders lament
Bleeders lament
Bleeders lament
Bleeders lament

Enraged by disgust
I abuse them again
Then forcing them down in their own blood to drown
