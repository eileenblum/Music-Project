A Dream of Death!
The sound of shovelled earth
A Dream of Death!
Distant voices can still be heard

I open my eyes
But I cannot see
I scream unstrained
But I cannot breath

Slowly choking
Six feet under
A last gasp of breath
Life fade away

I am living dead
Eternal sleep
Buried alive
In the light I never see

Agonizing silence
Buried with the book of lies
Descriptions of evil
Liberated from instinct dictation

Casket walls are coming down
Crushed under solid ground
Living the pain
I am destined to die

Time melt away
Reanimated Corpse
I slowly rot
Beyond the suffering
Memories remain
In my distorted inner self
But the bad dreams stay the same

A Dream of Death!
Buried alive

A Dream of Death!
Six feet under

A Dream of Death!
I smell death around me

A Dream of Death!
Maggots inside me
