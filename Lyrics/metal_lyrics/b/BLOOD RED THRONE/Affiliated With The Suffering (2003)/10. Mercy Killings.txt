[DigiPak Bonus]

Morning dew
Covering the blood soaked ground
Rotting corpses lying all around
Where dying screams roamed before
Is now replaced with deathlike silence
Bodies ripped to the core

Ravens gather
For a massive feast
Aiming for the eyes
The soul they hope to capture

Offer grounds - fields of death
Unholy scripts &amp; cryptic Signs
A cult of menace
A menace to life

Nocturnal summoning
Await the sign
Once the target is assassinated
Heading for the offer grounds

Ravens gather

A masqurade of grand infernale
Summoning the serpent
To witness a new massacre

Feasting the flesh
A bitter sweet dream
And no regret
Painted like death
They gather for attack

Blood covered hands
Full moon witnesses
Abuse of the deceased
Carved into their flesh
