Hordes in pace! 
In a quest to crush all life
A malignant human sacrifice
My needs of death has not yet been fullfilled
therefore i command you invigorated man,
woman, child and beast;

Come forth! 
Become as one and join
my indisputable hordes of darkness
let us seek out,
man and beast
to create a lifeform of pure evil

Let us seek out
man and beast
human life blood 
will start to freeze
as we gather for attack
to create a lifeform 
of pure evil

Legions, attack! 
Beyond the fall of night
The book of lost tales, 
the book of the dead 
will set forth the second coming 
and the end of time

So, i welcome you worshipper of death
to the world beyond, 
to days that can never return
for i have such sights to show you...

Hordes in pace! 
In a quest to crush all life
My needs of death has not yet been fullfilled
therefore i command you invigorated man,
woman, child and beast;

Sacrifice take place
a stream of blood
a revival of my powers
until the prophecy come true
and the spell has been abolished
to revoke my spirit
i will live
