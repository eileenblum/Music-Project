Open the gates stormbringer
From the great dark beyond
Tides of darkness
blasphemous onslaught
before the coming of the age of chaos

Charge!
with weapons drawn in anger
war! war machine!
Diabolical killing fields

The curtain never fall
i slay thee weak human - i crush thy hypocrite

buried deep - beneath the ocean, 
dark and ruined - still breathing
pulsing with lifeblood - of the earth itself

I am of killers breed
spawned from demon seed

now the dove of peace lies dead
i will bleed you dry
I put your flesh to fire
i cleanse the world
with destruction and desire

The saviour damned my birth
the tempter unleashed me onto earth
From the darkest pits of hell
i am summoned to enchant heaven or hell

Open the gates stormbringer
From the great dark beyond
Tides of darkness
blasphemous onslaught
before the coming of the age of chaos

Charge!
with weapons drawn in anger
war! war machine!

i am darkness incarnate
i will not be denied
I am of killers breed
spawned from demon seed
