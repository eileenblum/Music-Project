A blaze of fire, 
Days of the damned
Rituals of the ancient
Summoned in my darkest dreams

The people of a blood God
Revoking the demons from beyond
possessed by blood lust
temptation of eternal life
drink of blood, life from death

Alone in the dark
Awakened by the call
Trapped inside this tomb of mine
I pray for my existance
Around my soul, inside the body, seeds of horror grow
Suffocation of my soul, 

The dark passages i follow
Kiss of the serpent
Recantation of my soul
led to the blood throne

Altar of blood, monument of death

Trapped - in bloodlust grief
Strapped - to the altar of bloody deeds
Impaled - throne of stone
Nailed - invade my soul!
