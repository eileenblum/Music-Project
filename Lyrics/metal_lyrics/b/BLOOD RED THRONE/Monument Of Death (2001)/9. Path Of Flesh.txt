I stalk my prey at night
I have the look of death in my eye
I follow your every move
Waiting for you with my killing tools

Let me taste your bittersweet flesh
Let me show you what life brings next
Teeth sinks into flesh, closing in on death
Taste the blood of the dead

I lay you down on the ground
I strip you to the core, blood will soon spit from every pore
I watch in ecstasy, my victims caressed by fear
Naked skin, begs me to commit another sin

I take another walk down the path of Flesh
Looking for a fresh kill

Skinned alive
Body limbs rearranged
soul cleansed by victims weep

I will die in hell
