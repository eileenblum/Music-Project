I am the wanderer, i am the lie
I bring famine, and i kill all life
I sweep across the land
I walk the dead earth

The children shall Endure

I am as old as time
I am of lust and sin
I am invoked by bloodthirst
I rule the underworld

The children shall Endure

And to be remembered,
Silent screams are never heard

I am mystery, i am truth
I am the tale you wished you never heard

My dark shadow dwell 
in the darkest pits of hell
I am the propechy of a dying world
I am vengeance, i am wrath
I am the seven Death sins
Come walk my path
