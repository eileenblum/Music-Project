Suspended animation
In cold obstruction
Pronounced dead
Practice defilation
Rotting fate lies ahead
Suffocation throes until death

Boxed up and archived
Put on display
Still hearing everything
Consider what you say!

Funeral procession
The bells toll for me
Lowered to sleep
To never be free
Total blackness
Forced into the earth
Entombed obscurity
Anxiety wrath

Absence of sound
My cold heartthrob
I'm on my own
My eyes wide open
I try to move
Scratch and holler
Panic improve...
The air gets thinner

I'm served as dinner
For maggots bleak
Buried alive
Earths caress
State of mind
State of darkness!
