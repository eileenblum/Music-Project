A bizarre mess of a humanoid hanging from his face by hooks
Hanging by his mouth from a device
Whose purpose is beyond the human comprehension?
In his genius perversity he created an external womb for himself

A semi-translucent bang hung from the lower portion of his abdomen
A fetus in between his legs where his genitals should be
The pain was excruciating
A vicious hallucinogen

Inhuman bloodlust
Being all the more grotesque
With an obscure spine-like piece
Disgorged onto the ground amongst the corpses
Running up to connect various tubes going into himself
His facial expression and eyes are painful
A sickening creature to behold

A large cavity of organs where it appears flesh has been torn
With no remains of normal genitalia
Discovering the worst pain imaginable
His back has been split wide
