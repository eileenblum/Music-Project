Blood spattered patterns of perpetual sin
Traces of orgasms spat from within
I tear you open to ecstatic display
Sweet taste of arterial spray
Blood frenzied perversion course through my veins
Haemorrhage maniac driven insane
Slit your wrists with a rusty barbed wire
The sight of blood takes my ecstasy higher

Filthfucking deathcore, pulsecutting whore
Tear liar slut! Arterial lust!

Depraved from dignity
Blood dimmed clarity
Demonic deprivation
Sexual amputation
I rip off my blood-soaked garments
Portray as the ultimate tyrant
I make you scream, I make you bleed
Trapped little lapdog, won't help to plead

A well-placed incision to see
Underneath red vessels are whole
My lust and desire squirting at me
I smear myself with warm life liquid
Plant my seeds of sickened hybrid
Disemboweled lifeless beauty
My fantasies, your duty
