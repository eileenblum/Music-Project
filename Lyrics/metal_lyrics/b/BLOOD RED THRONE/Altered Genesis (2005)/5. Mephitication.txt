Demiurge, I ate your first flesh
And in rapture I descended upon you
Consumed all self-composed illusions
Infesting what's left for all to breathe

Decadent human birth
Frantic mutilation
Injected with needles
Converted to vile
Flesh decomposed with infected bile
Devoured from inside
Mouth filled with froth
Face pealed in agony when spasms contort

Soaked in urine
Immense seizure crawl
Alive and rotting
But still able to breath
Humanoid virus

Hangar gates open
Transported inside
Gliding in pain among tanks that surrounds you
Lowered into the body slide

Skull and chest punctured with metallic probes
Consciousness preserved in chemical solution
Un-dead device for mephitic deeds
Embalmed atrocity
Contamination seeds

Demiurge, I ate your first flesh
And in rapture I descended upon you
Consumed all self-composed illusions
Infesting what's left for all to breathe
Devoured from inside
Mouth filled with froth
Face pealed in agony when spasms contort
