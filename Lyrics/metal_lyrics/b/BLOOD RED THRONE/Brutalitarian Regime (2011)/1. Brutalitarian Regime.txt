Nearby 5 decades have passed since the fall of justice
Innocents flogged on the altar of zion
Barbarian hordes in their US-sanctioned armor
Murdering the indigenous for more places to worship

Neo-gestapo builds ghettos and walls
Black widow cry out in despair
Children burning â screaming
The temple must fall

Self-righteous snake in a pit of lions
Praising their twelve tribes of shame
Burn the flames of salvation
Annihilate the cancerous land

Sink the ashes in the red sea
Build a new with stone and steel
Destruction of the hexagram
And all its followers
Brutalitarian begime
