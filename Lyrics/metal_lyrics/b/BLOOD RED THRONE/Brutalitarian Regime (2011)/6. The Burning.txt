Fuel aided fire, burning flame
The heat fucks you up drives you insane
Gasoline and lighter fluid works the same
A splash and a spark, liquid flesh
Human torch, fire puts you to rest

Motherfucker, burn!
Light my goddamn fire, bitch!

Hiding makes no use, I will find and abuse
Fright in your eyes, like (star) sparkles in my sky
Starting with your feet, stench of death
Petrified body puts me to the test
Your soul scream for mercy but life is long gone

I work up an excitement, feel aroused
Death is coming, it makes me proud
Store another gallon, (to) keep me excited
I burn my own flesh, it keeps me coming
The hunter is on the hunt againâ¦
With gas I mark my victims with an X!
