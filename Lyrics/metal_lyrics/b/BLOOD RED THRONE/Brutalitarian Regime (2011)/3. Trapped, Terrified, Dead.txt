â¦and just like that it was all gone
Tomorrow never comes, they say
Struggle to reach the top
Someone shall die because of this
Come to me my slave
Feel my eyes burning through your metal skin

The throne has been unleashed
No prayers
No filthy books
âThe sacrifice will now proceedâ
âRemove his kneesâ

You failed even to rest in peace
I will hunt you down
Over and over again
I will enjoy every move you make
When youâre trying to find a way out
I shall laugh in your face when you realize
That this room was made for you
The weakness and the strength in your body
Are built into the walls

Trapped
Terrified
Dead
