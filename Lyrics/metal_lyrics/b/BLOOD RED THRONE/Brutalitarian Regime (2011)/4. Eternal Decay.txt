Broken bones and melted skin
Youâre teasing me bitch
Pleasing my eyes
Do you recallâ¦

Do you recall, the pitiful life
Searching for answers, skimming the lies
(Now) lying before me, the truth is clear:
Only escape is passing the gateâ¦
My hate â your faith, the truth is dead
Youâre my creation, my passion, my urge
Fulfilling my dreams, my sick twisted needs.
Burning and bleeding (and) screaming my name

A visual trophy, a living remain
Endless sufferingâ¦eternal decayâ¦

The tale of the light never ends
The perfect creature that has never been seen
So what is the color of my mind?

Masters of oldâ¦
You burned my templeâ¦
Wounds wide openâ¦
Blood of the dead never gets coldâ¦
