This triangle, for what use ? Colours no longer exist. Sick minds erased them.
Lack of respect for humanity. We walk away from this process that makes you.
You can no longer decide when to sleep.
You are no longer in control - so afraid, this hole was... Deeper.
Nothing I can say will make you feel... Cause I can't die in this place.
You can't live in this place. I can see it in your scared face.

There will be no new beginning 'cause you are fake.
Can't you see ? Is this how you want it to be ?
Show me his face and he will never be.
Able to see ever again.

Epidemic; human, inhale the toxic.
The great aim.
Clones; the one brain.
There will be no new beginning. Cause you are fake, an imitation of the falsification, just like your ancestors.
Clones; the one brain.
In honour of an unknown relic.
In anticipation of the malice.
My like minded creature.
