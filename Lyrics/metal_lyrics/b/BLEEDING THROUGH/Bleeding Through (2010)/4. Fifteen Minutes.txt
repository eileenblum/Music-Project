Deceiver, your left with nothing but neglect
I want the sun to burn out like the beating heart left in your chest
Disgust, do you ever feel that you're betrayed?
Or are you just pathetic like the empty souls you pissed away?

Is this really what you wanted from us?
Something real, something flesh and blood
Humanity is a wasteland of shallow traitors
You'll soon be one of them, you're one of them
Another traitor just like them
Salvation, give back the years I left behind for deception
We were the quick fix, you needed to make yourself numb
From all of your insecurities and worthlessness

Is this really what you wanted?
Something pure, something skin and bone
The human race,  a cheap imitation that you have bought and sold
I've wasted all these years for you, from this shelter, from myself
I have nothing left to prove, just choke on emptiness

Fifteen minutes of fame has come to a pass
And now I've got 1 million reasons to make this fucking last
I swear to God I'll wreck your world
So I swear to God I'll destroy your world

[Solo]

Is this really what you wanted?
Something pure, something skin and bone
The human race,  a cheap imitation that you have bought and sold
I've wasted all these years for you, from this shelter, from myself
I have nothing left to prove, just choke on emptiness

[Solo]

I'll fucking ruin your life
So sing to me like you mean this
I'll fucking ruin your life
So you better scream like you feel this
