Nothing is over, you just can't turn it off
Nothing is over, you just can't make me stop
I've faced the ugly truth motivated by negative disdain
Nothing is over, you just can't turn this off

Hold onto the darkness, the worst is charging forth
Lifeless and cold, exhale this smoke and mirrors
Wrath of lies are being told, how much more can I disagree?
Breed this army of slaves to lead them to their fucking knees
You're not alive, another product of humanities greed
One nation breathing in fear

You can't ignore what you can't understand
People hate what they can't conquer
Take the devils hand
So much more I can despise
I was never good enough for you, see the weakness in your eyes
I'll struggle for this one more time

Nothing is over, you just can't turn it off
Nothing is over, you just can't make me stop
I've faced the ugly truth motivated by negative disdain
Nothing is over

Hold onto the darkness, the worst is charging forth
Lifeless and cold, exhale this smoke and mirrors
Wrath of lies are being told, how much more can I disagree?
Breed this army of slaves to lead them to their fucking knees
You're not alive, another product of humanities greed
One nation breathing in fear

I was never weak enough for your standards, your status quo, your life
I won't bow down to your ego, in my eyes your not even alive

[Solo to fade]
