Prepare your weapons to destroy their culture
Impair the process of their beating hearts
Avoid humanities glamour

We are the damned, worshipping the notion of an empty sky
We are the starving millions, begging for immunity from this disease
We are the damned
We are the starving millions
We will impair their process, we will destroy their culture

Don't believe everything you see
Question authority and everything you read
And don't be content with their standards
Tear down the statue of progress, piece by piece
And we'll stomp out the weak
Stifle the fortunate of society
Press their eyes into the back of their skulls
Make them suffer, make them bleed

[Solo]

Silence their voices
Prove them wrong and rip out their hearts
Never forget what you stand for
Always fight for who you are

Do you regret what you're feeling?
Haunted by the sorrows that plague your mind
I know how these walls can just cave in and what it takes to breathe just to stay alive

We are the damned,
We are the starving millions,
We will impair their process, we will destroy their culture

We crawl through life just to rot
Try to impress and be something that we are not
Feed us obsession, force it into our mouths
Reverse the role, leave them gagged and bound

And we'll stomp out the weak
Stifle the fortunate of society
Press their eyes into the back of their skulls
Make them suffer, make them bleed

[Solo 2]

Silence their voices
Prove them wrong and rip out their hearts
Never forget what you stand for
Always fight for who you are

Do you regret what you're feeling?
Haunted by the sorrows that plague your mind
I know how these walls can just cave in and what it takes to breathe just to stay alive
