I'm afraid this exposure has finally burnt my soul tonight
Nothing, you are nothing to me but an infection inside of me just waiting to die

Now I've pounded these moments into dust
Virgin minds left to kill, souls to corrupt
Nothing to show but delusional
Thoughts and dreams that I've sold to the world
One day you'll wake-up, change your reflection and forget everything that you've heard

Now I've buried emotion into the ground
Sacrificed half my life for salvation that will not be found
Now I'm shedding my skin and walking away
Release me from this prison, I'll turn away

I have nothing more to give, nothing left to bleed
The failing look in your eyes, the dying belief in me
I'll end this all and take it back
