I wish you could shut your mouth forever
Your self-confidence is infecting the sky
How does it feel to be the virus?
The spit in the face to the world that you left behind
And I don't want to care anymore
Kill this life of digression
Sacrificing moments of grace to shatter the memory of you

Do you neglect your life? Neglect yourself?
Are you content to live with failure or pray for something else?
I am your regret, your sense of loss, your abandonment
Emotionless life, resist temptation to reach out
Won't be your saviour to smash your doubts
I am your abandonment, refuse the urge to bleed out
I am not your fucking hope

Why can't you close your eyes forever?
Your self arrogance is polluting the sky
How does it feel to be the virus?
The dirt in the face to the life that you left behind
And I don't want to care anymore
Kill this life of digression
Sacrificing moments of grace to shatter the memory

I've been dying to just let you bleed
Nothing more between you and me
Embrace the distance

[Solo]

Do you neglect your life? Neglect yourself?
Are you content to live with failure or pray for something else?
I am your regret, your sense of loss, your abandonment
Emotionless life, resist temptation to reach out
Won't be your saviour to smash your doubts
