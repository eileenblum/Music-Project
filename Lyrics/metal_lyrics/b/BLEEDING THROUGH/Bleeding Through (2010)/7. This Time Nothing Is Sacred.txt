Am I not presentable for you?
Do I not represent what you thought you knew?
No, no longer care
No, I don't believe our friendship was sacred and meant anything

So what's your reasons for burning me alive?
Looking back I fail to see
Do you remember starvation and sleepless nights?
well I guess that it ceased to mean a goddamn thing

Give me a reason to finally throw you away
I thought this blood would be thicker
Nothing left for you to say
Your nothing more than a face I used to know
This time I, I'll erase all the memories of you
This time I, I'll push you out of my fucking heart

I was never good enough for you
I don't admire all the things that you do
No, no longer care
No, I don't believe the bond that we shared meant nothing

So what's your reasons for burning me alive?
Looking back I fail to see
Do you remember starvation and sleepless nights?
well I guess that it ceased to mean a goddamn thing

Give me a reason to finally throw you away
I thought this blood would be thicker
Nothing left for you to say
This time I, I'll erase all the memories
This time I, will push you out of my fucking heart
