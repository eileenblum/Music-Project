You think you've reached the bottom
Much more to lose
Embrace the seconds
They will turn their backs on you

Reflect
Replace
Destroy
Erase them all

Always the savor the taste
This may be the last you will get

You cannot conquer the worldÂ 
Without your soul

Every step now coming closer
Reaching closer to your doomÂ 
The light keeps flickering out now

You will never shake the bitterness
Now that you have hit the end
No more to life
Remember the secondsÂ 
Broken Dreams trapped in timeÂ
