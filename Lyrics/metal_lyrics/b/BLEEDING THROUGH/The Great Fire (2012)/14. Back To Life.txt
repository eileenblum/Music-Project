Let me be the judge of this
Fourteen years of mistakes and regret
Now finally I have realized
You never truly cared
Used my words for a crutch
For your utter worthlessness

And silently you crawl
And now silently you crawl

Now silently you crawl
Through regression
I'll forget every moment we shared (we fucking shared)

Come back to life
And return to this earth

No longer will you abuse this life
And all the faces you left behind (you left behind)

Now moving slowly
And you will gain the strenth
To confront all your demons

Still silently you crawl
Through regret
I'll erase everything we shared (we ever shared)

Now moving slow
You'll gain the strength
To confront all your demons

Come back to life
And return to this earth
