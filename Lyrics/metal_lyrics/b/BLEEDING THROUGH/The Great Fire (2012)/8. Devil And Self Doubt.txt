How much more can you claim to care
About a lifestyle so unforgivable
Voices so insincere
What have yo done for them lately?

Whore yourself for no sacrifice
Your belief in a fake sense of worth
Soon you will be left with nothing

Soulless and alone
So much more you can claim to change
Erase this balance that made yo invincibleÂ 

Reality is turning cold
Another breath you will waste for them
Another life you will waste just for them

Now you are alone again
Reaching for your faith
Accept your fate
