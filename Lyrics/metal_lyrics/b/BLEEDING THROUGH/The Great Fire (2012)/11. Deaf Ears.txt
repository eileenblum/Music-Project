God save me
I'm standing on the wrong side
But if this means I'll burn in hell
I'd rather fight and die

The purest disgust
Everything you touch turns to waste
Beneath this sense of purpose
The truth is oblivious

So fight me
I'm standing right in front of you
But you're too fucking scared
Live your life as a target of distrust
Just another target of distrust

Now pass the blame
Point your finger at the world
For your misfortunes

Take a look in the mirror at yourself
Instead of running from your problems
Take the beating heart from your chest
Erase your identity of sorrow

God save me
I'm standing on the wrong side
But if this means I'll burn in hell
I'd rather fight and die

The purest disgust
Everything you touch turns to waste
Beneath this sense of purpose
This truth is oblivious

So fight me
I'm standing right in front of you
But you're too fucking scared
Live your life as a target of distrust
Just another target of distrust

Now pass the blame
Point your finger at the world
For your misfortunes

Take a look in the mirror at yourself
Instead of running from your problems
Take the beating heart from your chest
Erase your identity of sorrow
