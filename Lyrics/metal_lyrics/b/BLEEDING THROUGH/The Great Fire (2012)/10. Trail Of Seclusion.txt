One last cold embrace
Show me we won't die for nothing
All the blood that spilled from my heart
Sinks down the drain of seclusion

I'll never forget this (never forget)
Disappointment engraved into my memories
I still have no regrets
For anything I said
No regrets for a single word I've said

I see through what this all meant
The lack of heart and the fear of abandonment
So lets hear it for the less fortunate
This bitterness and the weight of my regret

So give me one more embrace
Show me that this meant something
Or was it just a waste of time?

Prove it now or you'll die with nothing

I'll never forget this (never forget)
Disappointment engraved into my memories
I still have no regrets
For anything I said
No regrets for a single word I've said

I see through what this all meant
The lack of heart and the fear of abandonment
So lets hear it for the less fortunate
This bitterness and the weight of my regret

Prove it now or you'll die with nothing
