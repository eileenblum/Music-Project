Just let there be silence
When this is over let the vultures starve to death
Let there be justice
On the devoted who believed then turned their backs

I won't make anything better
I'm only here to ruin your life
Still here to ruin your life

I'm not your savior
Don't confide in me your willing minds
I'll only corrupt them
Set you on a path
Make you destroy

I won't make anything better
I'm only here to ruin your life
Things will never get better
No hope for your worthless life

One day you will die on your own
Dwell in the darkness you wait alone
Right here is a moment in time
One day we forget
And go on with our lives

On with our lives
