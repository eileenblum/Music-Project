Enough is enough
One by one you have failed each other
Betrayed everyone
Betrayed yourself

You left us here to rot
Now one by one
I'm hunting for you

All the promises you'll never keep
Set aflame to all that remains

One be oneÂ 
I know your dreamÂ 
I'll smash them allÂ 
One by one
I'll bury your industryÂ 

One by oneÂ 

Again and again
Make the rounds
Smell blood in the water

You stalk your prey
Nothing more than selfish intention
