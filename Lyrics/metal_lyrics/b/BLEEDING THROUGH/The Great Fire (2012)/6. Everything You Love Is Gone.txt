Everything that you ever lovedÂ 
Died before your eyes
Now you're always fucking scared
You're living someone else's lie

And now this burning feeling
That rips away and destroys your flesh

To mask your insecuritiesÂ 
A new fame inching closer
To your last fucking breath

And now you're too scared
I know your just scared

Now you dwell on this sinking feeling
Only absence in belief in yourself
Someone else keeps pulling your strings

Cowardly weep your time has run out
