Test your belief
In what you claim to be committed
And all the while a bond you'll lose
So just admit it

I was here before you
Now I will watch you fall to your knees
Begging for forgiveness

A false sign
A crutch in which you used to judge everyone
And put yourself on a pedestal

You will break the edge and the life of failure
So meaningless
An oath that made you a liar

I was here before you
Now I will watch you fall to your knees
Begging for forgiveness

A false sign
A crutch in which you used to judge everyone
And put yourself on this pedestal

What if I wasn't
What the fuck would you do?
Walk away son, nothing more to prove.

Nailed to the X for most of my life
Who the fuck are you?
Step the fuck back in line
