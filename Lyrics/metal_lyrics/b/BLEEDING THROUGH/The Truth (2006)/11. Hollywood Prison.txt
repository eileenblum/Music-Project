Go!
Since you left you've found myself locked in another prison.
But your bars and chains can't take the heart out of this man.
Without you my skies are always gray.
Now I'm seeing red through a different face.

What can I say that hasn't been said before?
I wrote your name in blood on my prison walls.
And without your contact those memories are all I have so I can't feel alone.
I'll never be alone.
The chemicals aren't aligned.
Now I'm struggling to find your fucking spine.
I'll rip out your spine.

You can take my pain.
But you can't have my heart.
You can lock me in this cold dark cell.
But you can't have my heart.
