We're hated. We're bleeding. We've loving. You're losing.
Our lives are all about to change.
We're hated. We're bleeding. We've loving. You're losing.
Our lives are all about to change.
There go the lights. To the world I've made in my head.
I'll make the stand. I'll scratch out my eyes.
I won't stop till you are dead.

I hope that and pray that one day you will realize.
You were always my biggest inspiration.
The pain you've caused has built who I've become.
Now we might as be strangers.
Won't be a corpse so you can drag your dead.
Ive been blessed by the fires. By the fires of your hell.
There go the lights. To the world I've made in my head.
I'll make the stand. I'll scratch out my eyes.
I won't stop till you are dead.
