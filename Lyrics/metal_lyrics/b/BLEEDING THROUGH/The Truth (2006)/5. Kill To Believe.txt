Now what do you want from me?
When I've sacrificed my heart so you can be set free
And time will never cure this disease
I'm only left with tired arms to stop from drowning

This is loveless
Your love is hopeless

Do you remember
On that night I couldn't find the words to say I'm sorry
If you recall that night you ripped my heart right out
Before saying I loved you Do you believe in this
Do you believe in me
If you believe in love
Would you believe in me

So what will you take from me
I'm the man without a soul a soul for you to seek
And time will never cure your disease
I'm only left with
Tired arms to stop from drowning.

This, This is loveless
Love, Your love is hopeless

Do you remember
On that night I couldn't find the words to say I'm sorry
If you recall that night you ripped my heart right out
Before saying I loved you
Do you believe in this
Do you believe in me
If you believed in love
Would you believe in me

Believe in me
I've emptied my soul
Believe in me
I've killed this disease now
Time to shatter your heart
Bring you to your knees
I've found the strength to fight on
And stop the bleeding

And I stop the bleeding

Do you remember
On that night I couldn't find the words to say I'm sorry
If you recall that night you ripped my heart right out
Before saying I loved you
Do you believe in this
Do you believe in me
If you believed in love
You're killing, you're not the same to me now
Got to kill to believe
