I don't give a fuck
I'm not afraid of the worst
I'm the sheep who lost his way
Still looking for it everyday
I'll face neglect every curse you wish to throw at me
Without trying I would never fail and I fell in love with failure

I can't see through your eyes
What do you see a disgrace another lie
Today I'll start being perfect. Cut you open to expose your insides
Cut you open expose your insides

I know
I'm still counting scares from every time you cried
And I remember the first time you died
Tonight I want to bleed along with you
Here's to craving everything you do

Know and I'm taking you on
And I'm taking you on cause I got nothing left to prove to you
I got nothing left to prove to you
I've got nothing left to prove
