Give up your heartache
Build your weapon to destroy them all
We have been stabbed to death
Now our hearts are replaced with this hole

Eye for an eye. Eye for an eye
Life for a life
Eye for an eye

Together we are as one
The broken and the heartless
Destroy hypocrisy to eliminate the weak
Behind every plastic smile is the blood of humanity
We are the prophets of the night
And we will rise at our given time

Eye for an eye.
A life for a life
Eye for an eye

[Chorus:]
Walk among the hopless souls
We are coming for you
We are armed to the teeth
Ghost of invincibility
We're coming for you
Dearly Demented

The holes in our chest mark our bravery of slaves fighting for your life.
We are whores
The condemned
'Cause someone else once held our heart

Your broken heart, my broken Heart
Your broken hand, your broken heart

Eye for an eye.
A life for a life
Eye for an eye

[Chorus]

We are the prohets of the night.
Eye for an eye.
We fight this fight for the hopeless romantic
Life for a life
We take this on for the battered and broken
Eye for an eye
We fight the fight for the hopeless romantic
Life for a life
For those who felt liek they wernt good enough
And I felt that way
And we all felt that way
Now we are rising up in numbers
And we will No Longer Be Slaves

[Chorus]
