I will always feel. And I will always care
I wish she was my enemy
But I'm still waiting here for her to hold my hand
For her to steal my breath
For her to pick up the pieces of promises never kept
She moves in slow motion.
Sonically as the rain.

As the rain falls down.
Everything is still as she moves to me.
Stands still.
Maybe I'll do better on my own
Why does everything disappear?
When all I see is you alone...

And her love moves slowly
This time now I'm dying for you to call my name
I'm waiting. Still Fading
So tell me I'm not alone
I'm still waiting
I'm still fighting

Wake me from this sleep
So I can begin living
Or give me the solution
So I can start dying
Will I start living, or start dying?
Maybe I'll do better on my own
Why does everything disappear
When all I see is you alone
And her love moves slowly
This time now I'm dying for you to call my name
I'm waiting. Still fading
So tell me I'm not alone...
