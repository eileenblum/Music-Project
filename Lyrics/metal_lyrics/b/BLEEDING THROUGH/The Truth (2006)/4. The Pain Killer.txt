It's been three fucking days since sleep has taken me away
I found the remedy to erase you from my head
I can't find a pulse to feel this
I'll never feel again
So say your last goodbyes and I'm taking back my sins
I'll take back the heart I should have never let, never let you in.
So say your last goodbyes, today I'm not coming back
I won't crawl back again
I never loved you
I never cared.
I never loved you.

You won't fuck the life from me again
Now your hands are filthy with narcissistic identities
A slave another junkie, you're haunting the streets
You're looking to feed
But I won't be your carcass,
You cant add me to your pile of dead bodies
I'm driving the nails through your hands
So you can't fuck the life out of me
You won't fuck the life out of me
You can't fuck the life out of me
I never loved You
You can't fuck the life out of me
You won't fuck the life out of me.
