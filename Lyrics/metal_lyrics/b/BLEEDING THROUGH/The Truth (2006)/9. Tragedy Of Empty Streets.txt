Now buildings are starting to fall, bricks beginning to break.
Your steps are leaving cracks in the sidewalks leaving trials of empty streets.
And I'm going blind from staring at your eyes because they release the fire of a thousand suns, but I've become so numb I can barely shed a tear, even if you cut the strings that hold my head up.

You're pulling teeth, ripping flesh so you can lick the blood from your fingers, so brake these bones; taste my skin, let my death sing the end of it.
So you can do no more damage, so you collect no more trophies.
Let me be the last, let no one feel how I feel.
This tragedy began with me, so let it end with me.

From your hell I've become this numb and I wish this pain on no one, behind your smile, beneath your lungs, I hope your darkness comes
This tragedy began with me, so let it end with me.
I tried to be what you wanted me to be, and I'm sorry that I can never be perfect for you, but every time I look in the mirror I see your eyes starring back at me and I don't want it anymore.
Now buildings are starting to fall, bricks beginning to break.
Your steps are leaving cracks in the sidewalks leaving trials of empty streets.
You're pulling teeth, ripping flesh so you can lick the blood from your fingers, so brake these bones; taste my skin, let my death sing the end of it.
So you can do no more damage, so you collect no more trophies.
I hope your fucking happy.
