The line is being drawing through my heart
Where conciving fires through our thoughts
And you're just like me.
And you're just like me.

This is everything I wanted to tell you,
That I'm still in love with everything about you
And I feel the wreckage from everything you do,
And I'm tired of still waiting

If I told you the truth now would you still leave and take my heart?
And I still feel ugly but you're ugly just like me
If I showed you the truth now would you still leave?
Will you ever change?
But I still feel empty.
Will I always lose this game?

This is everything I wanted to show you,
I'm no longer scared of anything about you
I live through the damage of the heart you took from me
And I'm tired of still wanting.

[x2:]
If I told you the truth now would you still leave and take my heart?
And I still feel ugly but you're ugly just like me
If I showed you the truth now would you still leave?
Will you ever change?
But I still feel empty
Will I always lose this game?
