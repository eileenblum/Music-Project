just a papercut to spill your blood. just a papercut to spill your blood. i 
hear screams come out the window. maybe next time your caress won't feel like 
rusted nails. i am the son of rejection. so hold me to the light. tell me it's 
right to feel dead inside. i won't break, not today. i won't break, not today. 
dead like me. dead like me. because beneath this stare is a desperate fight 
to stay alive. tell me i'm not alone. whisper that breath that fuels this 
fight. from now on, this is my life. discontent for the rest of mankind. i'll 
always remember the way that touch felt and how i was so close. four seconds away 
from death. three seconds away from you. two seconds away from death. one 
second away from you. i won't break, not today. i won't break, not today. dead like 
me. dead like me. try to find reasons to resist, and i won't break, not 
today. try to find reasons to resist, and i won't break, not today. bring it. i 
look back on a broken mess. pictures shattered with shards of glass. this is what 
my life means to me. i look back on a broken mess. pictures shattered with 
shards of glass. this is what my life means to me. i won't break, not today. i 
won't break, not today. dead like me. dead like me.
