midnight, we kill. we slaughter the tongue of revolution. to our graves, we 
are marked by the stain of lust. how many times can i trust in you, my beloved 
friend? because every time i trust, i lose. so i believe in nothing, nothing. 
because of you, i still believe in nothing. because of you, i still believe in 
nothing. i'll always know my place in this world. no longer fit in your 
fucking world anymore. your lust ruins everything. like a growing target on my 
back, i feel the knives are chasing. see my eyes are no longer blind. see my eyes 
are no longer blind. there is a purpose in life today. destroying you every 
step of the way. from this point on - no more friends. i know my role in this 
world. don't fit in your fucking world. this once meant everything to me. now 
another forgotten effigy. because only scars remain. broken bones form a hope 
that's been left grey. i die every time i hear your fucking name. been left 
grey. been left grey. and there is a purpose in life today. rise to your feet, as 
we march to our graves. fight back. there is a purpose in life today. rise to 
your feet, as we march to our graves. i can still feel your thoughts ripping 
me apart, tearing me apart. ripping you apart. tearing us apart.
