Walk alone. i stare at the footprints of my life. and i think i lost you, 
when i began to run away. so far, so far away from home. your approval, was the 
only crown i seeked. i no longer doubt myself. too long, i've walked in shadows 
of my worst enemies. so was it worth the game to lose our purities? won't 
wear the crown of thorns. won't wear the mask of judas. i'll never be who you 
want me to be. you'll never see the beauty i see. mark me for death. mask me for 
torture. mark me for death. i stare at the footprints. and you, so far away. i 
no longer doubt myself. too long, i've walked in shadows of my worst enemies. 
so was it worth the game to lose our purities? won't wear the crown of 
thorns. won't wear the mask of judas. i'll never be who you want me to be. you'll 
never see the beauty i see. mark me for death. mask me for torture. mark me for 
death. mask me for torture. i hope you see my face on your fucking death bed. 
i hope you see my face on your death bed. you played the role of the angel, 
now you'll see my face in hell. you fooled my mind with your selfish ambition. 
bitch. you played the role of the angel, now you'll see my face in hell. you 
played the role, you played the role of the saint, now you'll see my face, my 
face in hell. walk alone. i stare at the footprints of my life. and i think i 
lost you, when i began to run away. so far, so far away from home. your 
approval, was the only crown i seeked. i no longer doubt myself. too long, i've walked 
in shadows of my worst enemies. so was it worth the game to lose our 
purities? won't wear the crown of thorns. won't wear the mask of judas. i'll never be 
who you want me to be. you'll never see the beauty i see.
