you are the fucking disease. another day, another memory. but i have fucking
failed. i turned another lie into the work of a saint. so where is the cure?
hundreds of souls with the look of horror on their face. now i rise from my
knees. i will not live in misery. you won't take me. you won't take me. now it's
me. now it's me. all that's left is a bitter taste of a life that was once so
promising. rather cut at the wrist than laugh about your mistakes. sickness
fills the air. another life that you wish you could fake. your eyes will cut
through me, but it's a risk, that i must fucking take. i must take. so where is
the cure? hundreds of souls with the look of horror on their face. now i rise
from my knees. i will not live in misery. you won't take me. you will not
destroy me. you cannot destroy me. and i'll fight you with every ounce of strength
i have left, and i'll seal it with a bullet and a kiss. so look at your
fucking horror. horror. i want to see your face. show me your true face. i want to
see your face. show me your true face. my heart belongs to you, so save me. my
heart belongs to you, so save me, for the sake to give it away. still beats,
still beats inside of me. my heart belogns to you, so save me. and my heart
still beats. and my heart still beats. my heart still beats, so save me. my heart
still beats.
