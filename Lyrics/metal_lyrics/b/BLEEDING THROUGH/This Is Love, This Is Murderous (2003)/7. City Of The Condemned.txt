it's fucking freezing outside because i saw you tonight and almost died. 
looks like i've seen too many winters in my mind. your stare is cold. you better 
turn and run away because you're the evil. we will keep on hunting you. 
killing. so what more do you want from me? we will carry the weight that you can't 
carry. talk your shit about us. we don't give a fuck anyway. you'll be the one 
to cry. you'll be the one to fade. i'll knock you off your high horse. tonight 
we fucking burn your dream. like glass your heart will break. now who's left 
to pick up the pieces of your new shattered existence? i've heard this shit 
before. i'll await the day to see you fade. so what more do you want from me? we 
will take on the weight you can't carry. talk your shit about us. we don't 
give a fuck anyway. you'll be the one to cry. you'll be the one to fade. i'll 
knock you off your high horse. tonight we fucking burn your dream. talk your shit 
about us. you're the true motherfucking fakes. you are the true fucking 
fakes. you are the true fucking fakes. i'll burn your dream. no apologies. i'll 
burn your dream. no apologies. we'll burn your dream. no apologies. we'll burn 
your dream. no regrets.
