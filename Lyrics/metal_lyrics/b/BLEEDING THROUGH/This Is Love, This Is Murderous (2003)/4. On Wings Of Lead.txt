Nothing was supposed to hurt like this. missing you was always one more kiss. 
now there's nothing that i can do. one more nail in the coffin, and it's all 
for you. always were and always were a simple love story. you were everything 
i ever hoped and dreamed. drown me in a pool of my blood. it's getting harder 
just to breathe. i'll suffocate you faster just so you can't see, so you can't 
see me sleep. it's getting harder just to say the right things. i've seen the 
angel's face, and i've heard her sing to me. from my reflection on this razor 
blade, i've heard ten thousand dying screams, and they're calling me. the day 
will break on this saddest day, so don't let me wake. i've heard this all 
before, and i've seen this over and over again. don't let me wake. drown me in a 
pool of my blood. it's getting harder just to breathe. i'll suffocate you 
faster just so you can't see, so you can't see me sleep. so you can't see me 
sleep. the day will break on this saddest day, so don't let me wake. i've heard 
this all before, and i've seen this over and over again. don't let me wake. 
nothing was supposed to hurt like this. and missing you, was always one more kiss. 
and now there's nothing that i can do. there's just one more nail in the 
coffin. there's just one more nail, and it's all for you. i've seen the angel's
