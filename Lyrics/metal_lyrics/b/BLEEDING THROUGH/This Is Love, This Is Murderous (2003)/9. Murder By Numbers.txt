murder ascends it's beautiful face and sides with me. everlasting sound is 
sweet. all i wanted, to not be alone, but still you always leave me. i want your 
eyes fixed on me, so i can watch them as you scream. and you were so 
beautiful. but now you'll rot. and no one will see your face. and no one will dare 
speak your name. i won't remember your eyes. i won't remember the jealousy. what 
choice is left for me? what choice is left for me? this is a war i must take, 
to wash these hands clear from choices that i've made. i'm not impressed. 
still not impressed. i'm not impressed. still not impressed. now you'll rot. now 
you'll rot. i won't remember your eyes. i won't remember the jealousy. i won't 
remember your face. and i'll forever curse your name. curse your name. i want 
your eyes fixed on me, so i can watch them as you scream. i want your eyes 
fixed on me.
