fucking hate you for the rest of my life Why the fuck did i let you into my 
heart Now where do i begin Today is my last fucking chance Erase it all and kill 
my past Fuck what we fucking said The memories dont mean shit Dont give a 
fuck about what youll say The memories dont mean shit, anymore Youre societys
