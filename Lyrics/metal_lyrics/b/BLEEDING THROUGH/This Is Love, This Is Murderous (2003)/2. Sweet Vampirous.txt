i've cursed this day with no regrets, with no compromise. curse your grace. 
shallow, this hatred that presses its finger to my lips. simple love is to 
blame. i won't lay my head down with this shame. kiss the sky. i'm always waiting 
here on the ground, on the ground. be warned. shallow, this hatred that 
presses its finger to my lips. be warned, she'll kill you. be warned, she'll kill us 
all. be warned, she'll kill you. be warned, she'll kill us all. be warned. be 
warned, she'll kill you. be warned she'll kill me.
