See I donât want you here
Took everything inside to never care
Yeah, I'd rather walk alone
Let this be the end of us all

This is your fear staring back at you as a reminder
No one cares how many lives that you infect
Hang your crosses, wrapped around your necks
Pull you to the ground and drag you to your death

Go break the ground, I'll dig your grave
So numb to care
Break the bone, become enslaved
So numb to care, yeah

See I donât want you here
Took everything inside to never care
Yeah, I'd rather walk alone
Let this be the end of us all

You are always welcome to the house of fools
Courtesy of the lives youâve ruined with nothing left to lose
Let your reflection leave a scar on the past
Lies go up in flames
Every breath becomes your last

Go break the ground, I'll dig your grave
So numb to care
Break the bone, become enslaved
So numb to care, yeah

See I donât want you here
Took everything inside to never care
Yeah, I'd rather walk alone
Let this be the end of us all

Let this be the end of us
Let this be the end of us all
