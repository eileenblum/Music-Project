Now what a disgrace
The world was in your grasp
Believe the words they say, you live through your past
So hear you wait for a feeling of control
Numb to the emotion
Of the heart that you once stole

Death, you'll be feeling so dark and alone
Once you burn with the sun you won't shine so bright
As you fade into the ash
As you fade into the ash

Slip into disappointment
Never be enough
Search for perfection
You will find disgust
All those who love you liars, fakes and thieves
Want what you can give and fall to your knees

Death, you'll be feeling so dark and alone
Once you burn with the sun you won't shine so bright
As you fade into the ash
As you fade into the ash

Fade into the ash
Fade into the ash

Oh, what a disgrace
The world was in your grasp
Believe the words they say, you live through your past
So hear you wait for a feeling of control
Numb to the emotion
Of the heart that you once stole

Death, you'll be feeling so dark and alone
Once you burn with the sun you won't shine so bright
As you fade into the ash
As you fade into the ash

Death, you'll be feeling so dark and alone
Once you burn with the sun you won't shine so bright
As you fade into the ash
