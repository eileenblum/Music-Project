I am the liar, will you listen to me?
I am the addict, will you fill my need?
I am Oblivion now follow me
Follow me

My mind is destruction
Leaving me no chance to ever be free
Excuse for depression
A death grip on my reality

I am love, I am hate, I am the end of my life
I degrade, destroy, I am what I despise

No one from nowhere
No one ever gave a shit
My mind the only true enemy
No one from nothing
These moments only contradict
Now time to revenge that I seek

My soul is degraded
I want to feel but my thoughts won't let me believe
Face down in the pavement
I am the house of stone, I am ready to bleed

No one from nowhere
No one ever gave a shit
My mind the only true enemy
No one from nothing
These moments only contradict
Now time to revenge that I seek

I am the liar, will you listen to me?
I am the addict, will you fill my need?
I am Oblivion now follow me
Follow me
