Nothing will ever be the same
Laid to waste all emotion
Forget my name
Empty words thatâs all you fucking meant
A million miles of separation
Set me free
Set me free

Embrace the flames of this sacrifice
Set me free
Out of the darkness to seek the light
Set me free
Set me free

Set me free

Now broken hope and warning signs
Searching just to be abused
Die among who fucking hide
Liars words
All you fucking meant
A million miles of separation
Set me free
Set me free

Embrace the flames of this sacrifice
Set me free
Out of the darkness to seek the light
Set me free
Set me free

Set me free

Nothing will ever be the same
Laid to waste all emotion
Forget my name
Empty words thatâs all you fucking meant
A million miles of separation. Set me free
Set me free

Embrace the flames of this sacrifice
Set me free
Out of the darkness to seek the light
Set me free
Set me free

Set me free
