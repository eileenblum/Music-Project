Go ahead and talk your shit
Watch where you stand or you will step in it
Donât make me laugh when you talk about friends
I hit the bottom, close to the bitter end

So what now? Pretend I donât exist?
I'll hunt you all, you'll never get ride of this
I'll be the villain, the one you cast aside
You'll be the coward, the one who runs and hides

Nowhere to go, nowhere to fucking hide
Nowhere to go, nowhere to fucking hide

No regrets for my time in the world
And for the people I despise
So filled with hatred, so filled with lies
Did me a favor when you pushed me aside

Keep pretending, wait for me to bleed
I'll be the ghost, you'll never fucking kill me
I'll be the villain, the one you cast aside
You'll be the coward
The one who runs and hides

Nowhere to go, nowhere to fucking hide
Nowhere to go, nowhere to fucking hide

I'm not afraid of death, tear me down
Embrace the flames of hell, burn me down
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Burn me down
Go

Go ahead and talk your shit
Watch where you stand or you will step in it
Donât make me laugh when you talk about friends
I hit the bottom, close to the bitter end

So what now? Pretend I donât exist?
I'll hunt you all, you'll never get ride of this
I'll be the villain, the one you cast aside
You'll be the coward, the one who runs and hides

Nowhere to go, nowhere to fucking hide
Nowhere to go, nowhere to fucking hide

I'm not afraid of death, tear me down
Embrace the flames of hell, burn me down
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Burn me down
Tear me down
