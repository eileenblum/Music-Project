This life, it will destroy your heart
Life will only rip us apart
Let me reach inside my flesh to show you my pain
The hurt and the ugliness remains the same
Life can you make you meaningless and cold
Life, darkness a feeling I know
I tried to be perfect the outcome is death
The love and the beauty take my last breath
I killed myself one thousand times seeking light
Just to remember your face when I die
