I was nothing
Part of the scum of the earth
Alone so many times, no sense of worth
I'm still fighting to prove myself
Running from opinion
Insecurities unearthed

Help me now, I won't take another step
Who saves me now? Exhale my final breath
Exhale my final breath

I was worthless
Someone who lies to himself
Staring at suicide, praying for help
Who really cares?
I've gone as far as I can go
This world has bled me dry
My bodies turning cold

Help me now, I won't take another step
Who saves me now? Exhale my final breath
Exhale my final breath

I live to see another day
The look upon your face
To see you walk away
I give the darkest side of me
The scared side of me to live another day

(I live to see another day
The look upon your face
To see you walk away
I give the darkest side of me
The scared side of me to live another day)

Go, I was nothing
Part of the scum of the earth
Alone so many times
No sense of worth
I'm still fighting to prove you wrong
Running from opinion
Every single thing that hurts

Help me now, I won't take another step
Who saves me now? Exhale my final breath
Exhale my final breath

I live to see another day
The look upon your face
To see you walk away
And I give the darkest side of me
The scared side of me to live another day

(I live to see another day
The look upon your face
To see you walk away
And I give the darkest side of me
The scared side of me to live another day)
