Indeed, I still believe
This world will never defeat me
Through hell and fire
And you still can't burn me

I won't let you
Into this heart again
I swear this oath to bury you
That life is finally erased
Dead and gone, permanent replaced

This is the last I'll say to you
It's time to see life through my eyes
No longer giving in while you pull me under
Nothing more for me and you
Stay dead to my life
And choke on my remains

I hope this feeling make you sick of yourself
So many times youâve played the victim
I'll meet you in hell

You won't stop me
Stomp out your ashes
I'll spit on your grave

That life is finally erased
Dead and gone, permanent replaced
This is the last I'll say to you
It's time to see life through my eyes
No longer giving in while you pull me under
Nothing more for me and you
Stay dead to my life
And choke on my remains
I gave you too much
My heart, my soul, my mind and all of my blood
I gave you too much
My heart, my soul, my mind and all of my blood

This is the last I'll say to you
It's time to see life through my eyes
No longer giving in while you pull me under
Nothing more for me and you
Stay dead to my life
And choke on my remains

This is the last I'll say to you
(This is the last I'll say to you)
This is the last I'll say to you

This is the last I'll say to you
(This is the last I'll say to you)
This is the last I'll say and choke on my remains
