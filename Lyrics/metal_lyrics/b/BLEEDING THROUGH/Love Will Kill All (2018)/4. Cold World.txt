Now, do you really think this path will define your bleak existence? Tooth and nail, hammer and fist
You'll never win

Here's your life, now piss it away
Over and over again you will see you'll end up just like them

This cold world, this cold world
This cold world, this cold world

Now you will never see reality is persistence
Tooth and nail, hammer and fist
You can't win

Here's your life, now piss it away
Over and over again you will see you'll end just like them

This cold world, this cold world
This cold world, this cold world

Listen here son, this world fucking owes you nothing
You spend it chasing death and you will die with nothing
Listen here son
You will die with fucking nothing

Take back my life, look after my soul
Try to save a life, try and save a life
Woah, woah

You'll never win
Here's your life, now piss it away
Over and over again you will see you'll end up just like them

This cold world, this cold world
This cold world, this cold world
