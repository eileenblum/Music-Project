I am not your slave
Don't breed me your guilt and insecurities
No longer bounded by blood
And you'll never stop me
Your arrogance, despicable to me

I still owe you nothing
Despite what you fixed inside me
You still think you control me
But now your heart will turn black as you

Hang your head low
Hang your head low

I am not your slave
I am not your slave
You look and the share the same ride
Don't you try and stop me
Now your existence, despicable to me

I still owe you nothing
Despite what you fixed inside me
You still think you control me
But now your heart will turn black as you

Hang your head low
Hang your head low
