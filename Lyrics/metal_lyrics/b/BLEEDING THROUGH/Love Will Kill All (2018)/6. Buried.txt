I am your darkness
Light me inside so no one can see
Donât you betray me again
Despite everything that you believe

Embrace the loneliness
Now inhale this feeling coursing through you
Coursing through you, coursing through you

Close your eyes
Now catch the sight of the enemy
Rushing hate your veins
Infected blood, torture and pain

Embrace the loneliness
Now exhale this feeling ripping through me

I am here to destroy you, I stand to embrace
I am here to bury you, what a fucking disgrace
What a fucking disgrace
Bury you, bury you

Close your eyes
Now catch the sight of the enemy
Rushing hate your veins
Infected blood, torture and pain

Embrace the loneliness
Now exhale this feeling ripping through me

I am here to destroy you, I stand to embrace
I am here to bury you, what a fucking disgrace
What a fucking disgrace
Bury you, bury you
Bury you, fucking bury you
