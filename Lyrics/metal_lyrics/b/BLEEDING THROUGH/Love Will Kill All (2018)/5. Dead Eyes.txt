Decide what you fucking stand for
Broke your faith, remain a coward inside
You have no allegiance
Nowhere to hide, blind in our sights

It's so disgusting, the arrogance that you portray
Now I'm standing right here
Welcome to your end of days
Welcome to your end of days

Dead eyes brought you here
Now you pretend it's over
Use me for your despair
This will end never

All of your regrets
Will be with you tomorrow
Use me for your despair
Bring me, bring me sorrow

Hate me, feed off insecurities
You'll never be enough to fight me away
How do you close your eyes at night?
So afraid, scared your words will die

You're so disgusting, the arrogance that you portray
Now I'm standing right here
Welcome to your end of days
Welcome to your end of days

Dead eyes brought you here
Now you pretend it's over
Use me for your despair
This will end never

All of your regrets
Will be with you tomorrow
Use me for your despair
Bring me, bring me sorrow

Dead eyes brought you here
(Welcome to your end of days)
Use me for your despair
(Welcome to your end of days)
All of your regrets
(Welcome to your end of days)
Use me for your despair
