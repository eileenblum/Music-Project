The damned ascend upon impurities of heart
We waste no time to start this war

A declaration
Cut you down at the knees
These false ideals we'll never be a part of
A declaration
For what you could never swear to me

[Chorus:]
You're just a trend, a lamb in sheep's clothing
Time to strike the nerve and erase
We are standing right here and we'll stand here forever
You can't destroy what you can not replace

This is our time for redemption

And I see it in your eyes
A soldier of fortune in clones
This day I'll hide from your reflection in the mirror
No sanctuary, no fucking hope

Now stand to your feet
Out of your shadows a plague to me
We are the prodigal sons and daughters
No fear of death and sorrow or failure

[Chorus]

And I see it in your eyes
A soldier of disgusting clones
You always hide your reflection in the mirror
No sanctuaryj, no fucking hope

Let me explain so you can understand me
You're all fake to me
Let me scream so you can fucking hear me
You're all a plague
Another sickness to me
