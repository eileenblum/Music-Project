Never before have I felt so alone so insignificant
So out of place so out of mind
All accomplishments are barren
One thousand eyes are staring at me now
With pure hate and disregard
Cold voices a realization of something they don't want to hear
All I want is to make you believe but I can't see your face
as the smoke fills the air

All I want is to make you believe
Just to make you believe

I won't let you see me hurt
I've never let you feel my pain
'Cause I know there's another reason
All your opinions can't stop what's coming
My skin has grown thick for your sharpest blade

Cold voices a realization of something they don't want to hear
All I want is to make you believe but I can't see your face as the smoke fills the air

I can't breathe as the smoke fills the air
As the smoke fills the air
Is this a fucking nightmare?
This is a nightmare
Or just the worst night of my life?

I'm standing right here
I need to believe
My heart is surrounded by glass
So cast your stones at will
Cause I need to believe
Your words won't make me question why I'm here
'Cause I need to believe
