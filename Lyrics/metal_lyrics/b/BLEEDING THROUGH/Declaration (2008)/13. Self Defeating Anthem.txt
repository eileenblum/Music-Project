[Vinyl Bonus Track]Oh!

There is nothing left to say
It's just the same people and same places
Judging every move I make

And I've spent those days
Bleeding my heart dry for everyone
Welcoming those who only destroy me

How is any of this worth it now?
I've just worried myself sick with self doubt
Losing precious hours of sleep

There is nothing left to prove
People come and go
Turn their backs
Follow trends
And run their faces

And I gave it all to the road
Sold my innocence and securities
Hoping my broken heart will be set free

How is any of this worth it now?
I've just worried myself sick with self doubt
Losing precious hours of sleep

So long
To this misery
So long
So long

There is nothing left to say
It's just the same people and same places
Judging every move I make

Move I make
You're judging every move I make
And I would do this all again
