Worthless I'm dying before you
Courtesy of misled expectations
Disdain because I've swallowed your venom
You built this up so you could piss this away

I'll write this off all of you
This conversation's heading south
To your jaded cliffs headfirst
And all you empty praises
Second coming of a nameless Christ
Hide behind your royal curtain
Beneath the grey it's black and white

Beyond your elitist tongues over saturated graves
What was the price for perfection? Now bound to the sea
Oh yeah you're bound to the fucking sea again

I know I'm hear
And it's not another puppet in your show
And you expect me to smile and take it?

Worthless worthless
Now the bitter taste you're debt to be paid
Worthless fucking worthless
Seven years of being stabbed in the back
