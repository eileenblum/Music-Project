Name one thing you've ever fucking had to give your goddamn life for
I've endured enough bitterness deflating hearts complete disgust
But you're fucking perfect your life's so perfect
Until you follow my footsteps through shallow waters I've overcome

What do you know about sacrifice?
You're just an afterthought
Flesh without bone
So here you sleep in your kingdom
You walk through shit to rest on your throne

I gave my life to this and I've watched my distance grow
I've paid enough disconnect from the people I've grown to love
So who the fuck are you? You bare the curse of the snake
I've heard every insult I won't suffer you emptiness

I've sacrificed enough for this life so get the fuck out of my way
