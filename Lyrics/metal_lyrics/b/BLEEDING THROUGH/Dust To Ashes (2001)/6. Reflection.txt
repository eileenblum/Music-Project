Blindfolded only to hear blank words of crooked smiles.
Crawling out of my skin to see a broken reflection of myself.
Sacrifices at the altar.
Pull the trigger, end this illusion.
A black candle burns for your cold heart.
A single choir sings for your every sin.
So banish me, erase the demons.
I see you gray eyes wink at the blade.
This breath of life and I'll watch you burn.
Thirteen locks the door, thirteen steps to break your smile.
Blindfolded only to hear blank words of crooked smiles.
Crawling out of my skin to see a broken reflection of myself.
Sacrificed at the altar.
Pull the trigger.
