Here comes another, deception for each other.
Needles for your will, soaked up by egos.
You, dry up my, you raped away my foundation.
Tell me lies that never miss.
Why? The blood that spilled every time we kissed.
I am just your target, so start killing me.
Your lies won't be forgiven this time.
Your strong judgments leave me nothing but this,
placed a burden on my life.
Your lies won't be forgiven this (time).
Your lies won't be forgiven.
And now it all comes down to this.
Here comes another, deception for each other.
Needles for your will, soaked up by egos.
You kill, fucking bleed my dry.
Kill, fucking bleed me.
Bleed my heart.
