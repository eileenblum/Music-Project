Broken my promise of righteousness.
Condemned for your beauty of silence.
Torn angel wings, shown her soul.
A solid stare beneath the wall of your heart.
I ask for no forgiveness.
Consumed, diseased, abused, embodied.
Forsaken, I control my life.
Lies crushed by your standards.
Suffers. This blackest light burns brightest now.
Lust for your demise.
Oppressor, death claims you.
For every hour, death makes you weak.
Into the thrones of agony.
The hourglass too strong to erase me.
You will not sell me.
She cries aloud with this imbalancy.
I must break away from your skin.
I ask for no forgiveness.
Consumed, diseased, abused, embodied.
Forsaken, I control my life.
Lies crushed by your standards......
Fuck you.
