Curse myself down, decree of perfection.
A slave to mirror ugly stares.
Awaste of scars rather to torment.
Evil equals needle, so I shut my eyes again.
So confined, scratch at my eyes.
Bleed through my hands.
Yesterday was everyday, so I swallow this hell again.
Stare blindly. Mock me.
Cast this shadow down and I'll keep running.
I'll keep running away from you.
Inside black painted walls.
Leaves a stain of your sickness.
Never the knowledge of a vagrant.
You fucking leech crawl out of my skin.
I can't feel again.
Curse myself down, decree of perfection now.
A slave to ugly stares.
A waste of scars to torment.
Every moment, trapped inside, lost inside.
