Rain falls for delusions of loneliness.
Alone in the rain,quietly dying.
What's left to build that still remains,
when my eyes are covered in black torment.
Two years of fucking torture,
I questioned my importance.
Never forget.
Never agin, never forget.
Forget this, forget my face.
Never forget, never again.
Forget this.
Forget my face.
Take the two seconds to immortality.
I'll never forget this cold stare.
I hope you're fucking choking.
Now I'll bring you back to my world.
Scratch and cry out for suffering.
Wither deep inside of me now.
Never again, forget my face, forget my face.
Wither deep inside of me now.
Never again, never forget.
Forget this, forget my face.
