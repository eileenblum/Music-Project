Delusion.
Lost astray, alone in darkness.
This loveless game of depression.
I still hear voices of you, so bury me alive in this hole that you left for me.
Deny everything, everything.
Shallow reaching out for your forgiveness.
Hopelessly, I cannot see anything.
Now I must take myself.
Now I must take my life.
Now I must rip it back from you.
Now I must take my life.
Now I must take myself.
Now I must rip it back from you.
I've reached the final judgement.
Every thought and every second that you smile,
it makes me choke, it makes me bleed, it was all lies.
Your smile makes me sick
