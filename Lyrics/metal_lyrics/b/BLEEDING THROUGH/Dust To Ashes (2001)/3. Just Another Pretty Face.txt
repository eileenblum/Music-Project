Infect with all dissolved memories of one.
Why did you care, when you never cared before?
Why'd you care, you never cared.
Why'd you care, you never cared before.
I've become an instrument of your twisted flashbacks.
Still you condemn me for my mistakes.
A curse to your saviors will.
You stare so emotionless, but still I face down.
Your heart dies with every breath of this poison.
Annihilation.
I cannot, I will not, I won't forget.
Now I must stand dor who I am.
And every picture that I see is of you and every time you cry.
Because your past can't run away,
you can't run away from this,
you cannot hide.
You can't hide from this, it won't begin.
