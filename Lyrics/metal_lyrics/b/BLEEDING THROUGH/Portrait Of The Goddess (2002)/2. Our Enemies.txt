now demons running, racing through my dreams.
taking shape, destroy my life forever,
poisoned memories to fuel this fire,
I'll burn you alive, you,
too fragile frail to leave a mark for this lifetime.
legions of storms to prey this war on you.
designed with false emotion.
I'll cross the line to take the fall.
demons running,
racing through my dreams taking shape destroy my life forever.
awaken my love and inhale this beautiful silence,
but for now and this thread I hold will be gone forever. no more.
this choce that makes me choose and it burns inside me,
and I lie awake, forever. forever.
