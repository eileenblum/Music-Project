this day on never will I look back on you,
those memories are dormant
and every thought of you I'll see you in dreams,
please don't let me sleep again,
drop your eyes to the ground,
stay the fuck away from me.
those three words none existent forever you condemned,
in my perfect world your pain to me,
your pain as great as gold.
in my perfect, you were never there,
but your words ran stale and you were never there.
this time I swear.
there's hope for tomorrow,
you turned your eyes from me.
and now I'm stronger without you.
