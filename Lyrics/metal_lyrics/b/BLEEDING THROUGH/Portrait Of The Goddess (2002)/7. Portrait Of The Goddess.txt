goddess, goddess of hate I've seen this face before,
I do believe I've heard this voice before,
so many lines so many words,
I don't regret a single one.
do you despise the reflection when you look at yourself.
remove. remove the blindfold.
one single thought, one single breath,
one smoking gun and no regrets.
what happened to the girl I used to hold.
I'm the demon in your eyes but you're the goddess of my heart.
now I need you to feel me and kiss my lips one more time.
one more time, and no regrets one more time that's all you'll fucking get.
what do I have to gain, your faec in front of me,
what do I have to lose, yourself in front of me. a single one.
