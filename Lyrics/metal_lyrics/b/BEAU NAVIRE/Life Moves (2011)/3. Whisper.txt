I spit in the face of everyone who has and ever will be ignorant, when it is all so clear. Our dying world, our tainted hearts. Walking with your eyes shut can only last so long. The greatest pain is always fear. Brothers and sisters we are one united in this darkness. Lets brighten our days, starting now.
