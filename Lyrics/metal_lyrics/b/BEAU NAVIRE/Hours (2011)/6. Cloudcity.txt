And in the dark, we can see our words, waveforms of pillow talk, plumes of our personalities, figures of speech. All laid bare for us to see. As it stands, there's nothing hidden between us--something to consider. Minds made like beds the morning after, tidy decisions with loose corners. Unkempt in our attempts to put things right. If it's lost you can't have it. Now it's gone of course you want it.
