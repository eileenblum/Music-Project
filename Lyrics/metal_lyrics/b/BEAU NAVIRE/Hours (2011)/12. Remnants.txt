Imprints of your hands can still be seen on my back and my chest. As I run my fingers along them to retrace our lives entwined, I canât help but fell alive. It seems almost as if every memory I have left to hold on to is with you. You were always there to help this boy grow. Every smile and every drop of life. First one in last one out. If I could have you forever it still wouldnât be long enough.
