Blur the lines, with your lies. How do you still survive? Why do we teach such bad habits? Where do we go from here? Nothing is real anymore. It hurts to fall together, fail together. My knees are bruised. Stand and lift your arms as high as they can go. Higher and higher, bring everyone with you. Then with your eyes in the stars stay there as long as you can. Youâll never want to sleep again.
