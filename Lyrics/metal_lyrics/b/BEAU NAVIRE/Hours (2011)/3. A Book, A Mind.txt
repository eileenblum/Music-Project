The prophet speaks to an audience of the dead. âI am your Godâ, he says. The dead they laugh, the dead they cry. From fear that all along that there really was nothing for them. Seething into whatâs left in buried books and empty pages. Our hearts will find either meaning or deceit. Burn my eyes, I donât ever want to see again.
