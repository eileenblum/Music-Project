Walking down these stairwells water drips over head. Feeling the pressure......beating on.. take a deep breath for this rot gut feeling is taking over. Waking up in dead sweats as anxiety flows over. I Just want to see you fall. Gold plated spoons fill your lungs with lead. Collapse from the weight as we rise above. Always taking advantage and now I've realized things seem a little worse. I'm worn out, tired of wearing thin.
