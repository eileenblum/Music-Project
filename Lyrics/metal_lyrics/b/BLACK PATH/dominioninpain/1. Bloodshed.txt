Veins filled with hatred came by our fatherâs death
Fatal sins are caused by lust; broken teeth bring taste of blood
My revenge seeks someone to fall on
A Rampage starts as blood fills our rage

Damage is done, War has begun
Corpses now burn
Damage is done, War has begun
Flames from Hell

A pleasant murder, Ground fades away
Sins come to life, Sky killed their kids
An axe was embedded here
As you catechized some children
Slain priests, melting
Religions still bleed

Blood on the wall
Blood on a church
Blood on my hands
Blood all around

Here pain wonât forgive
Here pain will dominate
Here pain lives again
Here pain dies,
With you

Virgins explode in the night
Numb in the blood of the earth

A pleasant murder
Sin
Unholiness
Destruction
Reaperâs blade is drunk
Satanâs coat is bloodstained
Splatterdash of blood
A nightmare the painter

Blood all around
Red lights behold
Angels sacrifice
Everything brings Bloodshed

Bloodshed
Bloodshed
Everywhere, Bloodshed

Rest in Peace

Damage is done, War has begun
Dusk rise once more
Damage is done, War has begun
Dawn falls again

Cities drown in seething blood
Sinners drown in a nightmare
Ripperâs blade is drunk
Satanâs coat is bloodstained
Full moon dies again as
Night dominates
Earth bleeds to death
None will escape

Blood all around
Red lights behold
Angels sacrifice
Everything brings Bloodshed

Bloodshed
Bloodshed
Everywhere, Bloodshed

Bloodshed
