Hazard of mutant dreams
Terror and catastrophe
Hades in burning grounds
Cataclysms and firestorms, eliminate the gods
Serpent of holy death
Mother of unholiness
Caesar in the abyss
Darkness moves around, daylight dies beyond
Hazard
Terror
Hades
Chaos
Serpent
Mother
King
Doom

Dominion in pain, Stillborn in vain
Cursed to decay, Meant to obey
Nights welcome, Sun goes down
Clouds still breathe, I dominate

My life is lost into sandâs empire
Death hates me
Born Underground

Now days burn black
The age of the never-born
Still burns white
The nation of the sun
Father
Why did you leave me alone?
Buried alive
Born in a grave

Killing godâs minions
Living in earthâs dominion
Graveyardâs imprisoned souls
Told to be free, meant to believe
Churches burning down
Haters coming for
Priests who never pray
Burn them down, burn their crowd
Kill
Live
Believe
Take me away
Churches
Hatred
Pray
Burn

Dominion in pain, Stillborn in vain
Cursed to decay, Meant to obey
Nights welcome, Sun goes down
Clouds still breathe, I dominate

Silence sucking my blood
Darkness is filling my fever
Gods are holding me down
The coffin still bleeds

Gods are holding me
Silence draining me
My coffin bleeds
Darkness is filling my fever

And now minions, burn in hell cause
When sky falls down, itâs my time to rise!

God must pay

Death was awake in the burning air
Now I feel
Now stars fell down, itâs my time to rise

Your god paid!
