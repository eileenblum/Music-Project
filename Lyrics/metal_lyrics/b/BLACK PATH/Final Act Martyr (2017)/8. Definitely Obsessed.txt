Deeper down in my darkness, in my gilded cage
The place I reach for silence and peace
This time my mind is clear
The scent of blood is on my breath
A riddle I suffer, once more

Diamonds and chains, two visions engaged
The meaning of life, my rest is denied
Suspicion turns to hunger
For vengeance and affray
I crave
No doubt, Iâm definitely obsessed

Doubts arise
My deity dies
We're the slaves of this earth

A nameless dogma
We followed a ghost
Blindfolded on a tightrope to war

The wounds on your flesh
So seductively fresh

I waited all these years, between my constant fears
I 'll give my life to get you down
This is when time will bleed, psychostasis will feed
Twisted blades in feast
Î'll watch you kneel

I promise youâll be fine between those gears
Kneel
Servant of my dreams

I dream of your soul
Desecrated and cold
This is when time will bleed, psychostasis will feed
Twisted blades in feast

Please stop

The smell of your flesh
The temptation to kill, once more

Can't you see? Iâm definitely obsessed
