Who am I to shake these grounds
Who am I to bear the instruments of war
âYou promised to fear none but yourself
You chose to change the worldâ

This fight is not mine
Such delirium must stop

Hideous and vile
The echoes of his mad laughter

First light
This dawn will be our last to see
Front line
Dusk fall upon us and clear our lives away

No prosperity resides where vagrancy reigns
Lavished by our fears into a fiend
Still hungry for our ambitions

Who am I to witness such madness
âYou're fresh meat on this feastâ

âIf God exists he will have to beg for my forgivenessâ

Charge!

Shivers go down my spine
Ready to assault the eye that never shuts
Ready to kill the god that blocks the way to heaven

What have I done?
