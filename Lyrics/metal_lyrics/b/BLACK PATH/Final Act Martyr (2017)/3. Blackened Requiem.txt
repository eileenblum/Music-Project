Stuck in a state of mind
Where beauty dies
Where eternity rules

I am the observer
The bound witness
Of my own demise

Watching my funeral
Loathing myself

Smell my fresh despair
Hear the steps of doom
Floating in void
Falling in gloom

This blackened requiem
Distorted call from Hell

The pale horse of death, taking my soul
Chains of tar and misery, luring my ordeal

Burn the wings of heaven
and forever mute
The harp of sun

These ruins I see
Dead elements were gathering here
I saw an angel
A madman, a slender god
He blighted everything
Clenched the world in his hands
Purgatory unleashed

Fire
Blessed
These
Wicked symphonies

A river of hopelessness, burning my skin
The grave as my home, death as my guide
It could all end with a light at the end of the tunnel
Warm, Aureate, dim
Or just eternal darkness
