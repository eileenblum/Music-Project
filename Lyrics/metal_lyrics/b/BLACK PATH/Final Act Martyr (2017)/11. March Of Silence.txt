Suffocating tears, the morning never came
Will I ever belong in my grave
Now who is to blame, I'm turning insane
Is there life in death or the horizon is a hollow mouth
Void seeking sacrifice

"If I am mad it's mercy! May the gods pity the man who in his callousness can remain sane to the hideous end!"
We all crawled â crept naked towards impending doom
We're born to die

"Remember that everything is forgotten"
"Never explain anything"

The march of silence
March of solitude
The silent fall

Summon the dead parade
"Either kill me or take me as I am,
because I'll be damned if I ever change."

We lost everything we left behind

God damn Abel
God damn Cain
For we will never be free

What if these monuments forever bleed
We drown in failure, forever seized

"To judge from the notions expounded by theologians, one must conclude that God created most men simply with a view to crowding hell."
