In a circle of fire
I grieve and burn
Flames, wearing the night

In a circle of funeral pyres
My world is gone

In the name of deceit
I praised the false
A colossal lie
What gods deny

In a circle of fire
Cremating bullets
Rain

In a circle of funeral pyres
A declaration of war

It has begun
A sign of prosperity and a promise of fever
The future seemed bright
Words of ease, decorating the greatest lie ever told

We've built a wall
We've built a dream

A wall of failure collapsing in front of us
We had the chance to change everything and lost it all

Because of you (I can't forget)
Because of you (I can't remember)

We could have changed it all (We failed)
We could have changed it all (We lost it all)

A wall of failure collapsing in front of us
I had the change to change everything and lost it all
