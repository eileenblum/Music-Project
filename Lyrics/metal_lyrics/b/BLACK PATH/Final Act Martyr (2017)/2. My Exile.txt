Here comes the flood
I'm sinking underneath this
Lost sea of my mind
Under empty suns
I feel desolated

And now, all gods have failed
Annihilate all, what once ever lived must die
My memories are broken
My mind is in ruins
What once I loved is dead
Like an unfulfilled prophecy, I stand
That's my final exile

I feel like I am next, the plague will die with me
Iâll suffer the pain I caused to us, to them
What I've become, what have I done
A lie, a conspiracy, the masquerade

And as I pray for a new life
The answer is no
From a voice, a whisper heard
Never before

Behold
Am I the greatest of every creation
Drifting in hallucinations
Am I the chosen one, or just a big mistake
The world we see is the world we believe

Dead, my faith and my dogma
I suffocate my last breath and visit my demise
An instinct keeps me alive
This is my punishment, what I deserve

Behold, oh, thy kingdom come

The world we see is the world we believe
Like an unfulfilled prophecy, I stand
Watching over myself

I reach for the sun
All nightmares undone
I suffered my trial
Now light dies with me
An angel dares to speak
A new apocalypse begins
I see the world crumbling
I hear the bells of the end

And now, all gods have failed
Annihilate all, what once ever lived is dead
Embrace me, forsake me
Am I the messiah?
An isolated dream
An abandoned light of hope
This world, this Hell
That's my final exile

This world, this is my exile
