"Nothing quite encourages as does one's first unpunished crime.
It is only by way of pain one arrives at pleasure."

This wretched shade I chased
Keeps calling me insane
A begging soul, a terrified child
No, I'm not insane

Sharp talons, a pair of horns
Devilish aura, a crown of thorns

What am I? What I see?
The torment must begin

In chains, suspended
I can feel nothing but madness driving my mind
The spine of our world is about to forever break

Such sound, such music
Coming out from the cracks of the earth
This spine melody, an intro, announcing the end

...of this world

I'll make an instrument out of yours and play my requiem
The blackest this world has ever heard
Until flames seize the last piece of my broken soul

"You have corrupted my imagination and inflamed my blood
You are cold, while you yourself fan flames."
