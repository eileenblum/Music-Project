[feat. BjÃ¶rn Strid]This world is heartless, but I will prevail,
Leaving you breathless, time to transcend,
My visions clear, despite this fear,
With or without heart, I'll embrace this hell,
Destiny awaits, So let's go
I wont be stopped,

Side by side we fight,
Side by side we die,
Forever together we'll fight for our lives,
Everything is falling apart,
Side by side we strive,
Side by side we rise,
So never stop dreaming or else all is lost,
Hold the lines and we will prevail,

Adversity is my new fucking passion,
I wont be denied,

No matter how hard I fall,
I'll get up with a fucking smile,
And once again,
Strive to seal my faith, over and over again,
And again #4

Side by side we fight,
Side by side we die,
Forever together we'll fight for our lives,
Everything is falling apart,
Side by side we strive,
Side by side we rise,
So never stop dreaming or else all is lost,
Hold the lines and we will prevail,

Adversity is my new fucking passion,
I wont be denied,
