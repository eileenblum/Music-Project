Bleeding fingers and broken bones
Drunk as hell, in the streets we groan,
Let me tell you about the place
Itâs a place with memories
Now listen

This is where it happens
This is where we want to be
This is where we party
This is where you stand with me

This is our place
This is our sanctum
This is our fight
This is our night

Fucked up livers but still alright
Suffocating, we puked all night
Liquors out, sadly we cry
The smokes are out
We are ready to fly

This is where it happens
This is where we want to be
This is where we party
This is where you stand with me

This is our place
This is our sanctum
This is our fight
This is our night
