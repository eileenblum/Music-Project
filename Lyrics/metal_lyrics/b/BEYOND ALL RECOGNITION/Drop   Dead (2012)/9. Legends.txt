Born with the power of the voice,
Heâs sworn to fulfill his destiny,
Let the wind carry your voice far beyond the mountains,

Shout at the skies,
Let them know of your return,
A shout in your face,
Fear the name, fear the legend,
He is back,

Make them feel your breath of fire,
Make them feel your breath of ice,
Let the world hear of your battlecryes,
Fear the name, fear the legend,
He is back,
Make them feel your breath,

Shout at the skies,the world will go down in flames,
A shout for our earth,
What will it take to bring it down from the sky?

Born with the power of the voice,
Heâs sworn to fulfill his destiny,
What will it take to bring it down from the sky?
