Den hÃ¤r lÃ¥ten Ã¤r till dig din jÃ¤vla hora
Everything was just a big mistake,
I never wanted you,
Can't you see?
I never loved you and I never will,
'Cause I played with you like a child,
I never needed you,
I used you all the time
Don't care if she's hanging,
Just cut the goddamn rope,
When addiction turns into madness,
You need to deal with the problem,
I knew how fucked up you were,
Don't care if she's hanging,
Just cut the goddamn rope,
Let her fall, Let her fall!
I can't believe I fell for your lies,
Deep inside I knew all along,
Cause I played with you like a child,
I don't care if you cry,
I don't care if you die!
