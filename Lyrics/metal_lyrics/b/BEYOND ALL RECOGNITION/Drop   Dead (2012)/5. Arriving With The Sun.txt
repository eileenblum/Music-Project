Die you fucking bitch
With a big glass of booze,
We raise our glasses in a salute,
Early PM we drink,
Late AM we sink,
Buckets of ale, a lot of smokes we inhale,
Tobacco in our lungs,
Beer on our tongues,

Live with joy and die in pain,

My love turned into shame,
My shame turned into hate,
My hate guided my way
I wish to see you dead

Run like hell, at least we fought before we fell,
Trippin all night, we see a blinking blue light,
With poison in my veins,
I wish to see you dead,
Bottoms up!

Youâre living in the fade now,
Like an abomination,
I hate everything about you,
I spit and puke on your grave,

Die with regret and die with torture,
Die you fucking bitch,
You fucking filthy whore,

My love turned into shame,
My shame turned into hate,
My hate guided my way
I wish to see you dead

The bottles are empty now
