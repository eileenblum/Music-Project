Held back by your past,
Doesn't change anything,
What you do next is what really matters,
Do not fall back,
The past is black,
Refuse to go back,
The past is black,
Life is unwritten,
Your job is to shape it,
You are the writer,
You are God for now,
Life is unwritten,
Your job is to shape it,
You are the writer,
The main character,
Bow down before me,
Cause I'll never bow down for you,
I'll fucking find you,
You stupid selfish whore,
Is there death, is there life
Is it dark or is there light?
Adventure? Tragic comedy?
Are you the hero or someone else?
Is there death or is there life?
How long is your life,
Whats your life about?
Everything is up to you,
Just make it worth living,
Life is unwritten,
Your job is to shape it,
You are the writer,
You are God for now,
Life is unwritten,
Your job is to shape it,
You are the writer,
The main character,
Feel my fucking pain,
Bow down before me
Bow down before me
