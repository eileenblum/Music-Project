If you don't stand for something,
You'll fall for everything,
What can we sacrifice, for something or someone,

Let's fight for who we are,
Let's fight for what we stand for,
Everyone has something,
Confront them, fight them,
Everyone has someone worth dying for,

Let's fight for what we stand for,
Let's fight for who we are,
Protect and save what we can,
Give your life, give your soul,

Confront them, destroy them,
Everyone has something,
Confront them, destroy them,
Everyone has someone,
Give your life, give your soul,
Just make sure it's worth it,

Let's fight for who we are,
Let's fight for what we stand for,
Everyone has something,
Confront them, fight them,
Everyone has someone worth dying for,

Who honors those we love,
Who, with the very lives we live?
You can not wish evil away,
You can only destroy it
