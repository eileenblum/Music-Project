Give me a sign,
Give me a call,
Who will die, who will survive?
Call upon us from the graves of the dead,
We will answer, we will rise,
We will carry your burdens and end your demise,

Behind a mask, hidden in the dark,
We will bring you to the shithole you belong,
Youâll never know, Youâll never see,
Safe youâll never be,

You will pay for your crimes in pain,
Your life was all in vain,

Feel my dagger pierce your pathetic spine,
Hear my whisper, this is the end,
Now it's time to fly away, youâll pay with death,
This is my life, my mission,
This is my path, my ambition,
To drop you dead,

Feel your failure carve deep inside of you,
Feel your shame and just cry forever,
Feel your shame and just cry forever,

Feel your shame and cry,
DROP YOU DEAD
