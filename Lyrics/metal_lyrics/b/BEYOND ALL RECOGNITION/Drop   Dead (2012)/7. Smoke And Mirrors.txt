They are waiting for salvation,
From me they'll get nothing at all,
With some words on a paper,
They are easy to fool,

They always take up arms to fight,
Fight and die for nothing,
The end began with the first word written,
They don't know better, fed by the lies all there life,

Blinded by fear, blinded by the light,
With a past carved in stone,
The peace will never be restored,

They are waiting for salvation,
From me they'll get nothing at all,
With some words on a paper,
They are easy to fool,

At least they'll die with a smile on there lips,
They are hoping for a paradise,
I will fight for freedom; I will fight for truth,
My life is my own, I've got nothing to lose,
Until it's time to close our eyes one last time,

It's a shame we don't know the truth,
Until it's time to close our eyes one last time,
It's an evil circle,

Guided through life by an illusion,
They don't know, they will never know,
