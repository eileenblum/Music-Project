"But let me tell you something. When 150 of the most powerful men and women in the world, can meet in secret in Baden Baden Germany, and plot the faith of billions. And nobody even cares about it. But six football players go to lunch together, and it's in the headlines across the country"

How can we stay so fucking blind?
We're being controlled by a box in the corner of the room
How can we stay so fucking proud?
How can we just live and be proud of being slaves?
Newsreaders, telling us lies every hour of the day

How can we live
And be proud of being slaves
We think that we're free

I'll rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
I rather choose to believe, that my life is not made for me

Everywhere I go and all the things I've seen
Behind this bars, we can't see, we can't feel
Everywhere I've gone and all the things I've seen
Now as I know, I can't let it go

I'll rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
I rather choose to believe, that my life is not made for me

"We got a reflection of the society which that exist. And it's a sick sick society, which is doomed to self destruction."

Explain the pyramids, explain the death of JFK
Explain 9/11 and how the towers fell to the ground
How can you be sure of something you'll never know?
I rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
I rather choose to believe, that my life is not made for me
