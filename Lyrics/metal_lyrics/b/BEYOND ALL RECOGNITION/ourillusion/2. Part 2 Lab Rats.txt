Everythings a game, a game we don't know we're in
Controlled without knowing who runs it
Fed by lies by those who stand above us
We'll take the punches, we are the targets

We are the ones who bleed
It's all about the the power, it's all about control
We are just a bunch of lab rats
Born to serve, born with no purpose

With the fear of us asking why
They use the media to feed us with lies
We are the lab rats, raised to not know
Raised in a cage with no choice of our own
We are the lab rats, raised to not know

They will spread fear across the ocean
To every corner of the earth
Come to close and see yourself dead
They will kill your dreams and leave no light ahead

We are the ones who bleed
It's all about the the power, it's all about control
We are just a bunch of lab rats
Born to serve, born with no purpose

With the fear of us asking why
They use the media to feed us with lies
We are the lab rats, raised to not know
Raised in a cage with no choice of our own
We are the lab rats, raised to not know
