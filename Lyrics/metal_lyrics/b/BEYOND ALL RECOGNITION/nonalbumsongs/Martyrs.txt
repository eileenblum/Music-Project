COME ON AND STAND UP AND JUMP!

I will always dream of a place far away from where I stand
We're going under, we're falling deeper down below
Try, try, try to drag me back
Try, try, try but I will never let this go
Fuck this
Die with a smile and just live fucking life

We know what to do, we know what we want
Still we're leaving hope for safety
We're all afraid of failure

Why dream when there is a thing called experience
Why think of tomorrow?
With a will stronger than fear we can break shackles
Why think of tomorrow when there is a present
Why are we letting go?
We know what we want and we know what to do
Still are we leaving our hope for insanity

We're all afraid of failure
We're all afraid of losing control of ourselves
F**k this sh*t and live a life
Try, try, try to drag me back
Try, try, try, but I will never lose control of myself

I will never let go of myself til I die
One life, One Youth, One chance
I will never surrender til I'm fucking dead
One life, One Youth, One chance

Why dream when there is a thing called experience
With a will stronger than fear we can break shackles
Why think of tomorrow when there is a present?
Why are we letting go?
We know what we want and we know what to do
But still we're leaving hope for insanity
We're all afraid of failure
We're all afraid of losing control of ourselves
We're all afraid

Why dream when there is a thing called experience?
Why think of tomorrow?
With a will stronger than fear we can break shackles
Why think of tomorrow when there is a present?
Why are we letting go?
We know what we want and we know what to do
Still are we leaving our hope for insanity
