[Lyrics: Austi in summer 2006]

a radical beginning
fulfilled by all disgust
demasked putrid theorems
clotted blood under porous skin
decline seems to be
just a question of time

rise of the synthesis
ascent towards undefined twilight
spreaded depression
at the path's peak
a refusual campaign
war of regress
the slime to overcome

â¦and did you fuckers think you were worth the pain?

never resting
the wanderer is taking over
the darkest valley
the lightest height
senseless passion in time
a blossom that's never gonna open

â¦and the world is still the cause for all that pain
