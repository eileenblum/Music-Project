[Lyrics: Hacky in January 2006]

Possessed by the ecstasy of the extreme
Destroying chapels of devotion
Overwhelming addiction to dormancy
The essential confusion of senses

The endless hope of breakthrough
Only hate and grim, for sober reality
Impalpable in the glare of lunar
Behind the times

Mesmerized of ambient aeons
Clandestine cognition
Inspected through these empty eyesâ¦
â¦the inside of longing death.

Limbonic lifetime
Gathering aimless souls
Raping their etherial illusions
And releasing their imprisoned minds

An apocalyptic moment wafts with a wet fear
â¦ through our rotten hands.
A new aeon, a new blazeâ¦
We climb with an erection, to usurp your place
...on the throne by the hillsâ¦
