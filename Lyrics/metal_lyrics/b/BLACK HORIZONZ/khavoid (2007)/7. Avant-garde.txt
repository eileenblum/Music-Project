[Lyrics: Reiner in May 2005]

Sophisticated enchantments
Of impressive abhorrence
Created not for human ears
Joyful eulogize annihilation
And continuous ordeal

Verbalized in deepest odium
By a psyche beyond any idol
From the end of the vortex
A place devoid of concern
The absurdist's elation

Creeping keen on your deliberation
Skulking in circles for the impiousness
Assassinating all divine virtues
With alluring somber momentum
To relieve its voracious hunger for sin

But though it feeds on beautiful souls
The fatalities become enriched
By sipping the potion of clarity
From the unambiguous chalice of scorn
Whenever their spirits get spoiled

And as now the grave canopy unfolds
Over your mental magnificence
Imbibe the fiery draft from this goblet
To amalgamate with the avant-garde
The perverted cult of transgression
