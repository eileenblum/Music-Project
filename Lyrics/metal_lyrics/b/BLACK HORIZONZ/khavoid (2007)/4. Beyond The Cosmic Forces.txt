[Lyrics: Hacky in summer 2005]

Pure and clear landscapes
Melancholy and wrath blaze up
Pleasure and tranquillity
Frozen hatred for men

Abreption begins
Subconscious becomes reality
Clarity,
â¦and wisdom?

Stare into this realm
Calming scenes inside your mind
No scorn any more
Desperately in need of her hand?
No longer mesmerized
Veracity reveals, no regrets
Celestial cosmic force
Pestilent old-growth forest
Smouldering nature
Toxic rain of resurfaced humans
Drowningâ¦.
The old woman lost her elegance!

Back to raw, majestic nature
Kissing her, numb with griefâ¦ futileâ¦
Vast grimâ¦ no encore!
