[Korpiklaani cover]

I was born in a deep forest,
I wish I could live here all my life.
I am made from stones and roots,
my home, these woods and roads.

All my life I loved this sound,
of the woods all around.
Eagles fly where the winds blows free,
journey is my destiny

Free, free as a journey man,
Feel, heat in the moonlight.
Free, free as a journey man,
Feel, heat in the moonlight.

Ragged trousers, rucksack in my back,
narrow road behind me,
I never look back.
Long way is in the past,
as in front of me,
hunger keeps me going,
I don't care where it leads,
fire burns under my feet,
journey men pleasure and destiny.
Sky is black, stars shows me the way,
moon whispered how to keep my faith.

Free, free as a journey man,
Feel, heat in the moonlight.
Free, free as a journey man,
Feel, heat in the moonlight.

The band changed its name to ALESTORM.
