When I come back from a mighty quest
I have no need for sleep or rest
I head to a tavern for a drink
And get so drunk I cannot think
A wench by my side and a jug of mead
These are the things that I most need
So I sit back and sing this song
And drink and party all night long

HEI! HEI!
I want more wenches
HEI! HEI!
More wenches and mead
HEI! HEI!
I want more wenches
Lots of wenches is what I need
