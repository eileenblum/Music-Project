As I explore the sewers,
I discover her taken to a chamber
where a man awaits
"bring him to me, I will decide
everyone chosen, everyone dies
he will be our perfect sacrifice
to our god who demands it"
he wears a serpent mask to cover his lies
he spews his venom unto his loyal congregation
as i prepare to die alone
i see those familiar faces
a man and boy, father and son
my head is bowed on the sacrificial stone
his blade risen to execute
as it falls it shreds flesh
a boy drenched, covered in the blood of this father
he waivers not
you deceived the few, you betrayed us all
traitor
