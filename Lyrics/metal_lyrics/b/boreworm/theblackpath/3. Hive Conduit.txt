Madness, surging through my fucking brain
Relentless, showing things I cannot change
Why do my dreams haunt me
Why cannot I not rest
No, This night seems without end
and it leaves me with the sanctity of nothing
My skin begins to crawl
as those who call out to me in my sleep
as i awake, screaming and shaking
my eyes bloodshot red from hours of crying
will this pain secede or will this be my end
I've lost my grip on reality
sanity escapes me, delusions ensue
my walls are caving in
I fall to the ground
I have become a slave to their dark will
overwhelming voices that now bring me to my knees
take these lives to feed the hive
when death rains down who can survive
I have become one with them
