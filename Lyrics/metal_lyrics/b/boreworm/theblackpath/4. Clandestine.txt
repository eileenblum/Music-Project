Hundreds of followers gather at this mount
torches in hand, to the top we ascend
where we will form a pillar of light
this night is theirs, sacrifices prepared
the time draws near, premotions are clear
"as it was said, it will be done"
now as the moon moves to cover the sun
as we bring our blades to their throats
they swallow all their fears
as the sun escapes our sight we offer you this beacon
oh great ones, make this your feeding place
open up, swallow it all
purge the earth, let us give it our eyes
open up, swallow them whole
i beckon to you from the farthest depths of space
to come and devour these fools
and here i wait
for you to call us back home
I have seen it written in the stars
Their world will pierce the sky and pour itself into ours
The darkness breaks exposing our offering
rise to your feet the ritual is complete
as we descend, our hope remains clear
we have unleashed the greatest of fears
all men will fall who ignore the signs
this selfish world, has run out of time
