This planet is cold and dead
We need a new
For years, we've fed on this decrepit land
The hive has grown weary
Erect, we look to our god to provide our next meal
We have lived for Aeons
We will never be extinguished
We will devour all worlds
And turn life into death
Mercy is shown to no one
We will ravage the weak
To replenish the colony
We are of one mind
We are of one hive
We are all of one mind
We cower in his wake as he rises
To conjure a portal
His magnitude covers our sky
As he casts his shadow
Let us flow through these gates
To a new world that's full of life
Only to destroy it
Let our compass be precise
As the swarm begins to crush
Into it!
Into it!
As we navigate through the stars
This new earth will soon be ours
