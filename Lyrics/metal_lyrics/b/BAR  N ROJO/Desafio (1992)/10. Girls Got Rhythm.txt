[AC/DC Cover]

[Young, Young, Scott]

I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What my lady she's got
She steals the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a walking down the street
Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
Enough to blow me out
No doubt about it can't live without it

[Chorus:]
The girl's got rhythm
The girl's got rhythm
She's got the backseat rhythm
The girl's got rhythm
She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She gives me first degree
She really satisfies me
Love me till I'm legless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War
You know I'm losin' sleep
I'm in too deep
And my body needs love
No doubt about it can't live without it

[Chorus]

You know she moves like sin
And when she lets me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it can't live without it

[Chorus]

You know she really got the rhythm
She's got the backseat rhythm
Rock 'n' roll rhythm
The girl's got rhythm
