[Los Canarios cover]

Here we go now baby! 
Get on your knees baby
and pray, pray, pray for your love
get on your knees baby
and pray, pray, pray for your love. 
YouÂ´ve been too long
away from home and iÂ´ve been crying
you,ve done me wrong
so hear my song if you want to save your love 
For your penance will be 
Get on your knees baby
and pray, pray, pray for your love
get on your knees baby
and pray, pray, pray for your love. 
Got to hear it one more time!
all right! 
I canÂ´t go home
my pain is too strong there since youÂ´ve been gone
so hereÂ´s a chance
for you to pray; to cry, and to feel the pain. 
Like i told you before:
Get on your knees
sing the song
get on your knees baby
and pray to the lord
the almighty god
for your love 
ItÂ´s got to be for your lover 
Get on your knees
get on your knees
get on your knees
thatÂ´s what i say!
get on your knees
get on your knees baby
and pray, pray, pray for your love
get on your knees baby
and pray, pray, pray for your love.
get on your knees baby
and pray, pray, pray for your love
get on your knees baby
and pray, pray, pray for your love.
