Eight in the morning
The noise in the street sounding like hell
They're digging the sidewalk
The forth time, the fifth time
Who could tell!
They are like termites
Looking for food without a rest
Tearing the ground up!
Tomorrow their task will be the same

A new day's beginning in my town
I'll have to get up early feeling down
The bus is late as ever I feel worse
The tube is full of people
Let us walk!

Tell me when our leaders
Will act a way that we could understand
They claim to be prepared
To know what's good or bad our lives

And when the council
Sends you a note, it's a bad sign
Citizen, dead
Here's a new tax if you don't mind

Tomorrow youÂ´ll pay more
At the parking meter
The council cares for you
Like a baby-sitter
And if you have a problem don't you worry
Here's a good idea just final

Tell me when our leaders
Will talk about good mews for a change
Tell me it will be never
Cos we are always loosing all the same

And if you stand up
They'll label you a "social disgrace"
You hairy young man
The almighty ones don't like your face
Or you'll be sent to a nasty place

Tell me when our leaders
Will talk about good mews for a change
Tell me it will be never
Cos we are always loosing all the same
