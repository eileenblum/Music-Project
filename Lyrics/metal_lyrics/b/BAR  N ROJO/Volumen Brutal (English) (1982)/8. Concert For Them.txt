"Here we are again with your favorite show
Come along with us, so the DJ goes
And the night is bringing heavy rock"

Have a coffee first, later have a smoke
Then AC/DC are gonna toll
Hell's bells forever and ever on

At every concert of rock and roll
Bells are always tolling for Bon Scott

[2x]
For Janis, Lennon, Allman, Hendrix, Bolan, Bonham, Brian and Moon

Can you hear the sound of a rumbling sea
Swelling from below the city asleep
Sirens cry, take good care of yourself
Be sure that you won't be caught!

You don't want to listen to any other songs
Whitesnake or Rainbow, always rock
Guitars gently whisper in our ear

At every concert of rock and roll
Bells are always tolling for Bon Scott

[2x]
For Janis, Lennon, Allman, Hendrix, Bolan, Bonham, Brian and Moon

At every concert of rock and roll
Bells are always tolling for Bon Scott

[2x]
For Janis, Lennon, Allman, Hendrix, Bolan, Bonham, Brian and Moon
