If you feel down at home
Waiting for a good time
If your life's so empty
So you think it's the end
If you go to the street
And you can see there
People working so hard
As you couldnÂ´t believe

[Chorus:]
Someone's loving you
It makes you feel better

Where you're sad
She comes by your side
You're a lucky man
And you don't realize it
Someone's loving you and
It makes you feel good

If you see the sun
Setting down every day
Don't you know anyway
It will be down again
And if you go back home
At the door you will find
Her awaiting for you
Think it's good to be alive

[Chorus]

If you see the sun
Setting down every day
Don't you know anyway
It will be down again
And if you go back home
At the door you will find
Her awaiting for you
Think it's good to be alive

[Chorus and fade]
