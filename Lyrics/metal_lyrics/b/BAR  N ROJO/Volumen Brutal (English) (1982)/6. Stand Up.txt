Bloody killers in disguise
Being without a will or a heart
I can't find the words to tell you
How I hate the evil you've done

You want money, so you kill
Nothing matters if you win
You aim at power through your lives
So you tell dirty lies

Though you're always watching me
And processing my belief
You will see that I won't keep quiet

[2x]
I'll stand up
I'll stand up to the end

You send orders to the prophets
So that they announce a world war
Undertaking our destruction
Is what you've been doing for so long

You proclaim that you do
Is just meant for our own good
But beneath that kind disguise
You hide a deadly gun

You say that we must submit
To your power and good will
But I'm not about to be deceived

[2x]
I'll stand up
I'll stand up to the end

I'm aware of all your enemies
And I know that you'll pay
You'll have to pay

So much pressure cannot last
It will end up in a blast
And that bloody count down
Must be stopped tight now

Though you're always watching me
And processing my belief
You will see that I won't keep quiet

[2x]
I'll stand up
I'll stand up to the end
