People are trying to ignore the existence
Of flowers or evil
But then it's true they're growing freely
In dreadful metal fields

The world is falling down through a hole
That leads right to hell
And no one seems to realize
We're closer to the end

Why do so many want to destroy
A world they play with life a toy?
Why are they growing all around
Out or control, flowers or evils

[3x]
We must destroy
The flowers or evil

No one is fighting to in the future
We just live for today
And egotism is the only banner
We're rising everywhere

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
We make this our law
So I'm afraid it's going to be
A judgement day for all

What crazy genius will do his worst
To make our own time come to a halt
Why are they growing all around
Out of control, flowers or evil?

[3x]
We must destroy
The flowers or evil

What crazy genius will do his worst
To make our own time come to a halt
Why are they growing all around
Out of control, flowers or evil?

[3x]
We must destroy
The flowers or evil
