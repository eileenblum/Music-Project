There's a rising sound
And a word about town
That we rockers aren't good men
If you don't behave yourself
In a nice and proper way
Then you won't go to heaven

Get your minds free from evil of rock
Or you're gonna be damned that is for sure
You'll never have a good name at all

And so what
My Heart is full of rock!

You go about unshaved
Says the sheriff in a rage
And you've got good looking babes
He says to have a smoke
Is a sin worst of all
And so he tells me go to hell

Do I wanna have my reputation or rock
No choice for me it's rock and roll
Cos I'm right and they are wrong
They are wrong

My heart is full of rock!

Through they make me laugh
I just say I've had enough
Of right-thinkers and their kingdom
What they won't forgive
Is to know that we believe
In another kind or freedom

Do I wanna have my reputation or rock
No choice for me it's rock and roll
Cos I'm right and they are wrong
They are wrong

My heart is full of rock!
