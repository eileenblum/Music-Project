Baby please give me the chance
I'll show you the way I am
Open up your heart to me
Cos in your heart I want to be

Trough things may not turn out the same
I am sure they can't get worse
Than the routine of your living

Baby please give me the chance
And I'll chance your way of life
Baby please give me the chance
To get to the very end

So call me if you want to find
A new and a better world
Look for me if you want to have
Somewhere just for you to go

We won't lack the power of will
To go forward both together
And to a new dimension fly

[3x and fade]
Baby please give me the chance
And I'll chance your way of life
Baby please give me the chance
To get to the very end
