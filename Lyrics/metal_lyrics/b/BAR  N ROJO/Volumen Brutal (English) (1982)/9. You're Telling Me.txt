I met you at the station
With a suitcase in the hand
You wanted to escape from here
Just to go anywhere
You felt so sad and down
Like you'd never before
You were a pretty girl
I was only a poor boy
I made you a proposal

[Chorus:]
You are telling me
I'm telling you
It'll be alright
If you want to

[Chorus]

We went to a motel
Just to have another try
I gave you all my heart
Cause you wished a frantic night
On the edge of down
I don't know why you awoke so cross
Then I understood
Why you'd always been alone
I made you a proposal

[Chorus and fade]
