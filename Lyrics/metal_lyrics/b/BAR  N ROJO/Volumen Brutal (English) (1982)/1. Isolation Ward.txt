I don't know the reason
But I seem to be alone
I can't believe It
That it is my fault

If I care for people
They don't care for me
They are always asking
But they never give

It's like living in an isolation ward
They shut me in and I can't open the door

[2x]
I'm so lonely here
Must get out of here

When I try to speak
They don't listen to me
I do my very best
And they laugh in my face

There's no understanding
We've put up a fight
And to be left alone
Is the winning prize

It's like living in an isolation ward
They shut me in and I can't open the door

[4x]
I'm so lonely here
Must get out of here

It's like living in an isolation ward
They shut me in and I can't open the door

[4x]
I'm so lonely here
Must get out of here
