[Bad Company cover]

[Mick Ralphs]

if i hear you knocking hard up on my door
ain't no way that i`m gonna answer it
'cos cheating is a one thing and lying is another
and when i say it`s over that`s it i`m gonna quit yeah

now i ain't complaining, just tryin' to understand
what makes a woman do the things she does
one day she`ll love you the next day she`ll leave you
why can`t we have it just the way it used to be

'cos i`m a man, i got my pride don't need no woman to hurt me inside
i need a love like any other
so go on and leave me, leave me for another

good lovin' gone bad, good lovin' gone bad, good lovin' gone bad and
baby i`m a bad man

good lovin' gone bad
