[Black Sabbath cover]

[R. J. Dio, T. Iommy, G. Buttler, W. Ward]

Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past
It always seems to come again
Again and again
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm
Sail across the sea of lights
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright

Neon Knights!
Neon Knights! all right!
