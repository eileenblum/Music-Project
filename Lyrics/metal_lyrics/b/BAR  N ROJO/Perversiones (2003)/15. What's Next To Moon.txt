[AC/DC cover]

[A. Young, M. Young, Bon Scott]

Well I tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Giving that woman just a one more chance
To give it to me one more time
Engineer wishing he was home in bed
Dreaming about Casey Jones
Wide-eyed woman lookin' a mile ahead
Thinking about broken bones

[Chorus:]
It's her love that I want
It's her love that I need
It's her love got to have
It's her love

Heavenly body flying across the sky
Superman was out of town
Come on honey, gotta change your tune
Cause it's a long way down
Clark Kent looking for a free ride
Thinking about Lois Lane
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's - a suicide
And that'd be a shame

[Chorus]

Long Arm looking for a fingerprint
Trying to find the mystery clue
Hitting me with the third degree
Working on a thumb screw
Alright, officer, I confess
Everything's coming back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack

[Chorus]

What's next to the moon?
