[Janis Joplin] 

You say that itas over baby, Lord,
You say that itas over now,
But still you hang around me, come on,
Wonat you move over.

You know that I need a man, honey Lord,
You know that I need a man,
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can.

Please dontcha do it to me babe, no!
Please dontcha do it to me baby,
Either take this love I offer
Or honey let me be.

I ainat quite a ready for walking, no no no no,
I ainat quite a ready for walking,
And whatcha gonna do with your life,
Life all just dangling ?

Oh yeah, make up your mind, honey,
Youare playing with me, hey hey hey,
Make up your mind, darling,
Youare playing with me, come on now!
Now either be my loving man,
I said - a let me honey, let me be, yeah!

You say that itas over, baby, no,
You say that itas over now,
But still you hang around me, come on
Wonat you move over.

You know that I need a man, honey, I told you so.
You know that I need a man,
But when I ask you to you just tell me
That maybe you can.

Hey! Please dontcha do it to me, babe, no!
Please dontcha do it to me baby,
Either take this love I offer,
Honey let me be.

I said wonat you, wonat you let me be ?
Honey, youare teasing me.
Yeah, youare playing with my heart, dear,
I believe youare toying with my affections, honey.

I canat take it no more baby,
And furthermore, I donat intend to.
Iam just tired of hanging from the end of a string, honey,
You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule.
Wah, wah, wah, wah, honey...
