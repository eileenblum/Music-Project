[MSG cover]

[M. Schenker, G. Bohnet, C. Gleen, T. Mckenna]

You put me down,That's what I said

I hit the clouds and you kicked me in the head
Ain't that a strange thing for you to do I'll never

get it now together we were new

I don't need this, you don't want that
I wonder when you're gonna get upon my back
You'd better keep me just while you may
You'd better stick around or get out the way

Why don't you want me
You cannot know
Why love me
Then go

Just straighten out your head and mind
Forget about the things that make you draw the line
Don't want to take warnings from you
Can't have much more
of this What are you tryin' to do

Why don't you want me
You cannot know
Why love me
Then go

There's got to be some other way
It's time to work it out
Turn it blue from grey
Your cutting out is cutting in
We have no time to bleed the blood is running thin
I don't need this you don't want that
I wonder where you're gonna get on the track
You'd better keep me just where you may
You'd better stick around until you're on the way

Why don't you want me
You cannot know
Why love me
Then go
