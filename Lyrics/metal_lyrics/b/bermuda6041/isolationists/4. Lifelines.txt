Leave me,
This blackness is closest to home for me,
I'd gladly breathe the depths and watch the surface fade away.
Save your lifelines for someone who's still drowning.
For a lifetime of disappointment
I can't take back,
Let the waves blanket over me and swallow me down,
The tide can only take bits and piece,
It's never enough to cease these aches.
It's never enough to cease the ache.
The waves are calling me home.
Save your lifelines for someone who...
Save your lifelines for someone who's still flailing
I'll do what it takes to keep my head above water
Save your lifelines for someone who's still flailing
I'll do whatever it takes to keep me head up
