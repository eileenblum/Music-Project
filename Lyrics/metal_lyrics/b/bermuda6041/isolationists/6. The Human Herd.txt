Wake from this dream 'cause it's turned into nightmares
Wake
When you realize the sheep you've been counting are your closest friends

Live life without a care,
Ambitions go nowhere,
Simply live out your days moving from field to field.

When will the life you lead ever mean something?
Only when you realize the shelter your holding is a killing floor

Shepherds led you astray,
They led you here to die
Shepherds led you astray,
They led you here to die

The human herd thinned to a bare minimum.
