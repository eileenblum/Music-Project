I know now that we can never see eye to eye,
You're always 5 steps ahead
And I can taste the dirt from your back step,
Grasping at straws as they're set ablaze before me,
Been looking up at your pedestal for so long
The sun has burned out my eyes,
Insult to injury,
Spit in my wounds.
But I'm not naive,
Though sight will return,
It won't be the last time
How long can your bitter reign last before it's over?

Fed on a diet of nothing worth chewing,
I've managed to stand dead center,
How long can your reign last
When will it all fall down?
This harvest bares bitter fruit
Fed on a diet of nothing worth swallowing,
Managed to stand against the wind.
How long can your reign last when will it all fall down,
The harvest bares better fruit.

I was raised to never give up,
Never fall down,
Always fly up,
Never burn down.
You can have it if you'll only step to me,
I will always stand up
'Til the last soldiers been taken out

Let these scars serve as reminders
For the lives we've lead.
When will it all fall down?
When will it all fall down?
