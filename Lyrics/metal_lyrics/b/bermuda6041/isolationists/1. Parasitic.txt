[feat. Michael Barr of Volumes]Sever, it's like severing heads.
It's your untrue words that put you in your grave,
Fade away before you're forced out,
Your true self exposed.
Bare the pain,
Of knives buried in my back
I'll slit your throat with them in time,
And carve "traitor" in your name,
And show the world your face.
This is the end of the world!
My name, like razorblades,
In your lying throat,
You'll swallow lies delivered through your yellow crooked teeth.
Parasite.

Parasite,
These razorblades,
Fit nicely in your lying throat.
Parasite
