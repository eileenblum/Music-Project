And I know,
That if this ever ends,
It can only end in tragedy
Coward, you can't see through your broken heart again,
Despite the steps I take to embrace the light
I'm lost inside this endless fucking grey.
The strain,
Of failures past weigh me down and force me to fight.
Will we hide ourselves from the world?
Can we force flight from our broken wings,
And motion from these shattered limbs.
And I know if this ever ends,
It can only end in tragedy.
Lock this dull ache in my chest and focus my sight
We are alone.
Leave us alone.
I know
That's if it ever ends
It can only end in tragedy again
God help me
I can't let this go again,
God help me
I can't let this go again
