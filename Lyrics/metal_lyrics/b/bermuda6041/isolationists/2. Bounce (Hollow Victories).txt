Enjoy this small victory now.
For it's short lived and soon enough
The shade will lift the clouds will scatter and I...
I will shake the failures away,
My heart died long ago (if it ever existed),
For what it's worth
I'll try to keep this brief.
Now.
For what it's worth
I'm still filled with the compassion you denied me for so long.
Bounce like this!
Enjoy these hollow victories while you have the time!
Enjoy these hollow victories short lived as they are.
Enjoy these hollow victories short lived as they are.
Can you hear the sound of a lifetime's betrayal.
Betrayal.
Enjoy your hollow victory.
