Oh child, take this gift
Like the day of your birth you were given a sight
I shall give you this vision of what eyes couldn't perceive

Through me you shall see what god forbids you to see
As you walk through the fire in search for final release
For I am the way through the labyrinth of lies
To discover the truth of mystery divine

Let there be Darkness! Let there be Night!

Enter the halls where Death prevails
Where the Dark is new light overwhelming your mind
Where your journey begins
For the flesh doesn't hold your soul anymore

Return like the Ancient Serpent of Emptiness
The ruler of realm of perfect silence
And ascend from primeval waters of uncreation
To devour the sun once and for all

Crush thy eyes in ultimate denial
Glorify His sacred name
Unchain thy Will, unchain thy mind
Sanctify thyself

I am the sacred path between you and our true God
Thus you can only embrace his infinite might through me and...

Through me you shall see what god forbids you to see
As you walk through the fire in search for final release
For I am the way through the labyrinth of lies
To discover the truth of mystery divine

Let there be Darkness! Let there be Night!
Let no sun ray shine from the sky!
