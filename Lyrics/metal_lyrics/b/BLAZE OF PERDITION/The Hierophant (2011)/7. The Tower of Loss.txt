Each circle must be closed, alike each world
Must fade away!

All is for nothing! ALL IS FOR NOTHING!
Thus all thy light reflects as shadow
Any way chosen is a path of defeat
To a painful monument of the genre of catastrophe

All is uncertain! All has gone mad!

Oh feeble man, oh slave of thyself!
Thou art as infants with heroin addiction
As an inverted tower fall with all humility
Unlikely to reach thine image of Eden
Oh feeble man made of juice and clay, surrender!
For thou hath failed to bear thy name with dignity!
As a worm untransformed, thou hath never seen the Light
And so thy existence itself is a blasphemy!

As a monument of pain, architecture of denial
Chaotic emanation of all that is for nothing
The punishment of life, the final judgement reversed
Enwing thyself with suffering, encrown with thorns

All is uncertain, all has gone mad,
All is inverted like the Tower from the Cards!

The Tower of loss! The oracle of failure!
As distant wars become so close
And distant fears now stand before thy home
And like serpents of incest rape they brood

Thou art witness to a construction of loss
Thus the pain of man is a pain of a GOD!
Thou wisheth to be the locust of the earth,
Only thou hath reached becoming the vermin
Thou gleameth hopefully unto the void
Tough the void returns only chosen smiles
When sails thee towards perdition, nail thy feet to the deck!

All is for nothing! ALL IS FOR NOTHING!
All that you percept is a lie so blind
All is uncertain all has gone mad
All is inverted like the tower from the Cards!
