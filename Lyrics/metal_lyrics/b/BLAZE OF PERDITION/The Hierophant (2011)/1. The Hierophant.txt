I am coming as an earthly spawn of Thoth
The master of time, numbers, signs and forbidden knowledge
I was the one teaching sages and to the kings showing the path
In new time of decadence I return
To bring back the meaning of ancient wisdom
To bring you these mysteries - knowledge of life and death

I am the Hierophant, envoy of the Brightest One
I walk the path strangled by the demiurge
I am the Hierophant, enkinder of divine flame
I bring you the keys to all arcanes

The moment has come, this is the time
To turn the Morning Star
Gnostic cult returns in unity of Darkness and Light
I give you this Black Flame
Open your souls

I am the Hierophant - I know the mystery of shadows
I crossed the path of Darkness and draw power from fears
I am the Hierophant - I know the secrets of the creator
To stand triumphantly over all dualisms

My teachings shall be the tunnel leading to the Will of Existence
But before you drink nectar from the Holy Grail
You shall embrace the mysteries you have never dreamed of

I am the one, who died and resurrected ages before Christ
Periodically - to speak through the prophets' mouth
The master of Arcanes bearing the light of Gnosis
During downfall of the spirit
Messenger of Lucifer, envoy of Prometheus, incarnation of Thoth
Worshiper of Therion and Trismegistos
