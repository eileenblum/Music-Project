Infected myself, I am a messenger of pain
I breathe to make them never breathe again
I burn to be reborn or was I just born to burn?
Behold! The true Punishment returns!
And a glorious, glorious song I carry
And a cross of red on all the doors

A guest in every home, a drop in a cup of water
A worm in every cunt, a moth in every mouth
A legion of rats, or a nation of maggots
Following my new flagellant procession

I lead them all to orgy, I lead them to unite
Let them spread their Word, and I will spread mine
For I fear even the echo of Thy whisper
Oh lord I am devoured by Thy horrible Magic!

I am Thy plague; I am Thy tool, Thy flag, Thy flail
I am Thy plague, spread by Thee to separate
The blessed from the worthless, the Perfect from the deformed
The sin from the sinner, and all never to see the dawn
I am thy plague! Thy storm spawned to flagellate!
A sharpened blade thou hath made my lips
With selfish bliss I shalt inflict Thy work!

Of Deconstruction in the trance of death
Of mutilation in the name of the Self
By orgasm through decay, I inject the faith into all wombs

Let them lick my wounds
To swarm my song of mass sacrifice
Little hands of this generation
Striking the window of the incinerator
Forced communion of infected sperm
Soaking innocent lips of daughters of man

Let them lick my wounds
To swarm my song of mass sacrifice
Let them cry "Oh God! Save me from the flies!"

And the glorious song I carry
I am thy plague! I am thy promised plague!
A sharpened blade thou hath made my lips
With selfish bliss I shalt inflict Thy Work!
Of Deconstruction in the trance of death
Of mutilation in the name of the Self
Of building thy new church out of the dead
