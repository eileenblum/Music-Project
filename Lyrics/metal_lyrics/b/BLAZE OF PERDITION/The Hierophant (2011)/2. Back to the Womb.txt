These words shall burst into heavens
As a scream of thousand throats
This is the time, when the sky shall weep
Over the most glorious failure as god

My thoughts are razors, my words are cuts
On this work of deceit I shall mark my sign
With scythe across the throat of YHVH
Tetragrammaton - I am the end of thee
Feed him not with energy, feed him with pride
So he shall choke on our vanity
For this is what we were given
For this is what we are meant to be
Tetragrammaton - thy corpse shall give birth to me

Open hearts and seeds shall be planted
As we march towards damnation - to be reborn!
Open hearts for perdition to enter
For sins to bind us all
As we march towards Death
Not without fear, yet with sardonic smile on our faces

The truth I've chosen to search for
So distant, yet getting closer and closer
With caressing touch of a cold, pale hand
Reaching from black robe
I shall transform through holy thirteen
From serpent to eagle to fly beyond
To taste the fruits from the highest branches
Of the Tree of Death

Holy Death - Sodomize this feeble image of loss
Holy Death - Plant Thy seeds in me
Holy Death - Rape this feeble image of loss
Holy Death - Impregnate it with semen of utmost perfection

Mother of night, mother of night
Be my guide, through the halls of the dead
Across the path where no Will is limited
When nothing is real - everything is permitted

Come! Reap what demiurge has sown
water the fields with blood of man
Transform us, taker of life
Lead us away from this world
Take us back to the womb
