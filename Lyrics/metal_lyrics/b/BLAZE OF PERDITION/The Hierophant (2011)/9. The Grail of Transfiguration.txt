I drink blood from the grail of initiation
I drown in nameless void
Kneeling in the circle of my kin's skulls

A blaze of back candles brightens my path
Beyond the gates of perception
I seek the mythical Hanged Man
Who shall guide me further towards Death

Before me the path covered with cards
Like a Fool I step naively towards the abyss
But in the end, there lies a key to the mystery
Immemorial mystery

The undead shall take me across the bridge
Bridge over a chasm of madness and amok

I mix sacrificed blood with ashes
So in shall be burned by the holy flame and unified
With dirt of the earth

I pour my claret down to the grail of the initiated
Thus my life essence can merge with theirs
And we shall become one on mutual path
A path through Darkness to reach the Light

This is an initiation - the act of new birth
Transfiguration, in which death is the beginning

The very first step on the path of the Hierophant
The very first attempt to (create) an union between fire and air
To know the mysteries of destruction and creation
Eternity and nonexistence

I have died to resurrect
To soak enslaved souls of the blind with venom
I have died to resurrect
To bring you these mysteries
I am Thrice-Wise of the New Aeon!
