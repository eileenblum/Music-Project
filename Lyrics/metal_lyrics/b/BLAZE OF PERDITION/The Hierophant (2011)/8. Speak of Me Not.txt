There manifests the sovereign of the world
The highest of all angels, ruling over all
Whispers of His name resound in our hearts
Sacred words that can never be pronounced

Speak of me not - mention not my name
Speak of me not - lest ye be guilty of sin
For ye have no knowledge thereof
Speak of me not - at all
No words are able to define me
For I was, I am now, I shall be forever!

Hail Melek Taus, avatar of Ahriman!
Manifest! Shayitan! Melek al Kawat!

Tell us all Thy mysteries, hidden to the blind
Through the feathers of Thy tail we shall stare into His eyes
In the darkness of our minds we wake the blackest flame
Illuminated by the obscure light we invoke Thy sacred name

Burn! Burn! Let wrathful flames consume our souls
The Serpent King shall rise again and unify us all
Fly! Fly! Spread Thy wings across the sky
And awaken now the fiery Lord, who shall grant us liberation
Rise! Rise! With Thy Light the Darkness comes
To those, who are unworthy of the secrets you hide
Shine! Shine! Burning snake of flame divine
We eradicate-dedicate our lives to Thee

"Mention not my name or my attributes,
as strangers do, lest ye be guilty of sin..."

There manifests sovereign of the world
Brightest of the angels - the rulers of all
Whispers of His magic resound in our minds
Sacred words that can never be pronounced
Hark to His law!
