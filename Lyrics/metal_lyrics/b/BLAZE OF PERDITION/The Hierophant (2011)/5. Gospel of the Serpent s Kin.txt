I am condemned for eternity
For I have suffered a cosmic fall
And no grace nor goodness can wash my sin

For I am the one, who was born of the first sinner's blood
Breed of the one, who takes a stand against the holy spirit

I am Legion of light lost
For we are many - offsprings of the Holy Snake
We are the seed of YHVH - marked with opposition
Born in the womb of Mother Lilith

I shall be as a beam in the eyes of the worst sinners
As a straw in the eyes of the ones who praise the Lord
I shall be your anxiety, doubt and a maggot of perversion
The one who will make you address questions
And search for the answers you don't want to know

I am coming cloaked with a glow of the Morning Star

As an offspring of the Brightest One
I shall bear the cosmic sin 'til the end of me

I am Legion of lost light
For we are many - offspring of the Holy Snake
We are the seed of YHVH - marked with opposition
Born in the womb of Mother Lilith

Hear the Word of raging flame
Chant of sin and a peaen to will
Hear the Word of raging flame
Gospel of the Serpent's kin

I was raised from harlot's womb to spread doubt among you
Created for you to have an enemy
For what would your love of god be without me?

I bring you this light of free will
Promethean flame stolen from gods

This is my destiny
To bloom and rot again like the fruit of sin
To march proudly across the path of the fallen ones
And there's no turning back!
