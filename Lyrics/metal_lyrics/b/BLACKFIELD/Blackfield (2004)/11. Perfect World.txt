[Lyrics - Steven Wilson and Aviv Geffen]

Here on the other side
You've found a place to hide
So wave goodbye to your wasted life

You never seem to care
If God can hear your prayers
There's no sign of angels in the air

So light my way
And wish me sunny days
A wish will be reborn to a perfect world
So dry your tears
And tear up all your fears
A wish will be reborn to a perfect day

You always plead for time
To say what's on your mind
You're always scared
But making out you're fine

You leave no one to cry
On the day you die
They hate you more than you hate to be alive

So light my way
And wish me sunny days
A wish will be reborn to a perfect world
So dry your tears
And tear up all your fears
A wish will be reborn to a perfect world
