[Lyrics - Steven Wilson, based on an idea by Aviv Geffen]

I show the scars of every fear and doubt
I hurt myself to let the darkness out
Out

The days go by and nothing brings me joy
The glow was strong when I was a boy
But it's gone

And the glow
It goes
So slow
It goes

Cracks appear and passion slips away
Colours fade and turn to shades of grey
Fade away

If you knew the man I used to be
Please hold me under the sea
Or scratch my arms till they bleed
Save me
Will you help me to feel the glow?
