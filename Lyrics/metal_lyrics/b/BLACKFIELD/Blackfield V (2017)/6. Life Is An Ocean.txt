Life is an ocean
You got to swim.
Your eyes get salty
As you dive deep.

No clear through water.
Muddy bottle.
Life is an ocean.

Life is an ocean
You got to swim.
Your eyes get salty
As you dive deep.

No clear through water.
Muddy bottle.
No life juggling.
Far away.
Life is an ocean.

Life is an ocean.
