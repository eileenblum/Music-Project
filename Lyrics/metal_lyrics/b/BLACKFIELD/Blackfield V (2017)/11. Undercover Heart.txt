A victim of your desire
Walking through the flame
It burns you down
It burns you down

You draw a line and then cross it
To the other side
You've gone too far
You've gone too far

Have you seen it?
All your secrets are hunting you
It's too late, digging your lies for the truth
Your undercover heart beats for who?
You look so unhappy and blue

Another mistress stole your freedom
Grounded you
It's too late to awaken from your dream
All your sleepy plans end with tears
How will you sneak out from here?

The other day when I saw you
You looked so thin
It burns you down
It burns you down

Have you seen it?
All your secrets are hunting you
It's too late, digging your lies for the truth
Your undercover heart beats for who?
You look so unhappy and blue

Another mistress stole your freedom
Grounded you
It's too late to awaken from your dream
All your sleepy plans end with tears
How will you sneak out from here?

Have you seen it?

Have you seen it?
All your secrets are hunting you
It's too late, digging your lies for the truth
Your undercover heart beats for who?
You look so unhappy and blue
