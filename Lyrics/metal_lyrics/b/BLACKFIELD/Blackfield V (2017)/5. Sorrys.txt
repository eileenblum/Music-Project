You were born in the shade
Beautiful and pale
Your dad was always away

You gave birth in July
Since then my baby and I
Well, we hide away

Sorrys, seven years of sorrys
I was trying to catch your eye
Rolling into the river you were caught in
I saw you flowing and couldn't swim back

Well, now your silent spirit
It was too cold and shaking
Thought he saw you waving

I guess he wasn't ready
To be raised by someone unhappy
I took all the pain for him

Sorrys, seven years of sorrys
I was trying to catch your eye
Rolling into the river you were caught in
I saw you flowing and couldn't swim back

Sorrys, seven years of sorrys
I was trying to catch your eye
Rolling into the river you were caught in
I saw you flowing and couldn't swim back

You were born in the shade
Beautiful and pale
Your dad was always away
