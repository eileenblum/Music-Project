Breath in
Breath out
You had your shot you blew it all
Right now
Dead end
Your rescue team is miles away

People talk behind your back
In idle news become a clown 
For those you despise, those you never count
They cheered you while you crashed

Chasing your dreams
Paying your bills
Here you go again
Definite sign 
You are around
No itâs not a shame to be a family man

Stand still
Slow down
You had your shot you blew it all
Right now
Dead end
Your rescue team is miles away

Hard boy
Blank heart
How shallow can you get?
Stand still 
Slow down
Where else can you go?

Chasing your dreams
Paying your bills
Here you go again
Definite sign
You are around
No itâs not a shame to be a family man
