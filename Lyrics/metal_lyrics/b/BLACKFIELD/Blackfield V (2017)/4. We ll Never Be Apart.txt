You're walking on a cloud
You held the perfect hat
When I'm dragging on the fire
But we'll never be apart

You're traveling around 
I'm bleeding on the ground
It's just another day
But we'll never be apart

We'll never be apart

You harvest all you lack
I'm in a paranoid attack
Shivering inside
But we'll never be apart

You're juggling your guitar
Your crowd wants some more
While they're breaking through my door
But we'll never be apart

We'll never be apart

My music turns to glass
I saw every thing collapse
So I'll think of you
And we'll never be apart

We'll never be apart
