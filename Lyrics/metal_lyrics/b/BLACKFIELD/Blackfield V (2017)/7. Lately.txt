Lately there's no one on your side.
It's a shame, it's a shame you lost your magic touch.
You feel unhappy,
there are shadows more than light
You can't think right.
You're losing fight
and taking one step back.

You're losing grip and bleeding loud.
Your high hopes fall apart
And you're the one to blame.

You try to make it through the night
but the creatures crawl and get you down
And there's no get away.

Lately our dancing with your lies
No one cares
No one dares to stare you in the eyes.
You're thinking maybe
It's just a phase your past
As you're standing in this empty hole
you're calling life.

You're losing grip and bleeding loud.
Your high hopes fall apart
And you're the one to blame.

You try to make it through the night
but the creatures crawl and get you down
And there's no get away.

Everywhere I go
all I find it's shadows.
Everywhere I go
all I find it's shadows in me, of me.

You're losing grip and bleeding loud.
Your high hopes fall apart
And you're the one to blame.

You try to make it through the night
but the creatures crawl and get you down
And there's no get away.
