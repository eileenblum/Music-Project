My happiness is buried in the sand
In the backyard of my life, I can't remember where
Think it was October's rain that watched me cry
No one else was around, my happiness

Diving to the bottom of the sea
To find the wild white pearls which hide from me
But only empty shells were lying there
Like my happiness, my happiness

And when you see me running
Don't assume I'm running, to somewhere I belong
And when you see me crying
Don't feel sorry for me

My happiness is like a snake
Slides below the wooden floor, to the darkest place
And just sits and waits 'til no one's there
Just like my happiness, my happiness

And when I see you smiling
I come to you, I'm trying
To steal your smile for me
I hate you when you're glowing
The way you're walking, between my tears

And when you see me running
Don't assume I'm running, to somewhere I belong
And when you see me crying
Don't feel sorry for me

So when I die and October comes
And the leaves stop falling down upon the ground
And when the rain will stop, you can be sure
I found my happiness...
