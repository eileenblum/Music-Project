Hold me back and never let go
There's a jackal who grows in the cold
Don't you trust a man with songs
I've gotta find a place of my own

I would say every word you can take
There's a jackal who growls in the cold
Any bed can keep my body warm
I've gotta find a place of my own

Sometimes you need someone to take away your pain
When you're falling down, you're looking up for help

I've got to go to the valley below
Untraceable, no one can reach
You should stay on this wide open road
On the wayside lay all your dead dreams

Sometimes you need someone to take away your pain
When you're falling down, you're looking up for help

But how?
How can I find you my true love one?
How can I notice when a true love comes?
How?
