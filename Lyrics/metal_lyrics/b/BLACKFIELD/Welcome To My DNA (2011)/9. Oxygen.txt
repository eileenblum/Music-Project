So far away
We lost the way
Thereâs no oxygen left on our planet

Empty words
Break on our lips
Thereâs no oxygen left on our planet

Everyone,
Sleeping with their guns
Someoneâs going to die
So much noise
Weâre a bunch of boys
We were born to lie

I feel alive
Just when I cry
Thereâs no oxygen left on our planet

Things weâve said
And then regret
Thereâs no oxygen left on our planet

Everyone,
Sleeping with their guns
Someoneâs going to die
So much noise
Weâre a bunch of boys
We were born to lie

Everyone.

Everyone,
Sleeping with their guns
Someoneâs going to die
So much noise
Weâre a bunch of boys
We were born to lie

So far away
We lost the way
Thereâs no oxygen left on our planet
