Standing in the corridor, itâs just another day
You never were the kind of boy who ran outside to play
Youâre passing through the kitchen behind your motherâs back
While she says, âYour fatherâs on the plane.â

The rain against the windows, youâre waiting on the stairs
You double check the driveway for someone standing there
You calculate the chances of presents on your bed tonight
Daddyâs on his way

Daddyâs on the plane
Soon youâll meet again
Daddyâs on the plane
Thatâs what mother said
While you were waiting

Nothing ever happens in your neighborhood
You'd like to run so far away, if you only could
It seems that all the people have nothing much to say anyway
Daddyâs on his way

Daddyâs on the plane
Soon youâll meet again
Daddyâs on the plane
Thatâs what mother said
While you were waiting
