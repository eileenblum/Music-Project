Soon Iâll disappear into the deepest space
I wonât leave a trace
I can count on one hand all my glorious days
And cry out all the rest

What an unforgettable past
From the first day to the last
I was so in panic there
Watching mountains collapse
Dreams turn to dust
Weâre dissolving with the night

All the stupid bitches on the diamond day
Soon theyâll fade away
Should I wear the purple dress
Thatâs all she cares about
What a silly life she has

All those people who smile
Never cry
But itâs fine with me
With their feet on the ground
Blinded by the sun
Never asking more from life

Soon Iâll disappear into the deepest space
I wonât leave a trace
