Turn up the noise
Let's see if you can maintain your poise
Edge out the door
I'll feel it if you swim back to the shore

Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalala

I do believe
Iâm clinging to the wobbling trees
I do believe
Iâm clinging to the wobbling trees

Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalala

Your dress may be torn but you wear it well
All this and more may be in your spell
Four letter word but it isnât real
All this speed inside you
A sneer on the edge of your sanity
You bludgeon the sound like it's unappealing
Pouring your scorn on all pride and joy
All this fear inside you

Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalalala
Lalalalalalala
Lalalalalalalalalalala
