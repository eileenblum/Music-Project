Donât you fight, donât you fight
When your death is calling for a ride
Close your eyes, close your eyes
You wonât suffer there above the clouds

Donât you know thereâs only one way out?
And it comes when it comes
When itâs time
You're shedding some tears
And forget in a minute why
The reason you cried

One direction with no turning back
Soon it will turn to black
Soon it will turn to black

One direction with no turning back
Soon it will turn to black
Soon it will turn to black

Soon youâll find, soon youâll find
Today is just the future of the past
Donât you cry, donât you cry
You were just an accident of stars

Donât you know thereâs only one way out?
and It comes when it comes
When itâs time
Youâre shedding some tears
But forget in a minute why
The reason you cried

One direction with no turning back
Soon it will turn to black
Soon it will turn to black
One direction with no turning back
Soon it will turn to black
Soon it will turn to black

One direction with no turning back
Soon it will burn to black
Soon it will burn to black
One direction with no turning back
Soon it will burn to black
Soon it will burn to black

One direction with no turning back [x2]

Donât you fight [x2]

When your death is calling for a ride
