DNA, welcome to my DNA
Stupidly who wants to stay
With my DNA
DNA, you cannot fix what you get
Things that I try to forget
In my DNA

Can you forgive me?
For things that Iâve said
Things that Iâve done
Go now and never come back

DNA, we all got expiring dates
Trust me thereâs no get away
From my DNA
DNA, Wires of sadness and pain
Always remaining the same, my DNA

Disarmed by the music, thereâs bombs in my head
Youâll always get burned
Go now and never get back

My deadly venom, Soon Iâll be dead
Go now my lover
Go now and never come back
