Any day can be
The last day in your life
So make it an unforgettable time

Another sleepless night
And anxiety attacks
The doctor said you need some rest

But youâre always on the run
Tracing after a place to hide

You were born to your mom's shaking hands

The wolves are out tonight
And theyâre looking for a fight
âCause they run at the speed of light
It seems youâre home again

Donât forget to breathe
While time is running out
The clock tower in the window sky

Any day can be
The last day in your life
So make it an unforgettable time

Around the blinking lights
From a giant neon sign
You were born in the wrong, wrong year

Your soul is freezing ice,
But still they're asking for a slice
You had to feed those monster hearts
Well, youâre home again

You feel you had enough, itâs like the rising of the tide
Youâre a shadow just passing by
The wolves are out tonight
And theyâre looking for a fight
And they run at the speed of light
It seems youâre home again
