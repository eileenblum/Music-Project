Wherever I stay
Thereâs a feeling of so far away
I got no home town
I never put roots down

I bet you feel safe
Keeping your life in a cage
While I take my chances
But always collapses

I really donât know what it needs
To put my smile on
To turn the lights on
It always seems Iâm falling down
They think Iâm crazy
They think Iâm crazy

Thereâs a child in me,
Still hiding behind the old tree
But arenât we all hiding
âTill the moment weâre dying
And maybe Iâm free
But freedom just means that Iâm lost
It feels like Iâm driving
Without ever arriving

I really donât know what it needs
To put my smile on
To turn the lights on
It always seems Iâm falling down
They think Iâm crazy
They think Iâm crazy

Wherever I stay
There a feeling Iâm so far away
I got no home town
I used to run so fast
