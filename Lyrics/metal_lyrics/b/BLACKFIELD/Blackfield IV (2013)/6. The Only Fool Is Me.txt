It's late and I'm wondering why
I'm sitting here and watching the world spin around
What does it mean?
Tomorrow a new day begins
I know that no one loves for free
The only fool is me

She never came through my door
It was a dream
I'm sure that I saw her before
Or it was my tears
Someday our faces will cross
Too bad that no one loves for free
The only fool is me
