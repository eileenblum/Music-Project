Anyway I'll let you walk away
No revenge, no heavy tears to shed
Not a big role in my life you played
That's OK, I will just sit and wait
I don't mind if someone else will light your way
There's no rain and I'm ready for the springtime

I won't burn all the sweet letters you sent
I remember all the jokes you made
Everything is falling into place
Anyway don't forget the nights we spent
We stayed awake all night till the sunlight came
Singing birds now on their way for the springtime
