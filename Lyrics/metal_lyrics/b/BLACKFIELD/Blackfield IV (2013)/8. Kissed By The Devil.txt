I think it's over now
We always knew
The butterflies have gone
I get so cruel

Some sorry lover
Kissed the devil
And was speaking of you
It's easy to be lost
And to be found by you

I think it's over now
We always knew
The butterflies have flown
You get so cruel

Give me back now, give me back what I was giving to you
You left me at the wrong scene and rather blue

When she goes away I think of her
But when she goes away I think of her

I think it's over now
We always knew
The butterflies have gone
We get so cruel

Some sorry lover
Kissed the devil
And was speaking of you
It's easy to be lost
And to be found by you
