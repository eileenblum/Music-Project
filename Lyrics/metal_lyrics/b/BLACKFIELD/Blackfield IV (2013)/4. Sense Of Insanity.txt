Mother, have you seen the world today
They're shooting all over town
I'm a sinner
I'm not the one you prayed for
Doesn't matter
I'm still alive

I was walking on the clouds
You got to be brave
If you want to have crowds
Dreams guide to the mountain
I was standing like a priest
With his ancient Bible
I was preaching
The sense of insanity

Brothers, let's get down to the streets
Sure there's something you want to say
They won't hear you
Like they never did
All your heroes ran away

I was walking on the clouds
You got to be brave
If you want to have crowds
Dreams guide to the mountain
I was standing like a priest
With his ancient Bible
I was preaching
The sense of insanity

The sense of insanity

Dreams guide to the mountain
I was standing like a priest
With his ancient Bible
I was preaching
The sense of insanity
