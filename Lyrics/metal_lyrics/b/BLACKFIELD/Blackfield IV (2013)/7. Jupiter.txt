Once we were young We had no plans
What simplicity of love
We used to get it to get it all
We werenât scared to fail and fall

Now, all I can do is to stand, watch
Those new boys in the game
How theyâre laughing and having fun
Making rules under the sun

I wonât win her pretty eyes tonight
Itâs been so long since I played it right
Iâll get to Jupiter and halfway back
Before sheâll even notice Iâm around

They used to call me A city queen
But now Godâs playing his jokes on me
Iâm all alone far from the city
Iâve got no room no time for dreams

Wonât win in her pretty eyes tonight
Itâs been so long since I played it right
Iâll get to Jupiter and halfway back
Before sheâll even notice Iâm around

Once we were young We had no plans
What simplicity of love
We used to get it to get it all
We had no time to fail and fall

I wonât win her pretty eyes tonight
Itâs been so long since I played it right
Iâll get to Jupiter and halfway back
Before sheâll even notice Iâm around

Once we were young We had no plans
What simplicity of love
We used to get it to get it all
We had no time to fail and fall

Iâll get to Jupiter and halfway back
Before sheâll even notice Iâm around
