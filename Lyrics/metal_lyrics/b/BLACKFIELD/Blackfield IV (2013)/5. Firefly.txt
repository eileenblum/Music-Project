Firefly, I'm flying in circles til I die
I light my way within the lines
I don't know where I am

Firefly, on my tail there's dying light
I don't know how long it will last
Before I'll meet the ground

Moonshine over the mountain
No promised land, no true love waits
Speed up and then we slow down
The clocks in my skin are winding down

Firefly, I'm glowing in the dark tonight
Those tiny wings won't get me far
I'm pretty where I am

Firefly, those funny sparkles in the sky
You've got no purpose while you are
Guided by the wind
