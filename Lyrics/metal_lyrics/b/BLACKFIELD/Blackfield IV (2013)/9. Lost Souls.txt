I wish I had some more time
In this life
If I could turn the clock back to the start

To hug you, dear in my arms
That would restore my slow heart
Hey, let's stick around together
Then run away
There's a special place where all the lost souls

I heard you pray for more time by my side,
But no one cares about us beside us
We made it to here for our love
From this decade with precious love vowed

To hug you, dear in my arms
That will restore my sore heart
Hey, let's stick around together
Then run away
There's a special place where all the lost souls
