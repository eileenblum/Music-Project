Time never waited
He is not your best friend
Well, you've got to chase it

Inside her eyes the casino waits
Would you play now?
She always wins, necklace made of lies
Faking
It seems you held the wrong cards tonight
Faking
Faking

Pain is like a secret
You won't tell, you've got to keep it
When you're down and wasted

Inside her eyes the casino waits
Would you play now?
She always wins, necklace made of lies
Faking
It seems you held the wrong cards tonight
Faking
Faking

Inside her eyes the casino waits
Would you play now?
She always wins, necklace made of lies
Faking
It seems you held the wrong cards tonight
Faking
Faking
