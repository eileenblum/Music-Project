If I compiled
All my crimes and my lies,
Into amnesty,
Would you come back to me,

The smile on my lips
Is a sign that I don't hear you leaving me,
And I don't hear my own soul scream,

I'll read your lips,
Watch your scarf play at your hips,
And I know its true,
But I don't hear him call to you,
Don't blame yourself,
Don't change yourself,
Just want to be over you
Save you love,
Don't hate yourself,

If I compiled
All my crimes and my lies into amnesty,
Would you come back to me,

The smile on my lips
Is a sign that I don't hear you leaving me,
And I don't hear my own soul scream,

Don't blame yourself,
Don't change yourself,
I just wanna be over, you see,
And feel numb.
Don't hate yourself.
