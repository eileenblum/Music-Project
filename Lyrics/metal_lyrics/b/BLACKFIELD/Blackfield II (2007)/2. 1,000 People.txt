One thousand people yell,
They're shouting my name,
But I wanna die in this moment,
I wanna die,

And one thousand people smile
They're smiling at me
But I wanna die in this moment,
I wanna die,

No way to understand
Why I've become the way I am,

And then the sky if filled with stars,
I find a place inside my heart,

Some people can take a blow
And they won't ever drop,
But I wanna die in this moment,
I wanna die,

She will tell me she loves me
And she won't ever stop,
But I wanna die in this moment,
I wanna die,

A coldness in my soul
And I reach out for her to hold,

And then I watch her close her eyes,
It's only me that needs to cry

And if I stay with you,
Do you believe that I'll pull through?

No way to understand
Why I've become the way I am,

And then the sky is filled with stars,
I find a place inside my heart,
And then I watch her close her eyes,
It's only me that needs to cry,

One thousand people yell,
They're shouting my name,
But I wanna die in this moment,
I wanna die.
