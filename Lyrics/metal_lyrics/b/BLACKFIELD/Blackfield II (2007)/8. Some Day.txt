When you were a boy
You had no place inside your parents' world.
You were falling like the leaves
From an old and dying tree

You went to school,
But the teachers made you feel a fool
While the children played with joy
You're the one who were avoid

Some day you will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again

Show a smile,
They'd like to have you in the members club
They'll buy you drinks and tell you lies
Paper umbrella with some ice.

No one cares,
About that fucking pretty face you have,
It means nothing much this life
So find the highest cliff and dive.

Some day you will find a better place to stay
You'll never need to feel this way again
