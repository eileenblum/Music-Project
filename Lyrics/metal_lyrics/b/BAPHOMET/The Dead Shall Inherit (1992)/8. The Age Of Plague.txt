Conjure the vision of twisted remains
And the great empires have all fallen to ruins

As I crawl through the remains
Slabs of unburn and entrails
Of this curious and intrusive creature
I stop to think, humanity so powerful
And yet not able to keep itself alive

Could you conceive all of my mind's pain?

Come with me
Through my eyes you'll see
Pain you may never know
But in which your kids will grow

Terror!

Blinded by your human ways
You've brought about the world's decay
Peasants now to live in fear
The human race shall disappear
Twisted thoughts to save the day
You've bestowed on us the age of plague

Could you conceive all of my mind's pain?

Come with me
Through my eyes you'll see
Pain you may never know
But in which your kids will grow

As they grown in the chaos and burning remains
What will you tell them about humanity's defeat?
