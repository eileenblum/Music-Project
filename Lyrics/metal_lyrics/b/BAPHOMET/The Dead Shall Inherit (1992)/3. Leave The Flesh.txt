A hard life has twisted a fascination in my mind
It's hard to understand but the only one I could find
To release me of stress of everyday life
To rip at my flesh with razor sharp knives
To penetrate my skin with razors and hooks
The freedom I feel is often mistook
For self-mutilation, is all that they see
But they have no idea what's inside of me

I do not feel as though I belong in this world
I belong in the world of dreams and of death

Leave the flesh
Rip it away from your bones
Skinned alive
Leave the flesh
Self-mutilation is so divine

Leave the flesh
Rip it away from your bones
Skinned alive
Leave the flesh
Self-mutilation is so divine

Leave the flesh!
