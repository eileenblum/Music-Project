Warped to a different level of thought
Mind is corroding, becoming distraught
Childhood terrors return from the past
Living in torment, I don't think I'll last

Visions of death eroding my brain
Twisting my thoughts, haunting my sleep
Fear of being considered insane
My mental health, I don't think I'll keep

I feel as though I can't stop the pain
In which I live eaten alive through my dreams

Raped and beaten, molestation
Life's affliction destroys my mind

Raped and beaten, molestation
Life's affliction destroys my mind

Extreme torment of the mind
Subconscious, confusion reigns
Supreme childhood terror
Causes silent screams
