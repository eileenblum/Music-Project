Extracted for centuries
Viles of blood they have seized
For their purpose, a malicious crime
Plotted since the dawn of time

Why? The reason for my pain
It's not my fault
Must have been made to go insane
Living in this hell
I don't know why
I don't give up
I must die

Boiled in blood
Adrenalin pumping through my veins
Boiled in blood
No sane thoughts remain
Boiled in blood
Mind is being ripped and torn
Boiled in blood
How much more can I endure

Boiled in blood
Adrenalin pumping through my veins
Boiled in blood
No sane thoughts remain
Boiled in blood
Happiness is now devoured
Boiled in blood
Hatred leaves my brain scared

Emotions ripping through my head
I'd often wished I was dead
Growing feelings, despair
Now the hunt begins to flare
Psychotic intentions rip through my mind
Causing pain, it's so divine
Now I'm their prey, my blood they spill
Now it's time, I think I kill

Emotions ripping through my head
I'd often wished I was dead
Growing feelings, despair
Now the hunt begins to flare
Psychotic intentions rip through my mind
Causing pain, it's so divine
Now I'm their prey, my blood they spill
Now it's time, I think I kill

Why? The reason for my pain
It's not my fault
Must have been made to go insane
Living in this hell
I don't know why
I don't give up
I must die
