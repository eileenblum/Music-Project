Through deviant eyes do I see
Lives of pain and misery
Break free from the norm
See through the deceit

Blinded throughout life
Incomprehensible strife
Childhood naivetÃ©
Use your eyes to see

Seeing only what you're told
Deviate then your scold
Relieve the mental strain
Blinded never again

Take a look through the eyes of reality
And tell me what you see

Lies, anger, hatred are all my eyes can claim
Since the beginning brought in a world of pain

Blood from confusion spilled day by day
As long as we live our lives and dwell in tyrannic reign

I can't wait to break free
From the pain that's inside of me
A mental catacomb I'll not descend
So I'll struggle until the end

Lies! Pain!
Disease! Reign!
Strive! Kill! Mankind!

I can't wait to break free
From the pain that's inside of me
A mental catacomb I'll not descend
So I'll struggle until the end
