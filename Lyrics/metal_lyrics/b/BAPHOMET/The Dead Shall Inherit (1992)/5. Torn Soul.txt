The small box, the doorway
Solve the key, you will pay
Torn apart with huge hooks
Shredded up human slop
They will come, the masters
Pinhead and the chatters

Trapped inside their gore world
Feel the pain in your head
Try to hide, they'll find you
Tear you apart is their fun

Escape for now but they still lurk
Smell is foul, the blood flows
He returns from beyond
Decapitates in the ward
Runaway into a room
There they hide, feel your doom
Hooks will fly through your flesh
Eyes fall out, smash your head

Feel yourself come apart in there
Rotting flesh hurts through the air now
Splashing guts fall on the floor there
Mind explodes, there is gore everywhere

Soul is trapped inside their world now
You will pay for what you will done
Your suffering will be eternal
Tear you apart is their fun

We have eternity to know your flesh!

Doctor saves you but he wants you
You are his slave
Transformed being slowly flying
Rips off their heads
Morbid creature kills for pleasure
Tasting the fear
Dying victims hear their crying
Tormenting screams

Solved the riddle, changed the puzzle
Got sent to hell
Solve the riddle, changed the puzzle
Return to hell
Scared and peering at the door
Wishing to wake
Running faster to the doorway
Escape from beyond
