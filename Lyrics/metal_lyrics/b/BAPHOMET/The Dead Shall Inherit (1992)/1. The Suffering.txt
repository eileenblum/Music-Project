Suffer!

A life of pain I have lived
A death of pain I will give
My victims I chose with ease
The people I feel are the disease
So now the time has come
And now your time has done
The chambers I am now preparing
To witness all of your suffering

Ripping, carving, shredding
Burning, stretching, tearing
Stabbing, slashing, severing
Gouging, tasting your flesh

Torment, you lie in pain
Your flesh I carve away
Anguish, I crave more
Your blood I will spill
Agony as you rot in hell
In your pain I will dwell
Slaughtered, carnal toast
Your life now has ceased

Thoughts of death enter your brain
For your God you now pray
No release from your pain
Your mind decays

Your flesh and veins carved away
With precision so to save
All to keep none to waste
Your flesh decays

Your mind decays

Torture
Your mind for your soul
Your flesh for your soul
Your bones for your soul

I canât wait to experience and take your soul
Through you flesh and your mind I will roar
I canât wait to taste and savor your flesh
To watch while your blood spills from your chest

I canât wait to cause your death
Crawl right in and take your breath
I canât wait to feel your pain
And witness all of your suffering
