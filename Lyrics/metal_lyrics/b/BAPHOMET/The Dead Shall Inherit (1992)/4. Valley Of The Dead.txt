I have walked through the valley of the death
I have felt the cold grip of death
Being beckoned towards the dark
In the valley there is no light

I have tasted the pain and suffering
Of the unborn child and disease ridden flesh
The slaughtered and unwanted
Crying out in torment

Their cries and anguish scare my soul
A dream, or is it death? I do not know

I thought I was safe from the pain
But the suffering still remains
Put into a macabre life past
Eternal molestation is where I'm cast

The pain and suffering of which I have felt
Was not of the innocent but of the guilty ones

This place of horror
Eternal suffering
Built for reprisal
Against the vile

I can't wait until I'm dead
