There comes a time in everyone's
Life where they dwell in death
For some to escape the grip is what they seek
For others, it is what they seek

Deep in my mind and flowing through me
Is a plague that some can't see
To blame it on your music is quite absurd
When it's brought on by your society

Infection spreading through my mind
Turning my brain to pus
Confusion comes so easily
Infection of death I can't deny

To kill myself would it solve anything?
To fight this infection, is it worth it to me?
The confusion I face every day may be
Beyond comprehension because of the life you lead

Infection spreading through my mind
Turning my brain to pus
Confusion comes so easily
Infection of death I can't deny

Condemn us and say it's help
Torment for our good
Cut our freedoms down
Protest with what you differ

Challenged against everything in which we believe
Trapped in your society which tries to deceive
With an infection of death spreading through me
But one day our power will rise above thee
