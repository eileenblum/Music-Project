Christ!

The suffering and misery that I endure
To harbor thoughts so bizarre
Beyond impure

Mother, I'm here
To do all the things that you long for me to do

I love when we're in our reside alone
Late at night and you embrace me

Now you found another to do all the things
That we used to do at night in our room

Now I experience sexual neglect at 10 years old

Now your life means nothing to me
After all the pain you caused me
Just to see you with another guy
I guess I'm the only one was just a lie

I confront you with sexual frustration
Built up inside of me
But you deny the pleasure inbred by you
Don't worry, you'll not die in vain

The suffering and misery that I endure
To see your streaks of blood
Still run down the wall

You can now not leave me
But your death was not in vain
Even though your body's cold
I can still enjoy you in death

Mother!
