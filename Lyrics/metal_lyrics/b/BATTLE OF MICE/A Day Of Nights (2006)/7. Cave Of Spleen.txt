I chipped my toothI have a windows in my skullWrapped up in explosive glassThe voices sing beneathBellowI've never seen it unravelSo fast in such small handsThe secrets stick down in your throatThe crimes that make the time go fastI slip out of this placeThe glass cuts through my scabsIts never been so mean to knowIt all has to come outIt all has to come outMy mouth is full of bloodI hang on to every wordLittle claws down in my neckI've never seen a sky so blueMy mouth is full of bloodBut i saved some i or youAll my copper glasses rustedThis is not the end of the last wordI programmed itAnd i'm bleeding throughMy vein has got the best of meAnd all my proper wristHanging on disgraceI hear the footstepsCreeping on the stairs belowWrapped up in explosive glassVoices sing beneath belowI programmed itThis can't be every thing i've savedMy mouth is full of bloodAnd i saved some for youAll your copper glass has rustedThis just can't be all that i have madeI save some for youBut i'm not enoughAnd all the time has been the endAnd this just can't be all that i have savedAnd i programmed itMy glass is brokenAnd i slip out on the stairs
