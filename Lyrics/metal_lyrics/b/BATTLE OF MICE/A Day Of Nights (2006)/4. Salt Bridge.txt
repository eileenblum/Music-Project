I watch the hands move across your faceIf i were only bigMoving slowThe longest raceThe sharpest teeth sinkAnd i can't move and i can't seeThe needle clicks through all that laceAnd when the first leaf starts to shakeAnd make it's way to shield the groundDiamonds fall over your faceKnow that i'd give every drop of hateJust to see your trembling handsWave goodbye againI remember all those soundsI used to makeSo fake and loudTo cover things i should have learnedThe deepest hum that you engageThis dark red river down my drainAnd all the sons that take your placeThey all, fall, downRead your dream
