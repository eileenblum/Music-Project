All your sympathy’s goneOnto needles and pins And the scratch on your cheekWhen the dye is cast red Pillars melted to woodShallow breath that you held Fevered threat in the groundHome ward memories expound All the fevering pitchWhen you’re breath is run raw And the song of the straysIn the scratch on your cheek
