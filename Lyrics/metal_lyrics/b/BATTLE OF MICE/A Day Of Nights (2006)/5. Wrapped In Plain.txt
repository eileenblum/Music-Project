She walkedHer head hung downWatching her feetMove on their ownRestless handsGrasped at thingsNo one else could seeDark circles watchedHer eyes grow wideGuardians of her gazeThe high red flushOf something wrongStained the hills of her faceMidsummer blazedHer rotting cageDeath took his hat offAt her graveScarecrows drape the colored pagemarking giant mistakesGetting stronger in pain ofThese special thingsAll wrapped in plainAll wrapped in plainNo one sawPale shoulders shakePassed over forShiner thingsBrighter birdsWith bigger wingsTook up all of the cracksNothing left for the faintThis poisoned mouseWith paws on starsMottled gray furIgnoredShe quickly dreams of fallWhere brighter flowers diveAnd bendQuicksand'sRight handWeighs inLow weathersGreatest friendWet breath in shallow lungsThat drownHer handsLike dovesScarecrows drapeThe colored pageGaping selfish mistakesGrinning wider each dayGrowing stronger in painsOf these special thingsAll wrapped up in plainAn imbeciles glory daySpitting coins at the fadeOf these special thingsTwilight final soft claimAll wrapped up in plainAll wrapped up in plainThese special things
