Every time i think of pushing you down the stairsI lickMy lipsBut don't be upset, it's the only way i know howTo show you that i really careI lie to you every chance that i getAnd i make it just close enought to the truthThat you go for it every timeBut don't misunderstandI leave fingerprints outside of your windowIn the shapes of positive messagesI've got a present for youIt's made from pieces of my skinTrailing slices of pale lightThread and needle closing inRaking window from the paneAnd ready to commitSway back through gray beams of slateOn fingers cold and thin
