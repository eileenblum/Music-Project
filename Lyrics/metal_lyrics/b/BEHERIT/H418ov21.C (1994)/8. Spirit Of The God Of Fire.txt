Spirit of the fire 
And spirit of the flames 
Hear me and hear my voice 

O god of fire 
Mighty son of Anu 
Most terrifying among thy brothers, rise! 

O god of the furnace 
God of destruction 
Rise up, oh god of fire 
Gibil, in thy majesty 
and devour my enemies 

Rise up, O god of fire 
Girra, in thy power 
And burn sorcerers 
Who persecute me 
Burn them 
Destroy them 
Consume their powers 
Carry them away 

Spirit of the god of fire 
Thou are conjured
