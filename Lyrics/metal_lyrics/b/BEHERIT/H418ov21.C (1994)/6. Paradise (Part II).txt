And the part of Man
Is the part of witches
And the part of Man
Is the spirit of witches

Paradise of thy demonic host [4x]

You enter into house 418 ov 21st century
But remember now
What is new came from that which is old
And what is old shall replace that is new
And once again the ancient ones shall rule upon the face of the earth
Paradise, paradise of thy demonic host

Paradise of thy demonic host [4x]
Paradise [4x]
