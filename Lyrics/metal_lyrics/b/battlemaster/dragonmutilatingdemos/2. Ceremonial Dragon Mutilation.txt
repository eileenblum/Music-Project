Captured, a mighty red dragon was brought here under the cover of night, a secret temple ocean island like a fortress, the evil bastion for the creation of spells. The wizards overseeing from the tower as their troops drag the ancient aground. With potions of control it was battered and drugged, but not lastly shall it be dragged to its death...Dragged to its death!

The cloaked, with their spears they do guide him, guide him to the temple of blood. Helpless, the winged one learns to fear for the first time, awoken clawless and without its breath.  Bound with massive ropes and greatly wounded until a quick poison's released, the dragon dies quickly and painless without so much as a scream. This crime is abhor to magic. The destructive pleasure wont to calamitous misdeeds. Bone wand dissection: a maze of time-worn intestines trail out in defeat of the hoary soarer.
Ceremonial dragon mutilation, the carcass is ravaged. Now on to the head, sever the head. The wyrm has been desecrated. Feast the flesh, its soul we have murdered. The symbols on the altar they paint with blood, the blood of the dragon deceased. Incisions with a greatsword are given across belly and chest. Inside the fluids bubble and boil, acrid and putrid the gas. Drunk off the blood of the elder one, they notice not re-animation. A curse unto sadists and poachers...The Bracolich makes its attack!
