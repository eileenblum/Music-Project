Could it be the halfling brew? No
Could it have been the Elvin Wines?
No, but now I'm drunk and pissed
I sought the inn, a den of sin,
to find some work or better,
A pint, a gill, exotic swill,
to me it does nto matter
To sit among the henchmen and scum,
it has me heavy drinking
I toast my horn to anger adn scorn
Ah, this mead is making me warlike
Let the brawl begin
Humanoids, laughter and noise,
drinking together, slow service this tavern
An easy fight by torchlight
though I have a heart for battle
To sit among the henchmen and scum,
it has me heavy drinking
I toast my horn to anger adn scorn
Ah, this mead is making me warlike
Yay to you who has teh honor
to meet me in my challenge
Yay to you who has the pride,
the pride I have for combat
Fill my cup or it shall be your neck
Swift my axe, barrage of attacks
Red with the blood of the melee
Join the fun, there's nowhere to run,
this mead is making me warlike
To sit among the henchmen and scum,
it has me heavy drinking
Toast your horn to anger and scorn
Ah, this mead is making me warlike
