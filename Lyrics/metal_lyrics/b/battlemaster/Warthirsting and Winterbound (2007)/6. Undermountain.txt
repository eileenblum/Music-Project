We descend into the Undermountain
Underneath the icy northlands
The keepers of crypts we seek
Dungeoned cities stretch on for miles
Built around the layers deep
A dark world within the hollow peak
Enter epicenter of the denizens to the Underdark
Much here's ruled by evil
Hold your weapons tightly
Adventuring, what will the darkness bring?
We seek ye, dread mistress
Goblins, orcs and ogres ugly
Charging forth, the gate's protectors
Beasts in leather slow our hunt
Hack and slash the way asunder
Leaving behind the mutilated
To groan their last, a final curse
Enter epicenter of the denizens to the Underdark
Much here's ruled by evil
Hold your weapons tightly
Adventuring, what will the darkness bring?
We seek ye, dread mistress
Face the captors of torture
Meet the prefects of dark
Gaze at dimly lit castles
Below the world which you know
You smell her, your nemesis is near
Face this necropolis
Caves of the cursed and canyons of worse
Demons calling your name
We descend into the Undermountain
Underneath the icy northlands
The keepers of crypts we seek
Dungeoned cities stretch on for miles
Built around the layers deep
A dark world within the hollow peak
A circle of tombs to the frost-hued criminals
Noble they were from the womb of Lolth
A circle of gems, a thousand precious minerals
Open the gates to your dungeon
