It's his addiction, the mindflayer's addiction
Out from the cavern of before
Comes an ancient being
He damns his thirst; it's his genesis and his curse
Arcane scrolls, dimensions he's crossed
That bastard beast, he hunts
Cast spells from worlds long lost
That bastard beast, he preys
It's his addiction, the mindflayer's addiction
Somewhere in the shadows,
He waits, waiting for his time to strike
Insatiable thirst, violent taunts
They're his needs not his wants
No, no way, run, run far away
"Oh no, not my brain!"
"Yes, your brain! It shall be devoured!"
A victim to sustain him
Feed off the brain, drain the life juices
Devour the intellect, flayer of the mind
Flayer of the mind
It's his addiction, the Illithid's addiction
