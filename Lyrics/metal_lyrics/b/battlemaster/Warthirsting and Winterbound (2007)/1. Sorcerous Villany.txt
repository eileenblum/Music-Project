She, the moon looms her fullest bright
Evoke her now, hail thine foul magicks
Under the moon
Beneath the seven spheres and spell seal
Time washes away
Plans are made, we summon forth
She, named on the tablets
We read out unbinding verses
Unleash curses, unleash her hell
I enter the ceremony
I smash thine tablets
I lash out, I lash out mortal fools
Arcane hate and rage
Vast is the priestess' gray tome
Vast is the pain that shall endure here
So here we tread without willfulness to submit
To harness this arachnavillain
Utter aloud to this mutant of blasphemy
Only magicks so pure and spells unstoppable
Here on the hilltop we show we are masters
To she, the creature of webs and ice
Uttered aloud to this mutant of blasphemy
Magicks so pure and spells unstoppable
Her escape from us means war
We've enabled return
She shrieks out, she shrieks out
We don't fear her foul magicks
I have dismissed your ceremony
Under my guise of all sorcerous villainy
