Cold, ere his throne.
Ere winter seers the flesh to stone.
As ice upon his seat,
His will black ice, his gaze blue heat.
Giant, grand-ice tyrant, stoic king of these caves.
Epic, ageless relic, A timeless axe of the brave.
Terror, blue blade bearer, beast of his north.
Power, he is tower,
From mountains rocks thrown forth.

He lobs, his rocks.
Frost giant strength he proudly flaunts.
"Hahaha, come to die, you so small?"

No, none shall pass this way.
Fresh corpses of those he's kept at bay.
Life or death, we stay this path.
Advance head on to meet his wrath.

Frost giant strength he proudly flaunts.

His voice bellows out over the peaks.
"To you the gates are closed."
But you defy until he speaks.
"To me respect is owed.
Many I've conquered and I've enslaved.
My wars this realm has known.
I stand guard these mountains and caves.
I rule by beard and throne!"

Charge towards the largeling and best him at his gates.
Scream as we swing,
"On!" We battle with the frozen king
Charge towards the largeling and best him at his gates.

"Woeful am I,
My beard cut for your prize.
Woeful I am,
You reach the Underdark."
