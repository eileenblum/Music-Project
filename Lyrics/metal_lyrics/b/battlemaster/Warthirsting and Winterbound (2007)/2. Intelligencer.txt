Terraqueous world of simple design
There are plans for you yet
I, pure mind for body do pine
Still crept towards your domain
Now soaring there
Incorporeal
A great thinker he may be
Great white beard his badge of wisdom
Ideas has he, great beyond what man should see
So says me, heed my words or threaten balance
Ideas has he, great beyond what man should see
Follow smells of narcotic flowers
And dryad's burning hair to the sorcerer's lair
Here cosmic writs gaze all knowingly
Upon the birth of this entity
Still soaring there
Incorporeal
Testing him here
Seeing end near
Your scrolls that I seek are all I have come for
Far ahead of the ages you'd be
But I'll stop you premature, I am sure
I'm raceless and faceless, these eons never age me
Your somnolent conscious and puerile perceptions
Must not be awakened
No matter am I, I exist to survive
What is known I must know and reap all that is sewn
An end to power I have so incurred
To slow the turn of your weakling world
Now I leave on wings of cosmic rays
Cold colored quasars' light guides my way
Deep, deep space is where I go to learn
Here I stay, intelligence for which I burn
Deep, deep space is where I go to learn
Keep this pace, intelligence for which I yearn
