An unfathomed fate,
Magicks to uncreate
Now a mindslave,
Death to humble the brave
No escape from death,
Words have been spoken
Into the wizard's grin, never awoken
Casting, soon you will die,
it's your last mortal cry
Eviscerating, arcanus is thrust
Pound you to dust
Spell has been cast,
Your life won't last
Unfathomed fate,
Crushed through the spellgate
Now role to save versus
Deathmagick at minus two
No escape from death,
Words have been spoken
Into the wizard's grin, never awoken
Casting, soon you will die,
it's your last mortal cry
Eviscerating, arcanus is thrust
Pound you to dust
Spell has been cast, your life won't last
Follow the other cringing cowards to death's cold embrace
Life-killing deathfeast inside your rotted skeletal face
Struggle you may but sixty hit points or less and you're dead
Nothing is left but your magical items and what I have said:
Power Word: Kill
