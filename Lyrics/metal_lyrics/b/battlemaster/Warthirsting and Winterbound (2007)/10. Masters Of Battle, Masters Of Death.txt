Beyond that door lies
The greatest tyrant in the land
Arrival has at last come,
the coming of battle
Our fate to unravel
We storm into her throneroom,
through a layer of web
Littered with dead
The fierceness of her fortress, a wintry chill
She's craving the kill
The enemy of good, an enemy to al
The drowess must fall
I'll see your blood on my steel
Brave or dumb to follow this far
Warm spray of blood on my face
I'll be pleased to hand you demise
No, your crimes are unnatural,
You reek of treachery
You are filth, you are all that is to be despised
I'll see your blood on my steel
Brave or dumb to follow this far
Warm spray of blood on my skin
I'll be pleased to hand you demise
Dance in combat with teh Lich-queen
It's your time to die
Darkelf shrieks her witch-scream
Hellslut and a bloodfiend
Sending you to hell
Arrival at last come, the coming of battle
Our fate unraveled
We stormed her throneroom
through a layer of web
And severed her head
Our journey is done
