Her wails climb out from deepest
Burial to beckon thine worship
Our thirst be whetted only after
Her head's upon our spear
Fiends, they're fiends, guarding their queen
Your abomination screams
At the top of her lungs in tongues
Under them, under the woods
Under these skeletal woods,
They have arrived to slave whoever comes to find
"Back in to line!" A sacrifice for spiders
Evil affiliation, there's simply too many to fight
Under them, under the woods
Under these skeletal woods,
They have arrived to slave whoever comes to find
"Back in to line!" A sacrifice for spiders
Your abomination screams at the top of her lungs
Some of us, will surely be killed
But all of us will fight back to back
All of them must be murdered
Only one of them is the bitch we must seize
The gnomes, they guide us further
Further past Stygian seas
The Lichen, it glows like the moonlight
Bringing us back out the dark
The driders cross their bone-bridge
Defending what shouldn't exist
A final fight before us, her slaughter-webs in sight
Time its now to end this,
"I've bested your dungeoncrawl!"
A great trophy your bloated womb is to me
Lascivious bitch-queen
The gnomes, they guide us further
Further past Stygian seas
The Lichen, it glows like the moonlight
Bringing us back out the dark
Dark, her endless night
