So it has been, is now, shall be
Learned we are in this thaumaturgy
To cancel a life with words of strife
Using magicks so old, magicks so cold
To end your time, a spell of mine
Steal your life and send you to the next
Necromantic text
Magicks so old, magicks so cold
Deathmagick
Soon hear the words who herald hatred
Soon feel their grip
Soon die by curse cast by black wizards
Succumb to evil, death quench their awful thirsts
Read they red, the glowing texts?
Burn it red, the rhythmic hex?
So it has been, is now, shall be
Learned we are in this thaumaturgy
To cancel a life with words of strife
Using magicks so old, magicks so cold
To end your time, a spell of mine
Steal your life and send you to the next
Necromantic text
Magicks so old, magicks so cold
Thsi black spell of death has meant to end you
A raging mage has memorized
to teach you just what deathmagick means
