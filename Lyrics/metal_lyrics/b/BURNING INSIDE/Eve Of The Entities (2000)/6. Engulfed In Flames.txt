Deep in the carpathian forest a dark spirit is born
Countless rituals of lust her soul to evil is sworn
An entity of murderious obession
For this lies no explanation
Her torture and blood fixations
Brought mass destruction of virgins

Indulgin her sadistic fantasies
Was her greatest pleasure in life
She infilicted bodily pain all for personal gain
The sight of blood and suffering calised her endless ectasy

Slashing with razors, needles inserted
Screaming in ecstasy as she bathes
She loved to torture hot pokers to genitalia
Insisting it regained her beauty

Blood thirsty sadomasochist
Engulfed in flames
Murderous tortured soul
Engulfed in flames

Resurrection the dark consumes the light
Awake from the sleep of immortality
Rise with the dead and feed again
This burning inside a lust for blood

Beware in the dark who I will find
The eyes of the unholy guide thee
The death of another is youth to me
Through forever young reflection reveals nothing

Slashing with razors, needles inserted
Screaming in ecstasy as she bathes
She loved to torture hot pokers to genitalia
Insisting it regained her beauty

Trapped in confinement forever she breathes
Spawn of evil is what they say
Diabolic blood ritual
Engulfed in flames
Sorcery of blood magic
Engulfed in flames
