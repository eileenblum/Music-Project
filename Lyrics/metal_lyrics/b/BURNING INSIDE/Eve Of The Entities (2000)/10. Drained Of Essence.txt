Would you follow me into dark
Even though you are as scared as you are?

Look into the past
To retrieve vivid thoughts
Scars from youth
Reflect unwanted memories

Dark corners of my mind
Unfolds the pain I abide
Drained of all that exist
And my soul wastes away

Drained essence my will will waste away

Dark corners of my mind
Unfolds the pain I abide
Drained of all that exist
And my soul will waste away

Look into the past
To retrieve vivid thoughts
Reflecting upon my youth
Leaves me drained
