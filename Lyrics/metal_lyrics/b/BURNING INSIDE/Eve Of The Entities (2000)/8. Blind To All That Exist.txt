Sacred tomb robed in wait
Chanting incantation bound by faith
Pagan belief stronger evermore
Stand in courage and be burned for serenity
Stand in courage, live another day
No, I am not afraid

Kindle the torches amass the masses
The hunt begins now find the witch
A burning within an eternal flame of sin
The desire for sorcery and alchemy
We will live again
Generations will pass though we will exist

Pagan blood within my veins
Over mindless creatures I reign
Our ancestors crown will never fall
The blood of the pagans remain
Stand in courage, live another day
No, I am not afraid

Sacred tomb robed in wait
Chanting incantation bound by faith
Pagan belief stronger evermore
Stand in courage and be burned for serenity
