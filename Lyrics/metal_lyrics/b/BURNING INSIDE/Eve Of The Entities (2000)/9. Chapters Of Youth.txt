Emptiness no craving for life
Sorrow the only sense inside
Longing for wisdom and truth
Wish these lies in the boundaries of youth

The past present and future exists now as one
Chronicles of life tantalize my hatred to view

Knowledge is the key to your growth
But inside the lock the truth will show
The hinges will open the gates to the fiction that you create
When your soul is found then you will see your fate

The past present and future exist now as one
Chronicles of life tantalize my hatred for view
