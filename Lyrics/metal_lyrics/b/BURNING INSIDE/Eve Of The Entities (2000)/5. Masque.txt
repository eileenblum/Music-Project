Creating an image for the world to see
In a world alone with no reality
These roles you portray are transparent
To the ones that are around you

Inner struggle to keep my confidence
Mask my troubles through innocence
Try to become something your not
No life or own though

Dark corners of your mind so clearly defined
Burning rage explosion is confined
Fueling my hatred soon out of control
Lost within a lifeless soul

In a world of lies created by you
You mask your fears but your weakness shows
You promise these roles that you cannot fulfill
