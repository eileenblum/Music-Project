Interpret data to fit your belief
That is the nature of humanity
You have become now your own biggest threat
I am anointed the saviour of men

The righteous master of all they will see
There can be no hope for them but me
Preparing a faith as strong as iron chains

Redeemer

The gaps in their knowledge have made it clear
They must be ruled by starvation and fear
Abdicate all responsibility
To the redeemer, the one that must lead

The righteous master of all they will see
There can be no hope for them but me
Preparing a faith as strong as iron chains

Redeemer
