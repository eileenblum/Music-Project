You can survive a thousand years in space.
You can stand on the new world.
You have already won.

This is the time to claim what's mine, don't step any closer
The web you weave when you aim to deceive
Now look what you've done to me
Your heart lies heavy and now I'm ready

My skin gleaming in the sun

How can I take what you gave away so foolishly?
No more will I wait to fix your mistakes, how blindly you pushed me away
You heart lies heavy, now I'm ready

My skin gleaming in the sun
Now nothing else matters, I've already won
