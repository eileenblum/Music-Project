They blindly accept conventional wisdom
Imagining that there is nothing more
Sheldrake said the speed of light is not constant
If that can change then so can I
Time to commit to a new course of action
Time to stop repeating all the same hate
Put away small things, anxiety and doubt
I can begin to change my life now

In a single moment, the point of no return
No return to my self-destruction, circling my own defeat

They said I was nothing but that is not true
How could I survive after all I've been through?
That is their fear, and this is the truth
A revolution begins inside you
A revolution begins

Revolution and redemption at last
Atonement, escape from the dark side of black

In a single moment, the point of no return
No return to my self-destruction, circling my own defeat
