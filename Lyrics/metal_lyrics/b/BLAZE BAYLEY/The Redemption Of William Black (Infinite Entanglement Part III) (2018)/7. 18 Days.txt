Weeping as no one before her has wept
A feeling of panic takes that takes all her breath
Emotions like lava are burning inside
Burning with hatred, self-pity and lies

A circle of doubt and of fear closes in
Choking it blinds her to every good thing
She can't face living if he's not around
How much will his broken promise cost now?

He promised he would never leave her again
Promised his days as a soldier would end
Her and their baby would always come first
Now they want him back for one more mission

He tries to calm her and move to the door
Says he'll be gone 16 days and no more
Thinks of his comrades, he owes them his life
Now forced to choose between them and his wife
Falls to her knees, begging don't go
Weeping, pleading, begging don't go

A hero in her eyes, now that hero has died
A hero in my eyes, now that hero has died
I was a hero in her eyes, now that hero has died
He was a hero in my eyes, now that hero has died

18 days passed and still there was no word
She took the hand of his daughter, his world
Feeling abandoned, forsaken betrayed
She lays them in darkness and drains life away

Weeping as no one before her has wept
A feeling of panic takes that takes all her breath
Emotions like lava are burning inside
Burning with hatred, self-pity and lies
Falls to her knees, begging don't go
Weeping, pleading, begging don't go

A feeling of panic takes that takes all her breath
Weeping as no one before her has wept
