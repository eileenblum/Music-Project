Here is a prophecy.
Two stars will fall from the western sky, on a winters night
The first our dead brother
Though he looks not like us,
Be sure he is our brother, come from the eagle spirit
We must pray our prayers of light for him
If our prayers of light be strong enough
If our belief be strong enough
He will rise, and he will know he is home
The second star is a golden ship
Strange gods of gold will hunt us
They are come to eat us all
Every one of us devoured until there is no memory or trace of us
Come to enslave our great mother
Come to violate her
This all shall come

There are things that I'll never see, that will stay a memory
That's where they'll always be so far, far away from me
Things that I'll never know, now that I am here
Dreams I will always hold as dear as the life that I lost

Shoulder to shoulder they are ready to fight
Fight for their future, fight for their life
As brothers and sisters, they stand against the wind
Standing hand in hand 'til the battle begins
Their children are slaughtered, their families destroyed
They are starving to death, a bloody revenge is their right

Spirit of the eagle, this land is their home
Hunted down and murdered, here in the place they were born

Moment to moment, here on this sacred ground
They have been living in harmony
Now the redeemer, the new conquistador
Self-righteous master is revealed to all

He plans their extinction, great mother enslaved
Ravaged and polluted, they are living their final days

Spirit of the eagle, this land is their home
Hunted down and murdered, here in the place they were born
I found my redemption, ancient prayers of light
Brought me from the darkness, here is the place I belong

They will never break us, we have to believe
They will never break us if our spirit is strong
If we can hold on to what we believe
They will never break us if our spirit is strong

Their children are slaughtered, their families destroyed
They are starving to death, and bloody revenge is their right

Spirit of the eagle, this land is their home
Hunted down and murdered, here in the place they were born
I found my redemption, ancient prayers of light
Brought me from the darkness, here is the place I belong
Here is the place I belong

Things that I'll never know, now that I am here
Dreams I will always hold as dear as the life that I lost
