All of us could die today you know that's just a fact
Don't give your life easily there is no going back
Remember why you're fighting and just try to keep your head
If your brother falls then shout, stand up you're not dead

Your prayers of light
Have saved my life
Your prayers of light
They made me believe that I could stand again and fight

They have no compassion, empathy or sympathy
Every one of us they will feed into their machine
We are all in pain and we are fighting for our life
Pain tells you that you're alive you are still in the fight

Your prayers of light
Have saved my life
Your prayers of light
They made believe that I could stand again

Now we stand and fight

I am not as I was
From darkness I have come
Against angels of gold
I now stand with you all

Your prayers of light
Have saved my life
Your prayers of light
They made believe that I could stand again

Now we stand and fight
