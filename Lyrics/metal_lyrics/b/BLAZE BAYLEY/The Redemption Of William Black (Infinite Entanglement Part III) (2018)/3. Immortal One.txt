Three golden angels
First come for cleansing annihilation
Three golden angels
Second come to build his holy city
Three golden angels
Third brings him to rule us in his glory

Warriors of the new master arise
Unholy unclean unbelievers will die
Preparing a place for our saviour of souls
To make for him now a perfect new world

Immortal one
All will be done
Immortal one

Pembridge:
They are ignorant and without souls, without god.
Worship of animals, plants and the air.
Signs of witchcraft and of the devil are clear.
Every trace of that evil must be eradicated
For my glory, in my honour, with my power.

My 3 golden ships will arrive as angels,
32 years between each one.
In the belly of my third angel I will be.

Warriors of the new master arise
Unholy unclean unbelievers will die
Preparing a place for our saviour of souls
To make for him now a perfect new world

Immortal one
All will be done
Immortal one
Three angels come
Immortal one
