Look into the western sky
On a winter solstice night
If two stars falling you see
Then begins the prophecy
Sail across the midnight sky
Like a star the eagle brother will fall

The first true sign

The great darkness then will come
Soon all of you shall be gone
Tears you cry will burn your face
As your world they desecrate
Sail across the midnight sky
Like a star the eagle brother will fall

The first true sign

Oceans of tears you will cry
Tears that will not save your life
Only with your prayers of light
Can you make a hero rise

Sail across the midnight sky
Like a star the eagle brother will fall

The first true sign

You are home
