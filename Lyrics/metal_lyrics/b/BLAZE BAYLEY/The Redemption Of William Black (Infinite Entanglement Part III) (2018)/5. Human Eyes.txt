Look up and see what can't be seen by human eyes
This hand reaching has touched the lost believers face
The certainty of these years has crumbled like a frozen rose
Frozen by a pitiless self in the torment of a cold deceit

Walk where no one else can walk
Stand where no one else can stand
Then feel every moment
Hold what no one else can hold

Hate will last here longer than the smell of death
All that was lost they vow they will not forget
Cleansing your own thoughts of reasons to live for your dream
They wait for you to fail and say your demise will surely come

Walk where no one else can walk
Stand where no one else can stand
Then feel every moment
Hold what no one else can hold

Future is past was I the only one who dreamed
Where are you now is this where you thought you'd be
You are unknown by those who approach all of these open graves
Tomorrow's yesterday is eulogised and carved into this stone

Walk where no one else can walk
Stand where no one else can stand
Then feel every moment
Hold what no one else can hold
Look up and see what can't be seen by human eyes
