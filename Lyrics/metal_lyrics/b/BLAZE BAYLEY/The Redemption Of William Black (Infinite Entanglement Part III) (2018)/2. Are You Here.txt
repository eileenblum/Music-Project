Broken burned and damned, I'm the impossible machine
The remnant of a more complete and beautiful dead dream
Born from dark ambition and the worst of human thought
I never asked to be this way, but I accept it all

Are you here

Each second of each minute of each hour I search for you
My glory walks along now hand in hand with my own doom
I heard your voice so many times when I thought I was dead
Illusions of the human was it only in my head

Are you here
Are you here
You told me to feel
Are you real

Beyond the confines of atomic physics lies a truth
One thousand times smaller than a proton it is in you
The particle accelerator has no fear of god
Is all creation now explained by Peter Higgsâ boson?

Are you here
Are you here
You told me to feel
Are you real
