I have a noose around my neck
it is spun from my hopes and dreams
the ones who wronged and now are choking me

The hanging man, I am not hanged
to martyr's breath I must now cling
until I face those who did this to me

On and on, I'm cursed to live
cursed with life until I
have done what must be done
I am the man...
Who would not die

They made these gallows from black light
but the shining light of this truth
will make them crumble and I will be free

To take back what once was mine
and then from gallows of bright steel
Hang them with the same rope
they made for me

On and on, I'm cursed to live
cursed with life until I
have done what must be done

Hang them high with their own lies
when their necks break then I
have done what must be done
I am the man...
Who would not die

[Solo]

On and on, I'm cursed to live...
I am the man who would not die
