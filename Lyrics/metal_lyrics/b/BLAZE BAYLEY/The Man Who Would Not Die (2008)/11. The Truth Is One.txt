Walking down the path of your life conditions
facing up to everyday's contradictions
to find the inner quietsource of your bliss
all you need to know is there

Assume the legacy of the few who dared
and don't you be afraid
embrace the paint
unlock the power
accept nature living in you

Eternity is now
Forever is today

The truth is one the answer is there
the truth is you the truth is me
Eternity is now forever is today
the truth is you the truth is me

The truth is one

Forget the promises
the fear of millions
the cause of their own future self extinction
dance to your true inner voice

Let the flame of true will burn
and feel how life force takes control
just when you thought no one would found you
the whole world shall surround you

Eternity is now
Forever is today

The truth is one the answer is there
the truth is you the truth is me
Eternity is now forever is today
the truth is you the truth is me

The truth is one
