I did not see
I did not hear
I did not feel while you were gone
My blood was cold, I was a stone
You were my own, while you were gone

Because you are my beating heart
You are the reason why I breathe
these are the things I realized
While you were gone

Something is wrong
inside my brain
and then my eyes start to complain
Time slows right down, my days drag on
Don't want to live, when you are gone

Because you are my beating heart
You are the reason why I breathe
these are the things I realized
While you were gone

[Solo]

I did not see
I did not hear
I did not feel while you were gone
My blood was cold, I was a stone
I was on my own, while you were gone

Because you are my beating heart
You are the reason why I breathe
these are the things I realized
While you were gone
