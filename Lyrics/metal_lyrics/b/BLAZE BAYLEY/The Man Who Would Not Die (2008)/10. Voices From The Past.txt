Never start a fight you cannot win
you'll be in a war that never ends
making promises you cannot keep
Living with regrets that make you weep

Weeping I have tried to close the door
on the very past where I was born
shutting out the past so I survive
but now I hear something in my mind

Voices from the past
Voices call me back
Voices in my head
Voices of the dead

Now I'm hearing Voices
Voices from the past
Now I'm hearing Voices
Voices call me back

If I don't face the problems that I have
I know that they will just keep coming back
Even though I know that is the truth
still deny that I could ever choose

Voices from the past
Voices call me back
Voices in my head
Voices of the dead

Now I'm hearing Voices
Voices from the past
Now I'm hearing Voices
Voices call me back
