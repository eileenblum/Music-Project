Right was really wrong
wrong was really right after all
your light is real darkness
my darkness is real light
guiding the path of this serpent hearted man

Reborn trough the power of every new day
not overwhelmed by the shadows of yesterday
in the eternal today I live
the ways of the universe manifest in my being

Right was really wrong
wrong was really right after all
your light is real darkness
my darkness is real light
guiding the path of this serpent hearted man

The joy of the past and the sorrow of yesterday
are now left behind with my old shedded skin
fragmented and lying now in dead ground
for I accept and face then whatever today may bring

Right was really wrong
wrong was really right after all
your light is real darkness
my darkness is real light
guiding the path of this serpent hearted man

Three cycles of life now flow inside of you
the human the animal the spiritual man
and now in accord with all of natures way
the track of this serpent are now there for you to begin

Right was really wrong
wrong was really right after all
your light is real darkness
my darkness is real light
guiding the path of this serpent hearted man
