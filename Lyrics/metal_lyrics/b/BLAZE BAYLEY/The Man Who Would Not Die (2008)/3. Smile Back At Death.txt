Blessed father what is that the gods will for me
Is it their will that I should do this duty alone
I am a slave and what difference can I possibly make
When all I do is what I must so I don't die this day

Home
Let me go home

When death smiles at you
so the father said
There's nothing left to do
Smile back at the death

I will show them blood
They will chant my name
Time for the tyrant to fear

Gladiator protector
Father to a murdered son
Gladiator protector
I will see my vengeance done

In eternity echoes what we do in life
With honor and strength I must keep this true alive
Now its time for justice see the emperor defied
The last wish of dying man
To pursue what is right

Home
Let me go home

When death smiles at you
so the father said
There's nothing left to do
Smile back at the death

I will show them blood
They will chant my name
Time for the tyrant to fear

Gladiator protector
Father to a murdered son
Gladiator protector
I will see my vengeance done

They just don't know they are conquered
They continue to fight
Would we be any different
Wouldn't we bark and bite

For all that we hold dear
For your families and our life
Like each breath is our last
As we fight not to die

In this arena
I who will not die won't salute you
In this life or the next
My vengeance I will have

You turned me into a warrior slave
You made me kill them all
But as time goes you will see
It is just one more kill
Then it's done
