We don't belong
we have no home
and see no boundaries
in this delighted world

When we have no certainty
they question our existence
Our right to live and breathe

The questions without answers
The answers without questions
a catch-22 system
We are trapped down in
a crack in the system
...crack in the system

Our DNA and fingerprints
and numbers day to day
feed into their machines

They're eating all our dreams
they question our existence
Our right to live and breathe

The questions without answers
The answers without questions
a catch-22 system
We are trapped down in
a crack in the system
..crack in the system

I believe we are so much more
than they can see
than just a game of words and codes

They send us back and forth
and round and round we go
but deep inside
we're never moving at all

[Solo]

When we have no certainty
they question our existence
Our right to live and breathe

The questions without answers
The answers without questions
a catch-22 system
We are trapped down in
a crack in the system
...crack in the system
