I wake up to a grinding day
In a grinding week
In a grinding month
In a grinding year
Grinding away

The daily grind is grinding me
I just go to work
then I go back home
and I try to sleep
and I go to work again

I'm waiting for my life to begin
Waiting for something to believe in

My dream it is just so real
there I am on stage
singing in my band
for some crazy fans
I'm as tough as steel

And that is what I thought was real
it's amazing how
you can fool yourself
and believe this things
when you dread each day

I'm waiting for my life to begin
Waiting for something to believe in

Grinding on through restless sleep
where my mind  repeats repeats
Grinding on and on and on
Where has my precious life time gone

Grinding away
grinding all my life away
Grinding away
I must start my life today

I'm waiting for my life to begin
Waiting for something to believe in
