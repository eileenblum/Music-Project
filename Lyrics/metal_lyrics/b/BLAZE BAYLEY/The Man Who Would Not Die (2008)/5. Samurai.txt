I am absolutely now prepared to pay the price
Even if I ultimately pay with my own life

Where did you give everything, to sacrifice it all
and without the will to die I know that I can't win

No mind, no pain, nothing can hold me back
Now I stand without fear in the valley of death

I'm willing to die, die, willing to die
Samurai
Die, willing to die, like a Samurai

Deep within my self is a decision that I made
to win it all, overwhelm those
who would want to bury me

To never, never yield and even with my only ?sprat?
to remain defiant, never to admit defeat

No mind, no pain, nothing can hold me back
Now I stand without fear in the valley of death

I'm willing to die, die, willing to die
Samurai
Die, willing to die, like a Samurai

Die!
Are you willing to die?
Die!
Are you willing to die?
Like a samurai

[Solo]

No mind, no pain, nothing can hold me back
Now I stand without fear in the valley of death

I'm willing to die, die, willing to die
Samurai
Die, willing to die, like a Samurai
