In 1932 Einstein and Bohr can't be reconciled
It was a war of ideas that will rage until they will both die
The quantum and classic theories will not align for 30 years
And even it's difficult to believe in the new truth is real
Nothing exists until it is observed

Can consciousness be transferred will brewer
prove that it can be done
Not reliant on breathing or the body
with which you were born
Nothing exists until it is observed

March
Marching on through the fields of dead
Stretching across the whole universe
Connections of all that can be to infinity
Now
Now you are facing certain death
The questions go round in your head
Do choices you make mean a thing
How will you die

Infinite Entanglement
