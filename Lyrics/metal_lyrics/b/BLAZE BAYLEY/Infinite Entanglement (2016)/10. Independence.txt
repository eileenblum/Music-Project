Itâs hard to beat someone with nothing left to lose
Itâs hard to beat someone fighting to preserve their way of life
And if they beat me down then I will rise again
Now I refuse to die I will be defiant till the end

So here I stand alone with nothing left to lose
And all the storms of life will now stop me
Taking my revenge

Everything I took for granted appears to be gone
In the mirror I see someone, I donât recognize
Where are the answers that I once believed I knew
And now in this place I stand alone

Independence

My face appears in a nightmare that now become real
I dread my walking hours because of what I may find
You took the role of deceiver and you played it well
And now in this place I stand alone

Independence

From them all
See the fall

Itâs hard to beat someone fighting to preserve their way of life
And if they beat me down then I will rise again
Now I refuse to die I will be defiant till the end
So here I stand alone with nothing left to lose
And all the storms of life will now stop me
Taking

Independence

From them all
See the fall
Rise again live without fear
