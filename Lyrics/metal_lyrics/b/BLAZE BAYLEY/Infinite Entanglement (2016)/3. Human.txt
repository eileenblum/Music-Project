One look is all it takes you to decide what I am
Without hearing a single word I speak
You think you know everything about me who I am
The mutant joke, the tinman, the crazy freak

Human
Am I human
I am man I am machine
You just don't know what it means
To be human

You just don't know how it feels to question all that is real
Am I machine or am I flesh and blood
Blood and electrons they are just the same inside me
Which one of them is not sustaining me

Human
Am I human
I am man I am machine
You just don't know what it means
To be human

Human
Am I human
I am man I am machine
You just don't know what it means
I am man I am machine
I accept now what is me
I am human
I am human
I am me
