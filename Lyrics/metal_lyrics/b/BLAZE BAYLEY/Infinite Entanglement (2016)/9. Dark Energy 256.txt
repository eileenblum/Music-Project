I canât feel my skin and everything looks different now
As though I see through eyes that are not mine
All my scars are gone and now donât ache and I donât bleed
What are these dreams that come of death and cold and blood

The broken back of brotherhood do what youâve always done
Get what you have always got and lie to everyone
As small as they make you feel they will never be that big
Rejoicing in the death of every one that have ever lived
Dark Energy

Is something else controlling me now I am scared to sleep
In the fear of memories that dreams may bring
The realization of my transferred consciousness
I am unshackled from my own mortality

The broken back of brotherhood do what youâve always done
Get what you have always got and lie to everyone
As small as they make you feel they will never be that big
Rejoicing in the death of every one that have ever lived
Dark Energy
