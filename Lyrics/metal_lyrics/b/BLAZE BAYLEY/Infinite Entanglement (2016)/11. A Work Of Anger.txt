Where are you
You said my truth must be this
Decided dictated for me be you
Iâm denied I am cold this ghost whispers loud
From a shadow in the ruin of a mind on his own

Where are you
You said in space between space
There will be an answer waiting for me
Will I know itâs from you there are no words or sounds
From the shadow should I whisper prayers I donât believe

Can you see the future from where you are now
Can you see the truth of what youâve done to me
Remembering the mornings and each dawn of shame
The rising sun did not shine our sins away

Here I am
Here I am
Here I am where are you
The force guiding the stars you and me too
What is life what is man do you think you can choose
Beyond words beyond thought Iâm connected to you

Here I am
Here I am
Your work of anger
Here I am
