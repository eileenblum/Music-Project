Faced with the truth that theyâre all out to get me
I donât know if I can survive
Can I hold my own when all that is left of me
Is what I can hold in my mind

I donât waste time feeling sorry for myself
Now I have put all that behind
Itâs never easy and itâs never fair
Iâm determined they wonât win this time

Stars are burning
Burning pure and bright
Stars are burning
Burning in your eyes
Burning all your life
Burning you alive

Everything is changing all of the time
And there is so much beyond my control
Iâll make my own life Iâll make it mean something
Even on my own

Massive and permanent theyâre magnificent
Burning in the eternal night
Now feel them moving creating destroying
And know everything is alive

Stars are burning
Burning pure and bright
Stars are burning
Burning in your eyes
Burning all your life
Burning you alive
