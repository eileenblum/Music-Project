Iâve lost my way I donât know who I am
After all taken there is not much left of me
Iâve seen their face hard just like the stone
And I can be as fast as light but they wonât let me go home

I never sleep I never feel awake
And nothing seems to ease this pain thereâs too much time alone
They can make you feel like you just canât win
There are too many days and thereâs too much time alone to thing

Can you hear me in the endless night alone
Iâm calling
Iâm calling you home

You sense this thing that they canât control
Can liberty be dreaming of your ghost and of your soul
They donât know you they donât know your mind
They try to bind your hands and feet with rope
They make from lies

Can you hear me in the endless night alone
Iâm calling
Iâm calling you home

I fly through space with the weapons of my time
I canât go back and now I donât want to try
I feel a billion souls surround me in this night
I have become their pain I have become their voice

Iâm calling
Iâm calling you home
Can you hear me in the endless night alone
Iâm calling	
Iâm calling you home
Can you hear me	
Iâm calling you home
Can you hear me in the endless night alone
Iâm calling	
Iâm calling you home
