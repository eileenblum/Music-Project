Eagle spirit guide this life for me and all those of my kind
Let me see the harmony of you living here within me
Gone is circle of life now spiral out from me unwind
Be the first and only truth to all those that question you

Sailing on the solar wind with golden wings alight
Sailing on the solar wind the dream has come to life

Squandered on selfish pursuit of all their self-destructive tools
The gift that you so freely gave without judgment without blame
All of the conquistadors have found a time to be reborn
All decrepit and corrupt is theyâre rebirth the death of us

Sailing on the solar wind with golden wings alight
Sailing on the solar wind the dream has come to life

Eagle guide me through this life
Eagle guide me through this night

The dream has come to life
