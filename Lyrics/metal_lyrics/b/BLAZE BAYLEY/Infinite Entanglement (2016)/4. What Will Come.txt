The first day comes and Iâve lost sight of my home
I start to wonder if it is still here
As I sit here with my back to the sun
Waiting for the solar flames to come

Two more days âtil the light speed

The third day comes and I am hoping now
I wonât face all these years alone
I think of her and I start to question
What this mission really means for me

What will come will come
Without my permission or my choosing
You just canât be sure of anything at all
Except uncertainty

Another day âtil light speed

The 5th day comes
Waking from my first deep sleep
Everything seems sharper and more real
I feel it grow soon it will light up my wings
The coronal mass ejection here

What will come will come
Without my permission or my choosing
You just canât be sure of anything at all
Except uncertainty

This is my life, thereâs no waking up all of
This is real
You can take it all
All thatâs left behind is the dust we are
Made from

What will come will come
Without my permission or my choosing
You just canât be sure of anything at all
Except uncertainty
This is my whole life
Thereâs no waking up all of this is real
You can take it all
All thatâs left behind is the dust we are
Made from

What will come will come
And it will come
What will come will come
And it will come

And now I fly at light speed
