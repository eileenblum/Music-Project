The vacuum of space radiation and cold
Should have killed you but you just wonât let go
Determined to live to take back your life,
The darkest truths has been revealed and denied

Fight back, fight back
Itâs time to attack
They thought you were beaten, that they broke you back
They thought it was over that you would lay down
But they were wrong now youâre ready to fight back

A suffering victim that will not resist
Drowning in self-pity, that is what they think
But you wonât accept your circumstance
Now you refuse to be annihilated

Fight back, fight back
Itâs time to attack
They thought you were beaten, that they broke you back
They thought it was over that you would lay down
But they were wrong now youâre ready to fight back
