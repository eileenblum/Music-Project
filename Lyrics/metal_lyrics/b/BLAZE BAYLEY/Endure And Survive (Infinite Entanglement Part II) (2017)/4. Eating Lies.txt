They will soon try to make me become nothing
Torn up into small pieces and torn again 
and it was such a simple deception
that it made me start eating all of their lies

With a casual non-truth I believed in
they convinced me that all of my dreams were lies
Echoes of a past life that they told me
was inspired by the greed of a lonely child

They will try to take my life
I will make them eat their lies

Disgraceful, disgraced and unblemished why
Selective, blacked out memories excuse you 
Every time repeating insults like a child
that will never see the world through adult eyes.

You were looking down on me with motherâs pride
No decency or conscience could trouble you
You'll be choking and then you will see that
I am feeding you all of your darkest lies

They will try to take my life
I will make them eat their lies
A thousand years I have survived
My existence is denied
