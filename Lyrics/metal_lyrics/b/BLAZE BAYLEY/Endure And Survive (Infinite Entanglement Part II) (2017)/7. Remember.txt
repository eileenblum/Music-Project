[Brewer:]
Remember, Remember me, Remember us

Was it all by chance, coincidence, accidents
Or was there something guiding me, guiding us?
Sharing point in space and time,
Our light became so strong
That we were shining
Asteroids and space junk and comets are all
Things alone,
Always moving or falling to earth
Accepting nothing without evidence
Or proof except we knew
We were shining

I feel broken inside
When I canât see the light,
When Iâm torn apart
When my feeling take over again

I remember someone
And a time when things were so simple
And so strong
We just didnât care
Because we were laughing out loud

Protect yourself from a cynical world
You told me just ignore
All the thing I donât have
Learn to be here, right now in this moment with you
And soon we would be shining

Never be afraid to let myself laugh
And to dance, everything is crazy in this world
And in this madness we wonât be alone,
We will find each other
âCause we are shining

I feel broken inside
When I canât see the light,
When Iâm torn apart
When my feeling take over again

I remember someone
And a time when things were so simple
And so strong
We just didnât care
Because we were laughing out loud

I feel broken inside
When I canât see the light,
When Iâm torn apart
When my feeling take over again
I remember someone
