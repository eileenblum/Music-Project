[Brewer:]
Donât let go. Iâm close. Find me.
Hold on, William. Iâm here. Can you hear me.
Iâm close. You are not dead yet.
This is real. This is true. Find the Landauer Limit
And you will find your freedom. And you will find me.
Find me. Donât let go. Donât let go. Donât let go.

Murdered and unremembered
A broken machine of death
Cast out by those who made you
For their own wickedness
In this great universe
Thereâs more than can they know
Or dream of or even understand

Now is the dawn of the dead son,
As the darkness falls you will go on

They put you on your knees
They couldnât make you beg
You chose to fight or die
Never yield to them
So you were burned alive
Then you were left for dead
Out there in the cold space alone

Now is the dawn of the dead son
As the darkness falls you will go on
You face the storm, you face the dark
You face your own oblivion

Now is the dawn of the dead son,
As the darkness falls you will shine on
