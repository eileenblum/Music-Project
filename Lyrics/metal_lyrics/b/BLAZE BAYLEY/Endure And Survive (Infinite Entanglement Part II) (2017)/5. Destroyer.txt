[Pembridge:]
Cleanse the ship with fire.
It must be purified before the planet is reached

I wake up and for a moment I forget
where I am and what I've done and my regrets
and the wretched liarsâ promises they made
Until now I never thought that I would ever see the end

Now comes the destroyer

Now the horrors in my visions all make sense
The dreadful things I've done, the seven saints are dead
My devotion now brings me unjust reward
My execution, my extinction, could this really be the end

Now comes the destroyer
Destroyer of all that lives
Humanity broken
Destruction of all that is

Solar storms and super nova I've survived
Iâve crossed a galaxy and almost lost my mind
And here I am confronted with the vicious truth
until now I thought that they could never win is this end
