You said is what it is
We are where we are
We cannot unsay those words that were spoken
So unselfishly
Donât leave like this, donât leave at all
I wanted to tell you once more
You made me feel I am worth something
You made it easy to believe anything is possible
And together we could move the sun
Together we could move the sun

No thought of the future ahead
We may or may not see
An inch from disaster, pretending it was a mile
Donât leave like this, donât leave at all
I wanted to tell you once more
You made me feel I am worth something
You made it easy to believe anything is possible
And together we could move the sun
Together we could move the sun

You said just be here right now
Itâs all that we can have
No future and no past, let go
Of all your hopes and memories
Let your conscious mind be free
To sense where youâre standing now
Itâs the only way for us
To stay connected through all this

You made me feel I am worth something
You made it easy to believe anything is possible
All of this is real
And together we could move the sun

Looking at you, I see myself now
Someone who can do anything better than before
Ready to believe
That together we could move the sun
Together we could move the sun

Did we live a lie? Did you live it too?
Have I lived the lie? Have you lived it too?
Did we live a lie? Did you live it too?
Was it all a lie?

I said things that I hoped would become true
I said things that I hoped would change our world
All the things that I said that have hurt you
All the thing that I said born of my fear

Constructing my own bitter truth
A self-fulfilling prophecy
All those lies were true
When I whispered them to you
And even with the best intentions,
Looking back, they look like lies

And even with the best intentions.
Looking back, they look like lies
And however much I meant to them,
Looking back, they look like lies
All those lies were true
When I whispered them to you
All those lies were true
When I whispered them to you
All those lies were true

[Pembridge:]
You seem to have become quite close to the subject.
[Brewer:]
You may have that impression because the amount of time 
I have spent with the subject, to prepare him for procedure
[Pembridge:]
You understand what has to happen?
[Brewer:]
Yes, I understand. Itâs a disappointing end. Are you sure itâs necessary?
[Pembridge:]
Let me be clear. He must be eliminated.
Every atom, every particle, every shred of DNA must be gone. 
Before the ship goes into orbit around the new world,
William Black must die
