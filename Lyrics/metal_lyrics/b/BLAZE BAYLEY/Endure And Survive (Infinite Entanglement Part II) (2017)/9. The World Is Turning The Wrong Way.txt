The beauty of the pain of this connection comes again
To remind me I am losing my telepathy
Thought for thought and wordless knowing,
Instantaneous and growing
The deep empathic state that we once shared
The bitter truth Iâm forced to swallow
As Hamletâs phantom to you I must appear

The world is turning wrong way,
I feel this gravity
Pulling you away from me
The world is turning wrong way,
Now through dead eyes I see
Itâs turning you away from me

They will use a blind belief to vindicate obscenity
To justify each misery that you now must endure
Question everything that you see,
Promise they give you so freely
Will all hide a much darker truth within
Now the importance of each moment
Is revealed and itâs my torment
Time will slow down but will never stop for us

The world is turning wrong way,
I feel this gravity
Pulling you away from me
The world is turning wrong way,
Now through dead eyes I see
Itâs turning you away from me

I was eighteen days away
I was eighteen days away
From a moment that was already lost
I just did not know

I was eighteen days away
I was eighteen days away
If I could go back and change one thing
Then I would be there now

You were in my hands
You were in my arms
Arms that were not strong enough to hold on
I didnât understand
The consequences of
The smallest choices
I always believed I would have second chance

The world is turning wrong way,
I feel this gravity
Pulling you away from me
The world is turning wrong way,
Now through dead eyes I see
Itâs turning you away from me
