At twenty five thousand miles an hour youâre lighting up the sky
Hypersonic breakout from your last and future life
Relativistic calculations distance time and speed,
a conscious and ballistic object,
can you reach escape velocity

I will fly my hands become my wings
I will fly and rise upon the wind
I will fly into the great unknown
I will fly and I will find a place I can call home

Like the spear of Odin aiming at that unknown place
A certainty of purpose makes you think you can escape
Escape the ruthless narcissist you know you will become
Traveling faster than your thoughts,
can you reach escape velocity

I will fly my hands become my wings
I will fly and rise upon the wind
I will fly into the great unknown
I will fly and I will find a place I can call home

Leviticus reimagined and rewritten and renamed
Restored to full itsâ potency restored to itsâ full rage
Genetic immunity from the weapons in your hands
Weapons for new ritual sacrifice to cleanse a land

I will fly my hands become my wings
I will fly and rise upon the wind
I will fly into the great unknown
I will fly and I will find a place I can call home

At twenty five thousand miles an hour youâre lighting up the sky
