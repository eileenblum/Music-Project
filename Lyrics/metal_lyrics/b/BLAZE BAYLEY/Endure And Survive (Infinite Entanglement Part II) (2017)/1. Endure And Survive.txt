[Brewer:]
Shall we begin?

Pembridge demands and expects you to let go 
of everything you have lived for
He plans to obliterate any trace of your existence 
make you disappear 
So you are faced with the fight of your life 
Itâs a fight that you canât let them win

By sheer force of will
Get back on your feet
Stand up you're not dead
Endure and survive

Will you die alone on this ship out here in space 
or will you find a way to live
Can you defend yourself against the madness 
you fear will take over your mind
Will you give in to the thoughts of defeat and despair
that try to overwhelm you

By sheer force of will
Get back on your feet
Stand up you're not dead
Endure and survive

[Pembridge:]
The new world is waiting for the chosen ones.
When the under-mission tasks are complete, 
William Black will no longer be required.
He must never touch that new Eden.
In that place my genetically perfect human beings will thrive.
All indigenous threats will be eliminated
and our chosen few will hold dominion over that world. 

By sheer force of will
Get back on your feet
Stand up you're not dead
Endure and survive
