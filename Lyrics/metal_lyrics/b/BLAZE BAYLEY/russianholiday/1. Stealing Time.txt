And now I look for answers, answers I can believe 
I seek the truth and find it, can science answer me? 
I feel there must be something deeper and understanding what it means 
Could now describe unseen connections as time unfolds in front of me 
Sensations now of falling, it's cold is something here? 
I taste the fear around me like a womb I feel the darkness 
Now as I journey from this tomb 
Stealing time, stealing time 
And is it just my intuition that tells me why and how things work 
Existing present past and future connecting all the universe 
If you would only listen they don't want you to know 
About the synchronicity and ways of understanding 
And learn the secrets that they hold 
Stealing time, stealing time 
Sacrifice my whole life searching for the truth 
Turn my back on the world I knew 
Sacrifice my whole life searching for the truth 
Can't go back to the world I knew 
Stealing time, stealing time 
(This will benefit you and in turn will benefit us) 
Inside the shadows of your daydream you make your own discovery 
Moving toward the great enigma time standing still eternally 
And there are consequences as this journey begins 
A non temporal state of ecstasy that now awaits you 
No one can find this path but you 
Stealing time, stealing time 
Sacrifice my whole life searching for the truth 
Turn my back to the world I knew 
Sacrifice my whole life searching for the truth 
Can't go back to the world I knew 
Stealing time, stealing time
