After every late night, there is an early start
Some of the roads aren't roads
And all the seats are hard
Sixteen men are boys, we laugh about these things
I don't want to understand my Russian holiday

Saint Petersburg is overnight and we sleep on the train
And I am Harry Palmer from a film with Michael Caine
Tinker tailor soldier spy and someone disappeared
And now he's back again on my Russian holiday

Another crazy show, and there's no JD on the stage
Today they watched and waited
Outside in the freezing rain
Have you got a line I heard an old man say
No we don't have that here, on my Russian holiday

Who can tell me now, will I ever see home again
I would give my life if I could see your face now
Who can tell me now, will I ever see home again
I would give my life if I could see your face now
If I could see your face

I'm feeling so down, but I don't get worse
So that is a good thing in the Russian world
They go by their hearts, and not on their feet
They are as tough as anyone can be
On my Russian holiday

Who can tell me now, will I ever see home again
I would give my life if I could see your face now
Who can tell me now, will I ever see home again
I would give my life if I could see your face now
If I could see your face
