It's madness to continue thats what they're telling you
because they want it easy this thing that they can't do
That don't mean you can't do it coz it's too tough for them
It's difficult not easy beginning at the end
You have your doubts your fears you don't know what to do
The only thing that's easy is to feel confused
in all of this confusion try to find your own voice
It's somewhere deep within you saying you have a choice
It's time to let yourself believe
This life is yours
I lost my way I admit that
I thought the path was clear but now I see it was clearly the wrong path for me
I could not face or see the truth
so I planned the end of the end
No one can blame you if you've had those same thoughts too
Just give me this song to say
I've found reason a way to want to live again
As arrogant as it sounds you know me and I have to say
If life changed for me then life might change for you
When you don't feel any closer to where you want to be
I know that it is difficult if you believe
this life is your life for you to live and make your own
It's time to let yourself believe this life is yours
