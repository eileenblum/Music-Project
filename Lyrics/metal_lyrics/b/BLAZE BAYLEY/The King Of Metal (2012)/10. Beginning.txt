This is the beginning
Don't wake up, just listen
Be here in this moment with me
This is the beginning you seek
This is moment we spoke of
The moment where you would begin

Why have you been smothered and suffocated by black emotions of this nightmare sea
Sea of doubt storm of self-pity
The darkness makes you think you're blind

Thinking that you're blind, you can't see the truth
That you'e not blind only smothered and lost
You can't walk you can't speak
This situation is not without choice, you can choose to know this
Darkness can't hold you
Darkness can't kill you, if you don't allow this darkness to exist
