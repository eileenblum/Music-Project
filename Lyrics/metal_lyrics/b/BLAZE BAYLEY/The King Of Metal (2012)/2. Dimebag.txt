I feel a diamond shine
Somewhere in my mind
When I hear the sound shine

The 8th of December in 2004
The wicked tragedy and horror that would shock us all

The was a diamond shining
Shining so bright out there
A bright and shining star of Texas shining everywhere

Silent insane and evil
Thoughts stolen from his mind
He has come to destroy Dimebag
Where he plays and shines

The Alrosa villa Columbus Ohio
Damageplan are rocking out doing their metal show

Up to the stage he's walking
The gun is in his hand
He starts shooting and won't stop until he's taken down
From behind the madman
A single shot gun blast
Ends the madness but the horror of that night still lasts 

Dimebag is shot four time
And three more lost their lives
And seven wounded by the evil
In that twisted mind

Fifteen shots are fired
Thirty five to go
The courage and the carnage
Of that night in Ohio

We are broken now
We are broken down

Though you died
You will always be alive here in me
Though you died

I feel a diamond shine
Somewhere in my mind
When I hear the sound shine
