I don't believe in a fate
that I can't escape
I know my future is what
I work to create
you think that you can't change a thing in your life
is that what they made you think is true
you let them decide how and when you will die
and that's what will become true for you

Twist your fate

I will give everything now
and I will not wait
I will not make an excuse
to avoid the pain
your will and your courage are all that you need
to start living the life that you want
How much do you want it, how much do you need it,
how important is it to you

Twist your fate
