They
Trample the weak
Run from the strong
Smile as they laugh at my song

Sociopathic thieves no sentiment or conscience
It isn't personal it's business with a vengeance
Describing my life as inferior a tax loss
And they are stealing everything you try to give me

But
You are the King

They
Have no respect
Condescending
Bastards that don't know a thing

They want me looking like a model that's a smack head
Not really caring O.D. vomit or shotgun
It's a fact that sales always increase after death
For parasitical self righteous business rodents

But
You are the King
Of Metal
