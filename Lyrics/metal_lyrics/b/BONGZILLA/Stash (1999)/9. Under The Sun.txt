[Black Sabbath cover]

I don't want no Jesus freak to tell me what it's about
No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door now and my mind has been released

I don't want no preacher telling me about the God in the sky
I don't want no one to tell me where I'll go when I die
I live my life, I don't want people telling me what to do
I believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People drive to ruination
I can see through their frustration

People hiding their real faces
Each one running their rat race
Behind each flower, there grows a weed
In their world of make-believe

Believe what I tell you, it's the only way you'll find in the end
Believe in yourself and you shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people interfere with your mind
Live your life, leave them all far behind
