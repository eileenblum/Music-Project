Plant a seed, watch it grow
We're going to reap what we sow
Yeah, the Earth she does know
She lets us grow what we grow
Yeah, the days they are long
Make you grow up to be strong
Yeah, my woman she will bloom
All the buds we'll take soon

90 days, 90 nights, we'll wait for the light
It will change to the twelve, then to ten it will go
When it hits the ten, we are near heaven
And the time it is ripe, to take all her life

Cut, cut down
Hung, hung upside down
Cure, cure her
Then, then the wait
Cure, cure us
Then, then the smoke
