There he sits behind the bars they put him in
Waiting for the day it all begins
When he can take another hit again
It's his right by birth of the Mother Earth
She grew you, me and the weed
Now it's time to take up arms and fight

There he sits behind the bars they put him in
Waiting for the day it all begins
When he can take another hit again
It's his right by birth of the Mother Earth
She grew you, me and the weed
Now it's time to take up arms and fight

Prisoner of war
