Yeah, the sun it rises in the east everyday
You can see it's the same, then you'll see it my way
Yeah, the sun it sets in the west where it grows
Yeah, the best I heard, dreadlock man he say so

There they sit at the foot of the mountain
Taking hits of the sacred smoke
Fire rips at their lungs
Holy mountain take us away
