Look at what we've done to our world
Rape and pillage her like criminals
We must change the wave of destruction
Or lose the glory of evolution

Salvation grows before your outstretched hands
We must return them to our land
And it will become Holy again

Reunite the Mother, Daughter and Sun
This trinity will make us at One
Free our minds to see the holy path
And the Earth she forever last
