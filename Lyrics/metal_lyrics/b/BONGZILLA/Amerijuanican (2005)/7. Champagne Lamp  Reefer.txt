[Muddy Waters cover]

Bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
And reefer when I wanna get high

Bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
And reefer when I wanna get high

When I'm lonely
Bring my woman
And set her right down here by my side

Well you know there shouldn't be a law
For people who wanna smoke a little dope
You know there shouldn't be a law
For people who wanna smoke a little dope

It's good for your head
And it relax your body, don't you know

Well you know I'm gonna get so high
The next morning it's gonna be a crying shame (?)

Well I'm gonna get high
I'm gonna get high just as sure as my name

Bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
And reefer when I wanna get high

Bring me champagne when I'm thirsty
And reefer when I wanna get high

Well I'm gonna get high
I'm gonna get high just as sure as my name
