Yeah, there we all sit, waiting for the hash
Risin' in the glass
Put the chunk right on the pin
Light the fucker up, do it again
Yeah, we can reach the stars
I wanna see how high we can fly
Now I'm lying on the floor
Wanna touch the sky, give me some more

Now it's time to see what you are made of
Let's take it farther
It's time to reach the heavens
Body buzzin', let's do it again

The ancient lesson will be taught to you
The choko was brought to us from above
To use as we will, to find our God
We must fly to heaven, to see him for us
