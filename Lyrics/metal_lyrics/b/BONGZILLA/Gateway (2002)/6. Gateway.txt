There I sit at the gateway
Wondering how far she might take me
I don't know if what they say
Is it true, I'm gonna live that way
I just need to find my way
Back on home, coming back today
Here I am, back in the zone
The zone of life, always stoned

Now I'm back at the gateway
Wondering if I'm here to stay
I've got scars that used to be veins
It's gone down, I'm insane
I can't seem to get my mind
Screwed on tight, I've got a life to find
Here I am, back in a haze
Blazing through life, always stoned
