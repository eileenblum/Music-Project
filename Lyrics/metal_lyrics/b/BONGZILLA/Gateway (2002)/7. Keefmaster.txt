Here we sit
In the circle of death
The five-pointed leaf
Drops the powder of life

Two are left
The keef has spoken
The pain is gone
The power of the powder toker

Rocky Mountain, Rocky Mountain, Rocky Mountain
Take me high
Rocky Mountain, Rocky Mountain, Rocky Mountain
Take me to the sky

Rocky Mountain, Rocky Mountain, Rocky Mountain
Take me high
Rocky Mountain, Rocky Mountain, Rocky Mountain
Take me to the sky
