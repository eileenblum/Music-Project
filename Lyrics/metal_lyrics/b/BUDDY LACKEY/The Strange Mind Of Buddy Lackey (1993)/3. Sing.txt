I don't want to sing 'bout the revolution
don't want to sing about
the acid rain that falls down on me
I would never sing about a girl
who threw me away
I just want to sing
fill my soul with this music
sing about nothing
and this would be my favorite song

I don't want to sing 'bout opression
don't want to sing about any hopeless situation
I don't want to sing 'bout the love of Jesus Christ
I just want to sing
fill my soul with this music
sing about nothing
and this would be my favorite song

they're a million light years gone
they say the thing that will be, will be
light years . . .

I don't want to sing 'bout religion
don't want to sing about the political situtation
don't even want to sing 'bout America the corporation
I just want to sing
fill my soul with this music
sing about nothing
and this would be my favorite song
