I ain't looking to put you down
I have no reason to try
it's just the strange way that the world is turning 'round
as if I need a reason why
five years in the underground
shaping sound

it's just a question of ten or two
it's just a matter of time
more and more with life it comes through knowing you
it's just another trip of mine
five years in the underground
counting down

five years in the underground
longer now
my soul is lifted above ground
I think I'm learning to fly
so why's it feel as if you try to hold me down
when all my life that's kept me trying
five years in the underground
shaping sound
five years in the underground
counting down

I know what this means to you
but am I part of your dream
'cause wheels are turning and I've got to see it through
though I ain't expecting nothing
five years in the underground
shaping sound
five years in the underground
counting down
five years in the underground
longer now
over now?
