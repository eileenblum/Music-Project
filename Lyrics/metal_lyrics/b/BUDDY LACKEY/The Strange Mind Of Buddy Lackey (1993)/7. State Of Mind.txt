these days are crazed
I've been amazed the way he lays the maze
I care, I swear
I'm well aware that don't make it fair
on and on my life drifts by
I still ain't shit, but I got the guts to try
this time it's mine
I'm livin' in pain but I'm feelin' fine
it's just a state of mind
it's just a state of mind
it's just a state of mind

I've tried to find
or hide behind just a little peace of mind
to live to wait
the more that I live man the less I trust fate
just stay awake I learn to overcome what you take
this face is fact
love is to give and not want to get back
what you must do
is hear the point that I'm trying to get through
to you the few
whose song is a prayer you don't care if it's true
that's fine this time
but the message of mine is often covered behind the rhyme
combined with the time
and the tempo of words that only fit the line
it's all a state of mind
it's all a state of mind
it's all a state of mind

don't lay down if you don't love the ground
don't get high if you don't love the sky
turn it down if you don't love the sound
you don't love nothing and you don't know why
can't break from the underground
can't break from the underground
can't break from the underground
can't break from the underground
it's all a state of mind
it's all a state of mind
it's all a state of mind
it's all a state of mind

this life is now
if you fall and you can't fly
you'd better learn how
put your sweat into the plow
if you give it a try then you get to live from the ground
you know it's acid
the age old psalm about reaping what you sow
it goes to show
if you want to rock then you better learn to roll
it's all a state of mind
it's all a state of mind
it's all a state of mind
it's just a state of mind
it's just a state of mind
it's just a state of mind
it's just a state of mind
it's just a state of mind
