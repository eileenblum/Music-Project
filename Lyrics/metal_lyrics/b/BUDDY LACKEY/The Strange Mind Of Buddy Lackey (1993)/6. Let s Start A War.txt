stimulation slowing down
the corporations underground
own the bloody world but they want more
the televsion picture man smiles and say "I have a plan come on everyone
let's start a war!"

this idea is nothing new
it really just is something to amuse
I hope that you don't mind to die
simply just to passify my views

imagine all the people dead
all the missiles streaming overhead
people running screaming through the fire
all the soldiers lying down 
muddy faces to the ground
bleeding from the twisted razor wire
school boys fighting through the trees
while the women run the factories
a machine gun is a fair trade for a dream
they taught us well to stand in line
they don't let no one fall behind
to fall into the turning war machine

this idea is nothing new
it really just is something to amuse
it's always been a rich man's game
it's no suprise, they'll ask the same of you
well the rich exchange a pat on the back
while the high school kids are sent to attack
and they know damn well they'll never come back again

well the rich exchange a pat on the back
while the high school kids are sent to attack
and they know damn well they'll never come back again
mountains made of human skulls
the bodies buried in their holes
the product of a genocidal mind
blackened sky with burning red
all the kids have guns held to their heads
the prisoners of war are left behind

this idea is nothing new
it's really just been something to amuse
I hope that you don't mind to die
or simply just to lose an eye or two
well the rich exchange a pat on the back
while the high school kids are sent to attack
and they know damn well they'll never come back again
and if you do well don't be surprised
when you find out they've been telling you lies
and the freedom that you fought for
cost you your mind or more, they don't care
the blood revelations turn
the dying watch their cities burn
the government can murder who they choose
the democrats are acting sad
republicans are truly glad
to set their mercenaries on the loose
this idea is nothing new
it's really just been something to amuse
there's really nothing you can do
to keep them digging all their gold from you

well the rich exchange a pat on the back
while the high school kids are sent to attack
and they know damn well they'll never come back again
and if you do well don't be surprised
when you find out they've been telling you lies
and the freedom that you fought for
cost you your mind
you never get back the life that they robbed
while you're out on the streets, they are high on the hog
you're a psycho veteran you can't get a job no more

now the paper sack that carried your wine
is a makeshift homeless veteran sign
you're a freakshow on display and you're out of your mind

stimulation slowing down
the corporations underground
own the bloody world but they want more
the televsion picture man smiles and say "I have a plan come on everyone
let's start a war!"

it was entirely too silly, and so I shall stop it
I only hope that we can put this all behind us now, and just get on with
the rest of the album
. . . in fact, maybe it's just bestif you never play that song anyway . .
