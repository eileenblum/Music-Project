would you believe what's going down inside my brain
I don't believe you'd understand
pay no mind to the ghetto man

I know the world is cold
well that ain't nothin' strange
but the way you push me down
well it's gettin' old
and I know it's never gonna change
now I'm gonna start pushing back
maybe that'll make you understand
you can't push down on a ghetto man

I think you'd finally understand
once you had to be the ghetto man
it's a ghetto man

well I've got more love than money
and I got more hope than fame
I'l like to buy the world from under you someday
and leave you sleeping in the rain
and eating from the drain

maybe that will make you understand
once you had to be the ghetto man
it's a ghetto man
