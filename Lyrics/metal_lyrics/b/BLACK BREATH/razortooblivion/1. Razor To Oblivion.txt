No reason is coming to stop entropic decay hope of tomorrow hope, you carry in vain carry in vain... Embrace the darkness nestling under your skin entropic desires seek oblivion seek oblivion... Nothing surrounds us emptied of care shell without feeling you stare... Hope... You carry in... Carry in vain
