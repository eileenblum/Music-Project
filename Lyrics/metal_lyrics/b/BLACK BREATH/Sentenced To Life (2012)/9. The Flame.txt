Falling down into this pit of hate
You will never make it out
From this hell
From this hell
Each day trapped into your life
Will keep you spending an
Eternity in hell
Eternity in hell

In hell...
Nothing burns
Except innocence and
The flame

Be crushed forever
By what you hold onto from inside
This world of pain
This world of pain

Shame is not the only thing
That will make you keep
Crawling through this pain
Crawling through this pain

This pain...
Nothing burns
Except innocence and
The flame

Nothing
Burns in hell
Nothing
Burns in hell
Nothing
Burns in hell
