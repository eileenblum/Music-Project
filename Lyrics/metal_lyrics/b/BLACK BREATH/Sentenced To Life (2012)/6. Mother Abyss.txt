On their knees before the cross
They shame the son of god
Rub the blood upon their breasts
Swallow the bleeding one
Curse the god that let him die
Eternal blasphemy
Drawing close the two he loves
Pleasure eternally

Mother abyss
Blackened son
Babylon is calling
The beast has come

We shall bring forth hell

Climbing down from on the cross
With fire in his eyes
Eat the thorns upon his head
The serpent does not lie
Roasting flesh upon the spear
Offering sacrifice
Drawing close the two he loves
Nothing will be denied

Mother abyss
Blackened son
Babylon is calling
The beast has come

We shall bring forth hell
We shall bring forth
We shall bring forth
We shall bring forth hell
