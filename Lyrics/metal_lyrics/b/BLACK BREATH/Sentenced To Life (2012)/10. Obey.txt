The night stalker howls
The slave fellates the beast
Drowning in the tears of the weak
Only the strong will touch upon
Darkness

Die...

Seduction
The master's unbound wound
Stroking at the root
Feed the whole where
Darkness grows inside

Serpent's milk, a supple thorn
Feed the darkness as it's born

Kneeling at
The bastard's feet
Screaming at
Your master's feet, obey
Kneeling at
The bastard's feet
Screaming at
Your master's feet

Drinking from the beast
Of the one who crawls
Bless the nameless one who came
Shadows, resurrected

Serpent's milk, a supple thorn
Feed the darkness as it's born

Kneeling at
The bastard's feet
Screaming at
Your master's feet, obey
Kneeling at
The bastard's feet
Screaming at
Your master's feet, obey me

There can be no salvation
When there is only the end
No, there will be nothing
Nothing but
The end
