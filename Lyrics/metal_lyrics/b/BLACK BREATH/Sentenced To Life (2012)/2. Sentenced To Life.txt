The specter is calling
To take off your robe
The cloth of your flesh
Let darkness caress
The head of your soul
Is no little death

Sentenced
Sentenced to life
Terrified of living
Too scared to die

No time ignoring
The pull of your bones
Your life is swollen
Release the urgings
Empty your blood
Come into death

Sentenced
Sentenced to life
Terrified of living
Too scared to die
Die...die...die...die...

Sentenced
Sentenced to life
Terrified of living
Too scared to die

You're terrified of living
It's time to fucking die
