Lay your bed made of skin
Under darkness
Feel the light from the stars
Penetrating
Calling out to the one
Best forgotten
Repeat the words taught to you
The beast is waking...

You will never get enough
Of my flesh
You will never get enough
Of my flesh

Shadows form out a space
Dreams occulting
Growing wet as you watch
It descending
Receive the touch, accept the beast
Corruption building
Feel the snake around your throat
One becoming...

You will never get enough
Of my flesh
You will never get enough
Of my flesh
You will never get enough, and
You will never get enough
Of my flesh
