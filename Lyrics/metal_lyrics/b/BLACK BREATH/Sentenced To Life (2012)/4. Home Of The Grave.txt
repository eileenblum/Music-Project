Everything is gone
Taken all away
Life is a prison
Where death is the key
No eyes gaze
Sons of darkness
Bring upon death
When everything is gone
We are endless

Beneath the earth
In the land of the dead
And the home of the grave

Blood has run dry
From the open vein
Life is a prison
Where death is the key
Nothing remains
Reality is scarred
Driven insane
Everything is gone
Taken away

Beneath the earth
In the land of the dead
And the home of the grave
Home of the grave

Home of...grave
