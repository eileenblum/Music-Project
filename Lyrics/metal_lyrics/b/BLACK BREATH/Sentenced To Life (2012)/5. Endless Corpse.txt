Lay back with eve
And ride the flame
Holding close the gift
The serpent gave

Crawling up from
The pits of hell
The laws have been broken
Now drink your fill

A corpse is all you'll ever be
Taketh what belongs to thee

Writhing in disfigured reality
Growing fat on the fruit
From the tree
Cast out but still
The seeds remain
Holding close the gift
The serpent gave

Crawling up from
The pits of hell
The laws have been broken
Now drink your fill

A corpse is all you'll ever be
Taketh what belongs to thee

Never trust
The things you see
Nothing is ever
As it seems
