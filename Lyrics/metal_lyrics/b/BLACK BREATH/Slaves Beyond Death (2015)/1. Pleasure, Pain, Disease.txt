A terror unleashed
That you have never seen
Reveals the flesh beneath
To bleed you forever
Is my only dream
As I slowly peel off your skin

Screaming
Screaming
Unwrapping skin
Screaming
Blood
Blood
Blood

Omen of wrath
Waiting to be unleashed
I can taste your fear
As I put on your skin
I wear it for you to see
Wear it for you to see

Screaming
Screaming
Unwrapping skin
Screaming
Blood
Blood
Blood

Violence
Pain
Pleasure
Disease

I will always hear your screams
Pleasure. Pain. Disease
