Memories of fire drifting alone
Feed desires no one knows
Soaked in urine dripping wet
Starved, beaten, shamed and whipped

Given only cruelty and pain
Upset pools of forbidden memories
Now the blood is flowing red
As I travel down these empty roads
Down these empty roads

Lost in realms of madness
Blood running down my skin
Standing on the edge of death
Death...

Door opens in my mind
Endless fields of forgotten torment
This pain I will share with you
As your screams echo across the night

Lost in realms of madness
Blood running down my skin
Standing on the edge of death

Gazing into the abyss

Only a taste of what waits
In the world that is coming
A place of insane cruelty

Leaving only madness
And rotting bones
Crippled lives
And the fear
That I will return
I will return
I will return
I will return...
