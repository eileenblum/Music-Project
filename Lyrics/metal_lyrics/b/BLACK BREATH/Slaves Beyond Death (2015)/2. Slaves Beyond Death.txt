I drag your soul
Into this world of darkness

Death has no end, only a different way
Without answer, without frame
Delivered into chains of everlasting darkness
Forever branded with my seed
It is you I will hold
Blood pounding against your skin
On your knees, you wait to die
Never to be free

I know now what I have awaken
In this cruel and forgotten place
A being of complete darkness
Is what I create
Unlock and dissolve time
And graze upon the weak
Where I own your soul
And you suffer eternally

I drag your soul
Into this world of darkness

Never to be free

Stretched out forever
Torturing hell
Screaming forever
Locked into place
You can not escape
My prison of death
Screaming forever

Never to be free
Kill

I drag your soul
Into this world of darkness
