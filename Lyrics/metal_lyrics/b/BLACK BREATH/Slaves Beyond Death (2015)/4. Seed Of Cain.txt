Cursed blood inside of me
Ancient voices deafening
Lost in these visions of death
Dark world is blurring
A bleeding rock is dripping
Trapped in the shadows of hell

Specter always pushing
Voices always urging
Withered blood is boiled
I am the one possessed
Black robes flowing
Severed hand anointing
Time has come
Harbringer of death

I am the seed of Cain
The end of all life
I am the seed of Cain
Death is no mistake

A creature of darkness
Trapped in this world of
Eternal human misery
With these hands I will end
All of the life that I see
Growing here before me
For I am the seed of Cain

I am the seed of Cain
The end of all life
I am the seed of Cain

Unhuman desire from beyond time
Helpless victims of a tormented mind
Animal trapped in human skin
Taking and feeding again and again

Seed of Cain
