I catch your scent on the cold night wind
Red eyes glow, a festering hunger
The sin of your flesh is a stench so thick
A bleeding wound that I must lick

With dead eyes staring
Into the endless night
With dead eyes staring
Swallowing every light

Against the dark your skin so wet
Starving, thirsting for this wine
Sharpened teeth on withered breast
As I drink from the milk of death

With dead eyes staring
Into the endless night
With dead eyes staring
Swallowing every light
Into endless night
Swallowing every
...Light

Ripped from the altar
Of this cruel life
To feed undying

Ride along
My arc of violence
A driven search
To penetrate

The mysteries of death

Of death beyond

To cast a soul

That is not my own
