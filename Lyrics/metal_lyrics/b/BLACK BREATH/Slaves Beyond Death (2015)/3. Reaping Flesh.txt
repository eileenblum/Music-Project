Cut open screaming
The price of your trust
My lust flowing
At the edge of your pain
Slowly begging for death
As you bleed
Begging for death

I live in the shadows
Beyond the safety of light
Every time you close your eyes
I am lurking

Reaping flesh
Reaping flesh

Repeating the words that I read
In the blood on your skin
My knife is the pen that writes
With the ink of your flesh
A bible of pain where I am the lord
And I am death
Carved into memory

I live in the shadows
Beyond the safety of light
Every time you close your eyes
I am lurking

Reaping flesh
Reaping flesh

Devouring madness, yet I hunger
For the spirit to burn the flesh must suffer
An insane desire to eat of your life
All that I am is fire and night

Reaping flesh
Reaping flesh
