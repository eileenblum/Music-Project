Morbid dreams I can't forget
I walk in circles dripping sweat
Lost in hatelost in hate
Thirsting raving parasite
Growing hidden from worlds of light
With this burning hate
Burning hate
Burning hate

Blood demands I cleanse this world
From my womb that death is born

The knife has fallen once again
A killing that I can never end
Will never end, it will not end
Burning hate clothed in flesh
Staring for hours into
Rays of death
Rays of death
Into rays of death
Rays of death
Staring for hour into
Rays of death

Blood demands I cleanse this world
From my womb that death is born

In this war against all flesh
A temple of death
The chosen one to rule this world
Burning hate
Burning hate
Burning hate
Lost in burning hate

Drinking screams from tortured flesh
Satisfying every lust
When there's nothing left to take
Rotting flesh I will taste
