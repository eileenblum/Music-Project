the elders have fallen 
crippled by time
a black dawn is rising
I said hey
ripped out of heaven
cast into the slime
spinning forever
ancient of mind
consume the past

blackness
children of the horn

wounds will not heal
when covered in dirt
eat from the grave
eternally hate
cannot be forgiven

hope is a lie
forget what you know
grow wild inside
consume the past

blackness
children of the horn
