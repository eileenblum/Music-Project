The scent of hell is on her lips 
The taste on your tongue you never forget 
Lift up her robes 
Snake covered thighs 
Finger the darkness 
The witch's cry 

Inside of her the devil has lived 
There is no choice to eat again 
Come eat the witch 

Growing drunk on devil's blood 
The wine on her lips is the blood of the son 
Once you've eaten 
Cannot be forgiven 
Down on your knees 
She commands your attention 

Inside of her the devil has lived 
There is no choice to eat again 
Come eat the witch
