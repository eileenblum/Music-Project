Take not a word
for what it is told
structure of lies
implanted inside
the words you speak
are your demise
virus etched
onto your mind
parasite
that makes you real
the world is viral

trapped inside of hidden codes
corrupts the way
you see the world
corruptor
you can only comtemplate
the scars your tongue lets you taste
the world is viral

virus

you cannot understand
something for which words
do not exist, no
the world is viral

virus

cut the tongue from your mouth
before you can spread the disease
every mouth that speaks the word
burn it until it is clean
