Nothing is left 
Only the mask of the goat 
Releasing death 
Imprisoned inside of the host 

Death lust 
Darkest of sin 
Black sin

Rapture in blood 
Symbols on the breast 
Chanting the name 
Of the one who has no breath 

Death lust 
Darkest of sin 
Black sin 

Come take this knife and slip it in the breast of the babe Drink the blood from the cup 
Reject christ, spit on the cross 

Black sin
