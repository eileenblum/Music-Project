A darness is growing
on the blood
obscenely birthed
from space and time
conceiving void
from the empty skies
reverse the birth canal
strenght of her will
it never breathes
ovarian plague
to enter in is to enter void
the kiss is alien, the touch forbidden
dare  you enter?

unholy virgin
dare you enter?

obscenely birthed
from space and time
conceiving void
from the empty skies
the kiss is alien, the touch forbidden
dare  you enter?

unholy virgin
dare you enter?

the womb is the stars that cradles all breath
wait to possess you on an unholy ride
inside of time there is no rest
embrace the sinner for one last kiss

unholy virgin
dare you enter?
