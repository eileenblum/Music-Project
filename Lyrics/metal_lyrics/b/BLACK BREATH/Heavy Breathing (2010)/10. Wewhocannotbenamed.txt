We have no name
control the cycle
of birth and death
devoid of conscience
remove the bonds
stopping at nothing
the star is rising
it's morning again

nameless one

rotting taste of flesh
heed no one's word
drink the saliva
rotting taste of flesh
heed no one's word
drink the saliva
follow the way

control the cycle
of birth and death
devoid of conscience
remove the bonds
stopping at nothing
the star is rising
it's morning again

nameless one

follow the way
