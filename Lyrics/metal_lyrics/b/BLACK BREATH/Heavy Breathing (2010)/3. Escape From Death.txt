Breath is black 
Eyes are red 
I'm so used to being dead 
Beyond the grave is outta control 
Eating children 
Feeding the soul 
Hear me screaming in the night 
Mistake of nature banned from light 
Lurking shadows 
Open door completely evil 
Skin grows cold... 

Escape from death 
Taste it father 
Lick my flesh 

Bulging eyes 
Rotting teeth
Of human life, I'm a theif 
Fucking crazy 
Beyond the grave 
Kneel before the altar 
Kiss of shame 
Hear me screaming in the night 
Mistake of nature banned from light 
Lurking shadows 
Open door completely evil 
Skin grows cold... 

Escape from death 
Taste it father 
Lick my flesh 

There's a path from the grave 
Twisted ladder, awesome fate 
Seek the lurker at the door 
Feeding nightly on human souls 
Take their flesh for yourself 
They won't need it, never will 

No... 

Escape from death 
Taste it father 
Lick my flesh
