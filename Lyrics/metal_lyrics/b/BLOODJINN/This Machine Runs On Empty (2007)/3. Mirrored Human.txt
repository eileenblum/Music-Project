Coped with this, for far to long now
Nothing, could ever replace those times
The memories of, my love, for you
Changed my life
Took the full turn only to
Be taken away I am somber
A void that will never be filled
A heartbeat that is never forgotten
The memories of, my love, for you
I have, lost my, entire, world!
Look down on me now
Down on me now
The memories of you
I have, lost my, entire, world!
Coped with this, for far to long now
Nothing, could ever replace those times
Looking down on me now
With only these words to say
I will be home some day.
