[spoken words:]
Living life so filled with hate, this cannot be forgiven.
It will take a million days, a million days without this shame.

I have told you one hundred times
And before I could speak those words
You interrupted me with all the lies
That you hold so dear to you
Was it worth every minute?
It's all that I am.
Was it worth every minute?
To take a stand and lie to me
I will never forgive you for everything
It will take a million days
A million days without, this, life, of, shame
Don't tell me I am wrong
I'm living proof I am right
I am, I am right
This is your proof
Your proof
Living life with so much hate
This cannot be forgiven
It will take a million days
A million days without, this, shame
(It's all that I am)
Don't tell me I am wrong
I'm living proof I am right
I am, I am right
A million days
You live with shame
I told you to prove me wrong
