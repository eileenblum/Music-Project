This shining star
Wakens me tonight
With a lonely kiss
Chipping away at this dark wall
Solitude and demise
Glory beyond this I confess
She started this dying heart
Clutched inside of her hand
A moment of clarity
This moment of sin
Our moment of hope
For this to never end
I lay upon her feet
Staring back at the sun
Waiting for the answer
Buried inside of this lust
A moment of clarity
This moment of sin
Our moment of hope
For this to never end
Inside the screams
A tortured melody
Pillows cover my face
Only to weather the storm
Without a warning of
Every wishful day
A moment of clarity
This moment of sin
Our moment of hope
For this to never end
Trust in me now
More than you ever have
I lay upon her feet
Staring back at the sun
Waiting for the answer
Buried inside of this lust
A moment of clarity in ourselves
It's our moment in clarity
