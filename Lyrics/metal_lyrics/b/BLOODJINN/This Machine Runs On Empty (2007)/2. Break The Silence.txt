Storming with sound, shut off my senses
It hurts when you cry, my bones rot waiting for you
Tired, eyes inside
This loneliness, regrets
The absence of you, suffers
This is my all
If I could only reach you
Past this universe, past this eclipse
of silence, between us (between us)
I'd prove you're worth, a minute, a lifetime
Tired, eyes inside
This loneliness, regrets
The absence of you, suffers
This is my all
Break the silence
Break the silence
Go!
Tired, eyes inside
This loneliness, regrets
The absence of you, suffers
This is my all
I will prove that you are
Worth a minute
A lifetime
Fucking go!
