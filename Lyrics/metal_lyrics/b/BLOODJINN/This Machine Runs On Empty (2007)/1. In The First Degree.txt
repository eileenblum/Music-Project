Somethings are better off to die
Nothing is left unsaid
Sewn up the eyes to stop the cries
Withered away just to sever the ties
How could you adore this pain in me
Coming for you, wanting to kill
In the eyes of a murderer
Coming for you, wanting to kill
Everything that you are.
Mistakes made then, no no never again
You are a tragedy
Coming for you, wanting to kill
Everything that you are
Everything you are
Wanted to kill
This beast in a bottle
Consumes my trust
Empty pools of blood
Where I breathe the words, kill
The beast in a bottle
See the grey only to be brave
Recarnation
