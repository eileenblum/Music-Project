this will take some time away from me, and my life. i will not allow it to 
fold in front of me. to curse the hands of time, and become the enemy. i 
often wonder if they stare at me, but without you, theyll never see. i 
wanted to do this for a long time, although my strength would never last. i 
wished for hope and despair. every step i make seems like another set of 
eyes looking at me. another set of eyes looking at me. forgive, from the 
shadows of your lies, you can give, but your desperate...desperate...whats 
the reason? of the sweat from the heat of my mind. with bad thoughts of 
ending their time as long as i wait, and let them set a killing way upon 
that. being part of a lie, i will kill if im betrayed...all desperate of 
whats become. trust in me, this time. my heart is falling for love, standing 
behind you. run, so far away that we can get away, away from the weak. this 
way we're clear from the pain, not forgetting the tries. not forgetting the 
tries, pondering the weak. between what i have seen, is this a dream? i cant 
believe, i cant believe this is the way of what i have seen. and still you 
lie, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and 
again, and again. all i hate. i disintegrate. words terminate what you 
become. controlled what i gave. farewell. what i gave, suffered of the 
change. what ive seen. i cant believe, is this a dream of what ive seen?
