blood filled with heartache. the anger pours from my mind. when well the 
grass die again? her beauty destroyed by our selfish greed. theres no cure 
for the virus. shes bittersweet. she gave her life. all her beauty is 
forgotten. bring down the rain. the unforginven punishment. for what they 
have done. she cries, no end in sight. shes dying for a lost cause. her love 
destroyed. selfish pride has abandoned what is truly right. in life, in her 
words, shes gone. all her beauty is forgotten. shes dying for a lost cause. 
her lover destroyed. selfish pride has abandoned what is truly right. shes 
dying for a lost cause. you never loved her. shes dying for a lost cause. my 
mind is made.
