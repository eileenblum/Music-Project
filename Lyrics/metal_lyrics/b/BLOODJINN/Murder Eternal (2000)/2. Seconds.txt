this time you wont forgive. somethings coming out of your eyes. dwelling on 
the fear that i hide, as i turn away, punished. somethings coming out of 
your eyes, its all lies. your love and hate, you killed the best of whats 
whats in me. im thinking of a way, to end all the pain. a fraction of what 
will be coming. a light descends on what will be coming. you honor the lies 
that which you speak, but its not for long. in other words, breaking all 
ties. to cut to death. to cut to death. to cut, to bleed and die before me. 
the seconds fall from the sky. it is coming, its your time to die. and i see 
in my mind youll sell your soul, then youll die. when the fallen become the 
past, i lie awake, thinking of you. i wished we could be, like it used to 
be. just me and you. youre punished.
