i fell away, when was i wrong? with no help, do i belong? and the tears fall 
down may face. with no help, im disgraced. as laughter proceeds within and 
between. is it suicide? or a dream? its all just so hard to believe. i wont 
follow at the sorrow, empty and hollow. whats becoming a bliss. close 
encounters, darkness traps me. opening up the floor of life. you thoughts 
hide, your pain cries, your heart lies. trying to justify whats inside your 
life. and i never thought it would end like this. upon the stars that gaze 
each kiss. will i ever see you again in time before it ends? the times 
turning all towards ending. would it pierce, my thoughts of you? realize 
that theres silence in a world which i live. and i will not become. my fate 
all is forgotten. live, love and regret.
