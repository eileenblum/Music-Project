Nothing can prepare you for this, fall in line for the greatest cause, watch 
the time fade away, months turn into minutes, years turn into seconds , 
standing in line, card in your hand, so that everyone will have comfort, no 
more free will, home is where you lay your head, so they will, have comfort, 
no more free will.
