His ascension to the angelic existence begins to commence, a heavenly world 
awaits a listless soul. Night begins to fall, the new child born, brought 
forth into this world. His ascension to the angelic existence begiins to 
commence a heavenly world awaits a listless soul. Night begins to fall, the 
new child born, brought forth into this world. One soul's last breath, one 
hearts first beat. One soul's last breath, one heart's first beat. His Eyes, 
so innocent and pure, they cannot sense this mourning air. His surroundings, 
new and not yet jaded, to all the worlds suffering to all the worlds 
suffering goodnight but not goodbye.
