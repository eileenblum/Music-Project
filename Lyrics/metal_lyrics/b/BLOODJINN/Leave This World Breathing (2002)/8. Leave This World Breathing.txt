"Where were you"?
My thought screamed. "Do you even love me"? Oh how my heart ached. 
Abandooned to the horror of my solitude, "where were you?" "where were you?" 
"where were you?" Lifeless and loved less. double shifts and overtime, don't 
make sense to a lonely child. Your abscence is the void, growing within my 
soul. "where were you?" lifeless and loved less. How the tears came so 
easily.

Now that you have departed from this world, an age has come when questions 
are abound, inquiries into your existence and life. I then recalled 
something you said, so profound... "I never clamed to have all the answeers, 
although you thought I should, I was driven by love, motivated by you. I 
tried to provide the best that I could, I tried to provide the best that I 
could." I couldn't grasp their meaning that solemn day, but your tone moved 
through my heart, driven by love, I have kept them safe, since that solemn 
day, knowing that they would one day ring true, drivin by live. So I sit 
here alone again while he is dreaming thinking of you and everything. I 
didn't understand. I long to go back to my days as a child, and re-live life 
without a heart and a handful of hate...
forgiveness.

As I hold him in my arms, all I can think of is you, I finally understand 
what kind of hell you were going through. We are all driven by love. We are 
all sometimes sacrificed for the sake of love, As we leave this world 
breathing.
