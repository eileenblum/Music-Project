Looking down into this reflection, reminds me of how things used to be, 
before the world took my soul, the innocence is just a dream. I am unclean, 
I'll die trying to find the stars, to find myself in you is worth the pain. 
We wear the same skin, we breathe the same air, my whole existence is you, 
to never forget my gift of life, to always be there, donnn't let go. We talk 
but we do not speak, do you even know me? Hear this voice. See this man 
standing before you, I'm still a child, trapped in this broken man, it hurts 
me to see what I have become, I am to weak to fight, please remember me.
