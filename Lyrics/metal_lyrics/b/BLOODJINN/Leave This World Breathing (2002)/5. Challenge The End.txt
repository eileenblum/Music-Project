An honest feeling of regret, an honest feeling o flove, within a single 
flash, it can all be taken away, I never old have thought it could be me 
struggling in life. To be the one who people depended on to survive, I don't 
understand, Why it was me? All I ever asked for was for my loved ones to be 
safe, It's my time to leave soon, please don't ever forget me, hold my hand 
tight, I'm afraid to let go, the memories of you I will carry on inside me. 
An honest feeling of regret, an honest feeling of love, within a single 
flash , it can all be taken away, I never would have thought it could be, me 
stuggling. To be the one who people depended on to survive, I don't 
understand why it was me, why was I chosen? these memories of you I will 
carry on inside me.
