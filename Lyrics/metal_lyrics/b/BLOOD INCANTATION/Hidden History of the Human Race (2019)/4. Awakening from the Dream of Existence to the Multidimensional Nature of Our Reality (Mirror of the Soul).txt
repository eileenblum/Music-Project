"Night opens wide the gates of space
To make the Earth a flying star on which we travel through the ALL
Like arrows - speeding towards unknown aim
The spheres move ceaselessly through unknown realms
Carrying us from Void to Void - through Time and Eternity

And thus we move within the spheres of our mind-created ALL
From Dream to Dream
Until the Void within us can absorb the Light that is both Origin and Aim"

Souls are the fuel of Archons, so the masses can't awaken
Activate the merkabah field and ascend celestial plains

Cast down to Amenti and adrift in the Halls of Judgement
Thoth grants the souls entry and guards the quest of passage:
Netherward descent into the afterworld and through the Abyss

Tangible helix patterns unfurl the grid of the ancients
Synthesize the lifetime of a dream

Far away in the land of dreams - Coast inside the waves of my soul
Deep within the Mind I see - Opening my heart to the ALL

Mystical pure white light
V I B R A T O R Y H A L L U C I N A T I O N
Glowing like a spore in the Cosmic Mind
Feast upon the flesh of the Gods of Time

Endless lifetimes wasted meandering
Your life ends, lost to mystery

Endless spiraling tentacles inside - Your mind a host to once-unseen
astral parasites

...Human life is merely a mosaic of endless parallel worlds and
synchronistic events perceived by Man as aimless Chaos...
