Incarnate in time to play the game of life &amp; death
Human souls at war - endlessly reborn just to die... and die again

Sow the seeds of suffering to break the chains of consciousness
For he who's called Yaldabaoth

You're free inside - This demiurge is beyond Time
This great nothing is eneding - but the only change is in your mind

What the eyes can't see

The search begins within synthetic light beings
From within the nine dimensions
A hologram unseen

The soul's ascent begins again, as the Mind merges with the all

...Cross the bridge divine, from the Cosmic Mind...

Quantum desolation opens the Gate of Mind
