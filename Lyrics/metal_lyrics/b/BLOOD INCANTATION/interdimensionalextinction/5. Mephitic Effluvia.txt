Suffocating aura emanating decay
Limbless horror radiates
The fetied reek of plague
Planets burning away
Celestial bodies decay
Planetary funeral
As world go up in flames
Tides of blood for sacrifice
To their alien names
Born of blood and starspawn
In times beneath the earth
Siphoning the life source
Of humans their birth
