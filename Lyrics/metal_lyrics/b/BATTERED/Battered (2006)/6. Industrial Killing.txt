[Music: Glesnes / Storesund, Lyrics: Glesnes]

Deeds and actions, beyond explanation
In line, naked and cold
Strapped down violently, enter damnation
Ethnic cleansing unfold

In the distance, the gate opens wide
Call forth the horror to come
Genocide with a sick wayward pride
Heartless, warp-minded scum

Speech and silence are one
Bell tolls, no where to run
Not to be forgotten
Not to be forgiven

The stain of human nature
Deep and profound

Stripped by pride
Cleansed by life
Remission through shedding blood
The stain of human nature
Deep and profound
The true cry of mankind

Not to be forgotten
Not to be forgiven
Not to be forgotten
Not to be forgiven
