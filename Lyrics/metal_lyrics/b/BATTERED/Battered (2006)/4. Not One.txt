[Music: Glesnes, Lyrics: Olaisen]

A single blow won't take it away
Gets tough and harder
Still, that's the enemy
One wish wasn't all, it never was
He shifts from paste, to solid,
And ponders the choices
He never got to make

Straight away
Pointed line
Mould and brake
Animate

You won't get to no one
Not me
Not one
Never fulfilled
Or be what you could be
You won't get to no one
Not me
Not one
It's the hardest choice
Drive till' you meet the wall

He peels the silver lining
Once started, it's irreversible
One taste is all he ever got
He made what he could
Made himself hard as hell

No cause. No allegiance
No sleep. None is needed
No faith. Smarter than that
Regrets? Not one
