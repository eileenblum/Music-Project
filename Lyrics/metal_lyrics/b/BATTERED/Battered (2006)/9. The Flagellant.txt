[Music: Storesund / Glesnes, Lyrics: Olaisen]

And their feet trod through the ash
White hands blistering
There was nothing here
Only what they had delivered
No light split the horizon
Nothing beyond the veil
Only this blighted earth
(And the sound of dust over bone)

White pain
It's over. End it
No time to undo
We're unmade
It's time to let go
End me

They used to have each other
But no one remembered
Once they gave one another
Blinded by faith,
The sky split open
And time reflected itself
Where does it leave us?
(Build me this god...)

(And so the earth was harvested...)
