[Music: Storesund, Lyrics: Storesund]

I can help you
I've helped you to your grave
Because I need to
To redeem myself though I've never made no difference at all

Please, take this for my guilt
Though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will pay you for my guilt

Now look
Can you hear me from your grave?
Because I need you to
To remove that finger from my face like I did nothing at all

Please take this for my guilt
Though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will pay you for my guilt

Demagog for hire
Bring a toast to my name
Demagog, false liar
Contribute to my game before I stop

I'm touched
Like I touched you all
From my benevolent self
Now put your distress on the shelf
I'll put you back on your feet

Please take this for my guilt
Though I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will pay you for my guilt

Behold
My vision to unfold
My blazing son
Now look to the west, to my chest
The cross of freedom for all

Please take this for my guilt
Walking dead
I will pay you for my guilt
