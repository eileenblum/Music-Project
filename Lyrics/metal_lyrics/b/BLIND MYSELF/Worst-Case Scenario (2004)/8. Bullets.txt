The world was spinning faster than ever
Sweating bullets couldn't wait in the chamber

Like an octupus with thousand killing hands
That holds you, pulls you down like quicksand

Get me out of here!
Let me out now!

Was a crusader tryin' to win the battle
A futile fight in the age of medieval

The world was spinning faster than ever
sweating bullets -six of 'em- locked in there

Get me out of here!
Let me out now!

Fire and fly but don't forget to keep the gunpowder dry

Get me out of here!
Let me out now!

Get
Me
Outta
Here!
Let
Me
Out
Now!

So many of you thought the fate was blind
But I say you should fight to break out and leave the stones behind
Don't turn the gun against yourself be the bullet instead
Be the one that can penetrate and do not care about hate

Fire and fly but don't forget to keep the gunpowder dry

Get me out of here!
Let me out now!

Get
Me
Outta
Here!
Let
Me
Out
Now!

You should fight
And break out
Leave the stones behind
Be the bullet
Penetrate
Do not care about hate
You should fight
And break out
Leave the stones behind
