Picture is incomprehensible
The reptiles want to solve the riddle
Don't like it? Then cry and hate it.
The rebels want to imitate it

Try your own neck to strangle
Force the cube into the circle
Be aware! Beware!
Put your brain into a wheelchair
Watch your TV -and stare

Rape your own brain
And get a migraine
Rape
Your
Own
Brain

I am painting again with joy
Feel it and accept it

Sensual nonsense
Senseless truth
Emotional pretence
Rational defence

Try your own neck to strangle
Force the cube into the circle
Be aware! Beware!
Put your brain into a wheelchair
Watch your TV -and stare

Rape your own brain
And get a migraine
Rape
Your
Own
Brain
