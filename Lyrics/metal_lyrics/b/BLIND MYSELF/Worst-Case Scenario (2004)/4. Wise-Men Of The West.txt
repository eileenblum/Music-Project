They are the Wise-Men,
Came from the West
From the God-forsaken
Land of pests.

Their tongue is weapon,
A double-edged sword
Killing the innocent
And it's killing the old

Their weapon is their tongue
Double-edged sword
Wrethes the innocent
Drives nuts the old

They hide behind
Mighty cyber-mist
And they never see,
Their friend the Beast

They seek revenge
In land of pests
They dig up dirt
From the snobish west

Their weapon is their tongue
Double-edged sword
Wrethes the innocent
Drives nuts the old

Wise-Men of the west
Not gonna pass the test
Wise-Men of the West
Filth and dirt and mess

They are the Wise-Men,
Came from the West
From the God-forsaken
Land of pests.

Their tongue is weapon,
A double-edged sword
Killing the innocent
And it's killing the old

Their weapon is their tongue
Double-edged sword
Wretches the innocent
Drives nuts the old

Wise-Men of the West
Not gonna pass the test
Wise-Men of the West
Filth and dirt and mess

Don't hide, don't lie
'Cause
I see you, guys.
