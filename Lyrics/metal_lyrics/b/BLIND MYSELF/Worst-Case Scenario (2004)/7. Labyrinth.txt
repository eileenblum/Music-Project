Get away - get outside,
Run with her - side by side,
Climbing down - dirty sheets,
Breaking through -the narrow streets.
That's what you get 'cause you got
Right into this dirty plot!!

Bang-bang-bang
Guerilla war has no end
Bang-bang-bang
Noone survives the end

She was right - I was wrong
My heart was - not 'nough strong
Sold my soul - got nothing back
The fight is now - off the track
Take your gun - got the call
Your back is now- 'gainst the wall!!

Bang-bang-bang
Guerilla war has no end
Bang-bang-bang
Noone survives the end

Walking thru' a bone-dry meadow
Birds fly over - and cast shadow
Saw a butterfly, reach out with my hand
A voice says: don't touch me!

Sky and Land - light green and blue
Lonely boat - without the crew
Saw an angel - reach out to touch her
And she says: come with me!

Top of the cliff - vast land underneath
Looking at the - dried-out heath
Smoke and fire, laments the choir
Reality comes back to me!

Bang-bang-bang
Guerilla war has no end
Bang-bang-bang
Noone survives the end

Get away - get outside,
Run with her - side by side,
Climbing down - dirty sheets,
Breaking through -the narrow streets.
That's what you get 'cause you got
Right into this dirty plot!
