On the bottom of the box.
At the end of the bill
On the side of the screen
On the side of the page

It is there,
Written.
'Cause it
Cannot be hidden.

Cancer can grow
Take this pill
And your heart'll be still

Yet there it is, in black and white,
A truthful lie in bright daylight

On the bottom of the box.
At the end of the bill
On the side of the screen
On the side of the page

You overlooked it
Never understood it

Yet there it is, in black and white,
A truthful lie in bright daylight

Written with small characters
The truth is written with small characters

Lie
