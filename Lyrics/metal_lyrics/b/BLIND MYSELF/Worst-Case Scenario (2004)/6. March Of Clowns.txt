March of clowns
Wearing crowns
Parade of dumbs
Beating drums

March of clowns
Street shutdowns
Noise and dirt
Do be alert!

March of clowns
Wearing crowns
Parade of dumbs
Beating drums

March of clowns
Street shutdowns
Noise and dirt
Do be alert!

Under the big fake smile
Sophisticated style
Empty face and fish eye
You are wicked and sly!

Hey!

And the Snake tells the tale
Waiter serves a cocktail
Rum, truth and lie in it
You need the clean spirit

Hey!

It's written on your tombstone
"She had a heart of stone"
Enough of this slumber
Wake up and grow stronger

Your tombstone
Heart of stone
Just grow strong!

You are soft to thyself
And yet tough to others
What a clown you are man
Playboy with a suntan

What a clown
You are now!
Be a man!
Be human!

March of clowns
Wearing crowns
Parade of dumbs
Beating drums

Under the big fake smile
Sophisticated style
Empty face and fish eye
You're wicked and sly!

Hey!
