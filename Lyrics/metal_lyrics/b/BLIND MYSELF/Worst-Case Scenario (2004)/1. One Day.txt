Nobody feels guilty
Himself of the crime
The system is perfect
In peace, in wartime

In this game
I tell you, man
You better be
A wolf than a lamb.

Just as guilty as the other one,
Just as silly as another one

Sailin from the ARARAT
Sailing from that place
Came so close to a cateract
Falling from Grace

Get out, get away!

The chain is as strong as it's weakest link
The pride, your pride is the weakest link

Get out, get away!

One day.
