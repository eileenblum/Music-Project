I wanna be the number one
The One out of a million
I wanna climb the highest peak
And get all the best critique

I wanna be the number one
The special and the chosen one
I wanna be the king of kings
To be the master of the strings

Worst-Case Scenario - Get yourself prepared and go
Worst-Case Scenario - Much anger you will swallow
Worst-Case Scenario - For a war, you need ammo
Worst-Case Scenario - Stay alert

Worst-Case Scenario - Get yourself prepared and go
Worst-Case Scenario - Much anger you will swallow
Worst-Case Scenario - For a war, you need ammo
Worst-Case Scenario - Stay alive

Hoping the best but getting the worst
Paying the debt - playing unrehearsed
Is it a test or is it a game?
Nevertheless, you'll never
Be the same
Be the same

Worst-Case Scenario - Get yourself prepared and go
Worst-Case Scenario - Much anger you will swallow
Worst-Case Scenario - For a war, you need ammo
Worst-Case Scenario - Stay alert

I walk away now
