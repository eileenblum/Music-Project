The chase has ended
At the very beginning

cannot run away from the plain pain
cannot fly away with an airplane
cannot get away from the migraine
cannot go away and drink champaign

...And you will be tired at the end
At last i'll meet you, friend
You didn't move the slightest bit.
Stay away from painful fights

The Chase
Look into your heart and then admit it:
That is the end. You could never win it

Don't run, cause I am always behind you
And you will be tired at the end
But your smell will always betray you
At last i'll meet you, friend

cannot run away from the plain pain
cannot fly away with an airplane
cannot get away from the migraine
cannot go away and drink champaign

The Chase
Look into your heart and then admit it:
That is the end. You could never win it
