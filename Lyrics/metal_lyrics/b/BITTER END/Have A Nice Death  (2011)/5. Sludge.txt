Their power lingers - with roving eyes
And you'll learn obedience
From the Minister of lies
A paranoid fantasy - of nightmare come to life?
Manipulating populations - Manipulating lives
With big lies

[Chorus:]
Monkey see - Monkey do
Can't you see - the joke's on you
I can't flee - What I see
Denying our - Denying our humanity

Subterfuge - Deceit and guile
Looking straight into your face
And lying through their smiles
Playing on your weakness
Preying on your fear
They'll play upon your sympathies
They'll tell you what you want to hear
Can you hear? The big lie....

[Repeat chorus]

Automate - Systemize - Standardize - Dehumanize
Don't let concrete glass and steel
Severties between us and a world more read
A world more real.
