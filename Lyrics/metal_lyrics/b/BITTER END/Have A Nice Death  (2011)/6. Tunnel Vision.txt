Your eyes are open - But your mind
Yes your mind - Is closed
Humiliation or self - Preservation
Heads they win - and tails you lose
Selective perception - or just self-deception?
Is Tunnel Vision blinding you?

[Chorus:]
See not - hear not
Think not - and fear not
You can race to the cliff - or face the abyss
Or try to avoid the disaster unfolding below
Tunnel Vision - Your decision
Tunnel Vision

Inertia takes over - And stagnation prevails
You're off the offensive - entrenched, and defensive
Stagnant thoughts in a frozen mind
No longer objective - You're lost your perspective
And what you don't know - You won't mind

[Repeat chorus]
