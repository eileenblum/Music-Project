Why do we toe the line?
They'll make the choice a crime
They call it right to life
How can they be so blind?
The fetus has to live
Your womb is their to give
Protecting life unborn
Those here are on their own - on their own!

Back alleys - And side streets
Another dirty room - Another bloody sheet
Your sister or your wife
Under a butcher's knife
It can't be wished away - it's here to stay
Here to stay.

Can't you see that we're heading down the road
To complete control - our bodies aren't our own
They won't rest until I they're subjected
The rest of us to their will
Oh God they make me ill
Slam the door on the poor
Make no effort to fulfill their needs
Just let them breed
Once they're started - there's no way they'll be stopped
So let's stop them now - While we have the chance.
