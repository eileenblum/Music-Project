[Bonus Track]Stormclouds loom darkly as battle is joined
Itâs time to prepare for the fight
Donât stand in the wings and await better things
Or youâll find out that lifeâs passed you by

Wake up, and see the lights
Face facts âcause youâve got to fight
So donât let them grind you down
Stand tall, and donât be pushed around

Small minded people control what you think
And theyâve twisted our means to their ends
Theyâd drown us all in a sea of red ink
To put our filth to an end

Wake up, and look around
âCause youâre trapped, and these walls surround you
Can you see through their disguise?
Timeâs short, so open your eyes

Wake up, and look around
âCause youâre trapped, and these walls surround you
Can you see through their disguise?
Timeâs short, so open your fucking eyes

The day we most fear draws so quietly near
Theyâll soon end the faults of our ways
Computer control puts us deep in the hole
Weâre numbered along with our days!
