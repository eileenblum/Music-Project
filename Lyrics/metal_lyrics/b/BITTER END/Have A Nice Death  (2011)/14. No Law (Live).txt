[Bonus Track]Wake No Law - That's what I thought they said
Freedom of speech is a right that we all have
Censorship is Un-American
It's Black and White
It's called the First Amendment

[Chorus:]
How much clearer can it get
Why don't they understand at all?
That No Law - Means No Law at all!

Do their best - To legislative morality
With success - we all become a bit less free
I don't know who these people think they are
But I know - I know that they're gone too far
I don't tell these people how to live their lives
And I don't want 'em telling me how to live mine

[Repeat chorus]
