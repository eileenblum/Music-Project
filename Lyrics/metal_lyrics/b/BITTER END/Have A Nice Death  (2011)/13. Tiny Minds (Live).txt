[Bonus Track]Why do people seen so stupid?
So easy for others lead?
Does being alone make them for the unknown?
Are they only naive?

They follow their leaders - don't question their teachers
they've sleep - and they're easily ruled
With a little imagination - they're yours for the taking
Cash in - on the kindness of fools

Yeah
The blind lead the blind
Wasting the time
Of tiny minds - Tiny Minds

Is it ignorance - or is it Malevolence?
Is this all that they have to do?
They've got their hands in your pocket
And their nose in your business
And they'll take what they can from you

They're making a killing - but you can't rape the willing
Some people just can't get enough
There's no lie too outrageous to run in their pages
They'll print anything for a buck

Yeah
The blind lead the blind
Wasting the time
Of tiny minds - Tiny Minds

Late at night - when you're alone
Look out your windows and listen at your doors
You know they're out there - And what they'll do
That they'll do anything to get their dirt on you

With interests purient - and motives less than pure
No secrets safe - no confidence secure
With malice in their hearts - and tiny quitter minds
The ink starts flowing and the rumors start to fly
Let 'em fly!

[Repeat chorus/out]
