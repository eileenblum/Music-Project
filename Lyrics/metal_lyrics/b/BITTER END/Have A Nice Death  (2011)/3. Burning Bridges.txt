How can you look me in the eye?
When we both know that you're the one who lied
You're got on awful lot of nerve
And someday you're gonna get what you deserve

Somebody needs to show you
That things all go around in life
I only hope you see the difference
But if you don't it serves you right

Why did you stab me in the back?
Are you just jealous of the things you lack?
I'll keep my hatred to myself
Because given enough rope you will hang yourself

[Repeat Chorus]

Why won't you tell me where we went wrong?
Why our friendship is so far gone?
Why can't we try to communicate?
Is it really too late?
That's your loss - No love lost
That's your loss - What can you say
When there's no love lost

I went out of my way for you
All you showed was ingratitude
Offered my hand and you turned your back
Is your heart truly black?

That's your loss - No love lost
That's your loss - No love.... lost.

You're burning all your bridges down
What comes around really does go around
You keep betraying all your friends
And they will remember till the Bitter End

[Repeat Chorus]
