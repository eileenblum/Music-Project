Well they tell you all to just say no
But we all know where they can go
They're all a bunch of hypocrites
And if they just say no, I'll just say yes

Hysterical, McCarthyist, they want to find a nice quick fix
A witch hunt is being carried on
And all of your rights will soon be gone
They catch your ass with one small joint
They'll take your car, you'll get the point
They'll nail you up onto that cross
But Noriega got paid off

Just say no to poverty
Just say no to misery
Just say no to Ronnie's wife
Just say yes to real life

Saying no will fail the test
Without a reason to say yes
Drugs are a symptom not the cause
They're not the source of all our flaws
The world's got problems that's a fact
But it's gone too far to turn it all back
The war on drugs is so much bull
Our jails are already full
Should we let a few child molesters out?
I guess so

Stupid, fucking, narrow-minded, longwinded
Short-sighted, useless stupid, fucking fools
Well fuck them all and all their rules
Why don't they put this shit to rest?
They tell me no, I tell them yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

Zero tolerance that's the way
They'll make the average bozo pay
But working for the C.I.A.
Means the big fish get to swim away
Iran - contra, Pentagon
But we all know what's going on
And we're the ones who'll pay the cost
And if anyone's guilty it's them not us

Just say no to all their lies
Don't say no without asking why
Just say no to hypocrisy
Just say yes to reality
