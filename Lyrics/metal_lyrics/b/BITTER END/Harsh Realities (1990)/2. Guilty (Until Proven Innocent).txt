If they donât like your face
Theyâll put you in your place
Youâve got no recourse
Youâre guilty as charged
You canât tell them right from wrong
If they think they know which side youâre on
Youâre at their mercy
And their mercy is no place to be!
It ainât no place for me!

Theyâve got the badges
Theyâve got the guns
You ainât got a bloody thing
When someoneâs word is law!
Youâve gotta hide your rage
Or theyâll put you in the cage
Just smile at the injustice
And be grateful if they let you walk away

If they donât like your face
Theyâll put you in your place
Youâve got no recourse
Youâre guilty has charged
You canât tell them right from wrong
If they think they know which side youâre on
Youâre at their mercy
And their mercy is no place to be!
Then if they say youâre guilty
And then youâre guilty!
