Weâre all fucking and fighting
From beginning to end
Sex gives you life
And death is lifeâs end
Death is the end

From the moment you drop out
Until youâre dropped back in, oh yeah
Remember that birth means youâre marked
With original sin

It wonât ever change
Itâs always beginning again
The way that it starts and the way that it ends
Always stay the same
Stay the same

Sex and death!..

Iâve seen what life is, itâs all sex and death!

Sex and death!..

Inevitability
Beckons us all
With sex we are lured
With death, we answer the call

Itâs always the same
Always beginning again
The way that it starts and the way that is ends
Always stay the same
Stay the fucking same
