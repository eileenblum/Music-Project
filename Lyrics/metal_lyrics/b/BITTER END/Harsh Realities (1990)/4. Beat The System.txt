Taken to the limit
Theyâve pushed you to the wall
They seem to think they own you
And itâs time their bluff was called
Donât let yourself be bullied
They havenât got the right
Donât let them take advantage of you
Not without a fight!

You give some men an inch
You know theyâll steal a mile
Theyâll stab you in the back
And keep on laughing all the while
Donât let those assholes grind you down
Donât let them waste your time
Stand up and defy them
Or theyâll use you every time

Beat the system, beat them at their own game
Donât take the bullshit or theyâll drive you insane
Follow your heart, no matter what they say
Beat the system âcause youâve gotta live life your way!

If they win youâre gonna lose
So fight them tooth and nail
Who cares about their rights
When truth and justice are for sale?
Are we men or are we mice?
Are we all wolves or sheep?
If ignorance is bliss
Then weâre all blissfully asleep

Itâs all a load of bullshit
Or donât you see the light?
Youâve gotta use your brains
If youâre gonna win the fight
Obedience to petty tyrants
The cowardice of fools
Iâm a law unto myself
And Iâm breaking all the rules

Beat the system, beat them at their own game
Donât take the bullshit or theyâll drive you insane
Follow your heart, no matter what they say
Beat the system âcause youâve gotta live life your way!
Live you way, yeah beat the system!

Taken to the limit
Theyâve pushed you to the wall
They seem to think they own you
And itâs time their bluff was called
Donât let yourself be bullied
They havenât got the right
Donât let them take advantage of you
Not without a fight!

You give some men an inch
You know theyâll steal a mile
Theyâll stab you in the back
And keep on laughing all the while
Donât let those assholes grind you down
Donât let them waste your time
Stand up and defy them
Or theyâll use you every time

Beat the system, beat them at their own game
Donât take the bullshit or theyâll drive you insane
Follow your heart, no matter what they say
Beat the system âcause youâve gotta live life
