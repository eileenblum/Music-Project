Prepare to meet your maker
Heâs gonna bring you down
The reaperâs knocking at your door
And heâll plant you underground
You havenât got a prayer
Youâre waiting there to die
And when your numberâs up
Youâll kiss your ass goodbye, goodbye!

Sooner or later
Everybody buys the farm
You know itâs nothing new
Itâs no reason for alarm
You act so cool and calm
You donât even blink an eye
You havenât got me fooled
âCause no one wants to die!

No one, no one survives

Meet your maker on the firing line
No mistaking, when itâs time itâs time
No escaping, when they draw the line
If life is taken, please God donât take mine!

Kicking and screaming
They will drag you to your grave
So face the curtain call now
If youâre all so brave
This life is terminal
We all go in the end
The only difference is how we die
And when it ends

One hundred years from now
Weâll all be dead and gone
Rotting in our graves
Or passed into the world beyond
Our days are numbered
Weâre just waiting for the call
Face your mortality
For death will take us all!

No one, no one survives
You die!

Prepare to meet your maker
Heâs gonna bring you down
The reaperâs knocking at your door
And heâll plant you underground
You havenât got a prayer
Youâre waiting there to die
And when your numberâs up
Youâll kiss your ass goodbye, goodbye!

No one, no one survives
