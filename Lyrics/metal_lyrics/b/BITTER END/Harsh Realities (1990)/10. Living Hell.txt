Is this life or is this death?
Well, just what makes you think itâs all for the best?
Do you care, can you feel the pain?
Two billion people being starved for your gain

It seems that growth never keeps us with need
Too many mothers got too many mouths to feed
Damned if we do, weâll be damned if we donât
Things have to change and we all know that they wonât

Will things get better?
Well, who can tell?
But if this is Heaven
Then show me Hell!

Build swords from plowshares, squeeze blood from a stone
And when theyâve used you, youâll be left on your own!
There seems no hope as we race towards the fall
The war machine will consume us all

Violence and bloodshed, the folly of man
They call it progress, I call it a scam
Push blindly forward without asking why
The rich gets richer, the poor can all die!

Will things get better?
Well, who can tell?
But if this is Heaven
Then show me Hell!

Show me Hell!

Show me Hell!

Is this life or is this death?
Well, just what makes you think itâs all for the best?
Do you care, can you feel the pain?
Two billion people being starved for your gain

It seems that growth never keeps us with need
Too many mothers got too many mouths to feed
Damned if we do, weâre gonna be fucked if we donât
Things have to change and we all know that they wonât

Know they wonât, they wonât, they wonât, they wonât
