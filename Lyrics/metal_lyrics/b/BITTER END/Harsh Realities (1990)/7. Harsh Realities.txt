Life is nasty, brutish, and short
It gives you no breaks, forgive no mistakes
Itâs time you got wise, opened your eyes
And dealt with the world as it is

Harsh realities

Itâs time to stop living this life of illusion
Ignoring lifeâs problems creates no solutions
Our leaders have lied, thereâs nowhere to hide
Weâve lived past our means and now the bills must be paid
And weâre the ones who pay!

Life is nasty, brutish and short
It gives you no breaks, forgive no mistakes
Itâs time you got wise, opened your eyes
And dealt with the world as it is

Harsh realities
