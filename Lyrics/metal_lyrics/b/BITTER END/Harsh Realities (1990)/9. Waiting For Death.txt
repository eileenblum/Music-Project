Pulled to the limit
And I canât take the strain
The worldâs gone mad
And this madness will drive me insane
I canât take this pain!

Signals are crossed
I donât know what to think
Confusion and chaos
Are driving me over the brink
And I need a drink!

Youâre waiting, waiting for death
Waiting, waiting for death

Trapped in the rat-race
And Iâm playing their game
But Iâll keep on fighting
âCause Iâm never gonna be tamed
I wonât be tamed!

If you know the truth
Donât swallow their lies
Ignore what they tell you
And learn to believe your own eyes
And not their lies!

Youâre waiting, waiting for death
Waiting, waiting for death

Pulled to the limit
And I canât take the strain
The worldâs gone mad
And this madness will drive me insane
I canât take this pain!

Signals are crossed
I donât know what to think
Confusion and chaos
Are driving me over the brink
I need a drink!

Youâre waiting, waiting for death
Waiting, waiting for death
