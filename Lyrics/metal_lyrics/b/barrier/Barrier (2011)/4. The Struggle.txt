Shut them off
Dead bolt the door
They waste your time
You wonder what your put here for.
You thought
You'd make a difference
You thought
You were a better change
But people have this way of coming in and screwing things

Iâm starting to see it all come together

Iâm rolling over
Yeah Iâm the smart one
No expectations to build and tear me down from

And itâs lights out
We donât do what we should
You canât tell right from wrong
How that line gets misunderstood
Iâll never know

How did you screw this up
Itâs all crumbling crumbling
You really dug your hole
And now youâve let me stumble in
You fallen short for me
Every time
Oh every time

This world has love
I swear it does
Let your walls come down
And make something of
Yourself
Or more importantly someone else.
Please show yourself
This world can love
I know it does

Hold back the heartbreak
Pin it down
Break every weakness
Forget what you once found

Time is short
Everyone's running out
Of patience for this world
We know weâre not about.

Someone show some guts
Someone show them glory
Someone say Iâll make a change and putt them all before me.
Some show some guts
Someone show some glory

Hold back the heart break
We don't do what we should
How that line got misunderstood
I'll never know
I'll never know

Fall into a state of hate
Suffocate the lies
Suffocate my mine
Fall into a state of hate
Gut out the eyes rip out the spine
