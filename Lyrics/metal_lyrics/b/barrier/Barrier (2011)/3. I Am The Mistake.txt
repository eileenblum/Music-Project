Why do I bother
Why do I bother

I'm wasting my time
Wasting my breath
Wasting away in my minds depths
I'm faced with worthless thoughts

I leave myself to deal with pain
Pointless pain builds into shame
Ive lost all feeling now I'm dealing with you
You're left to blame
Ive lost all feeling
Now I'm dealing with you
Ive lost all feeling now I'm dealing with you
You're to blame

You keep us calm
Ive kept calm for to long
You're the inspiration for every hate song
You're the biggest let down
My most cherished effort
I hate that i felt that and gave you my comfort

All our hearts sucked dry
The believers first to die
And still all this time
We let our mistakes slide

All our hearts sucked dry
The believers first to die
And still all this time
We let our mistakes slide

Crooked minded
Learn your place
Learn your place
Rejection sinks in
But change is something you cant face
Your minds and open wound
Consume consume consume

Your words eat away at me
Comes from behind and calls to me
Grits its teeth
Sinks them in
Now I've seen things that could make hell cave in

Now I've seen things that could make hell cave in
