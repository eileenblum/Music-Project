A world run by hypocrites and fakes
Take
Whatever they can
Whatever they can
To get themselves up higher
Than youâve ever been

Youâve got more than a good heart
You have the strength to move
Mountains of people
Into living like you do

They cut at throats with ease
Ruining your world for free
There is no charge
The look on you're face is enough to please
The vicious minded
Running up and down your back
It never seemed to phase me
What makes you so different

I hate that I think this
But itâs the cold hard truth

Why canât you stand
And fight the good fight
Iâve been at it for years
Youâve just been at it all night
You've just been at it all night

They cut at throats with ease
Ruining your world for free
There is no charge
The look on you're face is enough to please
The vicious minded
Running up and down your back
It never seemed to phase me
What makes you so different

They keep wishing
That they're going strong
But in the end they trust bad hands
And thatâs where theyâll go wrong

Youâll never see it
Unless you take a stand
Right now you owe it to them
To save them from themselves
