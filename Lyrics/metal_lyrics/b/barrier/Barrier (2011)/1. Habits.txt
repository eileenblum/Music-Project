I thought this feeling was over with
Something I could quit
Easily
The scars of a past regret
Never forget
The memory

Donât kid yourself
these things are worthless to you
Thereâs something left, now what are you gonna do?

Iâm done losing sleep over this
Thereâs no reason that I canât replace the things I hate
I canât take another moment of this, but will I ever live without it?

Find strength, pull through

Pick up your feet, head home, head home
Thereâs no use in dwelling, youâre not alone
Pick up your feet, head home, head home
Fall back on your roots and let time heal

Iâll never truly be done with this
Habits never die
Iâll never truly be done with this
Habits never die

Vicious cycles running through my head
Sucks me dry until thereâs nothing left
Vicious cycles running through my head
Sucks me dry until thereâs nothing left
These things are worthless to you
Thereâs something left
Thereâs something left
