Force yourself
Force yourself Into a lie
To make things right again
Force yourself
Force yourself into thinking
That you've never been happier

Tear at your skin
Pour out the blood
Let go of the lies
That you're hiding from
Stitch up the wounds
Stair at the marks
Reminders of how far you've come

Let go
Let go

Let go of your attachments
As if that was ever holding you up
Its not enough
It'll never amount so just bury it

Your hearts in the wrong place
Throw your hopes in the dirt
Six feet under the ground
Now they're stripped of their worth
Your hearts in the wrong place
Your minds corrupt

Force yourself
Force yourself Into a lie
To make things right again
Force yourself
Force yourself into thinking
That you've never been happier

Break the ties
Make it right
Break the ties
Make it right

Clean the wound
Fight the feeling lived for
Hanging on to the memory
Clean the wound
Fight the feeling lived for
Hanging on to the memory
