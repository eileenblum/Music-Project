I want nothing more than to fill the hole inside my heart
Or else in my head, shoot me dead

Because the pain never leaves
I want to lie with the deceased
and rid my self of all these thoughts that circle me,
but then again
in the end
that's what brought me here initially

One man, two souls
he leads, I follow

One man, two souls
He leads, I follow
I'm left to deal
with wounds that won't heal

And only I know
the way the blood flows inside my veinsÂ 
Could this be my last night
amongst the pains of sight?
There's the man that you see with the innocent face
then there's the man that I feelÂ 
Who's made a mess of the place

My place, my homeÂ 
where I'm left to be alone
it's the last thing I had to myself
Now his hands plaster my bones
there's a stench in my soul
as my gut rots
This lack of faith in control

Nothing makes sense
My heads in my hands
There are fractures and dents
and I don't know which wall to throw it againstÂ 

The ones who cant think or breathe
will make the best of company
a family who would want the same for me
a bed of wooden sheets

Drill into my brain
Please just this once treat me like you would the mentally insane
Strap me down, fix me, fix me
Make me believe
That Iâm one step closer to sanity

One step closer to finally getting my closure

The ones who cant think or breathe
will make the best of company
a family who would want the same for me
a bed of wooden sheets
a bed of wooden sheets
