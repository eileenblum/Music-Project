Silent night, oh silent night
Six senses electrified
The vibrations contort as my awareness enters
Into the fire of an intangible eye

I arrive at the infinite present
The inward spatial dimension

Spiraling deeper into the origin of consciousness
I gaze upon the astral glow, drawn into the roots of creation
In silence, I hear the voice of truth
Wordless, shapeless, listen

Untouched by the hands of time
These ancient whispers of collective knowledge
I have entered the shared mind
I bear witness to the mind at large

Two steps above, two steps above
To the antecedent of thought
I stand above, I soar above
The confines of fear
And in this instant, I feel Arachneâs gentle vibratory touch
Raising my frequency

Greeting me, preceding me
Sharing her knowledge of this higher reality
(Weâre never alone)
At the origin of me is the origin of everything
All that is, interconnected in her hallowed labyrinth

There is no other way
One observed history
In the mold of limitless possibility
There is no other way
One observed history
In this moment, we choose what becomes of this

Riding the web
