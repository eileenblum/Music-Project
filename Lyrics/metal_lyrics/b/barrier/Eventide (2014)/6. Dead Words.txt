Can you hear me?
Please tell me you can hear me
Dear God I can't be alone
I'm finally here, I'm finally here
But not a soul in sight seems to be anywhere near
I verbalize, only to be met by a pair of blank eyes
Feels like I'm wasting my breath again

Feels like I'm wasting my breath

Programmed, homogenized
Blinded by the veil of a lifetime of lies
Led by the shepherds
Into the valley of the dark

So I have come
In an attempt to illuminate
Paralyzing fear, our most deadly creation

Dissolving a shroud of self-ignorance
Bringing to light the reality of the unconscious
Our perspectives collide
Waves lost to the wind from the inside

I keep trying but I can't break through
Dead words to deaf ears
The truth only enters as far as the mind
Is ready to hear
So can you hear me?
Tell me, can you hear me?
So can you hear me?
Oh tell me you can hear these dead words
