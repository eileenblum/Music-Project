Ignite, feel, combust
Clear your mind, deviate from the bounds of thought into feeling
Open your heart to what weâve all been concealing
A trust built from underneath us
Integrate yourself and come closer

I can feel it inching closer
(A trust built from underneath us)
I can feel weâre getting closer
(Strengthen these bonds, come closer)

Omega, to bring us home at last
To reunite after so long held apart
An ending to give rise to a new beginning
Flowing together in this perpetual metamorphosis
Donât fear
(Donât fear, donât fear the unknown)
We are but wiping away sand from our unity
It was never lost, only buried

Shed your skin
Welcome this beautiful death
Beautiful birth
