My true self revealed in the absence of all but thought
Awareness itself is the light that fills the void

I feel the weight of the infinite in this endless moment of indecision
Frozen by the polarity of heaven and earth

Pulling at me
Wipe me clean
Let this life unfold through this body
Let my self be known
Wipe me clean
Let this life unfold through this body
Let my self be known

Separation beckons me to the sphere of self discovery
I know I must return as a beacon for humanity
I feel Gaia calling me back into her fertile realm of creation
Urging the source toward manifestation

Wipe me clean
Let this life unfold through this body
Let my self be known
Wipe me clean
Let this life unfold through this body
Let my self be known

(Can you hear it collapsing?)
(Can you feel it collapsing?)
(Can you hear it collapsing?)
(Can you feel it collapsing?)
Can you hear it collapsing?
Can you hear it collapsing?
Cause I can feel myself breaking away
From father's arms into mother's domain

Separation beckons me to the sphere of self discovery
Separation beckons me as a beacon
To free humanity from this death march
Toward a future of lobotomized subordination
To show them all their true potential
To heal the wounds of our beloved earth
I sacrifice this transcendent existence
For limitation, mind-body confined
Separated from the one true reality
As I enter the plane of physicality
