What a ride, what a secret to hide
Held in place by the illusion of time
We are insects
Stuck in the web of our own collective dream

We are the conscious vertices
Within the inter-dimensional network
Tethered to each other by the fibers of life

Every thought, every feeling
Decides the frequency we choose to experience
A constellation of sentient forms
Our minds interwoven

Come forth
Together, we cannot be restrained
