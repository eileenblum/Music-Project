Suspended in endless time
This dormant serpent lies coiled within me
Trying to feel its way out of this stasis
But where to begin?

There has to be a purpose
There has to be a point to all of this
The patterns run too deep
The voices wonât let me sleep
I see the edges of the tunnel thatâs restricted my vision
Slowly coming into focus
My adopted, limiting thoughts
Begin to fade into oblivion

Who is the witness to these thoughts I call my own?
Where is the substance to this life that Iâve been shown?
Reach through the veil, I can feel you watching
Expose the truth surrounding me

Synapses reconstructing,
I internalize reality
Iâve discovered the key

Iâm overcome by a familiar warmth
As suddenly it all makes sense

Awake
I feel why Iâm alive
How blind Iâve been to purpose
(Through soulless eyes)
While Motherâs been here all along
Her beauty, her perfection
How far we have strayed
(How far weâve strayed away)
I hear The Way, I know The Way
We are the only way
