I, the Zero, the One

I surrender to eternity
Like a black hole collapsing unto itself
The feeling of home will pull me through this
Aperture into the heavenly realms

Flesh stripped away reveals the light of my animation
Divine blood flowing back into the heart of all
I stare through these eternal eyes
Accelerating toward the absolute

I, the Zero, the One
I am everything there is and ever was

Oblivion, we meet again
How warm and familiar the arms of your embrace
Guiding me home, if only for a moment
Guiding me back to where it all began

Oblivion, we meet again
Dear oblivion, we meet again

Out of sight, into Mind
Into the moment
Empty, but with such fullness
The perfection, the only awareness
The source of creation
