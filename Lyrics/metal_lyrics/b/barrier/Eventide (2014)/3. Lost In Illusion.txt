Inertia
I feel your iron grip take hold of me
This ego yearns for sovereignty

Sign after sign passing me by
(Not for me, not for me, I've got someone to be)
With a voice inside my head that says I'm living a lie
(Look away, look away, there's just too much to see)
I cling tightly to my selfish needs
Blinded in this matrix of my programmed beliefs

I'm imprisoned
By conceptualization of thought
Separating myself from the whole

Warden, oh warden
Where have you left the key
To free myself
From this bitter, lonely reality?
A self-constructed cell
A self-constructed Hell

Sign after sign passing me by
(Not for me, not for me, I've got someone to be)
With a voice inside my head that says I'm living a lie
(Look away, look away, there's just too much to see)
Everything so meaningless, my personal fiction
Terminally drifting here in my world of endless contradiction

Inertia
I feel your iron grip take hold of me, this ego
Yearns - for sovereignty
Disconnected
Yet I feel right at home
Alone inside, so alone

I'm tearing at these walls that surround me,
Something's got to break
Holding on for redemption, for some holy escape
Some kind of light at the end of the tunnel
Whatever it might be
I can feel it calling me, so warden,
Where have you left the key?
