We recreate, surrender our present selves
Beyond the walls of doubt and uniformity
Let go of the weight of the past to
Open the gates to the undefined
Here and now our potential unbound
With the jaws of perception liquefied
With open arms, embrace the dawn of your lucidity
Our crescendo to the absence of time

Come with me to the edge of reality
And letâs evolve as one into infinity
Wonât you join us at the edge of reality
As we evolve as one

So can you tell me what it means to be human?
Can you tell me exactly why youâre alive?
Canât you feel the perfection?
Tell me you feel what we all have in common

Can you tell me what it means to be human?
Can you tell me exactly why youâre alive?
Canât you feel the perfection?
Tell me you feel what I feel inside

Break through the chain of self-judgment
Reconnect with your inner sight
Make your ripple in this ocean of memories
As you project your truth from the inside

Project your truth from the inside

The love
That lives through us all
Is only an intention away
One moment, one choice
What will you do with today?
