Hate is the only thing driving my heart
It fuels the fire and tears this world apart

I know Iâve gone back on my word
But lately this feels right
Thereâs too much disappointment held inside me tonight
My mind is learning to fight
And this time thereâs no fucking âmightâ
Iâm done with you, youâre out of my sight

You made me think that I lost my mind
After I searched for months there was nothing left to find
Youâve gone from hopeful to worthless
Set the bar at the ground
I gave you chances thinking one day you would come around

This is the tip of the fucking iceberg
And I think Iâve had enough

Iâve always wished the best but now Iâm wishing the worst
Burn in hell, I know youâll be there first

Youâre just a thief
Youâre a fucking disease
Think you can take what you want and just leave
Well you canât and Iâll teach you that
Iâm taking back whatâs mine,
Overthrowing you from where you sat

I know where I stand with people like you
Youâre always back and forth
Well now Iâm right here with the truth

This is the last time I put my heart before my head
Iâve pursued a life where dreams around me end up dead
My hope is in hoping everything will turn out fine
The last thing I need is to turn out like you

If I fall back on your name
Then death to me
Put a bullet in my brain

Where did you get your sense of entitlement?
And who the fuck put you on top?
