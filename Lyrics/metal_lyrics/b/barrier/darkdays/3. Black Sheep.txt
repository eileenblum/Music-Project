Stop asking the questions
If all I get back is rejection
If I hear that bullshit coming out of your mouth
Iâll fucking rip your teeth out, rip your teeth out

Mental, psychotic
I think Iâve finally lost it
You stab each othersâ backs in private
You deny it

The only way that I can still feel
Is to see the hate in my eyes is real
Your worldâs a living hell
This broken home is hectic
You close your eyes
Picture the perfect man
Hide in that lie
Hide in that lie

You said this house means give and take
But I feel like Iâve sold my soul for your sake

You watch my every move
Unaccepting of what I do
A leash chained to my throat
No slack so you can watch me choke

Iâm not meant to be yours
A fucking black sheep
knee deep in the pressure
of living in your dreams
How could I ever follow in your footsteps?
Iâm fucking drowning in the puddles that they left

The worst part is
My heartâs on my sleeve
And yours
Iâve yet to see
You want respect?
Then youâll give it back
I refuse to take these hits
Family doesnât work like that

You think itâs okay
To treat your flesh and blood this way
You think itâs okay
To treat your flesh and blood this way
