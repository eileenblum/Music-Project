I wish this heavy conscience
Would take a 15 minute break
So I could break the bones of those
that made the worst mistakes

Iâm sick of this heart
Thatâs letting you in
You heartless people with heartless friends
Youâve made your place in mine.
I didnât put you there.
Youâre not worth my time

I want to be on the other end
Making you break
Till I can see the awful person you turned out to be

Bleed through the seems
I found no glory
You bled through your seems
I found no fucking glory

Bleed through the seems
I found no glory

Fake, fake

I want to see you crawl back
I want to see you beg for me
Utter three simple words
Tell me youâre sorry

Weâre troubled youth
And Iâm learning to like it
Youâre troubled youth
So donât you dare fucking fight it

Fuck my worth
Iâm not worth a dime
Fuck what the world thinks
Theyâre not worth my time

My thoughts and my actions
Never amounted to shit
Iâm watching myself burn
And Iâm taking you with it

I want the hate in my heart to burn the fear in my veins
So I can pass on the pains of hell
To those whoâve only seen saints
