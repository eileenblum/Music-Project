Hope is a lost cause
My faith isnât real
Iâve lost sight in anything
I once held close to fear. Â 
My minds a mess
And this pain in my chest is killing me

I hate that I canât feel security in anything
And when it comes to me,
Itâs ripped out again

I live for you
Not for me or for my passions
Iâve tried to make a change
But the world is taking all my chances

Itâs taking my courage
Itâs taking my pride
My solid ground is now dirt
Thatâs been swept to the side

This isnât me
My path was straight
But you came in my life
And had it your way
You said "Fuck your passion
Fuck your skill
You live like me now
Forget you ever had free will"

You'll never get what youâve caused
The shit that fills my mind
You took my world
You took my fucking world

So sick of meeting your every demands
My body knows what it should do, what it should do
But I'm so use to this everyday struggle
This everyday struggle
This every day struggle to please you
This isnât me
