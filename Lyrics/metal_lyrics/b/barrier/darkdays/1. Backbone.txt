Demons have always made a home in my head
Lately theyâve found a place in friends instead
Demons have always found a place in my head
Lately theyâve found a place in friends instead

Dark days
Time to dig graves
Put them to rest before they do the same

Dark days, dark days
Put them to rest before they do the same
Last call, sick of it all
With this backbone, you wonât find me so small
