Iâm worn out and bitter
And I wonât consider
Keeping my head high
Cause every decent thought has gone
And left me out to dry
Iâm not in the best state of mind
But believe me when I say
Iâll never write a bullshit line

Abusers and users
The sinners, the saints
I am a product of you
For better or worse,
I canât really say
I just know this isnât what I was yesterday

30 days, itâs an easy sway
Thatâs all it really took for me to feel this way
Like everything was put on the line
and in a few weeks time it was ripped out of my hands

Iâm worn out and bitter
And I wonât consider
Keeping my head high
Cause every decent thought has gone
And left me out to dry
Iâm not in the best state of mind
But believe me when I say
Iâll never write a bullshit line

Youâre not a fucking familiar face
You donât belong here
You put my name in vain
Let me make it clear
I donât want you here
Youâre the outcast

Look at this man
With the blood on his hands
You beg forgiveness but how long will that last?
How long will that last?

Caught red-handed
A barron, a bandit
Why am I the only one that sees it?
Why am I the only one that sees it?
Everything dies in the end

And you canât learn that your back
Should never face your friends

Everything dies in the end
