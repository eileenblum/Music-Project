The man in the Shroud, spoke to the crowd,
And His name was hallowed...... Believer!
But now He is gone, no one to right our wrongs,
And He ain't coming back...... Deceiver!
Open your eyes, look up to the skies,
But He won't rescue us...... Dreamers!

[Chorus:]
Long ago, or so we are told,
We were subject to a visit,
From the stars, from afar,
Came our Fathers,
And in our dawn, it didn't take long,
Here they spawned...................US!

The Man in the Black, is on the attack,
Claws flash in the night...... Devil!
To buy our souls, needs a little gold,
But we are still paying...... Sinners!
To save our bodies, we cry to God,
Is He really up in Heaven...... Watcher!

[Chorus]
