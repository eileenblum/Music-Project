Heavy clouds hide the sun,
Crying people on the run,
Feel the heat, feel the pain,
Through the smoke and pouring rain,
Flames lick high, scorch the sky,
Time has come, it is done,
People near, feeling fear, it has come,
Man-made sun.

[Chorus:]
Inferno, Inferno, Inferno.

Fireball mushroom cloud,
Heat-wave heat over ground,
Wind of death, melt my eyes,
wall of sound drown my cries,
See my kind dropping there,
Feel the pain on the air,
Run from this I can,
Save myself to understand.

[Chorus]

Fireball mushroom cloud,
Heat-wave heat over ground,
Wind of death, melt my eyes, wall of
Sound drown my cries,
See my kind dropping there,
Feel their pain on the air,
Run from this if I can,
Save myself to understand.

[Chorus]

Fireball mushroom cloud,
Heat-wave heat over ground,
Feel the heat, feel the pain,
Through the smoke and pouring rain,
Wind of death, melt my eyes,
wall of sound drown my cries,
Run from this if I can,
Save myself to understand.

[Chorus]
