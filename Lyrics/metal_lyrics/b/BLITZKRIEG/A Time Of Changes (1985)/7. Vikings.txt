Viking, now the time is ripe for conquest,
Viking, now it's time for you to leave,
Take your Longship way across the water,
Just one more drink before you do.

Viking, now it's time to sail to new lands,
Viking, now it's time to put to sea,
Take your Longship way across the water,
Take your Longship away from me.

[Chorus:]
SHOUT, SHOUT, SHOUT to me, across the snow,
SING, SING, SING to me, all winter long,
Tell me tales of other lands that
I can never know
On your travels Viking, Go.

Viking, you'll be sailing on the Cruel Sea,
Viking, you'll feel lonely and so cold,
Fight with spirit on your quest of plunder,
Bring us back some amulets of gold

[Chorus]
