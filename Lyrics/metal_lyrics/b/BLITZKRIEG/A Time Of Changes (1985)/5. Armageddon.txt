Fire!

It's a holocaust coming from the East,
A great angry bird, spreading its word,
And we're gonna be its feast,
The sky will be red and the ground will shake,
The day of Judgement has come,
Armageddon has arrived.

[Chorus:]
Who will balance my life against yours?
Who will hold my soul in his hand?
Who will deliver me to the Devil?
Who can rid the Earth of this evil?

The World is in the bloody hands of Fate,
Warheads burn, they can't return,
The hour is too late,
The Sands of Time are running dry,
The bird is in full flight,
Armageddon has arrived.

[Chorus]

Marching, marching, off to war we go,
Leading, leading, our bloody seeds to sow,
Onward, onward, life is bloody fine,
Marching, marching,
We haven't got much time,
Atomic rain falls from the sky,
To wash blood from the land,

Frightened children are praying,
The sky is red with the Fires of Hell,
Destiny is stillborn,
Destiny is stillborn.

Frightened children,
They're scared to Hell,
They've heard the tolling of
The Great Black Bell,
They're so scared,
They're scared to Hell.

Frightened children,
They're scared to Hell,
They've heard that Satan has a tale to tell,
They're so scared,
They're scared to Hell.

Fire!
