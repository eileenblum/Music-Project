When will the changes occur?

When you see a cloud moving from the east,
You say rain is coming, and so it happens.
When the desert wind blows, you say it
Will be hot, and so it is. If you can read
The signs in the earth and the sky,
How is it that you cannot read the signs of The times?
The changes are occurring now!

Ask, and it shall be given you, seek and
You shall find, knock, and the door shall be
Opened to you.
Remember this:
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
Shall see God and be one with Him.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be
Called the children of God.

Blessed are the meek,
For they have had nothing,
The doors of the world,
Have been slammed in their faces,
Blessed are the lost,
For they shall know pain,
They're counting its cost again and again.

[Chorus:]
Changing world, the world is changing,
Changing world,
A Time of Changes...... For you and me.

Blessed are the old, for they shall know anger,
To know that their lives have counted for nothing,
Blessed are the young, for they shall be ready,
The world is changing in the way it was planned.

[Chorus]

I see an old man looking at how it used to be,
I see an old man crying and falling to his knees,
I see a young girl crawling, raped by the world,
Nobody ever hears me calling,
They never hear a word.

Blessed are the rich, for they shall own all,
Their inheritance shall be the riches of this world,
Blessed are the poor, for they shall know peace,
Their inheritance lies in the pastures of Heaven.

[Chorus]
