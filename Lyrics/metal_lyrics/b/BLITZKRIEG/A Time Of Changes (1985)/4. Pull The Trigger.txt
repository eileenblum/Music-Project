The night is out and the lights fade,
And I'm alone in the street,
Running round in a daze,
Don't know where I'm going,
There's nothing left to live for,
This life is killing me,
My mind is gone, I can't carry on anyway.

[Chorus:]
Time is running out, going fast,
How much longer can I fast?
I just don't care,
I can't take it anymore,
Pull the trigger,
Indulge in self-destruction.

Gazing out in the darkness,
Looking back on the past,
My life is draining away,
But there's no cure,
Lock away in my warped mind,
No-one can pull me out,
I've got to self-destruct,
That's the key to the door.

[Chorus]

Shoot it, shoot, shoot, blow my life away,

Gazing out in the darkness,
Looking into the black,
Staring straight down the barrel of a 45,
Loaded up and I'm ready,
I'm playing Russian Roulette,
The next time I pull the trigger,
I'll be dead or alive,

[Chorus]
