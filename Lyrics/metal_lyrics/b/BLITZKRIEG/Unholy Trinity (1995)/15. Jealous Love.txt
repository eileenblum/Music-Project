Your love it drive me crazy,
I'm knocking at your door,
You say that I've been cheating,
But I'm coming back for more.

You treat me like a fool,
I'm sick and tired of running after you,
But I just can't take no more of your foolish games,
I want your jealous love, I need your jealous love,
I want your jealous love, I need it, your jealous love.

You tell me that you love me,
Then you leave me all alone,
So I have myself a good time,
Did you think I'd take her home?

Oh girl you drive me crazy,
You're knocking on my door,
But I'm having such a good time,
I've just gotta have some more.
