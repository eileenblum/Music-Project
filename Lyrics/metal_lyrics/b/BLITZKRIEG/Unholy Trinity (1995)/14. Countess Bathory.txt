[originally by Venom]Welcoming the virgins fair, 
To live a Noble life, 
In the castle known to all,
The Count's infernal wife,
She invites the peasants with 
Endless lavish foods 
But when evening spreads it's wings, 
She rapes them of their blood.
Countess Bathory, Countess Bathory 

All day long the virgins sit, 
And feast on endless meals,
The Countess laughs and sips her wine,
Her skin doth crack and peel,
But when night-time fills the air,
One must pay the price,
The Countess takes her midnight bath,
In blood that once gave life.
Countess Bathory, Countess Bathory 

Living in her self-styled Hell, 
The Countess dressed in black, 
Life so distant, Death so near,
No blood to turn time back, 
Castle walls are closing in, 
She's crippled now with age 
Welcomes Death with open arms,
The Reaper turns the page. 
Countess Bathory, Countess Bathory
