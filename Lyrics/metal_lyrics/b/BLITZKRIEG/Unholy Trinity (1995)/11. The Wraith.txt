He knows that they'll be running,
He knows they're gonna try to hide,
They see his headlights coming,
Jamie's back from the "Other Side",
They don't know what's on his mind,
But he knows he's got to find,
The ones that cut his life away,
Appointment with Death,
Racing with The Wraith.

"Vengeance will be mine", he said,
He'll never rest until they're dead,
The Race of Death goes on and on,
They all will perish one by one,
They had a deadly sense of fun,
Packard's boys are on the run,
The Wraith knows he can make them pay,
Appointment with Death,
Racing with The Wraith.

He knew that they'd try running,
They couldn't find a place to hide,
The last thing they saw coming,
The Black Car from the "Other Side",
Ghostly in the setting sun,
Packard's boys no longer run,
The Wraith reclaims his life again,
Appointment with Death,
Racing with The Wraith.
