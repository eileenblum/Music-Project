Last time he pulled the trigger, he aimed it at himself,
Surgeons fought and saved him, hatred burns in his chest,
No more self-destruction, an assassin he would be,
Kill for the highest bidder, now he'll never be free.

Hold tight, take aim, shoot kill Hair Trigger.

Contacts signed and settled, a face without a name,
A pawn that's not a player, in this deadly game,
Arrangements made so perfect, no motive for the crime
A silent bullet takes a life, he's running out of time.

He stops and sees a window, reflecting his own face,
Maybe one last victim, he grows weary of the chase,
His victim gets a 'phone call, "Your killer's on his way",
The hunted now the hunter, blows his life away.
