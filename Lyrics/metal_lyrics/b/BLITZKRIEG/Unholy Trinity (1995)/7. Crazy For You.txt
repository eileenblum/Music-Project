I've got one eye raised to Heaven, the other seeking Hell,
The Devil's on my shoulder, and only time will tell,
I've found myself an Angel, you know I'm feeling mean,
But you know, you look so hot to me,
In your skin-tight leather jeans.

I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you,
I'm crazy, I'm crazy for you.

Your figure's full of promises, give me what I need,
Nod your head and shake those hips, I wanna feel your heat,
You tease me and you tempt me, with what I want to see,
Tight and black, like a heart attack,
Don't turn your back on me.
