It seems that we're so lucky, but is it what it seems?
Do you think that you can hold on to your dreams?
We're searching for the answer, but time is running out,
For the Children who will die in search of Truth,
We hear their voices calling, they scream across the sky.

And I'll find my Field of Dreams,
Where we all can stand as one,
We'll discover what it means to be each other.

They point at one another, and won't accept the blame,
Don't you think that we can reach out with our hearts?
We scan the skies for people, of another race and creed,
When we find them, will we call them Friend or Foe?
They hear our voices calling, will they come out of the sky?
