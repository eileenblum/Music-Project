Morpheus the Caretaker, Keeper of the Keys,
Cleaner of the schoolyard, all the children that he sees,
He gets the little schoolboys, with hatchet, blade and saw,
And cuts away their screams, until they scream no more,
Locks them in his cellar, and tears away their life,
Slices them to pieces, and cuts them with his knife.

He just can't take any more.

Caretaker - Heart Breaker,
Caretaker - Death Maker - Taking Care of Business.

Wickedness and hatefulness, were all his childhood dreams,
He searches for his Mother, and a home he'd never seen, 
A chainsaw is his best friend, a knife is by his side,
He'd become a weapon, where no young child could hide,
He's seeing them in nightmares, they're torturing his brain,
The dreaming of their dying cries, was driving him insane.

His mind is going crazy, it won't let these vision loose,
They found him in the basement, hanging from a noose,
They said that he was buried, they said that he was gone,
There's children going missing, something's going wrong,
They found a hand, an arm, a leg, left lying in a field,
Dug up his last resting place, and found his tomb unsealed.
