This sure ain't no tale of Beauty and The Beast,
All the weird things gather for the Great Cosmic Feast,
The Beast has been a savage for times long enough,
Man's decline was easy, the climb back is so tough.

Calming, calming the Savage Beast.

The Beast will try to destroy, all his eyes can see,
A living veil of shadow hangs over you and me,
There's a wheel in the sky all bathed in awful light,
Come to calm the Savage Beast, or perish in the fight.

Calming, calming the Savage Beast.

The simplest of progressions is turned to a weapon of war,
Each more frightening and horrible than the one before,
The Beast can't live in peace, with his troubled mind,
His threat hangs over Midgard, for killing his own kind.

Calming, calming the Savage Beast.

The Starman stands alone, His strongest passion is released,
This may be His last chance to calm the Savage Beast,
So live on with your Thought Dreams, survive now if you can,
Look towards your mirror, the Savage Beast is Man.

Calming, calming the Savage Beast.
