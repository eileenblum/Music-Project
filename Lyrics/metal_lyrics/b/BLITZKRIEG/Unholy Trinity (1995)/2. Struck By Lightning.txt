She sits in the darkness, the storm is near,
Under the stair-well, quaking with fear,
She waits for the thunder, to split the sky,
Will Mother be long now? Tears fills her eyes.

Shadows are haunting, lights on the floor,
The windows have shattered, she runs for the door,
Her eyes see the storm-clouds, she runs down the lane,
Siezed by the panic, drenched by the rain.

Sirens wailing and lights are flashing,
As she runs and screams in the night.

Struck by Lightning - on the run,
Struck by Lightning - all alone,
Struck by Lightning - away from home.
