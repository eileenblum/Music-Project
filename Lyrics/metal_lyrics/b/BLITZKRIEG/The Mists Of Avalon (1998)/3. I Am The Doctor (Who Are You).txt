I always dreamt of being a traveller,
In both space and time,
The machine I took, type 40 TARDIS,
Was destined to be mine.
Leave behind my fellow Time Lords,
Adventure calls, leave Gallifrey,
Put to use the things they taught me,
Freedom reigns, not what they say.

Davros built his Dalek army,
Made to conquer all.
And each time I came across them,
I beat them to the call.

Cybermen and Raston Robots,
The many foes I've had to face,
Like the Rani, and the Master,
Renegades, from my own race.

I am the Doctor (who are you?)

Imagination, exploration, regeneration,
Saved me time and time again.

Leave behind my fellow Time Lords,
Adventure calls, leave Gallifrey,
Put to use the things they taught me,
Freedom reigns, not what they say.

Cybermen and Raston Robots,
The many foes I've had to face,
Like the Rani, and the Master,
Renegades, from my own race.

I am the Doctor.
