Alice gave you his nightmare
And now you're welcome to mine
The spectral figure of sadness
Constantly travels through time
The guillotine will be falling
And so the heads will roll
The flames lick high in the furnace
Waiting to burn up your soul

And you!
You thought you'd seen it all
Your dreams begin to call
Can't take it any more
And you!
I see it in your eyes
I see through your disguise
Insanity and war

You think that you're all safe here
You say it's only a dream
Deep in my chamber of horrors
I know I'll make you scream
I'll stretch you right to your limit
We'll see the blood run red
Or will you live through this torment
Escape the night of the dead

And you!
You thought you'd seen it all
Your dreams begin to call
Can't take it any more
And you!
I see it in your eyes
I see through your disguise
Insanity and war

Something lurks in the shadows
It waits to steal your breath
Red eyes pierce through the darkness
They seek another death
Now I am Jack the Ripper
Under the gas lamp glow
No more Mister Nice Guy
I guess you'll never know

And you!
You thought you'd seen it all
Your dreams begin to call
Can't take it any more
And you!
I see it in your eyes
I see through your disguise
Insanity and war
