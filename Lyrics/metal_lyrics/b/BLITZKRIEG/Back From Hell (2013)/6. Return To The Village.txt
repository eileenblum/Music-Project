When I got home, I thought to myself, don't need to
run no more, but something told me, it wasn't right,
when I heard the sound of the door, It was then I knew,
that I must return, I knew I had to try,
I must Return to the village, and destroy it or die.

I'm back here in the village, it's time to burn it down.

There's no-one here, the village is mine, my
mind is playing tricks, I could leave, or choose
to stay, for I am number 6.

I've discovered why they brought me here
information was suppressed,
The decisions that are mine to make,
the button has been pressed, ignition sequence
ticking down, destruction all around!
There's nothing left of the village, I've razed it
to the ground. I'm standing in the village,
I've burnt the whole place down.
There's no-one here, the village is gone, no more
playing tricks, I could leave, I think I should, for
I am number 6. There's no-one here, the village is
gone, no more playing tricks,
I could leave, I think I will, for I am number 6.
Goodbye to the village, I'm a free man again.
