In ancient times, on the banks of the Nile,
Came the ship from a distant world,
The people were taken, as slaves for Ra,
Through the Stargate, to his world.
Stargate in Sahara!

Then rebellion came, and Ra lost control,
His Stargate buried under the sand, centuries
passed, before the Stargate was found,
And Dr. Jackson brought it to life.

They walked into Ra's world,
A world of gods and slaves.
They helped the people overthrow their gods,
Anubis and Horus were slain, And Ra could see,
it was the end of his reign, His people no
longer afraid

They had defeated Ra, explosions rocked the sky.
