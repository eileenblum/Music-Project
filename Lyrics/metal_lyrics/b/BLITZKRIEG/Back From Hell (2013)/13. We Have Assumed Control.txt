I watched as time was passing,
And let it slip away,
At first it all was fine,
Is it any wonder,
That it all went wrong,
They had taken what was mine.

Look at me, here I am,
I will take control.

It wasn't how it should be,
the hands ha all been played.
The knives twisting in the night,
The words of Truth are still there,
there for all to see,
But it didn't make it right.

Look at me, here I am,
I will take control.
Look at me, here I am,
We Have Assumed Control.

It couldn't go on like this,
Time to make a change,
See how the heads will roll,
A King in my own Kingdom,
The way it's meant to be,

I have seized control.
