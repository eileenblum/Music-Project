It's every day and it's every week,
Body's numb and I'm incomplete,
I'm counting fingers when my hands
are bound, well it's a complicated issue.
My disease of addiction, love spilt win,
Can you heal my persistence,
my disease of addiction.

Can't find my destiny to nowhere,
Hands cannot bleed for me no more,
Can you find destiny to somewhere,
Dreams do not sleep with me no more!

Another day and it's another week,
A life in pain on a tethered leash,
I got a feeling burning deep inside,
I know that something ain't right now.

Within the hour I'll be dead as yet,
I'm yet to live but I can't forged,
Still counting fingers while my hands
are bound, and it's a complicated issue.
