England needs a hero, in these
troubled times, I came to give you hope,
I stand against oppression, and the powers
that be, you guild will make you see.

You see me stand before you, I'm the man
behind the mask, my name is "V",
and you will fear me, I'll take you to Hell.

I took your freedom from you, I taught you
all you know, you had such high ideals,
Then returned it you you, and it made you
strong, your thoughts and mine, are one.

Beneath this mask is more than just flesh
and blood, beneath this mask is an idea,
And an idea cannot be killed by bullets!

My time is almost over, I'm lying here,
You know what you must do, This is my
final journey, and I'll take you there,
The flames light up the sky.
