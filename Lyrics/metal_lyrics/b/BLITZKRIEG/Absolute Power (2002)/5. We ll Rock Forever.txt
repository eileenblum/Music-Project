Hear my voice as we take control.
Raise your hands up higher,
tell me what you really want to hear.
Your world is turning upside down,
your hearts will burn like fire,
unite &amp; we have nothing left to fear.

We'll rock together We'll rock forever

It's up to you,let your voice be heard,
don't suffer in silence.
Let the world feel what's in your hearts,
if we can change one man's point of view,
by showing our alliance,
at least we know we have done our part.

We'll rock together We'll rock forever
Together we will rock forever,metal in our hearts.
