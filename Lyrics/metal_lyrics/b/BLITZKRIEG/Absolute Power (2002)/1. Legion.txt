On the horizon,the bodies are rising again,
to take the unwilling.it's all senseless killing &amp; pain,
The fires are burning,the tide is turning on war,
louder than thunder,was Earth torn asunder before.

Bodies lie broken,the gods they have spoken so loud,
lost in their causes,an army of corpses,heads bowed.
Undead &amp; tenacious,they fill up spaces so well,
no quarter is given,the meaning is hidden in hell.

We are legion,for we are many.

Racing with demons,Hell's unholy legions are here.
Torture eternal from creature infernal spread fear.
The ending of nations a dark revelation is born.
To rot &amp; decay,as the world slips away,no dawn.
