In the night the world is changing,
do we know who seized control ?
Their lives are planned,there's no tomorrows,
memories are held in dreams.

Do they know that I remember ?
In the crowd but all alone.
I stand &amp; watch the changing skyline,
oppressors crushed,they're now aware.

Beneath a steel sky, no - ones asking why,
no one sees a new tomorrow.
The watchers in the park,the demons of the dark.
Who beg steal or borrow ?

I need to find a childhood memory,
leave behind the distant shore.
I find the door in the horizon,
a world contained inside a shell.
