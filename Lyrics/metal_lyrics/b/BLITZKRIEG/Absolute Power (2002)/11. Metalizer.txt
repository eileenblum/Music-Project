When it's time to rock,is there total shock ?
You'll be taken by surprise.What's it all about ?
You can scream &amp; shout,
like a shot between the eyes.

Racing out of time,I'll get inside your mind,
just to mentalize your brain.lying on the floor,
can't take it anymore,
get the priest to kill the pain.

Metal gods don't spare the rods,
the dance of death is just for fools.
Sin after sin,let the show begin,
the metalizer breaks the rules.

Metalizer brings you down

It's the final countdown,to the metal meltdown.
Metalizer brings you down.
