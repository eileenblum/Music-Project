Engines screaming give me more,
electrifying thunder roar.
Breakneck speed &amp; sonic bound,
blazing on to glory.

Electric eye it cannot see,
I'm running wild I'm running free.
High octane powered neon knights,
are in the terror zone tonight.

Highway madness through the night,
locked on target raise my sights.
Stainless steel begins to glow,blazing on to glory.

Mesmerizing full on speed,
gives me all of what I need,
dragging knees down on the floor,
blazing on to glory.
