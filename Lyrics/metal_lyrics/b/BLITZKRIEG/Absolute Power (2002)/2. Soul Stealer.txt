I am the one who makes the noise in the night,
When you're all alone, there's no-one there to make it right.
I'm in your nightmares and I'm tearing up your dreams.
I'm seen in fleeting glances when nothing's what it seems.

Hiding in the darkness, I am your fear.

I am the ghost of shadows, the demon in your head,
I am the entity that hides beneath your bed.
You can see the branches casting shadows on the wall,
you cannot cry for help, struck dumb you cannot call.

Hiding in the darkness, I am your fear.

Each night you know I'm there, don't want to be alone,
pure evils waiting there,
You sense me near, I am your fear.
Choking your dreams in the darkness,
your blood runs cold, I'll steal your soul,
all of your dreams are filled with madness.

Now that you have grown older, you think I'll let you be,
deep in your mind you know I will never set you free.
One day I will return, to hunt you once again,
I'll steal your childrens souls and make you go insane.

Hiding in the darkness, I am your fear.
