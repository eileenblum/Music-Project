I, I forget my own rules
But I still know the end of the story

What's happened to the world, what's happened to my life?
There was a time I felt safe from the drossiness
Safe from discomfort

No enemies, no lies
Where is my soul?
Where are my ways, where is my heart?
Over years it made me weak
It made me weak (it made me unpredictable)

Something came across my way
It changed too many things inside me (inside me, inside)
Inside me
Over years it made me weak
I saw your smile
Everything around me seems to glow, but everything I touch goes out (goes out)

I hold your hand, feel your breath, see your smile
I took this gift from life
Not knowing what awaits me

Where is my soul?
Where are my ways, where is my heart?
Over years it made me weak, it made me weak

Another step in an unknown direction
How can I be sure, oh how can I be sure?
Days go by, it seems to grow (it seems to grow)
It feels still right where I am
I can't see you anymore, feel you anymore
These voices are pushing me
They want me to fail (they want me to fail)
I am falling
Nothing to lose, nothing to win
How could I be sure?
Why so sure, why so sure?
