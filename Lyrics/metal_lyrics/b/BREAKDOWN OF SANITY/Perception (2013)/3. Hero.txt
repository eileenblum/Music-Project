It is the darkest night, stars invisible
The only thing I can feel is your cold fear
Your shivering hands, controlling gaze
Fearing the end, awaiting the consequences
As long as you are walking this path (this path)
In fact you don't have to fear the fog my friends
And I see, you already know the other side
You know the way out

But the cruel end is etched in your thoughts

Your fantasy, only able to envision the worst
You dream of a hero
Helping hand
Brave guardian

When you wake up you wish to wake up again
Leaving this place is what you secretly hope for

But in reality you can't run away
In the end the past will catch you all up
It's not the case that you weren't responsible

Take a look at this world
Drab and reeking
Look at the dull seas
Almost dead inside
Look at the toxic sky

We and the sun, no longer friends

Now there's no more excuses for walking this path
No more chances for the fucking blind
All this is making you sad
All this is making you scared
You can't deny

The hero is close, he can save you

He's close to you, so close to you

Reach out your hand, open your eyes

What made you not change your mind for so long?

That's right, the hero is you
