I hope there is an end of this story, fuck

Everywhere I go, every time I sleep
I go around in the circle
Again and again, on my way
To a better life, with a free heart
A carefree mind
It's joining me through time and distance
Like my fucking shadow

Invisible scars, caused by myself
So deep, deep inside me
I played with the fire in my heart

It has finally caught me

They told me
It's time for change
The beauty enticed me
To risk so many mistakes
Why not, why not?
The signs were clear
The clouds were here
Who knows? who knows? Maybe they're still right
Maybe there will be rain again

Maybe I can forget, to forget the sadness
Just another aberration?
Just a delusion?

So here we go, so here we go
Round 3, and I'm doubtful again
The shadow of the past so dark
Making my life look empty
I hope there is an end of this story

Every night I dream of the love I lived twice

Every morning I wake up with memories of things that never happened

Alone in the crowd, maybe already forgotten

I see the time is working against me
I guess I can't stop this
Because it's stronger than me
Impossible to learn the lesson
As long as my heart won't listen
As long as my heart won't listen

The circle holds me back, I am strapped down

Waiting for the day I can break through

The moment I can catch up all the love
Waiting for the day
You aren't just a dream, no!

(Ready? Go!)
