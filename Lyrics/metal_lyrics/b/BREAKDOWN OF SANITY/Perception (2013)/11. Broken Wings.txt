The fetters are loose now but the reddened wrists will be visible forever
I was standing on the edge
I've lost almost my spirit, my path

Something died inside me
I didn't recognize myself
When I was looking in the mirror
Something has grown inside me

What have I become?

I acted too late
I should have seen it
But I've gone blind more and more

I've just heard this ticking in my head

I will never feel safe anymore, nowhere

Nothing will ever gonna be the same again, nothing

Nothing will ever gonna be the same again, nowhere
I will never feel safe anymore, nothing
Nothing will ever gonna be the same again, nowhere
I will never feel safe anymore, nothing

The surface won't be reg-rinded anymore
Now I've to conceal my scars which I'm trying to heal
I felt to cry, I cried to feel

What a waste, what a disappointment

All the things you never appreciated

Like a leech on my neck, you took my energy (my energy)
The wings are broken
The roses are black
The wings are broken
The roses are black

The pictures remind only of days of lightness
No one can change it
No one to blame
Just forgive, just forget (just forgive, just forget)

In spite of all this I refuse to give up
I refuse to give up, I won't give up

In spite of all this I refuse to give up
(I won't give up) I refuse to give up
(I won't give up, I won't give up)
