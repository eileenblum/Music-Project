Today my awakening was different
I'm dazzled by the hidden truth

It woke me up

With sharp screams, it shook me up
Is it already too late
Was this the last of our fights?
Maybe just a dream

It shines so fucking bright
Tears roll out of my squinted eyes
This is the cold fire burning down my little hope

I get up, I walk down the street again
But today I'm just the observer
Now I am the seeing, watching all the zombies
I am scared by, by their ashamed glances

Their empty faces with these glossy eyes
Trying to evade my assessment

I see them dying within, lost on the way
Not ready to pay
I walk along
No one holds me back
No one blocks my path
No one holds me back
No one blocks my path
No one holds me back
No one blocks my path

It shines so fucking bright
Tears roll out of my squinted eyes
This is the cold fire burning down my little hope

I can read their minds
They have lost their goals
Lost their dreams, lost their selves
They don't know what they are searching for now

Now they feel the consequences of their stiffened way of life
Caged in their own prison of lies
Focused on the fading things (fading things)
Now the safety falls to dust (it falls to dust)
What is the use of all the money now?
Can you remember your decision, your decision?

I watch 'em pay the price for being blind
For being so narrow-minded
The final question is:
What if this was just a dream?
Was it just a dream?
You blind motherfuckers
Was it just a dream?
You blind motherfuckers
