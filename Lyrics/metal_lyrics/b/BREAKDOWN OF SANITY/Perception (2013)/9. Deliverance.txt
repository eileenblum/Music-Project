It was a long way, it took a long time to find a safety like this
It took a long time to find a safety like this

I was almost giving up all my hope
But in the end the picture in my head surpassed my expectations
Expectations
My expectations

A world so perfect, a world so fucking flawless
The search has an end
I don't need anything else other than this place
A place where I belong
Nothing is grey, even the dark clouds
Above me shine bright

The ocean so deep, my spirit above (my spirit above)
No more questions, only answers
I take a deep breath, close my eyes
A deep breath, close my eyes

Reach out my hand and try to stop the time
To feel the perfection for longer

The warm, pleasant sunbeams on my face
The sand between my toes and the breeze in my hair
No one can take this moment away from me
Away from me
Away from me (away from me)
Away from me (away from me)
Away from me

Please, oh please don't take me away from this place
Please don't wake me up
Please don't wake me up
Please don't wake me up from the place where I belong
Where I belong
