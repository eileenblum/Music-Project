Another sleepless night
Time stands still
Minutes seem like hours
Hours like days

I take a deep breath
Open my eyes and clench my hand into a fist
All these nightmares, they hunt me for real

Running away is futile
Standing still is fatal
Running away is futile
Standing still is fatal

Was it our fault?
We knew we could fail
Can't distinguish between sweat and blood anymore
Was it our fault?
We knew we could fail

I feel numb from drinking our tears
But when I remember your smile
I know I have to face, to face all this fear
All this fear

I enter your room
Close the door, smell your perfume
It hurts like an open sore
Which will bleed forever
Forever

Was it me, that ended our dreams?

Somebody please cut me out of this twisted picture
I'm floating in memories
They feel like fractures reflecting on everything
Since you disappeared

If there's one moment you can choose your fate
Why didn't we grow in love
Instead of ending up in a fucking fight?
Oh god, why?
Tell me why?

I feel numb from drinking our tears
But when I remember your smile
I know I have to face, to face all this fear
All this fear

I enter your room
Close the door, smell your perfume
It hurts like an open sore
Which will bleed forever
(Forever, forever, forever)

You took the keys, started the car
Drove into nowhere, with my heart
Now it all falls apart
Now it all falls apart
Now it all falls apart
Now it all falls apart

I enter your room
Close the door
Whisper your name
Another sleepless night
Time stands still
Minutes seem like hours
Hours like days

[Female voice:]
In a time when less is more
Where too much is never enough
There is always hope for the future
The future can be read from the past
The past foreshadows the present
And the present hasn't been written yet

It, it was our fault
We knew we could fail
It, it was our fault
We knew we could fail
