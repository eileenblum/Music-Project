Looking back on my footsteps on the cold ground
Feeling like fleeing
They say the path I took should be my fate
But I wanna take my lazy steps on my own
Day by day, second by second, I set the course anew

Walking through the frames of my life
Looking for the moments I'll remember with a smile
Tripping over lies and hate
Envy and vanity
I wish I could change the order of proceedings
No chance at all
No chance at all

I build a time machine
I will reverse my mistakes, pain - fade away
Fade away
Fade away

All these sources of noise are whispering and screaming
Tempting and frightening in the middle of my head, beyond my heart

They try to change my mind into something bad
Fighting against them for years
But in the end I still decide on my own

Fearing the mistakes
Fearing the responsibility
To myself and to my beloved, to my beloved

Walking through the frames of my life
Looking for the moments I'll remember with a smile
Tripping over lies and hate
Envy and vanity
I wish I could change the order of proceedings

These photos, can't overlook (can't overlook)
The flashlights, they are surrounding me

Observing all my movements
But finally it's me who's crying for my perfect sincerity
Crying for my salvation
Crying for the respect for myself

So where is the golden means of all decisions?
I don't even know
If there is a right way I could choose

I go down on my knees, I'm yelling at the ground
In the hope of finding some new answers

Thousands of questions
Only one life for finding answers
One question for thousands of lives
For thousands of lives

Breathing slowly

Despite this I never stopped believing in
Waiting for the point I can see it clearly
