I was falling for a long time
Almost everything I knew became more fucking worthless

So many promises, so much energy

All I want is silence
All I want is peace
All I want is you
No more reason for searching
For what I always expected from life
(No more reason for searching)

New direction, new fuckin' rules

You caught me on my way to my new life

I think it's time to act selfishly
You, yeah you caught me on my way to my new life
To my new life

Memories of a time before distrust and pain

Perhaps a dream, perhaps a trap

But not this time, it's too different
My pulse is slowing, is slowing down
My eyes are closed now

And I create
And I create a picture in my head
A picture of the time
I draw it with my mind
It's colourful and bright
It's no longer waiting, from today it's arriving

This time I can see the sky
The first time I don't look back
(What the fuck)

No more walls, no more lies
I can breathe until after the sundown
My glowing heart just awakened
Perfection within reach

My sad memories
You make them look like fading dust
I am the air
I am the ground, nothing can burn me down
Nothing can burn me down
Nothing

I really missed this feeling
Now I don't fear myself anymore
Open mind, open ways
My future turns to light
Hope has come to find me

My real destination
This is the control I was waiting for
It makes me unbreakable
I remember who I am
What I was, what I've become
