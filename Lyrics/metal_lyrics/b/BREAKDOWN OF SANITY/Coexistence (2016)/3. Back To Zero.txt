[feat. Ryo Kinoshita of Crystal Lake]face the truth, we are surrounded by lies this ship will sink, never sleep
with closed eyes don't follow those voices a little closer to the ground
pieces are falling and they will never be found my belief breaks into a
thousand shards
I will refuse to face defeat nobody wants to face the truth the moment has
come to turn the page they said you have to swallow your pride and learn
to adapt but I'm unwilling to be one of those who just sits back in the
dark, fuck I'll take back what was mine
broken reality falls down on me, the world is my enemy am I the only one
who can see through the mask? I envy your calm, can't you see the
hurricane? no time for reproaches, I warned you again and again where do
we want to belong to now? write your name on your lifeboat and follow the
lifeline escape the squall for the last time
we'd rather live one day in this selfish world as a wounded lion than a
hundred years as a controlled sheep leave this shit behind, no time to
sleep we climb this wall, no fears to fall we won't give this shit up till
we reach the top I promise it will be the brightest spot this is our
target
we never stop, we never forfeit, I can not abort it no exception to permit
just look into my eyes, they're reflecting your fear from the past few
years but this is not the end no, this is not the end believe me or not
but this right here is not the end
take your place, it's time to move give me a knife for those ropes give me
something to break these chains give me the command to bring the ship back
on course again
back to zero escape the fate, it's time to chose take your place, it's
time to move
back to zero escape the fate, it's time to chose rewind the past, you must
approve
raise your fist, this is your last chance we won't turn away and turn
black back to grey
and I'm sure someday the colours will visibly gleam again
