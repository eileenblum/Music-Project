the sun sets, reality becomes tactile the bitter taste of life is killing
the smile on my face shaken up by reality but never give up no matter how
hard it will be
there's no way to escape, there is no shortcut all of sudden everything
changes and from now on every breath feels so strange a stab in the back
without warning fall asleep and hope all is forgotten in the morning
I'm paralyzed I close my eyes and try to set the time back
I just want to fall into a deep sleep wake up and realize that everything
was just a nightmare somebody take this away from me
these cursed ups and downs this mental pressure, sometimes hope drowns how
long does it still take till the chains around my neck break
broken mirrors â I can't see the reality clearly millions of sharp pieces
are starring at me
please, I can't bear to see you fall again but I know you'll never give up
never!
