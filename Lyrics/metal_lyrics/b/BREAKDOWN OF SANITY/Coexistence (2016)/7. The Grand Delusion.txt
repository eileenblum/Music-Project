breath in, breath out without a sound keep breathing, day in day out speak
up, shout out, somebody will hear you no matter what, I'm going through -
with or without you
sometimes this world resembles a dead garden without blooms a park full of
barren trees or like a song without melody a laugh without a sound and
sleep without dreams shadows without sun or a sky without any shining
stars this world is a fire without heat can you here the clock?
a life without dreams you won't find another world other than this one
you consume what they urge you to guided by the masses brainwash, no ifs,
no buts everything makes sense to you it leaves deep scars behind but no
matter what â keep breathing, day in day out
speak up, shout out, somebody will hear you no matter what, I'm going
through â with or without you
everything is delusion I step outside, close the door and even at this
time I feel boxed in everything is delusion, trust in nothing escape as
long as you can the fire without heat, the life without dreams
