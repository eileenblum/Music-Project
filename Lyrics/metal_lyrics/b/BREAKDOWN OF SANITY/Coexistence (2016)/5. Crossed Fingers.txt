[feat. BjÃ¶rn Krebs of A Small District]living day by day with remorse but I try to push it to the back of my mind
my hands are shaking, I can't resist no more, I can't fight back brick by
brick, step by step, stick by stick look at me, what have I become? from
time to time I feel like everything in me is dead do you know what it's
like to sleep forever endless thoughts, blinded by drugs, numb the pain,
it never stops
I say it's the last time and cross my fingers behind my back for myself no
regrets for a long time and all my habits will come back
lift my glass to the end of the past back to the start because time runs
too fast forcing myself to breath I see myself but it's not really me my
enemy is me lie to myself, hope everyday again that I lose my self-produced
pain I try to leave this cage inside and refuse to listen to the voice in
my head
got to lose my craving (for more) I need to get out of this
forever bound, forever in chains I have to live forever with this shadow
on my face
it was never gone and I guess it will never go away I can't decide which
way to take to find my bliss there's no light I can follow, no god I can
believe in please help me out of this I take my last hit before I get sick
please help me out of this
I say it's the last time and cross my fingers behind my back for myself no
regrets for a long time and all my habits will come back tear me down and
let me drown
tomorrow (I promise) I'll break up but only tomorrow I don't want to chase
the dark clouds anymore break free
I try to escape from this cage and turn the next page I walked these cold
streets all by myself, so the last steps I'll cope under my own steam no
dreams at night only daydreams
I tried to hide it from the ones I love but I can't pretend anymore, I
can't hide anymore
break free
