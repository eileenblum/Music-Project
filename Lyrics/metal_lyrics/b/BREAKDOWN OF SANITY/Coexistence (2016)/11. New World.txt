I step into a world a world I have never seen before where the haunt is
bagged and love is the core
warm lights surrounding my unfrozen mind time is standing still for a
blink of an eye I'm no longer a slave of the human kind my deepest fears
seem to have lapsed my enemies, antagonists, already collapsed now it
feels like the biggest fight has been won in this life but who's able to
follow me over the edge of the knife?
imaginary land please be real, I don't want to leave you anymore so please
be sealed keep that burning door locked forever
I need to save the new essence let me breathe in the smell of hope until
my disappearance this is the new freedom called peace pick up the trail
and follow me, away from the worlds disease
this is the place for those who don't give up the final destination beyond
selfishness and every spiteful act I see your laughing face full of
salvation, but wait, there is something more suddenly I'm in a fight
against the question like a spike in my mind, unable to ignore
searching for a reason I can't find what am I even looking for? only one
black thought and my knees are shaking I can feel my heartbeat, hear my
heart scream the gloomy sounds of a tremor makes me breathless like a
wicked hand, it's on my neck
trying to suppress my peace of mind the lights turn green and I watch
reality thrive what the hell is happening, this place can't break I need
to stay but I can't hide billows of smoke breaking through the ground I'm
falling but I don't want to be crawling out of my skin the sad reality is
catching up with me
this is the awakening


Thanks to leonhard for correcting track #10 lyrics.
