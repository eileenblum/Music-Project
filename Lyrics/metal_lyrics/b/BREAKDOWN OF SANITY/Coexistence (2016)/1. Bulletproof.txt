locked up behind these walls ages of trying to cope
behind December's walls years and years of finding myself this was the
longest journey I've ever made days of wasting tears and no one cares
countless nights, drowning in worthless nightmares ages of trying to cope
ages of not giving up hope
keeping alive the hope for a deeper sense, for a better understanding of
my world, my destiny, my goals and myself climbing out of that endless
misery, no security, no confirmation of an end alone in the masses
is there anybody on my side? please appear now I feel myself slowly
crumbling and when the rain is coming I can feel myself melting into the
ground becoming the puppet I never meant to be
I don't know how, I don't know why, so sure I don't deserve this but there
came an eastern wind that brought me forward, pushed me out of the sludge
formed my actual self, buried my inner demons locked up behind December's
walls
the rain can't force me down anymore I'm strong enough to hold back the
storms now seeing my visions clear like never before from that day I met
you
for what you are, for what you saw in me now I can see clearly all the
wrong paths I took the prospect is perfect from the roof I see down the
walls I am bulletproof
and if the vultures are ever circling above me again you can be sure I
won't let you go because I know you can still feel my passion strengthened
by the scars I've collected in the past I will move heaven and earth to
save this because I'm bulletproof
