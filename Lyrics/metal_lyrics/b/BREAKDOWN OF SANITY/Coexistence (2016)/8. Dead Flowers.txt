the frames are blank and the flowers are fuckin' dead I'm drowning in
thoughts, the time has come once again overslept the whole day, still
lying on my bed and weltering back and forth thousands of thoughts whiz
around in my head it's hard to explain what's still growing in me
just look into my eyes for the last time the time has come for me to rise
my mind was covered by shadows dark forces have pulled me away for too
long the half life I follow on this railroad line but my train has left
the station for a long time I just wanted to wake up from this nightmare
but there was no way to turn the page
issues, fears of loss, paranoia, jealousy at some point I just wanted to
run, to run away but you didn't want to face what we have become can you
see what you've done to me and to yourself? dead slowly I can recognize
myself in the mirror again
tonight I try to forget the frames are blank and the flowers are fuckin'
dead it's my life now I take it back
I was waiting for the problems to solve themselves too weak to resist the
fight against you and myself the more I've searched the less I've found
this is the last time that you drag me back down
fragments of dreams half asleep, nothing is what it seems you let me down,
you let me drown I'm never looking back again, you got that?
I was just a mask with a crooked smile you tried to control me for quite a
while I was on the ropes for too long nothing left but a bitter taste on
my tongue but now I know how to hide the scars the time has come for me to
rise again
