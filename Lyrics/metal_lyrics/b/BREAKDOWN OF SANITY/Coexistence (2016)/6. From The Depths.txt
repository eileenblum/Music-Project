hey you I know that you hear me, I know that you feel me, no chance to set
you free I know that you fear me and that you can't see me I know all your
diary stories and all your dirty secrets that you can't hide I know that
you know me, but you can't tell anyone
you can't locate me anymore the idea of innocence is ridiculous, just
steer away from these recurring thoughts you are a liar, you are a
masquerader maybe you can mislead your environment maybe you can convince
your friends and enemies
just smile and go away, just cry and hate yourself but you can never
deceive me I can feel that you are trying to deny my existence
when you are fighting against your ego and your misgivings there is no one
who could help you, no one who would believe you when we would appear
together, enrage united forgetting what's right or wrong, what's laudable
or vile too many stories untold, too many facts unrecognized
it's already enough never try to deceive me and now you can feel me
clearly never try to deceive me
now you can learn to accept my terrifying antic this is truly the end,
this is cruelly the truth but I do as I always did, because you are I, and
I am you we're coming from the depths
