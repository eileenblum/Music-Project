In goes the knife
Twisting with rage
Quicksand chains
Rattling the cage

Everywhere you go you know Iâm out there
Tormentor
Every face you see it will be me

Eternal Tormentor
Eternal Tormentor
Eternal Tormentor, Mentor

Now theyâre poised behind barbwire fence
Shadows of their former selves
Tiny little sunken skulls

Everywhere you go you know Iâm out there
Tormentor
Every face you see it will be me

Eternal Tormentor
Eternal Tormentor
Eternal Tormentor, Mentor

Take a look inside my head
Understand the way I am
Find out why you hate me
Understand the way I hate you

So analyze this
Iâm coming to take whatâs mine
My prescription is this

Building an empire and tearing it down
Youâll not survived this cult
Tiny weak vengeful lulls

Everywhere you go you know Iâm out there
Tormentor
Every face you see it will be me

Eternal Tormentor
Eternal Tormentor
Eternal Tormentor, Mentor

I am the one swinging the hammer
Driving the nail
Iâm gonna swing the judgment hammer
âTil your systems fail, fail, fail
