Hold on to your balls and kiss your ass goodbye
Youâve awakened the sleeping giant
Look up and cry
Detonation of mega tons coming down your way
Decimation of your town
Just when you thought it was safe to come out

Heat seek deliverance
No interception
Path of destruction
Destroy, destroy
Dishing our violence
Lessons in force
Mass devastation
Destroy, destroy

Dog whipped to the ground
The iron hand comes down
Punished beyond belief, deafened by the sound
Burned up, walls of fire, unleashing the hate
Decimation of your town
Just when you thought it was safe to come out

Heat seek deliverance
No interception
Path of destruction
Destroy, destroy
Dishing our violence
Lessons in force
Mass devastation
Destroy, destroy

Heat seek deliverance
No interception
Path of destruction
Destroy, destroy
Dishing our violence
Lessons in force
Mass devastation
Destroy, destroy
