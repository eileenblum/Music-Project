I look into your crystal ball
I see your world is dying
The one that you destroyed
Loved the ones you left here crying
You deserve the right to kill yourself
You bruised the priestess angel
Now youâll burn in hell, now youâll burn in hell

Destitute abuser
Diabolic ways
Beaten down and used her
Bringer of your rage

Who gave you the right to play God?
You bruised the priestess angel
You spilled sacred blood
The ones you left behind suffer in silence
Heavy cross to drag around
Remnants of your violence
Remnants of your violence

Destitute abuser
Diabolic ways
Beaten down and used her
Bringer of your rage

You killed the priest before last rites
Abused the priestess night after night
You killed your world before it could breathe
Destitute abuser bleed, destitute abuser bleed
Destitute abuser bleed

I look into your crystal ball
I see your world is dying
The one that you destroyed
Loved the ones you left here crying
You deserve the right to kill yourself
You bruised the priestess angel
Now youâll burn in hell, now youâll burn in hell

Destitute abuser
Diabolic ways
Beaten down and used her
Bringer of your rage
Destitute abuser, destitute abuser
Destitute abuser bleed, destitute abuser bleed
