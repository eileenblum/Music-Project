Incinerations coming in redemptions throttle flame
Iâm going to burn
Penance for past sins for all inflicted pain
Iâm going to burn

Shot down in flames
Blazing fire attack
I am not your leader donât follow turn back
I am not your saviour, Iâll turn your soul
Jet Black, Jet Black

Marinade in my own fuel
Scorching in a world so cruel
I am not your saviour, Iâll turn your soul
Jet Black

Hit by the hammer
Accelerate the gas
I am no dictator save yourself, run fast
I am not your saviour, Iâll turn your soul
Jet Black

Marinade in my own fuel
Scorching in a world so cruel
I am not your saviour, Iâll turn your soul
Jet Black

Follow me into the furnace
Dead man burning
Until you step into my fire,
Youâll never know the way we feel
Can you feel it, can you feel the way we feel
We are black and burning,
Can you feel the way we feel
We are burning, Jet Black, Burn

Marinade in my own fuel
Scorching in a world so cruel
I am not your saviour, Iâll turn your soul
Jet Black

Incinerations coming in redemptions throttle flame
Iâm going to burn
I am not your saviour, I am not your saviour
