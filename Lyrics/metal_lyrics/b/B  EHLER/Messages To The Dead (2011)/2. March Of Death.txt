I hope your God is watching you
As you cross into my land
Get in line
Feel the iron hand

March of death
You are in
March of death
Now begins
You will die
Even if you live
March of death

Marching under crimson skies
Days turn black through sleepless nights
Move or die
Genocide

March of death
You are in
March of death
Now begins
You will die
Even if you live
March of death

Prayinâ to your God
For redemption of your soul
Layinâ down the law
Layin' down my evil law
You better obey
Hear me! Fear me!
Creator save us all
Creator save us all
Creator save us all
Creator save us all
From the march of death
