Call for the priest
Thereâs going to be hell to pay
The birth of organized mayhem is today

Die for each other
We lie for each other
We kill for each other
We go to hell together
Try for each other
We lie for each other
Die for each other
Organized mayhem
Welcome to the brotherhood

The maiden never sleeps
The slayers are gonna slay
The birth of organized mayhem is today

Die for each other
We lie for each other
We kill for each other
We go to hell together
Try for each other
We lie for each other
Die for each other
Organized mayhem
Welcome to the brotherhood

Stand up and fight for the brotherhood
The violent force of the brotherhood
The iron dogs of the brotherhood
We are the brotherhood of metal
