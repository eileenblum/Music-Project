Iâm hanging my head into the dead zone
Banging my head against the headstone
I bleed

No one hears my warning
No one listens up
No one hears my cries
No one gives a fuck

Iâm hanging my head into the dead zone
Banging my head against the headstone

6 feet under, 6 feet down
6 foot hole in sacred ground
6 feet under, 6 foot cross
6 foot box left to rot

Iâm hanging my head into the dead zone
Banging my head against the headstone
Headstone

The other side sees
The dead can still hear
They control your fears
They listen to us when no one else will
They control us still
Listen to me! Listen to me!

Now Iâm sending never ending messages to the dead
Messages to the dead
Messages to the dead now listen!

Now Iâm sending never ending messages to the dead
Messages to the dead
Messages to the dead

My evil is now
Itâs the message Iâm sending,
Do you like what youâre hearing?
My evil is now
Headstone blood red messages to the dead
