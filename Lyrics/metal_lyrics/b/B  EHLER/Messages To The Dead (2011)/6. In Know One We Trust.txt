Keep your mouth shut
Watch the double edged sword
Trust no one
Fuck the world

Behind every door thereâs a loaded gun
Above every hole thereâs a rope
Fast growing hatred towards the human race
Around every corner both barrels wait to take me out

If you wanna wreck me
Iâll sign in blood in no one we trust
If you wanna cross me
The blood will be yours in no one we trust
In no one we

Keep the hammer down
Never lose a race
Die tryinâ
Say it to my face Iâll piss on your grave

Never turn your back on a would be rat
Fear no one everyone sets a trap
Every day above ground gets harder to defend
Every day alive Iâm already dead still walking

If you wanna wreck me
Iâll sign in blood in no one we trust
If you wanna cross me
The blood will be yours in no one we trust
In no one we

Every door around me is a black hole to my death
Gun loaded hammer falls
No regrets, left for dead, full of lead,
Completely out of my head

Violent cold sweat nights
Never close my eyes
Everything is lies
Trust and you will die,
In no one we trust and you will die
In no one we trust and you will die
In no one we

If you wanna wreck me
And drain my blood, in no one we trust
If you wanna cross me, invert the cross
The blood will be yours in no one we trust
