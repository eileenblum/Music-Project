[Music: Geraldo, Leandro and Marcelo, Lyrics: Leandro]

From my eyes are falling tears, cause I'm lost somewhere
I don't have my love to hold my hands
In my heart there's pain, cause I changed my fate
I wanted to live in a fairy tale and dream awayâ¦

[Bridge:]
Flying high through the skies like eagles fly
I'm dying each night and I can't look in your eyesâ¦

[Chorus:]
It's time to find the love of my life
I lost her in the past but she remains in my mind
When I was child I used to dream of her in my arms
I don't lose my hope we'll stay together forever

Long time that I don't see you and many things changed
But my feelings are the same and I never lose my faith
Someday I will find you and together we'll stay
I look at the moon and the sun to remember your face

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

We'll stay together forever
