[Music: Geraldo Aita and Marcelo, Lyrics: Leandro]

I remember a child crying in the night
Her tribe had died in front of her eyes

Shouts for help, sounded from a little Indian voice
She felt cold and fear

In that night the forest heard her voice but nobody wanted to help her
She was alone looking at the sky waiting for salvation, save her

[Chorus:]
She tried to cry (SHE TRIED TO CRY)
Please tell me why (PLEASE TELL ME WHY)
So much cruelty for this child (SHE WANTED TO CRY)
She'd lived in peace in her tribe before the white man arrived

They fought in the night and tried to survive
Their weapons were simply bows and arrows to fight

Shouts of fear and pain sounded in that bloody night
They tried to save their lives

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Her little dreams of a tomorrow will not happen, only a salvation
Can change this and will come from the sky a hope of a new day to live in peace forever

IN NIGHT FOREST HEARD HER VOICE BUT NOBODY HELP HER
In that night the forest heard her voice but nobody wanted to help her

[Chorus]
