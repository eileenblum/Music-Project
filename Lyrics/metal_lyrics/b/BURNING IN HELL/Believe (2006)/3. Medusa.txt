[Music: Marcelo, Lyrics: Leandro]

Born as a mortal with dreadful powers POWER
Even dead she can petrify
A lock of her hair scares any army
That is Medusa and nobody can look into her eyes

Flaunting snakes on her head, sharp and long teeth, hands of bronze and golden wings

[Chorus:]
MEDUSA, MEDUSA, MEDUSA, MEDUSA,
You'll petrify, if you look into her eyes, run while there is time
MEDUSA, MEDUSA, MEDUSA, MEDUSA,
You're gonna die, close your eyes, run while there is time

She is a creature bad and mighty
Her sparkling eyes show the power of her evil
Somebody has to stop her while there is time
A brave hero arms himself to confront her,

With a shield of bronze and winged sandals to float above the creature
While she sleeps he cuts her head with his sword and use the head as protection
Putting it in the shield of Athena

[Chorus]

[Solo]

When the enemies come
They'll find their destiny
If they look at her head
They'll become a stone army

When the enemies come
They'll find their destiny
If they look at her head
They'll become a stone army

[Chorus]

You'll petrify, if you look into her eyes
You're gonna die, close your eyes
