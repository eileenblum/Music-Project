[Music: Marcelo, Lyrics: Leandro and Marcelo]

[Chorus:]
You don't need to stop believing
You can't leave this feeling now

We were born innocent
Believing in everything
That is said to us

Never stop believing in the legends and stories
Life needs it

Don't kill the child that lives in you
Stop lying to others
And think about the truth
Don't wait to see that life's full of lies
'Cause we make it like this

If people continued living the true childhood
We would be better
With no envy, with no hate
Just believing in fairy tales

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Oh This feeling now
