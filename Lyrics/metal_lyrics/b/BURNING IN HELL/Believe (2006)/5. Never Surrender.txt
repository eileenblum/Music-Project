[Music: Emanuel Pieruccini and Leandro, Lyrics: Leandro]

All right!

To become a brave knight
Keep the shine in your eyes
And your honour as the key to find the eternal peace

Never escape from a battle and face your biggest fears
With the strength of your mighty shield and the power of your mighty spear

Defy your enemies and never surrender...

[Chorus:]
Don't be afraid of your fate
Be strong you will face him tonight
The power of your heart'll show you the way
And you'll be honoured for all in this day

Your faithful squires are your horse, spear and shield
Never underrate the loyalty of them
They'll be together with you in the path of glory or path of death

When you'll face some terrifying defiance
Follow the light in your brave heart
Feel its force and never surrender

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Defy the enemies and never surrender...

[Chorus]

All right!
