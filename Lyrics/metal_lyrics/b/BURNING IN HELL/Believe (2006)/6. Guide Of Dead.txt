[Music: Marcelo, Lyrics: Leandro]

Sacred dogs are dedicated to Him.
In the kingdom of dead he's the Judge
With the head of a jackal and body of a man
He's the faithful guard of the graves

Guide of deads
Anubis wants your soul

[Chorus:]
WATCH OUT Your time has arrived
WATCH OUT He'll guide your soul
WATCH OUT He can be your last chance
Before your soul goes away

He leads the dead, so their hearts will be judged in front of a court
Where the soul earns the right to pass and live again in the beyond

Or have the heart devoured by a devil
Suffering a terrible death one more time

WATCH OUT Your time has arrived
WATCH OUT He'll guide your soul
WATCH OUT He can be your last chance
Beforeâ¦.

[Solo]

[Chorus]
