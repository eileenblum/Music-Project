[Music: Leandro / Marcelo   Lyrics: Leandro]

The world of illusions keep in secret a lonely soul 
of the last of the dragons 
He gave up to fight 
'Cause the only way to save his heart 
is flying high through the skies 
Waiting for someday he can live alone,...alone 
Living in the darkness hiding in his cave 
[CHORUS]
Last of the dragons came from his cave and trying 
Change his fate 
Alone in the paradise 
He fights against all who try to take his life 
No more illusions living in peace with his soul, 
trying to save his heart 
By the forces come from the skies, 
where the heaven is waiting for him 
to can fly alone too high 
where he can wait and live his eternity 
waiting for his salvation 
his brothers are dead waiting for his day arrive 
[CHORUS]
