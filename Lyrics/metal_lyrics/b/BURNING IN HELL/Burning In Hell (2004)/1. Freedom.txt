[Music: Leandro / Marcelo   Lyrics: Leandro]

Live and feel the liberty in my eyes is just what I want 
But to live in this time, in the world that is covered in flames 
and demons ruled over man 
[BRIDGE]
Living now and forever will be 
My battle so I can live free 
Someday I will return to keep my fight and die forï¿½ 
[CHORUS]
FREEDOM is the only way 
FREEDOM to have another day 
FREEDOM is the feeling that I feel 
To keep the fight for 
FREEDOM people will live again 
FREEDOM burning the eternal flames 
FREEDOM give me forces so I can live 
And keep the fight for freedom 
Sacred blow of destiny gave us the cruel and injustice law 
From the forces of the evil that will never be stopped 
The parchment spoke the truth 
The kiss of sacred flames will reign over the land 
[BRIDGE - CHORUS]
It's time for revenge 
Revenge that's mine 
Living now and forever my batlle will happen in this night 
But I will fight ï¿½ 
[CHORUS]
Freedom... OOOOhhh 
And keep the fight for freedom
