[Music: Leandro / Marcelo   Lyrics: Leandro]

Slave of darkness, slave of darkness, slave of darkness 
I'm riding high across the wind to wash away all my sins 
So voices can be heard in my mind and Gods will light my whole life 
You see my fights and my prayers to follow the line of my destiny 
In my soul there's much grief 
'Cause I lost my hope 
Taking away my joy of living 
With no friends only my fears 
My dream is just to live and not be a slave of darkness 
[BRIDGE]
I live now and wait for someday 
So that I will be able to live in peace 
I live now and waiting for tomorrow 
And trying to escape to beï¿½ 
[CHORUS]
Slave of darkness, slave of darkness, slave of darkness 
I don't wanna be for all eternity 
I'm riding higher over the hills 
My eyes can't see anybody 
Nobody to save me 
The shadows will be my only friends 
Lost in the sky just me and my mind 
Isolated from the world only with my thoughts 
Emptiness in my eyes 
I want to live again 
[BRIDGE - CHORUS]
