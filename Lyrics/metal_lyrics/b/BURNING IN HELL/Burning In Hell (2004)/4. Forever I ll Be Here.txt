[Music: Geraldo / Marcelo   Lyrics: Leandro]

In this fight to survive, someday I'll stop to suffer or die 
Too early or too late, in my way, 
this will change my life 
I dream of freedom, that can lead us 
Flying higher in our dreams 
Even though I die 
My spirit will remain 'cause 
Forever I'll be here 
OOOOh... the hell is here 
OOOOh... burning in the flames 
OOOOh... it's my fate 
OOOOh... forever 
Die is the price, that I'll pay for my life 
Hiding in darkness all the night, maybe forever 
I look at my past, I can't understand 
What life has reserved for me, 
Hate and suffering, injustice and pain 
I'll remain 'cause 
Forever I'll be here 
[CHORUS]
