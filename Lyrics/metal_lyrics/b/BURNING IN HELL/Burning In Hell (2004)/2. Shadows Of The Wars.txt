[Music: Leandro / Marcelo   Lyrics: Leandro]

In the begining of bloody wars soldiers fight for their lives 
But many are wounded and started to die cannot see the sunrise 
Soldiers marching in the way of death 
Feeling pain and fear 
Cannot change their destiny they shed tears from their eyes 
In the sky signs of blood for all eternity 
Destruction fire cannot be controled by man 
[BRIDGE]
Women and children are praying 
While the soldiers are dying 
In this war that will never have an end 
[CHORUS]
They live in shadows trying to save their lives 
Escaping death to live in peace someday 
Their hearts want to touch the skies 
Not became one more shadows of the wars 
[SOLO: GERALDO SOLO: KIKO LOUREIRO]
Screams of pain and agony sounded in this battle fields 
When the night starts to fall, suffering bells will ring 
Many guns and many deaths helpless children suffering and crying 
Soldiers faces show the sadness but they have to fight 
On the ground, the dust from misery 
Shadows of  the wars not giving hope to live 
[BRIDGE - CHORUS]
