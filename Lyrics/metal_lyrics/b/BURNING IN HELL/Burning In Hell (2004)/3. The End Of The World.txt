[Music: Leandro / Marcelo  Lyrics: Leandro]

Sometimes I feel 
In my heart, a lot of pain, in the name of Gods my soul follow his own way 
[BRIDGE]
Now I understand why I must not ever trust in  a strange 
Because these can be your killer 
And taking your life changing your fate 
[CHORUS]
Don't stay wasting your precious life 
Go out and live a little time 
That you have to live 
Because it's arrivingï¿½ the end 
In the night, walking alone, deadly shadows come growing my pain 
Living alone, my past said goodbye to my eternal soul 
that's waiting  for his death to arrive 
Pain and suffering were meant to be in my fate 
As pale as death, as bitter as its taste 
Destruction and fire arrive from the sky 
These are the signs that the end arrives 
[CHORUS]
The end of the world 
And we have to try changing the world 
Looking at the sky and dream of the paradise 
Because it's arriving the end 
[CHORUS]
The end of the world 
And we have to try changing the world 
The end of the world 
The end of... the world
