[Music: Geraldo / Leandro   Lyrics: Geraldo / Leandro]

Hurt hands of a man 
Created the steel blade for the sword of a king 
He put in this sword all his feelings, hope, justice and hate 
Fighting for his people against the enemies 
Holding in their hands his sword of steel 
Their knights ride in their horses and pray for this night 
Waiting for the order of the king 
The order of the king is... 
[CHORUS]
FIGHT LIKE HEROES, on the battle fields 
WAITING FOR THE NIGHT, use your swords made of steel 
FOLLOW YOUR GREAT KING, he'll bring hope, riches and peace 
The knights have their minds, guided by the force of the king's heart 
That clamour to win, and clamour for glory, and victories for his people. 
Honor, justice, guide the king by heart and soul forever 
In this sword there's the weight of a nation 
Waiting to make justice by the king's hands 
[CHORUS]
Welcome to the battle 
WE WILL FIGHT TO WIN OR DIE!!! 
Fight for nation, for life of the king 
Never surround by power, 
Honor their lives and theirs swords 
And run to eternal glory... go!!! 
The order of the king is... 
[CHORUS]
Welcome to the battle 
WE WILL FIGHT TO WIN OR DIE!!! 
The blood spilled by the knights 
The blood spilled by the sword of the king 
That'll reign and bring hope and peace 
WE WILL FIGHT TO WIN!!!
