[Music: Leandro / Marcelo  Lyrics: Leandro]

All right...... 
A long time ago the noise of swords 
Sounded in the cold night 
The warrior of light I have to find 
And he'll help to save my life 
In the horizon there will be my last chance 
Alone in the dark, sheding my tears, this is the only way 
Fighting for my liberty and alone again 
Laying on the ground, waiting to see the called from eternity 
Begging for eternal rest in peace in this paradise 
[CHORUS]
I return to the sky to be free for all eternity 
But die never will I while the people are still sheding bloody tears 
Running to fight against the time 
Screams of warriors are the song of night 
Facing my fears I can't believe 
This is my cruel destiny 
To save my soul and can rest in peace 
Walking the night, facing my fears, I lead my heart by this hate 
Fighting against my cruel destiny I will try another day 
Crying on the cross, sheding my tears, 
gods' blow will have to appear 
Praying for eternal rest in peace in this paradise 
[CHORUS]
I can't find the warrior of light 
Will this be my fate? 
Dying for my people and alone I will fight far away 
Crossing the skies, losing my faith, 
gods' blow open the gates of hate 
Fighting for eternal rest in peace in this paradise 
[CHORUS]
Oohhh.... while the people are still sheding bloody tears 
A long time ago bloody swords reign in the night 
Living in darkness waiting for a better day 
Freeing my soul keep the faith in my heart 
Praying to Gods not to burn in the flames of... hell
