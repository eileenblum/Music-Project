[Music: Leandro / Marcelo   Lyrics: Leandro]

In the time that sword power worth more than any word 
A land moist of  blood spilled by warriors 
A child was born and he'll show the salvation way 
The people pray the rosary in church with hope a best someday 
[BRIDGE]
Fighting monsters, wizards and dragons 
His bravery was one of a kind 
He was blessed by gods 
And he had a brave heart 
The kings only wanted new lands and more riches 
While the people worked hard only to live 
Many wars and a lot of destruction, people go to a place far away 
Bodies fallen on the ground, prisioners with rusted chains 
[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]
Brave warriors fight for freedom 
They kill monsters and dragons 
This child became a brave warrior 
He'll never lose bravery in his heart 
Bravery in his heart 
[BRIDGE - CHORUS]
