Civil serpents set to devour their prey
Hungry beyond words the stations feast
The cityscape befalls a wild dreamscape
And the violence of speed and speed of violence hits you right in the face

Perceptions prophecised in binary
Running at speeds which exceed reality
Conveyor belt science feeds a mechanic chief
The painful pace causes untold grief hits you right in the face

I like production on a massive scale
My kin plugged with their souls on sale
Travelling to work in jammed jet planes
Covering their eyes every time it rains
