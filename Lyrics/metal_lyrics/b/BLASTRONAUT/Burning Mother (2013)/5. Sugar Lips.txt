Locked shocked and loaded looking down the sight
Chemically eroded lost human parasite
Remains of childhood soul memories of light
Another day of waste another scar to hide

Screaming winds stand high fear crawling across the land
Howling winds they climb explosions from my hand
Another day of waste another scar to hide
