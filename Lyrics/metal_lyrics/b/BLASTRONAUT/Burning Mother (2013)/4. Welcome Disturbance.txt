Forlorn survivors left shredded idle instinct
A gentle power shift from general to precise
Malicious crowds amass consume our forgotten prayers
Buried beneath our cause reviving ancient war
Reviving ancient wars I swallow wretched time expel a futile lie
Enslaved infinite binds a welcome disturbance

My drive is all I need mired in sordid conspiracy please let me die alone
Now watch me twist and turn I will run my course and crash and burn a faceless hero I am gone
It is time for a fresh idea with everyone pushing north
Do not need no deluded seer turn around and watch it go off
