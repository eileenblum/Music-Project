The elders breath melts a frozen song
Spitting smiles through a knowing tongue
Amongst the plans in a chest of lies
Berserker sons hear their mothers' cries
Mothers' cries barefoot march through the vacant cold
The journey starts on a barren road barren road forsaken road

Underneath the celestial night in a time
Devoid of light close your eyes and crave the fight
Looking round to see the battle won
Bestow our thanks to synthetic sun synthetic sun
