Carnage in Carthage breeds pillage and damage
A thousand archers' graves a coward's demand
Trade shaded by their faith as they stand in a land of blood and sand
Row heave to the drum oars to the sun

Elisha founded Phonecian queen
The city plundered under thunder slaves on their knees
Restored to life times the shining city will meet Hades
