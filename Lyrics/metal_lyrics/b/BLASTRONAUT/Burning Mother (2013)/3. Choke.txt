Hide your knowledge in tombs of gold
Cease ideas from being sold
Create a picture out of earth and leaves
Damaged memories as winter bleeds
Dig shallow holes peppered with bones

Burn the family bury their crest
Corrupt the corpses in a charred forgotten nest
Dig shallow holes peppered with bones
Disposed in rags and stitches collaborated with dark witches
Souls cracked and splintered ashes form the epicentre
