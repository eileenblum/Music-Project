White teeth greeting through a tainted smile
Drifted cold spirit in a sphere misled by the curse of going blind
Too old with old with spite and living fearless cold sweats and anxious

I am blinded by retreat of your unspeakable deceit
My Earth decorated fire you have aborted my empire
Too old with spite and living fearless cold sweats and anxious
