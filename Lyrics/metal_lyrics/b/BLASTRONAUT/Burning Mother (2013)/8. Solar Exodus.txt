Hallowed soil corrupt with tyranny nature's milk sucked dry
Effusive drones draw blood from a sleeping giant legacy denied
Her hands come with a silent push ripped veins in the sky
Sacrificed a taste of what is good acerbic taste of night
Bridges burn from one mind to the next life sustained by wires
Free spark borne decrepit loins radiated fires

Take my hand burning mother don't let my heart grow cold
Free my sense to grow old
Radiate my extinction don't let my heart grow cold
Free my sense to grow old
Breathe in breathe out
Take my hand burning mother don't let my heart grow cold
Free my sense to grow old
