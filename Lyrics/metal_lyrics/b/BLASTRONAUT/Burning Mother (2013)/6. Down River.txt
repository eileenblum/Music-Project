Skimming a down stream dream advanced ahead shiftless and idle
A sorry collection of desperate souls
We do not follow no Roman roads
There is something in front of a blinkered eye suggests to go left then right then right
Something that won't be easy a request that is out of sight
Something that won't be easy the darkened flavour of delight down river
