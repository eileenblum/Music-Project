Winds whistle
frosty trees
gloomy darkness
it drains the light
world of chaos
corpses of carnage
it is snowing
black snow from the sky

Rites of blood
weltering in gore
Executioner
and spilling blood
crowd of creatures
evil laugh
human sacrifice
dies !

Ohhh, sky is dark
thy fears wake up
ohhh, nightmares
of the winter of the black snow

Thousands of corpses
all over the ground
Axe of executioner
is painted by blood
Blood of sacrifice
who have frozen tears
Frozen tears in the
frozen eyes...
