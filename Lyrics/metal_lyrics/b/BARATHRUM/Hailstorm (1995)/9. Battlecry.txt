Christian slaves
and their church
must be destroyed
raped and killed
This is the battlecry !

Their God is dead
they praise the corpse
now burn their churches
Kill them all
This is the Battlecry !

This means war against the christian belief
we'll win this war and we'll drink the toast of victory

Fight, rape and kill
Burn, cut, destroy
