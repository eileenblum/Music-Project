In darkness I fly
I won't remember this journey
but pain
it will be part of my memories

Bursting inferno
it blows fire
it burns
it burns oh so sweltering heat

Truely strong survive
false burns
even inside myself
I'll survive
by the power of my black mind

Claws of darkness
Darkness of evil
swoop on prey
my claws... my claws

In darkness I fly 

Rise of the power
inside myself
Rise of my brother
and friend
Bloodred and
jetblack blessings
upon my head
upon my mind

Black of my heart
Black of my blood
Black of my mind
Pure black from the pit

I have been so lonely
lonely in darkness
Darkness which tortures
Darkness which delights

In darkness I fly
I won't remember this journey
but pain
that be part of my memories
