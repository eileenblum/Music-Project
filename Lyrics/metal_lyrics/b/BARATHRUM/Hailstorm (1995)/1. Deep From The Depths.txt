I hear evil voices Is this true ?
Whispers, roars,
cries and growls
Voices deep from the depths

I fly
through the endless space
and I feel the wind
of nocturnal darkness

I hear the voice of flames
so strong and so burning
I feel so great by
these gloomy visions

Deep from the depths
voices so evil
listening to these voices
on my way down
