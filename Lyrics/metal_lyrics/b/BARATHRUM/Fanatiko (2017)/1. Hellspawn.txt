In the cellar it's dark
Locked up
So cold
Wounded
Beaten up 
Prisoned  by psychopath

Dark dungeon underground
Chained up to the wall
Grim killer, Satan's son

Hellspawn

Hostages scared to death
Blasphemic torture ritual
Wounds form pentagrams
Drawn by the knife

Sadist without masochist
Celebration in blood
Ecstasy overload
Hellspawn
Hellspawn

They welter in their own excrement
Mixed with their own blood
Pleasures of the violence
Creating orgasm

Hear the bell of doom
They will die soon
Dignity. It's gone
Hellspawn
Hellspawn

Hellspawn

Around the corner
Death is smiling tortured
Preacher, wounded rabbi
Faith is lost
Cries of pain

Final blessing
Bleeding vein
Brutal violence
Chains and blades
Gaunt imaam
Swollen face

Raped by hog
Straight up the ass
Not so pure anymore
Anymore

Anymore
