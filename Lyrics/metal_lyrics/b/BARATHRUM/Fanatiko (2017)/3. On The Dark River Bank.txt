Subterranean Saraswati
River of enlightenment
Cadavers from funeral
Eaten in the ritual

On the dark river bank
Eating the decayed man
Ceremonies and chants
Humming in the pitch black night

Painted body
Demon face
Under bright full moon rays
Feasting on cadaver
Cold lifeless
Skin so pale

Blood welter in the filth
Sacred rituals
Necromance
Ritual of cannibal
On the dark river bank
