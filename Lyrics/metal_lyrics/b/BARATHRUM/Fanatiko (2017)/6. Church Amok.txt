Dead, cold, milky pale skin
Taste of iron in mouth
Refusing
To let anyone live
In this temple of Christ

Splitted head
Splatter dead
Reverend
Run berserk
The carpet
Painted red
Swinging blade
Insane raid

Massacre of believers
Gospels gone to hell
Scythe wielder delivers
Inhale fresh blood smell

Church amok
Death toll ten
Eleven twelve
Go to hell
