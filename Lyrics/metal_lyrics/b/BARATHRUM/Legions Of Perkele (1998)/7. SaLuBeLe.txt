Running through the fire
Taking a breath, praising the air
Standing on the hill of this earth
Standing in the rain

Dark blood of mine
I'm four but one
Four names, four princes
SaLuBeLe

I deny three I praise two
Devilish thoughts of my mind
Including four mighties
SaLuBeLe

Satan - Lord of south and fire
Lucifer - Lord of east and air
Belial - Lord of north and earth
Leviathan - Lord of west and
Water...!
