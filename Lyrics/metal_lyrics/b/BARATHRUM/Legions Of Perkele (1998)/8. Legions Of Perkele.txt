You followed the strongest hailstorm
And you heard those voices so eerie
Through flames of hell, infernal
You travelled to be part of legions of
Perkele

Lucifer, rise your lantern lead me through the darkness
Belial, make me strong by ultimate wickedness
Leviathan, great navigator prince of sea and west
Satan, great Satan, from the fire and south he rises

(We)You are part of Legions of Perkele

Those years of torment
Fresh warrior blood was shed
Armies burning and dying
I have seen but strongest stands
By the power of black mind
Black master mind of pit
Metal strong filled with hatred
Makes those weak ones to bleed

(We)You are part of Legions of Perkele

I have lots of wounds
In my corpse but still
But still I am fighting
Sometimes with the chainsaw
I have spilled lots of blood
My own too, but also
The blood of the crawlers
The subhuman slaves

(We)You are part of Legions of Perkele

I am jetblack warrior
Jetblack by my heart
Those spirits of abyss
Became to be my friends
Only few of those ghosts
Have tried to betray me
I always survived
By the friends of hell

(We)You are part of Legions of Perkele

I Lucifer, rise your lantern lead me through the darkness
Belial, make me strong by ultimate wickedness
Leviathan, great navigator, prince of sea and west
Satan, great satan, from the fire and south
He rises he rises he rises from
Hell...!
