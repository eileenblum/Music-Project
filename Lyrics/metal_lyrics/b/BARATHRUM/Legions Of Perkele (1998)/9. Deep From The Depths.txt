I Hear Evil Voices - Is This True?
Whispers, Roars, Cries And Growls
Voices Deep From The Depths

I Fly, Through The Endless Space
And I Feel The Wind
Of Nocturnal Darkness

I Hear The Voice Of Flames
So Strong And So Burning
I Feel So Great By
These Gloomy Visions

Deep From The Depths
Voices So Evil
Listening Those Voices
On My Way Down...
