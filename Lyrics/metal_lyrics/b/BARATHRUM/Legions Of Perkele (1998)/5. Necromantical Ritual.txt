Here I am for nocturnal necromancy
For the dark magick to perform my rite
Ancient knowledge studied from those old books
Written by sorcerers, written in blood

I am necromancer, I'm questioning deceased
Magick of necromancy at night on the graves
Living human beings I can not trust to them
As I trust to dead ones, raised from their graves

Soil of the graveyard moved by shovel
Oaked lid of coffin, I find from that hole
At the dead of the night cross-screws open
In moon light
I move the lid of casket, there's white-heared dead

Those magic circles around this grave
And casted spells in the air
My magic wand on dead I lay
Wake up, you dead, and obey
Answer for my questions now
With your grim voice speak out loud
I command you by infernal names
For you to obey my orders
Necromancer that's what I am
I raise the dead by magic spell
I ask the questions from the dead
I'm nocturnal necromancer

Necromantic Ritual...!
