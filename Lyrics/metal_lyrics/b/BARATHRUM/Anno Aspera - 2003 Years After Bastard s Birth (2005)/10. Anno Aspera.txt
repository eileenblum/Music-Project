Bridge of death, falling to death
Committed suicide, by chosen own
Overdose of medicine, end without sense
Fatal cancer, funeral fall
Internal bleeding, in the brain
Rusty razorblade, alcohol and pills
Drugs and confusion, self destruction
Fast life - worth of death

Without warning, one by one
People around, all dead
Planning to die, suicide,
Suicide, suicide

Anno aspera

God listen, and you will fall
We ain't no band, but we nuclear reactor
Nuclear reactor, in a very bad shape
In condition critical
Ready to explode
Callers of sonic torture

Invasion sixsixsix
Death, dectruction
Anno aspera
Anno aspera
