My deal with satan, is sealed with blood
By my own human blood - I'm a tool of great goat
I lift up my eyes
Unto the hills
I scream the words of ritual
For my master
Satan is my master
Lord of darkness
I prase thee
Satan
My deal with satan...

[Lead: Pelceboop]
Devilish evil
Hell is all I need
By blood rituals
I praise my master

Devilish evil...
My deal with satan...
