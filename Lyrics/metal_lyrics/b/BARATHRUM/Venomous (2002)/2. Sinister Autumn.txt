Angels are crying
their tears are blood
they learned the meaning
of fallen angel

Instinct of nature
carnal lust
dark side of nature
death, evil, black

Sinister autumn
smell of death
grave is calling
for weak ones
Death takes
weakest ones
who are not
strong enough to live
(in this hell)

Autumn smells like death
death of weakest ones
preparing for autumn rites
rites with expensive sacrifices
