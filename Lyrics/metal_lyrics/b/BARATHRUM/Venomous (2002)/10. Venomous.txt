Behold The Blood Of Sacrifice It's Running From The Altar 
The Altar Of Sacrifice, Offering For Dark Ones, Dark Ones Of Abyss. 
Hear My Words Of Invocation, Invocation For The Demons, Come And Serve Me Now 
Serve Me Now Like Servants Always Do, Do The Work That I Command Within 
This Rite, This Rite With Blood Sacrifice I Execute, I Execute For The Purposes 
Of My Own Blood Of Sacrifice Is The Price I Pay, I Pay It For You Demons Of 
Hell, The Hell On Earth For My Enemies, My Enemies You Should Take Care Of 
Take Care Of Them, My Demon Servants, I Pay This Price For You In My Rite 
This Rite Of Blood Of Sacrifice. So Now, Give The Hell For Enemy. Oh Satan, 
The Prince Of Darkness Of Hell What To Do, For You Demons Now, I Tell 
Give Torture, Nightmares, Sleepless Nights, For My Enemy, That's Why I 
Pay The Price. Oh Lilith, Show Your Finger Nails, By Them Rip The 
Flesh During Days That My Enemy Can't Take A Rest, Now Do Your Work 
To Serve My Best. Oh Lucifer, Bring The Light To Dark, When My Enemy 
Needs The Rest. Keep Your Flame So Bright That He Can Not Rest, To Keep 
Him Just Awake. Oh Tiemnes Make My Enemy To Suffer. By Your Lightning 
Keep Him Awake. Of Morpheus, Enter To The Life So Ruined, And Help My 
Enemy To Final Dream. But During The Final Sleep Of My Enemy, I Ask You 
Dark Gods To Turture Him To Wake Him To Understand Those Things That He 
Made For Me To Ruin My Life. I Praise You Dark Gods Of Abyss And I 
Execute This Infernal Rite Of Blood. Blood Is The Payment For Your Work, 
Now I Wait For You To Serve Me Well. Give The Hell For Enemy, Show The Power 
Of Mine. Make Him Suffer And Let Him Know That He Can Not Play With Fire 
Fire Of Hell, Is What He Needs, So Burn Him Slowly And Make Him Feel, The 
Torture From The Immortals, The Demonic Whip What My Enemy Needs. 
So Now Demons Do You Work So Infernal, And I Hope That You'll Be Gone 
When Your Work Is Done Finally And My Enemy Got The Rest Of Grave 
So It Is Done!
