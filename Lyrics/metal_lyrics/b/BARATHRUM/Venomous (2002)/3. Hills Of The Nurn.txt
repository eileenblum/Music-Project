From the ruins of once so great realm
we rise for the new millenium of the strong
bold and brave warriors to wield steel of old
to bring ancient glory once more to unfold!

Symbol of sixmillion
monument of devastation

The broud bearers of the broken armed cross
marching over fields and alien gods
A mountain of skulls to tell the story
Their victims united to witness his glory!

Marching hordes on the hill of the Nurn
I hope they all in their graves they turn!
In torchlit rows through the jetblack night
warriors of dark holocaust's bride?
