I'm the blasphemer - by infernal fire
I'm the blasphemer - by infernal hate
I'm the blasphemer - by inferno's fire
I'm the blasphemer - by infernal wrath
I see crimson in your blood
Snow-white is your dead skin
They told me that you were supposedly god
And my deed was ultimate sin
But what I have done
Was just pure justice
I raised the shining blade
To protect myself
I crush the crucifix because
Age of satan shall come to pass
Mark of the beast: 666
On my breast means I'm anti-christ
Son of fire, son of satan
Anti-christ and the beast
Messenger of destruction
Great beast and the blasphemer
