Creation of ethereal atmosphere by my ritual
Hidden force of the nature is now guest of mine
I... feel... the... ancient... power... in... the... air
Circle on the ground
Seal drawn into it
I stand in the middle
Of the sign
I... feel... the... ancient... power... in... the... air
(In the name of satan)
Open wide the gates of hell
And come forth from the abyss
Open wide the gates
(In the name of satan)
Open wide the gates of hell
To greet me as your brother
And friend of hell
I salute you, my ethereal guest!
