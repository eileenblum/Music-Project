As you might remember the funeral of mine
After great battle where I was dying
But I return to dwell back on earth to spread
The black seeds of hell to create a new breed
New race to rule the mankind of fools
And my mania is boundless to make this to be true
I will lead the troops
Of mankind's doom
It's time to face the dawn
To hear the battle roar
So now you know
I am the chosen lord
Immortal warrior
Of immense force
Destroy, destroy, weak mankind we'll destroy
My troops of satanic age
Are marching with pure rage
Kill, burn, rape, pillage
Weak mankind we'll destroy
