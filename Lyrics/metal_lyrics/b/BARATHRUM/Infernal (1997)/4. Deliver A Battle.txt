Black darkness of the night
Full moon is only light
Moonlight shines from the steel
Of swords ready to kill
Troop of bold warriors
Full of greatest pride
Those bravest men of war
Are ready to strike
Swords and armours
Shields and spears
All the weapons
Made of steel
They deliver a battle
To destroy the enemy
They deliver a battle
They spill the blood
They deliver a battle
They deliver a battle
The troop of full moon night
Full moon of strength and might
War-spirit fills their mind
Invincible they are
Enemies shall be killed
And their blood shall be spilled
One battle more to be
In list of victories
This is the doom and death
Of their weak enemies
That troop of warriors
Of invincible steel
Swords and armours
Shields and spears
All the weapons
Made of steel
