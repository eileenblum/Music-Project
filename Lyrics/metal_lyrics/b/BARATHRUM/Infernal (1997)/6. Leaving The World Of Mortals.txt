I lie awake on the battlefield
A fatal wound in my breast
I'm soon to be dead
Yet still I am thinking...
A sail on the horizon
Vanishing in the crimson dawn...
My comrades are gone...
Victorious! - and silence descends...
Suddenly I hear the hooves
Not born from this earth
The valkyries come
They found me worthy
I'm drawn upon a horse's back
Shivering with fright and joy
I know I have died
To live forevermore
Leaving the world of mortals
I already can see those gates
Once arrived I will join the feast
Where all my brave ancestors wait
Welcomed by ravens
I'm shown the place I've earned
Around the fire we sit and drink
Until time ends...
