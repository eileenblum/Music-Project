Coffin is open for you
And it will be closed too
Death will be your saviour
By it you'll get out from this world
Life... is... hell... but death is saviour
Torture, pain and suffering
Death is the gate out from the hell
Live no like those fucking slaves
Slaves of nothing else but hell
Ave satanas, luciferi
Inside... of me... is burning great flame...
Belial, leviathan
Give me fury... strength and the power...
