so dark so black is night around
by nocturnal deed cross the bound
flame burning bright in the candle
magic fills air - creates atmosphere
being surrounded by visions
of beauties and the beasts of night
dancing on edge of lunacy
to write down this dim prophecy

I am very possessed by demons of hell
they shake my mind and I can tell
they make me do things that none could
lots of their blood I've been drinking

I am very possessed by demons of hell
I am very possessed
I am very possessed by demons of hell
I am very possessed

when I wake up sun turns to black
it warms no more
when I wake up I'm rounded by dark
forevermore

so dark so black is night around
by nocturnal deed cross the bound
flame burning bright in the candle
magic fills air - creates atmosphere

being surrounded by visions
of beauties and the beasts of night
dancing on edge of lunacy
to write down this dim prophecy
