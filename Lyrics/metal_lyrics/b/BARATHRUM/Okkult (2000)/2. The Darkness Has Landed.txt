the darkness has landed
a moon on the sky
dark coven gathered
for the nocturnal rite
a cloak on his shoulders
bell and dirk in his hands
high priest of the ritual
cuts the silence by chant
a chamber for rituals
the gate to the other worlds
it is opened by the spells
to summon those demons

those spirits of darkest realms
arrive through this room
for black magic purpose of mine
for spreading my doom
gestic magic, the spell and the chant

high priest of this night and this rite
setting the curse upon enemy
striking with the fatal energy
the chant, the spell
released from hell

the force of dark side
the gastic magic night
a harmful, even fatal
well wished and asked
from demons of pit
the curse has been set

the darkness has landed
a moon on the sky
dark coven gathered
for the nocturnal rite
a cloak on his shoulders
bell and dirk in his hands
high priest of the ritual
cuts the silence by chant
