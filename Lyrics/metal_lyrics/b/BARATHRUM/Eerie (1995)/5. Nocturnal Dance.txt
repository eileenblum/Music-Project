Cemetery Is Dressed 
By The Darkness 
Fog Embraces 
The Tombstones 
Ghostspirits Wake Up 
From Their Graves 
To Form Their Dancing Circle 

Aaargh! 

Nocturnal Dance 
Of Spirits Of Dead 
Nocturnal Dance 
On The Graveyard 
Nocturnal Dance 
Under The Pale Moon 
Nocturnal Dance 
Of Children Of The Night 

They Sing And They Dance 
'Till Morning Twilight 
They Will Hide In Their Graves 
They Wait Next Night
