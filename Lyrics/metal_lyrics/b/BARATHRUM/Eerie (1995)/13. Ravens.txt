Two Black Birds 
Flying To The North 
On The Sky So High 
I Can See 

Like Black Arrows They Fly 
Through The Clowds Of Sky 
With Winds They Fly 
Through The Sky 

When I Have Spilled Enough 
Blood Of My Enemies 
I Will Follow Those Birds 
Harbinger Birds 

Those Birds With Black Eyes 
And Black Feathers 
From The Great Halls 
Of Valhalla 

Raven 
Harbingers 
They'll Lead Me To My Goal Of Destiny 
Raven 
Harbingers 

I Go For The Battle 
From Battle To Battle 
Raven Harbingers 
They'll Lead Me To My Destiny 

I Wait For The Enter 
The Gates Of Valhalla 
Two Raven Harbingers Will 
Lead Me Through Those Gates 

When It's Time To Leave 
My Weapons Behind 
To Take My Helmet Off 
To Leave My Armour 

I Will Follow Those Birds 
Through The Majestic Gates 
After Final War 
For Myself 

On The Battlefields 
I Fight Til Death 
To Reach My Destiny 
To Enter The Gates Of Valhalla 

I Will Fight 
Til My Time Has Come To Die 
Then Those Ravens Will Hear 
My Last War Cry
