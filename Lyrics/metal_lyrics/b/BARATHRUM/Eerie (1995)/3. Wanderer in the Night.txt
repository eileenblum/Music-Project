Wanderer In The Night 
Eyes Burning Mystical Fire 
Creature In The Shadows 
The Hunter In The Dark 

Burning, Fire Of The Eyes 
Fire Directly From Inferno 
Burning Fire Of The Eyes 
By The Spell I Casted Ages Ago 

Darkness Of Black Night 
Moonless Is This Night 
From The Shadows That Light 
Shines From The Eyes 

Black Fire Is Burning Grimly 
Frenzied Beast Inside Me 
Is Screaming For Blood 
Tonight I'll Be The Hunter In The Dark 

Darkness Of Black Night 
Moonless Is This Night 
From The Shadows That Light 
Shines From The Eyes 

...From The Eyes... 
...Shines That Light... 
...In The Dark... 
...In The Night... 

In The Shadows That Light 
Shines From The Eyes 
Darkness Of Black Night 
Moonless Is This Night
