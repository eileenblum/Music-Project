I Am Lying On My Sheets 
In My Sweat I Cannot Sleep 
I Stare The Ceiling Without Rest 
I Feel The Calling Of Moon 
Wakeful Night, Fullmoon Prevails 
Night Calls For Expedition 
I'm Possessed By Night And Shadows 
Moon Calls Me Up For Hunt 
I Hunt Dark Experiences 
I Spit Fire, I Bark For Moon 
I Sing And Dance On The Hills 
Fullmoon Is Obsession Of Mine 
I Feel The Beast Inside Of Me 
I Must Open Myself Right Now 
I Adore The Force Of Moonlight 
I Run, I Bark In The Night 

Fullmoon Prevails 
Night Is Calling 
Shadows - My Obsession 
Moon Calls
