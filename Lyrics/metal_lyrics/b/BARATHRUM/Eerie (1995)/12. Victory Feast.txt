Wings Of Storm 
Carrying Me Home 
From The Fields Of Jetblack War 
Victory Of Mine 
Lost Of Enemy 
My Sword Painted By Blood 
I Hail My Gods 
Gods Of War And Hate 
They Made Me Win Again 
I Celebrate 
And Drink My Toast 
For My Great Victory 

Great Feast Of Warriors Of Hell 
We Celebrate Our Victory 
Celebration Of The Darkest Ones 
We Were Strongest Once Again 
And We'll Be, And We'll Be - Forever! 

I Get My Gift From The Gods 
They Let Me Rejoice The Feast 
I Won My War Once Again 
It's Time For The Feast 

I Hail My Gods 
They Are Part Of me 
I Hail My Gods 
By My Victory Feas
