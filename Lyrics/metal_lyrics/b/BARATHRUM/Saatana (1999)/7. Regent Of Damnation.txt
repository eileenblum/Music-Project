I feel that I am high, I'm not on the ground
Did I just die, did I reach the bound?
The bound between life and realm after death
Am I alive or did I just die?
Do I dream, am I awake
Is this real or just a vision?
If this is vision, it's incredibly great
If I am dead, why the hell I had life?

Could it be true that just died because I feel that I fly
Like flying through the misty air, after all I just don't care

I don't care, if I am dead or alive
I don't care, if I am dreaming or awake
I don't care, I just feel sp great
I don't care, I do not care

Could it be true that just died because I feel that I fly
Like flying through the misty air, after all I just don't care

I feel the power within and I feel the great force
All my life I lived in sin so did I leave the mortal world
So if I'll see white guards of the heaven's gates
I will tear them in the parts because hell is my place

I am just on the vacation from my work in the hell
I'm the regent of damnation, ruler of the hell itself
I'm the regent of damnation, I'm the regent of damnation
I'm the regent of damnation, ruler of the hell itself

I'm the regent of damnation
