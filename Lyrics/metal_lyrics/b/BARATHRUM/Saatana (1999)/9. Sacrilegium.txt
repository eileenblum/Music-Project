Temple desecration sacrilegium
Hailing the beast of pentagram
Stolen treasures from church of slaves
Performed rituals for their death

Turned cross of holy altar
Ceremonies of fire and blood
In nomine dei nostri
Satanas luciferi (excelsi)

Sacrilegium
Sacrilegium

Temple desecration sacrilegium
Hailing the beast of pentagram
Stolen treasures from church of slaves
Performed rituals for their death

Spilling blood of sacrifice
Upon altar which is desecrated
Christian god it is dead
Let it be known by sacrilegium

In nomine dei nostri
Satanas luciferi excelsi!
