It is time to tell (hell)
I came from the hell (hell)
Hell is my home (hell)
Wicked my soul (hell)
I'm greedy for blood (hell)
Oh yes, and a lot (hell)
The most twisted kind (hell)
Is my evil mind

Now listen if you dare, I'm most evil nightmare
I call saints to sin, and always, yes, I win
Innocence I ruin, I ask all you to join
Join this hellish feast of the inferno's beast

Some day I'll return to where fire burns
The twisting, hot flames playing fiery games
I will fly back to home with my wicked soul
So listen me wll, have fun and go to hell
