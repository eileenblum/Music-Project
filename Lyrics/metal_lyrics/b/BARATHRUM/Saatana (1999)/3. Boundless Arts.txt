Summon the spirits, listen the wind
Look into flames, listen your mind
Study great arts, be sure what you do
Collect the parts of puzzle so huge
Mind is tool and weapon aswell
It's powers can raise the hell
Mind is abyss and pit with gods
It is store of boundless arts

Aaaarrgh! boundless arts
Aaaarrgh! abuse your mind
