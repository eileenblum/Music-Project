Pray to stop the storm that comes for you. Pray for mercy
I never saw it coming, the violence of tonight
And as my face begins to bleed, you fucking coward
You spilled my blood, placed this rage inside my heart. You sealed your fate
Revenge is at the end of this bat and as I wait in the darkness to return what you gave
Cheap shot motherfucker. Your face looks better bleeding
You lay there screaming with broken bones, you'll never know
You spilled my blood, placed this rage inside my heart.
Consequences will be here to stay. Repercussion never discriminates
Now feel the pain like I feel the pain
Is this the only way to feel? Is this the only thing I feel?
What's in your head? Your face looks better bleeding, while my fist still pounds your head
So now you're the victim, the only way I can get back to a sense that I am a person
Now you know I will defend it
