Wake the fuck up. Your life is slipping day by day, enough is enough
In the times that I surrendered, I can never take them back
So ill burn though the white flag, raise my fist and hit you back
You tore the boundaries moved the line, you moved the line
You speak with silence. When you preach your contradictions override
You speak with silence. Shroud the lies, you hide behind them until you find
You can fucking run but you can't hide
Release the hounds. Make sure the night takes justice
Now I'll break you. I fucking hate you. I see the fear in your eyes
Self destructed. I'd fucking pay to watch you fall from grace
Now to see you rot. Now I'll see you rot
Now how the fuck does it make you feel? Your world is caving in
Now how the fuck does it make you feel,? You've lost all that you loved
Now how the fuck does it make you feel? I'm standing right behind you
Now how the fuck does it make you feel? I'll stab your fucking heart
Now how the fuck does it make you feel?
