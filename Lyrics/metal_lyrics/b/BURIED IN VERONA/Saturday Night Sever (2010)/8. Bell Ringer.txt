We raid this city in search of survivors
But the ones who are still alive that scream out to be dead
This hatred fueled by a different prayer. You brought us to our knees
This hatred fueled by a different prayer. If you created us then why kill us?
Why did I descend from your rose line? Was it punishment or brought forth with anger? Why did we descend from your rose line? Did we all deserve this? Did we all have to die?How can we believe you when we don't believe in ourselves?
There are miracles and disasters in the world we know today
And we cant see the white light shinning until darkness fills the day
You don't need protecting when there's nothing to protect. There is nothing left to fear
This is not the time to be wasting the precious memories
This is not the time to be faking
We only get one chance. You only get one chance
