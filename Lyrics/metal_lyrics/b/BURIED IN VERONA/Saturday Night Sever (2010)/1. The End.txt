Take all of me. All I am. I donât deserve you
I watch you broken heart be rebuilt, only for me to destroy it
You're all I ever wanted. Now look what I have become
Sacrificing all these fucking memories to gamble on selfish self-indulgent dreams
I pave the future, it splits our past. This could be the end
I hate to be so cold
You know this is what Iâve always wanted. You know Iâd do anything for this
Iâd do anything
Will you be there waiting for me? Will you be there to start again?
Will you be there in the end? Iâm sorry for the tears
Forgive my self-inflicted situation. Fuck it up
