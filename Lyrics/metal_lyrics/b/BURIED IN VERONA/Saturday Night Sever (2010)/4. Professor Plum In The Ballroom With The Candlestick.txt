You were everything
Not knowing what's ahead is the fucking worst thing to know. My life's about to change
This is a sinking feeling. Your face beneath the waves and your air is laced with pain
You were everything. Bitch
You were everything. You're all that mattered to me
You were everything. Now only memories for me
You were everything. You're all that mattered to me
You were everything. I hope you bleed to death
The sky feels like its falling down again. I swear this day and I have met
Is this what you dreamed of? Im in miseries repartition
Breathe in its over. There's only smoke where the flames were burning
Is this the feeling that you get when your fucking life's run through?
Fuck you. Back the fuck away. I can't stand the sight of you
