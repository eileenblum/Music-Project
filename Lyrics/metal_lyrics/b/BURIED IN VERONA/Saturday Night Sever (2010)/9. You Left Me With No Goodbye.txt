Forever youâll remain remembered, within our hearts as your body decays from this disease
We're all just waves in the ocean, we break but we will remain
My soul is still bleeding as the hope begins to fade
This is something that you canât regret. Everyone is around you to save you again
I walk the path of shadows as my friends walk through to the gates of hell
This pain feels so hollow
When you left, you left us behind
This is something that you canât regret. Everyone is around you to save you again
Now paint the picture but face it down. It's hard to look into your eyes
I see the demons that took your life away. They took your fucking life away
