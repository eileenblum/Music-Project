You are the temptress that blinded me
I hate this conflicted condescending life. I strive to be free
My heart pulls me in your direction, but this melody takes all of me
To you this is just a phase. A stage for my reflection
You say you have the answers. Now hold me down, down forever
You say you have all the answers. Now hold me down, down forever
Control is driving me away. My heart deceiving me to stay
We got these pictures on the wall, its time to bury you my dear
I'll live my life on my own now. Donât have to carry all your fears
Your words confusing me, contradicting what I see
You make a liar out of me. Two worlds colliding catastrophe
We are forsaken
We got these pictures on the wall, its time to bury you my dear
I'll live my life on my own now. Donât have to carry all your fears
