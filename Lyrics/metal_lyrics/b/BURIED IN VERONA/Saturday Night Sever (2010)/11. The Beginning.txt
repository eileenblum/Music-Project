This journey has been so long, felt every step
Every emotion and every pain, and Iâm still standing
I will never be the same, walking through the struggles
Bleeding hands from scratching beneath all the bullshit that is the lies that hide your face
Why the fuck are you pretending? Will you face me or will you drown?
Iâll hold your head beneath the water, until you donât fight back
Is it hard to talk when youâre dead? Iâve never laughed so hard
I will not be broken
For the shadows of my ending have fallen from my sight, and left me with nothing
