Did you ever think I would find out, 
guess I never thought you'd be like this so self absorbed. 
How could I finish this with so much hate, 
wasted time on my mind and I just canât break it,

I can feel it growing in my mind, 
countless hours leaving us behind, 
what was said, what was done, 
I'd never wish this shit on anyone,

Weâre gonna fall away and burn this to the ground, 
weâve got a choice to make, 
and turn this shit around and if youâre on your own,
look into the sky, all alone, donât let it eat you alive,

So many sleepless nights never knowing what would come of this, 
as soon as you walk back into my life,
you think I care, I never cared, 
Iâll die before I see your fucking face again,

You know you had your chance, 
You know you had your fucking chance,

I can feel it growing in my mind, 
countless hours leaving us behind, 
what was said, what was done, 
I'd never wish this shit on anyone,

Weâre gonna fall away and burn this to the ground, 
weâve got a choice to make, 
and turn this shit around and if youâre on your own,
look into the sky, all alone, donât let it eat you alive.

Itâs not the first time that Iâve seen this shit, 
itâs like Iâm falling no direction and Iâm getting sick of it,
getting sick of it,

Itâs not the first time that Iâve seen this shit, 
itâs like Iâm falling no direction and Iâm getting sick of it,
getting sick of it,

Weâre gonna fall away and burn this to the ground, 
weâve got a choice to make, 
and turn this shit around and if youâre on your own,
look into the sky, all alone, donât let it eat you alive,

You know you had your chance, 
You know you had your fucking chance.
