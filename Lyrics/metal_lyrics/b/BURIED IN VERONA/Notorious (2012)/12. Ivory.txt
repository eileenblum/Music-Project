This passion takes you to the strangest places, 
itâs hard to trace it from the start,

Fearâs no reason to be complacent, 
you discover your soul when you open up your heart,

Pounding drums and cries for mercy
pierce these dreams right through your chest, 
as things go numb you see the clearing, 
December calls again and again,

A life worth living is a life to die for, 
the thunder breaks before the end,
I see you smiling as you close your eyes, 
thereâs no time for goodbyes,
thereâs no time for goodbyes,

When you left this world we were worlds apart, 
the great awake distressed my heart,

Bound by the underworld and covered up in gold, 
the good die young but their memories grow old,

Pounding drums and cries for mercy
pierce these dreams right through your chest, 
as things go numb you see the clearing, 
December calls again and again,

A life worth living is a life to die for, 
the thunder breaks before the end,
I see you smiling as you close your eyes, 
thereâs no time for goodbyes,
there's no time for goodbyes,

Youâve always lived for the life you wrote and now 
Iâm living life and reaching heights for you. 
Can you see me now youâre free, 
are you looking down on me.

A life worth living is a life to die for, 
the thunder breaks before the end,
I see you smiling as you close your eyes, 
thereâs no time for goodbyes,
there's no time for goodbyes
