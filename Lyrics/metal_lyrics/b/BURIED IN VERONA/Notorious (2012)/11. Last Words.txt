Shhh...

All the letters
That you wrote in the end
Imagine what your fucking life
Could've been

All the letters
That you wrote for your friends
We all broke down
Before it got to the end

[Chorus:]
I've never tried to see the truth in your heartbeats
Think back to all the innocent times
You've left a hole inside me so deep I can't breathe
All you've left behind a minefield of lies

You know we always knew
That you had
The right intentions

We didn't have a clue
That you're so far down
And lost all perception

You live your life
How you want to live it
You live your life
Praying for the finish

[Chorus:]
I've never tried to see the truth in your heartbeats
Think back to all the innocent times
You've left a hole inside me so deep I can't breathe
All you've left behind a minefield of lies

I wished I followed you
Back to the time
Where life's the issue

You never had a chance
When your savior's lights
A fucking glimmer on the back of a blade

You live your life
How you want to live it
You live your life
Praying for the finish

MOVE

You died in VAIN

I've never tried to see the truth in your heartbeats
Think back to all the innocent times
You've left a hole inside me so deep I can't breathe
All you've left behind a minefield of lies

Look at this mess you've made...
BITCH

All the letters
That you wrote in the end
Imagine what your fucking life
Could've been

All the letters
That you wrote for your friends
We all broke down
Before it got to the end
