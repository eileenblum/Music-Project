We don't expect the world to pay any favours we knew this life held sacrifice;
no longer leading the life we once had and now we live with no regrets, no regrets! 
Love that we won't give up on old ties made strong: from the years that passed
by. Our dream's seem so vivid now reaching out for a taste of a new beginning.
Sometimes i'm just holding on to all the good times that we've spent, i never
quite knew what they meant. Holding on. I hold my heart to the sun, this dream
is what i've become ever closer. Please don't wake me up! Tides that were set
to sail on, mistakes long gone in a life that was mine, this game plays a heavy
hand. Butt no weight's gonna stop all of us from standing. Sometimes i'm just
holding on to all the good times that we've spent, i never quite knew what they
meant. Holding on. I hold my heart to the sun, this dream is what i've become
ever closer. Please don't wake me up! Stepping out to the cold walking through
though uneasy, left the shelter we all knew followed our hearts to glory. What
becomes of all of us? And it's all on the line, it's all on the line. We lost
all of our regrets, and these stars stuck in our eyes, these stars stuck in our
eyes. We'll break you're arms if you try to push us! You bite you're tongue,
slash your eyes and hold on!
