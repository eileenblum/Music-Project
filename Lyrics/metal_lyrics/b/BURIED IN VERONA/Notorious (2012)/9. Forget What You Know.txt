Dawn upon a new day, 
as for this light it blinds my eyes, 
finding my direction last goodbyes for a dying world. 
Breaking through the habit from all the stories we've been told, 
hiding from the whispers the truth in a lying world,

Save yourself [x3]

So here we go on a mission to find ourselves, 
I hope you never think it's too late for you friends and 
if you donât think that you can make it just push until you break it, 
this is youâre life, 
this is the life that I chose to leave behind,

Go there is another one, 
stop wasting you life you know you only got one, 
finding my direction last goodbyes for a dying world. 
Ask yourself the question is this really what you wanted, 
hiding from the whispers, 
the truth in a lying world,

Open up your eyes, you see beauty where I see pain, 
you're lost in oceans with yourself to blame,

Save yourself [x3]

So here we go on a mission to find ourselves, 
I hope you never think it's too late for you friends and 
if you donât think that you can make it just push until you break it, 
this is youâre life, 
this is the life that I chose to leave behind,

So here we go on a mission to find ourselves, 
I hope you never think it's too late for you friends and 
if you donât think that you can make it just push until you break it, 
this is youâre life, 
this is the life that I chose to leave behind,
