[feat. Ahren Stringer from The Amity Affliction]There is a nightmare upon us
Please wake me up before I meet my fate in this dream
No longer, wish to be apart of
Lets hope day breaks before they hear me scream
Old man can't you see the past is repeating
There's been some hard damn times but this shit is worth saving
There's never been time for a tear in your eye
But I hope for fucks sake that you hurt on the inside

I've tried for so many years
covered up for the younger ears
And now you tell me that its all gonna slip away
All of these sleepless nights hearing loved ones whispered fights
Please tell me where to find my broken hopeless home

I'm tired of searching for all the right words
To change something that is set in stone
And I've been waiting for all my life to see you
Just one glimmer, one glimmer of hope

I'm feeling lost again, so far and I'm losing them
And now you tell me that it's all gonna slip away
I'm scared for the days ahead for the ones that I tried to protect
Please tell me where to find my broken hopeless home.

I'm tired of searching for all the right words
To change something that is set in stone
And I've been waiting for all my life to see you
Just one glimmer, one glimmer of hope

There are pieces of me, spread across the floor
Don't fail me now, now I have it all.
There are pieces of me, spread across the floor
Don't fail me now, now I have it all.

I'm tired of searching for all the right words
To change something that is set in stone
And I've been waiting for all my life to see you
Just one glimmer, one glimmer of hope

There is a nightmare upon us
Please wake me up before I meet my fate in this dream
No longer, wish to be apart of
Lets hope day breaks before they hear me scream
Old man can't you see the past is repeating
There's been some hard damn times but this shit is worth saving
There's never been time for a tear in your eye
But I hope for fucks sake that you hurt on the inside
