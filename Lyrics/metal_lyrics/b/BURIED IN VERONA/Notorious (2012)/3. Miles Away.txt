10 thousand miles away and I'm wounded, 
disheartened, I wish you home to stay, 
now I'm left drained on display, 

would you give it all, 
would you give it all up for me,
and i know itâs cold, 
but I freeze when your not next to me. 

It's loneliness that makes the loudest noise; 
I search for silence day by day, 
only time will tell if anything has changed,

Itâs getting harder to glance out at the sea, 
no walls to stop us, 
just a chance and our destiny,

As I make your winter mine, 
Iâm faced with it, now brace for it, 
just a matter of time before we run out of time, 

and Iâd give it all, 
Iâd give it all up for you, and
I know its cold, but
I freeze when I'm not next to you,

If weâre finished then bring me the colt, x4

It's loneliness that makes the loudest noise; 
I search for silence day by day, 
only time will tell if anything has changed,

Itâs getting harder to glance out at the sea, 
no walls to stop us, 
just a chance and our destiny,

This frostbite on my heart and 
the blisters on my hands start 
to slowly fade away as 
I start to say your name,

This frostbite on my heart and 
the blisters on my hands start 
to slowly fade away as 
I start to say your name,

Iâd never walk away; 
I would never walk away from you,
From you,
Iâd never walk away; 
I would never walk away from you,
From you,
Iâd never walk away; 
I would never walk away from you,
From you,
Iâd never walk away; 
I would never walk away from you,
From you,
From you!
