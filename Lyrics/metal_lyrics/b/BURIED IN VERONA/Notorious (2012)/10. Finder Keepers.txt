Face down, Can't lift my head I'm drowning,
Face down, smile while suffocating,
Face down, Can't lift my head I'm drowning,
Face down, smile while suffocating,

People pretending this world can't stop staring,
I told you I'm perfectly fine, 
everything's changing the dimes on the pavement,
I miss you with all that I am,

Face down, Can't lift my head I'm drowning,
Face down, smile while suffocating,
Face down, Can't lift my head I'm drowning,
Face down, smile while suffocating,

Calling your name out is breaking my heart and,
I'll see you when new life begins,
until then I beg you to stay with me silent,
I know that youâre shadowâs and air,

As you go you tell me everything's ok,
now the days feel longer colour fades to grey,

I lay face down, Can't lift my head I'm drowning,
Face down, smile while suffocating,
Face down, Can't lift my head I'm drowning,
Face down, smile while suffocating,

Youâre getting further away from me and,
I can't be there to catch you,
Youâre getting further away from me,
so scared that fate won't bring you life,

As you go you tell me everything's ok,
now the days feel longer colour fades to grey, [x2]

I think I feel you, I think I feel you here tonight,
I feel your cold breath as your whisper freeze the air,
I think I feel you, I think I feel you here tonight,
I feel your cold breath as your whisper freeze the air,
I think I feel you, I think I feel you here tonight,
I feel your cold breath as your whisper freeze the air,
I think I feel you, I think I feel you here tonight,
I feel your cold breath as your whisper freeze the air,
