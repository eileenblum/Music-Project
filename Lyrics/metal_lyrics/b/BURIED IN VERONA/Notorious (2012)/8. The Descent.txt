If hope lies where the heart is 
I'll start my search from there, 
this world keeps taking pieces even blind men stop to stare. 
There's cracks appearing the oceanâs retreating, 
can't find the words to describe it, it all ends here. 

Maybe Iâve come too far along, 
I've seen the face behind the gun. 
Itâs always been you and me. 
Maybe Iâve come too far along, 
I've seen the place where i grew up, 
this past is haunting me. 

Thereâs one thing you know weâre lost right here, 
thingâs are changing but nothing shows, 
thereâs one thing you know weâre lost right here, 
I can't watch this so take me home, 
Thereâs one thing you know weâre lost right here, 

Theyâll cut your throat for power and bleed you till you pay,
thereâs nothing left to teach you, tears well till you look away. 
There's cracks appearing the oceanâs retreating, 
can't find the words to describe it, it all ends here. 

Maybe Iâve come too far along, 
I've seen the face behind the gun. 
Itâs always been you and me. 
Maybe Iâve come too far along, 
I've seen the place where i grew up, 
this past is haunting me. 

Thereâs one thing you know weâre lost right here, 
it's haunting me
Thereâs one thing you know weâre lost right here, 
it's haunting me

Maybe Iâve come too far along, 
I've seen the face behind the gun. 
Itâs always been you and me. 
Maybe Iâve come too far along, 
I've seen the place where i grew up, 
this past is haunting me. 

Thereâs one thing you know weâre lost right here, 
thingâs are changing but nothing shows, 
thereâs one thing you know weâre lost right here, 
I can't watch this so take me home,

You canât run from youâre own reflection x2
