Adjust my weary bones
And carry me away
The air and the dust
Takes my place

A fatherless son
Guided by one
She takes of her veil
Teardrops hail

And mother don't you cry
And mother don't you cry
Wipe those tears from your eyes
And father don't you lie
And father don't you lie
Watch me as I enter the sky

You've opened up the lion's heart
It's been inside of me right from the start
I'm surprised we didn't end up in jail
We kind of went outside of the rails

We've done this shit all on our own
So far from you and far from our homes
Listen to the words that I speak
Just don't follow if you're getting too deep

I believe in you, it's never too late
I mean this with every breath I take
I mean this with every breath I take

With a heart so big and stars so bright
You're the light in my day and the dark in my night

You pulled out the best in me
Close to my chest you'll be
End to start
You're my lionheart

I remember being pushed all around
From this city to a thousand more towns
Could never seem to stay on my feet,
Might as well erase the people I meet

If I'm here with you then I'm calling it home
From the boy you knew to the man you now know
Listen to this vow that I make
And this promise that I never will break

I refuse to turn out like my old man
Creating kids and having no plans
With the worst of you and the best of me
That's what we'll always be

With the hurt from you and the gift from me
My kids you'll never see

With a heart so big and stars so bright
You're the light in my day and the dark in my night

You pulled out the best in me
Close to my chest you'll be
End to start
You're my lionheart

Holding on
Holding on
Holding on

Holding on
Holding on

With a heart so big and stars so bright
You're the light in my day and the dark in my night

You pulled out the best in me
Close to my chest you'll be
End to start
You're my lionheart

Lionheart
Lionheart
Lionheart
Lionheart

With a heart so big and stars so bright
You're the light in my day and the dark in my night

Lionheart
