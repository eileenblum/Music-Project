[Bonus Track]See this through my eyes

I don't know where to start
I don't know what to think
You know If I could I'd go back I'd fucking change some things
With the hard times worn and read to death
I guess it all depends how and when it ends
I'm caving I'm caving in

Hard times eaten away
At each heartache
Takes a piece of my soul
And it's more than I can take
Times taking its toll
From my mistakes
There's nothing left of me
And now I am
Hopeless

I'm feeling a hold and it's taking its toll
So sad to see but in this story I fold
Such a golden boy now tainted and tortured
But what you sold affected our misfortune for the price we paid
Selling our souls
Surprised if you left any skin on the bone
Take it from me
It can't get worse
All I fucking know is the pain and the hurt

Fractured now and barley breathing lessons learned I'm empty beaten
Compressed with in from all this weight
Finding it hard, no hope no faith
Fractured now and barley breathing lessons learned I'm empty, beaten
Sees the day that you were saved
The deeds are done now I'm hate.
