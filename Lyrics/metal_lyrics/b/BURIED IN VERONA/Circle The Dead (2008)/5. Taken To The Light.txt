Wish we could've had more time to be
Worn the pain more just to see
Your soul reborn again
This is for all those grieving hearts, to stop bleeding
Hope has failed again, they put a time when death will win
And as the blackened cells corrode we whisper goodbye
I just wanted to believe they'd save you
Now only time for us to say our final words
I see deep in your eyes, I feel you letting go
The pain just won't subside, fall back into the light
Someone wake me from this coma's fucking grip
I've sailed too far with a sinking ship
We saw the edge of your life erode away
The end is climbing up your spine
Take what's left, only memories survive
