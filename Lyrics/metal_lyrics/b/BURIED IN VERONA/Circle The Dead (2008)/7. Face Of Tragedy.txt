I hate to see you like this
You're only hanging on by the numbers
Searching through the dark
Cause you're lost in the struggle
Lying in your pain
Fight this
This war has begun
You're last breath is near
Our war has begun
Prepare yourself
Sight and sensation draining away
Your body's turning inside out from corrosion
Don't let it take your soul
Fight this
You know we're safe from time
Always
I'll hold your heart with mine
Always
