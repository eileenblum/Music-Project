Past another constant remind of adversity
You know your scraping the life out of me
I kept it on the inside, I fucking nearly died
I would've dragged all you fucks down to hell
You broke me down
Breaking through this I'm waking to this game
You'll bleed the truth when I'm standing above you
Clear your head, remember what they did
Choose to sacrifice, exact your revenge
Take all the hard roads and earn every step
Life, let it teach you pain
Let it make you stronger
Take your fucking dirt nap
