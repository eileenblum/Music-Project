I will not be a victim
I will not take what's left
And I will not breed the violence
And I will not step back
Will you be there for me?
Will you be there inside my pain?
I will choose the road my life takes
And I will choose only loved ones
And I will choose the fights with meanings
And I will not step back
I will give you nothing
I won't give you any tears of mine
I will give you nothing
I won't give you any part of me
All I am, all I'll be was built inside, It's apart of me
