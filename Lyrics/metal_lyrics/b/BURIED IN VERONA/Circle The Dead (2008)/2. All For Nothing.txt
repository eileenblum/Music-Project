Just try and understand our claims
That your mind can't remain this way
If you just stayed here for the while, and listened
Cause you've got everything to lose
With your pride set you can't be moved
If you just faced us that day you'd be here
You always knew when you walked away
No forgiveness
You never cared what you threw away
No forgiveness
This feels like forever and its eating us inside
With hopes script ending
We will wait for you
