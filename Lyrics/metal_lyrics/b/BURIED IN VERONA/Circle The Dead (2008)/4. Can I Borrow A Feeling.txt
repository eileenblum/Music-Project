You take your chances lying to me
More threats of breakdown with you and me
You're always sorry for tears that stain
Scar tissue spreading, those tears won't fade
You will fade to me
You take all that you needed
Then you threw it all away
So now it's over, you pushed too far
Those dreams that ended seem so far
I'm feeling like a freight train, something coming over me
Needles in my eyelids, scarring up my fits again
I believe in nothing, cause this fucking world means nothing
To you to me any nothing in between
But I won't live the lie, I won't live that charade
I never told you how to be
