Iâd give my last breath to keep your heart beating
Give my last sight on this world for you to see me
If itâs my last song I hope that you could hear it
All the words in the world fail to help express it
Whatâs in front of me is everything I wanna be 
You gave me that shot when no one else believed in me
Iâm writing this to show how much you mean to me
Youâre everything, everyone, to me

All I see is you, you are my inspiration the momentum in me
All you do for me, will not be forgotten you pulled me out of the horror
And saved me
I hope youâre proud of who I am who I decided to be
Save me
Thank you for the life you paved for me that I can never repay

Youâre my antidote 
You are the push, the wind in my sails
