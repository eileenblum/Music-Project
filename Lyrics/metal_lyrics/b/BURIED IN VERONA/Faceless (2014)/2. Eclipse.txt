Now weâre climbing out of the hole

Feeling like Iâm sick
Iâm splitting down the seams
Donât worry everything will be fine
One more time please weâre already dead
Already dead

They say piece by piece Iâm not a puzzle
Come alive with some lines no lies Iâve had some trouble
Sick of last place and the hiding is over
Iâm tired of the tide always taking us nowhere.
Yeah

Undertow sweep me away
Take me under donât let me breathe
Sink my heart into the ocean
While youâre all above me

Blaming everyone
Our bindings loosen up
The friendships come undone
Ever since this begun thereâs been no where to run
I just need you to see the big picture in me

Over and over and over again
Iâm lost and Iâm static
Canât find where to begin
The pages of the book
Need to be written in
Iâll try till Iâm broke
Till thereâs nothing to give
Over and over and over again
The times donât change itâs the same fucking thing
Itâs scratching at a wound and itâs wearing me thin
Iâve never cried wolf
But this shit needs to end
Stuck so long it feels like forever
