Rip your face off

Canât you see the scars
The scars encapsulating 
Everything I was
Holding me back from
Gaining everything Iâve lost
Nowâs not the time to stop, halt or pause
Itâs time to start to find the real me inside and break free

Donât let go, donât ever let go of the dream that you are
We are alive tonight and the fireâs burning bright
So pick me up and breathe
Sing for the moment

Sing it for the life that you love
Sing it for the moment that you dream
Sing it straight to the top up above
out loud and break free, go

Break free this cryptic life
Iâm peeling off the face
Iâll show you whatâs been hiding underneath the screams
Will this be me or just a mask 
For you to see
Love or hate at least you know itâs me
Give me your heart your hand follow me to the end lets go

Donât let go, donât ever let go of the dream that you are
We are alive tonight and the fireâs burning bright
So pick me up and breathe
Sing for the moment

Break free this cryptic life
Find what illuminates you
And in the dark you will find who you are inside

Sing it for the life that you love
Sing it for the moment that you dream
Sing it straight to the top up above
Out loud
We are alive tonight and the fireâs burning bright
So pick me up and breathe (sing for the moment)
And break free, go
