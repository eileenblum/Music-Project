Iâve been shot down
And Iâm falling too fast
Through the air I have found
Iâm exhaling the breath
Of life I can tell
That Iâm running on empty
And I canât tell
If I have what it takes
To brave the woods
Yeah

I wish I could believe
What I have within
Take me back and build
Me up again

Somewhere in my heart I will always be free
Some people just test me
Broken are my bones from the weight of the world
Itâs getting so heavy

Iâm lost again
Iâm still stuck in the cycle of repetition
So I fire the flare and wait for them
Give my position decided
Iâm done with this hiding
Iâll reach for the hand that takes

Graves are just empty holes
You fill with your blood and bones

Blood and your bones
