Believe in me like Iâm never gonna fall in the first place
Tied down like Iâll never run my own race
Fuel feeds the fire I got desire
But theyâre never gonna let us have our own space
If youâre never gonna beat them then u gotta join them
The only problem is holding back a beating for em
The world is a gift and I dream to live
Always getting held back by a mistake
And I know in my heart where gonna keep trying
One day itâs gonna be us on the flip side
Cause itâs in the end that the future bends
Hard work pays off with the dividends so
Believe in me so I can show you the way

Bled this whole world dry
Follow the cash and youâll find the cause
Bled this whole world dry
Minds on the dollar all emotions are gone
Bled this hole world dry
This is so hard to watch

Believe in me you wanna see how far we can take this
Youâre never ever gonna show me where the path ends
Just hard when youâre stopped in your tracks by
Someone with a grudge and fucking a bad eye
Are they misinformed do they just ignore
All the times that we fought to get us this far
And I know you gotta give it all
For the top spot
Think Iâll never break free and get the chains off
You got the keys that we all need
I guess success is only measured when your hands bleed
These scars tell a story of what made me so
Believe in me so I can show you the way

Itâs written on the wall itâs written on your face
Thereâs something more to this youâre taking to the grave
Wish I knew so that secret could be saved
We live once so set us free
