Rip it out
Are we the last thought on your mind
Tonight, this is killing us
Too many times to count we got pushed down, left by the way side
Iâm sick n tired of being lied to might as well just spit it out.

Push
Till the cities are falling down
Fight
Like your life is on the line
Take
All that is owed to you
Life has limits and we live on the edge of them

Breathe
Like you donât have long to be
See
Like your vision will end today
Feel
As if we can live again
Scream so loud that you wake up the dead

Are we the last thought on your mind
Tonight, this is killing us
Too many times to count we got pushed down, left by the way side
Iâm sick n tired of being lied to might as well just spit it out.
Get it out
Rip-it-out

Numb so long but I think I can feel again.

We
Are the ones you love to hate
We
Gave it all for you to take
We
Wonât make the same mistakes
If itâs an eye for an eye where the hell are the rest of them

Went down
Thought we could never get up again
Love it so much that we had to turn it round
Time
All we need is time
Here we go this is it
This is how weâre revived

Scream so loud that you wake up the dead
