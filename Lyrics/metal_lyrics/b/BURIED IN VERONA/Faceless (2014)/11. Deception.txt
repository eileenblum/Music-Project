Youâre facing
The final chapters
Event horizon
Of your world as you know it
Itâs ending
Slowly decaying
The bloods on your hands
Donât repeat the past

No matter what I do or how hard I try
Iâve got nothing left
Iâm over the fight
Youâre just wasting
Time
Youâre wasting
Life
You know youâve lied so much itâs staining your teeth
You never know if you fell
Could you land on your feet
Youâre just wasting
Time
Youâre wasting
Life

Itâs fascinating
To hear the shit youâre saying
Does it help you sleep at night
Your conclusions confuse me delusions you must see
Nothing in this world is free.
Yeah

Canât you see that its tearing the seems
Iâm wearing thin from within your infecting me.
Thereâs certain things that I can not forgive I just hope it all stops so we can start again.

I guess itâs hard to see past the thought of yourself 
You donât know what you have
Never learned for yourself
Youâre just wasting
Time
Youâre wasting
Life
Now I hate to say that thereâs distance between us 
Connections lost our friendships in pieces
Your just wasting
Time
Your wasting
Life
Goodbye
