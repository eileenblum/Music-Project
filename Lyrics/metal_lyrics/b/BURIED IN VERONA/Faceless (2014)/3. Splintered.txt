I feel the cracks splintering through the foundation
Tried moving heaven and earth, but letâs face it
Youâre only feeling alive if you taste death
Create your memories now or die faceless

Yeah I know youâre hiding cause youâre weak
Youâre wasting moments like theyâre nothing but dust in the breeze, do you ever dream
Do you ever think thereâs more to life than this

Never gonna get anywhere like this
Will you ever learn

I try, I try to push harder
Iâm going against the grain
Itâs gonna be hard gazing up at the stars
Looking into forever

You, youâre just a number in this world 
Programmed from the day of birth
You need to find your self worth and live like itâs the last day on earth

The crows finding it hard to resist you
They need their souls born and bred, conditioned
Run boy just as fast as you can
Head for the visions that you dreamt
While you still fucking can
