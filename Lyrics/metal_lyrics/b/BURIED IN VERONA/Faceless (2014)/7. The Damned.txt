Never wanna see the hands of the clock moving back
The bridge has been dammed no forgiveness I canât
You pushed and you pulled while you hide in your hole
I hate all the years that stole from my soul
You are nothing

What you gonna do now
What you gonna do now
What you gonna do now
Youâre dead to me

Take me up, Take me up higher (higher)
Free my world, leave it on fire
And Iâve been waiting my whole damn life
Forever and Iâve come so far
And itâs all Iâve got in me

I never had a chance
When you decided my fate
You overruled all the decisions I made
Never got to see my potential
You said things that were so detrimental
But now I have found my home
Found my home and I wonât go back

You canât take me
No
I never wanna go back

For all the lies you told
Youâre dead to me
For every word you said
Youâre dead to me
For all the silent mouths
Youâre dead to me
All of you
Youâre dead to me
Youâre dead to me
