Catatonic weâre half asleep
Our life flies by us while we find our feet
So lethargic we accept defeat
The flame burns down and the light looks bleak
For me

All of the faces in all of the places sing
I can break down
I break down your walls
Free all the used and
Break all the rules
Till thereâs nothing left, nothing left at all

Broken but Iâm not ready to die
Cause feel, I feel alive,
Alive, alive tonight
Itâs calling
Iâve never felt this before
But I can see whatâs coming

Falling further weâre in a spin
Pull the rip cord and Iâll start again
The shadow darkens its holding tight
Fight it off and reach out for the light
Itâs time

If you found me drowning
Would you just stare
Would you pull me out
Or would you leave me there
Iâm reaching out
Take my hand
I need you now
Give me a second chance

You canât leave me here
You saying what was right from wrong
Conditioned me since I was born
You better pull me out because
You canât leave me here
Another minute more
Iâll never get up off this floor
If I found a way to crawl Iâll walk
You canât leave me here
