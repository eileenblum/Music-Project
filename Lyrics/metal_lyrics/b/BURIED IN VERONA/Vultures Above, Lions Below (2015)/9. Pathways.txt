Who are you talking to
Youâre not welcome to stay
Youâre making me sick
Like a ship in rough seas
I want to bury you
Deep inside
I want to lock you up
In the back of my mind

I'm losing sight of me
But I can't help myself
God knows the things I've done
When I dragged my life through hell

This demonâs out to get me
Pour the poison down my throat
And itâs breathing in the air I'm
Slowly choking on my ghosts

I know you have the key
Ruin whats left of me
According to you
I'm nothing anyway
I want to bury you
Deep inside
I want to lock you up
In the back of my mind

When the bottle hits my lips
I can't stop till I'm a mess
I thought this was my release
From the sorrow and the grief
Whatâs inside of me
Whatâs this side of me
Whatâs inside of me
Whatâs this side of me
