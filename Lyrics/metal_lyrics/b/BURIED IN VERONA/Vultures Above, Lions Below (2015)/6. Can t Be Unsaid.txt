Iâm letting go

You need to fall
Before you learn how to fly
You know Iâve made mistakes
But I tried
Iâve lost everything
No price I can pay to begin again
Just go

Iâm letting go of who I am
Iâm running towards the ocean
Drown the thoughts that weigh me down
Iâm letting go
Iâm changing now
Back before the voices
Twisted up and tore me down
Iâm letting go

Blame me
Blame who you want
This lifeâs too short to right the wrongs
We just hurt the very thing
That has carried us
With a life to live
Just go

Can we move through this struggle?
Can we push past the pain?
Can we all climb this mountain?
Can we do us again?

Iâm letting go of who I am
Iâm running towards the ocean
Drown the thoughts that weigh me down
Iâm letting go
Iâm changing now
Back before the voices
Twisted up and tore me down
Iâm letting go

I know the truth
And the skyâs falling down
Lies coming out, Iâm done
I know the truth
And the skyâs falling down
Lies coming out, Iâm done

Iâm letting go of who I am
Iâm running towards the ocean
Drown the thoughts that weigh me down
Iâm letting go
Iâm changing now
Back before the voices
Twisted up and tore me down
Iâm letting go
