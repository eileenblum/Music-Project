Would you take away all of the graves
That litter my mind till this day
Would you clear a path through the trees
Or are you just gonna walk away?
Donât leave me here this way
Take me back
Where this began
I swear to God I used to love these lights
This city is darker
Ate me alive
Should have known theyâd protect their hive
Open me up
Climb inside
Take what you want just remember whatâs mine
Take my heart
Take my eyes
Take my soul and feel the other side
Vultures above
Lions below
Nothing like waiting to see how you go
Do I fight this?
Do I fight this?
Hands are tied
Behind my back
Belief in me, the only thing I have
And itâs fading
Slowly eroding
Tired of the people and all the commotion
See the finish line
But I canât feel my legs
See the checkered flag but thereâs no gas left
And Iâm sinking
Iâm sinking
Vultures above
Lions below
Nothing like waiting to see how you go
Do I fight this?
Do I fight this?
Take me
I want this, I donât want you
I need this more than you do
White doors are slowly closing
I lie awake just hoping
