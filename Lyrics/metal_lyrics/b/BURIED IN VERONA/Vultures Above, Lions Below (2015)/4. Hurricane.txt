Don't let your heart give way
âCause it just might be the last time
You can take it
I know the past has been cruel
But thatâs a hurt you remember
And you can use it

Letâs keep marching on
Letâs all keep marching on
Push aside all the broken times
Break away and leave the past behind

Hurricane take us away
Spit us out and start again
Far away from all the wasted life
We've seen
Hurricane take us away
Leave behind our misery
In the wake of the destruction we have seen

Will you look back on your life
And know you did all you could
To live alive be happy
Don't let the past bring you down
Mistakes are lessons you learn from
Just pay attention

Did you crawl did you claw did you fight back
Did you walk did you hit did you fight back
Did you push till it cracked did you fight back
Did you love just enough to get love back

Letâs keep marching on
Letâs all keep marching on
Push aside all the broken times
Break away and leave the past behind
