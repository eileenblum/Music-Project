To take the only rise of wave
Where would it lead or where would it stay
The wake of no more eyes to crave
Only to flow away from the day
Forsaken all that bled to say
And with them be held in liquefied grave
Call of the land lost
Soul was aghast and thus
I've opened a path from watered grave
Cold betrayal
With the river flows the lesser souls of hell
So the river holds me as well

Like bathing in ash
The burnt flesh on everything
Drowning in skin
Again and again
The blindness of water
The wretched grip, a womb
The strangling beast
I'm breathing to sleep
I'm breathing to sleep

Awake
Drowning in skin
Blinded by water
Breathless, cold
A silent death
Closing my eyes

The violence of being
The waves I'm breathing
An emptiness that's tethered
The distance of forever

So take the only rise of wave
To where it would lead or where it would stay
The wake of no more eyes to crave
Only to flow away from the day
Forsaken all that bled to stay
And with them be held in liquefied grave
So take the only rise of wave to where it
Would lead or where it would stay
