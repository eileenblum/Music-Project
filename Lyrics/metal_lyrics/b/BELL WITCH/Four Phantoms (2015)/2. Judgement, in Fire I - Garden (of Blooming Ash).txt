Lungs
Full of ash
Silence of flames
The heat, everything wanes
The air clouds and wraps
The world in silent ash

Wrapped
In eyes of thorns
The skin that I'd worn
I'll wrap
My eyes in wrath
An endless path
I am
The blooming ash

Take my arms
For rain
Wash it through
In flame

The air
A looming trail
Through ever and past
This garden of
Floating ash
