[Part 1]

The moments repose
Awoke eyes of ice
In vision froze, froze
The melting world
All is around
But within is barren, is barren

Drying the water
Anchor me in ice
Mirror of the reaper
The arrow of my eyes

If time were fleeting,
The heralds to let go,
But time is water
Freezing as it flows

Slow, beating pendulum
Don't measure time
I'll sink the heavens
While reaching for the dawn

Seven eyes sewn open, bestows
As above, so below
Water mirrors and the stillness growsâ¦

Into seven more (unseeing)
The bondage throne
The waves that shore
Two thirsty hands
Sewing a needle of blood
To bind me
To bind me
Weaving the ocean

Through which I flood
The heaven of blood
To bind me
I'm bound to
Waves
The waves of no shore

Floods that sleeve
The reach of the drought
To bleed evermore
Empty me
Empty me
Ash of the ocean
(Sewing)
To bind me
(Sewing needle of drought)
To bind me
(Weaving)
Weaving the ocean
(Weaving pendulum)
Hanging, weaving the ground
A breathless fabric of floating ashes
Tied, and then rewound

[Part 2: The Words Of The Dead]

Reigned,
(Weaved in the needle)
The cycle turns around
Air, burnt to ashen mountains
(Weaving the ground)
Swimming underground

Pendulum,
Silent gavel
(Of time)
It's burning in the sky
