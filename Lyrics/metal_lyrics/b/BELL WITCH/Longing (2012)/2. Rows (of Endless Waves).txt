Flood, flood, denied
Echo of suffering
Hold (blue) ghost

The lay of the land
Won't see where you stand
On waves far from sand
On them you tremble

And master of rains
Sends liquefied grains
To ride ocean pains
To nowhere at all
And nothing to borrow
And nowhere to follow
Nowhere at all
Nameless and frayed...

Rows and rows

Winter of life to know
Beating hearts on stone
Pulsing out in rows
Carve my eyes in stone
Hang my skin in rows
Weathered like a throne

Suffer
And drowning
No hope for existence
Breath blood

If they would beach you these waves of destruction
Would only collapse you and leave you to lie
On peasant tread landing where you'd have a hand in
The death of a million for only a lie where strengthened you'd try
To torture the masses and sink them in chains to
This river enslaving that never runs dry
Death wielding reach of rehumanised fingers
That grasp as they bludgeon the helpless that writhe if only to cry
If they would reach you the stain of destruction
Would flow on as endless from landing so wide
And battles would rage you and war would not fail to
Drain blood from the masses and leave to lie where death circles high
Where plundered the buildings and burning the forests
You'd rage drunk with power and cripple the wise
So here we will leave you on waves far from shore
Fleshless and barren these waves to enslave you so your victims can rise
