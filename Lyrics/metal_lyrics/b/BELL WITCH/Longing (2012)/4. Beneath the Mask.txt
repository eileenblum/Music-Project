[The dialogue is sampled from the scene in "The Masque of the Red Death" (1964 film) when Prospero meets the Red Death in the Black Room.]

[Red Death:] Prospero. You command me to wait? Very well. I wait.
[Prospero:] Condotti? Rimini? Who are you beneath your mask?
[Red Death:] Is my costume such a disguise that you don't recognize me?
[Prospero:] Your voice is familiar. Dr. Bernelli, that's who you are. Bernelli, you dog, thinking to... You are not Bernelli.
[Red Death:] No. The doctor dances in the white room. But I passed close by him. Truly, Prospero, you don't know me?
[Prospero:] So you've come.
[Red Death:] Yes, Prospero.
[Prospero:] [To Francesca] On your knees.
[Francesca:] Prospero!
[Prospero:] [To Francesca] On your knees. [To Red Death] The Prince of Darkness. I would like to see your face.
[Red Death:] There is no face of death until the moment of your own death. And I am only one of many messengers.
[Prospero:] Who do you come for?
[Red Death:] Many.
[Prospero:] All?
[Red Death:] Not all.
[Prospero:] I knew I was right. I knew it. I've won.
[Red Death:] The time of unmasking. They begin to show their naked faces.
