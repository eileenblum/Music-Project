Cold empty space
Need to touch (present life)
Thy life is none
For thy soul burns

Hate for will
My grief will be avenged

Bailing the grass
Flaying
Timeless grasp
Flaying
Smolder the bones
Horror on the stones

Roped hands
Are raking air
Slight of life

Fate stands
Its wicked snare
A needle of life

Bail me
Like rows of hay
A needle of life

Cold... hate...

Cold empty space
Hate for will
For thy soul burns
They grief will be avenged
