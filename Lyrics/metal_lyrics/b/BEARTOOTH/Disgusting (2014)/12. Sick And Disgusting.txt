Remember the time you said, "Son, it'll be alright."?
Remember the time you said, "Son, it will be just fine."?
Well, I'm waiting for the day that my mind says it's had enough
And I pray that day comes soon so I can finally feel loved

I just wanna feel loved
I just wanna feel loved

Remember the time I said, "God, I'm ready to die."?
Remember the time I said, "God, just take my life."?
Remember the time that I cried every single night
And every thought about myself was out of spite?

Sick joke, sick joke, that's all I'll ever be to anyone
Sick joke, sick joke, that's all you'll ever be to anyone
I'm nothing but sick and disgusting
I'm nothing but sick and disgusting

God, I don't know if I'll ever be ready to die
God, I'm too much of a coward to give you my life
And I know that I'm still gonna cry every single night
But if you want me I'm gonna stay here and fight 'til you say, "Son, your heart is mine."

Dad, I don't wanna be sick and disgusting
Daddy, I don't wanna be sick and disgusting
Dad, I don't wanna be sick and disgusting
Dad, I don't wanna be sick and disgusting
