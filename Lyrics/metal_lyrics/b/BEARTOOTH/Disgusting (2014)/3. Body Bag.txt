One life, one decision [x2]
Make sure it ends with you still living

(1...2...1 2 3! Go!)

How does it feel at the bottom of the barrel
All your friends don't care no your friends don't care at all [x2]

Rejected rejected 
You're never gonna be the one respected
Infected infected
This is the way that every life is ended 

No, no this life won't swallow me whole [x2]

If I could set the clocks back
I wouldn't be headed for a body bag
One life and one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Feel like I'm on the fast track
To laying face down from a heart attack
One life and one decision 
Make sure it ends with you still living

One life one decision [x3]
Make sure it ends with you still living

You're never gonna touch the surface
I sure hope it's worth it
You can lie to everybody around you 
But you can't lie to the hole inside you

No, no this life won't swallow me whole [x2]

If I could set the clocks back
I wouldn't be headed for a body bag
One life and one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Feel like I'm on the fast track
To laying face down from a heart attack
One life and one decision 
Make sure it ends with you still living

One life one decision [x3]
Make sure it ends with you still living

If I could set the clocks back
I wouldn't be headed for a body bag
One life and one decision
Make sure it ends with you still living
Feel like I'm on the fast track
To laying face down from a heart attack
One life and one decision 
Make sure it ends with you still living
