Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Oh!

Can you go the distance, I don't wanna see
Can you make a future, without maturity
I'm doing fine as far as I can see, so go ahead and keep your american dream
I wanna live my life to the fullest, make the most out of being young
And when I'm laying down on my deathbed, I'll be proud of every story told

Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Have you had the same mentality since you were just a kid?
Can you ever face reality growing up so quick?
It's either hard at work, or hardly working at all (At all)
It's either hard at work, or hardly working at all (At all)

I don't wanna purchase what you're selling, please will you accept my written apology
Listen close to the words I say, when I'm old and I'm deaf you'll still be hearing me
I have one life to live, and I want true happiness
I have one life to live, and I want true happiness

Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Have you had the same mentality since you were just a kid?
Can you ever face reality growing up so quick?
It's either hard at work, or hardly working at all (At all)
It's either hard at work, or hardly working at all (At all)

Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Oh!
Yeah, yeah!
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Oh!

Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Go ahead and keep it, go ahead and keep it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
Have you had the same mentality since you were just a kid?
Can you ever face reality growing up so quick?
It's either hard at work, or hardly working at all (At all)
It's either hard at work, or hardly working at all (At all)
Go ahead and keep it, I will never need it
Go ahead and keep it, I will never need it
Go ahead and keep it, I will never need it
Go ahead and keep your american dream
