Am I the son in or out of law
How many chances do I get before my head explodes

What's going on 
What's going on
When I look into the mirror there's another gun

When I tell you I'll be fine 
I still want you by my side
Please just try to read between the lines
Where's my comfort in the undefined
Please just try to read between the lines 

If I'm your son do you hear my call
Even if everything I touch will slowly turn to stone

What's going on 
What's going on
When I look into the mirror there's another gun

When I tell you I'll be fine 
I still want you by my side
Please just try to read between the lines
Where's my comfort in the undefined
Please just try to read between the lines

What is the poison inside of me
The sickness in my head
Put me to sleep while I find a cure for the sickness in my head

We are the sons
We are the daughters
The generation of disorder 

What is the poison inside of me
The sickness in my head

When I tell you I'll be fine 
I still want you by my side
Please just try to read between the lines
Where's my comfort in the undefined
Please just try to read between the lines
