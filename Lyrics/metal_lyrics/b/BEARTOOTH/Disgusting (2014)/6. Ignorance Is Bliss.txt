Pick up the pieces
Fix my diseases

I'm tied down to my bed
Wanna get out but I can't commit 
Dead spirit dead spirit
Lethargic lethargic

Wake me 
Wake me up get me out
Shake me 
shake me till my neck breaks 
Hit me 
Put your fist in my chest
Give me 
CPR before I'm dead

Pick up the pieces
Fix my diseases

Staring at the ground while I'm walking lately
Haven't seen the sun in a week and it's killing me
Depression has its grip trying to keep me sick
Medicated but still not thinking freely
I haven't eaten in a week and it's killing me
There's a darkness in my soul but I will never be controlled 

Ignorance is bliss isn't it

When your house is empty
They moved out they moved on
But you don't even notice
Cause you're busy being dead in your room

Wake me 
Wake me up get me out
Shake me 
shake me till my neck breaks 
Hit me 
Put your fist in my chest
Give me 
CPR before I'm dead

Pick up the pieces
Fix my diseases

Staring at the ground while I'm walking lately
Haven't seen the sun in a week and it's killing me
Depression has its grip trying to keep me sick
Medicated but still not thinking freely
I haven't eaten in a week and it's killing me
There's a darkness in my soul but I will never be controlled 

I'm not
I'm not one of your demons [x2]

Ignorance is bliss isn't it
