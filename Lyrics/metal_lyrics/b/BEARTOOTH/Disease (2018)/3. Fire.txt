Save your breath it's all turning into static
No chance you're winning this fight
Kill the lights and let's do a little dancing
Hope you came here ready to die

Sink a little lower
Get a little higher
Finger on the trigger, scream ready, aim, fire
Sink a little lower
Get a little higher
Finger on the trigger, scream, ready, aim, fire

Oh!
Yeah!

I'm running out of answers, I've lost my head
I've pushed all of your buttons and you want me dead
Tossing and turning and blowing smoke
Hope you're ready for revenge 'cause I've had enough

Sink a little lower
Get a little higher
Finger on the trigger, scream ready, aim, fire
Sink a little lower
Get a little higher
Finger on the trigger, scream, ready, aim, fire

Save your breath it's all turning into static
There's no chance you're winning this fight
Kill the lights and let's do a little dancing
Hope you came here ready to die

You're running out of time and your voice is blown
You've lost all of the power now you've lost your home
I make the decisions, I chose my path
I'm sending you to hell and I won't look back

Sink a little lower
Get a little higher
Finger on the trigger, scream ready, aim, fire
Sink a little lower
Get a little higher
Finger on the trigger, scream, ready, aim, fire

Save your breath it's all turning into static
There's no chance you're winning this fight
Kill the lights and let's do a little dancing
I hope you came here ready to die

Finger on the trigger, scream, ready, aim, fire

Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire

Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire

Save your breath it's all turning into static
No chance you're winning this fight
Kill the lights and let's do a little dancing
I hope you came here ready to die

Finger on the trigger, scream, ready, aim, fire
Finger on the trigger, scream, ready, aim, fire
