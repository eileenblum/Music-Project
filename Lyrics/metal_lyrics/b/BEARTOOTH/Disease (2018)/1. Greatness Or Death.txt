I promise you there's times I'm not so sad
Some days the good will even out the bad
I know I'm married to my problems, it's always in my head
And I'm destined for greatness or death
Destined for greatness or death

Thought I was standing tall
Repressed with no resolve
Happiness and ignorance aren't so different after all

Thought I was being strong
This time you're in the wrong
I've lived a lie too long
I've lived a lie too long
Now push has come to shove
I signed the deed in blood
I need another drug
I need another drug

I promise you there's times I'm not so sad
Some days the good will even out the bad
I know I'm married to my problems, it's always in my head
And I'm destined for greatness or death
Destined for greatness or death

Thought I could make demands
Now I can barely stand
Comfort quickly fading with the sickness setting in

Now push has come to shove
I signed the deed in blood
I need another drug
I need another drug

I promise you there's times I'm not so sad
Some days the good will even out the bad
I know I'm married to my problems, it's always in my head
And I'm destined for greatness or death
Destined for greatness or death

I'm beginning to think I can't outrun these demons
But you know what they say, sickness is in season
Yeah!
Sickness is in season

I promise you there's times I'm not so sad
Some days the good will even out the bad
I know I'm married to my problems, it's always in my head
And I'm destined for greatness or death
Destined for greatness or death

Sickness is in season
Yeah!
Sickness is in season
