Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Make me believe it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Make me believe it

I'm stuck in December
In the middle of summer
Tried finding the answers
In the end we're all just lost and alone
We don't know where to go
So we sing
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I've got a weakness now
Gotta wait the season out
My vendetta's with the evening
God knows I am never sleeping
I've gotta weakness now
Saying it will all work out
I'd give anything, anything, anything
To make me believe it
Make me believe it

I'm watching the snow fall
Every day when I wake up
No matter where I go
In the end we're all just lost and alone
We don't know where to go
We're all just lost and alone
We don't know where to go

I've got a weakness now
Gotta wait the season out
My vendetta's with the evening
God knows I am never sleeping
I've gotta weakness now
Saying it will all work out
I'd give anything, anything, anything
To make me believe it

I've got a weakness now
Gotta wait the season out
My vendetta's with the evening
God knows I am never sleeping

I've got a weakness now
Gotta wait the season out
My vendetta's with the evening
God knows I am never sleeping
I've gotta weakness now
Saying it will all work out
I'd give anything, anything, anything
To make me believe it

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Make me believe it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Make me believe it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Make me believe it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Make me believe it
