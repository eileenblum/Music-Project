This is manipulation

Yeah!
Yeah!

I hesitated, got lost again, you saw me as wounded prey
I was a wreck, I was a bloody mess and you couldn't look away

You broke me down
So you could take me out

This is isolation
Kept in the dark and waiting
You're wearing the crown of kingdoms I created
Now I can't escape it
All of the light is fading
This isn't trust, this is manipulation

I didn't say what you wanna hear and your lips began to curl
I'm pushing back and now you start acting like you gave me the world

You broke me down
So you could take me out

This is isolation
Kept in the dark and waiting
You're wearing the crown of kingdoms I created
Now I can't escape it
All of the light is fading
This isn't trust, this is manipulation

I don't need, I don't need, I don't need you
This isn't trust, this is manipulation
I don't believe, don't believe, don't believe you
This isn't trust, this is manipulation
You've got hell to pay, you'll get what's coming to you

Oh!

This is isolation
Kept in the dark and waiting
You're wearing the crown of kingdoms I created
Now I can't escape it
All of the light is fading
This isn't trust, this is manipulation

I don't need, I don't need, I don't need you
This isn't trust, this is manipulation
I don't believe, don't believe, don't believe you
This isn't trust, this is manipulation

This is manipulation
This is manipulation
