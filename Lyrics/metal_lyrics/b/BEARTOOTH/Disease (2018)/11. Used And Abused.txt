All hail to the old king
To a dead scene
To the same old trash, never washed clean
Undying
Not changing any time soon

Turn another page let the bottom feed
Poisoning the ground when you plant the seed

I'm not part of your institution
Is your trust some grand illusion
The pressure's building, gotta find my way through
I'm not part of your institution
Is your trust some grand illusion
It's paralyzing being used and abused

Used and abused
Used and abused
Used and abused

I'm done trying to reset
I'm a reject
Cut off at the knees from a misstep
Can't come back
Don't even care if I die

Chain my ankles up, throw me out to sea
Benefit the world, hide the apathy

I'm not part of your institution
Is your trust some grand illusion
The pressure's building, gotta find my way through
I'm not part of your institution
Is your trust some grand illusion
It's paralyzing being used and abused

I don't have a home
I don't fit your mold
You can't push me out
Take me to the battleground

I'm not part of your institution
Is your trust some grand illusion
The pressure's building, gotta find my way through
I'm not part of your institution
Is your trust some grand illusion
It's paralyzing being used and abused

Used and abused, used and abused
The preacher's building, gotta find my way through
Used and abused, used and abused
It's paralyzing being used and abused
