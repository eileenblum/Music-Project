You say my vision's not a vision at all
There's no degree in rock and roll
Say it's a waste of time, say I'll never get a real shot
I'll be banging my head 'til my brain rots
I'll be banging my head 'til my brain rots
Oh!

I feel the energy from my head to my feet
Is it anger or passion empowering me
I know talk's not cheap I'm not grinding my teeth
Time to slap you in the face with reality

No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf
I'm just a real bad listener

No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf
I'm just a real bad listener
No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf
I'm just a real bad listener

We've been deceived by the powers that be
We're sold future perfection but it will not come cheap
Maybe I love it, I'd rather believe
I'm just breaking the surface and you will never stop me

No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf
I'm just a real bad listener

No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf
I'm just a real bad listener
No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf
I'm just a real bad listener

You say my visions not a vision at all
There's no degree in rock and roll
Say it's a waste of time, say I'll never get a real shot
I'll be banging my head 'til my brain rots

No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf
I'm just a real bad listener
No structure
No prisoners
I'm not deaf
I'm just a real bad listener
