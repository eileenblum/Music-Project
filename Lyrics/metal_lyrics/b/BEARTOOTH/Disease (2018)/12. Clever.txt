I guess being clever's just my safety net

I hide behind my cadence
I hide behind the wall
I built so tall the weakness never spills
I hide all of my burdens
I twist my words so well
I'm breaking but the lie is what I sell

If I'm clever you might never understand
I feel like death and me are walking hand in hand
When my happiness is hanging by a thread, I finally feel content
I guess being clever's just my safety net
I guess being clever's just my safety net

I tell you I feel better
I tell you I can sleep
I hope that it will bring a sense of peace
But all the night's are getting darker
The day becomes so bleak
Another day I'm conscious is another day I bleed

If I'm clever you might never understand
I feel like death and me are walking hand in hand
When my happiness is hanging by a thread, I finally feel content
I'm so messed up and inconsistent in my head
I feel my passing only benefits my friends
When I know nothing I say matters in the end, I finally feel content
I guess being clever's just my safety net

I'm out of ways to answer
I'm out of metaphors
I finally got so sick there is no cure
I'm out of ways to answer
I'm out of metaphors
I finally got so sick there is no cure

If I'm clever you might never understand
I feel like death and me are walking hand in hand
When my happiness is hanging by a thread, I finally feel content
I'm so messed up and inconsistent in my head
I feel my passing only benefits my friends
When I know nothing I say matters in the end, I finally feel content
I guess being clever's just my safety net
I guess being clever's just my safety net
