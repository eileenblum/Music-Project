When did it get so hard to listen? When did my ears go numb?
Maybe if thinking followed speaking, I'd understand my native tongue.

PICK YOUR POISON!
CALL YOUR BURDENS!
PICK YOUR POISON!
IGNORE YOUR PURPOSE!

We don't wanna live if we have to give up our comfort! (Woah-oh).
The problem isn't you, it's just in your one another. (Woah-oh).
Why don't we think the same, when our opinions change?
I know what I want, and I want NO! (One).

This is the same old song and dance, 
Crying out give me another chance.
It's pretty hard for me to learn my lesson.
When I push the limits 'til I'm BARELY BREATHING.

PICK YOUR POISON!
CALL YOUR BURDENS!
PICK YOUR POISON!
IGNORE YOUR PURPOSE!

I'm not useless! I'm not useless!

We don't wanna live if we have to give up our comfort! (Woah-oh).
The problem isn't you, it's just in your one another. (Woah-oh).
Why don't we think the same, when our opinions change?
I know what I want, and I want NO! (One).

I'm NOT USELESS, I'm JUST THE KING OF EXCUSES! [x6]
