We knew that this one is ours.
We came we saw we conquered
We knew that this one is yours
Close the doors and shut it down
We hope that this one will burn
Deep into the hearts that need it the most
Calm down and don't sweat it kid
Your heart is hard to hold when it's beating like it is
Bang the drum the saints go marching in

We are vagabonds
And we are not the ones to brandish our scars
And steal the light from your eyes
Take it in, Its not to much to see
The air is clean, wipe your tears away (away from your eyes)

You stand alone wont you sing along with me
Open my chest up, my heart beats for you
Give your pulse to me

One second more, the second hand is ticking down
We're running out, that bloody hand is killing time (Murder)
No you where meant to be, don't let this moment get you down
You are so much more then you ever thought you where
Replace the dark with light in your eyes

Sleepless nights in these cheap hotel's
Upside down in dirty cafe spoon's
This is all we know
Tracking time by passing exit signs
Double yellow paints the great divide
Vultures wait it's not our time to die (We have till twelve)
This moment's ours to stoke the vision burning in our hearts
Control the blaze would be a grave disservice, we will be heard
We stand together voice's strong, our message let it burn
If arson be the claim, I'll be the match you be the flame
Judge and jury hear them say (It's starts tonight)
You stand alone won't you sing along with me
Open up my chest up, my heart beats for you (Give your pulse to me)
Tracking time by passing exit signs
Double yellow paints the great divide
Vultures wait it's not our time to die (We have till twelve)
