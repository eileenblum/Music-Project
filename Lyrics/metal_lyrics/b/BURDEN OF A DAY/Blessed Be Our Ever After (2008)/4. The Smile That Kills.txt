Iâm still so glad youâre here
Letâs make the most of the time we share
Iâm still here
Dancing so long
Singing my song
Wearing so well
A smile that kills
The glamour that holds
My soul at will
Check me out
Mirror oh mirror on the wall
Whoâs the fairest see them fall
Whoâs the fairest of them all
The sick relation
Of what weâve come to know
This congregation
Of our fine feathered souls (Weâre gonna fly)
We have the comfort
We have the comfort of
Weâre here today and gone tomorrow
Itâs time to play so let it all go
So hold on tight
Weâre in for the ride of your life
Weâre gonna play it over and over again
We find ourselves here
So far from home
Our eyes have tall tails
Dark lines have shown us
So turn your eyes dear
Donât watch my heart fade
Just dim the house lights
And like we all have said
It was worth all the while
The sick relation
Of what weâve come to know
The congregation
Of our fine feathered souls (Weâre gonna fly)
We have the comfort
We have the comfort of
Weâre here today and gone tomorrow
Itâs time to play so let it all go
So hold on tight
Weâre in for the ride of your life
Weâre gonna play it over and over again
Your place is here in our hearts
