Heart stops when in love
Time slows down
When youâre young at heart
Your tragic love was lost
And now your eyes start to fade
âNow itâs overâ, but itâs just begun
The chapters ended
But the book has not been read
The story starts when you can
Iâm calling out to you 
Can you hear me
Just believe
See the lights they will never fade
Heart stops when in love
Time slows down
When youâre young at heart
Keep pushing further
Keep pushing further and further
