To see elation
Spread across your timeless face
Be proud of me
Proud of what I tried to become
Regardless of our heavy hearts
Weâll carry on weâll carry on
Regardless of our anxious thoughts
On how we think it might all end
The land is dead
Our backs are bent
Our eyes have turned from gray to red
Still the villages are crying out
What do they have to sing about
Are you gonna be with me
I can hear them singing through the night
Donât be dancing with the devil 
In the pale moonlight
I can see the towns from way up here
The little lights are burning brightly
And getting stronger
The children singing made up songs
But they sound so familiar
The sonâs so familiar
How long must we wait
How great thou art
Weâve been looking for connection
Can we all break free from this
The situation the undercurrent
Stop pulling me further and further away
God will not be called dead
He will show himself strong
In due time
