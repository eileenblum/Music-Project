Come blue dark sky please take to me
Outside my window sill
For I have wandered aimlessly
The sky is gated
I've lost the key
I need the sound of your voice
Remind me of my dreams
My shadows playing tricks again
Dancing on the walls
If only I could believe tall tales
The pixie dust would fall

The dust would fall
The dust would settle, settle 
The dust would settle, settle 
Settle, settle 

You took the stairs
And missed the fall
You took the stairs
And missed the fall
To play it safe or risk it all

You live your life in the darkroom
With photos of your friends
Unable to step outside
Afraid the anvil's gonna fall
Save yourself
The pain of loss
No broken bones
But no twinkle in her eye

These sticks still burn
They burn like home
These sticks still burn
They burn like home

This is forever and a day
I feel like I will be okay
This is forever but today
I feel like I could be a kid again.

Raise your hands up to the sky
The expression on your face
This moment in time 
Feels like forever and a day

This could be so much more than it ever was
So much more than it ever was
So much more than it ever was
So much more 

Would you please step up to the edge
Close your eyes and just let go
You said it couldn't be done
I said it'd never been done
Put your faith in me 
I promise you just one thing
I'll never let you
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you
I'll never let you go

Because we are the lost boys
Forever in Neverland
Would you be our leader, be our leader
And take me by the hand?
