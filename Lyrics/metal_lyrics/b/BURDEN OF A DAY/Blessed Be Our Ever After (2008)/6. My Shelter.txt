Go to a safe place
Escape the same fate
Go to a safe place
So you can save face
They stole your halo
Under painted skies
And like an angel
With the devil in their eyes
This city loves you
Why did you have to go
This city loves you
What happened here
Weâll never know
To kill the monster
That has never shown itâs face
This ghost that haunts you
Left an imprint that you canât erase
Hit the lights and lock the doors
Under blankets weâll stay warm
Hit the lights weâll brave the storm
And bleed forgiveness till its gone
Be still stay low
I know weâll make it out
Be still and know
That God knows your worth dying for
Burning questions without an answer
God still knows your here
