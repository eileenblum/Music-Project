Ring the bells and kick the doors down
Because this is what you wanted
And this is what youâre gonna get
So we have made a monster
Well so be it, so be it
Light the torches and bring a pitch fork
The lightning has already struck
Itâs alive
Burn the village down
We will dance in ashes
Please forgive us our misconception
Weâre burning hot
With the thought of something weird going down
Youâre standing out
Youâre out of place out of line
Get back in line
With one wary eye
And a corset for vigilante recourse down the line
So itâs alive
Itâs best for all
If t stay in that house upon the hill
Give up the monster
Bring us the monster
Is it the unknown that haunts you
Or the lightning that flows through my veins
Am I the monster
Or am I just misunderstood
I fell the sun on my face
Is that the air I can taste
My beginnings I canât erase
But Iâm alive, I am alive
Hereâs a toast for the lost cause
We will bring the giant down
Give us the monster
Bring us the monster
