Here we go!
Would you paint me something pretty
This bloodstained canvas wreaks of failure
Colors are smeared by turpentine 
Grasping to every written word youâve ever said 
Toy soldiers
Weâre guided by childrenâs hands

Running faster
Faster, faster 
Weâre ticking time bombs counting down and setting to explode
Bursting forward
So misguided 
Iâm sorry dear
Wonât you dry your crying eyes tonight?

Before this happened we were hidden still
Deep in conversations with ourselves
Would you take me someplace beautiful, beautiful?
So distinct I wonât come back
I wonât ask for more

Running faster
Faster, faster 
Weâre ticking time bombs counting down and setting to explode
Bursting forward
So misguided 
Iâm sorry dear
Wonât you dry your crying eyes tonight?

Our last request
Our last request
This is our last request
It's all that we've been living for
This is our last request
It's all that we've been living for

And this will be our cry
Weâll run until we die
Until we die
Body bleeding
Bruised and beaten
Still we cry
Weâll run until we die
Until we die
