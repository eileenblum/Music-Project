We set our sights on something
That's just beyond our reach
It's not what we expected
We will bleed
We won't stop this
We will not let it go
We wont stop we're not letting go
We wont stop we're not letting

We felt the fire in our hearts
Burning with the thought of living on and on and on and on
You set us apart
We won't lay down and die tonight
Die tonight
Worth something
We're something now, something now

You can kiss and tell but we won't back down
You can kiss and tell but we won't back down

We can feel you in our heart 
You will lead us in your steps
We can feel you in our heart
We can feel you in our hearts

We're not dead yet 
we are still alive 
but not tonight 
we'll die some other time
[x4]
