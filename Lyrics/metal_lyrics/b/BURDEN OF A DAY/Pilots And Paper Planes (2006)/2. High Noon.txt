With contrite hearts on the blackest of days
We've done our deeds but now we have to pay 
The social call; the presidents not home 
The gossip line "we never would have known"

I awoke to the sound of singing in the streets [x2]

The sorrow fell like the setting sun 
On dusty streets the sound of running in our heads 
As we hung like leaves from the trees 
Shooting from the hip we live our lives so precariously 
Breathing deeply for the last time I can see 
The lights shining just for me... 

Built to last 
This winters going to end 
The sun will shine on our faces 
Life begins... 

Swing low, Sweet chariot 
Carry me home [x2]

Ride till sunset leave it all behind [x2]
and go 

Cowboys never die [x4]

Built to last 
This winters going to end 
The sun will shine on our faces 
Life begins... 

When life ends life begins [x2]
Again and again.
