the guests have gone
our hearts have beaten with the last song sung tonight
resilience coursing* in our veins
we're picking up the pieces as we watch them fall

like a cannonball 
we watch you fall
[x6]

bury me deep in this mausoleum
bury me to my neck so i can't feel my limbs
we're not going to make it
not this time
when you say that could you look me in the eye

let's paint this town in a sheet of red
and burn like passion in our hands
[x3]

we'll burn with passion
we'll burn with passion

we'll burn
come on baby!
and just let it go


[*Note: in the cd cover, it reads
"resilience RUNNING in our veins",
but you can clearly hear "coursing" in the song]
