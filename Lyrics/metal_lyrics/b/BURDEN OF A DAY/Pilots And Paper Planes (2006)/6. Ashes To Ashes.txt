âTil we die
With a separation of life and limb
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Keep moving on from what we know went wrong
Time is precious
We donât have long
Take full advantage
So we will live and wonât look back
To keep our dreams alive
And we will live and not retract
For what we feel will die
With strength of heart
Weâll push our passion on and on

[Spoken]
Why do we cry such bitter tears for life that is no longer ours
With dirty faces and mud-caked shoes
We dance to be different but we are all the same
Take us to a place where envy ceases to be green 
and the color red covers all our sins and blacks out our eyes

With no regrets
Live today with no regrets
With a song in our hearts and breath in our lungs
Our eyes burn with vision
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down
