We are lost in a sea of faces
The registry has lost our places
Can we find where we belong tonight
Say it isnât so
We have no place to go
Through the snow
The numbness in my bones
The weatherman was wrong again today
I feel like I donât belong here
I canât breathe in this air
As I look up to the sky at night
There must be a better place for me
As my throat closes tight
The words
This is not my home
We canât go home
This world is not our home
