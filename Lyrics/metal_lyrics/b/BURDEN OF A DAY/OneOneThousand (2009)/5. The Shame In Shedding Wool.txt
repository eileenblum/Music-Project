What wonderful strides with these legs
What a taste on these on lips
With these ears I hear a thousand sirens sing

Just a bit further
This skin It wears so well
With each step loosing wool
Be weary of the woods (no)
Be weary of the woods

This pasture is much too bright
I need to shield these eyes and make my way to the shade
Make a line for the trees

The only sing
To burn the forest down burn It down

Come one come all and bring what you've been fleeting from (come home come home)
Come as you are and know you are loved
We wait with grace while you flee the sun

I heard the sheep cry out like wolves

Bring me to heard
I've been cold wandering alone leave me alone

Come one come all and bring what you've been fleeting from (come home come home)
Come as you are and know you are loved
We wait with grace while you flee the sun
We wait with grace as you flee the sun
Spoonagain gotcha

Come home come home come home my love

I heard the sirens cry
When their voice fell on deaf ears
While sheep they sang as one hallelujah
