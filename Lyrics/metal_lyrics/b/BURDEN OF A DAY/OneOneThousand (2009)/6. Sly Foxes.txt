We watch the waters rise
And let the tides come up to our neck

With pride taking on the ways (on the ways)
Screaming over and over again
I never lie I swear I can swim
I never lie there I go again

What have we become I feel like we have just begun
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best
I swear I'll never let go
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best

Oh we are so smooth
The way you speak the way I move
Seek all you want you'll never catch me
Jesting the hare consuming the feast
Seek all you want you'll never catch me
Jesting the hare

I will shake the earth
Oh we are sly sly foxes
This love will find us where we hide 
This love will find us where we hide (we hide)
This love will find us where we hide (we hide)
Focus I want you at your best

What have we become I feel like we have just begun
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best
I swear I'll never let go
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best

Hold on be strong stay steadfast you are your fathers son
Be still for the lion and lamb will lay as one

What have we become I feel like we have just begun
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best
I swear I'll never let go
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best
