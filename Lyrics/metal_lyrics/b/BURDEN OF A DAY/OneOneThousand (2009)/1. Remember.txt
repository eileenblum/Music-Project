[featuring Kendall Knepp]

They chased us to the end of the dock
Stay with me we can outlast night
Just stay awake I know we can
I know we can make It out alive
Make It out alive

We outlasted evenings and I barely breathed
How couldn't I see how couldn't I see

Don't turn your eyes if you leave now
You won't remember me
You weren't meant to do this on your own

No I feel the water is calling
The wood under our bare feet cries
Every animal came to watch
The first and last to love die

What a wretched man I am
Who will rescue me from this body of death

Don't turn your eyes If you leave now
You won't remember me
You weren't meant to do this on your own
Just stay close and I'll keep you from leaving
Just move slow and I'll keep you breathing

They chased us to the end of the dock
Stay with me we can outlast night
Just stay awake I know we can
I know we can make It out alive
Make It out alive

Mother mercy the sea's swallowed my graceful
I have failed you I've been too late

Don't turn your eyes If you leave now you won't remember
You won't remember remember me
(You won't remember)

Don't turn your eyes if you leave now
You won't remember me
You weren't meant to do this on your own
Don't turn your eyes if you leave now
You won't remember me
You weren't meant to do this on your own
Just stay close and I'll keep you from leaving
Just move slow and I'll keep you breathing
