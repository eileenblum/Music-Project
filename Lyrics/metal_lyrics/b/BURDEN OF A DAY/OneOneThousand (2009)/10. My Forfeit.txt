Oh I oh I
I'll sing to you I'll sing to you
What will age you young doe
Oh I oh I
I'll sing to you I'll sing you home
What will wise us

I'll go through this after you wake then begin again when you fall asleep
There's still light where you are and you my dear were not made to waste away
I saw the storm reach from the sky to the ground
As dark as the day was bright
I can't go into this alone

My body will fall before I let you down
I know all about your weeping heart

Oh I oh I
I'll sing to you I'll sing to you
What will age you young doe
Oh I oh I
I'll sing to you I'll sing you home
What will wise us

When I am weathered and beaten, should I fall?
And I'll bow myself before your heart

My body will fall before I let you down
I'll make you proud before I love again
Oh I oh I
I'll sing to you I'll sing to you
What will age you young doe
Oh I oh I
I'll sing to you I'll sing you home
What will wise us

How shameful we've become left a child to untie sailor knots and eye the cresting rocks
(Am I the one to choose)
How shameful we've become if we overlook the captain's cries we'll never kiss the shore
(This isn't what I choose)

My body will fall before I let you down
I know all about your weeping heart
My body will fall before I let you down
I'll make you proud before I love again
(And how shameful we've become)

My body will fall before I let you down
I know all about your weeping heart (and how shameful we've become)
My body will fall before I let you down (and how shameful we've become)
I'll make you proud before I love again (and how shameful we've become)
