Such suffering and sickness
From a moment of ecstasy
As your skeletal and noxious body ceases to live
With this ever growing infection
Death claims you

Diseased, you didn't know your lover was diseased
So hot to get laid, indulge in unprotected sex
The one you have intercourse with hosts a virus
Infections blood tainted with HIV
Passing the contagion on to you
You are now a member of the modern epidemic
Intact health was only a condom away
But you let your guard down for a fatal fuck
This terminal illness wears your body down
A virus destroying all of your antibodies
You are now so susceptible
A blood test of positive now revealed
Covered with skin eating fesions
AIOS hungrily grows at your immune system
Your T-cell lymphocytes destroyed
Fatal condition kills slowly
Too weak to move, breathe, or ever get aroused
Running ulcers and abscesses wrap your body
Quarantined to your death bed, you stick to your sheets
The disease has developed to a most sever state
Ashes to ashes, genitals to jelly
Your personal gender soon to fall oil

An erotic flower decayed at the roots
Latex could have kept your sex life intact
Now never again to be hard to wet
Discharge and drip genitourinary loakage
Reproductive organs butchered and raw
The risk for gratification is your epitaph
Ignorance is bliss and eventually death
You never gave much thought about tomorrow
But now as you struggle to try and breathe
Yesterday is always on your mind now
And what ever happened to you lethal lay?
Death through sexual transmission
You make love to the grim reaper
This day and age sex kills
Unknowingly lusting after your demise
Desire plummeting into the venereal depths
A coital union with cankerous effects
Toxic passions, the rapture kills slowly

Skin is in
Ashes to ashes, genitals to jelly
Melting in syphagonnaherpeaids
The black plague of the 20th century
Careless promiscuity
Skin is in
Diseased disguised behind a beautiful face
Your terminal venture too late
Syphagonnaherpeaids

Your body cannot summon enough protection
Against this ever growing infection
Ravaged by AIDS abominable symptoms and effects
Death claims you through virtual sex

An incurable doom from lethal lovemaking
Such suffering and sickness from a moment of ecstasy
As your skeletal and noxious body finally ceases to live
Your lamed mate is begging another victim
Death through sexual transmission
You make love to the grim reaper
Turned on, so anxious to get your rocks off

Skin is in
Ashes to ashes, genitals to jelly
Melting in syphagonnaherpeaids
The black plague of the 20th century
Careless promiscuity
Skin is in
Diseased disguised behind a beautiful face
Your terminal venture too late
Syphagonnaherpeaids
