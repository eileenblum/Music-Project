There are things that happen
To certain people when they're finally dead
Many never end up resting in their deserved casket bed
Cadavers in the wrong hands
Can come up for grabs
Join the countless corpses
On the mortuary auction slabs
The dead become a hot commodity, ready to sell
Merchandise on a market straight from hell
Price tags
Replace morgue tags

Vacant coffins buried
No one will ever know
As the wealthy gather
The bidding soon starts
Top dollar paid for human body parts
The auction is a success
Every bidder gets a piece
The gavel cracks loudly
Setting more of the deceased

The auctioneer shrieks as the bidding escalates
Unsold limbs lay on the selling block awaiting their fate
Vital organs in working order
Rake in the greatest cash
Physical merchandise drains each monetary slash
Price tags
Replace morgue tags

Vacant coffins buried
No one will ever know
As the wealthy gather
The bidding soon starts
Top dollar paid for human body parts
The auction is a success
Every bidder gets a piece
The gavel cracks loudly
Selling more of the deceased

For the eccentric, there is a black market
A death-dealing auction for the upper class jetset
Upon a necro-there the sale is based
Catering to every odd and strange taste
Bids and transactions for items of flesh
Purchasing quickly, as the dead lay fresh
Great sums paid for pieces of the dead
Highest price paid may take a complete head
Price tags
Replace morgue tags

Vacant coffins buried
No one will ever know
As the wealthy gather
The bidding soon starts
Top dollar paid for human body parts
The auction is a success
Every bidder gets a piece
The gavel cracks loudly
Selling more of the deceased
