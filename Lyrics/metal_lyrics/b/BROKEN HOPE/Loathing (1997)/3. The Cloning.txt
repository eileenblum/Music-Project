A new world order created by the goverment
An unimaginable force of their mindless soldiers
Their primary objective has now been put in place
A movement to eliminate every creative thinking mind
As every nation is beaten down and famed
Our world will be given up to a dominating regime
A new, absolute power of unmerciful rule
They suppress every quality that makes us human
They will consume and scorch the entire globe
Through subliminal programming brainwashing and mind control
A bastard race to rule with blood soaked iron fists
With totalitarianism they squash their opposition

A regime based on domination and enthropicide
We must not yield to the superpowers that mold us
They want us passive, with no individuality
Conscienceless clone troops mow down and try us
We are nothing more than livestock to model a new race
To be neutered and conformed
Reproducing pseudo-beings that look exactly like we do
The clones are replicas of you and I
Our very features and physicalities mocked up for reproduction
The human race replaced

There may be a solution, it's our one glimmer of hope
True patriots must find the strength within themselves to fight
We must cut the cloning at it's bloody roots
This is our only chance if we are to stay human

We must not allow the cybernauts to take our place
By killing the commander in chief and his cabinet
Final result weed out the weak
World domination modern tyrants seek
Old decrees snuffed out and lost
Cloning begins, global holocaust

Weak minded slaves bleating in terror
Like millions of sheep
Step out of line and you will disappear
Persecuting, torturing and killing
Authoritarian figureheadds with take faces
Forever to govern, reap and clone
