His saintly robes removed
Pushed face down upon the floor
Legs kicked apart, hare-ass in the air
A fistful of hair yanks his head back
He supposedly pardons us for every sin
But can Jesus forgive those who desecrated his body?
Incarcerated inside a Roman prison
Jesus would soon find His feminine side
They parted his buttocks like the Red Sea

Carrying His cross as blood ran down his leg
The bitter taste of asthetic discharges upon the palate
Imprisoned disciples witnessed the irreverent crime
But the bible will never acknowledge the debauchery
In lock-up he was unable to spread the holy word
Because irreligious penis' clogged His immaculate windpipe
The guards laughed at the Messiah's screams
No angels came to bring Jesus deliverance

A handful of inmates would make the Nazarene their bitch
Sexually frocing Him to open His holiest orifices
Never tell the truth of the Lord's molestation
The anointed deep throating, anally plundered, and crucified
Did His wounds really heal?

Carrying His cross as blood ran down His leg
The bitter taste of asthetic discharge upon the palate
Imprisoned disciples witnessed the irreverent crime
But the bible will never acknowledge the debauchery
In lock-up he was unable to spread the holy word
Because irreligious penis' clogged His immaculate windpipe
The guards laughed at the Messiah's screams
No angels came to bering Jesus deliverance

He was raped
He was raped
He was raped
The reaming of the Redeemer
He was raped
He was raped
He was raped
The penetration of God's Son
He was raped
He was raped
He was raped
The violation of the Savior
He was raped
He was raped
He was raped
Christ sodomized for our sins

He supposedly pardons us for every sin
But can Jesus forgive those who desecrated His body?
The most heinous offenses to ever disgrace the Lord
His pain and humiliation echoed through heaven
As hymns of gospel sing of his greatness
