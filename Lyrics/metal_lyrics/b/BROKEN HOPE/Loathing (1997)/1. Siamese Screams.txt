Ovum begins to split
But it doesn't separate
Now during fetation
Unique transformation
Two people welded together
Two identical people are born as one
Bonded together in a unbody hell
This pair will grow up and live
With two heads and four arms

Siamese screams
Of their despair
Conjoined life is too much to bear
To be separated, they long to be
Tremendous blood and pain
May finally set them free
Permanent union
Bodily emcumberance
Into adulthood

Irreversible junction of sibling unity
The very rarest example of duality
Two minds apart with individuality
But never to be apart in reality
Crippled and hemorrahaging
Excuciating
Miserable biformity
In the throes of agony
But never to be apart in reality

Anatomically incorrect
One body with two souls
United as one
A mutual split
Will eventually take place
Four hands with cutting tools
Unskillfully slicem the arms hack and carve
To separate themselves
Mangling the one body they share
Disfigured duet screams

Irreversible junction of sibling unity
The very rarest example of duality
Two minds apart with individuality
But never to be apart in reality
Crippled and hemorrahaging
Excruciating
Miserable biformity
Into the throes of agony
But never to be apart in reality

Splayed out in a pool
Of self immolation
Still connected by a twisteed spinal cord
Unsuccessful in dividing
Fused together by a cruel creator
Fleshy ties that bind
Mutilated fingers
Twitch and wriggle on the floor

Irreversible junction of sibling unity
The very rarest example of duality
Two minds apart with individuality
But never to be apart in reality
