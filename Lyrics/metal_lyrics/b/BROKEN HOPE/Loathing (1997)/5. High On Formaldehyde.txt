Inoculating my body with morticians liquid
To achieve an unearthly undead high
Addicted to embalming fluid
I raid a funeral parlor workshop
The substance abuse will leave me internally intact
Becoming internally mummified
My veins and arteries harden
My entire body twitches and tingles
I become rigid, anesthetized and cold
I experience a rigor mortis high
Every joint and muscle stiffens
This incorrect and excessive use
Will lead to an eventual overdose
Unsterilized syringe quickly inhects
As uncut chemicals flow and infect

My habitual tendencies put me farther in my grave
Enslaved by a substance that I embrace
In love with this ghoulish elixir that slowly kills me
Soporific sensations, I hallucinate till all is black
My numbing brain soon cools
And my languid heart slows to a stop

My moribund body now takes a new trip
As I hallucinate into the afterlife
Stoned, I feel the sensations of the dead
Habitual use of this concoction
Embalmed as I breath never to rot away
Intravenously traveling to my grave

My habitual tendencies put me farther in my grave
Enslaved be a substance that I embrace
In love with this ghoulish elixir that slowly kills me
Soporific sensations, I hallucinate till all is black

I mainline, narcotized as formaldehyde
Eats my blood
My body fluids evaporate
All that is left is the precious fluid
This incorrect and excessive use
Will lead to an eventual overdose
Doped up on this elixir for the dearly departed
Necro-narcosis, high on formaldehyde
