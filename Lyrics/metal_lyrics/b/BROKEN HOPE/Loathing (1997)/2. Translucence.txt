She cannot explain her metamorphosis
Her human condition is almost devitalized
Refusing to eat, strong will to last
Anorexia forces her body
To react in eccentric ways
She's so skeletal, severely attenuated
Normal expectations
From mainourishment
A lucid ligurine, this weakened thinning woman
Her ribs show clearly
And lungs inhailing oxygen
Muscle structures and subculaneous organs visible
"What is happening to me" she gasps aloud
Her moans drift from withering pains
She observes vibrant blood
Flowing through her veins

My anorexic whore
A thinning corpus
She looks into herself
As if she's staring thourgh glass
Translucent skin, collophane pigments
Mutated, dilated pigments
Dermis layers transparent
"What is happening to me" she gasps aloud
She looks into herslef as if she's gazing through glass
A glass ligurine...

Her flesh is a pane into which I stare
Her beautiful bowels I now perceive
Her skin cannot hide\What tangible matter lies inside
Her body eats itself
Draining nourishment from every pore
She only wants to possess
Exterior shapely loveliness
I can easily see her soul

My anorexic whore
A thinning corpus
She looks into herself
As if she's staring through glass
Translucent skin, cellophane pigments
Mutated, dilated pigments
Dermis layers transparent
"What is happening to me" she gasps aloud
She looks into herself as if she's gazing through glass
A glass ligurine...
