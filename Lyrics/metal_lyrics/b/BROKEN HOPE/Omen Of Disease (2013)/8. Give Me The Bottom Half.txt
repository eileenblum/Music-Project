[Music: Wagner, lyrics: Wagner]

Above her waist, there's nothing worth defiling,
The head arms and breasts are all wasted and buried,
Girlie bits below the hips captivate and seduce me,
Her lovely legs compliment holes I contaminate.

I ravage only one of two equal parts; I have that I need,
My glass half-full with her lower trunk,
A pair of loosened orifices in this post mortem wreck,
My cock eases in like a hot blade through butter...

Give me the bottom half, the only part I crave.

The taint connects the targets of my appetite,
The gluteal-cleft divides and orgiastic smorgasbord,
I grip the fleshy tatters of her butchered pelvis and rum
Again and again I violently plunge into my fuck toy

Give me the bottom half, the only part I crave.
Give me the bottom half â to rape, wreck, and ruin
