[Music: Glass &amp; Wagner, lyrics: Wagner]

When we met, the bitch said that she had crabs,
But this fact didn't faze my sex drive at all,
But it wasn't her snatch that held these parasites,
Her gut hosted clutches of sinister crablets.

A uterus packed with horrors, crab-things in the making.

Her considerable gut, undulated and rippled,
Too horny to fucking care I ignored this odd detail,
I fucked her pregnant hole deeply from behind,
Her distended belly grew bigger as I thrusted.

Swollen womb held unnatural broods that shouldn't be,
Sperm injected to fertilize monstrosities,
Crustacean kin are birthed they swarm and devour me.

Evolutionary fuck up made these monsters,
Woman impregnated with crustacean babies,
The hatchlings pop upon contact with my spunk.

A uterus packed with horrors, crab-things in the making.

Protruding optical stalks that possess their father's eyes,
First feast is a man, as I'm their daddy and their prey,
Human faces, exoskeletons, eight legs, armored chelae,
Ravenous mouths and razored teeth cut me down to size.

Swollen womb held unnatural broods that shouldn't be,
Sperm injected to fertilize monstrosities,
A uterus packed with horrors, they swarm and devour me.
