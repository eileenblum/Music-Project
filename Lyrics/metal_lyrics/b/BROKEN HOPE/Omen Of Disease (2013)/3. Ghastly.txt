[Music: Wagner, lyrics: Wagner]

A distorted freak, extremely ugly, ill made by perverted gods,
Repugnant blemishes colonize my corrupted flesh,
Ghastlyâa horrid blight upon the eyes,
External covering of rocky barnacles, and obscene pustules,
A tumor laden fungus, replaced my skin,
Ghastlyâa horrid blight upon the eyes.

Pimply boiled covered face
A gash and polypus, filled mask of repulsion.

GhastlyâI could turn Gorgons into stone,
Hideous down to the marrow in my bone,
Ghastlyâa horrid blight upon the eyes,
Look and see where beauty up and dies,
GhastlyâI could turn Gorgons into stone,
Hideous down to the marrow in my bone.

My toad-like cankered tongue,
Moistens rows of jagged and rotting teeth,
Putrid pores leak foul fluids,
Contaminate everything around me,
Ghastlyâa horrid blight upon the eyes.

I am the epitome of uglified, and the impure definition of nauseating,
Revolting dorsal bumps, bulging carbuncles flesh rising from my back,
Diseased and flawed, swollen furuncles erupt with pus.
