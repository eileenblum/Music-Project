[Music: Wagner, lyrics: Wagner]

Entity from the afterlife enters our living world,
A powerful hunger to rape unsuspecting mortals, 
The malevolent ghosts usurps with unholy desire,
An unearthly attacker assaults from the afterlife.

A sadistic spirit haunting holes,
Paranormal cock penetrates souls,
A spectral phallus drills to orgasm,
Defiles with lubricating ectoplasm.

It debauches and abuses and you never see it,
A terrifying, formless being preys on the living,
An evil ghost possessed with sick perversions,
Invisible, yet the violating hardness is no dream.

A sadistic spirit haunting holes,
Paranormal cock penetrates souls,
Disembodied wraith takes and makes resistant orifices yield.

Living beings open wide like an invisible speculum was at work,
Supernatural, lustful spectre, from shadows plunges into flesh,
Violated cunts and assholes gape free from nothing perceptible.

Victims bitten and beaten from out of nowhere,
Vicious attacks a prelude to spooky stupration,
Unseen hands restrain to spread the vulnerable,
A phantasmic erection manifests to sodomize.

A sadistic spirit haunting holes,
Paranormal cock penetrates souls.
