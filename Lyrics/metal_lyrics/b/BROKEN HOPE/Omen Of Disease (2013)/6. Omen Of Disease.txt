[Music: Glass &amp; Wagner, lyrics: Wagner]

Infected blood rains down with frogs,
An amphibious, crimson deluge,
Black clouds of locusts and flies,
Choke every molecule of impure air.

Skies darkenâa prelude to pandemic,
Infected precursorsâoblivion septicemic.

Rotting livestock, poisoned water,
Witness dark and inauspicious signs,
Boils and cankers eat human skin,
Pestilence delivered, ravages us all.

Skies darkenâa prelude to pandemic,
Infected precursorsâoblivion septicemic.

Omenâ¦I am the omen of disease,
Omenâ¦I am the omen of disease,
Omenâ¦I am the omen of disease,
Omenâ¦I am the omen of disease.

Black death and leprosy,
upstarts to morbidity,
Ebola's hemorrhagic quickness,
Harbingers of eternal sickness.

Omen of diseaseâ¦
Omen of diseaseâ¦

A reaping coming for us all,
Mortal flesh heir to necrosis,
Premonitory offerings of sepsis,
Apocalyptic pyorrhea bile.

Skies darkenâa prelude to pandemic,
Infected precursorsâoblivion septicemic.

Omenâ¦I am the omen of disease,
Omenâ¦I am the omen of disease,
Omenâ¦I am the omen of disease,
Omenâ¦I am the omen of disease.

Horrific threats and warnings, yet eyes refuse to see,
Impending plagues and cankered gods wield lividity,
Super virus contagions, we're already dead.

Omenâ¦

I am the omen of disease.
