[Music: Wagner, lyrics: Wagner]

I was spawned by man's blood-thirst design,
An impetuous birth into a culture of violence.

Carnage is my name â I'm hardwired to kill,
Plunging forever into glorious heaps of gore,
Carnage is my name â seas of blood i spill,
The reaper of mankind / hear me fucking roar.
Murderous purpose to eradicate my species,
Indiscriminate mass murder in my days work.

Carnage is my name â I'm hardwired to kill,
Plunging forever into glorious heaps of gore,
Carnage is my name â seas of blood i spill,
The reaper of mankind / hear me fucking roar.

Unextinguished avarice to slay the human race,
I'm apocalypse incarnate and internecine defined.

Massacre by my hand no one will live,
Slaughter is the gift i give.

Just imagine our planet soaked red with blood,
And the mountains of corpses piled to the sky.

Carnage is my name â I'm hardwired to kill,
Plunging forever into glorious heaps of gore,
Carnage is my name â seas of blood i spill,
The reaper of mankind / hear me fucking roar.
