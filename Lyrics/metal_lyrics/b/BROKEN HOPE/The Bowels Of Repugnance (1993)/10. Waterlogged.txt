In the deep underwater I am sinking,
Water, H2O, soaking my pores,
Lungs filling with fluid, impairing,
Struggling beneath the surface for oxygen,
I cannot, for my life swim to save myself,
Plunging beyond the surface into an aqueous tomb,
Submerged I spiral down to the darkest fathom,
Screams are merely bubbles from my lips,
Skin and organs swell from saturation,
Bursting vessels in my body,
Saturated, disfigured and swollen,
Caught by the current there is no escaping,
Lodged under a log entangled in seaweed,
Sand encrusts every orifice,
Covered with silt in an unmarked watery grave,
Settling upon the bottom I lay upon the sand,
Fish gnaw away at my lips,
Crustaceans dine upon my swollen flesh,
Within this underwater world,
Surrounding me, smothering thee,
I suffocate, ocean my fate,
Beneath each wave, I've found my grave,
A sodden corpse, waterlogged.
