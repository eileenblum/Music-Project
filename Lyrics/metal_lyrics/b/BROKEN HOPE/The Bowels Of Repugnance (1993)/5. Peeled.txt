Take you with my skinning hearth
Strap you in my restraining chair
Clean and hone my instruments
Then the torture will begin
Blood drips off your finger tips
Drool sags down from your chin
Eyes roll back and jowls clench
I vigorously carve and peel your skin
Chunks of skin fly through the air, nauseating pool of piss
And blood evolves beneath the chair
As you struggle to stay alive, I'm overwhelmed by laughter
I split your scalp spreading it apart
Pull your face below your neck
From muscle and flesh your skin I've pried
Grizzly apparel fitted to my size
Finger pointing in your blood
Rolling in piles of guts
Polish and buff your skull
Nail your scalp to my wall
Grind your bones into dust
Cannot stop till all is mush
I save tattooed skins
Gallons of blood line the floor
