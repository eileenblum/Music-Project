Serrated penis cuts through the anus,
Sandpaper tongue tickles intestines,
Cravings for blood, fetish for feces,
Canines inserted, gurgling semen
Suckling sweat, semen and blood
Cold, clammy hands probe virgin cunt,
Felching rectal semen,
Feasting on the purity,
Vaginal blood bubbles within thee,
Virginity gone, no longer pure,
Purulent cunt soiled forever,
Razor sharp nails carve down your back,
Blood and semen stream from swollen crack,
To get the right mixture, a must is patience,
A joyful needling anal lacerations,
Hindquarters look to be gnawed by rats,
Drained of all fluids, just an empty sack,
Relish milky waste,
Scratch kick and bite to no avail,
Try to squirm out of my grasp,
I like to sit back and watch you bleed,
In your buttocks is where I'll thrust my penis,
Lying on the ground as pale as a ghost,
Like a parasite I suck blood from a host,
Feasting is over, time to lay back and rest,
Stomach settling, starting to digest,
Licking my lips, the meal is over,
Grinning as I wonder who'll be next to bend over.
