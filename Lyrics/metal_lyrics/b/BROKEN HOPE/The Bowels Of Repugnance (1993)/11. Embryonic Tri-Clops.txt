Rotting fetus - Blackened uterus - Look close and see,
This world's impurity, our fault
Pollutions here, sky blackened no longer clear,
Atmosphere becoming cancerous,
Fetus' growing rancerous, goddamn these pregnancies,
They shall breed on disease.

Earth's become sour, stripped and torn,
New age of man is being born,
Infecting pollution never seems to stop,
Within the womb embryonic tri-clops.

Foul seed will fertilize, rancid egg shall specialize,
We shall become extinct, because we never think,
Soon conceive a twisted enormity,
Birth to a gibbering deformity.
