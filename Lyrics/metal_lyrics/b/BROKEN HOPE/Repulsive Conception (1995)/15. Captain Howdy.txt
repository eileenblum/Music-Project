[Twisted Sister cover: part of a "Horror-Teria" off of the album "Stay Hungry" (1984)]

Oh, it's so nice to see you all inside my dreamy little world
And it's so nice to be with all you lovely little boys and girls
Make yourselves comfortable
My place is so devine
Don't you think I'm wonderful?
Say yes! you're on my time

Stay away
From captain howdy
Stay away
From captain howdy

Don't try to leave the doors are locked and only I have got the key
Forget the windows they're nailed shut and boarded up
So you can't see
You'll love the light show
Oh, I'm sure you'll think it's swell
When they go off
Your welcome to my living hell

Stay away
From captain howdy
Stay away
From captain howdy

Come here my sweet
Let me help you with that
There that's better

I'm overjoyed at all the games I'm playing here with you today
But I'm so sad the party's over and we can no longer play
You think you're going home
To your own little bed
But that's impossible
You can't sleep when your dead

Stay away
From captain howdy
Stay away
From captain howdy
Stay away
From captain howdy
Stay away
From captain howdy
Stay away
From captain howdy
Stay away
