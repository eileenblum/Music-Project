A universal movement begat from the dark side of music
Creating images of evil, horror and worlds of death
A genre for the true who strain against conformity
It devastates, laying waste to pathetic corporate norms
A musical form so horrible, glorifying corporate norms
It adopted the name of expired life

The ugly, dark side of melody in a subterranean home
The relentlessness of death metal and extremes of grind
Are only for the macabre who possess a unique frame of mind
The naive and ignorant simply take it, take it for face value

But they cannot ignore what's stabbing them
And for those of you who deny your unwholesome origins
May you choke to death on your hypocrisy
Is your ego that inflated that all integrity is lost?
Whenever you are faced with your own deceit
Your insincerily will shine through your plastic personality
The ugly, dark side of melody in a subterranean home

The relentlessness of death metal and extremes of grind
Are only for the macabre who possess a unique frame of mind
The naive and ignorant simply take it, take it for face value

It's all about roots, origins from the nether
Who to the spurious who have forgotten
This type of music offers no compromise
Pummeling with a force that few can fathom
It takes a certain fortitude to comprehend
The heaviest from of music known to man
Open
