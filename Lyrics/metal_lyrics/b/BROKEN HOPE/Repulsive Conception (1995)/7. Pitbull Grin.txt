A beast spawned from a deadly lineage
Maiming impulses descend
Instilling urges to mutilate
Tiny brain only programs rage
Horrendous jaws bite down on your wetting crotch
Unrestrained chompers bite clean to the bone
Lips curl back to reveal a pitbull grin
You run to escape the impending slaughtercide
Unfortunately you won't get far at all
Brutish jaws locking down, never let go
With a rabid instinct it viciously shakes you apart
Fierce teeth flash as it furiously growls
Soon you will feel the agony of its piercing jowls
Easily it rips out your soft, fleshy throat
It bites your naked face and goes berserk
Bones break friend is a canine nightmare
Blood lust is the nature of this beast
It only knows its own intercine ways
Torn and biting like a human chew-toy
Lips quivering, curling back, revealing a pitbull grin
It relentlessly pounces with inhuman aggression
Tooth and nail gouge making you a masticated mess
The dog backs away as you lay and die
It can now take its time to play
Your terminal distress is the pitbull's amusement
It possess a very sick sense of humor
But before you endure any more pain at the teeth of the animal
Your luck comes in as your bloodless heart stops
Your punctured eyes take in one last fanging sight
The threatening attack of a snarling, toothy muzzle
As lips curl back revealing a pitbull grin
You run to escape the impending slaughtercide
Unfortunately you won't get far at all
Brutish jaws lock down, never let go
As lips curl back revealing a pitbull grin
