Within my body I can feel the heat
Fire shoots from my hands and feet
Out of nowhere I combust in a flash
My fevered flesh burns with a blazing rash
From the inside out I now explode
Intense internal heat now takes hold
Smoke billows out of my ears
I flick a fiery tongue that sears
My simple touches burn and scorch
A fiery flaming human torch

My entire body excretes fire
Reduced to a smoldering pyre
My body involuntarily burns me away
Cremating myself in a most bizarre way
Spontaneous human combustion
Intense corporeal eruption

Shitting napalm in a pyro-diarreah slick
Ejaculating acrid lava from my flaming prick
I self-ignite, can't stop the burning
A human furnace seething and churning
Flammable blood, blazing fuel in my veins
Excruciating sensations of the burning
Repeat Verse and Chorus
