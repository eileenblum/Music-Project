Most think when death comes,
That spirits are judged,
These cheap beliefs can bum in hell,
Hopeless truth dying time comith,
Spirits become my prey,
Satisfying my unholy appetite,
Within me all are equal
Being eternally digested.

[CHORUS:]
Death is the unknown goal,
When you are deceased,
I devour your soul

Some souls may become free,
But limbo is a dark ocean,
And I the shark only time,
Before I bite and feast,
Then another soul eternally digest,
Into this dark gods gullet of the damned,
Afterlife unfortunately is just
Another different hell.

[repeat chorus]

Forget your savior I am the only salvation,
Afterlife hell, now prepare for the miserable duration,
For the newly dead black bells begin to toll,
As the unholy god of agony devour's another soul....
