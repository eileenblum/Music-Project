Inside a canvass bag a horrid shocking find,
Butchered body parts atrocity of a worst kind,
Decapitated head severed hands and feet,
Jellyflying organs decomposed rotting meat

Bag
Bag of body parts
Full of rotting parts
Bag of body parts

Floating in a lagoon a putrid revolting sack,
Water helps preserve flesh facial features intact,
Limbs sliced sawed broken and bodly torn,
Flesh cut poorly the blade was dull and worn.

Pieces members and organs thrown into the bag,
Emanating noxious odor makes one gag,
Disposal the motive why the bag was brung,
Ribcage cleaved and split removing each lung.

Bag
Bag of body parts
Full of rotting parts
Bag of body parts

Beheaded disemboweled extracting each eye,
Chopped to pieces is a profane way to die,
When vile acts seem to end a new one always starts,
Repulsive discovery this bag full of parts.

Custard mortis film bacteria newly fresh
Algae from water deteriorates the flesh

Body parts litter this dark lagoon,
Grisly remains other ones shall surface soon
