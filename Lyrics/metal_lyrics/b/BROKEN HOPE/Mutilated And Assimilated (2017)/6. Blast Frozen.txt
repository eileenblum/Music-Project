[Lyrics / music: Wagner]

Cryogenic spill soaks you.
Subzero cooling fluid.
Mega-liquid-nitrogen
Freezes you inside-out.

Below water's freezing point,
Ice crystals replace your cells.
Your frozen scream is rime.
You're a statue of living ice.

Body heat sucked out fast,
Perma-frosted in a cryo-blast,
Gelid by the speed of light,
Freezerburnt does not come close.

Below water's freezing point,
Ice crystals replace your cells.
Your frozen scream is rime.
You're a statue of living ice.
Create nucleation.
It's antarctication.
Cryopreservation.
Icy annihilation â now you're blast frozen.
Winterized asphyxiation â now you're blast frozen.
Benumbed extermination â now you're blast frozen.
Nitrogen pure liquidation â now you're blast frozen.

A glacier on two legs,
Brumal bones and blood,
Numb and dead in frore freeze,
Accept your boreal demise.
Blast frozen. Blast frozen.
