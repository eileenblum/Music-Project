[Lyrics / music: Wagner]

Within a remote Australian valley,
An incestuous hillbilly family thrives,
Continuing decades of fucking their own,
Producing generations of incest deformities.

An outback incest clan,
The hills have many eyes,
Deformed progenies abound,
The inbreeding never ceases.

Intimacy of the sickest, depraved kind.
Brothers fuck their sisters and mothers,
Fathers fuck their daughters and cousins,
Kin knock-up kin and make more monsters.

Collective dozens in this familial fuck-group,
This caravan of mongoloids hard and wet,
Procreate and preserve their obscene lineage,
Inbred heirs riddled with abnormalities and repulsive DNA.
