Who goes there?
An alien horror beyond imagination
It's been a million things on a million planets
[Lyrics / music: Wagner]

Now it to wants to be us
The clever thing mimics and stays concealed

Man is the warmest place to hide

Whatever's in there is weird and pissed off
Take samples of blood to draw out the thing
I will eat your screams and mimic them as well

What is this?
An organism imitates other life forms
The xenophobe cells reshape to imitate our own
Now it absorbs and digests us

Whatever's in there is weird and pissed off
Take samples of blood to draw out the thing
It's only meat and tissue when a man bleeds
I will eat your screams and mimic them as well

Entered
Countless alien tentacles plunge and rape your body
Immolated
Savagely torn limb from limb into bloody pieces
Gorestructed
Rebuilding your cells, meat, bones, and mind
Mutilated and assimilated
From a bloodbath you're reborn

Whatever's in there is weird and pissed off
Take samples of blood to draw out the thing
It's only meat and tissue when a man bleeds
I will eat your screams and mimic them as well

Who can you trust?
Even burnt remains host alien activity
Paranoia and terror grip your very soul
The thing may freeze and burn
But it will never die
