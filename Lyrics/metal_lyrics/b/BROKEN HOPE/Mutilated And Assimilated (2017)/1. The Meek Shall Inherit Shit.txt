[Lyrics / music: Wagner]

Humans always excel at shitting in their nest,
Destroying the world that sustains them.
Every day humans make other species extinct.

Continents and oceans full of trash,
The globe gets hotter while man gets stupider,
Even a million years won't undo the damage,
When it's all done, the meek shall inherit shit.

The world keeps turning â a ball of human waste,
Deforestation, drought, and climate change,
Humans bathe in and drink rot and excrement,
Choking on filth from the sewers and the sky.

Fuck her, she's just a dump for all to degrade,
Industrial runoff, greenhouse gases, overpopulation.

Every inch of this sphere is covered in ordure,
The egesta veneer is made up of many forms.

Continents and oceans full of trash,
The globe gets hotter while man gets stupider,
Even a million years won't undo the damage,
When it's all done, the meek shall inherit shit.

The world keeps turning â a ball of human waste,
Deforestation, drought, and climate change,
Humans bathe in and drink rot and excrement,
Choking on filth from the sewers and the sky.
