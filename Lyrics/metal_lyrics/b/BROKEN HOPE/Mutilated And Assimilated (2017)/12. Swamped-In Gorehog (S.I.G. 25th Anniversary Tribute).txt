[Lyrics / music: Wagner]

Swamped in gore...

A grave-robbed corpse is a souls disgrace, smother the decay of carcass into your face,
Septic wash drowning in a retched river of excrement, shriek soundlessly,
Eyeballs burst as skull begins to crush, heads now nothing but blood pulp and mush,
Disemboweled abdominal organs internal, blood and guts run in pain so infernal

Hopelessly swamped in gore
Pathetically swamped in gore
Horribly swamped in gore
Gloriously swamped in gore, gore, gore, gore...

Limbs are sloppily severed, your still alive cannot walk or grasp brain still registers,
Belly slit intestines spill out upon the floor, in a few agonized hours life will be no more,
At the moment you're entangled in your entrails, death comes, bladder bowels let loose, voluntary organs fail,
Bloated ripe cadaver, foul odor reek with might, breaks open easy maggots ooze everywhere

Hopelessly swamped in gore
Pathetically swamped in gore
Horribly swamped in gore
Gloriously swamped in gore, gore, gore, gore...

Uuuhhhh!! Gorehog brings death!!!
Tusks...
Soaked with warm blood...
Immense pig of doom...
Snout basted with gore.
Tusks disembowel...
Entrails pulled out
Blood encrusts it's hair
Ribcage, lungs, intestines fly through the air.

The gorehog shall come,
To lay waste,
It will crush you,
Into a pulpy paste,
It's jaws smash your head,
Scarfing down your brains,
Smothering snout in your denise,
It defecates on your remains,

Uuuhhh!! Gorehog brings death...
Hamhocks from hell...!!
