[Lyrics / music: Wagner]

Prisoners forced to be test subjects,
In the hands of sadistic Russian researchers,
Human guinea pigs locked away to suffer torment,
But hell feels so good they never want to leave.

We've become the darkness that you dread,
The horrors under your bed,
Reptile part inside your brain,
Russian sleep experiment sustains.
We've become the darkness that you dread,
The horrors under your bed,
Reptile part inside your brain,
Russian sleep experiment sustains.

No need for oxygen as the gas preserves them,
Freedom promised after 30 days of observation,
Human guinea pigs locked away to suffer torment,
All the lab rats have completely lost their minds.

We've become the darkness that you dread,
The horrors under your bed,
Reptile part inside your brain,
Russian sleep experiment sustains.
We've become the darkness that you dread,
The horrors under your bed,
Reptile part inside your brain,
Russian sleep experiment sustains.

Cut off muscle and skin,
They will eat only their own flesh.

The test subjects turn on the researchers,
Breaking bones, ripping out testicles and throats,
Addictive stimulant gas intoxicating.
Filthy conditions are a paradise.

Blood... Screams... Shit... Heaven...

Five people forced to stay awake for many days,
Enemies of the state stripped and locked inside,
Shit-smeared portholes mask goings-on,
We are the madness that lurks within you all.

We've become the darkness that you dread,
The horrors under your bed,
Reptile part inside your brain,
Russian sleep experiment sustains.
We've become the darkness that you dread,
The horrors under your bed,
Reptile part inside your brain,
Russian sleep experiment sustains.
