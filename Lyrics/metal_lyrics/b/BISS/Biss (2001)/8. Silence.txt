Pictures come rushing to my head
Iâve slipped from life right into dead
Is it a dream or fantasy?
Iâll never forget what I have seen

[Pre-Chorus]
There is a world behind a world
A holy dimension

[Chorus]
With the silence not to come
Noise inside me drives me mad
Tutor sound rings in my head

This is my call, I gotta go
The final curtain, my last show
My head is empty, crystal clear
I found my peace , the end is near

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
