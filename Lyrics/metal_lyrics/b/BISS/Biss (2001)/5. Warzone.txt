With your face in the mud
You are trying to survive
With your ass in the dirt
You try to stay alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Canât stand living this hell
There is no escape
Lord, Iâm feeling helpless
I wonât be able to tell
I know my fateâs being sealed

[Chorus]
Warzone
Into the warzone
Warzone
Into the warzone
Warzone
Into the warzone

Keep your eyes wide open
Thereâs dancer in the skies
Just one mistake
And you are gonna die

[Chorus]
Warzone
Into the warzone
Warzone
Into the warzone
Itâs dead manâs land
Itâs Neverland
