Reflections of childhood come over me
Sparkling and glimmering around
Theyâre all in my head, in my mind
Youâll read what knocks me to the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
I will surrender
When shadows come banging my door

[Chorus]
Intoxication

I saw a light in the closet
The night took my sanity away
I followed the light into darkness
My pain wonât live on one more day

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
