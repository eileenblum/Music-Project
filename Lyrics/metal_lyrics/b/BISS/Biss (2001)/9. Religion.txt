Thereâs something inside me
Thatâs killing me slowly
Itâs burning like fire in my head

Thereâs something in my veins
A beast locked in white chains
The stain of this switchblade is red

[Chorus]
Lord knows how hard Iâve tried
Lord knows Iâve failed
But I keep on searching my way
Take my soul, Lord, and ease my pain

This is my religion

Thereâs something above me
Itâs something I canât see
I donât know why I am so blind

Thereâs something around me
A light that surrounds me
Iâm lost in my own tangled mind

[Chorus]
