I canât stand it any longer
Whilst my consciousâ running wild
âTil my needs are getting stringer
I refuse the angelsâ child

[Chorus]
Donât cause me no pain
Donât leave me scarified
Donât ever close your eyes
Another thrill of killing pain
Raging insanity leads to catastrophe
Another kill of thrilling pain

Angel on my naked shoulder
Devil on my shivering neck
Feel my blood is running colder
When itâs going to attack

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I am a psycho with no lead
Like an animal I live
Got no honor, got no moral
Intuition is my gift

[Chorus]
