Something unusual
Nothing predictable
Touches my black-heartened soul
If I could switch it off
Could I just rip it off?
Buried alive in a hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Lights out on everything
Black darkened sun

[Chorus]
Up and down
Iâm crossing the circle of time
After time Iâm trying to fool my fate
My own fate, my own fate

Itâs coming over me
Shakes me wonât let me be
Thrills me right down to the bone
Maybe, I go insane
Nobody else to blame
Left all alone on my home

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
