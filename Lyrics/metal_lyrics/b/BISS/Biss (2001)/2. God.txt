I do not like heaven
Itâs finally not my place
I do not like you either
I donât like your face

I do not like my mother
I sometimes hate my dad
I donât like my brother
That really makes me sad

[Pre-Chorus]
I ride the road into hell
To meet my maker
Iâm tangled and under your spell
You are a faker
(I do not believe in)

[Chorus]
God!
Where is my backstage pass?
God!
Give me all access
God!
Where is my backstage pass?
God!

I donât like what Iâm saying
I donât like what I think
Maybe I am not worth it
God, can you spare a drink?

I do not like Mondays
I do not like my wife
Lord, I will surrender
To get me out alive

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
