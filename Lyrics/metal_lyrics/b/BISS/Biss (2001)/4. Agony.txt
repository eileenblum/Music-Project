Did you ever hear the whisper of a never-ending dream?
A nightmare in reality
Where nothingâs what it seems

Did you ever hear the voices calling out your name?
Dark shadows they are hunting you
Your fear comes back again

[Chorus]
Donât let it get beneath your agony
Wonât you let âem in
Agony
Donât let evil forces win
Fight the deadly sin
Agony
Stand up and fight
Stand up and fight

Did you ever hear the whisper of a world thatâs standing still?
The door is locked, nowhere to run
Heâs out to break your will

Have you ever tasted lonely tears?
A taste you wonât forget
A silent cry without a sound
Exploding in your head

[Chorus]
