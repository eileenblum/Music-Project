We pack up and leave
We beware the disease
And outbreak of fear
The virus is near
Just waiting and praying

Out of the blue
A nightmare comes true
Invisible killers will never spare you

[Chorus]
The world we live in is crazy
Weâre part of this slaughterhouse
The world we live in, we give in
To the threat of a slaughterhouse

The thread of the pest
Spread all over the land
Symptoms are clear
Like blood on your hand
Waiting and praying

All cities appear
Like ghost towns from hell
How this will end?
God knows too well

[Chorus]
