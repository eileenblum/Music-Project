I believe in thunder
I believe in rain
While the end is coming near
I believe in pain
I believe in sympathy
I believe inn hate
On my way to darkness
I believe in fate

[Pre-Chorus]
I crawl out from the ashes
Into the blood red sky
Iâm ready to burn, lord
Iâm ready to die

[Chorus]
X-tasy on you and me
Your x-tasyâs my electricity
You and me have to be
E-L-E-C-T-R-I
City
X-tasy running free
X-tasyâs pure electricity
You and me forever be
E-L-E-C-T-R-I
City

I believe in heaven
I believe in light
But I donât know the answer
What is wrong or right
I believe in freedom
I believe in war
Canât you tell me, father
What I was fighting for?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
