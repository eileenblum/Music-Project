Turn your head and run
This is the worst its ever been
Just a little while longer

I'll keep waving till you're gone
Making sure that I'm the last thing that you saw
In my heart it's been so long
I keep on waving but I know that this is wrong

Who are we fooling anyway?
The games we play, the love we break
The words we don't say

When it all turns for the worst
When the sun sets around us
I'd trade my life for yours a thousand times

I'll keep waving till 'you're gone
Making sure that I'm the last thing that you saw
In my heart it's been so long
I keep on waving but I know that this is wrong

Everyday I try to make things right
Everyday I try to make sense of this mess
Everyday I try to make things right
Just to make you believe in me.. again

I'll keep waving till 'you're gone
Making sure that I'm the last thing that you saw
In my heart it's been so long
I keep on waving but I know that this is wrong

Everyday I try to make things right
Everyday I try to make sense of this mess
Everyday I try to make things right
Just to make you believe in me.. again
