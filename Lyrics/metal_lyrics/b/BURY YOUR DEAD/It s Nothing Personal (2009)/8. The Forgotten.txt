I've been burned over and over again by the flames of time
(now that you started this fire inside me, I'll be burning forever)

I was in the dark but you held me
I was so lost out there just floating along
It's getting harder and harder to see over the walls I've built around myself

They just keep getting higher and higher
(look at what I've created, this structure; that never lets you in)

Somedays, the hardest choice you'll make
Is which bridge to cross to see better days
Well, I'm the bridge you burn, turn and walk away from screaming,
You failed me

She was looking for an answer
I was searching for a way
To make these bitter pills easier to swallow
When I could not face the day

Somedays, the hardest choice you'll make
Is which bridge to cross to see better days
Well I'm the bridge you burn, turn and walk away from screaming, you failed me
When your words lose taste in my mouth
When the ink runs dry and time runs out
I'll be the bridge you burn, turn and walk away from screaming,
You failed me

And every night from a room down the hall
(I'd hear her crying)
Praying for a savior to take her away
(I'd hear her crying)

Somedays the hardest choice you'll make
Is which bridge to cross to see better days
Well I'm the bridge you burn, turn and walk away from screaming, you failed me
When your words lose taste in my mouth
When the ink runs dry and time runs out
I'll be the bridge you burn, turn and walk away from screaming,
You failed me
