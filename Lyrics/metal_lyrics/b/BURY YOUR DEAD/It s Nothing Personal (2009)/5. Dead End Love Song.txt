The weight fills my lungs again
Like a rushing tide, I tried to escape this
I'm at the bottom of the ocean
For you I've inhaled water
For this, I gave everything
Just to make you understand

I'm just a shell
Fragments of a dream
Pieces of a broken man
Is what remains of me

I've eluded the mouths of a thousand desperate sharks, just to present my flaws
only to be humiliated by what I could not offer you

I'm just a shell
Fragments of a dream
Pieces of a broken man
Is what remains of me

I'm incomplete, incompatible. You don't have to rub it in.
You sank my self worth.
You were the anchor to a waterlogged vessel and I could never repay the debt I owe
Where would I be without you, pinning me to the ground?

I've eluded the mouths of a thousand desperate sharks, just to present my flaws
only to be humiliated by what I could not offer you

(this is all for you)
(this is all for you)

I'm just a shell
A fragment of a dream
Pieces of a broken man
Is what remains of me
