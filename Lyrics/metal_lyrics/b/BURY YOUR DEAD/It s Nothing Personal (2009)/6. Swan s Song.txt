Thrown out to sea
and capsized by the truth
You can cast your cares on me
When you cant rely on you

No you, no me, no in between
Just the ghost of what used to be
You're the cracking skin and breaking bones
Collapsing like a lung

I'm lost again and don't know what to do
When I close my eyes
I'm taken back
to better days with you

This is the countdown of the end
This is the beginning of our final days
Our final days
It's not like I wanted this at all
It's not like I wanted this to end
This is the beginning of our final days

This is the countdown of the end
This is the beginning of our final days
Our final days
It's not like I wanted this at all
It's not like I wanted it to end
This is the beginning of our final days

No you, no me, no in between
Just the ghost of what used to be

No you, no me, no in between
Just the ghost of what used to be

No you, no me, no in between
Just the ghost of what used to be

No you, no me, no in between
Just the ghost of what used to be
