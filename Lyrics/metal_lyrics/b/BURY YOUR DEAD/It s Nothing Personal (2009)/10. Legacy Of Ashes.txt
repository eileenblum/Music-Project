Dear martyr,
The tears you shed in life
No one Is listening
The cross you carry is showing

Dear virgin,
With innocence he stole that night
No one is listening
Your hymen is broken

The more I hate this life, the better it feels
your words cut me deeper, it makes the pain more real

Dear orphan,
Who sits alone waiting
No one is listening
to his cries at night

Abandoned,
The world is a cold dead place
No one is listening
Drag me to the bottom

Drag me to the bottom
Drag me to the bottom

The more I hate this life, the better it feels
Your words cut me deeper it makes the pain more real
I spent my whole life waiting on you
The cut that never heals
Your words cut me deeper, it makes the pain more real

Drag me to the bottom
I'll drag you to the bottom with me

Abandoned,
The world is a cold dead place
No one is listening
Drag me straight to the bottom

Medicate yourself
and pretend this was love
At the expenses of being honest

The more I hate this life, the better it feels
Your words cut me deeper it makes the pain more real
I spent my whole life waiting on you
The cut that never heals

Drag me to the bottom
I'll drag you to the bottom with me
Drag me to the bottom
I'll take you to the bottom with me
