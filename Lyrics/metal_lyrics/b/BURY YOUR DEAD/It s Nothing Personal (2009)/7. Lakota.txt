If you give me a choice,
Then give me death
This is not living
There is no liberty, no freedom
Bound and gagged
And the walls are closing in around me
This is what you should fear,
I am what you should fear
This is what you will fear

Preying on the weak
Makes us the strongest link
They can no longer hold us
Controlling what we think

To the victors belong the spoils
We are the new humans
This is the new revolution
Now tell me I'm the only one who gives a fuck anymore
I'm the only one who can make a change

And the walls are closing in around me
I am what you should fear,
I am what you should fear
This is what you should fear

Preying on the weak
Makes us the strongest link
They can no longer hold us
Controlling what we think

What we think

Preying on the weak
Makes us the strongest link
They can no longer hold us
Controlling what we think

Preying on the weak
Makes us the strongest link
They can no longer hold us
Controlling what you think

What you think
What you think
What you think
