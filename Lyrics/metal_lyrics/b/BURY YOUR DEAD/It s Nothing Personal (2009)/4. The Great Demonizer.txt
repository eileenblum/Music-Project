Close your eyes
There's no reason to stand here
There's no reason to carry on
We've pushed and pulled, but we never made it
This is end of the line, so kiss it all goodbye

(So kiss it all goodbye)
(So kiss me goodbye)

I gave all I had to give but it wasn't enough
I thought that I could make you enough
Somedays, the finish line seems so far away
We will never make it to the end
So move along

(so kiss it all goodbye)
(so kiss me goodbye)

Come down
Take your life in your own hands
Coming down
Sink into your place
Come down off your high horse

A million moving mouths uttering no words, you know I hate them all.

(You know I hate them all)
(You make me hate them all)

Come down
Take your life in your own hands
Coming down
Sink into your place
Come down off your high horse

A million moving mouths uttering no words, you know I hate you all
A million moving mouths uttering no words, you know I hate you all

Come down
Take your life in your own hands
Coming down
Sink into your place
Come down off your high horse

I hate you all
I hate you all
