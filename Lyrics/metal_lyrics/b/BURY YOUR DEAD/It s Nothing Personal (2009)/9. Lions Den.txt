How did we end up here?
Right back where we started
Right where it all went wrong
Face to face but still displaced
We've been standing here all along

You keep talking, you're screaming my name
The ground stopped moving and nothing is the same
I can't hear you from way down here
In this hole you left me in

Do you ever wish you were someone else?
(Cause I do)
And if I could be anywhere right now
(it would be with you)
You see there's no place for us to run
(There's nothing we can do)

We don't belong here
We don't belong

Now every time I stare into the mirror, all I see is all gone wrong.
She's on the cover of a magazine
Not of this world with a Plastic frame
Just like every single one of them
You're nothing You're all the same

You let me in
You let me break you down
You're just a twisted little whore

Do you ever wish you were someone else?
(Cause I do)
And if I could be anywhere right now
(It would be with you)
You see there's no place for us to run
(There's nothing we can do)

We don't belong here
We don't belong

Do you ever wish you were someone else?
(Cause I do)
And if I could be anywhere right now
(It would be with you)
You see there's no place for us to run
(There's nothing we can do)

We don't belong here
We don't belong
