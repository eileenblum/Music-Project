I've got a sickness no doctor in all of his knowledge could ever cure
I'm so sick and tired of feeling worthless like I don't exist
Keep up my head high, try to live my life, and no one notices
All my years being left alone has made me what I am
Wounded by the ones I love, back against a wall, I'm an animal trapped in hell.

This is real pain
These are real tears
This is the world falling on me.

Is this what you want?
Part of your great plan?
You wanna see me fail?
You'll never get your chance

Sorrow has become my only friend again
I know I will fail you end the end

There's no heaven that wants me
No hell that could ever hold me in
No matter how far I run, I could never escape
I still bear all of my sins

I remember the sun touching your face
I'm still waiting for the day
Just to hear you say, "well I've had enough"
Get up and you walk away

Sorrow has become my only friend again
I know I will fail you in the end

And I can't blame you for running
I know you couldn't understand
You see, I don't even know myself anymore
I don't even fucking understand

This is real pain
These are real tears
This is the world falling on me.

Is this what you want?
Part of your great plan?
You want to see me fail?
You'll never have a chance

Sorrow has become my only friend again
I know I will fail you in the end

I will fail
I will fail
I will fail
