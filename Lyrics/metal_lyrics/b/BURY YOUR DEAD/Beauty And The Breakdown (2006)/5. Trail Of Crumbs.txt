So it all comes down to this
Who..s to blame and who..s excused
I..ve dealt the cards and you lose
And now I hold it all against you

I said I..d take it all back but
We both know that I won..t
I won..t take the time to say what is mine
And you can keep the car
..Cause you left this scar
I..ll show you the door
I..ll give you what..s yours

I said I..d take it all back but
We both know that I won..t
I won..t take the time to say what is mine
These pictures of her
These clothes on the floor
I..ll show you the door
I..ll give you what..s yours

But you..re not coming near
The years we spent
Wasted

..Cause those we..re holding onto
They show us what we..ve been through
And what she..s never going back to
She found the strength it wasn..t you
