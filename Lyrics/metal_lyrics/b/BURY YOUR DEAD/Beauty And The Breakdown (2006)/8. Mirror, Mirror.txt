I look at you
With disgust disappointment and regret
All we..ve been through
How could you fucking forget

You said I was forced to
So bitter and I didn..t want to
Leave your wing for the first time
And I would never leave you behind

I carry you in my attitude
The words I speak and the things I do
In every line your voice rings through
I only fly because of you

Tonight if I die in my sleep
All the times we..ve shared
I hope in your heart you will keep

Tonight if I die
I die in my sleep

I will die
