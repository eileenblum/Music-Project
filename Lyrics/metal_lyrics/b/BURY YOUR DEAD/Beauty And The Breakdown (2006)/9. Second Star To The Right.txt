Her blue eyes grey in the shadows
Making changes for tomorrow
Her fear let..s another day go by
Where stars fall dreams die

I know she..s suffering
And pursuing what went lost
You..re fucking wasting away
Skies only tell the tales of
Dreams that are lost

I wrote that to you everyday
She never came
My faith in humanity died
Calling out her name

I wrote that to you everyday
Shit never changed
My faith in humanity died
Calling out her name
