And if I ever had a chance to tell you what this meant you would never believe me

So here we are with our heads in the sand,
And all I ever wanted was for you to be proud of me,
All I ever wanted was for you to care
Because now I don't feel so real to you

When all we are has turned to dust
When all we are has ceased to exist
Just remember, we wanted it this way

And if I ever had a chance to tell you what this meant, you would never believe me
So here we are with our heads in the sand,
And all I ever wanted was for you to be proud of me,

When all we are has turned to dust
When all we are has ceased to exist
Just remember, we wanted it this way
