Pick up the pieces of a home that is forever broken
Pick up the pieces of child's life that will never be the same again
Every time you come around telling great lies of how this time everything will be different.
That You've changed
That you deserve a chance to right these wrongs

You look to me and see this is the end
We've learned to stand tall without you there to tear us down
You can come this far but no further
You've worn out your welcome

Pick up the pieces of a home that is forever broken
Pick up the pieces of child's life that will never be the same again
Every time you come around telling great lies of how this time everything will be different.
That You've changed
That you deserve a chance to right these wrongs

One day this will all come back on you
One day you'll get what you deserve

Pick up the pieces of a battered wife who trusted only you
I'm sure you feel more like a man
Pick up where you started life before you ruined everything

One day you'll get what you deserve

You look to me and see now that this is the end
We've learned to stand tall without you there to tear us down
You can come this far but no further
You've worn out your welcome
