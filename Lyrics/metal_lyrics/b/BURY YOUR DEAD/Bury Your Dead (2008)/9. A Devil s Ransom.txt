My mouth's been full with the waste we made especially for a night like this.
For Quite some time now, I've carried all this weight
Just to prove to you and the rest of these critics that I can.

When my Skin stretches to fill the great growing void I'll give it all back.
Give it all back.

I'm hardening that soft spot you've been abusing all along
I think it best that you take this now
Cause what I need is a place of my own

Another promise broken
Another word kept silent
You're saving all the bad for a rainy day
Well the sun isn't shining

When my skin stretches to fill the great growing void ill give it all back.
