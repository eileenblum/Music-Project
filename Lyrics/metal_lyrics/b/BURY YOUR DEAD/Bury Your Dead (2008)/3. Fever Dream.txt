Everyday
It starts again, waking up to feet on shaky ground
This is just another poor excuse for trying
The more I give the more you take away
Now every ounce I have, I draw
Just to push me through another day

Heels dragging
Heart lacking

But it's so damn hard when the weight of the world is on your shoulders

Now who am I to express and complain, that this is killing me?
It never matters
I said it once and ill say it all again
Keep screaming, keep waving
You're digging holes and I'm buried inside

No one can hear you, but if we give up now, then at least we can say we tried
