Darkness, I'm blind and moving through you.
I tucked away little notes, instructions
On how to never be found again.
Darkness, I'm blind

I want to taste a new freedom
Carve away at the burden
And set my sights to the empty sky

We didn't deserve your disease

You gave each of us a story to speak of
Puzzle pieces that tell of your negligence.
Yet You call this love?

I want to taste a new freedom
I want to Carve away the burden
And set my sights to the empty sky

Better to pacify
Than to eliminate the true beast We loved
Unconditionally
With no brighter days in sight
This is what makes our family strong

Freedom, I set my sights to an empty sky
