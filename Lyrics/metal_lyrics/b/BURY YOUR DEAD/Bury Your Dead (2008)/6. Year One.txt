And on the day my father died
No one came to his grave to say goodbye

With all the words he could have said,
Never once did he make this right
He left us here, to drown in a wake of his destruction
He is gone and we are to pick up the pieces

Well it never really was up to us
We never even stood a chance.
Now this is where we hardened our hearts

Now wake up, lets start it all anew
I know you're tired, your reasons for living are getting harder and harder to find
Just give us our chance to make this everything we've ever dreamed of

Oh god
Oh god
Oh god

This is an uphill battle and I'm losing the stride
Is there anyone who sees this?
This is an uphill battle and I'm losing the stride
Is there anyone who sees this?

I know you're tired, your reasons for living are getting harder and harder to find
Just give us a chance to make this everything we've ever dreamed of

This is an uphill battle and I'm losing the stride
Is there anyone who sees this?
This is an uphill battle and I'm losing the stride
Is there anyone who sees this?

And I have had enough
