I swear to end this
I swear to end this now
I fade away stacking day upon every fucking day
I've lost myself in the blood of heavy fucking April rains
Mistakes are made regret the weight
Regret. This weight. Hangs one foot in the fucking grave
My back, a lifelong scarring. It never fucking heals.
Through the sores of embedded fucking knives
I suffer everyday just to deal.
Back pocket full of broken hearts and I don't feel a fucking thing
I've tried to shed this mark but I just can't shake its fucking stain
The shards of this cut through this longing wrist
The shards of a broken heart cut through this longing wrist
I suffer everyday just to deal. I'm fighting everyday just to feel.
