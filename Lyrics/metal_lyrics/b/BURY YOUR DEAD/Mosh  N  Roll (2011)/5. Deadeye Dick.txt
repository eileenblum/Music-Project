I fucking give up
I never though it would come to this.
I cannot handle a past that I may have never lived.
I've watched the years bleed out
I never thought it would come to this. This is the last thing
I would ever thought I'd regret
This bottle, long since emptied
and shattered, just like me. Broken and incomplete
I've watched you, years after, my wrist, my past disaster
How can one week feel so long?
And I'd still be aging faster. I've watched you, years after
My wrist, my past disaster
