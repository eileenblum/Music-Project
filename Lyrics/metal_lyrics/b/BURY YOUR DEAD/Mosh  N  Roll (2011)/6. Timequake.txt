Your eyes read indifference and mine read devastation
You tore my world apart
One awful conversation two years of my life
Just a fucking lie
I did everything for us
And you just watched us die
Confrontation, admit deception
Perfections - ugly and fade
My perception of our position
Decomposes with every fucking sip I take
I'm resentful, broken
and desperate for conviction. I've waited too long
For some validation
