You burned a portrait in my eyes
You watched me falter
My motivation now encircles my wrist
This razor blade says
I've fucking been dismissed
All my life you were my silver lining
My only hope, my explanation for not dying
Through all these years you were my reason
We shed a tear for your fucking treason
Weathered by the lines that paint tragedy across my wrists
