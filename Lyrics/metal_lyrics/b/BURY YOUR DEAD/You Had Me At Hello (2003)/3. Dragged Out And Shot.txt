Now Here's A Medal For Being So Fucking Perfect
Perfect At Making Me Miserable
How Do Your Do It?
So Let Me Get Some Paper To Take Down These Notes
So That I Can Take The Papers Dull Edge 
And Saw Away At My Tired Wrists
There Is Something About You
I Can't Quite Put My Finger On It
I Can't Quite Put My Fingers Around Your Neck, You Die.
