I Never Said I Was A Fucking Poet
I Never Tried To Be Something I Knew I'd Never Be
There's No Use In Pretending
I'll Tell You One Thing, So Listen Closely
When I Tell You This Is Straight From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart
So Please Save The Excuse For Someone Who Wants To Hear Them
You're Not Here, That's All That Matters
I'm Just Afraid I'll Never Feel This Way Again
You're Not Here, That's All That Matters
The Lies The Deceit
Will I Eve Say Enough Is Enough
Or Will I Continue To Let You Walk All Over Me
I Am Done, Pistol Please
I Can't Take This Anymore, Pistol Please
I Am Done, Pistol Please
