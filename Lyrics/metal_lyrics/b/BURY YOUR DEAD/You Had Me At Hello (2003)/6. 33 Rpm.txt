Just Because You Turned Your Back
Just Because You Turned Away
It Doesn't Make Me Any Better
It Doesn't Make You Any Less
You Think You're Better?
My Ideals Are Still The Same
You're The One Who Fucking Sold Out
You're The Only One To Blame
Just Because You Turned Your Back
It Doesn't Make Me Any Less
Let's Go! Bring It Back
Just Because You Turned Your Back
I'll Never Turn Away
Turn Away From This Fight
I'll Never Turn My Back On This Fight
