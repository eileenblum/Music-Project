No More Heart Broken Songs
Get Over It, Move On
Let's Wipe Those Tears Away From That Pretty Face
That Pretty Fucking Face
No More Crying To Your Dashboard Record
You Sappy Emo Bitch
We Are All Born Alone
And We All Die Alone
Forget About Your Problems
Just For One Night
No More Crying 
There's Only Death And Dying
Let's Wipe Those Tears Away
We Are All Born Into This World Alone
And We All Die Alone
You're Not The Only One
Everyone Has their Own Problems
So Put On That Pretty Fucking Face
And Look Ahead To The Future
We Are All Born Into This World Alone
And We All Die Alone
