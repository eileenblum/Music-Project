Alone I Stand, Here I Stand Waiting
Dreams Of Me Erasing All The False Words That You Spoke
Regret Filled Nights Finally End
Sleepless Nights Finally End
I'm Not Forgiving You, I'll Never Forgive You
Reality Is Setting In. 
It's Your Mistakes That Brought You Here
The Things You Said, They Brought Me To My Knees
The Truth, It Hurts So Fucking Much
But It Hurts In The End Where I Am Left
So Let's Keep This Lost Bond As A Reminder
A Reminder Of All The Things We Fucking Had
Feeling No Sympathy, Feeling No Remorse
