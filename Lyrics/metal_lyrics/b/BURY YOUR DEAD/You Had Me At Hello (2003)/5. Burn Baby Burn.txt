My Friends, My Family, Its For All You Kids
Hardcore Is Everything, It Means The World To Me
This Scene, My Brothers, My True Friends, And My Fucking Family
Go! I Trust My Sincerity
And I Don't Know Where I'd Be With Out This Fucking Scene
Without This Hardcore Scene
I'd Lay Down My Life For My Family
My Friends Are Everything To Me
I Love Them With All I Have
Through Fights And Hardships, I Know They'll Be There
They'll Be There, They'll Always Be Right By My Side
