I Close My Eyes And You Say Those Things That Aggravate Me
I Swear You Say Them Just To Make Me Cry
I Swear You Say Them Just To Make My Heart Break
This Time It's Not Going To Fucking Happen
I Put My Hands Around Your Throat And Squeeze
Until Your Pulse Has Faded, Until Your Pulse Has Faded
So Now Who Is Begging Who To Stop
And Now Who Is Crying To Who
And Once Again The Annoying Sound Of 6 AM
6 AM Saves Your Life
And As Always My Happiness Is Cut Short
