All that I have is what this promise means. You are the only thing that's left for me. And what might keep me falls to second place when I remember what you give for me. All that I have is all that you've given me. My heart was empty. Life was killing me. Gave you my body and you gave me love. I swear my everything you're not just all I have you're all I need. You're not just all I have you're all I need. I mean these words more than I've ever meant anything before. You're all that I need.
