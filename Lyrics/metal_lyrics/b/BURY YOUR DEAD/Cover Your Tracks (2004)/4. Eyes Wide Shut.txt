There's nothing that you could say to me to keep me from walking away. So let's go. Maybe it hasn't registered yet, to you that we're through. But, we're as done as it gets my love and for us there will be no sunrise as I lay next to you, and this is the last thing I will ever give to you. It's over. This is the last thing I give to you. It's over.
