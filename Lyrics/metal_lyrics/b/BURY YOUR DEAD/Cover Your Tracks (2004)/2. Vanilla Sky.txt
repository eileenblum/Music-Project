Every mile makes me feel so far away. You are the only thing that helps me sleep at night. Another city and I tell you that we're on our way. I know I used to think that you were by my side. You have changed and I know that so have I. This is the only way for me to say good-bye. Another week and we'll be in the same bed at night. If that's too far from now I'll have to cut my ties. Just because I'm so alone; doesn't mean I can't miss home. I'm tired of crying, tired of sleeping alone. If this is how you want it, I am moving on.
