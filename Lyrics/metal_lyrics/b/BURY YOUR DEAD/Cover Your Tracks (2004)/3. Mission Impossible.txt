And I stand. Here I stand waiting. Dreams of me erasing all the false words that you spoke. Regret-filled nights finally end. Sleepless nights, they finally end. I'm not forgiving you. I will never forgive you. Reality is sinking in; it's your mistakes that brought you here. The things you said brought me to my knees. The truth it hurrts so fucking much. But it hurts so much more in the end, where I am left. So let's keep this lost bond as a reminder. A reminder of all the things we fucking had. Feeling no sympathy. Feeling no remorse.
