I see you're weak. Did you see that we were strong? We all make mistakes in life. You made your choice, at the same time you made mine. You found a man that you'd give for, and what you gave would mean my everything. You'd come around in the long run. I can see now how we all lost hope 'cause we would spend everyday thinking about you. We'd grow strong without you. We had each other. That's all we needed. Life wasn't easy but it could be beat. A constant battle, mine for the taking, with them beside me, and that's all I'd need. The years without you were far from easy. We'd have our visits but only in my dreams. I might sleep smiling though I was cold. We had a fire that's not what makes a home. Forget the past. Let's forget the struggle. We have you back and that's all I need to know. You need us now and we all forgive you. I see you're weak. Did you see we're strong? Are you proud that we turned out so strong? Forget the past.  We have you back. You need us now and we all forgive you. I see you're weak. Did you see we're strong? Are you proud that we turned out so strong?
