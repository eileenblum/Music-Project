The life I live, my last chance to get an impact. but my time's wasted by the poeple who came and then go. This one's for them 'cause the scene's for us and I'll give you one chance to stand up and prove to me you're not. You live your life by a broken promise you made to yourself in the seventh grade. Three years from now when you turn twenty-one, no longer coming out. You've become just like everyone else. Everyone else. You're our permission to work the walls. You'll be forgotten when you are gone. This one's for you 'cause the scene's for us.
