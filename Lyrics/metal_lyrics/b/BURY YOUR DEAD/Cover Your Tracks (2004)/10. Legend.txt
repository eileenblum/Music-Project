You brought us up although you were forced to. You had two children and you were just a kid yourself. You cared for us and we relied on you. We used to cry and that was your burden. We had to eat and you had to provide. We we're just then and we weren't much younger than you. That's what we have. That is why I know you're the reason we all survived. When we were young and you were our mother we grew up fast 'cause that's how we had to. As I got older I knew I owed it all to you. I owe my youth to you. We both know what we have been through. You gave your youth just so you could get us through. I owe my youth. That is what we have. You are why I am. Put on your dancing shoes.
