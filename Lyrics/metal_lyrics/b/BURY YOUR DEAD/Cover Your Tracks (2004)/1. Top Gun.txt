You finally have destroyed all the good in me. Face to face, there's nothing left inside of me. A soulless shell, I'm so imcomplete. This is the last time you will ever; you will never lie to my face. I have no love inside my heart, only a knife deep in my back. This shell that I've become is all that's left of me. Thanks to you. You have ignored our history. Your left us could and hungry, surviving week to week. This is the last time you will ever; you will never lie to my face. To destroy you would be not great loss.
