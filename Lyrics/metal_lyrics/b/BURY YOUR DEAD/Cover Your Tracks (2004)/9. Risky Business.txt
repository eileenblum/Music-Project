You think you're blood to me and I think you're fucking wrong. What is there left to show for all the wasted years you've taken from me when the memory of your smile makes my head turn the other way. And what is there left to say after all the feeling so empty. Every smile was a waste, wasted on your love. You think you're blood to me and I think you're fucking wrong. 'Cause you crossed to line one last time so I'm going through you if I can't get over you. I'm getting over you the only way I know how. Over you. You crossed to line from enemy to casualty the day you disrespected me.
