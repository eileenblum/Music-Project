Abuse your body but you call it love. I hear the stories; the bruises speak for themselves. You think we're blind just because we are young. I'm old enough to know now that my age made dumb. I should have yelled and forced someone to hear those things we thought were better left unsaid. Is now too late? It dominates my head. Those things we thought were better left unsaid. I could not choose a way. A choice that wasn't mine to make. Just make him go away. But if you're happy then I'm glad you found him. God, please help her find her way. A choice that wasn't mine to make. Just make him go away. Will she be happy when she finally finds herself? Does she know she has our help? Why do I ever bother? We left hose things unsaid. It hurts to talk but I'm starting to wish I did. We left those things unsaid. They hurt to hear. Why do I bother? Some things are better off left unsaid.
