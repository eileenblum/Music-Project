Just because you turned your back, just because you turned away, it doesn't make me any better it doesn't make you any less, you think your better, my ideals are still the same, you're the one who fucking sold out, you're the only one to blame. Just because you turned your back it, doesn't make me any less LETS GO! Bring it back, just because you turned your back, ill never turn away turn away form this fight, ill never turn my back on this fight.
