No more heart broken songs, get over it move on, lets wipe those tears away from that pretty face, that pretty fucking face, no more crying to your dashboard records you sappy emo bitch, we are all born alone and we all die alone forget about your problems just for one night, no more crying theres only death and dying, lets wipe those tears away, we are all born into this world alone, and we all die alone, your not the only one everyone has their own problems, so put a smile on that pretty fucking face and look ahead to the future, we are all born into this world alone and we all die alone.
