[Music: Vomitory Gorification/ Lyrics: MÃ¶rtifico]

Into my cave they decompose, in putrid arome they disgorge
Hung by their guts, slowly they gut, drained in disgust
In my home where carrion rots, flesh floods walls with skulls and bones
I have ripped their scalp, their skin, like the others who surround me

As I sleep they stare me, they haunt my dreams then I need to kill
Warped in the macabre of a life with the dead unleashed from the rest

Into my cave they decompose, in putrid smell they disgorge
Hung by their guts, slowly they gut, drained in disgust
In my home where carrion rots, flesh floods walls with skulls and bones
I have ripped their scalp, their skin like the others who surround me

Death I breath to remain, I'm victim of my repulsions
Fated to coldness of death
I wander as I'm dead
