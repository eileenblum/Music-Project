[Music and text by MÃ¶rtifico]

Gathered in their convent praying for their God
So called protected from an evil force
I entered their temple, hacking the first two sisters
Dismembered and scattered, their blood splattered on the cross

Skinned and disembowelled, Nuns were gutting in the wall
The ribcage extracted, spine and cranium unleashed from corpse

I trapped in a room, a young beautiful nun
I couldn't resist,  I had to rape her body
Penetrated with violence, the pleasure of flesh she must know
Kneading her big breasts, my fingers possessed her secret orifices

She was flooded with my sperm running in her sores
Moaning and crying by orgasm and sufferings
I smashed her skull disfiguring this beauty
Then I fucked her once again...

I sucked in Blood of the sisters from their (raped) pussy
Drinking their bile, gnawing their bones as they went mouldy

Half split corpses lay among shreds of skin
The heads of the sisters rotted in rancidity
I wandered in this Hell,
As the lambs bled

I sucked in Blood of the sisters from their (raped) pussy
Drinking their bile, gnawing their bones as they went mouldy

An Orgy with the dead sisters in diabolical necrorgarsm 
Desecrating the Holiness, as the lambs bled

Saints have been mangled, sodomised with crucifix
Abandoned to insects, absurd fate in blasphemy
