[Music and lyrics: Mortifico]

Extermination, death of the weak ones
A breath of zyklon, final katharsis
In blood and pain, all shall suffer
Raptured and tortured then killed and burn

Human worldwide eradication
Thrown to the fire, all shall suffer

Death of millions, depopulated
Glorious massacre
When I watch you die... I'll laugh
