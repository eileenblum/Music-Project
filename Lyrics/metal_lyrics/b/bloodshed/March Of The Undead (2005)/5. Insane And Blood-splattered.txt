[Music: Vomitory Gorification, Lyrics: Mortifico]

Tombs are roaring and break the silence
Tourmented souls ask me to deliver them
With the blood and the flesh and the prayers of the dead
Insanity turns to cold and harsh reality
With the blood and the flesh and the prayers of the dead

INSANE AND BLOOD-SPLATTERED
INSANE AND BLOOD-SPLATTERED

...INSANE....
