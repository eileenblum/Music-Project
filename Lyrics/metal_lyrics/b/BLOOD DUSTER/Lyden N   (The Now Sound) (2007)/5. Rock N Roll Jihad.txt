It's a rock n roll Jihad
Don't you know?
Time to take out the trash
Crashing planes onto stages
And into bands who suck ass

It's a Rock N Roll, It's a Rock N Roll,
It's a Rock N Roll Jihad,
Don't you know?

Taking out the lame ass Rock N Roll
To help our god spread the news
Its our way or the flyway, don't you know
Gonna get on the news

It's a Rock N Roll, It's a Rock N Roll,
It's a Rock N Roll Jihad,
Don't you know?
