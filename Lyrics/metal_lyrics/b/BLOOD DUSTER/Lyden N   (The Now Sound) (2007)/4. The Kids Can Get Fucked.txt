Can you tell by the people around
Your time has come and gone?
Can't you see by the clothes that they wear,
No-one wants to hear your song
Let me tell you now the metal is in
But not the kind of metal we know
The kids have spoken
And I'm old news
No one comes to our shows

So leave bad luck
pack your bags boy
Go and get fucked
Don't you know that's what you gotta do?

Can't you tell by the look in there eyes
They don't like you hanging around
Another band of the past
?
Let me tell you now the metal is in
But not the kind of metal we know
The kids have spoken
And I'm old news
No one comes to our shows

So leave bad luck
pack your bags boy
Go and get fucked
Don't you know that's what you gotta do?

Fuck the kids what would they know
Sixteen and a mow won't grow

I just don't care
