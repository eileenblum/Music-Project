A little spark in the band room
Started slowly while they played
No one noticed, it was too late
The venue now becomes a grave
I stand and watch the people crying
Licking flames they kiss the sky
The scene is swallowed in a cloud of dirty smoke
All those emo have died

Fire engulfs the back packs
Singes fringes and burns tattoos
No one noticed it was too late
The venue now becomes a grave
I stand and watch the people crying
Licking flames they kiss the sky
The scene is swallowed in clouds of dirty smoke
All those emo kids have died

I stand and watch the people crying
Licking flames they kiss the sky
The scene is swallowed in clouds of dirty smoke
Box of matches at my side
