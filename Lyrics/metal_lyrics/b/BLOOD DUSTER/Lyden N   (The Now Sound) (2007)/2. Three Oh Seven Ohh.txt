I used to praise the North
And High St gave me a fat
But that's changed a fuck of a lot
And now I can't afford a flat
Artists and business men
Moved in overnight
Turned slums into apartments
Now how bout that?

Northcote sluts, trendy cunts,
Go and get fucked.
Northcote sluts, trendy cunts,
Go and get fucked.

Used to breathe the Northcote air
And it smelled like the dole
'Till all the artists came
It has taken a toll
Now everyone thinks its cool
It's not the Northcote I know
Out to Preston, I move out
Of the three oh seven oh

Northcote sluts, trendy cunts
Go and get fucked.
Northcote sluts, trendy cunts
Go and get fucked.

Three oh Seven oh
