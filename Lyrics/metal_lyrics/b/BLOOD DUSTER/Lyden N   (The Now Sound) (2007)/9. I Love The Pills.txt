I got a knack for taking everything in sight
Xanex and Stillnox baby
Help me sleep at night

I love the pills, the pills

Uppers and downers junior
That's what I crave
Walk like a zombie baby
In a fucked up foggy haze

Don't need no doctor know-how
To get no script
I got some mental mates
Who get me ripped!

Vals and Phernergan that's all I need
To bring me back just feed me speed

[Daryl Cotton (Zoot):]
"C'mon everybody take those pills out, throw em at the stage...clap your hands, c'mon, c'mon"... [clapping &amp; crowd cheering]

Vals and Phernergan that's all I need
To bring me back just feed me speed
