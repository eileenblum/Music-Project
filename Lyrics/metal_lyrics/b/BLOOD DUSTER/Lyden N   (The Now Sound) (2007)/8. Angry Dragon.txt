I love the ladies, I treat them right,
I feed them cocaine, and keep them up all night.
I share the wealth, the spoils of the game,
While Rizzo gets his dick sucked, I'm in the cunt again.

That's how I move,
That's how I keep my groove,
Cock rock

While we're fucking, Beltys will steal her stash
And when she's gone, I'll find another gash
To get my dick wet is what I do
I'm gonna find the perfect girl and pass her onto you

That's how I move,
That's how I keep my groove,
Cock rock
