I've got... a story to tell ya
Bout a little girl I know
She was mean... a bad seed baby
I met her at a show
She said well come on tony
Come on back to my place

But when I got there
She got crazy
Gettin off her face
She did smack
She did speed
Only thing she didn't do was what I need
She did lines
She did base
She couldn't function she was off her face
And then... she started tryin'
To get big t in bed
I said baby... your dyin'
Call a fucking doctor instead
She said... well come on tony
Come on back to my place
But when I got there

She got crazy
Gettin off her face
She's a junkie
She's a junkie
She's a junkie
She's a junkie
She's a junkie
She's a junkie

I've got... a story to tell ya
Bout a little girl I knew
Well she died.. an overdose did her
And she was twenty two
A life of needles... and a pipeIn her arms or on her lips
A sweet chick
With fuck all sense
Always off her tits.
