I met this girl
She was 16 and so sweet
She smiled and I would melt
A nicely packaged treat
With long hair
And big eyes
Fresh as fresh can be
This girl wants to get
The best of meshes...

16 16
I met her after
A rockin' show
We blew the crowd away
With our rock and roll
She said she liked it
I said that's cool
She grabbed me by the hand
And told me
She's still in school... yeah!
That's when I said...
I gotta go.
She's 16.... ... just 16
She's 16....... just 16
