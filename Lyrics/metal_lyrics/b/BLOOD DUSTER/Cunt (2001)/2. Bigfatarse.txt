Excuse me!
But you've got the biggest butt that I've ever seen
Twirl around and knock me down, it's really quite obscene
You're askin' me to feel it but I don't wanna be rude
The fucken thing it takes up room, and I'm not in the mood.

That fucken thing is massive, it is bigger than a Poof
I'm not used to stoppin' things, it's way too much
I'm gonna have to touch it just to see if it's true
I can't believe that fucken thing is attached to the back of you.

You have got the biggest butt I've ever seen
Twirl around and knock me down, it's really quite obscene
You're askin' me to feel it but I don't wanna be rude
That fucken thing takes up room and I'm not in the mood.
