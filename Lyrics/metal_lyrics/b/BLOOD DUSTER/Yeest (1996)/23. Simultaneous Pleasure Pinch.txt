Up the date
And up the cunt
With my fingers
I will hunt
Score you holes
Touch the sides
And grip the skin
That divides

The thumb in the ring
Middle finger
Up your cunt
Pinch it like a crab
Make the bitch feel the itch

Feel the pain
Will you cope
Nip the skin
From cunt and ring
This is not
An evil thing

Ease away
Out of the cracks
Like your fingers
Here comes some snacks
