drivin'fast, my cortina
engine bay, nothin' cleaner
super slick, super cool
i'm the burnout king and i'm no fool
scorin' chicks and layin' rubber
see me comin' run for cover!
looks real neat, goes real fast
and if something's wrong
i'll call chris and arch
drivin' fast, my cortina
engine bay. nothin' cleaner
super slick, super cool
i'm the burnout king and i'm no fool

Thanks to guy_pungent for sending tracks #6, #22 lyrics.
