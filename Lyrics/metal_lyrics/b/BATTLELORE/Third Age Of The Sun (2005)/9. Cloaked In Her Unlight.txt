Mother of the everdark
Wearing the cloak of shadows
The skin of the unlight
Wedding gown from fallen stars
In Arda obeying noone
Spinning the web of light undone
Singing her silent song
End the world and the sun
Queen of the last days
Rose from the abyss
The vilest creature ever been
On the soil from the Great Song
In Arda obeying noone
Whirling the clouds of light undone
Singing her silent song
For the new world of hers to come
Devourer of the Jewels
Destroyer of the light
Deadly web of the underworld
Growing her endless might
Terror for the one
Master who stands alone
Poison from her veins
To spoil the earth, death's embrace
Forever hunger for more
Known world under her net
Assault against the Dark Creator
The power of gods she bears
Mother of the everdark
Wearing the cloak of shadows
The skin of the unlight
Wedding gown from fallen stars
So spoiled by the master thief
Who shall fall in the Northern war
