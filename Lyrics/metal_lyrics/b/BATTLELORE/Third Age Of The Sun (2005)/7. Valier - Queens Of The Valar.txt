One with the light of the stars
Woke Firstborns of IlÃºvatar
One with the trees and the green
Planted all the first seeds
Hope for the others grief
She will come in misery
Ever-Young cares the blooms
Her sister caused the sun and the moon
Valier, Queens of the Valar
Sisters and wives of divine
Maid singers of the world
Composers, creators
One with the laugh and the dance
Spirit maiden in the woodlands
And one with the gift to heal
Gardens of LÃ³rien her realm
Weaver from Timeless Halls
Cast the fate of the other dawn
All the stories within time
In her clouds weaved with pride
Highest of Ainur in EÃ£
First from Eru's hands
Masters of Menel
Almighty of Arda
Valier, Queens of the Valar
Seven mothers of the earth
Concerned with life, tears and time
Pure beings of great beauty
Loving hearts, joy and majesty
Varda, Yavanna, Nienna
VÃ¡na, Nesse, Este, Vaire
