In the ancient woodland
Meet the oldest man
With a huge smile on his face
For joy and peace he stands
Boundaries of his green kingdom
Shall not be passed by the evil
Mastered with the might erstwhile
Meek in the stranger who crosses the line
Meet the maiden young and fair
Bearing beauty so rare
Even elves would praise her grace
Daughter of Bonfire Glade
Guards of birds, streams and herbs
Knock on their door disturbs
Blithe old gaffer and lovely maid
Share their hearty place
Iarwain Ben-adar
From the early days
Forgotten demigod
Or elder insane?
Pointy hat with feather
Bobbing around
Leather boots so huge
Coloured with yellow
Jolly tunes and rhymes
Sang out loud
The whole entity
Cheer and mellow
Touch of green, touch of gold
Their honest emotion
Through your heart
Through your soul
Their purest devotion
Touch of green, touch of gold
Their dearest creation
Through your heart
Through your soul
Their greenest carnation
