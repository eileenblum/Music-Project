Elven underworld
Colours of the stars
Their dens seal the love
That lies above
Elven underworld
So far from the stars
Their dens seal the love
For the night and the skies
Woods and wild
Air and light
Bones of the earth
Crafted by the Dwarves
Legacy of Naugrim
Caves of Menegroth
Dwarven illusions
All the cold and grey
Covered with green
Caves of Menegroth
Dwarven illusions
Walls of golden fey
Cover their realm
For once their eyes can see
The same harmony
For once not to care the race
Beards or ears, the brothers face
Hammers of KhazÃ¢d
Shaped the moutainside
Blasted like a lightning
The skill, the neat, the pride
Legacy of Naugrim
Elven underworld
Colours of the stars
Their dens seal the love
That lies above
Thousand caves it's stalk
Cursed by Sindar
All the beauty's gone
Under the waves
