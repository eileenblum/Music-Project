From I shore I have known for long
I heard enchanting songs
Meadow was dancing
By the flute and the harp
The water was silent and so calm
I walked to the path across the sea
I walked to the place ever unseen
Into the fields and the streams
Beyond the land of the dreams
Brif moment it took
Then faded away
I followed their song
Followed their way
Last sight of the sun
Until eventide
Showed me the road
Served me as guide
I walked to the path across the sea
I walked to the place ever unseen
Passing the walls, passing the signs
Opening hidden doors of my mind
On the shore I have known for long
I sang enchanting songs
