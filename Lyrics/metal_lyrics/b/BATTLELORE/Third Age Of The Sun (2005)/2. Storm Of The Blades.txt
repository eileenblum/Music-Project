Rely on your strength
Rely on your wits
Dare to fail and
You are no use to me
There won't be a time
There won't be a place
Where I never could
End your days
The hour of the battle
The storm of the blades
Choosing the legenda
The heroic names
Out from the shadows to fierce them all
To carry the signs of the warlord
Blood on your axe
Blood on your blade could be
Key to the life
You thought you won't see
Same to me if you will
Beg or if you'll cry
Fight for yourself
Or prepare die
Blood on my axe
Blood on my blade
Gods of war will remember my name
For the battle and heat
For the victory feast
This is the finest day
As your king
I demand you to fulfill this task
Show us you are worthy
And return with honour and pride
In your heart
If you should survive
You can come back and
Claim you reward
Bring us victory and I will make sure
That you will regain your freedom
Once again
