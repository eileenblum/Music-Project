Trollshaws
Short way to the East
Trollshaws
The land of the beast
You may hide on the hills
Lurk into the woods
We have already smelt your thrills
You can pray, you can run
For us it's more fun, we will crush you
And steal your goods
Woods in the North
By the Great East Road
Hideout for the brutes
Grave for the fools
Trollshaws
Short way to the East
Trollshaws
The land of the beast
Imprudent ranger will be in danger
Wiser one chose another road
Mindless adventurer, hero or rogue
Try to slain me and they'll give you gold
They will tear your Elven ears
Dwarven heads cut with their beard
Daring men shall run like hell
Deficient Hobbits eaten as well
Castles of Arnor
Deserted by wars
The ancient ruins
Liar for the grunts
They will tear your Elven ears
Dwarven heads cut with their beard
Daring men shall run like hell
Foolish Hobbits eaten as well
Goliaths of Sauron
Vagabonds of the night
Denizens of Trollshaws
Slayers of knights
