[Music: Jussi Rautio and Battlelore, Lyrics: Jyri Vahvanen]

Alatar
Ithryn Luin
The fallen one
Alatar

The chosen servants
Sent from the isle of Aman
Wearing the colours
Bearing counsel and aid
Alatar the noble Istar
Higher of Blue Wizards
One of the genuine three
The counter of history

Path of his led to the Eastern realms
Plans ill natured all concealed
He was lost among the others
Lust of power and dominion

The son of the Hunter
Who failed and forsake his task
One vision in sight
For the others he's blind
Alatar the fallen Wizard
Denies the lords, Valar
He followed the easiest way
No more gods to obey

Task divine forgotten
Into the realm of darkness
Fallen one will never rise
Before the dawn of demise
