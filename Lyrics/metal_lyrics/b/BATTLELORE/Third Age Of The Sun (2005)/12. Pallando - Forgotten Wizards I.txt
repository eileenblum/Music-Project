None amongst the living
Shall wield the power
Shall know the deepest secrets
Inside his mind
None amongst the living
Will foil his plans
Will follow his final path
Into the shadows
Gone by the Eastern wilds
Unnoticed of the great five
He was the silent one
He who comes afar
Istari, Ithryn Luin
Weakest was his heart
None amongst the dead
Shall have their peace
Shall get their freedom
Dominance of soulless
None amongst the dead
Will deny allegiance
Will doubt his away
Over, decease
Great power comes with chains
Fear of falling looms
It can be an eternal curse
Beware or it's your turn
