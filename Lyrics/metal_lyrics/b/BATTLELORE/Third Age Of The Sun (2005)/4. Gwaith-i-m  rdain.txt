Thousand years of peace
They lived together
No grudge nor greed
Without was heavenly better
Dwarvens artisans
The greatest elven smiths
Crowded the mountain halls
And city of Ost-in-Edhil

People of the jewel smiths
Gwaith-i-MÃ­rdain
People of the jewel smiths
Gwaith-i-MÃ­rdain

Thousand years of peace
They lived together
No grudge nor greed
Without was heavenly better
Two lores as one
Aroused the days of wonder
Casted the spells and charms
Unleashed the power of god

Once again they'll reveal
Their souls
Once again they'll see
Beyond the higher arts
By their hands were made
All the things
Crown of the Jewels
Enchantment of the Rings
