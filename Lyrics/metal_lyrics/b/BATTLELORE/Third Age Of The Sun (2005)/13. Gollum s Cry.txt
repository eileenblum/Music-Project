Weakest of moments are these
The choking hold of insanity
Loses it's grip and cuts me so deep
With the knife of clear memories
Of that innocent past which didn't last
Oh, no! No!
The precious of mine
For you I would die
My love, my life, my everything
For you I cry
But not anymore
The things will get better
I will come to you
And soon we'll be together
Forever...
