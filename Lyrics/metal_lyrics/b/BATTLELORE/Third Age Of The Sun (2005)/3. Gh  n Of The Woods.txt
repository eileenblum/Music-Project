Moves of the deep
Senses of the beast
Ancient people among the trees
Soil of their land
The way of the wind
Throne and the walls for the Woses
Be gone Orc-folk
Ruin GorgÃ»n
Be gone Troll-folk
Ruin GorgÃ»n
Gold from the sun
The wealth of the clan
Riches for soul of everyone
Rivers and lakes
The silvering moon
Kingdom of pearls their woods
Drain the hope from the souls
Of Orcish hordes when they are dead
Drain the life from their own earth
From the stars, from every birth
Druadan chieftain
GhÃ¢n-buri-GhÃ¢n
Wise from his mind
Pure from his heart
Druadan chieftain
GhÃ¢n of the woods
Fighting the wolves
Fighting the GorgÃ»n
Mother earth
Caring for her child
Forest folk
Her untamed kind
