Three feet of steel on my side
Tool of fate my reliable blade
Sharp enough to cut the scales
Pierce the heart, to rip the veins
Dwarf-made armor, galvorn shield
Finest gear to the battle I wield
Mithril helm an laen shade
Breath of dragon won't burn my face

To the lair of the beast I'll ride
With my magic it's easy to hide
In those caves full of remains
Of fallen heroes who died by flames

Brave hunter, true sowrdsman
Without fear he'll face the dragon
One strike, one opinion
If you fail it's your destruction

The task of yours almost forlorn
To hunt the dragons until they've gone
Plenty of sorrow they've laid for us
Tears od grief the river of pain
No more fear, you shall banish the bane
Carry on, in your blades we trust

To the lair of the beast I'll ride
With my magic it's easy to hide
In those caves full of remains
Of fallen heroes who died by flames
I won't fail, I have no doubt
But my sword I'll hunt them dead
Send their lives to the final rest
