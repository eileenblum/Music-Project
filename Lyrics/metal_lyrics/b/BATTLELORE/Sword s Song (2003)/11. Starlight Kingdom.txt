Eternal enemy
Wants nothing but war
But they chose another way
Hidden place for their people to stay

Under the stars they came
Proud and wise the elven race
Their journey has just begun
So much joy and sorrow to come
Great eagles, the guards
Kept the eyes of the evil away
So peaceful and calm
Safe from the hands of the darkness

White city of light
With mountains around
The Kingdom of Starlight
Blessed by the gods
Shades of the evil
The fighting, the harm
Can't reach the sons of the stars
All was too good
Too perfect, untrue
Betrayal in starfolk
Revealed the secret
He opened the gates
For terror and hate
And the armies of unlight arrived

Glory and light for the life
Their wish for the coming times
Kingdom to shelter their kind
Built in silence, not easy to find
Glory and light for the life
I wish dor the coming times
Journey has just begun
So much joy and sorrow to come
