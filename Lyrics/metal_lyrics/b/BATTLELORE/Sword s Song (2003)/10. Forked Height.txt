Walls of Isengard
Face the northern winds
Carved black pillars
Rising high up to the sky
Arcane relic
Crowned by the four peaks
Feels the auturnn breeze
From the fields of steeds

Orthanc, The Cunning Mind
Great Fang, Forked Height
Many narties for this towering sight
Sight as black as a night

Tall, black tower
Home for the Palantiri
Lair for the crystal globe
- foresight of might
Wizard so pale and old
Guarding the elven stone
He did not realise
The shadowed gaze of lies

Armies of new orc tribe
Marching as the Uruk-hai
Created by corrupted mind
Mind of Saruman the White
The war began and he almost won
Brave horsemen of Rohan
Anger of woods he did not see
Ents arrived, his enemy

The robe he carried, white as snow
Wasn't all the truth
The eastern sights of the Eye
Poisoned his mind
The tall tower of fair wisdom
Turned to fortress of chaos
Death and despair on the sky
Dim the sunlight
