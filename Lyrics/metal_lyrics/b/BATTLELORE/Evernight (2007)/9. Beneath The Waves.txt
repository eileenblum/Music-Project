Under the storm shone the nobe colours
Lords of the oceans from the Western shores
The Golden King in eternal valour
"Master the seas", in their blood forever

Port city, once healthy and fair
Set in doom by cancer and plague
Leeches and black water

The original sins, curse of Man
Forbidden course, drowning their stand

We have to go and seek the truth
Falling tears for my delirium

It is not a dream, the glorious land
In a palm of my hand

Unlearn the madness, forget the sea
It is just a dream, beneath the waves

Furious swells tore the soil apart
The broken ban, wrath of the Gods
Quakes and fire crumble the realm
The false kingdom, under the sea

You have been betrayed - Led astray
Guided to leave - You sail away
By your own greed, beneath the waves
