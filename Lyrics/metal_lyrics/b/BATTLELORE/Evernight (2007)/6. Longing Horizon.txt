Every morn I awake and look to the sky
Something is wrong, I can sense the passing time
Every night I close my eyes
I must move on

When I am watching the others, far away or next to me
Heir their words, hidden fears, smiling faces, swallowed tears
I have seen the circle, closing on me

Every day I feel my heart
Longing for the horizon
Maybe I could only stay
Look to the other way
For the guiding star

How much longer I can smother the pain
How much longer until my flame fades
Something more for me to see
Something more for me to adore

How much longer I can smother the pain
How much longer until my flame fades
Unknown world right there for me
It has to be the reason I am living for
