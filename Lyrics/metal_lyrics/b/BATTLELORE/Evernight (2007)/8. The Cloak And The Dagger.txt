The Second Land, the Eastern ride, into the cave where the serpents hide
Treasures of lies in disguise, unseen is the truth, fragile dreams

Only lies and fragile dreams

Refer the throne of forever-ice, unleash the fire from your eyes
Reveal the wounds and praise your kind, betraying words, blind belief

Welcome the loot, the king, the proof, this must be enough
Under the guard can't grow his roots, you won't see, it is too late

They saw his face and how he bowed, the torn black cloak
Everything disgraced, but who was the master
And who was the hound, they did not know, their faith was bound

From the heart, from the core, breathing ashes, forever fall
You heard his pain, words of remorse
He was invited, it is your own fault

Reclaim the throne of forever-ice, leash the fire from your eyes
Conceal the wounds and despise your kind
Betraying words, true belief
