I am here beside you, it is all you've got
In your grief and pain, no one else to trust

You cannot feel it, it is too close
You cannot see it, your eyes are closed
Your senses low, your body cold
Inside your head the flies and the worms

I am here beside you in your bliss and fame
Dragging you back, beyond the silent trail

You did not see from where it came
When it laughed, started the game
Amongst the others, called your name
Inside your head the flies and the worms

You are the mightiest, above them all
Your iron will makes them crawl
You have the power, the words of the wise
But it all comes behind the mask of flies

Sometimes I hope I drown, let it go and fade away
Fall asleep with a shelter and never wake up again
Step aside and leave the signs, save them for another day
I am too weak, I cannot fight, but I am still awake
