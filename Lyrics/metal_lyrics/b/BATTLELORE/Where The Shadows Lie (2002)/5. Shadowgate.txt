To the other side of known world
To the places where time doesn't exist

You see all of it, you have seen nothing
All is too much to understand
Only the higher minds so blackened and ill
Can travel beyond his thoughts

In the tower of damned darkness
The Lord of chaos, the witch of the eye
Holding the keys into the shadows
Watching over green lands
learning the ways of goodness
To prevent those shades of light
Light and its people in Arda
Weak fools, enemy forever
Enemy forever!

Gates of shadow, doors for demons
Demons of nether and void
Infernal landscapes and abyssic essence
Insane to the mind of a man
The world of unknown, enchanted domain
Fields of nightmare and fear
Like haunted dreams, darken realms
Homeland for the demonic beings

If you go, you may drown like a stone
Lose your soul and die a thousand times
Known evil is nothing there
And nothing is just the beginning
