The southern end of the Misty Mountains
Waters of Entwash and Limlight
There it stands, the mighty wood of great age
Hiding secrets from the early years
Once so green and great that it reached
All over the Eriador
Huge tracts of lost lands
Beleriand covered by this great vast forest

Creatures hiding in the deepest shadows
Keeping the darkest ones away
Great guardians, fathers of woods
Defending their ancient pride
Long ago they wandered the land
Nowadays there's left only a few
Others crushed by the armies of unlight

In Fangorn there lives the eldest one
The eldest of the ents
This forest named after him
Fangorn, Treebeard

The guardian of his lands
The oldest being in Arda
So much evil he has seen
So much shadows in his dreams
With his heart full of grief
He trusts and still believes
To his kingdom so serene
For his entlings and him

Hear me my fellow ents
It's time to march into the battle
The evil has raped our lands too much
So many brothers gone by the darkness

Every orc under the banner of the hand
Will be crushed by our hate and anger
Every Uruk who stands against our power
Will be teared apart form his life
The white hand of Saruman
All his glory soon beaten down
All the walls and towers of Isengard
Destroyed by the entish wrath
Die, die uruk-hai!

The war is over and all is silent
Ravens fly to Isengard
Tall creatures with the shape of a tree
Marching north with victory
Their work is now finished
Ents have crushed their enemy
Dead uruk's every where
Reign of Saruman gone for good
