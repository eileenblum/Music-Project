The Dark Enemy, a god called Morgoth
Hide himself in the pit of Angband
Evil jewels of his mind took a shape
Great wyrms were born

When it storms look up to the sky
To the battlefields those dragons will fly
Mighty claws for their furious fights
You shall never forget that sight

The winged ones swept the land below
With the thundering winds they destroy
Those with the breath of fire and flame
Burn the earth and all on their way
Their strength far greater than man's
And their lore grows forever and ever
Eyes with a magical gaze
When they scream lands and mountains will quake

Ride with the dragons high on the sky
Fight with your sword and lance
In battle, hear their fearless warcry
The enemy will have no chance

So beautiful in the light of the moon
Dance of the wings through the sky
Over the green lands below
Heading towards eternal grace
Forever these dragons will fly
Time has no power to touch them
Thousands of years they'll sleep like stones
In their caves full of treasures and gold
Many heroes have faced their destiny
Be aware, better leave these worms alone
Masters of magic, servants of steel
Dragonslayers and dwarven warmachine
Armies of man have fought so many years
Defending their lands on the battlefields
