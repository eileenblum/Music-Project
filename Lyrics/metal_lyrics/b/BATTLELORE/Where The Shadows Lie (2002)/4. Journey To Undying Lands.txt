Land of the Gods
Home for their human forms
You see the same stars
From their distant realm
mystic path you sail
To reach their presence
One part of mortal world
Creation, the Great Song

There's a land beyond the great sea
The final place of read harmony
To the shores of a far-away realm
Those lands my dream and my destiny
From the elven bay of Lhun
Our great journey shall begin
West our ships are heeding
To the harbour of the far away land divine

Over the deep waters
Facing the thundering winds
May Ulmo be on my side
All the way to the Enchanted Isles

Sailing the magical ships
A journey over the sea
Straight Road along the elves
Beyond the Spheres of the world

Somewhere behind the horizon
Two realms of Undying Lands
Valinor home of the Valar
Eldamar the elven domain

Without fear to the unknown sea
Forward with full sails
White ships of elven wood
Catching the fair wind
Soon I shall see my ream
The fate I truly believed
Land of magic and fantasy
Place for my final rest

Farewell my mortal friends
My time with you will be over
Hail the home of gods
Share my joy when I'm gone

Sailing the magical ships
A journey over the sea
Straight Road along the elves
Beyond the Sphere of the world

Over the deep waters
Facing the thundering winds
May Ulmo be on my side
All the way to the Enchanted Isles

Shall I ever see that coast
Kingdoms of Tirion and Alqualonde
Heart of the higher races
The realm of the gods, my eternal home
