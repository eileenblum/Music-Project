It's time for herotic deeds
The gift of courage and steel are your key
Those with glory shine like stars
The highest prize is to ride with victory

So many souls follow the path
Trusting their magic and blades
There has to be more than that
Fight with your heart or fail

Ages of war and sorrow
One needs much to survive
Danger hiding in the darkness around us
Your sword is the only law
Brave enough to challenge your enemy?
Never underestimate the power of evil
Those creatures are born to kill
Trust your blades and black blood will spill

Path of ancient gods of war
Will lead me to victory
Carrying the blades of death
I am the Swordmaster

For the honor of your knighthood
Ride with pride into your quest
Never doubt to raise your sword
For the justice which shall be done
Believe in your destiny
You are the warrior soul
Without fear against your enemy
The flame inside you will never fade

Fight for your king and brothers
We shall trust in you
Ride towards the eternal struggle of good and evil
Be aware, the enemy is strong
They are after your soul
Remember what you have learned
Let your sword be your destiny

Pray your gods if you fight against me
There won't be another dawn in your sight
My blades are thirsty for blood
Thirsty for blood and ready to fight

Path of ancient gods of war
Will lead me to victory
Carrying the blades of death
I am the Swordmaster
