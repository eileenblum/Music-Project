Deadly wardog without fear
Ramming through the battlefields
Mighty heroes and kings of men
Will be dead by this beast, insane
Skin of stone and bones of steel
Shredded bodies and blood will spill
There are no allies there are no mates
When this demon is out in rage

My bestial servants, now go
with hate and destruction

Twelve feet high and weight of stone
Crushing enemies' head and bones
No mercy you get from him
When he's here it's time to kill!

Beast of war with lust for battle
All the enemies' like a helpless cattle
Blades, arrows and hammers of war
All useless and this beast wants more
Olog-hai!

Raging goblin is out from hell
Deadly berserker of chaos and mayhem
With wargutteral and stench of death
he will come and crust your head
Your dead corpse eaten by ghouls
Flesh and brain there's left only bones
Only sun can stop this plague
But in the darkness you can feel his hate

Rage of Goblins!

Black blooded, red eyed and hateful in nature
Dwellers of darkness with lust for blood
They kill for pleasure and without reason
The rage of goblins will crush you down
