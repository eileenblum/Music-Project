It makes us cry without woe
Sear our skin and burn our eyes
why do you let them overcome
Why do you let them reign

The Western blaze forces us down
Under the earth we must flee...
Cover and bow
Swallow our pride
Fiery heart we can't tame
Until we move out from our caves
And thrive again

It makes us bend, be ashamed
Tear our will and stir our minds
Why you could not reign

The curse of the Daystar
The brilliant light
I will cast the nightfall
To dim the bright

Like flaming thorns
Into our veins
This dreadful creation
I shall rive

Fool is the one
Who would let them choose
We will strike in the dark
And elude until dawn
