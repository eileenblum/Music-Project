In the dead of night
The glowing eyes
In the midst of a sleeping town
A warm light, right behind
A glazed stare, it is a dragon

The Green Dragon

In the stream of life
The river of golden god
Welcome to the feast

Into the depths of it's lair
I shall sneak without fear
Night after night I will savour
It's treasures

Let us go to my stronghold
Let us go to my keep
Where I can truly breathe
With all my friends
