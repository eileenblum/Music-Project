What greater light Shall I obey
Like all immortals I will make my way
I've seen the rifts and heard the songs
I am immortal, must I obey

I can smell the fire
Hear the hammers and the wheels
I can feel the fear inside of me
No birds are singing
No sound of the trees
The growing darkness all around me

Third immortal
The lord and the servant

Do I have to ride
There are others in need
Must I call the lords of the skies
I know my heart
And I know my way
This is where the end
Shall begin

What greater light Shall I obey
Like all immortals I will make my way
I've seen the rifts and heard the songs
I am immortal, must I obey

Raining ashes tears of doom
There is a longer road
It's not a trick of the light
Crimson colours in the sky
I could fight, I could run away
I am here for the cause
The great Plan shall remain
For the reason I will stay

Third immortal
The lord and the servant
Spirit of the old
From the light of the ghost

I have been awake for too long
But now I know it's my time
I shall bow to the greater light
Like all immortals I make my way
I have been hiding all my power
I'm a servant I will obey
This will be my finest hour
This will be my finest hour...
