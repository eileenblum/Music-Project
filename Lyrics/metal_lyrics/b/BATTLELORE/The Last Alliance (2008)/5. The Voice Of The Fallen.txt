I am the one who speaks the truth
The only truth
you will ever need to hear

That is why I am here
You are worthy for the Eye
Whose council is fear and agony

I am his words
The one with the darkest dreams
I am the one who chants the curse
You could never resist his lies
The words you wish not to hear

Voice of the fallen
Cries from the other side
Would break your ears
Would break your mind
Forge of chaos
Commands and claims
Black speech and order
His silence and peace

Can not see into his eyes
No mirror for the soul
Can not break into his thoughts
Nothing but scattered screams

I shall turn your tears
Into ashes of the dead
You shall never forget the whispers
Inside your head

You will be lost in your fears
In the never ending rest
I shall speak until you drown
Inside your head
