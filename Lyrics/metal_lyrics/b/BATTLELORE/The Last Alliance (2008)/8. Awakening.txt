They shall not know
What I have done
I must hide you
My beloved one

From my heart
The painful desire
From my hands
The grand design
From my soul
The life and the fire

Into your flawless eyes

Come to me my child
Come to me the first born

My work is done

Come to me my child
Come to me my first born
Learn and blaze from me
Live from me my son

Open your eyes
Wonder my world
Breathe and arise
It is your turn
Wake up my child
Cold as a stone
The warmth of life
I shall grant you
