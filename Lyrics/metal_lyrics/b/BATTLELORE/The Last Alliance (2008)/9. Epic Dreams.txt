Another restless night
And I never knew
He had been my guide
Standing by my side
Still refused to believe
Denied all the answers
Right in front of my eyes
Was nothing but dreams

My darkness revealed
The promise from the skies
The end of this path

I have seen the golden gate

I saw a darkened figure
Standing in the water
Surrounded by the light
Beyond the Evernight

It was fear I breathed in
And shared his glory
The silence came again
With the shroud of mist
As I bound my fate

One single tear
And the fear was over in seconds
As I remembered
The oath of my ancients
Raise my kingdom
From this drifting void
Lead me through the night
To the enlightened land
