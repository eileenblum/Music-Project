I am the last of the Lords
Once great ruler of the lands
I am the Steadfast
The one in time to hold the specter

Under the curse
They'll live until the end
Their souls doomed to fail
As the darkness prevails
Under the curse
They'll live until the end
From the halls of the dead
They'll find their rest

I am the last of the Lords
Once known as a free man
Now I am a slave of the curse
Father of my dying kin

I am the last of the Lords

The fate is sealed
By the king of betrayers
The light is dying
For the house of the hero

The time has come
For the one and final sleep
To fulfill the curse
For the God of the Gods

The time has come
To watch your children die
To see them buried away
For the God of the Gods
They shall suffer
As the darkness prevails

Their journey begins
Beyond the light of the world
Their journey begins
Beyond the dark they dwelled in
