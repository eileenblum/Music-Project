I heard the voice
Didn't see behind the words
I saw the faces
Loved ones, unknown to me
I was asleep
And I never really woke
I had a dream
Made for me, already dreamed

All the days faded away
Carried by the endless eclipse
Black light of those enchanting eyes
Made me forget, walk astray

Kadottaen toivonsa
Tuhottuna tahtonsa
Murtuneena rankona
Astun alas hautaansa

I tasted the wine
But I didn't taste the life
Even when I felt the warmth
I was frozen inside
I closed my eyes
To run away, to stop the pain
But in my mind
I was enchanted again

Blood of mine
Not sacred anymore
Enchanted tie
The line of life in disgrace

SilmÃ¤in kutsu kadotuksen
Valtoihinsa saanut mielen
Mukanansa hÃ¤net vieden
Sielunsa imien
KÃ¤Ã¤rmehisen silmÃ¤t katsso
Nujertaa hÃ¤net tahtoo
Mas kutsuu pimeyteen
Ikuiseen unehen
