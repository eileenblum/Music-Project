I don't want you to feel
I don't want you to hear
I don't want you to know my name

I don't want you to feel
I don't want you to see
I don't want you to know my name
I don't want you to feel my shame

The aftermath of the battle
Still haunting in my dreams
Freed but still under veil of sleep
The Iron of the Flaming Star
The gloom with a naked blade
Slew him with pain blinding my eyes

The deep dark fate follows my path
The curse spoken out times ago

Hide behind these stains
Grief burdens my name
I am the Bloodstained
I am the kin of Ill-fate

The lands of wandering and despair
Struggling on and on
The day failed, the dark storm rose
Naked blade flashing in the night
