Arise from the oblivion
Burn like no other before
Dare to face the olden gods
Feeble and drained coven
Unlight of your heart
Matching their might in immortality

Ashes and stone
First sight of the void
Breathe from my eternity
Grow stronger from their fear

This kingdom was never meant to last
As they carried the banners of the blind
Feed the faith of our false vision
Set the last stone on their road
True dark, reverse of the first light
Always there, behind the sun
Discordant in the song of creation
By the ghostly choir it is sung

Hear me, oh mighty first one
Reveal your golden light
Reek your poison to their lands
Seek their saviour and defile

Eyes of the wolf
Our ever burning fire
Under the darkened wings
