In the skies no trace of light
This eternal night I call my own

Let me forget the dawn
Let me rise again without the fear
Let me forget the dawn
Let me linger behind the oblivion

The dragon flies across the skies
Forgotten dreams I call my own
I'll burn away the olden days
Undying flames I call my own

The vile tragedy revealed by the morn
The demon's hour, the reaper's call
I call my own

I bear the name of the Lords
A broken throne I call my own
Darkness deep lies within
The fallen kings I call my own

In darkness lie forgotten cries
This starless trail I call my own
The fate of man doombound and damned
These blackened lands I call my own

Hope and trust forever lost
The way of betrayal I call my own
The eerie chills deep-within
These wounds I bear
Yet I am fearless
