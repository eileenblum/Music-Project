Confused, frightened child
Run away into the wild
Leave your memories behind
Gone are the days of old

Come with me and live again
Into the light show me the way
Be my guide and I will follow
From the hide of my shadows

So close yet too far
They lived in the dark
The last blight was done
As they wandered as one

Same blood, same life
Under the black clouds
Spells and lies in disguise
Their fate was bound

Death and grief after all
The Dragon-Helm won't see the dawn
The curtain falling down on me
All is lost, I have nothing more

Filthy beast what have you done
She felt the poison on your tongue
Dark waters took her away
Is there a reason to see another day

Black sword of mine
You have danced a thousand times
Once more I'll ask you to feed
This time feed on me

This land learned their name
Saw their fall and took their graves
The doom and the shame
The fate of the betrayed
