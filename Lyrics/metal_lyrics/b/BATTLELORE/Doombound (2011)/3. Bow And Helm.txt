Guidance shown by the stars
The way whispered by the winds
To the land of the legends
Land of Bow and Helm

Dread Helm!

In the midst of winter
They met again
Heroes' reunion
Rise of a dragon
Lights the fires of hell
To sear the black beasts

Brave and faithful Wardens of the South
Fought from his heart to bring silence to the dark
Grim and fierce Hunter of the North
Battled in hate to ease his pain
Until the shores of the Timeless Halls
Washes away his sorrow

Fear and death
For the hordes of Gorgoroth
Hope and freedom
For the men of Middle-earth

Strongbow!
