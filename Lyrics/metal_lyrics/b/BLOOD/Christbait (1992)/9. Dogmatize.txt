I'm right, you're wrong - you're weak, I'm strong
Your words are dotage,
My mouth tells the wisdom
These are the men in the white jackets
In hospital
DOGMATIZE - shut up, and be quiet
The doctors life - the patients death
DOGMATIZE
Rip this at arm, cut that leg -
Ampute this hand, open this head
Infections, tablettes and inhalations,
The people becoming things
Slaves of the medical practioners....
DOGMATIZE
