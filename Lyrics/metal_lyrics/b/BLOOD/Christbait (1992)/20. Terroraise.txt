Welcome to the TERRORAISE
The movies weren't enough
You got sick of all the fakes -
And now you want some blood
Pick up your hero place your bets -
I wonder who will die
TERRORAISE - life is so cheap
TERRORAISE - you must stay on your feet
Smell the sweat taste of blood - in your movie seat
Think of what the future holds -
When death is the retreat
Kids will grow up fat on violence -
Murder is the norm
And you'll be in the picture-show-
Like just another pawn
TERRORAISE
