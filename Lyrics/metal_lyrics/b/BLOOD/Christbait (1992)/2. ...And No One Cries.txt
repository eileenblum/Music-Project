1000 eyes look at you - 1000 things becoming true
Things of passion things of crime - Life is short so use your time
You aren't safety at the street - A sacrifice of human breed
Pain is slipping very deep - if you fall in endless sleep
Your friends dies - ... AND NO ONE CRIES
The feebleness of your body - impossible to study
They tell you what to do - personality is cut in two
You're a victim of lies - ...BUT NO ONE CRIES
Weakness - disease - misery - for me
Million eyes look at you million things becoming true
Things of passion things of crime - Life is unreal so waste your time
Pain is slipping very deep - you fall in endless sleep
