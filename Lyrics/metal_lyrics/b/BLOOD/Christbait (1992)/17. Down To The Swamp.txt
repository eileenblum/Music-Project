The swampy creatures - full of slime
Green and red of human bloody innards
Will raise the mangled torsos
There's no hope in everlasting haze
Down - this is the final settlement
To the swamp -
Goring the votaries of slipping mutants
is this our determination?
Shrinks our horrendous magalomania
DOWN TO THE SWAMP
It's the final settlement
