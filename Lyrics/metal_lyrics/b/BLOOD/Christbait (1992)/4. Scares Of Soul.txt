You do so cool - you are the boss
Listen to hard music - look the bloody films
Laugh about catastrophes - be happy when men die
Like the execution - and so the abortion
Feel the horrible SCARES OF SOUL
Their existence is eternal
In the night you hear the owl
Your shower is supermal
In the night you dream - of love and safety
No one talks to you - no friend, ever be alone
When you arrive everywhere - others left this place
So no one is here - only you in your fear
THE SCARES OF SOUL forever
You can't discribe their existence
The truth be offered never
You're nobody acceptance
