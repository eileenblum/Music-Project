Dogmas of the past - thou holy might has faded
Traditional rites - misunderstood in modern days
Religions turn to helpless - the feeble is discovered
I came back from a journey to future
Walked through mists others couldn't move
Discovered things you can't imagine
The day will come you go through 'em
Death ... of millions
Funerals ... of millions
Continents ... swallowed by the sea
A god ... who left the world
False prophecies became true
The holy might has got nobody
PAST BELIEF CESSION has begun ... I'm nobody
