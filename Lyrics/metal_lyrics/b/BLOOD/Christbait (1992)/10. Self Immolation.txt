Engulfed in the flames
A mother and her unborn child
Too feeble to escape
In death the wife give life
Mummified flesh born of the deceased
A miscarriage such a misery of prenatal death
Embodiment of dead flesh
Procreated of her remains
A stillborn beloved child she'll never see
the dead freaks she begots
SELF IMMOLATION
...A sick way to die
