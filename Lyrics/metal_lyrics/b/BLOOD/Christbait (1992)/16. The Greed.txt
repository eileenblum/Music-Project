In danger to start a futile war
They think to make some sewer laws
Conceivable - false thoughts produce a reaction
Serious - be able to erase a civilasation
Thoughtful - to hope to get a peaceful life together
guess - what happens and better remember
Tantalizing and bled - THE GREED
The commonsense is captive of confused souls
The tale will often change their rolls
Determined of an authority mightier
as mankind will imagine
The power prevents the incurable corpse
The corpse of a technology who killed all humanity
Tantalizing and bled - THE GREED
