The medicine marches forward
To a perfect of all organs
The life expectancy becomes bigger
To the total immortality
A body of silicon
The time of cloning has just begun
Die - you fucking freaks
Annihilate the BOUGHT BEAUTY
The ugly-faced rich
Bought new parts of their body
Through cosmetic operations
From head to feet
The reek of putrefaction is in you
The pulpy alied material starts to rot
The pulsating pap in your veins
Punish you for that wicked fault
