Go and see the technical evolution
The world's full of computized things
See the washmachine, look at the record player
None has been made by hand
You buy the things and all looks good
But you mustn't wait too long
To see the shit TECHNICAL ABORTION
Now you only can throw them away
Mystic sounds of your TV - extreme heat of your rack
No mechanic could help you -
It's too complicated for all
It looks like programmed bombs inside the appliances
That blow up after the guarantee is lapsed
