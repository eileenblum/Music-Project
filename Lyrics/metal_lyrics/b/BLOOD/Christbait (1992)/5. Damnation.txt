DAMNATION - of your past
Stigmatized of gone activities
Society don't forgive your faults in younger years
You hate the state
Political activities aren't important for you
But everyone asks you for your public opinion
DAMNATION
Are you right answer
You don't fit in their political scheme
DAMNATION
The public domain is not your territory
Something goes wrong in the social-gathering
You aren't the only one who made rags
DAMNATION
But people call you nauseous
Aren't they disgusting themselves
Aren't they damned by their past
Aren't alone as you are alone
