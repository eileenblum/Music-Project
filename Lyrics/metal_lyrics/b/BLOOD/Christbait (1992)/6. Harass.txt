As soon as torn from womb until death
I'll stand in your way
Setting a barrage to these souls
Which christian and holy
Locked the doors to your refuge
Keep one's eye on all fellow-believers
Prepare for bloodshed to the final punishment
Wickedness has haunted christ-possession
HARASS believer ..... delete lord's prayer
Engrained wicked ..... god dethroned
HARASS believer ..... enmity of fraud
Engrained wicked ..... enthronization
