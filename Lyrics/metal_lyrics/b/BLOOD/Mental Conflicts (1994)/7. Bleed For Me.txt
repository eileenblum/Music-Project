Lay your hand on a thing
to see how it grows

eye for eye - tooth for tooth
mankind dream of peace, doesn`t see reality

BLEED FOR ME... bleed and die

end you dream - or you`ll loose
stop thinking about mindless things

BLEED FOR ME... bleed and die

fight you fight and hit back
one word of weakness and you`re dead

prisoner await freedom
like believers await the dead
