I enter the gate
of MORPHEUS land
I cannot discern
what`s real or a dream

find the way to live
to take and to give
you loose all you have
while visiting MORPHEUS

horrible creatures - behind me
morbid tales - become true

you reached me, you got me, I don`t knew - MORPHEUS
in my sleep, in my dream, in my life - MORPHEUS
my escape, no chance to hide - MORPHEUS
