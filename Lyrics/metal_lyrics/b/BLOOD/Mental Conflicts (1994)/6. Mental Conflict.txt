Senses lost in the forest of madness
sweat blood stops pulsation
eyes watching at black silhouettes
a bitting conflict deep inside

MENTAL CONFLICT

a fight between flesh and it`s spirit
an emptied brain by a mental vacuum
every breath die in the throat
a suffocation of the flesh

the heart rots in sea of tears
a tremendous anguish overwhelms the consciousness
hear the lamentation soul
as it experience hollich tortures

fears of death, infernal illusions,

suicidal tendencies, spiritual misery

MENTAL CONFLICT
