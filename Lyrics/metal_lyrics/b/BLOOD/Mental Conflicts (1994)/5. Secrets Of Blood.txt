Blood - 
the secret of life
the secret of death
a grip into the blade
a scream of pain
you see red floods left your body
stunned of fear

more blood flooded earth
the secession of life begun

SECRETS OF BLOOD

and ended with your dead
you awaken in your sweat

SECRETS OF BLOOD

oh god, it was only a dream
next time it could be reality

... SECRETS OF BLOOD
