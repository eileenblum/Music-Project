In the afternoon of august, 18th 1973
five young people in a VW van
run out of gas on farmroad in south Texas
four of them were never seen again
the next mourning the survivor, Sally
hardesty enright was picked up on roadside

bloodsoaked and screaming murder

Sally said she had broken out of a window in hell
the girl babied a mad tale:
a cannibal family in an isolated farmhouse
chainsawed fingers and bones
her brother, her friend hacked up for barbeque
chairs made of human skeletons
 - ever and ever again

reports of bizarre, grizzly chainsaw mass murders
have persisted all across the state of Texas
the massacre has not stopped
 - it haunts Texas ...
