Oh dream - who delighted me
what I haven`t seen - I threw my tired limbs

down in your valley 
a take that runs silver
the shadow of bushes - around

I looked through the shrub
a nice girl near by the lake
for a bath she began
to drop all her clothes

`till a white robe
that wriggled in the wind
her free breast - laughed
my look stood still - into her

where I fell my lust
she starts, what a pleasure
to drop her last clothes
suddenly I awaked

and she run away
I wish to fell asleep again
then she would be inside the water

AWAY IS AWAY
