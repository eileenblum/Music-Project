See the creature - unconscious
squeeze and lean - they sleep
cathed in nature`s paradise
at spring of beauty - they rise
feeling mood - or a disease
always tested - and deceive
deceive about - brightness - darkness
storm and breeze - alternating

fast - slow

to unconsciousness
expunge the human mistakes
unconsciousness
make success and trespass

-repeat-

dreams become reality
saw the doctor`s face laughing
arms are broken, one leg is remove
the bain is handing on - threads

calling the god
who direct all mortals
cry for the CROWN COURT
who has white garments

cry for the CROWN COURT
who has pungent tools
calling the god
to stop the inhuman
- killing, killing, killing
torture, torture, torture

cry for ...
... to stop the inhuman killing
