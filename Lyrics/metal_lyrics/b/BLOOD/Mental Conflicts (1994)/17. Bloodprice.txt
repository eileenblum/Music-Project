After falling asleep
my pain begun
innocent - I`d be thrown into prison

innocent -  I`d be tortured
innocent - I will die

do you want to die thousands of deaths?
or only the one who is sure for you?

hear my words - tell them you are a witch ...
tell them, tell them ... and die!

I awaked - and asked myself
am I dreaming - or am I dead?
