Darling stop confusing me
with you wishful thinking
hopeful embraces
don`t you understand

I have to go through this
I belong to here where
no one cares and no one loves
no light, no air to live in

a place called hate
the city of fear
I dream dead it stops hurting
I dream dead and hurting stops

It`s sometimes like sleeping
curling up inside
my private tortures
I nestle into pain

hug suffering
caress every ache
I dream dead
it stops hurting
