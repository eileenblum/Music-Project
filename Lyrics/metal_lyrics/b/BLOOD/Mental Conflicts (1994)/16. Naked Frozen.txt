in the grip of winter
I get lost in the forest
I`m fighting with the bear
a frosty wind blows in my face

I lost my clothes while running
my broken will against
the strength of agony
who will win?

a navigator into fear
one moment of silence
the ice is thin ...
... too thin for me

NAKED FROZEN

I`m trapping into frozen water
one hour later
ice is closed again
`till summer burns the ice
