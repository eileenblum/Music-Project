Inclination
with over us though
as a wind
that melt on our skin, fading,
become proximity and coagulate
I plough through your skin
and you direct my body in right positions

coincide it with lips
and give me an overdose of life
THE FAVOUR OF ECSTASY
with you
wipe away all questions
without scrupul
I dive into your ego
that adsorb me to fill you
to suspend beyond the time
THE FAVOUR OF ECSTASY
with you
 - the only answer
