On for a muse of fire that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene
[Shakespeare, HENRY V]

Who threatens my throne of darkness?
Who is the judas, the betrayer of my reich?
Wherever you dwell
Trying to hide from my revenge
A curse shall be your reward
Comedy of life never ends
Generations the successors of unforgiving
Wear the crown of a king
In the carnival of triviality

[Martin Witchskinner 5/93]
