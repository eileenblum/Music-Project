After years of suffering - you are gone
But you thought to enter - a better world
...nothing like that
You lie in a dark chamber - can't move aside
Want to leave this place
But your body's already dead
Year after year you wait at this place
And nothing happens - you get weaker and weaker
The coffin starts to rot
Sand's falling down and maggots eat your flesh
LAMENTATION
You want to scream, but you are dead
LAMENTATION
Feeding the time with your body,
But the bones will survive
LAMENTATION...LAMENTATION...
Sand's falling down...

[Eisen 2/93]
