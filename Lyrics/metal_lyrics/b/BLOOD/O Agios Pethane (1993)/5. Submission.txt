The sun enveloped in haze - like it's beam
Oh - my life's moon! Sway in shadows
Sleep and smoke to one's heart's content
Be serious and discreet
And drive into the abyss of dreary and pain
So I praise you!
Like a star awakened the cloudy night
One time you want to beam at a place
Which succumbs the dark delusion
All right, I draw my dagger -
I have no choice
You're a slave of lust in tiredness and greed
Inflame your eye at the desirous brightness
Inflame face to face with the dead...
Be dark like the night
Be like a web in the dawn
With every string,
My body trembles and glows for you
This is my SUBMISSION
To the dead and evil ones
You hellrose - I can't live without you...

[Eisen 9/92]
