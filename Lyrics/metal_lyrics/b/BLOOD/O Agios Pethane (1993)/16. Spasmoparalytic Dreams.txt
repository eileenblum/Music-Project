Every night you frightened up
Bathed in perspiration - you stood in your bed
And attempted to remember -
At your dream of terror
SPASMOPARALYTIC DREAMS -
The hour of horror
Already now you have fear,
When you fall into sleep
SPASMOPARALYTIC DREAMS
One night the mutants thrashed down again -
Harder than ever before - you can't move around
And died misery in your fright
SPASMOPARALYTIC DREAMS
Shivering fit - agony - grinding flesh in your hand
Nightmare masks of death - their looks gore you
SPASMOPARALYTIC DREAMS

[Eisen 2/88]
