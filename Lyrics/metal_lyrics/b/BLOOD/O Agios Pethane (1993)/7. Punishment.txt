Lying here - waiting for the end
Release myself from life's punishment
Escape to the void I came from
Leaving behind a darkish, disturbing world
PUNISHMENT - I never asked for life
PUNISHMENT - My will is free - my choice suicide
The final dormancy I adore, dying is the name
Realize I'm weeping with laughter
As I found I always fathomed for
You shall obey - I will not
Searching for the true delight
The cannot rot one with eternity
Forever I will sleep

[Martin Witchskinner 4/93]
