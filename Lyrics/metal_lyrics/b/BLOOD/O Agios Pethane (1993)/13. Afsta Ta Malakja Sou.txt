In a frozen night
You were eaten by your nightmare
But GOD LEFT THE WORLD
He lost the battle
One night after another
Your days are counted
It's a journey through an endless tunnel
In the name of satan
GOD LEFT THE WORLD
Your life will end in suicide
Body be eaten by worms
Nothing but death remains

[Eisen 6/93]
