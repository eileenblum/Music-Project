break the spell to a netherworld
fight against the tricks of the enemy
picked to pieces by machinegunfire
survivors in a trench
order to destroy
lawless is the battle
remorse is unknown
prisoners get liquidated

merciless the tanks
blasting steel beyond horizon
shatters the stand of the opponent
pulverise all men

in a positional warfare...
we crush them down!

bombs smash down the huts
napalm erases all snipes
this village is wiped out
just craters to the gorund

in a positional warfare...
we crush them down!
