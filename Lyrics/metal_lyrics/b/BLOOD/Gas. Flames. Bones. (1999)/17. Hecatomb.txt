death rides with me tonight
inflamed with endless hate
a victim in my sight
I will be your fate

how many bombs to kill?
how many tons of dynamite?
how many corpses to build a heap?
how many hecatomb to fill massgraves?

death rides...

bombs and bombs and deaths and deaths,
but no one wants to stop this stress
two tribes dream to win
but only loosers in this fucking sin

hecatomb - no one's staying alive
hell's on earth an will rest for a while
the epidemic is satan's right hand
to suffer the remaining ones to death

mass destruction for their greed
million victims have to bleed

death rides...
