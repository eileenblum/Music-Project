flames devour - skin and hair
flames devour - flesh and blood
only a one way route
countless wagons arrive
selected ones have to take a shower
a shower of gas!

first they hold their breath
gas crawls through their lungs
the incinerator must be fired
fired by human corpses
flames and gas

flames devours all skin
flames devours all hair
flames devours all flesh
those flames devours all bones

flames devours everything
remaining gold and bones divided

the smoke smells strange
like a cemetary place
