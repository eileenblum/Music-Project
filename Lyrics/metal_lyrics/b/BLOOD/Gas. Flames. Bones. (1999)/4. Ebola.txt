something loudless, invisible has infected your body
can't recognized that your days are counted
you think you got a cold
but the next day you spit out your innards

your lungs are just a braddlin mud
feasting from inside your body
you cry bloodstained tears of the incredible
pressure from your eyes

braincells rotting, fever burns - Ebola
skin is bursting, everything hurts - Ebola
the virus got ya, the virus kill ya - Ebola
you're cursed to death with Ebola

you'll die a painful death and all
who be with you get infected
no way to escape
the virus will survive!
