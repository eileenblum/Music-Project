maggot are goin' to enter you,
maggots in your face
maggots all conciding you,
passing through your veins

maim all bloody flesh
slipping in your ears
maggots eat rotten maggots
you are the dead defenseless feast

watch at your remains in grave
the plague left behind
a handful of bones
it's the kingdom for worms
embedded in mucus slime
