I'm waiting for the last sun down
I'll bring the world to an end
for the murder and my lust
excruciation, fulfillment needed

the tank is my horse to ride
I'l charge this horse on through death

a perishment in utter ecstasy
I'll kill the slut called hope

when darkness enshrouds the light
I'll destroy your futile race

your children will learn to be warriors
on the land soiled by their parents blood

when mt bayonet drips red
you'll see me in another world

bodies dressed in earth's mud
morality is a funeral pyre
