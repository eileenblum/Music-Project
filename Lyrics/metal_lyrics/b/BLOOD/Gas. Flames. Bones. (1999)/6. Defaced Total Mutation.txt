born as a cripple, body misfigured
tortured from continious hurts
creeping through existence
no conversation, no tender caress
only spitted upon, pushed around
and get punched in face

... in face?! - but in what face?
just lump of deformed skin
howls and screams - all unheared
incredible suffer mental desolation

no chance for healing
born as the inhuman creation
you are the defaced total mutation

2011

2011... death
