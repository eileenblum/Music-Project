take heed and bear witness
to the truths that lie here in
for they are the last
legacy of conflict

there is a war
that rages on even now
beyond the fields
of derangement

War ~ between kingdoms of burning hells
it is known as the great conflict

it has raged and burned longer
than any stars in the sky
neither side ever gains
sway for long

as th eforces of light
and darkness constantly
vie for control over all creation...

war, war, war...
