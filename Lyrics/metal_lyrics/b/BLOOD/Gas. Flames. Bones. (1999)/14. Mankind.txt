mankind - a plague on earth
destroyer of environments
bury all creatures expect itself

mankind will kill itself
... kills everyday that moves

mankind - this word means death
destruction, agony, ignorance
blood of the innocent unborn life

mankind will kill itself
... kills everything that moves

mankind will also kill you!
