move on, hold and drag
invade no ones land
take a look in their starved eyes
mean more than a leading hand
now scrape and borrow in grimness
the groaning, fever and praying
the convulsion and screams of dying
reach for you
you are the borderguard between life and death
the game you play is the game against god
