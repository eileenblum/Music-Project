everyday you read the news
everyday you watch the tv
religious fanatics call themselfs soldiers of god
and fell in war with also stupid idiots

shooting and bombing in the streets
tongues of the feast its meat
'holy wars' their leaders scream

holy war - we don't care about you
we won't waste any tear
keep on lightning stupid violence
die by bullets then rules silence

believe your leaders - believe your god
keep on bombing that
