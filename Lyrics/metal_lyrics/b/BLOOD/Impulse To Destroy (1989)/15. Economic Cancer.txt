See what the blind faith led to:
goliath - like industrial complexity: the multinationals
exploiting 3rd world workers and earth's resources
taking hold of their energy - intensive technologies

producing things no one really needs
waking the desire by nice TV - spots
paying politicians to represent their interests
ECONOMIC CANCER, ECONOMIC CANCER,
ECONOMIC CANCER, ECONOMIC CANCER
