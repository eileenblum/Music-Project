I'm right, you're wrong - you're weak, I'm strong
your words are dotage, my mouth tells the wisdom
these are the men in the white jackets at the hospital

DOGMATIZE - shut up and be quiet
the doctor's life - the patients death
DOGMATIZE

rip this arm, cut that leg - ampute this hand, open this head
injection, tablettes and inhalations, the people becoming things,
slaves of the medical practitioners...

DOGMATIZE

[Eisen 12/87]
