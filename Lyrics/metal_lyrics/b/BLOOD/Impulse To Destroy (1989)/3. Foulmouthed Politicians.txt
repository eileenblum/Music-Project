They talk about disarmament - but they build new weapons
they talk about nature conservation - but they poor the waste in the water
they wants to save the trees - but they drive the biggest unclean cars
we love them all - they are our best friends

they would stop the animal slaughter - but they give money to support this
they talk about helping the 3rd world - but they only sell them military material
they say that we are a free state - but they supervise us with the police
we need them - we can't decide about us!

[Eisen 9/87]
