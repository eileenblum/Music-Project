God and Jesus are only visions of the mankind
a kreating of some people to earn money
they are called parsons and their buildings are churches

JESUS NEVER LIVED
JESUS NEVER LIVED
he's only an invention of some cheats

these parsons tells the believers lies
peace and luck are a good world
but they are the ones who make the fat money

JESUS...

they drive their big cars and live in showy bungalows
their richdom is swindle of the good - believers
so hold distance from these scum and the complete church - shit

JESUS...

JESUS...
