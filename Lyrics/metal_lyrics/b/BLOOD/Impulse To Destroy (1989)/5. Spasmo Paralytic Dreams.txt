Every night you frightened up
bathed in perspiration - you stood in your bed
and attempted to remember - at your dream of terror

SPASMO PARALYTIC DREAMS - the hour of horror
already now you have fear, when you fall into sleep
SPASMO PARALYTIC DREAMS

one night the mutants thrashed down again -
harder than ever before - you can't move around
and died misery in your fright

SPASMO PARALYTIC DREAMS - shivering fit - agony
grinding flesh in your hand - nightmare masks of death
their looks gore you - SPASMO PARALYTIC DREAMS

[Eisen 2/88]
