Retribution - for the pain inside
petitionfor mercy - blent with a vengeance and venture
hate burns down - the boundary of responsibility
contradiction beyond a glitter face - that only smiles
creating a contentment - who freezes resistance up
cold wake up - in your fanatical anger

NO REGRET for your foolish action
no resturation for the time beeing proud
NO REGRET for the impression before
no resturation - no creating - no contentment at all

lost friends - interior decay
alone with your minds - day by day
no resistance - indifferent screams
cold wake up of grey dreams
surround from false regret

NO REGRET...

lost friends...

-dedicated to false politicians and friends...
