A group of teens spend their holidays in a
every day they swim and play and have lots of fun
no parents who made them rules
no father who said them what to do
no school, no work - only sparetime and freedom

it's a BLOODY SEASON
in the summer holidays
alone in the forrest
BLOODY SEASON

but then some of them were missed and foun dead
with knifes in the heart and hedge - shears in the eyes
now they ran away, but the murderer is on every place
one by one he caught and finished their lifes

it's a BLOODY SEASON...

Aaaaaargghh

it's a BLOODY SEASON...

[Eisen 9/86]
