We've reached the turning point - 
We had to chose from live and death
the latter is easy to activate:
going on feeding flames - soon
we'll be burned down by our self - interest...

streets of mutants, cannibalistic bulls
the end of civilization, but no chance to begin new
it's the nature's repose - and death
but now all's be quiet and no one could change this

RETROGRESSION -
RETROGRESSION

[Eisen/Bestial Bernd 1/88]
