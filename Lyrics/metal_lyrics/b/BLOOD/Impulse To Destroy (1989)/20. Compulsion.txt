You see your pass will expire and went to the office
you knock at the door, but nobody takes notice
the toad stands up and lean on the table
- too lazy to help
you feel like a chicken in a cow - house
- like a rebel
the story was told - the answer was the coronation
- the cruise starts
running - it was a short to finish
crooking - to fold up the books and pencils
the toad tells the fairytale and the cross - examine begins
five minutes work for them - twenty for you
they receive money for that - you give up for it
you run to the next office - money for you
- COMPULSION
when you change your residence - the same cruise again -
COMPULSION

where is the logical thinking - aren't we hollow?
we make it complicated to save us, but the illegal subjects
get always what they want - why?
