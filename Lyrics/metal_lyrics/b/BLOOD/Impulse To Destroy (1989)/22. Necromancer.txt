The rocks of the valley were cruel
but the soldiers made no complaint
indeed, few of them had lips to frame a protest
the wizard's troops were beyond pain or fear of death
they were already dead!
NECROMANCER

from his zombie-borne palaquin
the wizard glowered at the rock-stream wilderness around him
his inner eye saw farther

nothing lived in that desert - but something moved
a small group of shadowy forms, little more than grave-dust in the shape of a man
wraiths! - but not his!
NECROMANCER

he wondered who his rival was!
only another NECROMANCER would control a wraith-
or know the miasma and cover its treasure
NECROMANCER
