in danger to start a futile war
they think to make some server laws
conceivable - false thoughts produce a reaction
serious - be able to erase a civilisation
thoughtful - to hope to get a peaceful life together
guess - what happens and better remember

tantalizing and bled - THE GREED

the commonsence is captive of copnfused souls
the tale will often change their rolls
determined of an authority mightier as mankind will imagine
this power prevents the incurable corpse
the corpse of technology who killed all humanity

tantalizing and bled - THE GREED
