At night he sleeps, all day he works
monday 'til friday - he only lives from weekend to weekend
then he gets sparetime for his many hobbies

every day he tells his friends such bad things about the world and the shit state
what should be better and that's all fucked up

he says that his money is very low
but twice as big as the income most of his friends
and his work is the hardest ever but after work he makes lots of sports

UNSOPHISTICATED SOREHEAD

after closing work he goes shopping for many marks
his home looks like a noble bungalow
his car cost only 40000 marks - no money for more

he's such an asshole and a boastful man
and that's the true reason which he's a sorehead
only he doesn't know it!
