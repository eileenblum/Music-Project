Watch them try to explain the things of life but
understand that these "things" have their own lifes

life is a circulation of circulations
LINEAR LOGICAL INTELLIGENCE at it's end
life is the circulation of circulations

these circulating process can't be explained in terms of linear - logical thinking, never... - never!!!
