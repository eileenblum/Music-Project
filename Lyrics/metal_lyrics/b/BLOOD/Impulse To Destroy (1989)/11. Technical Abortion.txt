Go and see the technical evolution
the world's full of computized things
see the washmachine, look at the record - player
non is been working by hand

you but the things and all looks good
but you mustn't wait long
to see the shit TECHNICAL ABORTION
now you only can throw them away

mystic sounds of you TV - extreme heat of your rack
no mechanic could help you - it's too complicated for all
it look like programmed bombs inside the appliances
that blown up after the guarantee is lapsed

[Eisen 6-7/88]
