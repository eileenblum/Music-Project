a day of filthy weather
a night of bloody rain
iâm addicted to my necrophiliac lust
forest morgue is my aim

the lust for crusty wounds â the lust for
rotten stench
the breath of decay â I succumb to my
gloomy delusion

an orgy of blood at the forest morgue
an orgy of dismembered dissected bodies

the choice is excellent
i wet my long knife, I wet my long dick
while I select my lovely corpse

the lust for crusty wounds â the lust for
rotten stench
the breath of decay â I succumb to my
gloomy delusion

an orgy of blood at the forest morgue
an orgy of dismembered dissected bodies
