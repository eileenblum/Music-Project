you fucking pacifist - go home and lick
anyones butt...
you assholes - you think peace will come 
over us

but they'll fuck your with the barrel of a
tank...
it's time to start war against all weak and 
false idiots

blow you away - it's showtime!

wage war - not love
fight raw - not shallow
wage war - not love
you're lost in death's shallow

hear the howling of the sirens
feel the beat of the bombs
hear the grumble of the engines...
yuo are only a piece of pulverized shit
