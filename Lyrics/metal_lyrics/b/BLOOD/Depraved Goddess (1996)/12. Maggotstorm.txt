the moon always rises
when you are on the run...
you're hungry for flesh in decay

armed with weapon
armed with spade and hoe
looking for a megalithic grave

after dine with duke humphrey
pay homage to the corpse
an opulent meal lies ahead

open the coffin
rise to the bait
the person of hereulean stature

a storm of paguy maggots
gets also very hungry
now you are their living food!

the moon always rises
when you are on the run...
you're hungry for flesh in decay
