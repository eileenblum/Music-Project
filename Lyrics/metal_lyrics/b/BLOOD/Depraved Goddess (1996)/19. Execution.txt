go out! hurry up!
now stand still and be quiet!
now time has come to pay the rent
to pay for all deeds youâve done against the 
masterplan
begin to dig and hurry up!
dig down deeper in the burnt earth
now take your clothes off! but donât stop digginâ

shoot them! shoot them! in their faces
let their brains sput all over the place
let their blood sput all over earth
which is also soaked by their excrements

bury them, bury them! i canât stand their stench
the bleeding bodies of daughters and sons
of bodies least apart by bullets
hurry up! have no regret
