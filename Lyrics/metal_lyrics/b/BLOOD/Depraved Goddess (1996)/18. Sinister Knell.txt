donât pay attention to the orders of the lesser
demons
when they force you to suicide
they are in everyone of us and itâs in your
possession
to let them out
you arenât yourself, only a might of satan!

atomic war, nuclear disease,
no tomorrow, no yesterday
donât walk towards your own grave.
donât take a look down to hell
people are born, people died
to hear the sinister knell

donât pay attention to the orders of the lesser
demons
when they force you to suicide
they are in everyone of us and itâs in your
possession
to let them out
you arenât yourself, only a might of satan!
