hail,hailâ¦the warmongers screams
in the name of thy gods
forward into battle with the alliance of the
chaos-engine
grinding their enemies into pieces
drinking their warm blood

destroy command â they ablazed the fire
destroy command â people are in desire

hail, hail victory! spill the bloodâ¦hail and 
kill â destroy command

with total power and might they ram down
the walls
of the weak castles

hail, hail victory! spill more bloodâ¦hail 
and fucking kill!
destroy command  

with total power and might they burn down
the symbols of christianity

hail,hailâ¦the warmongers screams
in the name of thy gods
forward into battle with the alliance of the
chaos-engine
grinding their enemies into pieces
drinking their warm blood
