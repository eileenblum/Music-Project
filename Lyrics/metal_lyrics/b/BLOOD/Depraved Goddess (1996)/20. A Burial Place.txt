When blackened shadows fill the streets with their
wets curses houses alive like ghosts
the graves of day inckily corpses awake
on their cheeks and lips glow the colours and signs
of life

behind their lids you see the eyes of death looking

they raise in restless rows to forget their own death
when the light died at dawn
then everything fades and burns out the glowing
of their colours
during the houses became grey
you see the shadow women hurry to their
burial placesâ¦

now once again they fall into an ancient
slumber
âtill the first sun beam enters the earth

but the houses had become grey
and you see the shadow women hurry to their
burial placesâ¦
