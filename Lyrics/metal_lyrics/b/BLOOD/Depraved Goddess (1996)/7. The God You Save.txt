if man insist on externizing his true self
in form of "god" then why fear his true self
in fearing "god"?
why praise his true self in praying god?
why remain externalized from god in order
to engage in ritual and religious ceremony in 
his name?

stop the lies! stop the madness!
end the curse of an epidemic agent

the god you save may be yourself
rip up the bible, crush the crucifix
free yourself from conscience slavery
free yourself from christianity

beware your children of the church
for nevermore shall rule on earth
who's that god - who kill our friends
who's that jesus - never help
what's that priest - above our childs
what's that book - full of invented lies
the god you save may be yourself!
beware that shit which'll be your real hell

stop the lies! stop the madness!
end the curse of an epidemic agent
