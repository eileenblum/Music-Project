I was born into a world which is build on
utopian rules and laws
written by men living in past ages
â¦and now I ask: donât you seeâ¦
â¦that these laws canât be translated to our 
time!

A man whoâll save us all  from all evil and 
disease
a man whoâll heal us all from the âseven 
deadly sinsâ
the oldest story about a superman not from 
this world
whoâll free us from all badness to change
this planet in utopia

if you still believe that â go to church!
praise a story! pray to an invention!
holy an organisation living on your money

and punish with hypocrisy and blackmail!!!
for them you are just an enslaved cripple
of psychological
dependency stired up by an infected society!

free your minds â stay on your way
fuck religions â donât sell your souls
donât fall for anyoneâs line
blessedâll be all non-believers, only have
faith in you
fuck religions! amen!
