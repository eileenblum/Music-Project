about your own dissatisfied
you fall in war with your outer world
a tremble and rage deep inside
unfold an immense meaness of nature
licentious hate cries for blood
be sparked off by your fury chairiched flesh
the seed of evil thrive inside a slitting
restlessness

frightened about your own thoughts
you never dreamt to think that kind of way
a sudden need for destruction
torments your conscience with self reproaches

deaf to outworld, dumb to the own awareness
blind for all beauty, your life seems to be
the only sin

dark conscience
that resound of emotions
plagues your brain, corroding your
mind
a crawling invincible violence
which you don't want to relief

this suffering went to extremes
into an enraged soul terror
if you can stand that fight
your conscience'll be revenged in
suicide
