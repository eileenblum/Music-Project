a group of teens spent their holidays in a camp
of tents
every day they swam, played games and had 
lots of fun
noparents who told them what to do
no father who told his rules
no school, no work - only sparetime and
freedom

it's a bloody season in the summer holidays
alone in the forest - bloody season

but then some of them were missed and found
dead
with knifes in heart and hedge - shears in the 
eyes...
the remained ones ran away, but the murderer
was on every place
one by one he caught them and finished their
lives

it's a bloody season in the summer holidays
alone in the forest - bloody season

aaaaarghh

it's a bloody season in the summer holidays
alone in the forest - bloody season
