three quarters of all europeans
associate with the cross high
religious ideas
and around that, it gives us
fun to desecrate these

blasphemy - hate god
victory - god is rot

we defy the public opinion -
that amuses us
we hit the prejudice from our
childhood - with our feet
we destroy them - that makes
us hot!

the black mass a normal person
couldn't understand,
also the sodomism and the
bestialism

Blasphemy - praise of satan, to
you in high heaven night
where one time you ruled in
hells night!

blasphemy - hate god
victory - god is rot
