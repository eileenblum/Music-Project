[Music by Beto Vazquez, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez - Manda Ophuis, Vocal Melody by HJ de Jong]

The darkness of the night
Where you hide yourself
With many mysteries
Like so much in life

Now I can see your face
It's full of misery
I realize you're in my dreams
My mystery

Mystic matters
Fill me with illusion
Are you real
Or just a delusion

The darkness of my mind
Hides a mystery
Will I wake up one day
Of this eternal dream

And will I get the chance to see you that day
And will you disappear again or will you stay

All I ask of you is stay with me don't go
Don't fly away
And promise me that you will stay!

Mystic matters
Fill me with illusion
Are you real
Or just a delusion
