[Music by Beto Vazquez, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez, Vocal melody by Victor RivarÃ³la]

I see through your empty eyes
And in the darkness of your heart
I see you whispering your cold loneliness
For Ever you stay with me
You invite me to die with you
You say we should let go
But, I can't  do it
I Don't understand
You say I'm slowly dying  in my dreams
But you say it's  great to have feelings and smile
You are an evil need in my life
And while I see the reflex of your darkmind
I Confirm  that you are in agony
You are a mystery, and I can't understand
You are a darkmind
You have a darkmind
