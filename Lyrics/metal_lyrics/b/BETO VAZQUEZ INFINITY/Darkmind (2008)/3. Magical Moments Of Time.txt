Lyrics by Beto Vazquez.
Vocal melody by Jessica Lehto

I only remember That you said good-bye
and your absence still hurts
It even feels
Fresh, humid, present...

The flavor, of your last kiss
Pure like a white rose.

With every drop of rain a memory
penetrates in my harmed soul
and already forgotten sadnesses are reborn

Every time....
Your absence
hurts me more
but even this way it hurts less than your good-bye ...
A never  pronounced good-bye
and finally I am  alone but with a bitter flavor...
In the middle of the cold
and the darkness
With a deep,pain in my soul
a soul that, crushes...

under the shade of your oblivion
that so much I hate
that still reigns in my lips...
The so sweet flavor of you
that flavor that so much I love
and today it's only  a magical  moment of time .

In the middle of the cold
and the darkness...
With a deep pain in my soul
Today is only a magical moment, of the time

The flavor of your last kiss
Pure like,a white rose...

With a deep pain in my soul
The so sweet flavor of you
Pure like a white rose
With a deep pain in my soul
The so sweet flavor of you
today it's only  a magical  moment of time.
