[Music by: Beto Vazquez - Rute Fevereiro, Lyrics by: Beto Vazquez- Elisa Luna, Vocal Melody by: Elisa Luna]

Hold me  one more time
Time runs  in   my   veins
Hold me one more time

Sorrow came to me, need to forgive
time is flowing wild in my day dream eyes
cannot take no more, living a show and I feel
the cold of my loneliness goes through me

I wanna see you soon, hold me
so I can feel alive, i can fly on your wings to paradise
I wanna touch you forever
more and give you my life my pain
back For time runs in my veins

Hoping, running
Through a flaming line
Now it's on my side
I' ll reach the light

Take a chance, not too late
with your hands wide open today

My weakness, your fire
it's my turn, it's time to go

See me I am in a world of darkness
Until you crossed my path, my fallen
Maybe I couldn't see my rose withering
but Time didn't pass in vain within your eyes

My weakness, your fire
it's my turn, it's time to go

Now it's on my side
I' ll reach the light
