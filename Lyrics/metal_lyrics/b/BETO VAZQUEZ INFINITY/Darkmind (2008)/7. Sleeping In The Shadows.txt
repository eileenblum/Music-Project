[Music by Beto Vazquez, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez]

A vision is trapped inside my crystal ball
Just close the door, don't live in the dark
Sleeping passion lies on a frozen ground
Strong feelings can be found within our hearts
Soon they'll come out again.

Everything around me makes me see life clearly now.
The other side belongs to my past.
Sleeping passion lies on a frozen ground
Strong feelings can be found within our hearts
Soon they'll come out again.

Look inside of me
In my hands you'll  find a new world
The abyss of my existence
(Wants) to make me sleeping its cold shadows.

This is my story
I sacrificed all my dreams
just to live my last hope.
Sleeping in the shadows

Creatures with dark thoughts
Living in this illusion
Try to wipe my deepest feelings
That are written in my soul and heart
Giving strength to carry on.

Beyond all the pain I suffered
memories keep me awake now
it seems to be the only choice
so as not to fall asleep once more
In the shadows (I) will get lost.
