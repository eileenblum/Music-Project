[Music by Beto Vazquez, Lucas Pereyra, Eddy Antonini, Lyrics by Jessica Lehto, Vocal melody by Jessica Lehto]

How can I go on
without knowing my way
However I hold on
this will not remain

For now I can't find myself
For now one more loss
Echoes from forgotten worlds
Into a broken box that shelters me
From your heart

Eddy Antonini : Harpsichord - Strings]
