[I]
As a spell
The strangest of the answers on your head
Are calling to me
Rise a sunny day
See the rise of (a) new day
You killed my heart in tempest
Once again

[Bis]
And the spell that meant to sanctify our love
Was the end and the beginning of the world
See the rise of (a) new day
You killed my heart in tempest
Once again

[II]
What seems to hide,
Is the promise we have made some time ago
One starry night behind the rainbow
Before my eyes, when the thunder bursts in rain
I know the Gods dance in the clouds

As a spell
The strangest of the answers on your head
See the rise of a new day
You killed my heart in tempest
Once again

And the spell that meant to sanctify our love

[III]
Take my hands
Wait for hope, that's all you've got to live for
In the world
Kingdoms fall apart, but I know that our love will live on through
The dark times
[x2]
