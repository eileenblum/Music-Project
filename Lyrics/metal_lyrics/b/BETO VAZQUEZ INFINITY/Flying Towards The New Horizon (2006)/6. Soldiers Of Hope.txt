Oh god please, IÂ´m waiting
IÂ´m waiting for your help
So far, so low is the shining
The flame of life is my hope
It's the spirit,
In the way of my soul
Forgotten feelings in times of war
Sad dawn spent with my torn soul
Soldier of hope
Fighting for the revelation
The world is victim
Of this sin
The light is bright
And it is my salvation now
The angels can look
inside my heart.
In the way,
Why donÂ´t we walk hand in hand?
Time runs fast within my heart
Forgotten feelings in times of war
Sad dawn spent with my torn soul
