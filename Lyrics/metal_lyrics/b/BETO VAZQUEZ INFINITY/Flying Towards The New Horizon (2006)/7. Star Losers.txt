Welcome Star Losers

[1]
I always set my mind to something
and I got it right
DonÂ´t care what you think
I always wanted to look foreword
and go beyond all
I could not be stopped
I always said mediocres would not
forgive me for IÂ´m
Shining in the dark
I always knew this time would come,
and so, I take the trail

[repeat 1]

But they could not fight me up,
My mind is not just as small as theirs.
They can't see the woods for looking at the tree,
Poor limited folks
They got stucked in time, and they did not move on and on
Chewing up spite,
Star losers (I) pity you, and you will always die alone.

They always tried to let me down, but they could not stop
Me before they fell off.
They always underestimated me but they gave me strength
To show them I was the best
They always tried to break my project into pieces by
Making up their lies
They know that they have done wrong, live on through memories

But they could not fight me up,
My mind is not just as small as theirs.
They can't see the woods for looking at the tree,
Poor limited folks
They got stucked in time, and they did not move on and on
Chewing up spite,
Star losers (I) pity you, and you will always die alone.

What do all the star losers want is to see me fall down
[x3]
Fuck You!

[repeat 1]
