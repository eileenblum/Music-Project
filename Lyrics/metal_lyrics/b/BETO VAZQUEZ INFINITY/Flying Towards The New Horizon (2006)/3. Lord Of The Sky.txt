Inside the mountain he keeps his devotion for
jewels and treasures of devastated towns
the clock of death ticks time with cold step

As he flies, he destroys everything around him
calm waters turn into steam
a red light in the mountain announces he is here
he is smaug
someone stole his treasure (but) smaug couldn't catch him
I
Inside his cave he hates strangers who break in
all alone, he watches all his belongings
forever...

The lord of the sky
he is the lord of the fire
the man of the lake
fear his cruelty
but an arrow makes justice
smaug falls down

Mortally wounded the beast got what he deserved
the people is set free and the story a legend will be
