I feel the wind on my face
My body shakes
No one knew I was dreaming
Again

All through my inner self
For my love you'll always be
among my days

For my love
Through my self
Among my days

I have kept a secret for a long time
Holding my deep thoughts

[2]
They blow up to the stars
(To) scream their truth
Filling me with their passion
And pain

Feelings I've tried to hide
Ever since I was a little girl but
Just can't

For my love
Through my self
Among my days

I have kept a secret for a long time
Holding my deep thoughts

[repeat 2]

Did you write down all
your dreams?
I am expressing them right now
Maybe your time shall some day cross my path and
Well wake up as one, just try

[3]
We are not like
We're intended to be.
What do they know of love
Keep me strong.

Join reality and hope
In the deepest silence of my understanding

For my love
Through my self
Among my days

I am myself

[repeat 2]

[Guitar Solo]

[repeat 1]

[Coda:]
I have kept a secret for a long time
Holding my deep thoughts

I have walked some dark times, but your brightness made me follow you.

I will stay the same and keep you by my side for you my love.
