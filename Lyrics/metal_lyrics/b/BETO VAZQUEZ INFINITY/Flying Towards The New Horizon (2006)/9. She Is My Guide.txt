[1 x2]
I am the breath
Behind your neck
Under the sky
And the oceans

[repeat 1]

Wherever you're falling
I 'll always be
By your side to give you
My soul

Where the fantasy unites with the
Dark reality
Are the dreams you wake up

[repeat 2]

Look at me red sunset
When hope is forever
Look at the horizon and
Beyond the stars

Look at me red sunset
When hope is forever
Look at the horizon and
Beyond the Sky

I am the breeze
Playing with your hair
The autumn light
In the forest

[repeat 1]

Feel my pain nevermore shall return
She is my guide and she will be forever

[repeat 2]

She is my guide.
