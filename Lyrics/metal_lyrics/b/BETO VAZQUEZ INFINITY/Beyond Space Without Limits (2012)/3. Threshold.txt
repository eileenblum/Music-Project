The night is falling and the last rays of moonlight
caressing the graves one more day.

A cold blast thrills the skin just one more step
close to the threshold of life and death
But after all itÂ´s a memory and only the wise
who know the power of time will cross it

I see a bright light in the sky
as the moon seen in all its glory
as being embraced in a perfect blend
of souls that with the same desire
are transported to the underworld.

While truly I'm standing at thresholdâs door,
looking days passing through the fields of desolation
Join me on the lonely road that leads us to the truth
donÂ´t allow me to slip on vague hopes,
Time carries your looking to here...

Far from the city of deep darkness
I faced a mortal fear fades out of the door

A cold blast thrills the skin just one more step
close to the threshold of life and death
But after all itÂ´s a memory and only the wise
who know the power of time will cross it

Echoes from the dark are killing my soul,
time is running out the clock. Time after time,
every tear in my life turn to blood on the sea taken away
with the wind

I would like to capture and stop it to be with you
walking the way of life and dreams
oh, once the threshold is crossed
