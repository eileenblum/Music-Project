Lyrics by: Beto Vazquez &amp; Santiago BÃ¼rgi.]

I saw reflected on the wall spirits of evil
spectrumÂ´s coming out of dying fire like demons.
out of me and my mind, tortured angel of life
moved by unreached desire, out of me!!Â 
Â 
Like diving in the worldÂ´s heart
lost in my madness
embraced by itÂ´s winter arms
that leads my life in dreams.
Â 
Over the dawn, where the blue crystal shines,
it shines reflecting on the darkest waters of oblivion.
rope of my heart imprisoned and undead
undead and holding like air pendulum in sorrow
Â 
My tormented spirit fights
my heart is brighter than the stars
and with vengeanceÂ I hold high
my honour and my truth
Â 
Â My mind can now escape from thoughts
oppressed by the dark ways of daily living
Our faith faints and I see it at the end of the road
My insanity protects me from that world
that harms my own kind and myself
Â 
Live and fight on my madness
Live and fight on my dreams
Â 
Spirit of light coming from the sky
take my life!!

Madness is where I spy
the world as it tries to hide
Madness, my sword and shield
you could stay out there or follow me.........!!!!!!
