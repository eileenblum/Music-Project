[Music &amp; Lyrics by Beto Vazquez
Vocal Melody by Beto Vazquez]

Stagnant waters
fill my mind
With memories
Another view
Upon a dark uncaring time
Where the morning sun
WonÂ´t rise a new

Morning sun will soon awake
shinning hope and past away

New born hope will let arise
deepest feelings flowing from my heart

Still I am trapped inside my mind
while new hope becomes my life
and turned those stagnant waters that
filled my mind into a shine new start.

Stagnant waters fill my mind...
New born hope will let arises
Still I am trapped inside my minds

turn those stagnant waters that
filled my mind into a shine new start.
