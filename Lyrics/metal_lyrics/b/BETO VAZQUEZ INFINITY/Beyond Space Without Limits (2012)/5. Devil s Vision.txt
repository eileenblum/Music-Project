Lyrics: Beto Vazquez
Vocal Melody: Ana Maria Barajas &amp; Chiara Malvestiti]

The bright lights of the candles fading slowly
With the wind of the distant night
Flowers weep bloody tears of sadness
That death generates

A breath ofÂ cold airÂ came outÂ to face meÂ 
WalkingÂ in the deep path of darkness
I canÂ see thatÂ angelsÂ are onlyÂ entitiesÂ 
In exile

I release my inner self that I was hiding
It enlightens the day
now I hear voices from a new millennium
Growing inside myself

Without a singleÂ word I hear their whispers
The silent beauties of the dark
Evil echoes of wicked nightmares
Become alive

Ombra ignobile =Â  an ignoble shadow
Siede intorno a me = is sitting around me
Arde la via = the path blazes
Sino alla follia ! = until the madness

Feed and cover the light
of the latest lamp of life
While the dawnâs turning gray
âtill the brand new day
