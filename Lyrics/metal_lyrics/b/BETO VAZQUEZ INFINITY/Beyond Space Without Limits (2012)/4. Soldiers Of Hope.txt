[Music by: Beto Vazquez
Lyrics: Beto Vazquez
Vocal Melody: Beto Vazquez]

Oh god please, IÂ´m waiting
IÂ´m waiting for your help
So far, so low is the shining

The flame of life is my hope
It's the spirit,
In the way of my soul

Forgotten feelings in times of war
Sad dawn spent with my torn soul

Soldier of hope
Fighting for the revelation
The world is victim
Of this sin

The light is bright
And it is my salvation now
The angels can look
inside my heart.

In the way,
Why donÂ´t we walk hand in hand?
Time runs fast within my heart
Forgotten feelings in times of war
Sad dawn spent with my torn soul

Oh god please, IÂ´m waiting
IÂ´m waiting for your helpâ¦
The shiningâ¦
