[Music &amp; Lyrics by Beto Vazquez
Vocal Melody by Beto Vazquez]

Again, I am willing to carry on
I wonÂ´t let fate seal my way
Although I suffer losses in my life
I must be strong, and carry on for those I love

I need to resist and control my pain
IÂ´ll have to if there is tomorrow
must think about the future that comes
When time passes by, I Â´ll be a wiser man

I wish to find someone to help me now
Sometimes I feel a great void in my life
At nights, my past comes back to my mind
Will my fate give me a chance to survive?

IÂ´m eager to start living up
The new story in this chapter of my life
I know I have many people by my side
Who wish I overcome, all my fears.

I wonÂ´t forget about my yesterday
Keeping memories from old times
That taught me feelings, and lessons
She gave me all her love
till the end of her days.
