[Music &amp; Lyrics by: Beto Vazquez]

[1 Antimatter]

[Beto Vazquez: Keyboards]

[2 Ocean Winds Part I]

[Marysol Fernandez : Flute]

[3 Constellations.]

[Jessica Lehto : Lead Vocals]

During centuries, and beyond creation
They live on the deep space
Without conflict, in brotherhood
Constellations are a good example
Of how humanity should live
Formed by fragments
Forming a pure unity

[4 Ocean Winds Part II]

[Marysol Fernandez: Flute
Lucas Silva Sapia : Violin]

[5 Into the Stars.]

[Jessica Lehto: Lead Vocals
Mariana Berenstecher: Cello
Matias Yanucci: Saxophone]

IÂ´m living my dreams on a far away place
with a lot of light I get to see
the universe shinning
Within my own star iÂ´m secure and protected
here nothing can harm me
I cud live into the stars
living my dreams, when universe is shinning

[6 Ethereal Breeze.]

[Santiago BÃ¼rgi: Lead Vocals]

Just like ethereal breeze,
I see time passing by
Gaze at the universe and I behold
What no one else could see before
As a gentle breeze time moves on my life

[7 Asteroids Rain.]

[Jason Droguett: Lead Vocals
Luis Margaritini: Additional Flute
Lucas BauzÃ¡ : Horns]

Asteroid Rain, is fury
Power sets off and brake with all its fury
Asteroid Rain is energy
No one can control nor predict its character
Not everything is peaceful and quiet
Spills its power within a far away galaxy
Asteroid Rain, its savage
and once free it will get to its end
when the space claims for it.

[9 Beyond Time.]

[Santiago BÃ¼rgi: Megaphone voice]

Beyond space and life, there`s light of life
Beyond space and time, thereÂ´s fellings
Fellings are part of my life
And through everything there
will always be hope! Time has no space, time
has no space.Beyond space without limits...

[10 The Final Chapter]

[Beto Vazquez: Spoken words]

Upon a dark time, will living free full of justice
I will by my guide,
BEYOND SPACE WHITOUT LIMITS.
