Lyrics: Beto Vazquez
Vocal Melody: Jessica Lehto]

The sounds of the sea
at sunset, in silence
seals the evening with his warm smile

And from there I can see the sun
from a tower I stare
embracing his greatness

Raise your gentle spirit
into the most distant sky

You will live forever in the hearts
of those who can contemplate
your beauty

Like caresses from water you give me another life
within your deep blue eyes there's hope
on every dawn there will be a color
as a beautiful flower in full bloom

Raise your gentle spirit
into the most distant sky

You will live forever in the hearts
of those who can contemplate
your beauty

A melody coming from the unknown
a sound that during night fade slow
inspiring the poet by your deep green water

[Beto Vazquez: Bass, keyboards, lead and rhythm guitars.
