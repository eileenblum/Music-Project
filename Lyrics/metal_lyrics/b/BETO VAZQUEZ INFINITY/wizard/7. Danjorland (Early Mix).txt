In the lands of Danjorland
Desires are magic
And the energy becomes matter

In a place where the sky shines
And the hills show their landscapes
Big towns united
To guarantee the future

Danjorland, your blue lakes
They reflect pureness
Stars, in times
Of time and space
Make your dreams come true

To be there, to look and run through your
Green hills can only be compared
With peace never achieved

Danjorland, you can exist
Inside of me or within the one who
Has good feelings
Since the barbarians will never find you
