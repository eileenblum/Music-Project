Across the valley guiding a blind man, with illusion
Will the beast appear in his dreams tonight?
Will he run under a clear moonlight chasing rainbows in the night?
Please help the man kill the beast with no sorrow or pain

Suddenly, the sun appears in the valley for him
Now the blind man can see, it seems the light blinds you
But you can't be so blue the man is now there for you
Willing to walk through the valley hand in hand with you

Sometimes I think that you should help the blind man
Sometimes I think: you two are one of a kind
Don' keep on making
Promises under the rain
Words that you are gonna regret
Sad feeling that he is loosing you forever
Please don't enter in your night right now

As the ember of the valley, you were not strong enough
Don't hide in your shell, you'll be under attack
Don't keep on making
Promises under the rain
Words that you are gonna regret
Speaking from the heart he will never lie (won't ever lie)
Make him be a wiser man, he may have something to hide
Don' keep on making
Promises under the rain
Words that you are gonna regret
Is hard to start all over, when you were so close to understanding your life.
