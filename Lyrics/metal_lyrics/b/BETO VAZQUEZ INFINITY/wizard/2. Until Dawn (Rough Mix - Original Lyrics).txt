Long nights of silence I thought of you
Of my life, my king, my land
Land of war had turn into light
Divine light that give us strength

Sunlight divine covers my land
Angels of light take care of us

I felt darkness near me
Among trees I saw the gate of hell
I hear that someone screamed my name
Son of evil scream for my life

Sunlight divine covers my land
Angels of light take care of us

Riding, riding through the wind
I feel so cold around my soul
Fighting, fighting the evil in my heart
Fear's trying to kill my mind
It's a strange sensation
Wild heart give me now the courage
To save my land. Now!!!

Please, stars, guide me in the night
Light my way to fight the dark

Please God, I pray to you one more time
Give me the courage and strength to save my land

Flying up in the sky, riding through the wind
Until dawn things won't change at all
Strange sensations, fighting the evil in my heart
Angels of light help me save my land.

Sunlight divine covers my land
Angels of light take care of us

Riding, riding through the wind
I feel so cold around my soul
Fighting, fighting the evil in my heart
Fear's trying to kill my mind
It's a strange sensation
Wild heart give me now the courage
To save my land.
Before dawn
