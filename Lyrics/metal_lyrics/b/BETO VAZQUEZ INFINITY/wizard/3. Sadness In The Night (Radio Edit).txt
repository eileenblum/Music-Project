In the night I feel the cold of my loneliness
Cold that embraces my heart
Draining my strength to fight
Only to breathe this suffering

Tell me why?
Why must I bear this cross
So heavy for my soul?
Please hold me in your love

I am the keeper of his heart
I was sent to take care of his sweetness
Never I'll forget his love
Never I'll forget the light
That shone in his eyes

Let me fly, let me be free
To stay with him beyond this life
Run across the sky
Let me see the sun again

Let me die
Give me the light
I'm waiting for death to knock on my door to release my pain
My sadness in the night

Let me die
Give me the light
I'm waiting for death to knock on my door, to release my pain
My sadness in the night, forevermore

Every day I dream of sunlight in my dark room
I want to find a reason why
Justify my reason to stay alive
Within this pain

Tell me why?
Why must I bear this cross
So heavy for my soul?
Please hold me in your love

Let me die
Give me the light
I'm waiting for death to knock on my door, to release my pain
My sadness in the night

Let me die
Give me the light
I'm waiting for death to knock on my door, to release my pain
My sadness in the night

Let me die
Give me the light
I'm waiting for death to knock on my door, to release my pain
My sadness in the night
