[Music by Beto Vazquez &amp; Lucas Pereyra, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez &amp; Jessica Lehto, Vocal Melody by Beto Vazquez]

Our land is dying
in the hands of their children,
without love, without conscience,
man beats the ground where he lays

And I do not breathe the air that gave me life, I do not feel
soft rain on my skin and all that I had touched,
now is scarred

Its heart shakes
Its blood is lava
There is no flat land, or monsters that leave
a sailor dying, only creatures unable to care
for our future, carelessly traded, born to destroy ...

And I do not breathe the air that gave me life, I do not feel
soft rain on my skin and all that I had touched,
now is scarred
from the corrosive touch of
acid rain the human race created

If you die our time is erased
your voice is the sound of the woods
your breath is life, I will fly
and can't find the ground
your eyes turn to the sunrise
and I'm lost in the depths of your being

If you die our time is erased
your voice is the sound of the woods

Our land is dying
in the hands of their children,
without love, without conscience,
man beats the ground where he lays

And I do not breathe the air that gave me life, I do not feel
soft rain on my skin and all that I had touched,
now is scarred

And all that I had touched
now is scarred
