[Music by Beto Vazquez, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez &amp; Lady Angellyca, Vocal Melody by Lady Angellyca]

Is a mixture of love and lust
Together we go round our dreams
When you think you fall on deaf ears
I will be close to you

When the dark
tries to embrace me
At the night
this silence is my destiny
In my dreams
I wish
to see your smile
In my dreams
I miss your warm and sweet embrace

Dark night
is a sigh of two hearts
I need to forget this cold
When I cÃ³ntemplate this dark night
the wind took my last tears

when the silence comes to me
my pure and beautiful dream
When the night comes to you
You keep it for me
keep it for me
keep it for me
