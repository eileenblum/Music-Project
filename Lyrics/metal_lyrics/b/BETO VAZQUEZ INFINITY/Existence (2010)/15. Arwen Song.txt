[Music by Beto Vazquez, Lyrics &amp; Vocal melody by Beto Vazquez]

This song is for my beloved daughter Arwen Nahiara Vazquez

I giveÂ­ you my hand with joy
I hold you tight and allways be with you

Walking together we don't look back
Don't be afraid, here I am to hold you

Tell me what your dreaming
Tell me while your sleeping
with you, allways smiling
love shine's in my heart

Tell me what your dreaming
Tell me while your sleeping
I'll be your guardian angel
My shinning little star

Can only see you grow up
And day by day I take you inside
the colour of your world and your smile
paint my days with your love allways

Let me see your feelings
And your fears so I can protect you.

I will be tacking care
Forever my love.

Tell me, Tell me
I'll be your guardian angel...
