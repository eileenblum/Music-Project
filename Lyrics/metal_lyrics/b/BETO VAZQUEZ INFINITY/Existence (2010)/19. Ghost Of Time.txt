[Music by Beto Vazquez &amp; Lucas Pereyra, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez &amp; Gaby Koss, Vocal Melody by Gaby Koss]

He came with storm and wind and rain
my heart beats anxiously in pain
of irremediable passion in this alone vein
How could I divine that his exciting way
would cross and unify my lonely paths so grey?

Venturously enchanting he took my heart
and in my breast I felt an aching dart,
I knew we never again would loose and part
for he's my solely love , yes my other half.

Fast the springs passion evanescent
and also by the summers spirit went..
now winter lays dark and the world looks so glum
but hark what takes away the misty fainting grim!

Two true hearts like on a trees beautiful rime
Yes my dearest love that is the ghost of time.
