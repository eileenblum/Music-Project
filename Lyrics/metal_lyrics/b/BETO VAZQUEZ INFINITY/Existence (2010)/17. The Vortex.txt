[Music by Beto Vazquez, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez, Vocal Melody by Victor Rivarola]

What you read now is the present
time passes by, and is already part of the past
it's trapped in this instant
everything that remains is our future
it exists outside our perception
only words endure, and no power on earth
can alter them
can alter them

Time is a fragment of eternity
a moment by my side
I watched as people passed me by
and saw deep into their disturbed faces
the reflection of the vortex shining in their eyes
the reflection of the vortex living in their minds.

Life isn't a race, take it slowly
when you cross the portal to the other side
you will see with different vision, time stands still
you will see with different vision, time stands still
