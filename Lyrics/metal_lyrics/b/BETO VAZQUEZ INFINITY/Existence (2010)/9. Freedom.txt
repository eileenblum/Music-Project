[Music by: Beto Vazquez / Lucas Pereyra, Lyrics by: Beto Vazquez, Vocal Melody by: Jessica Letho]

I emerge and my soul flies free like a bird
I see you shine under the surface
You are as free as a lonely star on the deep sky
Spread your wings and fly with me,
don't fear that you have a choice

Somewhere there should be an awakening of wisdom
warning us of danger games destroying on behalf of misery
No passions that will break the harmony of souls
dwelling in darkened woods, keeping all secrets

People have come very far with their pain, waiting for you
But with lower-cased intelligence and guns keeping us a target
equality remains a mathematical symbol

We will not understand
What hides in the Universe

Freedom...

I emerge and my soul flies free like a bird
Waiting for you
I see you shine under the surface
You are as free as a lonely star on the deep sky
Spread your wings and fly with me
