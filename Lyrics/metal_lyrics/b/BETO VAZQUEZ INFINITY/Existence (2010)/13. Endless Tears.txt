[Music by Beto Vazquez &amp; Carlos Ferrari, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez &amp; Jessica Lehto, Vocal Melody by Jessica Lehto]

The tears invading this world
before they settled, arriving to the sea

And the winds that haunt the winter of the frozen, deep forest
Stops its course towards the burning fire
Leaving our feelings to rest

Shivering with splendor before the future
Tell her that the whispers of the sea moist the words worth living for
Reflections on the top of life in a dark but hopeful sky
Where in the nights silence our souls will meet and soften
the endless tears

A tear and a smile
seducing a man
Her sacrifice is made of
neverending tears

Still trapped in pale desires
that touch the root of the heart
Sparkles rise in the air
diluting the heat of the flame
