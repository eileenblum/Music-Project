[Music by Beto Vazquez &amp; Patricio Molini, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez &amp; Jacob Hansen, Vocal melody by Jacob Hansen]

I see you cross the dark of night
covering yourself in the breeze of the senses
in an eternal flight where no one else
can see our reality

Sometimes the weariness defeats me and I start dreaming
but within my silence is your pain

Beyond myself
I want your desire to touch mine

I can only see reflects inside of your soul within mine.
in the breeze of the senses
silent feelings that today are just illusions
masking the truth of it xxx

If people could just enter my world, they will not survive
but behind my shadow, my innocence is found

Beyond myself
I want your desire to touch mine
beyond myself
The desire and passion thrill me

Sometimes the weariness defeats me and I start dreaming

Your absence cause me agony and your arrival splendor

Beyond myself
I want your desire to touch mine...
