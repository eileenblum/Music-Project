[Bonus Track]

The rising of the sun
Is seen by everyone
And no one can deny that it's real
And when you hear the call
Come crashing through the wall
You just can't doubt the things that you feel

So lift me up, the time has come to sing
And give up everything

Live for the king

Though we fight against the rule
The genius and the fool
Are bound to labor under the law
Before each man's a choice
Reject it or rejoice
The vision that the prophets are

So lift me up, the time has come we'll sing
And give up everything

Live for the king

Living for the king, living for the king
Living for the king, look with the king, talk to the king
Living for the king, something greater than you and I is the king
Living for the king, rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, it's rejoice
Living for the king, the time has come to sing
We're going to walk, walk with the king
Living for the king, open your eyes, open your eyes
Writings on the wall, don't you be denied
Living for the king, injected of rejoice, before it's meant a choice
