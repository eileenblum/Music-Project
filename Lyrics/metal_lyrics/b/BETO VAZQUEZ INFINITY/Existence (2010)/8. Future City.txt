[Music by Beto Vazquez, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez &amp; Slava Popova]

The city of the future
Mighty towers rise
Guarding secrets
Hidden from the stranger's eyes

The wind of desolation
Silences the pain
Burning through my soul
Again and...

Again I loose myself
In time between
The Future City streets
A vision from a dream

Visions of life are changed
By flowing history
Entwined with voices of
The city's mystery

The past and present
Here are finally apart
The City of the Future
Deep inside...

Let the rain
Wash away at last
All that pain
Hiding in the past

Come, look with me
through unveiled eyes,
hear its song
you will see
this is where
we belong
