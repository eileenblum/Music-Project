[Music by Beto Vazquez &amp; Lucas Pereyra, Lyrics by Beto Vazquez &amp; Dusk, Vocal Melody by Dusk]

And I will steal your soul and the last whisper
please let me be your destiny
at least for one night
my life, my rage,my madness
I want you (to) cry the night when I die
let me be your destiny ..

Welcome my dear to your endless dream
Take your eyes closed
Your desires will realized

The time will come..

Do you see the thin thread
between sanity and delirium
Fall with me in this embrace
For the Eternity in that mirror...

If you feel someone's watching you, this is me...
I am not an angel, not a demon, but either
I know what you think
I am your guardian and I can always see you

Welcome my dear tell me upon this star your wish
Take your eyes closed
Your desires will realized

Our souls will meet again and again..

Stay in my heart, the door is open
for you to come in and stay by my side
I waited, eagerly, for millennia,
this time to come..

And now my dear your endless dream is real
Take your eyes closed again
Iâll your guide in the dark

And now my dear your endless dream is real
Take your eyes closed again
Iâll your guide through the dark

Now you meet the thin thread
between sanity and delirium
You and me forever bound
Time won't part us with his scissors
As you meet the thin thread
between sanity and delirium
You and me forever bound..
I will watch you tracing out your destiny
fear free, I'll be there.
