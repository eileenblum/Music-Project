[Music, Lyrics &amp; Vocal Melody by Beto Vazquez]
Â 
I hate youÂ 
I need you
(I) hate how you play into my mind
Â 
You're something
And nothing
only to play withÂ 
tonight
Â 
Sometimes I live in empty darkness
Sometimes I absorb your cold, I like itÂ Â 
Â 
Tonight

I feel despair, you bleed sorrow
Destroyed, and found all over again
I feel you near, dreaming in nightmares
Â 
And the nightmare is tonight
