Your words for me are
like a waterfall in the desert
Your sorrow as well
I am consumed by
What I feel
No matter how much I give you my dear

Within seconds
Of watching you
Within hours
Of thinking of you
My heart beats faster
making me feel
intoxicated it feels so real

I die and cease to exist
Only to be given, life in your dreams
The memory of you is so strong
It erases all others
Always in my mind

I've had an awakening
Of different feelings
Watching your lithe form
From dawn to the end of my days
Oh... Watching you

But if I had to choose between
Walking over troubled water
Or feeling you are close to me
I choose the latter, to protect you
