[Music: Beto Vazquez, lyrics: Beto Vazquez, Mizuho Lin &amp; Sergio Mazul]

Death is all around you right in front of your eyes
Faith is a weakness when you let yourself blind
People are dying leaving memories behind
In times of weakness and depression - no compassion

Purify, sanctify
Wash my sins in holy fire
Witches brew, demon's eye
It's all we see,
1) In our own reality
2) Through our holy trinity
3) In our own fanatic's creed"

Rejecting everyone that's not the perfect one
Condemn my liberty, as if I was the wrong person to love
Oh preach the word of God! But stone the different in me
How could it be the right if it's not what I believe?
The chosen ones to preach the word
Taking the sheep to their side
Trying to change our minds
The golden throne handles the world,
Believers blinded for the words
Teachings of hate disguised in love, walls full of lies
How can I save my own life? How can I live my own desires?
I don't have any reasons to follow you
Master of fools

No compassion...
