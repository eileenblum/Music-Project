[Music: Leonardo Lukaszewicz, Beto Vazquez, lyrics: Beto Vazquez, Brunella Bolocco Boye]

Stop!

Magic in eternal disgrace

They want to clone you and you won't know
Criminal clonation, they play their games
Pretending to do what they don't know
A thousand failures, no correct results

Criminal minds or brilliant gamers?
Science goes on with no limits
Fear of suffering, fear of death
Loss and gain, but is it safe?

Criminal clonation, they play their games
Behind those doors: denial
But also flaws within those walls
Can perfection be reached?
How many lives lost!?

Magic in eternal disgrace

They want to clone you, you won't hear a thing
Chasing ideals, despite the cost
Machines are working, and they won't stop
Random game with no control
How many lives lost!?

Magic in eternal disgrace!
