[Music: Brunella Bolocco Boye, Beto Vazquez, lyrics: Beto Vazquez, Brunella Bolocco Boye]

We're an evolved race
Yet we're destroying the world
And like a rudderless ship
We'll be left with almost no crew
And no machine could bring us back to life

Centuries go by, cultures wither
We long for an understanding of
Evolution, origins and a reason to exist

With most memories erased
We've lost track of our wickedness
That will surely be our doom
With some memories left
We went straight into the path of ambition
Will our wandering ship find us a new place
To claim and destroy?

Let me drown in your song
Over and over again
Get back your soul
Will we ever learn?

Centuries go by, cultures wither
We long for our understanding of
Evolution, origins and a reason to exist
If we ever landed far away
History would repeat itself
'Cause humans are an omen of death
It's in our blood!

Let me drown in your song
Over and over again
Get back your soul
Could we start again?

When there's no place left to go
Our end shall come all at once
Useless mind and fist will be
No one will know when
And no one can stop it

This won't be a punishment
But the outcome of our actions
