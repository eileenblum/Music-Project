[Music: Beto Vazquez, lyrics: Beto Vazquez]

Breaking the silence
No return from exile
Breathing in the horror
Here they come again as a massive threat
(No respect for life)

Breaking the silence
I've found the right answer
I had to lift my strength to see a painful certainty
That would allow my life to go on beyond the past

Whole generations rebuilding and letting paths towards peace
In the memories of survivors and witnesses of war
Fading shadows of a dark past
The darkest past

(No respect for life)

Breaking the silence
No return from exile
Breathing in the horror
Here they come again as a massive threat

Breathing in the horror
Beyond the past
The darkest past
