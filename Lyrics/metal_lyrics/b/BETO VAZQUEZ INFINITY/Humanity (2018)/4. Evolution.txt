[Music: Gabriels, Beto Vazquez, lyrics: Beto Vazquez, Brunella Bolocco Boye]

Life is evolution
Adaptation, changes and transformation
Mutant generations survive over millennia

Natural life is to survive
Yesterday is to be changed

Now it is time, winds of change blow from the sky
Which being prevails killing the prior one?
Mutant transformations, evolution comes
As the strongest of storms

Some cells always survive
Forging bonds with eternity
We shall give into the hands of death
Towards the next step: evolution

Now it is time, winds of change blow from the sky
Which being prevails killing the prior one?
Mutant transformations, evolution comes
As the strongest of storms
