[Music: Beto Vazquez, lyrics: Beto Vazquez]

I'm on a living hell, battalion 43
A young man fighting across over the sea
With my boots I stumble a half buried man
His mouth full of snow, death and rot

War! All is war! All is war!
Rise at dawn
War! All is war! All is war!
Man at war
War! All is war! All is war!
Rise at dawn
War! All is war! All is war!
Man at war

All I have was left behind, even a small radio
If a man is going to die, it barely matters
From where it was, ground shakes
Blood everywhere, is it mine or someone else's?

War! All is war! All is war!
Rise at dawn
War! All is war! All is war!
Man at war
War! All is war! All is war!
Rise at dawn
War! All is war! All is war!
Man at war
Is my life my destiny,
She is so far away from me
There's always confusion
Is war destruction
Falling down with closed eyes
No more stars fall from the sky
Black smoke arising

Is the same
Old
Story!

War!
