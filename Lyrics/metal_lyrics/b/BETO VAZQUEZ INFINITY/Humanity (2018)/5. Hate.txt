[Music: Beto Vazquez, Lyrics: Dmitrii Prihodko, Beto Vazquez]

Fucked up, fucked up, swarming mass of dirty people
Kept down on our knees by the pigs of the system
Knowing no limits to their hunger and ambition

But without justice there is no peace

Condemned! Must be! The system that looks away from its people
To feed the poor? No! You better buy a new political campaign.
While selling peace, you fund more wars!
No bloodshed is bad, if you can win more gold
It makes me reek! To think of you!

Fucked up, fucked up, swarming mass of dirty people
Kept down on our knees by the pigs of the system
Knowing no limits to their hunger and ambition

Second to, none, you're staple of human filth
Consume, my soul, while you're at it.
Someday, you'll find, yourself trapped inside a cage
To be laughed and pointed at, you worthless greedy sob.

But without justice there is no peace

While selling peace, you fund more wars
No bloodshed is bad, if you can win more gold
To think of you! It makes me reek!

Human scum!
