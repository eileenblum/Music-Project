[Music: Beto Vazquez, lyrics: Beto Vazquez, Brunella Bolocco Boye]

The first sight when I looked out the window
The scattered remains of the horrors lived
The night before, all that pain!

Desolation, shadows and deafening silence
Everything is gone without a trace
Embrace the pain, all that pain!
No other choice but to embrace the pain!

Will this be the last sunrise I see?
Prayers corroded, this life smiles no longer

Why?!
My epitaph chained to an evil war
Should I embrace the pain?
Should Iâ¦ All that pain?

Your dull eyes staring into the void
Heavy breathing as you lay
And people just passing by
How many? No one will seeâ¦

Why?!
My epitaph chained to an evil war
Should I embrace the pain?
Should I embrace the pain?
