[Music: Daiana Benitez, Beto Vazquez, lyrics: Beto Vazquez, Giulia Penzo]

It's worthwhile to look at our past
And see the relations between power and human beings

Our natural history is full of debts and wrong decisions
Anxiety and greed are equal to fate
Someone else took my life away
Before the sunset I will be in heaven
Far away from sadness and sorrow
Away from uncertainty and pain

But also away from my beloved
But also away from my beloved

I shall meet (you), my love, someday
And kiss him, hold him and feel him again
His warmth protects me and his eyes
Light the path to a new beginning

I haven't heard of you for a long time
Fate decided I'd receive this letter
Those words can't be spoken
Your final destination was there

Time has come to see you again
Hold you tight and be together one night
I'm going to your arms, my love.
And we shall never be apart again.

Time has come to see you
I'm going to your arms, my love...
We shall never be apart again.
