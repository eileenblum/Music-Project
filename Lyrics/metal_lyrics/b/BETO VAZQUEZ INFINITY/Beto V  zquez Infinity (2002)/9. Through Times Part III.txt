[Lyrics: Max Ditamo - Music: Beto Vazquez, Roberto Zabala, Danilo Moschen]

Holy world hidden in pain,
Pain that flies through the air
Glance of sadness you could perceive
Gazes that strengthen your heart

Shinning sun light the town
The evil hides in the dark
Children looking for in the sky
Quietness and peace for their lives

Winds of love caress their faces
Angels hold their hearts
Smiling faces feeling the light
Pure and innocent hearts
Shine in the dark
