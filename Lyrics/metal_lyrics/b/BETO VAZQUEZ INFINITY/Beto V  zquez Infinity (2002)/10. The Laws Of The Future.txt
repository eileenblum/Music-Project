In a distant place called Zlord,
All the villagers were waiting for it
With tears of anguish in their eyes

All the time they pray to God
Winds of freedom blow in our lives
To set us free from this agony

Please, don't allow that fate to forge your life
You forge your own destiny
Let your feelings be free, your heart is your guide
Be so strong and get ready, for tomorrow
Don't fear the future that comes

Between wars and firestorms
Rain of arrows and screams of desperation
They live with hope that fills their hearts

The new king proclaimed peace for all
Under new laws sent from eternal heaven
With happiness and joy for all

Please, don't allow that fate to forge your life
You forge your own destiny
Let your feelings be free, your heart is your guide
Be so strong and get ready, for tomorrow
Carry on, the future is now!

All this turned people back into slaves facing new laws
Storm of the past

All this turned people back into slaves facing new laws
The laws of the future
