[Lyrics: Max Ditamo, Beto Vazquez - Music: Beto Vazquez]

Demons and wizards
Waiting for me at the Valmourt's woods
Magical keepers
They take care of the divine sword

Sword of freedom
I call you to save my land
To fight darkness
To scream free forevermore

Legendary warrior ride
Freedom is within you
Royal wisdom
You're the keeper of your land

Ride through the forest
I can hear people scream
Cries of anguish
Give me courage to fight

Winds of wisdom
I'm calling you from my soul
To fight darkness
To scream free forevermore

God, give me light to survive
Please don't let me down

Legendary warrior ride
Freedom is within you
Royal wisdom
You're the keeper of your land

Winds of glory blowing the land
Soldier of sunrise
Keeper of the light

After the war I'm alive
The war finishes
So scream to be free now

Legendary warrior ride
Freedom is within you
Royal wisdom
You're the keeper of your land

Legendary warrior ride
Freedom is within you
Royal wisdom
You're the keeper of your land
