King of kings you may decide
Right upon our lives
And we'll do as you command
Even risking our hearts

And we'll do as you command
Fighting with our hands
When the enemy walks in your land
We'll go and fight them back
And we'll do as you command
Fighting with our hands
When the enemy is strong and fast
We'll go and fight them back

[The Queen:]
"Your Majesty, the enemy is here.
The best is being done, but they're stronger and faster than we are,
And they are arriving in vast numbers.
We cannot tell for how long we'll be able to stand this vicious fight".

[The King:]
"Go, my golden Queen, the light is within you and your men.
You'll never be defeated if you fight with might and hope".

And we will do as you command
Fighting with our hands
When the enemy walks in your land
We'll go and fight them back
And we will do as you command
Fighting with our hands
When the enemy is strong and fast
We'll go and fight them back

[The Queen:]
"The king was right. We fought with hope and might.
And faced the enemy with open hearts.
None of my men were down in the fight.
God bless the king, for being our guide".

King of kings you may decide
Right upon our lives
And we'll do as you command
Even risking our hearts
