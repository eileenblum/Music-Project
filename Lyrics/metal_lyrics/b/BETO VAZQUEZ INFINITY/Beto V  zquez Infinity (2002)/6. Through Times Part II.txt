[Lyrics: Max Ditamo - Music: Beto Vazquez]

Winter numbs my mind
Winds of sorrow pass
Right in front of my eyes
I can feel the coldness of time

All alone I walk
By this horrid sight
When will I free myself
From this burden, slaving my mind?

Understand this cruel life at last
Why I'm not among the stars
In a moment of lust, when the key was in love
I decided to play every part
If I were able to go back in time
I'd surely find my home there
