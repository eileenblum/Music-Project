[I]

Abandon hope
all (ye) who enter meâ¦
Let the part
of this noble body will be
a lid of your sudden sarcophagi
He would applaud
If he had the hands
And he would waltz
If he had the limbs
But he only grins
Â«You are as unwholesome as meÂ»

Thus the mactation
Convoked them â
Doughy, bleating, dying

[II]

Another light
anon shall rise
For uninhumed vain
and malign eyes
Those who run to the dawn
Will fall into the nightâs embrace
No one will leave this putrid pageant
(To a) lupanar fane
Profound is over and under me
It does go on hopelessly forever

Â«Do not plunge me back into wan nothingness!
Do not plunge me back intoâ¦ Â»

[III]

Ripped down is the
chthonian sky
With the cold blade of a
Ritual knife
Ghost paradeâs bringing me
Through the onyx arcades
To the jaw of hell
There is no place
on earth for you too,
and no grave that
will comfort you
for you've met the one who
did fill your heart
with stygian ardour

Â«Voco te o Magna Mater,
Ne me mori faciasÂ»
Dressed in piceous
youâll return
to the orb where you must burn
