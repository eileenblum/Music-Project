[I]

I am a sapless sapling,
Iâm a dead body faking life
Being alone in the species
I lap the bane that timeâs offering me

Once youâve learnt to fly, but now
come learn to crawl in the mud

You long for caresses,
Blow the candles out,
Confide your secrets to the night,
Sins arenât enough to die
He showed me the truth:
Fathers enjoy drinking wine of
Vices, and their children burn in hellâ¦
Sigh.

[II]

Oh how easy itâs to
Lead astray a sheep
Without a shepherd
See it is me, your long lost child
Hooking you with arms open wide

[III]

Iâll be Nemesis for you -
Purple like the war, candescent, hungry
As my blood trills and then
Pours out in a flood
I do love you all more than ever

Bless them
All
Curse them
Slake them
They are
Nothing but sparks

I feel sick and tired of this so-called redemption
I lift up my eyes to the bright shining dome,
And angels are there looking downward to greet me;
My moribund heart, it was their only home

â¦For the light of this world has defiled us.
Weâre all under damnation,
Our name is Legion and we are many
Among the coldest stars
