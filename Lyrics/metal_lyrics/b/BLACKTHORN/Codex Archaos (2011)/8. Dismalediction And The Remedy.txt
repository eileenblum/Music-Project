[I]

No more blood, nor claws, nor fangs
Just an otherworldly touch
You will feel no pain, nor fear
but persistent yearning
for nonbeing

The persistent thirst for nonbeingâs
Hidden well inside one's mind
It cannot be satisfied and
Keeps haunting mankind...

[II]

I
tried so fiercely
to dissent but stone-cold hands
covered my mouth,
strangled my neck
at objection attempts

Touch me
Cursed and blissful

[III]

Dare to follow me and
I will follow you forever
A thousand doors will open where
there were only blank walls
before

Remedies, orations, teardrops â
Torn nets for the almost gone
Though I drained the chalice of life
They still fill it on and on

[IV]

How
Could I not notice
Void and your eyes look the same?
Iâm sick and fed up
with being deceived
Iâm quitting now this game

Rivers,
Chasm rivers
Flowing down, down
Carry me away,
Make my heart bleak,
Calm and free
