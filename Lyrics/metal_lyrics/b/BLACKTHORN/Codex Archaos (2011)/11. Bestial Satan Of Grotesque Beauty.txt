[I]

In the dream I have seen
Fire ran through my veins
And raged neath the skin

I do feel it for real
In my mind still sounds a
Voice dictating his will

And I, unsophisticated
Enraptured atomy,
Concede that what I desire
In the end can shatter me

There are things that must befall and there are
Truths that must stay in a memory
Shrouds of lies are falling one by one and
There is more than I could ever foresee

[II]

I know theyâll come for me
To find any evidence of devilry
With the ropes Iâll be bound â
Pale and startled, -
By the crowd closed around

Under fell tortures and pressure
I wonât weep nor scream aloud
Tempered in the fiery visions,
I am and will be unbowed

In the world that deeply sunk in darkness
Where their lore seems nothing but a sham,
There are hearts that doomed to blaze forever
And no waters ever will douse them

Beyond the light immured will be -
My flesh but not my soul-
Where a shade and solitude reign
At last Iâll let my tears flow

[III]

ââNow you know they always shall deplore
What you have and they canât withdrawââ

The spark youâve infused into me once
Is now a tremendous flame

[IV]

Are you sure you need my name
To lay manifestly on me all the blame
I confess to you my sin
Of rebellion against the world and its scheme

A tiny crack in the perfect
Surface of creed am I
Later Iâll cause total tumble
And igneous streams from the sky

But confession doesnât mean repentance
There will be more rebels after me
And one day theyâll break the fulsome mirror
and its pieces will set the enslaved free

You could walk with me hand in hand
Leaving behind all restraint
But most of you fear to move on
And prefer to stay enchained

[V]

Now you, just you, the one without fear
I want to confide in your ear:

The spark heâs infused into me once
Is now a tremendous flame

In this fire Iâll burn until the day
The wind takes my ash away

On this fire Iâll burn until the day
The wind takes my ash away
