[I]

Suddenly
One sultry night,
The moon burst
into fragments
broken by unrelenting
sharp-clawed hand
from nowhereâ¦
Afterwards the swollen
Stars eroded
Making red thick streams
Flow down from the welkin
It's all
going to be engored once moreâ¦

[Chorus:]
Vehemence came as anodyne
âTween pulsating earth and sky
Â«From now on you have my word
You will never be aloneÂ»

[II]

They woke up
In their own beds -
Women, men, old and youngâ¦
Without tongues
And without eyes
Spurred by one
desire
To find help
They ran out
Into the streets
Panic spread so quickly
They clung to each other
In fear, reaching
The bones and
Shrieking hearts

â¦ Oh, vielleicht
kennst du mein
Gesicht nicht
Mein eigen fleisch
Und blut aber du kennst mein
Name, mein name ist Tod

Ich habe euch bey der hand genomen
Ir must an meynen reyen komen

[Chorus:]
Vehemence came as anodyne
âTween pulsating earth and sky
Â«From now on you have my word
You will never be alone.
This is me,
Who set free
Demons of infinite chaos
And with me
you will flee
into the streams
of impending stormÂ»

[III]

Suddenly
One sultry night,
The moon burst
into fragments
Like a blade
Of guillotine
Something fell
Upon the
Sleeping earth
I am the one who
Touched her delusive hand
Heard her still voice and got lost in
Mother Archaosâ eyes

[Chorus:]
Vehemence came as anodyne
âTween pulsating earth and sky
Â«From now on you have my word
You will never be alone.
Be without
Any doubt
The sands now
Are running out
And with me
you will flee
into the forevernessÂ»
