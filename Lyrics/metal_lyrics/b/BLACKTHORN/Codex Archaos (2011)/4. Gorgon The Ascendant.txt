[I]

Cassiopeiaâs rising from her throne
(Pride, hallowed be thy name!)
Aries is ready to bleed at the steps
Of Triangulum âs altar
Time has come, now take a deep breath
Creature of God, welcome down
Those words that sleep under the antique dust
Will be sounded again

[Chorus:]
Draw from her right vein and
Unite with the morbid symphony
Oh Snake genetrix, oh Serpent Rectrix

[II]

Share with me the immortal breath,
Drink this cup at one draught
Behold, now all the eternityâs
just a fleeting moment for me
Midst the thousand-voiced choirs of chasm
There is a new fell voice
which you are slowly
recognizing as
your ownâ¦.

I always wanted to look into these petrifying eyes with vertical pupils,
To feel how the waves of deadly orgasm hug my limbs
Gorgonize, gorgonize me, my fissilingual angel!

[Chorus:]
Â«Come unto me, the untruthful from the ancient damp cityÂ»
Oh Snake genetrix, oh serpent rectrix
Â«Beneath the celestial reel
By your own mouths will I drink youÂ»
From Algolâs shade
Her Majesty is watching me
