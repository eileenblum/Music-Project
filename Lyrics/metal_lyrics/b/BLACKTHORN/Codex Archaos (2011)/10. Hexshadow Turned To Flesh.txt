Hung be the sky
With black
Yield day to night

May the
Presage
Come alive
With pure rage

[I]

Out of the grim nothingness,
Out of the dismal woods and noxious mists
Into an assemblage of warmth,
Into your house, your room, your wrists

[Chorus]
Know, however many doors you
Lock Iâll batter down them all
And whatever forces you summon
They canât save your soul

[II]

Oftentimes it seems to you
Something silently lurks there beyond the light
Well, itâs me â I had been forced
To hide myselfâ¦ until this night

Separating from the airâs
cold materiality,
I become a part of your world and
make you a part of my reality

[Chorus:]
Know, however many candles you light
Iâll blow out them all
And whatever forces you summon
They canât save your soul

[III]

In flesh Iâm standing next to you
- a termination of the faith , an end of the creed
This dark shall bring you what you need
Hexifaction guaranteed

When concentration of the fear
Gets overwhelming youâll make a desperate dart
For windows, doors
To save yourself
Itâs all in vain -
You wonât get out

Alive

Â«Before chasing a witch
Check your place in the food chainÂ»

As light ruthlessly grows dim
my eyes start to glow bright green
In your rueful life this will be
the last source of light you see
