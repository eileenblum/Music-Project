The sad, saturnine bride
And a starless, hollow night
This sardonic smile of the moon
like a gibe for my ruth

Look at me, what do you see?
There's no religion for me
I don't belong nor to this 
World, nor the afterlife

Within his nightpiece I finally found rest
My immortal Master is all I request
God, grant me death tÐ¾ appreciate my life
and grant me repentance to taste delight

Be careful, don't break my thin
Stone-cold, porcelain skin
See the abyss in my eyes
like a sleep of paradise

Leave your weary shell
You don't knowâ¦ So go to hell!
Love displaces everything,
Redeems any sin

â¦ O, this way will be starrified
Sable steeds, argent lightâ¦ 

Within his nightpiece I finally found rest
My immortal Master is all I request
God, grant me death tÐ¾ appreciate my life
and grant me repentance to taste delight
