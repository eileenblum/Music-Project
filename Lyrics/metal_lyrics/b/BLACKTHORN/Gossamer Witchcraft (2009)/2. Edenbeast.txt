Martyr, martyr with a lambent halo,
Are there shadows in heaven's garden?
The most deviant,
Perfect creation
Of our thoughts
In the Universe

The tauricornous behind the headboard
Whispers bloodcurdling stories
My beast friend,
Scratch me to bleed
Dig out (me)
An' drag me out

Beast within, come out and show your true aspect,
Edenbeast

The apple-tree was purified,
The snake was expelled, but you are still here
Hang me from branches,
Between these atrous leaves
This is the best 
Deodate for your shrine!

An angel with a flaming sword exiles them
And we go to the dusky side
Our yearning eyes 
Penetrate the night
