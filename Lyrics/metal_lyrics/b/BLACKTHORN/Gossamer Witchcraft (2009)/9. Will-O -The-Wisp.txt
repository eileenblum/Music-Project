Crystal strings of a stream
Flow under the moon's smile
Forward an' heavenward, 
Far away

Will-o'-the-wisp knows its way,
It levitates through sleepy, pacificatory pall
And she weeps bitter tears at a crucifix on a wall

For she does not know 
It won't evanesce
In this aerial last quest

Try to overcome your pain, 
You know, my God comes through my deepest wounds
My path is unknown but no matter where I go, I'll be with you

Crystal strings of a stream
Flow under the moon's smile
Forward and heavenward, 
We'll meet one day 
Your eyes are gazing upon mine,
When you are out of sight
My fingertips are touching the line;
Separating night
My time has come!
Your wetless mouth keeps on begging for more, 
But my heart's left this clammy place
And can return no more
