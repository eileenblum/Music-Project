The cold voice of the tempest, 
It makes me run away 
There's something bittersweet 
And true in the air this day 
At long last I can whirl round 
With fallen xanthic leaves 
Unite with birds of passage and fly above the trees 

(The) stories that must flash out 
With a pulsing aorta of (the) sky 
And then must turn to ashes 
I kiss them all goodbye 
The rotten lips taste divine, 
Can't explain to you why 
The last pain pierces my heart 
I laugh and deeply cry 

And stunning is the black-eyed thicket 
And the swamped grass, 
Not a human, not a god yet, 
Come, veni foras! 
And stunning is the black-eyed thicket 
And the swamped grass, 
Not a human, not a god,  
Mother, veni forasâ¦
