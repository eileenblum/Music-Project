Dressed in a sable shroud
She walks with her head bowed 
Humble, quiet yet horrifying
Night on the funereal way
Wherever she appears 
and wherever she reveals
herself there fade sources
of light, of hope, of life on earth

Flame, my stigmas, 
so everyone can see
One cut across the three moons
All will bleed with me
Too deep to heal
for eternity
Stabbed by you
and so Iâll always be
Beneath the weight of a senseless vow 
Bleeding milliads
with you I go down

And from that accursed sphere
She comes down and draws near
to flood into my inner maim
As unstoppable black flows
Thereâs nowhere I can hide
They still will pervade my mind
Creatures or phantoms, leave
Me be or emerge from the dark

Flame, my stigmas, 
so everyone can see
One cut across the three moons
All will bleed with me
Too deep to heal
for eternity
Stabbed by you
and so Iâll always be
Beneath the weight of a senseless vow 
Bleeding milliads
with you I go down
