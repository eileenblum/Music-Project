Sisters,
The fateful
Moment is
Truly  imminent
We'll open gates of timeless fear
Forked tongues of our fires grow  
And lick a sky undone â
Preluding the evenfall when weâll drag down  and lacerate  
the great abhorrerâ¦ Sun

See the smoke draw specters
And warm streams of blood mesmerize demons
Three moons fasten on you their all-seeing eye
You are irrevocably ours to live or to die

We have 
witnessed
an exile of
Chaos from earth
And weâll see its triumphal return

Scattering corpse powder over these
waters we unleash the tempest
Tear dimensions, find them,  
bring their hearts to the Mother Snake's altar

In this great hour of the night
I summon thee
Darkest overwhelming force
Come obey our will
With the wind I send a spell
Profaning these shores
Oh, rise from your slumber
Give heed to our word!

And shaking ground beneath their feet  
Has frozen and hold its breath
Together with the immolated whose   
ever whispering lips will never be sealed with a kiss of death
Soon a burning offing will be the only touch of light
And everything else swallowed by the night

See the smoke draw specters
And warm streams of blood mesmerize demons
Three moons fasten on you their all-seeing eye
You are irrevocably ours to live or to die
