And now I can't trace any moons
In the sky keeping a vow
Of silence evermore 
No the new, or the full, or even the half one
You left me! You left me?
How could you be so fell?!
Alas, numbing dread seized me
It's obviously that now I'm lone in the misery
There's only a black pole that filled with orphaned stars
Their shatters hurt so deep 
Abruptly their voices invaded my frail mind
Then unseen and grim, the
Arms dragged me to the night
Fen fires or spirits,
Guide me now where they dwell
The only place to cease
This absolute hell 

Burning, melting
Just like candles
Images of pale angels
Waxen tears 
Cascading down 
Their disfigured faces
Wreathing, growing
Thick as fog
Taking many grotesque shapes,
Smoke engulfs the
Deathbed kingly
With its fatal embrace

Across these ancient whispering halls
An incarnadine path lies
It'll lead me from this world
To the great archaos, thereat my tired heart
Will desperately outflame
Nemo ante mortem beatus

Burning, melting
Just like candles
Images of pale angels
Waxen tears 
Cascading down 
Their disfigured faces
Wreathing, growing
Thick as fog
Taking many grotesque shapes,
Smoke engulfs the
Deathbed kingly
With its fatal embrace

Eram quod es, 
Eris quod sum 
Consummatum est!
Oh coldly fulgent luminaries
I summon your deadly fire into me
This is my body which I sacrifice for you

There is only one way out:
Come unlock the blazing door
It waits for you behind like
A flame waits for a moth
Let it burn down
Let it all burn
Scattering the gloom with the light
Now I can see
Everything that
Has been out of my sight
