Out from her lair we stepped into the light

Deep forest was in our sight
Glades seemed avulsed wounds on the firmament
With bone-like branches a quiet moon was pent

"Take heed, for no one's able to dissolve
the slumberous mists these lands evolve
However, I have powers to define
a shape of the fiercest sister of mine"

"Don't trust silence of the forest

Don't yield to softness of this grass
Save yourself while you can"

Ominous fog rose from marshes and crowned
Tops of ash trees that towered around
Down at their roots lurked countless ghostly maids
In semblance of insentient pale shades

And there I met her glorious and decayed
Her clawed hands around my throat were laid
Vehemence sparked in her electrum eyes
Then she soared up with me into the skies

We'll fly through the fog
Reviving an ancient rite
Higher and higher 
Till this world is out of sight
The witch spread her wings to the moon
In the triumph of might unsung 
And she soared in a supreme swoon
Till her limbs with the light were one
"Don't trust silence of the forest
Don't yield to softness of this grass
Saveâ¦ but it is too late"

"I want to be inside of youâ¦
To feel what it's like to lose purity
and forfeit sanity
Fear us not because we lead you to the edge
and push you off it, but because 

We're the depth swallowing you up without a trace..."

Not only my flesh but my soul was numb
with dread too strong to overcome
"However beautiful this thrilling flight, 

Your fall will soon epilogize the night"

We'll fly through the fog
Reviving an ancient rite
Higher and higher 
Till this world is out of sight

But no salvation brought that dire fall
Since something caught me for new thrall

"And as a fragile grave rose lay your head
On my breast â coldest than a marble bed"

We'll fly through the fog
Reviving an ancient rite
Higher and higher 
Till this world is out of sight
Drown yourself in the obscure deep
Let another story cross your sleep
