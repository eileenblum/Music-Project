Longing to see what no human ever longed to see
Is dementingâ¦
But your eyes are seized by mortal blindness
I hear your cry  
Through the noise of mankind
The truth which you thirst for
Canât  be conceived by your mind  

When  you are all alone at night
Light a black candle, stand on the
threshold and say the rhyme
The sublunary scenes fade
away into the dark
Urging you to choose a strange gateway  
to the gloomiest of all impossible worlds
I know you
Will find the way
And appear â  
scared and forlorn â
In my realm
That has no bounds
In the world
That has no form

Ecce, Spiritum Humanum!
Stretch out your hand, enter the veil, the quest is over
Arrows of light may bring death
but they will never reach us
Deny instincts
Escape from their confines
Trust nothing but my voice
and follow the burning signs

When  you are all alone at night
Light a black candle, stand on the
threshold and say the rhyme
The sublunary scenes fade
away into the dark
Urging you to choose a strange gateway  
to the gloomiest of all worlds
Now you haveâ¦
â¦Now you have seen
The face ofâ¦
â¦real face of mine
And whereforeâ¦
â¦And wherefore your
Soul must beâ¦
â¦Must be enshrined
