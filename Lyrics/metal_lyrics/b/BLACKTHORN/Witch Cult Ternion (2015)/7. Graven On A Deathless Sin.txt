Fleeing from the place that once was called home
Desperately I raise my head to the dome
Of the sky fouled with lurid moonlight

A lunar disk glints for an instant white
Down the dark dell they canât foresee
The secrete forest stands waiting for me
Sylvatic shades invoke me again
Enthralled by a promise of impending rain

Foliage shelters me
And finally I cloister myself in the twilight cathedral 
On this ground I wrote your name so many times
That I forgot my own
Come to me, come to me, come to me
You are the gate, I am the key

Beware of him who entered your heart
For he envenomed your soul, inebriated your mind
He is the enemy and must be
Exiled

I enter an unseen circle once more
Ð¡raving to feel you like never before
Swayed by a soft and soundless breeze
Whispering herbs evoke impious memories
And when rain drops conflow with my tears
In front of me a black vision appears
Darkness casts her veil over usâ¦. 

Invade my flesh and dwell in me
Every touch is a wound I long for
The weeping firmament pours its waters into 
Our ever thirsting mouths
And we sink in the darkness
In the blazing sea where you drain my inhale dry
Although deliriously I try to hold you close 
You evanesce and through my fingers slip
Then take my heart - I rip it now for you - a bleeding rose
But still locked is a garden of eternal sleep
