Lost in the haze of infinity
Far from where once before I succumbed
To praise his name in the radiancy of the crimson pyres
Destroyed is
The corporeal frame
Washed away
Is my dust with the rain
And yet I
Shall walk the earth again
For I am agonizing but can't die

Abide a thousand lives â 
You'll slaughtered be again
Forsake the blind belief and then
broken will be this chain

And eternal silence sings to sleep
Effaces odium and vehemence
While unweaving my doomed 
consciousness slowly thread by thread, so
I embrace
the grief with dead passion
Saving it 
is my last obsession 
Yes I want
These wounds to be resurrected
with splinters of oblivion
Turn now to him
Behold his true face
Do not withdraw the eyes 
and he won't hold your gaze

Abide a thousand lives â 
You'll slaughtered be again
Forsake the blind belief and then
broken will be this chain

Lost in the haze of infinity
Where obscureness alone was my guide 
My optophobic dreams now have come
To the very end, thus 
Nevermore
will my blood fill his fount
What was lost
Will not ever be found
I perceive
He does not have power
And therefore
he cannot abolish me

While entrusting yourself to the whispering abyss
You'll depart from the world of dying shades
Turn now to him
Behold his true face
Do not withdraw the eyes 
and he won't hold your gaze

"And when barely discernible vestiges of his spirit faded away, I winced, and when I winced, I found myself dreaming within another dream and desperation moved onto me as if I've penetrated into the heart of darkness".
