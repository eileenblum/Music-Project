As I glide with Them
Through visions and spacesâ¦
Wake from your sleep at once
Arise from the semi dead!
â¦It becomes so hard 
To find my old tracesâ¦
â¦Down there you're in danger
Inhale and open your eyes!

Those who know do not speak
Those who speak do not know
Don't hide your scorn
Glory to the lone 

Don't conceal your scorn
Glory to the mass
Shame to the lone

You can transform 
Into a storm
And tear the world down
You can transshape
You can escape
Just leave behind 
Their morbid mind

Beware! Defences fall in the blink of an eye
There is a chink in your armor, my instinct cannot lie 

Execrate my name
Strip me to the skinâ¦
Speak and you will be heard
Still left without answers at allâ¦
â¦Cast a stone at me
To engrave this sin
â¦For theirs are the symbols
And always yours are the words

Those who know do not speak
Those who speak do not know
Here is your home
The place where you belong 

May this dark be my home
'Til I find the place 
Where I belong

"The human being shall be separated from the vale of tears, 
Sublime yet sequacious
â¦To walk the shining worlds that levitate above the black surface of times
May that epiphany dispel all the ephemeral things"

You can transform 
Into a storm
And tear the world down
You can transshape
You can escape
Just leave behind 
Their morbid mind

So long I have been
Waiting here within
The circle of chalk 
Now let this plague stalk
It is time for me
To break myself free
Nothing left to say
Get out of my way

Don't stand in my way
