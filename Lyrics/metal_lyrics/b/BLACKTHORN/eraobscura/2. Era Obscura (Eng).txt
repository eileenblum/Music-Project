Dea atra
Redivivus
Dea atra
Gloriosa

Abyss I call
You open the portals
In the great vastness of the night
Let
your obedient
servant enter
the shrine and join them
in a timeless rite

[Chorus:]
You're an elder divinity,
the pristine darkness
guiding nightmares and howling ghosts
A grim Muse of a Black Mass
You are a thousand-faced mother
Of all gloom
Look with great favor from above
On our hecatomb

Dea atra
Redivivus
Dea atra
Furiosa

My frantic heart
Violently beats
Biting into the sharp bars of the chest
All
The wounds
Iâve ever had are
Green once more at her ruthless behest

For this throne
you paid with many
guiltless preys
Their dead eyes watch you -
but you can hold the gaze
The frail voices curse but
even cannot sore
Disperse remains of these lost souls
Forevermore

I am entranced
by my own death
My spirit broke all the possible chains
Iâm
her child
blessed with the cold
demonic blood that now runs through my veins

[Chorus:]
You're an elder divinity,
the pristine darkness
guiding nightmares and howling ghosts
A grim Muse of a Black Mass
You are a thousand-faced mother
Of all gloom
Look with great favor from above
On our hecatomb

For this throne
you paid with many
guiltless preys
Their dead eyes watch you -
but you can hold the gaze
The frail voices curse but
even cannot sore
Disperse remains of these lost souls
Forevermore

With your incandescent light
Show us the way
to the new dimensions that weâll seize and slay
Soon your might will ruin the walls
between the worlds
and give free rein to overwhelming stygian hordes
