[Music - Vargas, Jung, Estrugo; Lyrics - Estrugo]

Living my life in fear
Feeling my dreams of suffering
Napalm attack is here
No one will see us dying

Omen of the endless decay
Begins the survival hunting
I'll spill innocent blood
Driven between two forces

You will become
A man who would kill
You will condemn yourself
Dying under the spell

Escaping from the enemy
Retreat has been denied
Have mercy with my soul
Before taking my body

Evil is all around us
Inviting these dark forces
Nothing will stop them
They will crush us every one

You will become
A man who would die
You will unleash yourself
Leaving from this world

Starting to clash our weapons
Touching the ground is certain
Attacking over and over
Trying to beat the others

Fighting between two forces
Will drive us really insane
But if you conquer your fear
You will conquer death

You will become
A man who would survive
You will release yourself
Spreading the final hour
