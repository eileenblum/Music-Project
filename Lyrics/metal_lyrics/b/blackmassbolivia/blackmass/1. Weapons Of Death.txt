[Music - Paz, Jung; Lyrics - Estrugo, Jung]

Lurking of wrath, trapped in the dark, cast down in hell
The fire of death is crowned to the sky, evil is here
Weapons of hell, angel of death, reminder of pain
Feelings of war bringing again anger and death

Weapons of hell, weapons of death
Human disease, weapons of fear

Darkness of night rises to fight, there's battle again
Starting to strike the enemy at once, ending is near
Father of terror, attack using fear, ashes to dust
Fire fight fire, fires again the weapon of hate

Weapons of hell, weapons of death
Human disease, weapons of fear

All feel the pain down to the bones, the legions of hell
Have come to fight, demons are now soldiers of death
How will it end this endless war of heaven and hell
Tear down in fear, anger and hate, pain to the grave

Weapons of hell, weapons of death
Human disease, weapons of fear
