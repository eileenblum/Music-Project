Feeble minds move swiftly.
Fragile hearts come quickly.
Listen to the sound of consequence,
When forever comes crashing.

With action to be taken miles away.
I am in no state for compromise.
Comfort comes too close to keep distance between us.
With moments to catch regret until I stay.

Cast aside the life I've waited for.
She is the hope that calls me home.
We are the score, perfect in sync for being alone.

For what it's worth, I'm coming home.
