Curse at such a blasphemy,
Unless time repents itself.
Within righteous atrocity,
Leads greed to repeat itself,
Followed by temptation.

When death finally finds me,
I'll be sure to meet you there.
Calamity shines (thrives),
Hand in hand; limb from limb.
Followed in temptation.

Within righteous atrocity,
We're killing til kingdom come.
When will death find me?
Please take me now.

Blood and tears will shed our only entity.
When death finally finds me,
I'll be sure to meet you there.
