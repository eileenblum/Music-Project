Your routine gives monotony a run for change.
Countless sheep I will pray for you.
Such a voice will reap as they prey on you.
Hunt til dawn opens my eyes,
I'm still losing my mind.

Charisma will be heard, just not by me.
To think I'd be fine deserves more than you knowing my name.
To think for myself could care less to whom would be ashamed.

Countless sheep I will pray for you.
Such a voice will reap as they prey on you.

Pronounce this bride to be reborn.
May safety in denial keep you warm.
