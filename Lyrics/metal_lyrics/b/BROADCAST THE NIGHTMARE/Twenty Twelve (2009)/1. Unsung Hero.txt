Trauma held my hand in the fire,
I won't play dead for you.
Trauma held my hand in the fire,
But my eyes can't burn through.
(This heart of stone,
Buried under broken bones.)

Have I not made myself clear,
Does this line of fire have a clue of what I'm about to do?
Help holds little faith once this place sets off.
There will be nothing left to rescue.
I'll give you reason to keep quiet.
A gun in your mouth talks quick to shut you up.

No need for a clean getaway,
This will end in a bloody mess.
Hold your fire,
My hostage will not confess with what I've done.

You want me? Come get me,
I'm not coming out alive.

This heart of stone,
Buried under broken bones.
