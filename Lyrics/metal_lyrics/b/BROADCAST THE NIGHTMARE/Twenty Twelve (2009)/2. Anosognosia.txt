To think your soul has a price,
Worth more to what life had bargained for.
Your ultimate sacrifice destroys all you adore.

Rebirth shines in truth,
Paramount the ignorant vision,
With perfect speech.
Repeats in the pride of illusion.

Follow the fear.
Control already made your decision.

(Unfold your mind.)
Search for your own answers.

Wicked tongue of order,
Preach what you've never done.
Broadcast oblivion.
Turn it on.
