Devastation has given the sake of shelter a run for cover.
Privilege escapes to what safe once was.
Ancient warnings hold your shallow legends to deserve much worse.
Lost text have met fire to become our own curse.
Sacred liar, replace your routine.
Media will give hope in a lasting horror scene.
Edge of your seats have nothing on what you're about to witness.
It was written in our blood to spell finish.
Our only chance lies in the glorious risk.

To be more than what fear created.
Blessings collapse under a tirade tongue.
Belief kills any choice of your own.
Apprehend your fate.

There is no life; there is no death;
Only this dream.
There is no first; there is no last;
Regret's useless when you're dead.
