We'll catch your breath on impact to kill you.
(Not to worry, the worst is over.)
Our shadows will cloak the sun under distress to move you.
No need to hurry.

Statues will lead a stray.
Lost has found a way to escape.
I'll be damned if coincidence doesn't strike me down.
Deliverance.

The worst is over once we hit ground.
We'll catch your breath if the gasp awakes too late.
