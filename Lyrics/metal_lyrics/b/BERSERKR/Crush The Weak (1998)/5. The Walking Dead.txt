In a land corrupt and cold, waging war to keep ourselves
Alive among the walking dead, in a world that became hell
Ignore the sights you see, through jaded, lifeless eyes
Ignore reality - and everything looks fine

LIFE AMONG THE WALKING DEAD [x4]

Trust and honor - bought and sold - even freedom's up for sale
In a land where god is gold - and good men rot in jail
Insects are what we've become - in a panic-stricken daze
Faceless - nameless swarms with a singe mindless gaze

LIFE AMONG THE WALKING DEAD [x4]

Do right - and fear no one
Do right - and fear no one
Do right - and fear no one
Do right - and fear no one
