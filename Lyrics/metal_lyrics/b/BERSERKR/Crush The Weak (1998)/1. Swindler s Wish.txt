You built your house of lies
Thru bold, accusing cries
Nature's perpetuav victims
Tall tales of persecution
Some final grand solution
Imaginary inflictions

[Ref.:]
YOU FUCKING LIAR!
Your people profit most
Keeping the holy-hoax
Alive to feed to the sheep
You stretch and twist the truth
And those that question you
Are automatically evil...

YOU FUCKING LIAR!

Choke on your lies
Six million lies
Our guilt, your gain
