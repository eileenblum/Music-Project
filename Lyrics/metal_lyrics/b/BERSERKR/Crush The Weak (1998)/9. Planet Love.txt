We'd like to welcome you to planet love
Where information is controlled just like a drug
Where what is right - is wrong
And logic - insane
What's bad is good for you, and pleasure - sin and pain

[Ref.:]
Here on planet love -
where we pretend we're all the same
Here on planet love -
this melting pot's gone up in flames
Here on planet love - the dreams of racial harmony
Here on planet love - a far cry from reality

There's no such thing as "race" - we are all brothers
We're going to force you to love one another
Love your enemies and turn the other cheek
We'll change manking into a herd of human sheep

We'd like to thank you for your cooperation
For helping us with your extermination [x2]
