Last night - another victim
This morning's headlines scream
So what I have done is real
Oh come to me, oh rancid vermin
Breathe your last, you've met your doom
Gasp your silent shrieks of horror
In fires of hell your soul's consumed

[Ref.:] MINE IS THE BLADE OF JUSTICE [x4]

My blade's still flecked with blood
The image burns in my mind
A broken body, lying - bleeding
No witness but the night

Stacking them out - shredding them down
Stacking them out - shredding them down
Stacking them out - shredding them down
Stacking them out - shredding them down
