Poison - infecting your system
It's burning your mind out - but still you listen
Torture - how long is forever?
Your mind's been torn apart - put back forever

At the mercy of a foe you cannot see
He's ivil incarnate in a cloack of humanity
Time is wearing on the layers of his desguise
His nature is showing through
His nature is showing through

[Ref.:]
Oh, can't you see what's behind it all [x2]
Tear off the mask - off with the mask [x4]

Brainwash - a lifetime of lies
The best self-hatred that money can buy
Teach you to hate your own kind
Control of your music is control of your mind
