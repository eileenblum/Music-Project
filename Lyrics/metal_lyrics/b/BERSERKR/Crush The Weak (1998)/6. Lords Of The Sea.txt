The breath of odin fills our sails
Our dragons ships smash thru the ice
Our mighty songs fill the misty skies
We're one and all prepared to die

[Ref.:]
Mighty odin, hear our song
Mighty odin, it won't be long
Guide our ships thru the stormy seas
To distant lands and to victory

Days and nights on the endless sea
Dreaming of maidens we left behind
And what awaits on the unknown shore
Excited hands grip axe and sword

We land - we fight - we kill - for Odin
We land - we fight - we kill - for Odin
