My world is cold and gray
I don't know if it's night or day
The seasons pass, but time has stopped
Trapped inside a concrete box

[Ref.:]
I fell sanity drifting out of me
Darkness filling me - time is killing me
ISOLATION

Days - to weeks - to month - to years
I can't remember not being here
Stare at the wall with skulls in my eyes
Don't give a fuck if I live or if I die
