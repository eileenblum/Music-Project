Young and old - husband and wife - child and mother
Frightened eyes - to the skies - cling to each other
The sirens drown fearful screams
From the cellars
DAMN THE SKIES - DAMN THE BOMBS
Damn the killers

[Ref.:]
My mind is whole - body and soul
Revenge is mine - eye for and eye
My nation is whole - body and soul

The ashes of 300.000 fill the skies
There's nothing left - innocent people the only victims
From the wreckage - a woman screams
"We were civilians!"

Eye for an eye - eye for an eye
