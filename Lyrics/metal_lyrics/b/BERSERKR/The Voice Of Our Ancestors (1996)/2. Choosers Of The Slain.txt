Far above the stench of the city
Thought and Memory circle the sky
Watching, Listening to what's said and done
They soar quickly as they rise into the heavens
Make haste across the rainbow bridge
To Valhalla to warn and prepare
The mighty death horn is sounding it's sad song
For death's maidens to take to the air

[CHORUS:]
Riding high in the sky tonight
Servants of Odin prepare for the fight
Down through the pouring rain
The Valkyries choose their slain
The air hangs heavy with death tonight!

The proud soldiers who fall in the struggle
Defending home and folk by the sword
Will be taken aloft to Valhalla
The Hall of Kings is their final reward
Always one more seat at the table
There's always room in the hall of the slain
There's always time for feasting and fighting
Wenches and mead at the end of the day
