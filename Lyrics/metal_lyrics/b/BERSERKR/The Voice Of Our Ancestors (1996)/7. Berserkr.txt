I'm on the edge of bloodlust
and sanity. You wanna live?
Stay the fuck away from me
Step in my reach and you'll see for yourself

[BRIDGE:]
I go to battle with no fear in my heart
anxiously waiting to tear you apart
Ready to smash, ready to fight
I'm gonna kill everyone in sight

[CHORUS:]
Berserk - Steel in my hand, blood in my eye
Berserk - Fight till I fall, my enemies die
Berserk - Hungry for blood, so eager to fight
Berserk - Steel in my hand, blood in my eye

I'm on the field fighting night and day
Enemies scatter to give me the right of way
I'm on the field proud, fighting for honor
Shoulder to shoulder with
my Kinsmen and Brothers
