[Black Sabbath cover]

Have you ever thought about your soul?
and can it be saved?
Perhaps you think that when you're dead
You just stay in your grave
Must someone be right, and the other be wrong?
It's just a point of view
If we can't unite then our people will die
You know that it's true

Some of us belive in a god or gods
Or no god at all
Whatever you belive, we've got to unite
Until our enemies fall
There's no way to prove that what I belive
Is the only way
Religious belief is a personal thing
We should kepp it that way

[BREAK:]
We spend so much time at war with each other
while our enemies laugh and sharpen their claws
They see the truth that our Folk have forgotten -
That Self-Preservation is the Highest Law
Why can't our folk see beyon their religions and
work side by side for the good of us all
It's insane to argue and bicker and battle
While we watch our future crumble and fall

Wait until you see what's in front of your
face when you open your eyes
The answers been clear for so many years
It's still a surprise
The centuries pass, but religions won't last
The damage is done
We haven't got time to recondition our minds
'Til this battle is won
