I got my pride,
Won't put my hands up
Won't run and hide,
Can't you see I've had enough?
No one can tell me
That what I'm doing is wrong
I've got a vision
That may come true before it's too long

I look around me lately
These days you can never tell
Whose your friend or foe
Before it's too Late
Stay silent, act alone
The future is ours
We must be patient
Survival is our history
and our fate

[CHORUS:]
a Vision for the Future
Based on the lessons from the past
a Vision for the Future
Based on the lessons from the past

I look ahead
Don't quite know what I see
But I know just what I want
I've got hard work ahead of me
and I look behind me
I'm not ashamed of where I've been
But I've got to live
ain't gonna make the same mistakes again

'Til someone comes along
Who makes some sense to me
I'll follow nothing more
Than what my own two eyes can see
We're tired of being used
I won't play nobody's fool
My kind's a breed apart
Not bodyguards or front line tools
