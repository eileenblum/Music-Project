Through drifting clouds of smoke
I see my enemy
Spied through a weathered lens
across a sandy sea
I sit encased in steel
Sworn to my fatherland
My turrets belching death
across the desert sands

[CHORUS:]
Watching
Waiting
Hunting
Destroying

Dark mounds engulfed in flames
Wrecked by my deadly shells
My cannons quake the earth
all targets bound for hell
and from this foreign desert
I shall defend my land
My Panzer blasting death
across the desert sands

[repeat all except replace last stanza with:]
Oak leaves and Iron Cross
I fight at Rommel's side
Next to the desert fox
Great odds we will defy
Glory and Victory
await the reaching hands
Of those who follow death across the sands
