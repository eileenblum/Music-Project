[MTTB cover]

Look back on your life, you've done nothing worth a shit
And the problems you've caused give a reason for your death
Outta your place still you think you own the world
Did you think you couldn't die?
Did you think we wouldn't care?

[Chorus:]
Justice - at the end of a rope - Now you're dead, now you're dead
Nigger - at the end of a rope - Now you're dead, now you're dead
Justice

Poisoning kids, you make your living selling drugs
and robbing the old, still you're never satisfied
Down on your knees, now your judgement day is here
You've been sentenced to death by the people of America

[Chorus]
