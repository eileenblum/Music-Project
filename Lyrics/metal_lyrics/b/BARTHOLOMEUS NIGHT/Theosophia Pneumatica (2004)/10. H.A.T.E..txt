A rotten world sat it all in flames
Create death as a part of your life
Say only true lies to progress

Acknowledging the essence of hate

Who you think we are
Do you think we care
Hate shaped us all
Hatred you can not bare

A rotten world sat it all in flames
Hate shaped us all and forever remains...
