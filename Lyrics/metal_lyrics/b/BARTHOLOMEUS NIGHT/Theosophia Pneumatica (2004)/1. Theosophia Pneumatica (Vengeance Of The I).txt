Falling into an endless void
Searching for the ultimate gift
Your life as u knew fades away
As darkness consume the light of day
I call thee emperor lucifer as god of gods
Grant thee thy infernal wisdom of the old
Impowered me with the stranght of the young
To praise thee name over mortal lands
Reclaim your glory, for I will rule by your command
We are the burning pain, salvation of man
o-god all mercifull, will u answer the prays?
Waking up-with the first light of day
Wondering about the dream-what did it mean?
Can it be-am I who I was taught to be?
The reality I see in my eyes-a reflaction of the inner I!
I - Release
Dreafting apart from the self-uniting with the I
Pumped with the blood from my heart
The true face of the world unveil before me
Hatred and rage, for humanity shell fall
For my wise, thus, ur will
Eternal universal enslavement
I call thee four names of blasphemy
Lucifer, levaitan, satan, belial
Know that our years are the years of war
And our days are measured as battels
And every hour is a life..
He who awakens him calls thee ancient
Vengence of the elder ones
Upon himself and upon the world
An old vengence.. vengence of the I
Falling into an endless void
As darkness consume the light of day
Ur life fades away
The old vengence of the I
