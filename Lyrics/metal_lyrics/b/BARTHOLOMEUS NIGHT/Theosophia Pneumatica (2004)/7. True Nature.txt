Look in to my eyes the fire that burns inside. Like the flames of time it will never die.
Born under the sign of the moon Invoked by the forces of doom
To the kingdom where the sound of the dead echoes
And swords of warriors buried under the sands of time
Where mighty kings lived and kingdoms fight
To praise the ancient war gods

In the beginning the feared and worshipped him
The true master of this world
But as time passed he was forgotten by his servants
And become a mere shadow of the sun

We will circle the prepared altar with gold and silver shine
And our black moon will shine above us as a demon
To call forth the one arise goatlord

Stories to children dark fairytales of evilness
They thought he died but how can a nature die
He is inside us all Desire - Imagination - Greed and Hunger
The time has come to set the beast free

Ah the river turned to blood of the pure of heart
The storms rages inside as the beast turned loss
The lord have returned to the world And
The fake duties vanished away for good

The true nature reviled

AD MAJOREM SATANNA DOMINA
