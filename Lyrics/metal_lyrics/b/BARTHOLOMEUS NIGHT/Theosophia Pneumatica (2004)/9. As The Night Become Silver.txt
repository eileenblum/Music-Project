Blackness glory, oh dreadful night.
Incantations are whispered by demons at sight.
Upon fairies which dance over pine trees surround.

And the spell now starts to flow, and the fairies flying by heights.
Dancing gently with night demons, tasting heavenly delights.

When the spell shell be removed, winds will carry fairies cries.
Then, the fairies pale and bright, will wet their fairies eyes.

And the tears fall on the ground and it shines like fireflies.
On the ground shines million stars, like a mirror of the skies.

"And the pine trees, which surround whisper:
Fairies, look how wondrous is the night,
And how beautifully it shines"

Blackness glory, oh dreadful night.
Incantations are whispered by demons at sight.
Upon fairies which dance over pine trees surround.

The saddest story, oh beautiful night.
The silver moon raised and silvered all sights.
And the fairies dance over pine trees surround.
And spawn their silver strands.
