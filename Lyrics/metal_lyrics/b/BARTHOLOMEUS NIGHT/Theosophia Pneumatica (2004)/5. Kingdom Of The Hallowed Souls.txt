The cry of mankind music to my ears
The stars shine upon me a shadow of mortality

With hatred filled in my heart I roomed around the land
Searching for the ones who deserve their bloody death
The ones who betrayed me who mocked me straight in my face
They will soon will have to accept their grim faith

Curse u bitch for what u have caused
A smile on my face when I will u fall
And when you fall I will be there to see
Life goes in circles now I am free

The nightshades beauty of darkness
Son of light I am not
Forever remains in the shadows
In the kingdom of the hollowed souls

Tears will fall to the ground remorse in your heart
But what have done can not be changed reality strike
Torment will become your best friend welcome to my world
A world of endless despair kingdom of the dammed

And the tears will turn to blood the voices calling you to join them
In the realm below the kingdom of the hollowed souls

The nightshades beauty of darkness
Son of light I am not
Forever remains in the shadows
In the kingdom of the hollowed souls

The journey ends you
Will see the gates before you
And to your amazed you will see me waiting for you "Let me open the gate for you" I said
I am the gate keeper to the kingdom of the dammed

The nightshades beauty of darkness
Son of light I am not
Forever remains in the shadows
In the kingdom of the hollowed souls
