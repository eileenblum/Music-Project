Who are you
Never acknowledge your failures
Declaration of false power may fit your design
Oh what a typical human behavior

And what is your diagnostics of nature
Do you fear of your own reflection
Your will has the strength of the infernally legions
Yet the reason consuming your soul
So for once stand by the truth
And give yourself to the core
Release yourself from the mask

Failure Denied

This darkness contains all you wish for
The will and the reason combine
Our souls here unite in the screaming hells fire
The option of failure denied

Failure denied

Your search must end now
As all you feared break down or died
Your heart hard as stone-filled with winds of destruction
Know the path to all this is inside

Let the will and reason form the true will
Indulge your vessel in pride
Our souls here unite in the screaming of hells fire
The option of failure Denied
