Like a newborn child
Coming in from the cold
Take me in and wrap me up now
Then I will disappear to you

Say goodbye to your nightmares
They are only contributions
No more are you free now
Dreaming

How long 'til you waste away
Take it down til time will sear
No more are you free now
I am right

Die as I stand right here forever, yeah
Never give up a fight
And I'll never forget no one
Stay because all you win
Dark worlds [?]

[?]
So long it's only mind your thoughts your own
Never knowing what you will find
[?] you're on your own
Dreaming

How long 'til I waste away
Take it down til time will sear
No more are you free now
No way out

I won't wait nowhere
For no one, no
Stand beside self, aware
We don't, they don't save me
I'm out of my fucking mind
And crazy for you
But I will die all over myself
Won't fear they don't return

Shining like Roman sunlight
Dreaming waiting for the time to win her love

Long and cold is my time

A worldwide dowry
Over and under...[?]
