LIGHT GOES OUT IN MY MIND
AND I THINK I'M GOING INSANE
SEPARATE FROM YOUR LIFE
THOSE THINGS THAT BRING YOU PAIN
GIVE ME BACK WHAT YOU STOLE
'CAUSE THESE WERE THE DARKEST YEARS

NEVER CAN TRUST YOUR DAD
'CAUSE HE'LL ONLY DO YOU WRONG
SO WRONG
- TOLD YOU SO
EMPTY SPACE IN MY LIFE
FILL IT UP WITH MYSELF

BLACK HOLE LEFT IN MY MIND
AND I'M CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE
DO I HAVE STRENGTH TO GO ON
'CAUSE THESE WOUNDS WON'T HEAL WITH TIME

NEVER CAN TRUST YOUR DAD
'CAUSE HE'LL ONLY DO YOU WRONG
SO LONG
- NOW I'M GONE
EMPTY SPACE IN YOUR LIFE
FILL IT UP WITH YOURSELF
TIME GROWS CLOSE IN MY LIFE
I DESCEND TO THE TOWER PLACE

CLOCK TICKING STRIKES THE HOUR
I SHOWED YOU MY DARKEST FEAR
WITHIN YOU IS THE POWER
TO PUT BEHIND THOSE DARK YEARS
AND GIVE ME BACK WHAT YOU STOLE
THOSE WERE MY DARKEST FEARS

NEVER TO TRUST AGAIN

WHIRLWIND OF CONFUSION
I SHOWED YOU MY BIG MISTAKE
