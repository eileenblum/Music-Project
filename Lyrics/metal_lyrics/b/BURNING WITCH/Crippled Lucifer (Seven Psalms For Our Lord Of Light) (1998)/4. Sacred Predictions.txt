SO YOU THINK I'M WASTING MY LIFE
YOU MIGHT BE SOUL - SOUL IN TOW
YOU SEEK TO SUFFER
I DON'T CARE, I'VE GOT ALL OF MY PILLS AND THINGS
SAY THAT IT'S ALL IN MY MIND
I WON'T LIVE MY LIFE OVER AND OVER AGAIN
SABOTAGING MY FEELINGS
PSEUDO SEPPUKU

MY MIND FLOWS FREELY
ON WINGS OF FIRE
SUB-ATOMIC PLACE
MY SECRET DESIRE

SO YOU THINK I'M WASTING MY LIFE
YOU WILL LOSE YOUR INDIVIDUALITY
AND SAY THAT IT'S ALL IN MY MIND
I WON'T LIVE MY LIFE OVER AND OVER AGAIN
'CAUSE BABY I WAS BORN TO DIE
AND I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING IS RIGHT

POST ATOMIC ACE
THE ONE EYED MARTYR
HE PUTS YOU IN YOUR PLACE
WITH SACRED PREDICTIONS

WHY DID I FALL?
METHRDONE CYCLONE IS ALL
IN MY LIFE NOW
I WON'T LOSE MY PRIDE
WHY DO YOU THINK I DO WHAT I DO
DON'T YOU KNOW I'M JUST THINKING OF YOU

SUPERSONIC FORCE
THE ONE-EYED SUPERHERO
FOLDING TIME AND SPACE
I THINK AND FEEL
LOOK  HE'S RIGHT NOW
SMOKE FILLS THE SKY
THE NUCLEAR WINTER
IS METHADONE CYCLONE...
