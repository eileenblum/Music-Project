The time has begun,
ItÂs time for against the enemy
No time to waste And killed them all
I want them seeing my fucking wrath,
IÂll Making them running like a dog.
I hate everyone, who always fuckin hurt me

Face to face, Realized your angry
Face to face, i will make all crying

I want to make a half of my live to be better
I wanna feel a better, and I will make it true

I just want to be my self
IÂm not who you are
So donÂt ever try to push me,
Please donÂt ever insist your desire,

[Reff:] God damned , mother fucker
IÂll got you, I killed you
This is all of my hate!!!

I want to make a half of my live be a better
I want felt a better and IÂll make all be better
