For a half of my life,
You brought me to the darkness side
Living in the most darkness fear
I am blinded by my weakness

Dying in the most torturing pain
It sheep beneath my skin
Stuck inside my broken soul

I am too damaged to be heal
And youÂre too dead to be conscious
then I lost in a shattered dreams of being with you

Standing in the most sacred place.
Watched me suffering half to death
Sedated with thousand promises
But it never coincide

These see thing anger,
Got me feel with desire to hurt you
ItÂs a great way to end your life
Lead you to the oblivion

[Reff:] IÂm running as fast as I can and never looked back
Carrying my deepest sorrow away from you
