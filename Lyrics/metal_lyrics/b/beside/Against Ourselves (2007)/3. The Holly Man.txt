Hunting to find the answer
Closing comment youÂve to told me
I believe with my decisions
No reason to betray my self.

Fuck holly man, I know what I must doing,
Fuck holly man, this is my self.

Save all your breath that you can breathe
Engulfed your words
DonÂt ever to talking bullshit

Fuck holly man, I know what I must doing,
Fuck holly man, this is my self.

Everything that you told me
Engender hatred

I am a grimmer
With the soil sin.
And You feel the holly man
Whereas, youÂre the liar with a gold mask
I am so fuckin sorrow

I canÂt escape from a shadow
Your lied still remains in my arm

IÂll wait the salvations
From a putrid mouth around my face
Stop to make me paltry
