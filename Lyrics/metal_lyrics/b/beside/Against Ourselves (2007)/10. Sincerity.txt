I scream in fear trying to wake up
A thousand questions aggrieved my self
I canÂt find harmonic bliss between the black and white
I donÂt even know how to find a way
Lost in the darkness that I hide place

I follow the hollow a broken wing that I adore
The theology has lead me to the grey days
I donÂt even know how to find a way
Lost in the darkness that I hide place

Even thought I know that will lead me to the valley of decay

Take me out, take me away
From the deepest of decay hole
Take me out, take me away
God give me sincerity

I wish upon a falling star
IÂm still waiting that I can talk with god
But the light of salvations never has comes to me
IÂm falling again to the valley of decay.
