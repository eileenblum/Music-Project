Brave means nothing
ItÂs the only thing to be blame
Killing, aching, hating everywhere
They live in a hand of times

Love was such an easy weakness to live with
Stole the joy, stole the smile, even stole the sun
Anarchies become the world famous number one

[Reff:] Booming like poisoned mushroom everywhere
Seventh deadly sin, seventh dead of destructions

Killed by the name of life
Guide by the name of god
Whistling sound from the deepest hearth
Crash my enormous thought of us.
