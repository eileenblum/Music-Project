This fog is to thickto make my vision blurred 
so fuckin hard to move to find away 
and no one's giving the hand 
i stand alone looking for a way out 
never know the purpose of life 
just to find passion and pleasure angry
i'm still waiting for a new day 
when the flag of victory arise 
no more insulin needles and toxic 
just make a covenant with death 
i know i just digging my own grave 
everybody could you help me found my way
we still here , still have so much to approve 
when i realized still have so much to approve
we stand on our faith.. 
when angle will guide us to find away 
we stand on our faith 
and angle will show us the right away
