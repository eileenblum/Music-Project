I canât control my self, 
Trying to a wake from a nightmares 
When everyone seem underestimate me 
...Sometimes I fell alone between a people. 
What you gonna do with me 
Youâre the crazy bastard to consumed by hate
We are a new blood, we are a new breathe 
We are the new colony, 
Burning me, you canât stop us!!
Iâll to make my oath on the wall 
In the name of my life 
This time I will pay what you have done 
This is a new day
We are a new blood, we are a new breathe 
We are the new colony, 
Burning me, FUCK YOU.. Our name is BESIDE !!
Song : 
I can burn my own blood 
I can stand alone 
Finally I found the light 
Forever Iâll keep my own lifeâs
This is our power
