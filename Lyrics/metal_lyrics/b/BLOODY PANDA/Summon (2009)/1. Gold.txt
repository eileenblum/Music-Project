There are collisions in the universe
Your teeth pretend not to know
Self defence, force and emotion

Give me a hint

We digest your profit right now, right now
You repeat a whisful (sic) thinking in the well
We know you will be repaid in kind
Words of comfort, justice and a fist

You will dig a well to hide your name
We won't forgive you for breaking the peace
Dead force, rebirth and iron sand
A mad scramble for seats in your head

Give me a hint

Twist the fact to meditate
Flash back
