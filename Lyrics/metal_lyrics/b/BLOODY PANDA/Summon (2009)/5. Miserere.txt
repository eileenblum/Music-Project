The eggs burn their nest and bury themselves
In a pit fall
After all they have made the same mistake again
Didn't I tell you so?

I am always talking about you
You turned my heartbeat into a trap in an instant

What I said, that way, this way
Do we regain our feet?

People I don't know
Loss of memory with amazing speed
A dot. What do you mean by that?
We tied your horses to a post

Are you listening to me at this moment?
Now we are walking on the dots under the roof
People I know. Overpayment
Just between you and me
Your nails are well dyed but I don't remember anything
I don't remember well
Cound down

Are you listening to me at this moment?
The day
It doesn't work at all
Our best days. We have a quick mind
Please do something about by the second
The day
Are you listening to me?

[Japanese Lyrics]

Don't push your head out of the food cycle
What year is it now?
What day is it today?
It's my turn
Destroy the evidence
You look different today

[Japanese Lyrics]

Once we are easy targets under the skin
The past shakes the brain off the wall
The future shakes the brain off the wall

[Japanese Lyrics]

After images of doodle bugs in the peepholes
A sudden change
This is our National Anthem
Now we make no disguise in a bottomless swamp
I will bring you back

SO PLEASE
PLEASE

Optical illusions
A figment of your imagination
Immortal race
Ants around a burning sugar cube
Prick your seeds with a needle
And laugh with their mouthes (sic) wide open
Before your very eyes in the safety net
We restore youth when you grow old, old,
When you grow old
With our prayer beads
