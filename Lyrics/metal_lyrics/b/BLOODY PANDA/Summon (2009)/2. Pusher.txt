Drag me out from the bathtub
The cell stood there, bound as if by a spell
Diamonds behind the madness cross the river of death

And genetic codes had no idea of time

Diamonds behind the madness cross the river of death

Who gave you that idea?
Movement of the numbers
What next?

A great sorrow drives itself into a corner
A symbol of fetters
Silver gray
