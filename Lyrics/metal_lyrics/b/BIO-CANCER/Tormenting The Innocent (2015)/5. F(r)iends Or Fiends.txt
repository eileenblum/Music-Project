F(R)IENDS OR FIENDS? 
What can I do to understand them, they never cease to disappoint me 
THEY ARE NEVER THERE when you need them they don't care 
People are strange I can't trust em 
One day they are here the next one gone 
FIENDS DISGUISED AS FRIENDS better watch out I'm on my own 
Friends or fiends, every day the feel 
The need to break you down their betrayal cuts like steel 
So what can I do, 
What should I do, 
What can I say? 
I can't understand them 
Can't understand... 
Them 
What can I do to understand you? 
F(R)IENDS OR FIENDS? 
They'll only laugh when you laugh, they laugh again if you're sad 
THEY JUST DON'T CARE but who needs em anyway? 
They failed to gain my own trust, I see the monster behind the mask 
BETTER OFF ALONE alone and on my own 
Friends or fiends, every day the feel 
The need to break you down their betrayal cuts like steel 
So what can I do, 
What should I do, 
What can I say? 
I can't understand them 
Can't understand... 
Them 
F(R)IENDS OR FIENDS? 
F(R)IENDS OR FIENDS? 
FRIENDS 
Friends or fiends, every day the feel 
The need to break you down their betrayal cuts like steel 
So what can I do, 
What should I do, 
What can I say? 
I can't understand them 
What can I do, 
What should I do, 
What can I say? 
I can't understand them 
Can't understand... 
Them 
What can I do to understand them?
