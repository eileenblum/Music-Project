Blame it on 
Economic crisis or growing unemployment 
Maybe just stupidity gifted us with another problem today 
A gang of foulmouthed patriots - now regarded an legit party 
People with far-right backgrounds fanaticize the youth such a shame 
You see them on the news everyday guarding the state or thatâs what they say, 
All I see is bullies, killers, liars, hypocrites 
Xenophobic racists judging people by their color 
They reject all these labels take a look behind their mask there is lots to see 
THINK - Where are you're going to give your vote 
THINK - Whom are you gonna make your ally 
THINK - Will you just use your head YOUR HEAD 
And think 
THINK - It's not late to change your mind 
THINK WHO YOU'LL TRY TO MAKE YOUR ALLY 
Think will you just use your head your head 
And think 
So what you gonna do? 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do WHEN THEY 
When they come for you, when they'll come for you FIGHT BACK 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do WHEN THEY 
No exceptions,no mercy no 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do WHEN THEY 
When they come for you, when they'll come for you FIGHT BACK 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do WHEN THEY 
All you gotta do is think 
THINK - Where are you're going to give your vote 
THINK - Whom are you gonna make your ally 
THINK - Will you just use your head YOUR HEAD 
And think 
THINK - It's not late to change your mind 
THINK WHO YOU'LL TRY TO MAKE YOUR ALLY 
Think will you just use your head your head 
And think 
Are those the ones, the ones you'll follow 
Are those the bastards who fill our lives with sorrow 
There is blood on their hands, their future is so dark 
Don't take their shit, donât take their shit 
Get them on the run, don't be afraid 
We must watch each otherâs backs 
Get them on the run, don't be afraid 
We must watch each otherâs backs 
Get them on the run, don't be afraid 
All you gotta do is think 
THINK - Where are you're going to give your vote 
THINK - Whom are you gonna make your ally 
THINK - Will you just use your head YOUR HEAD 
And think 
THINK - It's not late to change your mind 
THINK WHO YOU'LL TRY TO MAKE YOUR ALLY 
Think will you just use your head your head 
And think 
THINK 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do WHEN THEY 
When they come for you, when they'll come for you FIGHT BACK 
What you gonna do, what you gonna do WHEN THEY 
Use your head
