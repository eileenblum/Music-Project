Life today is hard 
Life today is pain 
Life today is struggling for pretty much nothing everyday 
But that doesn't mean 
That we must stop fighting 
That we'll dig our own graves 
And jump inside like fools 
CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE - Is that your solution? 
DON'T TRY TO DENY - That you'll forsake the gift of 
LIFE IS TOUGH - I'll give you that but so must be you 
SO YOU QUIT? - Man, it's just pathetic 
I myself see things kinda differently 
I don't think so, that I could (ever) be so weak 
Hell, Iâm sure I'm not that weak cause 
LIFE IS TOUGH, SO AM I 
LIFE IS TOUGH, SO AM I 
LIFE IS TOUGH, SO AM I 
Will never think 'bout suicide
