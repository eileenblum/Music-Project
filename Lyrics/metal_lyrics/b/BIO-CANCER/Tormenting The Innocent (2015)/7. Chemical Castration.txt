Incarcerated between bars and walls 
With hopes one day can breathe the free air again 
But the true torture has not begun just yet 
He is their new ''punk bitch'' the law pretends to be blind 
LIVING HELL being looked at like fresh new meat 
BEING USED AND ABUSED by inmates and staff as well 
Sure he broke the law 
But punishment doesn't fit the crime 
But how to carry on 
When punishment doesn't fit the crime 
CHEMICAL CASTRATION 
No time for ethics here, the escape plan backfired 
Raped day by day, and itâs getting harder 
This thing must stop at all cost, cause you are someone's ''maid'' now, 
He calls you his wife and treats you like one 
PRISON TIME is nothing like you'd expect 
BEING USED AND ABUSED again and again and again 
Sure he broke the law 
But punishment doesn't fit the crime 
But how to carry on 
When punishment doesn't fit the crime 
CHEMICAL CASTRATION 
Drag them fucking drag them DRAG THEM 
Castrate them completely slip pills in their meal 
Drag them fucking drag them DRAG THEM 
Castrate them completely and hope they never find out 
CHEMICAL CASTRATION
