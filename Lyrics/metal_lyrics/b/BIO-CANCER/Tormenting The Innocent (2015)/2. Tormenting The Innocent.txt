Tormenting the innocent 
ALONE - With the back against the wall 
THE FEAST - The feast will soon begin 
SUSPECT - But you can't be too sure 
Don't you know where it came from 
YOU'RE MEAL - For them their nourishment 
SOON TEETH - Cut deep and through your flesh 
HUNGER - Will never be complete 
Don't you know where it came from 
TORMENTING THE INNOCENT 
Red teeth, inside your eyes 
TORMENTING them 
Tormenting the innocent find horrid ways to escape from SANITY 
Tormenting the innocent mind rotten by BATH SALTS 
Tormenting the innocent find horrid ways to escape from SANITY 
Tormenting the innocent mind rotten by BATH SALTS 
BATH SALTS - Have drugged their minds and souls 
REASON - Is nowhere to be found 
HORROR - But what can someone do 
Feel your skin ripped off violently 
NO WAY - Can't run they hold you tight 
YOU'RE SLAVE to their sadistic might 
SOON DEAD - And rotten to the core 
Feel your Skin ripped off violently 
TORMENTING THE INNOCENT 
Red teeth, inside your eyes 
TORMENTING them

THEY WILL SHOW NO FEAR - And they're gonna eat your face off 
Tormenting the innocent 
Nothing seems to satisfy them 
Run run (but) can't run from 'em 
They're gonna eat your face off 
TORMENTING THE INNOCENT- Tormenting them
