In a world of violence, gangs sit on top, luring kids to crime
easy to be in one, but what if you want to get out?

in a box your life may end
you should've known better than to betray them
you could not see, you could not guess,
it's not that simple to abandon them
in a box your life may end, you should've known better than to betray them,
you could not see, you could not guess
it's not that simple to abandon them, in a box your life may end
you could not see, you could not guess

once you're in, there's no out, inside the box, you try your luck
they'll shoot at you with no remorse, will you survive or it's the end?
You got inside were having fun,
you thought was cool to be in gang,
but seen some things that were too much
thug life is no playground,
you wanted out,
they'll set you free?
They'll let you go, or make you pay?

You'll be boxed out, no other way, can't just walk away so.

In a box your life may end,
you should've known better than to betray them,
you could not see, you could not guess,
it's not that simple to abandon them,
