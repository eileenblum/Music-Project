Taking hits is something I'm used to
If they want to break my spirit one thing they should know
Going under is something I won't do
Gonna fight till the end, ready and willing to 

Familiar faces same goal runs their minds
You can't bring me down, no
You should not even try
Locked and loaded waiting for your move
I accept your challenge so

GIVE ME YOUR BEST shot
GIVE ME YOUR BEST shot
Bulletproof

[Chorus]
Give all you've got
It sure as hell won't be enough
I will walk tall
As I, as I have done before
Try to BREAK ME
No chance YOU'LL SEE
Not now, NEVER, I am
Bulletproof

Face to face you don't seem so tough
Your words can't touch me I'm superior
It's not your fault, you're too dumb to realize
Still waiting your move, so

GIVE ME YOUR BEST shot
GIVE ME YOUR BEST shot
Bulletproof

[Chorus]

Indestructible invisible hard to catch, no way you can
TRY TO CATCH ME Impossible TRY TO CATCH ME you'll fail

GIVE ALL YOU GOT IT WON'T BE ENOUGH I WILL WALK TALL
TRY TO BREAK ME NO CHANCE YOU'LL SEE NOT NOW, NEVER
I WILL PREVAIL AND YOU SHALL FAIL I'M HERE STANDING
I AM...
Bulletproof

[Chorus]

I will PREVAIL
And you SHALL FAIL
I'm here STANDING
I AM
Bulletproof
Try to BREAK ME
No chance YOU'LL SEE
Not now, NEVER,
I AM
Bulletproof
