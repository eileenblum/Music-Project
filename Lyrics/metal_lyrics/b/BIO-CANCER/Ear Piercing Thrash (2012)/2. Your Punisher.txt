Trying to live a life, a life that itâs not real
Dying day by day but help is nowhere near
Always getting pushed, always getting mocked
Being thrashed in your hands, when it would
Be enough for you to stop

Iâll take care of my life - put an end to this
I must escape of your profanity
Iâll take care of my life - put an end to this
Must escape of your insanity
Now you turned me into a ticking bomb
Now you wait its time to explode
Iâm not what you though I would be
No sucker no no!

Pushing, when this will come to the END
Or Iâm trying to live like DEAD
You look like you will not CARE
But you will meet your

Punisher! Has come to take your LIFE, AWAY
Your punisher! Has come to take your LIFE, AWAY, AWAY

HAS COME TO TAKE YOU LIFE AWAY!

Shut your mouth end is near I will fucking carry on
Shut your mouth end is near I will fucking carry on
My existence you wonât destroy I will fucking carry on
Shut your mouth end is near

Pushing, when this will come to the END
Or Iâm trying to live like DEAD
You look like you will not CARE
But you will meet your

Punisher! Has come to take your LIFE, AWAY
Your punisher! Has come to take your LIFE, AWAY, AWAY

Pushing, when this will come to the END
Or Iâm trying to live like DEAD
You look like you will not CARE
But you will meet your

Punisher! Has come to take your LIFE, AWAY
Your punisher! Has come to take your LIFE, AWAY, AWAY

HAS COME TO TAKE YOU LIFE AWAY!
