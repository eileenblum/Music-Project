What is this voice - commands to kill
I canât resist killing is all I need
How could it be - is it a dream
What is this voice my hate is going strong
Iâm the one committing all these crimes

Itâs not my will but clearly I canât see
This could lead to insanity
Itâs not my will but clearly I canât see
This could lead to insanity

Strange screams coming in my head
Itâs real or fake, wonder if I am the one who causes pain
Mind is blank but a bad feeling COMES
Iâm the one committing all these crimes

Killing, IN MY MIND
Killing habit itâs the one Iâve GOT

Wow!

Itâs not my will but clearly I canât see
This could lead to insanity
Itâs not my will but clearly I canât see
This could lead to insanity

Killing, IN MY MIND
Killing habit itâs the one Iâve GOT
