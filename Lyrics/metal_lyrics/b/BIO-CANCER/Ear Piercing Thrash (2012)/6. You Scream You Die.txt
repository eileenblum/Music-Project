You scream
You should know the story told very long ago
Blood and agony cries and pain was surrounding everything
Led by injustice to kill everyone who silenced her
Silenced forever! Listen how it goes!

She is WAITING
You TO SCREAM OUT
You are DEFLESHED
Defleshed and out of this world

Make one (last) mistake
Scream your lungs away
Now you rest in pain
LIFE FLOUGHT AWAY

You scream, you die!

Beware the stare of Mary Shaw,
She has no children, she only has dolls.
And if you see her in your dreams,
Be sure you never never, ever scream.
Sheâll rip your tongue out at the seams.
Sheâll hunt you down to eternity
Try to escape, itâs too late
Trapped in this bloody fate!

She is WAITING
You TO SCREAM OUT
You are DEFLESHED
Defleshed and out of this world

Make one (last) mistake
Scream your lungs away
Now you rest in pain
LIFE FLOUGHT AWAY

She is WAITING
You TO SCREAM OUT
You are DEFLESHED
Defleshed and out of this world

Make one (last) mistake
Scream your lungs away
Now you rest in pain
LIFE FLOUGHT AWAY

You scream, you die!
