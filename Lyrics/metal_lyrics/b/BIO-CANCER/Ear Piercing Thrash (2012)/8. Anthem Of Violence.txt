Living on the edge using deadly force
Psychically abusing whatâs standing on my way
Damaging to death, seems fine to me
I donât have any issues itâs (just) my personality
But people never seem
To understand a thing, calling me insane but thatâs not what i think
I overused it now wonât care of what they say
So i found myself locked in a fucking cage!

OBEY!
THE ANTHEM OF VIOLENCE!
OBEY!
Thatâs the way I choose to live!

(You ask me if I am) rehabilitated
Such a stupid word you boys made up
So you can feel useful
Sitting there with your tux and feel ok
YOUâRE A JERK! YOUâRE A JERK!
Your're a jerk! And when i come out
I SWEAR! I ll kill again
YOUâRE A JERK! Let me out of here and I swear I'll kill again!

OBEY!
THE ANTHEM OF VIOLENCE!
OBEY!
Thatâs the way I choose to live!

OBEY!
THE ANTHEM OF VIOLENCE!
OBEY!
Thatâs the way I choose to live!
