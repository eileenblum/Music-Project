THRASH!
Spread it cancer put them to the ground
I donât care this world shall fall now to an end
Spread it fast who cares anyway
They are all a bunch of losers and deserve this kind of fate
Spread it thrash chemical assault
Infecting with disease and spreading it out everywhere
Spread it now and show no remorse
Weâre doing world a favor as we are taking it down

Kill the world now seems the only hope
I donât care this world shall fall now to an end
No reason to exist, living like this
Things are getting worse with motherfuckers every day
Die now rot in blood
I donât care this world shall fall now to an end
Die now rot in blood
You silly group of people you deserve to fucking die

CANCER, FAST, NOW, You wonât LIVE
CANCER, FAST, I will infect your ass GOODBYE
CANCER, FAST, NOW, You wonât LIVE
CANCER, FAST, I will infect your ass GOODBYE

Spread the cancer KILL NOW
Burn the fuckers TO THE GROUND

Fuck your world, I donât care ANYMORE
Fuck them all, they wonât see another down
Now we spread the killing, cause the man succumbed to this
Now we spread the killing, cause the man succumbed to this

CANCER, FAST, NOW, You wonât LIVE
CANCER, FAST, I will infect your ass GOODBYE
CANCER, FAST, NOW, You wonât LIVE
CANCER, FAST, I will infect your ass GOODBYE

Spread the cancer KILL NOW
Burn the fuckers TO THE GROUND

Fuck your world, I donât care ANYMORE
Fuck them all, they wonât see another down
Now we spread the killing, cause the man succumbed to this
Now we spread the killing, cause the man succumbed to this
