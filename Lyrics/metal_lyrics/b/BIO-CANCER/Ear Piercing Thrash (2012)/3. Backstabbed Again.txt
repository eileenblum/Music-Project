In silence, deadly silence standing alone
Betrayed by "truthful" friends
Devastated broken hearted
It seems this life is full of pain
Blurred feelings agonize me
Dead feelings stigmatize me
Your life will be my savior
NEVER TRUST NEVER LOVE
NEVER TRUST NEVER LOVE

Backstabbed AGAIN,
Suffer by MYSELF

BACKSTABBED!

I feel darkness I feel cold
I ve been betrayed that what I was told
Violation of my trust
Violation of my confidence
I m searching for new hope
New hope to guide me on
My mind is stuck on one goal
To make you feel like i do

Backstabbed AGAIN,
Suffer by MYSELF

BACKSTABBED!

In silence, deadly silence standing alone
Betrayed by "truthful" friends
Devastated broken hearted
It seems this life is full of pain
Blurred feelings agonize me
Dead feelings stigmatize me
Your life will be my savior
NEVER TRUST NEVER LOVE
NEVER TRUST NEVER LOVE

Backstabbed AGAIN,
Suffer by MYSELF

BACKSTABBED!
