Numbered are the days of man.
Wars, rumors of, war.
Plagues, throughout, all lands.
All these precede, his return, the son of man.

Forever in, flames.
Unjust wicked.
Flaws found in all thought to be pure.
Screams, of pain.
I can see them now.
Burning in pain.
Forever in flames.

Last prophecy unfolds before your eyes.
One third of our population, dead, but no one cries.
Light from the sun, smitten, black.
All run and hide from the face of god.

Why do you run?
Why do you hide?

With one voice I am is denied.
The worms that consume your flesh shall never dieâ¦
