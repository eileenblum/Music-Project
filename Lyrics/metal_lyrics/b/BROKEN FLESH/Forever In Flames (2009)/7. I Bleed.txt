Locked away inside my pain.
One more time my flesh meets blade.
What is this lie?
Why this shame?
I cut, I bleed, but the pain remains.

I long to free your pain.
I long to give you life.
How long will you believe society's lies?
This demon longs to have control.
God has made a way for you to free your soul.

Medical prison, allowing total control.
Enemy inside while my flesh is locked alone.
To free myself I must cut flesh.
I must release this pain, before it takes me to my death.

My name is legion for we are many
In the name of Yeshua.
Father of lies, we rebuke you now.
Take your hands off this woman now, sheâs been bought, by his sacrifice.

By his sacrificeâ¦
