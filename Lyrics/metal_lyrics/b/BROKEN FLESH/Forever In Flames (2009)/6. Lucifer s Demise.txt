You were perfect in all ways.
Full of knowledge and pride.
Once you walked the garden of god.
Anointed cherub to guard the gate.

Blameless from your day of creation.
Until you were found unclean.

Thrown down to the earth no more will you walk the fiery stones.
Now you deceive the hearts of man.
Lake of fire your eternal home!!!!

Your rebellion is useless.
Your destruction, governments of man.
Armageddon is coming.
Your destruction is at hand!!!

Declaration of war is accepted.
We will triumph by the blood of the lambâ¦
