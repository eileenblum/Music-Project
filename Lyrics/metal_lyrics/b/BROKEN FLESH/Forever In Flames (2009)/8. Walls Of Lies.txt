Masquerade, hidden behind lies.
Come and see, all are welcome.
Sit and stare, everything in place.
Trapped and snared.
Become the prey

No liberty, house of wax.
What is this?
Who do you want me to be?

Blinded, truth cannot be seen.
Isolated, desperate for blood.
Final curtain drawn, see the truth, see the light.
Open your eyes

Separated cannot stand, fire dies without breath of life.
Ignite me now let me burn.

Paralyzed from the throat through the lungs.
Gasping for breath, choking on the blood.
Come from behind these curtains of lies.
Breathe life more abundantly.

Tear down these walls of lies.
The heavens are your throne.
Reunite the bride of Christ.
Make in us our home.
