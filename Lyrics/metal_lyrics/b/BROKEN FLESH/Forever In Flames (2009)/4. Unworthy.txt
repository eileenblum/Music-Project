Face the pain, ignore this fear, as life fades away, mortality.

Left behind all worldly pride, stench of death exudes on all.
Scarred inside, unwanted by man, this world hates me now.
I no longer choose to run from my fate.

Unworthy â let the blood flow

Unworthy â to follow my lord in his path of death

Unholy â my spirit before he chose me

Redeemed â in spite of my denial of his name

Let the blood flow

Let the blood flow.
Flesh is ripped from bone.
Stare into my dying eyes.
Lord please take me away.

Unworthy â let the blood flow
