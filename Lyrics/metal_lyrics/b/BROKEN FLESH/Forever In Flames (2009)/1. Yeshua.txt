Yeshua without you there is no life, father messiah into your hands I put my life, lion of the tribe of Judah.

Bloodstained bloodbought my life is yours use me now, father messiah into your hands I put my life, in the name of Yeshua the serpent crushed beneath your feet.

Worthy are you lord, all praise to your name
Yeshua Ya-masheakah, Jehovah I praise your name
