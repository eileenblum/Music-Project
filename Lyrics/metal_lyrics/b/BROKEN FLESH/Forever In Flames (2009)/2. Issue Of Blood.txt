Marching going off to war, killing everything in sight.
Pestilence as far as the eye can see.
Bondage issue of blood burns.

Plague inherent human waste, bloodshed no one could be saved.
Vengeance upon unholy flesh.
All over an issue of blood
Burns

The lord is my helper I will not fear what man can do unto me

The blood of Christ it reigns, my soul will not burn
The blood of Christ it rains, my soul will not burn
