Dark memories of a life that was. Twisted visions of a future foreseen. Lucid dreams of lives that end in misery and pain. What is real and what is lore? Trapped between reality and suffering in selfish shame, my soul is tormented beyond my strength. My enemies pick away at my sanity as vultures rip away bodies in decay. Will this torment ever end? Who can sooth my soul? Warfare I bring unto my victims in chains, as I myself become consumed by death, lashing out in anger, sealing my fate. I lie in wait for my enemies to strip the life away. My agony in this darkness, prayers go unheard. A waste of time in this unbelief. Destroying family lines. Unrelenting genocide, I become a mockery for all to see. Abba God, why have you abandoned me? Rebuked by a spirit from the grave. My kingdom of jealousy stripped away before my eyes. Reaping the death that I have sewn. Family line now lies in ruins. My seed forever wiped from the earth. Will this torment ever end? Who can sooth my soul? Warfare I bring unto my victims in chains, as I myself have become consumed by death. Consumed by death.
