Unwanted from the womb. Engulfed in hate. Trapped inside this hellish nightmare. Pleading for a lifetime of agony. Lies are told. Hidden secrets unfold unleashing hell and nothing more. Beaten, blooded, filed with shame, fear of death, darkness descends to rise again, manifested in pain. This agony too much to live. I cry out to a God unwelcome in my home. Why did I have to live? This is my hell. The pain of living with all these lies. The weight is too much to bear. Fight to live. Refuse to die. Punishment for no crime. Innocence is lost. So much scarring on the inside. Lashing out to cover up the pain. This is my hell. Unprotected by the ones inflicting all the pain. Unable to trust anyone. What is to become of me? Emotions uncontrolled, manipulated, forced to lie. As I cry out to God to save me from this pain. Inside this hell, pressure builds. I cannot hide the hate. Unprotected by the ones inflicting all the pain. Unable to trust anyone. What is to become of me? Emotions uncontrolled, manipulated, forced to lie. As I cry out to God to save me from this pain. Inside this hell, pressure builds. I cannot hide the hate. The monsters that live here with me. The demons that assault me in my sleep. This is my hell. The pain of living with all these lies. The weight is too much to bear. Fight to live. Refuse to die. Punishment for no crime. Innocence is gone. So much scarring on the inside. Lashing out to cover up the pain. This is my hell. Fight to live. Refuse to die.
