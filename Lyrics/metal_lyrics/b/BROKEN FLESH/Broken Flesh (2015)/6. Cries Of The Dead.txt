Abandoned here and left for dead
The carnage of those ive slain consume my sight
Reflections on a life of war
these sinâs stains for generations untold
Violence breeding violence
Gore breeding gore
Hate breeding hate
Spirit of death is upon me now

The bludgeoned cannot speak for me
The dead wait in vain for my time to come
Tormented soul in time of death
Cries of remorse shall go unheard

Cries of the dead cannot be heard
Cries of the dead torture my soul
The dead cry out for vengeance 
Will they cry forever 

Armies of the dead will rise again
Every wrong will be undone
All sins will break upon the heads of this generation
Bound, gagged, and cast away

Cries of the dead cannot be heard
Cries of the dead torture my soul
The dead cry out for vengeance 
Will they cry forever
