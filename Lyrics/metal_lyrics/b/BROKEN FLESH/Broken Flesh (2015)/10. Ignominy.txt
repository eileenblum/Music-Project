Welcome to my domain. Built by my hands from the arms of adultery. Void of hope. Lifeless being. Inside there is nothing. Inside there is nothing. Absence of truth as resonant as the blade that sings psalms to my skin. Beauty and love gives way to misery. Welcome to my domain. Trade veracity for secrets. Trade love for lies. This is my life in secrecy, built by my hands. Never-ending torture. Stuck beneath the heel, skewed reality of fake and of real. When suffering is all that you know, the pain is easy. Forsake your loved, spiritual deception. Abide. To turn away is to abandon all life. Sin entered through a man to reap death unto all. This is my kingdom. But I am foreign to decorum. Life comes from the One who trespass here. No longer is sorrow held dear. Name of all names, Yeshua, Messiah, bring the resurgence of me. This is my kingdom. But I am foreign to decorum. Life comes from the One who trespasses here. Forsake your love, desert intimacy. Woe is me, who has gained absolutely nothing. Jesus, save me. Built by my hands from the arms of adultery. Void of hope. Lifeless being. Inside there is nothing.

Welcome to my domain.
