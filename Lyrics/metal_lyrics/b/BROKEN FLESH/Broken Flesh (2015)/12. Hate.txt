can you see me in this hell. trapped inside and trying to escape. the voices never stop. you worthless piece of trash. my wailing pleads of sorrow fuel my hate for weakness. the bitterness never ends. 

I lay here on my back behind my fickle shield of strength. i am broken. will you help me. what is this that I have become. so far removed from what God made me to be. why do I have to live in so much pain. I try to do good since I was a child. but this internal enemy. monster inside. it kills me. molests me every night. what good is a wretch like me. broken and made cold. oh God just let me die. I stick the gun in my mouth and try to do it, but memories keep flooding in of a mother who loved her son. Abba God in heaven. I have not given up. I don't know what You see in me. but I have not stopped fighting. 

can you see me in this hell. trapped inside and trying to escape. the voices never stop. you worthless piece of trash. my wailing pleads of sorrow fuel my hate for weakness. the bitterness never ends.
