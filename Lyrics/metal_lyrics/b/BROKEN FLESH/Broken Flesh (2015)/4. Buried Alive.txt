Misery consumes me now. My life no longer free. Cast away, banished from my Father's presence. I can no longer live within this hellish prison. Banished and left to die, enemies surround me now. Countless battles. Nowhere safe for me to live in my own land. A wasted life filled with hate. Banished and left to die. Why have You brought me here? Death comes for me now. Light stricken from my sight as I descend into this dying earth. Father, Father, why have you forsaken me? In this pit of death, the anguish fills my mind. Suicidal dreams control my soul. What have I done to deserve this, beaten and bleeding, exiled in shame? Why must I die, oh Father, why must I be buried alive in this hell? Buried alive. Amputated from humankind. Wasting away into nothingness. No more hope. Father save me from this hell.
