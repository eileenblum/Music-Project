Let the reaping begin. Genocide, ethnic cleansing, to prey upon the weak. Mass graves of broken bodies in decay. Smoke ascends. Ash and bone. Let the reaping begin, begin. Now bring upon this earth judgment. A horror mankind has never known. Taught to hate our own kind, segregated by our pride, jealousy, and fear. Moral demise, social infrastructures buried in the lies. Blinded by our own greed, bred in gluttony to believe our social standing is more important than our soul. Let the reaping begin. The earth is ripe with sin, prejudice, pride, jealousy, lust and hate. Every knee will bow, every tongue confess. Mankind has no more time. Harvest of blood. Swing the blade. The earth is ripe for death. Genocide, ethnic cleansing, to prey upon the weak. Taught to hate our own kind, segregated by our pride, jealousy, and fear. Moral demise, social infrastructures buried in the lies, blinded by our own greed.
