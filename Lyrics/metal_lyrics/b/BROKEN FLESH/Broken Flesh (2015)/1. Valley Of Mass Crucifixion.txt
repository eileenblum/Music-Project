the dawn of betrayal is upon us, the air is soaked with sin. every form of blasphemy now a reality. fornication of the mutilated. living hell on earth, piles of burning human flesh. holocaust of innocence. screaming gutted children line the road to my fruition. the valley of mass crucifixion. lacerations of the flesh. the pain falls through my body. a misery that our teachings could not foresee. fall upon the alter of christian sacrifice. eviscerating. mutilated. fecal soaked misery. as my eyes fill with blood. are filled with blood. inverted. pinned. and gutted. a pain beyond belief. struggling to release a scream gurgled in blood. as I cry out to a God who has called all to suffer. please spare me from this pain. Yeshua Your mighty name has brought me here. forgive these men who do not know You. rip the flesh off my back. fulfill this drudged prophecy of death. no rapture for the righteous. cry out to a god that has promised nothing. no rapture for any living thing. 

as the blade enters my flesh. screams of torture fill the air. body carved for my allegiance. bled dry and made a mockery. as the blade enters my flesh. screams of torture fill the air. body carved for my allegiance. bled dry and made a mockery. 

in this dawn of betrayal. all hail the King who walks with me in death. who speaks peace into my ear as the blade enters my flesh. all hail the King who walks with me in death. who speaks peace into my ear as the blade enters my flesh. Father in heaven. please forgive these men who murder me. and bring unto this darkened earth the kingdom in which You reside.
