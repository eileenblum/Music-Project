Crushed beneath the heel. Fallen serpent, your time is short. Gather your nest of vipers. Witness your destruction as it unfolds. Hatred for mankind, your victims unknowingly chose to burn before you. Deceived by your brightness, false angel of light. Submit to God and resist the enemy. Rendered powerless he will flee. Time has come. Truth unfolds. The lion comes for his prey. The mighty will bow in shame. As the smoke of their torment rises forever, pride is crushed, the humble exalted. No more death. No more misery. No pain. Worthy is the Lamb. Worthy is the Lamb, who bore the weight of fallen man, from His throne to the depths of Hell. Son of Man. No more sacrifice. Worthy is the Lamb.
