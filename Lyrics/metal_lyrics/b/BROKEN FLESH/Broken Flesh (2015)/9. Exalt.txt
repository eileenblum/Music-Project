Before the founding of the world, You took my place in Hell. Your love is more than I have ever known. Hallelujah, oh sovereign King. Oh Yeshua, I praise Your name and I long for Your return. And every knee in Heaven, and every knee on earth and below the earth, shall bow to the name of Yeshua. Set a fire, my ever-weeping soul, and crush the serpent who contorts and seeks to kill me. The horrors of the unseen world must bow before You, Jesus of Nazareth. Your name above all names and our Father in Heaven who sent You. Day and night I long for Your coming back and scream unto the nations, the mighty King has returned. Before the founding of the world, You took my place in Hell. Your love is more than I have ever known. Hallelujah, oh sovereign King. Oh Yeshua, I praise Your name.
