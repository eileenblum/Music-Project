Lucifer - your pain will soon begin
Your kingdom shall fall forever!!!

Murder, lies, deceit
Abomination of the one true god
Your punishment will last forever!!!

As you're bound in chains
As you kneel before the king of kings
I am not your follower

[Bridge]
I am not your follower
I will not bow down
I am not your follower
I am here to deconstruct your kingdom

Forever!!!

As you're bound in chains
As you kneel before the king of kings
I am not your follower

I will not bow down!!!
