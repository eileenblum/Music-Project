Cursed be - the day - I was born

These boils upon my flesh
My family cursed and dead
Why do I suffer??
Why have you forsaken me

The blood pours from me now
Left to rot in my own shame
Why do I suffer??
Why have you forsaken me

Where were you when I set the stars in place
And were you there when I walked this earth
Where were you when the serpent breathed his first breath
Breathing flames that no man can tame

Where were you when I set the stars in place
And were you there when I walked this earth
I am all that I choose to be
Ancient of days, sovereign lord of all

Cursed be the day I was born
Wretched now and life of scorn
Look into my dying eyes
My only chance of redemption

[Solo]

Cursed be the day I was born
Wretched now and life of scorn
Look into my dying eyes
My only chance of redemption [2x]
