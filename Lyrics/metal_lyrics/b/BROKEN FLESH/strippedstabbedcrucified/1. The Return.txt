[Chorus]
Let your presence rain
Pour your spirit into me

[Pre-chorus]
As I bow - before your throne
Let your greatness - be magnified
As I bow - before your throne
Hallelujah - almighty god

Blood was shed - so I may live
As I long - for your return
Praise and glory - king of kings
As your spirit moves, anoint me with your love
Anxiously I wait - for your return

[Pre-chorus]
As I bow - before your throne
Let your greatness - be magnified
As I bow - before your throne
Hallelujah - almighty god

[Chorus x2]
Let your presence rain
Pour your spirit into me

Jesus is coming back
Jesus is coming back
Jesus is coming back
Jesus is coming back

Come - lord Jesus - come
Come - lord Jesus - come
