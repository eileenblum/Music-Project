Taken from innocence, taken from life
Broken away from the family ties
Predatorial demon - hunting down the prey
Vengeance will come - judgment day

Hopelessness - as the body is found
No remorse - ready to strike again
This pain inside - hatred for soullessness
Blackened rage - you will be found

You will pay for your crimes
For the innocence you stole away
For the pain you have sewn
You will reap in this life [2x]

Blood for blood - life for life - bound and gagged
This vengeance - I long to inflict - on the souls of the damned [2x]

Vengeance will not be mine
I will not be consumed by hate

Vengeance shall be done
Bow to god or meet your fate

You're a victim of your own demise
You're a victim of your own hate
You're a victim of your own demise
Bow to god or meet your fate [2x]
