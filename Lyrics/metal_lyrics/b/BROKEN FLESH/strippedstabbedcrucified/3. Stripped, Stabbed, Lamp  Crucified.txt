Suffer!!!

Waiting to die in the presence of god
You can take my life but I will live on
Killing in fear - emotion driven rage
Await my deliverance at the moment of death

Suffer!!!

As the blade plunges deep into my flesh
My breath grows shallow, consciousness fades
I stare away into a time not of this earth
Omniscient realm, a home awaiting me

The will of god must be done
My soul is to suffer
There is no easy way out of this
My flesh is to die
I will not die in vain

As this lifeless corpse
Falls before you now
Know that you have only set me free
I cry out to god
For your sins
To be forgiven
For all eternity
