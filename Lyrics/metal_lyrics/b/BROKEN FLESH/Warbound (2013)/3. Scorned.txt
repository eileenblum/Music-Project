As I have breathed my final breath, Chained within my own sin, No more time, no
second thoughts, no repentance, My misery will carry on for all time, My soul
starts to burn, This anguish is too much to bear, If only I had one more day, Trapped inside gnashing of teeth, eternal shame, I should have answered the call, My soul starts to burn, BURN - This hell feels very real, The pain does not fade away, BURN - The screams of those engulfed in flames, My own flesh melts away, BURN - This torment is too much to bear, My God why did I deny you, As I have breathed my final breath, Chained within my own sin, No more time, no second thoughts, no repentance, My misery will carry on for all time, My soul starts to burn, Oh God why did I deny you
