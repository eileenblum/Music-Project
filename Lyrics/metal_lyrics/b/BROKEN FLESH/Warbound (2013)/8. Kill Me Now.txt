Kill me now, I stand before the monument of sin that I have made, overshadowed by grief, covered in the reaching arms of lives lost in black wooded masses of hate,
destroying what is pure, I have sold myself into this pain, I am the worst among all
the putrid ones, Innocence preyed upon by spirits familiar to ancient man, To instill
this evil incarnate of lies, All moral lines dissolve in hate, Blood lust taught by
fallen ones, Deceiving man, Eternal holocaust, Reaching from despair, Unable to
absolve myself, In my selfish hate, Let me die, Let me die, Alone in my selfish hate, Here I am, Reaching from despair, Submit all my burdens before the Son of man, He is quick to dismiss them all, There is no love greater than the love of the eternal God, Glory to the exalted King of Kingâs, Yeshuah I praise your name, Let every voice of hate Towards you, my gracious God, Be crushed and overwhelmed, By the greatness of your love, Let The World See You For Who You Really Are
