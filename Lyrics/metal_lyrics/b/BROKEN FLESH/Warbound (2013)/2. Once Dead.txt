Once I was dead, Once I was dead in my sin, Self-destructive life, Boiling with anger and no self-control, Homicidal thoughts consumed my mind, Leaving me lifeless before my creator, I come in my wretched shame, Take me away, Wrapped in jealousy, Forced inside, Suicidal thoughts, Bipolar disorder, Spiritual adultery, I must escape this pain, Dead in my sin, Dead in my sin, I now stand before my God to give an account of my life, Begging and pleading to kill all the voices, Jesus I plead stop these thoughts of murder, suicide, emotional torment, Spirit of hate be gone from me, Father of all life, I now lay mine before you, In all my filth, wash me clean, I now give up this life and receive freedom from oppression, Covered in hate, wash me clean, Dead in my sin, All that I was, All my transgressions, Washed away, All praise, All glory, All merciful one
