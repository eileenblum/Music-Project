WAR - Behind enemy lines no mercy is found, WAR - Spilling blood of the enemy within, WAR - Complete carnage in a world full of hate, WAR â Total absence of peace as the nationâs rage, Battle lines are drawn, genocide at hand, who will meet me at my grave, Hate filled infrastructures, sociopathic craze, innocence is lost in chaos, Ethnic prejudice, media driven fear, as we are blinded by greed, Bred from birth into allegiance with this world, only death lies in such a vow, Misery - As the young are slaughtered, Blasphemy - Government is not God, Murder - The guilty rule the innocent, Warbound - Mankind will not escape, I see the son of man, Heâs coming in the clouds, With all His righteous ones, So stake me to the ground, And grant me my last breath, Oh mighty sovereign king
