Father, sin surrounds me now, Death takes hold of a failing world, Screams of pain, tormented souls, Lost in lies lust and greed, Death shall have no power before the light of a million sunâs, Anguish swallowed up in victory, Abba God please hear my cry, Yeshuah come again, Oh death where is your sting, All your power stole away, Adonai, your perfect will now dwells in the heart of man, Spirit of hate causing death, I bind you by the blood of the spotless Lamb of God, I bind the spirit of fear, And unleash true peace that comes from God, Open graves, new found life, Judgment day, no more lies, Darkness falls in burning flames, Heaven and earth pass away, Heaven and earth pass away
