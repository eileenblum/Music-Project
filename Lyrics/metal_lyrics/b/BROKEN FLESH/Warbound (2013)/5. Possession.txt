Spill the blood, Drink this cup, Taste His life, This meek Son shall satisfy my thirst, This drink is my blood, this feast for you is my flesh, Do this in remembrance of me, As I devour the flesh Of the son of God, Possessed by the one indwelling spirit, I feel the unseen come over me, I plea for my soul, resurrection from the dead, All that I seek is eternal life, Victory over the grave, Welcome to the nightmare of all civil life, here we consume our own, Come everyone who hears the call to breathe new life, Kneel before the slaughtered Son, displayed here for you to consume, Now exert your sharpened tongue, Disembowel yourself of filth, Wipe death from your mouth, Drink this cup, taste His life, receive the all supreme spirit, Walk in His body, where we all breathe as one, breathe as one
