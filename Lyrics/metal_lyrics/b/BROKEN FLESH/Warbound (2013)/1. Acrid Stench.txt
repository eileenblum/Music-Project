What have you gained by worshiping your man made idols, How foolish to trust in
something made by your own hands, In all realms your god betrays you, it is lifeless, cannot see, Masonary abomination, What good is an idol carved by man or cast image that deceives you, What sorrow awaits you who say to wooden idols âwake up and save usâ Wide is the path that leads to death in the hands of these false godâs, But know that all this rage is soaked with a heavy conviction for which the roots can be found in the depths of my confession, I used to be like you, obsessed and overwhelmed with lust, praising demons of plague, Now close your ears to the psalms of sin, turn your back to the evil one, for he is Lifeless inside, But the lord is holy in His temple, Let all the earth be silent before Him, And in your anger, remember your mercy, Sovereign Lord you are my strength, Now as your golden calf betrays you in your time of need, Honor the God who gives you life, Do not bow to demons of hate, Purge from your dwelling every idol made of lies, Destroy them all
