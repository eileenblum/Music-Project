False sense security you feel alive again
Your state of purity is weakened
Misdirection can cut it all away
In dissection no doubts are left to disdain

It's in the river flow
This gaining gift of pride
I'm not the fairest one
Take this home tonight

Feeling so alive
Misdirection can cut it all away
In dissection no doubts are left to disdain

It's fucking pitiful
How easy lives are dealt
Something so beautiful
With meaning so unfelt

Savior my whore goddess
Find your place on the floor
Liberation

High noon my only friend
It's finally time to drink again
No worries on this day
Together we rise
And know how we've become Poseidon
