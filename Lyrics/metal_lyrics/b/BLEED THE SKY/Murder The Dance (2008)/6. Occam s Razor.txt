This is alright
Will you ever know
Just how far you'd go?
Will you ever say to me...
This is alright

Will you take your turn?
Is your lesson learned?
Will you ever think to yourself...
This is alright

To much antidote
Just open your throat
Will you ever know you're alright
This is alright

Will you ever know
Just how far you'd go?
Will you ever pray to me?
