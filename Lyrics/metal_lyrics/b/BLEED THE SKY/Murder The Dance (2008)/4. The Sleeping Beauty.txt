Sleep now, you've got no one to face
The sin is mine alone but can I be the same

A deliberate mindfuck
Think of the trade was mastered
Step into my world for one day
To see what it's like to be a bastard

Show your crown
For you royally have failed
Stay your ground
Kindly pull away the veil
We Offer nothing more to anyone
The sleeping beauty is...

Wake up this hour can't be over
I need a chance to explain
I just signed my death warrant

Nothing can justify
What evil I've awakened
Take your gun pull the trigger
Send me to the hell I merit

Show your crown
For you royally have failed
Stay your ground
Kindly pull away the veil
We Offer nothing more to anyone
The sleeping beauty is...

We offer nothing
