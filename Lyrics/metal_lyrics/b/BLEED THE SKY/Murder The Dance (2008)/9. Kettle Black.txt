Wanna take slow but you take it hard
Nobody told me it would go this far
Fucking taking everything in sight
You are the blister that never heals
I wasn't always this green and naive
It takes years to develop
This lie you believe
Slowly work my better half
Still just as worthless as fighting death

It's all because of you
My Body's bruised
It's all because of you

Some people never learn their lesson
Lives run by the slut obsession
I guess that what I get
I didn't see it coming
The pot calls the kettle black

It's all because of you
My Body's bruised
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
My Body's bruised
It's all because of you

Heartless
My own faults are owned
Regrets
No fear lives alone
Revenge
Water from a stone
Endless
No cure to disown
In my finest hour
on this southbound quest for power
This fork in the road is reoccurring
Going into battle with no vision blurring

It's all because of you
My Body's bruised
It's all because of you
