Six days and counting on
Loving every bitter second of this train wreck
Move along, one more weakened body
On track to seek a better life
Every move is trickery in flesh
I seek a better life, I seek a better life

Tight rope
What good is a broken neck?
Knife cut
I can't remember which way works
Gun shot
Just what I need is one less eye
Last one
I guess just need more perseverance

Strengthen your callous son
This is nothing more than testing gods
Laughing your disgrace
Give them pleasure at your face
Complicating deaths design
Fuck the rest and do your time in song
I seek a better life, I seek a better life

Tight rope
What good is a broken neck?
Knife cut
I can't remember which way works
Gun shot
Just what I need is one less eye
Last one
I guess just need more perseverance

This is only the beginning
Things are much better than before
I need a second to deliver
Things are much better than before
A quicker death is a struggle
My way is nothing to the saint
I need much more than a reason
Things are much better than before

I seek a better life, I seek a better life
I seek a better life, I seek a better life
I seek a better life, I seek a better Christian
