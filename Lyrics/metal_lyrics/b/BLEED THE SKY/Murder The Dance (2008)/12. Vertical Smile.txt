Treasure this
This knife that's in your path
This wound will never heal
The curse just keeps on growing
Formulate a plan
It doesn't have to end like this
I can see when I'm not wanted anymore
Reaping the benefit of someone else's labor

Realize this goal is miniscule
Sacrificed this comfort ridicule
Realize this pain is gone, moving on
Sacrifice

Whets the use
You plan to antagonize
Think it through
The motion not the size
Take it from me
It doesn't have to end like this
I can see when I'm no longer on a throne
Time to deliver
Penance is pain when the damage is done

Realize this goal is miniscule
Sacrificed this comfort ridicule
Realize this pain is gone, moving on
Sacrifice
