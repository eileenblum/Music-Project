Walk in this crowded room
Your mind has been made up
Hunting, little girl you know
That I've got the upper hand on you

We're not so different, you're not so innocent
Everything will be just fine
Hike your legs up a bit, get your punishment
One step closer to immunity
You've got to live and learn, let the tables turn
What better way than slavery
Let your hair down, your foolish crown
This is your last bastion

You weaken me...your stare, your smile.
You'd better bring a fuck of a fight
This line is wide but it can sure be crossed
Leaving no remorse on the field
Goddamn, I've been needing this
My god, we've been needing this
Someone slap some sense into you
Before you make the same mistake

We're not so different, you're not so innocent
Everything will be just fine
Hike up your legs a bit, get your punishment
One step closer to immunity
I've seen the tables turn, you've got to live and learn
What better way than slavery
Let your hair down, feet up off the ground
This is your last bastion

Bastion

We're not so different, you're not so innocent
Everything will be just fine
Hike up your legs a bit, get your punishment
One step closer to immunity
Let your hair down, feet up off the ground
This is my last bastion

One last regret, one final remorse
