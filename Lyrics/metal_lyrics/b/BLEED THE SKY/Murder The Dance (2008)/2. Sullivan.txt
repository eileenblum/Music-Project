Take another break from faith
It means nothing without rape
These whispers behind your back
This horror was hiding in front of our faces

It seems an honest man was wrong
You failed yourself, but for how long

Do you care, do you give shit
Two lives were crushed in one single moment
You had your slave now you sleep in your grave
No longer a lead, you're far from a father

It seems an honest man was wrong
You fucked yourself, but for how long

Sullivan - I'm not my own
Sullivan - I'm not my own

Bet it was nice to be the first
You get harder with the starting burst
Once inside there is no looking back
No apology given unfucks the past

It seems an honest man was wrong
You killed yourself, but for how long

Sullivan - I'm not my own
Sullivan - I'm not my own

Sullivan - I'm not my own
Sullivan - I'm not my own
