When should I pick a new substance?
Learned to live with nothing at all
My times spent on limiting
Prayer wasted on unwanted gods
Lead the lemmings, base it on constants
Who will jump when it's time to fall?
When god came nothing was decided
No right to think, no wrong to feel

Take a look, clarify contents
One word makes a difference
Repeat carbon copy cutouts
Looking up when you should look down
Take a second dignity compounds
With the slightest hammer fall
When god came nothing was decided
No right to think, no wrong to feel

Breaking, forming, loving
Every second of this
Force-fed notion of a greater god

Say what I need in Silence
You were sent to die
Say what I need in Silence
You were sent to die
In the bottom

Try to stand
Shake it off be a man
This indifference has got to go
Shut them all out
Pay no mind it's a test
Sorting process of mice and men
In turn there is no light
At the end of this tunnel of enlightenment

When god came nothing was decided
No right to think, no wrong to feel

Say what I need in Silence
You were sent to die
Say what I need in Silence
You were sent to die
