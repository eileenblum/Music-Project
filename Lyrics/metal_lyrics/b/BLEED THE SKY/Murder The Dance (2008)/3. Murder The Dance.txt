Impressive I must admit it was to see you
Not knowing how far
Caring little about your fate
Resign your nobility
Money's all that really matters
Intuitive testament to what you believe is wrong
To what you believe is wrong

You have little choice in this matter
Heart dead but dancing still
Murder the dance you've got one more chance
For something they told you to believe in
Where would you be without your cause?
I can't believe you're all this lost
Murder the Dance, take a stand
For something you chose to believe in

This battle is told in time
No man can decide it
No more to offer them than a spec of hope
This could all be for nothing
So many take it for granted
Deceit indeed it's the wreck of the fortune
That tells the weak from the Strong

You have little choice in this matter
Heart dead but dancing still
Murder the dance you've got one more chance
For something they told you to believe in
Where would you be without your cause?
I can't believe you're all this lost
Murder the Dance, take a stand
For something you chose to believe in

You have little choice in this matter
Heart dead but dancing still
Murder the dance you've got one more chance
For something they told you to believe in
Murder the dance, Murder the Dance
Murder the dance, Murder the Dance

As I take a shot, as I take a shot
And I will burn any and everyone
Anywhere you're face motherfucking down
Rotting from the inside out
Take a stand motherfucker
