Is this the end of everything?
This is not a game
This pain this fear in solitude
Holding you under, under the flame
Praise your god, strike him
Fake him, and promise him nothing

I will see it all go down
No blood between the lines
You say it will be found
Your blood between the lines

Save your face for the killing fields
No more leading grace in you
Segregate this alliance
Holding you under, under the flame
Praise your god, strike him
Fake him, and promise him nothing

I will see it all go down
No blood between the lines
You say it will be found
Your blood between the lines

I will see it all go down
No blood between the lines
You say it will be found
Thankful for blood between the lines
The Blooded line
Thankful for blood between the lines
Will you take this all?
Depending on
