Slow Conscience
Your shade is compromised
You called it your life from the start
I saw signs of the climb
Your shade is compromised
Watch your step. Bite your tongue just be aware
Content living your life as a self taught cunt
You sit there taunting
And raving believing everything you ever told me
I see he is not a threat to me
So you can't benefit through me
First to bright light
So quick to change your mind
Calm, flawless
You hide all the truth with cries
You fold and you lie, It's no suprise
You just left me to die
Your shade is compromised
Hypocrit sell your shit to someone else
I won't live like a puppet on your shelf
You sit there taunting
And raving believing everything you ever told me
I hate me for having loved you
I hate you for having loved me
First to bright light
So quick to change your mind
My eyes stare true while you're on a leisure ride
