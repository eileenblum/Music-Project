If I fall down don't pick me up again.
You are shading the fold before you fall back, then wait back.
The shock of all the hate that holds your Halo.
Your halo, for you.
It's not a passion to follow mice and men
The crime is saving the weak but not the dead
Can't seem to find my footing Halo.
Show me, show me, show me, show me
Your halo
Hate that holds up
Your halo I'll sell you mine
Halo Your halo If I fall down you'll pick me up again
You are shading the fold before you fall back, then wait back
The shock of all the hate that holds your
Halo
Show me, show me, show me, show me
Your halo Hate that holds up Your halo
Show me, show me, show me, show me I'll sell you lies (I'll sell you lies!)
Halo I'll sell you lies!
