To dark to climb, think you see light.
No competition.
I'll hear you out, it's getting harder to find
A place you can hide.
Hatred Impatience To deep to swim, think you could drown?
Do me a favor. Don't tell me how, it's getting harder to fight.
The demon's inside.
Hatred is a virtue that civilizes everything that is fucked in this world.
Impatience is a virtue that keeps you bound to fuck up everything in This life.
You stay below (calm down)
Spit in your face (rest your head)
Deprived of life, you are extinct in my eyes.
Your heartbeat don't mean shit to me.
You can't see my fucking
Hatred is a virtue that civilizes everything that is fucked in this world.
Impatience is a virtue that keeps you bound to fuck up everything in This life.
Calm down, and rest your head.
We will be forced to kill you in the end,
kill you in the end.! Keep us alive in your death.
Keep us alive in your death.
I can see it.
Hatred is a virtue that civilizes everything that is fucked in this world.
Impatience is a virtue that keeps you bound to fuck, bound to fuck up in this world.
You're everything in your hatred.
You're everything.
You can see my fucking hate.
