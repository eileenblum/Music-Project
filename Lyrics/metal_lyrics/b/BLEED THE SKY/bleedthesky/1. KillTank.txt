Revival
Now (Your time has come)
Here (Don't turn your back now)
Clock position (Set apart by deception)
One condition (To fuck you)
Raped at birth they should have killed you motherfucker
Taken a number and stood in line
To witness your beauty in death
Silhouette of a wrongful friendship
Fuck your temple
Your God is ashamed of your life
Cloud (Held cast over your head)
Sick (Minds will try and fuck your soul eternally)
Clock position (Set apart by deception)
My one condition (To fuck you)
Learn to hide before you try to fly
Deceit I can't believe you fucking tried
I am your shadow
Fuck death we're upon you
Fuck your temple
Your God is ashamed of your life
Wash your hands of your God
Innocence of your life
Revival
You're coming apart
Step up and try again
Fuck with us for the very last time
Your life's on the line
Choose your God
Choose your God
