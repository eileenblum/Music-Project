Forgiveness is for the weak
Throw down your broken cross
Desire irrelevance
Pursuit of faith is lost
Count your blessings
For they are too few
Immortal fallen child
It's time to choose
Look in my eyes
I'm waiting for your
Paradigm in Entropy
Contortion of innocence
There's nothing you can do
Before the rain of Heaven's pain
Destroying all of you
Drown your blessings
For they are too few
Immortal fallen child
It's time to choose
Look in my eyes
I'm waiting for your
Paradigm in Entropy
Fall down, you played us with your life
This chance is something to decide
Look in my eyes
I'm waiting for your
Paradigm in Entropy
This revolution
