War... War... For power!
You stared at the broken mirror
Your heart's collecting dust
Secure that the sins are forgiven
Forgotten but still left with us
The crime is that you've failed in recognizing
The heart you broke
The life you stole.
Bow down before your master
(I sit inside with this shit inside as I)
Bow down. You're my disaster.
Pain is just the path of life you've chosen
It's nothing more than a simple slap away
Your heart, your fist, your skull
Is breaking all this, taking all this.
Cut off your nose to spite the face
My life of piss you borrow
Do I follow the God who trained the King?
Or create my own God tomorrow?
Why can't you see that you're unfaithful?
Scars and bruises hide the truth in fables.
It's time
My heart is broken down
Shine
My heart is broken
Why can't you see that you're unfaithful?
Scars and bruises hide the truth in fables.
It's You!
No more Tomorrow.
It's You!
No more Tomorrow
Fuck your Minion.
Pushing me away.
