Crawl
You're passive, you want to come in
Crawl
Walk in, walk out, breathe in, bleed out
Walk in, walk out, breathe in, bleed out, walk in, walk out
Let it all fade away
Cold because you tried, your light is shed
No one hears when you pray, only when you cry
Your light is shed
How can you take part in bloodshed, bloodshed
Our dreams contains shades of all the fucking bloodshed
Leave it all to your sin
Hiding blinding pride
Know it's all in your head
Only when you cry (Show me salvation)
How can you take part in bloodshed, bloodshed
Our dreams contains shades of all the fucking bloodshed
It's beautiful
You're up from the backside, you want to come in
Can't you see it's my time, fuck it
You're conceated, undefeated
Can't you see it's my time, no more rhetoric
That's right.
Crime, salvation
Pride, salvatio
