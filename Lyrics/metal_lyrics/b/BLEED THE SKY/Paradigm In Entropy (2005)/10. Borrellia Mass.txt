Taking the first step
Has left you all dried up
The demon has slipped
And forced you under the gun
I can't see the future.
No one can stop this
Nature's test is second-best
Give a chance to sorrow
Never faulting never feeling
It's already become this way
Never seeming that you're feeling
It's already become this fake
Into the grave. You're my demotivation
Take me to the place where I should fall
That's where you want to see it all
Send me home you know I need it all
That's where you watch it all
Never faulting never feeling
It's already become this way
Never seeming that you're feeling
It's already become this fake
Take my life, I hand it over
You will use it for your gain
Never seeming that you're feeling
It's already become this fake
You Fuck (What a failure)
To us all, to us all you've failed
Your vice, your lies, your temptation is gone
It's your time to fall. You're my demotivation
Take me to the place where I should fall
That's where you want to see it all
Send me home you know I need it all
That's where you watch it all
First in line to taste the wine before the finish
Gets demotivation
Last in line to beat the blind, enjoy the finish
Gets demotivation
Down.
