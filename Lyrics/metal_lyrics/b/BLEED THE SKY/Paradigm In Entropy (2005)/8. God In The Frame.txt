Show no serenity
For medicating thoughts of a real life
Beyond the ruins lies our victory just out of reach
Forgotten saviour
Nothing could purify your actions
Nothing to prove (nothing to prove)
Betrayal left you out in the frame
We seem suprised at the nature of man
When all along, we were there to lend a helping hand
No more will I wake up feeling empty and dead
Make reason of your lies and carry you up instead
The sole survivors
Will try to resurrect broken thoughts
Before the dream is complete I see you sifting through the ashes
I need more time
I ask of you nothing more than freedom
From you chains (my life will change)
Into intuitive reasoning
We seem suprised at the nature of man
When all along, we were there to lend a helping hand
No more will I wake up feeling empty and dead
Make reason of your lies and carry you up instead
You take too long to pray
You wait too long today
Too long to today
As you wait for acceptance
Your shit in life, you sellout all your pride
For the God in the Frame.
