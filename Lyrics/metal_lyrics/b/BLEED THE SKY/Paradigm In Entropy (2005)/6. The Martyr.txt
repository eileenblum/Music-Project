I see you in bed again
So worthy of being hated
You're dreaming all this time
You've torn out my heart again
So easy to be misleaded
For thinking this was right
We've done this many times
No more. Fuck off take it. There is no God
We would've engaged by now
There is no God, only me
In serving out your life you will see light
You see the martyr and it's harder so you fallout into grace
No room for the tears again
You suffer, you've been mistreated
In my eyes you're a creature
You're tasting the limes again
Misery will follow
Too late for feeling sorry
In serving out your life you will see light
You see the martyr and it's harder so you fallout into grace
I've got one simple question
How many times will this cloud fall?
Until there's no reason.
Follow me out
You try to swallow
In serving out your life you will see light
You see the martyr and it's harder so you fallout into grace
It's your Christ again
Is your Christ a friend?
Follow. No more
There is no reasoning behind this
All the suffering keeps me stumbling
There is no reason behind this
For all this pain that's still around
Pain that's still around
There is no God, only me.
