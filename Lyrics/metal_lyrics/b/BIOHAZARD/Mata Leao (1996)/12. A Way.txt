The sun is shining, but I don't know if it'll shine again,
The sky is clear now, but the clouds wait overhead,
The wind stopped blowing, but I see the trees are flowing,
The water's calm now feel the undertow towing me down,
towing me down.

The sun's gone down now behind the dark clouds looming,
Birds stop singing, silence so soothing,
Dark clouds open up, I hold my rain-soaked head,
Thoughts are racing by, I scream and wish that I was dead,
I wish that I was dead.

Gotta find a way in this world to cope,
Gotta find a place in this world with hope.

Gotta find a way to keep my head straight another day
I pray to let go of hate I break myself away from my mind,
I search for inner peace I never find.
