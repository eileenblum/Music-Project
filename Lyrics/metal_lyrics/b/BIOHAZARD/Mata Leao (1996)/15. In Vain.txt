Feel the warmth of the flame as it burns inside,
Burning high and higher pressure starts to climb,
Turning passion into sweat, Jekyll into Hyde,
Glossy eyed, unsatisfied, I can't help but deny,
As my love gets set aside,
As my love gets set aside,
Magnified by hate inside.

Face down upon the ground,
Lookin' down at her, you start to frown,
Thinking to yourself,
"Am I insane to do the things I do to her in vain?"

Woman beater with your hands wrapped around her neck,
Deranged, demented, a psycho-social wreck,
Your self-denial, hatred got to keep it in check,
You rape for love and you kill for respect.
