Monday yawning school's so boring,
Or go to work like a jerk and end up snoring,
Tuesday's mail never fails,
Collection agency wants me in jail,
Wednesday's rules got me ignoring deploring,
my tensions roaring,
Thursday same shit different day,
But these motherfucking rules will never ever go away.

Fuck the rules.

Friday night gonna be out of sight,
If you're 21 they say drinking might be fun,
On Saturday Bible says seventh day,
The day of rest so have it your way,
Go for a ride keep it under 55,
Respect the Badge don't drink and drive,
On Sunday gotta survive these fascist fools,
Take your freedom back from the bullshit rules.

Call me paranoid call me what you will I got a fucking feeling
something big is going down.
