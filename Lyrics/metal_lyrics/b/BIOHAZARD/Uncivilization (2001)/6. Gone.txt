[Feat. Igor Cavalera of Sepultura]

[Chorus:]
You keep me down, I don't need you no more
Bad feelings gone, you can't hurt me no more
I've spent most of my life fucking around
Now it's getting me too down
It's a waste of my time hangin here
It's too late to change me

[Chorus]

I'm set in my own ways,
Life's too short to worry about your say
I'm at the end of my rope when I'm with you
I don't think I'll make amends
When you get outta my light,
It's too bad that I won't miss you
Now it's time I move on with my life
I doubt I will say amen

I'm set in my ways, it's my way to live the way I love to live my life
My choice to live my life
My choice to live my life
But my life is short, it's coming to an end
I doubt I'll make amends, I doubt I'll say amen...

I'll never make amends, I'll never say amen...

[Chorus]
