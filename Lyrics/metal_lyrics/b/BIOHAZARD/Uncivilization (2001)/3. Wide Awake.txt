Pain inside me is taking over again
Wide awake I open my eyes into a nightmare of a life that I despise I gotta,
break it down to the bare essentials 'cause life's too short to be sentimental.
Twisting around inside my head so many crazy visions - am I better off dead?
Filled with dread - gun under the bed to clip all the motherfuckers trying
to keep me down, I ain't fuckin' around.
Wide awake my eyes are open I can't breathe my heart is choking and I can't speak
the words unspoken and I can't believe my life is broken again... (my life is broken)

Keep trying to tell myself "everything will be OK, everything will go my way"
'till life steps in and slaps on the strangle, tears flow and fists start to mangle.
I wake up screaming everyday, nobody pays attention when I'm writhing in pain,
I got a glitch in my brain I gotta break free from anxiety, I gotta let go of life
'cause it's killing me

[Chorus:]
Wide awake my eyes are open I can't breathe my heart is choking and I can't speak
the words unspoken and I can't believe my life is broken again...
My eyes are open, my heart is choking, on words unspoken, my life is broken again

I can't believe my life is broken apart again, I can't conceive my time was never
well spent, sick of everybody talking about the things they never do, motherfuckers
talking shit about who?
YOU!!
[Lead]

Pain inside me is taking over again

[Chorus]

How many times can you ask for a chance and expect everybody to keep giving it,
forgiving it?
Realize this is the last time to waste away, deteriorate, decompose, and decline
