So many times I've been lied to, blind to
The ways of the world I've been lied to, blind to
I never understand how this master plan speaking man to man
Could ever give a damn
Hypocritical stance don't make me piss in my pants
You never care unless there's money to make
I'll never sacrifice, I got no time in my life
To fuck around with something that I know is fake
You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

You never understand exactly what kind of man that I am
'till you wear my shoes
You think I envy your life but you never realize I always live the way that I choose
Feel so much regret but you never let
That make you live the truth
You point fingers and lie, the harsh truth you deny
Life is a game that you don't want to lose

You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

and be the one you disrespect and lie to
the one you really want to live your life through
the soul you sell is really your own
because I'm the only one you can never lie to

[Chorus:]
Sellout-you want to sell your soul
Sellout-you want to take control
Sellout-you want to play that role
Sellout-I'll never sell my soul

Sellout-sell your soul [x2]
[Lead]
Sellout-sell your soul [x2]

Since back in the day, I've been up in this game
Doing much of the same way, real, I never did it for fame or glory
For all these years, with no respect from my peers
I kept it real and told my story
Sellout-This shit is real and I can never be fake
I'll do whatever it takes within reason
Sellout-Made so many mistakes, never caught any breaks
I live and die for whatever I believe in

Sellout-You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul
and be the one you disrespect and lie to
the one you really want to live your life through
the soul you sell is really your own
because I'm the only one you can never lie to

[Chorus]
