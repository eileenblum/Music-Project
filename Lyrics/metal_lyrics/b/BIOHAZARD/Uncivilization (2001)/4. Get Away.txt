I believe that when you're free you're never free, if you can't see
-I can never breathe easily- and I pray everyday, religiously, for freedom,
from this life in agony

[Chorus:]
Get away can't get away, I can't get away from you

So I wait and watch in fear of the memory of my life's tragic end in misery and
I prey everyday for salvation - for a reason, to suffer this suffocation...

[Chorus]

[Lead]

Every moment I feel is agony, every breath I take is choking me, every thought I have
just fucks with me, will it take my death to break my soul free?

Can you feel my torment can you feel my anger can you feel the misery, all around me?

I'm alone and out of touch with what is real because no one can ever feel the way I feel
and I prey to stop the voices in my head forever, I feel so violated

[Chorus]
