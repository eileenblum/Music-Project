[Feat. Phil Anselmo of Pantera]

[Chorus:]
Hate, fuck , fight, kill
We teach our children how to act in this world by living what they see on TV.
Murder, rape war, disease, the rules of society

[Chorus]

A race of murderers with no remorse and no respect for humanity,
We wonder why our children kill hate and lie, with no responsibility

[Chorus]

Take it back yo you better listen-I'm on a mission, I'll tell you what your missin,
It's time to start living in reality so fuck the world before the world fucks me
Fuck the world for fuckin me

[Lead]

We live so many days of our selfish live making money by whatever means
For sex, drugs, our sadistic needs we live and die so selfishly

[Chorus]
