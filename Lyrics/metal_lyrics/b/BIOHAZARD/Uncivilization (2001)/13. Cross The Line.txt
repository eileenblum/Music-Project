[Feat. Peter Steele of Type O Negative]

The fires of hate burn deep inside
You swear it's the truth, but I know you lied
I never thought that you would try to take me, ...break me
For all the years of pain and tears
Where you preyed upon my biggest fears
You didn't really think I could forgive you??? Did you???
I did what I thought a man should do
But looking back, I'm glad we're through
You took and took from me till I was broken,
With selfish ways you've made you bed
I think of you as if you're dead
You held me back for years but now its over

You didn't really think I could forgive you? Did you?

All my love has turned to hate
You've crossed the line, now it's too late
Accept your fate
