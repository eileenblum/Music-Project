The taste of blood erases all the guilt
Tear down the walls and all that was built
As history repeats we kill without thought
Do onto others is what we're taught 
I can't go on I'm losing my faith
Lost all hope in the human race
Walking tall, kill or be killed
Stronger than ever we will rebuild 
Scavenging for something more
Something wordth me dying for
All is fair in love and war
We will avenge and even the score 
Kill, Kill or be killed
Revenge evens the score
Death for a cause
Live for nothing more 
We gotta stand up and fight, let's ignite
We gotta put our shit behind us, it's time to unite
Like dynamite we'll explode andd take back what is ours
And never let them win again, die you fucking cowards
