I welcomed you with open arms
To share my pride and glory
You said you searched for a better life
At least that was your story
You caught me off guard with your deception
And now I'm just seeing red
I rid this world of your fucking infection
Never forgive, never forget 
Never forgive, never forget
Eye for an eye, life or death
Never forgive, never forget
Kill or be killed with no regret 
I am justice and I am the law
Excectioner, judge and jury
You preyed on human tragic flaw
But now you face my fury
A favor to the world, I erase your life
Covered in blood I dance to your death
For crimes against humanity, I'll finish the fight
Never forgive, never forget 
Now it's killing time, vengeance is mine 
You're the lowest form of fucking life
I dare even call you human
My heart breeds hatred, terror and spite 
My revenge will be your ruin
May your family die a thousand deaths
No remorse, no idol threats
Clock strikes twelve, I take my respect
Never forgive, never forget
