I'm living on hallowed ground 
Right before my eyes the darkened skies hide muffeled cries
Right before my eyes the hidden lies disguised as new york died
Right before my eyes propaganda flies 
You can run but you can't hide 
Right before my eyes politicians lied to save their hide
Right before my eyes ny cried way, everybody died
Refuse to deny, here come the lies 
I'm living on hallowed ground 
Right before my eyes, ignore the cries
Millions wonder why right before my eyes
Justify the cries of those crucified
Instead you lie, you ignore their cries 
Fullfill the prophecy and kill the enemy
Agree or disagree, where lies our destiny?
Enemy, an effigy
History for all to see
Infany, irony
Misery loves loyalty 
Never forgive, never forget
