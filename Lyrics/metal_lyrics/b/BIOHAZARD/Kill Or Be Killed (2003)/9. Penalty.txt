What's inside my state of mind, can you deal with reality?
Who pays the price for hating, who decides our final fate?
Can you reall trust the government, can you really believe the truth?
Will you die for what you believe or will you suffer like a fool? 
Sacrifice, penalty
You gave your life
And paid the price of hate 
Is there anyone you can count on when it's time to do things right?
Or are these people just fucking maggots sucking you for all your life?
Who looks out for our best interests, who cares about their fellow man?
Or are we all just fucking animals fucking each other anytime we can? 
Who's gonna beg for mercy
When the time to fight back comes
Get down on bended knee and pray
For our salvation
