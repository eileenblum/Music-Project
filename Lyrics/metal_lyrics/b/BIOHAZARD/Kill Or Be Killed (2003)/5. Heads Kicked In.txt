The cold winds of war, numb the nations soul
They taste the bitter fear as a grim future appears 
Criminal leaders building hate
Under siege the world segregates
The day has come, the end is at hand
The earth a corpse, a barren waste land
Cower in fear, humanity prays
Blood upon, our final days 
No god can grant any salvation
There's no escaping incineration 
Bound and tortured, heads kicked in
Children slaughtered, heads kicked in
Nations ruptured, heads kicked in
Lives aborted, heads kicked in 
In this world terror reigns supreme
The earth a carcass with its bones picked clean
Inpending doom, too little too late
Clenched inside the fist of fate
With savage bloodlust, we feed on the kill
Self destruction, our only true skill
Will our children ever get a clean slate
Barbaric society, united in hate 
The charred remains of war machines
The lifeless twisted bodies
Blind eyes that peer from their heads
The crowded carraiges of the dead
