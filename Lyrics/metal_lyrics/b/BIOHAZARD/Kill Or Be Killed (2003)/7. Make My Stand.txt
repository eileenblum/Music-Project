You want to break me down every fuckin day of your miserable life,
You try to take away everything, everything from me
Beaten down by society, torn apart by humanity
There's no way out of this misery
I'll fight forever fearlessly 
You can take away the weapon from my hand
But you can never change who I am
Make my stand 
Control the money, control the people
The kind of the wasteland rules
The power to conquer a dying nation lies in the hands of a fool
To give your life in the name of a cause only feeds the fire fuel
As god screams, he moans in regret
Is vengence so fucking cruel 
I have seen the way you've wrecked my fellow man
So I gotta fight to save myself
Make my stand 
The time has come to destroy anyone
That tries to stop me, my fight has just begun 
Motherfucker you could never ever step to me
I too will die for what I believe
Come out of the shadows and show your fucking face 
You half a man
Step up and face me toe to toe
Knowledge and power blow for blow
You're a liar, a coward, a thief and a fool
Now I make my stand
