Beaten senseless in everyway
Life dissappears, get's blown away
New world chaos in disarray
A second to die and forever to pray 
The time has come to push to fight, to die, to live
This time I take the fall
Don't sort them out just kill them all
Just never push my back against the wall 
Beaten senseless, violent relentless
No hope defenseless, beaten senseless 
Now you pushed me over the edge
Can't take it no more, I'm seeing red
Beaten senseless over the head
Never gonna stop until your all fucking dead 
Vengeance is my only thought
Rage, abuse, the wars I've fought
Self preservation is self taught
Turn your back and you'll be caught 
Crushing pain intensity a violent beating senselessly so cruel, agony
Broken spirit, broken home, a broken man who can not cope with pain, misery
