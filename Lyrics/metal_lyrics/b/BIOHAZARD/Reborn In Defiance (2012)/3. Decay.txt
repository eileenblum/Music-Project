WE SYPHON EARTHS BLOOD
AND DRAIN IT INTO HER SEAS
ALL IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS
MISGUIDED OPPORTUNITY
THIS WORLD WE LIVE IN TOGETHER
GETS DIRTIER EVERYDAY
EVERYTHING WE MAKE WE THROW OUT,
RECYCLE OR WASTES AWAY

DECAY, FALLING INTO DECAY
EACHDAY, SACRED WORLD WASTE AWAY

NOT ANOTHER DAY GOES BY
WE DESTROY OUR HOME
IS THIS A SIGN OF THE TIMES WE'RE IN
OR IS THIS THE FALL OF ROME
AS WE COLLAPSE, POLITICIANS LIE
GET FAT, GET RICHER AS THEY WATCH US DIE
STAND BY, WATCH IT FROM THE SIDELINES, FUCK NO
DON'T DO IT, FIGHT THEM FROM THE INSIDE

DECAY, FALLING INTO DECAY
EACHDAY, SACRED WORLD WASTE AWAY

COLLAPSING SYSTEM,
DECLINING MORAL VALUE
SOCIAL BREAK DOWN,
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO?
DOWNTRODDEN MASSES STRUGGLE
TOGETHER IN UNITY
IS THIS THE END OF OUR LIVES AS WE KNOW
BURNING HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY

DECAY, FALLING INTO DECAY
EACHDAY, SACRED WORLD WASTE AWAY
