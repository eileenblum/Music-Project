YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME FUCK YOU
AND THE LIES YOU HIDE BEHIND AND JUDGE
THE EMPTY PROMISES OF JUSTICE
WHO HOLDS A GRUDGE
I FIGHT FOR MINE, FOR WHAT I BELIEVE

IN A WORLD OF PAIN, YOU CAN NEVER CONCEIVE
CUZ YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE TRUTH
THAT YOU, CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH

ALL YOUR LIFE AND ALL YOUR DAYS,
YOU ARE NEVER GONNA CHANGE YOUR WAYS
I'M NEVER GONNA REST UNTIL YOU PAY,
VENGEANCE IS MINE

ITâS MY VENDETTA MY WAR
MY RAGE EXPLODES ON YOU FULL FORCE
TIMES UP, THERE'S NO REGRET AND NO REMORSE
MY LIFE, MY WAY, MY FAMILY
THE TASTE OF BLOOD IS WHAT I CRAVE
WHAT'S RIGHT, WHAT'S WRONG, WHAT YOU DID TO ME
I TAKE MY VENGEANCE, TO YOUR GRAVE

ALL YOUR LIFE AND ALL YOUR DAYS,
YOU ARE NEVER GONNA CHANGE YOUR WAYS
I'M NEVER GONNA REST UNTIL YOU PAY,
VENGEANCE IS MINE

YOUR ACTIONS BRING FORTH MY RAGE
VENDETTA - GOING TO THE GRAVE
MY JUSTICE - WILL COME IN TIME
VENGEANCE IS MINE
