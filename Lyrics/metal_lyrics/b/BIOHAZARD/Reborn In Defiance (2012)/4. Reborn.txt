Today's the day to make amends
For all the mistakes I've made
It never ends, it never ends.

By lying if I said I had no regrets
The pain inside my heart
Never forgets, never forgets.

[2x]
From sickness I am torn,
Through suffering reborn
No compassion, no control,
Only black inside my soul.

One more time, maybe the last,
Give me one more shot,
Another chance,
Just one more chance.

Before I die I need to say,
I'm letting go of all the pain
And rage inside my head.

[2x]
From sickness I am torn,
Through suffering reborn
No compassion, no control,
Only black inside my soul.

The world has become so negative.
It's live and let die, never forgive
Been there myself,
I feel your pain,
But the moment you give in you seal your fate

I can never deny my lies
Release the shame
And pain rotting in my soul
Forgive the errors of my ways
Forgive myself for letting go
Of all the black inside my soul

Shatter my world
It's so effortless
The realization left me breathless
Been down so long,
I forgot the truth
When you hate yourself
You're always gonna lose.

So long I suffered out of control
The darkness would never allow me to ever let go, never let go

Now I see life a different way,
The most important
Friends and family never betray.

[2x]
From sickness I am torn,
Through suffering reborn
No compassion, no control,
Only black inside my soul.
