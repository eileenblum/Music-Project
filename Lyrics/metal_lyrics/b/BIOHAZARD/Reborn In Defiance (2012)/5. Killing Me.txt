LIFE IS HARD, BELIEVE ME I KNOW IT'S TRUE
ALWAYS FIGHTING BACK THE PAIN, I'M BREAKING THROUGH
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP, MY HEART REMAINS TRUE
IT'S ALL I CAN DO
RECOGNIZE THE PAIN THAT LIES INSIDE
IT'S ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE TO HIDE
YOUR SOUL IS EMPTY, YOUR MIND IS TERRORIZED
AND FULL OF LIES

AND I GOTTA TAKE MYSELF AWAY
I GOTTA BREAK MYSELF AWAY FROM YOU
AND YOUR DISEASE, IT'S KILLING ME

I REMEMBER HOW IT FELT TO BE ALONE
YOU WOULD RUN AWAY, YOU'RE NEVER COMING HOME
BLOODY KNUCKLES AND SO MANY BROKEN BONES
NOW YOU'RE ALONE
IT'S SO HARD TO FEEL YOU'RE PART OF ME
I KNOW DEEP INSIDE YOU NEVER MEANT TO BE
SOMEONE WHO WOULD HURT HIS FAMILY
HOW CAN IT BE

AND I GOTTA TAKE MYSELF AWAY
I GOTTA BREAK MYSELF AWAY FROM YOU
AND YOUR DISEASE, IT'S KILLING ME

PLEASE I'M SO MAD INSIDE, I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
'CAUSE I GOTTA LET YOU KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE OF ME
PLEASE I'M SO SCARED INSIDE, I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME
'CAUSE I GOTTA LET YOU KNOW WHAT'S INSIDE OF ME

AND I GOTTA TAKE MYSELF AWAY
I GOTTA BREAK MYSELF AWAY FROM YOU
AND YOUR DISEASE, IT'S KILLING ME
IT'S KILLING ME, IT'S KILLING ME
