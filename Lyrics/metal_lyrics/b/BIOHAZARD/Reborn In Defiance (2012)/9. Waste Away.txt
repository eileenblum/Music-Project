FUCK THAT, THIS SHIT AINT OVER TIL WE SAY IT'S THROUGH
THIS THING OF OURS IS INSIDE US THROUGH AND TRUE
AND WE'LL NEVER SURRENDER,
THERE'S NO MORE TIME, IT'S NOT TOO LATE
ARMY OF MILLIONS GOT OUR BACK TIL THE END
FUCK ENEMIES, WE MUST RELY ON TRUE FRIENDS
BUT I REFUSE TO SAVE YOU
IF YOU WASTE YOUR LIFE ON FOOLISH HATE

NO TIME TO LET THIS WASTE AWAY - ONE LIFE,
DON'T LET IT SLIP AWAY NO TIME TO LET THIS WASTE AWAY
DON'T LET IT SLIP AWAY DON'T THROW IT ALL AWAY AGAIN

THE TIME IS NOW TO LIVE EACH DAY LIKE OUR LAST
CUZ TIME IS FLEETING AND WE MIGHT DIE REAL FAST
AND WITHOUT EACH OTHER LIFE CAN'T BE THE SAME
WE STAND TOGETHER WITH OUR BACKS AGAINST THE WALL
WE FIGHT EACH OTHER, IN THE END WE FIGHT THEM ALL
THIS IS WHAT WE STAND FOR, TOGETHER UNTIL THE VERY END

NO TIME TO LET THIS WASTE AWAY - ONE LIFE,
DON'T LET IT SLIP AWAY NO TIME TO LET THIS WASTE AWAY
DON'T LET IT SLIP AWAY DON'T THROW IT ALL AWAY AGAIN

WE'RE BROKEN, THEREâS NO HOPING, NO CURE NO REMEDY
FOR THIS ILLNESS, FOR THIS DISTRESS,
FOR THIS PAINFUL MEMORY
I THOUGHT I NEEDED YOU TO MAKE ME FEEL SO PAINFULLY
YOU KILLED ME SO SLOWLY, HURT ME MALICIOUSLY
BUT I LOVED YOU,
NOW I HATE YOU FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DID TO ME
AND I PRAY THAT ONE DAY SOON,
I GET BACK WHAT YOU TOOK AWAY FROM ME

LOOK INSIDE AND YOU WILL SEE, THE PAIN INSIDE AND MY MISERY
THE WAY YOU WASTED OUR PRECIOUS TIME,
IT BLOWS MY MIND AND FUCKS ME UP INSIDE
THE WAY YOU WASTED OUR PRECIOUS TIME,
IT BLOWS MY MIND AND FUCKS ME UP INSIDE

NO TIME TO LET THIS WASTE AWAY - ONE LIFE,
DON'T LET IT SLIP AWAY NO TIME TO LET THIS WASTE AWAY 
DON'T LET IT SLIP AWAY DON'T THROW IT ALL AWAY AGAIN
