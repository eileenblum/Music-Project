IN MY DARKEST DAYS IN MY FITS OF RAGE
NO REGARD FOR LIFE ALL ALONE IN A KNIFE FIGHT
AN INNER BEAST WOULD NEVER LET ME FIND PEACE
WITH MORBID VISIONS INFLICTING INCISIONS
I SWORE TO USE MY FISTS TIL I SLASHED MY WRISTS
I WELCOMED DEATH MOST NIGHTS
BUT HAD TO SETTLE MY SCORES RIGHT
ALL THAT I COULD FEEL WAS GRIEF AND PAIN
I DESIRED MY DESTRUCTION - I WAS GOING INSANE
FROM THE MISERABLE DEPTHS OF A FADED SOUL
SPILLED THE VOWS OR REDEMPTION - IN A WORLD SO COLD
BEFORE I THREW IT ALL AWAY
I'D MAKE MOTHER FUCKERS PAY
I WOULDN'T GO OUT WITHOUT ONE LAST BOUT

KEEP RUNNING AWAY - FOR MY SOUL I PRAY
REDEMPTION DECLARED - ON MY SOUL I SWEAR

WILL I EVER TRULY REST IN PEACE?
MY LIFE WAS A BATTLE THAT WOULD NEVER CEASE
AT WAR WITH MYSELF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS
MY LIFE MY BELIEF THE PAIN NEVER ENDS
NOW ITS TOO LATE TO EVER MAKE A CHANGE
THIS NEGATIVITY HAS GOT ME FUCKING DERANGED
LIVING THIS LIFE ALWAYS FELT SO STRANGE
BUT DEATH IS FOREVER BURNING IN FLAMES

KEEP RUNNING AWAY - FOR MY SOUL I PRAY
REDEMPTION DECLARED - ON MY SOUL I SWEAR

NO LIFE WAS WASTED 'CAUSE I MADE MY PEACE
DON'T SHED NO TEARS FOR ME
MY SOUL HAS BEEN RELEASED
ENEMY TO THE WORLD MYSELF AND ALL OTHERS
THERE IS NO LIFE MY SICKNESS SMOTHERS
I FEEL SOMETIMES LIKE LIFE DID ME WRONG
SEEKING REVENGE SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN

KEEP RUNNING AWAY - FOR MY SOUL I PRAY
REDEMPTION DECLARED - ON MY SOUL I SWEAR
