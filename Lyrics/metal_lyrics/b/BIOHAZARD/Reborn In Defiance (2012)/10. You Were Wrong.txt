YOU WERE WRONG

FOR SO LONG, AN EMPTY CANVAS,
FILLED NOW WITH ALL THE PAIN INSIDE, INSIDE
AND I SWEAR I STILL REMEMBER
LOOKING THROUGH THE HOLE
INSIDE MY MIND, MY MIND

BUT YOU WERE WRONG
I DON'T CARE, NO MORE
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
I CLOSED THAT DOOR

YOU WERE THE FIRST TO BE
SO CLOSE INSIDE
OF ME AND MY DISGUISE, DISGUISE
BUT NOW I RECOGNIZE
THE TRUTH YOU SEEK
IS ALL THAT I DESPISE, DESPISE

BUT YOU WERE WRONG
I DON'T CARE, NO MORE
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
I CLOSED THAT DOOR

STABBED ME IN THE BACK
LOOKED ME IN THE EYE
LIED TO MY FACE, DISGRACE
INSIDE OF ME HAS DIED

ONCE TOGETHER NOW SEPARATE
THE LOVE AND HATE
INSIDE OF ME JUST DIES, IT DIES
SO NOW I HOLD MY HEAD UP HIGH
SOME DAY, YOU'LL FINALLY REALIZE, ALL YOUR LIES

BUT YOU WERE WRONG
I DON'T CARE, NO MORE
IT'S BEEN SO LONG
I CLOSED THAT DOOR
