I sit and pick my brain each night
With an axe in my hand held tight
Bity my nose to spite my face
Killing myself, I can't escape the rat race
Wallowing in neck-deep misery
Quicksand dissent, pressure free
Deepest wounds are self inflicted
Should I hope to be vincited

Always alone, society's abortion
Self mutilation, the daily partion
Resentful past breeds hopeful future
With tears of blood, I remove the sutures

Dying inside, emotions they hide
Irreperable damage from the tears that I've cried
I climb from the sewer, the years that I have
spent
Self mutilation or my environment

[Chorus 2x:]

Tears of Blood, Tears of Blood
I cry, I cry
Tears of Blood, Tears of Blood
I die

Deny myself for fear of being
Is it over now, has my heart stopped beating
Lying here just self defeating
My mind is empty, it won't stop bleeding
Twisted anger screams my brain
Over the edge, I hang in pain
Mouth locked shut my mind won't swallow
With tears of blood alone I wallow

No one to blame except myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Maybe its just a matter of pride
Too sweet to end with suicide

Peel the scub, pour salt in the wound
Torturing myself, I'm forever doomed
Looking east and west each and every moon
A peaceful rest comes somebody soon

No one to blame expect myself
What you call masochism I call wealth
Is death life and do we live in hell?

[Chorus 3x / Lead]
