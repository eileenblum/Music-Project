Looking through these bars and wondering why I'm here
Accused of a crime I did not commit and the police make nothing
clear
Stipped of my rights by the words of another
Locked in a cell with my victimized brothers
In this country, the land of the free
I'm an innocent man arrested guilty

I stand accused, innocent of the crime
Not yet been sentenced but I'm already doing time

[Chorus:]

Mistaken identity, handcuffed face down
Mistaken identity, my freedom gagged and bound

Surrounded by convicted felons, locked down in this cell
What did I ver do to earn this living hell

Busted by cops in need of a collar
Eating donuts four to twelve to earn their dollar
In this country, the land of the free
I am an innocent man arrested guilty

The criminal justice system plagued with dishonesty
They should judge themselves instead of crucifying me

[Chorus]

A pussy power trip throw me in the joint
I feel sorry for you because you're missing the point
You picked the wrong motherfucker and followed it through
Let the hammer of injustice fall on you

[Lead]

You have right to remain silent
Was the bullshit that he said
Put your hands where I can see them
Make one move and you're dead

[Chorus]

To fill a quota and treat my life
Like  a number or a statistic
Make once innocent youth outraged
Angry and ballistic

[Chorus 2x]
