I make now a stand for belief that I'm steadfast
In hating all of the bullshit you give me doubt my future, present and past
Who are you to infringe your values upon me, I've learned the hard way
Stepping on my toes, you've put my back to the wall, my back to the wall

I've been told a thousand times to give respect when  due
Why do you find it so hard to believe I've got none for you
It's my heart and my mind that I'll always follow, I will not break
Nor will my balls, altough that I've seen that you've tried
before
Why are people fake?

[Chorus:]

Maybe you're older,  wiser on your own right, it's your mistake
I'm gonna do my own thing regardless, my choice to make
I am real, in touch with my feelings, and I know my place
You have shown, on the other hand, both sides of your face

I see the world in a different light
Things not always black and white
Through all these years still, to this day
My hardened eyes see only shades of grey

I would never try and tell you what was right from wrong
Maybe that's why you feel that I don't belong
Always put me down for things I've said and done
Can't you see it's a war that can't be won

[Lead]

A war that can't be won

Living in your world seems so clear and concise
Shutting out reality makes everything so nice
Paint a pretty picture black and white everyday
See my tattered canvass bleedign shades of grey

[Chorus]
