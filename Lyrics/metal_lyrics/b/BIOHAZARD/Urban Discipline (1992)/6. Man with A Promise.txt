A man with a promise smashes down my door
He sees a future with me, he's gonna give me more
"Give me all your trust, I'msure you won't regret
Just sign the dotted line, and I'll do so the rest"
He says I can't make it alone, not without him
But I've always been on my own, he doesn't know who I am
And now I'm starting  to see just what you are to me
A parasitic leech of my life

[Pre-chorus:]

You feed off the art that I bleed
You're a man with a promise but you ain't shit to me

A man broke his promise and he wants reparations
He sold me up the river, cause me grief and frustration
I gave him all my trust and got stabbed in the back
A lucky motherfucker that he hasn't yet been whacked
You ain't no fucking artist, spend your life exploiting others
Try all you want, you can't break me or my brothers
A business man vulture,no honor, no class
Take your money and your lawyers and shove 'em up your ass

[Pre-chorus II:]

You feed off the art that I bleed
Numbers to you is just pain to me

[Chorus:]

Now the tables are turned
Can't you see motherfucker that you've been burned
You're a man with a promise but  you ain't shit to me
You ain't shit to me

[Lead]

[Pre-chorus II]

[Chorus]
