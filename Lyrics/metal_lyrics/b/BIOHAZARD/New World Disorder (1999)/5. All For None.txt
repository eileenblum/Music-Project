I said I'd stand with you forever if you needed me
Help, arm in arm, hand over fist and carry you where necessary
like a fool I thought we'd walk tall forever all as one
When the going got tough you stopped pushing and turned to run.

I tried so hard, so sad to watch you drown.

You turned and pointed fingers at the truest friend you ever had,
And I prayed to God you'd find relief from the things that you made your
life sad.
We were down forever, together forever all as one,
But when the time came to step up and do it right, I saw you turn and run
I tried so hard, to help you hold it down
You never helped yourself, so sad to watch you drown.
I tried so hard, to help you save your life
You never helped yourself, shut the door and say good-bye.

You and me, eye to eye, hands tied together, live or die
Walk tall forever, all as one, never again, you turned to run.

All for None
