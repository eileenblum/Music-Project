I will never forget what it is that you did to me,
And I will never understand why
You insist upon inflicting pain and agony on me, forever everlasting.

There's no way out, I'll never break free
I will never forgive and forget how you abandoned me.

All my fucking life I've keep my head held high,
Respected myself through thick or thin,
Never asked anybody for anything.
I just want to live with peace and dignity
but you insist on trying to bring me down.

Where were you when I needed you,
You were never around.
I put my faith in you and you let me down.
