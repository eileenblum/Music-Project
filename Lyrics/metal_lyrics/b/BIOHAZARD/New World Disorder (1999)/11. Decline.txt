It's easy to say we scream for change when everyday we act the same.
How can a troubled government make us scapegoats
When we don't go out and vote.
We're spewing, spouting, condemnation

That the world we live in is a racist nation
Since our opinions contradict our statements,
We show our prejudiced affliliations.

Decline of civilization
A crime against humanity,
In all our lies and our self pity
It's time to stop our apathy.

You say you're a victim in pain
But you always prey on someone to blame.
You want to end the suffering for the hungry and the poor
When they ask for help you slam the door.
You want housing for the public good
But not in your own neighbourhood.
Industrial pollution makes you sick,
But you ain't got time for politics.

You want the world to be a better place
For your children, your people, your friends or race,
But selfish reasons drive us all, it's all for none and none for all.
The truth means nothing in a world full of lies,
Hypocrisy is man's demise.
