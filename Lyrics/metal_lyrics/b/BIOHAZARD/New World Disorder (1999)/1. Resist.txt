"Free people will never remain free if they are not willing, if
need be, to fight for their vital interests."

I watch your bullshit from the outside in, you disrespect and hate
You think you're better than your fellow man,
Controlled by fear you seal your fate
How could you step on me, violate, desecrate and hate me
But I'm just like you, flesh and blood, I'm only human.

I resist the pressure to be who you want me to be
I resist the pressure, I resist so I am free.

I see right through your condescending ways, as you look down on me
But I could never stand and judge like you, I resist so I am free.
My peace of mind, peace of mind will set me free
But I'm just like you, flesh and blood, in need of revolution.
I resist so I am free.
