See the future, hate being unsure
Feel insecure, life without a cure
Invade my body like it was your own
A losing battle when challenged alone.

I'm sick and tired of losing someone I love and admire
I'm fucking tired of losing someone like you.

How can you feel it unless it happens to you?
Watching someone suffer there's nothing you can do.
Sit and wait with love and hate, emotions, they destroy,
I question my faith, how can a God, how can a God take?

How can I worship a God who takes life away
And leaves nothing but pain that never goes away.
I lie in bed each night, struggle to fall asleep,
Memories in my head, i pray my soul to keep.
Tried and true, I get up everyday and say,
Life's too short, no time to look the other way.
Gotta face what's inside, I gotta do away
With all the feelings behind my frozen heart, I pray.
