Why do you lie, why do you cheat
Why do you try and deceive
Always twisting around what you say
You better change your foolish ways
This world does not need
Always finding new friends to betray
Payback now
Why do you lie, why do you cheat
Why do you try and deceive
Always twisting around what you say
You better change your foolish ways
This world does not need
Always finding new friends to betray
Payback now

Gonna get yours
what's coming to you
Gonna get yours,
It's the big payback now
See what you've done to me you fool,
I payback now
Backstabber, Payback now

I can't find reason to believe
any word you say is true
Always living surrounded by lies
unless it comes from deep within
Honesty's not for you
Your actions will end in your demise
Payback now
ChorusI entrusted you
and you stabbed me in the back
Trust is what you earn
Tell me that respect I lack
Reason to believe any other word to use
for what you've done to me
In the end you'll be the one to lose
In the end you'll be the one to lose
I entrusted you - wrong
And you stabbed me in the back
Trust is wat you earn - fool
Tell me that respect I lack
Reason to belive - lies
Any other word to use
for what you've done to me
In the end you'll be the one to lose

Gonna get yours
what's coming to you
Gonna get yours,
It's the big payback now
See what you've done to me you fool,
I payback now
Backstabber, Payback now
I can't find reason to believe
any word you say is true
Always living surrounded by lies
unless it comes from deep within
Honesty's not for you
Your actions will end in your demise
Payback now

I entrusted you
and you stabbed me in the back
Trust is what you earn
Tell me that respect I lack
Reason to believe any other word to use
for what you've done to me
In the end you'll be the one to lose
In the end you'll be the one to lose
I entrusted you - wrong
And you stabbed me in the back
Trust is wat you earn - fool
Tell me that respect I lack
Reason to belive - lies
Any other word to use
for what you've done to me
In the end you'll be the one to lose
