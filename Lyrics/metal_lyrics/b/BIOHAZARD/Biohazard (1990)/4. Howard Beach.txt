Total uproar, Media explodes
Inter-racial violence totally unloads
Those not from the streets speak naivetees
Urban youth repeat it's just reality

Howard Beach

Media raging, A battle of TV ratings
Jackass bureaucracy fuels
the fire of hating
Unfortunate happening of
a young man's death
Creating racial tension with every breath

Howard Beach

Media Bullshit
Next time you put on the TV screen
And the man is preaching
About shit he's never seen
Change the channel and ignore the fool
Get out in the streets
then you go to school
