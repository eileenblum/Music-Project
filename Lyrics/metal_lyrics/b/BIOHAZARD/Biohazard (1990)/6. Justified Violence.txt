Tough times ahead of me
Tough times behind
I fight for my life, I fight till I die
I fight to save my mind
It's justified violence
It burns from within
Sometimes a man must fight
It's not always a sin
It's not a sin!
Justified violence
Justified violence!
An innocent victim becomes the pun,
hat thriving fools in search of some fun
It's not fun to fight ten to one
Some won't accept it
that you won't conform
Like bees upon honey the animals swarm
Unjust acts come back to you, I warn

Those who don't fight fair,
you'd best beware
Fight to be yourself
Do unto others
as you'd have done to you
A beating was given in an unfair fight,
revenge is planned, a posse in the night
Street justice decides wrong from right
For the blood and the honor
the sucker will pay,
we will show them the meaning of prey
Today is judgement day

When you're latying face down
and you're part of the ground
What comes around goes around
Justified violence
When you're down in the streets
get back on your feet
Defending you're pride for justified violence
Justified violence [x3]
