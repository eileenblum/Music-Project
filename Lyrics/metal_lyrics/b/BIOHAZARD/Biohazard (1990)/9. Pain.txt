Agony - Inside my head
Making me wish - wish that I was dead
For all the dues in life that I have paid
I've been caught
locked in a world of rage
I look inside myself,
I see a great big blank
I look around me
and there is no one to thank
I think about the crazy shit
that I have done
This game of life - can it be won?
Pain

Pain - feel my agony
as it turns into my rage
in life full of anguish
can't you see I live in
Hell - becomes misery
metamorphasizing hate
I contemplate my demise
can't you feel my pain?
Searching for a better way
In a world with it's eyes closed
Hold your head up high
