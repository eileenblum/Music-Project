You're a fish out of water on the wrong side of the tracks
Gather up the boys to come and take your back
We stand all together against the opposed
We'll die for our brethren, that we have chose

On the wrong - side of the tracks
On the wrong - side of the tracks

Escalation, war in the streets
Catch one sucker and he gets beat
What you see is what you get
Soft motherfuckers will soon meet their end

On the wrong - side of the tracks
On the wrong - side of the tracks

And when you're in fuckin' Brooklyn
You best watch your back!

It took you damn long
To hear me sing this song
Cuz I'm the motherfucker from the wrong
Side of the tracks

Yo! Hey I'm from around the way
You'd better not stray on the wrong
Side of the tracks
Ducking from the 5-0
Didn't know where to go
Never should've stepped on the wrong
Side of the tracks
Hey! Yo cuz I'm good to go
I gotta get back from the wrong
Side of the tracks

Across the tracks
No one takes your back
Across the tracks

The boys in the gang
Want to see me hang
Well I had my bells rang on the wrong
Side of the tracks
Strapped, a broken pact
Caught in a trap on the wrong
Side of the tracks
Wrong or right, I had to fight
I ran for daylight to the right
Side of the tracks
A lesson to learn
When the tables are turned
YOu might get burned on the wrong
Side of the tracks
