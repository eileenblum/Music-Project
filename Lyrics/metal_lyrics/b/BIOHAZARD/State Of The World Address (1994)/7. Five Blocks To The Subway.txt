Walkin' five blocks every day to earn my keep
It ain't easy when you're walkin' on these streets
Runnin' on a tightrope it's a real thin line
Thinkin' that you might die this time
Some things will never change, a street education
So close yet so far, just a block from the station
Standin' on the corner, I might get taken out
Five blocks to the subway, just five blocks away
Five blocks to the subway, I can do that any day
There's a local wise guy he owns the whole damn block
It's easy doin' business when you're payin' off the cops
Makin' money pushin' drugs wouldn't stop if he could
Killin' kids in his own damn neighborhood
Watch out for muggers and the pickpockets beware
You get to play these games when you pay transit fare
Trials and tribulations, a journey made each day
This is my reality,the hardest game to play
Standin' on the platform and I'm waiting for the train
Good thing I'm underground, now it's startin' to rain
Always stand alone, hold the wall up with my back
Or else you might get pushed on to the tracks
