If you were to ask for a favor
There is no such thing, just natural behavior
You see we're family inside
To say we're down with you, yo we say it with pride
Because to us you're real people
Never talkin' down, always as an equal
We're brothers of blood, we share the knife
And now we'll see, Who is down for life
But you front and leave us in doubt
We know who you are and what you're all about
Not sharing mutual respect
And Having to worry about stickin' out our necks
Instead of crying about the loss
We're thankful for those who are down for the cause
We live our lives full of rage
Keepin' ourselves down, mentality of the stone age
Negative emotions project zero
Worryin' and hating, you'll never be a hero
Reach around our back and pull out the knife
And knowing exactly who's down for life
