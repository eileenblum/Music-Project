A child is told from day number one
He's a worthless piece of shit, bad and dumb
Generations pass down low self self esteem
We're molded by things we've heard and seen
Or punched in the mouth for being unsure
Or locked behind the closet door
We learn what we live, we live what we learn
Abuse of innocence to evil we turn
Can anybody hear their cries
Can anybody tell them why
You gotta read between the lies
People die when love is denied
One of many lessons i learned to be like
You ain't gonna live like you
You made me what I am today
So close to you, yet so far away
The pain you lived with made you ill
An empty hole with nothing to fill
I forgive and love you forever still
A waste of time, a waste of life
Livin' on the edge of a sharp fuckun' knife
I can't blame you for never being around
I know you never meant to hurt and bring me down
Look in their eyes to hear their cries
And you will see all their pain lying dormant inside
Now realize as time passes by
That people die when love is denied
