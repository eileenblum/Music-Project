You don't care about
Self doubt coming out from inside out
Knock you down, across town all around the underground
Shooting and disputing you're always persecuting
With your attitude and fucked up views tattooed, rude and crude
Denying, glorifying your way of life while crucifying
Close your eyes for the ride while you glorify your false pride
In any case you're blue in the face 'cause you lost your place in
the human race
That pushed you to do what you do so fuck you and your point of
view
I used to doubt myself because I lived without
What I needed inside
My pride, comes from inside
Nothing to hide enough tears cried
My pride won't be denied
Moan and groan and chew the bone about the zone you call your own
Grow your own backbone hold your own and stand alone
Why pretend and be content with all the hate you hold innate
Pull your weight, it ain't too late to recreate your inner state
Discontent with time ill spent time has come and time has went
Now you vent while you torment why resent ?  misrepresent
The scene between the lean and mean serene, extreme, the American
dream
Live alive revive and thrive on life deprived as I survive
I'm fuckin' pissed off I used to be so angry
I'd disagree with anything that went against inside me
But things have changed I've rearranged in exchange for all the
pain
I kept inside and tried to hide denied and lied, but kept my pride
By my side in good supply all the while, hostile
And senile, I never smiled at anyone but now I'm done
A battle won for number one so look and see and you'll agree
I live life free, I now know me I am a man who knows he can
I know I can, I take my stand
