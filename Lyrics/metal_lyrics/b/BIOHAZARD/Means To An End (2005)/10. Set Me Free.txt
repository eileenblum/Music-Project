I work hard everything I need comes to be
I can look in the mirror and smile back at me
I get up and go to work, Iâm proud of what I see
I stand tall, cuz hard work sets me free

I drag myself out of bed each day to earn my keep
Each day gets harder but I wonât quit cuz I ainât weak
The trick is to make it easy, donât complain just grit your teeth
And do what you gotta do to pay your fucking bills this week

Work hard, everything you need will come to you
Get up, go to work, be proud of what you do
Stand tall, brush it off, grow some thick skin
Working hard setâs you free, state of discipline

I keep my head above the water, I fight for life
Sometimes I take it on the chin, hold my breath and dive
The days get harder and longer, blood and sweat I
Give working hard cuz nothingâs free until I die

Work hard, everything you need will come to you
Get up, go to work, be proud of what you do
Stand tall, brush it off, grow some thick skin
Working hard setâs you free, state of discipline

Doing work to live or live to work
Missing out on time with friends and family hurts
It does no good to hurt the ones
You hold close inside

I kill myself from inside out and die

You know Iâm always there when you need me
Iâm always there for you

Iâm always in your corner fighting for your name
I always got your back

Get up, get to work,
Bust my ass all day
Drag my tired ass back home
Fast food, no time to rest, quick play
Close my eyes, itâs time to die
