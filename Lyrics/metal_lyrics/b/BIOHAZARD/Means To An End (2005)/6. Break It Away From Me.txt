Youâll never break it away from me
Take away everything
Break it away from me
Take it away

For all the years the pain and fears
My life, my blood, my sweat, my tears
Something to stand for you can never take away
This is who I am until my dying day

Refuse the situation
Release the agony inside
I canât appreciate this life, this misery

Youâll never break it away from me
Take away everything
Break it away from me
Take it away

Something inside which helps me to rise
Above the pain, the death, the hate, the lies
Iâm the real fucking deal
This ainât no disguise
Think Iâm fucking around
Take a look in my eyes

Refuse the situation
Release the agony inside
I canât appreciate this life, this misery

Youâll never break it away from me
Take away everything
Break it away from me
Take it away

This is for real â this is who we are
This ainât no fantasy
Iâll die for what  I stand for
My word is everything
You want a piece of me
You stupid motherfucker why canât you see
Youâll never take it away from me
Away from me
