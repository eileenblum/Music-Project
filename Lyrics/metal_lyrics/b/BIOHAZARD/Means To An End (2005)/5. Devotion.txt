Standing together, side by side
Wrong or right we fought with pride
Against the world we fought as one
Never forgetting who we are
Devotion lies beneath the scars
Forever to you Iâm devoted

You know with all my devotion
I died inside with emotion
A soulless being who never won
Forever loosing bet never unsung

Something to live for that gave me strength
Harness the energy and bottle the angst
Hold onto our dreams and never let go
Devoted forever more than you know

Standing together, side by side
Wrong or right we fought with pride
Against the world we fought as one

With my wasted youth I threw it all away
Clouded with confusion I lost my fucking way

The power to overcome is hard to find
A mountain of lies thatâs left behind
Without you here Iâd still be blind
Devoted forever in my heart and mind

Iâm afraid of all the shit I did
The ones I hurt when I was a kid
And all the things that I canât take back
Will come back to haunt me and take my life away

Devoted to you for all youâve been
Youâve always been there for me, thick or thin
You take my side Iâm wrong or right
Devoted to you for all youâve been
