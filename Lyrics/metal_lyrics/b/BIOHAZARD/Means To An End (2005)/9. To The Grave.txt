The demons loved to eat from the inside out
They didnât like me cuz they spit me out
The shell of rotting flesh always wore me out
Sometimes in life, you gotta do without

Rising from the gutter I pushed ahead
I kept my nose clean even when it bled
I always walked tall no matter what was said
Iâve never looked back, now I look ahead

To the grave I take all that Iâve learned in life
Good or bad, dark or eveil, black or white

I never sold my soul

That was how it used to be but this is now
Way back in the day we didnât know how
Loud is how we talked and proud is how we walked
Only the strongest survived on the block
Fucking with the bull will get you stuck good
Heavy on my word is how I stood
Timeâs moved on, we ainât kids no more
Iâll never look back as I close the door

To the grave I take all that Iâve learned in life
Good or bad, dark or eveil, black or white

I never sold my soul

Canât you see it, youâre too blind to
I donât need you, Iâm moving on
Too much bullshit to have to deal with
I donât want to, Iâm moving on
Iâm gonna lose it, canât take the shit
I donât have to, Iâm moving on
I canât fight it, itâs overtaking me

Man will do what man will do
Manâs gotta work to pay his due
Some things change and some things donât
Some will do and some fucks donât
I take pride through and through
Iâll never change, nothing new
To the grave with all I do
To the grave with all I do
