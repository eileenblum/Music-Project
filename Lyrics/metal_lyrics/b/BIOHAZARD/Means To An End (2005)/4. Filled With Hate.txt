You point your finger at me
Youâre drowning in hypocrisy
You think the world canât see
The truthâs your last reality
I point the finger at you
Youâre a piece of shit you know itâs true
My words, my fist and the hard cold truth
Beat yourself till your black and blue

Iâm filled with hate (hate)
Gonna make you feel my pain
My rage, my agony 
Is driving me insane

For all the times you tried to hide 
You canât run from the truth inside
There is no cure for your disease
Your infection brings you to your knees
I look at you with such disgust
Violence is my only lust
You got no heart and you lost my trust
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

Iâm filled with hate (hate)
Gonna make you feel my pain
My rage, my agony 
Is driving me insane
Iâve got a way to move 
Itâs eating me alive
Itâs you or me motherfucker
Only the strong survive

Hating, raging
I am 
Filled with hate
Smashing, bashing
I am 
Filled with hate

And now the end is near 
Youâre a victim of your pain and fear
I pity you in your disgrace
Youâve just spit in your own face
You beat me down but youâre okay
With no one but yourself to blame
You hang your sorry head in shame
But you still canât see through all your pain

Iâm filled with hate (hate)
Gonna make you feel my pain
My rage, my agony 
Is driving me insane
Iâve got a way to move 
Itâs eating me alive
Itâs you or me motherfucker
Only the strong survive

Hating, raging
I am 
Filled with hate
Smashing, bashing
I am 
Filled with hate
