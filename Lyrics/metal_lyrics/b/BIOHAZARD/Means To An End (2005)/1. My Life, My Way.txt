In this world of death and pain
The memory remains,
The dragon that can't be slain

I live life like a warrior
Taking control of everything and everyone
Who stands in front of me weakly
Unafraid to stand my ground
I don't fuck around
Get in my face and I'll knock you down
Pound for pound the undisputed king of these streets
I never ran taking shit from no man
I've fought em all, win or lose, do or die
I'll never give up till I'm asleep in the sky

No one can stop me from living my life my way
My beliefs are all I've got and I'll
Take them to my grave
Don't try and help me, just stay the fuck outta my way
I live for myself and I'll die by what I say

I'll fight to the death for friends and family
Defend their honor or till there's nothing left of me
Like it or not, you can never forget me
Unafraid to show this world
How it should be
It's my life, my way motherfucker
Fuck with me you gonna pay motherfucker
I swear to God I'll never stop
I'll fight for the top until I fuckin' drop

No one can stop me from living my life my way

My beliefs are all I've got and I'll
Take them to my grave
Don't try and help me, just stay the fuck outta my way
I live for myself and I'll die by what I say

My life's been nothing but a struggle
Since the day I opened my eyes
And now I've gotta fight so hard just to get ahead
Provide and survive
Everyday I smash through the lies that
Are twisting me around
This life we live is slipping away but
I'll never let you down
'Cause my days maybe numbered, but
I'll never let you forget
Who I was and what I stood for
A life with no regrets...

A life with no regrets...

No one can stop me from living my life my way
My beliefs are all I've got and I'll
Take them to my grave
Don't try and help me, just stay the fuck outta my way
I live for myself and I'll die by what I say
