Yellow rat bastard no time for you
Iâm busy being all I can, doing what I do
The pride of a man lies in the hearts of his loved ones
Not in what he buys or collects like heâs won
Nowhere to turn, no air to breath
Grasping at your throat take the backdoor and leave
Collapsing souls hold anything they can
Trying to survive, you turned and ran

Coward stand up for yourself and be a man
You ran instead of doing what it is you gotta do
You lose everything and every ounce of respect
For you I got nothing, you ainât worth weight in spit

You can run but you canât hide motherfucker
Looking down the barrel of a gun in your side
With your cold feet and sweaty palms
You turned your back on what is right
Respect you lack
Be a man, itâs time to stand tall, hold your own
Do on to other as youâd have done to you
Grow a backbone, stand alone and care for yours
Cuz in the end thatâs all your gonna really have

Iâm proud of who the fuck I am
I never turned my back like a coward and ran
Itâs the fucking things we do in life that make you a man
So do the right thing and take a stand

Donât stand alone
Stand tall, hold your own, be proud
And take a stand
Make a name for yourself, be loud
And rise above
Donât let the bullshit keep you down
Make a stand
And leave your mark in this dying land

Be a man itâs time to stand tall, hold your own
Do on to others as youâd have done to you
Grow a backbone, stand alone, care for yours
Cuz in the end thatâs all your gonna really have
