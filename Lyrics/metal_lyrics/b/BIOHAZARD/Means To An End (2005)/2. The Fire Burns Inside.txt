I'll never stop believing it
Fighting for achieving it
From the truth I cannot hide
The fire burns inside

We've come so far can't let it go
There's nothing that I better know
It kills me now to watch you die
The Fire burns inside of me

What do you stand for with nothing to say
You've lost the ability to fight for your way
If you live for nothing you'll never know why
The fire burns inside

You never had it - never will
Living off of other's skills
Inside of you, your thoughts collide
The fire still burns inside

You made your bed now go to sleep
Save us from your misery
You gave it up - your dreams have died
The fire still burns inside of me

The dreams inside of you died
You live a life of lies
But I'll never forget why
The fire burns inside
