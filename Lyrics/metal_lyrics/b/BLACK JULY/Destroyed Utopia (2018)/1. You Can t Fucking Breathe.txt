No fuel to light the flame
As time goes on I go insane
We are stuck in this corrupt state
My mind was made to hate
Shrieks of agony made a new melody
I've fallen helplessly
To the time I could only dwell
THIS IS MY FUCKING HELL

Inside my mind was a much better time
I could breathe I could see everything around me
I was anxiously waiting for the god ridden catastrophe
To finally end my life

In this Destroyed Utopia

No fuel to light the flame
As time goes on I go insane
We are stuck in this corrupt state
My mind was made to hate

Why are you the only one who has left me here to die
I can't breathe or feel life anymore
Your existence is nothing to me you worthless whore

Now watch as I take over and burn this shit all down
I am your god
And only ashes will be found six feet under the ground
