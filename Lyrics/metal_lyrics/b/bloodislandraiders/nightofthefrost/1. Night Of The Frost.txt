I feel the frost as it bites my skin I feel Death's stare as he moves in
My soul burns hot as it tries to flee and God only knows what's in store for me
It's at the end when we reflect about what we have and what we'll get
Did I do this right did I pass the test is it my time to burn or my time to rest?
Can we count the cost of all we've lost
Can we count the cost as it comes down to the night of the frost

My soul burns hot as it tries to flee and God only knows what's in store for me
Did I do this right did I pass the test is it my time to burn or will I rest?
Can we count the cost of all we've lost
Can we count the cost as it comes down to the night of the frost
