It never came like they said it would I missed the Odyssey
Nothing happened like they said it should it's come and gone you see
I feel cheated because I read the books I waited all my life
Supposed to come and end it all supposed to end the strife

Now I am sad and it's all bad I'll never live to see
I'll be dead before the end of this humanity

Armageddon what went wrong?
Why did you make me wait so long?
Supposed to come along and set the spirits free
Armageddon what went wrong?
Why did you take so damn long?
Supposed to clean the shit and rewrite history
