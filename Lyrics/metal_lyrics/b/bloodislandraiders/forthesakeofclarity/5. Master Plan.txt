Never judge a book by its cover it's always better to discover
The fake Rolex on my arm is no match for my sweet charm
Now you will discover that I am one bad mother
But I'm one with a plan and you'll find out I'm all man
You will

Do you think you've got what it takes what if I increased the stakes?
Do you think you'll see it through because I won't go easy on you
I'm the man with the plan I'm the man I got plans
I'm the man in the band I'm the man and I got my fucking
I do
