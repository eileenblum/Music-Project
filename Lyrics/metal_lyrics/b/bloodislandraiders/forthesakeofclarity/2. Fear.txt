What if I was to tell you that I can see inside your head?
And what if I was to tell you that in the end you'll end up dead?

What if I was to show you your future lies within my grasp?
And what if I was to show you that I'm the one that owns your ass?

Taking time to do the crime do you see what I can see?
Are you here to cross the line can you solve the mystery?
What if I covered your eyes would you hear all I can hear?
And if you saw through all the lies would you fear all that I fear?

What if I decided to let you have total control?
Would you turn your back on me and let my turmoil take its toll?
