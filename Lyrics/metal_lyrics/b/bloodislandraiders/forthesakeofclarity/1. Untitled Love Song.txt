Want to take you to the edge but you're freaking want to take you and jump of the ledge
Want to show you how it could be but you're freaking set your body and soul and mind free
Do you want to be with me can you stand to take a chance on something new?
Do you want to be set free because I'm coming after you

I need to get you to admit but you're running you need me more than a little bit
I need you by my side so stop running we'll cross through to the other side
Do you want to be with me can you stand to take a chance on something new?
Do you want to be set free because I'm coming after you

Take you to the edge jump off the ledge
Show you how it could be set your mind free 
Do you want to be with me can you stand to take a chance on something new?
Do you want to be set free because I'm coming after you
