Been hugging the bowl now and I got the sweats
My nose is running badly and I ain't done yet
I got an ache in my belly and it won't go away
I feel it building up inside me I think it's here to stay

I can't take any more now because I know the score
If this goes on for much longer I'll end up on the floor
Now I can't take no more I am on my back down on this floor
Something is going on inside my head if I keep this up I'll end up dead
