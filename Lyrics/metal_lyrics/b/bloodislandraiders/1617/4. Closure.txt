I did all I could to do right by you but it was never good enough for you
Time we spent all gone to waste now now you see there's no turning back
You want it but I need it so don't you take it all away

Now you see the mistakes you've made and how I was left in pain
Sorry I could not resolve this there'll never be an us again
You want it but I need it so don't you take it all away

You gave it all away you can't get it back
You gave it all away you can't get it back
You want it but I need it so don't you take it all away
You want it but I need it so don't you take it all away
