I took the time to feed on the poison that you gave to me
I took the time to live in all the lies that you let me see
Broken trust and broken dreams nothing left for you to say
Torn apart and left for dead but I'll be back for another day

Now I see the time has come hot to rise above all the bullshit that's surrounding me
Now I see the shit in you now I see the weakness in me
I won't take anymore from you I've got to fight for my right to be free
