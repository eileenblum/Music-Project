And it's taken up most of my time I can't explain the reason or rhyme
But I got it down line for line now you'll see
And you say that you want to believe but I don't think that you can conceive
And I think it's time that you receive then you'll see

Will you follow me will you come with me?
Will you trust in me will you follow?
Take my hand I'll lead you to the man 

Can you feel it all build up inside are you glad that you came for the ride?
All this power I'll no longer hide then they'll see
You can't stand by and watch it ascend you must join me so we can transcend
Like the circle there will be no end now they'll see
