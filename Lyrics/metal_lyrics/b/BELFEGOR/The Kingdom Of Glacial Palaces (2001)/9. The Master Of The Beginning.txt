In the snow chambers of the palace of ice
In the long deserted and frozen dungeon
Beyond the absurd, beyond reality
The callous souls of the suicides knock at the ice ceilings of the dark caves

Chased by the wind
They freeze the rocks
Suffering for ages
They Beg For Forgiveness

In the snow chambers of the palace of ice
In the long deserted and frozen dungeon
Beyond the absurd, beyond reality
The callous souls of the suicides knock at the ice ceilings of the dark caves

Chased by the wind
They freeze the rocks
Suffering for ages
They Beg For Forgiveness

Exhausting they keep waiting for the end
From the beginning of all the beginnings
They are deprived of the core of hope
In the silence of death they freeze the lost time
Like the blade of arrows being in exile to another world

In the snow chambers of the palace of ice
In the long deserted and frozen dungeon
Beyond the absurd, beyond reality
The callous souls of the suicides knock at the ice ceilings of the dark caves

Chased by the wind
They freeze the rocks
Suffering for ages
They Beg For Forgiveness

In the snow chambers of the palace of ice
In the long deserted and frozen dungeon
Beyond the absurd, beyond reality
The callous souls of the suicides knock at the ice ceilings of the dark caves
