Sexual screaming calls the night
The erotic dreams of the night clothe the crawing
Diabolic winds embrace sleeping bodies
Invisible wings of desire
Invisible stony melancholy tormentor of the gods of suns
Tormentor of the gods of suns persecutor
Sometimes I cry to the moon
Sometimes the moon cries with me
Nocturnal orgasm took control of the body
The stone sadness built its throne
Satan - Tormentor of the gods of suns

Satanighthrone
Night - My throne

Satanighthrone
The black emptiness of the night sky grave comets pierce the spirit of witches
Alcohol and blood the moon silver darkness of the sky
The night is the order
The nocturnal demon of the night desire
Satan, night and throne

Satanighthrone
