I'll Come From Four Sides Of The World
Nine moons will show me the way
Nine deer will guide me
I'll bring nine keys

I'll sing your dream into a bloody sartoan
I will end up inside your soul
Inside your heart i will build my castle
I'll fill the lake with blood

I'll hang two moons, and sit under them on my throne

I'll Come From Four Sides Of The World
Nine moons will show me the way
Nine deer will guide me
I'll bring nine keys
