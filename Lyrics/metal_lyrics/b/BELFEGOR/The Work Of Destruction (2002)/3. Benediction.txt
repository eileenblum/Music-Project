I do not tread the edge
'Cause the edge I am
The tormenting blade
Which cuts the peace
and virtue of ladies in white
Their lives now live on my blades
Black feathers and black coaches
Thunders of pioson
and diamond tongues of demons
Which slurp on their virgin purity
Holy whores and burning virgins
I pluck you out of the flames
and bless you
