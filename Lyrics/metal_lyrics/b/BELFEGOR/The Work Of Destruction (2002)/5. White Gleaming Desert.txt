The sleeping lake of my spirit of oblivion
Is flooded with the cold silver gleam of the moon
The rivers of my painful dreams roar with thousands of hells
The sea of death storms upon the tired coast of life
The diamond lullaby showers the emerald bed with rubies
Where once the amber love lay
Now the stinking blasphemy of your bodies
Drunk with the embrance of diabolical revel fire
Sucks on your souls

The faces are falling off
Leaving the dead staring eyes
And the grim grimace of polished skulls
Where once the proud crowd treaded
Of your children, fathers and your mothers
On the carpet of broken bones
Now walks the gang of skeletons dressed in rags
In the end, the white gleaming desert is left
Where my demon will build his throne
