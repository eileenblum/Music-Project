From the bed - clothes of heaven
The stars are shooting like a radiant rain
Invisible dreams on the ownerless world
Crash against the crust of reality
A white angel in my fiery bed
And my restless soul between his legs

Withered flowers and stale wine
Can you feel the smell , the taste?
When the dear tiredness descends upon you
Lie down next to me
In my fiery bed

Whores writhing in the ecstasy of suffering and pain
Their bellies slit open
Show the innards and hearts still beating
Swelling beneath the ribs that glow with bright heat
