Oh, demon,
The demon of silence
Silence whose soundless scream
Kills every echo in itself
Let the black crows fly
Over grey shadows of wolves
Let the tears shine like diamonds
And the night music rock
the hearts into moral sleep

When the comets rift the black abyss of the sky
Let the beast arrive on the teeth of thw wind
To impregnate earthly woman
Who will the bear the giants

Let the chambers whisper to me
Of terrible webs of mystery and darkness
Le the driver of my soul's chariot arrive
And with the silver liling laughter of the dwarves
Accompany me to the other side of life
And sentence the living to the grandest of pains
The loneliness amidst my wrath
