Your terrifying vision of death
In the terryfing land of ice
Will be the cause of death
Of the hearts and souls of your gods

The winter storm - the legion of arctic spirits

When gasping out their last breath
They punished their minds with
the nightmarish vision of hell
The hell that dwells in the eternal frost

At my whim the card of time and space
Will contain the chaotic future
