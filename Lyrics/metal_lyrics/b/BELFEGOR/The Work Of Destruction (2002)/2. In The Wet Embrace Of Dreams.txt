In the wet embrance of dreams
I saw the leafless trees
As they showed their branches writhing in pain

And the old oak, so tired
The lone witness of the passing time

Grey clouds suspendet over it - so pregnant with wetness

The nighty darkness
Has defeated the drab of the day
All vitality
Has beed stolen by time

In the wet embrance of dreams
The sky so dark and so starry

Among the stars they dance in the dark
Flitting like big cats
Stars are their eyes
The eyes of the stalking predators

In the wet embrance of dreams
The diabolical revel has come upon me
As a radiant swish of the flying demon
It has rained with pearly hail
On the moon-silvered forests of trees
Covered with sparks of madness
The space has floated me to the peaks
of the mountains of oblivion
Everything has faded in the deluge
of scarlet and desire
