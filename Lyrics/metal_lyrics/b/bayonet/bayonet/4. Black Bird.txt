Anniversaries
they never comfort me.
Just a day reminding me
of disease.

I'm sniffing salt,
I'm sniffing salt,
at the coming week
it's all my fault.

All my fault.

Cause my father is a bastard
I should stuff like a pig!

But I'm left alone to watch you burn,
watch this city fucking burn!

I'm everything
that you taught me to be.
You know what? I'm a lie,
I'm a fucking disease. 

Don't feel young,
don't feel love,
I'm a passionate kid.

Fuck hope,
fuck you
and fuck this city.

Life doesn't care about the things
that you think you had planned,
or what you want to turn out,
or what you need in the end.

Life doesn't care about your plans. 
(Fuck hope!)

Goddamn, you old man
your not who I wanted to be.
When you turn out your lights
I hope that you see me. (I hope you see me!)

All I ever wanted was for you to want me.
All I ever wanted was for you to love me.

And when you read this
I want you to know
this is my last chance trying,
my last chance for you.

And don't you care 
about your fucking daughter?
And how can you call yourself 
my fucking father?

And I've hated you 
since I was a young boy.
And now I'm all fucked up,
all fucked up from you.

Love me to death.

No matter what I do,
I always forget,
I always forget to forget you.

No matter what I do,
I always forget,
I always forget. (To forget you!) 
[x2]

No matter what I do,
I always forget,
I always forget to forget

Regret.
(Regret!)
[x3]

Regret the years
you made me wait
to just find out 
that I was your mistake.
