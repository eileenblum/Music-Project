Where did you go?
So far from everything I know. (I know.)

Leaving no room to grow.
Where did you go?

So far from everything I know. 
(Where did you go?)

I watch you ruin
everything good in my life.

Live in the moment and you'll see.
(Wake up wake up it's time to be!)
Everything that you want and need.
(Wake up wake up it's time to be!)

I'm caught in the past
now it's my time to stand.
I've got no home.
I've got no plan.

(Wake up wake up!)
Shut up.

Just leave it here
upon deaf ears.
The ones who fall away,
we fall. (We fall.)

It wasn't like this,
it wasn't at all.

Where did you go?
So far from everything I know.
(Where did you go?)

I am blessed by error.
I am blind by love.
[x2]

Live in the moment and you'll see.
(Wake up wake up it's time to be!)
Everything that you want and need.
(Wake up wake up it's time to be!)

I was caught in the past
now it's my time to stand.
I've got no hope.
I've got no plan.
(I've got no plan!)

I'll sail this ship across the sea.
In ritual waves of misery.
I find myself alone tonight.
Find myself without a light.
I've always been a tragedy
a fucking waste of everything.

I hate myself.
I hate my fucking self.
