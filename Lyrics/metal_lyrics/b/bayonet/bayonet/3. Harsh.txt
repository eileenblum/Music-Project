Her lashes stuck
with palm prints to my face.
I never wanted to be
what I always hate.

A new scent
from old regrets
like the backhand
from my fathers glance.

And I'm crucified
if I believed 
the cross meant anything.

Oh heaven sent him?
Well I forgot him.
It didn't help my mother pay the rent.

And in the view of 'Perfect Town'.
I was the bastard with a broken crown. 

I'm just trying to figure out
why I did this. (Why I did this!)

Believe me!
(Believe me!)
You need me
cause I'm fucked up.

And I'm just trying to figure out
why I'm so in love with doubt.
Why am I so afraid?

What is it that keeps me up at night? [x2]

The passion the feel,
the tear in the seal,
the lies and the lies
and the lies that I tell.

Why did I do this?
Why oh why oh why?
And how can I fix this
How could how could I?

And I'm just trying to figure out
why I'm so in love with doubt.
Why am I so afraid of myself?

What is it that keeps me up at night? [x2]

The passion the fail, 
the blood in the sail,
the lies and the lies
and the lies that I tell.

I'm still so afraid
(Give me!)
of the life I'd like to live.
(A reason to go on!) 
[x2]

Give me a reason to go on alone.
I'm still afraid.

And all I ever wanted was to not feel alone.
All I ever wanted was to find my way home.
All I ever wanted was to not feel alone
but that's exactly what I got
'cause that's exactly what I'm owed.
