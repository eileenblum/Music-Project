Is this oppression?
Or obsession?
With a life that I can't come to terms with?

Is this karma?
Or is it payback?
All from some unknown resentment?

Cause I just want to know myself.
Oh I just want to love myself.

Like an addict to a vein I want something to
blind me from the emptiness and pain.

So what's the point to all this mess?
{I} Want a face worth shaving,
{I} Want a soul worth saving.

I keep an arms length
distance from my lovers cause my father.
You know what he made me.
I'll never be set free.

And can you really tell me that
you know the person you lie in bed with?
All their secrets when they feel pathetic?

And it's our hope to feel that close
I try [x4] and I don't!

Everybody wants to believe
that their life is really filled with meaning. 
When will I be free?

I wish I could, wish I could say everything
that I feel without judging.
Who I was in my eyes 
cause then I just might disguise.

Speak with honesty, set my own heart free.

Just like I said before
is it worth even keeping score?
Cause everything that I ever did was a miss. (Take!)  

I really wish that I was better than this.
I still want something that I probably won't get.
It doesn't matter who you are at the start. 
It matters who you are when everything falls apart.

I live my life like I'm going to hell.
So when I get there I won't feel like I fell.
From heights, through the lights.
At least I'll know what just hit me.

A simple point, a simple fact 
that I can't take my words with me.
