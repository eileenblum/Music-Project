Beat in glow to prove immortality.
Separate from where we belong.

One year more, one year less
Fight in unnatural war for the progress.
One age more, one age less
Is this our time to confess?

Should we feel ssory? Living is an art.
What a sad story by the nuclear heart.

From salvation
Our last spark of hope and glory
To devastation
Replace my flesh with the steel

Take my flesh, have my heart out.
Just do it, do it, do it, do it!
Look into my faithful eyes.
Just do it, do it, do it, do it!

And we swear to ourselves.
This is our only hope.
We were born to live it so. No, no, no. no.

But there is another side
Sufferings of empty life
Noone has to live it so. No, no, no. no.

Should we now restore connection?
Substitute the fake with true.
My heart still beats the rhythm so it's not over.
Time's ticking my body belongs to you.

You seem to want become a part of history.
I seem to lay here and die alone.
Defeat of death in artificial society
And I belong to nowhere.

My last spark of hope and glory
Replacing my flesh with the steel
There is noone to say 'I am ssory'
And this last wound will never heal.

Rust, feed, cussed breed.
Nature is no longer place we belong

Rust, feed, cussed breed.
What should I feel when I died at birth?
