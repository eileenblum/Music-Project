I will stand this fight for you!
I will rise to get it through!
I will stand this fight for you!
I will stand this fight, I will stand!

If you reject the Vedic law cities gonna burn down.
Don't make another flaw, brother, this is not your crown!

It's not about the money or dirty pelf.
This murder of my brothers is a murder of myself.
Our fathers lay dying and mothers are crying.
This murder of my brothers what it's implying?

Come on, come on, Arjuna!
All these lands no longer yours (lands no longer yours).
Come on, come on, Arjuna!
I am not afraid of you (not afraid of you).

War, I want you hold on this war.
A flatricidal war. Arjuna, I want you stand still for your ground.

War, I want you hold on this war.
A flatricidal war. Arjuna, I want you stand still for your ground, stand for your ground.

I want you stand still for your ground!
I want you stand this war again.
I want you stand still for your ground!
I want you stand this war again.

I will stand this fight for you!
I will rise to get it through!
I will stand this fight for you, I will stand!

Come on, come on, Carna!
Look at my celestial Form (My celestial Form).
Come on, come on, Carna!
You will not survive this storm (not survive this storm).

It's not about the money or dirty pelf
This murder of my brothers is a murder of myself.
Our fathers lay dying and mothers are crying.
This murder of my brothers what it's implying?

War, I want you hold on this war.
A flatricidal war. Arjuna, I want you stand still for your ground.

War, I want you hold on this war.
A flatricidal war. Arjuna, I want you stand still for your ground.

Oh mighty charioteer,
Lead me for the sake of great justice
May I survive this battle or not, let's go!

Back vocals: Oh mighty charioteer, take away my fear
Lead my nation to salvation.

Wheels are spinning fast we are crashing everyone
Wegde is thinning, sharpen arrows for my flaring bow...

If you reject it, your cities gonna burn down!
The brothers fallen, this is no longer your crown!

I want you stand still for your ground!
I want you stand still for your ground!

When I hear their mothers cry
My heart falls out to the floor
There is nothing to blame me for
And I'll live in hope.

Every time I look in the mirror, it feels like I am coming back
Every time I look in the mirror, I hate face I'm looking at back.
