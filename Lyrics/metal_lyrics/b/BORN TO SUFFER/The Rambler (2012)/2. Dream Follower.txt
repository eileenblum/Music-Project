Take yourself away from this place
You may feel dismay in the airspace.

You may feel dismay on your way to the stars.

Born unwinged. Nevermind.
Cause the sun lights all roads equally bright

Fear of getting lost.
Never trade dreams on the action.
Loosing hope is not an option

Never turning back! Hey! Hey!
Never turning back! Hey! Hey!
Never turning back and letting doubts and regrets get inside of you. Hey!

So many things have twisted in huge spiral around us.
And here we stand screaming and gazing at what we've done in life.
There are many deeds to feel regret for.
These things constantly draw us back, pull underneath.
But I strongly believe. I say... I say... They make us human beings.

Here I stand screaming to what I've done in life.
Cut my wings bleeding in permanent strife

We are the pulsing stars, lost in outer worlds
We spin and whirl, we spin and whirl and we spin and whirl impearled
Let's go!

All streams are flowing into one, into one lake
We often try to skip, it's our mistake. Great mistake.
Time to fix it.
