Let's try something new.
I'm thinking of an old technique.
I can't promise anything.
Maybe snaptures of memory will come back.
Maybe nothing will happen. Are you willing to try?

You are very relaxed, you hear only my voice.
Your eyelips are getting heavy.
Your arms and legs are getting heavy.

I'm going to count to three. When I say three...
...you will be asleeping.

One.
Two..
Three...you are sleeping.

I know myself as the back of my hand.
I can predict my every reaction, everything is predictable.
My life has been cast in cement with airbags and seatbelts.
I've done everything to reach this point and now that I'm here,
I'm fucking bored.

Of all those lives which one...which one is the right one?
Each of these lives is the right one.
Every path is the right path.

What was it like when humanans were mortal?
We did everything we can't do in this dump and it was wonderful.
We fell in love...

I got to wake up!
I got to wake up!

As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible.
Life is a playground or nothing.

In chess it's called Zugzwang. When the only viable move...
Is not to move.
