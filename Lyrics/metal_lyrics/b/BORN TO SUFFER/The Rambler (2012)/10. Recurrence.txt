Hold your breath,
Remember every single choice.
Incarnations of whom we used to be...
Transpierce my life,
Make me be alert before them.
We drift apart again.

As the worlds collide,
I'm finding the fissures of time.
And I'm chasing you
To uphold the right.

They've always tried to stop me, to take up.
To get you out I'll sacrifice my everything!
I'll fight this war!

And I no longer feel safe, leave me alone.
To find the truth from what came everything
I'll fight this war! To get you out of this.

You tear away, there's nothing left for me.
No reason to stay, no reason to be.
And I'm digging and searching this ground.
The oceans dried out, when I found myself drowned again.

From day to day, it's getting even harder.
I bate my breath we're running out of time.

And all the windows are immured, it's all becoming irreversable
I won't give up, I'll do my final spurt to get you out of this

You tear away, there's nothing left for me.
No reason to stay, no reason to be.
And I'm digging and searching this ground.
The oceans dried out when I found myself drowned again.

Hold your breath, every single choice, close your eyes.
Time has passed me by, but course of action never lies.

What has to be erased will be erased no matter what.
And every step is traced the story with unhappy plot.

Of what time was deprived would be returned.
All bridges burnt down by the wheel of time, for your concern...
