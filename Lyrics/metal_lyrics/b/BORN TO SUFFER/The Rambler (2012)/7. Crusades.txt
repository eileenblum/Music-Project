People all over the Christian world, unite now!
Steeple bells loud for the purging of soul, you bow down!

Blood and steel, we ravage and kill. Head for the prey!
Awake me.
Sword and shield, we murder to feel your atonement!
Awake me.

Ah. These unfaithful creatures must get back to hell!
Ah. We are the holy church, we never got to loose!

Weight. Release your weight away. Release sins away.

Road to Jerusalem...
It's now your turn to die and suffer.
Your troops left thousands dead, so let your trip be even tougher.

Weight. Release your weight away. Release sins away.
Weight. Release your weight away. Release sins away.

Warriors and knights of the holy cross, unite now!
Steeple bells loud for the Children's crusades.

Weight. Release your weight away. Release sins away.
Weight. Release your weight away.

Sons shall keep the story of how it has begun.
War for faith and glory turned to selfish massacre.
We pray to restore in your heart a reason to live in peace.
These times will come, these times will come.

Blood and steel, we ravage and kill. Head for the prey!
Awake me.
Sword and shield, we murder to feel your atonement!
Awake me.

Ah. These unfaithful creatures must get back to hell!
Ah. We are the holy church, we never got to loose!
