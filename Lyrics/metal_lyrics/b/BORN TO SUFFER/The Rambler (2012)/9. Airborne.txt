Brother, light me a cigarette
I woke up in cold sweat again.
What would new day bring to us?

Brother, one hour till the sunset.
In face of constant threat
We are starting engines, heading to skyway.

A dozen flights there will be more.
Who knows if we survive this war?
Our stage is air, the troops on surface
To escort, defend and care.

A hundred fights we're struggling for
The clear sky and virgin shores.
Three years're stretching long, three years.

I'll do it only for myself
Late in the night we're taking off
Give me a reason to believe
And I will come back home.

I'll do it only for myself
Late in the night we're taking off
Give me a reason to believe
And we were airborne.

[Back vocals:]
We are the falcon army!
No capture but death in ram attack!

We are the falcon army!
No prison, no capture but death!

We are the falcon army!
No capture, we are ramming the enemy!

A dozen flights there will be more
A hundred fights we're struggling for
Clear sky, virgin shores

The song of those, who lay in snows
The song of those, sung in prose
The song of those, who gave thier flesh and laid their bones
The song of those, who rest in snows

These bullets weight too much to pay, to pay them back.
