Stars, starfall so common for us all.

But now voices rasp and I can not grasp your hand, I'm on crash-land
Stars scattered at night, our foresight made us contrite.
Now we turn off the light!

We are in air!
We are in air!
Parseks fly by...

The distance stretches life. Parseks fly by.
There's not a sign of our presence. Time collapses.
I hope you'll hear my voice, react and stop to rejoice.
This is a warning to you. This is my warning to you!

Burned plot of land wasted, left behind.
Imperial glory, grand but wrested, has declined.

The brothers fell for what produced destruction.
It's like a grievous story tell, that rumbles in obstraction.

I want to gain. I am your bane. Don't dare blame me for your pain.
I just want to consume. Never presume to awake.

Never end, never stop. They tell us never rest and drop our gaze
At where we go.
Nature, history and faith - gaged, bondaged and embrased.
They're laying and dying slow.

Two fractions of hope, the long-playing note
It's played in the deep spaces for noval races that straggle in the Universe.

If I could stay home.
If I could pay off the loan.

It's time to look back, to reach the content and conclude.
I have a perfect chance to drop my gaze at decades of regress.
The rambler, lost in the space of all-expanding universe.
With this expansion, I'm loosing you, but hope is everlasting.
Infinity of space came from the smallest dot. One moment it will shrink back.

I want to be strong, I want to behold.
Land where there's no war of hunger and gold.
I'm sure, there's so.
