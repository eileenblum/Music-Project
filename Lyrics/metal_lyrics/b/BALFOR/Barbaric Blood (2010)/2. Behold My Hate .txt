When the ravens cover the skies,
Hordes of wolves run through the plains of oblivion.
Dead warriors rise from the ruins of time.
I gather my armies for whirlwind campaign.

Follow me now, like the raging chaos steam
New age begins with the wave of my hand
Iâm the ancient horror, the spirit of war
Behold my armies, let the killing begin

Behold my hate, as the mountains are rumbling
Taste the fear of the fallen enemies
Behold my power of the hurricane raging
The hateful chains are torn by my hand
Behold my hate!!!

Hold by my side on the way through eternity
Traverse this pass from the start till the end
From the confinement of your soul
To the glory of your empire of hatred 

Raise from your knees, open your eyes
Frustrated by false ideas of the hidebound society
Condemned to the loss and eternal bondage
Fight your doom, join the immortals

Canonized despots are dictating the dance
Of pain and pride, of fucking lies
Black soil, soaked with blood
Will curse them all, will curse their god!

Behold my hate, as the mountains are rumbling
Taste the fear of the fallen enemies
Behold my power of the hurricane raging
The hateful chains are torn by my hand
Behold my hate!!!
