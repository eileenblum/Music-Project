Gods of war I call youâ¦behold
Bless me for revenge, bless me for battle
Rouse fire inside my heart
Yet this war is mine
Gods of war my anger like the storm
As the snow, as the fire, as a quintessence of strength
Born in the lifeless world of gloom
I'm in a thunder of ancient glory

I am a furious wolf escape from the chains
I am anger of Gods; slaves will get down on their knees
I am the strength of thousand winds 
I came to erase all mistakes of mankind

Gods of war I call youâ¦ arise
Hear groans of the wounded, accept sacrifice
Lead to victory armies of mine
Welcome my warriors in your hall of immortals
Gods of war my spirit like the steel
So pure, so tough, like quintessence of rage
Born in the lifeless world of gloom
I'm in a thunder of ancient glory

From the darkest of the dark clouds
Like the strongest of the strong storms
On the chariots of fire they come to my world
Mighty gods of war through time are still alive at night

My warriors are inspired by the Gods 
Gods of my beloved land fight proudly

I am a furious wolf escaped from chains
I am anger of Gods; slaves will get down on their knees
I am the strength of thousand winds 
I came to erase all mistakes of mankind
