Hear the song of the wind
Let it spread in thy searching soul
Feel the coldness of the stars
Plunge into their eternal power

Walk through the deepest woods
Talk to shadows wondering through times
Join their dance on the edge of lightâs demise
Make your step to the dark abyss

Blinded by the light
Now your eyes can see
World that full of lies
Full of false beliefs

Answer the summons of  blood
Scorn the weakness of your mortal flesh
Merge into the elemental fire
As the dying day merge into the darkness

Follow the spirit of night
Let him take you to their higher spheres
Join the rite of the shades
Join their dance on the edge of lightâs demise

Blinded by the light
Now your eyes can see
World that full of lies
Full of false beliefs
