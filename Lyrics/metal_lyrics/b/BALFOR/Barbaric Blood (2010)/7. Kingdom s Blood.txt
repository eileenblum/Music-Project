Our name is power our strength is pride
We guard our lands as did our ancestors...with might 
Defending the sacred land of frosty air
On hungry giant wolves we ride through never-ending storms
Trees are our towers; mountains are our walls
Our life began behind the Endless waterfalls
Our fathers were born when the river and fire
Started the dance of lust and desire
In our names we carry their fame -
The streams of raging water is hateful blood

Kingdom's Blood!!! 
In our veins it flows like fire
Kingdom's Blood!!!
Its flow makes us bloodthirsty
Kingdom's Blood!!!
Our claws of steel will tear apart
Our enemy's throat!

Rivers of hatred and agony will be spilled over our land
And we see the fear in the eyes of the enemy
As they flee and pray their worthless lives be saved
Swords of steel have no mercy and like to be washed in blood
Our silver axes know no fear as they are hewing flesh
So we crush the unworthy, who came to us in war
Defend the Citadel of our glory - this is our aim!
And our Fathers will gaze on their sons dying for the Kingdom's Blood

Kingdom's Blood!!! 
In our veins it flows like fire
Kingdom's Blood!!!
Its flow makes us bloodthirsty
Kingdom's Blood!!!
Our claws of steel will tear apart
Our enemy's throat!

Keep our name that we brought to you through the ages
In your hearts. We came to show you the truth!
Our claws will take the crippled lives - The War will be won
Honor and Strength - these are in our Kingdom's Blood!

Kingdom's Blood!!! 
In our veins it flows like fire
Kingdom's Blood!!!
Its flow makes us bloodthirsty
Kingdom's Blood!!!
Our claws of steel will tear apart
Our enemy's throat!

Kingdom's Blood!!! Kingdom's Blood!!! Kingdom's Blood!!!
