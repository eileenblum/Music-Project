Strangers exhale their putrid breath
Their stench violates the pure cold air
Their lust defiles the sacred land
And leaves scorched earth behind
No one sees their eyes...
No one feels their claws...
No one smells their breath...
Only hellish whispering... Death!!...

The soil agonizes under the hammer of lightning
Damn you, kings, who have angered the Gods!
Blood freezes from the groans of mothers
We will fight for the glory till the last drop of blood!
This is revenge for our pride
This is the rage, flowing in our veins
This is the hate, hate in our eyes
We will not fail in this endless war!

As the smoke from pyres blackens the sky
Enemies celebrate their evil victories
The silent fury is creeping up behind
And waiting for the deadly leap
Look into our eyes...
Face our claws...
Feel our breath...
Hear the roar of your death!

And nothing will be left to mourn
Dead in a battle or dead on their knees
All equal in this bloody carnage
But not in the eyes of Gods... dead Kingdom of pride!

The soil agonizes under the hammer of lightning
Damn you, kings, who have angered the Gods!
Blood freezes from the groans of mothers
We will fight for the glory till the last drop of blood!
This is revenge for our pride
This is the rage, flowing in our veins
This is the hate, hate in our eyes
We will not fail in this endless war!
