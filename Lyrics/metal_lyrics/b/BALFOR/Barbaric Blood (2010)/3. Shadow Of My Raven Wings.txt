I'm the mighty raven dark 
My voice is the thunder of blackened skies
My sight is the lightning of steel 
My soul is the heart of winter 
Endless wind gives life to my word
It carries me high straight to the moon
To fly over ruins of broken beliefs 
Spreading the shadow of my raven wings

Mighty cold winter winds. Accept my wrath
Carry my song. Through the dusk of Gods
Mighty cold winter winds. Collapse my enemies
My sacred battle wonât be lostâ¦Never 

Raising tops of the mountains so high
Raging waves of the ocean so deep 
Are my warriors full of hatred and blood thirst.
Mighty hordes of my kingdom.
Berserk power of natural hate, 
Fill my messiah with strength.
I'm the mind and he is my hand, 
United we're the scythe of justice.

Hear my song of fire and wind 
Trust my word destroying the silence
See my sight the lightning through dark
Join my soul - the heart of winter

Mighty cold winter winds. Accept my wrath
Carry my song. Through the dusk of Gods
Mighty cold winter winds. Collapse my enemies
My sacred battle wonât be lostâ¦Never
