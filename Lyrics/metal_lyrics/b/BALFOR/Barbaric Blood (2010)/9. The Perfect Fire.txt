See the sites of fire
On forsaken lands
These are traces left
By fury and rage

Agonizing Death
In this total war
Everything is wiped
By the Perfect Fire!

Nothing will rise
on this cursed land
Poisoned by blood
Of enemies and allies!

Agonizing Death
In this total war
Everything is wiped
By the Perfect Fire!

...And wind will take the ashes
...to scatter over soil
...And water won't sate the thirst
...And Sun won't warm the heart...

Sky full of smoke
Refuses Sun
Spills no tears
For its fallen sons
All colours of life
Raped by the flame
Turned to dust
Blown by the wind

...And wind will take the ashes
...to scatter over soil
...And water won't sate the thirst
...And Sun won't warm the heart...

Perfect Fireâ¦
Perfect Fireâ¦
â¦Perfect Fire!
