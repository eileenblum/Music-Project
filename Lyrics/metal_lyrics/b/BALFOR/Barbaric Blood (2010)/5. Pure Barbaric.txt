With the winds of war we come
With the raging thunder we returnâ¦from the past
From the tombs of ice we rise
Long ago forgotten hymns will soundâ¦again

Like frozen horizons, our eyes are so cold
Like burning fire, our souls are so pure

Stop the endless pain
Break the chains of time
Breathe new life to temples
Of forgotten Gods
Raise your cup of blood
Raise your shining sword
Singing songs of hatred
At the dawn of war

Grey enormous wolves we ride
Ancient hordes of north we leadâ¦for battle
We hold our banners high and proud
Colours of death are still red and black

Like shadows at midnight, our souls are so black
Like the ancient weapons, our eyes are so cold

Stop the endless pain
Break the chains of time
Breathe new life to temples
Of forgotten Gods
Raise your cup of blood
Raise your shining sword
Singing songs of hatred
At the dawn of war
