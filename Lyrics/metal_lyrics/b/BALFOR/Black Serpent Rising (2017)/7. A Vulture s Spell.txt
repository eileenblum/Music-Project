The wind howls with menace
and the earth screams for blood
My hands are raised in lonely victory
The fires burn, unending rage
The fires burn, cleansing the night

I'm a sword sworn to those claimed by death
Warrior heart fighting for nothing
Standing alone, drowning in blood
An emptiness profound and unending

The names of those lost rest on my tongue
Never forgotten, remaining unspoken
Listen as the darkness closes in
Stand eternal among the fallen

Here I - listen - to the - flames
An era - ending - where I - stand
One day - I'll join - the fallen - ones
The night - it claims - us all - now

Thunder beckons to my haggard soul 
A drum beat forever marching onwards 
For the fallen, for the mighty ones
I claw at the sky and cheat death again

I'm a sword sworn to those claimed by death
Warrior heart fighting for nothing
Standing alone, drowning in blood
An emptiness profound and unending
