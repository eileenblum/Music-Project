The forest whispers to the slumbered beast 
I feel it stretch within my bones 
Yearning for power and hungry for blood 
Finding solitude in the dark 
Together we paint this bleak winter red 
Frozen in time for all to see 
A battle fought and won in moonlight 
So savage and so glorious

All hope - is drowned in dust
So useless to this savage traveller
This place - of endings and echoes
Sings empty whispers of days long gone
Still we fight

Forever guided by twisted bloodlust 
Follow a path with no return 
Eyes and thoughts focused on terminal darkness 
Tearing through a world in turmoil 
Ashes and mist render all sight useless 
The beast arises, takes the reigns 
Mind lost in battle and found in death 
More steps on the savage road

Night is mine - Leaving lesser souls to burn and crawl 
All is still - Great power diminishes everything else
This lunar curse struggles and rages
Without fear, without end

Mercy is wasted on the undeserving 
We will let them fall
Their craven blood will feed the barren earth
While we become strong
