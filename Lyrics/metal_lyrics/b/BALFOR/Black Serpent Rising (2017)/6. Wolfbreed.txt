Ravenous eyes are watching deep inside of me
Claws of hatred tear apart my wicked flesh
Victorious horns lead horde from the North
No walls will stop us, your kingdom will fall


Like the hungry beast this fury possesses my mind
The instinct of conquest, for triumph I fight 
As anger burns inside to heal my wounds 
Lead me by the path war ancestor wolf 

With rumbling march of my horde empire falls 

Under bleak skies, between mighty winds
Still my desires are in hunger
I call to arms, my furious wolfs
The ground beneath us shakes, we are colours the night with blood

With rumbling march of my horde empire falls 

Like the hungry beast this fury possesses my mind
The instinct of conquest, for triumph I fight 
As anger burns inside to heal my wounds 
Lead me by the path war ancestor wolf 

With rumbling march of my horde empire falls
