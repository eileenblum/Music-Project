Final hour comes and sun turns black
Chain will fall and wolf turns up from the prophesies 
From the past they come with hate
Mighty hordes of giants force their way
Now it must be done whatâs been foreseen

...I call you...

Black dragon rises from the waves
Raging storms lightning strikes
Hammer falls down to the earth
Mighty black dragon rise

Serpent poisons sky, turns world to the night
Tides of crimson blood flow through the land
Unleash enormous wolf, so mad, so cruel
Mighty titans shall perish in fire...with pride

Fire glows within to burn my flesh
Elder serpent rises do you feel his deadly breath 
From the past they come with pain
Raving horns and shakes will mark their way
Now it must be done whatâs been foreseen

...Come on

Hungry wolf escapes from the chains
Brings eternal night, swallows the sun
Earth aflame, burning sword befalls from the sky
Mountains are falling down
...but weâre stand

Iâve seen the last moment of human course
Over the world aflame black ravens soared
When the sun goes dying
When the pale moon dips into night

Heralds of the fall...

Serpent poisons sky, turns world to the night
Tides of crimson blood flow through the land
Unleash enormous wolf, so mad, so cruel
Mighty titans shall perish in fire.
