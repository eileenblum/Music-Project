We stand stoic, in a field of ice
Damaged and bound for the dark
Searching truths, finding only dust
We are fear and fear is coming

A nightmare, choking while you wake
Stealing freedom from your grasp
Your lapse in judgment, my strong resentment
Crawl through the dirt of your own grave

I am the venom
A vicious breed
I feed on terror
Horror beckons to me
We are the judgment
A vicious breed
Massacre traitors
We rise, they fall

A promise broken, a debt forged in pain
Unforgiven treachery
Marks your skin, and casts a shadow
You are lost and you are dying

Blinded by stygian night, an oppressive dark
Let it suffocate and bleed
Feel the wrath, slowly drown in filth
A pale husk fades into nothing

I am the venom
A vicious breed
I feed on terror
Horror beckons to me
We are the judgment
A vicious breed
Massacre traitors
We rise, they fall
