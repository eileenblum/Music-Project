Crimson stains upon my body
Now there is only blood and death
Chaos! Hail our colossal fall
Twilight descends and frost claims the earth
Silence the lupine howls
Great War!
Chaos summons me to endless night

Waves of obsidian waters
Mask me as my body succumbs
A name no longer spoken
And a deed etched in stone
The storm of death erupts
A ravenous maelstrom
War cries! Determined words
Claimed by the endless night

Prepared for death
My feet wade through ash
Fearing no man I slaughter the damned...
Taste the blood!
Strong mountains will crumble
And oceans will boil
A bloodstain on fate
Victor in death
Never yielding
I ride!

Mortal bodies descend
Headstrong and unrelenting
Transformed into ethereal wraiths
A moment in time changes all
No time for ceremonies
A rituals forgotten
We fall! A whispered scream
Fading into the endless night

Prepared for death
My feet wade through ash
Fearing no man I slaughter the damned...
Taste the blood!
Strong mountains will crumble
And oceans will boil
A bloodstain on fate
Victor in death
Never yielding
I die!
