In the absence of deities, only warriors and corpses remain
Our legion is the dead, itâs the dyingâ¦
The sun may bleed black, but we belong in the depths of night
We are drenched in moonlit skies; drowned in oceans, slaughtered by serpents

Deep rives flow crimson
Rise Serpents of the Black Sun
Unbound, now torn by steel
With our fates foretold, we fight

Dragging life into the abyss 
Hail serpents of the black sun
Life spilt, venom will soar 
March to the end of the world

Premonitions of betrayal, sinking beneath savage waves
A lust for corruption, lust for your blood...
Thunder will roll, giving strength to our cause
A legend walks nine paces, into the hall, slaughtered by serpents

Deep rives flow crimson
Rise Serpents of the Black Sun
Unbound, now torn by steel
With our fates foretold, we fight

Dragging life into the abyss 
Hail serpents of the black sun
Life spilt, venom will soar 
March to the end of the world

Death comes, Midnight dawn
Honour, Mourns the fallen
Vengeance, Brutal hymn
It goes on, The end begins
