Our life's futureholds nothing for the both of uswe had it once, but now it's all lostin the midst of the hardest winterwe found ourselves separated by an ocean of prideThe rising tide come forth to the skytrust was broken foreverhorizon bring hope, come forth to meThis is where they play godThis is the placewhere the fake becomes realand the sun never healsThis is the placewhere you tell your liesand never disguiseWhat's behind the truth i seekIn this hour of brutal honestyI'll forever sleep and never see another dayTo the world I once built around usSo forgiveness isn't what i'm ready forI find myself confined within the waking daythose walls fell down and we could breathe eternitywe'll never see another daywe'll never feel the light againTo defy my strengthI wander through this tide of endless dreamsAnd I don't regret anythingCause tonight we'll be torn apart
