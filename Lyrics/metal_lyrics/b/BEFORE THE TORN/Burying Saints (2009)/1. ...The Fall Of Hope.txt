This life's covered in lieseverything he sayseverything he touches it diesbeneath the ages of this nationsun sets behind god's crucificationLord give me shelterkeep me safedescend from this lifeenlight my thoughtswalk the edge of desperationclimb this tomblive againWhat i say - to youit's where the path - leads tofollow me, to the end of eternitySorrow took my sight awaythe spark of your eyesit triggers my painthe forthcoming hopeit belongs to this worldrising from this gravebring us hope!What i say - to youit's where the path - leads tofollow me, to the end of eternity
