If you come to change our minds to blacki rather kill our night insteadi've seen the signsthe promise was brokenthe pages of this book have been stolenburning the skiesto the last breathbring chills on my spineright on the momenti called lucifer - "watch me on this heavenly judgement"understand, my pain is reallet it end, i can no longer feelthunders come strike from the cloudspunishing me for my fate and my fortunethere is no mapfor this place i seekto bring this hope back from the sinki search in vain all over this townA god's forsaken place, it's what i foundevery step coming our waya heart beating soundmakes us praystriking from the cloudsthe wrath of god, brings its punishmentsupon this manShaking this thronethe wrath of god, brings its punishmentsupon this kinga last step i walkinto forevergiving no one my handits feels like my blood has turned into ashesas i walk these streetsi see the lightningscoming to punish mefor the sins of agesthe final journey takes placeeternal battlesbetween hell and heaveni struggle foreverin search for forgivenesscome on its a beautiful worldfull with sickness
