I found myself sinking in your heartfull of false hopes and beliefsYou and i, never questioned his judgementthought you were the only one with the abilitydecrepit lords sit on their thronesthe crushing sun relentless in its risedisgusted with what we are,leads us to our hollow existenceperpetual insanitya thousand nightmares to relivewake up today to a worldsuppressing my feelingsconstantly fighting haunted shipsstriking my graceful approachdarkness rises in every wrong actionevil is in every directionbrightness comes with love and compassiongoodness is our way to redemptionevery step leads us closer to the edgeevery moment passing by it's another failurei lived my life with no regrets
