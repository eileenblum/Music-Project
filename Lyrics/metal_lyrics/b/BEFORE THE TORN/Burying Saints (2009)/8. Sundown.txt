Back from the world of the dead
i watch the tide
keeps coming back and forth
and it seems so distant
unable to feel, unable to love at all
rest assure oblivion wont reignite the remains of her
this is a curse
this is the worst
these are all the days to come
it's the end of our frozen world
and we fade with time
the bitter taste of failure
it dies inside our virtuous lives
beneath the waves of guilt
i kill away endless dreams
with the promise to return
the passion that was forever lost
our world turns upside down
it's our burden to die for something more
we've been sent to drown
in this life of selfishness
the sun is down
here comes darkness
sundown is up, the sky keeps darkening
so precious the wrath of god,
we've been sailing through endless seas
we have been forsaken
sundown is up, the sky keeps darkening
blackening me
so precious the wrath of god...
