Everything you thought it belonged to this world
it's all wrong
And the life you struggled and fought for
it's all gone
A few memories left to remember
of something long lost
salvation, resurrection, passion
three things i killed for
And when hell calls my name
i close my eyes and hear the voices below
"you are my rescuer, my rescuer"
My inspirations have forsaken me
for someone else's dreams
compelling me to strike them
with fury words and anger sentiments
Carry me through this night of desperation
follow the light that leads us to damnation
we're going straight to hell
We descend, we fall,
into the deepest circle of hell
we're falling until we rise
rise in this hell
And when hell calls my name
i close my eyes and hear the voices below
"you are my rescuer, my rescuer"
This feeling never dies
This calling never ends
I would only return to collect my own soul
