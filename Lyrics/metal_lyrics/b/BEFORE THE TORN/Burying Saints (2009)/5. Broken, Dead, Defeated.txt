All i ever wanted
was to find the balance of my heart
holding on to something strong
keep faithful to what we are
Hold my hand
and walk with me through these graves
and broken crypts of time and age
stand by my side
i'll keep your secrets safe
i'll tell no one
that you are gone
they look at me with those blaming eyes
they scream at me with those guilty words
They judge me for what i am
i blame them for what they are
broken gods sit on their tombs
they plot for our doom
they pull your heads to the ground
they will make your blood run forever
false gods lay on their crypts
waiting for new false spirits
All i ever wanted
was to find the balance of my heart
holding on to something strong
keep faithful to what we are
Broken, Dead, Defeated
Regardless of their false hopes
Broken gods sit on their tombs
They plot for our doom
