That night, uncalling feelings drawn my heart into a picturedressed in shape of treasonpain staring from my eyesi've seen pictures of buried saintson your reflectionmake this insecurity (or frailty)make it go away (go away)turn yesterday's memories (memories)part of your heartI kept your words insideand put my heart awayyou spread your wings to flybut without them you will dieshadows of meaningless wordsstill haunt my mindpraying for all of this remorse to go awayi refuse to die in shamethere's no redemptionmurdered feelingsshadows of meaningless wordsstill haunt my mindpraying for all of this remorse to go awayi refuse to die in shameI kept your words insideand put my heart awayyou spread your wings to flybut without them you will die
