What have we learned from this life?
what do we seek in this world?
we defy and we defend
with no time to make emends
could we lose sight of what
we thought it was meaningless
burn our bridges
burn our bonds
accept the fire within us
kill what it's best in me
destroy this perfect dream
put out whats best in you
In a world so senseless
i hide my feelings from everyone
these are my last words
What have we learned from this life?
what do we seek in this world?
I've filled my heart with solitude
burn our bridges
burn our bonds
accept the fire within us
bring us to our demise
