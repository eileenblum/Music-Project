Now I can see through all my ashes
I can smell and feel all this fire
it's just something we built through time
it's like a mystery, unsolved

but all I have are these scars...
it's what makes me strive
deep inside I know the reason
I'm trying to feel alive
I bleed for better days

something's not right
I can feel it in your heart
struggling to get out
the rage that once you kept inside
it's now consuming your life

NOW!
well this is now
this is right now
let the past behind
let the future come
