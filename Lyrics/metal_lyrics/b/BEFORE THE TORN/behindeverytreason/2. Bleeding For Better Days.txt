I've witnessed the rise and fall of my salvation
Envision the ghost of hopes and theories
we promised never to leave behind
we promised never to forget
I'm blind, I can't see the sign imprinted on the sky
that leads my way to heaven

I can't quit these feelings
living in my heart
I won't relinquish you
ever again
I'm struggling to have you back in my arms
hopping that we settle back where we were
there was once so much bliss inside, but
when trust is not enough
love dies forever

don't ask me to kill you,
don't ask me to forget you.
The day I murdered your love,
Was the day I died
