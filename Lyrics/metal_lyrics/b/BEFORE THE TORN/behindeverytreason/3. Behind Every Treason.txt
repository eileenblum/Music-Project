I reborn everyday
but still I can't forget you
everyone leads me astray
everyday I stay true to myself

what are we all fighting for?
when in the end we all lose

once again my heart breaks
'cause everything stays the same
and all the struggle was in vain

I've felt, like threes only pain
in this life, but when you came along

I fell like
like there's something more
in this world

so the worst isn't over,
there are still wars to fight
how can I get closer
carrying this broken heart

The world is coming to an end
all the fables start to bend
the world is coming to an end
and never again we be able to defend
