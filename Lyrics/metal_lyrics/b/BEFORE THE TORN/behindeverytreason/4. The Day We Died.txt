Betrayed and I feel so
like there's no reason to understand your behaviour
the darkest clouds surround my path
I seek the feeling for all of us
I fight for the healing of the world
but no one cares
and now all I want, is the answer for myself
the feeling just for me
behind every treason
my heart grows stronger
behind every treason
my soul gets older
these thoughts will soon turn into ashes
