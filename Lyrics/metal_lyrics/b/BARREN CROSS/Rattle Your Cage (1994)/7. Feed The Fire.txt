They came from everywhere growling just like bears
Waiting for the go, the 're ready for rock n roll
Like a hungry breed, feeding time 's a need
Tonight they will be fed heaven for every head

The crowd is loud enough feed to blow
Feed the bears but don't give them rock and roll

The building starts to shake walls begin to break
The stage is gonna blow from the Spirit of God you know
The bears are getting restless and the time has all but come
Suddenly there's a flash the fires have begun

Growl and howl yell an roar
Feed the bears and give 'em God's rock and roll

Loose the shackles from my feet and shoulders
And we'll feed the fire in the name of God
Feed the bears a little fire from heaven
And they'll know what power is in the name of God

Hunger makes the wild roar
Better keep em fed - rock n roll - with a little fire

Loose the shackles from my feet and head
And we'll feed the fire in the name of God
Feed the bears a little fire from heaven
And they'll know what power is - in the name of God
