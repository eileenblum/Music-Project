I wasn't feelin' to well - a little hotter than hell
And it was right about the midnight hour
Saw a fisherman - he put his catch in my hand
My soul was shaken just like lightning and thunder
I saw a look in his eyes. It burned a hole in my mind
The Son was rising, it was midnight baby
I felt a surge in me, down to my knees, shakin' me

[Pre-chorus]
All night, my heart was really crying I've been on my own
Midnight, broken love had found me, now I'm goin home

[Chorus]
Midnight Son - you're the light that surrounds me alone in the dark
Midnight Son
Midnight Son - you're the comfort that warms in the midnight hour
Midnight Son
Midnight Son

Check my pulse and You'll see - just what has happened to me
My blood is running like a mile-high river
You brought me to my knees - You dropped me heaven's keys
When it's open wide I'm gonna take a ride to Ya
The things l thought were just fine have escaped my mind
The point of no return has just been burned

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
