Lord l feel so confused can't decide what to do
So l stand here before you
Please take my hand and show me which way to go l can't see
I need your wisdom to guide me

I am only a man who seeks to understand
What Your will is for me Lord I'm ready show me
All l want is to hear from You, please talk to me

Lord l will stand here and wait no matter how long it takes
For You alone hold the answer
Please search my heart and show me if there is anything You see
That might keep me from Your glory

I am only a man who seeks to understand what Your will is for me
Lord I'm ready, show me
All l want is to hear from You please talk tome
