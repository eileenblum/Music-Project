At the bus stop raining cats and dogs
A little woman, no umbrella, out in the cold... rain
I was there, too, umbrella of my own
I offered protection but she looked at me as if to say
I see where this is going

She said
Sorry I don't talk to strangers daddy wouldn't like you either

I Think you misunderstood me I'm only trying to help
You really look like you need me
She said don't flatter yourself but
So I stood there looking abused like a fool, but I knew
I don't believe on the sole of her shoes, oh no
...Said I'm a nice guy, little bit funny, responsible, ethical,
And she just looked at me laughing
She said I think you're a lying little boy, she said

Sorry I don't talk to strangers, daddy wouldn't like you either

I didn't say you're my baby, I'm only being nice
Because you look like you need me
She said don't give me your lines

At the bus stop raining cats and dogs
A little woman, driving me out of my mind
One, she's not so funny,
Two, she's very of loony,
Three, she's mean and
Four, she's completely insane
Ya, she's really drivin' me out of my mind - so l said

Sorry l don't talk to strangers, daddy wouldn't like you either

And so l let her get rained on, hair was soakin' wet
She really should have believed me better
Some girls get so upset
