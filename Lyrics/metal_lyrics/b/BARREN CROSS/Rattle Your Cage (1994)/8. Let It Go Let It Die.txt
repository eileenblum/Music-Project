I lay here in the blackened night bitterness in my heart
Feeling it grow stronger as l slowly die away
But Jesus told me let it go and let it die
I paid for that brothers wrongs with My life

I remember the day so clearly l was hurt and at my low
Some wrong words said, and man l was dead
With pain I'd never know
But Jesus told me let it go and let it die
I paid for that brothers wrongs with My life
And then He told me let it go and let it die...
You got to forgive or you'll die inside

I justified my angry life each and every day
But as time went on, His Spirit was gone
Alone and bitter and my God so far away

But Jesus told me let it go and let it die
I paid for that brothers wrongs with My life
And then he told me let go let it die

You got to forgive, you got to forgive
You got to forgive or you'll die inside
You got to forgive, you got to forgive
You got to forgive or you'll die inside
Let it go
Let it die
