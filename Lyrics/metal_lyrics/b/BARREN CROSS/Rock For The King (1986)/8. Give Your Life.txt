The bible says in black and in red
To turn from sin and let Christ in

Love, happiness and peace eternally,
All these things can be yours - for free

[Chorus]
Give your life to Jesus - He'll forgive your sins
Give your life to Jesus - just let Him in
Give your life to Jesus - you could do no wrong
Give your life to Jesus - He will make you strong

Jesus said He's coming again
The day is near,
Well, can't you hear the voice of

Love, happiness and peace eternally,
All these things can be yours - for free

[Chorus]

Give your life to Jesus
Give your life to Jesus
Give your life to Jesus
