There is someone who wants to hold you
In his arms because he loves you
Let him enter your empty heart
Jesus fills you, just open your arms

[1st chorus]
Is there a hole in your heart
You can't seem to fill
You've tried everything
But it's empty still
Look to the cross
That's where your answer is
He's not hanging there,
He lives - the Barren Cross

[2nd chorus]
He loves you
He loves you
He loves you
He loves you

God loved you first, that's why he made you
In his image and likeness so
Your body is the temple of the spirit
When you accept him and you fear him

[1st chorus]

[2nd chorus]
