In the day of the white horse
Many will fly up to the sky
Heaven awaits those who live for the King
This is what I sing

Oh, the joy will rise when we see
The rider of the white horse
We will rock - for the King
We will rock
We will rock - for the King

Get yourselves ready to take to the air
Soon we'll be there - those who live for the King
We're rockin' steady
We'll never let go of the truth we know
And He gives you new life

Oh, the joy will rise when we see
The rider of the white horse
We will rock - for the King
We will rock
We will rock - to the gates
We will stand - stand up
For the King

Drink the water of life
And you will never thirst - no
Taste the laughter of joy
As it builds inside you

Oh, the joy will rise when we see
The white horse and...
We will rock
For the King
We will rock
Time is running out
We will rock
Shout it to the face of the crowd
We will rock
Let the people know - make it loud
We will rock
The kingdom is at hand
We will rock
It's time to make a stand

Rock for the King
