Here you are
So close and yet you're far
I see you falling
Your flame is lit no more
I'm always there, in time of your despair
When I knock, you're never there

[Chorus:]
Light the flame
Take hold and know my name
I love to give you all the love that's in my hand
Light the flame
My gift to you's been paid
Receive the King, His crowns await your stand

Does your guilt descend
Till you want the bitter end?
Are you so confused?
Can't you see you're being used?
I just want to make you free
But you go on just, fighting me

[Chorus]

Here you are
So close and yet you're so far
I see you falling
Your flame is lit no more
I can make you free, trust in me
Take courage - light your flame and see

[Chorus]
