Listen son to what I have done
I have received, I have believed
See me now, see what I found
I want to shout, come and believe

Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe

Give it a chance, freedom at last
Yours for free, take and receive
Better than pot, Jesus rocks
Come and believe

Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe

You will find out joy will come to you
Take it, drink it, no fee, come and believe
Smoke on his love - believe

Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe

Chuck the past, do it fast
Could be your last chance to receive
Where do you stand, what's the plan
Take it, come and believe

You will find out joy will come to you
Take it, drink it, no fee, come and believe
Smoke on his love and you will see the rock - roll
