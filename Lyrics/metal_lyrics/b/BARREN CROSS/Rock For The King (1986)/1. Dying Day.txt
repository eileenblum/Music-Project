Going down to the battle site where guns and bullets lay
To see the screaming wounded men, it's dying soldiers' day
Fight the yellows, fight the reds, shoot all those in sight
Fight the wars that were never yours, kill the world tonight

Dying day - for without the king, there'll be
Dying day - there's no use to look to see
Another way - talk of peace never ends
Dying day - but the blood sheds instead

Take your boots and here's your gun,
Take your lunch and wage
Here's a piece of ribbon if you're killed while acting brave
Hit the sirens, nuke the town, drink the acid rain
Peace will be here late next week, ups on train

Dying day - for without the king, there'll be
Dying day - there's no use to look to see
Another way - talk of peace starts the fight
Dying day - so the wars go on, that's right

Fill the shelters, clear the grounds, missile's on its way
No more time to change your mind, brother, it's too late,
It's dying day

Dying day - the king is the light, your only key
Dying day - there's no other way to see
Dying day - without him, you've just lost the light
Dying day - oh the king, oh the king was right
