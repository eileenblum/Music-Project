We see the days
The world goes through a change
Miracles ever day

A man receives
He prays "God, take my life"
Now his eyes can see

[Chorus:]
Just a touch
Of His hand
And you'll be healed - you will

A hand is healed
A finger grows in place
A little of God's grace

A man walks
Not prisoned by a chair
God can hear our prayers

[Chorus]

A family lives
God can heal the pain
Divorce is just insane

His word is right
It takes away your pain
Call on Jesus' name

[Chorus]
