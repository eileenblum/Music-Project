Good evening to all of you
Well we hope you'll enjoy the show
Tonite the music belongs
To those of you who can rock and roll
We came to play, this is your day, so get excited
Stand up and rock, give all you got
Let's feel the music
Bring it home

Staring out from backstage
Minutes from the start of the show
I'm ready to begin
My adrenaline is starting to flow
The crowd is getting louder
And the stage is telling me now to energize
Push into the fast lane
Floor it to the metal as we soar to the sky

Close your eyes and feel the music's power rising
Making you feel good inside your mind and body
The stage of intensity

The surge of power in my blood
A flash of lightnings coming down
Escaping to the hungry crowd
Where they receive it screaming loud
There is a chemistry in here
Intense enough to make them cheer
(Till the end of next year)

Living on the road
Where we travel from your town to the next
Doing what we love
Making sure that we only give you the best
And so to all the rockers, we salute you
We are here for all of you
Push into the fast lane, floor it to the metal
I will scream for you

Close your eyes and feel the music's power rising
Making you feel good inside your mind and body
The stage of intensity

The surge of power in my blood
A flash of lightnings coming down
Escaping to the hungry crowd
Where they receive it screaming loud
There is a chemistry in here
Intense enough to make them cheer
(Till the end of next year)

The man that plays the instrument can be a tool
And so he is responsible for what he tells you
Imagine you are standing on a stage

The surge of power in my blood
A flash of lightnings coming down
Escaping to the hungry crowd
Where they receive it screaming loud
There is a chemistry in here
Intense enough to make them cheer
(Till the end of next year)

Now it's time for you
To respond by getting very loud
Captured by the mood of the song
That we will play for you now
You act as the jury in the court
Of rock and roll all will rise
Push into the fast lane, floor it to the metal
Now, scream to the sky
