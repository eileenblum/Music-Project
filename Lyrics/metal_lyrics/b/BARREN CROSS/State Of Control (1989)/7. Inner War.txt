Seven years later, I'm still at war
The flesh and the spirit try to even the score
I thought in time it would go away
But the fight gets stronger day after day

I'm gonna scream I'm gonna shout
I'm the one that wins without a doubt
The victories mine in this inner war
And I won't be a slave to the flesh no more

I do the things I don't want to do
The good in me fights to come through
It took some time but I realized
That when I don't sin I'm satisfied

I'm gonna scream I'm gonna shout
I'm the one that wins without a doubt
The victories mine in this inner war
And I won't be a slave to the flesh no more

I'm on my knees asking right from wrong
I look to the God who makes me strong
I don't live in fear of what I do
I got a spirit of fire that knows the rules

I'm gonna scream I'm gonna shout
I'm the one that wins without a doubt
The victories mine in this inner war
And I won't be a slave to the flesh no more
