She was strange and so I loved her
Her red hair a blaze of fire
Boy, she melted all my wires
She is mine

I'm in love
At full volume
I believe
She's the one for me

She's the beauty queen of my dreams
She's the star in all my movies
She's the song that sings my feelings
She is mine

I'm in love
At full volume
I believe
She's the one for me

I recall the night we married
Moved together me and my lady
I enjoy her, Lord I loved her
She is mine

I'm in love
At full volume
I believe
She's the one for me
