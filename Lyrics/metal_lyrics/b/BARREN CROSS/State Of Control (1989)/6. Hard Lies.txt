Take what you can
Try to take it all
That's what you were taught
When you were small
Something for nothing
Just ain't the way
Everything you got
Had a price to pay

Who can you believe
When you turn your back
Who can you believe
When you're being told

Hard lies hard lies
They seem to surround our lives
Hard lies hard lies
Like the chill of a cold, dark night

People look at you
Right in the eyes
Calling you 'friend'
While they tell you lies
Taking from you
All that they can
Making you feel
Like a lesser man

Who can you believe
When you turn your back
Who can you believe
When you're being told

Hard lies hard lies
They seem to surround our lives
Hard lies hard lies
Like the chill of a cold, dark night
