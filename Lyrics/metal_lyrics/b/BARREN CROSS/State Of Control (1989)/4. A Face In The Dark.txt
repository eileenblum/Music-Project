L.A.'s the place of dreams
Or so it seems
Is there a place you're runnin' to
Don't like it where you are
Life is oh so hard
You feel like runnin' somewhere new

The things that wait for you
Isn't what you want
Who you think you'll be
Is not who you'll become

A face a face
In the dark
A face a face
In the dark

So when you left your home
You didn't leave a note
Were things there that bad
It's lonely running blind
You're running out of time
My friend you look so sad

The things that wait for you
Isn't what you want
Who you think you'll be
Is not who you'll become

The things that wait for you
Isn't what you want
Who you think you'll be
Is not who you'll become

A face a face
In the dark
A face a face
In the dark
