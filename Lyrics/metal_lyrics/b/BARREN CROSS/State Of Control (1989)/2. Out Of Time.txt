Why did you wait
Why did you hesitate
We tried to warn you
Now you're out of time

You chose your own way
Now your gonna pay
The party's over
And you've been left behind

We tried to show you Gods love
But you said I don't need
We tried to help you to see
You said He's not for me

Don't wait
Like a thief in the night
You'd better turn on your light
He might come back tonight

Why did you run
When God gave his only Son
So you might have everlasting life
Before it's too late
There's a choice you've got to make
If you receive Him
You won't get left behind

Let Jesus consume your mind
Drink from the living well
You will live forever, yes
But if in heaven or hell

Don't wait
Like a thief in the night
You'd better turn on your light
He might come back tonight

He's comin' back
It's a matter of fact
But we don't know when
He's comin' again
We tried to show you Gods love
But you said I don't need

Don't wait
Like a thief in the night
You'd better turn on your light
He might come back tonight
