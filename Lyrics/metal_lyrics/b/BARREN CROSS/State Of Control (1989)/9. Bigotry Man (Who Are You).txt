You're lucky you were born
You might not have been
All people in this world
Have a right to live
Your bigotry is hell for
The other man
Who's color of skin by the way you just might have been

The racist rambles on
To tell what good he's done
His pride and arrogance
Has made him smaller
And so the bigot falls
Hippocracy's black walls
Cave in on his unworthy head

Who, who are you
Are, bigotry man
You, you think you are better than them
Your not

Men who are not like you are of lower form
Men who don't look like you should of not been born
The selfish man that hates knows not what is love
Eventually he'll live all the things he's said and done

Who, who are you
Are, bigotry man
You, you think you are better than them
Your not

The racist rambles on
To tell what good he's done
His pride and arrogance
Has made him smaller
And so the bigot falls
Hippocracy's black walls
Cave in on his unworthy head

Who, who are you
Are, bigotry man
You, you think you are better than them
Your not
