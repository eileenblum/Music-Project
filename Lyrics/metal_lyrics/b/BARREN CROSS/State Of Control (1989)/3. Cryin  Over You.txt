It's been a few days
Since you've left and said goodbye
There's got to be a way
To stop the pain inside

Oh how I miss you baby
Looking at the pictures in my hand
Wondering if I'll see you
Ever again

I'm cryin' oh oh
Can't you see my heart is breaking
I'm cryin' oh oh
But I get my strength from up above
I'm cryin' oh oh
My love she isn't taking
I'm cryin' oh oh
Over you

It's been a few nights
That I've spent my time at home
But somehow I know
I'm not in this alone

Oh how I miss you baby
Looking at the pictures in my hand
Wondering if I'll see you
Ever again

I'm cryin' oh oh
Can't you see my heart is breaking
I'm cryin' oh oh
But I get my strength from up above
I'm cryin' oh oh
My love she isn't taking
I'm cryin' oh oh
Over you

Why don't you listen to reason
There ain't no problem we can't solve
This hard times only a season
We've got to fight gotta fight for our love

I'm cryin' oh oh
Can't you see my heart is breaking
I'm cryin' oh oh
But I get my strength from up above
I'm cryin' oh oh
My love she isn't taking
I'm cryin' oh oh
Over you
