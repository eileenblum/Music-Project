And then it came at the end of all time
A time where nothing grows old, nothing dies
It's a place where you can fly all around, heaven is found
Can't you see the bright lightning in sound

Close to the edge - I was running out of time
Close to the edge - but now there's peace of mind

And now I look to the north and I see in front of me
A shining blue light in the distance, oh I see
A castle of ivory gold, look out, behold
It almost never became my home

Close to the edge - I was running out of time
Close to the edge - walking on a thin, thin line

Close to the edge - the spotlight shines on you now
Close to the edge - you better make your choice soon now
Close to the edge - your heart's the key that makes you free
Close to the edge - as the world blinds your eyes, god can make you see
You're close to the edge

Don't burn out the light, it ain't burning bright,
Son, can't you see where you're going, you're close to the edge

I know you cry, you don't wanna die,
So take what I've found, and you'll be miles and miles from the edge
You're close to the edge

On the edge of the world there's only one rhyme
But you ain't got the time to know what it means,
You're dead, you're dead
Don't figure it out 'cause you're dead, you're dead.

On the edge of the world, on the edge of the world
No one else can save you only Jesus
Close to the edge
