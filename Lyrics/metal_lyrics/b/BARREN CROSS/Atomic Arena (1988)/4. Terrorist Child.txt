See the fire of a burning rage
Teach a class full of kids to hate
Pledge allegiance to an unknown cause
A fight they know nothing of

[Chorus]
Terrorist child, if you only knew
You were taken and brainwashed only to kill
Terrorist child, your days are few
And the blood that you shed will come back to you,
Terrorist child

The playground is their battlefield
The army game they play is real
No fun in their little lives
Only trained to die

[Chorus]
