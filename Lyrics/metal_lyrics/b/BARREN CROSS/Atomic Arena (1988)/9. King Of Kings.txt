There's a mountain up in the Havens
That can never ever be moved
He's the Father of all creation
And He knows you even better than you do

He's the rock, the great I Am, the reason why we sing, He's the

King of kings, the master of all things
The power and the source
The everlasting force

You and I are just one of creation
We were formed in the beginning of time
God took some sand and made it flesh
With one breath
Created the first man

He's the rock, the great I Am, the reason why we sing, He's the

[Chorus]

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,
This magnificent earth
All the mountains and the trees
All the creatures that fill the seas
His earth, this beautiful earth

He's the

[Chorus]

King of kings
