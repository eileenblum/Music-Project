I've seen the earth vomits from her, from her lips of sanity
We've brought this upon ourselves, the hell that broke loose
A day may come when, all hope remains dead

[Chorus]
To the world that I've seen,
Fulfill your oath to lord and land
I can't take it anymore of this,
Same fear that would take the heart of me!

I've never met anyone with the likes of you
The fire burning in your eyes
The hatred and malice that will consume you to death
In the dawn of hope and despair, you'll have a king
He will lead you to your, oblivion
Claim your immortality
Stand and fight till the end, stand your grounds!

WE WILL STAND...!!

WE WILL STAND OUR GROUNDS TILL THE END!!

WILL STAND OUR GROUNDS TILL THE END!!

TILL THE END!!

WORKOUT YOUR! OWN SALVATION! WITH! FEAR AND TREMBLING!

Now will we hear the sound of shattered shields?
And will we stand our grounds till the end?

[Chorus]
To the world that I've seen,
Fulfill your oath to lord and land
I can't take it anymore,
Same fear that would take the heart of me!
