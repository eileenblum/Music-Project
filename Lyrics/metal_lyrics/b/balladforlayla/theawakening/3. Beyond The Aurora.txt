I am so amazed, by thy beauty, why can we not see?
Are we blinded by the lies we've been fed?
Hear he howls her name, hear it out loud and become one with,
With the fear that spreads among the living.
Every night, he crawls into your arms.
But never once he reach the sky!

You've showed the blind, their fate! Caught in between hell and back!
I should've known!
In all it's wrath, like a plague it spreads. (Eradicating)
I should've known, I should've known, what lies beyond the aurora!

[Verse]
What a tangled web we weave, when we first practice to deceive.
(Practice to deceive)
True love's the gift which God has given, to man alone beneath.
To man alone beneath (the heaven)

[Bridge]
The heaven is where we should be,
If you wouldn't tell, and I didn't ask.

[Chorus]
Hearken to me, hearken to me!
I should have listened to you.
Hearken to me, hearken to me.
Is what I should have, should have done.

Nightmare began to spread amongst the living.
Amazed by thy beauty and yet, terrified.
In all it's wrath, like a plague it spreads. (Eradicating)
I should've known, I should've known, what lies beyond the aurora!

[Verse]
What a tangled web we weave, when we first practice to deceive.
(Practice to deceive)
True love's the gift which God has given, to man alone beneath.
To man alone beneath (the heaven)

[Breakdown]

If I'm not mistaken, we should be there.
But not with, this burden, your agony.
The rises where we should be heading now,
We should be heading now!

We have been fooled, been fooled in our own web.
We're too blind to see the light.

[Chorus]
Hearken to me, hearken to me!
I should have listened to you.
Hearken to me, hearken to me.
Is what I should have, should have done.

[Solo]
