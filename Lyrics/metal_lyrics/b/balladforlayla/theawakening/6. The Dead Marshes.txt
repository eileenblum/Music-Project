WE!
Live for tomorrow.
The air we breathe, full of lies.
Never knew how much blood has been, spilled.
For the kingdom we live in, for the youth that we are.

Our heart is our strength, all we have to do, live for tomorrow.
And we may not know what, awaits us for the future.

[Chorus]
And now we're living their dreams, we are their legacy.
In time we'll learn that we'll risk no hurt to this world.
And now we're living their dreams.
Even if it takes great pain to endure.

With this I fear no death.
Nor the veiling shadows in the west.
This santuary will be my last stand!

Wisdom beyond our reach.
The darkness dwells within.
The eyes of the dead, reeks upon this curtain.
Evil were once vanquished by them, our ancestors.
Is this how we honor them? Darkness shall not prevail.

[Chorus]
And now we're living their dreams, we are their legacy.
In time we'll learn that we'll risk no hurt to this world.
And now we're living their dreams.
Even if it takes great pain to endure.

I FEAR NO DEATH!

[Solo]

Let's run towards the sunset,
And I will catch you if you ever fall,
I won't leave you behind.
(And we're living their dreams,
We are the last of their legacy!
Until the end of time!)

(Live! Live for tomorrow!
We're living their dreams, we are their legacy!
Live for tomorrow! We are their legacy!)
