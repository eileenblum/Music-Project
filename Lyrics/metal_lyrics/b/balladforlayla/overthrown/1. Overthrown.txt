This dream has consumed me
Separates me from what I am
And what I've become inside
This place where darkness dwells
My will be done

I've been waiting for an eternity
For this I've been counting the days
And the sins I've done
You've tried to extract the essence of life
You've tried to conquer us all
But you've failed
Your arrogance blinds you

Have you not seen the end of your reign?
Have you not marked the flush of fear?
The crimson red sky will burn the deepest sin in your skin
The deepest sin in your skin
The deepest sin in your skin
The deepest sin in your skin

You stink of fear
Isn't this what you have conjured?

Have you not seen the end of your reign?
Have you not marked the flush of fear?
Isn't this what you have conjured for so long?

[2x]
I will bring you down with the strength of a lion!

Have you not seen the end of your reign?
Have you not marked the flush of fear?
Isn't this what you have conjured for so long?

[2x]
Have you not seen the end of your reign?
Have you not marked the flush of fear?

I will bring you down with the strength of a lion!

You have stared death right into its eyes
But that was just a lie
We've been deceived by your third eye, your third eye

This dream has consumed me
Separates me from what I am
And what I've become inside
This place where darkness dwells
My will be done

I will now bring you down
