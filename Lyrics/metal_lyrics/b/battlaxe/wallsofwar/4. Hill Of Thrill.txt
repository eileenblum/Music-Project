Granting self inhumation as gesture to be free
Giving their souls donation re-spawn beneath the tree
Worship the master created aside the promised land
Massive sacrifice operated awaiting his commands

Kill kill kill commands that will
Lead us to the hill of thrill
Fully loaded brain cells ill
Infection overkill

Echoed nameless spirit swept by misleads
Boosting illusions its merit brainwashing is your treat
Pursuing divine deception on a long term lifespan
Force self into redemption it's something already planned

Kill kill kill commands that will
Lead us to the hill of thrill
Fully loaded brain cells ill
Infection overkill

Repent before your time kicks in
Releasing your soul from passive sins
Cover your body with the dress of hell
Ensure your ablution passing well
Swirling around the temple of hate
Blind ambition with endless debate
Sense of logic hard to locate
Fairy tales and the guardian of the gate
