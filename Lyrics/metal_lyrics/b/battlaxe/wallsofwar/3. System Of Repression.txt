Dastard
Convinced to dominate the fuck'n war
Mjolnir hammer crowd fall
Thirsty to invade the human race

Heathens
Riding the storm with no fear
Awaiting the attack to reveal
Day will turn into night
Now you're down to your knees
Now you're down to your knees

Choking souls is totally pleasure

Hatred
Electrifying atmosphere
Smell of darkness so near
It's time for Satan to reveal ha ha
Warfare
Evil's plague invaded in their mind
Humanity sent to grind
All your memories will float
Down in the rivers of blood

Actions
Declaration pursuing human rights
No fleeting no light
Show no mercy this night

Illusions infused by injection
To cure the mortals objection
Advanced hypnosis for brains
To stable your metal restrain
