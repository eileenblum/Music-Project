Walking down the street
Hiding behind the walls
Of Jasper and concrete
Trying not to fall

Looking for a shelter to
Hide my inner fear
The sound of rotten flesh
Cracks my ringing ear

Running in the shadow
With all of my fear
Sound of my death
Almost so near
Walls and gates
Almost so clear
Am I ready to fight?

Throwing my worst fear
From the demon eyes
Sharply cutting my last tear
To free the horrify

Gathering all my power
And anger to attack
Slashing swords devour
All the evil rack

Walls of War
Walls of War
Walls of War
Walls of War

And we're all gathered
At the walls of war
Walls of war yaw

Running in the shadow
With all of my fear
Sound of my death
Almost so near
Walls and gates
Almost so clear
Am I ready to fight?

Seeking for deliverance
In the middle of destruction
Awaiting the holy power
Faith lost all connections
Escaping from reality
In the meantime
One way to survive
Ha-ha hell awaits

Running in the shadow
With all of my fear
Sound of my death
Almost so near
Walls and gates
Almost so clear
Am I ready to fight?
Ha-ha hell awaits
