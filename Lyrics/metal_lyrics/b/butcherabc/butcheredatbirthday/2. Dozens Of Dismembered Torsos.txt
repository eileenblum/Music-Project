bloodied, torn and twisted
severe mutilation us
onto the mortuary slab

dozen of dismembered torsos
buried six feet under

exhumed, consume to exhume
I devour the pediculous corpse

dead, corpse, deceased
I'm proud, I am necrophagia

rotting corpses I munch
dismembered torsos are my lunch
on bones I love to crunch
slavering to the pungent stench
