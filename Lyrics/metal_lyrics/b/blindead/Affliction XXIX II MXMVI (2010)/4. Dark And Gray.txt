Nights dark beyond darkness and the days more gray
Each one than what had gone before
Dust and ash everywhere. Charted and limbless trunks of
Trees stretching away on every side
Ash moving over the road and the sagging hands
Of blind wire strung from the blackened lightpoles
Whining thinly in the wind
The shape of a city stood in the grayness
Like a charcoal drawing sketched across the waste
Nothing to see the cold and the silence
If only my heart were stone. No sign of life.
The blackness she woke to on those nights
Was sightless and impenetrable
A blackness to hurt your ears with listening
No sound but the wind in the bare and blackened trees
She rose and stood toffering in that
Cold autistic dark with her arms
Out held balanceâ¦
For fallingâ¦
For fallingâ¦
For fallingâ¦
