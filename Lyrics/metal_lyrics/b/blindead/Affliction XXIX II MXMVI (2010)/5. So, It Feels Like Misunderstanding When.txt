Leaving the chaos behind straight paths lead me far away beyond the mountain of pain
Endless journey
To the place of peace
I can reach the shining stars
I can reach the burning sun
It's my paradise asylum
Kingdom of me
Kingdom of purity
It's my paradise asylum!
Reflections in the mirrors smiling at me!
One colored rainbow summoning the light
Delusional perspective falling apart!
