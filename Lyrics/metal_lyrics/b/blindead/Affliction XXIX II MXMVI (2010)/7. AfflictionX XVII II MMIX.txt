One careless conception
One life created
Unlucky strange day
One father, one mother
One worse than the other
One sick of anger
One disease and one dysfunction
One maltreatment, and malfunction
One child
Sensitive mind
One broken tree
Life taken away
One escape
Terrible price to pay
One coffin
One grave
One priest and one word to say

Well, I shall have to stay here forever and ever
Well, I shall have to stay here forever and ever

I fall into the sea of my own tears
Of my own tears
Affliction
I pray for your souls
Affliction
Affliction
Afflictionâ¦
