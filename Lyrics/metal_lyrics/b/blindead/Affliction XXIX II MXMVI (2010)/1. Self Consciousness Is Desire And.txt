Slowly crawling on my mind
It was growing in my head
It was always in my head
Craving I cannot ignore
Slowly growing in my heart
Tension like insanity
Figures of life arise!
Let the human crawl
In passion through shadow and light
To gather obsession
Sensuality
Erotic tale gets details
Hidden drawings
All the world dreams are in this picture
And so
Complicity
Celebrates
Brad new existence
Matter, space and timeâ¦
Constructing the world
Consuming the life
Constructing the time
Matter, space and timeâ¦
