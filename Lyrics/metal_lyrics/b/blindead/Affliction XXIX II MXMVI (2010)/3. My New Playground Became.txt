My life begins again
I wish it would never end
Mommy, I'm here for you
Daddy, I'm next to you
You fear me more and more
Pity and cruelty
Sunk in dark misery
God, how the stars did fall?
You never speak my name
The eyes oddly Innocent
I'm bleeding out my tears
Locked in my sanity
Unable to stand against
Pointless violence
Counting and setting things in order
To be constant is my true form
Incapacity towards this stale
Rotten world drives me to create a new entity
I dream of coming back to the matrix, to hide
To cuddle
To dream and fall in love with
The warmth and paralyzing unconcern
