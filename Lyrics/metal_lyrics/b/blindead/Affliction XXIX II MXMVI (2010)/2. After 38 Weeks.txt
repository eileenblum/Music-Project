Muted, distant, unrecognizable soundsâ¦
The city, the people, the kitchen, the bathroom,
Places I managed to recognize
After several days
But not by smell
I can't smell anything
It feels like I'm not breathing
My sense of taste also ruthlessly vanished somewhere
The last thing I had in my mouth left a metallic aftertaste
But it was ages ago
I see nothing
Gravity is nonexistent
Where the hell am I?
Impulse how did it happen?
Nothingness
Why can't I remember who I am, what I am?
After a minute I realize I don't remember anything
What was yesterday, what's today?
I'm suspended in a smudgy, fuzzy, vague, obstinate nothingness
I'm swallowed, my world shrinked
And keeps getting smaller like it's trying to devour me
Then again I have a strong sense of assured safety
