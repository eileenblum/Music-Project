Hear me

Silence plays a role in a process of damage
Impulse of my inner-self indicates my flashbacks
Rhythm, such a slowly sonic flow of destruction
Sound, that makes my body rapture

Hear me
To make this possible

With another heart attack I crawl on my knees
To make this happen
With another heart attack I crawl on my knees
To make you happy

My mind
Myself
My pulse inside
Impulse

Leave me here
Just leave me here...
