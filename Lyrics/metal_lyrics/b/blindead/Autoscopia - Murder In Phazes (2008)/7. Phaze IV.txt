I must wear a mask
with a face in my hands I am drowning in smoke.
Painting your lips with sins and sick guilt

Into dreams I run achieving desiring calm
I am floating in steam
I experience hallucinations but I am convinced they are justified
exploring your soul
forget
forget what I have done and REST
forget and rest...

by monumental drums
I walk
by hypnotizing words
I swim
by monumental drums
I walk
by hypnotizing WORDS

INTO FREEDOM
INTO FREEDOM

by monumental drums
by hypnotizing words
by monumental trance
I have my OWN heaven in my mind

FREEDOM
FREEDOM
FREEDOM
