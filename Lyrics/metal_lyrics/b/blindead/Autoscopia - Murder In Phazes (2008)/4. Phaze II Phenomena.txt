Bleeding Through.... my Scars
I'm save Now........my chilling Gods
Reach out........to come out
oh my chilling Gods

my intense images
laughing and dying
hysterical depression
soul on drugs waiting for overdose
character disorder soul on drugs waiting for overdose nailed to the cross of impotence

fears and doubts
united against
becoming in shape
hating and spitting

identify
abnormal
specify
condition

it seems there is no
escape from This

it seems there is no
escape from This
