Never ending highways
are extended gutters
and the gutters are full of scarlet
time grinding clock is devouring
my alcoholic freedom

drop by drop
minute after minute
surrounding
echoes

hollow river is burning
eyelids
and there is nothing to SEE
hollow river is burning
eyelids
and there is nothing to SEE
hollow river is burning
eyelids
and there is nothing to SEE
NOTHING

silent
being
become
stronger
inhumane

artificial mind
I have constructed
become more dominate
every passing day
such a radical change
