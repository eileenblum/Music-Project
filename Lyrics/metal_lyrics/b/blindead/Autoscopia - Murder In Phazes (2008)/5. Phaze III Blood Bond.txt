Seal me
Seal Me in you
For I have structured
my spirit in cascades of flowing molecules
Seal me now for this is what your regressed mind is absolutely dreaming of

Invite my essence with your lustful wrists and fatigued eyes
so I can teach you how to feel I shall descent you
from your personal asylum into sanctuary of Senses with sweet bitterness
flowing lust
overwhelming calmness let me lead you
to the open horizon of Clarity

And illogical fulfillment
through the sensual deprivation
And illogical fulfillment
Seal Me now and collect chaotic molecules

The foreign wealth
straight into your inward mind
for the pleasure of
Starving life

Invite my essence with your lustful wrists and fatigued eyes
so I can teach you how to feel I shall descent you
from your personal asylum into LUST

unless you won't have
ability to feel
lust
unless you won't have
ability to feel
lust unless you have ability to feel lust
