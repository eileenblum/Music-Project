The Curtain is Up
Naked Thoughts approaching
Mind is Calling
Sands of Time
Headache Grows
please take me
The Beginning
Feeling Warm
Affected
Pain is like a Perfect Symmetry
Over and Over Divided
Unnamed, Unwritten
Undone
Earth
Wind
And Fire
Walls are Closing in
Walls Are closing in
Worlds are Closing IN

Facing Truth with The Boiling Blood
Journal of Pain is Written
Cluster Headache Lack of Relation
Facing Truth with The Boiling Blood
