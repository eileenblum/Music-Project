With Helplessness I Cursed God...
and Wept in Terrible Silence
Everything I Loved
And Everything I Lived For...
Gaze into Inverted World Where Drowned Sins are Cycling
Deranged by Agony
madman staring back At Me

...born from oblivion, bear the children hellbound
as ourselves, go into oblivion and God was not there.
Cold overwhelming dark goes on forever and we are alone...

Rotten
Timeless
Misdirect

never pretend it does not exist

Mother
Shadow
Spiral

never pretend you seen this one before

I see Them Bursting Into flame
I see them One by One
Limbless bodies will fall by Shapeless Ghosts pushed into Abyss.
