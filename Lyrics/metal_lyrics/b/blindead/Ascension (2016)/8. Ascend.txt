Sun, praised is your might
Look what they've done to my eyes
Wash them with your light
And grant me your guidance
For I am blind
Make me
Ascend
Among
Stars
To earn your grace I will kneel
To earn your love I'll disappear
Further than sky lies the great beyond
The place I will dwell at your side

Take me to the night sky to the dark, cold, black beyond
Take me to the night sky where entity is redefined
Take me to the stars
