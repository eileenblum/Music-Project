Blackened are the wastelands after the flood
My heart ran cold after I saw what damage you've done
Devil on my shoulder whispers in my ear
Choirs of angels are silent as they all disappear
And I've embraced all this knowledge
And I raised the tower
Up to the skies that I've challenged
A tower which cannot be sunk
I dare you to look at me now
Standing both bold and proud
See me atop the testimony to my will
I stand proud
Over you
But the you went jealous
Over the stronghold I raised
So you've twisted our tongues
'Cause ruining is all that you do
I dare you look at me now
Standing both bold and proud
As walls start to crumble
I ain't going to hide though
This satisfaction you won't get
I'll be buried beneath
The testimony to my will
