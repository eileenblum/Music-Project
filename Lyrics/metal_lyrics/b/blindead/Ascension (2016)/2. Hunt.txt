Who once was feral, free and wild
Among the birds of prey
Who once had a purpose in his life
Crystal clear vision of himself
Who sang all of sacred hymns of hunt
Yonder worthy is the prize

The planets were aligning
The sky was all binding
Young blood running in the veins
All was in its place

Those hills are burning up the skies
Those skies are falling on the ground
Those walls are closing all around
Those stars are fading one by one

Break me now
Heal me now
Doom me now
Save me now
