Since you left me I'm lost
In maze full of wonders and awe
Change comes often with a cost
Acknowledged only after the loss

Nights are colder, days are darker
Wind blows stronger, time runs faster
Seasons fading, wounds ain't healing
I am struggling to find you

In this journey signs misleading
Way runs uphill, feet are bleeding
Yet I go on further and further
Pushed by one goal - to find you

No matter what
Until the end
I will hunt
I will search
