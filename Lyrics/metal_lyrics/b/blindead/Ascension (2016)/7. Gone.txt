gone
as tomorrow is only for one of us
I have to swallow this bitter taste of loss
those things that I own I cannot give them back

gone
no tomorrow will arrive for you this time
numb and alone I still follow
throughtout the frozen veil
of a cold white plain
I became a hollow man-like shape

at the and of path
wait there
