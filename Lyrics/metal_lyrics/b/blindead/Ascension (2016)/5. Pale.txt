See those spawning circles on the sea?
Let our hunger burn
Let the cycle last

See those spawning circles on the sea
There it sleeps
It is almost in my reach
See those crimson circles
See?
It bleeds
It's the last piece
I need to be complete

And I know It's somewhere
I can feel its presence
And I know it lurks down there
Underneath the surface

While I slowly down below
Of what's mine I never let it go
The way it pulls me in
Far into the void
Inside of me
