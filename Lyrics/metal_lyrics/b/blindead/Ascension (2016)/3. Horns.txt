Look
All that we ever thought
Those dreams we had
Slowly fading
It's done
There is nothing left
As we freeze in the light
Shadows descending

For all that I have been or could
All that I have never done but should
I rise this cup full of doubts that tear me apart
And accept its content till its bitter end
At its bitter end I find dismay
And I am sick of constantly being judged
For lack of virtues I never really had
'Cause I'm just the typical product of my times
As lost as the rest in this pathway of mine

And may the bridges I've burned forever light my way
As I am slowly approaching the point of no return
It blurs on the horizon, I can already see
As it is collapsing it reflects a mirrored image of me

Look
Again
Behind the tree line
Shadows descending

Look
All that we ever thought
Those dreams we had
Slowly fading
It's done
There is nothing left
We freeze in the light
We embrace out end
