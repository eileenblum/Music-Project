Hold by fear
Broken womb inside
Never heals
Watch my demons spread
Out by fear

Through your tears
I watch you cry all alone
Through your eyes
I cut my wrists so strong
Through your tears
I speak for you my son
Through your mind
I cut my own throat

Memory of loss
Hold by fear
Broken womb inside
Never heals
Watch my demons spread
Out by fear

I need hell
I never did what you said
I need rage
Satisfaction, vengeance
Don't blame me
I'm so imperfect

Memory of loss
Hold by fear

I can see more fire in the sky

Sky...
Sperm...
Stab...
