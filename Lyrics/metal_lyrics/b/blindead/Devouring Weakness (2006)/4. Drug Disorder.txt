Bleed forever
Cold...
Broken...
Destiny...

Lighting in my head
Watch me fall
Pain of harvest grows
My soul is a storm

Skin and leather...
Cold...
Victim...
Misery...
Bleed on feather
Slain...

Lighting in my head
Watch me fall
Pain of harvest grows
My soul is a storm

Overdose,
Confusion,
Sanity

Pure disease,
Infection,
Euphoria.

Unknown relief.
Drug disorder.
