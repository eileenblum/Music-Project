Feel that
In the deepest
Darkness
Of Despair
Feel
Somewhere deep inside
I'm gonna end up what I've tried

Visions
Dark suicidal visions

Can't regain
Balance
How can I
Stay alive
When my brain is trying to kill me?

Visions
Dark suicidal visions

Walk in the dark
Cry for help
One more time...

Memory of Loss
Through your tears
I watch you bled all alone
Through your eyes
I cut your wrists so long
Through your tears
I speak for you my unborn
Through your mind
I cut your throat wide...open
