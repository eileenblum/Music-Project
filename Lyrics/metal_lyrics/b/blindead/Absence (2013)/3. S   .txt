I.
I can speak again, 
Call you

I. 
Forsaken, fading, ailing, void

I am afraid now

I.
The great bear drowning in the sand 
And reaching out

I,
The one of endless sentiments

I want to see, to be unchained

I, a temple in the tempest
I, once desired, haunted with eternal plague
I, ready to swear no evil or pain can ever dwell in me

I am leaving

I,
White, ethereal, 
Rising from the desert sands 
Craving for wanderers
Silent sounds full of inward decay

I am holding out a hand

I, a temple in the tempest
I, once desired, haunted with eternal plague
I, ready to swear no evil or pain can ever dwell in me

I am leaving
