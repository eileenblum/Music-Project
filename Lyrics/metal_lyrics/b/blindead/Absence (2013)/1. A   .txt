Once upon a midnight dreary, 
While I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore -

While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, 
Doubting...

While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, 
Rapping at my chamber door

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor

Dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before
