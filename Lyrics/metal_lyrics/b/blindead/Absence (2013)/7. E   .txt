You have waited eons to meet us
Rising up high with your peaks touching the clouds
Caressing them
You made the sky smile

'Tis this blackness that affected you so
As no one feels safe in the dark
And children in the least
Darkness is like a dreary and absymal slope of defeat

Like the stone foals racing through the black ocean waves

Emerging from a dreadful and ceaseless hall
Where the air is heavy with broken promises
That crashed down on a liar's head
With the flutter of wings

Like the stone foals racing through the black ocean waves 

The noise of hidden machinery begins to gradually disturb you...

You
Who turn rage into creation
Covered with
Dust
Ice
And lava

You 
Entombed by ghosts 
Buried by reflections
