She was always the one and only
Strong
Proud
A mount of stone amid countless stares
She, always lost in reflection so deep and distant, vaguely disturbing
She, whose gist is hard to define

Wanted to be properly understood
Consistently lost in a long and stubborn slumber

She...

The wolf mother
Full of concern
And endless vigor
Utterly sublime

The finger of death across her chest
The fear of the grave rising dreadfully
Devoid of children, through tears she spoke of ultimate conversion

And the destroyer came and left her nailed

She was fading slowly 
Drifting back to her original solemn silence, 
Her extraterrestrial scarlet evanescing 
Leaving gray debris full of memories of unconditional love

Tangled coils writhing quietly and dispersing
In the shadows of the rocky throat 
The pearl gravel resting peacefully in its eternal place
Forever casting its light

Forever casting its light
