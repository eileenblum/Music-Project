You were the life...
My anonymous philharmonic
All of my notes I composed for you
For you were the music

You were the sound
I dreamed on throughout the wars
And you absorbed and stifled tears
Misfortunes and changes

But you failed to feel me
For you were all unchanged
Talking about the same old things in the same old way

'Twas you who brought the rusty wheel,
That defines what has been left of me
You changed my spirit and you cast a spell on me
Heavy breathing and piercing howl coming from the riverside

You changed my spirit and you cast a spell on me
Heavy breathing and piercing howl coming from the riverside
And my streets were carved with the blood
And the days of evil came

You and your filthy image
Your treacherous eyes filled with vermin and tempest
Thoughts that struggled with wisdom

You freed the vulture, thus vulture now they call me and vulture I am

You forgot me
I forgot you
