My place
My tomb
Rest with no view of the world
My desire
Stronger than throughout the lifetime

Dominates the forces of nature
Conquers the worlds neatly hidden away from me.
How beautiful it is to destroy one's body...
Devoid of cognition...

To learn
How far
To learn
How far it hurts
To learn
I don't want you

If only there was a way
If but the tiniest spark
Could meet the light.
How wonderful it would be to give it back
To share the taste 
To pass and offer the flame

To be again
To be the origin
To be the death
To be the life
To be myself
To be the God

To be the God
