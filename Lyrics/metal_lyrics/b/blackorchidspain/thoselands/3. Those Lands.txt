I saw those lands
In dreams where no man can walk
But feel sometimes we feel
The unreals sometimes in dreams

I saw those lands
I walked over mountains that touch the sun
But evening sometimes arrives the evening
But evening sometimes in
those lands

I see the falling stars in a eternal sky
I feel the cold wind of a winter night
The night is so silent the moon protects us
Maybe my soul rests from
the world in those lands

I lay in a prairie
I hear a distant sea whispering
I saw a savage land
But storm sometimes the storm
In those lands maybe the storm

In the rage of the skies
I breathe calm
I rest inside the storm my soul
feels sheltered
Maybe those lands are a refuge
for us or maybe
Maybe theyÂ´re only a dream
sometimes maybe

Beyond the clouds the soul will rest
Forever in those lands
