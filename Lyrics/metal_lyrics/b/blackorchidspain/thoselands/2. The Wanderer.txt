I canÂ´t believe this is the day
When light begins to shape
When boats begin to sail
When vikings begin to navigate
Men of the north want to conquer
To set on fire and to plunder
WeÂ´ll conquer until the end of the sky
Odin is on our side

I am the sailor, the warrior
The obstinate, the wanderer
I am the sinner, the plunderer
The traveller

I am the fire, the death too
I am the northern, the wanderer
I am the storm, the wind too
They call me the wanderer

The boat advances across the sea
Dark cloud are over it
The gods will guide our proud steps
Â´till the kingdoms that are our fate
