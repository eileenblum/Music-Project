Here, I stand,
I wait, for you
Thinking, remembering
The times when we danced
Feeling the happiness
Of the first time we met
You arrive, my darling
My beautiful girl

Say that you need me,
that youÂ´ll never leave me
Say that you arenÂ´t crying,
itÂ´s only the rain falling
Say weÂ´ll dance forever,
until the time vanishes us
together
But donÂ´t say the truth,
donÂ´t say this is our last dance

I touch your hand
Slowly, shivering
We start the dance

We dance over seas
We dance over dreams
With you I feel
The serenity, the eternity

As the winter we are
the nocturnal mist
As in winter the frost
devastates our souls
As the winter we are
the snow that falls slowly
As in winter the fury of the
blizzard hits us

I curse heaven and hell
I scream until my voice is gone
I face the sky with rage
in my eyes
I canÂ´t face that IÂ´m alone

I canÂ´t belive youÂ´re gone away...
As the winter youÂ´re
gone away from me...
