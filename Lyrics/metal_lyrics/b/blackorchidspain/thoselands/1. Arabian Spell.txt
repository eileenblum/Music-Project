Distant lands in a sea of sand
A place with remembrances of the past
Dark mixture of energy and elegance
In the walls of mosques and palaces

I donÂ´t know why my dreams
fall to hell
Your spell changed me into a
sick man until the end

Osiris, awaits me
IÂ´ll go to the dunes with you
WeÂ´ll see the glory of your reign
Now I know the truth
Arabian spell

Snakes and spiders will strike us
We must go to the rising sun

I donÂ´t know why my soul was
trapped in a labyrinth
I feel the pain of madness
in my mind

Save me, my god
Show me the real way, please
Blind me, my god
I only want to believe

Save me, my god
Arabesk inside my head
Blind me, my god
I feel like a freak

I donÂ´t know why my dreams
fall to hell
I donÂ´t know why my soul was
trapped in a labyrinth
