They arrived from a distand land
Came the dark
Like soldiers, they though we
Could attack
They caused a lot of pain
With a blood rain
They hurt us with their lance
We want another chance
No way!

The times of steel arrived
Our lives began to die
Hate screams too loud
Blood is all around
We'll never be the same
Heaven close it's gates
(The) eternal storm explodes
Death sits down in his throne

(The) enemy shot arrows on fire
We threw all balls of sand of mine
Life is our work, but they said we
We have swords
They thought we were a risk
But we only have rocks

No one must be slave
No one must set laws
I'm not to blame
I'm my king likes brawls
No one must kill men
No one replaces god
Peace is now our gem
Murder is not my job
