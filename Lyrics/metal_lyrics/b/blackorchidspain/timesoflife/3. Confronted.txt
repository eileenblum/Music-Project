As I feel the fear inside
I feel you arriving, you come in
I feel your presence advancing now
I know you, you are me

Confronted to the wind
struggle within
Fight until death
Who will win?
Never feeling love
Never getting near
Never hating more
You and me

I'll fight you forever for love and faith, I'll win again
One day the disease will be gone away
And now I'm waiting for your end

I will destroy you
Or you will destroy me
One will die soon
This is our destiny
The gods sent us this curse
In your eyes the flame
I won't rest Â´till you
Are in your grave
