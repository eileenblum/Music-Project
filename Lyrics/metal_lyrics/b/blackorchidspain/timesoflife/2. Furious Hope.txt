In the air we feel it
In the sky we see it
In the soul we have it
The most forious hope

In your eyes I can see it
See the joy and the strength
No one is here to stop us
No one could stop us now

Â´Cos we live for the high gods
Â´Cos we believe
Â´Cos we'd die for the high gods
That's what we feel

It's not the time for unbelievers
It's the time for the bravest of men
Nothing about pain, no more the same
Nothing but honor, pride and faith... inside
