In the sea I feel the air
I see the clouds, the lightnings
I sail on seas of rage
I am always fighting
Go ahead! In the silence

In a time of injustice, Iâm here with all I need
Only liberty and you and me, itâs the only thing I need
Feeling love and agony, feeling life in the air I breathe
Iâm a sailor in the sea

A sword is in my hand
A word describes me: pirate
A tresuare in the sand
A world full of nightmares
