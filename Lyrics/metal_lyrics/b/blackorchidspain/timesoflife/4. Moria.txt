Here we stay at the gates of Moria
All we see is the darkness
We watch a door, the door of Moria
Waiting for a word of hope
Suddently, the door with a word begins to open
And we, begin to see a path behind
And we start to walk to the gate of darkness
But a noise stops our steps, in the lake
In the lake, just in the lake

A beast appears from the water
A creature from the deep
The beast attacks the bearer
The bearer of the ring
I feel the ring so far
So far from Mordor it is
I sent the nine ring wraiths
Just mine the ring will be
We fight against the monster
The monster from the deep
We cross the gates of Moria
The fear now we feel

In the darkness
In the sadness
In the blackest pit

A tragic journey beyond the strangest lands
Only darkness feel our hearts
We see the glory of the reign of mighty dwarfs

In this times of death we feel the end
We hope his soul will rest in the air
Oh! Gandalf, lost in darkness

Now Isengard works
To create the ultimates orcs
Their name is Urukhai
Humans and hobbits will die

We go to the bridge of Moria
The bridge of Khazad-dÃ»m
Gandalf fights the Balrog
Gandalf falls to doom

Time stands still
Here in the bridge
We feel the same
We feel the pain and rage
Slowly we start to react
To Gandalf's death
We feel the same
Feel pain and rage

In this mines we lost
The must beloved friend
Gandalf fell for us
Fell for middle-earth
In this times of glory
In this times of death
Only faith will save us
In the end
