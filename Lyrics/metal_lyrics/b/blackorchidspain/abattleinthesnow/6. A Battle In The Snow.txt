Scotland, winter land, snowing over us
The king watches, warriors wait for the start of war
We stand on the hill, we stand in silence
We pray, pray to the gods, Thor and Odin
The Celts are on the other hill screaming
They scream for our death they are waiting
We start, start to descend, to the valley
The Celts, the Celts wonât see, see another day

The snow is turning, turning red
I shout a curse to the sky
Dying, dying, a thousand men
Only the brave will live

At the end of the battle we stay in silence
We pray, we pray to the gods,
Thor and Odin
The Celts, the Celts lie, they lie in hell
We pray, we pray to the gods,
Thor and Odin

War. Savage, destructive war
Warriors bleeding, swords clash
Celts and vikings are a mass of hate and blood
Only the brave will live
