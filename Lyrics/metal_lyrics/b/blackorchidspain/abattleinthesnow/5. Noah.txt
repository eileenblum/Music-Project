God warned the men of an era of darkness
Only a man obeyed him, the rest remained in madness
In the silence, one heared
In the silence, one believed

God sent a sign to the chosen one
God showed him a light, a light in the dark
In the silence, one worked
In the silence, in the silence of the
Times, times before the times

The sky began to darken
Light dissapeared from the world
The seas began to wave
The clouds began to roar

From the sky / began to fall
Rain and rain / fall and fall

The storm flooded the earth
Deserts, forests and seas
The punishment was done
The end made them believe

That Noah saw
From the ark
The loud thunder

The death cleaned one thousand souls
The earth was purged
Man had a new age
But no one forgot what Noah saw
