Eternal sand, suffocating heat,
weared stones /Hail the enslaver
Wicked land, land sentenced
by the gods /Hail the slayer
See the power of the sorcerer-kings
/Hail the desecrater
Feel the power of the fear
/Hail the sorcerer-king
/Hail the one who kills
In the middle of the desert is the city of Tyr
Hail the defiler
City of our god, the sorcerer-king,
Kalak is /Hail the sorcerer-king

Why our people have to be slave of a tyrant?
Why our people have to be the toy of a despot?

Hear the legend of a land consumed by a mad god
A land of winds and sand,
a land of wild and proud men
hear the glorious beast fly in the sky, the dragon of Tyr
See his eyes full of hate towards men, âcause he was one of them

Slowly the slaves carry the stones
They serve me, their god with their blood
Slowly the Zigurat begins to form
It will change me into a dragon
I will kill all the citizens of Tyr
Their death will give life to me

This is the end of one thousand years of slavery
This is the day when tyr will be liberated
The sorcerer-king must die if his reign we want to end
Tyranny must end today is the day

The city now is free
Tyr is free now
