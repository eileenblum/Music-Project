Dark clouds in the sky
I died the last time
The sorrow buried my mind
I have no life
To win is only a dream
In this world of them
Raining and raining again
I donât see my fate

Liberty, we are all looking for you
I lost you, I need you
Bravery, without you all is wrong
I lost you, I need you
Honesty, you are the truth of the world
I lost you, I need you
Liberty, bravery, honesty
I lost you, I need you

We are playing roles, in this lucky life
Blood in your eyes, why canât I forgive?
I am alone, alone in this sea
I am sure of just nothing

When I look into my soul I see only pain
Iâm in chains, without god I can only wait
Teachings from childhood,
communions and baptisms, itâs all so far away
Empty cathedrals, closed churchs,
we live without faith
