nside me I can hear a melody
of death and destruction
remembering eternally a time
of my life I canât forget
Treacherous memories
lost in the past,
unbalanced desire of going back
Strange miseries born from
the dark are screaming

in the dawn
In the dawn I forgot my name
Eternal sigh that shows my pain
In the dawn I forgot my name
Mortal reflection that happens again

Again and again and againâ¦
