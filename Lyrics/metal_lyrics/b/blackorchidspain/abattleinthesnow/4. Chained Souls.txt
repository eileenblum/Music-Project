I waited at the top of the mountain
I felt the cold wind in my face
I saw you appearing from the mist
We met again, yeah

Weâll be forever in chains
Weâll be always
Youâll be forever, girl, my chain

I felt the same feeling again
When I saw you under the rain
I knew that Iâd love you always
I knew it when I saw you, yeah

Iâll go to hades, Iâll go to hell
If that way youâll get to be with me,
I swear
Chained souls we will be again
Iâll be with you, Iâll be always

I felt that years hadnât gone by
At least for the both of us
I felt that I had another chance
It wasnât the last dance, yeah

There is no way for me to be with you
No one cares for this except me
Iâll spend my lifetime loving you
I donât have another way to live

I feel the fire / I feel you, girl
I feel the ice / I feel you, girl
I feel desire / I feel you, girl
I feel you again, girl
