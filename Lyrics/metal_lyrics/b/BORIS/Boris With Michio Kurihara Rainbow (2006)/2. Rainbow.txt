Something continuous that connects grey scenes
Something blurred that is off-frame, illuminating tones
You are looking at the sky that is going to be shakier

Something swing that could be a pendulum
Something dark that is deteriorating, illuminating tones
Raindrops are falling, and touching you
Flicking off the droplets gently, feeling the breeze
We'll have the same colours

Flood of colours that replaces the grey scenes
An amplified swing that blows up the tones

Without touching, could I ever chance?
When will it be, could I ever tell?
Without touching, could I ever change?
Raindrops are gaining colours
Flicking off the droplets gently, feeling the breeze
We'll be looking at the same sky
