This is what you told me last night
"I saw Jimi Hendrix while he was alive..."
"Well, you know, three times at least"
"...and Cream, too" Yeah! Yeah!

ABC, it's your bare
ABC, Big Peach that's shakin'
Why not turn the fader up to eleven, man?
Boost up the EQ as well

That's ill communication
Not audible, as if

ABC, when short of sugar
ABC, Big Peach that's tremblin'
Why not buy up all these donuts?
Drink up that Coke as well

ABC, it's your bare
ABC, Big Peach that's shakin'
Your body knows every-fuckin'-thing
You're our rock 'n' roll teacher
So to speak

Let us shake tonight's show
Let us shake your Peach
