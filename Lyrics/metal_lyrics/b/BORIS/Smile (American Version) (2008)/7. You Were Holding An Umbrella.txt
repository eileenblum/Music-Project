I saw beads of rain running down on your umbrella, wondering when I could tell you
that I was hoping you would see everything in your dream. In a dream I am waiting,
and when I open my eyes to find out you aren't there. In a rain I am still waiting with my
eyes wide open so as not to be waken from this dream. I am dreaming of your wet hair
sticking onto your face, or drenched shoulder and fixed eyes that are gazing
When I catch your fingers reaching me, I can superimpose my dream in my dream.
I had a dream of you, blaming me. You were pointing your fingers at my eyes.
You blamed me in my dream. Always you laughed at my eyes.
The leaden sky conceals colors, making someone look down who isn't afraid of rain
The rain of betrayal sinks the dream. The whirl is taller than me, at which I make a
scream. I get swallowed, and carried away. I can't see anymore. Where's the umbrella
gone? I can't see. I hear a voice, deep inside. I'm going to search for you.
I hear a voice, and when I finally find it, my dream would come true.
