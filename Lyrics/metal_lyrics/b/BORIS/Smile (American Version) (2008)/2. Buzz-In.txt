Ah, how I adore this hair-do, it's blown up!
The gloves are high up, how I shiver and quiver!
Now, I am here to show my love and allegiance,
hurry up, go and dance to the ear-splitting sound!
Lesson two!
BUZZ-IN, the guitarist has his pocket turned out and shown
BUZZ-IN, he wears a purple bikini, and he has two sticks sticking out
of it, on his right and left
Here comes a big mosh!
"OMG, the music hasn't started yet!"
Can't resist this vibration
Can't resist this vibration
Can't resist this vibration
Can't resist this vibration
Yeah it rocks my ribs
Yeah it crashes my ribs
Yeah it rocks my ribs
Yeah it crashes my ribs
"You know, Joe was wearing a witch hat!"
