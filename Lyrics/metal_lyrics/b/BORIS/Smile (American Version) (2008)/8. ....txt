She is destined to fall and fester while whispering,
a sweaty woman.
The usual tactics, her second nature,
She is inviting me on the game board.
No use doubting any more,
just can't resist and get abducted,
Let me be inside, tight-closed,
with the square grids filled up, this will never be completed
Forbidden beings, the game begins, tumble of the dice
She spurs me. She makes me get some more speed.
Have just buried all the distress in the scnet of the skin
Have just realized everything has been assimilated
Ah, never know what happened, Am so Complicated.

Additional Musicians:

Stephen O'Malley - Guitar on "..."
