Totally dried out, even tears are no more.
They were singing a song, they were sand-coloured, they were left behind.
Where did they go? Where's the sorrow that bloomed over me?
He's singing for more than ten decades, is this right? He knows or he knows not,
nobody knows for sure. But it suddenly turned out true. It is now officially true. They plan
it, and he's besieged by countless nights, and it sucks him dry. Yeah it's as if the world
has sucked him dry. The wind feels heavy. They say now he looks like the night. His face,
well, the worlds have become stars, being blamed for all of this, is this right?
NO.
Totally dried out, nothing comes out of me. Nothing it can do for me, I've got to bury the
darkness. Even when I'm doing it. I get thirstier and thirstier. But there is no darkness left to
be painted over. Well, you know what I mean.
Morning light. How I wish for it.
You know what I mean.
Where does the sound come from, they wonder and look out.
They strain their ears to catch it.
DRIED OUT. What can be seen?
DRIED OUT. What are you watching?
HE'S OUT THERE, and shows a smile.
When the morning comes, they will...
