You want some pain, you get it tonight
It eats up your mind, the trap of darkness
Shout it out! No way! You are chained
and you are tame, until you overcome the pain
You've got to crush the darkness named control
You've got to destroy the darkness named system
You're chained and manipulated
You're driveling, being kissed by the pain
For it, you've got the rock 'n' roll
The roll of thunder, thirst for pain,
it evokes the dizzy sensation
You've got to kill the darkness named isolation
Hear the roam, get yourself free
The pain, it's always stalking you
The pain, it's got to be overcome
Let it go, the fang of volume, here! Let it go, the fang of volume, now!
Let it go, the fang of volume, here! Let it go, the fang of volume, now!
