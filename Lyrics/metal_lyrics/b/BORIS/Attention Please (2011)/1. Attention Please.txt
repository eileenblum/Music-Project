Why not take this airline?
Ah, take me to you, to heaven
That overweight, red luggage
Pretend not to see it, let it through

Attention please

The flight is delayed due to fog probably
I'm just waiting, looking at the chairs
One by one, the passers-by are heading to the gates
I'm tracing the patterns on the carpet with my toe

You're just looking at me and toying me
This me, fragile me

Woo, so heavy
Woo woo, about to fall apart
Woo woo, about to fall apart
Woo, so heavy

Want to board
Want to board (onto you)
Why not board (onto me)
Want to board

Ah...Gate Heaven
Ah...Gate Heaven
Ah...Gate Heaven

Attention please
