I found a ripped ear on the floor 
This must be yours 
I found the sand stained dark red 
But still now you must be dancing 
I'm here far from you and I'm thinking of you 

On this empty forlorn dance floor 
You're crazily dancing crying and wailing 
There is no music to be heard or is there any? 
I am on the edge of the earth 
The sky is burning red and is being shaken 

You're dancing something is missing 
I'm thinking of you who is missing 

The deafening sound is here to flood 
You're seeing this the roar is deafening 

Is here to overwhelm you 
Is just here to overwhelm you
