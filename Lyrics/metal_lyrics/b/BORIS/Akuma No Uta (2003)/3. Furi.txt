I want to know
about your weary remembrance
I want to sneak
around your obsession

I already know
about your shaking remembrance
I've already got
to your obsessed innermost

stab, fabrication, breach
sob, falsification, betrayal
stab, fabrication, breach
sob, falsification, betrayal

five hundreds patches for misunderstandings
onto your organized remembrance
entangled and tucked
"concreteness" turns the doorknob
just a little and break with familiarity
with ease

stab, fabrication, breach
sob, falsification, betrayal
stab, fabrication, breach
