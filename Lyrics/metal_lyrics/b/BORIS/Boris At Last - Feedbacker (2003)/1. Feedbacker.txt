[English translation:]

Crisis leaves beautiful remains / yesterday appeared in a dream / touched the dazzling omen // the end of the signs of the end / rolling beginnings of everything // overlapping landscape of escaping water / reflects a soft, uncertain figure / but it is here and it is there // the season of the fang that forgot the choice strikes [?] / collected exploding dust becomes the world // an infinite world / lives to infinity.
