On a light-filled hill that has never been visited
You've just looked up at
...the blue sky, for instance
You adore it, you dance

Into the distance...
Panting, singing
Along the ridge line that is ablaze with flowers
You are tracing

Show me more
I'd like to watch it for ever
Show me what bliss is
Soak me with your blissful smile

You can just try and fly there

Until you reach there
Away, away, far away
And tell me about the scent of the wind

You're gradually finding what the world is for you
While chasing the thing awaiting for you

And I'm watching you right here

Playing with the light
All the while
Tiny wings
With clear eyes

Fly, fly away
