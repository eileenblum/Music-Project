Crystalized and dispersed
Ah, the sigh
Crystalized and dispersed
Ah, the sigh

Freeze, in a second
Freeze, even the words

Crystalized and dispersed
Ah, the sigh
"Where has it gone?"
He said to me

The world stands still, crystalized

Crystalized and dispersed
Ah, the sigh
"Where has it gone?"
He said to me

Another dialogue that is broken up
Penetrated by the icicle that is sharp

Crystalized and dispersed
Ah, the sigh
Ah, stillness
We are alone

When it's gone, you don't expect
That it's gone for good; it will be back in time

Icicle, ah...
