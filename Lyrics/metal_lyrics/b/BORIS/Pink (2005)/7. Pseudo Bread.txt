Mornin' and dizzy
Shaken and awaken
Not such a good start
my head not very clear
Starvin' and lookin'
Kicken' at these empty boxes
Where's my cereal? No room for cherry-pickin'.
Crampin' reason
Floodin' guesses
Here's the pseudo-bread
Puttin' it on a chipped plate
I've eaten the side I can see
What's inside? Not yet
I line of glasses, you're made to buy them.
Who made you buy them? With these designs that everyone knows.
Shut the fuck up, I already knew that!
(the water in the glass goes silent)
Shut the fuck up, I already knew that!
(The water in the glass spills out.)
You think you see, well what do you see?
It's me that I see now
"Generally" is doubtin'
"Basically" is betrayed
"Better than nothing" is not fun
I've eaten the side I can't see
What's inside? Insane butter
La la la, betrayed it.
