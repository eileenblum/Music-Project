[Music: Hirax, Psycho, Lyrics: Mortis]

Many people are dying
The others are afraid of
It is only here, in fuckland
Every day you live in fuckland
Born in fuckland
Die in fuckland
Homeless in canals
Dead by dawn
Murderers in the streets
It is only here, in fuckland
Slowly we rot
A skull full of maggots
Each man to dies
Of natural death
You are listening
To politic stenchers
Remains of justice
Lunatics of politic
It is only here
In our fuckland
