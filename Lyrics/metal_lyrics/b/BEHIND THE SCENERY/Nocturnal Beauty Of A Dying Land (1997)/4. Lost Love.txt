I'm sitting here alone
Remembrance is my wife instead of you
Remembrance is the mirror of my soul
I'm suffering here in the dark
Solitude leads me to insanity
Anguish is a long forgotten friend of mine
Lost love is a reason to cry for
And there is nothing
Nothing what allays the pain
Inside of my heart
The stabbing pain covers my lonely soul
I remember all the days we had
And nothing still remains of you
You have become a memory
And a memory is nothing to live for
Time doesn't heal my wounds
My future - equal to a broken dream
It is time to realize the bitter truth
It is time to realize the blame is on me
I see my future as a deep black hole
I see a black candle burning for me
I stand in front of an abyss and watch my life go by
My time has come to realize the sad and bitter truth
I drown in a sea of sorrow
Feel the fear about tomorrow
Now I lost my love and my soul
Is obsessed by dreams and there is nothing
What allays the pain
Is there really no deliverance for me
Or should I suffer for my sins eternally?
