Someday humanity will be
Unable to form an own view
The price for progress that we shall pay together
Pay with our intelligence and our knowledge
Don't say it's only utopia
The seed is sown
Here
Today
Push the button and believe
Receive your daily injection from the screen
But will you see the retrograte evolution
Of human race which hides behind the lies
With wide open and empty eyes we gaze
Into the screen
Hypnotized by the colourful waves of misinformation
We swallow up the lies and pre-conceptions
Simple human race
What are you today
Simple human race
What will be tomorrow
Technology will control
The confused masses
Progress wil be the new regime
Unable to avert the fast stagnation
We trust in implanted views and drift
Towards the edge of degeneration
Towards the eve of the end
See how the machines get stronger every day
Progress enslaves humanity
Tomorrow we will live in a sad and grey world
Reigned by solitude
Personal communication
Will be unnecessary for mankind
Simple human race
What are your today
Simple human race
What will be tomorrow
Technology will control
The confused masses
Progress will be the new regime
