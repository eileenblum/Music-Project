At nightfall...
The rosy scenery changes
Into a frozen fantasy
Where the fragments of moonlight
Overshadowed by the night
At dusk you fall asleep and awake
In a distant galaxy of dreams
A garden of twilight - bitter delight
A long forgotten path of dreams
Leads through the mountains
Of grow stiff fears
A garden of bitter delight
The nocturnal beauty of a dying land
Casts a spell on you if the firmament obscures
The nocturnal beauty of a dreamland
Takes you into the nightshade
Where you can see your fate
The withering flowers crying your name
On the silent meadows of dreadful dreams
A garden of twilight - bitter delight
At nightfall... the rosy scenery
Changes intro a frozen fantasy
The autumnal forests of shadows hides
In a different cosmos of nightmares
The nocturnal beauty.
