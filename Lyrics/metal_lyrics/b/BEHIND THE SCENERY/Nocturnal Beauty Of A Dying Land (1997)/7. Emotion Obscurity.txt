Dark clowds overcast the sky as I await
The birth of hatred and rage
Born by the dephts of despair
They spread their wings to fly
They spread their wings to flay away
From deep within my hatred rises
A gloomy shadow covers the innocent sky
A monolith of helplessness will overflow me
The burning flame of anger will never die
I drift away...
Dissolution of sanity
A feeling treads out from darkest shade
I drift away...
Emotional obscurity
Hate hides behind hypocrisy
An outburst of rage crushes the shores
Of my mental foundation
You shall be buried
By the fragments of my mind
You shall be burnt by the glowing fire
You will find!
Hate will turn in violence
Harmony is now ablazed
Anger flows through my veins
Hate returns again and again
When my dark phase passes by
I see the ruins of sudden anger
And I cry
Only emotional void remains...
