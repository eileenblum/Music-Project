A vision so mendacious
Transfiguration of the sight

Servant of deception in a cold world

A chemical reaction alters reality
A negative of presence
Where dark becomes light
The unreal garden
Where rotten roses bloom so bright

Kneel to pray
Lost reality
Drifting in a sea of sweet tranquillity

Another disillusion follows an ecstacy
Empire of illusions a distorting mirror
A psychical attraction binds a forlorn soul
Morbid visions deliver from a dreary world

Inject the essence of
A psychodelic bliss
Grip of reality runs away
Through an open vein

Strange philosophy predates the end
Slave of dependency rises to defend
A clouded sky prevents the shine of clarity
False solutions reflected by porosity of mind
