As an origin of all existence...
Spring is mild and pure

Fertile season
Where all life begins to bloom
No clouds disturb the crystal air
No shadows of doubt
Darken the day

Beware the dark destructive winter so cold

Sweet summer - so free from care
The senseless waste
Of a given paradise
The seeds dry up before they start to sprout

In my dreams
I see the children suffer
Under a frozen sun
Where life has dwelt 
And then will be gone

The season of the fall
Earth`s act of revenge

Autumn awakes
And dependence comes clear
The errors made in spring and summer
Time to atone for

Forerunner of winter
Spread incertainty
The golden age, a leaden chain
Ravaged land, toxic water
Death remains

Beware of eternal autumnal leaves

Prepare for the dark
Destructive winter so cold

Clouds of poisonous gasses
Fill the sky
Sun and moon disappear

Forever...
