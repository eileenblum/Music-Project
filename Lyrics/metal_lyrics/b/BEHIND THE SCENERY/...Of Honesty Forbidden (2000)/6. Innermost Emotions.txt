Individual is free -

so it`s seemed to be
Individuality has a lucid body

Invisible eyes so cold
And piercing cut through the flesh

To project the innermost emotions... on a screen

Like words upon a page
Emotions cannot hide
There is no place to crawl
No way to prevent
The constant exchange
Of intimate informations
Pleasure, grief and pain
Occupy inner life

Every mental impulse... perceived by illumination

Individual is free -

observed from within
Directed reactions
Transparency of being

Unobtrusive and omnipresent
Gratings of glass
No perception about
A transmission of thoughts

Observed and guided
Deciphered thoughts
Streams of informations
Transmit emotions

A new definition of delivery
