A gloomy constellation
Of planets and stars
A vision of revelation
Completed destiny

Impassible audience listens
The oracle of downfall
Perfection of manifestation
A sinister prize

With blood-coloured clouds
Comes the rain of thorns
To scratch the skin
To pierce the eyes

Starspangled firmament - vanish forever
A burning star enlighten - a godforsaken galaxy

Modern civilization
Confronted with a catastrophe

Hailstorm and fire - a plague from above
Red shimmering shadows - witness of downfall

Visions of revelation come clear
And complete the destiny
Sun and moon obscure
Fading source of life
Eclipse of their shining force
