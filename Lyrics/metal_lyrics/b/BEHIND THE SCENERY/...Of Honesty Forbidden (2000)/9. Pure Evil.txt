By the light of the moon
Comsumptive creatures awake
Crawl through the dark
Beware of parents awake
A pilgrimage of pimpled hordes
To worship satan in the woods

Poor evil -
Tormented by a hydrocephalus
And paranoid haemorrhoids

Poor evil -
Worshipped by pale pimpled hordes
With bloody plastic swords

Icy winds blow through the forest
Satan`s parish trembles with frost
Purulent pimples in black and white
Beaming through the gloomy night
A fire within the mystic circle
Straight from hell

A stench of diabolic transpiration
Disturbed by puberty
In dark winter nights
They molest you
Pre-school education
Has to be done

Salvation army of evil force
Celebrate Lucifer`s rise
Rotten beavers from the wood-path
The sacrifice
A penknife cuts through the flesh
Entrails and blood
Stinking clouds in the air
Satan vomit into the woods

Unholy error
Lucifer is a poor devil
Rheumatism is the price
For the nights within frost, snow and ice
