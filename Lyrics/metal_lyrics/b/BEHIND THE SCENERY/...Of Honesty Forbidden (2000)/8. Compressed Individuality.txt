Abomination of inhuman logic - jailed and forgotten
No more dignity - imprisoned by narcotic sympathy

No use for useless gears in the machinery

The shameful hunt begins
When the strong select the weak

Who doesn`t fulfill the valid norms - isolated misery

Compressed - individuality
Compressed - live without dignity
Combustible - in the fire of ambition

Embodiment of cruel ingratitude
Compressed within the walls
Of loneliness, fear and despair
Kept, banished and condemned

Discarded like broken tools
Victims of inhuman conditions

There`s no place for inability
There`s no place for
Frailty and weakness

Act of grace, only a farce
The bread of charity tastes bitter
Freedom and pride
Swallowed by a jackal called man

Victims of inhuman conditions
Jailed in the temple of cynicsm
