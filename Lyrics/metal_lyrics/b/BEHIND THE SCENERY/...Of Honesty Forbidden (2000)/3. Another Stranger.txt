A world, drawn in shades of grey
Framed with the ebon destiny
Lost in helplessness
Lost in apathy, swallowed by a
Ravage beast of prey

A cut shatters all structures
...in tears they fall
Indifference stops the future
...zero emotions
All confidence smashed
...ignored honesty
No ambitions to deliver
...suffer alone

Walk this path
Towards the light alone
Another stranger
Forsaken in pain
Moral cripples hide
Behind their masks
Passive murders feel no remorse

In times of fear and danger
They will recall
They heard the cries
They turned away
They closed their eyes

A deplorable grievance
No pity without emotions

A flight from ommissions
Can`t wash away their guilt
Play down the indolence
Shameful behaviour
Obtuse and selfish creatures
Take without giving
Live must be phlegmatic
To bear the pain

Letargic an cruel
See the stranger suffer
