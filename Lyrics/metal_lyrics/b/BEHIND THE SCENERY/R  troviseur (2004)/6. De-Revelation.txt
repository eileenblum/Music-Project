Look at this spiteful world today
And realize whatÂ´s happening
Defamatory preachers twisting the truth
And only lies will remain

What is wrong? Why canÂ´t we see?
WeÂ´re all bleeding red
What is wrong? Why canÂ´t we see?
We will all be dead

They speak in the name of thousand gods
Lies keep them alive
There is no truth in their words
Only hate and disguise
Religious arrogance
Works against every coexistence
Religious controversy
We are one, why canÂ´t we see

There is no life that doesn't end
There is no man who doesn't breathe

The blind men condemn
Everything they canÂ´t see
Without doubt, without shame
They invent their enemies
Divided cultures
Hostile religions
Separated and solitary
ItÂ´s surely not the way we wanna be

What is wrong? Why canÂ´t we see?
WeÂ´re all bleeding red
What is wrong? Why canÂ´t we see?
We will all be dead
Different symbols, different gods
The same flesh, the same blood
