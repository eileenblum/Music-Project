Non-divine masters of infinity
A breathing obscenity
Insanity
That a few regardless men hold the key
Blinded by their might and vanity
It was only a question of time
When they broke the key
And we shall be
Punished for our convenient apathy
Without iniquity

A desperate monologue
Between me and the sun
And I lie down again
As the answers fail to come

The fragile balance is stricken by despite
Manipulations
Shattered relations
And the sun burns too bright
So bright

Fading
Dying perspectives
Darkened dreams of a global grave

A desperate monologue
Between me and the sun
And I lie down again
As the answers fail to come

Tired ears have heard enough lies
From the keepers of the key
Serenity
Downfall of cultures
Downfall of nature
They will never see
Never see

We burn the broken land
And rape the purity
The future is our burden
Can we live without our dignity

This is only
A desperate monologue
Between me and the sun
And I lie down again
As the answers fail to come
