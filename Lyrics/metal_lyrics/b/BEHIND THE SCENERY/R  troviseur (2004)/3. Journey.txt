I am on my way to a place I call myself
A journey to the center of my fate
With anger I try to set my rules
To betray their way
To change my tale
My destiny

Don`t try to stop me
Don`t try to bar my way
Try to convict me - I will deny

I am so sick, so tired
Of your media control
Where each breath is guided and pre-decided
I`m breaking the wall of your thought factory
Prepare to fail, prepare to fall

Just a footstep at the shores of time

Don`t try to stop me
Don`t try to bar my way
Everything you say I will deny

Don`t try to stop me
Don`t try to bar my way
Try to convict me - I will deny

Living my life beyond your scenery
Bored of being used I`ll choose another way
The quest for what I am is natural
I am unique, an individual


Static numbers following unwritten statutes
Soulless merchants of their hunt for illusion

Don`t try to stop me
Don`t try to bar my way
Try to convict me - I will deny
