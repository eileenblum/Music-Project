Give me some words
My swan of the night
Anyway I`ll fail to catch
A faint touch of your light

Bury within me the shades of the past
Give birth to red-blazing sun
Cut the veil off my eyes

Come drown me silently and take with you
The fears that left me motionless
A sudden breeze with rains of silver dust
Return your tears into pearls of grace

To end my disguise
I fall by your side
Only to give myself up
For the glow of your eyes

So be this my creed, my own destiny
To be one with the queen of the swans
End up my life
Start a new one

Come down me silently and take with you
The fears that left me motionless
A sudden breeze with rains of silver dust
Return your tears to pearls of grace
