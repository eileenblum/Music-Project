The age of strength is here at last
Driven by the intention to restore the past

A dark some tyrant veiled in a velvet robe
Hear his anthems of suppression, of honesty and hope

An archaic impulse to constitute
A modern instrument of force
To breed a autocratic solitude
A dynasty will be enforced

Proud to stalk on bloody paths
How helpless did we become

A capitalistic democracy
Elevated in its autocracy
A world on its knees
A liberty where no oneÂ´s free

Throughout all time and history
The tyrants fight against equality
