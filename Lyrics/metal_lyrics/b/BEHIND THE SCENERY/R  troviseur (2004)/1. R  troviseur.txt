I take a look in the mirror
Can you describe to me
The face that i will see

Frozen signs of memory
Testify for the hours of decay
Sculptured by time

Flashback
Oblivion means defeat
In the end the tidals will become complete

I`m traveling through a mirror
That once was broken in pieces
A wanderer at the shores of time

Look at my picture and tell me what you see
While another day passes by
Count all the false steps I've done before
And the next day will fade away

Flashback
Oblivion means defeat
In the end the tidals will become complete

All I have done
I did it for myself
Is this the man I want to be?

Each day is portrayed by the hands of time
No more can be done
Hours of doubt are trying to kill the time
The only thing which counts is present now

Flashback
Oblivion means defeat
In the end the tidals will become complete

Time passes on quickly
And all the wasted days
Will be reduced to history

Look at my picture and tell me what you see
While another day passes by
Count all the false steps I've done before
And the next day will fade away

Look at my picture and tell me what you see
See
Count all the false steps I've done before
Before
