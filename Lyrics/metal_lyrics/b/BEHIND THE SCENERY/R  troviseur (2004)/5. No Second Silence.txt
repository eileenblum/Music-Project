The sadistic beast man
Erases silence and awakes the sleeper
With his stainless claws he drives the nail
Deeper and deeper

We all should learn to suffer in our controlled-
Uncontrolled Chaos

Stress is razor blade
Pioneer of pain
No second regeneration
They cut again
In every sinew
In every cell
Feel the torture
Feel the pain again

The dreamerÂ´s search
He`ll never reach the shores of sleep
A nervous hostage
To insomnia

No second silence
No release from the heartbeat of technology
No second sleep
No release from the tongues of misery

Restless faces
A live against the clock
A cruel competition
That canÂ´t be won
The fast-moving present
That moves restriction
A prelude of our self-made insanity

Haunting voices celebrate a raging requiem
A lullaby in deadly speed

Stress is razor blade
Pioneer of pain
No second regeneration
They cut again
Heartbeat of technology
Tongues of steel
A prelude of our
Self-made insanity
