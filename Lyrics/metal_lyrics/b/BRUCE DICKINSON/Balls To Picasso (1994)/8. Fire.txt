Always let you down...
Always fooled around
Always stealing your own way
Life just seems too short
Life lived in the dirt
Kicked in the theet
Is what you meant to say

Fighting battles, never fired a shot

You step into the fire
You're gonna get burned
Hide all the money you saved
Money won't pay
For the trouble you caused
Troubles coming back for more

Living on the edge
A blind man kneels on broken class
Building the bars of his own case
Running circles till you drop
Hating life until it stops
Kicked in the theet
Is what you meant to say...
