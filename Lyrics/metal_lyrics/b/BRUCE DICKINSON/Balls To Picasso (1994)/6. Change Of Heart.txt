Here I sit
Alone
At a window
The rain
Falls down
On the class
In the cold
All my life
I've been waiting
For a moment
It never came
Maybe never will
Ah,sometimes I don't know

Those days are gone
Now I hide where I just can't say
I'm still watching your tears
As They fall to the ground

You, you're walking away
You couldn't stay
You need a change of heart
You, you're walking away
You couldn't stay
You need a change of heart

Trees are bare - The earth it is hard
I wait ,for winter - Soft winter and snow
