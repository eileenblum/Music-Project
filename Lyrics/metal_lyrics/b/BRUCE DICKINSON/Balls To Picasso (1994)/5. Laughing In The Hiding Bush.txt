There's a sinister game
That children play... Hey... Hey
When they get to the end
Of each school day... Hey... Hey
They spend their lives
Getting ready for the kill...

Laughing in the hiding bush
The joker is back
Laughing in the hiding bush
The joker is back

Who remembers the names
Of fallen heroes aha, aha?
Who remembers today
To fly their flag?
I couldn't say I loved you
Like I did before... Ha!

Laughing in the hiding bush
The joker is back
Laughing in the hiding bush
It's the laughing attack
Laughing in the hiding bush
The joker is back
