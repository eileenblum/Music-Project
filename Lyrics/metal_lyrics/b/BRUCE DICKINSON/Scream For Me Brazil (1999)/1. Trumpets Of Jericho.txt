[B. Dickinson / Roy Z]

This is the maze of life
This is the maze of death
This is the matrix of eternity
The demon never sleeps
The demon never lies
He beats my heart and leaves no echo...

Fingers holding onto cracks
The howling wind that blows us back
Sucked into the grinding wheels of hell...

At the trumpets of Jericho, still the walls remain
At the trumpets of Jericho, Avalon's in chains

This is the river of space
This is the river of time
Chase the dragons of infinity
Atlas stands and laughs
Throws his burden down
Rolls the earth in the inferno...

What heavy burden holds me back
Every step along the track?
Fear that reaches deep inside of me

At the trumpets of Jericho, still the walls remain
Blow the trumpets of Jericho, still the walls remain
At the end of the rainbow, there the grail remains
Sound the trumpets of Jericho, Avalon's in chains...

As they drag you down, In your clothes of lead
See the golden light, Flashing overhead
Mocking you, ha ha ha ha ha ha...

Do you know who you are
In your robes of skin?
How many creatures live inside you?

Man is born forever free
But is everywhere in chains
Trapped inside this earthly prison cell...

At the trumpets of Jericho, still the walls remain
At the trumpets of Jericho, Avalon's in chains
At the trumpets of Jericho, there the grail remains
At the trumpets of Jericho

Still the walls remain [x4]

The silence of the tomb...
The wheel of fortune round...
(yea-eah)
