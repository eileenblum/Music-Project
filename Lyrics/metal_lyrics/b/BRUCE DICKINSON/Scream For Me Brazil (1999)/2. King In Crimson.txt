[B. Dickinson / Roy Z]

In the darkness, the raven's head
In the courtyard, clothed in fear
I see gates that are opening
There's only one way out of here

Daylight has gone
The night has come...

See his twisted sons and daughters
Writhing slowly in Satan's mire
If you only could see the visions
The trembling world I now despise

As the veil reveals the outer darkness
I am sucked into the halls of flame...

[CHORUS:]
Arise, awake, The king in crimson comes
Arise, awake, The king in crimson, crimson comes

He knows the weakness that you can't fight
The stone of night that weighs you down
If you only could see the visions
His hand is death if you take it now

As you scream into the web of silence
There is nothing that can save you now...

[REPEAT CHORUS (x2)]

As you scream into the web of silence
There is nothing that can save you now...

[REPEAT CHORUS (x2)]

To your window I come
At your window I come
