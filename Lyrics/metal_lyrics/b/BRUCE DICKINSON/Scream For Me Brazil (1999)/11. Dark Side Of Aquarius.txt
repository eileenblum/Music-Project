[B. Dickinson / Roy Z]

The first hellrider came on wings a-plenty in the dark
Hauled out his poison and they blew away his mark
The fascist from the east is coming, mothers hide your sons

The second hellrider came from flaming seas and molten sands
Half is played in Hell's commands
Hauled out his poison with his promises of promised lands
Glad, good times of lying leaders

Here comes the riders as the wheel of time is running out of time [x2]

The third hellrider came teaching brothers to kill brother man
And the fourth hellrider waits on an acid trail for an acid world
Walls of old religions' fools and superstitious men
Throw some scary tarot cards and...

Here comes the riders as the wheel of time is running out of time
Here comes the riders as the revolution's stepping out to light
the dark aside of Aquarius has robbed us of our souls and minds
Here comes the riders as the wheel of time is running out of time

[SOLO]

From the starlit sky on the silver sea
a lonely silver surfer comes to push the wheel for me 
[x2]

Gotta move, gotta move, gotta move that wheel around [x3]
Gotta push the wheel of time around [x4]
I've gotta move the wheel of torment [x3]
move that wheel around

Gotta move the wheel of time, I've [x3]
round
