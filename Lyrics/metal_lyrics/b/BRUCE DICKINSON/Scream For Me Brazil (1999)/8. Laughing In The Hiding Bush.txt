[B. Dickinson / Roy Z / A. Dickinson]

There's a sinister game that children play...Hey...Hey
When they get to the end of each schoolday...Hey...Hey
They spend their lives getting ready for the kill...

[CHORUS:]
Laughing in the hiding bush
The joker is back
Laughing in the hiding bush
The joker is back

Who remembers the names of fallen heroes aha aha?
Who remembers today to fly their flag?
I couldn't say I loved you like I did before...Ha!

Laughing in the hiding bush
The joker is back
Laughing in the hiding bush

It's the laughing attack
The joker is back
He's wild in the pack
The joker is back
Laughing in the hiding... gonna kick him in the bush, yeah

[SOLO]

[REPEAT CHORUS (x2)]
