[B. Dickinson / Roy Z]

As above, so below
All things come from the one
Now you are the victim
Carried by the wind, rooted in the ground
If you want to learn the secrets
Close your eyes...

The ladder falls away
At the gates of Urizen, fallen eagles blaze
At the gates of Urizen, eternal twins are damned
At the gates of Urizen, separate lives begin...

In every woman is a man
From the moon come silver ghosts
Spectres of the blood
From my spirit comes the darkness
From the void, the crimson fortress rises...

[CHORUS:]
At the gates of Urizen, the ladder falls away
At the gates of Urizen, fallen eagles blaze
At the gates of Urizen, eternal twins are damned
At the gates of Urizen, separate lives begin...

[SOLO]

[REPEAT CHORUS]

The gates of Urizen [x3]
At the gates...
