I am the teacher, come to teach ya
Take the old words back to you
You were lost, but I found you
And it's your choice what to do
I've learned a few things as I've traveled through the years

Through the door of evermore...

I came through fire, came through water
Through the oily serpent's kiss
Climbed the mountain, chased the dragon
Thrown myself in the abyss
Do I make myself familiar to you now?

'Cause I've been around you
And I'm glad I found you...

I am the living flame, and I teach the holy games
Teach the secret of the dance
Throw the future in the runes
Kick the sand in Satan's face
I put Jesus in his place
Shaman or priest, it's all the same
The Magician is my name

(woah-oh-oh, oh-oh)
The Magician is my name
(woah-oh-oh, oh-oh)
The Magician is my name
(woah-oh-oh, oh-oh)
The Magician is my name
(oh-oh)
And magic is my game

Now I know you, and you know me
We have secrets we can share
We can build a new tomorrow
From the trash of yesterday

It won't be the last time
And I'm glad I found you...

I am the living flame, and I teach the holy games
Teach the secret of the dance
Throw the future in the ruins
Kick the sand in Satan's face
I put Jesus in his place
Shaman or priest, it's all the same
The Magician is my name

(woah-oh-oh, oh-oh)
The Magician is my name
(woah-oh-oh, oh-oh)
The Magician is my name
(woah-oh-oh, oh-oh)
The Magician is my name
(woah-oh-oh, oh-oh)
The Magician is my name
