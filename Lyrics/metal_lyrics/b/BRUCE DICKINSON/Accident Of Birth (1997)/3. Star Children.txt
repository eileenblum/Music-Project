I came for nothing before nothing began
Broke the window of existence and became a man

No sympathy for fools
My star is black and burned
I tilt towards the light
I suck your souls into my might

We are star children - coming out of nowhere and to nowhere return
Star children - a hundred million souls snuffed out in one breath

I shiver at the threshold of your waking hour
The knowledge that you seek is my source of power

I live apart from you
But I know the things you do
No angel can save you, how?
You don't need a god 'cause I'm here now

Do I fulfill your deepest need for prophecy?
I am the ruler that you seek
So come to me
Come to me

Star children - coming out of nowhere and to nowhere return
Star children - a hundred million souls sucked out in one breath
Star children - I'm the ruler of existence in your space and time
Star children - to penetrate your future is our only crime
Star...
