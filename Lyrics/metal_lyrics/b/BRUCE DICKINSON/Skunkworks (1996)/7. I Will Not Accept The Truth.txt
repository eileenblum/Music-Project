I will not accept the truth
I will not accept the truth
I will not accept the truth
that I'll never get there no way

I must not push forward... no
I must not push forward... no
I must not push forward... no
because I'll never get there
never get there... no way

I will not believe your lies
I will not believe your lies
I will not believe your lies
you say I'll never get there
never get there, well hold on..

I will not accept your truth
I will not believe your lies
I will not acknowledge pain
I will survive and live again
coming back now, rising back now
