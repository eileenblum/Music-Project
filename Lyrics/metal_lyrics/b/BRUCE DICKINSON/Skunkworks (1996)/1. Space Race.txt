Yes, yes I'd launch into the rising sun
my living breath is measured
every step is done
fare you well my friends
see you down the line
yeah, yeah...
I don't belong to nation state or dying race
I leave my prejudice
with you my religion's in space
so have a little respect
why are we running in this space race
why are we acting like we own the place
just want to feel the starlight on my face
reach out my hand and touch beyound...
yes, yes I'd float around till gravity's end
unity is coming, singular again
see you then my friends at the end of the line, yeah, yeah
secret knowledge science logic all are done
nothing left but burning up into the sun
on a cosmic beach I'll see ya there
