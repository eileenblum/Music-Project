You knew I wouldn't go
that's why you threatened me... would I stay?
you crawled up on your knees
a victioms pretty please...
would I stay? would I stay?... and I stayed
how many more times, till I breakout
from that guilty mess
you taught me to hate to love you
that's because you love to hate yourself
I wish it had a happy end
like the fairy tales
pretend there can be
but things are not the same
when your life love was a game
of make believe
you get everything you want
but not everything you need
and it's true... you recieve...
what you achieve
how many screaming fights, tears of rage
until it ended
how many times, till I say who I am
and don't pretend
