Well you bred me
well you fed me
well you made me what I am
good for nothing
well...
it's a dreamstate, a dreamstate
to kill me with kindness you'll just have to wait
you say I'm nothing
you say I'm nothing
never gonna be something well then
that's the life for me
your expectations... your reservation
aw... c'mon please...
it's a dreamstate, a dreamstate
you bought into the vision so you don't have to wait
a dreamstate of bliss, a dreamstate of bliss
a dreamstate...
now I'm standing up here before the judge
juries got their head where the sun don't shine
everybody's lying on my case, they're lying on me
lying on me...
lying on me...
lying on my case
eyes above me, eyes above me
never realised there was someone
else in here
no resolution
and no conclusion
do I believe?
in a dreamstate, a dreamstate...
you fell for it sucker, you fell for the bait
a dreamstate of bliss
a dreamstate of bliss
a dreamstate
