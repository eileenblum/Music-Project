I see the scars of action writhing round your face
Too much inactivity and home's a lonely place
Throw away your beauty cuz you know that it won't last
Throw away your present, you've been living in the past

Come on, take a trip with me across the bridge of lunacy
Fire up some beast and ride the skywaves

I've thrown away my images, they're all so distant now
Discovery was a stranger then, welcome to my house
Whatever demons torture me I love them like a friend
Nothing lasts forever but the certainty of change

I'd rather move around and be than figure out live and what it means
Fire up some beast and ride the skywaves
Don't wanna waste my time on you if you can't travel this way too
Fire up this beast, we'll ride the skywaves

[Solo]

And when the fireballs work is done, and we are part of the nuclear one
The whole Damn Thing begins again
Our glory days have just begun, a fiery sideslip then we're gone
I'll see ya Monday morning

Any way I'm coming back
Anyway I'm coming back
