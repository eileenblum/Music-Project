I'm vacuum breathing and open-mouthed
as the red shift fills my eyes
oh minister my promises as her shadow cuts the day away
I remember you when you walked into that room
now dislocated jagged pieces
are sliding into this broken mind
I'm swimming back against the river
but I'm rising with the tide
where we came from
we're all going back there soon
how many times have we met this way
how many lives have we lived before
how many faces and how many names
shadows come but shadows are gone
shadows come but shadows are gone
