Trapped inside a web of fiery gravity that fuels all our needs
chaotic energy that sucks the life from H to He
all life withers in the sun
I deny what I have done
spend my days and nights
in roaring halls of crimson life
solar confinement
solar confinement, solar confinement
solar distress flares
I've slept with many strangers
so fission fusion fission makes good sense
where I laid my head my troubles
I put down to experience
it's cold and lonely in the sun
deny what I have done
spend my days and nights
in roaring halls of crimson life
a lonely boy sits in his room
his curtains hide the sun
confess to what you've done
and no one understands
