She fixed me in the corner with that beutiful brown eye.
She said I'd like to meet you I was so suprised.
Well, what can I do for you. What can you do for me.
We made for the exit had to wait and see.
I hope I'm not wasting your precious time.
I no your not wasting mine.
We came together over coffee with milk.
She never stopped till every drop was spilled.

[CHORUS:]

She was a zulu lulu.
Broke my back and my heart at the same time.
It was nice.
Just a zulu lulu.
I had to move on when I came back she'd gone.

She dropped to her knees. I guess she had religion.
She lived with her mother. Had been a good girl twice.
When I asked her to comment on her present position.
She said she'd like to take a late preachers advise.
I ain't looking for sympothy.
But prayers for the wicked are kinda nice.
She said I don't like to preach to the converted.
I said you could be a good girl more than twice.
Like this.

[CHORUS:]

I ain't looking for sympothy.
But prayers for the wicked are kinda nice.
She looked me up and down and said Assiagod for me.
I began to see god. She said, wait and see babe.
Wait. Wait. Im coming.

[CHORUS:]
