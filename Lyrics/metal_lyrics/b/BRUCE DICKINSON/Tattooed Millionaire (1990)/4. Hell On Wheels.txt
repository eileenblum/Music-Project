Devil's driving down the track.
Hell on wheels and it won't turn back.
Engine racing down a one way street.
Speed wheel chasing in a red line heat.
Into the blackness. Into the night.
Out of the tunnel. Into the light.
Red for danger. That's just for show.
Climb aboard. Come as you go.

[CHORUS:]

Hard to steer when the devil's driving.
Helens wheels and the brake's won't hold.
Hard to steer when the devil's driving.
Hell on wheels and the brake's won't hold.

Too smart to come she just arrived.
Only gave her one but she's using five.
Minutes of time in the usual place.
If I was strapped in you could sit on my place. (face)
The door's were locked. The windows sealed.
Hitting me with the jack was the devil's deal.
Blue light flashing as the lipstick smudge.
Diving for cover in a tunnel of glove.

[CHORUS.]

Something's driving me. I don't know where.
Something down in my cellar somewhere.
Noone waiting for me down the line.
Noone waiting for me this time.

[CHORUS:]

Knuckle Down, Stick Shift, Take it slow.
Easy come means easy go.
Lay off the gas, make it last.
Cuz under my hood she's blowin' fast.
Into the blackness. Into the night.
Out of the tunnel. Into the light.
Red for danger thats just for show.
Climb aboard. Come as you go.

[CHORUS.]
