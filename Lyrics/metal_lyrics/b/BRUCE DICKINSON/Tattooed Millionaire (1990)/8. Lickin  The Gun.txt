Lickin' the gun lickin' the hand that feeds you.
Lickin' the gun finger lickin' fun.
Lickin' the gun lickin' the hand that feeds you.
Lickin' the fun finger lickin' fun.

Senator husband going for broke.
I've gotta prove I'm not a joke.
We smoked the stuff in '69.
Now it's different. It's a crime.
Kid's today don't understand. Kid's today need a guiding hand.
Put a sticker if it rymes with truck.
When the law should slide, guess I'll duck.

[CHORUS:]

Watch religion come and go. Watch corruption on their shows.
Buy your silence, Money for blood.
Out of the ark and into the flood.
Crasy men with russian guns. My words never killed anyone.
Kissing Baby's. Lickin' the gun.
Ain't political. Just having fun.

[CHORUS:]

Eat it up lay down and die.  They'll shoot you up.
And they don't know why.
Their doing a job and they enjoy it too.
Their protecting us from me and you.
We smoked the stuff in '69.
Now it's different. It's a crime.
I don't care to wait and see.
If I'm cool enough to make history.

[CHORUS.]
