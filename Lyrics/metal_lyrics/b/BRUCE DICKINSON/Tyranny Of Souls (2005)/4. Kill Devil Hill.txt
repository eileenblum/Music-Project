Blood brothers of angels, now hear us
We earthbound your offspring, don't fear us
God willing, we'll raise up, be near you
So open your arms now and take us

So we're believing our dreams, like the Icarus of old
The plans we made for the bold
In the blue-eyed beyond, there is nowhere to hide,
There's no going back now

As the wind whips over the hillside
Twenty knots over Kill Devil Hill
Steady wind blows over the sand
Twenty knots over Kill Devil Hill
As the breeze whips straight as an arrow
Let her go over Kill Devil Hill
Gasoline and the wind in the wires
Kill Devil Hill and the way to the stars.

We stand on this seashore and wonder
What madness, what secrets we plunder
All failure, we learn from, discovery
The wreckage of heaven lies in the sand
First chances abandoned
With wood string and wire we can barely control our desire
For Destinies arrows....

As the wind whips over the hillside
Twenty knots over Kill Devil Hill
Steady wind blows over the sand
Twenty knots over Kill Devil Hill
As the breeze whips straight as an arrow,
Let her go over Kill Devil Hill
Gasoline and the wind in the wires
Kill Devil Hill and the way to the stars
