Is this a citadel
Is this a prison cell?
Who sits at my right hand now,
Who's watching me now?
Who made us live this way?
When do I get my say
Automation turns us into
Human beings now
Tripping over faces
Humanity has fallen
Huddled into doorways
And the streets at dawn

The power of the sun
Keeps us moving on
Spinning ever faster
The city never sleeps
The echoes of the footfalls
Already in the past

Every dawn arrives
The gathering of the tribes
Shattered waves of people
Breaking over city walls
Never out of touch
But always on your own
Trapped inside the logic
Of your own communication zone

What deals have been done
Who's under the gun
Stay one step ahead
Of the next in line

[Chorus]

The cameras never lie
The ghost of you and I
Already in the past
Inside a picture frame
We'll vanish once again
Now the dawn is coming fast

[Chorus]
