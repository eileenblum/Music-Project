I wake in sweat
You've come to steal my life away
Some strange electric glow
Of artificial day
The power breakers closed
The grid of darkness falls
Shining gleaming black as night
Burning all the light

What do you want from me
I sense your mastery
There's something you won't ever find
So have your way with me
This prisoner is never free
Rip me up leave me behind

Are you the truth to sit in judgement on my sins
Evil laser gadgets come to penetrate my skin
The hanging judge is open
And I'm damned before his eyes
Another genesis has failed
And many more have tried

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Masterplan moment

And so the story goes
I dreamt this long ago
Highways hidden in the sand
Reveal the troops I know
They took my worthless heart
And spat it through their eyes
Abduction means the end for me
A million years of misery

[Chorus]

So have your way with me
This soldier's lost his victory
Rip me up...
