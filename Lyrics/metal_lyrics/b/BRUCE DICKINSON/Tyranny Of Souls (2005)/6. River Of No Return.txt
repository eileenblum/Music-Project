Break the bread and drink the wine
Seize the chalice suck the poison vine
There is frost in every sunbeam? water flows from the earth to sky
Looking down on every rose nothing moves the wheal of heaven turns
As our fingers leave there trace, we are gods in a world we dared embrace

Now we're lost, you can't disguise, the River of No Return
Now it's gone, you realize, the River of No Return

Growing embers of our ancient lives
We struggle hard we live to turn the tide
Living longer in the astral waste
We stare each other, we look death in the face
All my life in front of you, lonely secrets hidden from your view.
Now we orbit a different sun, for eternity, doomed to tell no one..

Now we're lost, you can't disguise, the River of No Return
Now it's gone, you realize, the River of No Return

[Solo]

Now I'm truly all alone,
Canyon walls and the river of no return
I'm amazed at what I am,
Iâve never knew the feelings I ignored

Now we're lost, you can't disguise, the River of No Return
Now it's done, we realize, the River of No Return
And the anguish drives me on, I wish I could return
All the love that washed away
Down the River of No Return
