You wanna know where legends live
At the rainbows end Iâll be there
Thereâs a place in Innerspace,
That's where I get to you

I'm not the shy, retiring kind
Like a supernova for the blind
I used to sit at God's right ha,d
but I quit that show to do my one night stands...

Coming outta nowhere I'm a Godhead rider

You wonât see my face no more
My machine has left the floor.
Leave my rivals in the dirt
I've seen your world and I got the shirt...
Before I leave and go my way
Iâve loved it but I couldn't stay
Thereâs nothing left for you to feel
Just remember me

You might see me in Tokyo
To the rings of Saturn, hey let's go...
And you can trip all the lights with me
But your one time chance is never free...

I see you baby once again
Maybe three score years and ten
I'll be driving a different ship
That's when I'll take you down
For your final trip

Coming outta nowhere I'm a godhead rider....
You won't see my face no more
My machine has left the floor
Leave my rivals in the dirt
I've seen your world and I got the shirt...
Before I leave and go my way
I loved it but I couldn't stay
There's nothing left for you to feel
Just remember me....

Coming outta nowhere I'm a Godhead rider...
Coming outta nowhere I'm a Godhead rider...
You won't see my face no more
My machine has left the floor
Leave my rivals in the dirt
I've seen your world and I got the shirt...
Before I leave and go my way
I loved it but I couldn't stay
There's nothing left for you to feel
Just remember me.
