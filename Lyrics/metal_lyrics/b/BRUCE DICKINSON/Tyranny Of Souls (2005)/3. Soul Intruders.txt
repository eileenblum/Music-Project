We ride the cosmic streams of time
We are the fools you came to trust
We blind the eyes of history
We tear ourselves down from your cross

Half-lives, we live again
Half-lives, now we are one

Weâre the Soul Intruders, and the whirling void of night
Weâre the Soul Intruders, and we're crying for the light
Weâre the Soul Intruders, with no life of our own
I'm a sole survivor, but who sits on my throne?

Solar winds have taken hold
Blowing us where we do not know
Existence silent and unknown
Father son and viral host

Half-lives, eat but never kill
Half-lives, we live as well

Weâre the Soul Intruders, and the whirling void of night
Weâre the Soul Intruders, and we're crying for the light
Weâre the Soul Intruders, with no life of our own
I'm a sole survivor, but who sits on my throne?

[Solo]

Half-lives, eat but never kill
Hope flies, we live as well

Weâre the Soul Intruders, and the whirling void of night
Weâre the Soul Intruders, and we're crying for the light
Weâre the Soul Intruders, with no life of our own
I'm a sole survivor, but who sits on my throne?
