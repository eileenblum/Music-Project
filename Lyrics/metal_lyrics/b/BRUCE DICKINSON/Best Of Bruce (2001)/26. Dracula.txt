[D. Siviter/ A. Siviter]
[First Shots recording session, 1977]

Waiting for the midnight hour [x6]

[CHORUS:]
My name is
Dracula, Come here, I've something for you
Dracula, I need a little life
Dracula, And you are gonna be my wife

Walking through the town when the streets are bare in the night
Shadows everywhere, are you sure it's a trick of the light?
Fear is at your heal but you kick it away,
you're so sure theres nothing behind you
Thats a mistake you can make just one time

I bet you thought that I was a ficticous guy from the movie screen
Now its far too late for you to break this date, you missed your chance to scream
My only sense of humor's in a jugular vein
and your neck is on the menu tonight
Soon you will know what it's like to be mine

[REPEAT CHORUS]

As long as you live
The Bride of Dracula
[x3]

As long as you live you'll be
Waiting, waiting for the midnight hour [x8]
