[B. Dickinson/ Roy Z.]
[The Chemical Wedding-sessions, 1998]

We live and die like all the rest
Every summer has its sunset every year
Love and hope put to the test
Every grain of comfort holds the seed of fear

And I loved you long ago
And I love you still
But the roads that we have travelled took us far apart
Scattered to the four winds
Someday we will find the time to heal

And I loved you long ago

[SOLO]

And the scars that bear my name
are the wounds that never heal
But the road that we have travelled took us far apart
And I love you still

And I loved you long ago
