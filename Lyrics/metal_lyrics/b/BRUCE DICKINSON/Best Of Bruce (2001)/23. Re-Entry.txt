[B. Dickinson/ A. Dickson]
[Skunkworks-sessions, 1996]

Say goodbye to earth's children on a sleigh ride to the moon
Blue and white in the distance, not sorry I'm leaving you

Now and then the earthrise fills my eyes
Now and then the darkside fills the sky
Turn around the starlight warms my skin
Even in the blackness there's a tune

Now that I'm not with you I close my eyes and dream
Remember all my days as a prisoner of gravity
I left a piece of history and the future has begun
Sat here with my feet hung up and nowhere is my home

Now and then the earthrise fills my dreams
Squeeze my fist in anger, remember what it means
Turn around the starlight warms my skin
Every day in the blackness we begin
...again

[SOLO]

Now and then the earthrise fills my eyes
Squeeze my fist in anger, remember what it means
Turn around the starlight warms my skin
Every day in the blackness we begin

Welcome back to the human race so very far from home
I know I should be lonely but there's too much going on
I left this ball of sadness when the fighting had begun
To leave behind your mayhem, your chemistry? Are free?

Oh!
