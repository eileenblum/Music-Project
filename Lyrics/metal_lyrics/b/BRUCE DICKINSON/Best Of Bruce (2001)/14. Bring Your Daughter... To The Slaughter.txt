[B. Dickinson]
[Soundtrack-The Nightmare on Elm Street pt 5"]

Honey its getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow make no sound

If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
Unchain your back door invite me around

[CHORUS:]
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
let her go, let her go, let her go
[x2]

Honey its getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie

So get down on your knees honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
Cos you know I'm coming soon

[REPEAT CHORUS]

So pick up your foolish pride
No going back, no where, no way, no place to hide
Let her go

[SOLO]

Bring your daughter, bring your daughter
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter to the slaughter

[REPEAT CHORUS (x2)]

Let her go [x4]
