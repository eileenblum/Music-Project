"Recording all of the above and some of the below"

Love is over like it never began
Flicker of life, the candle in his hand
Watch the fairy tale unfold, unwind
For this prize he traveled in his mind

Who is guilty, who decides
Who took her life, who gained a prize
Love is cheap, life's a lie
What kind of man would do this to his friend

Hand caressed, squeezed her life away
Slide into the darkness, the end of the day
Swallowed with the black, cover the light
To the fire, to the night

Love is over like it never began
Flicker of life, the candle in his hand
The queen is dying, dying and loved

Watch the fairy tale unfold, unwind, unravel
Now with his prize he'd slide into the forest beyond

You're alone, alone...forever
Alone forever
Alone forever
He's gonna be alone forever
Alone forever
