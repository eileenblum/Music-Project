[B. Dickinson]
[Demo, 1992]

Here in a church a small boy in kneeling
He prays to a God he doesn't know, he cannot feel
All of his sins of childhood he will remember
He will not cry, tears he will not cry

[CHORUS:]
Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
His small boy wonders what was it all about
Is your journey over, has it just begun?

A vision of a new world from the ashes of the old
"Do what thou wilt" he screams from his cursed soul
A tortured seer, a prophet of our emptiness
Wondering why, wondering why

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO]

A man of sorrow's wrecked with thoughts that dare not speak their name
Trapped inside a body made to feel only guilt and shame
His anger all his life, "I hate myself", he cried
"Do what thou wilt, do what thou wilt", he cried

[REPEAT CHORUS (x2)]

Has it just begun?
