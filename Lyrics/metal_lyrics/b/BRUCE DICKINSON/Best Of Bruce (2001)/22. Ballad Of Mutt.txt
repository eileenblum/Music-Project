Before I met my baby, there was a whole lot going on
Yea, before I met my baby, there was a whole lot going on
I used to wag my tail in every corner, never hesitate to give that bitch a bone

Before I met my baby didn't have a clue
Before I met my baby I didn't know what I should do
Before I met my baby this misguided mutt made dog meat out of you and everybody else

She went to see my kennel, she said "It's like a rabbit hutch"
She went to see my kennel, she said "It smells too much"
She wouldn't wag her tail or nothing at all until the furniture-man called
He said take it away, oh yeah, go on, let's guitar

[SOLO]

One time, baby, I took her for a walk
Two timing bitch, I tried to squash her under a truck
Three time looser, this ain't no game
Five hand shuffle driving me insane
I can't get it when I want it, when I call her she don't answer to her name

We settle down into a laugh of bliss or so it seemed
I adjusted to the endless wine and foodmixes end her talking to me
It was hell, I tell you
And when I dug my bone up, she threw my bone right back at me!

Some...
There's some harmonica?  In the ball?

[SOLO]

I finished with that bitch, he'd left her tied up to a tree
She had a note around her neck saying, "Take this one, she's free"
Before I met my baby my life was misery
Before I met my baby my life was misery

Hm...
