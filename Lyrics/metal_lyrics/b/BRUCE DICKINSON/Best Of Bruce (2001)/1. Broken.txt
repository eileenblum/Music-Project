[B. Dickinson / Roy Z.]

I will not be pushed
I will not be stamped defiled
I will not be crushed
I am not your only child

I am not a freak
object of your own desire
I am not ashamed
I am not an alibi

[CHORUS:]
I stand alone, now I can see
You won't bring me down
For all this pain and misery
I'm not broken

Crushed, crushed

I am not a pawn
This is not a game of chess
I am not a pin stuck into your shiny vest
I am not a slave
I will do what I do best
Walking out on you
Take my life and leave the rest

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[CHORUS II:]
All the hatred can't you see
You won't bring me down
All your lies have set me free
I'm not broken

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [x4]

[REPEAT CHORUS &amp; CHORUS II]

I'm not broken [x3]
