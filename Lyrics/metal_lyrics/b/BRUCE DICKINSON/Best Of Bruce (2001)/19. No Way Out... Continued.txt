[B. Dickinson/ J. Crichton/ R. Baker]
[Keith Olsen-sessions, 1993]

A silent sleeping vampire, arisen from his grave
As I am still quiet in the dark
The only sign of breathing, a flicker on my skin
The only sign of life, my beating heart

What does it take to open my eyes?
What does it take to register surprise?
What does it take to feel joy?
What does it take to feel pain?

Floors creep but doors are still
I've read all the books about being ill
I know the truth, the truth knows I'm right
One day you'll fear me in the night

[CHORUS:]
A drowning mind sees daylight, coming up for air
I've been working hard for this
all my life and I like it this way

I know they're staking out my house
That's why I'm quiet like a mouse
I don't know love but I know what's right
I feel my sickness every night

My TV fills my world with light
Twenty-four hours of second sight
I talk to God on my station
He gives me secret information

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[SOLO]

Mother suffocate me
Mother suffocate me
There's no way out of here
It's tearing me apart
There's no way out of here
There's no way out of here
Mother suffocate me
There's no way out of here
There's no way out of here
No, no, no way out of here
