[B. Dickinson/ A. Dickson]

A silent river flowing black
Strange attractions, no turning back
Present danger I recall
that pins my senses to the wall

Back from the edge where the
darkness has fled and I'm
swimming in light and I'm
falling, falling from the edge

Back from the edge

I fell from grace and that's a fact
I still have urges I fight back
Cold decisions wear me thin
Kill yourself, begin again

Back from the fear that you're
not worth a damn, throw your-
self into light and the rush as you
spin from the edge

Back from the edge

Now and then I wonder where the faces from my childhood have gone
Like father like son in your bones it lives on glowing shadows

[SOLO]

Back from the edge [repeat to end]
