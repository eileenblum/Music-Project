[B. Dickinson]
[Tattooed Millionaire-sessions, 1990]

Cold sunlight falling on me
Cold sunlight falling on me
I am a lonely man, sorrow is my friend
Fall asleep as the dawn comes up, a ray of hope again

Hold a crystal vision, for a second, let it pass
Hold a crystal vision, for a moment making last
Summers so quickly gone, darkness be my friend
Nothing lasts forever, but the certainty of change

[SOLO]

I am a lonely man, sorrow is my friend
Nothing lasts forever, but the certainty of change
