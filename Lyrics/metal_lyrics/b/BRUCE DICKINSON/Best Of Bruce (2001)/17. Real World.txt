[B. Dickinson / Roy Z.]
[The Chemical Wedding-sessions, 1998]

How many lifetimes, how many beginnings
How many lovers, how many threats
How many religions to keep us all guessing
Give me a reason. Why? Hell is a reason. Why?

The real world, you've got to fight to see it through
The real world, it's not the cages in the zoo
The real world, is buried underneath your feet
The real world, the real world

Too many people try to sell you their cages
Gilding the bars 'til the jailer arrives
If living in zoos is your idea of outrageous
Don't pick any animal, I'll be the wild one

The real world, you've got to fight to see it through
The real world, it's likes the cages in the zoo
The real world can leave you hanging by a thread
The real world, the real world

[SOLO]

The real world, you've got to fight to see it through
The real world, it's likes the cages in the zoo
The real world can leave you hanging by a thread
The real world, the real world
[x2]

The real world, the real world [x2]
