[Bruce Dickinson / Roy Z.]

There are twelve commandments
There are twelve divisions
Twelve are the pagans who have mapped the sky

In the outer circle
To the inner sanctum
From the octave at the end of time

The fountain, the trinity
The pilgrim is searching for blood
To look for his own free will
The stone of infinity, washed in the flood

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

And the hanged man smiles

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

Let the fool decide
In the atom circle
Where we break the stars
Hammer into anvil, stuffing out the sun

Witness all the killing
See the birth of Mars
Our religion thrown into the fire

The fountain, the trinity
The pilgrim is searching for blood
To look for his own free will
The stone of infinity, washed in the flood

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

The hanged man smiles

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

The magician laughs

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

And the priestess kneels

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

Let the fool decide

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

And the hanged man smiles

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

Let the fool decide

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

The priestess kneels to receive

Lovers in the tower

The moon and sun divided

The magician laughs
