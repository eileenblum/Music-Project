[Bruce Dickinson / Roy Z.]

Wash away the blackness with the silver rain 
Don't turn away - don't turn away 
Wash away the blackness with the silver rain 
Don't turn away - don't try to hide... 

Sulphurous and burning, spitting out the sun 
The beginning of creation, of the golden one 
A window to the west, a blazing star above 
In Taurus we begin it and the ladder has begun 

Don't try and blame me for your sins 
For the sun has burned me black 
Your hollow lives - this world in which we live 
I throw it back 

Four-headed dragon for the four degrees of fire 
Purify the insane, bring the solution ever higher 
Bring me all the elements, spread them round my head 
Bring me mad men's bodies, I will break them all like bread 

Don't try and blame me for your sins 
For the sun has burned me black 
Your hollow lives - this world in which we live 
I hurl it back 

Don't try and blame me for your sins 
For the sun has burned me black 
Your hollow lives - this world in which we live 
I throw it back 

Don't try and blame me for your games 
Your games are death 
My world is light - the angels fill my eyes 
With every breath... 

And so we lay 
We lay in the same grave 
Our chemical wedding day 

And so we lay 
We lay in the same grave 
Our chemical wedding day 

And so we lay 
We lay in the same grave 
Our chemical wedding day 

And so we lay 
We lay in the same grave 
Our chemical wedding day... 

And all this vegetable world appeared on my left foot 
As a bright sandal, formed immortal of precious stones and gold 
I stooped down, and bound it on 
To walk forward through eternity...
