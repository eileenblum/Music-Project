[Bruce Dickinson / Adrian Smith]

Bring the toys out for the boys
Let the children make their noise
See the monsters in their metal cages

Turn the lights down in your soul
Cut the power to your heart
See the carcass in its dying rages

Machine men, cannibals of rust

Machine men, iron bites the dust

Machine men, built with feet of clay

Are coming to sweep you all away
What bitter vampire made you this?
Gave you life with its deathly kiss
Ground your limbs to bloody stew
Made a new machine of you

Turned a nightmare into day
Sucks your breath, takes your life away
Beating harder through your veins
Someone else's cold remains

Machine men, cannibals of rust

Machine men, iron bites the dust

Machine men, built with feet of clay
Are coming to sweep you all away
They're coming to sweep you all away

Machine men, cannibals of rust

Machine men, iron bites the dust

Machine men, built with feet of clay

Are coming to take you all away

Machine men, cannibals of rust

Machine men, iron bites the dust

Machine men, built with feet of clay

Are coming to take you all away

They're coming to sweep you all away
Iron - in the soul
