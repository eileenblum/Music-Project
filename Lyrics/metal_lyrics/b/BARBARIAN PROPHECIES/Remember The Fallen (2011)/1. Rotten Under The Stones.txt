Like a monstrous dream
They eat my brain
With the hammer of depression
They shatter my sickness

The stones of ancient ages
Talk me into madness
Now, bring me the fury of the flames
Again

Hate ruled my life
My torment will be eternal
The ghosts of victims haunt me
No let me rest in peace... never

Eating my brain
I feel the eternal repulse
Killed demons disappear at dawn
Like a black hole full of screaming

You mustn't get lost in your lies
You cannot regain your sanity
It's useless to think of way out
You'll never find

You must no hear the human message
Of your rotten heart
You must no hear the human message
Betrayed by a million stone souls
