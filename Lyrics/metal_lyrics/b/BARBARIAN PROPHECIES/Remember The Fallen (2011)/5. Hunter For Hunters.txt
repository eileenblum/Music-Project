When the darkness falls
Your time is running out
You cannot see him
But you feel his presence
You are the chosen one
Your meat's waiting
Now it's to late
There's no turning back

You must pay the price for your sins
You thought it would never happen
You were wrong

Feel the fear
In your soul
Death is coming
Die

It's time to die
You are history
Suffering begins
Repent in your bed of death
The revenge is served
The world is a bit more fairer
Death will make you free
Burn in hell forever

Flesh and bone
In his eyes
Killer instinct
To survive
