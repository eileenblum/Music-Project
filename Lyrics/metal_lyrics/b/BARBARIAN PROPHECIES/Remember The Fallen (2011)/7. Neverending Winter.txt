My disciples are following me
I will guide them to eternity
Not afraid to close their eyes
They give me their lives without any doubt

Can you see your destiny?
Can you feel my frozen breath?
Can you see my eyes empty?
Filled with darkness?

Come with me
I'll show you the over time

Never ending winter
Fallen into a dark depression
The only scape is suicide
Never ending winter
I'm living into a nightmare
That my life freezes

The pain in my way
Covers my life in black
As the eternal night covers
Winter landscapes

The cold north winds
Bring death at night
The sunrise never finds its way

The cold death is my destiny
My greatest enemy
This winter is my conviction
My blood is frozen forever
