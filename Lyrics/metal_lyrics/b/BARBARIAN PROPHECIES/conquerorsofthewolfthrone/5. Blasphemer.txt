Psychopath inner conflict
Nightmare coming true
Deny your stupid god
I'm the master of the dark arts
I possess the blackened power
I'm the king of the unlight
I'll dethrone your fucking god
Blasphemer unholy revenge
Open wide the gates of hell
Blood raining from the skies
Dark spiritual screams from the storms
Begin the infernal rituals, to damnation
Darkness is falling, darkness is coming
There's no light which can save me
I'm commanding the forces of hell
In this angels war
Confusing, destroying, hunting
Damnation, immolation of holy creation
Reclaim the power of the crown of death
Unholy voices order to kill
Glorificate the master of the black hordes
Virgins and innocent souls will be sacrificed
Evil forces of mystic sphere, will return to their kingdom
