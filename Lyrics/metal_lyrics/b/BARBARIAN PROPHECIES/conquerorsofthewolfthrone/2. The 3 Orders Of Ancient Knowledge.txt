Inner forest of dark morality
Cruel shadows of depravity
Laughing at your inferiority
Strong as the mountains of deepest insane
Cold as ice evil possession
Clever as wolves hellish sensations
Condemned to agony, look at the eyes of death (it's me)
Try to keep your soul away from me or walk through.
The path of decay
These are the orders of ancient knowledge!!!
