I remember the bloody history from past
An age of legends, knights and fear
A time where humans were free
When the queens of dark land falls over the forest
And the black light of the moon cover the pagan lands
In a black autumn night they were killed
For the Christian hypocrisy to save themselves
But from the land of the shadows
Pagan knights invoked diabolical legions of demons
Hahaha
And darkness falls in the forest of the dead
Evil forces whisper infernal war songs
To summon the four princess of the hell's crown
Satan, master of the black flame ineffable king of hell
Lucifer, bringer of the light and air
Belial, king of the unholy underworld's children
Leviathan, power of deep blood of unholy knife
Armies of unholy darkness are... unite
Eternal fire is ready... to arrive
Truth is near, paradise is only a dream
The blood of vengeance is in their veins
I can hear the screams from the holy lands
Apocalypse is inside my head
Infernal demons coming for you
Taking your body, possessing your soul
Stabbing, hacking and cutting the flesh
This is the day of the Armageddon
The day of the carnage
In nominee dei nostri satanas luciferi excelse!
Rains of fire in the Earth, kill, burn
In nominee dei nostri satanas luciferi excelse!
Rivers of Christian blood cover the world
In nominee dei nostri satanas luciferi excelse!
