Inside my brain, Drilling my feelings
Pain of my punishment, Fear of my acts
Misunderstanding who I am
Confused mind by terror
Revengeful killer war machine
Natural instinct to Dismember
Deep inside your own hypocrisy
I'm in fear o worship evil
Antagonist of supreme reality
Walking the path of pain and
Suffering... and suffering!
Bloody flesh, all that your animal
Instinct needs...
Carnivorous abomination,
Degeneration of humankind
"Let the screams of this bitch feed
Your blood hunger!!!"
Not your fucking slave
I'm the murderer
The reaper!!! Destroyer!!!
Your God!!!
I'm the eminence!
