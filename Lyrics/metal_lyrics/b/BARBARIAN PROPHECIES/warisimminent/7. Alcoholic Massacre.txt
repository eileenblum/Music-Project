FIRE!!!
I hear the call of hell, the beer is singing my name
I'll drink all the night, till I vomit on your face
Alcoholic Massacre!!!
The tavern is my kingdom
Beer and wine are my blood
Metal heads are my brothers and the tankard is my gun
I feel the evil in me, alcohol bring me to madness!
Infernal!
This night I have to reconquer my alcoholic war throne
Satan!
Alcoholic legions follow me, we drink till the death!
Beer!
