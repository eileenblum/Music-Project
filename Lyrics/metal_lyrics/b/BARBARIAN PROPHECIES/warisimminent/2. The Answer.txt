Fire and hate embrace my soul
I burn in the eternal flames of madness
Bearer of red fierce flames
Commanding the black hordes
To the battle
I can hear the screams from the forest
Who pray the renaissance of
Our anti-Christian hate
My destiny is to destroy the
Enemies of our land
Land of mighty warriors
Run Cowards! Bleed Cowards!
I'm leading the hordes to victory
And defending the honour
Of our ancestors
This world destroys my existence
In my path I'm the only one
The abyss still calling my name
The infernal screams from
The land of the strong ones
Are singing battle hymns of supremacy
The only way is the final solution
DIE!!!
666 - Burn their holy bible
666 - We must destroy the new
GOD!!!
