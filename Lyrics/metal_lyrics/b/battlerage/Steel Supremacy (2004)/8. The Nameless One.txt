Wath out, beware
He is calling
Cry out His name
Won't be forgotten
Madman, insane
Hideous chantings
Master or slave
The pain is rising
Burning inside
Beyond the circle
Temptation we fight
A ghastly figure
I fast, I pray
The gates are open

Here's the doom, as visions come true
As the final will come soon
The Nameless One just one more in line
As my mistake I realize

What was written, by many foretold
Now from the chaos descends
Creeping, crawling, takes back His world
In desolation I repent

Here's the doom, as visions come true
As the final will come soon
The Nameless One just one more in line
As my mistake I realize
