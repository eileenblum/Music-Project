Fallen brother
Hear my call
The proof is my blood
Windication I will brought
For I will fight with the sword of the lost
And the oeath will be heard in the storm
And in the end I know I will fall
Covered in the blood of the gods
Vengeance, the deathsong that rings in my head
Treason, my heart now is burning in pain
For I have seen the faces of death
Hatred, my sword and my bands lust for blood
Blinded by rage as the thunder comes forth
I swear by my blood you will die as dog
Brothers, in battle I'll honor your name
Carnage I'll brought and the havoe I'll reign
The killers will die they will perish in flames
Thunder and lightning my symbols of pride
Judgement has come, I will take all your lives
My stell meet your blodd, no one will survive
You will die
And I will fight with the sword of the lost
And my oath will be heard in the storm
And in the end I know I will fall
Covered in the blood of the gods
Darkness, my path will be covered in blood
Ashes will show Ive fulfilled my oath
You are the ones who have doomed your souls
Bloodshed and chaos, madness and pain
Breaking your bones I will take our your head
And in the end your bode I'll Burn
Vengeance, the deathsong that rings in my head
Treason, my heart now is burning in pain
For I have seen the faces of death
Hatred, my sword and my bands lust for blood
Blinded by rage as the thunder comes forth
I swear by my blood you will die as dog
Your must die
And I will fight with the sword of the lost
And my oath will be heard in the storm
And in the end I know I will fall
Covered in the blood of the gods
Brothers, in battle I'll honor your name
Carnage I'll brought and the havoe I'll reign
The killers will die they will perish in flames
Thunder and lightning my symbols of pride
Judgement has come, I will take all your lives
My stell meet your blodd, no one will survive
Darkness, my path will be covered in blood
Ashes will show Ive fulfilled my oath
You are the ones who have doomed your souls
Bloodshed and chaos, madness and pain
Breaking your bones I will take our your head
