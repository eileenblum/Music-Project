We're here again
We'll band your head
We'll blow away your brains
No time to escape
That's metal hell
The waek becomes the dead
Now the stage is exploding away
And the guitars are burning the rage
Lethal weapon, the power of hate
Spikes and leather in denim and hell

Exploding, Reloading
We kill as we play
Destroying, Slaughtering
The power we take

Heavy metal Axe
Cut your head apart
Life and Death means nothing when we play
Heavy metal Axe
Ready to attack
Join us cos now's too late to pray

We'll take their souls
We'll grind their bones
For now the time has come
Brought by the storm
Now die, you're gone
All hail the slaughter god
For the stage is exploding away
And the guitars are burning the rage
Lethal weapon, the power of hate
Spikes and leather in denim and hell

Exploding, Reloading
We kill as we play
Destroying, Slaughtering
The power we take

Heavy metal Axe
Cut your head apart
Life and Death means nothing when we play
Heavy metal Axe
Ready to attack
Join us cos now's too late to pray

Exploding, Reloading
We kill as we play
Destroying, Slaughtering
The power we take

Heavy metal Axe
Cut your head apart
Life and Death means nothing when we play
Heavy metal Axe
Ready to attack
Join us cos now's too late to pray
