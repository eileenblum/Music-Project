For vengeance our banner we rise
For metal we'll kill and we'll die
That flame of true warriors is burning
The power to slay the betrayer on sight
Our weapons were blessed in the storm
Hellfire has tempered our souls
With power we kill the deceiver
Our stell is the gift of the Wargods of Old

BATTLEAXE
Held high in the sky
FOR METAL
We're ready to fight
Is raging inside
OUR BLOOD
The false one must die
With our true metal fist on high
BATTLERAGE
BATTLERAGE
BATTLERAGE
BATTLERAGE

The metal slaughter we brough
The false ones will pay their blood
The wielders of steel we were chosen
Forever in power and glory we're bound
Now stand, be prepared for your doom
Don't pray, as the end will come soon
The time for your death is at hand
No mercy, the axeman has coming for you

BATTLEAXE
Held high in the sky
FOR METAL
We're ready to fight
Is raging inside
OUR BLOOD
The false one must die
With our true metal fist on high
