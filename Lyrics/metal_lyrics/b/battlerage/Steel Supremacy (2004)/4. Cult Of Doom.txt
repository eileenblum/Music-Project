Fire burns in darkness
The gates of hell are open wide
Enchantments of perversion
As the dead will come to life
Priests and soul ensalvers
Power hunger, evil rites

Beneath the desert
Something will awake
The Cult of Doom will take you
Your soul, the price to pay
Darkest secrets
Appearing in the night
The Cult of Doom will bless you
A bloody sacrifice

Lifeless bodies
Black energies will now shoe
In power and dominion
Dark shadows, they will roam
Silver daggers
Demand a sacrifice of blood

Beneath the desert
Something will awake
The Cult of Doom will take you
Your soul, the price to pay
Darkest secrets
Appearing in the night
The Cult of Doom will bless you
A bloody sacrifice

In power and dominion
Dark shadows, they will roam
Silver daggers
Demand a sacrifice of blood
Spells of pain and torment
Once just carrion, now reborn

Beneath the desert
Something will awake
The Cult of Doom will take you
Your soul, the price to pay
Darkest secrets
Appearing in the night
The Cult of Doom will bless you
