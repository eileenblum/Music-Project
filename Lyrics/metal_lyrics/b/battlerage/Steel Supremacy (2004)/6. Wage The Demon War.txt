WAGE THE DEMON WAR
The stars in the skies are aligned
The key and the door are present
We summon the powers maling
From beyond comes the horror and pain
The entrane is laid for my father
The priest now awake from their sleep
The demons that rest underwater
Will prey upon human and beast

WAGE THE DEMON WAR
Bring forth the end
WAGE THE DEMON WAR
Our world we take
WAGE THE DEMON WAR
Demise of man
WAGE THE DEMON WAR
Your feeble race
WAGE THE DEMON WAR

With Fire we bring you the torment
Again we are free to enslave
Mankind now sees hist last moment
As it perish in chaos and flames
The entrance is laid for my father
The priest now awake from their sleep
The demons that rest underwater
Will prey upon human and beast

WAGE THE DEMON WAR
Bring forth the end
WAGE THE DEMON WAR
Our world we take
WAGE THE DEMON WAR
Demise of man
WAGE THE DEMON WAR
Your feeble race
WAGE THE DEMON WAR
