Darkness sorround me
The fear is rising
My soul have awakened the beast
I fell how it fights
It's not death nor a life
It's the curse that moon will soon bring
Flesh can't contain
What is hidden inside
When the horror is coming to life
No mercy I'll have
Cos it bind me to hell
For now bloodlist and instinct prevail

The horror you've found
You know that with hell now I'm bound
Now fear my howl
You can't escape from the spawn
OF TERROR

Now play as the victim
I prowl through the night
Survive if you cant to my life
More horror you'll Know
As you claim for you soul
Hold your breath, it's your last
No trail of the human I was
Don't try to fight
From your fate you won't escape
Only silver can save you from pain

The horror you've found
You know that with hell now I'm bound
Now fear my howl
You can't escape from the spawn
OF TERROR

Darkness sorround me
The fear is rising
My soul have awakened the beast
I fell how it fights
It's not death nor a life
It's the curse that moon will soon bring
Now play as the victim
I prowl through the night
Survive if you cant to my life
Don't try to fight
From your fate you won't escape
Only silver can save you from pain

The horror you've found
You know that with hell now I'm bound
Now fear my howl
You can't escape from the spawn
OF TERROR
