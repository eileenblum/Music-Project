The storms of power in the sky
Proclaim the time has come
To slay the bastards who deny
To feed the slaughter gods

Witches dancing, flames arise
Our victory's on sight
You'll pay in blood for all your lies
For killing is our right

With iron spiked leather fists
We march into the fight
True metal army, unchained beasts
The rulers of the night

Relentlessly we hack and slay
The ones who hide the truth
'Cos metal is for what we stay
The axeman comes for you

Metal slaughter
We have this will to kill
Metal slaughter
To kill on sight the ones who deceive

Raise your weapons to the sky
Swear the vows of war
March on to the final fight
Fear won't make us fall

Relentlessly we hack and slay
The ones who hide the truth
With metal running through our veins
Our rage will fall on you

Metal slaughter
We have this will to kill
Metal slaughter
To kill on sight the ones who deceive
