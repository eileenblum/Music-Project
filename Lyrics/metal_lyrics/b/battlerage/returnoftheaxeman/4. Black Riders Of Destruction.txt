Chained down and condemned to die
I wait for my last time
The axe awaits to cut my head
To end my thread of crimes
My hands stained with the innocent
The blood of many lives
The circle's closed, hell awaits
Death on fullmoon's night

Bloodshed
Execution
Pain
Suffering

The sound of nightmares in my brain
Visions from beyond
Fiery torsos without heads
The horror coming forth
Tonight my body will be dead
But free will be my soul
To feast on those, the ones who fell
To ride forevermore

Nightmare
Retribution
Fullmoon
Alive again

Fire coming from within my soul
Ripping flesh, my body can't go on
Flaming steed becomes a part of me
For this killing spree's my destiny

Bloodshed, execution
Pain, suffering
Nightmare, retribution
Fullmoon, alive again

Black rider of destruction
Revenge forever rides
Black rider of destruction
Assassin in the night
Black rider of destruction
The blade attacks unheard
Black rider of destruction
Brings death across the land

Now the moon is shining in the sky
Blood will flow as someone has to die
Remember all your way through life
I'm the last that will see your eyes

Bloodshed, execution
Pain, suffering
Nightmare, retribution
Fullmoon, alive again

Black rider of destruction
Revenge forever rides
Black rider of destruction
Assassin in the night

Black rider of destruction
The blade attacks unheard
Black rider of destruction
Brings death across the land

It's fullmoon night
Our terror strikes
We wait in the fog ready to rise
It burns your mind
You're paralyzed
The forces of evil again will ride

Don't try to fight
Death drawing nigh
The headless avengers, to hell we're bind
You'll lose your life
Tonight you'll die
Your blood will forever run by our side

It's fullmoon night
The terror strikes
In the fog something wicked waits to rise
It burns my mind
I'm paralyzed
The forces of evil again will ride

No will to fight
Death drawing nigh
The headless avengers, to hell they're bind
I'll lose my life
Tonight I'll die
My blood will forever run by their side

Now the moon is shining in the sky
Blood will flow as someone has to die
Remember all your way through life
I'm the last that will see your eyes

Bloodshed, execution
Pain, suffering
Nightmare, retribution
Fullmoon, alive again

Black rider of destruction
Revenge forever rides
Black rider of destruction
Assassin in the night
Black rider of destruction
The blade attacks unheard
Black rider of destruction
Brings death across the land
