Grind their bones!!!

Raise our flag, the demon banner
Stained in holy blood
Through a path of skulls we ride
To bring 'em hell and storm
Swords of hate and doom we hold
The horns of death resound
Onwards on to victory
Their heads will hit the ground

Our black steeds of destruction
Crush to gore your feeble lines
As fire eats your bodies
Amidst the bloody cries
Raging steel, our metal axes
Cut your heads in two
We show no mercy, still alive?
A slow death waits for you

Grind their bones!!!
Cut their heads, rip their hearts, burn to dust
Grind their bones!!!
Leave behind just a shadow from the past
Grind their bones!!!
Take no slaves, kill them all, drink their blood
Grind their bones!!!
Burn their homes, leave the bodies to the dogs
Grind their bones!!!...

Your bodies fill the battleground
Your foul stench fills the air
We've come to kill and desecrate
Till there's nobody left
Screams of pain and agony
Echoing through the hills
Our mark is set, the path of war
The sign of blood and steel

The darkest powers have been pleased
With this offering of blood
To kill, to rape, to mutilate
For our demonic lords
Then in the dark we disappear
Leaving no trace behind
Blood, destruction, mayhem, fear
Is all what you will find

Grind their bones!!!
Cut their heads, rip their hearts, burn to dust
Grind their bones!!!
Leave behind just a shadow from the past
Grind their bones!!!
Take no slaves, kill them all, drink their blood
Grind their bones!!!
Burn their homes, leave the bodies to the dogs
Grind their bones!!!...

Down on your knees, you cry for mercy, no one stand by your side
But what you deserve is my execution, now I condemn you to die!!!

Our black steeds of destruction
Crush to gore your feeble lines
As fire eats your bodies
Amidst the bloody cries
Raging steel, our metal axes
Cut your heads in two
We show no mercy, still alive?
A slow death waits for you

The darkest powers have been pleased
With this offering of blood
To kill, to rape, to mutilate
For our demonic lords
Then in the dark we disappear
Leaving no trace behind
Blood, destruction, mayhem, fear
Is all what you will find

Grind their bones!!!
Cut their heads, rip their hearts, burn to dust
Grind their bones!!!
Leave behind just a shadow from the past
Grind their bones!!!
Take no slaves, kill them all, drink their blood
Grind their bones!!!
Burn their homes, leave the bodies to the dogs
Grind their bones!!!...
