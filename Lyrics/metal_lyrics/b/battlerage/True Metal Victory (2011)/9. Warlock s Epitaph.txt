What time and dust can't erase
is buried in dungeons eternal
Dark phrases are al that remains
Black spells and hexes infernal

Cast in stone
This is the law
This place right here before your eyes
The book unfolds
The raging storm
What came before the space and time

The end of all life
You're going to die
In blood they will thrive
And no one survives

IN BLOOD, IN STONE
THE WARLOCK'S EPITAPH
THE TOOL OF LONG DEAD GODS
THE KEY BEYOND THE STARS
PREPARE TO FALL,
PREPARE TO END IT ALL

His corpse has brought you tonight
Now cast the dark incantation
In dreams his book you have signed
A last pact of tribulation
