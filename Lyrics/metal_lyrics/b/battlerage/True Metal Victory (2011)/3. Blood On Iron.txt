Here we stand
Sword in hand,
where the thunder has broken the sky
Hearts on fire
Burning blood, for our enemy's coming to die

This time we'll fight
Our hate will rise
No mercy, the end is at hand
Run for your lives
Prepare to die
'cause in battlerage we will prevail

Death and hate, shining bright
Screams of pain fly thru the night
Stiff and cold, they fill the land
They're the fools who come to die
Blood on iron, death they found
Brothers, we are glory bound
Slaughtered into oblivion
Your warriors lie dead on the ground

BLOOD ON IRON
BLOOD ON IRON

Hands of fate
Have brought us here,
where no hero can tell you the tale

Tides of iron
Banners high, for our land
and our sons we won't fail

This time we'll fight
Our hate will rise
No mercy, the end is at hand
Run for your lives
Prepare to die
'cause in battlerage we will prevail

Death and hate, shining bright
Screams of pain fly thru the night
Stiff and cold, they fill the land
They're the fools who come to die
Blood on iron, death they found
Brothers, we are glory bound
Slaughtered into oblivion
Your warriors lie dead on the ground

Death and hate, shining bright
Screams of pain fly thru the night
Stiff and cold, they fill the land
They're the fools who come to die
Blood on iron, death they found
Brothers, we are glory bound
Slaughtered into oblivion
Your warriors lie dead on the ground
