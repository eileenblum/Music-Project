The darkest night begins
I gaze into the stars
This final victory comes crushing through the black

Vile deadly poison from the dreams of men
Obsidian gates, Acheron rises
from the deepest slumber

SETH CURSED MY SOUL
AS WRITTEN BY THE OLD ONES
MY WILL BE DONE

A story full of hate is coming to an end
Years of treachery
From darkness I have risen

With iron gauntlet I will rule your lives
Through eyes of serpent I'll command
this vermin from the shadows

SETH TAKES YOUR SOUL
AS WRITTEN BY THE OLD ONES
MY WILL BE DONE

A child of the light
I've killed in sacrifice
Your pity gods have seen
How his name now is mine

This land belongs to me,
my dark soul is his guide
I am the temple, high wizard,
somber priest of blackness

I AM THOTH-AMON
AS WRITTEN BY THE OLD ONES
MY WILL BE DONE
