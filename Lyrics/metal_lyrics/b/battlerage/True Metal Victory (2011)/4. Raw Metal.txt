Black leather
The night is coming, hear the sound
Our axes
A thunder roaring underground

Forever
Glory and pride is all I fell
Unchaining
the final majesty of steel

I feel the glory on the field
Prepare to bang your head, no turning back
We're proud and strong, we'll never kneel
Nobody will survive
No one survives when we attack

All hailing
The mighty hammers of the gods
Forever
It's now, the Axeman comes for you

I feel the glory on the field
Prepare to bang your head, no turning back
We're proud and strong, we'll never kneel
Nobody will survive
No one survives when we attack

Rise again, dark legions of the night
Follow us, our metal path is right
Stand with us, to one shall we kneel
We are the ones, our victory is real

RAW METAL
DARK MINIONS OF THE NIGHT
RAW METAL
THE IRON PATH IS RIGHT
RAW METAL
TO ONE SHALL WE KNEEL
RAW METAL
BLOOD, FIRE AND STEEL

I feel the glory on the field
Prepare to bang your head, no turning back
We're proud and strong, we'll never kneel
Nobody will survive
No one survives when we attack

Black leather
The night is coming, hear the sound
Our axes
A thunder roaring underground

Forever
Glory and pride is all I fell

Unchaining
the final majesty of steel

I feel the glory on the field
Prepare to bang your head, no turning back
We're proud and strong, we'll never kneel
Nobody will survive
No one survives when we attack
