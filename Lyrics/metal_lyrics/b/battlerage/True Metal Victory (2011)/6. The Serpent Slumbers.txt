In this wasteland
The gods have forlorn
With my treason
I'm getting this lore

I've murdered my friend, I've taken his name
For power I'm thirsty, for knowledge I crave

IN THE NAME
OF ANCIENT SLUMBER
I CALL THEE ACHERON
BRING ME YOUR DARKEST POWER
LET ME BE THE SERPENT'S
CHOSEN SON

Ancient black cave
Lying in wait
Sons of the serpent
Black minions from hell

In secret I worship, in shadows I walk
In darkness they wait, dead powers of old

IN THE NAME
OF ANCIENT SLUMBER
I CALL THEE ACHERON
BRING ME YOUR DARKEST POWER
LET ME BE THE SERPENT'S
CHOSEN SON
