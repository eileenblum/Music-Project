From the depths of Metal Hell
From the waste where demons dwell
Comes the bringer of your doom
Send you headless to the tomb

From an age of blood and death
Comes the iron painted red
Run in fear for your life
The axe is here, it's time to die

RETURN OF THE AXEMAN
HE'S COMING TO TAKE YOU
HE'S COMING TO KILL

Crimson harvest, burning pain
The metal slaughter has no end
Bloody tool to hack an slash
A pile of heads to stomp and crush

Devastation, metal kills
Deadly wine, your skull to fill
Rising of the Slaughter God
Raging fire, final war

RETURN OF THE AXEMAN
HE'S COMING TO TAKE YOU
HE'S COMING TO KILL
RETURN OF THE AXEMAN
AN OMEN OF TERROR
AND HATE TO FULFILL

From the depths of Metal Hell

Comes the bringer of your doom
Send you headless to the tomb

RETURN OF THE AXEMAN
HE'S COMING TO TAKE YOU
HE'S COMING TO KILL
RETURN OF THE AXEMAN
AN OMEN OF TERROR
