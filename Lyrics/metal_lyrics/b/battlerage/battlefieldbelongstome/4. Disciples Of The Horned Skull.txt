Fragments of horror
Corpses decay
Souless bodies
Secrets that belongs to the grave

We borrow in madness
We enter the darkest domains
Blackest worlds
Showing an hypnotic face

From the vast plains
Of the endless sands
The knowledge will come to us
Disciples of the horned skull we are
In horror they whisper
The truth from beyond
The lore of the damned
The power long time unknown

From the vast plains
Of the endless sands
The knowledge will come to us
Disciples of the horned skull we are

Fragments of horror
Corpses decay
Souless bodies
Secrets that belongs to the grave

From the vast plains
Of the endless sands
The knowledge will come to us
Disciples of the horned skull we are
