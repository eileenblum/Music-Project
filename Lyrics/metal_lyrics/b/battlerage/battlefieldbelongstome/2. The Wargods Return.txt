In power they once reigned as kings
On thrones of iron pride
With steel and glory they once rule
As monarchs of the night
Betrayed by false ones, by the damned
By bringers of the scorn
An omen now fulfilled in hate
The legend now reborn

WARGODS RETURN
In power and glory
With Iron and Steel!
WARODS RETURN
They reign of forever
They're in for the kill
WARGODS RETURN

But now they are alive again
They come for what is theirs
With power they will storm the night
To turn the warfield red
We are the chosen on their side
The weapons of their hate
Committed to fulfill their will
To spread our BATTLE RAGE

WARGODS RETURN
In power and glory
With Iron and Steel!
WARODS RETURN
They reign of forever
They're in for the kill
WARGODS RETURN
Alive for the battle
They're ready for war
WARGODS RETURN
Again they have chosen
The path of the storm

WARGODS RETURN
WARGODS RETURN
WARGODS RETURN
WARGODS RETURN
