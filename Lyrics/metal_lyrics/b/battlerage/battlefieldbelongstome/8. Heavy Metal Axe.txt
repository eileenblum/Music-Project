We're here again
We'll bang your head
We'll blow away your brains

No time to escape
That's metal hell
The weak becomes the dead

Now the stage is exploding away
And the guitars are burning in rage
Lethal weapon, the power of hate
Spikes and leather in denim and hell

Exploding
Reloading
We kill as we play
Destroying
Slaughtering
The power we take
Heavy metal axe
Cut your head apart
Life and death means nothing when we play
Heavy metal axe
Ready to attack
Join us cos now's too late to pray

We'll take their souls
We'll grind their bones
For now the time has come

Brought by the storm
Now die, you're gone
All hail the slaughter god

For the stage is exploding away
And the guitars are burning in rage
Lethal weapon, the power of hate
Spikes and leather in denim and hell

Exploding
Reloading
We kill as we play
Destroying
Slaughtering
The power we take

Heavy metal axe
Cut your head apart
Life and death means nothing when we play
Heavy metal axe
Ready to attack
Join us cos now's too late to pray
