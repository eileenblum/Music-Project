Temptation beheld me
I've fallen, I've lost my throne
Forgotten, exiled
A king with no crown to wear

Condemned to the darkside
Doom calling out my name
Forces that twist my mind
Cursed black steel in my hand

My soul now withers away
Damned by my own hand
Voices inside my head
Hear what the demons say

Held high the Chaos sword! [x4]

The power inside me
It gives back what once was mine
I'm back now avenged
The white wolf with crimson eyes

Possessed by the fury
To battle we're marching forth
I'm cursed forever
In my hands I wiled the storm

My soul has withered away
Damned by my own hand
Voices inside my head
Hear what the demons say

Held high the Chaos sword! [x4]
