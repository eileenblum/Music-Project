Now darkness covers the warfield
And silence is drowning the night
The path you have chosen is over
For the thunder has called me to fight

Vengeance screaming high
As I draw the iron beheader
Fear coming nigh
When the vision of death comes your way

In blood you'll pay
Vindication for the fallen
In blood you'll pay
The justice of the damned
In blood you'll pay
You'll pay the price of vengeance
In blood you'll pay
The axe of judgment has coming your way

The fire of hatred is burning
The hour of doom comes at hand
Revenge in the name of my brothers
In battle by steel I will stand

Avenger of the damned
A slash to erase you forever
The bringer of the end
Only banishment waits in the end

In blood you'll pay
Vindication for the fallen
In blood you'll pay
The justice of the damned
In blood you'll pay
You'll pay the price of vengeance
In blood you'll pay
The axe of judgment has coming your way

Vindication for the fallen
The axe of judgment has coming your way

In blood you'll pay
Vindication for the fallen
In blood you'll pay
The justice of the damned
In blood you'll pay
You'll pay the price of vengeance
In blood you'll pay
The axe of judgment has coming your way
