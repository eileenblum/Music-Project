Unholy summoning chants
Foul, nauseating winds
Arcane scriptures of madness
Darkness reigns supreme

Hidden black circle
The goat stands in pride
The legions are waiting
Bloody sacrifice

Obscene desecration
Praise the hellish beast
Altars of madness
A monument of sin

Covenant of witchery
Raise the horns in blasphemy
Blood and fear, death and hell

Morbid rites of heresy
Killing ways of ecstasy
Horror for the souls who fell

From the deepest hell
Comes the evil forth
Where the demons dwell
The perversion takes form

Hidden black circle
The goat stands in pride
The legions are waiting
Bloody sacrifice

Listen to the bestial cries
Bounded creatures of the night
Resound the evil ancient tongue

As the storm begins to rise
Terror fills the souls who die
Against the light the demon song

From the deepest hell
Comes the evil forth
Where the demons dwell
The perversion takes form

Covenant of witchery
Raise the horns in blasphemy
Blood and fear, death and hell

Morbid rites of heresy
Killing ways of ecstasy
Horror for the souls who fell

Listen to the bestial cries
Bounded creatures of the night
Resound the evil ancient tongue

As the storm begins to rise
Terror fills the souls who die
Against the light the demon song

From the deepest hell
Comes the evil forth
Where the demons dwell
The perversion takes form
