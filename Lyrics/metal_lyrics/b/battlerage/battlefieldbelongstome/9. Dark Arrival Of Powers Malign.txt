May what was written
And by many foretold
Descend from the Chaos beyond
And take back His world

Ritual summoning
Has taken my soul
Atlantean transcription
Dark wisdom of old

Fasting and prayers
Hearing the dogs as they bark
Forbidden knowledge
In communion with the stars

Mysterious wastelands
That must remain forgotten
Condemned and sunk
Gates never to be opened

Prepare for His coming
Prepare for the end of the world
The globular horror
The coming of the All-In-One

Hideous chantings
Performed by unhuman tongues
Cyclopean visions
They come from beyond

Prowling from the planes
He, who's the Key and the Door
Through space time continuum
Comes the last vision of the world

Prepare for His coming
Prepare for the end of the world
The globular horror
The coming of the All-In-One

May what was written
And by many foretold
Descend from the Chaos beyond
And take back His world

Prepare for His coming
Prepare for the end of the world
The globular horror
The coming of the All-In-One
