Voices like thunder are rising
The blow of the hammer resounds
The fools who deny this my warning
Will fall dead and cold to the ground
Chosen the wielder of steel
The wargods of old by my side
My armies are in for the kill
Onwards to glory we'll ride

Born to conquer, not to serve
Raised by wolves, on mankind I've fed
Not for heaven, not for hell
Into the glory of battle again

By steel
I take your lives
By steel
I spread the fear
Before me
All men shall kneel
By steel
I reign supreme

The false ones will call me the tyrant
Their ashes will tell that they're right
Forever in power and glory
The strongest will stand by my side
We're destined to rule by the sword
Forever with steel we are bound
We bring you the metal slaughter
The keys to your death we have found

Born to conquer, not to serve
Raised by wolves, on mankind I've fed
Not for heaven, not for hell
Into the glory of battle again

By steel
I take your lives
By steel
I spread the fear
Before me
All men shall kneel
By steel
I reign supreme

Born to conquer, not to serve
Raised by wolves, on mankind I've fed
Not for heaven, not for hell
Into the glory of battle again

By steel
I take your lives
By steel
I spread the fear
Before me
All men shall kneel
By steel
I reign supreme
