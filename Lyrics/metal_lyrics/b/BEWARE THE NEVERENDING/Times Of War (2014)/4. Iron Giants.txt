Behold the pride of the rising sun
All powerful and never faltering
We stand like iron giants It's us against the world
Let's take it to the sky
This time we take the fight to them

With all our hearts we take it to the sky
With all our souls we take it to the sky
[x2]

This time we take the fight to them...
and we won't stop until there's nothing left

Tonight we rewrite history with blood,honor, and integrity
As we cleanse this earth of the filth and the scum this is our path our destiny
We are the chosen few of a proud and powerful empire
The weight of the world; our gift to all comes crashing down on me

comes crashing down on me
(on me)
comes crashing down on me

With all our hearts we take it to the sky
With all our souls we take it to the sky
[x2]

Behold the pride of the rising sun
All powerful and never faltering
We stand like iron giants It's us against the world

We stand like iron giants it's us against the world [x2]
