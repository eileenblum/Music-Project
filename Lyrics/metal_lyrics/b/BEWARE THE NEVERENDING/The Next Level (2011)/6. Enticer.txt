Searching for that light within the darkness. This world will do nothing but drag you down. I know there's more to life than what I've seen. It's so easy to lose focus. I fall to you. As I fall into darkness, save me. I'm numb and I'm broken, call me. As I fall into darkness, save. You are my salvation. Help me find a way to grow to rise up and overcome. Help me find a way to see through the destruction that I've done. I know the battle rages on. The war has just begun. Our struggle seems to never end. Still searching for the answers on my own. Forgive me I am just a man. Through every trial and tribulation. I'll never lose focus on you.
