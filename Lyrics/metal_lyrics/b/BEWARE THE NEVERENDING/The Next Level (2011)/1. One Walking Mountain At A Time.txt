Coward, you talk big when no one else is around. Manipulator, who got your back now. You've burned every bridge you created. How can you expect to go anywhere, when nowhere is all that you know? Through all the lies. I still can't believe I have compassion for you. I feel your anger swelling. Hatred has over come. Because I wont' cave in. We all been there before, but that's no excuse to stay stuck where you are. Pick yourself up and set your sights towards solid ground. Follow me onto the path of new beginnings. And walk through fire with me. There is strength beyond this world. More glory than you can imagine. A love greater than all of us. I found strength and glory beyond this world. Tell me, what have you found, in the darkness of this world?
