Oh my God, what have we done? To be blessed with such a privilege, the right to make a choice. Between right and wrong. The option to succeed or to fail. We don't deserve the right for our human flaw. And I am thankful for every breath I take. I can make an impact. Everybody in this room. Get up! Get up! There is something more to this. Let's move! Let's move! We are not stuck in the past. I am living proof that over coming failures will make you much stronger. Now it's time to show that you can make an impact. Let's move!
