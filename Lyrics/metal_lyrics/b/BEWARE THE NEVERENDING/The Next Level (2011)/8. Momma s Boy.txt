Through these many years, you have always been there for me. You have stood there by my side, when no one else had my back. And I am proud to be called your son. I will never take anything you've done for me for granted. Through the best of times, the worst of times, this love will never end and I will always confide in you. I hope you know, you never let me down. One thing is for sure. You made your family proud. I understand you did the best with what you had. You already gave the best gift of all. Unconditional Love. This one is for you, my mother dear. No matter what I will always be here. Words cannot express the extent of the legacy that you'll leave behind. I understand you won't always be here, but you'll live on through us. And forever in out hearts. Mother, I hope you know you were an angel sent from God. To watch over me. I will give my all for you. You are the reason why I still exist.
