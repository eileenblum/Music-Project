This is my life. And I refuse to let you take it from me ever again. We all know how this will end. I've grown so much since then. Back up and know your place. I've seen it all too many times before. To the point I am running out patients for you. I can't handle this anymore. You played your worth out, until there's nothing left. Nightmares and horror stories, flood my dreams with memories. Reconile, Coexist, but don't give in. Now, this is me finding who I am. In this newfound freedom. I am finally free. This is my life and I refuse to give it to you. I will not endure, the pain you caused me, anymore. Back up and know your place. I've seen it all too many times. That I have run out of patients for you. Burn all your memories. There's nothing left to see. Except silhouettes of broken dreams.
