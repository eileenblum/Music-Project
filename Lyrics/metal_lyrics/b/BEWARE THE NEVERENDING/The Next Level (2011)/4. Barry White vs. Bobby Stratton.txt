Tell me how bad you really want to hear these words again. How bad do you really want to feel this warm embrace? Of what it felt like, to be whole. This can't be what you planned at all. It's clear that you have lost control. Turn and face me. I want the truth. I'm sick of hearing all these lies. Spare me, the excuse and get to the point. I didn't take your life from you. You shape your own destiny. But you lack the common sense you were blessed with, to see the path that's in front of you. There's nothing left to take from me. I'll wait on you, forever, I'll see you through anything. Grace is in your grasp, but you have to want it. Before we can pick you up and put things back together. After you struggle, after you break. You'll never be the same. And we are not afraid. We are not afraid. When tomorrow breaks, we won't be the same. I want more, than just a broken promise to myself. I want more, than just the disappointment that buries me. We want, more than just a feeling. We want more, than empty words from empty hearts, from empty hearts.
