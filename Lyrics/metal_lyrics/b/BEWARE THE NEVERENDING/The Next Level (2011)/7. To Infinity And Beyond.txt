Another day goes by wasting away in a make believe world. You keep on pretending. Nieve ignorance can't hurt you. What have you become? Nothing more than just a child's plaything. Makes you question, were you even really at all or are we just imagination? My ego blinds me. Set your sights to the window of opportunity. There is a way out. I won't give up now. I know someone out there still needs me. I could fly if I wanted to, but I chose not to embarrass you cowboy. I don't fly from grace, I fall will style. What I lack in confidence I make up in denial. Now hold your horse spaceman. I am the one true, the original law. And don't you think for a second you'll replace me. I've been here since the start. You are a toy and nothing more. But no matter what you have a friend in me.
