God, what if I died today? Would I meet you tomorrow? Could my presence introduce you to all? To be your light through the darkness. Could you grant me strength, to convey? That you are greater than any sorrow. So God, what if I died today? Would I meet you tomorrow? Father, what if I died? Could I meet you tomorrow? Could my life show, that your light could pierce the darkness? Could you give me strength, strength enough to convey? That you are greater than any sorrow. And I am speaking of the one true God. Giving praise to his place of worth. All confident. I am not ashamed. So my our lives never be the same.
