This is where I draw the line. From hear on on out. You're with or against me. One by one they fall they don't understand what it takes to be a man. Their hope is falling. Faith is weakened by the lack of morals. All they know is know is indecency. Shoved down their throats. They don't deserve the false path they've been shown. Force feed them violence. Hearts beat with bitter blood. They know nothing more but their sins and hatred. On pedestals they watch their brothers die. they can't see their insecurities. The best example that they give, eye's show nothing more than the full extent of the wretched hypocrites. They try to call me out. I am not like you I will never cave into the lies.
