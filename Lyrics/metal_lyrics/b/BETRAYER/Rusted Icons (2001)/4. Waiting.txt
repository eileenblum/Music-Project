I'll be your only
I'm bleeding for you
I'm in the shadows
I'm waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know your secrets
I'll be your nightmare
You make me stronger
Come feed my hunger

[Chorus]
You'll always be mine
Take your last breath
Forever in time
You'll always be mine
Take your last breath
Together in death

I will consume you
I will become you
Dare not betray me
I'm waiting for you

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo]

You're my possession
I'm your misery
My sweet obsession
I'm your fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
