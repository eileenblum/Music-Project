Listen to this warning
Better listen good they said
Prepared you for a mission
Fed all their thoughts in your head
Without me, you're going nowhere
Did they forget who they serve?
Leading sheep to the slaughter
They're gonna get what they deserve
Seeking out the powerless
Son, Step right up to my booth
Amazed at first is what you'll be
Until you hear the real truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Convert them all I command
Just Satan's helping hand
Pleasing the wrong side
and now they run and hide

[Chorus]
Descendants of death,
False prophets arise
Every word from their breath
Brings closer their demise
Descendants of death,
False prophets arise
Every word from their breath
Will bring forth people's cries

They'll sink their teeth into your soul
Filling up on selfish gain
Oh God, I didn't know
Man, it's driving me insane
Didn't learn things for myself
I guess I really didn't care
Only did what I was told
My mind contains only air
A question raised to be answered
Why do the so called wise,
Disregard common sense?
Be set free, no more lies!

[Pre-Chorus/Chorus]
[Solo/Chorus/Solo]
