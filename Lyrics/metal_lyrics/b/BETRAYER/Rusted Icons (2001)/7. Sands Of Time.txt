Changes last with you forever
Things you've done for me remembered
Prayers I made, have finally come true
Gratefulness I give to you

I never knew, never trusted
Never believed, until you

Oh, if I didn't have you in my life
I would be lost, so empty inside
Learning to trust we have come together
I will be with you forever

[Post-Chorus]
As the sands of time fade away
We'll share the final moments of our days

[Solo]

Words that I have left unsaid
Promises of years ahead

I never tried, never had faith
Never dreamed, without you

[Chorus]
[Post-Chorus]
