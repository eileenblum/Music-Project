Times of revolution
Ends to commercial greed
The winds of change have come
Kill the source the monster needs
Thunder builds underground
Swelling, twisted metal sounds

We will fight against trends
Our crusade never ends
Liberate empty minds
Go against common grind

Meaningless
Selfishness
No heart

[Chorus]
Ride upon the plastic airwaves
Sell your soul once more
Hide behind their polished icons
Like cowards before
We hold strong that we will survive
No more fear
Strength in sound
No more hiding
Cause we won't back down

Destined rebellion
Music made for the fans
The tides are shifting now
Dismiss corporate demands
Renaissance, gaining force
Momentum from the truest source

Brutal truth lies ahead
See the lies they feed
Heroes, rusted. Idols, fake
Bonds of trust, theirs to break

Treachery
Shamelessly
No soul

[Chorus/Solo/Chorus]
