In a world of pain
There's always a way to die
People not caring
For what's all inside
Blood and guts lie
Across the fields of war
But we're still standing

The smoke clears
We see it now
All your wretched ways
But I won't take your pain

As the years grow longer
We all feel the rage
Of a wide world
Caving in with hate
Many keep falling
In this world of pain
But we keep holding on

The smoke clears
We see it now
All your wretched ways
But I won't take your pain

[Pre-Chorus]
You stole a piece of me
Yet I see you in myself
This twisted road of life
Ends in utter hell

Mirrored face to face
Shadows in the mind
Living your disgrace
Broken fate I find
Now we're face to face
And I draw the line
Fear clouding your eyes
As I watch you die

Finally the whole world
Has come to an end
Many hearts broken
Awaiting another chance
Not understanding
That their time has come
But we still stand here, alive

The smoke clears
We see it now
All your wretched ways
But I won't take your pain

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Solo]
