If there's a will there is a way
Innovation
Focus and drive, no one will deny
Realization

Thousands in line advancing design
Break through the wall to find it all
Visions in mind expanding through time
All that we know, the stream it flows
Back to you

Gathering near, about to appear
Integration
Race to behold the future unfold
Inspiration

Now, as you begin to see
Find all that you dare to dream
Caught in a mystery
A new creation to last all through time
