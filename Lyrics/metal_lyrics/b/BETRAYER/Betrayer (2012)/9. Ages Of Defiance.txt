Infiltrate, desecrate
Instigate them to retaliate
Sorcery, violently
Architecture of symbology

Congregation of society's elite
Subjugation, under their control

Ages of defiance, unholy alliance
Temporary payoffs, order out of chaos
The world dies in their hands

Years of lies, false allies
Corruption breeds and our freedom dies
Secrecy, conspiracies
This plague spreads throughout our history

Segregation to divide and conquer all
Domination of your mind and soul

Unseen hand rules the land
When will we wake up and see their plan?
It's all there, plain to see
Time to rise and save humanity

Congregation of society's elite
Subjugation, under their control

Ages of defiance, unholy alliance
Temporary payoffs, order out of chaos
Ages of defiance, unholy alliance
Temporary payoffs, order out of chaos
The world dies in flames
