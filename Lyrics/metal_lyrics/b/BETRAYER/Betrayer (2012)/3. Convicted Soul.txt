Endless days, tortured nights
Restless road to my own sacrifice
Forgiveness paid in blood
Wounded spirits falling from above

Turned to ashes from within
Dust to dust

Forever lost, blinded by hate
There's no salvation, no escape
You cannot live, they'll crucify
Convicted soul sentenced to die

Twisted mind gone astray
Truth and justice dragging me away
Useless fight, can't break free
Bound in chains for all eternity
