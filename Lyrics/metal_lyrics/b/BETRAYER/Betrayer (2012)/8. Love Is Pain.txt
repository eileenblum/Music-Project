You say you need a little time
But all I need is you
So do things you gotta do
Push me through another change
And I'll wait here

As I look to find a reason
Try to find my way,
Through the darkened shadows
As I long for yesterday
And I'm lost as I remember
How it felt in your embrace
Haunting desperation
In this cold and empty place...Love is pain

You say you feel we've grown apart
If only I had seen where it went wrong
A prisoner by my own design
Never heard the rain until the storm broke down

Now I look to find a reason
Try to find my way
Through the darkened shadows
As I long for yesterday
And I'm lost as I remember
How it felt in your embrace
Haunting desperation
In this cold and empty space
I'm still searchin' for a reason
Try to find my way
Through the darkened shadows
As I long for yesterday
And I'm lost as I remember
How it felt in your embrace
Haunting desperation
In this cold and empty place
Love is pain
