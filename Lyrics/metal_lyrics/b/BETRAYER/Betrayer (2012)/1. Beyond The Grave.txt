Saving grace, another place
To rest any weary soul
Finally found my peace mind
I've learned to see the light

Every day
When I'm walking through the fire
When I'm walking through the flames
You are always there to take me by the hand
You are there to show the way

Feeling paralyzed
Slowly close my eyes
Dying to survive
Want to feel alive
Taken by the lies
But your love never dies
Now I realize
I can see beyond the grave

Lost and found, became unbound
To reach forever higher
Far away or here to stay
I feel you close beside me
