Taken away
Never to return, they've got no right
To celebrate
What has been erased and brought back to life
Leave us alone
We don't wanna fight your losing battles
Labour of hate
Breathing in the fires of self destruction

Try to stop what has already begun
There's no resistance if they kill everyone
Deceiving to bring about their own means
And overthrow a system that they don't need
Transformation

Into the fold
Covered in the blood of mass confusion
Pulling the strings
Silence in the form of desolation

Prince of the powers of the air
Illumination, sow the tares
The mystery shall be revealed
To consummate the end of time
