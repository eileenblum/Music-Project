Walk the streets alone to find
Something that will please my mind
Searching for the perfect high
Please someone help me answer why
Is this life I live my own?
Or am I some created clone?
Mimicking the thoughtless breeds
Can't see where the future leads
All my years have come and gone
With hopes and dreams still to be done
As the past, it slips away
We all must face another day

Pressures upon me grow and grow
I cannot seem to let them go
If destiny is calling me
Then why am I too blind to see?
The inner vision, prodigy
Which instills virtuosity
Dedicated to short term goals
Will ignite fire to the coals

Getting use to this abuse
Makes it hard to be set loose
The freedom I now possess
Sometimes makes me want it less
Tempted to go the first time
Now I'm spending my last dime
Crushed by the reality
Of paying this huge worthless fee
