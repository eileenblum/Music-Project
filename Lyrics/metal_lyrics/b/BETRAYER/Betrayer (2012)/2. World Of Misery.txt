Welcome to the darkness
A world that never has an end
Memories of failure are torturing
I can't escape

In my mind, in my dreams
Whispering, thoughts of madness reign supreme
All is lost, no way out
Suffering, will there ever be a change?
Endless voices calling

You lied to me
Nothing's what it seems
I hear the screams
I'm living in a world of misery
It's all a dream
Nothing's what it seems
I hear the screams
I'm living in a world of misery

Paranoid delusions
The pieces crumble to the floor
Like a stream of anger
I'll fight until I am no more

Moving on, time to live
Free at last, break the bonds of honesty
Building up, tearing down
Casting out seven legions of the damned
Endless voices calling

I wanna believe that there's a way
To get out of this oh Lord I pray
Annihilation of the fool
Who thought that he was loved by you
