You walked into my life
Opened up the door
Everything I believed
Just came crashing to the floor
In the blink of an eye
Lost and found again
I was waiting for you
And I could not comprehend
I was alone

There's a feeling, I know
I was not to blame
For the things that you said
And the things that you became
Then I found out the truth
Was not found in you
And the promise of love
Keeps its hold on me no longer

Can it be as I'm waiting for tomorrow
Everything in my life is filled with sorrow
Turning back through the pages of a lifetime
Innocence is forgotten in the fading light

Now I'm taking my time
Watch it slip away
Never felt so alive
Hope this feeling's here to stay
Finally made up my mind
I won't be the one
Taken in by your lies
My destruction made you stronger
