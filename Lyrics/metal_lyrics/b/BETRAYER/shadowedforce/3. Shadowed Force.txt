[Verse I]
Human race watches you
There's nothing that you can do
Robotic brains, small mainframes
Processing your every move

[Verse II]
Secrets lost by a shadowed force
Downloading their captured source
Knowledge spreads throughout the world
There's nothing that we can do

[Chorus]
Making my journey back homeward
I must live where I belong
Far away from civilization
It feels so right it can't be wrong

[Verse III]
Virtual images
Satellites tracking you all
No escape from this database
Freedom is not in this place

[Repeat Chorus]

[Solo - Lozon]
[Solo - Klingbeil]
[Solo - Lozon]
