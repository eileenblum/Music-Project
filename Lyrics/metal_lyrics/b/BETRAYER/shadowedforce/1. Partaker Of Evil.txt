[Solo - Lozon]

[Verse I]
I want a better way
to live my life today
Don't wanna think about your tragedy
Ain't gonna lose my life to save you
from the hand of death

[Verse II]
How can the human race
turn on itself with burning hate?
Is this a government conspiracy?
We have the power to defend them
Will we set them free?

[Pre-Chorus]
We choose to look the other way
while they are

[Chorus]
Butchering
Slaughtering
Leaders lied
Genocide

[Verse III]
Despair, fear with trembling
Cries to deaf ears, no one's listening
Systematic killing rapidly
Vengeance taken by the ones who cannot see

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo - Lozon]
[Solo - Klingbeil]
[Solo - Lozon]

[Repeat Chorus]
