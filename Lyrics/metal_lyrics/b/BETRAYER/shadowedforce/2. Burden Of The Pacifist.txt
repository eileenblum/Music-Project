[Verse I]
Lingering over my dying son
Filled with vengeance, I grab my gun
On the hunt now, it won't be long
Till I pull the trigger, let justice be done

[Pre-Chorus]
Can this take the pain away?
They've got to pay

[Chorus]
Tyrants of freedom are casting their spell
We must never surrender to Hell
Plotting destruction this war never ends
You can lay down your arms but you'll
perish by their hands

[Verse II]
Pressing onward, survivals way
Consuming darkness, the light of day
Unrelenting, won't let me be
On a quest to kill, the enemy

[Repeat Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo - Lozon]
[Solo - Klingbeil]

[Repeat Chorus]

Sacrificed to their god
