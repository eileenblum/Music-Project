I've lost all motivation.
My stomach will never be full.
Nothing will bring me the solace that I used
to find in the eyes of the dead.
Somber cries lost their edge.
Murder won't get me up anymore.
I have become a drone.
Portraying the very weakness that I despise.
Obedience.
Threads the eye then stitches my mouth closed.
What have I become?
I have become a drone.
Portraying the very weakness that I despise.
Obedience.
Threads the eye then stitches my mouth closed.
I have no direction.
I'm back to searching and guessing again.
So perplexed.
My mind is broken to pieces again.
I have become a drone.
Enslaved by the very master that you all trust.
Ignorance.
Threads the eye then stitches your eyes closed.
What have I become?
A disgrace.
Enter this silk home a larvae.
Exit a creature that can fly away from here.
Leaving this bullshit behind.
I wish I could leave it all behind.
I am all alone.
This prison has become my mind.
So desperate to end this.
I gladly give my life.
It's over.
This gorgeous day has turned to black.
I forfeit.
I gladly give my life.
