Born of flesh and free will, yet I never chose this fate.
Veins replaced with wires.
Nerves becoming obsolete.
I can't feel a thing.
So persuasive I might give in.
Numb to everything.
If this is all real then I give up.
Born of flesh and free will, yet I never chose this fate.
Veins replaced with wires.
Nerves becoming obsolete.
I never chose this.
Living a life that's played out.
There's no way out.
Close my eyes hope that nothing is wrong.
Living a life that's played out.
There's no way out.
Close my eyes shut the door on your way out.
And you wonder why I'm so oblivious.
Because I'm told what to think.
Just like everyone else.
I'm fucking fed an illusion.
Replacing sense with confusion.
I can't feel a thing.
So persuasive I might give in.
Numb to everything.
If this is all real then I give up.
I give up.
I am among the dead.
Pulse for the serpent's head.
And you wonder why I'm so oblivious.
Because I'm told what to think.
Just like everyone else.
I'm fucking fed an illusion.
Replacing sense with confusion.
I'm fucking fed an illusion.
Feed me all my thoughts.
Indoctrinate my fragile mind.
Feed me all my thoughts.
Initiate my commands.
I'll carry them out.
No hesitation.
They hide in my thoughts.
They pose as my own.
Feed me my every thought.
Indoctrinate my fragile mind.
Feed me my every thought.
Initiate my command.
