I keep repeating the same mistakes.
Constantly struggling to please their eyes.
Please fucking close them.
I'm losing my patience.
They keep feeding on their right to control.
Squeezing the last breath from deep inside my lungs.
God show me true freedom.
You know it's mine.
Please give me the answers.
I'm fucking blind.
Beneath the realm of consciousness.
Fabricated thoughts implanted.
Beneath the realm of consciousness.
They own you and they own me.
Beneath the realm of consciousness.
Fabricated thoughts implanted.
Arable minds prepared for the seed of control.
A constitution of voluntary slavery.
They want our lives.
Dreamers become projectors of spoon-fed lies.
Know that this will never end.
I'm speaking to no one.
Because no one is listening.
Distracted by lies.
Open your eyes.
This is the reason that they own our lives.
We have become nothing.
