Traumitization.
Tied to a chair then gagged.
Tortured then programmed.
Admit this mind into a trance.
Memories now hidden.
Everything I fucking know.
Forgotten.
Forever.
Everything I fucking know.
Who the fuck am I now?
Hypnotized, tortured, then instilled into me.
Perpetual alters to my reality.
Subconscious whispers beg to be heard by me.
They're constantly repeating the same commands.
Hear me O' child.
Dance like a puppet that's hanging.
Hanging from a noose.
Move with the masses they're blind.
Hear me O' child.
Dance like a puppet that's hanging.
Hanging from a noose.
Move with the masses they move to a fucking trance.
The triggers lie beneath the media.
The thoughts aren't my own but who gives a shit?
Force-fed some lies so I'm ignorant.
The voices repeat in my head.
Replaying over and over again.
Misleading.
The voices repeat in my head.
You are nothing but a slave.
Programmed to obey.
Servant to a hidden reich.
Fucking obey.
The voices repeat.
My nightmares are my escape.
Lies dissect then rebuild me.
Erasing the traces of free will that I have left.
Void.
Resilience is hopeless.
This bullshit is infesting my mind.
It only multiplies.
