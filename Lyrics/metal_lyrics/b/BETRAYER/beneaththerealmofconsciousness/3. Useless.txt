Watch me as I cut off your head.
Depicting what's useless as dead.
Capture a glimpse of my face.
Memories drift into space.
Either I kill you or I'll have the life sucked out of me.
I just follow orders.
Silence the prey before they have a chance to speak.
Am I going crazy?
Or am I the one who's chosen
to cleanse this fucking world?
It's so hard to tell now.
Innocence becomes surreal.
Merciless.
It's hard to feel.
My hands stained with blood.
It seems so real.
Watch me as I cut off your head.
Depicting what's useless as dead.
Capture a glimpse of my face.
Memories drift into space.
It's only getting harder to grasp existence.
I only answer to the voices in my head.
This is existence, insidious illness.
Infection is spreading throughout my whole mind.
My life's contingent on following orders.
I'm fucking useless if I don't comply.
Watch me as I cut off your head.
Depicting what's useless as dead.
Capture a glimpse of my face.
Memories drift into space.
Drift into space.
I'm now a faceless drone.
Spending my life alone.
I'm just a fucking tool.
Played for a fucking fool.
It's only getting harder to grasp existence.
I only answer to the voices in my head.
Recollect, nothing's real.
Race for the top, you'll see me there.
A place in the stars, looking down.
This may be fake but I don't care.
Come with me.
Let's indulge.
Fuck the truth we're built on lies.
Build this dream until it dies.
Then bury the remnants.
No one will know.
Capture a glimpse of my face.
Your life is erased.
Watch me as I cut off your head.
Depicting what's useless as dead.
Capture a glimpse of my face.
Memories drift into space.
