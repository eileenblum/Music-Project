Serpent, goat, spider and skull
Corpses beneath the ground
Bring forth to this mortal
The truth that lie unfound
Serpent, goat, spider and skull
Corpses beneath the ground
Bring forth to this mortal
The truth that lie unfound
Serpent, goat, spider and skull
Corpses beneath the ground
Bring forth to this mortal
The truth that lie unfound
The unfound truth
The unfound truth

I have no mouth and I must scream
I have not eyes yet I must cry
Robbed of my identity
Behind this fa?e my soul hides
I search for the unfound truth
Traveling on through this land
Of lies and misery
The spider has weaved my tragic
Destiny

Skyward upon the mountain
I hear the goat
It calls my name
Begging for forgiveness
For the suffrage he had wrought
I answer with words of forgiving

Praise: "Worry not goatlord
For the serpent guides my way"

Although I may suffer
Although at night I cry
One day I will overcome
Those who'd shun me down
As I pour their blood into the
Skulls' eyes

Serpent, goat, spider and skull
Corpses beneath the ground
Bring forth to this mortal
The truth that lie unfound
