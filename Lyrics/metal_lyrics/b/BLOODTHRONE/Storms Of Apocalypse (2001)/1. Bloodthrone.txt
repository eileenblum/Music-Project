Bleeding throne, living within a lie
Bleeding throne, someones going to?die
Black clouds fill the sky
Who would dare to speak
To reveal the hate for the kings newborn son
The heir to his throne
Into a deep dark trance he fell

Planning for the future
Of the life and death of his
Kin!

Fifteen years have passed by
Soon the king will die
The prince will be the one to blame
For the sadness and the shame
Little does he know his uncle
Will be the one to blame

Bleeding throne, living within a lie
Bleeding throne someone has died
Cold steel clashes as warriors fall
In blood they lie
Blood against blood, swords bite sharp
Now the king goes down
Dead mans last bed
The prince sees a fallen soul
That he will never know

Fight is hard ad axes are swung
Blood stained steel ripping flesh
Death shall be done
Uncle I will finish what you had begun
Revenge in his eyes as his sword
Pierces his uncles heart

The prince now watches as his uncle dies
The battle is settled alone stands one man
The prince glances across the battlefield
Knowing that his father has passed through
The golden gates
