Far beyond the fields of death
Within realms of sacred shadows
Where once brutal wars were waged
Lies the path to darkest eternity
Where the forest still feeds
The shadows of hatred
And the mountain faces the infinity of
Darkness

How many battles
Have these trees beheld
How many battles have
these trees beheld

Amidst the darkness
Of it's cavernous eternity
Remains the unending
Echoes of the repentful
The ancient tales
Of sorrow
And visions of the
Disdained

Guided by unseen hands of darkness
To a place where no light dwells
I search still for the misery that is me
Unlighted, unbound I'm set free from this world
Into the realms of darkest
Eternity
Where once brutal wars were waged
Lies the path to darkest eternity
