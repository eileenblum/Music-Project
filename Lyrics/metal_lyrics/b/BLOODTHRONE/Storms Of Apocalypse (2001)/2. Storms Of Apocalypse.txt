I smear my blood
Upon your sword
In the name
Of our Lord
Our Lord!

Thundering sound
Of steel crushing bone
Catastrophic struggling
For the Lord of our throne
Flying upon wings
Of the demon horde
Beheading victims with my sword
We ride on the backs
Of the Demon steed
I need to see my enemies bleed

Ride through the holocaust
To the storms of apocalypse
Flying upon wings
Of the demon horde
Beheading victims with my sword

Ride through the holocaust
To the storms of apocalypse
Ride through the Holocaust
To the storms of apocalypse
Thundering sound
Of steel crushing bone
Catastrophic struggling
For the Lord of our throne!
