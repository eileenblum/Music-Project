War, destruction, blasphemy
War, destruction, blasphemy!
Prepare for Armageddon
None shall survive
Die!
Thousands of screaming skulls
Praying for a miracle
Cross of life breaks down
Signs of death are all around
Armageddon has begun
Mushroom clouds block the sun
Final war initiate
Open the seventh gate
Out pour the wretched beasts
Upon humanity to feast!
Feast!

We are the war machine
We are machines for war
Hunting down our prey
Spill the blood the unholy way
We are the war machine
We are machines for war
Hunting down out prey
Spill the blood the unholy way
War, destruction, blasphemy
War, destruction, blasphemy

Chemical warfare? genocide
Satan's soldiers? are by my side
Satan will be? victorious
In the battles? of Armageddon

We are the war machine
We are machines for war
Hunting down our prey
Spill the blood the unholy way
War, destruction, blasphemy
War, destruction, blasphemy
The unholy speed war machine!
