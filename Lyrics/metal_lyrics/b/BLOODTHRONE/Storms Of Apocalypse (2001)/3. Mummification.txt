Mummified corpses lying in blood
Petrified souls rotting in hell
Natron bodies mummified unwillingly
Unholy tomb where countless
Victims were taken!

Mummification! Mummified!
Mummification! Still alive!
Natron bodies mummified unwillingly
Bloody tears pour into the Nile

Mummification! Mummified!
Mummification! Still alive!
Natron bodies mummified unwillingly
Bloody tears pour into the Nile

I am Osiris, Lord of the dead
Sent by Ra
For your punishment
Power you used for unholy deeds
Now the river Nile
With the blood of the gods bleeds
Your punishment
Will comprise an
Immortality of suffering
I Osiris, by my hand
I will mummify you with my power
You will never die
You will be mummified
You will never die
You will be mummified
You will never die

Pharaoh: "I don't want to die,
I don't want to be mummified
I haven't gone away, please
Don't let me go on living this way!"

I don't want to die
I don't want to be mummified
I haven't gone away, please
Don't let me go on living this way
