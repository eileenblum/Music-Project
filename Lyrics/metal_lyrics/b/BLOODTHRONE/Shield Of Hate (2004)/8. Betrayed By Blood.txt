[MUSIC:CAPTOR...LYRICS:NECROSADIST/CAPTOR]

In the realm of assassins
Betrayed by your own Blood
Allies turn to enemies
Now the knife turns on you
Rabid wolves 
Predators of treachery
Spread the plague
Nothing but whores

Destroyers reap and rejoice
Poisoners with forked tongues
Betrayers of all words of truth
I don't believe a word you say
Cum ye despisers of life
I shall return to you a favor
From my back I'll remove the knife
And you'll rue the day you did the deed
Dragging your cadaver through the trenches
I spit on your false existence
Cursing wretched humanity
Never shall I bow before you

Misanthropy runs like blood through my veins!

I despise your kind parasites on the human race
Scars and wounds have turned the soul so cold
Compassion is gone pity is a crucifixion
Litany of redemption anoints the rebirth in blood

In the realm of assassins
Betrayed by my own blood
Forsaken and left to bleed
Standing high atop your corpse
Immortal victory
Alone I am as one
Looking down on conquered lands
Driven by revenge
These battles I've won
Truth first casualty of war
Lies and false convictions
Agendas are revealed
Wrath hatred and disgust
Extinction of salvation
Waste of mortal life
March the path of redemption
Burn your fucking bridge

When the vultures pick your flesh
They dine on bastard filth
Worthless are your bones
Cut throats to the bloody end
In kingdoms of betrayal
Rejoicing in your misery
At your gallows they all flock
Wanting to see your demise
They all shall die the death of dogs
Deceitful kinsman make good corpses
Slit their fucking throats
Loyalty is but a word
