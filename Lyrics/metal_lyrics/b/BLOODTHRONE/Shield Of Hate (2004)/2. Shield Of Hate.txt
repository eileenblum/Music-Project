[MUSIC: CAPTOR/OBSCURE MANIFESTO...LYRICS: NECROSADIST]

Shield of Hate!

Behind the shield of hate
Revenge through suffering

Tyranny reigns like blood from the sky
Forgiveness is no option death is the only law
With no remorse death is dealt blindly
The gift of hate is bestowed on all

Behind the shield of hate
Triumphant banner of death
Crushing foreseen enemies
As they breathe their last breath
Apocalyptic raids
Bestial savagery
Hear the war cry
Brings the weak to their knees
Bringers of Destruction
Feel the flames of wrath
Bloodlust and perversion
Reduces all to ash
Prepare ourselves for war
With bullets and spikes
Harbingers of death
War! Destruction! Blasphemy!

Hate
Behind the shield of hate
Revenge through suffering
Behind the shield of hate
Destroy annihilate

Wrath and disgust tears at your flesh
Revenge by my hands beautiful is your death
Worthless is the life as it drains from your soul
Empty are your words like the blood from your corpse

Hate
Behind the shield of hate
Revenge through suffering
Behind the shield of hate
Destroy annihilate
