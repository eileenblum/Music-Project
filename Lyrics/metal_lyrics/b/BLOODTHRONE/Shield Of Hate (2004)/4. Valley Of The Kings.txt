[MUSIC: CAPTOR/POPE...LYRICS: POPE/CAPTOR]

My soul soars free, as far as the raven can see
My body lies dead beneath me, caught in the winds of the desert 
Storm 

Chaos and plague unleashed rested souls 
Spirits of the damned now awake
Arise at once from your desolate graves
Bring forth this unknown hell
Feel their presence etch upon your soul 
Hear the whispers in the desert's winds
Feel the breath of the ancient ones
The breath drawn by Rah!!!

Walk through the Valley of the Kings
Ghostly realms that defy surrender
Spirits emerge - take up your arms
Declare to us the things to come 

Far beyond which the eyes can see
Lies the kingdom that will never die
Endless flames burn the inner core 
The dead roam for all eternity

Walk through the Valley of the Kings
Spirits emerge take up your arms
