[MUSIC: CAPTOR...LYRICS: CAPTOR/POPE]

Ancient wars
From the beginning of time
Crusading soldiers march
Blinded by Christ
Slave to the whore
Travel to new worlds
Killing those who would
Never believe!

The holocaust to begin
Warships set ashore
Warlords to commence
The blood to be shed
Armies in Christ's command
Spreading the book of lies
Forever more!
Forever more!

Attack!!!!!!!

Flesh and steel collide
The last to survive
Fighting for my pagan blood
I kill for my pagan pride
Armies in Christ's command
Spreading the book of lies
Forever more!!!!!!
Forever more!!!

Ancient wars
From the beginning of time
Crusading soldiers march
Blinded by Christ
