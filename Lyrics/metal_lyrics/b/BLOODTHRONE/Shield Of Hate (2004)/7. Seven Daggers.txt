[MUSIC:CAPTOR...LYRICS:CAPTOR]

Spawned by Prophecy
Chronicles of Revelations
Evil Seed of Blasphemy
Baptized by Fire
From the Wells of the Unholy
Sent from Beyond the Gates of Darkness

Damien Thorne
Majestic Prince of Darkness
Son of Lord Satan
Deceiver of the World
Comes to End Humanity
Upon the Night of Trinity
Seven Daggers Fall
Seven Daggers Fall

Seven Daggers 
Forged from the Natural Earth
Blessed to Destroy Him
But can they Forever End
His Evil Lies Deep, In the Soul of Every Man
When the Number of the Beast Appears, Six Hundred and Sixty Six

Seven Daggers Fall
Seven Daggers Fall
Seven Daggers Fall
Seven Daggers Fall
