[MUSIC:CAPTOR/OBSCURE MANIFESTO/POPE...LYRICS: NECROSADIST/CAPTOR]

God's of Nuclear Death
Please claim this land as yours
The Storms cant come soon enough
Apocalypse is our reward
Famines and plague 
Rape the fucking earth
Answer all our prayers
Dreams of geonocide
A Thousand voices speak to me
In tongues of war and hate
Rid this world of human filth
Cleanse and Eradicate
Bring forth armies to destroy
The world is thrown away
Into a pit of fire.
Into a pit of hell.

Ruins of a world long dead

Bloodlust and war
The streets flow with blood
Warlords bleeding
Upon their thrones
Bloodlust and war
The streets flow with blood
Warlords bleeding
Upon their thrones

Come forth and destroy
Summon your armies from hell
Open the gates of hades
Rule darkness forever more

Legions of the Reaper's army
Desecrate and fight till death
Slaughtering the feeble mortals
Crushing their fucking skulls
War Hammer of the gods
Smashing the children's souls
Decapitate the corpse of Christ
Rape angels in their blood
