[MUSIC: POPE/CAPTOR/OBSCURE MANIFESTO...LYRICS: POPE/NECROSADIST]

Winds of darkness
Cloaked the land
The day they came
From Brimstone hell
As black storms rose
From dead sea's
The dawn brought forth
Soldiers of the bestial horde

A thunderous roar 
Conquered the night sky
Descending rains
Fell upon

Bleeding shores:.

Conquering the land!!!

Hear the pounding hooves
Of the demon steeds
Black shining armor
Red glaring eyes
There blades are drawn
With shields in hand
Breaking bones and shattering skulls
Churches and Homes
Engulfed in flames
A pyre burns
Corpses of the slain

Churches and Homes
Engulfed in flames
A pyre burns
Corpses of the slain
Woman raped in their own blood
Berzerker's unleashed upon the land!!!!!!!!!

Victory reigns
As warriors prevail
Conquered land
Has become their own
On this day
The soil drank much blood
