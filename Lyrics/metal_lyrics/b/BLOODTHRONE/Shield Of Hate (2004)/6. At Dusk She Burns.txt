[MUSIC: POPE...LYRICS: CAPTOR/NECROSADIST]

At dusk she burns with the end of the sun
Burn:witch Burn:
Enter the night under the full moonlight

Torches burn the witch hunt begins
Burn:bitch Burn:
Through the woods and into the fog

Open the gates to the cemetery
Burn:cunt Burn:
Etched is your name unholy grave

To burn is your fate
Death at the stake
Under twilight shadows
The judgment begins
Guilty as sin
Trial in flames

To burn is your fate
Death at the stake
Under twilight darkness
The judgment begins
Guilty as sin
Entranced by flames

At dusk she burns with the end of the sun
Burn:witch Burn:
Enter the night under the full moonlight

Torches burn the witch hunt begins
Burn:bitch Burn:
Through the woods and into the fog

Close the gates to the cemetery
Burn:cunt Burn:
Etched is your name unholy grave
