[PART  1 - ONE  MORE  TIME]

I've Played A Game With God
And I've Lost Again
One More Time... Yearning Of Death
One More Time... Noisy Bitches' Round Dance

And I Can't Close My Eyes
On The Impending Void
Brotherly Precipice
Today I'll play Again...

[PART  2 - TOWARDS  THE  LIGHT]

[PART  3 - SAILIN'  ON  THE  RAINBOW'S  WAVE]

Sunrise On The Sea, Infinite Open Sea
Confused In The Sky, Theatre Of My Introspection
Come To My Paradise - I'll Be There

The Moon Has Wiped Her Eyes
And She's Gone With A Smile
You Won't See Stars And Bars
Painted On The Heaven's Skies
And You'll Find The Piper's Dawn
Don't Forget The Key

I'm Sailin' On The Rainbow's Wave
Scattered In the Night
New Colours In My Brain
Dancing The Rhythm Of The Morning Sun
I'm Ploughing The Spiral Skies
On Fragments Of Madness
Listening To The Angel's Chant
With A Blue Desperation As A Friend
I'm Steppin' Over My Fate
Crossing The Limit Line Of Your Never Told Words

Tell Me, How Deep Is The Sea
At The End Of Your Night ?
Clear Light, Quiet Thought Slipping Far
And The Answer Could Be A Shipwreck
The Sailor Didn't Tell Me The Truth
About The Stairway To Heaven

We're Sailin' On The Rainbow's Wave
Scattered In the Night
New Colours In My Brain
Dancing The Rhythm Of The Morning Sun
We're Ploughing The Spiral Skies
On Fragments Of Madness

Tell Me, How Deep Is The Sea
At The End Of Your Night ?
Clear Light, Quiet Thought Slipping Far
And The Answer Could Be A Shipwreck
The Sailor Didn't Tell Me The Truth
About The Stairway To Heaven

[PART  4 - THE  FLYING  SHIP]

My Dear Captain, Don't Stop Your Trip
The Port Is Near, The Ship Has
...Weathered ...Every Rack

The Bells I Hear
The People All Exulting
The Bleeding Drops Of Red
From The Flying Ship
Rise Up And Hear The Bells
For You The Bugle Trills

My Dear Captain, Don't Stop Your Trip
The Port Is Near, The Ship Has
...Weathered ...Every Rack

The Bells I Hear
The People All Exulting
...Heart, Heart, Heart
In The Flying Ship
Rise Up And Hear The Bells
For You The Flag Is Flung

[PART  5 - LOST  IN  THE  OPEN  SKIES]

The Eagle Of Justice Has Flown Away
Left Children Of War
In Their Cold Nests Without Her Promises
Without Their Blind Faith
Lost In The Open Skies
Lost In The Open Skies

Even The Poets Can Be Blinded
By Their Lantern Of Truth
The Title Of The New Chapter
Is : "The Fall Of The Sun"

The Oniric Pirate Has Corrected His Shot
In The Academy Of Pain
And Now Is On Light Wings Of His Colour Wave
Under A Shining Star
Shining On The Far South
On The Far South

Even The Poets Can Be Blinded
By Their Lantern Of Truth
The Title Of The New Chapter
Is : "The Fall Of The Sun"

[PART  6 - THE  DIVINE  PARADE]

My Little Marionette
Left Your Playground And Your Father's Home
A Touching Farewell, Walking To The West
To The Prison Of Wonderland

And You, In Your Island
Pierrot For A Season In A Desert Universe
Blind Angel For A Life
For A Life Or Just For One Day
A Touching Farewell, Walking To The East
In The Pride Of Your Loneliness

My Distant Sad Clown
In The Circus Of The Mad Acrobat
With Your Grimace Under Your Droll Mask
With Your Screaming, Enchained Butterfly

My Funny Harlequin
Flight Of Clours In My Fading Days
A Fantasy's Breath, The Sleep Of A Drunk
In A Divine Comedy

Jester, My Old Friend
With Your Tales Of Life And Death
With Your Words From The Twilight
I' ve Read Your Diary
And Lost My Soul In The Other Side
...And Nothing Will Be The Same

Symphony Of daylight - Hear My Voice...
...Hear My Voice - My Voice In The Choir

[PART  7 - EPILOGUE  FOR  A  WHITE  ROSE]

Tomorrow I'll Play

Tomorrow I'll Play Again
