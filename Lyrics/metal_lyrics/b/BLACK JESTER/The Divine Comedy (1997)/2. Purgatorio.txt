[PART  1 - THE  ANGEL  AND  THE  FISHERMAN]

There's An Angel In The Corner With A Crown Of Thorns
There's A River In The Picture With A Fisherman

Clear Dawn On The River
Inside My Mind

Awakening : That's My Face
Another View : That's My Sin

[PART  2 - HARBOUR  OF  SINNERS]

The Guilt Is Buried In An Endless Sea...
...Painted On The Face Of An Angel
The Killer Of My Conscience Has Left Tonight
...Now I'm Loving Like An Angel

From A Misty Morning Of My Life
I Hear A Different Sound
The Song Of My First Pain

The Hurt Side Of The Moon Was
A Garden With No Sun

Now The Light Is Burning My Eyes
The Path Has Just Begun

I'm Trying
I'm Screaming
In A Rising Enchant

I'm Crying
I'm Bleeding
In A Earthly Enchant

Let's Play The Song Of My First Pain...
Open The Window Today
The Ascent Has Just Begun

From A Misty Morning Of My Life
I Hear A Different Sound
The Song Of My First Pain

Don't Sing The Evening's Hymn
When They're Shoting Your Sons

I Need To Understand
But The Path Has Just begun

I'm Trying
I'm Screaming
In A Rising Enchant

I'm Crying
I'm Bleeding
In A Earthly Enchant

A High Tower I Have To Climb , Everyday
Loneliness Is The Conquest Of My Times
Harbour Of Sinners

Now I Believe
That I Can Stare At The Void
...And My Freedom
The Colours Of This Dawn Are Confused
...With My Shadow

Now I Believe
That I Can Hear Your Prayers
...Of Salvation
A Morbid Choir As Delirious
...Symphony

Now I Believe
That I Can Smell The Incense
...Of Your Shelters
But The Air Of This Dawn Smells of
...A New Season

From Another View...

I See Your Mortal Face
In The Afterglow
Faded In The First Days
Of A Common Year
As A Wizard You Can Help Me
When I Turn The Page
Now It's Time For My Prayer
Written With My Tears

[PART  3 - THE  DETACHING  MARCH]

Sailin' Away - Sailin' Away
Sailin' Away - Sailin' Away

[PART  4 - TEARS  OF  DEW]

There was An Angel In The Corner With A Crown Of Thorns
The Fisherman Smiled Waving Goodbye To Me

It's A Long Way Of The River
Towards The Sea

Tears Of Dew
Are Slippin' On The Roofs,
On The Silent Gods,
Silence Everywhere

I'm The Helsman
I Am The Ship Boy
Who Is Gazing
At The Red Sky...

When The Morning Dies
