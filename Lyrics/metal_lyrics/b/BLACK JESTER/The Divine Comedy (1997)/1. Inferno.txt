[PART  1 - ENIGMA  OVERTURE]

[PART  2 - TOWARDS  THE  BLACK  THEATRE]

[PART  3 - BEHIND  THAT  GATE]

In The Middle Of The Day
A Fading Sun And My Lost Way
No More Heroes In My Mind
Native Spectres Without Land
Even Me Along The Edge

South Of God, South Of My Pain
The Abyss Of An Interrupted Melody
South Of God, Behind That Gate
Swarm Of Distant faces With No Eyes
... Distant Faces With No Eyes
Even Me Along The Edge
Hanging From The Next Life

In The Evening Of My Thoughts
A Beggar Holds Out His Hand
And The Clepsydra Bleeds So Fast
The Hope Is Just A Game
Exposure Of Stoned Souls

South Of God, South Of My Pain
The Abyss Of An Interrupted Melody
South Of God, Behind That Gate
Swarm Of Distant faces With No Eyes
... Distant Faces With No Eyes
Even Me Along The Edge
Hanging From The Next Life... Life... Life... Life

The Day Shall Die Again... Quiet Delirium
Sleepin' In The Opera Stalls
Icarus Shall Wait Again... For His Madness
Sleepin' In The Opera Stalls

[PART  4 - ON  THE  NEON  CRUCIFIXES'  ROAD]

On The Neon Crucifixes' Road
I've Lost The Key For The Piper's Dawn
Other Golden Words Are Sown
In The Deep Of The Miracles Field
You Will All Agree: " And Then You'll Never Suffer "
The Fire In Your Eyes... And My Eyes Just Half Closed
Come On, Tv On... And You'll Never Suffer
Come On, That's The World... And You'll Never Suffer

[PART  5 - THE  ABYSS]

All Is Abyss : Action And Desire
Dream And Word, Like Wind Through The Hairs
The Wind Of Fear In The Silence Everywhere
Horrible Space Is The Depth, As Attraction Of My Mind
I Can't Dock In The Deep Of My Nights
When God Draws A Nightmare With No Form
I Just Fear The Sleep As A Chasm
When All The Infinity Windows Are Open
With My New Perceptive View On My Eyes
My Dizzy Open - Wide Eyes

[PART  6 - ANOTHER  CHILDHOOD'S  STAKE]

The Chain - The Chain Is Broken
A Dive In My Dream
Red Lake Of... The Young Years
Like A Bloody Whirl... Dizzines Of Different Days
Without The Common Script... Without The Same Old Rhyme

The Mask - The Mask Has Fallen
The Mask Is Drifted Away
The Diviners Of... The 99th Floor
Have A Prophecy... In Their Hands
And A Psycho Sun... For The Next Game

Asleep - On The Wire
Another Sacrifice - Another Childhood's Stake

[PART  7 - FALLING  IN  THE  NIGHTWHIRL]

[PART  8 - ROOM  AFTER  ROOM]

On The Hot Rails To Hell, Only Memories
Of Useless Details And Stories Of Forgotten Tears
Like Frenetic Movie Scenes
Ashes Become Ashes, Room After Room
Too Much Night, Tonight - Leaned Out Of The Black Void

On The Hot Rails To Hell, I'll Find A Little Smile
Lost In A Teared Love, Lost In Little World
Like Frenetic Movie Scenes
Ashes Become Ashes, Room After Room
Too Much Night, Tonight - Leaned Out Of The Black Void

[PART  9 - REQUIEM  FOR  AN  ENDLESS  JIGSAW]

Hear My Prayer When I Pick Up The Pieces
Of An Endless Jigsaw
Under A Starless Sky - Under My Skin
The Mad Border Of The Past

Just A Requiem For The Missing Pieces
Of An Impossible Jigsaw
The Painter Has No Colours - The Writer Has No Words
For Tomorrow's Dawn

[PART  10 - THE  FINAL  STAGE]

Here I Am On The Final Stage
The Final Architecture Of The Snake

Everything's Tumbling Down
When Life And Death Snarl Again
In The Juda's Iced Land - It's Time To Change My Way

Behind The Screams - Of Reality
...You Can't Imagine
Behind The Dark - My New Frontier
...Between Blind Men And Fools

All Around Eyes With No Soul
Stoned Smiles And Iced Tears - In The Market Of The Spleen
I've Learned To Love My Solitude
God Bless All My Rage
Lucifer Is Faraway - It's Time To Change My Way

Behind The Screams - Of Reality
...You Can't Imagine
Behind The Dark - My New Frontier
...Between Blind Men And Fools
...Between Blind Men And Fools
...Between Blind Men And Fools
...Between Blind Men And Fools

Welcome To My Solitude  !
