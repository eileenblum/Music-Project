Show me your paths, ghosts of the past
Rose petals are slipping in the deep

Down the dark river of my thoughts,
I've forgotten the row of the feast

The night is cold, I see all my life
pining away in the shroud of every day

Yearning for love, yearning for death,
even the clowns are quit in their beds

Don't turn off the lights on the roundabout of life
Night shadows are dancing with my fears

Let's play again on the roundabout of life
The silence will scrape off my mask
...the roundabout of life... at nightfall

Show me my guilts, ghosts of the right,
Don't believe you can dull my sight

Scraps of faith at candle's light
Down the street a poor man is dying

Don't turn off the lights on the roundabout of life
Night shadows are dancing with my fears

Let's play again on the roundabout of life
The silence will scrape off my mask

[Chorus:]
Seven black horses will rush
through the ancient bonfires
Please let me understand,
where their run will end.

Tomorrow will come with yesterday's face
whispering words like old litanies

Yearning for death, yearning for love,
just a flame is trembling in my court

Don't turn off the lights on the roundabout of life
Night shadows are dancing with my fears

Let's play again on the roundabout of life
The silence will scrape off my mask

[Chorus]

...the roundabout of life... at nightfall
