Beyond the far gates
of my mind
you will find

so many fireflies
to flash your life
everynight

And you shall be
emotion's rider in the forest of dream,
...ride...and ride

Don't waste your time
in the tunnel conformism lies,
...lies...only lies

[Chorus:]
I'm flying over the seas
on a vessel full of tears
Everyone is a reason to live.
To live!
The water is gushing again
from the childhood's fountains, in your hearts
Follow the Jester's sound.
My sound!

Imagine and draw another playcard
and let it fall down in the grave,
the grey abyss of sadness,
the grey abyss of loneliness,
it could be a different fate,
it could be another fate.
You can try to leave your island
clutching at a passin kite;
seize the day behind a cloud and let...
...your soul rise free.

I'm the Joker
to win the game

I'm the minstrel
to break your chains

I am the madness
inside your brains
