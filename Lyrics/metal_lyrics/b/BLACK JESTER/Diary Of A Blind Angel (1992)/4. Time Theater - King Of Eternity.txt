The night the day
laughing and crying
no Edge, no Time
Just a mask's parade
floating on the waves, on and on
in the Court of the wind

I can see the world tonight
from this tower of eternity,
And my heart bleeds at seeing
war and death in our winds,
Sometimes I pray to be
in a new life of mystery
Why man, don't you want to see another day?
No freedom to feel,
Violence fills the soul of humanity,
Leave me alone with my tears.

I dream to fly on a rainbow faraway
with no swords in my hand,
the mind ever clashes with the wall of reality,
my sad throne in lands of sin,
Lost in evil fires,
Shadows of bad desires,
I can't see another way

[Chorus:]
No, nowhere to run,
Over the sun
only the dreams remain with me.

Hear me jester, play my song just for today
I haven't much time to live,
Let my crown fall in the fate of insanity,
Lord of the dark take me away.

[Chorus]
