Let me feel the silence
in the desert plain of time
the wind of pain is blowing in my mind.

Mother, tell me another
lullaby of life and death
the flowers will grow by your breath

Hearing again the sound of fate
while the moonlight is on my face
wars and kings in the voice of time
eternal moon, you can wipe my eyes.

[Chorus:]
Singin' the song of timewinds
the pain is an old season
the world is full of teardrops
like rain without reason
the future wheel is turning
to choose another prison,
mother give me strength
...the moon is high
...with my thoughts tonight.

You can feel my heartbeat
in the skies so faraway
the power of feelings is winning again
Mother Moon, don't leave me
in the darkness of the night
queen of the ages give me your light

Hearing again the sound of fate
while the moonlight is on my face
demons and angels in the voice of time
eternal moon, you can wipe my eyes

[Chorus]

The wise man is the guardian
of a temple of winners and losers
they're playing the game day by day
Watching out the window
The sunset of my dreams
consciousness is high on the hill

Hearing again the sound of fate
while the moonlight is on my face
lover and dreamers in the voice of time
eternal moon, you can wipe my eyes

[Chorus]
