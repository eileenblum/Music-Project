Silvern skull, sable shroud, ebon tower, onyx crown.
Witchfire, black citadel, frost-shrouded steel, moon-veiled spell.

The skyqueen of the dead rides forth, black storm-borne steeds,
(their flanks anointed by) immortal blood,
Hark to the striking of the winds, the moon burns black as slaughter reigns.
Witch-Storm!

Bright fires agleam through winter's night,
Dark spells whispered on the winds,
The trees enrob'd in veils of frost,
Moonfire entwines the Eye of Khthon.

From the moon-swathed depths of winter-mists,
Enchantress, she-who-walks-the-night-alone,
Sloe-eyed shape-shifting sucubus,
Silken veils and slime-smeared flesh.
Witch-storm!

Storm-Witch, hearken this night,
Hone this black blade with sorcery,
Battle-spells annoint my flesh,
Let blood and steel be my glory.

Elder tongues encarved in sinistrous slime-flecked stone,
The Obsidian Tower broods 'neath the moon,
Winged fiends descend from storm-wrought skies,
Black Ring, key to the Shadow Gate, aglow with eldritch spells.

Forged in witchfire, envenomed steel,
Ensorcelled blade, blood-ravening,
Ebon demon's tooth, the bane of Kings,
Red rain of slaughter, prow of blood.
WITCH-STORM!
