Black Legions ravening for blood,
Dark Lords hearken to my call,
Warriors rise forth from the earth,
Battle-spells empower me,
The Throne of Kings, the summoning,
Marble halls sunk 'neath the waves,
Storm-wolves a prowl (beneath) the ebon moon,
Immortal hordes, pledge me thine steel!

The clarion call of battle sounds,
Iron gleams in baleful flame,
Slaughter shines from misted eyes,
Storm-forged blade drink deep.
Stench of carnage fires my blood,
My bride of steel sings in my hand,
Corpse-mounds piled to touch the sky,
Black fury enshroud me!

Bleed for the gods of war!
Flesh to sate the worms!
By this sword I rule!

Dreadful fall of slaughter,
Raw scent of fresh-spilled blood,
Crimson rain falls from the sky,
Ravens ride the storm.

Black cloud of arrows, red storm of swords,
Dark wave of carnage... slaughterfall!

By blood and steel I rule!
