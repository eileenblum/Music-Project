[The Watcher in Stone:]
...And I stand enthralled and silent atop the ancient, shadowed mountain,
gazing in awe at the stygian, night-cloaked sky, as above me a wondrous flight
of ebon dragons soar on vast wings blacker than the darkling heavens... Mayhap
I  behold  the  personal  war-dragons  of  none  other than the mysterious and
legendary  Ophidian  King  himself, majestically riding the night winds to the
glorious field of some great and epic battle... By the gods, a more fearsomely
splendid sight in this world there cannot be!
