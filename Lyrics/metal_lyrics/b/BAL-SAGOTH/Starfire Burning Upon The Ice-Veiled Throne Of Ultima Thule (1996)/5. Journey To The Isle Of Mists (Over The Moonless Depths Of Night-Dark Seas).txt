[The Log of the Northern Mariner:]
The  great  serpent-prow  of  my  ship,  Wave-Render, cleaves the nighted
waters  as  we voyage across this dark, icy sea, towards the unknown... Above,
the  bright winter's moon emerges a veil of cloud to cast its lucent rays upon
us,  and a clinging, supine sea- mist writhes upon the midnight waves, swirled
by the cool, whispering wind which catches our great sail, pushing us onwards,
ever onwards... And beyond the tang of the darkling sea, the scent of night is
as  strong  and  heady  as a summer blossom. I know no t what awaits us at the
elder Isle of Mists... that grim and mystery-haunted place which beckons me to
its  shadowed  embrace, swathed in dark legendry and entwined in the mantle of
ancient  sorceries...  and  yet  I must hearken to its ethereal call... for ma
yhap the gods decreed this to be my final voyage...
