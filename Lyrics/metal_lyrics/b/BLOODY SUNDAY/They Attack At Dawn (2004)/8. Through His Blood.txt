when I was young
I questioned my faith
at a time when I was searching
and now I look back
when I'm down
whenever I hurt
think of Christ and I think of the Cross
just when I thought the walls were closing in
in came the trap
think and react
never again will I turn my back
never again will I question my faith
hold on tight and close my eyes and pray will every beat of my heart
never think twice
hold up my cross
never again will I deny my faith
I break down
I am alone
stick right by
every word of the Book
when I forgive what they've done
won't have no more questions to ask
with Him close to my heart
live my life
with no regrets
just when I thought the walls were closing in
in came the trap
think and react
never again will I turn my back
never again will I deny my faith
