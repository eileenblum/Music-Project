These
these final days
in agony
spent holding your word so tightly
all the while
and you
falsify His name
degrading the dream
and it all becomes a testament to thee
with no return it all means nothing
therefore your judgement
seems shadowed
to me
with the love
He has shown
we wield the tools
and by His grace and through the same the service
is just and true
and still the threat is so real
removed from His view
compels me
makes me praise His name in everything I do
we do as of your will now
now is the stand
His sacrifice
showed more compassion than any other man
Pray hard
these final days
spent in your arms
and we won't be left here
to suffer
in sin
without His love
you can't begin life
we shall overcome
stand strong
His work is not yet done
the stand
