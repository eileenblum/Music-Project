choking the past
and all of the greed
subjecting myself
to all the wrong things
staying out late
with all of the team
committing the crimes that you would not dream
depraving myself
of what was in sight
and running around
like the world is mine
these idle hands
that I must destroy
never again
I won't be his ploy
and though the world has
all of these vices
it just isn't replacing my trust
everybody has their own convictions
I am annoyed at the way that you judge
He was there when you were devoted
He was there when you almost fell off
and even when we knew we made the wrong choices
He was there with a forgiving heart
and perfect love
