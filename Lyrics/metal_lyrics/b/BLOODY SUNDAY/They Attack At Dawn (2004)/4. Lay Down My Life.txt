tell you once
and I'll tell you again
lay my life down for my family
my friends means that much to me
when the war is on we're all one
and this war can't change my plans
and you'll never affect my family and friends lay down my life
if you had ever had a little heart
because then you would understand
I will not wait for the fall
of the truth and brotherhood of God
I hold this kinship close to my heart
it will be there until this war is fought
take time to see you through
take time to show you what it's all about
find out what life's about
brothers until the end
my friends they are my life
for whom I'd sacrifice
in the end I won't think twice
lay down my
my friend my family my blood
for whom I could and would
don't have to ask me twice
give all I can
my friends
my blood
my life
my friends they are my life
for whom I'd sacrifice
the end I won't think twice
to lay down my life lay down my life
