I'm taking a look
back at the mess
the stains
the smell
but now is the test
rebuild the trust
of my friends that are left
think I'll be back
I wouldn't hold your breath
for everything
you've done
I stand stronger
as the man that I've become
and I won't pretend
were blood
hard earned lessons
when you hurt
hurt the ones you love
my hands are tied for once
only through Him
forgiveness for all of the wrong that you've done
it would've hurt a lot worse
when you ripped my heart from my chest
if I wasn't already dead from the knife in my back
friend was the name
that you lost when your face changed
all this was insecurity
your part defiling me
friendships were born
friendships will die
but in between
were the lies
so close to you
so far from new
we've all seen you
can't believe we're through
find a sucker you can leech on to
