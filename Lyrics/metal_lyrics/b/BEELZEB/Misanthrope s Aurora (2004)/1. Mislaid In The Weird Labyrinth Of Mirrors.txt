Have you perceived how the snow disintegrates
And the white colour fades out?
And how the leaves are shaken
By the autumn's wind to die?

Distance haunts us and breaks up the nearness
Bond that joins past and future is disconnected
Obligating to forget what we were, what we are
Which is mislaid in the weird labyrinth of mirrors

Have you ever felt when the death herself
Penetrates deep inside you?
How her black blaze shines
And spreads and overwhelms you?

Distance haunts us and breaks up the nearness
Bond that joins past and future is disconnected
Obligating to forget what we were, what we are
Which is mislaid in the weird labyrinth of mirrors

Noise underneath her blackened feet
Ambiguety lying taken by her hand

Prisoners within a routine's jail cell
Have you tasted the chill kiss from her lips?
And how your veins are like glaciers
That lead straight to a frozen heart?

Wounds don't form scars
Tears don't stop running

Prisoners within a routine's jail cell
Have you tasted the chill kiss from her lips?
And how your veins are like glaciers
That lead straight to a frozen heart?

My eyes hardly believe in the tiny slight signs of
Happiness before them... ephemeral content

Pain and suffering everytime

Temporary relief - such as small drops of dew slipping away
Under a sun which inspires new false daily expectations... -

Among the hollow spaces, lines that can approach one
Another are mislaid in the weird labyrinth of mirrors

No name for this disease
No cure for what's got no name

I am just awaiting
For another moment of perverted clarity
... To write to myself again...
Mislaid in the weird labyrinth of mirrors

Distance haunts us and breaks up the nearness
Bond that joins past and future is disconnected
Obligating to forget what we were, what we are
Which is mislaid in the weird labyrinth of mirrors

Mislaid...
Pain and suffering everywhere
Mislaid...
