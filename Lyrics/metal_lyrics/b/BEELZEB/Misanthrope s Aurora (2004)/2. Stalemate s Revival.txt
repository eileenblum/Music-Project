Can the bars of our memory immure persistence?
... So they claim: "Disaster". Nothing more
Seems to be before our sight.

For each vague, shy step beyond,
Thousand voices of our anguish lead us astray
We stop to reflect without realizing
We have returned to the starting point

Final sentences appear like a joker dilemma
As a reality of justifications committed to memory
Masks the false self-supply

Will dance of the past played before us
Take it's mourning course?
Indifference drips from a romance caught by surprise
... Letting life escape

So now - in our shelter, which has compelled us
With no free ignorance  -
What can we have recourse to
But references from our deconstructed past?
- Same mistakes once more

Into pale corners of the self
Inverse existence
Beyond life and death
Though standing here yet

Same mistakes once more
Damage more than ever

Loneliness that exists into each of us
May close our eyes definitely
Then the wait for solutions
Will become the paradigm of insanity

All among the overknown absurd monotony...
Coarse nothingness soaks me up
Same mistakes once more
Damage more than ever

Perhaps we'll try to distill from the entangled plot
Of livings, memories, thoughts...
The core of our own sickness

All among the overknown absurd monotony...
Coarse nothingness soaks me up
Same mistakes once more
Damage more than ever
