The heart of flesh has taken root inside
The light of life has been injected
Like circuitry across the expanse of space and time
Another darkened soul has been connected
Soli Deo Gloria
You can't save yourself
Enemies are rising up against the light
Yet it will go on shining even in the darkest night
Lifted up from the ocean's tomb
His body modified, surgically improved
Given a heart that never stops beating
Given lungs for underwater breathing
To return to the ocean floor
To walk among the dead below
Despite the flesh, light will outpour
And in darkness hope will grow
The ocean echoes back the music of eternity
The blackest sky gives way to perfect beauty
Requiem Aeternam
Soli Deo Gloria
