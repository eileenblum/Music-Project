The final chapter has already been writtenThe story has been toldIn another dimension, beyond the reach of timeThere is no more, no more to beholdSee the artificial light nowIt is flickering, fading awayEternity is right nowIt is fusing with todayBreathing lightWe anticipateBreathing lightOr suffocateSee the darkness that conceals youEvaporating, exposing the soulAnd as the light reveals youLet it in, let it take controlAs death corruptsBeauty is revealedAs the whole world falls apartBroken souls are healedWe are breathing lightIt sets our hearts glowWe are breathing lightEternal is the overflow
