All the lights are burning bright
All our bodies taking flight
The shadows cast are evidence
There is a deeper world than this
Hearts like candles light the way
Turning darkness into day
Let us all this light absorb
Until at last we are no more
Yet I am just a prism
Ceaselessly refracting
All of the light you are exacting
Flesh is dissolving in the light
Soaking the soul in radiation
The pathogens take hold at once
And begin transformation
Father of lights
Shine upon us here
Take the darkness from our hearts
Make it disappear
Reflect, refract
Break me
Remake me
A mirror that reflects your glory
Break me
Remake me
A mirror that reflects you perfectly
