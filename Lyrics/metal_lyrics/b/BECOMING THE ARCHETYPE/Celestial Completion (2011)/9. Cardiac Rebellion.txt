From somewhere in the darkest depths
Within the cloth of secrets kept
Out of silence death maintained
Resounds a voice that shakes the frame
Listen now unto the call
Like nothing heard before
Living hearts begin to crawl
Bursting forth through stubborn flesh
The invisible nature is taking over
Taking over from within
The invisible creature is breaking though
Breaking through the skin
Hey!
Clear the way!
It's a revolution!
Cardiac rebellion!
And now we see them marching
Dragging bodies in their wake
To the call there is no stopping
It is forever that's at stake
It's a cardiac rebellion
So join the revolution
