Engage
Turn out the light
Internal illumination
And see, the earth is bright
With internal illumination
The ones who came before
Were only looking for decay
Forsaking and mistaking
What was hidden in their day
But now the veil is broken,
The light is clearly seen
The lines begin to blur
And reveal what's always been
Its rising, it's growing
And all our hearts are glowing
Its raining, it's flooding
And we can feel it in our bones
Don't believe your eyes
The light is growing brighter
Don't accept the obvious
Time is a face upon the water
Shadow veils perception
Breeds deception and false doubt
In the soil of assumption
Seeds of hopelessness are found
No more painting shadows
On the canvas of life
No more drinking water
Out of wells that are dry
