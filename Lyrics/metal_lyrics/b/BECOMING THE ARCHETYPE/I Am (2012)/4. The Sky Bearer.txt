I carried the sky on my back
I Caught it the day that it FELL
All of the world had turned black
And stared into the mouth of hell

It crushed all the mountains and the tops of the trees
For a moment it even brought me to my knees
On my shoulders I lifted impossible weight
Up the mountains I bore unbearable freight
It crushed all the mountains and the tops of the trees
For a moment it even brought Me to MY KNEES
On my shoulders I lifted impossible WEIGHT
Up the mountains I bore unbearable freight

It was in silence that I arose
And in silence infinity closed
There are no words wasted
When death is tasted

IT WAS IN SILENCE THAT I AROSE
And in silence infinity closed
THERE ARE NO WORDS WASTED
When death is tasted

It was in silence that I arose
And in silence infinity closed
There are no words wasted
When death, when death is tasted

I Carried the sky on my BACK
All of the world had turned black
And stared into the mouth of hell
It crushed all the mountains and the tops of the trees
For a moment it even brought me to MY KNEES
On my shoulders I lifted impossible WEIGHT
Up the mountains I bore unbearable freight
I bore unbearable freight
Up the mountains I bore unbearable freight
