This is the day you die!

Murder, murder and hatred
Infliction, infliction of pain
And creation, creation of sorrow
Murder and hatred
Total annihilation

Destruction OF SOULS that Iâve redeemed

Obliteration OF LIVES that Iâve created

The scars of your lives
The sounds of your cries
Destruction, obliteration
The scars of your lives
The sounds of your cries
Destruction OF THE SOULS that Iâve REDEEMED

All these shall see their...
All these shall see their END
All these shall see their...
All these shall see their END

I will destroy your destructive desires
And nothing shall remain EXCEPT
The life you live in Me

All these shall see their...
All these shall see their END
All these shall see their...
All these shall see their end
All these shall see their...
All these shall see their end
All these shall see their...
All these shall see their end...
