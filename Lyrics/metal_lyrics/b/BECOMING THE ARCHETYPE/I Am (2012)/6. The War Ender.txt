I spoke to the heart of darkness
Let there BE LIGHT
Let there (let there), let there be light
I spoke to the heart of darkness
Let there (let there), let there be light
I reached into the dead manâs chest
And brought him back to LIFE
Let there (let there), let there be light

I AM THE SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM
Reanimation is in my hand
I am he that buries men alive
I am he that buries men alive

I am the shock (I am the shock)
To the system
REANIMATION is in my hands
I hold the keys (I hold the keys)
Of LIFE and DEATH

And nothing can stand against my plans
Nothing can stand against my plans

I am he that buries men alive
I am he that buries men alive
Buries men alive

Drowns them (drowns them)
And draws them out to thrive
I make the blood flow THROUGH YOUR VEINS
I am the author (I am the author)
Of your final chapter

The BRINGER OF LIFE and BRINGER OF PAIN

For a time there is war
So that war can yield peace
BUT I am Lord
Despite the pain and disease
The trials and battles of life
The endless burden of strife
The final breath of these monsters
I will bring to PASS

The final breath of these monsters
I will bring to PASS

I lay in the ruins of the WAR MACHINE
I CONQUER the CONQUERING
WAR-ENDING angels I will deploy
The DESTROYER I will DESTROY
