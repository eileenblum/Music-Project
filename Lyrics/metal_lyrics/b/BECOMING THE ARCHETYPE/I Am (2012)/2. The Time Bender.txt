(Time bender)
Traversing the infinite
Transcending the evident
Watch as reality bends to my will

Navigating eternity
Dispatching uncertainty
Navigating eternity
Behold in my presence, time standing still

I am the future
I am the past
I have seen you breathe (breathe) your (your) last

Navigating eternity
Dispatching uncertainty
Navigating eternity
Behold in my presence, time standing still

I am the end, I am the start
I am holding your beating heart

Day is night
Dark is light
Eternally self-existent

Traversing the infinite
Transcending the evident
Watch as reality bends to my will

I am the future
I am the past
I have seen you breathe your last
