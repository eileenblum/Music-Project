I cause chaos
AND CONFUSION
I put the sky in turmoil

I see the world as the SUN DOES
I wreak havoc in a WHIRLWIND
The WIND is at My FINGERTIPS
And my voice is the lightning and the thunder

Destruction is my work
To obliterate your petty structures
Destruction is my work
To obliterate your petty structures

To make your weak hearts quiver
To make you tremble
To create in you a sense of fear
To open your eyes to your desperation

Destruction is my work
To obliterate your petty structures
Destruction is my work
To obliterate your petty structures

Oh how I long for you to say,
âConsume my beating heart from within"
From within
From the inside
Tear me apart

Consume my beating heart
From within tear me apart
Consume my beating heart
From within
TEAR ME APART
