With resolve I walked an UNTRAVELED PATH
In anguish endured, unspeakable wrath
I am the one who swallowed the sun
Who boldly declared the impossible done
Who boldly declared the impossible done

Perfection in mortal disguise
SEE IT BURNING WITHIN MY EYES

I am the light
I alone make the darkness bright

Darkness prevailed for an HOUR
Until I had CONSUMED its power
Perfection in mortal disguise
See it burning within my eyes

I am the light
I alone make the darkness
I am the sun
For I am the omnipotent one

I ALONE AM THE LIGHT
I ALONE AM THE LIGHT

I alone am the light
I alone make the darkness bright
I alone am the sun
For I am the omnipotent one
