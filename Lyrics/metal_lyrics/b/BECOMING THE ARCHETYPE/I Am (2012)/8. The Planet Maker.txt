I create beauty out of nothing
Majesty spins from my hands
Worlds take form, creation is torn
To make a new beginning

New life is my occupation
New creatures of My own creation
I make the things THAT need MAKING
I wake the worlds THAT need WAKING

Creation is in my hands
To You my life I give
I make a perfect plan
To breathe the life INTO YOUR SKIN
Creation is in my hands
To You my life I give
I make a perfect plan
To breathe life
To breath life into your skin

CREATION IS IN MY HANDS
TO YOU MY LIFE I GIVE
I MAKE A PERFECT PLAN
TO BREATH LIFE
INTO YOUR SKIN

I am the maker of the worlds
I am creator of the planets
I AM THE MAKER OF THE WORLDS
And I am the creator of the planets

Creation is in my hands
To breathe life into your skin
