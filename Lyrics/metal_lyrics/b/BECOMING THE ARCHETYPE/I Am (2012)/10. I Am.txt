I am that I am

In ages past I spoke to man like man would speak to me
I rode upon the four high winds and crushed adversity
In ages past I spoke to man, he spoke to me
And crushed adversity
My power was shown in works of might
That my children might believe the blinding weight of glory
No human eye could see

I am that I am

I move among your HEARTS
I swim inside your VEINS
I stay behind the scenes and speak to hearts who would obey
My life infused with many sons, my truth inside your soul
My body is comprised of the nations
Who will make my Kingdom whole

I am that I am
I and my Father are one
I am that I am
I am that I am

I move among your hearts, I swim inside your veins
I stay behind the scenes and speak to hearts who would obey
My life infused with many songs, my truth inside your soul
My body is comprised of the nations, who will make my kingdom whole
Now I among your hearts and swim inside your veins
I stay behind the scenes and speak to hearts who would obey

I am that I am
I and my Father are one
I am that I am
I am that I am

I am that I am
I and my Father are one
I am that I am
I and my Father are one

I am, I am that I am
