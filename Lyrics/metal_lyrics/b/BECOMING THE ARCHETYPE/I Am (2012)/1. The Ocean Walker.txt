I walked, I walked across the ocean
To the island of the dead
I climbed, I climbed the mighty tidal-wave
All other men have dread

I alone am standing
Standing in a world of silence

The TSUNAMI and the HURRICANE
BOW DOWN

I alone am standing
Standing in a world of silence

The TSUNAMI and the HURRICANE
Bow down, bow down at my command
All the oceans, all the oceans filled with death
I have consumed in a single breath

I am the fountainhead
I am the fountainhead
I am the fountainhead
I'm bringing back the dead
I am the fountainhead
I am the fountainhead
I am the fountainhead
And I am bringing back the dead
