There is a pattern of deception growing
Feeding off of our ignorance
IT WONT LET GO! Until we let go
IT WANTS CONTROL! Just take a leap of faith
So many times we doom ourselves
But the root is always the same
We exchange our faith for rational thought
We trade our conscience for advanced reasoning
But there's no love in thought
Nothing that lasts in deduction
There's no hope in justifying wrong
Just death in rationalism
I am not of this world
And science cannot explain me
I will transcend death
This body will not contain me
This evil unseen must be defeated
This pattern must be destroyed
It hijacks the mind
It distorts our perception
Perverting the truth 'til it's gone
IT WONT LET GO! Until we let go
IT WANTS CONTROL! Just take a leap of faith
Compromising faith will doom the generations
The cancer of mind-worship leaves the spirit to decay
Compromise your faith and doom your generation
The cancer of mind-worship will leave your spirit to decay
