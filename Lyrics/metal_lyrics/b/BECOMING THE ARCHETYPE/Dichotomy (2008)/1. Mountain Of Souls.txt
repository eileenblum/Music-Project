I am a ghost
A phantom in a solid world
Standing at the foothills of forever
With no strength to carry on
Every step I take
Shines light on my defective state
But I won't ever fade away
Eternity is black and white
And I've been living in between
(Another shade of gray)
Put your arms around me
Lift me up so I can see
The mountain of souls
The river of blood
Bury me in the river
That flows with blood forever
Carry me up to the mountain
Where the sacrifice was made
Where through a pool of light
We experience (new) spaces
