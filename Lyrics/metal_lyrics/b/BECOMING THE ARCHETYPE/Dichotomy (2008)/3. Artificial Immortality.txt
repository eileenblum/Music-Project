Technology will conquer, Biology will fall
Machines provide the means for the chosen few
To rise up and be "immortal"
Discard the body to elevate the intellect
Remove the head, remove the soul, implant the artificial
Remove the head, remove the soul, dehumanize...NO!
Shake off the chains
The constraints of your mortality
This new evolution puts "perfection" within our grasp
Discard the body to elevate the intellect
Remove the head, remove the soul, implant the artificial
Remove the head, remove the soul, dehumanize...NO!
I am not a mechanism
I am part of the resistance
I am an organism
An animal, a creature, I AM A BEAST!
