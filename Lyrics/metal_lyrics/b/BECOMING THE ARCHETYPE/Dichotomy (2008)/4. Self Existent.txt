Into the darkened tomb
I walked but only found it empty
My mind is tormented
My soul is shaken
As a flame is tormented by the wind and rain
As the earth is shaken by an earthquake
My heart has accepted
What my eyes could never have believed
I watched Him die
I watched Him die
In the silence death is defeated
In my spirit the battle rages on
And then I stepped into the light
I heard His voice, I saw His face
And then He stood there before me
A man buried but never dead
My heart has accepted
What my eyes could never have believed
I saw Him rise
I saw Him rise
HE IS ALIVE! and reigns forever
HE IS ALIVE! He'll reign forever
