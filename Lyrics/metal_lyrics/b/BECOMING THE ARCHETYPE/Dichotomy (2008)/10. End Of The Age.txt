The earth is shaking
Because of His wrath
The mountains tremble
At the sound of His voice
He pulls down the sky
To crush His enemies
He descends upon them with fire
He is clothed in greatness
His voice resounds throughout the earth
His vengeance no longer is contained
His light destroys the darkness
If He speaks the earth will crumble
If He moves the universe will fall
He is clothed in greatness
His voice resounds throughout the earth
With the valleys of the seas exposed
And the surface of the earth laid bare
He reached down into the void
HE REACHED DOWN AND TOOK HOLD OF ME!
HALLELUJAH! HALLELUJAH!
