Awakened from the shadows
Leaving behind that cold and silent planet
Moving through infinity
Into the embrace of heaven
Eternity has overtaken me
Eternity is inside of me
My eyes have been illuminated
To reality; the fallen state of earth
Revelation penetrates the silence
Cuts to the center of my spirit
Destroys my previous conception of existence
Until this moment all that I have known
Is death's attempt at imitating life
(And for the first time I am truly alive)
Eternity has overtaken me
Eternity is inside of me
