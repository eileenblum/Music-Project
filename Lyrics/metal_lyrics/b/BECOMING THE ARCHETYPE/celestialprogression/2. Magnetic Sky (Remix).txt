Here at the end of the world
Planets fall and we are rising
Soul and sky are magnetizing
Here at the end of the world
We are witnessing together
The inception of forever
Time begins to bend
And then it breaks
When it's all gone
We'll be movin' on, movin' on
Rising
Magnetizing
Lift the earth and like a wave
Carry us to shore
What a perfect
What a beautiful emptiness
And we will live forevermore
Crush the mountain in your hand
Drink the ocean dry
What a perfect
What a beautiful emptiness
To know that we will never die
A world within a world
A life that blooms in death
The blade that severs cleanly
Takes away the need for breath
A hand within a hand
A window in the eye The heart becomes irrelevant
When the blood is on the outside
We have come alive
In this magnetic sky
We have come alive And death shall be no more
This is what we were created for
