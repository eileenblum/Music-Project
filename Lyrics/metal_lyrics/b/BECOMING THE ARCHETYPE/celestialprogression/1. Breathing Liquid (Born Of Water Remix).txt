The final chapter has already been written
The story has been told
In another dimension, beyond the reach of time
There is no more, no more to behold
See the artificial light now
It is flickering, fading away
Eternity is right now
It is fusing with today
Breathing light
We anticipate
Breathing light
Or suffocate
See the darkness that conceals you
Evaporating, exposing the soul
And as the light reveals you
Let it in, let it take control
As death corrupts
Beauty is revealed
As the whole world falls apart
Broken souls are healed
We are breathing light
It sets our hearts glow
We are breathing light
Eternal is the overflow
