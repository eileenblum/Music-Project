These are the times that try men's souls.
In this, the age of obscurity.
The world awaits its own demise and all creation cries out.
Unleash your devastation.
Like a pestilence throughout the land.
Bring utter desolation.
Let your judgment fall.
Pour out your power.
Pour out your wrath.
Assail the gates of sin and death, and scatter the council of the wicked.
To devour evil where it dwells.
End persecution.
End torment.
End despair.
Reclaim your creation.
