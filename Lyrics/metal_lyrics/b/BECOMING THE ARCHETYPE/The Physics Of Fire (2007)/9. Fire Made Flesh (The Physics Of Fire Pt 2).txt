And so was the plight of man for generations.
Their souls remained frozen.
Enslaved in darkness.
Until the day that fire fell from Heaven.
Those who witnessed the blaze took up torches and carried them into all the earth.
Bearing witness that fire would be the key to undoing the enemy's grasp on their souls.
Yet there were those who refused to believe, since they had not seen the source of the blaze with their own eyes.
Still, many others left all they had behind.
They took up torches and carried the flame.
I will carry the flame to the end of the earth with me.
This fire that burns forever is the only thing that sets me free.
They marched deep into the depths of the earth to reclaim their souls from the enemy.
