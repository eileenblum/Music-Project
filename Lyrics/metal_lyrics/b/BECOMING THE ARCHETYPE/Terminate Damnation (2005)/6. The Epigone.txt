YEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!!!

GO!

There's nothing! 
That I can say!
That hasn't!
Already been said!

I'm just repeating myself repeating someone else!
Equally incapable of uttering a single new thought!
Yet you are ever worthy of adoration!
So how can I for a moment cease to lift my heart in praise?
Your name is glory
My song is victory
And I will keep on singing

Your Name is Glory
My song is victory

OOOHHH!

There is no opposition!
There is no opposition!
THERE I NO OPPOSITION!
No thing can stand... 
IN YOUR WAY!!!

Make my life Your own
Make my life your own

OOOOOAAAAAHHH!
