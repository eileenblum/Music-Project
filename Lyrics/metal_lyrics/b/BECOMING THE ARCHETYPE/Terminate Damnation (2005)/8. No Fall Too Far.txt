My heart has never been enough!
Breathing just barely gets me by!
For a time!
FOR A TIME!

The consequences of being human...
Won't be undone by human hands!

YEAH!

I turn my head (Turn my head!) and see it all falling apart!
But You're still here, (You're still here!) un-phased by me!

I'm holding on!
I'm holding on to You!
I'm holding on!

I move my eyes (Move my eyes!) from fixation on a fallen world!
I'm holding onto you, (Onto You!) un-phased by me!
OOOHHH!

These walls fall down around me...
But I will stand!
I Will Stand!

And though my body be burned away I will live...

LIIIIFFFEEEE!!!

I'm holding on!
I'm holding on to You!
I'm holding on!
