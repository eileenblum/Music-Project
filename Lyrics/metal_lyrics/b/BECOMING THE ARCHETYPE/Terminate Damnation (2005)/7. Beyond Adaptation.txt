NOOOOO!
OH!

OOOAAHH!
I bear these scars!
A constant reminder!
of my own INADEQUACY!

I've held everything and nothing!
All at once!
And all at once been broken
ALTOGETHER BROKEN!

YEEAAHHOOO!

But even scars fade with time!
(Only You remain)
And my determination is not enough!
(Only You remain)

Even so... 
I BEAR THESE SCARES 

YEAH!

GO!

I bear these scars!
A constant reminder!
of my own INADEQUACY!

I've held everything and nothing!
All at once!
And all at once been altogether broken!
