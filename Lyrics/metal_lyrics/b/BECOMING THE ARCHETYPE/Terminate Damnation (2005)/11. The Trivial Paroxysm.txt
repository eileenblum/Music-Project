So it begins!
And I am!
Surrounded by!
My enemies!

Darkness seems like!
My closest friend!
Suffering and waiting!
Suffering and waiting!
Suffering and waiting for You!
Each breath feels like my last!

But that won't stop me!
I've seen the way it ends
I won't give up!
Carry on 'til then!
Carry on 'til then!

YEEAAHH!

And though I'm incapable.
Of sustaining myself.
Even for a moment.

I will outlive time!
I will outlive time!

CARRY ON!
CARRY ON!
CARRY ON!
CARRY ON!
YEOW!

But that won't stop me!
I've seen the way it ends
I won't give up!
Carry on 'til then!
