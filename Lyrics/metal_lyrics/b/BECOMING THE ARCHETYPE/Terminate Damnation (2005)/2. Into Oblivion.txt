OOOHHH!

It hurts to see you live your life revolving around death!
And to see your heart when I can't see your face!

SO FAR!
AWAY!

One foot in front of the other, step to the right!
One foot in front of the other, step to the right!
YEAH!

Time has it's way and I'll be right here waiting for you!
Time has it's way and I'll be right here waiting for you!

LET'S GO!

YEAH!

YEUUUUUUUAAAHHHH.

Waiting for you!
