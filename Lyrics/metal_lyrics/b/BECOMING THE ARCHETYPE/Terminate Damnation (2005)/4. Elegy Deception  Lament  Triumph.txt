[feat. Ryan Clark from Demon Hunter]YEAAAHHH!

Death reigns over Earth
Oppressing justice and truth
Nations plagued by despair
Collapsing hopelessly into themselves

YEEEAAAHHHH!
ROW!

We watch while sanity dies
Forever lost upon the Earth
Countless souls embracing condemnation
One by one marching to the GRAVE!

YEEEAAAAHHHH

One by one marching to the grave!

Into the Mouth of the ruin!
That feeds upon the Damned and the Deceived!
(Deceived!)

OOOHHH!

And they will cry;
There is no life here only death!
(Only Death)
Only Death!

RAH!

Deceived!
Deceived!
HHOOOOOO!

DECEIVED!

Wide is the path that leads to destruction OH!
OOOHHH!

Wide is the path that leads to destruction!
Wide is that pathway down into the pit of despair!
