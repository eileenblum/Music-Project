Increase the psychic density
In order to reach a glorious state of supremacy
Through the ascend of collective life
You search for clarity, can no find
The next mutation of human race it will create
Lowtide seasons upon the earth
A feeling overwhelming in distress
We rather prefer the truth of our tragedy
Extreme behaviour of the spirit
Uncommon nature of the mind
From such a perfect kind
The world is expanding by abusive violence
The smell of the pure untained, untouched
A shapeless dimension of humanity
Embrancing sense of control
Craving
Tearing
All your life
Degenerated breed / Unfertile seed
Countless messes dwell in disbelief
Emotions in a fragile mortality
Desperation totally absorbing your life
Burning insanity
Like a stillborn walking the earth
Denying the gift of birth
Prasing indolence in drowning existence
