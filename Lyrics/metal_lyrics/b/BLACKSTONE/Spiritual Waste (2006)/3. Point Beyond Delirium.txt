This is the outcome the inner evolution in a conflict being
That never asked to be reborn in this hole
The new ones are close to her gracefull smile
And remind things you can't related to her thoughts
There is no way to contact her
Cause she has nothing to again
Into the coldness movements of her life
Insanity, affinity, infinity combined
And there is no way to contact her
We always knew about your pain
She's completly Dehumanized
She had nothing more to find
The days have come when you die
The spirits are taking their time to heal the wounds
And save your life again I will be here by your side
The unseen spirits it's above all elements that cover the ground
Be stronger enough to cleanse and pain your soul
Through this empty fog, far away from the sun
I fade into this downward fall
Walking - she's walking her own path
Desperate - is what she has become
Crushing - her spirit and her mind
No more - happy ever after
