I can't find a place in myself
A place where all I can see and comprehend
The movement of civilizations where I belong
There is nothing in the world
Far into the inner universe
There is no path to the afterglow
Following the same quest
To shake death is hands
Once again i'm falling
As the old stream of life goes dying
The last truth has come to the end
The seatch of the absolute it's revealed
My soul flows in a constant progress
To a level of abstraction once again
