As you feel your life depart from this world
So far away on a distant star
It is a new light your dasire
A dismal universe it's getting higher
Into the light of your return you will march alone
The soul has lost it's innocence
Profound is the pain from which is born deliverance
Those eyes was not meant to see heaven
In the solvent ways of death this path seems endless
So it's now the moment
So that is the reason
All those years looking at the sky
Long is the path which leads to the light
We're in a magic relationship with the universe but we have forgot it
It's the connection that flow in our souls
We are displaying for evermore
In death entwined you could not believe my words
Remeber the time in which your soul was guided by the light from a distant star
Those eyes was not meant to see heaven
Unable to see more of this death within the patterns of divinity.
