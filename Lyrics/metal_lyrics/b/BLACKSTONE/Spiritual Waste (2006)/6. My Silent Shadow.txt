I enter the maze of glass
To which i'm strained
Shattered by Thoughts
The gate to my subconscious open wide
Release the power no longer know by man
What some seek in tje depths of the unknown
Uncertain for what truth of lies I will find
Apocalyptic fears of the course this domain will take
Ancient insanity, self destruction I create
My eyes shall never greet the sun again
Another world inside of me
My silent shadow
My conscious is reaching the twilight world
Erasing the difference i'm connected and deformed
This astray life has sieged my soul
What am I to reality? What i've become?
