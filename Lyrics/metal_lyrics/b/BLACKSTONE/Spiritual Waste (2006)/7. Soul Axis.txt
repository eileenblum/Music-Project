Can't you see my frozen Heart?
Eternalizing being in my own dead world
Wandering through holes my eyes are blinds
Can't you see don't you know you'll suffer in this paralyzing though
Eliminate all fragile emotions in order to create the axis of your soul
Bringing the unholy cruse
To the masses that were force to prevent
Any fracture in this devouring word
...and the silence that embrace my
It's the stream of consciousness
Living out of this maze I wake into another sphere beyound the threshold of this world
There is a place where you born again a place of many deaths
Our masses were assure to bring eternal fall
in dismay my body sighs so you can see there is no hope
