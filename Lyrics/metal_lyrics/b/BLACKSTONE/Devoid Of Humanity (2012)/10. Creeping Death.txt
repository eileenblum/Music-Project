[originally by Metallica]Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh heed
To his every word, live in fearfaith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer wait
Something must be done, four hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now
Let my people go, land of goshen
Goi will be with thee, bush of fire blood
Running red and strong, down the nil plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I rule the midnight air
The destroyer orn
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I creep the steps and flood final darkness
Bloodlambs blood painted door, I shall pass
