We're lost in the mountains
for reasons unknown
And so you wonder why have we come?
The more we breathe the sooner we die
No vegetation only the fallen snow

We are victims of this hostile lands,
we're in the thoms avalanch

Devoid of all breath in the air, devoid all
faith that we have share
It wasn't meant to end this way
This is our last breath of life, we face the thuth
for the first time
'Cause we are those who are no more

The souls of those for whom we cry
Now are bleeding from the struggle leaving
our bodies out of sight
We all have beast that dwells within 
In the depths of your own sins

Just one second left to behold my life again
and realize that nothing remains the same
Welcome to the battlefield, no more suffering,
no more fears

We're dead in the mountains
for reasons unknown
Hoping to be saved from oblivion
We're travelled a long long way
to be here now
All we used to be is buried in the snow
