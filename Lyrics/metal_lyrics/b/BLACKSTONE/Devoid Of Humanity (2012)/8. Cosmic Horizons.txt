This endless search beyond
the cosmos of the soul
Beneath the sands of oceans
A long time ago
this was subconscious overflow
Now all the truth revealed

Being in the spectral plane
2000 years of evolution
This is the virtual reality
Multidimensional consciousness

We're bringing to the light
experiences of the past life
Evoking answers to the mind
Confine of shadows,
visceral reactions in our world
Glorified the wish of power

Trapped beneath
The forgotten lands, desolation
Passing through the cosmic horizons

Through the door of endless time
We fall beyond the burning sky
Like clouds that ever sink behind
The cosmic horizon's fading line
