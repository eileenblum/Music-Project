I'm walking through the path
That surrounds me for a long time
Very deep in my heart
Lies the roots where only instincts remains

I was trapped and vanquished by the
treacherous storm
I'm afraid i have to go and never return

Far from the sadness i found my soul eclipse
The place where the storm seals my fate now
it's frozen

I'm scattered in the wind
I disappear into the mist
I feel the cold around my naked soul
and pity life, Let me awake let me
open up my eyes, I'm drifting away
Is it time to meet my destiny?
How will i survive?
This torment i am living towards the day i die
