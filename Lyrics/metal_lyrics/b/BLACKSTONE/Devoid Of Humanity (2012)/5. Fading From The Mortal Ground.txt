Retuming once again to the abyss
Desolation reings supreme
Revel in the fields of nightmares
Beyond the waking plain

Destroyed... Destroyed
by the years of defilement

Conscience devoured drawn into infamy
My spirit writhes in nothingness

No life beyond the flesh,
there's no love no disgrace
The carnal healing of the soul
Above the sky of sorrow i elevate
Fading from the mortal ground

Throw the stones that kills the truth
Deception must be absolute
Crawling on the darkened shores
Where humans do no exist
Fallen fragments and hailstorms
Devoid of Humanity
