A Broken soul levitate from your grave
Can't you breath? Can't you see? Now you
know there is no pain

You fall apart from the sadness again
There's no time
there's no death,
there's no lost,
this is the end

This ethereal life continues
in these endless centuries
It contains the mind in a higher
innerscape too far to reach

Only ashes remains of you
What to do? will transcend?
will arise? where is the truth?
Liberation coming soon

Destined to feed the worms of wounds
You choose to be left with no will to live
Now what's to come?
Your entity begins it's path

The call of a thousand dwelling souls, the
number of the infected ones increases
Useless denial of reality

Agonize - burn through the sky
Revelation - ritual defiled
Beyond the horizon the nightmares begins

Brutalize - crawl in disgust
Living terror - deeds undone
Symptoms of fulminant deseases
