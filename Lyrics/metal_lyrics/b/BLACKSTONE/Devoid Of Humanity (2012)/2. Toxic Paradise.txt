The last generation, the last civilization
With no capacity to manifest their supremacy
Collective minds with no power of thoughts
Drowning in sadness by their own hands

Human intelligence, the lack of elements
Dominion of their own integrity,
spiritual waste
Following a simple concept,
transmissions of the fallen
Waves of mental terror, empty space

Altered planet
Uncover the earth

This is the evolution round
This time is different than before
The tech and progress uncontrolled
We have now reach the threshold

Global experiment
Eradicate the seeds of all humanity
Weather manipulate
Population pestilence apocalypse
