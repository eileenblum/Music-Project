Within the bounds of life and death,
begin and end
Lies the evolution of all that lives
Behold the vision of all dimensions
From the perspective of eternity

Days fade out the clock of existence
When Dreams start to roam the nowhere
Birth of new beings in nature's creation
To die and evolve in a new sphere

Dark decades before my eyes surrounded by
The edge of reality, the edge of time
Monuments misplaced for centuries to come
Lives beyond the onces we know

Stranger aeons unknow to man, set the
Standards ew've tried to discover
Revealing purposes of future lives,
explain the presence,
the way to it's destination
Mirages of earthly existence

Sides of life unspoken by those in
search of the light
Mass domination, divine dispensation,
followers of masters they defy
