This is a call for warfare
This is the voice of today
Broken homes, violence, bloodshed
Future's swept away

This is the sound of survival
This is the sound of the truth
This is your world coming down on you

This is the day of judgment
This is the time to come
Crisis upon crisis
Pounding till we're done

This is the sound of survival
This is the sound of the truth
This is the world coming down on you

This is the sound of survival
This is the sound of survival
This is the sound of survival
Of the truth!

This is the mind on survival
This is a word to the meek
Realize your power
Fight and die on your feet

This is the sound of survival
This is the sound of the truth
This is your world coming down on you
This is your world coming down on you
