War is raging across the continents
Riots under a scorching summer sun
Famine wipes out millions in the aftermath
Man-made disease
Can't be overcome!

Mother mercy!
There's hell to pay and chaos fills my mind

Mother mercy!
Running scared with nowhere left to hide

Burning are the cities of the western world
Annihilated nations in the east
Power structures shift in a collapsing world
Life brought to a halt
on madness' eve!

Mother mercy!
There's hell to pay and chaos fills my mind

Mother mercy!
Running scared with nowhere left to hide

Raging wars
Burning skies
Sudden death
Failing structures
Final collapse

Mother mercy!
There's hell to pay and chaos fills my mind

Mother mercy!
Running scared with nowhere left to hide

Mother mercy!
There's hell to pay and chaos fills my mind

Mother mercy!
Welcome to the end of our... our time
