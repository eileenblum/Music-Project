Thirteen heads
War for claws
Twisting facts
Face the Hydra
From the bottomless pit
Tell truth as it fits
In league with the beast
Downfall unleashed

In the hour of chaos
Cold hearts made of steel
Closing the riff
Between panic and fear

Face the storm that's coming through
Sinners and saints unite against you
Humanity walks amongst the graves
