Veiled in lies. Told to honest eyes.
Bedtime stories for the world.
So immense the reach. So complete the siege.
Feeding lies to such extremes.
We wonÂ´t believe. TruthÂ´s like a dream.
Seeping through only at the seams.
Never get a glimpse of what it could be.
Choked in a world thatÂ´s changed.

Seeking for the truth.
In desperate times.
Looking beyond the tales that suit their side.
