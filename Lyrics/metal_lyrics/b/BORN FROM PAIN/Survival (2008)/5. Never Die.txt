Suicide run
Choosing death
Under the gun
Darkness ahead
Shoot the relief
Destroy only self
Bitter world
Escape into hell
Failing, sliding; never die!
Strengthened, rising; never die!
Powered, fighting; never die!
Remaining relentless
The policy we face is tactical genocide
Pulling the trigger on the troubled mind
Addiction to kill, ambition in our eyes
Never to speak, never to rise
Try to keep me silent, but I choose to be...
Never die
Relentless
