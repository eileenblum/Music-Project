Thoughts are thought,
From the heart.
The fight is there,
The fight is hard.
Done with failure
Walk the line.
Done with hardship,
Wasting time.
Pushing harder
On the edge.
Keeping balance
On the ledge.
Believing then,
Believing now,
Giving in
Don't know how

Fighting harder!

Thoughts are thought,
From the heart.
The fight is there,
The fight is hard.
Done with failure
Walk the line.
Done with hardship,
Wasting time.

Fighting harder!
