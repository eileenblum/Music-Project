Rampage life sets the tone
Everybody's on it's own
All that's safe and all that used to be clear
All security disappeared
Fear and stress make their claim
Right and wrong are lost along the line
Fear and stress make their claim
The Wolves are loose and they're out for blood!
Remaining faceless, lurk in the dark waiting still!
Remaining faceless, lurk in the dark to kill at will!
