This is a time of do or die
Bred on hate
Facing fate
When it comes fast
It comes down hard

Trapped in fear
Trapped in despair
Future's dark
Heading nowhere
As the pressure builds
My will is hard

These are the lives we live

Sons of a dying world!
We are sons of a dying world!

This is a time of do or die
Bred on hate
Facing fate
When it comes fast
It comes down hard

These are the lives we live

Sons of a dying world!
We are sons of a dying world!
We are dying, dying world
We are sons of a dying world!

This ain't the world I knew
Distilled, corrupted truth
It's pure survival
Nothing like it should...
Lost in a dying world
Lost in a dying world
Born to survival
Nothing like it could...

Sons of a dying world!
We are sons of a dying world!
We are dying, dying world
We are sons of a dying world!
