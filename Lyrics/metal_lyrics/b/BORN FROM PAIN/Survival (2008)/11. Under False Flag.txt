The ruthless, the shameless, the faceless.
Devouring, usurping for ages.
Saving us from threat, slavery ahead, freedom slips away.
Calculate, decimate, shaping fate.

Shutting my eyes.
I realize.
We are kept from the truth.

The ruthless, the shameless, the faceless.
Legislate, obliterate, shaping fate.

Shutting my eyes.
I realize.
We are kept from the truth.

Question always, look for truth.
Propaganda shaping you.
Control your thought, control your mind.
Rewrite the past, fail to fight.

Shutting my eyes.
I realize.
We are kept from the truth.
