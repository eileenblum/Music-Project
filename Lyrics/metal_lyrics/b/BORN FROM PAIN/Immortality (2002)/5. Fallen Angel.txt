The writings on the wall
All spell hell
Completely crashed and burned again
Pitchblack darkness
One last prelude to madness
Your last barrier
My last frontier

I can feel the flames

Carry the load
I'm drowning in this massacre of truth
Your wings torn
Now you fall
I see your face
I see your eyes
There is no emotion
As I watch you fall!

I see you fall
Cast from my eternal heaven
As you bleed
Bleed with me
Bleed with me empty
In my eternal hell...
