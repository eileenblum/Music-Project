Dark side of innocence
Dragging me down
Thrown into this pit
I never reached the ground
Veiled ghosts of tomorrow
Echoes of the past
Coming back to haunt me
This feeling ever lasts
No sense of relief
I'm bound to burn
Respect is taken
Finding no solace in your words

Only words...
From tongues so forked they fall apart

The serpent in the grass
Slithers stealthly
Only reconfirms
This immortality
Immortality...

Alone within these walls I face my fear
Tempted throughout time to cut it clear
Venom in my veins
Am I still sane
Scarred and bleeding but still master of the game
Scarred and bleeding...
