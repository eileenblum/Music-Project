Oceans filled with blood of ages
Centuries of eternal lies
Churchwalls dripping with blood
Never will I repent to your god
Now who've become the fallen
Who have abandoned
The faith you've taught
You've turned into the sinners
Who've nailed your savior to a cross

Empty out the chalice
So poisonous the blood
Body of christ polluted
Answer to your god

Your heavens layed to waste
Still sin follows sin
The dead scream out your name
For their innocent blood is spilled

Confront your god
Burn in hell...
