Frozen in time to stand alone
Majestically untouched by sun
Slave to the fears of this bitterness
A monument for days to come

Time has passed as tall shadows fall
Carved into this stone
Timeless ache sits on it's golden throne
This war remains my own

Tarnished by erosion
Rather die than run
Struggling through this life
I claw, I tear, I fight to overcome

Never take my honor
Never drain my blood
Hold on to what's dear
Alone I stand defend all that I've got

Defend all that I've got...
This war remains my own!
