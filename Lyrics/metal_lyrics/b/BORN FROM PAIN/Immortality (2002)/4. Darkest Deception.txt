The weight of darkness falls short of consideration
Of the lives of millions that have bled
A structure built on sand
This hammer crushes all
All that's reason
All belief in the goodness of this life

Why longer live these lies
Why fall to our knees and die

This culture rotten to the core
2000 years in the shadow of death

Conditioned billions
Embracing death
As the greater good
Erasing life in the blink of an eye

Standards fade
Civilised decline
Must we bleed
For the sake of... bloodred skies
