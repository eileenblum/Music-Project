Swing of the blade comes so fast
No time to rest, betrayal moves silent
As all heavens come crashing down
Stand witness to the demise of what's left

Palaces in ruins
Unbolt the doors
Staring down the hole
To await another blow
Battered and wrecked
Inside torn apart
The harshness of reality
Tears away the past

Anxiety builds... up inside of me

Swept away by the undertow
Crops up, overwhelming, ready to explode
Walking in the shadow of myself
The darkside of the soul, try to regain, what's left

Dedication,
As my weapon against blades that bring the pain
Armour as my shield
Against ego's that have gone insane

Blades that bring the pain...
