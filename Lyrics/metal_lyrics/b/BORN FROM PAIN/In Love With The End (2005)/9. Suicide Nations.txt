Cross the line, feel the weight
All around us now
Growing harder, cutting deeper
Futureï¿½s heading southbound

See this pain in a world without mercy
Slipped away, lost the track only hurt here...

Suicide
Suicide nations
Suicide...

New horizons, colder days
All there is is now
Life and death go hand in hand
Suicideï¿½s the new god

See this pain in a world without mercy
Slipped away, lost the track only hurt here...

Suicide
Suicide nations
Suicide...

Weï¿½ve grown hard, we donï¿½t care
Like a plague razes through humanity
We shed no love, we shed no light
We love the end, this is suicide
