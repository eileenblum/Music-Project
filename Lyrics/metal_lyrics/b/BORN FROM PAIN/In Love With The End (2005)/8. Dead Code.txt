Life has bled my senses
Ripped up the peace inside
I touch the coming darkness
Wounds gasping open wide

Too real to close the case
The drone goes on and on
Heralding the end
But I hold out to save myself

The code seems dead inside
Watching my every step
Alone I fight tonight

Seconds flashing by
Now insightï¿½s making way
As minutes waste it self
On hours... Of these days

The code seems dead inside
Watching my every step
Alone I fight tonight

Prepare to face it, prepare to fight
Nothingï¿½s that blissful can be constant in our life
Nothing is sacred, nothing is safe
Things that make us stronger can just crush us any day
