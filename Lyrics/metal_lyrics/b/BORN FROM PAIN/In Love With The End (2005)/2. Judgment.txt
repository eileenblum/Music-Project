Judgment, itï¿½s in the air
You canï¿½t escape it, you canï¿½t prepare
Weï¿½ve had our chances, weï¿½ve played our part
See it coming down, hitting hard

Judgment strikes
It strikes us down
Societyï¿½s sicknessï¿½ grown
In all our hearts without a sound

Judgment strikes
We rise to fall
Time is drawing closer
Read the writings on the wall

In times when everything we have
Turns to everything we had
Premeditated, self-inflicted, manufactured is our...
Judgment!...
