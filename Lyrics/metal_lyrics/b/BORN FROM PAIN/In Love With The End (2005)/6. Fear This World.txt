Pitch-black skies, as the sun burns cold
Faded lives are drained neglected
In this world where fear decides
Over good and bad, who lives who dies

Step it up, this is primal urge
Panic integrates, celebrates deception
Intelligence has become denounced
As we balance on the verge, as we dance on the edge of...

Dark psychology
Basic savagery
This is warfare
In our homes, inside our heads

Pitch-black skies, as the sun burns cold
Faded lives are drained neglected
In this world where fear decides
Over good and bad, who lives who dies

Dark psychology
Basic savagery
This is warfare
In our homes, inside our heads

And I canï¿½t believe weï¿½re taught to fear this world

Fooling imagery
Testing loyalty
Prepare to fear this
Blacklisting thinking minds

Dark psychology
Basic savagery
This is warfare
In our homes, inside our heads
