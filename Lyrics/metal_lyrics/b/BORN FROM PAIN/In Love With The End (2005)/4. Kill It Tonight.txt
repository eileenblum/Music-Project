Looking back to find it, what was lost, faded grey
Thinking how the failed ways of my life haunt me today
Wasted years so empty, wasted years to mourn
Taking life the harder way, too much thatï¿½s dead and gone

Forgive me ï¿½ I tried, forgive me ï¿½ I failed
But nothing could keep me here
In a place to close to home
I failed everyone that seemed to care

Forgive me ï¿½ I tried, forgive me ï¿½ I failed
The bridges Iï¿½ve walked have burned
Didnï¿½t even know myself back then
Forgive me... (I wasnï¿½t strong!!!)

Kill it tonight
Ghost of the past
Kill it tonight

Kill it tonight
Take it away
Kill it tonight...
