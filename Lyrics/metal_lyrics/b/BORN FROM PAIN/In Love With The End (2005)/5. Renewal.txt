You want to see me crawl
Fall down, trip the wire
Get caught in the storm
Fail myself, betray desire

Your hate just fuels my strength
Your bitterness feeds my will
Through all the years Iï¿½ve learned
And I grow harder still

Your world feeds this fire

Raging in my heart
Mastering the arts
Of losing and learning
Crashing and burning
I wonï¿½t let me down

Breaking walls of silence
Crushing them brick by brick
Smashing a world of envy
Everything comes on me

Reject the burden of fear
Nothing can drag me down
Through all the years Iï¿½ve learned
Nothing can take my crown

Raging in my heart
Mastering the arts
Of losing and learning
Crashing and burning
I wonï¿½t let me down

Your world feeds this fire...
