This is the new hate...

The world just turns and turns
Until weï¿½re mad with rage
Pushing twisted visions
Prelude to darker days

Sliding down the steep road
Crushing all our faith
Beware whatï¿½s taught this age
This is the new hate

A downward spiral
Dragging us down
Descending further
Till we hit the ground...

This is the new hate...
