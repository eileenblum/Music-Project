Pushed down ï¿½ to fit the mold
Raised to fit and fail
Living, learning life in the shadows
Of what could have been

Born dead ï¿½ or so itï¿½s told
In your coffin youï¿½re laid
Caged up, struggling and tearing to break free
Fighting hard as nails

Timeï¿½s just ticking away
Dreams die hard so make your way
Nothingï¿½s flawless, nothingï¿½s easy
Grab each chance to seize the day

No oneï¿½s born to loose
Not with a will and a chance to choose
Focus clear, push it hard
Live life for your truth

Breathe in ï¿½ this is your life
This is a brand new day
Chances come and go in a lifetime
Take what comes your way

Rage now ï¿½ resurrect yourself
Take it all, make your stand
Find the will inside, no one can be that in love with the end

Timeï¿½s just ticking away
Dreams die hard so make your way
Nothingï¿½s flawless, nothingï¿½s easy
Grab each chance to seize the day

No oneï¿½s born to loose
Not with a will and a chance to choose
Focus clear, push it hard
Live life for your truth

Time ticks away
