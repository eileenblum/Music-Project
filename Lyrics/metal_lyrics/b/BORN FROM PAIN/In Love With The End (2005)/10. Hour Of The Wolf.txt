World in new decay
I see decline of centuries strayed
Lack respect for love and life
Numbered seem our days

In the hours so small
Sanity fights and pays itï¿½s toll
Everyone tries to save their soul
Man against his own

Weï¿½re drowning in sweet despair
Feel the hour of the wolf draw near

Try to make a stand
In a world that loves the end
The essence of temptation
Now I comprehend

Weï¿½re drowning in sweet despair
Feel the hour of the wolf draw near
Weï¿½re moving through slow despair
See the hour of the wolf... draw near

The hour of the wolf
When fire lights the sky
The hour of the wolf
When you and I must die
