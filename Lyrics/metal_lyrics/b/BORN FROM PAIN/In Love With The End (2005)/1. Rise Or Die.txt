Sands of time slip away, see us hurting
Slowly see decline this time, increase the burden
Pending bloodshed, endless lies, there seems no end
Moving up into our lives, humanity seems to be in love...

Rise up to the misery
Thatï¿½s coming down
Face up to the enemy
Life will be devoured

Rise up to the misery
Thatï¿½s coming down
Must learn from the past
Weï¿½re the ones in power

World in flames, no escape, itï¿½s here and now
Ripped up civilization, humanity seems to be in love...

Seek the truth
Live the lie
Swim or drown
Rise or die
