Feeling my life has been tainted
Accept this when life's so much more?
They've always been on the taking
My end left to settle the score

Bleeding heart out to search my truth
On the edge, staring down
But I'll never reach the ground

Moving on to better days
Iron willed I pave my way
A world of pain. I'm not born to lose
