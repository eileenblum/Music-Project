In a world that's old, in a world that's cold
In a life where emptiness is king
In instable times of broken hearts and minds
Where my resurrection begins
In a time of war in the head and more
I will find a way to crush the lies
I must break and live, so I can forgive
Myself when I look into my eyes

This is my call to arms and I will stop at nothing. Stop at nothing

What we won't do tomorrow we bury today
Life is hard but there's only one way
Stop at nothing - crush defeat
Stop at nothing - live your dreams

Stop at nothing - crush defeat
Stop at nothing - live your dreams
Stop at nothing - time won't wait
Stop at nothing - shape your fate
