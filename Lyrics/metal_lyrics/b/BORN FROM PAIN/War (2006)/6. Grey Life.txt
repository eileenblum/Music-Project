There is no more rest in me.
Today I question society.
Tried to take all the dead-end paths.
Tried to see my possibilities.
Every door slammed in my face.
The words they spoke added to the weight,
I carry on this back of mine.
I feel it will break any time.

Nothing that I do can help me.
Everything in this world seems against me.
Where is the chance I need?
Torn to pieces by this reality.
Nothing that I do can help me.
Everything in this world seems against me.
I used to drown in dreams.
Now close to accepting defeat

Grey Life

What am I to do? Where am I to go?
This life is cold and grey. Losing hope so soon
