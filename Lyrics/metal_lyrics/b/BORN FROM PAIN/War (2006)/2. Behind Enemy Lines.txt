Forced to fight, behind the lines
Trying to find my way
In a warzone called society
Can we really be free?
Force to fight grab and claw
Against the enemy
There's no help or time for dreams
And it hardens me
Pushing down, destroy my will
Kept at bay, in for the kill

We're all behind enemy lines
We're all under siege
Under Pressure, under attack
It's getting harder to breath
We're all behind enemy lines
We're all behind

Forced to fight behind the lines
Locked in a living cell
Pushing down a slippery road
Sliding down to hell
Forced to fight struggle and rise
In the trenches of life
Those supposed to represent us
On the other side
