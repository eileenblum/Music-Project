Life is wearing down. I feel distress, feeling too cold
Brought down, left to suffer. Fighting back to turn it around
Pushed down in the dirt. Feel too lost, feeling no worth
The enemies surround. Under siege but victory bound

Bury me fighting, against your "western" wisdom.
These are the signs of times to come
Bury me fighting, against your "western" kingdom.
These are the signs of times to come

All I know is that we're stripped.
Stripped from dignity on this deathtrip
All I know is I will fight.
Find my way back and turn the tide
