Pace is fast, suffer creation
Life in agony, all condemned
It's coming down, remorse is senseless
Drown in flames, regret is meaningless
All is black as we reach the end
Last remains of a raped society
Progress a means to regress to dust
Purity of souls filled with disgust

Here lies civilization
Epitaph for a slaughtered world
Here lies civilization
The remains of a butchered earth

And I don't think men will ever learn
There is so little hope
I don't think men will ever see
That what we get is we've sown

Here lies civilization
Epitaph for a slaughtered world
Here lies civilization
The remains of a butchered earth

There will be no dawn for human kind
