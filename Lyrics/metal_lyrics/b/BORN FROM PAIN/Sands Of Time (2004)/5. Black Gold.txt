Digging deep into the ground
Black gold seeking, hell bound
Enter dark shafts
Early up and old
Wrecking themselves
Misery unfolds
It eats their flesh,
Drinks their blood
Strangled in it's hands
Cast into the fiery hole

Killing without mercy
Live the curse of this darkened world
On their knees, undeserving
Of deadly fate that might unfold

As hours pass by
They see their children die
They see their lovers killed
By the devil... itself

We will not forget
Curse the black gold
