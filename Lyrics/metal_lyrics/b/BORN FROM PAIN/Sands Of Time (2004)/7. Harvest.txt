Filth of ages floats
Like the burning soil
Destruction becomes harvest
The hell where my blood boils
Empty is eternity
Realize what's left
Falling down, hollow soul
I beg for quicker death

I fear the time to come, the age of another light
Texture burned beyond my soul, I crawl onto the night
State of grace, bleeding eyes, life has come to this
Forsaken past, forsaken future, clench my broken fist
Harvest...

Visions of the future
Like my nightmares in the past
Nothing fades to lesser
Going nowhere fast
