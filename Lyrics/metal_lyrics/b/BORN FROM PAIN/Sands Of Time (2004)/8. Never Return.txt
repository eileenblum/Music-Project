Scorching heat 'till deliverance
The tide is turning
I've seen the face
The fall of idols
I must escape
Leaving this time behind
Trapped in (a) stalemate
Lasting lifetimes
End the siege
Broken soul
Forever burning
I live this life.
Answering to only me

Losing focus to see what's real
Never Return
Weathered by time to lay it on the line
Never Return
Compromise, weakness I can't afford
Never Return

Breaking stone
Cracking concrete
No limits pending
Raging harder
Breathing deeper
Feeling life

Will to rise
Self-made man
Can't take this from me
Bury me
No cross to bear
My soul is carved
Never Return
