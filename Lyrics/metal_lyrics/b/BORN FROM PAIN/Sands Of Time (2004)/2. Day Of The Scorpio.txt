Out to destroy
Every inch of your world
Enemy of mine
Trying to tear down all that I stand for
Built up over time
This is my final stand
My call to arms
My smile in the face of defeat
I stand alone
And face this hail of knives
This throne belongs to me
My final stand...

... Among the fratricide
I learned to take the pain
Your rules of life I fail to comprehend
Is this my fall from grace?
Built my strength with the lies
Spit them in your face
I am reborn, I feel empowered
This is the only way
I'm once again...

Out to destroy
Every inch of your world
Enemy of mine
Trying to tear down all that I stand for
Built up over time
This is my final stand
My call to arms
My smile in the face of defeat
I stand alone
And face this hail of knives
This throne belongs to me
My final stand

This is my final stand

Knee-deep in betrayal, sifting through remains of
might, my final stand
Out to destroy, with newborn strength I fight your world
