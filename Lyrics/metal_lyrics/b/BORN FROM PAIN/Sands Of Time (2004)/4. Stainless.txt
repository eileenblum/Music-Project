I'm a man that walks all alone
In this godforsaken world
Played this life too much as a game
Never turned it to reverse
Never got what I really wanted
Or needed to do what's right
But what's true is me to myself
And my thoughts in the dead of the night

Look inside this heart
It's the rules of the game
And if this is what it takes
I'll take the pain...

Look inside my heart
It's a heart without shame
It's been put to the test and remains stainless

Stainless like steel

Bled for many sins
life's not always fair
Feel a part of me dying
I'm still going nowhere
