Betrayed by me
I am my own worst enemy
Murder in the first degree
Of my serenity

Nothing ends, those days won't fade
Everything too little, too late
Endless hours, endless days
Fighting myself to find my way
World of pain on my shoulders
Watch me bow down to this
Cut it loose so pain gets older
My anger leads my fists

I breath the air
So cold inside
Time doesn't heal
I fight the tide

Facing time, I got no faith
The clock creeps on, I'm living yesterday
Take me on to days to come,
Take me to where I belong

I breath the air
So cold inside
Time doesn't heal
I fight the tide

Fight the Rising Tide

Nothing ends, those days won't fade
Everything too little, too late
Endless hours, endless days
Fighting myself to find my way
World of pain on my shoulders
Watch me bow down to this
Cut it loose so pain gets older
My anger leads my fists
