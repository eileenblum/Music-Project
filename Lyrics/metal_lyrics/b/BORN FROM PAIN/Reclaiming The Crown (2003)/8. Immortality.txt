Darkside of innocence dragging me down
Thrown into this pit, I never reached the ground
Veiled ghosts of tomorrow, echoes of the past
Coming back to haunt me, this feeling ever lasts
No sense of relief, I'm bound to burn
Respect is taken, finding no solace in your words

Only words...
From tongues so forked they fall apart

The serpent in the grass
Slithers stealthly
Only reconfirms
This immortality

Immortality

Alone within these walls I face my fear
Tempted throughout time to cut it clear
Venom in my veins, am I still sane
Scarred and bleeding but still master of the game

Scarred and bleeding
