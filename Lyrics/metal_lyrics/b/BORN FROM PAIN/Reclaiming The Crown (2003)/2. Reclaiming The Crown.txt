Breathing to come alive
Ressurection under the knife

Feel the wind
Feel the rain
It comes down hard
But I'll fight again

Seeking for a way out
Smothered, gasping for air
Slashing, fighting demons
True strength will get me there

Pick me back up
Down on the ground
Reclaim my crown
As this dark age is crumbling down
