Plunging into length of days
Nothing can... erase the shadows ever deeper into me

Can't be redeemed, roots undenied
Never release, continuing the bloodline

Apathy a lonely master
Tempting given fate
One foot in the grave
But I'm not new to this trade

Drench me in the blood
Of what I call my own
Cleansed in purgatory
Defying all, I roam
All but regret

Can't be redeemed
Never release

Ever deeper...
Plunging into length of days
Nothing can... erase the shadows ever deeper into me
Plunging... Deeper... Plunging...
Deeper into me...
