Bleeding, black blood 'till the end
Thrown down, tattered, beaten,
In the dirt, left for dead
Watching, the demise of all that's been
No forgiveness, no remorse
Created the very hell you're in

No remorse...
Marked for death
Vengeance burns
Feeding flames
Of no return
... To this life.

Tearing up this farce
Rusted life of sin
Nothing you proclaim
Can save you from your end

My means to an end
No saviour
... I will stay true.

Burned down bridges, ashes of my life
Left to burn, a beacon in the night
Slit my throat, will never bleed again
Cut it down to size, initialize the end.
