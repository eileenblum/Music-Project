Ever raging, the quest for silence
A merciless war on the rise
Dismissed to hold back the pain
Glistening daggers I thrust
Bite the bullet, the silver curse

Inferno - The burning of my soul
As I glimpse at glory
Burning - Lifetimes put to halt
My heart grows cold

Eaten alive by hatred
My heart turns to black
Hunted down
Staying ahead of the pack
The ultimate release
Comprehension has failed
Code of honor, fistfull of courage
Turning hard as nails

Hard as nails

Downfall of a demigod
The new-found order breeds fear
Indulging in the fate
Of harvesting the years
