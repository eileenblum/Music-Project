Cut loose in the dead of night
Broken silence ends
Found long lost salvation
In a last act of despair
Salvation - freed from false delight
Salvation - at the end embraced by light

Long lost freedom
Prisoner of self
Forsaken existance
On the long road through this hell
Holes dug deeper
Can't crawl up these walls
Bliss overruled by chaos
Forever all is gone

Passing on to better days
Passing... on to salvation

Finding yourself
At the edge of your life
Burning slowly
Destined to pain you hide
A final journey
Touched by death itself
Redemption for all sins
Of a never forgotten man
