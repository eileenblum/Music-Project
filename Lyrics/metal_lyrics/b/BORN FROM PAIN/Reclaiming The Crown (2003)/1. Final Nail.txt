Murdered under blackened skies
Bleeding from a thousand wounds
Crushing through the edge of me
Sworn vengeance ripping through
As my heart pounds my chest like fists
Branded in my soul to burn
Biting the hand that feeds
The price of lessons learned

I have emerged
I will regain
There's darker days
Coming your way

... Get hammered down

Final nail in your coffin - no more regret
Final nail in your coffin - embrace oblivion
Final nail in your coffin - no more regret
Final nail in your coffin - reborn to conquer
