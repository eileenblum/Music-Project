In this cold and dark forest
Fearg is now alone and revels in a deep animality
He runs and flees without knowing nor understanding
Because terror drowns him, and like an animal terrified by the unknown
He runs until exhaustion

Thirsty I lie down by a pond
Its reflection, who is this frightening swine?

The beast instinct is now supplanting the man
And his desperate escape seems never to end

For days and days, I've been running
Without knowing where or why I'm going to
I'm losing myself, I forgot all of my being and conscience
Who I was I just don't know

A strange thing distorts me from within
No longer man. I feel like I loose my soul

The more time passes, the more Fearg transforms
His crazy eyes turn to red, the body covered with mud and leaves

I roam at night, waiting for signs of the red moon
And I hunt like a wild marauder

No longer a man, I feel like I lose my soul

The more time passes, the more woods transform
The Sidh is slowly opening, in a dark and morbid energy

Where have I arrived? World of death
And these animals? Slay them all
The cold obscurity fills my soul
Under these shapeless trees, claws of death
Fearg comes to a glade of black soil
A weird atmosphere emanates from it, evil mood

Fearg strikes the altar and a giant Daimh Dorka appears
From the black soil and a big fight starts
He bites at the throat of the creature
And this one falls down wounded
But victorious Fearg falls also in a last howl
