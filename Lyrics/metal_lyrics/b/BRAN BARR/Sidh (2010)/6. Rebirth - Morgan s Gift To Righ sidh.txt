Fearg relieved the Sidh of its effete lord
But now in the rules dictated by this world
A world of which he's not. Who is this non-native?
Obscure personage, not a man anymore

The graceful queen Morgan cannot accept this boor
Such violent and mean he so really is
I relieved you of your demented god
In this decayed world which resembles nothing

The madness of Righ Coll harmed the peace of his world
That's why Morgan accepts that Fearg settles down
He takes care of the folks and regains serenity
And while he recovers the Sidh revives

Fearg regains his condition looked after by Analeth 
No remorse nor resentment, just a deep wound

As Fearg gets better he retrieves his parlance
But there's always in him a hint of animal
And Morgan is astonished by such a mutation
This man has saved the Sidh, glory to him

Fearg regains his condition looked after by Analeth 
No remorse nor resentment, just a deep wound

But the Sidh is not in a better shape
Daimh Dorkh's madness is a high concern

And the Marbh elves with their destructive rites
The continue to make the Sidh die

Morgan dubious sighs, she didn't wan a new king
Moreover this animal in fact was a man
How could a human being subsist the Sidh?
How did he survive Righ Coll's poison?
