The runaways are made captured by Cobru Neil and his guards
Fearg kills the king by accident at the time of the arrest
He is then imprisioned and Loucetius renounces him
Betrayers to Ultraigh deserve to die

I didn't to be your lord
Only a vile animal
And my hate is growing hard
Savage spawn of the forest
Your people are just pitiable
I am the one to enthrone
Your father had chosen me
I am the king from now on

The whole tribe pounces on him
To carry our worst tortures
Meangan in a revenge emasculates the rebel
He is the sentenced to death 
For ht murder of Cobru Neil
Loucetius by pity helps him flee

I didn't to be your lord
Only a vile animal
And my hate is growing hard
Savage spawn of the forest
Your people are just pitiable
I am the one to enthrone
Your father had chosen me
I am the king from now on

In a world of fools and poltroons
They are rats, I despise them all
May the wind carry my tears in the moor
May the stones absorbe my sorrow

The orphaned vagrant roams, alone
Making one with the woods

He meets spoilers, kills their Olc'h
Leader and takes command
During ten years of awe

Delirum and rage invades his heart
A cruel animal is about to be born

No mercy for none, not even druids or sages
Sadism and hatred stronger than bard satires
Always mare bestial, he expresses by deep growls
Feeding of the flesh of butchered victims

A day of hunt, he comes upon his tribe
Slays all in torment, including Loucetius

Senacha curses him before to die
No longer a man you are, as a beast you will roam
