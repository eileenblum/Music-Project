[Lyrics by Yoltar / Aed Morban]

[The three battles of Ultraigh]

[Formor]
Slairgh !!!
From beyond the seas weâll spring out, the Formors, mighty and proud
Slaying and killing the Keltains, to reign on Ultraigh we fight
The fortress TirhGoardch will fall by the flash of our bloody swords

[Keltain]
I Caturix the Albiorixâ son am swearing on my Keltain blood
I will avenge the Formorsâ betray by repulsing their troops away
We, the heroes of Ultraigh, the mightiest warriors of all lands
Tomorrow weâll face our doom to fight in honour until the end

Ultraigh will rise,
Ultraigh will rise,
Ultraigh will rise !
Ultraigh will fall !

[Formor]
Woe to the vanquished ! infernal torment
Sealed by fire and steel, a painful destiny
Now itâs time to feast to the glory of our race
To drink in the skulls of the craven Keltains

[Bard]
The first battle was a disaster for the Keltains though it was only the beginning, more battles will follow, more bravehearted warriors will be slain, more women will cry their fallen heroes... the massacre only began

[Keltain]
Ull khurnut uln dhomd dian, niur dar iarnaig, ull marbhrathard !
(Our honour we shall defend, avenge by the steel our killed brothers)

[Cairn:] Poor Keltain youâre doomed to death
[Caturix:]: Young virgin dread the battle, here the gaisâstrach defy you
[Cairn:] Fear my name I am torment, quicker than lightning I stab
[Caturix:]: Feel my hate, sustain my wrath, blood of wolf flows in my veins
[Cairn:] Taste of blood filling my mouth, my blade shreds your scarred bodies
[Caturix:]: Swords in fury are broken, anger embraces my soul
[Cairn:] I crush your skull, your end arrives
[Caturix:]: Wounded to death, I feel my soul escaping me

[Keltain]

[Highlander Leader]

[Prince of Bards]

[Bodararchand Wizard]

[Keltain]
The ground rumbles under the charge, Titanic clash of countless hordes
Battle frenzy embraces their souls, Feeding the need of massacre

[Bard and Formor]
During three days and three nights, the wrath of Keltains never failed
Dying for their land and freedom, (the) might of Lug filling their heart
Strength of Balor is so terrible, each attack, three hundred burned alive
Change this once fertile country into a swamp of blood
