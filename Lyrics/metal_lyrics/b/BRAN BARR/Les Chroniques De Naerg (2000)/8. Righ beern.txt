[Lyrics by Yoltar]

[Keltain]
When the Fights have been hard, when ennemies are vanquished
When the Land have been won, then the time has come to feast

May this elixir give us the strength and the courage
To fight and destroy betrayers under the sign of the Mighty Bran
We will raise the mug and we will feast until the dawn
And the glory of fathers, to the honour of our Land !

Come on warbrothers, let's gather and be proud
For we get massive power through brotherhood and pride
From beyond the darkest woods come in and slake your thirst
The Beern will flow in torrents for tonight we triumph !
