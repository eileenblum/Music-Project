Hey pretty pretty will you smile for the camera?
Just the girl next door, she's everyman's dream
Hey little lover got a secret to tell ya
I fell in love with you through my computer screen

Oh, could you believe it?
Girl, could you believe your eyes?
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
She blows a kiss through my LCD
I'm in love I'm in love with
PRETTY LITTLE THINGS

Little Lolita do you like to be tied up?
Barbie doll against the wall I'll make you scream!
Blindfolded hold your throat this is my love
Losing control, control over my hell machine

Oh, could you believe it?
Girl, could you believe your eyes?
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind

She blows a kiss through my LCD
I'm in love I'm in love with
PRETTY LITTLE THINGS

We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind

She blows a kiss through my LCD
I'm in love I'm in love with
PRETTY LITTLE THINGS

We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
We don't need your kind
