Sitting at your funeral
I'd have to say it's over do
Our family cries
The preacher really tries
To make your life sound meaningful
I fight to keep a straight face
My heart it glows as you decompose
And I wonder
Can you hear me laughing
Cause I'm dancing on your grave
I'm glad you're dead
All the pain you spread
It desipates away
That why I gotta say
I'm glad you're dead
But something in my head
Won't let me forget
All the things you did
And I wonder
Can you hear me laughing
Cause I'm dancing on your grave
Goodbye to misery
And all the things ya took from me
Beloved sister how you tricked her
The love was pain
We fought to get away
And for my mother
I hope you suffer
And I wonder
Can you hear me laughing
Cause I'm dancing on your grave
I feel it I'm gonna have party
And I'm so happy
Because you're gone
I feel it I'm the life of the parry
And we're so happy
Because you're gone
I hope you burn in Hell
I hope you burn in Hell
