I DON'T WANNA FALL IN LOVE TONIGHT
CAUSE I JUST NEED YOUR TOUCH AND THEN WE'LL SAY GOODBYE

AFTER THE SHOW WE COULD BE TOGETHER
YOU SAY I LOVE YOU
I SAY I KNOW

1-2-3-4 COME ON YOU WANNA LOVE ME
I SAY YOU'RE CRAZY
YOU GET TO PUSH AND SHOVING
AND SAY YA HATE ME BABY

I DON'T WANNA FALL IN LOVE TONIGHT
CAUSE I JUST NEED YOUR TOUCH AND THEN WILL SAY GOODBYE
YOU DON'T WANNA FALL FOR A GUY LIKE ME CAUSE I'M A ROGUE I'M JUST YOUR FANTASY

I'VE TRAVELED SO FAR
YOU SAY IT'S BEEN FOREVER
YOU ASK ME TO STAY
BUT I GOT TO GO

1-2-3-4 COME ON YOU WANNA LOVE ME
I SAY YOU'RE CRAZY
YOU GET TO PUSH AND SHOVING
AND SAY YA HATE ME BABY

I DON'T WANNA FALL IN LOVE TONIGHT
CAUSE I JUST NEED YOUR TOUCH AND THEN WILL SAY GOODBYE
YOU DON'T WANNA FALL FOR A GUY LIKE ME CAUSE I'M A ROGUE I'M JUST YOUR FANTASY

I DON'T WANNA FALL IN LOVE TONIGHT
CAUSE I JUST NEED YOUR TOUCH AND THEN WILL SAY GOODBYE

I DON'T WANNA FALL IN LOVE TONIGHT
CAUSE I JUST NEED YOUR TOUCH AND THEN WILL SAY GOODBYE

YOU DON'T WANNA FALL FOR A GUY LIKE ME CAUSE I'M A ROGUE I'M JUST YOUR FANTASY
