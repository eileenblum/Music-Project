YOU THINK I'M INNOCENT WHEN YOU LIE LIKE A BITCH
I JUST WANNA ERASE YOUR FACE
I'M TRYING TO BE A GENTLEMAN
LETS BEGIN AGAIN
TELL ME THE TRUTH THIS TIME
YOU THINK I'M LISTENING?
BABY CASH A CHECK THAT MY NOOSE IS AROUND YOUR NECK
YOUR NOT A WOMAN, NOT EVEN MY LOVER
JUST A WHORE UNDERCOVER, TRY TO BLAME IT YOUR MOTHER

YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU BUT YOU HAD TO GO AND TAKE IT TOO FAR
SEEMS LIKE YOUR GETTING OFF WHEN YOUR BREAKING MY HEART
EVERY TIME I SEE YOUR FACE
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU

I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU
I DON'T NEED, I DON'T NEED TO DO THIS TONIGHT
I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU
I DON'T NEED,I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT IN MY LIFE
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU

I USED TO FEEL FOR YOU, BUT NOW IT'S KINDA FUNNY THAT I'M WATCHING YOUR FACE TURN BLUE
I'M TIRED OF PLAYING THE NICE GUY
YOUR CAUGHT, BUT NICE TRY
PAYBACK'S A BITCH TONIGHT!
I CAN SEE YOU, RUNNING FROM A DEMON YOUR CRYIN AND A SCREAMIN
IF THIS IS THE MAN I AM
I'M STILL A FATHER! SO I CALLED MY LITTLE BROTHER
I SAID, "YA GOTTA PICK ME UP BEFORE I KILL MY BABY'S MOTHER!"

YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU BUT YOU HAD TO GO AND TAKE IT TOO FAR
SEEMS LIKE YOUR GETTING OFF WHEN YOUR BREAKING MY HEART
EVERY TIME I SEE YOUR FACE
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU

YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU BUT YOU HAD TO GO AND TAKE IT TOO FAR
SEEMS LIKE YOUR GETTING OFF WHEN YOUR BREAKING MY HEART
EVERY TIME I SEE YOUR FACE
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU

I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU
I DON'T NEED, I DON'T NEED TO DO THIS TONIGHT
I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM YOU
I DON'T NEED,I DON'T NEED THIS SHIT IN MY LIFE
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU

[GUITAR SOLO]

I WANNA STRANGLE YOU
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU
I WANNA STRANGLE YOU
