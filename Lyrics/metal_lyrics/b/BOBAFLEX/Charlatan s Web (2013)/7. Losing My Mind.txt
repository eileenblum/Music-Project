I'M ON A DOWNWARD SPIRAL
CONFUSED AND DRENCHED IN FEAR
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I DID, OR SAID, OR HOW I GOT HERE

I GUESS THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL
AND THE DRUGS DON'T WORK AT ALL
I'M LOSING MY MIND
I GOT THIS SICKNESS DOWN INSIDE
YOU COULDN'T REACH ME IF YA TRIED
I'M LOSING MY MIND

THE VOICES SCREAMING AT ME
THE PICTURE'S SO UNCLEAR
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I DID, OR SAID, OR HOW I GOT HERE

I GUESS THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL
AND THE DRUGS DON'T WORK AT ALL
I'M LOSING MY MIND
I GOT THIS SICKNESS DOWN INSIDE
YOU COULDN'T REACH ME IF YA TRIED
I'M LOSING MY MIND

BEWARE OF DREAMING
BECAUSE IT IS MISLEADING
NO WHERE TO GO
WHEN YOU HAVE NO HOPE
DON'T DRIFT TO SEA NOW
IN SHARK INFESTED WATERS
DON'T FALL TO FAR
STARING AT THE STARS

I GUESS THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL
AND THE DRUGS DON'T WORK AT ALL
I'M LOSING MY MIND
I GOT THIS SICKNESS DOWN INSIDE
YOU COULDN'T REACH ME IF YA TRIED
I'M LOSING MY MIND
