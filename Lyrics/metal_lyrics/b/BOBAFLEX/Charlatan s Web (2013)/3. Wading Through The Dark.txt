DID YOU FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDICATION ON THE TABLE
THE DOCTOR SAID ANOTHER EPISODE IS BURNING IN YOUR EYES

I CAN FEEL IT COMING LIKE THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD ON MY SHOULDERS (FALLING DOWN AGAIN)

YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU ON YOUR OWN WADING THROUGH THE DARK
DON'T YA CRY IN THE NIGHT CAUSE I'LL BE THERE SOON TO HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS
YOU SAY PLEASE STAY THINGS WILL GET BETTER JUST KEEP LOOKING ON THE BRIGHT-SIDE
BABY YOU'RE CRAZY I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER SAID I WISH I NEVER MET HE
BUT I CAN'T GET HER OUT IF MY HEAD

I STILL REGRET THE DAY YOUR FAMILY CAME TO SIGN THE PAPERS
NEVER FORGET THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT ME BEFORE YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES

I CAN FEEL IT COMING LIKE THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD ON MY SHOULDERS( FALLING DOWN AGAIN)

YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU ON YOUR OWN WADING THROUGH THE DARK
DON'T YA CRY IN THE NIGHT CAUSE I'LL BE THERE SOON TO HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS
YOU SAY PLEASE STAY THINGS WILL GET BETTER JUST KEEP LOOKING ON THE BRIGHT-SIDE
BABY YOU'RE CRAZY I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER SAID I WISH I NEVER MET HE
BUT I CAN'T GET HER OUT IF MY HEAD

YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU ON YOUR OWN WADING THROUGH THE DARK
DON'T YA CRY IN THE NIGHT CAUSE I'LL BE THERE SOON TO HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS
YOU SAY PLEASE STAY THINGS WILL GET BETTER JUST KEEP LOOKING ON THE BRIGHT-SIDE
BABY YOU'RE CRAZY I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER SAID I WISH I NEVER MET HE
BUT I CAN'T GET HER OUT IF MY HEAD
