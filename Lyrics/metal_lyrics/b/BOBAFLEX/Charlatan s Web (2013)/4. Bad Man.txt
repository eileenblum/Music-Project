SOMETHING ABOUT YA SAYS YA WANNA
BUT, COULD I MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE
NO YOU DON'T WANT NO LITTLE ANGEL
CLAIMING THE DEVILS MORE YOUR STYLE

I CAN SNAP MY FINGERS TURN YOUR GLASS HOUSE INTO SAND
EXORCISE YOUR DEMONS WITH THE BACK OF MY HAND
SHELL-SHOCKED EYES AND PARALYZED YOU'LL FINALLY UNDERSTAND
THAT I'M A BAD, BAD MAN

YES I AM

I MAKE THE MOUNTAINS SHAKE AND TREMBLE
AND OCEANS PART WHEN I WALK BY
SO DON'T YOU LOOK IN MY DIRECTION
AND KEEP YOUR LADY BY YOUR SIDE

I CAN SNAP MY FINGERS TURN YOUR GLASS HOUSE INTO SAND
EXORCISE YOUR DEMONS WITH THE BACK OF MY HAND
SHELL-SHOCKED EYES AND PARALYZED YOU'LL FINALLY UNDERSTAND
THAT I'M A BAD, BAD MAN

YES I AM

I CAN SNAP MY FINGERS TURN YOUR GLASS HOUSE INTO SAND
EXORCISE YOUR DEMONS WITH THE BACK OF MY HAND
SHELL-SHOCKED EYES AND PARALYZED YOU'LL FINALLY UNDERSTAND

THAT I'M A BAD, BAD MAN

THAT I'M A BAD, BAD MAN

YES I AM
