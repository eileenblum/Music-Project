IT'S HUMAN NATURE
SUCH A WONDERING EYE
I SHOULD'VE PLAYED YA
INSTEAD I MADE YOU MINE
LITTLE ANGEL ON THE DARKER SIDE
YOU THINK YOU OWN ME
YOU MUST BE OUTTA YOUR MIND

I CAN'T GET OVER ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SAID AND DONE
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I'D RUN

AND I AIN'T NEVER COMING BACK
I GOTTA MILLION REASONS WHY
MY TRAIN IS COMING OFF THE TRACK
AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO SAY GOOD BYE

DEVIL WOMAN
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOUR KIND
I WAS SO LONELY I THOUGHT YOU'D CHANGE IN TIME
SWEET DESTROYER A FIRE IN YOUR EYES
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME
HOW COULD I BE SO BLIND

I CAN'T GET OVER ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE SAID AND DONE
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN I'D RUN

AND I AIN'T NEVER COMING BACK
I GOTTA MILLION REASONS WHY
MY TRAIN IS COMING OFF THE TRACK
AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO SAY GOOD BYE

I USED TO SAY IT WILL BE ALRIGHT
BUT I CAN'T SAY THOSE THINGS TONIGHT
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE ON YOUR OWN
IN THE END WE TURN TO STONE

AND I AIN'T NEVER COMING BACK
I GOTTA MILLION REASONS WHY
MY TRAIN IS COMING OFF THE TRACK
AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO SAY GOOD BYE

I USED TO SAY IT WILL BE ALRIGHT
BUT I CAN'T SAY THOSE THINGS TONIGHT
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE ON YOUR OWN
IN THE END WE TURN TO STONE
