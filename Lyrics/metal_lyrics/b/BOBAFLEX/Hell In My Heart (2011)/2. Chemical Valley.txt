I've got a job in the furnace of hell
Down by the river where the rednecks dwell
I'm making money and the scenery's fine
but I'm waiting for something, that something I never can find
Power plants help the cancer to spread
With medicine that they sell to the dead
Through the needle gonna fall in love
Cause this feeling I'm feeling,
It's heaven,
It's heaven on earth
Gonna get so high and never come down
Until I'm six feet under ground
I lost my mind down in Chemical valley
I lost my dreams and everyone one I know
I can't survive down in chemical valley
If I don't leave this place I'm gonna die
Against the law cause I robbed all my friends
I'm nodding off right in front of my kids
Left my family cause I'm out of control
Cause this demon in screaming and eating my life and my soul
Slipping out like a rat in the trash
I'm skin and bones and my teeth turned black
I asked my mother "Can I get it all back"
She said "Son your alone, It's just you and the Devil tonight"
Gonna get so high and never come down
Until I'm six feet under ground
I lost my mind down in Chemical valley
I lost my dreams and everyone one I know
I can't survive down in chemical valley
If I don't leave this place I'm gonna die
I'm just a country boy who's looking for a thrill
A way to pass the time I found it in a pill
And when the magic died I opened up my veins
I turned on everyone my life went down the drain
Oh no, Help me find my way
