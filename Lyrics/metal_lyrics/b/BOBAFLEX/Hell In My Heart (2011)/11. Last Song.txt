This is our last song
So everybody sing along
La la la la la la la la la
And we can't stay too long
Cause we gonna keep moving on
La la la la la la la LA LA

It's complicated when your underground
And we don't like your sound
And your time is running out
You need to dress like all the other bands
Forget about your fans cause their hearts are filled with doubt

They say we're beating on a dead horse
And our luck has all run out but baby...

We can be on top of the world again if you don't think it's been too long

This is our last song
So everybody sing along
La la la la la la la la la
And we can't stay too long
Cause we gonna keep moving on
La la la la la la la la la

And all the labels aren't so friendly now they put your single down and say
That time is running out
You need to sound like all the other bands forget about your fans cause
Their hearts are filled with doubt

They say we're beating a dead horse
And our luck has all run out but baby...

It's plain to see all the sacrifices they have made now
It's up to me and I am that strong

This is our last song
So everybody sing along
La la la la la la la la la
And we can't stay too long
Cause we gonna keep moving on
La la la la la la la la la

This is our last song
So everybody sing along
La la la la la la la la la
And we can't stay too long
Cause we gonna keep moving on
La la la la la la la la la

This is our last song
So everybody sing along
La la la la la la la la la
And we can't stay too long
Cause we gonna keep moving on
La la la la la la la la la

La La la la la la la la la
La La la la la la la la la
