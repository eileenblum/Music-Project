There's something wrong with me
I feel the fever taking over
You're like a bad disease
And every day keep getting stronger
You'll be the death of me
If I can't break this spell I'm under
A love sick tragedy
And I can't take it any longer
I can't take it any longer
She's not a woman she's a Vampire
Drained me dry
She ain't my lover she's a blood suckin' leave nothin'
She's not a woman she's a Vampire
Drained me dry
She ain't my lover she's a blood suckin' leave nothin'
Oh No
Won't you save my soul
Oh No
What the hell is wrong with me
I feel the fever taking over
You're like a bad disease
And every day keep getting stronger
You'll be the death of me

If I can't break this spell I'm under
A love sick tragedy
And I can't take it any longer
I can't take it any longer
She's not a woman she's a Vampire
Drained me dry
She ain't my lover she's a blood suckin' leave nothin'
She's not a woman she's a Vampire
Drained me dry
She ain't my lover she's a blood suckin' leave nothin'
Oh No
Won't you save my soul
Oh No
She's not a woman she's a Vampire
Drained me dry
She ain't my lover she's a blood suckin' leave nothin'
She's not a woman she's a Vampire
Drained me dry
She ain't my lover she's a blood suckin' leave nothin'
Oh No
Won't you save my soul
Oh No
