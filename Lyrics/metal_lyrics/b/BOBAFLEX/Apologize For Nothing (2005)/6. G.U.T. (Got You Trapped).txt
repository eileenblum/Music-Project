Here I stand the center of the universe
Red faced boots laced
All my friends are standing way up on the stage
I'm just waiting for the flood

Here I stand the center of the universe
Red faced boots laced
I can see that things are getting out of hand
I'm just waiting for the flood

Got you trapped now
Got you trapped, mother fucker
Got you trapped now
Got you trapped, mother fucker
I am on the Earth
And for the every oath
I am on the Earth
Cause I am king in here

I am the enemy
Crushed by the weight of the world
There's only room for one
It's best you walk away
You are the foolish one
I am the king in here
Act like you've seen it all
You ain't seen nothing yet

Here I stand the center of the universe
Red faced boots laced
All my friends are standing way up on the stage
I can't see anything
I'm just waiting for the mother fucking flood

Got you trapped now
Got you trapped, mother fucker
Got you trapped now
Got you trapped, mother fucker
I am on the Earth
And for the every oath
I am on the Earth
Cause I am king in here

I am the enemy
Crushed by the weight of the world
There's only room for one
It's best you walk away
You are the foolish one
I am the king in here
Act like you've seen it all
You ain't seen nothing yet
