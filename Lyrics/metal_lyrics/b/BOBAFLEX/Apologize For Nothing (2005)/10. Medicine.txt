What would you do without your medicine,
Falling on the floor again,
Looking for the fix you found heaven in
What would you do without your medicine,
Run like a fiend, never
Weaned from the breast, so you fell again

It's the big dark behind you, you can run,
But it always finds you
Reminds you of something that happened so bad in your past
You never want to look back, manifest in bad dreams
Itch starts to scream, medicine numb the gnashing teeth

I must confess these pains in my chest
Disappear when I'm feeding the need
So forget about your questions,
Cause you know where I've been
There's a struggle in the mud
And for now I'm sinking

Sitting in the back room, thinking what might have been
I'm alive, cause I'm taking all my medicine
[x2]

I'm on top of the world and nothing brings me down
[x4]

What's that junk you been shooting in your veins
Young kids do X headed straight for little brains
Pop a bean for me, call it a shame,
Everyone escape, try to get away
Shot from the head, you're the walking dead,
Corpses chasing artificial happiness
Death to the freaks and the fiends that deserved it
I had a get out of hell free card, but I burned it

I must confess these pains in my chest
Disappear when I'm feeding the need
So forget about your questions,
Cause you know where I've been
There's a struggle in the mud
And for now I'm sinking

Sitting in the back room, thinking what might have been
I'm alive, cause I'm taking all my medicine
I'm on top of the world and nothing brings me down

What would you do without your medicine,
Falling on the floor again,
Looking for the fix you found heaven in
What would you do without your medicine,
Run like a fiend, never
Weaned from the breast, so you fell again

Slide down, back to the hole where you feel comfortable

What would you do without your medicine
DIE DIE DIE
[x4]
