Schizophrenic, I admit it
I've trained my whole life for this.
I can do what no other man can do.
I'm not afraid of henchmen, dobermans, laser beams.
Won't you hold on and be strong?

I will rescue you
From this mistake that you made in your past.
I will come for you
Crashed through the skylight and make the escape.
Show me the way to your soul
A place they can never find us.
Tonight I have sinned for your love, and now we must walk
Through the blood.

I turn the lights out
I move inside now
I cause confusion
I am the prowler
and in the violence, my weapon's silent.
An apparition who walks through gunfire.
Outside the fortress,
I planned my entrance.
It was his palace,
It was your prison.

I have dreamed it, men are screaming
There's chaos in the ballroom.
The guards outside your door have fallen to the floor.
Don't be afraid of me.
I've come to set you free.
Don't be afraid of me, I came to take you away.

I will rescue you
From this mistake that you made in your past.
I will come for you
Crashed through the skylight and make the escape.
Show me the way to your soul
A place they can never find us.
Tonight I have sinned for your love, and now we must walk
Through the blood

Throughout the blackout
I strike his men down
I use the darkness
I am the prowler
And as I swan dive, I let my blades fly.
An urban legend who walks through gunfire,
I know your sorrow,
I know he raped you, but by tomorrow I'll be your savior.
And should it feel just like a dream
slow motion, emotion from me.
Is it you? Is it me?
But when I see your face

I will rescue you
From this mistake that you made in your past.
I will come for you
Crashed through the skylight and make the escape.
