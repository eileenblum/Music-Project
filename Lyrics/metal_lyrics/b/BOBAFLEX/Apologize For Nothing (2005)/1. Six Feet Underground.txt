Yeah, you always riding me
Yeah, you always driving me
Six feet under ground
Yeah, you always riding me
Yeah, you always driving me
Six feet under ground

Am I insane 'cause I make the same fuckin' mistakes
I say I'll change but I've got the same look on my face
Let me explain, I'm ashamed and I'm sorry again
You know how sorry I am

Let's do it
Didn't mean to be so high
Didn't mean to be so high
I told a lie again, I told a lie again
You know I'm high again, you know I'm high again
I didn't mean to be so....

Yeah, you always riding me
Yeah, you always driving me
Six feet under ground
Yeah, you always riding me
Yeah, you always driving me
Six feet under ground

Hey you, it's always someone else's fault
Hey you, it's always someone else's fault

I don't think you understand
I don't think you understand
I don't think you understand
You never could change me
You never could make me
It's always the same thing

Hey you, it's always someone else's fault
Hey you, it's always someone else's fault

Yeah, you always riding me
Yeah, you always driving me
Six feet under ground
Yeah, you always riding me
Yeah, you always driving me
Six feet under ground

You're always bringing me down
