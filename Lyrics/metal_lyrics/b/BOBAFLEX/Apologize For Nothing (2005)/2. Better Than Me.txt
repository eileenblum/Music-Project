So what I've been with a prostitute
I've been on meth for a week or two
There's a teenage girl, she's fucking high on drugs
I think she's driving my truck

I don't care, I live the way I wanna
I don't care, I live the way I wanna

Here we go around and round
You think you're better than me, you think you're better than me
Here we go around and round
You think you're better than me, you think you're better?

One day they'll lay me down to rest
'til then I'll answer to myself
I'm from another world, you know I'm not a man
I'm a beast I'm a beast I'm a beast yeah

I don't care, I live the way I wanna
I don't care, I live the way I wanna

Here we go around and round
You think you're better than me, you think you're better than me
Here we go around and round
You think you're better than me, you think you're better?

I apologize for nothing
While you just sit there and wonder why
I apologize for nothing
While you just sit there and wonder why

All out, I'm black, we are nothing
All out, I'm black, we are nothing

Here we go around and round
You think you're better than me, you think you're better than me
Here we go around and round
You think you're better than me, you think you're better?
