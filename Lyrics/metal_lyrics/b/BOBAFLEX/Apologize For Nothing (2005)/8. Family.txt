Mother was a caterpillar
You should have seen her cocoon
But wait theres much much more
She'll be breaking out in time
She'll be different too
More powerful than before
Now she's got dragon wings
And she hunts and eats human beings
But I love her anyways because she's my ma

They're all part of my family
You can't break our unity
They're all part of my family
You can't break our unity

My brother has no physical form
He is just, pure thought
He dances in your mind
We speak through through telepathy

Unless he gets the attention he needs

They're all part of my family
You can't break our unity
They're all part of my family
You can't break our unity
Their strange
But we share the same blood
No matter where you run
Don't forget where you come from

Father was a shape shifter
He used to play tricks on us kid
By hiding under beds
And I know whats on his face
Because its on my mind
Those eyes of burning red
And the devil stands in front of me
Cause I guess that's what I want to see
But I love him anyways cause he's my pa

They're all part of my family
You can't break our unity
They're all part of my family
You can't break our unity
Their strange
But we share the same blood
No matter where you run
Don't forget where you come from
