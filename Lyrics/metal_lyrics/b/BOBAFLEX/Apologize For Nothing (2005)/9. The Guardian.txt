When you're in outer space no one can you scream
Face to face to with a higher being
I wipe my eyes is this is a dream?
Touch me with electric hands and it screamed

Feel me
Take my energy
Now you are the guardian
Now you are the guardian
On your own

I start to change now
Hey yeah
I start to change
Hey yeah
I'm not the same now
Hey yeah
I'm not the same now
Hey yeah

Feel me
Take my energy
Feel me
Take my energy

Now I am the guardian
Now I am the guardian
On my own

I can feel it in my brain
I can feel it through my veins
I can feel it in your pain
[x2]

Now I feel like I am a god
I feel I like I am a god

start to change now
Hey yeah
I start to change
Hey yeah
I'm not the same now
Hey yeah
I'm not the same now
Hey yeah

Feel me
Take my energy
Feel me
Take my energy

Now I am the guardian
Now I am the guardian
Now I feel like I am a god
I feel I like I am a god
