[Verse 1]
Ill like a birth defect, press select for the blue's dog 
I'm the direct descendent of Desade,  
control freaks act like God 
Detached from the species,  
I sling demon feces, a beastie learns from 
what he sees Forever night time, 
it's high time, I got mine
I spread through the crowds mind, 
like evil through mankind 
90's was crazy, mothers suffocate  
babies, Jeffrey Dahmer, the 
uni-bomber Devil's children stomp 
through the streets, like an
At-at Walker Advice from the life hater, 
You want to save the country,
kill all the teenagers

[Chorus]
Turn the heat up 
Turn the fuckin' heat up 

[Verse 2]
I smoke like Richard Pryors afro on fire 
I gets Motley hot, my pentagram is live wired 
I'm a liar, I'm a cheat, I'm a filthy handed thief 
Fuck you life and fuck your beliefs 
I'm the dragon, breathe fire, stay pissed like the Kraken 
So raise your fist if your pissed about my song 
Look to the sky and you'll see God is gone 

[Repeat Chorus]
(Ha Ha)
