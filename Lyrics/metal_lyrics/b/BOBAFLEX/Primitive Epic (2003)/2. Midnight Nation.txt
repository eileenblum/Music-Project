On that day your mama would cry 
On that day your father would die 
And on that day when you lost your mind 
This is what it sounds like 
(Ohh No No) 
It's not real 
What's that sound 

[Verse]
I know you've been alone 
I can see your bad dreams in the seams of your pillow 
Friendly faces change to strangers 
Familiar places seem like mazes 
There is something on the phone 
It wants to talk and it knows your home 
You can't stop from floating backwards 
What's this force that distorts my world 
Let me out [8 x's] 
Where am I 

[Chorus]
Midnight Nation 
Hallucination 
No escape from Midnight Nation 

[Verse]
Now you see deformed faces in crowds 
Stitched closed eyes and chins with no mouths 
World in between what is and should not be 
Peers speak to people that you cannot see 
You read the bible but the content had changed 
It's a map that leaves hell, the doorway is pain 
I'm in your mind cackling and laughing 
I whisper dark thoughts in the brains of madmen 
Let me out [8 x's]
Where am I 

[Repeat Chorus]

Raw from a loss now the world has changed Am I insane or dead [2 x's]
What ya say Let me out
