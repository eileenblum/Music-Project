What would you do without your medicine,  
falling on the floor again,  
looking for the fix you found heaven in 
What would you do without your medicine,  
run like a fiend, never  
weaned from the breast, so you fell again 

[Verse]
It's the big dark behind you, you can run,  
but it always finds you 
Reminds you of something that happened so bad in your past 
You never want to look back, manifest in bad dreams
Itch starts to scream, medicine numb the gnashing teeth 

[Chorus]
I must confess these pains in my chest disappear when I'm feeding the  need 
So forget about your questions, 
cause you know where I've been 
There's a struggle in the mud and for now I'm sinking 
Sitting in the back room, thinking what might have been 
I'm alive, cause I'm taking all my medicine 
I'm on top of the world and nothing brings me down 

[Verse 2]
What's that junk you been shooting in your veins 
Young kids do X headed straight for little brains 
Pop a bean for me, call it a shame, 
everyone escape, try to get away 
Shot from the head, you're the walking dead,  
corpses chasing artificial happiness 
Death to the freaks and the fiends that deserved it 
I had a get out of hell free card, but I burned it 

[Repeat Chorus]
Slide down, back to the hole where you feel comfortable 
What would you do without your medicine
