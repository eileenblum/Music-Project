Left for dead, when you struck me down 
another one, crushed under your crown 
But my heart still beats from underground 
In this abyss, my technique becomes sound 

[Chorus]
What kind of man do you think I am 
Unfold, diabolical plan 
What kind of man do you think I am 
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust 
But I return like the prodigal son 
And I will rise again in time, cause  
I am champion 
Rise again 

[Verse 2]
I've been biding my time, just watching and waiting 
To strike from the darkness, when you are most lax 
Your reign ends here 
A nameless one that will bring your doom 
My return is now in full bloom 
A ghost from the past, who has to come back to 
reclaim his place with a mask on his face 

[Repeat Chorus]
Strike in the night and you leave like a dream 
You cannot kill what you cannot see 
A legend from far away will come to ask the question,  
"Who is the Champion?" 
Champion, where will he lead from here
