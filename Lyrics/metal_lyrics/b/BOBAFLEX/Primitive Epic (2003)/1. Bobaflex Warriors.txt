The elders of the world will never understand the 
new humans Their way is nonviolent 
They're passive They need protection 
and that's where you come in
For there will be a war, it's inevitable 
And at this time, I need you all to be 
prepared for the worst 
(hu-hail) My soldiers 

[CHORUS X4)]
Bobaflex warriors throw up your blasters 
(kapow-pow) 
New Humans on a march 

[Verse ]
Shave your heads and forget God and family 
Define the self through logic and worship knowledge 
Symbol of a brave face placed against a void 
Many begin to follow it and dinosaurs grow paranoid 
Science fiction band and a strong song 
It was simple propaganda to connect with the new humans 
The powers that be would now see them as a threat 
So he called upon his followers and this is what he said 
(Ah Ah) would you die for this 
(Ah Ah) a better life than this 
(Ah-Ah) Are you my solider till the end 
(Ah- Ah) I scream to the world 
Bow Your Heads 

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
A leader will rise from the east who speaks of a new breed 
A seed in the imagination of a generation 
New humans inherit the earth 
They are the masters 
Protected by Bobaflex 
All throw your blasters 
(hu- hail) 
Now if you see that Bobaflex band 
Fill them full of lead and make sure their all dead 
Within the album hides a code 
To seduce the youth for new human goals 
The leader is inside myself and I control the rise and fall 
Open up your mind and scream defiance in the name 

[Chorus]
