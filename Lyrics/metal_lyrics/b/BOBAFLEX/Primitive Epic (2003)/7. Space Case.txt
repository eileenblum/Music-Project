When I was young, I was labeled a space case 
So I'd crawl inside my head and I'd find me a safe place 
You don't know how it feels, if ya'll need me,  
I'll be out in left field 

[Verse 1]
When I was young, I went unsung,  
I tried to fit in but the world wouldn't 
give in I kept spitting imagination,
frustration builds, desperation kills
Master equip me with the skills I need to fulfill 

[Chorus]
I need your guidance, I won't be defiant 
Gift goes unnoticed, unless you stay focused 
I will go stronger, will never wonder 
This is the path that I've chosen to take till the end 
When I was young I was labeled a space case 
So I'd crawl inside my head and I'd find me a safe place 
You don't know how it feels, if ya'll need me,  
I'll be out in left field 
You don't know how it feels 

[Verse 2]
Silent one in the back, they thought he was slow 
This child contains a universe, the world may never know 
A thinker, his mind actually moved faster 
He was able to move the masses with enhanced mental factors 

[Repeat Chorus]
You like to think that you can escape, 
but precious is the time that you 
waste When you're running from your destiny
made ya, my mind ripped,
but I remember your face
