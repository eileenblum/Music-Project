Warning, warning 
the planet earth is under attack 
run for your fucking lives 

[Verse]
Now, now begins the invasion 
Stay in attack formation 
Blast every human in your sights 
Rape this planet for its life 

[Chorus]
I am the conqueror of your species 
Doomwalker, of the galaxy 
I will Destroy [4x]
I am from another planet 
You will never understand it 
We are a race that likes to acquire things 

[Verse]
Alien warlords come through a space warp 
They swarm the cities and man is a refugee 
Last chance, five pilots, stealth fighters 
Armed with nukes to shoot the mother ship down 

[2nd Chorus]
Fight! Are you ready to fight? 
Die! Are you ready to die? 
Here they come now! 
Rape this planet for its life 

[Repeat 1st chorus]

[Outro]
I can see your face in the clouds 
So we moved deep, under the ground
