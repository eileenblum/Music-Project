[Verse 1]
As a young fool, he'd sling molecule 
Made his pickup down south, took this club-kid trick 
He thought she side-kicked for Molly, she partied 
But her heart was real, he'd find out that night 
When this pig pulled them with enough  
MDMA to be put away for life 
No way, how could this happen today 
She said, "It's gonna work out today" 
"Let's go home, now. Open your eyes,  
I did it for us, the feeling is 
mutual,  right?"

[Chorus]
Baby we'll be fine, as God is my witness,  
as God is my witness, we can 
get  through anything
Cause I shared my love, shared my skin,  
endless in this predicament 

[Verse 2]
Laughing the cop made his arrest he 
pulled her man from the car 
She saw sweaty pig glance at her breast 
She said, "I'll make a deal with you,  
I'll have sex with you" 
"I'll do anything you ask, if you let the  
love of my life go free tonight" 
No way, how did this happen today 
She said, "It's going to work out Okay." 

[Repeat Chorus]
