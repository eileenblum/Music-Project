I was born yesterday, 300 years ago 
And there ain't no explanation  
for this situation that I'm in 
And I don't want to live forever,  
that's just the way it's always been 
All of the children I've had in my life, 
I've watched them grow up and  
grow old and then die
And my wives, Oh how I've missed my wives 
Why won't the angels come take me away 

[Chorus]
Tears drip, cause a quiver in your lip 
When I remember the people that I've left behind 
Tears drip, cause a quiver in your lip 
When I remember the reason that I'm still alive 

I am ever human being 
It's this curse, It's this gift, It's the blood,  
It's the blood And I am the chosen one 
I am the chose one 

[Repeat Chorus]
This can't go on forever (forever) 
This can't go on forever 
Somebody take me away 
Somebody take me away 

[Repeat Chorus]
[Repeat Verse 2]
