What was it like 
I know you crushed the boy I seen it all go down 

[Verse]
Eye of the hawk No time to blink No time to think 
Size up the stock I strike with great strength 
I come from nothing, but I'm looking for something 
It's time to cut the fat and make moves before you lose 
When one comes through His face turns blue 
Dusted like yesterday's news Watch the smoke roll out his shoes 
Never underestimate the heart of the desperate 
The weak dream of pleasures and the strong take the measures 

[Chorus]
We all fight, cry, and laugh (Whose king in the end) 
You are the last one my son (Rise above many men) 
Stand proud Walk loud (You'll know my name) 
You are the last one my son (Checkmate wins the game) 
What was it like What was it like 
They say you crushed 'em, but I don't care about what they say anyway 
What was it like What was it like 
They you crushed 'em, but I don't care about it anyway 

[Verse]
Break, you killed, why did he have to die 
Game, I know, I'm the one that struck the blow 
I know you're mad at me, it was just a business strategy 
Something that had to be, like removing a cavity 
Alive, I sink my mandibles, just like an animal 
Survive, you can eat leaves or feast on beef 
Never underestimate the heart of the desperate 
The weak dream of pleasures and the strong takes the measures 

[Chorus]
