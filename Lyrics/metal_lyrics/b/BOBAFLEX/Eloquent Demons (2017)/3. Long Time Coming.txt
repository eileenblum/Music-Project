Ohhhhh my God...
Ohhhhh my God...

Broke my heart when the sky went black
Guess I should've known that you turned your back
Scream into the heavens
Won't you ease my pain?
You never really cared about us anyway

Been a long time comin'

On the seventh day, I thought I heard him say, "what makes you so special, anyway?"

We're beggin' you to save us
Praise the almighty sadist

We gave you our souls, but it was never enough

What if God don't believe...
What if God don't believe in us?

Ohhhhh my God...
Ohhhhh my God...

Waitin' in line on the afterlife
You were never gonna let us into paradise
Scream into the heavens "we don't understand, why you don't give a damn, never did give a damn!"

It's been a long time comin'

On the seventh day, I thought I heard him say, "what makes you so special, anyway?"

We're beggin' you to save us
Praise the almighty sadist

We gave you our souls, but it was never enough.

What if God don't believe...
What if God don't believe in us?

We've got the unshakable faith
He's got his mysterious ways
Get on your knees and pray

On the seventh day, I thought I heard him say, "what makes you so special, anyway?"

We're beggin' you to save us
Praise the almighty sadist

We gave you our souls, but it was never enough

What if God don't believe...
God says he don't believe in us!

Ohhhh my God...
Ohhhh my God...
