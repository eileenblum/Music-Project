Fill us all full of medication
Sell us everything that we don't need
Keep the volume on the tv up
The Terrified are bowing at your feet

Fly the flag for incarceration
Pay the bill with human currency
Running out of ways to lock us up
The revolution's burning in the Streets

Say what you will
Take what you want
Someday we'll drag you from your throne
You made us believe
That you had a heart
So you could tear our world apart

Let's invade another foreign nation
Gotta feed the hungry war machine
Roll the camera while we blow shit up
Bring the boys back home to rest in peace

All hail to the new world order
Well there's a few of us that disagree
Seems to be a lot of waking up
The sleeping giants grinding down his teeth

Say what you will
Take what you want
Someday we'll drag you from your throne
You made us believe
That you had a heart
So you could tear our world apart

Say what you will
Take what you want
One day we'll drag you from your throne

All hail to the new world order
Well there's a few of us that disagree
Seems to be a lot of waking up

The time has come too
Shut your mouth
And get down on your knees

Say what you will
Take what you want
Someday we'll drag you from your throne
You made us believe
That you had a heart
So you could tear our world apart

Say what you will
Take what you want
Someday we'll drag you from your throne
You made us believe
That you had a heart
So you could tear our world apart
