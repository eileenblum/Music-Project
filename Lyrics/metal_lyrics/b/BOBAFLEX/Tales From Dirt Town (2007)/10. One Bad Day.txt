I've got a smile frozen on my face
Whatever you do, don't look at the pain
For everyone, if you want to survive
Laugh with me now on this carnival ride
The thin line between sanity and madness is the trama of that day
Help me to wash this memory away

All it takes is one bad day
One bad day to drive you crazy
All it takes is one bad day
One bad day to drive you crazy

Memories fade the deeper i go
Applause in my head im the star of the show
A feel from the crowd it makes me laugh out loud
In this abyss im becoming the clown

The thin line between sanity and madness is the trama of that day
Help me to wash this memory away
All it takes is one bad day
One bad day to drive you crazy
All it takes is one bad day
One bad day to drive you crazy

I know tragedy, look how cruel the world can be
All it takes is one bad day
One bad day to drive you crazy

Eerily we long along roll along roll along
Eerily we long along roll along roll along

All it takes is one bad day
One bad day to drive you crazy
All it takes is one bad day
One bad day to drive you crazy

I know tragedy, look how cruel the world can be
All it takes is one bad day
One bad day to drive you crazy

Drive you crazy
