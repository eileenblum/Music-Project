(HA!)
(HA!)
down in the gutter where the light doesn't shine
I beg for crumbs with the rats and the bums.
(HA!)
hear the bastard laughing they say son its over.
(HA!)
you can't stop me but you try

do you ever really think about me?
i have fallen and I fell you doubt me
you say I love you but its your dream she screamed
do you ever really think about me?
I've been through hell, and I'm born again
and i'm gonna keep on tryin
I've been through hell, and I'm born again
I'm gonna get it right this time
I said it's all or nothin for you my friend
and im gonna get it right this time
I've been through hell, and I'm born again, yeah born again

(HA!)
(HA!)

walk through the fire with a smile on my face
it won't be long till I'm out of this place
(HA!)
baptized by the raindrops resurrection makes me stronger.
(HA!)
you can't stop me but you try

do you ever really think about me?
i have fallen and I fell you doubt me
you say I love you but its your dream she screamed
do you ever really think about me?
I've been through hell, and I'm born again
and i'm gonna keep on tryin
I've been through hell, and I'm born again
I'm gonna get it right this time
I said its all or nothin for you my friend
and im gonna get it right this time
I've been through hell, and I'm born again, yeah born again
(HA!)

but to have a happy ending to our story

I've been through hell, and I'm born again
