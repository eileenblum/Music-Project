It's been a long time
And I don't think about the show no more
I wanna go home
I wanna go home

It's been a long time
And I don't think I like the road no more
I wanna go home
I wanna go home

Just relax
And take the red one first
So you can go back to work
The band can go back to work

Just relax
And take the red one first
So you can go back to work
The Band can go back to work

I'm drivin' all night
And I don't know where we were yesterday
Is it time to play?
Which way's the stage?

The crowd was on fire
And I don't recognize a single face
Oh by the way
Can we stay at your place?

Just relax
And take the red one first
So you can go back to work
The Band can go back to work

Just relax
And take the red one first
So you can go back to work
The band can go back to work

I'm outta my mind
And I don't care what the doctors say
I'm not ok
I'm not ok

It's been a long time
And I don't think you love me anymore
Pick up your phone
I wanna go home

Just relax
And take the red one first
So you can go back to work
The band can go back to work

Just relax
And take the red one first
So you can go back to work
The band can go back to work
