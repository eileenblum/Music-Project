Don't you know me I'm a savior 
and its time we discuss behavior 
Don't you know me the messiah 
and its time we set your soul on fire 

I'd like to think that your the only one 
turn your back on my only son 
why did you keep on turnin' me away 
why did you keep on turnin' me away 
and everytime you think you know to much 
your paralized to release my touch 
why did you keep on turnin' me away 
I can keep on turnin you away 
your kind your just a waste of time 
cause I know your kind your just a waste of time 

Don't you know me I'm a savior 
and its time we discuss behavior 
Don't you know me the messiah 
and its time we set your soul on fire 

you try to say your not an open book 
I had another time to take a look 
why did you keep on turnin' me away 
why did you keep on turnin' me away 
your kind your just a waste of time 
yes I know your kind your just a waste of time 
save your time your just a waste of time 
yes I know your kind your just a waste of time 

I remember when you were so young 
you used to care so much 
about everything and everyone 
Yes I remember when she broke your heart 
You didn't call my name no you left it all so easily 
cause you changed now rearranged now 
you seem strange now 
and you don't believe in anyone 
cause it's over yeah it's over 
I'm coming home son 

yes I know your kind your just a waste of time 
yes I know your kind your just a waste of time 
save your time your just a waste of time 
yes I know your kind your just a waste of time
