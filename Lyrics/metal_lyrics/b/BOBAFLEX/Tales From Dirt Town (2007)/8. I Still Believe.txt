Your queen needs your sword again
Will you go, go, go, go?
I can not control the men
It is you they follow

They say weâll surely crumble (Wonât you fight for me?)
The outside walls will tumble (Wonât you fly to me?)
Itâs time to arm the children (Wonât you die for me?)

We watch our city burninâ (And I still believe)
We march into war again
Is there hope, hope? No, no
Iâve been chosen to defend
And itâs you I follow

[chorus]

Iâd give you my advice
I suggest you run and hide
Live to fight another day (To fight for you)
But you've made up your mind
So I will stay here by your side
And we will walk into the flames!

They say weâll surely crumble
The outside walls will tumble
Itâs time to arm the children (Wonât you die for me?)
We watch our city burninâ (And I still believe)
[x3] (And I still believe)

I still believe, I still believe
(And I still believe)
(And I still believe)
(And I still believe)
I still believe
I still believe
