Lookin down the barrel of a muthafuckin gun,
you better get his money or you little band is done.
Law suits label rape are steppin on my lungs,
I pray this album has a hit but I know we ain't got one.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Can't you see I'm on the otherside,
if I could change one thing, It wouldn't be your mind.

[Chorus:]
Sell out! here's my big hit, hope you like it, your all blind
Sell out! it's the same shit, it's the same shit everytime.
I hope you love me love me when this single spins
I know we don't fit in cause i'm not one for trends.

Clingin to a cliff by the tips of my fingernails,
you'll be livin in a van if your new album fails.
Hey Mr. Nickelback can you write a smash for me, he said
son you must learn to sing cause all you do is scream.

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Starin down the barrel of my muthafuckin gun,
you better get my money or your little ass is done
no such thing as royalties so pay me in your blood,
I pull the trigger, burn in hell motherfucker!

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
