You should have never walked away
But now you're comin round again
Manipulate and suck me in
But we could never wash away the sin

I wish I never seen your face
But when I lie awake in bed
My appetite is never fed
And I can't seem to get you outta my head

And what it was you said
I know you made a big mistake
I am the only one that's gonna be with you

Those things you say to me
I am the only one to break your heart
This ain't the time this ain't the place
For bringing back old memories

You got down and on your knees
Beggin please and pushin back on me
I wish I'd never seen your face

But when I lie awake in bed
My appetite is never fed
And I can't seem to get you outta my head

And what it was you said
I am the only one whose is gonna be with you
Those things you say to me
I am the only one to break your heart
