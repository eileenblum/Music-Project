I've got the feeling that they're comin' round the corner
Look around but I don't see anyone
Never leave the house because I know they're watching
When you come in be careful what you say

Peace of mind
I want it the way that it was before

I'm feeling paranoid
I just can't turn off that voice
I didn't have a choice
I know they're out to get me

I can feel it coming down in the morning
Shadow passes in the [?]
I see you with them but I think you're working for them
Haven't slept, I can't trust anyone

Peace of mind
I want it the way that it was before
So... who... are... you 
I can't trust anyone
I'm feeling paranoid
I just can't turn off that voice
I didn't have a choice
I know they're out to get me

I'm feeling paranoid
I just can't turn off that voice
I didn't have a choice
I know they're out to get me

I think I think I think I need my
I think I think I need my head examined
I think I think I think I need my
I think I think I need my head examined

Paraoid, paranoid, paranoid

I'm feeling paraniod
I just can't turn off that voice
