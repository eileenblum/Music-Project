[Bonus Track]

Pretty pretty razors erase the pain can you make it go away?
Youâre a sick girl in a sick world another sick whore. Tell me what itâs all about.
Said he made her, said he raped her, pretty razors will you ever feel again? Iâm so numb now.

I donât wanna die, I donât wanna die, I donât wanna die. Can you save me from this life?
I donât wanna die, I donât wanna die. Can you save me from thisâ¦ 
Lay her down show you love can heal, Bleed it out the carving makes her feel Lay her down show you love can heal, bleed it out the carving makes her feelâ¦â¦

Humiliation, degradation, her destruction she was just a little girl
Black streams run down her cheeks and she screams out to me âI need youâ, Iâm so numb now.

I donât wanna die, I donât wanna die, I donât wanna die. 
Can you save me from this life? 
I donât wanna die I donât wanna die, Can you save me from thisâ¦
Lay her down show you love can heal, Bleed it out the carving makes her feel, Lay her down show you love can heal, Bleed it out the carving makes her feel.... 

Itâs the same as it was I can see it in your eyes, you get what you want and then you leave me to die. 
Donât you hurt yourself my precious, youâre my everything I need you.
Donât you hurt yourself my precious, youâre my everything I need you. Pretty pretty razors erase the pain can you make it go away and change this girl forever. I'm so numb now.
I donât wanna die I donât wanna die I donât wanna die, can you save me from this life?
I donât wanna die I donât wanna die. Can you save me from this... 
Lay her down show you love can heal, bleed it out the carving makes her feel, Lay her down show you love can heal, bleed it out the carving makes her feel.
