Taught me how to live
Taught me how to breathe
Taught me how to love
Taught me how to achieve
Taught me everything I needed to see
It all seemed it was meant to be
It all seemed it was meant to be
Where were you when I prayed the last prayer?

Then everything fell into place
When you saw me as second best
I've seen enough of this world
And all it's cheap offerings
Every step I take is filled with this pain
Given life, given death; it's all one big test

Why don't you ask the dead
How they managed this one
What will be said when you're gone
What made you do what you did?

Reached for your handgun
Lifted to your mouth
You pulled the trigger
And you let life fade away

Reached for your handgun
Lifted to your mouth
You pulled the trigger
And you let life fade away

You let life fade away
You let life fade away

I will have nothing to do with your self-sacrifice.
Now you're dead, how will you be remembered?
