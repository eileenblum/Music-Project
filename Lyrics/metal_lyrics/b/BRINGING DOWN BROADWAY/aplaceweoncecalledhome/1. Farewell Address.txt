Parting hearts, my angered soul
Prayed for this to last, you seemed to know
My love, my heart, my soul
Felt it all through the words you spoke last night.

Dreaming of your touch, your beauty. Sweet tender kiss upon my face.
Dreaming of your touch, your beauty. Sweet tender kiss upon my face.
Upon my face
'Cause your yellow rose will never be the same without you, without you.
The chilling question still stands
Haunting my every thought.
Will you love me, hold me, trust me, stand next to me?

I've never meet anyone quite like you
I've never meet anyone quite like you to say,
Can't stand it to make you feel.
Can't stand it to make you feel.
Can't stand it to make you feel.
Make you feel
Make you feel
