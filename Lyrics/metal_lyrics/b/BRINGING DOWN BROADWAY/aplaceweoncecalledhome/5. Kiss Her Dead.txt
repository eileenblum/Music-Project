Buried six feet under, breathing 'cause you're alive
Sorry for what you said, sorry for what you did.
Enter your casket, your red padded cell
Painted to perfection, these walls were built for you

Death brought life to these eyes
Another world put to ashes
By a love not far from here
Encasing life with fear.

Close your eyes once more and beg for forgiveness
This is an end of a new day.
Shall we pray?
Or shall weâ¦
Let me seal it with a kiss. [8x]

Every little thing, every little thing inside of me. [8x]

Now we will bury you.
Buried six feet under, breathing 'cause you're alive
Sorry for what you said, sorry for what you did.
Enter your casket, your red padded cell
Painted to perfection, these walls were built for you

Death brought life to these eyes
Another world put to ashes
By a love not far from here
Encasing life with fear.

Close your eyes once more, and beg for forgiveness
This is an end of a new day.
Shall we pray?
Or shall we kiss?
