With these words you buy your time, within your heart you lose all hope inside.
With these words you buy your time, within your heart you lose all hope inside.
Bow down, bring yourself to your knees
This is not what you expected
This is not another daydream

So scream your lungs out for me
So scream your lungs out
You're the poison I breathed in
Like a virus you're killing me

Temptation never held me in
Innocence made him stronger again.
A burst of light
Like the moment you could not let go
You could not let go.

All I know is what I hold, looked at me in the eyes for hope.
Left inside this sleepless mind.
All I know is what I hold, looked at me in the eyes for hope.
Left inside this sleepless mind.

The foundation's losing ground.
Slipping down to the water's edge.
Cast me, cast me, cast me away.
Cast me.
