Stake my heart just to watch it bleed
Shadows of my god, I can't succeed.
No one made her this way
I can now see she's out of control.

She's out of control, come take my love, come take my love away from me.
She's out of control, come take my love, come take my love away from me.
She's out of control with her empty thoughts
Letting go of her faith
Holding me to your chest in this beautiful world
Stabbing me out of control.

Like the poem I read to you on your death bed I said
Take my love [8x]
Wrap your arms
Wrap your arms
Wrap your arms
Wrap your arms
Wrap your arms around me
Wrap your arms around me
Wrap your arms around me
Wrap your arms.
Wrap your arms around me
Wrap your arms around me
Wrap your arms around me
Wrap your arms.
