We won't let this,
let this chance slip away,
When we are, we are so far,
and getting, getting closer,
We're cleaning up, and clearing out,
We're growing up, and breaking out,
This time we're going to, were going to clean the floor.
This is our moment, we're going to give it all we got,
It's our time to shine, and nothing is going to stop us now.
Remove your hands from our face, so we can see this eye to eye,
and know that we have nothing to fear.
You are my eternal journey, oh were will it go?
I'm standing at the edge of your shore,
waiting for the tidal wave
to come crashing down.
Carry us away, into your arms,
here we are washing away all our shattered hearts.
Every day I will pray that you would see this thing through.
This is my promise to you:
I'm going to stay true until the end,
with this passion, we're not alone,
it's always burning, internally burning
