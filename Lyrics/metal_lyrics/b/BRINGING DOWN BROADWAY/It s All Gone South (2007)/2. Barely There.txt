Wasting away,
your drifting through life with an attitude,
take a look at yourself,
and all that you have become
pick up your feet, lace up those shoes,
and it's just so simple when you're on a roll,
but have you stopped to think,
that you have no control?
when you're all alone, and on your own,
will it make a difference?
will you even skip a beat?
racing through life in the fast lane, your heart will be beating,
your heart will be bleeding red,
I won't stand by you,
and watch you burn yourself all over again,
tracing your footsteps backwards,
to the place we once called home,
do you remember?
do you even care to try to get it right?
so drag your heels right through the mud,
so that you can say that you've done all that you could,
by a show of hands,
how many of you have never sinned?
Then cast the first stone
I'm standing here,
I'm living proof,
if you just trust in me,
then you may see a beauty
I'm screaming out these words I speak,
Take them to your heart,
or take them to your grave,
because in the end,
everything will slowly change
