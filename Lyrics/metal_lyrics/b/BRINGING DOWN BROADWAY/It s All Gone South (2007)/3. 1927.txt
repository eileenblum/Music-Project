One day Broadway's theater became reality,
when they started killing entertainment,
living in a world of hatred, consumed by the daily papers,
they're crying tears of sorrow, like there's no tomorrow
yet it feels good to bring back the chaos to it's rightful place,
to where it always belonged,
with eyes so red, they're burning, burning red,
in their hearts, in their head,
you're playing with fire, you're playing with the dead
stoning what's left of the purity, this took place down Broadway,
where the boys were born, where the boys will stay,
with an east coast hunger for that west coast fame,
what happened too your love? what happened to your name?
(take a hold of your soul before you give it away)
is this the world we live in? is it the one we've created?
with our two hands... with our own flesh and blood?
those who have come before us,
would be so ashamed to know.
we love our brothers,
but can't stop killing our own
(is this the world we live in?)
I'm feeling lost... I'm feeling used,
father God show me the way home,
give me a sign, drop me the line
I want to be more like you
