Your,
Love,
Is surrounding,
Like,

Never before.

Hopes were high,
Your heart was open,
I saw a glow,
Like never before.
In a moonlight so bright,
I could see your other side,
My palms extended open,
I tried to let you in,
Only to be cut off.
With that glare in your eyes,
I could see night through your lies.
Time after time you still let go,
Seraching to hurt the ones you know.
Was this the right thing to do?
I guess we'll never know you.

We watch as you slipped away,
On our kness we will pray.

Please help us forget you,
We never meant to hurt you.

Dreaming of a life without loss,
Some still yearn to know you.

(Give it a chance you'll see)
(Bring back my memories)

[2X]
You'll remember every face (Give it a chance)
In this world you'll find nothing (Give it a chance)

[3X]
Living life like your walking,
Living life like your dead.
