Where will I rest among the rest of those thieves,
Controlling my words,
Destroying my actions,
Letting emotion harvest our pain,
You only get one chance to turn in right,
Rectify again and I try,
To rectify what I'm feeling
What if I rectify?
With this fist I hold nothing back,
In my heart the torment can't kill what i can't feel,
It's like you took a stroll through my mind,
Keeping all you could find though my mind
It's like a dream come true though my mind
As i lift this glass to you,
Through my faded mind
I'm bleeding on the floor,
I cannot think anymore,
Have you seen this before?
Bodies line the morgue,
Father God where have you been,
I'm sorry for my sin,
I tried to make things right,
What are these feelings for?
I will not let you die again
