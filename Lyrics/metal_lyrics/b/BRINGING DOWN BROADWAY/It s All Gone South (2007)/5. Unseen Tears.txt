Now broken this solid heart.
When anything could've turned the tide,
you were born into my life.
If you had seen the marvels of my time,
if you had seen the world through my eyes,
if you had walked that mile in my shoes.
Would it have been any different
if it was you that lived instead of me?
In search for a face a little familiar,
for you can't rely on the one in front of you,
it's all, all because of your inability,
to see the path you created for me.
It all seems so promising.
Yet this may just be another day,
your wounds in life will always teach you.
Thinking of the world's that you changed,
you'll be living with the choices that you made,
Yet this may just be another day,
your wounds in life will (always) teach you.
