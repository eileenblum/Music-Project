Slithering away from the face of acceptance
Decaying away from lack of sleep
Flowing a path of eternal damnation
These spineless worms will here me speak
Frail minds, fragile hearts born into this world alone
Bound by love, but fueled by deception
Forced to roam this valley of filth
The legions of serpents will march on
Raping this world of love and ambition
Spawning the unclean to create false virtues
Cloaking this world in a blanket of crimson blood
What have we become
Servants to tyrant's children
All doomed to live in a world devoid of salvation
A ritual of destruction shall breakdown the waste
No soul left unbroken, no mind left unstained
Bearer of the curse behold the plains of oblivion
Spineless filth will lay in wake this wasteful kind will know judgment
Every life damned the same
A plague upon all, accept your fate
Embrace the words that I speak
Let the almighty harvest begin this life
Force is broken and cold
On a search to be one with human desire
Searching and searching I can't find the light
I'm losing all reason to keep pushing on
I've turned my back on this rotten world
To watch the cold earth distort beneath my feet
It's only a matter of time before these friends become idles of deception
Flesh of the ancients embodiment of power, awaken and cleanse this dark world
Flesh of the ancients embodiment of power, awaken and cleanse this dark world
None shall escape the cycle that births the garbage of this world
Now the time has come to put an end to false ideals
The curse of life is the curse of want
And so you peer into the fog in hope for answers
The curse of life is the curse of want
And so you peer into the fog in hope for answers
Grit your teeth prepare for the end
Rot away and witness your demise
Leave all you know behind severing all bonds I leave you
to rot this valley of skeletons will mark an era of corruption
Purge away the scum
