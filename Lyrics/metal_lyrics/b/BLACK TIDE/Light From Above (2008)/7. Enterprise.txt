As I watch the fiends they slaughter
I listen to their voices in awe
It's my destiny, death is calling me
I will burn down what is left
They will suffer when I stand
I will summon lives, I will end all life

For those who desire to tyrannize
For those who slay to prevail to live
Ride along my side and we will
For those who live in peace so lifelessly
For those who run and hide from their enemies
I warn you now, you will be called upon
When I am strong enough
When I destroy what left
This is what I await
The enterprise of your demise
The time has come I am ready

I will rule this empire
I shall bring you down, you will fall to misery
As I destroy humanity I sense the glory I once desired
I am blissful within, now it's time for more

For those who desire to tyrannize
For those who slay to prevail to live
Ride along my side and we will
For those who live in peace so lifelessly
For those who run and hide from their enemies
I warn you now, you will be called upon

When I am strong enough
When I destroy what's left
This is what I await
The enterprise of your demise
I'm getting closer to the throne
I'm killing my way through this Hell
I thirst for victory [2x]
