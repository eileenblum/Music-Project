Have you ever felt this way before
Felt this way
Pushed to be someone you don't know
I don't know!
I've never felt this way before
Felt this way
Pushed to be someone I don't know!
People telling lies all the time
Another part of this pointless game
I don't want to be part of your lie
Give me a chance and you'll know
What I want to be
Give me a chance to figure it out
Who I am
I've told you what I have to say
I've told you
You never listened
And you pushed me away
Give me a chance and you'll know
What I want to be
Give me a chance to figure it out
Who I am
Give me a chance and you'll know
What I want to be
Give me a chance to figure it out
Who I am

[Solo (Gabriel)]

Now! Just give me my life back
So! I'm taking it back now
No! You never will take me in vain!
I've told you what I have to say
I've told you
You never listened
And you pushed me away

[Solo (Gabriel)]
