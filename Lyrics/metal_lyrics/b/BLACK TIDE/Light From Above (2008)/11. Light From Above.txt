When the days grow darker
And the foes are full of fear
The light will show
And the enemy will fall
This is our downfall
This is our crusade
The days of struggle and agony
Must end
This warfare we create
We shall destroy
And the light will show
Light from above
Please show yourself and save us all
Bright you must blaze
Your time has come to reign, to shine
Now that things are clear again
The battle must go on
Sacrifice our primal thought
So the battle must end
I've been waiting way, too long
For this day has now shown
We must fight
It's the only way
Light from above
Please show yourself and save us all
Bright you must blaze
Your time has come to reign, to shine
Light from above
Please show yourself and save us all
Fight for your life
Your time has come to reign, to shine

[Solo 1 (Gabriel)]

Light from above
Please show yourself and save us all
Bright you must blaze
Your time has come to reign, to shine
Light from above
