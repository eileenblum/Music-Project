I need to find the light
To shine my way through
I feel so confused
That I might need some help
Lead me to the path
I need to find it anyway
Show me the way
To the fatal world
Show me the way
To the fatal world [2x]
Please show me the way
And I will never complain
It's only a matter of time
Before I go insane
Lead me to the path
I need to find it anyway
Show me the way
To the fatal world
Show me the way
To the fatal world [2x]
If you let me inside
Creation will crash through the sky
A catastrophic misconception of light
Yeah
Show me the way
To the fatal world
Show me the way
To the fatal world [2x]

[Alex solo]

Show me the way
To the fatal world
Show me the way
To the fatal world
This fatal world
