[UK Bonus Track]

Give me your poison
Give me your power to kill
I am the shadow
I will surrender my will

I kept the shadow
I kept the pain
I'll feast upon your venom
You are the black widow

Black Widow
I'm your shadow
Black Widow
I'm your slave

I drink your poison
I took your power to kill
I drink your venom
Now I posses your will

Black Widow
I'm your shadow
Black Widow
I'm your slave

I'm your slave
Yea!

I've fulfilled my destiny
Your venom flows throughout my veins
I'll soon begin my quest for tyranny
I have become you; this evil life insane

Black Widow
I'm your shadow
Black Widow
I'm your slave
