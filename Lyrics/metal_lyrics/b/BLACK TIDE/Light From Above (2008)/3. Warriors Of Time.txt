We are the ones, we are the warriors
We are the ones who fight for our right
We fight alone, and yet we get what we want
We love the battle and we will die for a cause
We are the warriors of time [4x]
And we will fight, 'till the day that we die
And we will live, for the battle and for the people
And they will tell all the stories about the Warriors of time
We are the warriors of time [4x]

[Solo 1 (Gabriel)]

We are the warriors of time [4x]

[Solo 2 (Gabriel)]

The warriors, the warriors, the warriors, of time [4x]

[Solo 3 (Gabriel)]
