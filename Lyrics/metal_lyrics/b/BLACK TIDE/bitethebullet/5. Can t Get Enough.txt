I'm feeling lonely
Like never before
I need your body
Like never before

The feel of your lips makes me loose control
Launching into a dream
I know you love screaming my name all night
But don't try to love me

No one does it better than us
The way we move is glorious

We like to fuck till the sun comes up
Getting high we like it rough
Whole lotta attitude, yea can't get enough
You are my main thing
Love making your body sing
Yea I can't get enough

(I can't get enough)

I feed you these lines and I make you mine
Fill you up with reason
I brake through the ice make you feel alive
Awake all your demons

No one does it better than us
The way we move is glorious

We like to fuck till the sun comes up
Getting high we like it rough
Whole lotta attitude, yea can't get enough
You are my main thing
Love making your body sing
Yea I can't get enough

We like to fuck till the sun comes up
Getting high we like it rough
Whole lotta attitude, yea can't get enough
You are my main thing
Love making your body sing
Yea I can't get enough

We like to fuck till the sun comes up
Getting high we like it rough
Whole lotta attitude, yea can't get enough
You are my main thing
Love making your body sing
Yea I can't get enough

I need your body
Can't get enough
