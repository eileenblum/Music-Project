[feat. Raul N. Garcia]I'm rising up from the dead
My body is aching with hatred

My mind now lingers with malice
Hunting your every weakness

Don't ever count me out
You'll never keep me down
I find strength where there's doubt

You can throw me in the flames
You can pray I fade away
I will rise again
I've looked failure in the face
And I'm simply not afraid
I will rise again

Men down but I'm feeling stronger than ever
I'm cleansed of the filth that delayed my endeavor
I am stronger, I will rise again
I am stronger cleansed of the filth

They say that you really only get one chance
Fuck that Imma hit the second with a vengeance

Don't ever count me out
You'll never keep me down
I find strength where there's doubt

You can throw me in the flames
You can pray I fade away
I will rise again
I've looked failure in the face
And I'm simply not afraid
I will rise again

You can throw me in the flames
You can pray I fade away
I will rise again
I've looked failure in the face
And I'm simply not afraid
I will rise again
