Hey Hey
Hey Hey

Do you miss the life we once had?
Everything thats good has gone bad

Hey Hey

Take a good look in the mirror
Ask the questions that you fear

When its over
Will the emptiness consume us?
Is there closure
Or is there something more?

Hey Hey

Pictured our whole lives together
Shattered dreams, broken forevers

Hey Hey

Take a long look in the mirror
Ask yourself the questions you fear

When its over
Will the emptiness consume us?
Is there closure
Or is there something more?

Yea yea is there more?

Take a long look in the mirror
Ask the questions that you fear

When its over
Will the emptiness consume us?
Is there closure
Or is there something more?

Is there closure
Or is there something more?
