Been in this shit since I was thirteen
Gripping to the life I had foreseen

You set me free

When I go down in this life
Will you be by my side?
And if I'm gone tomorrow
Keep my memories alive

Alive

The vile addictions that raised me
I've seen every thing that there's to see

You set me free

When I go down in this life
Will you be by my side?
And if I'm gone tomorrow
Keep my memories alive [x2]

Alive

You set me free

When I go down in this life
Will you be by my side?
And if I'm gone tomorrow
Keep my memories alive [x2]

I've seen every thing that there's to see
