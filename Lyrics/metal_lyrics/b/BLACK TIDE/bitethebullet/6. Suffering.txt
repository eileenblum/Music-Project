Tell me what its like from behind those bars
Do you dream about her at all?
Does she haunt your mind when the lights go out
And there's nothing left to break the fall?

Guilt has had its way with you
Had no choice but to face the truth

You wake up suffering (suffering)
Asking what might have been (might have been)
Do your time, bite the bullet (suffering)
Do your time, bite the bullet (suffering)

You didn't even wanna go out that night
But your friends convinced you otherwise
You knew she was gonna try to pick a fight
Too many drinks so you rolled the dice

Kept your 45 loaded
All you needed was a motive, she paid for it

Do your time, bite the bullet

Kept your 45 loaded
All you needed was a motive, she paid for it

You wake up suffering (suffering)
Asking what might have been (might have been)
Do your time, bite the bullet (suffering)
Do your time, bite the bullet (suffering)

You wake up suffering (suffering) (suffering)
Asking what might have been (might have been) (might have been)
Do your time, bite the bullet (bite the bullet) (suffering)
Do your time, bite the bullet (bite the bullet) (suffering)
