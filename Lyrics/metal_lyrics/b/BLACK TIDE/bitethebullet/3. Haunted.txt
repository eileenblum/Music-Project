I can't seem to let this one go
Looking in those troubled eyes

Seems I'm addicted to the sorrow
I need to quiet all your cries

I'm the one

Haunted by our mistakes
I'm so consumed by the choices we made my friend
I go back and retrace
Those moments I knew that we both should have walked away

Haunted

I wonder what my life would be like without you
And is it wrong to think that it would be paradise

No need to feel this endless sorrow
No need to quiet all those cries

I'm the one

Haunted by our mistakes
I'm so consumed by the choices we made my friend
I go back and retrace
Those moments I knew that we both should have walked away

Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Haunted [x2]

Haunted by our mistakes
I'm so consumed by the choices we made my friend
I go back and retrace
Those moments I knew that we both should have walked away

Yea haunted by our mistakes
