[Bonus Track]Strained off from the straight and narrow
Latched onto a laughing hollow
Things aren't as perfect as they seem

Trapped inside of a boy's head while
Forced onto a path that crumbles
I've lost the better parts of me

Have you ever felt so lost
Like familiar roads are far away
Have you ever felt so broken, so broken

Yeah, a lot is happening
With a little pain, make it out
Yeah, this inner part of me, stronger
Make our way towards a paradise

So broken
So broken

Don't understand why I'm still here standing
I've come to think I'm the wild boar hanging
Don't care if I'm left here all alone

Forcing me to become the hunter
Dreams break they're lost in the gutter
I'll count all the pieces in my dole

Have you ever felt so lost
Like familiar faces are estranged
Have you ever felt so broken, so broken

Yeah, a lot is happening
With a little pain, make it out
Yeah, this inner part of me, stronger
Make our way towards a paradise

So broken
So broken

Trapped in this corner with a dream
Hell sets in, make reality
It's not over, not over
Seems so simple, I don't want it changed

Stay strong til the flames burn higher
Bet you're ready to toss your reminder
I'll never forget where I come from
Feels like we live in a nightmare
Don't want to wake, just shake off the fear
I'll never look back on what I've done

Have you ever felt so lost
Like familiar roads are far away
Have you ever felt so broken, so broken

Yeah, a lot is happening
With a little pain, make it out
Yeah, this inner part of me, stronger
Make our way towards a paradise

Have you ever felt so lost
Like familiar faces are estranged
Have you ever felt so broken, so broken
