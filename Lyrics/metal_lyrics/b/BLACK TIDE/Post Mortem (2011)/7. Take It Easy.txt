I really need a little time to breathe so slow down don't rush
It's really not as simple as you think
Don't rush something like this, let's take it easy
YEAH

We don't know where we will stand tomorrow
And if all the things we feel will fade, fade away
Though this feels different I don't know how sure I am
I need to take a second cause Iâm, starting to wonder

Where will we be 5 years from now
What will this mean 5 years from now

I really need a little time to breathe so slow down don't rush
It's really not as simple as you think
Don't rush something like this, let's take it easy
YEAH

Life is a gamble so enjoy what you have
I live in the moment cause I don't want to worry
About tomorrow oh oh oh oh were only here once
But you, you got me thinking about, our future

Where will we be 5 years from now
Who will we be 5 years from now

I really need a little time to breathe so slow down don't rush
It's really not as simple as you think
Don't rush something like this, let's take it easy
YEAH
Speeding through me please slow down
We have a lifetime to fulfill our dreams to meet our goals
Please slow down

Take it easy

You're pushing me away yeah you're pushing me away
Cause I don't need to rush and I don't need this mess

I really need a little time to breathe so slow down don't rush
Don't rush, don't rush, don't rush

I really need a little time to breathe so slow down don't rush
It's really not as simple as you think
Don't rush something like this, let's take it easy
YEAH
