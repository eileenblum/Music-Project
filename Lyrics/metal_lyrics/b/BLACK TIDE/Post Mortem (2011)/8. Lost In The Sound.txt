Not everybody has a place to call their home (their home)

They walk this earth with their shoulders down and faded hope (fading hope)

Letâs bring their faith back
Let's make them believe yea what we believe (believe)

We can change this
We can make things alright
Just get lost in the sound hey

Not every kid has got a bed to call their own (their own)

I lay there, think about this and wonder if (wonder if)

We can bring their faith back
Can we make them believe yea what we believe (believe)

We can change this
We can make things alright
Just get lost in the sound hey
We'll change it
We'll make it alright
Just get lost in the sound yea

Hey leave your troubles behind
Get lost in the sound yea

We can change this
We can make things alright
Just get lost in the sound hey
We'll change it
We'll make it alright
Just get lost in the sound yea

(Yea we can change this with a little more time
Weâll make everything alright)
