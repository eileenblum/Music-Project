You are nothing. You have nothing.
You have no heart, no mind of your own.

You roam the streets so proud
I wonder what goes on in your head
Wonder if you've ever thought about
The things that matter most
Not just bout who you know
Or about who you think you are
You should just end this now
Before you get taken out

Iâll let you be my shadow
Iâll let you go the distance
So the world can see youâre a joke

Shouldâve never been so damn vain
Youâll never make it with a fake dream
So run your mouth with a death wish
Walking dead man

Shouldâve never said a damn word
Drove yourself into the gutter
So run your mouth with a death wish
Walking dead man

The stage was just a show
Get back down to earth now
I'm beginning to think you really believed
You were something worthy of fame
The only thing you've got is a crew
Of friends that pity you
Iâve got no pity for a coward

Iâll let you be my shadow
Iâll let you go the distance
So the world can see youâre a joke

Shouldâve never been so damn vain
Youâll never make it with a fake dream
So run your mouth with a death wish
Walking dead man

Shouldâve never said a damn word
Drove yourself into the gutter
So run your mouth a death wish
Walking dead man

You are nothing. You have no one
You have no heart, no mind of your own.

You have no mind of your own

Iâll let you be my shadow
Iâll let you go the distance
Let you travel the world
So you can see what youâre missing
Iâll let you be my shadow

Shouldâve never been so damn vain
Youâll never make it with a fake dream
So run your mouth with a death wish
Walking dead man

Shouldâve never said a damn word
Drove yourself into the gutter
So run your mouth a death wish
Walking dead man
