Take my life cause its already over

Weâre one year closer to the end of it all

Everyday I grow weaker
Wrapped up in the arms of fear
All this painâs taking its toll
Not even gravity can keep me here

Take my life cause its already over
Just bury me just bury me
Take my life cause its already over
Just bury me put me six feet under ground

Weâre one year closer to the end of it all

Every second feels longer
Every minute feels lethal
Every hour screams death
Every day I die slowly

Take my life cause its already over
In my mind in my mind
Take my life cause its already over
My mind is running the thoughts are the same
Take my life cause its already over
Just bury me just bury me
Take my life cause its already over
Just bury me put me six feet under ground

Ground

One foot in the grave
Donât torture me this way
There is no escape

Weâre one year closer

Take my life cause its already over
In my mind in my mind
Take my life cause its already over
My mind is running the thoughts are the same
Take my life cause its already over
Just bury me just bury me
Take my life cause its already over
Just bury me put me six feet under ground

Weâre one year closer to the end of it all
