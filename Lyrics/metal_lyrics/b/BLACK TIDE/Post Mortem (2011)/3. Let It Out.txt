Hey hey yea yea let it out

Donât have to bite your own tongue
Shouldnât keep your mind closed
Gotta let them all know
What youâre capable of

Donât second guess your own heart
Go with what feels right
Gotta let them all know
What you locked up inside

Shouldnât hold on to the things
That wonât let you move on
Shouldnât hold yourself back
Let yourself go

Let it out say what you have to say
Cause itâs not worth the wait let it out
And donât back down donât turn away
No itâs not worth the wait and itâs not worth the pain (so let it out)

Donât wanna look back and think
You could have made things alright
With just one simple line
You chose to keep in your mind

You wanna look back and say
I did the best that I could
Maybe my best wasnât enough
But itâs the thought that counts

Shouldnât hold on to the things
That wonât let you move on
Shouldnât hold yourself back
Let yourself go and

Let it out say what you have to say
Cause itâs not worth the wait let it out
And donât back down donât turn away
No itâs not worth the wait and itâs not worth the pain (let it out)

You wanna look back and say
You wanna look back and feel
I did the best that I could
I did the best that I could

You wanna look back and say
You wanna look back and feel
I am proud of all that I have done

Shouldnât hold on to the things
That wonât let you move on
Shouldnât hold yourself back
Let yourself go

Let it out say what you have to say
Cause itâs not worth the wait let it out
And donât back down donât turn away
No itâs not worth the wait and itâs not worth the pain (let it out)
