[Bonus Track]So put your money where your mouth is
Cause we all know, we all know
Just what there is about you or your friends
You're all just one big mistake

You sit so high above us all, don't you man?
But we all know, we all know
You're no better than us
We're all in this together, oh

So why can't you see?
Or just realize?

Why can't you become part of it?
Why can't you just see the way we see?
Why can't you become part of it?
Why can't you just see the way we see?

You look like you just lost everything
Do you need me to hold your hand?
Stretching your end too much
Was losing the world evenly

So why can't you see?
Or just realize?

Why can't you become part of it?
Why can't you just see the way we see?
Why can't you become part of it?
Why can't you just see the way we see?

We're all sinking in this water
We're all sinking in these waters

We're all sinking in this water (no giving up)
We're all sinking in these waters (no giving up)

We're all sinking in this water
(You're forcing our lungs underneath the ocean)
We're all sinking in these waters
(You're forcing our lungs underneath the ocean)

So why can't you see?
Or just realize?

Why can't you become part of it?
Why can't you just see the way we see?
Why can't you become part of it?
Why can't you just see the way we see?

Why can't you become part of it?
Why can't you just see the way we see?
Why can't you become part of it?
Why can't you just see the way we see?
