I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You'll ramble on bout how I'm that fire

So after all this time youâre still so blind
Thought I was yours you must have gone and lost your mind
I took it all thereâs nothing left now youâre
Showing me where youâre weakest

Youâre so naive

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You'll ramble on bout how I'm that fire
But if you knew how far this is from real
You'd walk away knowing I'm that fire

Nothingâs changed another day has gone
Full of lies I only told you what you want
You've hit the wall and I can tell cause youâre giving into your weakness

Youâre so naive

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You'll ramble on bout how I'm that fire
But if you knew how far this is from real
You'd walk away knowing I'm that fire

Fire

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You'll ramble on bout how I'm that

I tell you all the things you wanna hear
You'll ramble on bout how I'm that fire
But if you knew how far this is from real
You'd walk away knowing I'm that fire

Fire
That fire
