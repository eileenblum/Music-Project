Every night I pray for a dream
That you'll star in
And every night I pray for a
Chance you'll be there when I wake

The truth of it is
Nothing I do
Will bring you back
So I'm waiting for my
Ride up into the sky

And I will meet you there
I will meet you there
Yea I will meet you there
I will meet you there

You left such a strong resonance
Still feel you all around
I know youâre watching over us
Like the angel you'd always been

The truth of it is
Nothing I feel
Will bring you back
So I'm waiting for my
Ride up into the sky

And I will meet you there
I will meet you there
Yea I will meet you there
I will meet you there

I love you with so much more
Than just the heart beating in my chest
I love you with so much more
Than just this heart

The truth of it is
Nothing I feel
Will bring you back
So I'm waiting for my
Ride up into the sky

And I will meet you there
I will meet you there
Yea I will meet you there
I will meet you there
