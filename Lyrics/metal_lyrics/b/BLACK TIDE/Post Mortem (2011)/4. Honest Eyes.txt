Hate
Iâm filled with hate, anger and regret
How did I get so lost?
Fight
Iâll end this fight pull myself out
Save myself at all cost

Give me my, my life back
This oneâs seen its end

How have we come this far?
And why did we survive?
Iâd rather live my life through honest eyes
Where did we go wrong?
And what did we not see?
Iâd rather live my life through honest eyes

Scarred
The things Iâve done have left me scarred
I broke down every wall
Disgrace
A victim of my own disgrace
Iâll rise above it all

It was rightfully mine
This will mark the end

How have we come this far?
And why did we survive?
Iâd rather live my life through honest eyes
Where did we go wrong?
And what did we not see?
Iâd rather live my life through honest eyes

My path is clearer
Through honest eyes
My will is stronger
Through honest eyes

My path is clearer (my path is clearer)
Through honest eyes
My will is stronger (my will is stronger)
Through honest eyes

Iâm taking my, my life back
This oneâs seen its end

How have we come this far?
And why did we survive?
Iâd rather live my life through honest eyes
Where did we go wrong?
And what did we not see?
Iâd rather live my life through honest eyes

Iâd rather live my life through honest eyes
Iâd rather live my life through honest
Life through honest eyes

Iâm taking my, my life back
Iâm taking my, my life back
