[feat. Matt Tuck from Bullet For My Valentine]Try to forget what I did
Guiltâs beginning to settle in
Letâs not pretend that itâs alright
I could not stay to watch us fall apart

I left you behind with nothing, no one
I left myself with these wounds, this pain and now

You are nothing but ashes left of all I once knew
You are no more than a memory burning with the truth

Saved us both from the heartache
Was it so wrong to walk away
You are innocence at its best
I do not deserve what you offer

I left you behind with nothing no one
I left myself with these wounds, this pain and now

You are nothing but ashes left of all I once knew
You are no more than a memory burning with the truth

Nothing but ashes

Oh oh oh

I left you behind with nothing no one
I left myself with these wounds, this pain now, now

You are nothing but ashes left of all I once knew
You are no more than a memory burning
With the truth (Iâd love to forget)
