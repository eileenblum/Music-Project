When you feel the world is above you
When you feel like screaming your lungs out
When you're in the darkness all alone
Don't let it eat you alive
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
A man's got to do what he's got to do
As long as you
Shout, scream your hearts out
Don't let nobody take you down
Where you ain't belong
Shout, scream your hearts out
Don't let nobody take you down
Where you ain't belong

[Solo (Gabriel)]

Why don't you fight for once in your life
Don't want to live your life through someone else's eyes
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
A man's got to do what he's got to do
As long as you
Shout, scream your hearts out
Don't let nobody take you down
Where you ain't belong
Shout, scream your hearts out
Don't let nobody take you down
Where you ain't belong

[Solo 2 (Gabriel)]

Now that I'm here, I'm going to face my fears
Tired of hiding and I'm tired of running
All that was part of me the fear that was in me
I'm strong enough to finally break

[Solo 3 (Gabriel)]

Shout, scream your hearts out
Don't let nobody take you down
Where you ain't belong
Shout, scream your hearts out
Don't let nobody take you down
Where you ain't belong
Shout! It's your time to shout
So shout! It's your time shout!
Yeah
