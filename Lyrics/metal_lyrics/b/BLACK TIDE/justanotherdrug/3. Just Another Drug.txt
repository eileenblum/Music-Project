I'm addicted
So Infected
You reel me in now please never release me
I'd only feel alive when I'm with you

And I will never get enough
Your love is just another drug

And I can't get enough

I'm dependent
So damn helpless
I never thought I would dig my own grave
I only feel alive inside of you

And I will never get enough
Your love is just another drug
And I will never get enough
Your love is always on my mind

If there was one thing I could change
It be the way I feel for you

If there was one thing I could change
It be the way I feel for you
I only feel alive whem I'm with you

And I will never get enough
Your love is just another drug
And I will never get enough
Your love is always on my mind
And nothing sees that I'm stuck this way
I don't know how I make it through each day

Your love is just another drug
