You'll recoil and shudder
As you witness the slaughter
The mutilation of these
Nubile young girls
In a weird and horrendous act
Of ancient rites
Nothing so appalling
In the annuals of horror

More grisly than ever
This Egyptian blood feast
Sacrifice to the goddess
Consumed flesh grants release

You'll gag in utter disgust
As you view of what's served up
At the buffet of blood
All you can eat!
On chef Ramses' menu
You'll find his specialty
His hand-picked choice
Of prime cut meats!

Drink of blood; feast of flesh!
