On a nearly deserted Greek island
Dwells a hideous cannibal freak
Shipwrecked years ago
And left with nothing to eat

In order to live, he had to feast
On what was his only source of meat

He ate on his own wife and child
To guarantee his own survival

Like an anthropophagus beast
He took to their meat
Savoring the taste of their flesh
As he ripped it with his teeth

Now he has a dark desire
A craving for human flesh
And if anyone comes to his place
He'll devour them like the rest

In order to live, he had to feast
On what was his only source of meat

If he catches you, you will die
You'll be consumed so he can survive

Like an anthropophagus beast
He takes to your meat
Savoring the taste of your flesh
As he rips it with his teeth

In order to live, he had to feast
On what was his only source of meat
If he catches you, you will die
You'll be consumed so he can survive

Like an anthropophagus beast
He takes to your meat
Savoring the taste of your flesh
As he rips it with his teeth
