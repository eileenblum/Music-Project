You call me a monster, a cannibal fiend
You never understand my needs
I love the taste of human flesh
I love it raw because that's the best

Raw flesh!

I chop you up, that's how it starts
I take your pieces, separate your parts
On the table, arranged so nice
I serve you up
Sliced and diced!

Sliced and diced!
Looks so nice
Sliced and diced!

You call me crazy, fucking insane!
I just want to feel the same
To enjoy the taste of human skin
Dinner's served, so please dig in
