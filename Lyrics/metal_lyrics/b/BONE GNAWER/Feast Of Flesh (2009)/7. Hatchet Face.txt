Welcome to Crowley's Swamp
Do you think you'll survive?
Down here in the swamps
You'll never come out alive!

Don't you know in these swamps
People come here and die?
The curse of these evil swamps
It will claim you this night!

In the swamps of Hatchetface
Victor Crowley will make you pay!
In the swamps of Hatchetface
You will die this very day!

Can you feel the dread in the air?
You should have never entered here
Those who break all these rules
Will end up as dead-ass fools

He's the beast called Hatchetface
A mutant ghost filled with rage
And once you stepped onto his turf
You'll awaken his killing urge

In the swamps of Hatchetface
Victor Crowley will make you pay!
In the swamps of Hatchetface
You will die this very day!

He's called up from the depths of Hell
Trapped in the night he was killed
He'll kill and kill and kill again!
His onslaught will never end!
