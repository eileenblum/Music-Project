Deep in the depths of the Amazon
Exist descendants of cannibals
A group of savages lost in time
The jungle's secret forgotten tribe
Enslaved by the vile drug lord
And forced to dig in caves
But once the chief's daughter is slaughtered
They'll return to their ancient ways!

When the tribe attacks
You have no place to go
They will capture and tie you up
Line you up in a row
They'll begin their vengeful torture
And you'll be forced to watch
You'll scream in fear and pain
As your partners are torn apart!

Cannibalized! You're eaten alive
They'll cut off a piece of meat
Cannibalized! You're brutalized
You'll be forced to live for weeks

They'll make you die slow (make you die slow)
