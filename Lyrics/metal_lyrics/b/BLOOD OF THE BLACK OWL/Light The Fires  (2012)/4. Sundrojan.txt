Falling apart at the rising sun 
Frozen 
I fall back on soft grass 
Soil and ice 
Looking back 
Raging 
How did you 
Forget ? 
The voice has been 
Torn 
Asunder 
Torn 

I am torn of truth 
Can you look now at the sky ? 
And remember ? 
Remember 
That my heart is bleeding into the world 
How many times do we fight this battle 
Over and over 
Ever onward 
Necessary 

Sundrojan 
I grasp for the earth 
Sundrojan 
I am separate.. 

This part of me that railed 
Was broken 
But sees again ! 
That darkness that bit and clawed 
But the blood was thick ! 
Sundrojan 
But I remember ! 
Remember ! 
I am now the voice and the speaker 
The light and the dusk ! 
Torn 
I am no longer 
Torn ! 
Torn ! 

Sundrojan 
The two are now one ! 
Sundrojan 
Torn asunder ! 
But re-fleshed !
