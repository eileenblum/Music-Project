The unrequited lust for sleep 
Punishment for our 
Waking hours ! 
Cold 
Steel 
Sky 
Of morning.. 

This is when ! 
This is when ! 
We hung people 

Breath deep the freezing air 

Praise the ice! 
In your veins! 

Beat the head against the light ! 

Bastard light of day ! 

Two ravens at the tree line
