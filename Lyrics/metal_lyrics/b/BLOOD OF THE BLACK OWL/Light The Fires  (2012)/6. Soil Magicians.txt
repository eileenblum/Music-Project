I call to thee 
Thank you for the flow 
I offer these words: 

Our heart hails father sky 

soil mother we embrace your womb 
to heal 

We toil within your forests 
We are the sowers and the seed 

We will gift you children

Soil magic ! 

Mother earth, father sky 
Our works are yours ! 
See the trees grow for eternity ! 

Green forests 
Glens and thickets ! 
The great wheel spins 
Above us ! 
And with the waters we flow 
For you ! 
Our mound-ritual 
Soil magic ! 

We are the plant teachers ! 
We toil within your forests! 

Turning the earth, forever!....
