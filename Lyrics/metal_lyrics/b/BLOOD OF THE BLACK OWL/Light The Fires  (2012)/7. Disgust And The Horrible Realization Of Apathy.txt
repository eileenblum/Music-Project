Your bones are ice 
Shattered by words 
Buried by time 
Look in the mirror 
Language reduced 
To dust ! 
Lost and forgotten ! 

Your pillar broken 

Will you reconcile ? 
Abuse ! 
From loss of memory 
Abuse 
From lack 
Of shame 
Can you destroy 
The mirror ? 

Is the risk to great ? 
Lose 
Reduce the mirror 
Shatter 
Absorb reflection 

Your bones are ice 
Shattered by words 
Buried by time 
Look in the mirror 
Language reduced 
To dust ! 
Lost and forgotten ! 

Your image broken ! 

Will you reconcile ? 
Life left to rot ! 
While you slept 
Lives destroyed 
Through 
Selfish 
Denial ! 

Can you destroy 
The mirror ? 
Is the risk to great ? 
Lose ! 
Reduce ! 
The mirror ! 

Shatter ! 

Absorb reflection... 
Absorb !
