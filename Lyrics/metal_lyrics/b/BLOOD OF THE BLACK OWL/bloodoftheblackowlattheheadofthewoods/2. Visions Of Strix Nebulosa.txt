[Vision I]

Sleep now my friend...
Hibernate...
Dream your dreams...
Nestle (hibernate),
Deep in your soil.
Hibernation...
Hibernate,
The snow will fall,
&amp; encrust the ground.
Slopes,
Hills,
Plains covered.
Hibernate...
It covers your trails...
In excistence.
Hibernate,
Let your slumber wander,
Into the forgotten spaces...
Hear silence,
&amp; see without eyes.
Hibernation...
Converse with the ones who left long ago...
Hibernation...
Drink deeply...
Hibernate...
Drink deeply...
Ancestral waters.
Become without age,
Without flesh.
Sleep,
Hibernate,
Sleep,
Now my friend.
Hibernate until the final hours,
And then crawl,
Into the light,
Of your wisdom...

[Vision II]

Awaken...
Awaken...
Awaken...
Awaken...

[Vision III]

...Minutiae...Intolerance...Minutiae...
The ever growing, unrelenting obsessions,
Obsessions.
That keep us scraping in the dark.
For those infinitesimal scraps of light.
To few and far between.
Or not at all
So I eat the moon...
In an effort to digest sleep.
I invite it!
To become my sweat...
Much less blind (Now).
We can sink.
Into bottomless oceans.
With the knowledge of stars and planets,
Beat one with the other.
Exhail the mist of time to animals.
With whom, I now swim and understand...
So I eat the sun...
In an effort to digest thought.
I invite it!
To become my eyes...
The universe is at a loss for words.
Totems... Of paralell worlds and time.
Totems...
Are made as sentinals.
Totems...
Sculptures erected,
In the deepest of waters
Totems...
The psychic web created...
Connected through speech of dreams...
Totems...
Totems...
Totems...
So I eat the moon...
Totems...
In an effort to digest sleep.
I invite it...
Totems...
To become my skin.
Totems...
Totems...
