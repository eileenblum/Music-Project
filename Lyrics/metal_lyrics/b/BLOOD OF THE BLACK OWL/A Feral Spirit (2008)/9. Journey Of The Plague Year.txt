Sky is color if (The) scorched earth...
Forever we shall see...
Unending rows of pits...
Eleven &amp; fourteen...
Mouldering together...
&amp; we shall see thousands more...
We watched the coffins...
Fly in the air...
Landing with spirits...
THERE...
Apparition...
Burning sword in hand...
Directing the pestilence...
Across our land...
Bodies erupt in fever with plague...
Streets silent, as morgues...
HERE END THE DAYS...
Thunderous hammer of death...
Strikes thy knell...
The scourge be alone...
to feast the dis-ease.
