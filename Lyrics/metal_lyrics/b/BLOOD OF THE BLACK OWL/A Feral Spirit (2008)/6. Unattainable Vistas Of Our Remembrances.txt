Floating through vortices...
Into hallucinatory deepening oceans...
Sprawling cities rising before me, before time...
Green pastures turning to grey &amp; blue...
AHHH, to leave the body in frozen worlds...
Of unknown colors...
Squeezing universes...
Until they will certainly BLEED...
Staring into endless star vistas...
Seeing monumental BLACK...
Untold &amp; unseen...
These visions...
Of aeons seething through ME.
