Ghosts now haunt my mind...
Of this, I have no want...
Echoes of past, reminiscence...
(Now) Deceased those realms of dream...
Unrealized &amp; unattained...
My armor, now shadows &amp; time...
Will that weapons finally rust...
Under weight of false lead pride...
Oceans fathoms deep...
Shores to bleach &amp; dry...
Indiscriminately ambivalant...
(Toward) Our scarlet built monuments...
I hope to finally see...
At my death, roads end...
Skulls to pave the road to the future.
