Wreathed and cloaked in mist...
So old, as ancient as the sky...
These mountained lands...
They are the keys to forgotten dreams...
Behold their essences...
And cleanse us of our weaknesses...
I haunt these dark places...
Floating solitary through woods...
The spirits speak my name...
A name known only to them...
Blood to blend with soil and rock...
Trancending hallucinatory river...
I become these climbs...
There is no longer such a thing as "Time"!
These mountained lands...
They are where I dwell...
Disembodied...
Interweaving the beyond.
