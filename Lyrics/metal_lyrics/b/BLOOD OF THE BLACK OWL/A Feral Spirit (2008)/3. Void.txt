Hook the arteries-Inject the plague...
Begin the process of slow death...
It will take a thousand years...
The soul never existed-neither did you...
Fill the void with BLACK!
Forget love, forget hate...
All that is left now is FEAR!
DIE in the burned out corpse-room of FEAR!
Your name is on the wall...
Watch it all rot away...
You have become the cancer...
YOU are the dis-ease...
Pitch black death is all that is left...
FILL THE VOID WITH BLACK!
