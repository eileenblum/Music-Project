At the portal of the forest...
My soul will sink away...
Becoming the trees...
The moss...
This forest of miasmal decrepitude...
Covered by impenetrable fog...
Unseen horrors lurk under it's canopy...
Of twisted &amp; turning...
Decaying branches...
All of this is mine...
My personal mausoleum...
Sprawling woodlands of no life...
My beloved putrescent kingdom...
Miles...
&amp; miles...
&amp; miles...
Of suffocation...
Rot forever &amp; ever...
Under my sickening, dying reign.
