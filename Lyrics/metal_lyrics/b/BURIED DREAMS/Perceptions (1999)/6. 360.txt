If I just could scream and someone listen what I feel. Thought of life just as an end to the place we all descend. Rise beyond the closed gates For your blackened past with no tomorrow. Beyond what nightmares apear in your sleeples life of your subconcious When the line is crossed walking on the edge of what is fantasy. Awake in a dream that has become my life a nightmare without a sense. So the kiss of an angel becomes your last sin and the beast will show you the way. The unreal has invaded. Visions falling far from the sky. Damned voices that speak in my head. I will live in my dreams until you touch my soul of questions with no answers When the line is crossed walking on the edge of what is fantasy. Awake in a dream that has become my life: a nightmare... What is my fate and destiny What do I deserve I am just an unfortuned man staring visions with my face on the water What is my fate and destiny What do I deserve I am just an unfortuned man staring visions with my face on the water If I just could scream and someone listen what I feel. Thought of life just as an end to the place we all descend. Rise beyond the closed gates For your blackened past with no tomorrow. Beyond what nightmares apear in your sleeples life of your subconcious Visions falling far from the sky Damned voices that speak in my head I will live in my dreams until you touch my soul of questions with no answers Like a painting we will vanish as a flower we will dry on earth The sadness lives in the ones who live in it It could be jade, it could be gold you all will go...
