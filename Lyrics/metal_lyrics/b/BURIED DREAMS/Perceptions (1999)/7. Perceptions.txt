Look into yourself a world of nothing you have been... Now perceive the new life. Again the chance to live deep in your mind. You'll recognize your tears once they brought you fears The place you've been brought to never again you'll be the same. Weird live in it for once you lived again fate and destiny have brought you here. A dark sunset, a sweet death, lost perceptions, in me in you, forever! Everlasting senses in your mind welcome to the lost world of perceptions. Can you see the truth? Can you hear the call? Everlasting senses in your mind welcome the lost world of perceptions. Can you feel the power? Will you taste our souls? The last chance beauty madness... All your life has been controled. Llisten to the voice, the scream. Watch tears disapear in your hopes, fading into sounds, sounds of everlasting power. Everlasting senses in your mind welcome to the lost world of perceptions. Can you see the truth? Can you hear the call? Everlasting senses in your mind welcome the lost world of perceptions. Can you feel the power? Will you taste our souls?
