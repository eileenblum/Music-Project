[Lyrics: Valdespino]
[Music: Valdespino]

I think I've been mistaken 
On my phatetic way of being
since that I have
No where to run no where to hide

So now I have to defend myself 
With a special guarantee
My future is expecting
I have to end it all right now

Searching and waiting 
Though all these lost years
There's nothing but
silence-confussion
some pictures-illusions

How can I wait for hope?
when it comes like a rope
to my neck, to my being

Nothing but shapless thoughts
Too much heat inside
Blinded moves, fear of wrath

[Chorus]
So here I stand
Lika a ghost sculped in time
who can be my guide?

Someone in front of my
He knows about my silent destiny
I feel anguish
I'm riding the tomb of the gods

[Solo Ndua]

When the night fall
His shining eyes reinforce
The lip's warm smile

It was an image of that
Secure, peaceful and quitness
Like a beauty extension

The silence, the call have some gloom
Everything is so peacefull
That I feel buried in a sea of stone
The atmosphere is shrinking
But the sun falls
And the moon grows
It's getting cold

[Chorus]

All I can hear are dark symphonies
All I can see is some white light
At the moment I hear a dirge for me
I'm Walking my last steps alive
It's seems I'm sick
Of a pain with no cure

Beyond the fear
Trough loneliness I walk
Holding the stone
With my shrapened teeth

[Solo Tono]

Searching and waiting....

[Solo Ndua]

That's death

Finally I've reached
The land of death surrounds me
By trying
Not Dying

Just about the time I leave
And after all I've said
There's nothing more I care about
but my last will

But at least I have 
the strenght to face it
I give a hand to death
With brightness on my eyes

I feel there's nothing more
inside of me
But I will smile
When I die!!!
