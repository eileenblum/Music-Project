[Lyrics: Olguin]
[Music: Mendoza]

A new path begins
To the point of no return
I find confusion in my mind

There's a batlle inside my head
My soul is fighting to rise 
Retarded my eyes

[Chorus]
Fear
Starting to fall in another force 
Different than mine
Courage
Scareing my spirit in an unknown world
Power
In my strongest alied
Defeat
It's so easy without it

There's images full of dregs
Before my eyes I am the terror climax
Everything is falling in suspense in silence
Without breathing

[Chorus]

My power, inspires me to continue in this cosmos
I look around everything is so fucking strange
Even when... we fall
Upon my shoulders, there's no awakening
Time stands still

I can't touch the fire
Fly over the seas
I can't see what others can
I can feel like running inside of me
For eternity

This eternety
Reallity will no end
I will be here
Waiting for a new being
Able to sacrifice
Anybody can hide
For this is an inside reallity
