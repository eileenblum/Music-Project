[Lyrics: Mendoza]
[Music: Mendoza, Valdespino]

[Mikael Stanne]
Voices beyond the door of indreaming
Whispering in my ears the notes 
Overture for the last ride 
Ancient knowledge is passed to another generation 

Through the feather
Their echoes become immortal in the paper 
Read are their voices
In another sunset further in time . . . 

In the sea of concious
Words will be their guide 
Their fates brought them into these point 
In this labyrinth of phrases 
Their fates will show them the way
To the unknown

[Solo Tono]
[Solo Ndua]

[chorus]
Starting to dream . . . 
I sleep and awake in the world of dreams 
Awake in a common reality, but it is not the same for everyone 
I have to dwell between a permanent and a changing world 
That is driving me to the edge 

To open the doors that cross in my way 
Beyond each a quest to be fulfilled 
To reach the control of that forgotten world
That is left behind, they all denied 

The rays of light that gave birth to the world
Show me the body that hides beyond the cover of the skin

My hand is writing words that I don't even know 
In a foreign language brought to me by a crow
Emissary of the lands far beyond our law
He is the one that possesses the virtue 
for ruling the realms

[Chorus]

Watch my hands to regain the form of the sleeping body
Watch the mist fade away and discover the realms of the infinite sea
Canvas of pictures of my live that changes in a violent motion

To open the doors.... 

[Lead Ndua]
