[Lyrics: Valdespino]
[Music: Valdespino]

"I want to confess 
As honest as I can
But my heart es empty
Turned to my being "

My face causes me fear
I live in a disturbing world
Traped in my dreams and fantasies
I don't want to die

Because I want knowledge
No faith, No Hope, No lies
I don't want to name God 
To some piece of my fear

[Lead Tono &amp; Ndua]

[Bridge]
A challenge against to no-name
For just another piece of time
Too short for a lifetime
Like a sea in a blackened cave

Death has been walking by my side 
For so long, but I still can go
We all have to remember 
That we all are going to die

[Chorus]
Pain
There's a nightmare inside my head
Broken chains, misguided world
But I'm not scared anymore

Death
The joy of death has come to me
I can feel my hunger
But I'm falling again

My ambition lead me
To a lonley life
The end of night is comming
And my time is running out

Knowledge to fullfill my path
Of graving all I can
Simply I don't care if I have to die

I'm disguted to life
To much games to win them all
There was silence in the sky 
When the death open the door

There were angels falling
Upon the dusk of time
Whispering hidden voices
Surrounding the world behind

[Solo Ndua]

There were angels....

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
