Here I am this is where I stand.
I won't become the unappealing ideal of man.

This is your creation. you are blind.
The power of your followers corrupts the ideal image to control your mind.
Life has no answers, only questions that you can't see.

Death holds the solution to rid this monstrosity.
Is there life in your eyes? Who the fuck do you think you are?
Creating these wounds and leaving these scars.

I am the fallen one. Melting minds of the young.
Breaking down the weak. Make the innocent feel defeat.
Never change a thing. Let the madness repeat.

We search for everything and find it all.
What are we looking for? What is it we desire?
Set and destroy the body and mind.

Swinging away into a memory,
can we take it apart leaving the body in two?
Together we breathe, together we fall.
Leave it all to me, it's all my fault.

I'm growing tired and my patience is thin.
Lie there, wallow in your dreams.
Are you listening?
Have you lost sight in your eyes?
Is insanity safe from my mind?
Your past has left you traumatized.
You're weak and helpless.

This is how I feel, it's almost like itâs not fucking real.
Completely separated, altered and recreated.
Into your mind your thoughts will have dissipated.
And now you will do as I say.
Taking care of these demons I lay.
You'll never question me or my authority.
I'll chose who I want to be;
Who I become.

Ingest my words and try to see.
You're in denial of your own disease.
