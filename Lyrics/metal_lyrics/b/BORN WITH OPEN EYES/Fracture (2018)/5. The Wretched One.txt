Restless and fatigued,
the words fall From this heavy tongue
To break this curse.
Another moment,
sixty seconds of sheer frailty.
This sentiment is all too familiar.

And I have you to thank for my jaded perceptions.
âCause you are the reason I live in the darkest chambers
Chambers of my heart.

I saw the evil that was inside.
I smelled the stench of your deception.
I endured each burning embrace.
I tasted the venom upon your lips.

The desolation is all that remains.

I'll tear out your heart as a bitter memory.
As a sign of the disgust that I feel.
As it grows cold, I'll shed a tear.
But the angels will never speak your name.

It's all for you
For you, the wretched one.
And while I watch the light fade from you eyes.
The angels will never speak your name again.
