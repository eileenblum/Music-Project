A life force so vile, we cannot begin to comprehend its power,
its means to an end.
Soon we will all know his name.
His gnarled fingers reaching from beyond the void.
Outstretched to consume us.
This prophet of death has foreseen our demise.
His malice untethered.

The dead will all be exhumed;
His soldiers, his puppets.
All life on this planet will be consumed.

There will be no escaping the obscure power of this being.
Draped in shadows.
All hail this great pariah, cast out by his own.
He is on a conquest to conquer all.
Fear his arrival.

Untold horrors await all humankind.
The world has flourished since the dawn of time,
blind leading the blind.
He will open our eyes to true terror,
when he parts the skies.

This is the end, we will descend,
into the truest form of chaos.
His gnarled fingers reaching from beyond the void.
Outstretched to consume us.
This prophet of death has foreseen our demise.

Any shred of hope will be swiftly stomped out.
There will be no solace to be found here.

Fear his fucking arrival.

There will be no final stand.
Wherever life blooms I seek to destroy it.
Many have suffered by my hand.
And I find bliss knowing humanity will as well.
This is the Eleventh hour.
It has begun.
