Bred into darkness, molded by the absence of light.
Tumbling through the nil like a sphere of black matter,
with a putrid face and with a hellish grin.
Into the farthest depths; A place where no life can live, and only one resides. Through a black hole at the edge of existence,
Only one resides.

Dismembering thoughts from consciousness.
Billions will die burning alive, genocide.
Blacken the sky.
Biding the time until death has arrived.

A grotesque being with malice in its eyes.
Its evil unrivaled, no one will survive.

Raised to defile all those in need, proving old morals are obsolete.

My darkness to be shed upon this world.
Fall to your knees and beg for it will not stop me.
You will suffer by my hands unceasingly.
Fall to your knees and plead for an end.
But it will not, for this is what I do.

Do what thou wilt.
Devour all light from this planet
Do what thou wilt.
Not a glimmer left, the blackness will remain.

Thy hath no compassion.
Only desires, to snuff out life
This insatiable rage.
A thirst for blood that cannot be quelled.
My divine right to crush thee beneath me.
My true strength shall be expelled.

Desolation awaits you all.
From the farthest depths I have come
To revel in the pain of many
To show you the true meaning of power.

Now, tremble before me, for I am here.
There is no stopping me.
I was molded by the absence of light.

Your world will become a mirror image of a darker place.
Absolute hell unleashed.
My hell unleashed.

Screams! I relish the song of your screams.
Bleed! You will all bleed for me.
