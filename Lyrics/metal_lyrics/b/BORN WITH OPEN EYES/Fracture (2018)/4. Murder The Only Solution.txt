Fate cannot be changed.
The natural order has been debauched.
Rules of Mother Nature do not apply.
With every day that passes we will drain the society.

No remorse.
Memories stripped from the mind of the innocent.
No remorse.

Raping everything in existence.
Watching this torn race reduce to nothing.
Feeding off of everything.

This will all come to an end.
Where life begins, life will end.
This whole world will begin to descend.
This will all come to an end.

Religious parasites.
Fermented life in the scripture.
I am your deicide.

No remorse.
Memories stripped from the mind of the innocent.

The final eon has begun.
Life will evolve to omission.
As fate sees you withering, you will know you all have been a waste.
Stripping faith from the heart of everything.
Try and fucking stop me.

Murder is the only solution.
