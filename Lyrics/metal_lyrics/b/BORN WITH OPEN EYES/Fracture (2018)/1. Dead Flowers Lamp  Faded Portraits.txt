The sky turned black as I screamed out your name.
The clouds turned to smoke, blotting out the sun.
The trees began to wither and choke.
Itâs all come crashing down, to the ground.

Once beloved
Now my heart cringes, contorted by your hands.
Once embraced
Now thrown into the shadows, and buried in black.

These dead flowers resemble the touch
Of your wilted skin.
These faded portraits haunt me in my sleep.

I'll dream while I'm awake.
I'll sleep when I, when I am dead.
You took my breath away.
And now I want it back.

You speak in cursive, weaving your lies into the truth.
A slip of the tongue, a quick persuasion.
To corrupt me to watch me crawl.
Drive these rusted nails through my hands
and kiss me one last time.
So you can taste, taste my misery.

These dead flowers and faded portraits
will come back to haunt you.
These dead flowers and faded portraits
are all that's left of you.
