Remove the veil from her face to reveal an ugly truth.
Expose the horrid creature that lurks beneath,
for her divinity breeds contempt.
Feeding on my adornment a glutton for the taste of agony.
Bathing in her own sin and blasphemy.
A small price to pay for a simple caress.

Cloaked in robes of false pretenses.
A witch writhes beneath the hood.
Casting spells of wicked promise.
Staring into the eyes of damnation.

So tarnish this heart I wear on my sleeve.
For it seems to please you, my sweet anathema.

Just like smoke and mirrors.
My hands can't grasp an illusion.
A fiendish figment of my imagination
Is all she ever wanted to be.
Slithering between my fingers.

So fragile in her presence.
Even the most tender of touches, will destroy the senses.
Her radiance has been drained to a cold pale essence,
And replaced with a darkening resplendence.
Addicted to her aura, a sickening dependence.

Constricting my chest, I struggle to breathe.
Stagnant is the passion that once was.
In the wake of the destruction she weaves.

Cold hands creeping up and down my spine.
Molested by her touch.
A feeling that once was welcomed.
Enchanted by this lustful facade.
Scarlet eyes now shine.
From her sunken pale face.
The taste of blood has found its home upon,
Her soft cursed lips.
Endlessly feasting, yet her thirst is far from quenched.
Not a drop left.

So tarnish this heart I wear on my sleeve.
For it seems to please you, my sweet anathema.
