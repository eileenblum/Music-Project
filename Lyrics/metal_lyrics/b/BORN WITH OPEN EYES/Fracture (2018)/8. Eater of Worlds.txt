Because I can. And I'll do it again and again.
Until there's nothing left to kill.
Until they all rot underneath my feet.
Because I can. And I'll do it again and again.
Until there's nothing left.

I am here upon this world I shall clear.
To bring new life, and breed it by fear.

Eyes blinded by the light that gives false hope.
The ground below you, will all turn to grave.

Malevolent by creation to do my daily bidding.
You don't seem to realize your lives are temporary.

But I am infinite, I am everlasting.
I will remain until thy deed is done.
Until all have been vanquished.
I will reign forevermore.

This isn't over until I say it's over.
Pray to your maker.
You will crumble to your knees.
Bone ripped through flesh, until your last breath.
Blood spilled on this world canvas.
Building monuments of decapitation.

Because I can.
Until there's nothing left.
