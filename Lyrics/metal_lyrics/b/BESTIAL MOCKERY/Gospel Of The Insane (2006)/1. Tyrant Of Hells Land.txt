Across the blackened sky
With lightening as their pride
Thunder claps from hooves of might
Apocalyptic Riders are in sight
Upon clouds of Death they ride
Pitch-black steeds side by side
Hooded Horsemen omen of Doom
Wielding scythe bring forth the Gloom
Armageddon drawing close
Evil win and mortals loose
Time to fight and time to die
To make a stand for the glory of the Damned
Lightening strikes and earth it quakes
Clashing fight and body aches
Wield the Banner - Flag of Hate
Fight for Satan - Hell awaits
See the Magus cast their spells
They unleash this force from Hell
See the Demons breaking free
It is you against me
Armageddon now is here
Satan take what mortals fear
Time to fight and time to die
Time to make a stand for the Tyrant of Hells land
