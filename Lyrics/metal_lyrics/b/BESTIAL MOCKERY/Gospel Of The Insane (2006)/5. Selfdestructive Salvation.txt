Hypocritical fools
Lying to yourselves
Why spite the hands that feeds you
Why hurt the ones you love
As an Ouroborous encircling your soul
The downward spiral to Hell
Reaching for salvation
In terms of ecstasy
Can't live with the pain
Can't live without dying
Piece by piece, drop by drop
Selfdestructive salvation
Inhale and exhale
Dancing on a razor
Backstab and betray
Living just to die
Tired of being bored
Bored of yourself
Pissed to be alive
So you slowly fade away
When all hope is lost
And nothing means a thing
You get the final kick
The poison now sets in
Can't live with the pain
Can't live without dying
Piece by piece, breath by breath
Selfdestructive salvation
When the streetlights fades away
Your wings begin to burn
A broken phoenix falling
And you enjoy this ride
The morning after
No phoenix rises
The morning after
All angels cry
The morning after
There is no tomorrow
The morning after
This time you died
No poison can resurrect you
No one can save you now
No hope for salvation
No light beyond all lights
Selfdestructive salvation
The souls pines for rest
But a restless urge awakened
Can't live without the poison
Can't live with the pain
Can't live without dying
Breath by breath, lie by lie
Selfdestructive salvation
As you go down in flames!
