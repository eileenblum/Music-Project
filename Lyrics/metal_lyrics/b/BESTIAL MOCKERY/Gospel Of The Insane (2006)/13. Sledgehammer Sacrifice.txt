Marching through bloodred snow
Barbarians of the evil horde
We crush your skull with ease
Ride into battle for the Lord
I molest my enemies 'til there's nothing left
Wading in blood, I attack the pack
Surrounding death, we are of Hell
Agonized screams and the battlecries yell
Maniac warriors spreading death
I smile as I impaled your skull
Fields of slaughter and the stench of blood
Sledgehammer sacrifice, heads roll
Crushing fucking evil onslaught
I smash your fucking head
We rage forth, without meaning you fought
But now you are fucking dead
Outburned churches with crucified priests
Headless Christians in the Devils feast
The flames won't cease, we ride on to future war
Don't try to stop us, we have opened Hell's door
Maniac warriors spreading death
I smile as I impale your skull
Fields of slaughter and the stench of blood
Sledgehammer sacrifice, heads roll
