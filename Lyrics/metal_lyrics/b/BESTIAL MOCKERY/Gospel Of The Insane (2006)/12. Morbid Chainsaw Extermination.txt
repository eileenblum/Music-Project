War, the final solution
Death is hungry this night
Hate, blacker than ever
With the Horsemen we fight
The final blow
We strike you out
Hell suffering
We taught you right
Total Annihilation
Morbid Chainsaw Extermination
Hell, the gates are open
Behold Satan's revenge
Black, the legions of war
that are slaughtering the souls of light
The final blow
We strike you out
Hell suffering
We taught you right
Total Annihilation
Morbid Chainsaw Extermination
