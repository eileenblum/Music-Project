Armed with a force so divine and strong
We march out for war
To forever destroy beliefs of higher powers
Churches burn and religion falls
From the ashes a stronger race arise
Welded together by lost ideals and mutual hate
A phoenix with an eternal flame
Forever burning so bright and red
Freedom of choice our only belief
Your holy society now turned into shit
Out from the cold, straight to Hell
A chaos fury annihilates the human race
Fuck
When the Final War comes
Everyone shall pay
Pain, suffering, fear and Death
None will escape our Wrath
Gas clouds surrounds our desolate earth
Our goal is near, Armageddon closes in
A shattered world with no more gods
The Final Slaughter, to Hell we ride
Freedom of choice our only belief
Your holy society now turned into shit
Out from the cold, straight to Hell
A chaosfury annihilates the human race
Fuck
