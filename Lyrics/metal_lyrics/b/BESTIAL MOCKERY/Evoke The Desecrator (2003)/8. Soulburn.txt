I leave the world behind
End the fucking story
For the earth no hope
So die don't you worry

Life - a way to suffer
Love - illusion for fools
Hope - a pitiful lie
Humans - born to fucking die

So burn bridges burn
For me there's no return
Now cry mortals cry
This time you gonna die

A cold wind howl tonight
Its message is so clear
I face the bitter truth
And kill what I hold dear

So burn bridges burn
For me there's no return
Now cry mortals cry
This time you gonna die

Life - a way to suffer
Love - illusion for fools
Hope - a pitiful lie
Humans - born to fucking die

So burn bridges burn
For me there's no return
Now cry mortals cry
This time you gonna die
