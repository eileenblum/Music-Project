Death upon the holy skies
Desecrate all christian lies
Sacrifice all fucking light
God must burn tonight

I can see Him
Rising up
From the pit

I can feel Him
Flying through
The ancient skies

I obey Him
From the depth
Of my soul

Masturbate when angel cries
Slaughter Lord all infants dies
Black sun bestow our fight
Finally might makes right

He is ready
To strike down
The god of light

He is eager
To snap his jaws
In your throat

He is foaming
With boiling hatred
Pure as blood

Death upon the holy skies
Desecrate all christian lies
Sacrifice all fucking light
God must burn tonight

Death upon the
Death upon
The holy skies

Desecrate all
Desecrate all
Christian lies

Sacrifice all
Sacrifice all
Fucking light

Death upon the holy skies
