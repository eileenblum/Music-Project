Awaken the force of Imprecation
In eerie crimson light
Together in absolute Evil
In a Hellish choir we summon thee

Eclipse of the woods
Devils dance between the trees
The blood-filled chalice begins to burn
And grotesque shapes cry in pain

Hold the dagger of Sacrifice high
Source of Evil prevail
Demons rise from the Hell which you are spawned
This is for you my Lord

Awaken the force of Imprecation
In eerie crimson light
Together in absolute Evil
In a Hellish choir we summon thee

An instant stench of blood
Fills the abandoned woods
Nailed and impaled
The angel lies in a circle of blood

Bloodlust and desire

Demons...
Feast at my command
