Night of infernal orgies
We'll feast on the virgin's blood
Demons scream and witches dance
The Devil appear in fire and flames

We will live in feast and sin
Satan has called us for sabbath

Sabbath molestation
The altar is drenched in blood
Twisted crosses crowned with skulls
Satanic evil born in hell

Goat's feast
Goat's feast
Goat's feast
Goat's feast

Death and pain in Satan's curse
Witches whirl around the flames
Rites of hell in darkest lust
Sorcery and debauchery

Devils mark is set on you
You are the chosen to burn

Under the fullmoon we sacrifice
Blackest flames is tearing you down
Hellish stench of burning flesh
Pentagram and blasphemy

Goat's feast
Goat's feast
Goat's feast
Goat's feast
