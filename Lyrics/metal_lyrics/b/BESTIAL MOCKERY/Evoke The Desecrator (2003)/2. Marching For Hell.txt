Roaring tanks proves our might
We conquer and we kill
Soldiers of Death with fire in sight
The fields lie red

Fighting with the fury of Hell
As we crush the weak
Fire spreads in the land of god
For victory we seek

Marching for hell
Victory! Victory!
Conquer and kill
Victory! Victory!

Battles won and won again
Blasphemies in blood unfolds
The War is here for us to win
Satan laughs as heaven falls

Killing the Christs
Burn all their lies
Doomsday is here
Make your stand

Lord Satan commands
The dead rise from the graves
Ultimate total War
Perdition prevails

Marching for hell
Victory! Victory!
Conquer and kill
Victory! Victory!
