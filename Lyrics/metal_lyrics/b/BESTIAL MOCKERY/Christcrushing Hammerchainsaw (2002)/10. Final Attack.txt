Chaos and darkness
Spread all around
Blood lust and evil
You are hellbound

Satan is laughing
As he impales your head
Torment is hellish
You are left dead

666 warheads
Pointing at Jerusalem's heart
Black Metal hellstorm
No one survives
â¦the final attack!

Bestial black masses
Heads sat on poles
The devil is grinning
While he feasts on virgin souls

Machines of war
Fire and hell
Eating their way
Black forces revel

666 warheads
Pointing at Jerusalem's heart
Black Metal hellstorm
No one survives
â¦the final attack!
