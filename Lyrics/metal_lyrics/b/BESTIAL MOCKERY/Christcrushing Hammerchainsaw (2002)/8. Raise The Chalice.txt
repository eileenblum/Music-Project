Black forces surround me
From the very depths of hell
In the midnight hour
Your blood feel

Ashes to ashes
Dust to fucking dust
Ritual of sacrifice
Fulfill it I must

Raise the chalice
Raise the chalice
Raise the chalice
Raise it!

I close the circle
With the cursed ritual sword
And raise the chalice
Evoke the desecrater â the lord

You're a slave under my spell
Powered by the ultimate forces of hell

Ashes to ashes
Dust to fucking dust
Ritual of sacrifice
Fulfill it I must

Raise the chalice
Raise the chalice
Raise the chalice
Raise it!
