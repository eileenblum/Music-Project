Mother earth feel my pain
Nuclear bombs fall down like rain
The holy words of the Koran
I shoved it up my ass

This is a war from my ancestors
This is a war from the past
Screaming for your blood, my vengeance has come
Burning you out, the war will be won

No remorse - bleed and die
No remorse - I shit on gods lie
No remorse - bound to die
No remorse - I shit on gods fucking lie

Jesus Christ was send to earth
Got crucified in fucking dirt
Your fate will be the same
I kill you again and again

Atomic warfare destroying your lands
Drunk with the rage from my fathers
Sworn to make those bastards bleed
Christian sluts will eat my seed

No remorse - bleed and die
No remorse - I shit on gods lie
No remorse - bound to die
No remorse - I shit on gods fucking lie
