Possessed by death
I deny the gift
That was given to me
By the god of life

Ultimate blasphemy through death
Circle of blood is closed
Kneel before the reaper
Return now my powers

Suicide blasphemy
Enter purgatory
The sin of Satan
Is materialized in my knife

Possessed by death
Eruptions of evil
Insane and scabbing
In my own body

I spit at your life
Worthless fucking lie
Nothing can stop the blasphemies
Devoted to death

Suicide blasphemy
Enter purgatory
The sin of Satan
Is materialized in my knife
