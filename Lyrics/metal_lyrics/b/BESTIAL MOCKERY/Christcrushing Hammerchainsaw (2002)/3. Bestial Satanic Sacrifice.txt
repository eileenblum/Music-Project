Under the cursed pentagram
The altar stands
Covered with the purest blood
I raise my hands

Master Satan take my gift
For thee I would give my life
The virgin cries in agony
As I raise my knife

Overlord take my gift
Bestial Satanic Sacrifice
Offering to the one with horns
Bestial Satanic Sacrifice to hell!!

A chasm open before my eyes
And hellfire prevails
The roaring flames consume the flesh
As life now only fails

Satan stands in hellish pride
As life now cease to be
Reaper smiles
Death is given immortality

Overlord take my gift
Bestial Satanic Sacrifice
Offering to the one with horns
Bestial Satanic Sacrifice to hell!!
