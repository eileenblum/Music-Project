Screaming in cursed pain
The agony will never end
Invoking from the seventh gate
Demons shredding the soul

Illusion breaks before your eyes
Realizing deaths reality
Riding the wires of pain
Hell is the only way

Imprecation
Pain imprecation

Tortured souls stare with hollow lifeless eyes
This is the crematory's other side
Endless pain, the ritual is done
I have seen the devil is the one

Screaming in cursed pain
The agony will never end
Invoking from the seventh gate
Demons shredding the soul

Satan shows the truth
Twisted macabre hell
Torment the reapers scythe
Into the abyss you'll fall

Imprecation
Pain imprecation

Tortured souls stare with hollow lifeless eyes
This is the crematory's other side
Endless pain, the ritual is done
Face the hell, I am Satan's son
