The winds of Hell are gathered
The angels are crying tonight
The seas of earth are storming
Antichrist show your might

Armies are standing silent
The skies are crimson as blood
Blackest clouds are forming
The kings are drawling in mud

Storm of the beast
Rising in fire
Storm of the beast
Reclaiming the throne

The ground is shattered by earthquake
City of Bethlehem burn
Infernal flames are rising
This is the Dragon's return

The kingdoms of earth are falling
The Reaper's harvest of Death
Legions of angels are suffocating
by the fire of Satan's breath

Storm of the beast
Rising in fire
Storm of the beast
Reclaiming the throne

The blood runs from Golgotha
Gonfalons of Hell are raised
The fall of heaven is present
and the Beast is praised

Darkness fills the halls of heaven
Abyss engulfs the light
Storms of fire are howling
Forever eternal night

Storm of the beast
Rising in fire
Storm of the beast
Reclaiming the throne
