Antichrist of war
Death and hate I implore
Crusader with a fucking scythe
Show deaths ultimate might

Reaping land after land
Blood spill falls on the sand
Atomic deathcharge I trust
End of the world I lust

Antichrist [x4]
Antichrist of, Antichrist of,
Antichrist of war

Bringers of the ultimate end
Slaying the all priest and godsend
The damned army shall rise
Venomous vicious and cruel

Tyrants of underground grace
are finally out of the maze
Dwellers of forsaken waste
Attack the Vatican nuns so chaste

Antichrist
Antichrist
Antichrist
Antichrist of, Antichrist of,
Antichrist of war

Hail master infernal fucking desaster

Rising in east with the beast
Attacking the west with unrest
Casting my shadow on all
Finally god city fall

Invoking the Apocalypse Lord
Hail the reign of the Barbaric hords
From the Temple down in the ground
He emerge without making a sound

Antichrist [x4]
Antichrist of, Antichrist of,
Antichrist of war

With their curse they are breaking the seal
Hark the revelation our god will reveal
Inverted cross - sign of the dark
And in the sky burns our mark
