[performed by Bestial Mockery]Flash of thunder, howling winds
A sacrifice tonight
Invocation ritual
I draw the fucking signs

I call upon the god of doom
My blade shines fuckin' red
On this eve the blood was spilt
The virgin's fucking dead

Master - Master - Master

Evil spirits sing his name
In circle made of flames
Two black horns and sulphur smoke
The kiss of fuckin' shame

Prince of darkness, king of hell
Twist and burn my fate
Poison me with rotten blood
Lord of fuckin' hate

Master - Master - Master

In the fullmoon light so dim
Satan holds his court
Witches, bitches, murderers
Sluts and fuckin' whores

Prince of darkness, king of hell
Twist and burn my fate
Poison me with rotten blood
Lord of fuckin' hate

Master - Master - Master - Master!!!!
