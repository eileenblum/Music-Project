[Lyrics &amp; Music: Ban Lesage]

Running through some sick deadline
Paying garbage as ambrosia
but we are happy if we can pay for it
Are we blind?
Are we dead?
Amid hyenas on a leash
worshiping mediocrity
precarious glimpses of empathy
ain't your head too close to the screen?
We had perfect days
blackout the brighter skies
All that is worth a perfect end
We had perfect days
blackout the brighter skies
All that is worth a perfect death

Take it down...
Pin this to your wall
"Global Takedown coming on"
No exception nor excuse
take risk or take abuse
Now open your eyes 'cause today you are growing stronger
We had perfect days
blackout the brighter skies
All that is worth a perfect death
Take it down...
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up and disobey!
