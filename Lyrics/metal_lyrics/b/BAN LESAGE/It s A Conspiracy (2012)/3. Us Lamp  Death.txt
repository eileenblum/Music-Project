[Lyrics &amp; Music: Ban Lesage]

I won't hate life because of you
all that you've told me wasn't true
so this is how it ends
just us and death
For every Hell you've put me through
I saved a smile only for you
your twisted mind drains all
that I find pure
As I'm running through a barrier
(I see your ghost)
And its running out of me
As I'm running through a barrier
(I kill your ghost)
And I watch it
Dying, dying, dying!
I didn't know a ghost could have a shadow
a shadow and a hole
targeting my soul
I saw behind it
(I felt in love- Now you're my ghost)
As I'm running through a barrier
(I see your ghost)
And its running out of me
As I'm running through a barrier
(I kill your ghost)
And I watch it
Dying, dying, dying!
This grave is all yours
and I'm stepping on it
You sad sad ghost
Us and Death alone
are you feeling something?
Are you feeling something?
