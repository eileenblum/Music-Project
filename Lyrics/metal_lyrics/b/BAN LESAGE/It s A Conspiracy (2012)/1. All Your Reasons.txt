[Music &amp; Lyrics: Ban Lesage]

I'm the one who sees all your Hells

and you just ignore me
I'm the smiling face at the end
shinning through your guilt
I'm that old forgotten feelings that you crave
I'm all you meant to become
the spark inside this corpse

it is OK if you want to try
it is OK if you want to...

I'm the stab you choose to forget
and its secrets
I'm a guiding bliss, a step out of place
I'm the only one who knows about
that day that lie that ...
I'm talking to you
I'm telling you "let go..."

It is OK if you want to try
It is OK if you want to..

Now, here comes the half smile
this is how demons are born
pure ears cant deal true evil
Now, here comes the half smile
this is how demons are born
All your reasons I will bury alive...

it is OK if you want to try
All your reasons I will bury alive...
