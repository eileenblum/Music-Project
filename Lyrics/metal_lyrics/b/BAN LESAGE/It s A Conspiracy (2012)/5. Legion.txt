[Music &amp; Lyrics: Ban Lesage]

Let's make a cloud of death
singing madly to the air
Now it comes to you how mad you really are
With no remorse you do what you are
Reminding everyone a painful truth is saner than a lie
Mystery has no divinity is just a chain
of secrecy through time
I said go on
you won't break down
break the lie then get up
Legion rise!
Kimis Iziz TÄrtÄ« SÇnni [Sumerian for "kneel down","get up","repeat the message"]
Zombification process has begun
look into the eyes of your love ones
Harvesting of the souls is reigning under
the tag of futuristic crap
When I was afraid I screamed at them
'Cause fear triggers my hate
Now that I see through their ego masks
weakness I see so I'm laughing ha ha ha!
I said go on
you won't break down
break the lie then get up
Legion rise!
I said go on
now you're lying yourself on the floor
then get up
Legion rise!
I'm still in you
Alive
Your first pure you
Unscarred
No dogma
No flags
Humanity will thrive
Will rise!
By screaming loud enough
Hell will shake under our feet
By screaming loud enough
Bring the end of all fears
lawi bÄ«tka! [Sumerian for "you are surrounded]
