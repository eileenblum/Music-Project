For the last time did the sun set
Sky was covered with black clouds
A severe and cold rain began
One after another did it thunder
A big chaos started on earth
People didn't know what to do
Ran to and fro in horror and panic
But there was something strange
It thundered only on particular people
They were the slaves of light's false world
Then stop the thunderbolts, the survivors came together
They were all the lovers of pure darkness
Under the armageddon's sky
The sun didn't rise forever
The eternal dark age started
Well then everything's been more beautiful
