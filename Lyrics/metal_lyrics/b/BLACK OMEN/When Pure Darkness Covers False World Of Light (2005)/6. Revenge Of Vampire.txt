And now
He living in darkness
And enjoys darkness
Takes revenge from the life
Feeding with the blood of evils
No mercy left in his heart
Neither for life nor for love
The only thing he thought getting
Revenge from everything
Force him making this decision
Day by day increasing of blood
Increasing of hate to humanity
Now his only friends were loneliness and darkness
