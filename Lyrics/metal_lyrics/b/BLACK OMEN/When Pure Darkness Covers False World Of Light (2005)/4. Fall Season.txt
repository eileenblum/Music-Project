Human's life story is like
The travel of a seed in the nature
Comes the fall, dies the nature
The wind gathered the scattered seeds
The seed became a plant at the same root
And the plant grew its boughs were formed
To different twigs headed the seeds
Twigs separated into twigs
And become each seed a leaf
Then came the fall withered the leaves
And they fell one by one
The wind cast all aforeknitted leaves away
