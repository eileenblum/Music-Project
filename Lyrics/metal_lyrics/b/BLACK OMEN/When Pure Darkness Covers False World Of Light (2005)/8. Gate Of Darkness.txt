I will stay alone until I die
Sorrow like a spider
Waiting for the hunt
Wait for me, my god!
Why is that my destiny?
Tell me the truth
Which is your reality?
Evil or kind?
Why? For my lies
Why? For my desires
Why? For my hate
Why? For my sins
Gate of darknessWhy?
Gate of darkness
Discovers the last human feelings
Left in his heart
