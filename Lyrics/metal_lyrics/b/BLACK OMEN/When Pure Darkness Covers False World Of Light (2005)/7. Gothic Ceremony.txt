Life is the hell where evil and good
For him kind looses, and suffers everytime
Evil behind their hypocrisy
Lives with hiding everytime
Where the kind ends evil starts
Evil behaving bad to evil is evil
Is life evil that gives us sorrow?
Is death evil takes our life?
He sees killing every evil
Like a gothic ceremony
Gothic ceremony must go on
Till the evil ends
