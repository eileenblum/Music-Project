Life with sorrowful tears, decision of suicide
Awakening by sorrowful smiles, darkness coming
The only thing left was his dreams and soul
After loosing his dreams
He has choosen discouraging his soul
In a rainy night, waiting near a precipire
Saw him with a black candle
Lord of darkness
"A new life waiting you without sunrise and pain
Darkness will bless you! This will be your way"
Ignorance of daylight, chooses the dark
With the hate in his heart
For destroying evil
With black candle
