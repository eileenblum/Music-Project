The corpse of queen was in his arms
Walking alone under the moonlight
She didn't give a reaction to his love
In that case she was evil, like others
And now she is dead, like others
After that he understood the real evil is god!
Creating all of this evil was god's game
Could he kill god, like others
Well then he was helpless
Buried all of his love and pain inside heart
And waited sunrise with tears
The sun risen on two embracing corpses
