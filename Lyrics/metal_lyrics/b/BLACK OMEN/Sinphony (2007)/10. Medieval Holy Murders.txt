In medieval unjust flames are burning the innocent
Religious massacre is the material source of the inquisition.
Modern thoughts are accused of worshipping the Satan
Is martyrdom destiny of the different ones?

Is everything exceeding the normality satanic?
Is everything exceeding the normality satanic?

Or is this a fiction of propaganda which serves to
Acquit the princes' dark and lustful desires?
Keeping people in ignorance and superstition
Religion, the political power, is applied
With love elixirs, magic spell, talisman and enchanted rings

Is everything exceeding the normality satanic?
Is everything exceeding the normality satanic?

Satan: An efficient commercial fund.
Possessions of the killed enriched the inquisition

The crazier the malicious bunk, the more listeners they found.
The crazier the malicious bunk, the more listeners they found.

Martha Carrier on top, 14 women and 5 men
Were hung in Salem under the guise of being witch
In Mara were burned alive unjustly 85 people
Who were said to hold satanic ceremonies.

With the French Revolution,
A darkest part of the History of Vileness was closed
But still the Satan is undefeated, though!!
But still the Satan is undefeated, though!!
But still the Satan is undefeated, thoughâ¦
