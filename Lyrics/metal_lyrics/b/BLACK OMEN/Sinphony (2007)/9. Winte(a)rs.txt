A water drop met the cold air
It froze and became too heavy to be able to hold itself
As a snowflake, it fell on the ground with the others
Nature covered its white sheet on the ground
O the nights were enlightened, left alone were the streets

We faced agony while growing
Filled with tears were our eyes and tears couldn't stand
Falling down from our cheeks
Mankind spreaded their lies over the relationships
We lost our zest for living, we were left alone.

O the nights were enlightened, left alone were the streets
We lost our zest for living, we were left alone.
We were left alone...
