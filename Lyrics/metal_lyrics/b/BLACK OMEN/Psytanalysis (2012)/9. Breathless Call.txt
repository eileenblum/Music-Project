There is a crowd out of the night:
With smiling masks on, angel looking devils
Dancing, talking, shouting, howling, rocking and tumbling
Thy soul, which cannot notice this fake game headest to the artificial light
They are waiting for thee,
To deceive, pain and wear thee out
Stop, notice and see:

The only real light is the darkness of the night!

I shall meet thee when the dark night falls
With the sorrow in my glance, caused by the lost feelings
My eyes shall meet thine, when darkness fallest
My words are stiff and hard to comprehend
To believe, just look me in the eye

Dead children are weeping where the light exists
There, the killer puppets of God
Praying, killing, shouting, howling, rocking and tumbling
Blood and tears never stop but flow
They are waiting for thee.
Happiness is artificial there
Stop notice and comprehend:

The only real happiness is the pain itself!

I shall meet thee where the sun never reachest, in the velvet darkness
With the shrunkenness in my body caused by the hope Iâve lost
My hands shall meet thine when the night fallest
My soul is arduous and hard to carry
To carry, just open thy heart. 

The only real light is the darkness of the night!
The only real happiness is the pain itself!
Breathless callâ¦
