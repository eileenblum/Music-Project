The losses of destructionâs pain is inside us
The people who were annihilated for us to live
The people who died when we were giving our fight

Their pain are inside me, like an arrow sticking into my flesh

God, why did you teach us pain
To this race that cannot obstruct themselves
The thing that came out of your hands is going to perish in mine, chaos

Itâs going to surround your world,your universe
Youâre going to beg for the pain that you have given to end

While we are turturing you
Your doctrines are going to dissappear with us 
Your judgement wonât rule in theese realms anymore

Rise up to your nothingness, god of emptiness
Perish in oblivion

The voices that thought humanity nothingness
Youâre going to live the chaos, in my raceâs renaissance
Your bodies will be cremated
Your world of believers will be slaughtered

I swear you will forget god
You wâont call out his name again
Your children are our children now
Your familiy is our cemetery
Your god is the god of chaos
