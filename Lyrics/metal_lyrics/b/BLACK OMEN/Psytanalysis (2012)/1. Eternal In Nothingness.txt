The trees are swinging with the wind
The meadow is dancing with the rain
The circles on the lake are enlarging 
The river flowest in dark

The stars are pale, the moon is cold

Iâm hurtling in infinity to uncertainty Iâm the one
swallowed by nothingness Iâm everlasting and eternal

This infuriating prostration never ends
My dark heart is filled with hatred

Hypocrite and fake words flow
Deceitful echoes are lost in the sky

Chaos is back,
My chaos is back again!
