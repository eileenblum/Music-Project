From the necropolis up the hill
The beast will come
Looking at the children through the window 
To scare them to death ----- with its dreadful face

Dread stalkest at night
The beast hidest in the dark
Can the children sleep tonight?
Are their curtains drawn?

Is the beast spying on their room out the street?
Or is it just their subconscious?

Is a knife under their pillow enough to ease them?
Will their heart sustain this dread every other night?
