The death that was created by the hands of humankind
I know  most of the answers
While I canât give any meaning Iâm going astray
Ä°n a perishing world

I cannot wake up from my nightmares
Inside the meaningless abyss
While loosing my existence
Iâm hitting myself into the ground

Now Iâm one of them
The secret is once found out

In the place where darkness    
never ends Iâm despairingly 
Struggling while my nightmares
Are making me loose my 
Existence trying to wake up
Despairingly my eyes
Are covered in red
Now Iâm taking pleasure 
From your pain
When their souls 
Are perishing in 
My emptiness
In my nightmares
From they will
Never wake up

Now Iâm one of them
The secret is once found out
