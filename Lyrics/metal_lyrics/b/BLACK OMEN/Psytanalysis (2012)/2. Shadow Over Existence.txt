Keep the light on against holiness
Heaven turn into blood
Donât you see the dark throne inside thee?

The shadow of existence 
Hath fallen over its light

The last flower on Godâs tomb hath faded
 The Armageddon had already broken out
Gabriel ended it all
The devils ran away from here

Water the seeds of vehemence
Look into the horizon
Over dead bodies 
The face of the inferno lies there
It lies there!

Your fate is long blackened
