Naked bodies are swaying at the gallows end
Within the fog among the run down chateaus

The wind hurlest the sand away
In this ancient town that calling me in my dreams

They were once existed, now vanished
Everything hath come to an end
Under the pale moon, solitude hath remained
They are free now

The ancient town is free
The deads are free now
