The hatred that falls upon from my past
Appears now
I fear, my hatred
Of loosing myself 

I just closed my eyes
I made myself nonexistent
While loosing my ego
I prayed to be forgiven

It comes one after another
Deaths, days, weeks, massacres
Waiting for the sun to rise again
The tears of hatred are flowing down my eyes

I feel the pain inside me
Every move I make drives me more to a dead-end
Iâm closing my eyes Iâm loosing my mind
The tears of hatred are flowing down my eyes

I know I wontât be taken
To the lands that I want to go
I want it to have an end
When the only thing that I can do is to bloodshed
