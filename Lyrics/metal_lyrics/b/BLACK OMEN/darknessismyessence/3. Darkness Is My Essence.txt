I arose from nothingness to archaic firmaments
In gloomy aeterna I flew, Iâd lost in moments
My soul drifted in melancholy ocean for ever and ever
Existence of universe is nothing but cabin fever

I passed through a black hole, sweeping misery
Nothingness was oppressed with grief, condensed and came into being
I transformed into the human body and fell to earth
I brought chaos, spleen, death and loneliness

Darkness is my essence
I painted pain with my blood to the night sky
Raindrops froze in my breath
Turned into a blizzard and blew on meadows

Thou moved with a false existence
Looked for meaning throughout thy life
By the time thy body decayed in cold land
Thou never understood that thou art nothing.
