Itâs been days and weeks, we stuck in this mountain hut.
A blanket of snow lay on the ground
Roads are closed, communication lost
Now weâre far away from all joy and health,
Happiness and pleasures, and our calourful halls.

In sickness and in hell,
Till death do us part,
Till hunger tear us apart
Wolves shall hear thy yell
While Iâm eating thy heart
This is death angelâs art
There is no ringing bell
Soon thou shanât get well

Days are snow-white, black is the night.
Blizzard whistles, Azrael whispers.
Wolves howl and fight. Beloved ! Hold on tight !
Weâre about to die, they hunt for us low and high.

âHomo Homini Lupusâ, one of us must be alive.
âFinis coronat opusâ, right align or left align
Death says âHocus Pocusâ, thou can not hold the line
Love is a definite minus, when I am thy danger sign.
