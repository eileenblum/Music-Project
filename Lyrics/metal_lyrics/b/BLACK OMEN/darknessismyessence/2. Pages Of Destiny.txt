The pages of destiny were ajar
The revulsion of the past was put in words
Thou faltered in what was written
Were all these thou?

We were of the generation that slayed itself
Not to ever exist again!!!

âIf only I hath not chosen and acceptedâ
Thou thought for a split second
When the earth is bloodstained
And when the heavens turn red

And began the new life
The war to survive
While death is the crown for everyone
Tears were shed on earth, onto what is left from it

It was too late to notice
Impossible to fix
Ghastly to move on
When thy touch thaws, when thy eyes fade
When thy breath rots
For thy future
