This is not who I planned to be and when I look in the mirror, I don't see me.
Today I woke up and I realized, that I don't see the world with the same naive eyes.
I have desperately, frantically tried to hold my composure.
But really careless you were, now you've awoken the dormant and vile evil within me.
I'll have you praying for my mercy and cursing the wretched day in which your fate has brought you close to me.
I will show you my hell, there's no use calling out for help.
I've fallen deep in the well.
Now I can't find my self (here we go)

I'm slowly losing parts of who I used to be.
Fade in to the blackened drowning pit.
My identity vanished from within me, an the calamity left a lack of sanity.
Now I can't find, I can't find myself. (here we go)
Now I can't find my self (here we go)

'Cause every time I look at you I feel selfless!
Selfless!
