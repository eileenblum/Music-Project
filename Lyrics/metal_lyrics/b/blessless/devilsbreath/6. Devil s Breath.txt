And after a long time and a long life dedicated to the torture and the world's blight, one begins to wonder.
and when you cant even measure the pleasure of the things you once treasured, that's when I met him.
he decided not to stand there, with his hand then, pulled a stool next to me with a slight grin.
but even I could tell that man, was no better than I am.
and with his pallid skin and obsidian eyes, I could see it in his face it was man's demise.
He looked to me and said...

And then he said, I have a proposition and you look the part.
let me show you what I have in mind.
I saw terror.
And then he said, I have a proposition and you look the part.
let me show you what I have in mind.
I saw terror. I shook his hand.

Now wake up (wake up) and see, I've destroyed everything for which live
Open your eyes (wake up) and realize, I've become your nightmare
Now wake up (wake up) and see, I've destroyed everything for which live
Open your eyes (wake up) and realize, well if you're looking for the devil then he's right fucking here.

Yeah he's right fucking here!
well if you're looking for the devil then he's right fucking here.

And after a long time and a long life dedicated to the torture and the world's blight, one begins to wonder.
and when you cant even measure the pleasure of the things you once treasured, that's when I became him.
That's when I became the devil!
I've come to terms with becoming what you call the devil.

I decided I would reign in terror!
My terror will reign!

I will raise hell!
