I won't be like you!
Fuck you!

So who the fuck are you to tell me what to be?
I won't be like the fools who buy the bullshit they sell on the fucking TV
So step the fuck back
This is a reality check! What!?
I won't be like you!
There is nothing you can fucking do!

Over and over again I find myself a subject
Of the conformity lined within society
Corrupting minds of the weak into a futile existence
So blindly following like sheep

This reoccurring dilemma, of second guessing myself
I won't be the one to sell my soul away to live inside this hell
Society is a factory of an ill-fated race
Born into a dying world, a preasembled disease

Over and over again I find myself a subject
Of the conformity lined within society
Corrupting minds of the weak into a futile existence
So blindly following like sheep

These colors won't fade
I'll walk alone onto my grave

I won't be the stereotype
So fuck you if you don't agree with how I live my life
I won't be the stereotype
You think I've lost my mind

They say you can only force something so much until it breaks!

Over and over again I find myself a subject
Of the conformity lined within society
Corrupting minds of the weak into a futile existence
So blindly following like sheep

I refuse to be a copied fucking copy of a copy
I will remain true
I refuse to be a copied fucking copy of a copy
I won't be like you!
