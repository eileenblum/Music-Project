You, two faced, fucking coward.
Waste of space, you disgrace.

If there is something I can't stand, is people who pretend and act like they're your friend.
And when your back is turned, your rep is to be burned.
When will you learn?

You will see my face behind the flames as I watch your world burn.
You will see a smile upon this face as I watch your world burn.
Choke

If there is something I can't stand, is people who pretend and act like they're your friend.
And when your back is turned, your rep is to be burned.
When will you learn?
Bleeeaagh

You slithering fucking faggot, you're so spineless (spineless)
Walking 'round like your shit is the finest.
Ill rip out your tongue and make you choke on it.
Your ass is too close to your mouth you're only talking shit.
Bleh!

You will see my face behind the flames as I watch your world burn.
You will see a smile upon this face as I watch your world burn.
Choke

Fucking choke!

You, two faced, fucking coward.
Waste of space, you disgrace.
If there is something I can't stand, is people who pretend and act like they're your friend.
And when your back is turned, your rep is to be burned.
When will you learn?

You will see me succeed.
You will tremble at my feet.
You will see me succeed.
You will tremble at my feet.
