This is where
We all come to die
This clouded place in my fucking head
Saturated in my negativity
I should feel worse
For how I've been done
Everyday I hate the man it has made me become
Self-loathing that cannot be undone
On, and on, through the things that I hate the most
Worst days of my life
Now that's all I have
That is all I have
I am addicted to a life of grief
Always reminding me when things
I am addicted to misery
Always reminding me when things felt
Fucking right with my head
The fact that this is my fucking life
Makes me sick everyday
I have come to not care
I am all but a hollow shell of
Everything I was meant to be
This is my fucking life
Not a day where I feel alive
This is my fucking life
This is where my hopes and dreams
Have died
This is my day to day, and I know that it's not fucking right
This hate is my vice
This dead heart, and dead soul
Have me entirely
Addicted to a life of grief
Always reminding me when things
I am addicted to misery
Always reminding me when things felt
Fucking right with my head
On, and on, through the things that I hate the most
And now they are all I have
The lowest point of one's life
The lowest
