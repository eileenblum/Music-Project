I can't have the weight of your world
Crushing my chest I can't fucking breathe
I've been told things will get better
Not as far as I can see
This is starting to strip your world
Your self-centred sociopathic manipulative mentality
I am out of ways of coping
Done with dwelling on the past the start of tranquility
Appreciate me for nothing
Nobody should
Remember this disgusting heap
I want fucking ghosts
To keep my company
I scare the fucking hell out of myself
I disappoint you and those around me
I don't know what would fucking help me
I wish I had a .12 gauge in the mouth
And I'll slip down
To the unholy south
Where my body drops into the fate I was bound
You have literally pushed me to the point I don't give a fuck
About you or anything else
You expected a crutch
From my broken fucking legs
Any voice is dull
When I just have a voice telling me
Fucking taunting me
Striking me it says
"Kill yourself"
"You are just suffering for nothing"
"Suppress you won't
There is a reason you don't sleep"
"Kill yourself, now"
"Why the fuck are you waiting"
"What has carried you this far
Is as dead as your inevitable unfolding"
This is why I hate when people rely on me
For their own fucking happiness what about me
Where was this selflessness that you hold above me
There is no stability in a burning fucking train wreck
And all I can think is none of this will matter
When I'm dead, and done
