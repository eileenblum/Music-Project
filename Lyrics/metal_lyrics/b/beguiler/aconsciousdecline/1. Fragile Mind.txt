This is the start,
of week one reality hasn't hit
This is the story of how fragile
The human mind really is
I don't know where I was
Or what I was taking in
But I had a feeling
What little was left
Would soon be meaningless
It was then the weeks rolled on
It took endless bottles, and mental blocks
I remember when I still cared
I don't see that person anywhere
Pretty sure I left him dying
At the doorstep of hell
This is the start of week twelve
I fucking hate myself
And this shit will never work
It takes a lot to admit what I just did
And to really believe it
I now know
That this has made me sick
Blocking out
What I knew with poison
I feel this in my bones
My life, and my interior
Is telling me I want to die
I now know
I will always be alone when I'm at my lows
Nobody cares no time to try
Everybody has got their own
Through this exit wound in my head
The suffering will pass along
Selfishly
Through the exit wound in my head
This is the end of week fifty-two
I have became a corpse
And buried myself with no strength
This was my week to seek
Death
