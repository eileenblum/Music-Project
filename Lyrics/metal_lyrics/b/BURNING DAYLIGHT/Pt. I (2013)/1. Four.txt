Distant
Falling further away from the past
Feeling like thereâs no way to save you
Is this all there was or still some left to last
Killing just the way you intended

Canât you see passed the lies youâve created
Tying yourself into your knots of hatred
Holding tight because you belong nowhere
Should I save you or leave you standing there

I wont pretend that nothing is wrong
Still Iâm standing strong
Still Iâm standing strong
Caught in between like I don't belong
What have I become
What have I become
My shining star left me here to rot
Planned it from the start
You planned it from the start
Pretending I am something I am not
Curse your blessed heart
No, curse your evil heart

Canât you see passed the lies youâve created
Tying yourself into your knots of hatred
Holding tight because you belong nowhere
Should I save you or leave you standing there
