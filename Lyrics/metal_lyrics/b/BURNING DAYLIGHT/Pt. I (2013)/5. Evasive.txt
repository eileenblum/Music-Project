Take the times that come so soon
And all the lies that we consume
Defeat the fear think we are safe
But we aren't here we're in some other place

I feel evasive around you
Is this a band sign

Time is all we need to get around the sound
I can not seem to regret the sight
How could you think that I'd remember the sound
And this may be something we will never forget

I feel evasive around you
Is this s bad sign

So evasive
Never thought that I would turn out this way
Never thought what was a dream could be so real
Never thought that I'd remember every day
And why I feel this way

I feel evasive around you
Is this a bad sign
I feel evasive around you
Is this a bad sign
