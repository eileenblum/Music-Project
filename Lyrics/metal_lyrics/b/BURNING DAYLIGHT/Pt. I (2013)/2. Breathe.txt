As I awake my feet touch the floor
Wondering what life has in store
Itâs become hard to speak and now
I feel like Iâm sinking but don't know how
Iâm stuck here thinking that my life is passing
But how can that happen when its everlasting
Feel like Iâm slipping when feeling lonely
But remain holding words a wise man told me

And Breathe
Adjust your soul
Let it all go
Youâre not alone
Itâs just the feelings left you
Hold on tight
With all your might
And keep in mind
Not everything is gone

Stunned by the image that has appeared
Afraid to glance back into the mirror
Lost thoughts tell me what I should be
Iâll never listen Iâll make them see
But itâs hard knowing Iâm the only one whoâs
On this side with me
Feel like Iâm slipping when feeling lonely
But remain holding words a wise man told me

And breathe
Adjust your soul
Let it all go
Youâre not alone
Itâs just the feelings left you
Hold on tight
With all your might
And keep in mind
Not everything is gone

And he told me
That I can be
Everything that I wanted
That If I try with all of my might
To become somebody
That I will make it and take it
That I will hold them and show them
These word to you are

Breathe
Adjust your soul
Let it all go
Youâre not alone
Itâs just the feelings left you

Breathe
Hold on tight
With all your might
And keep in mind
Not everything is gone

Breathe
Hold on tight
With all your might
And keep in mind
Not everything is gone
