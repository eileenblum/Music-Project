I feel like these wounds will never heal
Oh well
And I can feel you breathing down my neck
Itâs chilling
If I run away
Then whoâs to say

That you will follow me down

You stole the very soul from me
Oh well
And you placed it upon a shelf
In hell
If I fade away
Then whoâs to say

That you will follow me down

If I die today
Then whoâs to say

That you will follow me down
