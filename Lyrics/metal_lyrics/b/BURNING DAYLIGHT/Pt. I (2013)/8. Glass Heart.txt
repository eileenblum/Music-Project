In the chest of one forgotten
Holds a secret unbearable to most
Wanting to rest thinking it's nothing
Raises s glass, proposes a toast

Who relinquish their trust
Give in if they must
Who can not outlast this
Who take what they can
And open their hands
Accepting what's happened
Who can not forget
The love they had spent
Back at the start
And drop to the floor
Expecting much more
From this glass heart

After the fall
Creating the broken
Pieces of you
And pieces of them
Thrown into the fire
Your burning desire
To become one of those

Who relinquish their trust
Give in if they must
Who can not outlast this
Who take what they can
And open their hands
Accepting what's happened
Who can not forget
The love they had spent
Back at the start
And drop to the floor
Expecting much more
From this glass heart

Don't listen to them you're better than that
Don't be the same you're better than that
Don't listen to them you're better than that
Don't be the same you're better than that

Who relinquish their trust
Give in if they must
Who can not outlast this
Who take what they can
And open their hands
Accepting what's happened
Who can not forget
The love they had spent
Back at the start
And drop to the floor
Expecting much more
From this glass heart
