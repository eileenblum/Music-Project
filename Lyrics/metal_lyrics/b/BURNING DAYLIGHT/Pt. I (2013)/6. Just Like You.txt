In the beginning it felt so right
I never felt so alive
But after all was said and done
I came to realize I don't belong

So you wipe your crying eyes
When there's no hope left inside
After all is said and done
I will move on and be strong

Be strong
I don't know what you want from me
Take it all
I'm not what you want me to be

So you wipe your crying eyes
When all is wrong
When there's no hope left inside
What to do
After all is said and done
When all is gone
I will move on and be strong
Just like you
