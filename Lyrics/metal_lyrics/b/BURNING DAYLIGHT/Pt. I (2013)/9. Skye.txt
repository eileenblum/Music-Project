I've been waiting my whole life by now
I know she'll speak to me tonight
Every word from her mouth drowns in sorrow
I need to know that she's alright
And now I'm sitting impatiently
Can't keep still to save my life
I wanna hear her voice tonight
Is she even alive
Insecure and paranoid
She means the world to me
And God I want her to know I'm here
But she doesn't see
She doesn't understand

I'd give it all to see her here tonight
I'd give it all to know that she's alright
I lie awake in my dreams in hopes she will return
I die inside of my dreams I guess I'll never learn

I'm hearing her voice in my dreams
And still I'm waiting even in my sleep
I need to know if she's alright
Her voice is fading now
Something not right.
And now I'm living impatiently
Can't keep still to save my life
I wanna see her face tonight
Is she even alive
Insecure and paranoid
She means the world to me
God I want her to know I'm here
But she doesn't see

I'd give it all to see her here tonight
I'd give it all to know that she's alright
I lie awake in my dreams in hopes she will return
I die inside of my dreams I guess I'll never learn

I'd give it all to see her here tonight
I'd give it all to know that she's alright
I lie awake in my dreams in hopes she will return
I die inside of my dreams I guess I'll never learn
