My walk has staggered
I've become a hazard
To myself and everyone else
My minds depleting
From the earths deceiving
You lied and endangered my health
And I told you once
That without you I'd die
And I told you again
That I would never lie

Now my knees they buckle
With the weight of my trouble
And there's no point now
I've lost the will to survive

And now I'm falling to the ground so roughly
Reaching but grabbing nothing
Crawling on hands and knees
Bleeding out sorrowed pleas

After all of our battles
That we learned to handle
You left and I slowly grew
Into a monster that is pitied not feared
Remaining like this until my dying year

Now my knees they buckle
With the strain from my struggle
There's no point now
I've lost the will to stay here

And now I'm falling to the ground so roughly
Reaching but grabbing nothing
Crawling on hands and knees
Bleeding out sorrowed pleas

Never again
Never again
Never again

Crawling on hands and knees
Bleeding out sorrowed pleas

And now I'm falling to the ground so roughly
Reaching but grabbing nothing
Crawling on hands and knees
Bleeding out sorrowed pleas

Never again
I wont let this happen
Never again
I wont let this happen
Never again
I wont let this happen
