You were my everything my candle light
My eternal flame brightened the night
Tried to hold you close but you left my side
Thereâs no hope for me in this life

All I wanted was a taste
All I needed was erased

Days go by so slow
Confused by why you had go
My internal structure is based on pain
My only function is to take the blame

All I wanted was a taste
All I needed was erased
So where do we go from here
Confidence replaced with fear

Day after day I wonder how it got this way
Between you and I
I sit and think about it all the time
The way we were and the way we used to be
All our meaningless words
Meaningless to you but not to me

So where do we go from here
Confidence replaced with fear
