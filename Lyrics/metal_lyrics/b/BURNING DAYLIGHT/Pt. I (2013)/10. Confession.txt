Can we forget what happened last night
Can't quite handle thinking back
Erase this mind
Or at least the memories

Can not sleep
Can not dream
Can not live
With this

I'll hold you close
Let me show you how I feel
Can't go another day holding this inside
It's been eating me alive for who knows how long
So listen please
In you I will confide

Can not sleep
Can not dream
Can not live
With this

I wanna tell you something I thought I'd never say
Can't call it a secret but a feeling kept from everyone
And when I get this out I feel like I may
Turn away from the edge of insanity and run

You must know how I feel
This feelings so real
My heads such a mess
So I will confess

Before I break

Will this change us
Will we grow apart
Will this change us
Will we grow apart
Must fear nothing
Fearing nothing
Fearing nothing
Fearing nothing at all
