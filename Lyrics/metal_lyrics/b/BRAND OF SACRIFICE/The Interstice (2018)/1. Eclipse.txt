Your offerings have consecrated
They are marked by the brand
The sun has seen it's fifth death for the red lake to flow again
He will feel their pain in order to complete the final transformation
A name new and old

Falcon of darkness, send us into an age of abyss
Blinded by beauty with stacks of bodies as high as the eye can see

Feast apostles, feast

The one chosen by the hand of God
The master of the sinful black sheep and the king of the faithful blind

Welcome to the new age
Welcome to the new age
We are the branded ones
