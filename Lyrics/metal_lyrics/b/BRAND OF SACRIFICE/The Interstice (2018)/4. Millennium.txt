You've been sheltered in this household of hypocrisy to regenerate
Darkness centralized, haunting every dream
Causing uncertainty and savagery on a whim
Reason lost, the beast tempts from within

I will refuse it's chains, I will refuse it's restraints
I will rely on the sword, cutting through all the reprobate
Rely on the sword, cut through the reprobate

The people of the seat misguided by who they call holy
Dismissing exigent warnings, traversing mutants release
Pillage, molestation, plunder of the gutless
(Plunder of the gutless)

I'll carve out the corrupt
Watch the bodies fall, retain legitimate souls

(Establish)
Establish a barrier
(This barrier)
Watch the storms ahead
To control the swarms and regain control of this war

As long as we bear the brand, our anger, our sadness, our pain, and fear belong to them
