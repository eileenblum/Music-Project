I survey the room where the deceased lay
I witness eyes crimson, a monster
Spattered in blood, slaughtered
Band of the hawk hung on display
My strike must be fatal, if I want to withstand this

This beast is not of this world, I can feel it inside
But the band of the hawk will never cower and hide
(Never cower and hide)

What is this blade this mortal wields?
No matter, he's a human like so many before
I'll cut him down, destroy him with one blow
His strength surpasses any swordsman's I've faced before

My strike you evaded it
What the hell is this?

Your intentions interest me, in you I see no fear
A mere moral has punctured my skin and allowed me to feel again

Don't hold back, don't hold back, don't hold back
Don't hold back, don't hold back

You impress me mortal, we will meet again
