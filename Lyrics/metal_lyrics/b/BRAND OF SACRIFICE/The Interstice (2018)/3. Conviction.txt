You've been deceived
(Deceived)

You've been deceived by the holy see
Imprisoned by your convictions, blinded by superstition
Cover your sins with iron chains and royal amour of shame
Imprisoned by your convictions, blinded by superstition

Unbelief is what will lead to your eternal extinction
Embrace your surroundings and uncover the true meaning of fear
Enter the interstice and witness crimson eyes that terrorize
From this moment, this will be be your world
A realm between the transient and the dead

The bearer of light dwells in the deep darkness

Your attempt to break free is futile as you're mounted by a hideous beast
It's saliva touches your cheek while you shriek in agony
Your scream serves as an reminder of that day

Do not pray
If you pray, your hands will close together
You will not be able to survive the night

So I lose control over every ounce of remaining restraint
The sway of my blade decapitates
Born of bloodshed, strengthened to kill
They won't live to see the daybreak

You've been deceived by the holy see
Imprisoned by your convictions, blinded by superstition
Cover your sins with iron chains and royal amour of shame
Imprisoned by your convictions, blinded by superstition
