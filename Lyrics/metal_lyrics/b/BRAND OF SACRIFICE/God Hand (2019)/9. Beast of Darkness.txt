Comprised of hate and malice
This is the beast in its truest form

Now accept your destiny
The blood must flow
The blood, the blood must flow
It's inevitable

Do not attempt to break free
For you'll realize the power that you seek
This is the beast of darkness
This is the beast of darkness

Comprised of hate and malice
This is the beast in its truest form

Plagued by a mortifying past
Your resentment and anger grow parallel to its being
Advised by the beast to begin to release
While it waits for the moment to consume
Unleash the beast
Unleash, unleash the beast
You will see it in its truest form
Unleash the beast

Do not attempt to break free
For you'll realize the power that you seek
This is the beast of darkness
This is the beast of darkness

In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true, that man has no control, even over his own will

Do not break free
Now begin the carnage and release the darkness
Tear them apart
