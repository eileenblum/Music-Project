Resist surrender or surrender resistance
Surrender resistance

Induced by raging insanity
Clawing through demonic flesh of the enemy
Visions of haunting beasts transcending human limitation
My mind conflicted as I'm unable to determine a friend from a foe
(I am truly lost)
Eyes deceived, my body is engulfed by fear

Armour of the berserker to combat demon kind
Overwhelming my discernible mind (My mind)
Such invasive reparation can lead to my death
But I'll cleanse the Earth of filthy souls like theirs

So what the fuck would you prefer?
Death, defeat, or victory and war?
Defy and pick up your sword
Let them see your claw marks
See your claw marks

Resist surrender or surrender resistance
Now draw your sword, you're in an empowered state
Resist surrender or surrender resistance
Now let the world remember your name

Armour of the berserker to combat demon kind
Overwhelming my discernible mind (My mind)
Such invasive reparation can lead to my death
But I'll cleanse the Earth of filthy souls like theirs
Like theirs
