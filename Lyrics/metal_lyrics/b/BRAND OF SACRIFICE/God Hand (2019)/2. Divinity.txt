Hate is a place where a man who can't stand sadness goes

A fate of merciless suffering to obtain this abhorrent form
Embrace the hatred now that festers within the oncoming storm
This is his potential, his will in motion
From the depths of the furthest ocean

Tear them limb from limb as a tribute to the almighty God Hand
Tear them limb from limb as a tribute (As a tribute) to the almighty God Hand
Tear them limb from limb as a tribute (As a tribute) to the almighty God Hand
Arise, oh
Spread your wings of purity and begin to understand your true potential

Live or die for the dream
The dream lives
Live or die for the dream
This is the turning point
Live or die for the dream
All that awaits the weak is death
Live or die for the dream
Live or die for the dream

The reward for ambition too great is self-destruction
We are the branded ones (Branded)
Rise up and we will fight to survive
The only way for us to reach our kingdom
Is to step over every corpse that we've made
You have now lost your freedom
We'll haunt you in your sleep
You're destined to suffer endlessly
