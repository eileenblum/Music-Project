I find no rest under unfounded skies
For my torment was assigned for life
I attempt to grasp every drop of you within my hands
As I continue to encounter them
This is the place no one dare enter
A realm where a man should not roam alone
For if you do, you'll be consumed
I'm left to my own devices in the endless face of God
They return again and again
Leaving every empty space stained of red

Their veins reach the ends of the Earth

A familiar sight of horror to the untainted
As the innocent bodies contort
Tears and crimson pours near and far
A permanent change from human to a demon form
Shed of skin as they are reborn
The brand bleeds forevermore
The brand bleeds forevermore

Your thoughts are no longer your own
Swallow their souls
Tantalized by the scent of innocence
They must feed until there's nothing left
Terror in their eyes
This is fucking hopeless (Hopeless)
There is nothing left
