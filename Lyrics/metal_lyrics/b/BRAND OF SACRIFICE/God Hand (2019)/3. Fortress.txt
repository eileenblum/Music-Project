Defy eternity

Unhinged unashamed lives make red their dead
This is the end of the hundred year war
Unhinged unashamed glory received
Make red their dead and end the war

A vicious cycle repeats itself again and again
So prepare our souls for flight
Their bodies for the earth

Victory is what we seek out
Thousands of souls marching with the hawk of light
Death was never an enemy of ours
Death is not the enemy
Death is no longer the enemy

They will fear us forever
They will fear us forever
They will feel true pain
They will feel true pain

The cycle has come to an end and they suffered defeat
Were made to retreat
Controlled by blind belief
The silence of death is their only true resolution

Victory is what we achieved
Unhinged unashamed lives make red their dead
This is the end of the hundred year war
Unhinged unashamed glory received
Make red their dead and take over the kingdom

We will march with the hawk of light
Death was never an enemy of ours
Death is not the enemy
Death is no longer the enemy
We will march with the hawk of light
Death was never an enemy of ours
Death is not the enemy
Death is no longer the enemy
