Guardians of desire

We are the executors
Our reign is never ending (Never ending)
This is the day where the dark will eclipse light
And change the course of humankind
Activated by the beherit (Beherit)
Revoking our ties to mankind
We are supreme
Activated by the beherit

Reign over apostles as their masters
We wait for the falcon to rise (The begin of demise)
The king of longing begins (Begins) the new age
Oh

We are the God Hand, the God Hand
You will never be set free
This is the day where the dark will leave no man behind
No man behind

This is today's heinous end
We have no remorse
Witness is our forcing hand
For today, we take the world back
