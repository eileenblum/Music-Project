A heart no longer empty
When the light of the hawk came forth
The man who showed you potential
Inspired by the dream and his resolve
No longer bound by lust of your father
No longer held by the grip of another

But you remain under the spell of your lover
When all he wants is the crown, not what you have to offer

You remain ignorant to the acts that he commits
You are truly devoted
You are truly (Truly) devoted
On that night, he stood outside to repair his pride
You are truly devoted
You are truly devoted

You held on when the light was gone
He was sent for endless torture
Tongue removed, tendons cut
The hawk at his lowest low

A mere detour on the order of ascension
Fueled by anger and resentment
Only a shadow of his former self

But you remain under the spell of your lover
When all he wants is the crown, not what you have to offer

All a part of the dream (This life is not what it seems)
A detour on the order of ascension
All a part of the dream (This life is not what it seems)
A detour on the order of ascension

You remain ignorant to the acts that he commits
You are truly devoted
You are truly (Truly) devoted
On that night, he stood outside to repair his pride
You are truly devoted

The kingdom is in his clutches
Nothing can touch the invincible falcon
The world can't be yours
