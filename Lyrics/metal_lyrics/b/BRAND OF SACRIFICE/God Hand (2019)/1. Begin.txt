To realize the dream
I will perch on top of their corpses
No regrets, no remorse
This is a blood-smeared dream

To realize the dream
I will perch on top of their corpses
No regrets, no remorse
This is a blood-smeared dream

I ascend from this pile of corpses
I have shed my skin and become a part of the God Hand
This is the prophecy established (Established)
