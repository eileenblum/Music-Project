I'm so weary, so tired of this place
All the people so eager to join the death race
Foolish games have trapped my soul
The pains of suffering are taking their toll
Look into my eyes, catch a glimpse of Hell
But just to be free again, my soul I'd sell
I'm a prisoner of myself, my fear and my need
Just stick me with the death-needle 'cause I'll never be free

Blistering heat burns inside my head
But it'd be drowned by all the tears that I've shed
Tell me my name: let me know I'm alive
This place is so dark: I'm scared inside

I closed my eyes, let everything die
I walked through Heaven and I touched the sky

My days of Hell are soon gonna end
No more worry about you, or a job, or a friend
Life'd be so much easier if I were to die
So honey if you care, please tell me goodbye

I closed my eyes, let everything die
I walked through Heaven and I touched the sky

Someday you know you're gonna die and leave all things behind
There's days of blood and roses, buried deep within your mind
Have you thought of the newborn babies, born in this world of sorrow?
Or are you content to live life today without any worry of tomorrow
Oh lover, don't show your impartiality
You just don't know the burden of reality
Deathmaster calls, time to kiss you goodbye
But I'll see you in Hell when it's your turn to die
You're gonna die, baby: Yeah, you're gonna die
