You stand alone, hoping for a start
As she goes away, friends drift apart
You know, people have no reason to stay
People turn their heads and then walk away

Step down lower, into the grave
Step down lower, into the grave

But no one cares just about how you feel
'Cause the things you do are strange indeed
And you call out but no one is there
No one nearby, no one to care

And you met a life-long friend
But I think he'll leave you round the bend
He ain't what he seems to you today
Tomorrow he'll lead you to your grave

So you live all of your bloodshot dreams
But no longer hear your female screams
Death to some seems very bad
But death to you's the best friend you've ever had
