Come with me now, Child of darkness
Come with me into the night
Let me show you this land of enchantment
Let me be your guiding light

This world is dead: It's broken its back
But I can show you what's being done
It all lies now within your soul, girl
Use your mind and it will come
My child of darkness has given her gift
Of love and lust and burning desire
She lies now while the wind blows gently
Carrying her charms, set the night on fire
