In sleepless night I hear the thunder
I feel the dead hands round my neck
No telling what's this spell I'm under
I breathe a lifeless, icy breath

Someone help me look for what I'm after
I'm choking on the bad dream that I made
Just try and stop the evil laughter
Or there will be no one to save

Death's confusion, disillusion
And there'll be no one left to save
So if the driver's dressed in black
Tell him to drive me to the grave
