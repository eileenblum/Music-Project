Drifting in time for eternity and space
A timeless entity with no life, no place
In His afterlife which is death, nothing more
No one to share all the fates God bore

Man created God but time twisted men's minds
And they worshipped a being no one could find
Our savior will walk the earth again they say
But open your eyes and see if he comes your way

How insane are we, the Human Race
Serving and bowing to God in His place
Too many are blind to what lies ahead
They foolishly sit by and pray for the dead

But some came to realize what lies they'd believed
And the mask of "truth" Jesus wore was relieved
Their soul were reborn unto the Left-Hand-Path
Now all the others will bear Satan's wrath
