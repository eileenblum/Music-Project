Serpent venom's got into my blood
And the rush I'm getting through my soul, it floods
Fly me high, so high in the sky
I'll tell you how I feel as I kiss you goodbye

When the serpent's fang bites into my flesh
It's a feeling I want, I get, I relish
And I know that the serpent's ever so so so sly
As he grips and twists and twists at my side

I'm so high up in the sky
But the day's gonna come when I kiss you goodbye

Fang marks show all over my skin
I gotta keep others from where I've been
Don't do as I do: Do as I say
Nothing's so torturous as the serpent you obey
