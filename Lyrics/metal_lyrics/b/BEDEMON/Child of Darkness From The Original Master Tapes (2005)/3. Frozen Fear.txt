Time is short, death's growing near
Mind and body, frozen fear
Try to run, my legs are stiff
Mind and body are adrift

Try to run, try to hide
Pain is clutching at my side
Afraid to look, he calls my name
It's all a part of the dealer's game

My time is getting near
I'm crying... does no one hear?
Burning fire inside my head
I pay or I'll soon be dead

Paid money, now I'm well
For a while I'm out of this burning hell
I was blind but now I'm taught
The rest of my life must now be bought
