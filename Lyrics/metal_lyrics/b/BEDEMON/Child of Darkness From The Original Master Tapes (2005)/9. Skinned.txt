When you take the time to stop and think
That life is just a game
You realize it don't matter what you do
'Cause it all ends up the same

You live all your dreams and heartaches
Live all the joys of today
You know it can't mean a thing
'Cause life only ends one way

Just go on down the road alone
Come ever closer to your doom
Death's 'round the bend every day
And I'll seal the door to your tomb
