It's really too bad it had to turn out that way
What happened to the friends you thought you had yesterday
Now they have gone: they've always won
But you know they'll come back when they want some fun

They took you for a ride down a one-way road
They have no respect for feelings they owe
Now they have gone: they've always won
But you know they'll come back when they want some fun

They're knocking again at your front door
But the carpet's stained crimson where you lie on the floor
Now they have gone: they've always won
But you know they'll come back when they want some fun
