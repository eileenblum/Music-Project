Come on down to this place I know
I'll show you it has a very grand show
Locked behind bars, it keeps you sound
Are all of the beasts this race has found

Politicians and chemical men
Fed on lies and pollution again
Our government is as polluted as the air
But they can't care about your neighbor's despair
