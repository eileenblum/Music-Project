Got a girl on a high wire about to fall
A girl in the gutter with her back to the wall
A girl with no face, a girl with no name
No needing for love, she's just playing a game

You're a time bomb baby
It's getting ready to explode down a one-way road
You're a time bomb baby
Takin' away the time just a moment ago

I saw her again crawlin' down the street
Says she got friends that she wants me to meet

You're a time bomb baby
It's getting ready to explode down a one-way road
You're a time bomb baby
Takin' away the time just a moment ago

Up in her room, she strips off her clothes
She's made it so plain now everyone knows
A thousand needles have scarred her for life
And she's livin' in Hell as the Devil's wife
