Nighttime killers all glitter in gold
Makes you feel hot, makes you feel cold
Comes around in trance and time
All the burdens in life slowly grinds
Close your eyes and lay down and dream
Forget your worries: they ain't what they seem
A thousand faces all out in the street
With holes in their arms and holes in their feet
You are the ones who will die every night
For a little bit of heaven, for a taste of the light

Shut away the world, turn away the lies
Life is the cost, oblivion the prize
Your mind's corrupted, got no time to lose
Gotta keep movin', you gotta pay your dues
It's the end of the line, no need to ask why
Time to go home, time to lay down and die
Your blood is yellow, your mind is decayed
You know you got more than the devil to pay
