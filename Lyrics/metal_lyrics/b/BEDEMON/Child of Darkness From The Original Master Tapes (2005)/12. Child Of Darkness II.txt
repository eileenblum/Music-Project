Dark shapes entwined in the night so black
This woman before me lies on her back
Moonlight shines through the willow tree
Making shadows dance in the cool night breeze

My child of darkness lies still in the night
The candles about her bare little light
Her mouth locked open with that piercing scream
Of lifeless fantasy buried in her dream
No, she no longer comes my way
No longer cares how long she'll stay
The memory she left me to behold
Died within her, died within her soul
