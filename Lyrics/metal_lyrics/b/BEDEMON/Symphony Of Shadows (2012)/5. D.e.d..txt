There's a figure of fear standing in the rain
Tell me why have you come back again?

Can't live in misery
And can't let anyone see
The fear finally peels away
But I feel like I'm dying every day

As the needle slides in, the pain slides out
A little less human, a little more doubt

As the needle slides in, the pain slides out
A little less human, a little more doubt

The peace of darkness surrounds me every night
When daybreak returns there's a life-crushing light

No reason to go on
Don't care if I face another dawn
No wish for me to remain
Just want release from this misery and pain

Can't live in misery

Don't care if I face another dawn
No wish for me to remain
Just want release from this misery and pain
The fear finally peels away
But I feel like I'm dying every day
I feel like I'm dying every day
