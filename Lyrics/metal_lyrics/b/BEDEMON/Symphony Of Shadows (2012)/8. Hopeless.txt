Days of isolation, nights of loneliness
Consumed by thoughts of evil, filled with hopelessness
Life without a purpose, no reason to go on
Think I will find some angel I can prey upon

These are the voices inside my head
Driving me insane
Saw blade scraping 'cross my skull
Slicing deep into my brain

Kill meâI'm begging you
Kill meâyou don't know what I'm going through
Kill meâoh God please
Kill meâput me out of my misery

A cacophony of silence screams inside my mind
Commands me to go out and see what I can find
Clutching to my past, my future is in doubt
But in my present state of mind,
I must take some innocent young thing out

These are the voices inside my head
Driving me insane
Maggots boring through my skull
To feast upon my living brain

Kill meâI'm begging you
Kill meâyou don't know what I'm going through
Kill meâoh God please
Kill meâput me out of my misery
There are the days when I just stare into the sun and burn my eyes
And there are nights where I pray that I don't live to see the sun rise

I've got to find release from this pain
Think I'm going out of my mind
Bad thoughts are filling my brain
Evil voices, evil choices
I've got to find a way to escape
Afraid that I am losing control
I want to kill and torture and rape
Evil voices, evil choices

The answer is so clear ... I have found my release
The answer is so clear ... I have found my release
