Step into the booth, beauty that is youth
And tell him all your sins
And as you confess, you will never guess
Just where his mind has been
Kneel upon the floor, precious little whore
And look into his eyes
Your heart is filled with trust; he feels only lust
Raging deep inside

Fall to your knees
And swallow the sword
Prepare for release
From your saviour

Where is your protector? Does he see the danger
Watching from above?
How can he stand by, seeing angels cry
In his house of love
Dare not tell a soul; he is in control
Do just what he says to
Lay back, close your eyes; soon you'll realize
That God is deep inside you

Fall to your knees
And swallow the sword
Prepare for release
From your saviour

Who's your Messiah? What is his name?
Jesus or Satan? Who will you blame?
Saint or a sinner, Heaven or Hell
Which path will you choose for the soul that you sell?

Buried memories, causing misery
All throughout her life
A slutty fucked-up teen, drawn to men so mean
A hostile, frigid wife
And what about the saviour? Has he changed his ways?
And faced the awful truth?
"Father, I have sinned" ... "Then please, come right in
And kneel inside the booth"
