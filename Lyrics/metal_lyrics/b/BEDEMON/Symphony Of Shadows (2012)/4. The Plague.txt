The days are growing shorter, the nights are getting long
The light is slowly fading, the dark is growing strong
I fall into the shadows, I sink inside my mind
The plague is moving through me, I'm running out of time

The twilight turns to shadows, the stars obscured by night
The blackness grows around me and takes away my sight

I fall into the shadows, I sink inside my mind
The plague is moving through me, I'm running out of time
