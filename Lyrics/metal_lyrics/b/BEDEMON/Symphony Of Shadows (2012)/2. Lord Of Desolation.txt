Silence whispers across the land
Where evil has twisted the heart of man
Irradiated future is not the way
Chemical warfare makes everyone pay
Grinning rictus tolls the bell
Lonely souls now fall to hell
Figures in black will reign supreme
No one wakes from this infernal dream

Bodies rotting in the merciless sun
Unholy obliteration is finally done
With the stench of death everywhere
Even the war pigs no longer care
Now one lone figure surveys the blasted land
Life choked to death by man's own hand
Forget the screaming children and unmarked graves
Sacrifice is worth it; Think of the lives we saved

Lord of desolation
Lord of desolation
Lord of desolation
Lord of desolation
