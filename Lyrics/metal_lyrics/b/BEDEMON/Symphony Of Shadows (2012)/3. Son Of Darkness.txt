See the glowing eyes, burning in the night
Hear the earthly sighs, yearning for the light
A promise of salvation, facing desolation,
Now you know the pain of isolation.

Child of darkness, son of light
Cast in shadows, born of night
Will Mankind ever understand?
Who can know His master plan?
Son of darkness, child of light
Facing God's unholy plight
Pay up now or you'll suffer later
When you face the wrath of the Creator

The heavens parted with thunder and light
And centuries passed in blinding night
One lone figure died for you and me
But do you really feel he'll set us free?
