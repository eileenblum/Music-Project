Silver moon above, silver flash
Feel the power as he springs for attack
Crimson ribbon twisting in the air
You better start running and never look back
I see the blackened mist filling your eyes
Creeping darkness blots sun from the sky
Nowhere to turn; Starlight burns
And the end of days won't change his ways
Godless man
In a godless time
Ancient avenger
Rules the Circle of Nine

Silenced scream
Crushed velvet dream
Non one alive
Will ever escape this fate
The descending blade
You cannot evade
He grins
As he sees life evaporate

Facing your fears
See the urban decay
All the lonely years
And haunted days
Life turns to death
Under moonless skies
With one last breath
We watch you die
