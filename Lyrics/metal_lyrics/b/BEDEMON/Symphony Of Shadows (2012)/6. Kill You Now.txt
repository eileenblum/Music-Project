Prowling through the nighttime street
Watching you move from head to feet
Watchin' every move you make...
You slink around, don't even smile
Knowing I want you all the while
Yes, you know I want you...

I want you now; I need you now
I love you now; I kill you now

All razor eyes and flashing teeth
You're pure animal underneath
Like a savage beast...
Vicious heart pounding, hear me growl
Can't wait no moreâthe time is now
Don't you know the time is now

I want you now; I need you now
I love you now; I kill you now

Surrender baby and stab my heart
I always loved you from the start
Always loved you from the start
Hurricane fury and blackened sky
The time is now for you to die
You know you're gonna die

I kill you now; I kill you now
I kill you now; I kill you now
