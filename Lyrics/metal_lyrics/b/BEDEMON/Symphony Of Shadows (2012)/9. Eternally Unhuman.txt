Listen â close â you can hear it
Now you better learn to fear it
All consuming hunger terrifies
Unseen menace liquefies

Scrape the flesh right off your bone
Now you learn how to die alone
Once it walked as you and I
'Til humanity perished inside
There was only one thing left;
Instantaneous death
In an earlier incarnation
It had a soul, imagination
A face and a name
Now nothing will ever be the same

They should have known
Leave it all alone
Before everything human
Was taken away
By the power of darkness
When night consumes the day
Night consumes the day...
Now they turn...aside
Try to run...and hide
No one will attempt to resist
Just ignore it all
This man can no longer exist
Now he's eternally unhuman
