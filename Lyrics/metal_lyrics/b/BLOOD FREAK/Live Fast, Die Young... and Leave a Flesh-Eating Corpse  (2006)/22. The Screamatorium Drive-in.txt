I'm locked up, and ready to die,
Why you ask, I have no reason why
I'm trapped inside this morbid place,
The doctors all think I'm just a mental case

But I know things that will disturb and shock,
So sit down and relax, this tale will really rock!!!
I went to the drive-in with my new blind date,
She thought I was a dork, and had nothing but hate
Who cares, because I came here for the gore,
'Blood Freak' was playing, this film's never a bore

she annoyed me til the film the film was at an end,
by that time, her neck I wanted to bend
No appreciation for cheese-horror-splatter,
I flipped her off, ate more food and got fatter

Some friends of mine appeared from the Razorback Hive
Nic Slasherhead and the Goregnome named Sly,
My date was pissed off, so Worm Face ate her leg,
She made a terrible sound, and then really began to beg

This horrified the people, they yelled and started to freak,
From out of nowhere, came Turkey Monster with his beak
Started pecking on their necks, drinking their blood
As soon as you know it, the ground was a giant red flood

Nic Slasherhead ordered the 'Slaughter Special' with fries
Doctor Bitch operated on some losers until they all died,
And hey, this story would not be complete'
Without the Mucouspewing Lungslasher, he really loves to eat!!!

Total madness broke out, it was extremely surreal
Now the icing on the cake' the Butchermobile!!!
It ran over some idiots, and crushed them til death
I enjoyed this the most, until I ran out of breath

The Screamatorium Drive-in, I'll never forget my adventures
I'm now completely insane, toothless, and need dentures
A drooling freak for life, with all the straight-jacketed dorks
But I'll never forget 'LIVE FAST DIE YOUNG AND LEAVE A FLESH-EATING CORPSE!!!'
