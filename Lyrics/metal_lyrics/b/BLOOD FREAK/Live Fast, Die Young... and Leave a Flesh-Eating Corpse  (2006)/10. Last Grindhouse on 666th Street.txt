It appeared out of thin air,
A cursed theatre playing movies that were rare
'Almost Human', 'The Devil inside Her', 'Forced Entry',
the most depraved flix that were once just a memory

it stinks of urine, booze, and popcorn
while the projector cranks out
twisted horror and sleaze-porn
'Cannibal Girls' and Meatcleaver Massacre' are playing
tonight, fucked my girl in the bathroom
and then grabbed a bite

[Chorus:]
Trapped in here like fools,
This place has no rules,
Bottom of the barrel is such a treat,
We rule the night- at The Last Grindhouse on 666th Street!!!

Bone-crushing action double features,
Exploitation, axe-whacking and alien creatures
No, we're not crazy ' we don't give two shits
Bet out of the way, you're blocking the Goretits

Triple-X roughies, eurotrash and gore,
We never want to leave, put a lock on the door
Slashers, backwoods terror, and roller derby chicks,
We love'em cheap and get pissed when they're slick
