Beware of the yeti,
He'll mangle your brain into spaghetti
Don't believe it's a hoax,
The more you try to hide the sooner you'll croak

Shriek Of The Mutilated!!!
Snowbeast butchery

Tied up to a tree as bait for the beast,
It comes out from the mist to begin its rancid feast
The students quest for the truth shall lead to a violent end,
As it eats your flesh, your spine it shall bend
