There's a creature that lurks, so listen up you jerks
A tale so shocking, you'll start rockin' like dokken!

Born of someone's idea of using nuclear waste infected sperm,
This thing was born out of someone's grotesque little germ
Instead of being human, all that came out was a lung,
But nobody wanted it so they took it and flung

All alone it sat to rot,
People would walk by and spit their phlegm
It felt hatred and anger,
And knew one day it would kill all of them
One day it started to grow
Into a giant lumbering slimebeast,
The time came for this freak to begin it's human feast

[Chorus:]
The Mucouspewing Lungslasher,
This mutated offspring disaster!
The Mucouspewing Lungslasher,
Don't worry ' he's also a GrindGore Thrasher!

It hitched a ride in the butchermobile,
I dropped it off near the lake
It attacked 30 people, and feasted on them like it was steak
Like a fly hacks up mucous all over before it eats,
There's something about this method that makes it all the more sweet.

Checking out the carnage, the people they fled,
Because all of them knew that they soon would be dead,
This giant chunky gorebeast makes life worth living,
He's sick, also thoughtful, generous, and giving

One day I'll control this creature,
And make it the star of my upcoming feature'

[Chorus:]
The Mucouspewing Lungslasher,
This tale is beyond gory!
The Mucouspewing Lungslasher,
Based on a true story!
