At the far horizon dust clouds appear
Hogs of steel on a mission of revenge
Their mighty engines roar with rage
The drunk warriors scream in a drug-craze

Clad in denim and leather armour
Running over some peasants and farmers
Stolen wenches by a cult of the damned
Prepared to be sacrificed to their main man

[Chorus:]
Full Moon Sacrifice
Full Moon Sacrifice

Eerie glow permeates the darkened forest
Big pits of fire and chanting minions
The biker up front spots the Satanic orgy
They swing around the trees and crash the party

Some wenches saved but some already dead
Draped on the gnarly altar of dread,
From the fire pit, a portal rises
In comes Satan to everybody's surprise

Gruff looking biker hits the chanting main monk
Kicks him in the nuts and grabs his evil book
Flips through the pages, the 'Turkey Monster' it is
Starts to chant 'Gobble Gobble', the last thing he hears

His flesh transforms and his skin melts off
Growing a beak, 'Gobble Gobble' he shouts
Satan versus Turkey Monster, the fight is on!!!
Between the carnage and the chaos

[Chorus:]
Full Moon Sacrifice
Full Moon Sacrifice

People erupting in fountains of blood
Orgy of violence, when will it stop??
Bikers and Satanists die left and right
Suddenly Satan and Turkey quit the fight

Both look around and see nobody is left
Turkey Monster grabs a beer as
Satan resurrects a hot biker slut
They grab a bike and both ride off in the sunset!!
