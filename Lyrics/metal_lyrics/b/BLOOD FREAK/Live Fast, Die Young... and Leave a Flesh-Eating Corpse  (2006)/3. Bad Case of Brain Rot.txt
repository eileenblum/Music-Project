I've seen the future of horror and it's all on DVD,
'Basket Case' and 'Inferno', give them all to me
I want 'The Gore Gore Girls',
'Swamp of the Ravens' amd 'Squirm',
If you don't let me I'll stomp you like a little worm

My mind is racing with images of splatter,
The more you give me, the more my life will matter.
My brain cells are deteriorating faster
Than you can say 'shit', but it doesn't matter
As long as this next slasher flick has bare tits

[Chorus:]
Bad Case of Brain Rot
I need more dvd's, not a little a lot!
Bad Case of Brain Rot
Blood looks better on disc, not beta-snot!

Look what I just got! 'Mad Doctor of Blood Island'!
Collection up to 500, leaving all you posers behind!
Tomorrow I'm getting 'Night of the Bloody Apes',
Now I have 600 and you losers only have VHS tapes!
