It started out as a holiday roast
Just family and friends ' nothing to boast
Dad at the grill with his apron and tongs
Jenny and Linda in their gaudy pink thongs
Mom is in kitchen basting the pork
While the neighbor pops open the champagne cork
Hamburgers, hot dogs, ketchup and slaw
An all American feast ' stuff your gaping maw!!!

Now into the yard comes an uninvited guest
Try as he might, he can't blend in with the rest
A boning knife in his left hand, a hook in his right
This psychotic killer looks to liven up the night

He smells really bad and has worms for hair,
This backwoods looking freak really causes quite a scare

[Chorus:]
Summoning up his minions to attack and kill,
He's kept alive only by his black will
Say goodbye to the human race
Now you gonna be the Worm-face!!!!

Dad tries to fight, but he's taken down early
Whimpering as he's gutted, he seems a bit girly
The killer attacks in 180 degree turns
And moms flying torso lands on the grill and burns

Quartered and cubed, filleted and saut'ed
Jenny's life's blood ' sweeter than Gatorade
Linda was fat ' she'd always eaten well
Now she can low-carb with Dr. Atkins in hell

The massacre is over, but it's only just begun
The entire world will tremble, don't try to run
The executioner has arrived, now you will fear
His army of worms growing, domination is near!!!
