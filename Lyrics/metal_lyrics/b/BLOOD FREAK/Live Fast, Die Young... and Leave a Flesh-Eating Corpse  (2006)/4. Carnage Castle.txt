Late at night, they shall strike
Believe the warning, you won't make it to morning
Shrieks carry through the wind,
How long have they sinned?
For centuries the blood flows in rivers,
You're up all night in shivers

[Chorus:]
Carnage Castle!- lunatics, monsters, and freaks
Carnage Castle!- diabolic totures and rotting meat
Carnage Castle!- terror and doom in your brain it rests
Carnage Castle!- the horrors put your fear to the test

In the dark of night when you think you're safe and sound,
The creatures come creeping
From the graves beneath the ground
No holy weapon stops it from its entrance to your home,
Not god nor man can stop it
When it feasts upon your bones

Their methods are crude, their procedures are unlawful
They believe there's a 'benefit without anesthesia'
No need for any scalpel, jagged hatchets will do fine
After their daily duties, on human brains they'll dine
These freak fucks perform 'miracles' everyday,
Inflicting lobotomies as they whack and slice away

[Chorus:]
Carnage Castle!- this place begins to reek
Carnage Castle!- escape and freedom you seek
Carnage Castle!- the ultimate Frightmare!
Carnage Castle!- the flesh from your neck they begin to tear

The mutants strike from behind their masks
Deranged minds, preparing sadistic tasks
Another all-nighter of human slaughter
The screams at midnight could be your daughter!
