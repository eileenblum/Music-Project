Four young teenagers on a trip to hell,
An unknown ghost town is the place they seek,
Sandy stares out of the window with glee,
Their vacation will be no day at the beach

Settle on in at the run down hotel,
Wheelchair bound old lady, face full of drool
6pm meal at the sound of the bell,
Tales of terror await, the mutants that dwell!!!

[Chorus:]
Axe of Violence!!!
Axe of Violence!!!
The slaughter shall soon commence!!!

We villagers fear the awesome might of these freaks,
Whenever someone dies in fear do we speak,
Piles of bodies building up day by day,
Night time massacres at an all time peak

[Chorus:]
Axe of Violence!!!
Axe of Violence!!!
There is no defense!!!

Sandy laughs at the story, what a fool
Wanders out to the cemetery with her boyfriend Raul,
A pile of bones and freshly chopped head,
You're not very bright, you're about to be dead!!!!
