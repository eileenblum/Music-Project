Cruising around in the butchermobile, I feel like a god
Hacking away at fat, wretched slobs
You make me angry, I'll chop-chop away,
Prepare to meet my meatcleaver and a 30 ft. arterial spray!

[Chorus:]
30 ft. arterial spray,
With gore shooting upwards all fools shall pay!
30 ft. arterial spray
leaving you a stump really makes my day!

I'm out in the woods with a hammer and knife,
Hunting fresh victims who look juicy, plump and ripe
All day long I dream of oozing, glistening gore,
God damn I can't need more, more and more!

[Chorus:]
30 ft. arterial spray,
blood-pumping jet stream is the only way!
30 ft. arterial spray,
I'm a fucked up gorehound, what more can I say?
