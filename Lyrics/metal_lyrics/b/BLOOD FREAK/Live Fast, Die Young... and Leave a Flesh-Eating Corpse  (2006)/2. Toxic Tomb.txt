There's this place at the bottom of hell,
A dungeon of horrors that I know very well
Horror DVD worshipping freaks,
And so many more
Reclusive mutants who crave violence and the obscure,
They show films that are rare and have never been seen,
One sample if this stuff would make others feel weak,
But you're brave, insane, and you listen to BLOOD FREAK!

[Chorus:]
Horror loving maniacs sent to their doom!
You'll never want to leave here!
Enter the toxic tomb!
Blood drenched delights you need to consume!
You'll also want to die here!
Enter the toxic tomb!

Just Before Dawn on repeated play,
That movie kicks some ass,
Frightmare are playing in the background,
They really fucking Thrash!
Worm Face is here, GoreGnome and Maniac Neil,
Impetigo turned up real loud which makes your flesh peel
Night of the Demons on surround sound causes earthquakes,
You gotta get down here no matter what it takes!
Let the Turkey Monster take you on the guided tour,
Try to get 'in' with Dr. Bitch, the ultimate gore-whore!

[Chorus:]
Go nuts in this splatter playroom!
What are you waiting for?
Enter the toxic tomb!
When you hear the butchermobile's 'vroom',
Get  ready to enter the toxic tomb!

[DOOM MOSH PART:]
if you can't handle this place,
fifty freaks will rip off your face!
If you tell us what to fucking do,
Lord Turkey will beat you black and blue!

The Toxic Tomb rules, now live by its law
Disagree and get punched in the jaw!
Toxic Tomb will give meaning to your life,
Now here you fool, kill yourself with this knife!
