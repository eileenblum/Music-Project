Racing down the road,
In a street machine of splatter,
Running you down is all that fucking matters!
Got my foot pinned to your skull,
Not splattering makes life dull!
Ripping around I love to make this thing peel,
Get ready you jerks, here comes the butchermobile!

[Chorus:]
Butchermobile, butchermobile
I'll run you over and make you my meal
Butchermobile, butchermobile
Your guts look great smashed under my wheel

It's equipped with blades,
Knives, and a circular saw
When it crushes a body
You know GrindGore is the law
It uses human blood as gas
And always needs more,
This kick ass thing
Measures a 10 on the Gore score!

[Chorus:]
Butchermobile, butchermobile
Look out for death when the tires squeal
Butchermobile, butchermobile
The wonderful thud of your bones against steel

You loose total consciousness
When you hit 4-wheel drive,
My road trip is complete
And now it's back to the HIVE!!
