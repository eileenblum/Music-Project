One dark misty night,
a glow lit up the sky
over a quiet redneck town
The blaze was a spacecraft
with a deadly secret within
A fiend with silver dress
and a face all yellowish brown
This terror from beyond is now loose,
the hunt can now begin!
The horror stumbles through the night
to find his first piece of meat
Some redneck boys out on a hunt
would make a tasty treat!
Armed with a laser gun
that shoots red neon glow
Who can stop this beast,
please let me know
An incompetent sheriff
and his brain-dead redneck buffoons?
Against the monster that kills
in the pale light of the moon
The creature will shred them to pieces,
with a horrible laugh!
With his Razor-sharp claws
and crooked fangs he'll rip them in half!
If you have the guts, He wants them!
He'll rip you apart with a shriek!
The sheriff and his boys
evacuates the town
While shooting at the creature
that won't go down
It's a horrible, laughable sci-fi retribution
A cheap 80s, trashy horror revolution!
