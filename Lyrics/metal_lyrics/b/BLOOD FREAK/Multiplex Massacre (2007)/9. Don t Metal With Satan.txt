Cindy was just a "metal chick",
dressed like a slut, pretended to be "sick"
She listened to Venom, Slayer,
and Frightmare
owned them all on vinyl
because it was "rare"
In school she fucked all the boys
Breaking their hearts was one of her joys
At night she'd go to all the local shows,
smoked dope, drank beer,
and continued to pose
The distro table had LP's on sale,
this bitch would never
order through the mail
The seller split to take a leak,
while Cindy grabbed
and stole the new Blood Freak
She hung out more
and snorted lines of coke,
gave blowjobs and received a good poke
Unaware of the danger ahead,
soon Cindy would be just a puddle of red
Back at home to spin the Blood Freak LP,
playing with herself while tripping on LSD
Turkey Monster visions
dancing in her brain,
Cindy starts freaking and going insane
Out of her mind
she plays the record backwards,
the sound summons Satan
right out of her innards
She falls to the floor, her entrails blasted
Satan has come
to eat some fucking acid!
666 is his number,
the king of all evil is here
He lives by his own rules,
while you all live in fear
Human souls are a treat,
but nothing beats a good trip
Get him some god damn acid,
or someone's face he will rip
