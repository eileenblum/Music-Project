Downtown in a stripper bar,
a creepy guy watched some jugs
in amazing awe
perfect and round and jiggled in synch,
hypnotized by the nipples
and soft skin.
He went home and started dreaming,
perfect breast and cleavage screaming
obsessed he started to make his plan,
cleavage cleaver I must, I can.
on the prowl in the cold winter night
he started to stalk the girls of the site,
trapped and killed 'em one by one
searching for this perfect one.
Cleaved the cleavage,
hacked off the tits,
the bloody carnage to get his fix,
cleavage glistening and gleaming
in the warm hot blood,
but each time he didn't get
the one he sought.
frustrated and angry
his dreams kept on haunting,
jiggling perfect breasts
in his face and taunting.
On his wall he hung his collection
sewed up and stuffed like
some morbid pillows.
More and more but it wasn't enough
Cleavage Cleaver!
The Cleavage Cleaver!
I must have the perfect ones
then I can stop.
one night it rained and
unexpected there they were,
hidden under a tight little shirt,
perky and juicy her nipple sticking out,
stalking her all the way home
he started peeping into her home
in her bedroom when she undressed
he watched her boobies
jiggled and danced
as if they were magic
after she went into the shower
he jimmied the lock and creeped inside.
Where was the little tramp hiding tonight?
he peeked around the door
and saw her soaping up her breasts,
they would be his,
his search would end tonight.
Cleavage Cleaver!
