The bright sun goes slowly down
and the sky turns black
As our boat arrives and comes
ashore on the beach
I enter with caution
and am shown to my shack
And as night falls
I hear the native speech
The sound of their drums fills the night
I approach their place of sacrifice
And what I saw
gave me a horrifying fright
Two virgins ready
to pay the ultimate price
As offerings to the Blood Island Curse
Struck with terror
I turn and run into the dark
in the jungle that's alive
I stumbled on something worse
I woke up in a laboratory
beneath the earth
The mad doctor comes
to see me with a ghastly grin
And he tells me of his scientific work
Chlorophyll is injected
and I feel the pain within
As my body transforms
into this hideous mistake
I feel the pain of my remains dying away
My corpse on the table
convulses and shakes
When I regain consciousness
I lust for human prey
With my newfound taste for flesh
I drag my green misshapen feet
into the night
The sound of the village drums
can still be heard
And now I know of the
ghastly island curse
My hunger for flesh
and blood seems absurd
I stumble through the dark,
the village is in for something worse
At the altar I see the virgins hung up as
an offering to me
My body goes wild
and my blood starts to boil
As I rip the naked girls to shreds in a
savage killing spree
Stripping tender flesh from their bones,
slurping down fresh blood
When the night turns into day
the natives sees my work
The Jungle floor is filled with corpses,
severed heads and entrails
The sight of mangled torsos
tells them I'm gone berserk
Now they know there is truth
to all their ghastly tales
Has now come to life
and the onslaught has just begun
The bright sun goes slowly down
and the sky turns black
As the new boat arrives
and comes ashore on the beach
The newcomers enter with caution
and are shown to their shack
And as night falls
they hear the native speech
The sound of their drums fills the night
The newcomers approach
the place of sacrifice
And what they saw was a terrifying sight
Vacation here on Blood Island
is filled with Thrills, Chills,
and Blood Spills!
