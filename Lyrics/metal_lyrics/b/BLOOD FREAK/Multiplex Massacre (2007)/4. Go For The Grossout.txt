Nobody wanted to listen
when we said this was for real,
Sold our souls to horror and
then sealed the deal
You laughed in our faces
and really pissed us off,
now Blood Freak is still killing
while you die weak and soft
We melt horror DVD's into liquid,
and shoot it into our veins,
We're socially retarded
and completely insane!
In the Toxic Tomb, we all rot away
Watching horror 24 hours a day
Our drive-in metal is what it's all about,
We go for the kill - We Go For The
Grossout!
It breaks my heart to see
where the horror genre is heading,
I'm taking out my anger at the
multiplex with some violent beheading,
I crash the Butchermobile into
the brick wall,
Dynamite strapped to my body,
I'm here to kill and have a ball
These losers are watching some
new CGI gore-fest,
I blow up the projection screen
to put an end to this bore-fest
All these geeks got suckered
by Fangoria's latest hype job,
I'm here to destroy and cut
them all into shishkabob
Don't try to tell me that this
new crap is any good,
If you do I'll break all your bones
and use them for firewood
Another fucking remake and
a shitty sequel to boot
Hollywood will be taught a lesson,
this multiplex massacre - a tribute!
Everyone gather around the
table for a grand feast,
The TURKEY is hungry and
it's time for roast human-beast
with Cannibal Holocaust and
Texas Chainsaw on in the background,
tonight we're gonna party and
celebrate being gorehounds!
Dial the number and order
blood-sauce pizza with meat-eyeballs,
take a sip from a 30 Ft.Aterial Spray
that will splatter all the walls
Don't forget The Slaughter Special
with salted and fried human skin,
then sit your asses down and
let our feeding rituals begin!
Worm Face is starving - 
throw him a bone!
Satan wants acid, so leave him alone
the Lungslasher wants
Afterbirth-day Cake,
you'd better get it for your own sake
Doctor Bitch got blood splashed
on her tits,
now you've got her mad - 
she'll cut you to bits!
Turkey Monster likes what he sees,
he's master
of this kingdom of horror-hungry zombies!
