A child is scarred for life
as he sees the act of the geek
Biting heads off chickens,
he's a bizarre sideshow freak
The crowd goes wild at the sights of gore
Praising the creep
and screaming for more
The young child gets
his small teeth smashed
His little mouth is violently trashed
A new geek is born
from this moment of pain
The boy grows older,
and has murder on his brain
Released from the asylum
where he's been all his life
Armed with metal teeth
that are sharp as a knife!
He attacks random people
out on the street
Their flesh seems
like a good thing to eat!
Poultry Pervert!
A truly bizarre sideshow attraction
Poultry Pervert!
This geek bites heads off
with extreme satisfaction
You'll come on home, you'll all alone
There's no one here you need to fear
You hear a cluck, what the fuck?
There are no chickens in my home
But there he is, that twisted freak
He'll peck out your eyes
with his weird metal beak!
A truly disturbed poultry lunatic
The sight of flesh will make him go frantic
