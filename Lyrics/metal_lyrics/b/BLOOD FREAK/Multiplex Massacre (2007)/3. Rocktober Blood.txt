Recording one night was a terrible sight.
A spilling of blood begins,
forcing my knife through your skin
Going berserk, slaughtering you jerks
Killing so many, carnage is a plenty.
Blood on my hands, Metal is so grand
Punishment is deserved,
an execution is reserved
Rainbow Eyes wished to be a star
She sounds like shit and won't go too far
Rock-Tober-Blood!
Where nothing is what it seems
As if it's all a dream!
Rock-Tober-Blood!
Where nothing remained the same
Enough to make you go insane!
Bitch started a tour, because
she's such a whore
Singing the music I gave,
it's upsetting my grave
This is blasphemy,
prepare for a catastrophe
You thought I fried, for all my crimes
But I did not die, my Rainbow Eyes
Two years after, comes
a blood-soaked disaster
I arrive at your show,
the body count was so low
Here comes metal and gore,
to end this stupid bore
Rock-Tober-Blood!
Where nothing is what it seems
As if it's all a dream!
Rock-Tober-Blood!
Where nothing remained the same
Enough to make you go insane!
A dismembered head, something is dead
Blood and guts, the crowd goes nuts
This show, no one will forget,
the killings I will not regret
