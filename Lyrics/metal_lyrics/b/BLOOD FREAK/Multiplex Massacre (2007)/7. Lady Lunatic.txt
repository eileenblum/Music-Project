She came from Carnage Castle,
and has looks that kill,
Wine from a skull-shaped goblet
is her favorite swill
She bathes in human blood,
and wears a black gown of bones,
She takes skeletons and
carves them into tombstones
Lady Lunatic,
You're really quiet sick!
Lady Lunatic
A fucking psycho-chick!
She travels looking for trouble,
at midnight she really comes to life,
When she seduces you,
You die slowly by her knife
She has bloodlust and rage
that she cannot control,
When your juices are drained,
Your corpse is left
for charcoal
Lady Lunatic,
nothing can stop you!
Lady Lunatic,
Who else will you kill and screw?
She's in league with Satan
and is driven by hell and sin,
when the sun sets you wait for her
and the Frightmare to begin...
