You fucked with the Scars,
and now they're really pissed,
Thought it was a prank but now
you're on Jake's shit-list
Brenda and the Satins were
only out for some kicks,
Got into trouble and really
pissed off those pricks
Red meets Brenda's mute sister
Heather at the high-school gym,
Fargo and Vince gang-rape her
and turn the story downbeat and grim
Brenda's best friend Francine
is pregnant and engaged,
Gets tossed off a bridge which
leaves you shocked and outraged
"here comes the bride,
and she's all drenched in red"
Soon the Scars will
all be fucking dead!
They raped her sister
and killed her best friend,
It's time for revenge and
bring the Scars to an end
Ultra-violence, sleaze
and cheesy rock-beats,
Get ready to fight in
the SAVAGE STREETS!
That wimp Vince cries like a pussy
and tells Brenda the living-nightmare
He gets run over by Jake's
convertible '57 Belair
Brenda arms herself with
bear-traps and a crossbow,
dresses up in black leather,
and prepares the ultimate death blow
The Scars are teased and
then violently killed
Jake is torched and burned,
Brenda's vengeance is fulfilled!
