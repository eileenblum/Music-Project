Now my backs against the wall,
I've had all I can take
My emotions deep inside like a dam will break
I need to breathe, someone to watch over me
Life is on the line and there's no time

I'm living the war not like you
Rolling thunder passing through
I need a way to conquer the pain
Cause I've heard the bombs and I felt the heat of the flame

Shell Shock
We fight we die, We don't ask why
We fight we die, Be it truth or lie!

No one seems to understand all
that we go through
But the enemy is marching forward
survivals what I do
And I need to breathe,
someone to watch over me
Life is on the line that life is mine

I'm living the war not like you
Rolling thunder passing through
Will you help me conquer the pain?
Cause I've heard the bombs
and I felt the heat of the flame

Shell shock
We fight we die, We don't ask why
We fight we die, Be it truth or lie!

They say it's wrong, they say it's right
I am just fighting the fight
Try not to die everyday
But I know what I'm fighting for.

This mighty nation sent me
here my duty to obey
When I come home after war
what will this nation say?
You need to keep the promises
you made to me
Honor on the line all the time!

I'm living the war not like you
Rolling thunder passing through
Will you help me conquer the pain?
Cause I've heard the bombs
and I felt the heat of the flame
Shell Shock
