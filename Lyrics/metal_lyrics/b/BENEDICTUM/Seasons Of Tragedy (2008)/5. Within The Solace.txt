We must find the truth that lies within the solace
Kingdoms rise and fall riches can leave you lonely
But everything you say
I see a different way
There is a price to pay,
vengeance is mine

And everything you do,
I scrutinize it through
You had a chance to choose,
vengeance is mine

Speak your highest thought your words
often define you
We could have had it all,
make straight the path before you

But everything you say
I see a different way
There is a price to pay,
vengeance is mine
vengeance is mine

And everything you do,
I've got to see it through
You had a chance to choose,
vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine

There's a dark cloud coming
And it rains on you
There's a dark cloud coming
Rain!

There's a dark cloud coming
And it rains on you
There's a dark cloud coming
Rain!

But everything you say
I see a different way
There is a price to pay,
vengeance is mine

And everything you do,
I scrutinize it through
You had a chance to choose,
vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine!
