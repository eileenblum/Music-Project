Too many slaves in this world
Die by torture and pain
Too many people do not see
They're killing themselves, going insane

Too many people do not know
Bondage is over the human race
They believe slaves are always lose
And this fear keeps them down

Watch the damned â God bless ya
They're gonna break the chains
No, you can't stop them â God bless ya
They're coming to get you

And then you'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall â Balls to the wall

You may screw their brains
You may sacrifice them too
You may mortify their flesh
You may rape them all

One day the tortured stand up
And revolt against the evil
They make your drink your blood
And tear yourself to pieces

You better watch the damned â God bless ya
They're gonna break the chains
No, you can't stop them â God bless ya
They're coming to get you

And then you'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall â Balls to the wall

Here we go!

Come on man, let's stand up all over the world
Let's plug a bomb in everyone's ass
If they don't keep us alive
We're gonna fight for the right

Build a wall with the bodies, and you're saved
Make the world scared
Come on, show me the sign of victory
Sign of victory â Sign of victory

You better watch the damned â God bless ya
They're gonna break the chains
No, you can't stop them â God bless ya
They're coming to get you

You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall â Balls to the wall

You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
