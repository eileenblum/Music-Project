Tonight I kick it over face
into the wind
I ride, I fire it up,
precision feels like sin

I want it faster,
wheels to the ground!

Release the fire
Burn it out
Ignite Desire
Burn it out

Decide servant or master,
destiny awaits
I ride into disaster
destruction in my wake

I want it faster,
wheels to the ground

Release the fire
Burn it out
Ignite Desire
Burn it out

I want it faster,
wheels to the ground
I want it faster,
wheels to the ground

Release the fire
Burn it out
Ignite Desire
Burn it out

Clandestine ire
Burn it out
Release the fire
Burn it out!!!
