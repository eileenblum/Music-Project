I try to stay in syncopation
With the pace of life I know
I tell myself that time in time
As above it is below
I see my life I wonder is it all that I could ever be
And then I feel my fire as I roar like thunder

I've needed, I've seeded
The clouds that bring to me
Steel rain
Steel rain

Forever searching for the answers
to questions asked of old
And when I turn to see the wisdom
all I find is I don't know
I see my life I wonder is this
all that I was meant to be
But then I feel that fire
as I roar like thunder

I've needed, I've seeded the clouds
that bring to me
Steel rain
Steel rain
Dark clouds are forming again
Steel rain
Steel rain
Catch the wind as it sails again
like an arrow through my heart
Love and pain evolve the same
and its tearing me apart

Steel rain
Steel rain
Dark clouds are forming again
Steel rain
Steel rain
Dark clouds are forming again

Frozen are my tears
Steel rain
Frozen are my tears
Steel rain
Steel rain
Dark clouds are forming again
Steel rain

I try to stay in syncopation
With the pace of life I know
I tell myself that time in time
As above it is below
