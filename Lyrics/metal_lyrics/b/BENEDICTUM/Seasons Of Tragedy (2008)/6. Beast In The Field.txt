There's a beast I the field there's a lion in the night
Ever stalking with a passion every hiding from the light
And his name is the only and his name is the one
And he won't stop destroying till his wicked work is done

Children run, children run, children run
The night time is falling the voices are calling
A beast there's a beast in the field

The world keeps on turning but we are not learning a beast there's a
beast in the field

There's a beast
There's a beast

There's a beast in the field there's a loin in the night
Overcome by our weakness we have not strength to fight
Time to run little children better run better flee for the beast
that I speak of is alive roaming free

Children run, children run, children RUN!!!!!

The night time is falling the voices are calling
A beast there's a beast in the field
The whole world is turning but we are not learning a beast there's a
beast in the field

Don't look into his eyes
For fools confound the wise

This deranged dark usurper tears the fabric of the soul
Look upon your own person now is half what was whole
The most primal of instincts is to stand fight or flee
At this time I beseech you to make haste come with me
Approaching encroaching it lives a lie
Controlling imposing it will take your life!

The night time is falling the voices are calling
A beast there's a beast in the field
The world keeps on turning but we are not learning a
beast there's a beast in the field
