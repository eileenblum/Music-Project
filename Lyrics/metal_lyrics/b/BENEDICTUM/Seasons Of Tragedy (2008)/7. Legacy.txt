As I close my eyes visions come to me
Like a whispered prayer, soft and low.
Beckoning to me to change reality
Enter deeper still into the soul

Still I cry!

What will I become? What will become of me?
Am I just a pawn played by destiny?
Inward turn the eyes and outward shine the soul
Mind and heart as one, become whole

This is my legacy
That which is born of me (still I cry)
This is my legacy Cry!

Somewhere in the world someone's crying out
Trapped inside the darkness a prisoner of doubt
Somewhere in the world someone screams in pain
Will you dare to answer how can you remain
Somewhere in the world someone's crying out
Trapped inside the darkness a prisoner of doubt

This is my legacy
That which is born of me (still I cry)
This is my legacy Cry!

May your light shine bright like the nova sun
And be remembered still for the things you've done
May they speak of you with integrity
As you leave behind your last legacy

Still I cry
This is my legacy
That which is born of me (still I cry)
This is my legacy Cry!

Somewhere in the world someone's crying out
Trapped inside the darkness a prisoner of doubt
Somewhere in the world someone screams in pain
Will you dare to answer how can you remain
Somewhere in the world someone's crying out
Trapped inside the darkness a prisoner of doubt
