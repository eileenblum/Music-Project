Gates before me wide open, hastily I proceed
The white owl of winter perched high above me
Spreading wide wings of wisdom
Eyes look through me like glass
Let go of the pain of the past

Deep in your heart you must believe
You can find your humanity
Dare to believe there is relief
From the Seasons of Tragedy

Floating freely in rhythm
Tis the sparrow of Spring
Hope resonates with each beat of the wing
Every moment is precious life's too short to lament
Rise over sorrow, forward on and then
And then

Deep in your heart you must believe
You can find your humanity
Dare to concede there is relief
From the Seasons of Tragedy

Torrid passions all my actions make me who I am
Barren lands of the summer seemingly void of life
Till the raven descended blackened as ice
Life is always abounding though the eye cannot see
Beyond all our senses there's more just believe!

Soaring over the landscape mastering all she surveys
Autumn's sage Eagle appears from the haze
You must fly ever higher, triumph over the mind
Master your thoughts and the world will align
Deep in your heart you must believe
You can find your humanity
Dare to believe there is relief
From the Seasons of Tragedy
Aah ah seasons of tragedy
Ah oh Season of Tragedy!!

Were it not for this passage through this life I have lead with its
pain and its sorrow than I would not have had
This victory... would not have had this victory...VICTORY!
Winter is gone and springtime comes anon and on and on and on
