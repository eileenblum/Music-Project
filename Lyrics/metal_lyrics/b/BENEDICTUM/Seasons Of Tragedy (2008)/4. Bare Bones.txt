Beset me not with you attitudes
Placating me with your platitudes
The time is short the time is now
Struggling just to live every day
Lethargic leaches just stay away
Suffer me not this trial by fire

Break it down till it's minimal
Bare Bones
Take it down Cause I'm cynical
Bare Bones
This deception is criminal
Bare Bones

I can see the truth from here
Falling on a deafened ear
Tell me what it's all about
Cause I've got to find a way,
find a way, find a way,
to get down to bare bones

Staring at me with your bovine eyes
Spare me your penchant to criticize
Action deployed energy now!
Beset me not with you attitudes
Placating me with your platitudes
Suffer me not this trial by fire

Break it down till it's minimal
Bare Bones
Take it down Cause I'm cynical
Bare Bones
This condition is critical
Bare Bones

I can see the truth from here
Falling on a deafened ear
Tell me what it's all about
Cause I've got to find a way,
find a way, find a way,
to get down to bare bones

Take it down till it's minimal
Bare Bones
Break it down cause I'm cynical
Bare Bones
This deception is criminal
Bare Bones

I can see the truth from here
Falling on a deafened ear
Tell me what it's all about
I've got to find a way,
find a way, find a way,
to get down to bare bones
