Let me tell you how it will go down
Let me tell you how it's gonna be
I am older than I was before
Far better than I used to be
Look over your shoulder now
And tell me what do you see
I'm getting much stronger
Not like I used to be

Ich bin kein
Kein Opfer

The lion springs from the lamb
Redefining just who I am
On a mission and it's crystal clear
Indecision must stop right here

I refuse to be your victim
I refuse to be
Nobodies' victim
Nobodies' victim

Let me tell you how it will go down
Let me tell you how it's gonna be
I am older than I was before
Far better than I used to be
Look over your shoulder now
And tell me what do you see
I'm getting much stronger
Not like I used to be

Ich bin kein
Kein Opfer

I refuse to be a victim
I refuse to be your victim
I refuse to be
Nobodies' victim
Nobodies' victim
