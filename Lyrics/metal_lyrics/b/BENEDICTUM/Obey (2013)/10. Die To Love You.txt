[Music: Goldy, lyrics: Goldy / Freeman]

On the road to nowhere
Now I've been here before
I am just so tired of crying
Please no teart no more

Then the thought of you returns
To my mind, my heart, my soul
And I would gladly leave,
To you I'd cleave
Just to be with you once more

Can't take the pain I can't remain

I would die
Die just to love you
I would die
Just to love you

Never has a heart been broken
So far beyond repair
And I reach out to you
What more can I do?
Please, wait, my love, I'll be there

Our hearts entwined we'll recombine
And we shall fly straight across time

I would die
Die just to love you
I would die
Just to love you
