[Music: Wells, lyrics: Freeman]

Loos of control
Is vexing my soul
I must adapt to survive
Deafening refrain,
I fall out of frame
Each breath takes me
Farther from life

Torn and tattered
Doesn't matter
Torrid rapture
Cry!

I'm fractured
Won't be captured

Far from the depth
My fortune inept
Panic and manic combined
Spinning my head
The quick and the dead
There's no alibi

Torn and tattered
Doesn't matter
Tears from laughter,
Why?

I'm fractured
Won't be captured
Fractured

Fractured
Won't be
Fractured
Won't be captured
Fractured!
Fractured!
