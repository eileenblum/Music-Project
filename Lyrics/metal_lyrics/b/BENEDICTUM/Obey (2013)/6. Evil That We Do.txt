[Music: Wells, lyrics: Freeman]

Satisfaction guaranteed
Cutting like a knife
Pierce the wound
You're gonna bleed
False self-sacrifice

Broken vows to do no harm
Retract the spell and break the charm
There's silence in the sound no deed
Undone when karma comes

Oh, the evil that we do
Oh, the evil that we do

What say you!

Dark intentions always see
The dawning of the light
Egos thrash like sharks
That feed confronted by their lies

This world still bares the scars
Of inhumanity at large
Tenderness it lies entombed
When we do nothing evil rules

Oh, the evil that we do
Oh, the evil that we do
Evil
Evil that we do
Evil
Evil

Oh, the evil that we do
Oh, the evil that we do

What say you!
