[Music: Wells, lyrics: Freeman]

Kneel down before me
For I can make it so
Prostrate before me
Before I let you go

Your imagination
For degradation has pushed you far
Beyond the pale
Struggle for your dignity,
This is what you asked of me
You don't breathe unless I say!

And as the light relents to day
It shall be me left standing
You will obey
You will obey
Every word
Obey!!!

You've changed the story
But think that I don't know
Unclaim your glory
As punishment unfolds

Ride upon my Berkley Horse
The governess that you endorse
You shall call me Domina!
'Twas your decision
For such derision
To the corner now, bad boy!

For as the light begins to wane,
Fantasy's flight becomes your bane

You will obey
You will obey
My spoken word
You will hear the words that I convey
You will obey
You will obey
Listen to my voice now and obey

Step into the after,
Your flesh released to me
This is nit a romance,
As you struggle to break free

You will obey
You will obey my spoken word
You will hear the words that I convey
You will obey
You will obey
Yes, you will obey
Hey, are you listening?
