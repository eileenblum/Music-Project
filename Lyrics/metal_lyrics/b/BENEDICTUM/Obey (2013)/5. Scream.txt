[Music &amp; lyrics: Jared Blackstone]

I like it better when we're all alone
No one around to tell you where to go
You like me better on your little pills
You said your life has left you empty thrills
Scream shout!
Break out!

You tell me what yo want I'll call the man
And I'll watch you bleeding as I hold your hand
But don't give up that's what they want to see
'Cause in the end it's only you and me

Scream shout!
Break out!

With all the pain that we've been through
And all the times we made it new
To watch it all go down like this
We're locked in one last fatal kiss

Do with me what you please
Cut out this disease
Bored and uninspired
Leaves me undesired

Scream shout break out!
Scream shout break out!

With all the pain that we've been through
And all the times we made it new
To watch it all go down like this
We're locked in one last fatal kiss
