[feat. Tony Martin][Music: Wells, lyrics: Voigt / Freeman / Wells]

What's become of all of us?
Feel the pain and deceit
Deep in the darkness we fall away
Take a look around you
Chaos rules the day
There is no justice for all

Cry for this land
Feel her pain as we fall from grace
All is lost broke apart
As we cry for the human race

What's become of both of us?
Feel the pain and deceit
Deep in the darkness we fell away
Take a look inside you
Chaos rules your mind
No chance at justice at all

Cry for this land
Feel her pain as we fall from grace
All is lost broke apart
Don't cry for the time we waste

Cry for this man 
Feel the pain as we fall from grace
All is lost broke apart
As we cry for the love we waste

Is there no one that hears us?
No one to wipe the tears that fall
Too late to try and change us
There's no one else to blame shame

Cry for this man
Feel the pain as we fall from grace
All is lost broke apart
Don't cry for the time we waste

Cry for this land
Feel her pain as we fall from grace
All is lost
Is it lost?
