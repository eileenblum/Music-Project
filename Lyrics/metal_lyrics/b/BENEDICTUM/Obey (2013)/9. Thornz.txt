[Music: Wells, lyrics: Freeman]

Careful as you gaze upon me
I will turn you to stone
Glacier ice runs in my veins
I'm a roseless thorn

Heartless doesn't even cover
He was dark from the day he was born
You might say you're roseless thorn
But I'm standing here and I'm a woman scorned

Like a slithering snake hidden deep in the weeds
He tore out my heart and he left me there to bleed

Like nails on a chalkboard
His words became to me
I was so turned around
Didn't know my own name
And I could barely breathe

Like oil and water we've become
The hurt has turned to hate and the damage done
For you have taken the better part of me
Now a roseless thorn and a woman scorned!

We will turn you to stone

Now I know we have reached this point of no return
Can't you see in my eyes all the hate and how it burns

Now if I were you I would sleep with one eye open
For not only my heart but my trust has now been broken

Like oil and water we've become
And now the damage has been done
For you have taken the better part of me
Now a roseless thorn and a woman scorned!

Like oil and water we've become
The hurt has turned to hate, the damage done
For you have taken the better part of me
Now a roseless thorn and a woman scorned!

We will turn you to stone
