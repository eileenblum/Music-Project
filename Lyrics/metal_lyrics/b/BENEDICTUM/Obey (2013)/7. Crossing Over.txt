[Music: Wells, lyrics: Freeman]

Stay with me!
Will you not pray with me?

Skies fallen, what fate for me waits for me?
Long shadows, whispers and words
Revealing a spektrum of haze
Did I pass with a whimper
A gasp or a blaze?

Dark hollows a trip from the gallows
Deep seated bereft and depleted
Bored holes in the depth of my soul
As I cry out to be heard no more!

Crossing over for the river is wide
Cerberus in my sites
I am crossing over to the greater unknown
For my life now has flown far from me

Cold comfort I grasp
For my senses
And not in the vastness I see
Concealing the terror within
Was my life full of light or a bastion of sin?
Can't follow pushed from the Bardo
Now knowing there is no tomorrow
Drawn breathe as I heave from the depth
Is there no more of life for me left?

Crossing over for the river is wide
Cerberus in my sites
I am crossing over
Will I cling to the sheets?
Phlegathon burning brightly for me

This is my own Gethsemane
This is my own mortality!

Die sweetly release
Now completely
Don't know what's beyond or beneath me
Life checked as if incomplete
And I know not what fate lies for me

Crossing over for the river is wide
Cerberus in my sites
I am crossing over
For the chasm is deep
As my life slips away from me
Crossing over to the greater unknown
Where the truth shall be shown
I am crossing over,
For the river is wide
Cerberus by my side
