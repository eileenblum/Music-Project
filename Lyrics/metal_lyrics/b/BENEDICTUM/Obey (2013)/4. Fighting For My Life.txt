[Music: Wells, lyrics: Freeman]

I've been told there's and ebb and a flow to life
Even so I just can't seem to get it right
Just the facts though, ipso facto
But I just let it roll right off my back

I try to put it all behind me now
But still somehow
I'm fighting for my life
Fighting for my life
We are here, here to fight
We are here, here to fight

Been kicked out more than once
From the school of life
Learned a lesson or two on how to survive
I'm a creature of human nature
And I just stand my ground until the last

They say the future is a spotless place
But I have to say I'm fighting for my life
We are here, here to fight
Fighting for my life
In the light

You want me? A piece of me?
You want me? That will never be!
Confront me? A piece of me?
You want me?

Free your mind so I can climb
Free your soul so there's a place to go

Fighting for my life
We are here, here to fight
Fighting for my life
Fighting for my life
Fighting for my life
We are here to fight
