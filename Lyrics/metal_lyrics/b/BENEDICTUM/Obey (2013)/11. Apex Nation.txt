[Music: Wells, lyrics: Freeman]

Drive it harder, push it farther
Straight to the limits we will ride
Can you see the road that frees me?
A coalition by my side

We're the Apex Nation
Breaking the barriers down
Join the Apex Nation
As we try to drive the ideal line

Wheels and metal roll together
It's like a freeing of the soul
Floor the pedal, breaking through hell
And now we know we're not alone

We're the Apex Nation
Loving the feel of the wheel
Join the Apex Nation
As we try to drive the ideal drive ride, drive ride

Formula 1 the Grand Prix bring it on
On to the 24 hours of Le Mans
Nascar the fast cars become one with us
Stand on your feet 'cause we just can't get enough

We're the Apex Nation
Breaking the barriers down
Join the Apex Nation
As we try to drive the ideal line

Ideal line
A coalition by my side
Ideal line
