[Music: Morgan &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

Take me please
Make me see
Shake the foundation
Quake in consternation

Free my mind
Return in kind
Like a phoenix I shall raise the fallen
Valkyrie come bear me to the sun

And I shall shift the paradigm
Ensure that victory is mine
My paradise is not yet lost
I bear my soul, you bear the cost

Is free
I fight, I believe
In manifestation
Of my spirit's incarnation

And I shall shift the paradigm
Ensure that victory is mine
My paradise is not yet lost
I bear my soul, you pay the cost

Valkyrie bear me away

Valkyrie shall bear my pall
See the mystery in all
Feel the wisdom in my pain
Knowing I shall rise again
[Repeat]

Valkyrie bear me away
Valkyrie bear me away
Valkyrie bear me away

Ride! Valkyrie!
Ride! Valkyrie!
