[Music: Wells &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

In nomine!
In nomine!
In nomine!

Arre dime vithicum
Cunu roche vithicum
Carpe diem veritas

The fear in the night
The fear in the night

Oh, I cannot think I can't feel
Oh, don't you know
It's so unreal

In nomine
Benedictum
Disconnected

Cara arre vithicus
Spiritus contra spiritum
Cunu roche veritas

The fear in the night
The fear in the night

Oh, I cannot think I can't feel
And don't you know it's so unreal

In nomine
Benedictum
Disconnected

Benedictus voca me
Save me from the darkest night

[Pete Solo]

In nomine
In nomine
