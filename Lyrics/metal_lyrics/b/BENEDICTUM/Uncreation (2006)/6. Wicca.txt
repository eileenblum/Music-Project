[Music: Wells &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

Father, father
They've come to take you away
Accusations fly
And you're life it ends today

And they called it Wicca
From the ancient rites of old
Oh yeah, they call it Wicca
So I'm told

Wicca

Like a scourge upon us
Is the system of lies
Yay or nay either way
The innocent dies

It was only Wicca
From the ancient rites of old
Yeah, they call it Wicca
So I'm told

And they danced with the moon
Kiss the day
And they run with the wolf
Once again!

And they run with the wolf

[Pete Solo]

From the spoken word come the losses untold
Forced to confess lies to save your own soul

In a system driven by lusting and greed
None are safe among us from the terror they seed
Judgments cast upon you based upon lies
In the name of God - Too many have died!

But it was only Wicca
From the ancient rites of old
Yeah, they call it Wicca
So I'm told

Wicca
