[Music: Wells &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

I know who you are
The perfect stranger
With the face that blends in the crowd

And I know how you feel
Your hatred for me
Is dark and deep and real

I'm your backstreet filthy whore
I'm the bitch that you can't ignore
You wish that you could
Snuff me out
With your misogyny

No longer blind, my eyes they see
Beyond the parallel to me
But you won't take my dignity
With your misogyny

You want me on my knees
You think that women are only there to please you
So take me if you will
But my spirit is something you'll never kill

I'm you mother, sister, whore
I'm the bitch that you can't ignore
You wish that you could snuff me out
With your misogyny

[Chris Solo]
[Pete Solo]

No longer blind, my eyes they see
Beyond the parallel to me
But you won't take my dignity
With your misogyny

You will not take my life
You cannot make it right
