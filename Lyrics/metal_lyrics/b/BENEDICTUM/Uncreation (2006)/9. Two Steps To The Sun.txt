[Music: Wells &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

And so the light no longer shines on me shines on me
And darkness all around oppressing me pressing me
No longer can I stand it someone please rescue me
My soul is torn and tattered will you please set me free

Bleeding my heart to the ground
Crushing my soul to the bone
Living and loving and
Pushing and shoving and oh

Two steps to the sun

And so the curtain falls it's finished me finished me
And now the trumpet blares it's calling me calling me
No longer can I stand it someone please me rescue me!

Bleeding my heart to the ground
Crushing my soul to the bone
Living and loving and
Pushing and shoving and oh

Two steps to the sun

Soleil contre libre ame
Soleil contre libre ame
Soleil de midi
Two steps to the sun
Two steps to the sun
Burning burning me

Bleeding my heart to the ground
Crushing my soul to the bone
Living and loving and
Pushing and shoving and oh

Two steps to the sun

Two steps to the sun
