[Music: Wells &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

Pain is all around me
And there's a darkness within my soul

Bright skies are black again
Reaching back to the uncreation
The dogs of war unleashed again
Tearing at the flesh of a nation

Uncreate the sun
My eyes
Uncreate the sun
My eyes cannot see

Uncreation
Uncreation

Arrogant and eloquent
Hard to tell the heart's inclination
Self appointed hierophants
Making plans for the next generation

Uncreate the sun
My eyes
Uncreate the sun
My eyes cannot see

Uncreation

[Pete Solo]

Uncreate the sun
My eyes
Uncreate the sun
My eyes cannot see
Uncreate the sun
My eyes
Uncreate the sun
And recreate me

Recreate me
Recreate me

Recreation
Recreation
Recreation
