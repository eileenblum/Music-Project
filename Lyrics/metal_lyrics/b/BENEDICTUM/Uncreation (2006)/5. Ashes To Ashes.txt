[Music: Wells &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

Bow down at the feet of mercy
Crying your dreams in the dark
I know the truth, that's what hurts me
My very own life is tearing me apart

Now when you look at me
You won't like what you see
It's not reality
It's tragedy, tragedy, tragedy

And when you look inside
You won't like what you find
You'll see it's all a lie
It's tragedy, tragedy, tragedy

Ashes to ashes
Dreams are falling to the ground
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down

Kowtow to beast of conformity
Twisting your life in the wind
I know the deoth of depravity
I never win, I never win, I never win

Now when you look at me
You won't like what you see
It's not reality
It's tragedy, tragedy, tragedy

And when you look inside
And when you're coming nigh
You'll see it's all a lie
It's tragedy, tragedy, tragedy

Ashes to ashes
Dreams are falling to the ground
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down
