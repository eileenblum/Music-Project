[Music: Wells &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

They don't even know what time it is
Always trying to get in my business
Who are they what are they anyway
Always twisting 'round the words I say

They were born to follow
We were to lead
They will try to tear me down
But they shall not succeed

All the time they sit just telling lies
Spend their idle time to criticize

So tell them don't want to talk about it
Tell them I'm gonna shout about it
Tell them there's no doubt about it
Tell them
Tell them to bite me!

They don't even know what I'm about
They will never ever figure out
They tell me I can't cuz I'm a chick
I tell them kneel down and suck my dick

They were born to follow
We were to lead
They will try to tear me down
But they shall not succeed

So tell them don't want to talk about it
Tell them I'm gonna shout about it
Tell them there's no doubt about it
Tell them
Tell them to bite me!

[Pete Solo]

[Repeat chorus]
