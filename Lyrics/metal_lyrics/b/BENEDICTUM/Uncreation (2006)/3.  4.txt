[Music: Wells &amp; Benedictum / Lyrics: Freeman]

The winter of my discontent just gave way to the sun
Now it is time to assess all the damage I've done
The enemy mine is the self that I've followed too long
Facing the ghosts of the past I see where I was wrong

Fate is knocking at my door
Time to step through number four
Keep searching - What do I see - Seek freedom!
Number 4!

Blinded was I by my ego and pride I resist
But something inside tells me I must go on I persist
Many a battle is fought but the war isn't won
I must keep fighting until all my demons are gone

Fate is knocking at my door
Time to step through number four
Keep searching - What do I see - Seek freedom!
Number 4!

[Pete Solo]

Fate is knocking at my door
Time to step through number four
Keep searching - What do I see - Seek freedom!
Number 4!
