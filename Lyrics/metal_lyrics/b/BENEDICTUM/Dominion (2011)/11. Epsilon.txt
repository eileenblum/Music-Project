[Music: Shrum/Wells/Pannone/Diaz, Lyrics: Freeman]

Iâm starved from the light I stumble in the dark
Tormented by the things that I am not
Reaching for some meaning to it all
Storming the citadel I try to breach the walls of Epsilon

Eyes that cannot see
We are to believe

Breaking my will I forge the bond
It brings us back to Epsilon
The moon and sun and I are one
I long to touch the face of God
Raging within me like a tide, a sacred place within my mind
Please take me back unto the time when we were so much closer to divine

Meeting resistance close the window to the self
Closing the vision that youâre really someone else
Blowing like the wind as it passes through my hands
Longing for the breath of life as it slips away like sand

Try to harness the will and then
False reality rears again
Metaphysical contraband
There are things I canât understand

Breaking my will I forge the bond
It brings it back to Epsilon
The moon and sun and I are one
I long to touch the face of God
Raging within me like a tide, a sacred place within my mind
Please take me back unto the time when we were so much closer to divine

Epsilon
Riding on the waves quantum time
Epsilon
There is no tranquility to find
Epsilon
Reaching for the far beyond
Epsilon
Where we touch the very face of God

Breaking my will I forge the bond
It brings us back to Epsilon
The moon and sun and I are one
I long to touch the face of God
Raging like the ocean tide, the safest place within  my mind
Please take me back unto the time  when we were so much closer to divine
