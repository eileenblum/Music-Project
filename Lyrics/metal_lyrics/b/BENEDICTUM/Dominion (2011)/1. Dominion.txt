[Music: Shrum/Wells/Pannone, Lyrics: Freeman]

I feel your indignation
Fueled with the combination
The darkest fascination
Staring down in consternation

Breaking down these chains of steel
No I will not come to heel
I see the implication
You can draw the correlation

I challenge your dominion
Over what I think and feel
I will not be broken on your WHEEL

Weâve come to the conclusion
You suffer from delusions
Scale the walls of your deceit
No I wonât concede defeat

I challenge your dominion
Over what I think and feel
I will not be broken on your WHEEL
Not willing to crawl on the ground
I will rise not be cast down
I will not be broken on your wheel

As long as I am breathing in
I vow to rise up again
Can you feel my frustration?
From this violation!

The Wheel
Why do they have to try and tear me down?
I will not be broken on your wheel

Weâve shattered your delusions
Now the circle is complete
I will not be broken on your wheel
I challenge your dominion over what I think and feel
I will not be broken on your wheel!
