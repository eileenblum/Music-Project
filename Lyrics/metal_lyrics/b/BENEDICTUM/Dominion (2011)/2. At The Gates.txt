[Music: Wells/Shrum, Lyrics: Freeman]

When I did what I was told I thought Iâd be
A better person than what I turned out to be
Sacrosanct in the sacred society
Whatâs working for you
Wasnât working for me
Now I live each day as if it were my last
Learning lessons from the sins of futures past
Death rattle shaking thereâs a knock at the door
Laid out on the floor

Now I wait, at the gate
Now I wait at the final gate

Tell me what my fate is as I stand at the gate?

Youâre the rebel when you stood on mountains high
Sentimental now that itâs your time to die
In the middle of your precious plans and schemes
Itâs looking to me
Like they donât mean a thing
Never gave a thought of what you put them through
Never stopped to think the problem came from you
Grim reaper calling I think you know what heâs after
Hanging from the rafters

Now you wait
Moon is full, stars are bright, seems like the fates have aligned
Now you wait  At the final gate
Sun is high, cloudless sky, looks like a good day to die

The walls are closing in donât know where to begin
As I wait at the gate
The bell it tolls for me, tell me how this can be, as I wait, as I wait at the gate.

Now I wait at the gate
Now I wait at the final gate
Moon is full, stars are bright
Seems like the fates are aligned
Sun is high, cloudless sky
Looks like a good day to die
Hello your life is calling and now your skies are falling.
