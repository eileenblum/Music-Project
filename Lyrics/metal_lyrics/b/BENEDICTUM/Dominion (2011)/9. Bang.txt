[Music: Freeman/Wells/Shrum, Lyrics: Freeman]

They cut us down and they showed us no mercy
We made it out on a wing and a prayer
Sometimes I think that this world wants to hurt me
But if Iâm going down itâs with my fist in the air

Millions of people are feeling unworthy, shuffling round feeling empty in side
Itâs time to rise we wonât let them define us
Just give em one finger way up high

They tore us down for no reason but like the phoenix we rise
This is out time itâs our season our anger is on the rise I said
Bang
Release that primal rage like animals in a cage
And free yourself
Bang your head with me!
With fists up in the air, the horns now if you dare
Our time has come
Let me feel your rage!

They shut us out for no reason
But with our fists in the air
Weâre not just one weâre a legion
One mission is crystal clear

Bang!
Release that primal rage like animals in a cage
And free yourself,  let them feel your pain
With fists up in the air the horns now if you dare
Our time has come
Let me feel your rage!

Bang your head with me!
Kicked down for no Godly reason
They treated us with disdain
We are not silent weâre screaming
We shall not be contained!

Bang
Release that primal rage
Like animals in a cage
And free yourself
Bang your head with me!
With fists up in the air
The horns now if you dare
Our time has come
Let me feel your rage!
You were meant to be free
So shout it out with me
Our time has come
Show them we remain with fists up in the air the horns now if you dare
Our time has come let me feel your rage!
