[Music; Wells, Lyrics: Freeman/De La Cruz]

Caught up in the violence
Cloaked in silent secrecy
You are a taker, but life is not your own you see
In anger youâve blundered, torn your soul asunder
Burning the bridge as you run youâre the prodigal son

You are a cyclone blowing but itâs you that youâre destroying
Dreams and wishes fade away youâve sold your soul for one more day.
Acting without reason but all things have their season
You are headed for disaster now decide whoâll be your master

Tumbling down blind is your fight
Your mind like your heart and your fists are clenched tight
Weaving a web of such extremes
As you shout in the dark thereâs no one to hear as you scream

Prodigal son
What have you done?
Prodigal Son
Prodigal run!

Acting without conscience this could be your last chance
Break the shackles turn it over, soon your life is over
Itâs over, itâs over, over!

Tumbling down blind is your flight
Your mind like your heart and your fists are clenched tight
Weaving a web of such extremes
As you shout in the dark thereâs no one to hear as you scream

Prodigal son
What have you done?
Prodigal Son
Prodigal run
Your time is running out!

You cannot deny, your truth is a lie
But remember this, descend the abyss

Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me my son, from yourself you canât run
You cry in the dark and I hear you scream.

Prodigal son
What have you done? Come back to me!
Prodigal son what have you done?
Canât hide from destiny
Prodigal son
Your time is running out!
Prodigal son what have you done?
