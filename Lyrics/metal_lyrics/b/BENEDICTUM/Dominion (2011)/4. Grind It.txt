[Music: Wells, Lyrics: Freeman]

Black is the night long is the day
Feelings inside slipping away
Raise my threshold for the pain
Object of my dark disdain

Grind it
Grind it

Kicked in the teeth by what lies beneath
I thought I was blind but now I see
You were leading me down such a primrose path
Donât look back for the die is cast

Grind it
Grind it

Stabbed in the back by the knife you wield
You will never know just how it feels
Remember dark pretender
These are the terms of your surrender!

Grind it
Iâve got to grind it out
Grind it
Iâve got to grind it out
