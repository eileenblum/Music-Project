[Music: Wells, Lyrics: Freeman]

Darkest horizon, suffer in silence, trapped and ashamed and contained by my beautiful pain
Barbed just like wire, thwarted desire, surging within me until I shall loose all control
From the depth of my soul

And it shall come to pass,
Cloaked in the veil that remains
As tattered as my past
The tapestry of life is stained
By my beautiful pain

I remain in my darkness in chains

Alabaster cold and lifeless inside I remain
Courting disaster servant and master, hunter and hunted consumed I devour my prey
The thrill of the chase

Dark Heart
And it shall come to pass
Cloaked in the veil that remains
As shattered as my past
The tapestry of life is stained
I remain in my darkness in chains

Round and around circulating my woe
When will it end nobody knows

Dark heart
Dark heart
Set me free
Dark heart
I remain
A prisoner in chains
