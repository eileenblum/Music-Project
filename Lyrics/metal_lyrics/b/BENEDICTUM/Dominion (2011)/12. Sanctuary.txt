[Bonus Track][Music: Wells/Pilson, Lyrics: Freeman]

So blind my eyes,
I cannot see
My mind aflame
Insanity

I used to stand out in the rain just to hide my tears
Condition hopeless driven by one hundred fears

Can you feel it, feel it touching you?
Can you hear it, what must I do?

Sanctuary can be found
There is silence from the sound
Of all the voices in your head
That lead you straight to the path of death

So sick at heart
My broken mind
Grateful am I to find a path my soul can climb
They told me that I could be free, free to believe
In a power much greater than I could ever be

Sanctuary can be found
There is silence from the sound
Of all the voices in your head
That led you to the path of death
Sanctuary can be found
There is silence from the sound
Just lift your eyes to the stars above and keep me safe in your arms of love

Now the scales fall from my eyes
As I finally realize
Now my mind is open wide
From yourself you cannot hide

Sanctuary can be found
There is silence from the sound
Of all the voices in your head
That lead you straight to the path of death
Sanctuary can be found
There is silence from the sound
Just lift your eyes to the stars above and keep me safe in your arms of love
