[Music: Wells, Lyrics: Freeman]

Seek find enter my tortured mind
Investigate all out war awaits
Roaring seething tearing down heavens above
Writhing heeding the call to horse!

Waging war in the Shadowlands
As I cry out I bring down the rain
Acts of war in the Shadowlands
Harbinger of destruction and pain

Love hate
They often compensate for me
Fear blinds it is the enemy mine
Piercing screams they echo inside my head
Penetrate that dark faÃ§ade
Straight through you

Waging war in the Shadowlands
As I cry out I bring down the rain
Acts of war in the Shadowlands
Harbinger of destruction and pain
We atone in the Shadowlands
Wielding weapons of conscious control
Art of war in the Shadowlands
As we march through the bone yard of souls

No light at the window
As we fall from a false state of grace
Tread lightly as I go
And now escape

No light from the window
No warmth from the heat of the day
Tread lightly as I go
Beyond the lines I break

Depression came
But hope remained
Forge the path that brings peace at last

Waging war in the Shadowlands
As I cry out I bring down the rain
Acts of war in the Shadowlands
Harbinger of destruction and pain

My sword unsheathed as I face a known enemy
No fear as I see unleashed the madness in me
