[Music:Morgan/Wells, Lyrics: Freeman]

Here I go again
Let the games begin
I canât seem to see the forest for the trees
As it slips away no more words to say
The illusion of we
Can no longer be

One life given selflessly
One breath drawn in ecstasy

Loud silence
Victim of no words, love lies on the floor
Loud silence
Speaks to me, every word you didnât say is
Screaming unspoken

In a gilded cage
While my youth it fades
As a captive I breathe
Will I ever be free?

And these wounds I feel
Will they ever heal?
What have I sacrificed
For an easier life?

One tear in an endless sea
Cold fear of whatâs unknown to me
One life given selflessly
One breath drawn in ecstasy

Loud silence
Victim of no words, love lies on the floor
Loud silence
Speaks to me, every word you didnât say is
Screaming unspoken

One tear in an endless sea
Cold fear of whatâs unknown to me
One life given selflessly
One breath drawn in ecstasy

Loud silence
Victim of no words, love lies on the floor
Loud silence
Speaks to me every word you didnât say is
Screaming unspoken
Loud, no, give me strength just to walk out the door
Every single word
