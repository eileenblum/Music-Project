I drown in pain, writhing, contorting
My face deformed, my life becomes a hollow shell
Meaning is lost, all hope is gone
Crawling through glass on bleeding knees, I beg for death
My tears burning a trail of wounds across my flesh
The crown of nails tormenting my sick mind
The scars I bear remind me of my ruin
Walls I built fall down to dust
Core exposed, fears become alive
They take form, monstrous beings, twisted
Surround me, tear the skin to shreds
Bludgeoning emotions numb
Suicide only way out
And I have no choice but to leave my hope shattered
Forever tore mind in the grace of depression
As I force the blade deep into my ice cold veins
Watching my blood flow deep into lakes of death
And my immortal soul is looking back at my life sand...
What is this life but perpetual torment
I see nothing, I hear nothing
I feel nothing, my life was nothing
And the void is in me
Placid life less free from the chains that bind me to the Earth
Into the black hole my grave
Away, away from the noise
Away, away from the light
