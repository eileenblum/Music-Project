You can't run
The sickness of all the enemies
that feel begin less that you
a bunch of lies
across your life
do not ever judge me
I'm your poison
don't be afraid
because I will not reject your sins
this law must be applied to make you bleed
the mercy is no here
right now your better choice is cry for me
Cry for me
'cause your dead is awake
Run through this edge
This is the fear of the hidden ones
You
Slut
