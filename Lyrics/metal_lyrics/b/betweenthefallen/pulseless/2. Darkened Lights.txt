You can't take me down because there's no one behind you.
You know
this is all
this is the end.
I know you are afraid
and I know you are a little bit scared
but the pressure is the pain,
do you think you can fix it?
get down,
don't run.
Take the step right now,
you are already dead...
why don't you try?
I am waiting for you.
All the people I left behind
I work so hard,
can you give me something back?
Now
fuck you
you don't know
what I made
what I give for you
can you only give me a choice?
Return.
With their hope
I will become
the worst thing
in your world.
Darkened lights
save your breath
darkened lights.
