...and when you look around
You will hear an inner silence

You will see the roads you always looked for
In the shade of your fading soul

And when wanting to reach them
You will find the cold weight of the memories
Preventing your steps

The supreme light will come,
When you look around

Burning and tearing your skin...
In an inner silence
