Ooh great power!
Consume the illusions
Which invenom
My MEMORY!

Take away their remains
Which excarnate my soul.

Take away their spoliations
Consume these illusions

Which invenom my memory
Which excarnate yeah!

I disinter the dark image
Of a warrior body
And behind his quiet glance
The purity of an errant aura

Which dimensions run through
Carrying light
From the flame, that only your heart
Can see

And with the final chorus
He rises
And with the endless sunset light
He rides and fights
For the blood that increases
HIS FLAME!
