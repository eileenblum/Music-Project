And I stay emotionless
At the wave's crash,
Dumb, at the thunder's voice
I know I die

I know it burns
That there is no rain
That put out this flame
And I know this is your mark

IN THE EVERLASTING FIRE
We'll burn together

And at my bell's toll
You'll know I've gone
You'll know that is burns you
I don't carry already

And I stay motionless
I know I die
I know it burns
We'll burn together forever, yeah!
And I'll know
That your name the fire will burn out
THE FIRE
