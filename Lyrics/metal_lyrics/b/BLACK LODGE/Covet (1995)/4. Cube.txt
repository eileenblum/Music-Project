...gone,
All life,
Has gone,
All life,
Has gone,
All life,
Has gone,
All life,
Has gone.

These four walls is home. And all to reflect upon. Living through others lives.
Only blackness here in this monotone-life.
Cannot differ his days, cannot control his fate.

"Never" live his lust
"Never" touching the rose
By beauty in safety, his life is set by others, your exile euphony
No need to dream, your world already pictured
No need to reach, your world already given
"Never" life is lust
"Never" touching the rose
Touching the screen makes it so real, it seems so real.
By beauty in safety, his life is set by others, cannot differ his days.
No need to doubts, your truth is always pictured
No need to think, your truth is already given
By beauty in safety, his life is set by others, your exile euphony
No need to doubt, your truth already pictured
No need to think, your truth already given
Never
Never.
