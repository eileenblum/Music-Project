Urge
Imaging hard
Cold side darkside
A visage outlined
Cold shards deviate
Flux liquefied
Beauty and strife
Amaze me cold force
Life strike me blind
Scorch
Lights lost
To me
Burn mine
Breed new
Life
Scorch eradicate
Pund nullify
To purge what comes to mind
Sensory output
Mind overload
Word will feed me anything but
World doesn't seem
To care about anything
Any thing anymore mother
Wake me mother wake me
Pray life forgive me
For I falter
Time is running white
Uniron the other
Once of sangueness
I am altered
In passion chaste as ice
Integrity water
Burn mine breed new life
Wake me,
Wake me
