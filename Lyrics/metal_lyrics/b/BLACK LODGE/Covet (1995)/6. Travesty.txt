Your conscious mind betrayed
In an ill confounding kiss
Roaming troubled skies
Never meant to be like this
A crucified effigy
Heretic jester expires
Strikes from blackened clouds
Primeval thoughts of lovehate

"That unmatched form and feature of blown youth,
Blasted with ecstasy"

What meant to burn out
Slowly fades away
Slooded hands cannot deprive of
Beautified annages
Carved in flesh
Exhume the unwanted
Assume the grim truth
In bitter transcendence
I'll have my way with you
Embracing air wasting life
Wanting you
Self pity sanctified wanting you
Losing me
Drifting out in winter twilight
Entombed in arctic void
Consume my anguished mind my
Tainted recollection my withering
Soul

"O, woe is me:
I have seen what I have seen, see what I see"

Approach assignment
Exit you
Left to perish enslaved by
She never would

"Like sweet bells jangles, out of tune and harsh."
