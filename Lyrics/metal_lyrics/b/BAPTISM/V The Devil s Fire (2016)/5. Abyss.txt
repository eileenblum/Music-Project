Flesh and bones together become a person
Stars above they fullfill
The (martyrs) scars and blood
As a new dawn for many, let this be the day
Of the stopped world, when heart opened

Hear the call of that pulse, descending to live
Six prayers from the gates of worlds ending
Be blessed unto life eternal
I can feel in my arms
Follow me, again and again

Into the abyss of my heart

Flashes from beyond the curtain
Call from the depths
Through the dead bodies
The graves are opened

Worship our master
Whos lurking in the shadows
Sharing thy beauty
Studying thy magic ablaze

Lights that illuminate my soul
Call from the depths
Between the two worlds
The graves are opened

Worship our master
Whos lurking in the shadows
Sharing thy beauty
Studying thy magic ablaze
