At the dawn he said
Let them burn, from the ash
We will build the new age
We came from the Azazel's star,
The others from the earth beheld by angels

We see the idol which the masses adore, we look beyond
I know that you look me from the other side, where the all ends
(Where the esoteric dimensions binds evolution)

Once I ignited the inner torch
I will never put it down
Reawakening is at hand
Warmth and love, o the great splendour
Devil's fire

We can travel to the world's end
Only to see the light
Nothing is different there
Nothing is different here
In his endless field of fog
There is only here and now, the blinding glow
The presence of our mercurial master
But still like the beginning,
There is just the illumination
