To the teeth of the silver lion
The lamb has willingly bared its throat
A husk of mud shall turn into dust
cast off shall be the profane robe

In the fiery belly of the iron lion
The corpse of the lamb will burn
Until the remains of this offering
Float out from the bellowing urn

A pool of blood
Becomes a crimson sea
And thus a smouldering seed
Grows into a flaming tree

The age-old lie of shielding feather wings
Overthrown by the
reality of forked tongues
And a torch lit between the horns

The image in the obsidian mirror
Shows a newly-risen luminous man
Standing within a circle of warm ash
With his foot upon the skull of the lamb

Like a depthless ocean is the awakened soul
Yet not an infinite abyss of darkness
But one embracing a single sun

A pool of blood
Becomes a crimson sea
And thus a smouldering seed
Grows into a flaming tree
