Altar of the serpent
Nine candles are burning, between every other
Glimmer of incense
And morbid odor of human skull
True darkness surrounding us

Only love is sacred
Let hate be eternal
The pure odor of fornication and flesh
Loneliness, temple inside my head
Human soul, knowledge and the ruler
Hell is present, past and that which is yet to come
Future, despair and waiting, with me

There are no others in this room
And footprints already lost in dust
Perfect peace and nostalgy ruling
Tired of life and unclean
(I pacify my mind and close my eyes)

And we will see his glory again
O' Satan, the source of my power
Thy oneness is a flame unyielding
Immortal prince of the depths
Praised be thy name
And that, my power
