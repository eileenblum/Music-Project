"Offerimus calicem salutaris
In nomine Lucifer, Astaroth, Beliar
The old, the great, the cursed ones
With rituals and black prayers
The majestic crimson dawn of glory
Everlasting damnation and Luciferian light"

Deep green sea opens, raging to the horizon
Ground breaths forth desperate air
And from amidst the fire not seen by all
Beasts out the voice
From the darkness I cry for you (Satan)

I see a fragile constellation
From beyond this universe
A breath of death to my inner hell
My light as by the will of it's creator (Lucifer)
A spark from the forge within earth's core

If that breath could set free
If I could leave everything
And travel beyond realities
I would rise to my lips the chalice of death
And drink without the smallest besitation
Clear pleasure, lascivious strength
Fervent, mavelike power

SinÃ¤ kuoleman malja ja sisÃ¤inen tuli
SinÃ¤ vapahdus, kadotus, kaikessa lÃ¤snÃ¤
Sinusta olemme tehdyt ja sinuun hajoamme
SinÃ¤ iÃ¤nkaikkinen ja ikuinen
