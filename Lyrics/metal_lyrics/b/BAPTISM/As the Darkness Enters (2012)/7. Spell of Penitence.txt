Silent night, black as the abyss
Stars have fled this evening of northland
Human blood spilled in rivers
From hearts rejoicing their destiny
Behind is the baptism of black fire
Before is life and death, joined in eternity

Silent night, patterned by cold lights from above
As bowels of clouds are torn open
Revealed the shining treasures of space
Distant gemstones and the moonlike blazing moon
Under these our hearts weep again, again
To open to the sacred mysteries of Satan

Fratres, agnoscamus peccata nostra
Ut apti simus ad sacra mysteria celebranda

I have let the light tempt me
I have sought happiness before reality
I have thought there's something else but me
I forgot thy grace is in everything

"Now, the heart of night is cut open, from darkness the visions of madness are spilled, filled with beauty, full of life"

Knowledge older than man is revealed
By dedication, by the spells, and by the grace of Satan
Black embrace of night is opening all around me
