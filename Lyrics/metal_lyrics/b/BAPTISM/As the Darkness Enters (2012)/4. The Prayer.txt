All is made with human hands
Yet no laughter heard
But cracks on broken idols are smiling
When fire outpowered darkness became light
When you can't see Samael you're him

These words are silece, like all else
My master, why hast thou remembered me
Kneeling at my altar of everything
Three gates below grant paradise by breaking it
Behold through me, for you are the eye

Serpents crawl from older dusks
Soon hunting on altars of flesh
Knowing you I will become that prey
Which grows only stronger by it's perpetual death
And when I will stand on the ashes

I will see, I will see the face of God
The edge of horizon who split's the night
Hearing the blessing of discordant choir

From the depths I call for you O' Lord
From the forms and names I reach for you
You are the blood and you are the nerves
You are the hands that unite in prayer

"All of it consumed, fools gold turned to blessing
The wounds upon my palms, pierced by no shawllow words
Still time to wake up, no time to look back, though"

No more waiting
Indulge on blood-baked bread
It's everything from fertile ashes
Behind the stars, of darkness, of master
For my time, I have taken
