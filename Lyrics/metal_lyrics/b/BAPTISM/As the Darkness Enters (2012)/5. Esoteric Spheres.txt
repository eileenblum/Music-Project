No path, no one to witness my return
Through the darkness I flew
Questions turned to answers
Answers turned to awe
Despair, thou made me strong

Horrible yet beautiful, this unearthly domain
Made by no human hand
Seen by none but the chosen
For only few can understand this form of holiness
The lonely, the burning ones

When walls crumble - when floor gives away
Outside the cosmos - is still breathing
Beyond flesh and blood - more profane than those
Mysteries of Satan - unfolding in tranquil vision
Which I never left

Utter loneliness breeds lucid insanity
Fragments of man at your feet
The trail is took within, there is no other way
You must reach beyond dreams
Find something other to arrive
