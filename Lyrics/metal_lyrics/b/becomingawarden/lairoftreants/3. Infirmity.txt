You're all so meaningless
that you're on the floor
prowling between sand grains

You're searching for a crack in the floor
because are cringing before my voice.
You always will be covered by my shadow
unless you decide to arise from your grave
You are the only one who you must deal with
And I cannot wait until you try
Inside your heart sits someone valuable
and strong enough to tear me apart

Now come on gather your strength
I have enough beating you down
Become a man stand up and fight
with your inner weaknesses

You're searching for a hole in the wall
because you cant stand my killing look
You always will be taken on my sights
unless you unleash the person who you are
You need to kill all of your your inner struggles
And I cannot wait until you try
Inside your heart sits someone valuable
and strong enough to tear me apart

Now come on gather your strength
I have enough beating you down
Become a man stand up and fight
with all these glass pieces in your heart
Now come on gather your strength
I have enough beating you down
Become a man stand up and fight

[break:]
You cannot let yourself to be humiliated
You need to gather your strength
and unleash yourself

Now, wipe off your tears
get up from your knees
and do step forward
leave behind your back
all you've done in your past
and just keep moving

You were searching for a hole in the wall
'cos you couldn't stand the way how i looked
You always stood in the shadow of others
now you've decided to arise from your grave
You need to kill all of your your inner struggles
And I cannot wait until you try
You need to kill all of your your inner struggles
And I cannot wait until you do

Now come on... Gather your strength and fight me back
Become a man, unleash yourself, unleash yourself
