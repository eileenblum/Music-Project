Open your eyes
Don't wait for your demise
Deeply hide your pride
Run for your precious life

When you're going somewhere always be prepared well
Be prepared for every case you don't even expect
Because walking through the forest you don't know
who will stand on your way hungry for your breath

Open your eyes
Don't wait for your demise
Deep hide your pride
Run for your precious life

Can you feel their gaze
It leaks down through your neck

Try to keep calm and don't loose your mind
Your fear is nourishment for their blighted lives
Try to keep calm and don't loose your mind
Your fear is nourishment for their blighted lives

All they want is to rip your flesh
And feed their roots with your mindless brain
Try to keep calm and don't loose your mind
Your fear is nourishment for their blighted lives

Run for your life!

Keep your head high, and be focused on walking your path [2x]
Don't look behind, they're crawling after your fear [2x]

What the hell have you done
curiosity just have won
What the hell have you done
It's gonna be your last run

Don't look behind, and keep running for your precious life [3x]
There is no chance. There is no chance to stay alive

Circle will do a full turn
Soon your body will burn

All they want is to rip your flesh
And feed their roots with your mindless brain
Our imagination needs to be under control
Remember that, because you will be always on your own
