I'll try to open your eyes
your heart your mind and your soul
I'll try to bring you up,
until you go somewhere wrong

Don't let your eyes remain closed
everything's based on your sorrow
hence try to cooperate
Or we will die by your sword

'Cos you've got an evil potential
to enslave the whole humanity
so letâs try to keep you calm
to prevent you from dictatory

We are now insanely neglected
though still we are connected
you can be apodictic
and you can't be underestimated

You need to fight for your within

Everyone needs to be free
'cos we're not mindless bees
we will not fall on our knees
thus They will not control our will

Don't let yourself to get close
to the leaders intrusive nose
They are insanely interested
To treat us all with anesthetic

We are all we are together
And I hope we'll last forever
'cos we belong to the human race
no matter about the differences

Every one holds up a weapon
our words are it's ammo
so think before you speak
and you'll become unique

Just fight tough
Just fight tough for your within.

By being human, you will become unique
Fight for your within and plate it with pure gold
