You think, it's a bad luck
what a shame
You think, what have I done
to deserve it
If world is treating us like curse
We cannot blame it, It's our fault

Sense the breach in the wall
be aware of every single hole
Learn how to make a decision
quickly and accurately enough to
prevent destruction that causes malfunction
of organism which consists of your people
They don't deserve damnation
So keep paying your attention
to the ones you hide under your wings

'cos you are the only one
who deserves their allegiance x4

[Chorus 4x:]
If world is treating us like curse
We cannot blame it It's our fault

[Breakdown:]
If world is treating us like curse
We cannot blame it It's our fault
We are the curse and it's our fault
If world is treating us like curse
We cannot blame it It's our fault

If world is treating us like curse
We cannot blame it It's our fault
We are are the hunters and we are the prey
Don't let yourself to lose your way

[Chorus]
