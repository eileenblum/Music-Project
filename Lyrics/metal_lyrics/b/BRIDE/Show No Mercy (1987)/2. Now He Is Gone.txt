On a hill there is a spark 
Where the light would spread and strangle the dark 
A little girl stands at the door 
Looking at the blood stains on the floor 

Now he is gone, my little darling don't you cry 
For he will return, you must decide 

Through the city they carry a man 
Washing their hands in the brandy of the damned 
Torches burn oh so bright 
Burn out the day burn out the night 

A soul cleaves unto the dark 
It melts for heaviness in the musk 
The stranger wandered the face of the earth 
Coming with the answers or on a search
