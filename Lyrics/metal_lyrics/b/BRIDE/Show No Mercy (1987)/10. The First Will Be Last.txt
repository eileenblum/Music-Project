Where will you be when the moon turns to blood 
When the sun won't shine and the stars fall from above 
Has love taken you high or has pride taken you low 
The elements are coming apart the atoms letting go 

The first will be last
The last shall be first 
The hungry shall be fed 
While the filled will thirst 

You can take every breath with the devil's daughter 
The carnage of our passion 
Leads you to the slaughter 
Just a memory of her face mindless begs your sleep 
Break free of the bondage of disbelief 

The cities glow and the kings rise and fall 
Conviction of your sould leaves you walking on the walls 
The chandeliers glisten with their reflections of light 
Dancing in the shadow out the night
