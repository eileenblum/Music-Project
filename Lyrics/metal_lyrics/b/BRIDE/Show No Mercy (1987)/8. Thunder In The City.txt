I won't be a part of you 
I'm in a world of my own 
You know i'll see it through 
I can't be burnt and won't lie like you 

Destination overdrive 
Destination overdrive 
You can be just like me 
Just like me 

You can be 
Thunder, thunder in the city 

Up to ten then a little more 
Pushing highter we're going to soar 
Feel the force against your chest 
Riding on the wings of our jet
