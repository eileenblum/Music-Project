Take a little and leave a lot 
I'm in control calling the shots 
It's coming down from the sky 
Appointed unto man once to die 

I have no world but the one to come 
I am a loner what have i done 
I won't leave 'till i've shown you right 
Attack i may i love to fight 

I'm being caught away 
You rapture my soul 
I'm being caught away 
Life will take it's toll 

I'm only passing through what they call life 
I'll get it with or without pain and strife 
He suffered once, i will too 
I just hate to leave without you
