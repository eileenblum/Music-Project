In this space and time that we inhabit 
Sometimes don't we feel like an exhibit 
Growing up isn't something easy to do 
Feeling so free we can't lose 

Follow your heart not your head 
Follow the voice within 
Follow your heart not your head 
It's calling you again 

When wrong speaks to you in the night 
Right isn't far behind in the light 
Our little minds wander away sometimes 
As long as they return we live fine 

When your dreams fall beneath your feet 
Out souls reach up searching for peace 
Go ahead reach up a little higher 
Don't leave 'till you've felt the power
