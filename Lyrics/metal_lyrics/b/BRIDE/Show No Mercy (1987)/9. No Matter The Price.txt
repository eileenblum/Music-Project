Emerging form the mist of dawn 
A new day to live more life that goes on 
Deceiving are the song birds at play 
Masking all the works that time has swept away 

All that we have known is gone 
We face the emptiness of nowhere to run 
We are the children of the setting sun 

No matter the price it must be paid 
We stand our ground we are not afraid 
Entrenched in fire he takes, never to give 
He is the liar we must finght to live 
Dancing in the visions of a chemical escape 
A mind that's a waste land marcotic rape 

Planning derision's of evil thoughts within 
From inside a blackened soul 
You can see the dark ones grin
