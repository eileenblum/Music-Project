You will hear in the distance 
The children are whining 
Oh how i cherish the thoughts 
When the sun stops shining 
The streets will grow silent 
And they all go down 
The grave how she burns 
As i look into the ground 

Forever in darkness away from rain 
Forever in darkness to wear the chains 

Scarlet beast shall rise 
And takes a deep breath 
There is no heart 
Under her velvet chest 
Oh how sweet is death 
There's no more there's no less 
But for those who deny 
They run to the hills and hide
