There's an incredible humor to my treason 
I surrendered the dark side for a reason 
I will lift my sword and fight to the end 
I won't give up because i just began 

Show no mercy 

I won't lay my weapons down to rest 
I'll give it my all i'll give it my best 
I will fight to win this war 
Never settle for an even score 

I am strong and your are weak 

Jesus gives me power to defeat 
I can't be bought and won't sell out 
The battle cry is good and loud
