Fifty ways and maybe more,
to the tree of life to come up short [Proverbs 4:26 Isaiah 30:21]
The narrow road is the way go [Matthew 7:14 Jeremiah 6:16]
In a trumped up 70 Super Sport

Come home from the California sunshine Recycled Angel tears
Flat blues in the headlights back breakers don't come back here

Truth and lies has consequence
Depending upon ones competence [Luke 12:48]
The fearful losses confidence [Revelation 21:8]
The world sees no difference [2 Peter 3:6 1 John 2:15-17]

And it makes little sense
to suffer through the politics
No one drank the new wine [Acts 2:13 Ezekiel 36:26 Acts 13:52]
Flushed in their list of crimes

Time for me to elaborate
The good and bad will separate [Matthew 25:31-46]
You heard about the judgement day [Acts 17:31 Judges 3:9-11; 2:16-18]
I hope you don't miscalculate [1 John 3:8]
