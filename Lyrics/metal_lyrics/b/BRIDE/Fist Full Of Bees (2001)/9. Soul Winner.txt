Daddy lost the moon rock
Only thing that we owned [Matthew 19:21]
Only way to get out of poverty [Matthew 16:24]

Born in a small room
Then we lost everything
Swallowed up in apathy

I want to be a soul winner [John 12:32]
Who will save my soul? [Luke 19:10]
[John 4:35, Romans 10:1, Romans 1:14 1 Corinthians 9:22 Acts 20:31]

We got down on knees [Psalms 95:6]
Prayed for the love of the truth [James 5:20]
Never lost or misplaced our hope [Acts 15:3]

Say more than they say do more than they do [2 Peter 3:11]
Be more than they will ever become [1 Thessalonians 1:5]
[Psalms 51:13Luke15:7]
