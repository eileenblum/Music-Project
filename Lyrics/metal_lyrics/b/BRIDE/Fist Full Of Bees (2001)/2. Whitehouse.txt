He wore a 4-piece he's doin' all day [Proverbs 7:22 Genesis 6:11]
He had put on Front Street: plenty to say [Proverbs 18:6-7]

[Exodus 31]

Taking it to the Square: Bumpin his Gums:
The rev was called to clear the air up some
Don't mean nothin' don't mean a thing
CON SOFOS [Twice as bad back at you] L.W.O.P.
If you can't Make Paper: prepare for pay back

Started with the moan and grown, ended with the clicks
Phones off the hook lifers in the bricks
