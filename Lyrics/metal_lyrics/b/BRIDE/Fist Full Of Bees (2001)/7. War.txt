[Romans 5:12]

Incarcerated in mortality [2 Corinthians 5:4]
Until we give up the ghost [Isaiah 25:8]
Languishing over morality [1 Corinthians 15:53]
The flesh we love the most [2 Thessalonians 2:12] 

The soul incased in prison [Romans 8:7 Ephesians 4:8]
Encircled within our minds [Romans 1:28, Romans 12:2]
The conscience strains to listen [Romans 13:5 1 Timothy 1:19]
The ticking hands of time [Psalms 81:15 Psalms 89:47] 

Expression, confession I can't wait 
War "in the soul" [Psalms 86:14 Luke 22:31 Ephesians 6:12] 

Incriminated abandoned [Romans 2:9, Colossians 1:21]
Upon the blasted plains [Jude 1:19, 2 Corinthians 4:4]
Without hope in this life [2 Peter 2:14]
God in the flesh came [Romans 13:1] 

Justice and the law
Established to condemn [2 Corinthians 3:6, Romans 7:7]
Holy Spirit sent [1 John 2:27, Hebrews 6:1, John 14:26]
To convict the heart of sin [Hebrews 10:39] 

I swear you live your life 
Like your going to live forever [1 John 2:15]
Actions of a natural man [1 Corinthians 2:14]
We all meet there together [Proverbs 22:2]

[2 Corinthians 6:7]
I never put any faith in this life [Matthew 16:26]
And the countdown begins [1 Peter 4:7 James 5:8]
The Day turns to Night [Amos 5:18 2 Peter 3:10]

Voices from the earth
Say don't come to this place
