Everybody Knows My Name
Everybody Wants The Fame
Everybody Wants To See
Everybody Wants A Piece Of Me
Everybody Wants The Fun
Everybody Sees The Gun
Everybody Be So Kind
Still Got My Piece Of Mind
Everybody Knows My Name
Everybody Can You Feel My Pain

I Was Born A Poor Boy
Left Home When I Was Four
Momma Never Named Me So I Was Never For Sure
I Learned To Read Enough To Know Life Wasn't So Kind
All I Own Is My Guitar And My Piece Of mind

[chorus]
Everybody Knows My Name
Everybody Play The Game
Everybody Wants The Fame
Everybody Knows My Name

I Went Out Into The World To Find My Place In Life
I'm Learning More, Everyday Surving Really Bites
They Ask Me For A Line Of Coke, Needles, Knives And Guns
I Said To Myself I Think I Found A Home Cause This Place Sounds like Fun

I've Seen Holyrollers, Midnight Strollers, Cops Shake With Fear
I've Seen High Heels Clicking, Red Lipstick, Blood, Sweat And Tears
I've Read About A Man Who Died For Everybody's Sins
If You Want To Make A Change You Got To Put Your Faith In Him
I've Seen The Limelight In New York City
I've Seen The Rainbow In Hollywood
I've Walked The Streets Of London England
The Streets Of Gold Look So Good

I've Voted For Their Politions
I've Seen All The Dirty Religions
I Wore Their Three Piece Suits
But I Did Not Wear Their Army Boots
I Didn't Fire The Guns Of War
Never Knew What We Were Fighting For
Everybody Wants The Fame
Everybody Knows My Name
