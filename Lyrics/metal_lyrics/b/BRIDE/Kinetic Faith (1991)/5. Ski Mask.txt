Let's go out and have some fun
With our Ski Mask and hand guns
Driving Fast cars to the sun
We'll be blind but we'll die young
We were wild when we were young
With our Ski mask and hand guns
The law means nothing when your numb
I bet those handcuffs weighed a ton

[chorus]
Ski mask and hand guns
Lived on the edge lived on the run
With those ski mask and hand guns

I never knew love until I met you
Makes me do the things I do
Walking talking no use crying
Living Loving no use dying

There was a time I thought I knew it all
I could walk before I crawled
Jesus crushed my heart of stone
Gave me love I had never known
Don't need No Don't want no
