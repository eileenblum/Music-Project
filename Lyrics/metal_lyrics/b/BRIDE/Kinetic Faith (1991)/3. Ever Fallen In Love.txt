She drives me crazy makes me belong
I can't take it no more
She gives her best, she gives her all
She picks me up when I fall
She got a good thing
She's got a special way
She's there when I need her the most
She really doing fine, She's got a heart to give
She Put's Me Together Again

[chorus]
Ever Fallen In Love I Have
Ever Fallen in love I am

She tells me she's all mine
Knows how much I need her
I'm blessed to have these feeling again
She makes me the man I am
She's the one I believe In
She Holds A Key To my heart

Love Bears all things, believes all things
Hopes All things, endures all things
Love is patient love is kind
Love is forgiving Love is Blind
