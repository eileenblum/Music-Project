Roxanne Doesn't Think She's Pretty Enough
She Sits Staring Up At The Sky
Dream About A Life That Could Be
She Throws Her Diary Into The Sea

[pre-chorus]
It Becomes A Very Long Summer
The Careless Nights Of Fantasy Are Over
When You See Her She's White As A Ghost
She Misses The Sun On Her Face The Most

[chorus]
Young Love-Kiss Him Goodbye
Young Love-Don't You Cry
Young Love-It's No Lie
There Is Love Before The Day You Die

She Feels Her Life Has Fallen Apart
I Tried To Tell Her The World Has A Bulletproof Heart
Sometimes The Past Is Hard To Escape
When The Future Is Bent Out Of Shape

Roxanne Doesn't Think She Pretty Enough
She Sits Staring Up At The Sky
She Wears Across Around Her Neck
Got The Words At Her Finger Tip
At The Church She Knelt To Pray
Sweet Lord Jesus Give Me The Strength
She Cried His Name
She Cried His Name
