I see the scars from the madman's knife
Marks on your wrists wear he had you tied
You try and tell me it doesn't mean a thing
I Hear the sad songs your left to sing
You thought you could take it day after day
You're blessed to still be able to walk away
Your mother told you they were dirty old men
They say if you don't play you can't win

[chorus]
You want love You need love
Your Love on the Mountaintain

His hands were folded as if to pray
But he never had any words to say
He walked beside you then left you alone
To face the fear he places in your soul

Prodigal Girl, come in out of the cold
Rest your feet before you explode
Prodical girl I know you hurt
I know what they stole
