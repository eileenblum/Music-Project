You Always Told Me You Can't Be Beat
Thought you had me bound hand and feet
I can see your lies, pain, and ecstasy
It's time I take control love comes quickly
You lay your cards down you ain't so tough
Is that all you got I will call your bluff

[chorus]
Kiss the train-I won't do it
Kiss the train-I'd be a fool
Kiss the train-I won't do it
Kiss the train, Love will take me through

In my sleep I could feel the snake
Burning my body until it ached
Signed my name in blood,dream of Salvation
The morning will come, my love without reservation
This isn't the way out, there's always hope and time
If you wait on the train you'll go out of your mind
