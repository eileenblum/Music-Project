They Pay Me Lot's Of Money For What I Do
I'm A Dancer Midnight Romancer Under The Moon
I'm On The Clock And I Like To Rock
I Don't work the streets
You'll be amazed your eyes a glazed
When I do my high wire feats
Exterminater, Rawhide Gangster, I can equal the odds
I Pay for your sin with my boyish grin
I create the facade
Steady hand I'm a gentle man
I've got deadly aim
Womanizer, lone surviver I like to play the game

[chorus]
Hope you and Jesus have it all worked out
I'm A Hired Gun

There is no heaven here on earth
Love must rule us all
Black days coming
Every prideful man will fall
Have no fear or shed a tear
There will come a day
When I'm looked in the eye
Asked to die I'll hear somebody say
