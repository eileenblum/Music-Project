We don't need no burning crosses
Put out the fire of bigotry
We don't need to count our losses
When they bury you they'll bury me

I have a dream that we can be united
It will only work when fears are subsided
By the sweat of my brow I won't let it die
Freedom for our hearts is my battle cry

Poor man begging at a rich man's feet
He eats the crumbs off of the floor
We are starving for something to eat
We are whales up on the shore

[chorus]
We're living in troubled times
We're living in troubled times
How could we be so blind
We're living in troubled times

There was a time we tore our country down
For the same reasons that we fight for now
And if pride comes before a fall
Then why tell me why they tore down the wall

[chorus]
