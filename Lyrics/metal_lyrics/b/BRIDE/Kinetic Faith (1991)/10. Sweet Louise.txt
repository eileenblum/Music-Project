I can still see sweet Louise
standing there
Like a child she whispers softly to me She comes to me, I swear, I close My eyes
I still see sweet Louise
I hear the songs she used to sing
Her voice sounds so real to me
Tell me it's not a dream
my heart is strange
Like it used to feel with sweet Louise

[chorus]
Sweet Louise She's still with me
Even though she's gone
Sweet Louise she part of me
She lives in my songs
The door opened and closed
And No One knows our secret place
Where memories are safe

No one can move me like she did
No one can touch me like she did
On a rainy night how we cried
I held her hand and I kissed her goodbye

I can see you up in heaven
looking down at me
Make the dark clouds disappear
There can never be a love so sweet
She left this world without a tear

The door opened and closed
And I know we'll be together again
