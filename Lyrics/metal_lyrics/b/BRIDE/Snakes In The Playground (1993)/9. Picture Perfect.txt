Coat Hanger Alley Where The Doctors Work Cheap
Zodiac Lover Your In Too Deep
She Shakes Like A Mixer Puts Down Her Cigarette
She's Got The Sweetest Spirit I've Ever, Ever Met
Nicotine Angel With Her Head Hung Low
Felt She's Been Sucked Through A Garden Hose
One night Of Pleasure For A Lifetime Of Pain
I Watch Her Tears Roll Down Her Face Like A Heavy Rain

[chorus]
She Don't Get Her Picture Made No More
Don't Get Her Picture Made No More
It's Been A Couple Of Months Since She Walked Out The Door

She Had A Smile That Could Light Up The Day
Someones Put A Frown On Her Tray
She's All Dressed In Black Waiting On The Cable Car
I Know The Lord Won't Let Her Go That Far
If She Would Come Back She Would BE Forgiven
Resurrect Your Soul Mend Your Heart, Start Living
