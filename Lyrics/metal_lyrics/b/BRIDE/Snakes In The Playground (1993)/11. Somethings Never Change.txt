We All Have A Heart To Segregate
Is That Why She Jumped From The Golden Gate
Like A Stunt Gone Bad She Didn't Walk Away
What's Going On Here I Got Something To Say

[chorus]
Something's Never Change Like The Feeling You Know I Can't Explain

She Said She Couldn't Wait For The Light To Come
She Had Plenty Of Time Now Look What She Has Done
She Said She Felt Sick, Daddy Could Get Her High
I Believe He Gave Her One Last Ride
There Is Nothing In This World We Can't Overcome
God Have Mercy On The Things He Has Done

New's Man Says There Rioting In The Streets
A Ten Year Old Boy Has A Smoking Gun At His Feet
Carol Ann Climbed To The Top Of The Bridge Flying High
Felt Her Soul Vandalized So She Took Her Last Dive
Homicide Suicide Our Heroes Become So Weak
Poverty Bended Knee Love Is All You Need
Drug Abuse No Excuse Cause We Know The Facts
I Know It's hard Cause They Try To Break Your Back
I Believe In Incarnations Virgin Birth, and Jubilation
I Believe In Restortion Eternal Life And Celebration
Spirit Filled Intoxication It Is Not Imagination
Genesis and Revelation
Pray For Acceleration
Don't Believe In Suffocation
Can't You Hear My Suffocation
Can't You Hear My Demonstration
Not Brainwashed Indoctrination
Give Us Strength In Tribulation
Our Thoughts And Situations
There's One hope And One Salvation
It Is For Our Generation
God Is High For Exaltation
