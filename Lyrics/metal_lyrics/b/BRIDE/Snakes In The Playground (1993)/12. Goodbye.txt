She Comes To Me In My Dreams Dancing On The Stormy Seas
The Light To Guide My Way There Was Sorrow In My Mind
She Helped Me To Find My Way To The Pearly Gates
She Is Here To Say It Is Not The Same As Yesterday
You Can Change And You Don't Have To Be Alone
She Is Here To Say There Is A Better Way If You'll Open Your Heart

[chorus]
Good-bye Life That Blinded Me
Hello To The One Who Saved Me

There's A Room For Everyone Who Listens
There's A Heaven For Those Who Are Wishing
When I Get That Broken Kind Of Feeling
I Have A Friend I Can Believe In
