When You Lay It Down For The Money Or Life
Will You Come To Me
When You Die For The Money Or Life
How Long Will It Be
When Your Hung On A Cross Beside The Savior Of Life
Don't You Confort Me
What's More Important Your Money Or Life
Would You Die For Me

[chorus]
Would You Die For Me Honey
Would You
Would You Cry For Me Honey
Would You

Are You In Love With Jesus Christ
Would You Die For Me
If You See Me And My Bones Consumed
Will You Feed Me
If I Were To Stand On The Edge Of My Mind
Would You Give Your Wings To Me
Would You Still Wear The Thorns If I Denied You Thrice
Would You Love Me

If You See Me Wounded Lost Roadside Boy
Would You Carry Me
If I Were A Preacher Man Bound For Glory
Would You Follow Me
If I Became Captain Hi-Top Ego Star
Would You Worship Me
If I Fall Like The Apple From A Tree
Would You Shine On Me
