Dropping Rattlesnakes In The Playground
Are We Evil Are We Good
Dropping Rattlesnakes In The Playground
Would You Save Them If You Could

What Are The Children To Do With It
Kill The Mules In South America
This Is The Sewer Where The Filth Unite
This Is The Place Where Dark Tramples The Light

[chorus]
It Used To Be Pretty Now It's Such A Pity
Brings Out The Animal In All Of Us
No More Sad Sob Stories
No More Preaching And Crying
Falling Like Soldiers Of Fortune

It Won't Get Any Better It will Only Get Worse
Cry To God And Plead The Fifth
Who Is To Blame For Our Demise
Cleanse Our Hands From All The Lies

[chorus]

This Spirit Is Willing But The Flesh Is Weak
Cain Visits Able The Earth The Meek
Lift Up The Children When You Can
Jezebel's Cocaine In The Devil's Hand
