There's A Place I'd Like To Go Back To
Time Seems To Set Still
We Ran Wild We Had No Cares
Take Me Back To That Place
I Wish There Was A Door I Could Walk Right Through
To Escape This Life
I Want To Go Back To What We Had
Times Were Better Then

[chorus]
I Mis The Rain I Miss The Rain
My Heart's Been Dry Like The Tear In My Eye
I Miss The Rain I Miss The Rain
My Heart's Been Dry Like The Tear In My Eye
And The Pain I Feel Lord I Miss The Rain

It Keeps Me Young When I Remember
In My Mind The Past Still Lives
I've held Onto Every Thought, It Keeps Me So Alive
The Future Holds Nothing For Me
Cause I Can't Hold You
I Used To Try And Change The World
Now I Change A Little For myself

I Know There Are Those Far Sadder than I
They lost Things They Can't Replace
Like The Beauty In Their Eyes
But Through It All, One Thing Is Constant And Remains
The Love Of God Erases All My Pain
