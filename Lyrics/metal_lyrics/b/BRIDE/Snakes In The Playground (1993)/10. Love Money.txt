Theres A War Around Disney Land There Is No Love They Don't Understand
Free Falling Through America
They Have No Family With A Gun In Hand
It's A Wold Self Contained
Wear No Clothes But They Have A Name
See It In There Eyes
Racial Genocide Blood On The Streets

[chorus]
Love, Money Prison Crime
No Graffiti Doing Time Safe House Wearing Scars Got To Prove Who They Are

They Had To Leave Their Mother Land
Sanctuary For The Rebel Man
Where Are Your Machine Guns Stashed
Freedom Is You Cocaine In The Kitchen Trash
They Lived In Violence All Their Life
Step Over Bodies Day And Night
They Have A Habit Of Spreading Fear, Here In America

We Open Our Arms, We Open Our Doors
World On Our Shoulders, Hope On The Shores
We Stand Strong We Have Barred Our Soul
There's An Epidemic Makes My Heart So Cold
