You Say He's Weak He's A Super Freak
Don't Believe That He Came
Say God Is Dead You Lost Your Head
You Got Him Swingin' From A Chain
You Can Be Saved But Your Diggin' Your Own Grave
I Beggin' You To Come Back
King Of Kings The Angels Sing I Think The Sky Has Cracked

[chorus]
That's The Way You See Him Psychedelic Super Jesus

Get High To Remember Take A Drink To Forget
It's All Profanity
You Still Got Him On A Cross
Your Heart Is Lost
You Nailed Him To A Hippie Tree
Say Light My Fire Full Of Desire
Don't You Die On Me
The Rope Is Slippin' Your Voodoo Trippin'
You're Not A Pretty Sight To See

God Is Love Power In The Blood
Seek And You Will Find
Today Is The Day Better Give It Away
There's No Better Time
Will You Learn He Will Return
It's No Small Thing To Me
I Tell You Now I'll Show You The Shining Glory
