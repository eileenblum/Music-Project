Share Your Lust, Inflick Your Pain
Vally Of Guilt, Hour Of Shame
Rest The Reason To The Skin
I Watched You Die In Your Sin

[chorus]
Fallout Against My House

Tuning It Up Inside My Head
When I'm Asleep On My Bed
They Try To Say There Is No God
People Praying To The Dark

Fallout Against My House The End Will Come Generation, Revelation Tribulation

On My Belly If I Have To Craw
l Warn This World Before It Falls
I'll Put Your Hand From The Button Of Doom
If I Can Break Out Of This Tiny Room
