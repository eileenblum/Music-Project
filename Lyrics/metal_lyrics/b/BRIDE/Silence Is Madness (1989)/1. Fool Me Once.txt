All the gods have fallen 
Grace trampled under feet 
Stepping down, making lies 
Lips speaking in deceit 
Gods of silver, gods of gold 
Donations sell your soul 
They try to tell us what to do 
They'll never take me for al fool 

Religion, forgiven, paradise living 
Dynasty, make-beleive, spiritual fantasy 

Fool me once, shame on you 
Fool me twice, shame on me 

Don't you see what they've become 
All the damage they have done 
You know what gives my spine a chill 
I see them getting richerstill 
All the gods are tising 
Is it really so surprising 
Turn them off they'll go away 
No need to hear what they say
