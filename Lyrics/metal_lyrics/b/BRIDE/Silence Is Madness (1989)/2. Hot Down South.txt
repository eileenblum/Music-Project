She gave the devil her soul now she's crying 
Boodoo in louisiana, she's dying 
Lost her dreams, torture and screams 
Broken promises he's lying 

Clipped her wings now she's falling 
She is deaf the savior is calling 
Satan won the bet, on his private jet 
Good-bye to ballroom waltzing 

It's hot down south tonight 

No amount of money can buy it back 
All her loose change dropped through the crack 
He could always shake her, now he wants to break her 
In the back of his cadillac 

Signed her name on the rosary 
Unchained her green like a deadly disease 
She lost her chance but the girl got to dance 
Forever lives with the guilt and shame 

Bought an acre in a place called hell 
They say that everyone's soul is for sale 
If greed's our dream we may be awakened 
To find it vanished and ourselves mistaken
