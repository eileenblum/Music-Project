I don't need no doctor
To tell me i'm a sick man 
Don't need no doctor 
To give me a helping hand 
I need to roll those blues 
Rock those blues away 

I don't need nobody
To ease my aching mind 
Don't need nobody
Complaing all the time 
I need to roll those blues 
Rock those blues away 
Gonna rock those blues away 

I don't need no bottle
Talking to me 
I don't need no bottle
Full of misery 
I gonna rock those blues away 

Let me tell you brother 
What i need 

I need a smooth playing guitar, in my hand 
Listen to the rhythm of my band
