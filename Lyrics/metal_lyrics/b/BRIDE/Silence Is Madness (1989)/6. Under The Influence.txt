The sky grew black and like an engine humming 
I could tell it was my time 
I could hear the sound of my heart beat thumping 
And the echoes in my mind 

Just like the prophet spoke, babe it's not a joke 
Don't take another sip of wine 
You better leave the bottle 
Cause it's coming full throttle 
And it's going to mess with your mind 

Under the influence 
Yeah, 
Killing the innocent 
No, 

See the eyes of the innocent cause you ebarrasment 
Will i make it out alive 
I can beg, i can pleadm or watch you bleed 
You know i'm not afraid to die 

Don't be cedeived by what you might see 
It gets worse for me everyday 
I could tell you things that you might not believe 
They hightway shows me the way 

I steer to the left and i setter to the right 
I hear their fatal screams 
I never drink more than i really need 
It's always worse than it seems
