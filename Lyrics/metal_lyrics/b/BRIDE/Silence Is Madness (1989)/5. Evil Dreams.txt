All my life i've searched for power 
The ability to do or act 
To gain control over the simple lines 
To show the wise fiction from fact 

Evil dreams
They come to me in my sleep 
Evil dreams
They won't get the rest of me 

Every day my energy was released 
So effective but very deceiving 
Hinest expression to cheat the children 
Foist upon to leave the mothers grieving 

Rip. tear, shred, bleed, no surrender 'til i'm freed 
Threash, smash, evil mind, blood is shed save mankind 
Kick, scratch, bite, claw, no matter what it takes 
Push, shove, punch, crawl, fighting to be saved 
Stand, fight, turn or run, can you take the pain to come 
Lust, love, trust, deceit, can you swallow what you eat 
Whiplash, bent and twisted, got to stand double fisted 
Please believe me when i say it's noso easy on this stage 

In just a slight of the hand, authority was gifted to me 
Hallucination manifest, who was blind and who could see 
The earth was my water, anger filled my well 
I was the devil, she was my hell
