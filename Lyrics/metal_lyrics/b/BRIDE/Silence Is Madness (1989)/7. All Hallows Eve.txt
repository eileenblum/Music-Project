This black day is a special one 
Tric or treat the house of fun 
Dress up, make up, costume delight 
Poison kids until midnight 
Little do they know, what it really means 
Rip your heart out, at it's very seams 
This is the night, they all come to meet 
To wager and practice, their mystical deceit 

One magical night 
Running from the light 
All hallow's eve 

They see themselves as something they're not 
What will they do when the thrill wears off 
When they fall who picks them up 
Who do they turn to when they need love 
Where are they going, in what direction 
In the dark, there's no satisfaction 
And when you hear the wings. beat the stinging air 
Don't let the reaper, blind you with his stare
