I hear the drums pounding to take me away 
Toaring with thinder shattering the break of day 
And voices chilling me with harmonic terror 
This prison remains my hell forever 
The marching footsteps of soldiers rattle the walls 
Tumbling stones of tribulation the gain quiver of the innocent calls 
And the rain fills the cracks made in the ground 
By the bombs dropped unexpectedly without a sound 
Darkness rolls through the air, blanket of doom shadow of death 
Lightning blisters the sky, the lips of the earth to caress 
My eyes i will close, one by one they die by violence 
I will turn my back to the madness and breathe the silence 

There is a town where no man walks 
The streets are silent and the walls don't talk 
Still in the past a ghost may wait 
To open the door or close the gate 
And though time has passed them by 
A day will come when the sectrets will die 
Upon the mountain strong and high 
In the darkness the mystery lies 

Silence is madness 
Silence is madness around the world 

Warden misn in ancient halls 
People scraping on the walls 
A chapter of voices are crying 
To the cloudless night are flying 
And when you hear the wind whistle and moan 
You'll pray for the light to be shown 
When the darkness turns to gray 
Forever has come and one more day 

Upon the air the land is red 
Tombstone of the bloody dead 
Let the land shine and then will burn 
For soon my friend your king will return 
Touching the muted hearts that cry 
Brings us closer to ta space in time 
Sometimes our words are too misleading 
When no one smiles and all is weeping
