Satisfies your mind can't save your soul 
Would you die for rock 'n' roll 
Get your feet moving your hands in the air 
Scream it out everywhere 

Until the end we rock 
Until the end we rock 
No we'll never stop 
Until the end we rock 

Only pleasure in the whole wide world 
Play music for the guys and girls 
There's a reason i sing my song 
I love the sage that i'm on 

Make a fist, fly 'em high 
Lift your voice to the sky 
Must make noise to be heard 
Shout it out with strong proud words 
I only come alive at the pitch of night 
Do the show under the blinding lights 
Raise my cross, i'll bleed for you 
How my soul cries out to you
