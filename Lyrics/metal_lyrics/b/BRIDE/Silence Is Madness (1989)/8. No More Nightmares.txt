The night is alive
It calls out your name 
Say your prayer
To ease your pain 

I try to hold on one more day 
I pray the vision will fade away 
So afraid to close my eyes 
I don't want to die 

No more nightmares
No more crime 
No more nightmares
No more bedtime 

All the children seem alone
Crying in the night 
Dry your eyes
Love is alive 

It seems the time is forever slipping by 
And i wonder how much time we really have 
With destruction in our way, will there be another day 
Won't you save us from ourselves
