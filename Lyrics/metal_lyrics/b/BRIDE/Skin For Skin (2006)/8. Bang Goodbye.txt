Living off the fumes of my fading reputation
Looking down the road at my darling aggravation
Craving a hit star struck infatuation
Chained like a dog choking humiliation

Got myself in another tight situation
Living on an island simple imagination
Breathing hard with feeble calculations
My mind spreads its wings universal liberation

Living with hope chemical frustration
My flesh is burning with carnal limitations
War within spiritual castration
Armageddon goes bang goodbye the population

[Chorus:]
I want I need, Jesus didn't fail
I feel I love, Come on, Come on
A world where no one cries
A world where no one dies
I'll find my way back home

Acid in my eyes, Gall upon my tongue
Cyanide and vinegar I stole a handful from the sun
Is it time, I've seen the priest
Wearing black white color glow
There's nothing he can do for me
