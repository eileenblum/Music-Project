Her hair was the color of redemption
She had almond lips her skin was alive
She was looking for a new Savior
Didn't want to be left behind

Have you ever seen a girl?
With clouds in her eyes
Her face as clear as a summer's day
She was eternally alive

She leaves me breathless, hypnotized, mystified
This is the power of the crucified an endless life

She don't wear cheap distractions
Like the neon ghost inside
She's addicted to the experience
And all the scars she could find

She makes me hear the earth spin
I've been a broken penny in a well
She is the spine laid in my back
Got me holding my breath again
