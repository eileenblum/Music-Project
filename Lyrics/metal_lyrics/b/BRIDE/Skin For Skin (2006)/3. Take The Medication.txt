You are my deliberate infectious
You are my confessed and addiction
You are my welcomed restriction
You are my damaged contradiction

You are my self induced affliction
You are my septic convictions
You are my unsaved thoughts
Now I got to let you go

There is one answer thereâs one touch
Salvation is on your tongue
There is one answer thereâs one touch
So don't you ever come undone

Take the medication
If it makes you pray
Take the medication
If it makes you stay
Take the medication
There's no other way
Take the medication
If it dulls the pain
