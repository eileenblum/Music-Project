I'm going super nova
She's the perfect holy rolla
If the stars refuse to shine
Let me down for the glorified
Just lead me to the stage
That's where I'll be found
I'll be born again no kamikaze sound

It's a slow burn a slow burn
I'm a super ego star
Gotcha gotcha by the hand
World gets more bizarre

Gothic black city
Star gazer what a pity
Making sense of shattered souls
Bethlehem's child
Dropped in a world gone wild
No tears today
just a sun face glow

While I'm burning pray for me
This is not who I'm supposed to be
Dear sweet Jesus meet me half way
Between here and the grave
