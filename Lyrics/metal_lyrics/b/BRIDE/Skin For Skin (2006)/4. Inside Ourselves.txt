Flowers on my grave Jesus saves that's the bitter taste of blackness
Eyes closed tight, pitch of night, starring into the face of blindness
If I'm possessed if I confess kneeling feeling the earth beneath
Stumbling mumbling it ends at the cross,
Undistinguished words make me complete.

Gazing, Raising, instinctively up, warmth to wrap the coldness
Draining, straining, all in me waning, to muster the faith of boldness
Teaching, reaching, outward and on, to touch what lays before me
Coping hoping to find a recall
Never disappointed in what I see.

We only live inside ourselves
Until someone takes us out of here

You got to stand for something
You've got to stop the suffering
