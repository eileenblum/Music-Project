Stupid mistake the life I take
Will be my own broken home
Ain't helped me none so I am done
Starring at the end losing the fight
Planning to end it all by night
One wrong turn is all it took
Nowhere to run nowhere to look

As I look outside my door
See nothing left to live for
I've already tried everything
I have no one else to blame
Here I am at my end
Don't even know when it began
All I know is it's through
I'm not the one you thought you knew

Hang on
Momma stop the bullet from rushing to my head
Hang on
Momma stop the bullet from rushing to my head

Have no where to go from here
Seems like so many years
Have already came and went
So much time never spent
Wondering how to fight the pain
Dry the tears that fall like rain
Scared to death running blind
I have nothing left to hide
