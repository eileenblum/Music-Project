All power and lying wonders to take it all
He comes to everyone like a serpent he may crawl
He will come to touch your bone and flesh
Hoping that you will curse God under your breath

He will give you all that your heart desires
If you don't mind judgment in a Lake of Fire
He cannot be divided you don't know his depths
You will serve him well if you turn stone to bread

Skin for Skin
The seeds are sown
You're by yourself
But you are not alone

Overcoming, standing, walking, living, in the victory of him
Who is holy and him who is true
That makes us a pillar in the temple of god
I will make you â I will make you

Who can he bind that is not already bound?
Only those who cast themselves down
In a religious world that pacifies
He is always there to paganize

He doesn't know a thing about a man made hell
His work is to destroy you in this earthly realm
To cast you into prison in unholy cell
To deceive the world to break them at their will
