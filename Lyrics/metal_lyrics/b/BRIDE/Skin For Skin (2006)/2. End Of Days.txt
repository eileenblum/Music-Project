From the beginning of the garden to the end and the grave
Salvation of all comes by the cross, the blood, the life the name
Every man, women and child followed Adam to the grave
Your flesh he will destroy that your spirit will be saved

End of days, end of days, the age is over
Embrace the revelation

Forever feels like sunshine

Tasted death for every man suffered for your sins
Not willing that any should perish can you comprehend?
Some will be saved so as by fire, the past is burned away
First Begotten of the dead Light of the world today

I saw the dead small and great stand before the throne
I heard a voice out of heaven calling His children home
Concluded them all in unbelief he'll have mercy on everyone
By His grace and peace the Spirit and the Bride say come
