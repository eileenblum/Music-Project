I've knelt at the cross held His burnished feet
I have embraced the body lifeless in my arms
I laid His head upon His pillow so gently
And watched the stone be rolled

Living not dead giving I said

Christ lives in me

Rise above, rise above it all
Rise above, rise above it all
When are we going to rise above it all?

I watched and I prayed and I fell asleep again
When I awoke there was no sign of Him
The Tomb it was empty no body no sign
And I fell to the earth defeated and I cried

Why do you weep?
Where have they laid Him?
He spoke my name
Promised to never forsake us.

I laid His head upon His pillow so gently
And watched the stone be rolled
The Tomb it was empty no body no sign
And I fell to the earth defeated and I cried
