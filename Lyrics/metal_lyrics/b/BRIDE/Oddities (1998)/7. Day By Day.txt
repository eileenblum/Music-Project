I'm sick, I've tried not to show it 
I pray to God that no one has noticed 
But I grow weaker day by day 
My face is pale my hair turns gray 
It's hard to find the joy I once knew 
What has crawled into my bones? 
Made me brittle, made me old 
All of my dreams are about God 
When I dream about God 
When I dream its about God 
Confusion is my enemy 
Restore my soul of faith from reasoning 
Jesus save me from obscurity 
From the hour, the moment of grief 
But I grow weaker day by day 
My face is pale my hair turns gray 
Hard to imagine the boy I once knew
