It's obvious what the world wants 
To wipe away God's fingerprints in all his intellect 
To know divine authority exists 
No accountability or reason to repent 
Man is not thankful in their futility 
They imagine themselves to be wise 
Their foolish hearts are full of darkness 
They don't see the power of the cross is life 
God's Human Oddities 
Live for the flesh embraced until the end 
Mortify the deed of the flesh (die in the end) 
Why do you deny the existence of love? 
Say no one looks down (on you) from above 
To be free of God is to not be free at all 
It means having no one to hear you when you call 
All songs by Bride
