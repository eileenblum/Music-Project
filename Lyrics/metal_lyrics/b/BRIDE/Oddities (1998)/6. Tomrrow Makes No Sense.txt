I didn't choose this face 
Or this shell of skin I'm trapped in 
You're not worthy to loose my shoes 
You don't know where they've been 
I am my own enemy 
I will lie to myself 
I will talk to God 
But He won't talk to me 
I want no sin, I want no fear 
No sting of conscience, no care of death 
I want peace, not as the world gives 
Tomorrow makes no sense 
Only Jesus sees my heart 
My hope is that He knows my mind 
He will bring me out of this 
If I can scratch the crust from my eyes 
Inflict my own wounds 
Torture my own soul 
I choose to be the beggar 
Break the bonds of my yoke
