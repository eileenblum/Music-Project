Like the virus in my veins 
A broken window pane 
Jaws are locked into place 
Mingled cup thrown in my face 
I live in a house of clay 
Violated and dismayed 
I don't want to be a dream 
In somebody else's sleep 
It is only when I'm left alone 
That I pervert what is sown 
Blood and skin beneath my nails 
Reflects the emptiness of hell 
Then I squirm in my bed 
Pull the sheets around my head 
Soaking wet in a pool of sweat 
Pray for me, I'm not dead 
Take me out with the garbage 
And don't you compromise 
'Cause that's all we really are 
Until we confess the lie
