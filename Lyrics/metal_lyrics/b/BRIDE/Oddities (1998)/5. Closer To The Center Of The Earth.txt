The city of the dead is full of exhibitionists 
Dancing in the streets in their bones 
The hounds have the scent and they're on the trail 
Chase them into the cave where darkness dwells 
If my sin remains I have chosen my god 
Choose this day who you will serve 
As for me and my house 
We will serve the Lord 
From high lofty window tops you see 
Peering through the oil and scum 
Praying the door is locked 
They see the chase below through the avenue 
And you think those bones look like you 
The dead are all around in a state of decay 
And you are safe in a secret place 
Not of things you've earned or deserve 
But you have been called out of this world 
They're walking closer to the center of the earth 
All along they think they're exploring the universe 
They'll never prove that God doesn't exist 
'Cause God took away all their evidence
