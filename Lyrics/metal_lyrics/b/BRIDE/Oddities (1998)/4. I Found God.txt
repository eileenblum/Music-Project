I want peace in my life 
But there's always a sword 
The child in me 
Has become a man of war 
It's not flesh and blood 
It's forces unseen 
I'm carried to higher places 
Than I've ever been 
I will not fear 
What man can do 
Survival is a painful toil 
Give me strength to see it through 
I found God 
I want you to know 
I found God 
Where He leads, I will follow 
What He pours, I will swallow 
When He twists, I will bend 
All my trust in Him 
My tears have been my meat 
Deep calls unto the deep 
Fill my wanting mouth 
With good things renewed 
In the Garden of Indecision 
I have no apprehension 
I am nothing without You
