Contradiction is the word which best suits this life 
A life of right and wrong, where wrong is twisted into right 
The heart is exploding and the mind is racing 
And we find ourselves running out of human breath 
The stale life of routine wavers and stagnates 
And we experiment and toil in the fertile ground 
The answers are seldom given to unpopular questions 
Justify our hearts by what we selfishly hope to achieve 
I will live my life 
Under the blood 
All signs point deliberately the other way 
The road is slow and misery will be our company 
For to find true peace in this life we must forsake 
All reason and conscience and cleave to God's faith 
Peace comes from above 
I have found no other 
If we remove ourselves from that hope 
Can love truly prevail?
