Where the body is the eagles will gather 
Lift me up and give me your strength 
To fly across the great divide 
The promised land is just over on the other side 
I ain't coming down 
Once there was a promise, now there is hope 
Restore the righteous thirst of my soul 
A river ran which touched both sides 
Brought healing and restored from the ground to the sky 
I mounted wings from the bright morning star 
Let the wind lift me from my feet 
No resistance, nothing clouding my eye 
No greater feeling than the freedom to fly 
Look down in the valley below 
With Your word be justified 
I see a place where it never rains 
The old footprints still remain
