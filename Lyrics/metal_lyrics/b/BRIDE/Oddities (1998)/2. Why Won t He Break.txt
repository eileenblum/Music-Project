Indulging in the calamities 
Nun's faces down in the mud near the ridge 
Are their backs as strong as their faith? 
The soldiers march on a human bridge 
Gorge with lust until they're fat with pride 
Elevate through the darkness out of the mind 
Bruise the back with your sharp tongue 
Push down on his head and crush his lungs 
Laugh out loud 'til he goes deaf 
Tear at the heart within his chest 
His rob of flesh he won't deny 
Use ignorance to crush the apple of his eye 
Part the garments, smell the clothes 
The scent of death lingers in your nose 
The anger is ripe until the veins explode 
Hold him down, lay on the stone
