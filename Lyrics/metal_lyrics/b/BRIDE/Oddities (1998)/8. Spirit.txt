I don't like what I hear 
That you're going to be leaving 
That you are going away 
Don't leave me comfortless 
If you save your life 
You will lose it 
Lose your life 
And find it 
(NEVER BE ASHAMED) 
Send back Your spirit 
To speak of You 
A new peace the world won't find 
A New Hope of love in time 
Left us Your peace 
We will abide in You 
The world will hate us 
'Cause it hated You 
What will we do? 
Once You have gone 
We will miss You 
Where will You go? 
Gain the whole world 
And lose your soul 
Deny yourself 
And never be ashamed
