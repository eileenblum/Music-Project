The devil has ears but he can't hear 
Except what you tell him from a heart of fear 
And now you spit out words just to see 
Where they splatter upon me 
Die a little bit / Die a little bit every day 
Through painful toil of absolution 
Swimming up from uneasy dreams 
On a continent adrift from its morals 
You find yourself a desperate man 
Jesus based in solidity 
I'm balanced to conceive 
When things are revealed to me 
I move past perplexity 
Locusts came early from the west 
To test his resolve 
Only difference between war and peace 
Is where we place our bombs
