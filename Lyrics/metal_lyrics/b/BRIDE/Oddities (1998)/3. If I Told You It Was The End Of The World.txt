God's truth doesn't leave me dry 
I put it right in your face 
You push it away for concept 
Then gather what remains 
If I told you it was the end of the world 
Would you change your ways? 
When the sun is gone day is done 
You're pasted in a book of despondency 
Hopelessness will digest your will to live 
Within your mind of despair. 
Where do you think you're going? 
Spinning on this little ball 
If this footstool is your heaven 
Better hope this rock don't fall
