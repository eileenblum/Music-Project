I'm a man given to much prayer 
Never been tempted by strong drink 
I'm not afraid to call Jesus Lord 
I have no fear of the fires below 
And if you break my spine 
You can't break my will 
Try to strip me of my gift 
My reward - you can't steal 

Eat with the sinners they might be saints 
Beautiful are the feet that obey 
How shall they believe if I'm not sent 
A man forsakes his childish ways 

And if you break my spine 
You can't break my will 
Try to strip me of my gift 
My reward 

Follow me I know the way 
I am saying what no one will say 
Follow me follow me 

I dip this pen into my heart 
Write from my soul 
If ink were blood 
I'd be still and cold 

Follow me I know the way 
I am saying what no one will say 
Follow me follow me
