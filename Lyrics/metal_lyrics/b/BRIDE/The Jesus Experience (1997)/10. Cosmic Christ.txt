Religious fanatics and their cosmic Christ 
Spin doctors liberating giving life 
Authenticity judges the politically correct 
Denominational axe grinds the spirit from the flesh 
Lost divinity in disguise 
Goddess in embryo to materialize 

Fuming fundamentalists hungry liaty 
Cannibalistic naturalist proving fallacy 
Burden of proof lies in legitimate faith 
Read between the lines of saving grace 

Lost divinity in disguise 
Goddess in embryo to materialize 

Cut to the bone how deep it goes 
Cut to the bone blood flows 

Lost divinity in disguise 
Goddess in embryo to materialize 

Rejection of supernatural truth 
Domesticated academic agnostic fools 
Theologians with the promises of politics 
Counter-cultural wisdom rhetoric 

Lost divinity in disguise 
Goddess in embryo to materialize
