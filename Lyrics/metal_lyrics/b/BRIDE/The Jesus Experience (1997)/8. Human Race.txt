Born into iniquity 
No one is immune 
Die to the grave 
Everyone the same 
One race the human race 
It's no discrimination 
One race the human race 
It's moral deterioration 

Hate mongers 
Know no peace 
Chaotic minds 
Swim in blood 

One race the human race 
It's no discrimination 
One race the human race 
It's moral deterioration 

Who will stand 
In the end 
Except the ones 
Who are called by Him
