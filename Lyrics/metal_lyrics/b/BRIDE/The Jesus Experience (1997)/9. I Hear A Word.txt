Voices haunting me accusing me from within 
They are present with me making me behave 
Spirit never condemns never talks to himself 
Spirit never condemns never talks to himself 

I hear a word 
I hear a word resting on me 
I hear a word 
I hear a word resting on me 
Inspired 

In my selfishness my pride did swell 
I must learn to serve in all humility 

In the valley of darkness I never stopped to rest 
Cleansed by the word washed by the blood
