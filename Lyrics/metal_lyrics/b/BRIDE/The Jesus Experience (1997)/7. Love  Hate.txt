The cross You wear 
The lips that swear 
The heart that tears apart 
The do's and dare's 
The troubled shared 
The pain that causes want 
The arm of flesh 
The kiss of death 
The infant sings of resurrect 
Eyes that lust 
Love waxed in rust 
Finally rest in earth's sweet dust 
Bless the ones who persecute 
Love those who hate you 
Bless the ones who persecute 
Love those who hate you 

Who are the enemies of the cross 
And who finds it a stumbling block 
Who can endure despising and shame 
On the instrument of pain 
Promises kept and Jesus wept 
All four corners have been swept 
To each his own 
We should have known 
That Father God would call His children home 

Bless the ones who persecute 
Love those who hate you 
Bless the ones who persecute 
Love those who hate you
