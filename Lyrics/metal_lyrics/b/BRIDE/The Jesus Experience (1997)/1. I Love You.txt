If I were a ship on the ocean would You throw me a sail 
If I were locked away in a prison would You pay my bail 
If I were thirsty in the desert would You give me a drink 
Naked on the scorching street would You walk right over me 

If I had no place to sleep would You give me your bed 
If I were a stranger in a strange land would You leave me for dead 
If I were nailed to a cross would You scream save yourself 
If I became the curse would You remove the nails 

I love You 
I love You 
I love You 
I love You 

To the least of these You done to me 
-To the least of these 
To the least of these You done to me 
-To the least of these 

If I live in a glass house would You throw me a stone 
If I asked for only meat would You give me the bone 
If I asked for a fish would You hand me a snake 
If I begged for a single egg would You say just live by faith
