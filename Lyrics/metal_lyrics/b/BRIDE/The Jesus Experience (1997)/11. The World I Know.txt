I looked back to see it all 
Like a moth to the flame 
Stopped pushing pulled my hand from the plow 
I looked back looked down 
Embraced the world - closed my soul 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
One last glance at the world I know 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 

All my sins forgiven me 
Except the sin of apology* 
Holy Ghost I do swear 
Like a sound in the air 

Embraced the world - closed my soul 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
One last glance at the world I know 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 

To forgive is a must 
Give and it will be given to you 
Good measure pressed down 
Shaken together and running over you 

Embraced the world - closed my soul 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
One last glance at the world I know 
Looked back - looked back - looked down 
Looked back - looked back - looked down
