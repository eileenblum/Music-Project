The sun shined through poking holes in the sky 
Like cigarette burns on the bed sheet 
Sound the horn step down with a shout 
The earth and the sun are gonna burn out 
Til the end 
Til the end of the world I'll be with You 
Til the end 
Til the end of the world I'll be with You 

Sold her soul to pay the rent 
And the baby won't stop crying 
Take my life before I take it myself 
Because today she feels like dying 

Til the end 
Til the end of the world I'll be with You 
Til the end 
Til the end of the world I'll be with You 

She drops acid to find God 
Falling angels roaming through her head 
He has a handgun he calls Christ 
Say they like talking 
With the dead 

Looking at the ceiling when she saw the sky 
Saw a door open the light burned her eyes 
Spirit moved through the mulberry trees 
Hold onto Jesus don't hold onto me
