You don't know how it feels to be me 
To be sitting on the edge dangling my feet 
Wondering if God would give His angels charge 
If I was feeling small 
If my mind was growing large 
I am the worm crawling through your head 
I am the worm crawling through your head 

You don't know how it feels to be me 
Having all these faces looking in to see 
Their eyes are white lit just like a torch 
To burn my soul which is thin and which is worn 

I am the worm crawling through your head 
I am the worm crawling through your head 
I am the worm crawling through your head 
I am the worm crawling through your head 

Take my life 
Take my life 
Take my life 
Before I take it myself 

You don't know how it feels to be me 
To be a poet nailed to this tree 
Where are my accusers those who ridicule 
Those who have learned to hate and curse this silly fool
