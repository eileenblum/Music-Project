Deny yourself die to the flesh 
No conceit - pride of life 
Law of grace - serve in love 
Wait for hope of righteousness 

Pluck out my eyes - my sight to You 
Walk a mile - I'll walk two 
Turn my cheek - state of grace 
I have left all 

If I live - I live - I live for You 
If I die - I die - I die for You 
If I live - I live - I live for You 

So I speak with tongues of angels 
Speak with wisdom of men 
Give my body to be born 
Without love I am sin 

Deny yourself die to the flesh 
No conceit - pride of life 
Law of grace - serve in love 
Wait for hope of righteousness 

Give me life liberty I want to be free 
Give me life liberty I want to be free
