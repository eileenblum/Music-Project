Tell me 
Tell me - is this what you want 
Tell me - is that what you meant 
Tell me - what is rolling off my tongue 
Tell me - sugar coated from my lips 

I don't ever 
I don't ever 
Want to feel this way again 
I don't ever 
I don't ever 
What to feel this way again 

Tell me 
Tell me - would you rather hear me scream 
Tell me - or preach the word to you 
Tell me - spoon fed choke it down 
Tell me - will I ever get through 

Tell me 
Tell me - am I living in prophecy 
Tell me - the worlds so sad and ugly 
Tell me - let me help you to your feet 
Tell me - no one's gracious in defeat
