I'm the man in white 
The eagle in flight 
I'm clean and pure 
My heart is sure 
I'm dressed to kill 
I've got the strings of fire 
Screaming guitars 
Energy that will explode 
Got the golden throat 
To put on the show 
The power I will unload 
Here comes the bride 
Got feet of brass 
I'm first and last 
Sharp two edged sword 
Nail scars 
I hold the stars 
I live forever more
