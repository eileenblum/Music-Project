Can you see the sorrow in my eyes 
You know it's your behavior that I despise 
I search for what is truth 
You wonder what's in it for you 
You wonder if you can make it through 

Because I sing in all the wrong places 
Because I'm seen with all the wrong faces 
Its not just the music they fear 
But the words I sing strike so near 
That's right, That's metal might 

The ones with power they have control 
(you know) Their mere words will direct your soul 
My words of steel carry through the night 
Leaving behind the wake of metal might 

Because I sing in all the wrong places 
Because I'm seen with all the wrong faces 
Its not just the music they fear 
But the words I speak are so clear
That's right, That's metal might
