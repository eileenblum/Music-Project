You're just a kiss away from your destiny 
Just a word away from deceiving a friend 
You must go to your own place 
Crying over eternal fate 
Judas kiss, Judas kiss 
Out for blood, you're out for blood 
You slip a note under the table 
And wait for a handful of change 
You've grown weak, honor is lost 
You got the ransom He paid the cost
