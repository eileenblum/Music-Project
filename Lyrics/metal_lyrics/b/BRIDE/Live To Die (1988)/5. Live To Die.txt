I'm not going to be the one to tell you 
That we don't need guns 
But I know one thing for sure 
We don't need more war 
I won't be the one to say 
That you need religion 
But without a Savior 
There's no chance to be forgiven 
I'm not the preacher, I'm not the priest 
I'm not the devil, I'm not the beast 
I'm not a prophet, I'm not a witch 
Live to die, die to live 
I won't be the one to say 
There's some things you can't deny 
But I know one thing for sure 
True love will never die 
I won't be the one to say 
That we are all damned 
But I know one thing for sure 
We're children of the Lamb
