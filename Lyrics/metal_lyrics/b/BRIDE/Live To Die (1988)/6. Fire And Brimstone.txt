All the words have been said 
No new visions or chapters to be read 
Every song has been sung 
Tolling bells have been rung 
No more babies can be born 
Vows of oath can't be sworn 
The last bent knee has repent 
Lightning from the sky has been sent 
I am coming for you 
Soon you will know 
Everybody has a chance 
Fire and brimstone 
All the wars have been fought 
No criminals to be caught 
Complete lies have entirely spread 
No more graves to bury the dead
