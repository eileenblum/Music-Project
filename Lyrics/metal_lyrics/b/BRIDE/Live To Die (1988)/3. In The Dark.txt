Things I've held close have passed away 
So I try to look for a brighter day 
Memories of my past haunts my destiny 
My dreams are illusions inside of me 
Is nothing for real I can't tell no more 
I've never been in this place before 
There has got to be a way out of here 
Nothing but blackened walls I'm getting scared 
In the dark, don't be afraid of the dark 
No rest for the wicked, I know that now 
I'm ready to rest but I don't know how 
I had surrendered my soul to the evil side 
I need your love Lord to survive
