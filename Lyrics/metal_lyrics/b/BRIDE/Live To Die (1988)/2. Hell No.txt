Close the hatches and lower the sails 
The wind is whipping great balls of hail 
Tempest is raging pulling us down 
Time to learn to swim or time to drown 
Oars have broken your time to kneel 
The storm is screaming with vengeance to kill 
Faith has plunged into the sea beneath 
Waves beat the ship with iron fist to sink 
We won't go to Hell, no we won't go [2x]
(All aboard) 
Fear is the driver we fight for our lives 
We're not afraid of death but we don't want to die 
Prayed outloud and clung to the deck 
No glory for sailors when they've been ship wrecked
