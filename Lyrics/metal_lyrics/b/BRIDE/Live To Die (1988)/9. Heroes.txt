If you try and walk this earth alone
The jackal cry can chill you to the bone

But you're a warrior
Death has no sting
Searching the ruins
For the angle with the broken wing

You saw the dragon fall
A sword through his heart
His kingdom divided
Torn apart

Battle lines are drawn
The streets are clear
The city is hidden
In a holy fear

The fog was thick and dripping wet
Flame boiling and beads of sweat
Legs grow weary
Lungs are weak
Throat so dry you can hardly speak

Cobwebs stream across your path
The distance is still
The swords to clash
Batting eyes
The wars still rage
Those beastly demons performing on stage

I'm standing on the sword of the dragon
He can't pull it from beneath of my feet
Down in the darkened cavern
In the field of blood I'll watch him bleed

Watching the smoke rise from the wounded hero
Standing dazed in the acid rain
A bitter taste is in the air
I hear the danger of the tightening chains

Heroes, heroes, heroes are not here to stay
They will all fade away
Except the one who raised

I crawled through the ruins of old
Beneath its rubble lies a city of gold
My hands are chapped and bleeding cold
Returning all the riches that had been stolen

The people stand in the street and stare
The hangman releases his chilling cry
The heavens split to see the earth
The serpent is wrenching his silence sigh

Heroes, heroes, heroes are not here to stay
They will all fade away
Except the one who raised

Heroes, heroes, heroes are not here to stay
They will all fade away
Except the one who raised

Heroes
