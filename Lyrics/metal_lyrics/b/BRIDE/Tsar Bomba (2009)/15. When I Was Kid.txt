I collect baseball cards
Write short stories all day
All day
I play my guitar
Until my dying day
Yes, I play
I play army in the backyard
No one is harmed today
Been in prison since the day I was born
A slave to the flesh today
I escaped without the drugs
Escaped into my own mind
I escaped without the drugs
I have nightmares most every night
The same old dream today
No one comes to deliver me
But I pray
Yes I pray
Wish I could remember more
But my memory it fades
I see my brother go past
On a motor bike today
Here I sit, in this life
Nothing has changed
In this life no one that
I love gets killed
Everyone has hot wheels
I grew up over night
God watches over me
I put away
My childish ways
Now I'm free
Yes I'm free
