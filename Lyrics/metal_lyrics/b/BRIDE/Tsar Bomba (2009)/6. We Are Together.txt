Many years ago I saw a great light
Everything that was wrong suddenly became right
I learned the mysteries of the whole universe
But I can't share them now cause things will get worse
I might say and do unexplainable things
I might be real or I could be a dream
But mark my word they will come true
Don't hold back just do what I do
We are together you and I
So don't fight me or excite me
Or wish to die
I have seen the world from a million miles away
Through the eyes of God so don't be dismayed
Euphoric glimpse's of eternal bliss
Don't turn your head this is something you don't want to miss
I know what's in the heart of every person that I see
Their fears and desires were put there by me
One day you'll see me and I'll be gone
Count this as an invitation to come along
