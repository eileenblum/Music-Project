I was fragile and was hungry
He gave me His life for my soul
He gave me His time
Because I was preoccupied
He understands all my weakness
His nature was divine flesh
He placed value upon my heart
Promised a good measure of perfect holiness
GRACE â I want to hold you
GRACE â I want to know you
Forgive my sins from my dry throat
He never abandoned hope
Press your letter against my lips
Of the eternal love shine
Save me and I will be saved
His revolution is clear
He made His love too hard to resist
Change this sinner with love and not fear
