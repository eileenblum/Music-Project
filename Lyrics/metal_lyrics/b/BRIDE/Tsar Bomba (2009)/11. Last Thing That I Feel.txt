Let love be the last thing I feel
I stole the colors from the rainbow
I took the shine from the sun
I captured the rain from the sky
And brought a flower from my mind
If you are real to me
Show yourself to me
Let love be the last thing I feel
Let love be the last thing I feel
I waited for the most perfect day
Before the stars lit the night
I gave the moon to you in my hand
And wiped the tears from your face
I was lost in the traverse sound
The world of glitter and shine
I won't tell you just how it feels
When we're run out of time
