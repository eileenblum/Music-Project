By the blood from the fire
Tasted death lifts them higher
Nothing stronger than I know
The Father Son and Holy Ghost
Gentle Savior close your eyes
The Light will never die
Revolution from His side
Every soul is made alive
No more secrets, mysteries
And there is no more doubt
Christ the King, the Prophet and Priest
He has become all things despite of me
Had a price upon His head
Fanatics and zealots wanted Him dead
Free gift came upon all men
Nothing left to figure out
In the beginning there was a garden
It's all creation in the mind of man
And there was knowledge abundant life
God of the Ages divine plan
As the stars shine in the night sky
Like the promise of just One Seed
Resurrection at the first Light
Is a person brought out in me
