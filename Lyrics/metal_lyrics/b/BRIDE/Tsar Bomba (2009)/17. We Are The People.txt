We are the people

My God is a God of war and peace
We battle the lies spreading of the disease
My life is a sacrifice that's why I see
You are either for or against me
I am the saint that broke the curse
I am the monk of a thousand births
We are the people

I am a man of complexities
I pray that you see the Christ inside of me
I am the storm clouds full of rain
Heaven will open and you can't contain
Fireball coming right out of the sky
See the glow light in my eyes
You swear that we're all going to die
I say Hallelujah I'll take that ride
