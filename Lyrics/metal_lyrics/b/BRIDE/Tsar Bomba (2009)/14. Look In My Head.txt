We all want more than what we have
Living life by snatch and grab
What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine
We're going to fast to read the signs
Look in my Head
When you see me burning
Look in my Head
Keep a beat
Look in my Head
Just a heavy groovin'
Look in my Head
To the mercy seat
Falling headlong at the speed of sound
Smoke and flames rolling from the ground
We are the lightening flash across the sky
Shinning bright until we fade and die
I see you are living
In the house of pain
Do you love
Or do you still refrain?
I am the angel
Darkness I ride
Hell ain't so bad with
God by your side
