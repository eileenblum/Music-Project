Underground is where I live
Feel mother earth against my skin
I would crawl through her and veins never pretend
My face would be so pale
Never chapped by the wind
I can't cry anymore
I can't cry anymore
Nothing means anything to me
Nothing means anything to me
I would send roses to all my friends
They will ask how much did you spend?
Someone will ask what will God do next?
Maybe another world a little less complex
In this world you can loose faith
But you're just guessing at what awaits
Better put your faith in God and just believe
Or you will be eating dirt just like me
