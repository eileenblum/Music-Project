It's never dark enough
Somehow there's always light
It's never deep enough
Somehow there's always sight
Where can I go where the voices fade?
In the deepest hell
It won't go away
Drowning in my tears,
There is always hope
Falling endlessly down
I... I have no more sins to confess
It's my regret.
Don't... don't lift me up
Don't cry for me
Don't say a prayer
It's never covered enough
Somehow it can be seen
It's never far enough
Somehow it's always keen
It's never cold enough
The sun it always shines
It's never lonely enough
The thought is so sublime
