Feel like suicide, salt to the wounds of pain 
Pray for a miracle while you're going insane 
Carved like a lover's decadent stare 
Keep going back to the temptation in the air 
Feel like murder murder murder 
Feel like murder everywhere 
Feel like murder 
Wash away His touch, enemy inside 
The Lord will come to her, find the reason to justify 
Virtue is swollen, the night is spent and done 
She's so sure of herself she'll stare into the sun 
Feel like murder murder murder 
Feel like murder everywhere 
Feel like murder 
Wake up in the morning take a deep breath 
There's no smell of roses, just the scent of death 
Life's intoxicating like street confetti red 
Can't start believing with those voices in your head 
Feel like murder murder murder 
Feel like murder everywhere 
Feel like murder
