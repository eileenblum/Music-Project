Dad I love you, Mom I love you so much 
Please don't go, I know you miss me so much 
I want you so much Jesus cares about us 
Dad I love you, Mom I love you so much 
I know you want to be with me 
Dad she's coming back to me 
Mamma was gone, she said she's coming back 
I never stopped being me, I love you Dad so much 
Dad I love you, Mom I love you so much 
You're the only one for me, I love you wherever you go 
Happy Father's Day Dad, are you all fine 
I know you want to be with me 
Dad she's coming back to me 
Mamma was gone, she said she's coming back 
I want to save you in my mind 
Dad I want you to be in my mind forever 
I love you the way you love me 
I want to be with you, be with me forever 
I know you wnat to be with me 
Dad she's coming back to me 
Mamma was gone, she said she's coming back 
Dad I love you, Mom I love you so much
