What if I'm right and you are wrong 
If I have eternity and you don't have long 
What if there is a heaven and a place called hell 
What if my foolishness was really wisdom to your ears 
And all of my preachin' could draw the spirit so near 
What if there is a heaven and a place called hell 
What if you could see water turn to wine 
Would you say a miracle or call it a crime 
What if there is a heaven and a place called hell 
What if you see Jesus on judgement day 
Do you think you'll get a second chance 
What do you think the King will say 
What if there is a place called heaven and a place called hell
