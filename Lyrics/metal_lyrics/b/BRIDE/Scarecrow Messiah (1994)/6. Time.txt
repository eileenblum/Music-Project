Got a raindrop of the tip of my tongue 
If I get all I want I'll have to give you some 
I'm the beggar, the thorn in the brow 
I'm the cross you force and twist into the ground 
Butter so stiff that it wounds my bread 
Got a dew drop omelette on a trash can lid 
Ain't got no loafers to warm my feet 
Funny papers stimulate comic strip heat 
Crack vial breaking like a shotgun blast 
How long can the sounds of a cat fight last 
Howling at the moon for friends who have passed 
On sunday we'll fly black flags from the mast 
I've been hurting deep in my soul 
Does anybody have the time Holy Ghost 
Diesel is the smell of a mississippi grill 
Played trombone once for a delta dollar bill 
Pull the snow around me snug like a blanket of wool 
If I lie here to freeze to death I'd be another fox hole fool 
I got nothing new it's used, borrowed, and spent 
Good friday, ash wednesday, and a pocket full of lent 
Living in a box of cardboard and grit 
Made a window, made a sign, wouldn't mind working a little bit 
I've been hurting deep in my soul 
Does anybody have the time Holy Ghost 
I can't sleep, I can't think 
Life has pured me a glass that I can't drink 
The rim is jagged like a razor's blade 
And has left a scar that will never fade 
My thoughts are daggers on every nerve 
Life is a slow song with dirty words 
When I get to heaven will I wear a mask 
That is a question I must ask 
I've been hurting deep in my soul 
Does anybody have the time Holy Ghost
