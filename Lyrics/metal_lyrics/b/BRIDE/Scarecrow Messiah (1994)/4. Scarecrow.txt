Jesus, much like the scarecrow, is there for protection. the world views Jesus as hollow and lifeless; however, He is the Light of the world for all who have the courage to believe. Jesus on the cross weathered the storm of all mankind's sins. He stood alone as a gift of love to the world. 
There You stand, arms out wide 
Like forbidden fruit to the squinting eye 
Gather us together under your almighty wings 
Bruise the head and see what tomorrow brings 
Scarecrow all alone 
Scarecrow bring your children home 
Hand to the plow, forgiving multitudes 
Give them compassion, why are they afraid of You 
Proud at the altar, vain before the throne 
If You are blameless then throw the stone 
Scarecrow all alone 
Scarecrow bring your children home 
Betrayed by a friend, hung out to dry 
Alone in the end, stretched across the sky 
Eclipse the sun, they know not what they do 
They say if God is love why would He be so cruel 
Scarecrow all alone 
Scarecrow bring your children home 
Scarecrow all alone 
Scarecrow bring your children home
