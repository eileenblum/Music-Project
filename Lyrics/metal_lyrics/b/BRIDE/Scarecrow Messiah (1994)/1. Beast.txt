The devil's head is along the highway 
He's electric got nothing to say 
Not an easy road in the heat of the day 
I'm sick and tired of the tolls I've got to pay 
Do you fill my head with lies 
I'm sleeping uneasy tonight 
My body's broken and I'm shaking inside 
You're a little beast 
Pearls before the swine love is a higher law 
The purple sky brings out those hungry dogs 
Sonny boy williamson can you tell me what went wrong 
Can I have your shoulder to lean on 
Do you fill my head with lies 
I'm sleeping uneasy tonight 
My body's broken and I'm shaking inside 
You're a little beast 
When a child is unwanted they say justice falls 
Let's go into the poor neighborhoods and machine gun them all 
Salvation is a dove and branch the rainbow crucified 
Chill the messiah who is your Jesus Christ 
Do you fill my head with lies 
I'm slleping uneasy tonight 
My body's broken and I'm shaking inside 
You're a little beast
