I can't bear the rooster's crow 
I guess that's something that you already know 
Remember the darkness bless the light 
Lest I fall into the night 
Like a saint I walk on water, turn the water into wine 
Turn the other cheek, give my eyes to the blind 
You might think I'm crazy, crazy like a fox 
I got something, something called fire 
I got something take my spirit higher 
Stopped wearing black and tired of looking thin 
I got a big fat spirit walking born again 
I got to get so humble going to wash your feet 
Got to feed the beggar down on poor man's street 
Like a saint I walk on water, turn the water into wine 
Turn the other cheek, give my eyes to the blind 
You might think I'm crazy, crazy like a fox 
I got something something called fire 
I got something take my spirit higher
