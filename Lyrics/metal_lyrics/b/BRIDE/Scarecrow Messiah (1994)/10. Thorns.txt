She lost her love 
Tore the picture of the one that she thought of 
She's alone again 
But it's worse than it's ever ever been 
She hurts so bad down and out 
She feels the pain of a broken heart 
She hurts so bad she feels the pain of a broken heart 
The black rain falls the river runs red 
Like a crown of thorns to her pretty little head 
The black rain falls the riiver runs red 
Like a crown of thorns to her pretty little head 
She holds the cross 
In her hand but she feels so cold and lost 
Take a look inside 
Nowhere to run no place to hide 
She hurts so bad down and out 
She feels the pain of a broken heart 
She hurts so bad she feels the pain of a broken heart 
The black rain falls the river runs red 
Like a crown of thorns to her pretty little head 
The black rain falls the riiver runs red 
Like a crown of thorns to her pretty little head 
She never told a lie 
Put her faith in love never compromised 
She had a heavy gun 
But she tied her strings she never came undone 
She hurts so bad down and out 
She feels the pain of a broken heart 
She hurts so bad she feels the pain of a broken heart 
She hurts so bad down and out 
She feels the pain of a broken heart 
She hurts so bad she feels the pain of a broken heart 
The black rain falls the river runs red 
Like a crown of thorns to her pretty little head 
The blck rain falls the river runs red 
Like a crown of thorns through her pretty little head
