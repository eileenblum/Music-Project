If plowshares could speak and if the lost would speak 
They would find themselves together 
When the new world comes the face of the sun 
New wine for all the pain 
I know you will catch me when I cannot see 
I've walked in these shoes up to my knees 
I've birthed a mountain that's hard to climb 
Weary and well doing I will make time 
I'm the one 
I am the one 
That is what I've become 
I'm the one 
I am the one 
Don't let your good be spoken evil of 
I'm the one 
I am the one 
That is what I've become 
I'm the one 
I am the one 
Don't let your good be spoken evil of 
Heart and mustard seed faith is to believe 
I dig in the dirt, my hands bleed 
If answers is why we pray 
Then let us bow our heads today 
I'm the one 
I am the one 
That is what I've become 
I'm the one 
I am the one 
Don't let your good be spoken evil of 
I'm the one 
I am the one 
That is what I've become 
I'm the one 
I am the one 
Don't let your good be spoken evil of
