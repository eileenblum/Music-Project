Is it heavy 
Is it white 
Can I stab it with a knife 
Will it bite 
Will it scratch 
Can I strike it with a match 
Can I shut it 
Can I lock it 
Can I fit it in my pocket 
Can I move it 
Can I love it 
Can I hold it 
Can I shove it 
Is it round 
Is it wide 
Will it know it if I lie 
Will it bounce 
Will it roll 
Do I have to pay a toll 
Will it fit through a door 
Can I sit it on the floor 
Can it run 
Can it fly 
Will it swim 
Will it try 
Will it hurt 
Will it burn 
Is it none of my concern 
Can I buy it 
Can I sell it 
Can I trade it 
Can I kill it 
Will it know if I am gone 
Will it sneeze 
Will it yawn 
Is it short 
Is it tall 
Will it look good on a wall 
Can I teach it 
Will it learn 
Is it stable 
Will it turn 
Can I crash it 
Can I smash it 
Can I beat it into ashes 
Will it growl 
Will it howl 
Can I lay it in a pile 
Can it think - tell the time 
Is it psychic - read my mind 
Will it tickle 
Can it laugh 
Can I cut it into half 
Will it die 
Will it mold 
Can I leave it in the cold 

Is it borrowed 
Is it stolen 
Is it bruised 
Is it swollen 
Is it nasty 
Is it gross 
Can I eat it with my toast 
Is it hot like a coal 
Does it have a soul 
Can it tell if I am lying 
Does it know the world is dying 
Does it think - have a conscience 
Does it know that time's upon us 
Does it read - understand 
Can I hold it in my hand 
Will it run if it's mad 
Does it have a mom and dad 
Can I drive it 
Can I fly it 
Who will know if I try it 
Is it loud just like thunder 
Does it look like any other 
Does it know it is forgiven 
Can it tell if I have sinned
