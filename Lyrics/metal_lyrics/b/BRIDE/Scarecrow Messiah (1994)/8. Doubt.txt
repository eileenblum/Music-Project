I have broken many promises, thrown caution to the wind 
Rebelled in my youth but here You come again 
You are the meesage in the bottle, the light that never dims 
And though I let you down You'll always be my frind 
I will never forget, I will have no regrets 
Don't want to cheat anyone 
Don't wnat to steal from anyone 
Don't want to lie 
Don't want to quit 
Don't want to leave any doubt 
Put my faith in fairy tales, believed what I was told 
I've watched the holy eat their own, suck the meat and lick the bone 
There is only one voice my universal guide 
You've alway been beside me even when I wanted to die 
I will never forget, I will have no regrets 
Don't want to cheat anyone 
Don't wnat to steal from anyone 
Don't want to lie 
Don't want to quit 
Don't want to leave any doubt 
Don't want to step on anyone 
Don't want to hurt anyone 
Don't want to curse anyone 
Don't want to leave any doubt 
Sometimes I itch and squirm to crawl out of my skin 
You put your arm around me like the air that I take in 
Won't push no needle in my arm or bathe in gasoline 
Never swear in Jesus' name or hide behind the pain 
Don't want to cheat anyone 
Don't want to steal from anyone 
Don't want to step on anyone 
Don't want to hurt anyone 
Don't wnat to curse anyone 
Don't want to leave any doubt
