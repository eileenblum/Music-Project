Cradle me in your wooden arms 
Twist your flowers around my head 
I cried all the tears I could 
While you slept I bled 
I turn to you 
But you never knew me 
I forgive you for the things that you do to me 

Press my body until it splinters 
Pull my flesh apart 
When I break into 
Wet your lips with my heart 

I turn to you 
But you never knew me 
I forgive you for the things that you do to me 

Weight my bones down 
Lay your soul upon me 
With your suffocation 
And hands that are clean 

Lead me by the hand 
Like a lamb before the slaughter 
Nail my body to the southern wind 
I am your willing martyr 

I turn to you 
But you never knew me 
I forgive you for the things that you do to me 

Weight my bones down 
Lay your soul upon me 
With your suffocation 
And hands that are clean
