One slot machine, one stop light town 
And if Jesus came back tonight 
To every story there are two sides 
If you walk with the devil he'll tell you a lie 
Rolls Royce coming through the air 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
I hope that I will see you there 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
Hit the ground running on the streets of gold 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
Gotta make times for the presidents soul 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
Never believed in the music 
The way I believe in you 

One slot machine one stop light town 
And if Jesus came back tonight 
To every story there are two sides 
If you walk with the devil he'll tell you a lie 

Never been a lover always been a fighter 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
Fought all my life trying to find love 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
Love of may shall wax cold 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
What I do I do alone 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
Never believed in the music 
The way I believe in you 

Desires and fears, my doubts and tears 
My joys my loves, to him above 
My anguish and my lust the skeletons I dust 

One slot machine one stop light town 
And if Jesus came back tonight 
To every story there are two sides 
If you walk with the devil he'll tell you a lie 

Never believed in the music 
The way I believe in you 

Walked through the valley of dry bones 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
I was brushed by the shadow of the holy ghost 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
I've greased leprosy through my hair 
(I'm nobodies hero) 
And felt the rushing mighty wind 
(I'm nobodies hero) 

Never belived in the music 
The way I believe in you
