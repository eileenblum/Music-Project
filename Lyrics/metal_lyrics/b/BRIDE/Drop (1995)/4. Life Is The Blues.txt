There's a baby crying, a newborn who won't be content 
When he becomes a man he'll wonder where his childhood went 
He'll feel the pain of life, choke his last breath 
Life is no bed of roses, these things he will confess 
Life is the blues 
Nothing we can do 
Life is the blues 
Nothing more to loose 

The last time he saw his wife, she was marching out to sea 
He was cruel and crazy, she was beautiful she's been set free 
Lines on her face, the pain of reality 
He broke her heart, then left her alone to be 

Life is the blues 
Nothing we can do 
Life is the blues 
Nothing more to loose 

All this guilt he holds within, he let her slip away 
It's too late to say those things she needed to hear him say 
He never said I love you, I want you to stay 
He'd give his soul to relive that day 
He heard his son singing 

Life is the blues 
Nothing we can do 
Life is the blues 
Nothing mor to loose
