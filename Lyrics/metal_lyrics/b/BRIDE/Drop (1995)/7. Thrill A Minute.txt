There's a peeping tom in the eye of god's house 
Shooting insulin as quiet as a church mouse 
Tried to clean his bones from a sulfer well 
Turned his head couldn't stand the smell 
A thrill a minute 

Life size crucifix was stolen from the wall 
The organist played amazing grace for them all 
Hooker in a red skirt testified and repented 
While the deacons passed a snake, stared and squinted 

A thrill a minute 

Paper taxis full of eyes 
Chocolate pulpits racing by 
Floating boardwalks and candycanes 
Cashmere penguins with see through wings 

Someone had a spirit, ran up and down the aisle 
When the shouting stopped, the choir lay in a pile 
Bell ringer pulled the rope and was lifted off his feet 
Pastor disrobed, took the money to the street 

A thrill a minute
