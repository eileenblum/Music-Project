Skillet blonde baby gonna milk it dry 
Ain't got no horseshoes but got a sparkle in his eye 
Warm and cuddled in a burlap sac 
Step on the crack gonna break your mother's back 
Have you made it where you want to be 
Moon river 
Have you made it where you want to be 
Have you made it where you want to be 
Moon river 
Have you made it where you want to be 

Runt of the litter kissed the pavement ever since 
Told him to stand up straight but he's hooked and bent 
Feels like a sticky rim soda can 
Half full, half empty couldn't tell you where he's been 

Have you made it where you want to be 
Moon river 
Have you made it where you want to be 
Have you made it where you want to be 
Moon river 
Have you made it where you want to be 

Embracing the fog like a friend in the bay 
Charted a boat headed out to sea 
Found religion but did he find Jesus 
Walking on the water or lost in mystery 

Have you made it where you want to be 
Moon river 
Have you made it where you want to be 
Have you made it where you want to be 
Moon river 
Have you made it where you want to be
