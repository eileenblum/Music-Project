Hideaway hell, city of cardboard boxes 
Lost their hope, look what it has cost us 
Sleeping in the alleys, eating from the garbage cans 
At night there cold, they need a helping hand 
Hanging them for murder when they don't own a gun 
They're sentenced to die before the trial's begun 

Their hunger is deep, no money to their name 
Environment controls them, it only brings them pain 
Suffocated and lonely, painting the roses red 
If they knew what we had planted, we might just loose our heads 

Hanging them for murder when they don't own a gun 
They're sentenced to die before the trial's begun 

Let's show them, some compassion 
Let's show them, that we care 
Let's show them, some compassion 
Help them breath the air 

When people are divided, you know they cannot stand 
Let's stand and be united, and save this promised land 
The garbage is piled high, from without and within 
Land of milk and honey, this is where we begin 

Hanging them for murder when they don't own a gun 
They're sentenced to die before the trial's begun 

Let's show them, some compassion 
Let's show them, that we care 
Let's show them, some compassion 
Help them breathe the air
