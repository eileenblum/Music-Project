Give me a convertible and a girl in a white dress 
Jaster she says, I like that the best 
Radio playing all her favorite tunes 
Honey from my lips like sweet perfume 
I may be an outlaw, but no rope around my neck 
Shoot my way out, some lipstick and a stacked deck 
Riding in the dark, kissing in the rain 
Protect my reputation by changing my name 

I'm the devil, if you want to loose your freedom 
I'm the devil, if you have nothing to loose 
I'm the devil, if you want it all now 
I'm the devil, come here and take it 

A burning cigarette and an ashtray full of tears 
Through a cold bourbon glass 
She can see her worst fears 
I sit there burning, I'm the feverish lie 
You'll find no truth in my distant eyes 

If you can't go all the way then don't even start 
Cause when you take my hand 
You'll slide me your heart 
I'm the wild horse that can't be tamed 
Picture postcard that can't be framed 

I'm the devil, if you want to loose your freedom 
I'm the devil, if you have nothing to loose 
I'm the devil, if you want it all now 
I'm the devil, come here and take it 

Come and take my hand everybody can 
Come and take my hand everybody can 

Mothers hide your babies 
Teach your children what the good book says 
Righteous never forsaken 
Or their seed begging bread
