Jesus came back and found you 
At a card table in the back of a pawn shop 
Jesus came back and found you 
Sleeping by the river on those big old nasty rocks 
Jesus came back 
Jesus came back 
Jesus came back and he found you 
In love with someone with no name 
Jesus came back and he found you 
Swimming like a blind fish in mammoth cave 

Jesus came back 
Jesus came back 

Jesus came back jesus came back Jesus came back 
Jesus came back and he found you 
On your front porch waiting for the sun to go down 
Jesus came back and he found you 
All your money buried in stoney ground
