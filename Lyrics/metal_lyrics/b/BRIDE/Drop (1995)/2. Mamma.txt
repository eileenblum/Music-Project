Birds have their nests 
Foxes have their holes 
I have no place to lay my head 
Been forty days tempted by the devil 
Like a reed shaking in the wind 
Wheels of time are like caffeine 
To pass this cup from me 
Kneeling on the tears that drop like blood 
My face is the glow of destiny 

Mamma say a prayer for me 

I heard the devil speak like tongues 
As he left the throne of grace 
I felt the wisdom of the ages 
But he never showed his face 

He danced on the head of the cross 
Lost his footing and he fell 
Stole a kiss from Jesus 
Burned his lips snow white pale 

Mamma say a prayer for me
