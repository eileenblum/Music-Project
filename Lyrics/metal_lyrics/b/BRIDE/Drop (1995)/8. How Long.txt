Mary don't you cry kiss me now so I can die 
Alabaster laughing sigh, a sinner with holy eyes 
Wash my feet with her tears, choke and strangle sister fear 
Let down your pretty hair, touch the day annoint the year 
How long not long, reap what you sow 
How long not long, his truth is marching on 
How long not long, been to the mountain top 
How long not long, 'til Jesus calls me home 

You always have the poor, I prepare a place for you 
My cup runs over, rod and staff will comfort you 
Kill the shepherd the sheep will scatter, across the barren land 
The hour has now come, wash the silver from your hands 

How long not long, reap what you sow 
How long not long, his truth is marching on 
How long not long, been to the mountain top 
How long not long, 'til Jesus calls me home 

Liverpool is dead and the sounds that fill the air 
The president went to dallas and he never came out of there 
If Jesus Christ offends you, you wear x's in your eyes 
Bob Dylan never changed the world and I don't believe he ever tried 

How long not long, reap what you sow 
How long not long, his truth is marching on 
How long not long, been to the mountain top 
How long not long, 'til Jesus calls me home
