My mind works all the time is that why you're afraid of me 
Or is it my tattoos that you can't help but to see 
They say that I am complex don't believe everything I read 
And sometimes it is so hard to explain all that I have seen 
It only hurts when I laugh 

I don't smile for pictures, my success is overdone 
God watches over me,you know, I'm the fortunate one 
Give me wings of angels rise above self righteousness 
There's only so much of this ol' world that my soul can digest 

It only hurts when I laugh 

You can look a man dead in the eye 
See deep within his soul 
You can walk a mile in his shoes 
You'll never know all he knows 

My songs aren't always pretty cause the truth it sometimes hurts 
And even though it's painful you know all the words 
I've learned to shut the world out and to let the spirit in 
It's only when I'm honest that miracles begin 

It hurts when I laugh
