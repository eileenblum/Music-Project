Everybody needs, someone to lean on 
Everybody needs, to remember where they've been 
Everybody needs, somewhere to call heaven 
Everybody needs, something to believe in 
Everybody needs, a personal Savior 
Everybody needs, a hand from a friend 
Everybody needs, a personal Savior 
Everybody needs, freedom from their sin 

Everybody's going to feel hopeless and lost 
Everybody's going to blame and taste fear 
Everone hears a still small voice 
Everyone's going to shed a tear 

Everybody needs, a personal Savior 
Everybody needs, a hand from a friend 
Everybody needs, a personal Savior 
Everybody needs, freedom from their sin 

Everyone needs, to learn to break bread 
Everyone needs, faith not a sign 
Everyone needs, to carry their own cross 
Everyone needs, the blood bottled like wine 

Everybody needs, a personal Savior 
Everybody needs, a hand from a friend 
Everybody needs, a personal Savior 
Everybody needs, freedom from their sin
