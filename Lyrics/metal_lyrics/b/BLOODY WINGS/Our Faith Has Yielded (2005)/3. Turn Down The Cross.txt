Anytime the human soul
Or the earthly kingdom I observe
I feel so clearly in my heart
The voice of distrust
It seems to me the best truth
Not to hide in a wonderland
But embrace the grief we're through
And live at one with sadness

No signs of Heaven in little earth-time
No Jesus Christ to heal our pain
A narrow mind, afterdeath oblivion
Bleeding forever in the hell of life

Of what use it to build
Hope from nothing
Deceived ones will perish soon
Among their god
As the one in search for any peace
Meets the face of undying pain
He will see life as it is
A crazy wait, a tragedy.
