I cry this reign of ruin,
Where white man drew his end,

A world without us to bow!
A world without us to bow!

Is this our miserable conquest?
A bleak land of undying greed,
Exploited earth,
Human atrocity.

Where all faults arose?
We sink in our own terror.

Old heroes are dying,
It is the twilight of their wasted wealth.

Hail to the outcome of all white lies,
Hail to our kings,
Locked in their tombs.

All hope is lost,
Never will we restore our peace,
And we must fade out
As time, we know
can't stand still.
