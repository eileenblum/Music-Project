Stand still in this broken silence
Drowning into a murdered time

Hands, they already gave way
They surrended

(As) Heaven is deaf
And my body yields

As all my own is being taken away
Tears of flesh
Trickle over my sin

Wounded the night
Scars of cries and weeps
Severed my will from myself
...he is in

High flames within my body enslaved
Bite and scorn my naked flesh

End me
Leave me
Don't let me breathe
For every breath
Is a deeper grief
