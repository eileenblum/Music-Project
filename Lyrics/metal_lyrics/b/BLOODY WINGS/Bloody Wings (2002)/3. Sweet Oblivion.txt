Since everything is broken,
And all the dreams are faded,
And all the hopes are fallen,
What am I here for?

Decline.

It's always raining and storming,
Where has the warm sun gone?
Through blackened days I am crawling,
Straight toward my tomb.

Decline.

Still I walk the path of self-destruction,
Going straight towards Sweet Oblivion.
