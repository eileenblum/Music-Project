In my very youth you glanced at me,
Showing me your saviour hand,
Whispering your deadly plan,
No more cries nor lament.

You were so charming, holed in darkness,
A blond haired angel you did seemed,
It took no long to me to see,
Not so guilty was your sin.

Never before this time,
I felt so close Suicide,
For every things nearby,
Whisper silenty,
You shall die!

Time did passed but there you are,
Into your mask so oft I hide,
Alone at night, you're in my sight,
My beautiful friend Suicide.
