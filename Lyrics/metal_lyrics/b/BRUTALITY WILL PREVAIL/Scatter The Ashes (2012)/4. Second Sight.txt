I'm in a dark place thats always changing
I can't make my mind up who is right and who is wrong

I've been told so many stories
But never witnessed the truth
I can't explain what was there before
Seen what I'm seeing once again
Not even a sweet dream
Can't explain this nightmare

I know I'll reach another life darker than mine
Another chance, living another life

Scatter my ashes
Let the Devil do his work
