Spend my time looking in the mirror
This old man will never change
Reflection is dragging me down
Pinch my skin. Is this a reality?
I'm driving the good into bad
The hunger for hate is getting bigger day by day
I spend my time looking in the mirror
This old man will never change

Everything I touch turns to dust
The surrounding that I have steps aside
I've opened the wrong door, there is no escape
The path is leading me to dig my own grave

Same mistake over and over again
Same old cycle I think it's catching me up this time
I'll never learn

Piece by piece, everything is falling apart
Every face is slowly drifting away
When I'm left with nothing
Nothing but myself
I think I realise what it is like to be dead
