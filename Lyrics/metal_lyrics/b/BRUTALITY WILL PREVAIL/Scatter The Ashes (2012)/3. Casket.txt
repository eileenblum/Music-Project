Digging my own grave
I'm a slave for this dayly life
The cycle of seasons are passing me by
Day by day I'm loosing my mind

Digging my own grave
I'm a slave for this dayly life
The cycle of seasons are passing me by
Day by day I'm loosing my mind

I'm on a loosing streak
With no clear path in sight
I'm on a loosing streak
With no clear path in sight

The struggle is wearing me thin
The cracks are beggining to show
Release my mind body and soul
I want to be the one who's in control
