Broken all the ties
Commitments that bound your life
Torn up and thrown away
Your promise is left to lay
Too quick to preach
Words of wisdom didn't get you far
Left with the price to pay
Never forgive, never forget
I've wanted all this time
For you to fall out of line

Broken all the ties
Commitments that bound your life
Torn up and thrown away
Your promise is left to lay
Too quick to preach
Words of wisdom didn't get you far
Left with the price to pay
Never forgive, never forget

The oath is broken
The sins have been committed
