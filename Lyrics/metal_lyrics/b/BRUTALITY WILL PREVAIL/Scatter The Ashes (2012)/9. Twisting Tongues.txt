Twisting tongues expand his lungs
To pollute the air that we breathe
Playing mind games
I try and make me fail in what I believe

Turn your back knife attack
He slits your throat once again
Too quick to point the finger
Open your eyes and realize the truth

You've been living off my name for far too long
You'll never be the man I am

Living in my shadows
Beg for my mercy
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
Nothing but obey
