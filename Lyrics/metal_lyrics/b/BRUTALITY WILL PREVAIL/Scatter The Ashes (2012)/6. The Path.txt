Suffer the path of life
I'm held down to this endless fight
Times are hard, it's only getting harder
Tried and tried, I can't break out
At the back of my mind
I can feel my head explode
Everyday I live a life of Hell
My world is spinning, out of control
Feel the weight of the world crushing my soul

So take my hand and walk with me
I'll take you to a life of reality
Open your eyes and take a look at what's inside
A life of pain and misery

A broken man is what I've become
