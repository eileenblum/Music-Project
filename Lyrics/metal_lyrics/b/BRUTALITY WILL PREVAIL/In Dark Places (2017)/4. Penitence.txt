When you look in the abyss
It stares back at you
Rock bottom, feeling low
Brought down and lost in the undertow
Rock bottom, feeling low
A man of constant sorrow
Forever pushed close to the edge
Searching for a reckoning
All the time in the world
Can't heal his pain
All he held close have left him to his fate
Forced under
Lungs collapse, no room to breathe
A sinking feeling
Of going down to the cold dark depths
Rock bottom, feeling low
Wasting away, trying to let go
Rock bottom, filled with regret
A man of constant sorrow
Searching for penitence
Fallen to his knees
A sickness of the mind
All his time is spent
His world is broken
Low
