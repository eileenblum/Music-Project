You forced belief through you lies
But I've always seen the snake in your eyes
Hellmouth, lie in torment
With nowhere to hide
Sinking lower and lower
Afraid to lose control
Biting the hand that feeds
I've seen the venom spit right from your lips
Where serpents lie
Past the gates of damnation
Hellmouth, lie in torment
With nowhere to hide
Closer and closer, into the darkness
No sacrifice can save you
Dig yourself deeper
You're going nowhere
Sink into the pit
