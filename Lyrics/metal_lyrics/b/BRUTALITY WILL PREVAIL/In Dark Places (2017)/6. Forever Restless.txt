The reaper walks by my side
While I feel barely alive
Laughing at my every step
Answers keep slipping away
And I keep lying awake
With every step my sanity strains
Old crow
Losing faith in myself
Carry me to the other side
And lay my soul to rest
Sink your claws into me
'Til I can hardly breathe
I have nothing left to fear
I know my time is coming
I don't need hope to hold my own
Can't feel at peace with myself or anyone else
I'll spend the rest of my life forever restless
Every waking moment, every sleepless night
I find myself forever restless
Come take my soul
And leave my body cold
