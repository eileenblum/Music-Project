Am I a prisoner
To all these doubts
That whisper
Telling me to hide
From the outside world
Draining me
Craving solitude
I know my time has come
I don't need faith to save my soul
I'll live a life, a life of no rest
I know my time has come
I don't need faith to save my soul
I'll live a life, a life of no peace
'Til I have nothing to fight for
