I hear you calling my name
I feel the life drain from my veins
Vice grip holding me down
There's nothing I can change
Empty, feeling so empty
Trying to follow the light
Broken, feeling so broken
Choke grip holding me tight
I'm breaking down through constant strain
Do what I can to live another day
A constant battle with consequence
I know I can't live my life this way
I hear you calling my name
I feel the life drain from my veins
Vice grip holding me down
There's nothing I can change
Falling, always falling towards a shallow grave
Losing, losing my mind
All things we know will change
'Til my body is weak, and my hair turns to grey
And my skin is worn, and withered away
