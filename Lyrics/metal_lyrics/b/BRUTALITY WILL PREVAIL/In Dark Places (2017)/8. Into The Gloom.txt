Chase the lines to the end
And find yourself amongst the fools
Keep hiding in the blurry nights
Where nothing there is real
You are the ghost you've been searching for
You are the ghost I don't see anymore
Misguided illusions
Make you feel alive again
At least that's what they'll lead you to believe
The sheep will turn heir backs
As the wolves offer them their fate
You are the ghost you've been searching for
You are the ghost I don't see anymore
