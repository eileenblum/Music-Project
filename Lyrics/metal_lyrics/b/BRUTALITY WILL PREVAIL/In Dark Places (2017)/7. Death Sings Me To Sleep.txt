I don't wish my life was easy
I have nothing to call my own
I'll take control, find it within me
Misery I call my home
I spend every day trying to be a better man
As the world tries, it tries to drag me down
I fear no evil, won't be denied
As time goes by closer to the end
I feel the pain as it flows through me
The time has come to find another way
(Misery) The time has come
Don't waste your tears on me
Can't let my thoughts weigh me down
Before I crumble back into the ground
I won't run, I won't hide and I won't be condemned
Misery I call my home
Death sings me to sleep
