Look into my eyes
I can see what you want me to be
It's a mirror reflection of how you want me to be
Please unlock the shackles that bound my life
Give me the room to breathe
Time alone is what I need
No escape from this life I don't want to live
Each day I play a game I never win
I can feel the walls closing in
I can feel my chances running thin
