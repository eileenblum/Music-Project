I can see straight through you
By the look in your eyes
What I see is unclear, a cold soul deep inside
Time to face reality and open up your life
Seeing you fade away kills me deep inside
You played me at, my own game
Now I feel, feel the pain
What we need in our life
To save us from this fight
The love that we first shared
I know itâs there to find
Murder
