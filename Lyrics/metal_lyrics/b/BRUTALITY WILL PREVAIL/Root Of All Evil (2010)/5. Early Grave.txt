Alone in the wilderness, no hand to guide me out
Taken steps in the wrong direction, leading me to an early grave
Cannot keep my head above the water, this way of life is pulling me under
My cold heart is starting to wonder, will my time always be this way ?
I see no light at the end of the tunnel, thereâs no cloud with a silver lining
All I see is time moving faster, than the miles that we travelled
I feel my time is up, Iâve got nowhere to hide
Iâll sit alone in the darkness, waiting on my time to shine
Iâll sit alone in the darkness, frightened for my own life
Save your cry, my end is in sight, happiness is a lie
