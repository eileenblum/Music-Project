Under so much pain, trying to break these chains
Why are we still trying, hoping, crying
Looking for the joy that we shared ?
Searching for the memorys that we made
I can see in your eyes, straight passed the lies
lies, lies, lies
This devil Iâve created, a clear vision of myself
It frightens me, more than life
It frightens me more than death
Life, life take me away
Take me to a place
Life, life take me away
Take me to a place, I can die
To a place I can die
Fuck
