A pack of wolves feed upon the flesh
Of the kids that were put on the test
For those who choose to feed on other's tales
Will be taken away and hung with the rest
Now it's time to make up your mind
There's no escaping the grave you're laying in
Layed out on the line
With your life hung out to dry
Armed with guilt, the narrow path just begun
You are the disease with no cure
The root of all evil to haunt us all
Take what you wish in the eyes of death
I'll take the world
Until my soul is layed to rest
Secrets of the truth
