Black hidden presence
Waves his hand
Strides the earth for infamy
Talons strain
Devouring the feeble
Dog god litany
Earth shall crumble
Amidst the ashes he will rise
Cursing of the holy ghost
Mankind choking on its own demise

Cold grasp around the heart
Claws writhing in the flesh
Rites of supremacy
Consume the weal and quench their souls

Come red death
Swirl the sky
Bring forth the rain of fevers
Fevers/fevers
Sickening is the dogma rushing through your veins
Buried believers

The ever rotting presence of him
The rotten sculpture of the one that is bound to rise
Conjure now this dark upheaval
The pestilence that is bound to come and cleanse the earth

Cold grasp around the heart
Claws writhing in the flesh
Rites of supremacy
Consume the weal and quench their souls

The ever rotting presence of him
The rotten sculpture of the one that is bound to rise
Conjure now this dark upheaval
The pestilence that is bound to come and cleanse the earth

Cold grasp around the heart
Claws writhing in the flesh
Rites of supremacy
Consume the weal and quench their souls
