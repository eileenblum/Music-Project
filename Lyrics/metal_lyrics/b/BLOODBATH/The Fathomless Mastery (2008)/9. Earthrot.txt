A stream from the virgin wounds
Sunken into the moors
The bones of past ancestors
Infesting forgotten mass graves

The bloodletting of Christianity
An ancient whisper from the past
Buried in the soil like secret folklore
Eating away on the roots of mankind

Human earthrot
Earthrot

The martyr's celebration
The blood sunken deep into the earth
Futile pipedream
Twisted beliefs
Confirming the parasite features of mankind

The bloodletting of Christianity
An ancient whisper from the past
Buried in the soil like secret folklore
Eating away on the roots of mankind

Human earthrot

We are all lying
We are all dying
Earthrot
Apocalyptic nightmare
Majestic unstoppable conspiracy

The weak reaching for the gun
Infect the earth once more
Pulsating against the core
Nuclear winter in its wake

Hu-man earth-rot
