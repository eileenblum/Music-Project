Baptized in vermin
Gagging on leeches twisting in your throat
Swallow the parasite
Alive in the liquid that is flushing through your viscera
Mind disintegrates
Replacing the blood with virus and insects
Revel in this death
Letting something in that will not be exorcised

Human guinea pig
Image of despair
Bastard waiting
Suffering upon the cross of surgery

Red drift from the eyes
So dark the panic
So rotting this demise
Inhale your own impending death
Breath in
Disgorge
Maggots crawl in your last breath

Surgical carnage
Chunks of your own flesh are forced into your mouth
Removing the face
Wretched human mirror
Incarnation of disgrace
Ice cold eyes
Long since emptied of hope and faith
Staring dead into the void
Internal ultra-violence
Body and mind destroyed

Human guinea pig
Image of despair
Bastard waiting
Suffering upon the cross of surgery

Red drift from the eyes
So dark the panic
So rotting this demise
Inhale your own impending death
Breath in
Disgorge
Maggots crawl in your last breath
