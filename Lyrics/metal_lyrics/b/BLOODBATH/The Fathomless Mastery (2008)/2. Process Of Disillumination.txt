The god before all gods must rule again

Internal winter rise
If you cross our path in this nation of death
Repent and wait for slaughter
Insanity comes
Race through my soul

Humanity recoil
Suffer backwards through ages
Die

I am above the sun
I see the rightful fall behind the gates of heaven
And god is cast down
Suffering
Crowned in the spit of retaliation

Prince of darkness rise
Claim what's been yours through the ages of sleep
Drenched in your scorn
Insanity comes
Antichrist is born

I am above the sun
I see the rightful fall behind the gates of heaven
And god is cast down
Suffering
Crowned in the spit of retaliation
