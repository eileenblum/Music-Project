Falling into obscure demise
Ripping death confronts their eyes
Born as a freak in decrepit birth
Ignorance prevails, buried in earth

I seem contorted, a victim of death
Corrupt reality, a poisoned breath
From beyond the grave, a sight of gore
Rise from the crypts, life no more

Rancid corpse, afterlife bliss
Greeting the night with a vulgar hiss
Pulsating innards for me to bless
Drowning in bile, enjoying the mess

Aiming at your face
Using piss for mace
You like the taste
Painting the wall with the blood of a slut
Agonizing scrotum beginning to rot
Eyes full of blood dripping like a flood
Rotting as I walk,
the silhouette of a zombie dark
Don't turn around 'cause it's you I stalk

I see death evocation
I see undead dispair
I see decapitation
In the wake of pain, breeding death

Embraced by doom
The dead mans gloom
Life is no more
My soul existence in gore
Guardian of my grave
Come near, be brave
Your spine I will rip
In rapture licking my lips

Undertaker, fake servant of God
Followers paying tribute to God Dog
Fucking fools, doesn't matter that you pray
You will die 'cause it's you that I will slay
Time to meet thy maker
Fingers tighten round your neck
But my eyes are open wide
Evil and wicked way
You believe that I'm just
another fucking wreck
You lay mutilated corpse
I disappear through the haze
