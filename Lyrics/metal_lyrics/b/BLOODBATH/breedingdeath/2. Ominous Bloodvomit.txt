Stomach slashed open, he wields his blade
Obsessed with flesh from evil he was made
In my own blood soon my killer will wade
Puts glass into my mouth, a diet grim
Fills me up with pain above the brim

[Chorus:]
Vomit of blood, ominous sign
Puts my health on a steady decline
Terrifying scum, bastard of the earth
Life turns into torture amid its darkened mirth

Flooding blood from every hole
Carving out the remains of my soul
Steaming out my eyes, what a terrible deed
The more I pray for mercy the more I bleed

Sacrificed to the freak
Still alive but so weak
His obsession will put me to death
And he smiles when I take my last breath
His obsession will put me to death
And he smiles when I take my last breath

Obsessed with flesh, from evil he was made
In my own blood soon my killer will wade
Puts glass into my mouth, a diet grim
Fills me up with pain above the brim

[Chorus:]
Vomit of blood, ominous sign
Puts my health on a steady decline
Terrifying scum, bastard of the earth
Life turns into torture amid its darkened mirth

Vomit of blood, ominous sign
Puts my health on a steady decline
Terrifying scum, bastard of the earth
Life turns into torture amid its darkened mirth

Zombiefication through torture
Terror, blood, guts and gore
Living dead, life in death
I scream but I only want more

Zombiefication through torture
Terror, blood, guts and gore
Living dead, life in death
I scream but I only want more

[Chorus:]
Vomit of blood, ominous sign
Puts my health on a steady decline
Terrifying scum, bastard of the earth
Life turns into torture amid its darkened mirth

Vomit of blood, ominous sign
Puts my health on a steady decline
Terrifying scum, bastard of the earth
Life turns into torture amid its darkened mirth

Vomit of blood, ominous sign
Puts my health on a steady decline
Terrifying scum, bastard of the earth
Life turns into torture amid its darkened mirth
