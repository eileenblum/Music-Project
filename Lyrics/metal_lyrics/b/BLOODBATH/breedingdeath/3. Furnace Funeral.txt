Wake up in a sweat
Blood in my mouth
Fainted by the torture, had no time to shout
A gathering of freaks, and evil plot, a feast
Trapped in the furnace, sacrificial to the beast

Temperature's increased, searing my skin
I start to realize I'm the last of my kin
Acrid devastation in the furnace of fate
Bubbles on my body, I know it's far too late
Hair is removed by the embers hiss
Retarded people laugh, worthless life in a bliss
Eyes leave their sockets, sour taste of pus
Abscess boiling, burst and gush

Oven of disgust, companion of distrust
Medium rare for the course is a must
See the bastard smile, well be devoured by them freaks
Genitals charred, I pay the price for being meek

The hatch is open
Topping me with spice
Roasted body, their hunger's my demise

They sit around the table, those ugly fucks
Served as a three-course dinner, yucks!
Excrements boil, they don't seem to care
Brunch of flesh gobbets, in their lair

My final rest on a silver plate
I hope they on my limbs, showing my hate
Bred in a line of incesticide
Sick and deformed, not on my side

Furnace funeral
