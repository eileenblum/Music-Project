Cast into the lake of fire
Gagged by blood
A thousand deaths unwind
Storming
Perseverance is none
Repenting not
Mass decay of life
Swarming

Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise

Trapped inside a burning field
Sheep of god
Followers who did not heed
The warning
Unblessing of the purity
Once the norm
Darkness holds the blasphemy
Swarming

Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise

Insanity will reign supreme

Azazel
Belial
Abaddon
Leviathan

Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise

Those who Unbless the Purity are:
Mikael Ãkerfeldt - Vocals
Anders 'Blakkheim' NystrÃ¶m - Guitar
Per 'Sodomizer' Eriksson - Guitar
Jonas Renske - Bass
Martin 'Axe' Axenrot - Drums
