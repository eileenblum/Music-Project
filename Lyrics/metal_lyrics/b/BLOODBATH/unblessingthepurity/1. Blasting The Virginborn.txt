Nazarene
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
Resent me
Sworn enemy of the weakened heart
Cursing the miracle
Leech of the sun

Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way

Wage the war
Madness awakes and reveals its face
Truly immeasurable
Hidden in all

Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn

Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way

Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn

Nazarene
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
