Our god
A fever
Ascending
Spectral corpse
Hanging, swaying
Undead presence
Above the tombs

Infected burial mound
Ecstatic suffering
Transcend to netherworlds
To crown our vile king

Levitator
Answer to our foul incantation
Receive the channeling
Levitator
Foreboding chants of malediction
Ancient plagued curse of man

His sign engraved upon me
Proceed to drain my mind
Void of live, I lay opened
Crematorial dreams abide

Slither
In rapture
Aborting now this feeble life
Witchcraft piece us
Acknowledge our infernal death

Rise of the drugged dead
Sworn to conquer all life
