So I yearn, as a glorious zealot below
So I learn, from persistence of indoctrination
So I burn the dregs and unleash the fire in rage
Slow I burn...
Assault on his legions forever depraved

Die
Die
Morbid Antichrist

In the grip of a psychotic wreck
The tyranny your gods enrage
Vision alter, death abides
Satanic reign embraced

Grueling torture
Death's empire
Morbid Antichrist

Degenerating, profanity inflating
Regurgitating
It's time to reach to other side
Heart amputated
Beguiled
You take the morbid rites

So I spurn the predatory heavens above
So I serve only the beast inside and all the suffering
Slow I burn the frail and unleash the fire in rage
Slow they burn...
The sons of all darkness forever will be made
