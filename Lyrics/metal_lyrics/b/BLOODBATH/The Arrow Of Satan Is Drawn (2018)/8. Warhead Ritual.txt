Ruin now at hand, pandemic carnage
His maze of mortal flesh
Poisoning the well of fortitude
With weapons of disgust
Man must die for the warlord's ecstasy
Twisted genocide
Reek of death and decomposing vomit
Armageddon

Warhead ritual
A dead mind rotten to the core
A vow to slay a million more

Mercenary legions sent out to kill
The rabid traces of humanity
Gory nightmare, epic burials
Uncovered mass graves swell

No monument raise for the dead
Sewers clogged with remnants of life
