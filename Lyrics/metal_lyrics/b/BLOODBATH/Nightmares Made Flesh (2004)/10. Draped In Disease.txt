Down the sour drains
Below the world you think you know
Where man does never tread
For no sun ever shined that deep down low

Down the rotten dark
From the filth of mankind it is born
Breathing the stench of rancid sewage
Growing as a freak in the decayed brewage

[CHORUS]
From life it sets all free
Indulged in killing spree
Disguised as the one to be
Draped in disease
Medication set aside
No cure here to confide
In your veins it then shall hide
Draped in disease

Subterranean growth maligned
Abomination the kind
Balterium lord of twisted mass
Eyeless but not blind

Feasting the excrements
Of a thousand infections severe
Crawling as a snake
In the spreading epidemic lair

Down the fluid hell
Stained are the walls with its poisoned breath
Roots of pestilent plague
The rates abide its ways as a tail of death

Down the hive of chills
From the filth of mankind it now feeds
