Surgical exposure
Embalmed in blood and unaware
Your heart collapsing in the wake
Your eyes are frozen in a stare

Imprisonment in flesh
Deadened body holding cell
Neurobiosis cuts the way on through
Rotting soul condemned to Hell

I cut away
Sculpture death
Carve in your thoughts
Bloodspray
Parasite breath
Breed is the cause
Violate
Desecrate
Sever the spine
I dissect
So perfect
Muscles that bind

[CHORUS]
Soul evisceration

Nauseating pressure
Internal landscapes overflow
Bleeding forth the secrets of your soul
The human body deathrow

Installment of distress
Revolting death is now complete
Your suffering is taking human form
My own disease is named deceit
