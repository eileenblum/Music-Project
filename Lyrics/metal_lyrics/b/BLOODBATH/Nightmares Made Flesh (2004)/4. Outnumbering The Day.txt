Flames, wildfire
As far as the eye can see
Purging inferno catastrophy
Waves, highwater
At the places it shouldn't be
Sweeping, whirlpool insanity

World downfall, the fury and the chaos within
Ambushment, attack from within the Earth

[CHORUS]
When the sky turns black and nature's sounds go mute
The dead walk the Earth's last round
Outnumbering the day
All light peels away
In the flickering sway of the sun's last ray

Winds, tornado
Rage above all lands
Blowing storm out of hand

Soil, sands
Spreading across the nations
Disastrous dry desert plantations

When the rats flee off this sinking ship called Earth
The world stops turning as time dies
Outnumbering the day
All the air blows cold
As the damp mould covers more than only our old
