To believe is to deceive
Down on knees you're choked on memories
Turned into lies of pure demise
Below to lay far beyond the day

A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to crawl
Into the darkest of deaths

Forever ceased to be
(on the) ways to the grave

A flickering mind in the life rewind
Thoughts pierced and hanged on hooks
Suffering hell inside a human shell
Your body will break and crack to dust

Die - it's time to pay for all your sins
Die - consciousness devoured by a cell of soil
Die - punished and doomed as a liar
Die - hope shall be buried with maggots to coil

The presence fades away to betray
All your hope is gone
There is no one there to bring light
And out of sight you pay in mental decay
A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to rot
Into the darkest of deaths
It all ends here in euphoria and fear
The last sight is your only light in total pain
Portrayed insane
Lungs burst by vomits nursed

A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to rot
Into the darkest of deaths

Forever ceased to be
(on the) ways to the grave
