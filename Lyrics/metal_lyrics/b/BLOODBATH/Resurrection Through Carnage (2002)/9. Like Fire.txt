I am eternal
The ruler of the earth and sky
I am infernal
I am on a quest to see the heavens die
My fascination with the dead
Won't be fulfilled here on this killing spree

And when they dream
That's when my spirit arise
And when they scream
A little part of them dies
I find my way into the minds of the weak
They are led astray
It's now my path that they seek

You die before me
Your destiny is in my hands
You are soon to see
My one desire is to rule this world eternally

And when they dream
That's when my spirit arise
And when they scream
A little part of them dies
I find my way into the minds of the weak
They are led astray
It's now my path that they seek

You will never reach me
I am the darkest one
You will never heal me
A mind beyond repair
I will make you fear me
I slay your hopes and dreams
You're lost forever
In this world of mine

I devastate your life
And crush your every dream
No human being will perceive your silent scream
The king of rapture will betray your soul tonight
The life of yours is soon to end in brutal death

Don't look me in the eyes if you are awake
Just a glimpse of me will put your life at stake
I am the horizon
I am the serpent of the dead
My gaze will burn your skin and flesh into a crisp

Like fire
Like fire

This very morbid mind of mine
Will set your course into and early grave
I twist your fate and seal your doom
I bit you welcome - my eternal slave
