When you close your eyes and fall asleep
Then it's time for me to rise
You believe you are safe in dreamland
And that no one can reach you there
I seduce you in your slumber
And invite you to my world
Your body is still in the real world
But now your soul belongs to me
I will bring you torture everlasting
Unleash my hate upon you
You know I am the master of your mind now
You are lost to me
You will sleep forever

I will detain you hate you and despise you
So many ways to bring you pain
To desecrate the memory of a human
Is what it takes to make you mine

So slow
Taste my terror
So slow
I am your doom

Watch the darkness all around
Lost forever to me you are bound
Hate eternal from me to you
Desecration beyond control

Now it's time for me to murder
Yet another sleeping soul
I feed upon their dreams
And then reverse them to their face

While the world awaits the awakening
Of the breathing lifeless ones
I am off to seek a new life
To invite in eternal sleep

Sometimes you feel me
You are slipping away
But sometimes you are stronger
And won't let me stay
The pain that you bring me when you lock me out
It will be remembered 'til we meet again

Know me as the soulcollector
