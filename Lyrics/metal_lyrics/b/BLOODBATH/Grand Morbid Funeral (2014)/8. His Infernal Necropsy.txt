Feel his presence
My blood is cursed
At war with compliance
Rancid slur
Survival of the sickest
Inhale the smoke
Of a thousand funeral pyres
Disgorge and choke

Cadaverous humanity
Earth becomes a corpse
His infernal necropsy

All consuming
Satanic death
The lungs of Hell will take you
Corrosive breath
Casket village
Your habitat
My urge to murder
Thrust the nails for total collapse

Rotted angel
Rise to drain our lives
Feeble race must die
Rites of atrocity
Upon this altar

Burden be gone
Sickening slaves of greed
Fall to your knees
Madness begins as the dark is upon you
