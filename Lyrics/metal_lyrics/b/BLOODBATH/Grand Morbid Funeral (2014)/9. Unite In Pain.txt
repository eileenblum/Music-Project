In this sentence of death
Dignity's rotting away
Fouling yourself into shame

Step on the rails
Nightmare unfolding entails
Found in a heap your entrails

The deadly shadow marks your grave
You died in pain
Infested maggots eat your face
Unite in pain

Once more
Face the gore

Morbid death
I cannot find the peace of mind to pray
Morbid death
I'm paralyzed by peace in life and fail

Morbid through the days
