A plague shall fall on the weak
As He arises from His pit
To relieve this world from the filth
Once made by God now laid to rest

Finally, the time has arrived
To bestow great Death upon sheep
The vile stench from the underground
Shall be on your final breath

Oh, what a tragic sight
To see all your faith come crashing down
Beheaded, your Prophet will lie before His feet
In torment your soul will be forevermore!

Oh, the panic in your eyes as lightning strikes before you
Forced down to kneel before him
Oh, the famine of God's word will drain you,
In vain you'll gasp for mercy!

Oh, what a tragic sight
To see all your faith come crashing down
Beheaded, your Prophet will lie before His feet
In fire you'll surrender all to me!

Now gaze upon the elite,
As we stand before you!
Paralyzed by God's deceit,
Exposed to the heat!

Denial has left you in shame!
Humanity's divinity shattered for eternity!
Defiled and led into the flame!

To burn side by side to your brother, befouled infernal incineration
You choke on the stench as you start to commence,
No virgins await in the pit where you'll dwell!

Forever!

Forever!
