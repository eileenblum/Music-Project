Create worldwide deception
Create a track of doom
Contribution to an ancient tyranny of worlds

Suppression by divinity
Corruption of the soul
Trickery of submissive minds
Malevolence behold

Blasphemy and heresy
And tribunals of death
Ridden with anxiety
You reign without regret
Preachers of the light
Your fucking lies will not suffice

Psychotic, despotic
It's how hard you will try
Malleus maleficarum
You're willing to achieve
The greater good of god and soul
I will not grant reprieve

Taste my wrath as I summon knowledge
Demon eyes staring through your heart
Now it's time to swear allegiance
Weren't you always tied to the dark

Usurp the throne
I was cast to fire and stone
You use my name
To purify while you're to blame

Circle of blood
And heathen visions
Step away
From weaving flame
The boundaries of hell
Are beyond his limits
Gain your strength
And slay in my name
