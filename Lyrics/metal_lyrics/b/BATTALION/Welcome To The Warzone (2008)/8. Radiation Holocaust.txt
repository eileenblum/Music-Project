Swamps of green are damping
Fro the smelling pits of the earth
Boiling metal structures
Witness acts to an exalting death

Cold war crisis lives again
Leaders of the western world
Race the eastern tyrant kings
Primal nuclear control
Advantage built, warheads mount
Tension rise again
Talks of peace and disarm sheets
Freedom speeches lost

Choke the earth with fallout clouds
Erase your kind without remorse
Fall to fear and mind control
Theory of chaos born

Full speed head-on target clear
Countdown has begun
Nearing death's door
Hostile factions prepare for this war
Bend the truth to save your face
Blame it on your enemy
Sworn secrecy
We know what roams underground

Thousands of missiles standing
Rising heads for launch
One skeleton hand, presidential stand
Goes for the red button
The rockets sing a hymn of death
Dust will cover all
Debris is flying all around
And radiation starts to fall

Neon corpses dwell around
Mutations start to grow
Cancerous breed, infected seed
Toxic breath of millions
Another dawn, another year
Another era rotting
Chemical war is all around
And radiation it falls

Expulsion of the human race
Where is the president
Buried with the same effects
Of mass retaliation
Bunkers ooze, reactor fluids
No matter where you were
Corruption runs through human minds
Ultimate devastation
