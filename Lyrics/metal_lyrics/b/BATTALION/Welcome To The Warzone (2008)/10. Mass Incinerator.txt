Towering to the sky the chimneys fade in haze of grey
The ashes wrapping in black death
Factory of massive death
Vomit cremated remains

Ovens are the law never your children here will grow
Your future lies in licking flames
Vault of terror open wide
Extreme hatred of life

Unbridled aggressions
Decimate the prisoners by the ton
Grin tooth smile commander
I say the killing' s just begun

Condemned to die without remorse
Death procession takes it course
Dragging bodies to the pit
Subsequent abyss feast
Bestial savage deathspell

Morbid genocidal wrath
Let the dead bury the dead
Subversive acts of tribulation
A zone of piled up bodies, decay
Await the day you die
Schizophrenic sate of mind
Suffering in agony
The end of life, and humanity

Keep hanging the bodies high, the ashes still they fly
Never ending dual conflict and pain
Warlust still reigns
None shall defy

Ridden with disease, apocalyptic dormancy
The final curtain's all they see
War promoter
Mass incinerator
