Spearhead we march
To the devil's domain
Eerie and dark
Is this forsaken lair
Bodies impaled
And beheaded for lust
Better prepare
For the ultimate punishment

Beasts roam these tunnels
Eat toxic waste
Mutations so vile
Made of metal and slime

Opening the blastdoors to hell
We fire bolts of flash and flame
Fearless we will stand this storm

I'm loading my shotgun
My squad is on the edge
Soon running through this maze
Of torment and black

Invasion, we reach the black gate
Setting the bombs to blow it up
Counting, we aim down the sight
Blasting, here goes the door, to to war

Inhabitants of hell
Come through crumble and smoke
Emtying clip after clip
Still they come
Unleash our hate
We've got bullets to spare
Is there a way
We'll reach the deepest lair
