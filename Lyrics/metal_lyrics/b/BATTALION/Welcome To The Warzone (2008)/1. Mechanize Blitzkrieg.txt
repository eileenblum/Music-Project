He provides the key to hell
General desert rat
Obey his iron fist and will

Armoured core division
Tactical incision
Panzer rolling on

In this heat abyss
Forging bending steel
Altar of wargods

Ride to victory
Ride through pending doom
Ride for war and blood

Storms are howling
Cross the sands
At the general's command
Mechanized blitzkrieg

Steel is thundering through the storms
The desert will soak blood
Is anyone prepared

Tanks bleed gasoline and oil
The second slimes of war
Run from the desert throne

All servants must obey
Hail the lord of death
Mindless subordinate

The battle will commence
From all angles attacked
Then suns burns brooding red

Inside a monster's belly
Inside a tomb of steel

Inside a riding carcass
The squeaking rusty wheels

Providing little shelter
Only cries and hate commands

Aiming down the sights
Firing away powder shells

Hitting hard, hitting fast
Spreading fire full front attack
Shattered tanks and armour plates
Shooting bolts while nozzles break

Merciless
Another round
Away is another shell shock bomb
