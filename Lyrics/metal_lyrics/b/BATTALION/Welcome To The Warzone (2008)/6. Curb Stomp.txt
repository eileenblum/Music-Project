They walk the streets at night
New world order
Got other gangs in sight
Frantic aggressors
Flash knives and andish sticks
Scream bloody murder
Lead pipes and dirty tricks
Siege of power

Warriors brace yourselves
It is time to make and take a stand
Go for the throat, riot act
A full fledged gangland attack
Run your furies rampant
Through the neon city streets
Choose your weapons, meet your fate
Soldier out to strike with

Bare knuckles, broken teeth
Curb stomp, you're gonna bleed

Warriors, shadow fiends
Protect your turf and take by all means
Metal chains, iron and steel
We live by malicious intent
Run your furies rampant
Through the neon city streets
Protect and serve go to hell
Soldier out to strike with

Bare knuckles, broken teeth
Curb stomp, your jaw it breaks

Face you inner self
Face your enemy in the dark
Back alleys and slums
Battlezones where you leave you mark
Make 'em eat concrete
And plant your foot in their neck
Feed 'em broken glass
Make ready for the next attack
Inhale the calm after the storm
Another fight is won
But at what price it comes

Warriors, run and flee
The daylight comes and you got what you need
Another victim, another spoil
Another thug to join the crew
Run your furies rampant
Through the neon city streets
Cause tonight we will fight
Soldier out to strike with

Bare knuckles, broken teeth
Curb stomp, your neck it breaks
Bare knuckles, broken teeth
Curb stomp, you're gonna fucking bleed
