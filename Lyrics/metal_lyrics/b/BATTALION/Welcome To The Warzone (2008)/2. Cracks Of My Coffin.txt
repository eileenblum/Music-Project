Locked in this chamber
For ages to come
Home is here
In this oblong box
Velvet and lace
Caressing my skin
A flash of memories tells me
What has been the last winter of my life

Comatose survival
Forced me
Subconscious terror
Made me breathe

Burial rites
I can't recollect
Woke up after my medicine fix
Seen awe and horror
Nobody should
They kept me alive
By the grace of the lord

Cold sweat asphyxiate
The cracks of my coffin
It won't let me breathe
I should have been killed
While I was alive

Dirt is slowly creeping
Its way into my mind
Webs of desolation
Spread in my soul and heart
