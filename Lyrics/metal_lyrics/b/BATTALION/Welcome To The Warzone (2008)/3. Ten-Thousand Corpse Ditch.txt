Following the long road
Through the cinders of changshu
Threatening east Asian culture
Breaking through the walls
In service of the emperor
You must beware dishonor

Fearsome soldiers march into
The outskirts of the town
Bloody vengeance in their eyes
Restless heartbeats heard
In the silence it precedes
Acts truly unspeakable

Ready to destroy and degrade
Trained prepared exterminate
Burn down and obliterate
Animal is king
Smother life and profane

Stain with filth
A symbol to oppress the enemy
Red sun rises fucking fast
Massacre civilians
To increase the high death toll
Three hundred thousand more

Smell of burning embers
In the capital Nanjing
Swallowing east Asian culture
Widespread horrors
Don't contemplate the actions

City of atrocities
Acts of severity
Death, more casualties
Testament of mortality

Unheard stories of extreme brutalities
Gangrape of the women
Spike their tongue in tables, penetrate their cunt
Bayonet the babies
Gape the uterus

Forced to commit
Incest and necrophilia
Lashed and beaten man
Pummelled to the death
Decapitation common
Chopped heads in the streets
Appalling count of bodies
Punishment severe

Infamous trench
A stretch of land
Then thousand corpse ditch
The graveyard's end
Executed, mutilated
Buried fast, alive
Slaughtered for no reason
This is civilian genocide
