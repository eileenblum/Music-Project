Grinding tracks, steel mercenaries
Rolling over shattered corpses - mania
City used as tinder box
People lit as fuses

Boiling remnants in my way - sickening
Smell of gasoline penetrates

Skeleton City - Skeleton City - Skeleton City

Wiping out futile resistance
Payload cleared the instant path - to glory
Massive heat has peeled of human skin
Scrape some human waste of the street

Skeleton City - Skeleton City - Skeleton City

Into their grave they were - bombed
Clouds of ashes darken - the sun

Unleash the dogs of war
The stakes are raised
for the battle whore
Crack the whip in the silence
The stone arena - smolders to it's core

Wiping out futile resistance
Payload cleared the instant path - to glory
Massive heat has peeled of human skin
Scrape some human waste of the street
