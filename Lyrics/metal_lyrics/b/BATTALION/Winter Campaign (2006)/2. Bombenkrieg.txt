Royal Airforce on the prowl, great in numbers - take off time
Locked and loaded, sky it burns - taken by surprise
Bombs with gas and fire charged, target acquired
Head on full scale war, citizens must die

Deathstrike Retaliation
Bombenkrieg
The fire burns

No regrets and less remorse, cities molten to the core
Humans trapped in fire cages, apocalyptic signs
Million victims pay the price, become unidentified
Sadistic chain reaction, this fight is eye for eye

Discharge
Tons of death
Payload
Must destroy
German
War Machine
Third Reich
In the noose
