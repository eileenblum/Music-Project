Tank divisions, life destroyers, fire and missile gods
Artillery forward, crush the cowards, bend the steel and go
Buildings fall, soldiers die, conquerors roll on
Unleash the powers, break the walls, shrapnel in their flesh

Iron armoured beasts
War imposes will

Slaughter and destruction
Minefields and massgraves
Limbs and severed heads
Hang from bodies

Superior Fire Power [x2]

Iron armoured beasts
War imposes will

Slaughter and destruction
Minefields and massgraves

Machine gun fire rips the flesh and blows the gut
Brains are falling out, the blood flows fast and then it clots
Mounted device of terror spreads it's lead disease

Bombshell splinters fly around and strike down enemies
Eyes are lost, falling out, broken dislocated limbs
Mounted device of terror spreads it's lead disease

Tank divisions, life destroyers, fire and missile gods
Artillery forward, crush the cowards, bend the steel and go

Iron armoured beasts
War imposes will

Slaughter and destruction
Minefields and massgraves

Superior Fire Power [x2]
