Burning rage, stream of hate, countless bodies burst
Savage attack, choking on flak, mushroom cloud of death
Nuclear power, radio-active sky, H-bomb splits the night

Nuclear - Devastation - Inferno - March into hell

Total death, from the sky, burying all
Human life, agony, waste of fucking lives

Endless pain reigns in this pit of doom
Endless fights to conquer the battle storm

Saviour, straight from hell, eagle's wings in flames
Drop your load, world explodes, madness without end
Nothing remains, earth corrodes, atomic terror reigns

Iron force of bombers' thunder roar
Exploding diabolic warhead power
Nuclear beast of Armageddon
Phallus of total destruction

Endless pain reigns in this pit of doom
Endless fights to conquer the battle storm
