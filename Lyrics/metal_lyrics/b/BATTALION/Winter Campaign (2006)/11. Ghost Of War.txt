The crucifix, the swastika, the hammer and the sickle
The southern cross, the Koran and barbarians of the past

Politics with bulletbelts, religion with armor shields
Bred for war, we love it yeah, kill all of your species

Sinister attraction, overwhelmed in gore
Stench from the trenches

RISE - GHOST OF WAR
KILL - AS BEFORE

Chaotic eruption, entangled in gore
Stench from the massgraves

RISE - GHOST OF WAR
KILL - AS BEFORE

Disgusted and aroused, humanity's a whore
For war, crusade and conquest, we pray for steel and scorn

RISE - GHOST OF WAR
KILL - AS BEFORE

Shellschocked warlock, scrap the dried blood from your cloth
Bullet pierced, stained, wipe the ashes from your fucking book
Crumbled iron, lick the wounds from your dearest friends
Wolves as leaders, armies erupt to repeat it all again

RISE - GHOST OF WAR
KILL - AS BEFORE
RISE -GHOST OF WAR
PEACE - NEVERMORE

The crucifix, the swastika, the hammer and the sickle
The southern cross, the Koran and the empires of the past

Politics with bulletbelts, religion with armor shields
Bred for war, we love it yeah, killing all of you
