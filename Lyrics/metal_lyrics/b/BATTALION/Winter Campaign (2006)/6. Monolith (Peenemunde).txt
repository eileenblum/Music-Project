Titan monster - monolith

On the road to chaos, theatre of pain
Eve of mass destruction, missile never seen
Technology advancing, will this be our win?
Monolith

Victory or death, steel flows through our veins
Laboratory madness, one shell a thousand deaths
Need to turn the tide, for the FÃ¼hrer we can't fail
Monolith

V2 - our saviour

Titan monster - monolith

Facility a secret, research is obliged
Prepare the missile launcher, corrosion is at hand
Swift preparation, detonate and win
Monolith

Death from the sky - oblivion curse - strike of might
Battery power - atomic blast - sturm und drang, fÃ¼r alle
