Retaliate - answer with fire and hate
Over the wall - top the body count of the last charge

Desecrate - watch missiles light the night
Storm the front - at walls of mounted gunfire

After the outfall
Walk the endless soil
Of ravaged earth and
Our mangled mortal coil
Desolated
just make your mother die
Zombie invasion
corpses of doom march to war

Entombed - in crypts of radiation
Nuclear corpse - guinea pigs of gore

DEFCON 696

Forgotten - buried by rocks and iron
Resurrect - continue the horror show

DEFCON 696

Retaliate - answer with fire and hate
Over the wall - top the body count of the last charge

DEFCON 696
