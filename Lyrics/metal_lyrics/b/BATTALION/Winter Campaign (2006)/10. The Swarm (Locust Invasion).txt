Longtime slumber of ancient species
Alien ships with laser guidance
Lightspeed travels for annihilation
Barbaric hordes with high intelligence

Superior kind still lusts for blood
Slime and tentacles grasp at our damned souls

The locust will attack
The earth be rid of us...
And cleansed without purpose
To escape the ravenous
Who will stand the storm
When Ion blasters bomb
Armed with metal units
And shields we can't corrode

Bionic - mechanic - can we prepare the fall
No trenches - no shelter - no barriers at all
Will they land - experiment - turn our planet to dust
Crash course - in arms - no tactics ultimate war

Explosions
Locust bomb
A swarm of deadly .... steel
