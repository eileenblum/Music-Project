Winter Campaign!

Marching on - crawling through the snow
Cold wind freezes - wounded limbs and bones
Advance, no treaty - no sight of warmth and peace
Stand your ground - inhale bacteria and disease

Temperature drop below zero - nightly still - calm before storm
Suddenly an outburst of artillery fire shakes the ground
Companies are scattered Mosin Nagant is your only friend
Insomnia in the trenches where dead comrades lying left to rot

Misty morning - day breaks another fight
More exhaustion - deal with the lack of new supplies
Mother Russia - abandon your own sons
Stalingrad - field of white death it becomes

Winter Campaign!

Temperature drop below zero - nightly still - calm before storm
Suddenly an outburst of artillery fire shakes the ground
Companies are scattered Mosin Nagant is your only friend
Insomnia in the trenches where dead comrades lying left to rot

Famine, hunger - Russia sends more man
Swift battalions - "deiner Krieg er ist verloren"
Mother Russia - strengthen your own sons
"Unser Deutschland" - face dismissal of defeat

Winter Campaign!

Panzer support, rolling thunder, entering the battlefield
Detonation, shell destruction, villages in ghastly ruins
Infantry, lost in madness, shocked by terror, gasping for air

Coughing up blood, feel the blast strike, calling in for tank support
Armor backing, open warfare, steel is worth next to nothing
In the end, the strong of mind, will conquer all, and stand their ground
