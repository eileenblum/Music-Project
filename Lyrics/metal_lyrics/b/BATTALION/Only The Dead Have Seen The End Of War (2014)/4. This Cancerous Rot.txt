dark clouds and painfull suffering - boxed thoughts of consuming disease
modern day life of boiling rot - constitutional right of greed and sloth

(this cancerous rot - perverse sodomy)
epidemic violence breeding in the mind
chemical catastrophy befouling the contortion of my life
reigious support of the mass insane
biblical catastrophy befouling the madness in your brain

spend filth to discuss toxic proof - born to acid pits whoremongering fools
smoking wastelands  - districts of the thieves - war on terror - ministricide fools

mad priest of the following masses
high lord of their submissive  pressure
drowning in the pus and flesh of ignorance belief
dogmatic proposition chokes my every breath, my every death

smothered in the guts and gore of global make-belief
dogmatic proposition chokes my every breath, my every death

industrial wolves of possession - financial tyrant's oppression
human life a waste of resources - sure to die come extinct written in blood commandments
speak no evil hear no evil worship evil
