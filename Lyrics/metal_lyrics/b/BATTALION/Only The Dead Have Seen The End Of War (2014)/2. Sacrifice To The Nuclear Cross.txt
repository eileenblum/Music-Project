To the eye of the storm this world is hurling
to cosmic chaos the earth entrenched
a void of cutting nuclear hellwinds
lash at structures - reduced to ash
a crest of countless missiles honed to the killing fields
rusted tormentors of steel await the count for endless misery

toxic fumes and acid take your life
sacrifice to the nuclear cross
iron vultures sweep the kies
sacrifice to the nuclear cross
black preachers hail the fires

satan bolts this world to the cross
blak preachers hail the fires
weep at the stake of mankind's fall
the throne of steel shall arise

a nebulah of nuclear frost
covers the world in gloom
corpses litter the broken streets
the earth unconscious - a massive tomb

destined for extinction
the black prophecy fulfilled
the third tyrant has risen
and he proclaims
incantation burning fuel
roar of warhead

thunder cloven hooves
the final slaughter proves
destined for extinction
the black prophecy fulfilled
the third tyrant has risen
destined to die

bow before the plutonium altar
hazardous mutatnes - bionic death
a distressed call echoes in the distance
the crystal ball is black and burned
