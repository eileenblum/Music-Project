dominate we gather the legions - violate a promise of millions
dead and unburied call the priests from the netherworld
torn and dismembered call the priests sworn to black

the infamy of devils demons lingers in the air
the burning stench of hellish fires greet all with despair
sulphur lakes and acid pools and swarm of insect nests
eternal whipping of the souls the damned on't get their rest
spitting imps and undead rot from the godforsaken womb
drowning in the piss and blood of the abyssic tomb
wicked creatures demon tails and fangs of the grotesque
sadistic rites unburial feast a paradise incest

another taste of carrion

visions of a netherrealm where light is constant black
sarcophagus so immense it reeks of certain death
possessed spawn of hellish circle meet the world's demise
eternal circle of the lord whho's crowned in man's despise
straying from the path of light our prophecy of doom
life expectancy of planet earth to zero soon
reduced to mass grave fillings by servants of the lord
material of bloody pulp - behold

open wide the grave
