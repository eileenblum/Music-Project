a thought that lingers in tired brain
a call that some would call insane - but
it is the voice of seasoned reasoning - the one and final truth

looking up and see the world beyond
these humans that call themselves just that - and
in stupidity and their idiocracy
one hears the one and final truth

sheep and meek and ready for the final calling
load the shells and start the chants of final prayer
taste the burning ashes of the rising phoenix
statues of liberty and decimation

question aren't asked cause everyone else is
unload the guns this planet's going devastated
taste the brains and bloody mess of one another
bodybags and surgery lines - all for nothing

load the shells and start the chants of final prayer
taste the burning ashes of rising phoenix

death - the answer for this planet
blood - the final congregation
war - unnecessary technicx
done - a paradise's casket closed

billions dead - laid to rest
by their own hand - laid to fucking rest
