master I call thee - from the heavens
I beg your summoning - through my orb of alteration

world of caustic - caverns of the helpless souls - convinced of their supremacy
reap the sacred garden - do account for its treasures
slave to tunnelvision of their all belief

I curse ye all - to infinity and beyond

I look at them - snakes of gods with twisted tongue - convinced of ther sanctity
preachers of black - leaders of inverted values - interred in rotten soil of shadow life

chrack the infernal whip - eat the blackest of hearts - ceremonial oath - cleanse it at once
spirit of black - all teachings in vain - begging for fase - their eyes cannot see
incantational chants - no sign of redemption - my thunderous palms - destroyer of worlds

ave dominus, dominus inferi
I open the old book - written before time
in ancient of all tongues - I will cite the rites

ave dominus, dominus inferi
skies start to crumble - demons arise
gates to oblivion - portals of tinal tides
