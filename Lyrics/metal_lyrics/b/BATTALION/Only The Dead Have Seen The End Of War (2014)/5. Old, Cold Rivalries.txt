awaken to a world of dust and barren land
testament to the lust of cold war prayer
interred in massive boxes, bent steel and stone
the old flame sparks here still for our war prayer
incantations demagogue - our passion for extinction
we lay our heads to rest - severed from grace
tribulation ludicrous - tips the scales of life again
incongruous state of mind - afflicts the flame within

old, cold rivalries - callin forth old cold rivalries

bestial winds lash at the earth - carries the scent of death
poison clouds of chmical disease - acquired taste
herald of pestilence - carry forth the wagon
of this splendid capacity - eraser mind

mass psycho therapy of capital bonfires
iconic imagery of landmarks burnt to w aste
built op to the old, cold blast of bitter rivalries
the spearhead laughs with bitter grin
and turns to moral blasphemies

question you all, those of you who sinned
the downfaal of this world that bursts out from within
