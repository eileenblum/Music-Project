channelling my soul into the tunnel of pure light
remembrance - green meadows - all in hindsight
purulence and soul draination - six walls my final rest
cascade of impurity - the entangling thralls of death

echoeing cries in halls of the fallen - my last rites a soldier's death
in blood - no salvation - in blood - battle worn
in blood - final breath - in blood - remembrance

wailing souls of fallen comrades echo in beyond
no more life - no more hate - just freezing cold
purest blackness waits for all those who died on the fields today
innocence was left so long ago - we who have lost

back tot he dead - back from the tomb - not in human form - back to the womb
into the well of souls - into the fallen hall - into eternal rest - or back to the fray
join me in their memory - fade to faith for all to see
unsung heroes - body count - mother earth - your blooddrenced ground
remembrance in blood

tears that kiss the earth swell into the rivers of the flood
washing away all my sins, my killing count
diregard for life's commandments - their mirage of choice
is what my soul is bound to - leave this mortal coil
