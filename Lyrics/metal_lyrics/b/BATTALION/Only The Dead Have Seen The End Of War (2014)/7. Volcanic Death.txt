amfibian tracks on our way to the island - ready to charge at the captain's command
mustangs clear out the waterfront forts - ditches of grey spitting sulphur and lead

volcanic death
iwo jima - signal the attack, iwo jima -  your gas makes us sick

digging through tunnels at mount suribachi
ingenious plan for a mass hillside grave
grenade suicide the only way we know to die
at the emperor's will in which Kuribayashi fulfills

ways to the grave - in ballte no-one is spared
a theatre of dust and death - lifeless statues are the bodybags
another tour of duty in another land - delaying our advance but we will withstand
Japanese kamikaze fighters - suicide bombers dirty tricks
guerilla warfare rock and sand - a place of fear and lack of air
discipline of survival - lessons of war brutally taught

zeroes and artillery strike our natural force - flamethrowers clear out the bunkers once more
give the  gor for a quick flanking spread - the emperor's servants eat sulphur and lead

discipline of survival - general or emperor
sacrifice unto thy  name and plant the stars and stripes of fucking pain
