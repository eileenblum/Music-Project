Welcome to this perfect creationâ¦
Baptized as the pride of the nation where we endorse corruption and violence
We're not safe in this false utopia, laws have pockets full of emptiness

Who am I to question the savior of the nation? You're a scum of this system
Why should we fear the incompetence of power? It's a problem to face
What did we do to deserve this? We choose them
Do these abusers understand it? Their eyes are blinded by the "gold shine"
Broken dreams to the morgue

We are not safe in this false cognition of security

Hear the sound of disgrace knocking at your door
A country cultivated by the ideology of bureaucratic pigs that blocked your mind
You're not worth enough to think for yourself
Intimidation, the favorite contraceptive method to stop the evolution of the nation
This involution will be proclaimed as a new way of life

We support the approval of this manufactured violence
Cruelly abusing the incapable
A servile of stupidity is born every second
We're not safe in this false cognition of security
Hear the sound of disgrace knocking at your door
Given to understand as they carry broken dreams to the morgueâ¦

They only look for your money carrying the chain of dismissals
Resting in their thrones made of dead illusions and abuse
Ready to mount the system that created them

Who am I to question the savior of the nation?
Why should we fear the incompetence of power?
What did we do to deserve this?
Do these abusers understand it?
