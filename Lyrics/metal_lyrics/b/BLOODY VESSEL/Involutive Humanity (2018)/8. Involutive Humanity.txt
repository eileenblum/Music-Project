[feat. PUL5AR]First impressions are main but don't judge a book by its cover
Why are we such a machine of prejudices?
Don't feel special while judging, you think you're perfect
You're a being full of mistakes

Humanity retreats everyday
We involute at every step
You need courage to accept
Believe in yourself

Do you feel special? It's hard to believe you've come this far
Do you feel special? You're a poor quality product

In this world of constant disappointment
We've gone through wars, massacres, hardships and yet we didn't solve our differences
I still believe in the unification of thoughts
No more rejection, no more fucking pain
Do you feel special? It's hard to believe you've come this far

Still trusting this world?
C'mon say it, believe it, feel it!
Depression's not your friend
The point's that you wake up
You gave it all but you've conformed
Don't conform easilyâ¦

This cold reality is what we see everyday, life failures erased
We exist to procreate fools, spawns destined to exterminate each other

Now, first of all, we'll fall headlong under the feet of our decisions
No one will prevail

This will be our last day, millions of lives extinguished
It's hard to believe this, nobody will be saved
