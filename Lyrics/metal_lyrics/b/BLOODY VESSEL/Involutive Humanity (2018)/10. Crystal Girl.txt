Fragile and volatile, she is made of glass
Delicate and flimsy, she is beautiful
But your apathy will destroy her
Why do you make her go through this?
Suffering your abuse, wounds that will never heal
Her mind is tortured day and night
Why do you make her go through this?
Psychological wounds infused by your coward words

She's not guilty of your lack of virility
She doesn't deserve the punishment to which you make her go through
Beneath the surface fear increases, you feel superior while you see her cry and bleed!
She's not your property, beware abuser!

Sweet and extroverted, she is perfect
Fragile and volatile, she is made of glass
Delicate and flimsy, she is beautiful
Wonderful and gorgeous, more than what you've given

You really know that she doesn't deserve it
She's a light fading out by your darkness
Wake up! Girl you know that you're not guilty
You feel superior while you see her cry and bleed!
She's not your property, beware abuser!
