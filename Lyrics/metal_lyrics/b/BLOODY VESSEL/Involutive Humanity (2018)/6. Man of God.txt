Their faith is broken, they believe in the deliverance when their sentence is evident
Frightened by seven sins

They surrender their souls to their beliefs
Brash followers of The Bible
Parishioners marching through the gates of Hell

Pray, pray for the forgiveness of God
Afraid of Hell, they forget their common sense
Living with the words on a book of lies
A disease consuming faith, washing the heads of the ignorant
A pederasty ruling believers with falsehoods
Living off child abuse, living on stolen money
A mortal man who assures you'll enter the heavens
Holy ignoranceâ¦ in the name of God

Our father who arts in heavens, hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven
And forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors, lead is not into temptation
And deliver us from evilâ¦

Fuck the angels, fuck the demons
Fuck the priests, fuck the Vatican

Where the skull of kids are piled up
Where the gaze of God deviates
We witness God demise
Holy Pope â holy Devil

Father forgive me because I have sinned
