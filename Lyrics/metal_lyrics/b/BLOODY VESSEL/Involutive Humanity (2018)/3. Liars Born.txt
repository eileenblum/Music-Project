Placed on a pedestalâ¦
Lord of lies
Maker of disgraces
Why they do this to us?
Ask yourself why we choose them
Empires turned to dust
The fault is only one
A man corrupted in the dark

He ascended in lies and deceit, driven by his perversion
They pray for the money, God Almighty
Controlling the population with techniques of persuasion
Abuse of power â they who deny our freedoms
Abuse of power â they sell our lives
Abuse of power â auction our integrity
Abuse of power â they sell us for nothing

They, who reload weapons with ignorance
Dropping bombs in this "utopia"

Atrophies of truth, masters of deception
Puppeteers controlling masses
Look at these, sitting in their offices watching people suffer from their decisions

Don't disagree, nobody can touch them
Injustice and impunity, will we witness as this docile state falls?
Kneel before my feet and beg for mercy

Placed on a pedestal, lord of lies, maker of disgraces
Why they do this to us? Ask yourself why we choose them
Empires turned to dust â we will be turned to dust
Renders your mind, falls to the void
Will we witness as this docile state falls?
