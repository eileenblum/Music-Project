See my new messiah carrying the cattle to extermination
A horrible annihilation

The factory of human mistakes continues with its production
Millions of zombies walking throughout the land starting an apocalypse
Insemination of devastation, guide of madness guiding the insurrection
Infusing lies in people's heads, their eyes fail to see the truth

Cries executing the debauchery
Families watching the burning bodies
We are not perfect
We are prepared to die

Scars of your past will cover your skin
The hate will remain in your mind

Victims guide onto a womb of a reality adequated to them
Victims in progress
