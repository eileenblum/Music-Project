A town engulfed in war

Drowned into bullets and blood, they're the warriors
Hundreds of people born in the cradle of action
Tanks and soldiers fighting against the damned
Piles of corpses forming trenches
An advanced army annihilates every trace of life in its wake
Children under ten carrying their rifles, pointing to their nearest enemy
Mothers raise killing machines, their only wish is to protect their home
A country submerged in greed began this war to enrich itself

A simple example of power demonstrated by the ash warriors
Brave lives that wake up waiting death without any hope of tomorrow

Born in fire, fire shall be, ashes they will become
Corpses destroyed by explosions, faces disfigured by survival scars
War as a business, powder as currency; a community asediated by an indiscriminated combat

Ash warrior â the definition of a natural survivor

The severed creation of belic conflicts
The remains of innocent lives cover the ground
Their sorrow roam the streets, their silence speak through guilty ears
Marks of bombings and shootings cover my skin
Blood of my family is beneath me
With my gun warm and my hands stained, I point my goalâ¦

Reload, aim, fire!

The calm before the storm has never ARRIVED!
