Root out the roots of misery, we will not let this happen again

Those malicious herbs planted by society have grown
This field of impurity will be sprayed on gasoline
The scarecrows won't scare the scavengers that plague us
They feed on perversion of our kind
The fond paraphilia of the most violent animal on the planet
The one that kills for pleasure to satisfy his sexual desire massified by his increasing insanity

Humans, naturally disturbing beings
Humans, genetically created to procreate
This is the only thing the humanity has achieved through the years

What a disappointment
The countless anecdotes of this tragedy will be forgotten
What a waste
The stench of future massacres increases as the days go by
We became addicted draining the pleasure of the dead
What a fucking shame

[Interlude]

See how my house is turned into nothing
All idols will fall from their respective pedestals
People will convulse when they see their crumbled beliefs

I broke their destinies, trampled what was already written for them
Innocence is rewarded with suffering everyday
Like a hangman I will execute your making
