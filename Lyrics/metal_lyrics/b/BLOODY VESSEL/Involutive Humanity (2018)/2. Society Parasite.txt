They follow the popular trends
Masses of idiots guiding generations

They change the mentality of children
Infect them with their "knowledge"
Reprogramming is our fault
Leaving them in front of the TV

Teaching them how to dress
Teaching them how to speak
Teaching them how they should look
It raised a generation of clones

It raised a generation of clones
Wrong concepts of beauty and perfection
Women mutilating their faces with plastic surgery
Trying to seek perfection screaming at their reflection
Destroying their natural beauty

You will never be beautiful
Hating themselves for not replicating "perfection"

Torturing their bodies because they're fat
Killing themselves from the inside
Self-flagellate to be accepted by society
Worship what is popular
Our kids lie before the lies on TV

A generation condemned by their ignorance
Their ignorance, their fucking ignorance
