Like turning water to wine, the minds of humans will change

They are susceptible to my monologue, do you hear whispers when you are alone?
Your brain is adapting to what you see everyday, overload in progress
See the world through the eyes of a filthy whore, infection began to disfigure your way to be
A virus spreads like spores in the air, just like "poverty" among the middle classes

They say the pen is mightier than the sword, with this pen and blood they wrote history
We medicate our bodies to stop feeling the pressure on our shoulders
A ton of worries forced our decay
All classes suffer at the hands of Capitalism, Communism and those shits
Another uprising of the masses leading to extinction, their wallets feed the fire of my greedy pockets

Through my eyes, all I see, is the people fall before me
Are bugs that will crush my feet (crack crack)
It's the sound they make when they die (crack crack)
It's the sound that highlights their weakness (crack crack)
It's the sound that marks their defeatâ¦

I will exercise free will, that is what they lack
Their previous decisions were calculated by their superiors
This is my gift to you, the power to choose your way
Nobody is right, nobody is wrong
Who says that this won't be repeated again?

Another uprising of the masses leading to extinction, their wallets feed the fire of my greedy pockets
Through my eyes, all I see, is the people fall before me
