Dixit autem serpens
Nequaquam morte moriemini
Diabolus!Luciferi!

In the coming sole solarfall
My shadows will capture you
Lay my claws upon your soul
Corrupting everyone

It's the Death who came to claim you

Funereal, its song
Your soul wanders at night
Amongst graves bearing your name
For you are dead

Ravenous Demonium

Divine Intervention
Of Hellish splendour
The Earth will suffer
One thousand years
One thousand years sunk in shadows
As despair and pain
Blacken the skies

At the tolling of a bell
Your soul to be torn apart
Funeral chanting
For the Devil is always near
Of lengthening shadows
And eyes burning coal
Nebular vistas
Draping the cosmic uproar
