Fire! Pain!
Fear! Disdain!
Annihilation!
Revenge and hate!

Funeral dirges echoes
At heaven castle's walls
Forgotten in the shadows
Tonight shall fear thy name

A hellish judgement begins
God was convicted and guilt
Scaffold was built in heaven
To punish those biblical lies

Bring down the sky defenses
To erase their dying myths
Impiety and hate are weapons
To vanquish them and triumph

Behold the flame of wrath
To burn the entire christian realm
Vanquish all their enemies
Erase any trace of obedience

Wrath of Legion
Bringing fire and pain
Wrath of Legion
Inspiring fear and revenge

"Ashdautas vrasubatlat!
Garjapanuk agh vrasub!"

Thy infernal legions came
Demanding a new crown
A dark and mighty emperor
At vindicate the throne

A new empire of glory
Will be a human realm
To climb a mountain of bones
And there put thy throne

Ashdautas vrasubatlat!
Garjapanuk agh moraumang vrasub!
Magas burz mokal, arma ukul!
Krak kurvkuu zidru pauanug drokob gavik!
Vrasubatburuk ug butharubatgruiuk!
