"Mortuus quod in caelum
et mortuus quod in terra ad aeternum"

When mankind desperates
Where was the saviour might?
When the nails was carved
Where was the hand of god?
When the spear ripped flesh
Where was the messiah's blood?
Here is the legion of inferno
Rising a fierce companion!

Disciples flee for fear of death
Veils ripped in supreme impotence
Even the sun retreat
While savior dies in pain

Quod superius, sicut inferius
Mortuus quod in caelum et quod in terra
Crucificatus! Mors ad caelum
Putrefactus ad aeternum

Mortuus est! Quod in caelum
Mortuus est! Et quod in terra
Crucificatus, mortuus et sepultum
Et descendit ad infernum

His elect denied him at cross
Misfortune rests on his clothes
The price of his life, a hanging
Eloi eloi, lama sabactani?

The universe itself
Gives signs of complete seizure
A earthquake opened graves
Spitting worthless bones
Hell rejecting those bastards
From earthly womb of embers
The psalmody of decadence
Decayed as your redeemer
