In hell!
Eternal flames devours you
Inhaling!
Sulphur clouds and dust of bones
Crawling on ashes of a incinerated world
As more you begs, more we torture you!

Inner fear!
Unthinkable was your beliefs
Crushing!
Spitting on a broken cross
Disgorging blood on the nazarene's portrait
Rise our artillery to declarate war against heaven!

The unavoidable choice
Claims your decision now
Regret your stupid beliefs
Or still enslaved by the creed of the church!

Step through the wide open door
Regret your christian brand
Those who believe in saviour
Deserve die as their god
Rise the banner of Antichrist
Enter the ungodly world ahead
Rise a blood cup to salute
Ourselves and our inner demons

Regret your stupid beliefs
Or still enslaved!

Inner fear!
Unthinkable was your beliefs
Crushing!
Spitting on a broken cross
Disrupting!
With any divine law
Carving!
A god inside you!

Pierced hands was cut off
Spitting on altar of useless cult
On abyss of madness of religious filth
Inhaling sulphur we still untrusted

Crushing!
Spitting!
Disrupting!
With any divine law
