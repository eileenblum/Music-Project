Storming the realms of Holiness
With the banners of the unholy one
Burning hearts, in hate and in malice
Weapons loaded and ready to discharge

Apocalyptic sorceries
...to be fulfilled at this deadly night
Under the wings of the unholy Archangel
...we attack
Impiously we shall attack!

Heavenly cadavers, piles of ruins
Feathers extracted feed our flames
As we shall bring down the gates of Heaven
In forgotten wisdom, shall we chant

As the shadows rule supreme
As the old days of witchery
Black magic and other sorceries
Shall ban the Divine

Fire! Hell that ignites
Fire! Incinerated Heaven
Fire! Warfare of flames
Fire! Until only ashes remain

Infernal one, the new Divine
Under his flag of Darkness we'll march

Apocalyptic sorceries to be fulfilled at this deadly night
Under the wings of the unholly Archangel we attack
Impiously we shall attack!

There where the sun never shine on the sky
There where the fire of inferno grows
There where only skulls remains after
A battle among giants unknown
Land of no more light
Land of eternal greed
Land where embers carving eternally
Their marked flesh
