Demonic beings of scorched black wings
Ancient demons of cutted wrists
Nazarene saviour down his head in retreat
Ravager legion arrives on Earth

To fulfill the revenge of damned angels
Of the four corners in embers of Hell
Malignant emperor and his ambassador
Read the declaration of war to heaven

Awake black crowned Kings
Invoked by empty thrones
Erase all human beings
And extinguish any resilient light!

Black crowned kings
Invoked by empty thrones
Heaven was scorched!
Ravaged by infernal greed!

Descend to erase human beings
Make them fear their beliefs...

The sixth cup of satanic revenge
Seven trumpets of abyss announces
The end of divinities that enslaved human ones
Heaven falls on eternal doom

The hammer of hell beats the altar
And condemns divine ones to exile
All kingdom of heaven now was defeat
The end of heavenly defeated empire
