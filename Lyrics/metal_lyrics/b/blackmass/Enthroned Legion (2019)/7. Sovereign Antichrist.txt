"Sovereign Antichrist
Thy kingdom come
Almighty Satan!
Thy will be done"

Depraved being appeal of the flesh
Conquering heavens ad there triumph
Where enslaved ones beg for mercy
They're all dust, to dust will return

A envious seraphin, sentenced one
A devious messiah who never will return
Where only weak and disgustly ones
They are all in darkness and there must remain

Sovereign Antichrist!
Thy death kingdom come
Deranged emperor!
Vindicating a throne and a crown

Only you deceiver, hear my pray Satan
Over me bring thy light, read my mind Lucifer
Only I know my doom, redeems me Samael
Oh my lord reveals me thy desires Leviathan

A dying saviour, creator who kills
One more harmless fable to despise
Where gods die by human hands
And men create god as their own glance

Where fierce embers devours their flesh
Incandescent chains fetters your heart
Deranged choir ressounded in mind
Inviting them to commit ritual suicide

Almighty Antichrist!
Thy murder will be done
An realm done by worms!
Becoming a new Eden sworn
