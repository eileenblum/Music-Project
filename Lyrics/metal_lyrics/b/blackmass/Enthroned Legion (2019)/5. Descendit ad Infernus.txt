Foolish and weakest of the gods
Man betrayed and deprived of rage
Oh exiled who was condemned
When slapped always offers another face

You've died, among thieves
Making the weak appears to be strong
Your demise will be oblivion
Until the devil collect your soul

Failed king of earthly things
Addicted in human weaknesses
A god just worshiped by lepers
The scum of earth, as his own image

Descendit ad infernum
Reign of no more life

"Scepter of the banished
Torch of traitors
Confessor of crucified and of executioner
Only you know in which envious swamp
A jealous god hides his valuable jewels"

You who kept your bones unbroken
That a centurion did not make in wreckage
Eternal despair of those who suffer
To anoint them with spit and tears

[Inspired and rewritten in "Revolte" of Charles Baudelaire]
