[Lyric: Magus Dux Adramelech S.D., Music: Lord Aeshma]

In the blacken solarfall
The shadows trek on you
Layer your hands in your body
Lay about one
Is the Death came have a row you
Funereal is your song
Your soul wander at night
With your wit dead

Ravenous Demonium

Divine intervention
Succumbed by raven God
The Earth will suffer
One thousand years
One thousand years from the shadows
Despair and pain
The sky dashes darken

Inside the dark mind
Now is one by one
Amongst fire, blood, and ice
Notch your heart
You possessed by Evil
Nothing get stop it
Ironclad âtill head
Prepared for die

In the blacken solarfall
The shadows trek on you
Layer your hands in your body
Lay about one
Is the Death came have a row you
Funereal is your song
Your soul wander at night
With your wit dead

Ravenous Demonium
