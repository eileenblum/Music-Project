[Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech S.D., Music: Lord Aeshma]

With two candles burning in the altar
Amid raven fog spirits appear
With the darkest  book
Opened in your sin hands
And say the mystic words of Hell

The ritual begins
Cold is the night
Spirits open your graves
Hear my call
One droop of blood
You cannot return
The mystic symbol appears now

Diabolical Ritual
Liberates my soul to wander
Diabolical Ritual
Liberates my soul

It 13 day the Sabbath is complete
On this night the black forces came for you
Only hint the Evil came in your life
Hint the Evil enter inside you

Welcome to my great ritual
So say the Evil is my Lord
You see the demons fly âround you
Beneath the black moonlit
You open the darkest book
And proclaim the name of Evil

Welcome to my great ritual
So say the Evil is my Lord
You see the demons fly âround you
Beneath the black moonlit
You open the darkest book
And proclaim the name of Evil

Diabolical Ritual
Liberates my soul to wander
Diabolical Ritual
Liberates my soul

With two candles burning in the altar
Amid raven fog spirits appear
With the darkest  book
Opened in your sin hands
And say the mystic words of Hell
