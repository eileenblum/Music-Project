[Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech S.D., Music: Lord Aeshma]

...War...
The satanic machine
March inside of the sky
The killer machine running upon the fire
Kill my enemies as a panzer of Hell
The Christianâs faith is going down
Blood from the head, from the lamb
Destructive power of Evil
Army of Satan marches across the storm
The black warriors show your hate
Virgin statues are going to cry blood
When the azure becomes Black-Purple
Fire, blood, and death are (for us) pleasure
Killer machine,
Attack, Attack, and Attack

999 the Eternal War
666 the Eternal Victory
999 the Christianâs War
666 the Satanic Victory

Celestial war between Hell and Heaven
Traces of Devastation in the black hearts
Death and more death came from the darkness
Shadows burn the celestial Temple

The altars of Christ will turn into dust
The fire burns the âBeautifulâ (dead) sky
Pain and more pain to the Christianity
Killer machine,
Attack, Attack, and Attack

Advenire, venire Ego vocare spoire Inferna

Army of Satan marches across the storm
The black warriors show your hate
Fire, blood, and death are (for us) pleasure
Killer machine,
Attack, Attack, and Attack

999 the Eternal War
666 the Eternal Victory
999 the Christianâs War, 666 Satanâs Victory.
