[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

I am the unholy creature
From the ancient times
Awaken from the past
With eternal rage and hate
My heavy wings will shake
The holy Christian's universe
I'll destroy everyone
Who puts a fake god above me (and)

A Scherzo wardrum beat

I fly through the skies
Upraised from the grave
With wings of blood tide
I'm bringing the eternal pain
I'm nocturnal worshipper
Who shots across the fire
And I'll fly all night long
Searching for fresh blood

I am Nemesis -- Feralis Deus
I am Nemesis -- Cruori Sanguis

A Scherzo wardrum beat
From the poison-hearted
And nymphets eclipsed
By the rays of moon at the wane
Revealing schemes for the perpetual Damned boon

I am Nemesis -- Orlog Fatalis
I am Nemesis -- Mortiis in Flammae

I am Nemesis

Glorious midnight muse's choir
With sweet voices of eternal vengeance
An awful orchestra of bones and bowels
To worship Satan once again

I am Nemesis -- Feralis Deus
I am Nemesis -- Cruori Sanguis

Arabesques of Thaurgia
The bitter taste of eternal death
Blood will fall down on the ground
Paving the way to Hell

666 ego sum

Befogging vistas of bloodcurdling
Auld lang syne
Bawdy images of serpent's tongues
And lips blood-crimsoned
Archangels, Seraphims, and Angels
Those I chose to mortify
Heaven's creatures are carrion
Those I chose to mortify

I am Nemesis -- Orlog Fatalis
I am Nemesis -- Mortiis in Flammae

I am Nemesis...
I am Nemesis...
