[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Infernal Ones awoke from the shadows
With ghastly faces and horror to destroy the Feeble Ones
Releasing the pain to rip them off
A fire storm enslaving all the angels of mercy

White feathers fell down over the ground
Of a bloodstained Heaven crying out with universal fear
Driving nails into celestial fleshes
A blood storm enslaving all the angels of pity

 Bleeding Heaven's Angels

Satan's creatures flying high beyond the whitegrace
Nailing the Feeble Ones on burning crosses

The dark skies to hew up the light
Showing the way to Satan's night
Fire and blood from Satan war master
(We're) Bleeding Heaven's Angels

Bleeding Heaven's Angels

Satan's creatures flying high to huntChristians down
Nailing the Feeble Ones on crosses of thorns

Satan's might carrying the end of this time
Cutting up angel's head on the last day of Heaven
Darkness and sorrow to all that's holy
(We're) Burning Heaven's Angels

Maestro Diavolo Enim

Infernal Ones awoke from the shadows
With unearthly eyes of burning coal and hatred
Destroying the churches and Christ's pictures
To exalt the black throne of Satan above all

To exalt Satan above all

Satan's might carrying the end of this time
Cutting up angel's head on the last day of Heaven
Darkness and sorrow to all that's holy
(We're) Burning Heaven's Angels

The dark skies to hew up the light
Showing the way to Satan's night
Fire and blood from Satan war master
(We're) Bleeding Heaven's Angels
