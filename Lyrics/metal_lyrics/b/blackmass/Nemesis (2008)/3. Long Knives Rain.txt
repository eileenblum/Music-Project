[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Battalions of million horned demons
Nowadays bring infernal promises of victory
All the paths lead to the battleground
Yesterdays bring dying promises to Christians

Tonight our torches will tear the night
And we shall vanquish our enemies easily
Tonight our magical weapons of fire and shadows
Will bring a new era, rising up Hell

Rising up Hell

Long Knives Rain is falling
Long Knives Rain
Long Knives Rain is falling
Long Knives Rain

Cannons discharging thunders and lightning
The very Earth will shake as we march by
Million black flags with Satan's names unfurled
The earth itself will be on fire

As we bring the end of this time
This is the end of a Heaven
This is the end of all the miracles
Our new time is coming as we burn down the Christians

Long Knives Rain is falling
Long Knives Rain
Long Knives Rain is falling
Long Knives Rain

Planetaria phantasmata
Satan's monster flying high above
An ocean of blood and celestial crying
A sarkos phagein to the world

As we bring the end of this time
This is the end of a Heaven
This is the end of all the miracles
Our new time is coming as we burn down the Christians

Long Knives Rain is falling
Long Knives Rain
Long Knives Rain is falling
Long Knives Rain
