[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Planetaria compositions
It's Nemesis unleashed
The Earth itself is on fire
Chanting Satan's names
Rise phantoms rise!
It's darkness - it's pain
The final cut on celestial faces
Universe is now in panic

All of Hell's powers are now
Unleashed for devouring light
Standards in black unfurled
These are verses and curses of Satan
March demons march!
Set the world on fire
Reload the weapons to destroy
It's the final cut -- the final act

Burn! Burn It Down!
Burn It Down,
The celestial temple of God!
Burn! Burn It Down!
Burn It Down,
The holy church of Christ!
Burn! Burn It Down!
Burn It Down,
The feeble castle of lies!
Burn! Burn It Down!
Burn It Down,
The image of a poor lord!

The dying Heaven creeps crying
About its creatures of holy writ
Armageddon, Apocalypse, and Nemesis
The sphinx of time is frozen
Praise the infernal one, praise!
See the world is on fire
Our empire has come
Attack infernal hordes attack!

Hark! The fire eating everything
The sweet melody of angels crying
The satanic battalions are marching
Earth quakes -- oceans rise!
Hark! The battle's sounds of steel
Our torches from Hell
Will deliver the holy tragedy
Glorify our Satan Master, glorify!

Burn! Burn It Down!
Burn It Down,
The celestial temple of God!
Burn! Burn It Down!
Burn It Down,
The holy church of Christ!
Burn! Burn It Down!
Burn It Down,
The feeble castle of lies!
Burn! Burn It Down!
Burn It Down,
The image of a poor lord!
