[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Wondrous Hell's Flames

When the flames of my kingdom
Swallow every hallow
Shaping in fire a million destinies
Stalking tender preys
Wandering the ancient path
Marching to the black hate-hearted
The cosmic spiral of fear
Again, I select for reigning supreme

"Thou art in my darkness
And thine eyes shall see my power
In my land the moon is always
In blood-scarleted
Thou shalt suffer, eternity
Here light hath no powers
Thou openest thy own grave
In the land of undying Satan's flames"

Swathe the necro saints
Notch down my number and name

Welcome to my infernal lair
Hail horrors, hail beasts
Thou art surrounded by my fire
By my Wondrous Hell's Flames

Wondrous Hell's Flames

I'm shadows of doom!

And when the pendulum of life
Falls back from its threshold
And revert space and time
I shall withstand with my demons
Snapping paradise
To spread my darkness everywhere
I shall set the world on fire
To annihilate the Christian's paradise

To annihilate the Christian's paradise

Welcome to my infernal lair
Hail horrors, hail beasts
Thou art surrounded by my fire
By my Wondrous Hell's Flames

Wondrous Hell's Flames

I'm black Devil!

All the spendour of a Heaven's light
Was dragged by my unholy darkness
A mordant power for Hell
I form and rule
I smote my scythe
And angel's head fell down over the ground
Swathe the necro saints
Notch down my number and name
Wondrous Hell's Flames
Wondrous Hell's Flames
