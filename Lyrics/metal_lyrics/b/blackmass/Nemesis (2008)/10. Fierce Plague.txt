[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Rotting from inside out
All the virulent humankind
Calling forth the flesh devourers
Angels of infernal principles
With poisoned blood and cold heart;
Until the very man's end
I shall stay all supreme
Forever and beyond

Thou shouldst know
I'm the curse of all curses
Thou canst accept it
And then devote yourself to me
In the world I shall rule
God hath no voice, no will, and no power
I shall contaminate the Earth
With my fury and fatal poison

Fierce Plague
You (weak) say my name
Fierce Plague
You (weak) feel my rage
Fierce Plague
I bring the slaughter
Fierce Plague
Through aeons I shall stay

I'm Fierce Plague who destroys you!
I'm Fierce Plague who enslaves you!

To overwhelm all of the God's fake fables
I shall be the infernal plague and so on
I call forth all of my shadows and destructive flames
Oh, darkness supreme darkness, appear now!

I'm Fierce Plague who captures you!
I'm Fierce Plague who devours you!

Ripping away at the core
Let the seed of my demoniacal kingdom
Grow up and overtake the world
Shattering away the Christian's glass hearts
My powerful domination has come
All nations will burn under my wings
Because I'm mighty, I'm darkness, I'm plague, I'm Satan!

Fierce Plague
You (weak) say my name
Fierce Plague
You (weak) feel my rage
Fierce Plague
I bring the slaughter
Fierce Plague
Through aeons I shall stay

I'm Fierce Plague who enslaves you!
