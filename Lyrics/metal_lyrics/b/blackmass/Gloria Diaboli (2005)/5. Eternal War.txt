[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

...War...

The satanic machine
Marches inside of the skies
The killer machine running upon the fire
Kill my enemies as a panzer of Hell
The Christianâs faith is going down
Blood from the head, from the lamb
Destructive power of Evil

Army of Satan
Marches across the storm
The black warriors show your hate
Virgin statues are going to cry blood
When the azure becomes black-purple
Fire, blood, and death are (for us) pleasure
Killer machine, attack, attack, and attack

999 the eternal war
666 the eternal victory
999 Christianâs fall
666 Satanâs victory

Celestial war between Hell and Heaven
Traces of devastation into the black hearts
Death and more death came from darkness
Shadows attack the celestial temple

The altars of Christ will turn into dust
The fire burns the âbeautifulâ (now) dead sky
Pain and more pain to the Christianity
Killer machine, attack, attack, and attack

Army of Satan
Marches across the storm
The black warriors show your hate
The Christianâs faith is going down
Virgin statues are going to cry blood
Fire, blood, and death are (for us) pleasure
Satanic machine, destroy, destroy, and destroy

999 the eternal war
666 the eternal victory
999 Christianâs fall
666 Satanâs victory
