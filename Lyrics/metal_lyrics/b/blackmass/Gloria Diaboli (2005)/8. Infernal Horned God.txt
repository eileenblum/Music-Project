[Music:  Lord Aeshma and Magus Dux Adramelech, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

The night of the demoniacal wings
From the darkest Infernoâs breathe
Satanâs legions flying over the castle
Of poor lord Jesus Christ
Into a satanic bath of blood
Taken from the white angels
Ave Satanas our infernal horned god
Rings of fire above all
Rings of fire inside our hearts
The moon with its pale eyes
In conspiracy with Satan lord
Fearful portrait painted in blood
Blood that fell from the angels smirching the white kingdom
Ave Satanas our infernal horned god

Lambs of Christ destroyed
Temple of Christ destroyed
Churches of Christ destroyed
Faith in Christ destroyed
Itâs time to revenge
Itâs time to destroyed
Ave Satanas our infernal horned god
Crosses of Christ broken
Symbols of Christ broken
Itâs time to reveal
Itâs time to murder
Satanâs legions flying over the lambs
Of poor lord Jesus Christ
Ave Satanas our infernal horned god

Satan is god high above
Satan is enthroned with bravery
Satan flies beyond the hopeâs goal
Satan flies beyond the Heavenâs servants

De secretis operibus artis et satanorum magiae
Shall be eternal our shadow ghost

The sun no more rises
A dark that always must be
The moon is the new one
Stina-baal
The sun no more rises
Satan shall be the one
Satan is the true light
Stina-baal

Our infernal horned god
Under the blackened sky
The demonâs mass flying high above
Domination has come
Our infernal horned god
The night will be forever
The awakening of the true light will prevail
Deo Satanas

Lambs of Christ destroyed
Temple of Christ destroyed
Churches of Christ destroyed
Faith in Christ destroyed
Itâs time to revenge
Itâs time to destroyed
Ave Satanas our infernal horned god
Crosses of Christ broken
Symbols of Christ broken
Itâs time to reveal
Itâs time to murder
Ave Satanas our infernal horned god
Ave Satanas our infernal horned god
