[Music:  Lord Aeshma and Magus Dux Adramelech, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Agate, topaz, and garnet
Placed âpon stone altar grave
To glorify dark horns
âNeath frozen sphinxâs eye

Odium suscipere

Anthems of damnation,
Demons will come so fast
Food in the mouth of sacred cows
Occupare se in ornatu
Blessed by fire in a dance so macabre
Infernal dark veil upon the rot cross

Into the night we fly
To capture the Heavenâs angels
To get their blood and vitality
Mysticus Diabolus Oraculum
Into the night we fly
To capture the Heavenâs angels
To get their blood and vitality
Mysticus Diabolus Oraculum

Laudatus daemonium esse aethiopissa flamma
Gloriam dare niger dei natu in caelix rex imago

Legatus Diabolus

(Through the deathâs mirror I flew at burning Hell
Because I am the one who flies athwart the infinite
On the wings of Apocalypse
My ghastly face is feared as the burning flames
I am the one whose the name is a gloomiest whisper
I am the one who abominated the light
To worship the dark of cursed nights
And my snort scares all the pure souls
I am the Dark One)

Vanesco et inesco
Laedo draemon draco
Sat mortifer sic spuo
Phantasmaticus rapter regnare
Drupa jam saeve
Vel umbriefer frux hoc
Phlobatomatus em trabs
Satanas

For our infernal lord of darkness
Blood to glorify dark Satanâs horns

Into the night we fly
To capture the Heavenâs angels
To get their blood and vitality
Mysticus Diabolus Oraculum
