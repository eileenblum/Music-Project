[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

The eternal dark night came
Angelus
The infernal Satanâs powers rose
Archangelus
The graves to Christians are opened
Satanâs ghastly face is worshipped

Satanâs legions from darkness came
Demons flying athwart the infinite
Christians to ashes by Satanâs powers
Dark one master of the universe

Seraphim, Gloria in exelsis Diabolo
For I am Satan and all Universe screams

Gloria Diaboli

I am the power, I am the faith
I am the spirit, I am the pain
I am the sin, I am the lust
I am the fear, I am the Beast

Across the threshold of the eternity we fly
Against Christ and Heaven forever we fight
Demons with scythes aflame under a full moon
Waiting the infernal Satanâs empire

Seraphim, Gloria in exelsis Diabolo
For I am Satan and all Universe screams

I am the inferno
I am the bloodbaths
I am the cursed nights
I am the universe

Gloria Diaboli
