[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyric: Magus Dux Adramelech]

The black sword rises from the darkest Inferno
Archangelux regni semper

Lucifer king walks free on the Earth
With his beautiful and powerful demons army
The new age of darkness and destruction (again)
Angels that fallen like the Dark One
Shadows become the law on the ground
I shanât believe that Christ think be the Great
Oh, bastard Christ aims to please but heâs nothing
Satan master everywhere and everything

Nanque ut illa bestia
Scandit fatalis machine
Tacitae per silentia lunae
Fusi per moenia christiani conticuere

Oh, like a Daemonarchetypes
We are One with Satan (God)
Rain of blood with holy...cries

Bawl the satanic hymens of damnation
Battles with Christianâs blood covering the earth
The gateways are open like candles burning
Pyre the putrefaction smell on the purgatory
Death to the bastards together Christ (pig one)
Demons fly so high that they cannot see

Creation of unholy God
The satanic secrets have been found
Lucifera blast to boast oneâs success
Shadows burn the eyes, these days came
Through the lake of perverse fire
The Sun nevermore will shine
Black goat supreme lord
Darkest archangelux tormentorium dei

Fatis aperit Satanas futuris ora
Involvens umbra magna
In lignorum strues Satanae aut Mortis

Oh, like a Daemonarchetypes
We are One with Lucifer (God)
Rain blood with holy...cries

Lucifera blast to boast oneâs success
Through the lake of perverse fire
Creation of bestial Satan God
Our darkest Angel, supreme lord
Of darkness eternal.
