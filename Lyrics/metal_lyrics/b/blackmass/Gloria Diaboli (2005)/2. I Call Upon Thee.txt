[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyric: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Bloodfalls
With earthquakes damnation the ground
The Heaven came down
The Armageddon raise from the dead
In suicide places when the souls are lost
On the cross nailed soon will die
The Antichrist comes
In an eternal war against Christ weâll be forever
Lord of darkest flames,
Keeper of holy sin
Around the clouds become so dark and dense
Sunset and the Luna full with blood and pain
The stillborn has come
...Lucifer ...the Great...
I Call Upon Thee lord of the lords
In this cold night

As the shadows set in and chalice spill oâer blood
Satan warlord came to rule the Earth
Christians tremble before his cruelty and harshness
Master of night with hid wings cover us

I Call Upon Thee
War master from darkness
I Call Upon Thee
Lord of all Raven Beasts
I Call Upon Thee
I Call Upon Thee
God of destruction and pain
I Call Upon Thee
Satan (our) King
I Call Upon Thee...

Satanâs empire enfolded in darkest mist
To becomes vain Demon Lord
Poisoner the white world
The smell of putrid flesh carried by the air
The world of dead rose
In this suicide place

The Devil who has come from the dark fire lake
Earthquakes fucking the surface of this ground
Bats flying like demons waiting the final command
Dark throne finally will be lift up to reign forever

To call forth the dead angel thatâs fallen one
Envy inverse paradise hail Lucifer king

âTwixt the fire and ice that came from above
Fallen one the primal Evil our lord of Damn
From darkness to enslave all the Godâs creation
Our master spiteful tongue won the war

I Call Upon Thee
