[Music:  Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Vespertilionis

Downfall the white shattered glass heart
The infernal birth to another Hell on Earth
Tearing the white veil from the Christianâs grace
A fearful portrait inundated the soul

Poisoned henna on the flesh to cut the Heaven
Mystic creatures from the dark nights
The tribes of Christ will not forgive
Theyâll suffer enough to live on Earth

From the dark side
In origin of the eternal sin
Opaque crystal eyes of a fugitive god
That giving head
Died amongst the dirt
In midnightmare fit to dislike Christ like a vermin

Signum Deus Macabrum

Unholy gift from black circus of Satan
An anthropophagous father of your own son
The coming of great Satanâs empire

Guillotines and mantras from unbiblical midnightmare
An anthropophagous father of your own son
The coming of great Satanâs empire

Vespertilionis

Luciferi pater regis
Immitis natura strix
Broken glass cutting into flesh
Needles into eyes
Necrologies
