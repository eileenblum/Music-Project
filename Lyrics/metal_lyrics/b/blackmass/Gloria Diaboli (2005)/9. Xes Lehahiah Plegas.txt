[Music: Lord Aeshma, Lyrics: Magus Dux Adramelech]

Xes

Our father
Unholy Satan father
Thy flames are burning
Deep inside of my heart
Hail infernal
Lehahiah Plegas cultus
Demoniacal flames from Hell
On my eyes

Oh, Lucifer
Infernal goat of darkness
Thy horns are my pride
Thy flames are my weapons
Evil One, darkest lord of shadows
Infernal father of unholy ghosts
Xes umbrae perpetua
Codex Satanas

Xes Lehahiah Plegas

All the Christianâs hope is going to turn into dust
Beneath the moonâs eerie light we march on
Our father, infernal Satan father
Let thy darkest wings cover us

(Involvens Umbra Magna)

Let the divine tears of blood drench us all (in red)
And let us fly athwart the darkened infinite

Xes

Xes Lehahiah Plegas

Blood of the slaughtered Heavenâs angels
Within the infernal Satanâs vortex
The darkest flames are burning our hearts
Our infernal Lehahiah Plegas
Demoniacal flames from Hell
On my nostril
Deep inside of my soul
Hail eternal

Xes Lehahiah Plegas
