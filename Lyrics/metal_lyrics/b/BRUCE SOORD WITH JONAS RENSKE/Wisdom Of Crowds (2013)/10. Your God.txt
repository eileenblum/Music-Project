Give Him what you want
Go on and get on your knees and pray
Heaven knows I'm right
Heaven knows the things that I might say

Tell me to believe
You tell me everything that I should do
Give Him what you want
Advocate, I'll leave it all to you

Oh - your God, is He always there
to give to you? It just ain't fair
I think I might just need Him now
'Cause I'm so lost this time
Yes I'm so lost this time

Give you what you want
Yeah, I will get on my knees and pray
I'm guessing that you're right
I listen to the words you have to say

Teach me to believe
Teach me to believe the things you do
Heaven knows you're right
Heaven knows it's good enough for you

Oh - your God, is He always there to give to you?
It just ain't fair
I think I might just need Him now
'Cause I'm so lost this time
Yes I'm so lost this time

'Cause I'm so lost this time
Yes I'm so lost this time
