Look, look at the way it turns
The wind, nothing will make it learn
See the snow on its lonely ride
Watch, gently they all collide

Touch, place your hands on the frozen ground
Caress the eyes of this cold, cold land
Feel, there's nothing to feel any more
Numb, I'm bitterness to the core

Turning it back to me
Turning it back to you
Moving it back and forth
Stuck in the frozen north

Look, look at the way it burns
Nothing, nothing will make us learn
Feel, the grasp of my cold, cold hand
Alone, the eyes of this cold, cold land

Turning it back to me
Turning it back to you
Moving it back and forth
Stuck in the frozen north

Look, look at the way it turns
The wind, nothing will make it learn

Turning it back to me
Turning it back to you
Turning it back to me
Turning it back to you
Moving it back and forth
Stuck in the frozen north
