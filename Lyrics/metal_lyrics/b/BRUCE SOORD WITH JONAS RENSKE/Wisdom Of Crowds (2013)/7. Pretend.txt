I can't afford to live
I can't afford to take my chance
Looking at the ways
They're telling me to live in fear

To give it all again
I gave it all for nothing, yeah
Celebrate the truth
At least I fought to get us here

If anyone should ask
How the story goes
Just pretend we're almost there
Just pretend, pretend

Holding on for life
Holding on for one reason
Looking at the ways
Returning me for one last time

Celebrate the truth
At least I fought to get us here

If anyone should ask
How the story goes
Just pretend we're almost there
Just pretend
And when the wreckage breaks
We'll fall into below
Just pretend it's safe and warm
Just pretend, pretend
