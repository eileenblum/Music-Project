Darling, we had it all
The cold wind of the fall
Lie there in the leaves
They warm you in the breeze

Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways
Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways

You said, you said it hurts
The warm touch of feeling it first
Darling, we had it all
The kindness of the fall

Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways
Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways

Look at our ways
Look at how we suffer
Look at our ways
You swore you'd leave (look at our ways)
But it's only fair (look at how we suffer)
So darling please, (look at our ways)
Look at the ways (look at our ways)
We suffer alone (look at how we suffer)
The wisdom of crowds (look at our ways)
