I've got to kill this feeling
Got to get away
Got to give it something
Got to make it pay

Filling up with envy
Filling up with fear
Is this world so empty
That I am nothing here?

I've got to give a little love
I've got to buy a little trust tonight

Got to get me something
I've got to find my way
Is this world against me?
I've got to find an easy play

Why don't the numbers save me?
Is there a better game?
Before you all destroy me
I need a way to say

I've got to give a little love
Got to buy a little trust tonight

I am the Sun, I am the Moon
I am the day that broke too soon
Could give you the light, give you the stars
Give you a sign

I've got to kill this feeling
Got to get away
Got to give it something
Got to make it pay

Why don't the numbers save me?
Is there a better game?
Before you all destroy me
I need a way to say

I've got to give a little love
Got to buy a little trust tonight

I am the Sun, I am the Moon
I am the day that broke too soon
Could give you the light, give you the stars
Give you a sign

I am the Sun, I am the Moon
I am the day that broke too soon
Could give you the light, give you the stars
Give you a sign

I am the Sun, I am the Moon
I am the day that broke too soon
Could give you the light, give you the stars
Give you a sign

Could give you the light, give you the stars
Give you a sign...
