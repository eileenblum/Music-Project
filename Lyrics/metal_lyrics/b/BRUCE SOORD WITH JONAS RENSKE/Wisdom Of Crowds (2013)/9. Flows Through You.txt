You crawl to the very top
Yeah, we all saw it
Tell me what it's like for you
I'd love to feel it
'Cause I know what flows through you
It's cold and septic
The dead they flock to you
But they accept it

You've got so much to give
But I'll never see it
You've got enough to break me
And I'll never feel it
You think that before long
That I'll run the knife through
You think that I don't run
I'll fucking show you

I, I've got enough to take
That I am standing in your way
I can lose but I will never break
So dare you come around this time
And back it up
And leave it all behind

You think that I am next
But I'll never show you
You never see yourself
I'd love to make you
'Cause I know what flows through you
It's shit and empty
You think that I don't run
You never break me
