This is my life
And this is my friend
And I won't give up
Well not 'til the end

These are our fears
So hold out your hand
But I'm not sure here
What is the plan

All at once I see the truth is all around
I won't see me letting go of everything we've found

This is our life
And these are our days
And I love this air
That we both haven't saved

So these are our fears
Just keep them inside
We won't give in
And we will not die

All at once I see the truth is all around
I won't see me letting go of everything we've found

This is my life
And you are my friend
And we won't give up
Well not 'til the end

So these are our fears
Just keep them inside
We won't give in
And we will not die
We will not die

These are our fears
So hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand
Hold out your hand...
