Take me to the light
And show me what's inside
Come play with me
And make me how you like
If there's one thing that you know
It's I will never go
'Cause I love you more
More than I thought I might

So my child, well I will never leave you tonight
Open up your eyes and let them weep
Sinful as I am, please take my hand
And let us lose our cares for life

It's hopeless here I know
But hopeless we will go
Into the days
The days that drop like flies
If there's one thing you should know
The last day we will go
Into the dark with nothing left inside

So my child, well I will never leave you tonight
Open up your eyes and let them weep
Sinful as I am, please take my hand
And let us lose our cares for life

So my child, well I will never leave you tonight
Open up your eyes and let them weep
Sinful as I am, please take my hand
And let us lose our cares for life
