Don't say you have left me
Don't say it's true
Don't say that I am without you
I guess I'm going
I'm going astray
You were the one that got away
But I say

I just can't believe it's true
That I am here without you
I hear you calling out my name
But I keep going on

Don't say you have left me
Don't say it's true
There is no life here without you
But I kept on going
Going astray
And I beg for that final day
But I say

I just can't believe it's true
That I am here without you
I hear you calling out my name
But I keep going on

They tell me it's for you
They tell me that I'll pull through
But I won't beg 'cause I know you're gone
Gone, gone, gone...

I just can't believe it's true
That I am here without you
I hear you calling out my name
But I keep going on
