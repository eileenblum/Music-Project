I am your reason
I break your fall
I am your pleasure
I taste your soul

You want for nothing
I have it all
I give you pleasure
And so you will know

Thank me for mercy
I'll keep the flame
Get on your knees now
I'll show you pain

Thank me for meaning
I am your world
I am your pleasure
And so you will know

There's a cure in my pocket that I'm saving for a special day
There's a cure in my pocket that will make it all just go away

Can you hear me calling?
Can you see me falling?
Can you feel me hurting
In your mind?
I can tell this feeling
The pleasure is demeaning
But I know there's nothing
In your mind

Thank me for meaning
I am your world
I am your pleasure
And so you will know

There's a cure in my pocket that I'm saving for a special day
There's a cure in my pocket that will make it all just go away

Can you hear me calling?
Can you see me falling?
Can you feel me hurting
In your mind?
I can tell this feeling
The pleasure is demeaning
But I know there's nothing
In your mind
