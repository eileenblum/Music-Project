There unfolds
The largest scale
Battle ever seen in centuries
Human clans
Ready to die
They will now be
Clearly outnumbered

General Zed
And his armies
Heading for the Citadel
Wiping out all resistance
With the aid of his
GloMutants

A second attack will be
Headed by Clans of Immortals
The Mountain of Glass will soon be conquered
Moment of truth is just
Waiting to happen again
Our great victory) will last forever

By the Powers of White Light
A freedom call for all
We'll live towards another day in Heaven
Through the Magic of the Spheres
The message is so clear
Defeat the unrelenting March of Darkness!

In the darkness
Of the void
Whispered secret incantations
To revive
The long forgotten dark and
Evil force of Rothwind

From the Realms of the Dead
Now awakened for destruction
The only One
To change the Plan
Kill the Keepers
Take their Power

On the ninth morning the Seal will be
Broken for all to see
Call of the Angels will bring Power
Thousands will fall it is written
For Freedom of Mankind
Deliverance for Defenders of the Faith

By the Powers of White Light
A freedom call for all
We'll live towards another day in Heaven
Through the Magic of the Spheres
The message is so clear
Defeat the unrelenting March of Darkness!

[Guitar solos]

"â¦a Conquest of V Decades shall pass over the Lands and many will fall under the blood red skies. Scores shall pass out as the voices are heard calling His name, spreading His word, delivering all evil unto man and the Clansâ¦and the Heavens will spread the Word, His Wordâ¦"

[Guitar solos (continued)]

By the Powers of White Light
A freedom call for all
We'll fight towards another day in Heaven
Through the Magic of the Spheres
The message is so clear
Defeat the unrelenting Tides of Darkness!

By the Powers of White Light
A freedom call for all
We'll fight towards another day in Heaven
Through the Magic of the Spheres
The message is so clear
Defeat the unrelenting Tides of Darkness!
