Now that the time has come
In Snadeton â the Land of Horiulle
Humans now emerge from
Long years of chaos

Morale's at an all-time low
A series of bloody battles
Wars of the Continents
Have marked all our lives

Blackened skies on a cloudless horizon
The tension mounts among the lower class clans
Heading towards a new moment in our lives
Unsure of our destiny as we march on andâ¦

A long dark path lies ahead
Fear around of the unknown grows stronger
Beholds the trouble within
A future uncertain
As darkness lurks deep from inside

A sense of dÃ©jÃ -vu
Mankind's still waging battles
The reign of the Robot Clans
An age of unrest

Time is passing by
Long years, months, days and hours
Endless suffering
There's nowhere to hide!

[Instrumental bridge]

Winds of Destruction now blow
A dark age will dawn when all
False Robot Rulers will
Rise and control our lives
The future's uncertain
In darkness and shadow
We'll die

[Guitar solo]

[Instrumental bridge]

Winds of Destruction now blow
A dark age will dawn when all
False Robot Rulers will
Rise and control our lives
The future's uncertain
In darkness and shadow
We'll die

Winds of Destruction now blow
A dark age will dawn when all
False Robot Rulers will
Rise and control our lives
The future's uncertain
In darkness and shadow
We'll die
