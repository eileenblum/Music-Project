The Conquest of V Decades
Has ended a few years back and
Lord Jackson Trukx has devised
An evil devious plan that

Will end all past and present
Fighting among all humans
A silent scheme kept secret
With a few human lives lost

An event for mankind that will bring the end of time
The past and the present will be lost for all

Electro-spectral wipe-out
A blackened life emerges
Future communication â it's the end now
There's no freedom

The plan is final and the people live in fear
The race is over now â the end of time will soon be here

[Instrumental bridge]

Now the
End soon will be here
There's nowhere left to hide
We're all gonna die by tomorrow
Our lives will be gone
A deadly master plan that knows no bounds for the future
Crushing the spirit and power within
Now we die!

[Guitar solo]

[Instrumental bridge]

Now the
End soon will be here
There's nowhere left to hide
We're all gonna die by tomorrow
Our lives will be gone
A deadly master plan that knows no bounds for the future
Crushing the spirit and power within
Now we die!
