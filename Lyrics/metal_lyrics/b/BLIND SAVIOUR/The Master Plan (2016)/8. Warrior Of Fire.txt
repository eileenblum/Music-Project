For the first time in years
The scanners picked up higher levels of human unrest
Something's clearly not right
And the orders are given to break up the incoming tribes

Led by new blood and our faith
We will hail Blind Saviour
To the outer walls we all march and
Make our stand

Heading for the Mountain of Glass
The lower clan armies now muster their courage and strength
The robot oppressors attack
And the first heavy clashes take place in the city at dawn

Led by young blood and new faith
We now hail Blind Saviour
To the castle walls we will march
And forever

Fight against the Legions of this Earth	
Spreading word 'gainst the empire
He's the Chosen One â a Saviour and Warrior of Fire
Through the lands 'cross space and time
Out of darkness born of fire
A new hope for humankind
For the years to come

[Guitar solos]

Fight against the Legions of this Earth	
Spreading word 'gainst the empire
He's the Chosen One â a Saviour and Warrior of Fire
Out of shadows of this earth
From all darkness born of fire

A new light through space and time
riding 'cross wasted lands
Fighting for our future world
Assaulting systems of the empire
Heading for a life of hope 'neath these metal skies
