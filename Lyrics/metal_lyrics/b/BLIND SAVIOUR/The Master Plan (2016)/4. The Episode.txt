It's four in
The morning
On a moonless early winter's day
The city's sound asleep
And no one roams the streets

Unbeknownst to the world outside
It's too late!
The countdown has just begun

Three abandoned airbases
Some final checks are carried out
Lord Trukx's Special Forces
Will bring the end of time

Time won't go on
There is no more turning back
On the Episode

Three loud blasts that rip right through the Lands
A light so bright turning night into day
Fire and heat that rage across the desert plains
Burning Snadeton-on-Thys

Awakened by tremors they now watch the sky
The people, in fear can't understand why
The sands of time now hail the Years of None
There is no more turning back

[Interlude]

Slow Interlude
In the eye of the storm
There's a quiet that fills our world
There within lies our fate
A dark age â the Years of None

Long to be free of pain
There is nowhere to go
There is just one path
Ahead of usâ¦

[Guitar solo]


Now that the Years of None are here â
It's the start of the Episode
And it's all part of the Master Plan â
There's nothing we can do

No one living here will ever â
See the light of day
No one can go back in time â
Hell bent to repay

Forced to hide in the labyrinths
to escape the evil clans
Seeking refuge from the Wars â
We're left alone in fear

Struggling through the mangled remains â
To survive another day
Nameless, faceless clansmen â
Defenders of the faith

[Guitar solo]
