Time has come
To be breeching the walls
Launch a final attack
On the Mountain of Glass
Now the old Seer
Shifting all of his powers
To find that one weak point
In the enemy lines

Wasting the evil armies
Order of Wyvern striking fear
Keepers now set upon them
Crushed by the magic of the spheres

Led by one vision
To final victory
Forever united
Defeating our sworn enemies
Killing all
Across the green valleys
There lies our destiny
The Powers of White Light
Will unite us eternally
For evermore

[Instrumental interlude]

Vocal
Led by the Seers the armies of mankind
Storm the Portals of Four Winds
Final attack that crushes all evil
And destroys all resistance

The dark wizard Sgraenor
Fights the Blind Saviour
on the high castle walls
One reason to live, one reason to die
One whole lifetime to kill the pain

After this battle's won
There's a new hope for us all
We will be there one day, I know
And that day's not too far!

[Narration:]
"I have seen the ill effects brought on by the evil that lurks in darkness as it spreads like disease, leaving its trail of decay in the wasting fabric of the cosmic dimension. Fear it is said will lay mankind to rest, but until then it is through determination and courage alone that humankind can defeat true evilâ¦"

[Guitar solo 4]

One final victory
Dead are all enemies
The struggle is over
And gone are all nightmares at last
Laid to rest
Somewhere on the other side
A wasted exiled tyrant hides
Gone are the Robot Rulers of our dark past
Forever gone!

On the horizon
There where the eagles soar
One crimson sunset that fills the clear skies
With new hope
At last the end
Far 'cross the Wastelands
In exile lies the enemy
Gone are his powers
Alone he must face his dark end
His dark end!

One final victory
Dead are all enemies
The struggle is over
And gone are all nightmares at last
Laid to rest
Somewhere on the other side
A wasted exiled tyrant hides
Gone are the Robot Rulers of our dark past
Forever gone!

On the horizon
There where the eagles soar
One crimson sunset that fills the clear skies
With new hope
At last the end
Far 'cross the Wastelands
In exile lies the enemy
Gone are his powers
Alone he must face his dark end
His dark end!
