In the subterranean
Labyrinths beneath the city
There's an old mysterious figure
Who will bring about a resurrection
A founder of the Order, it's
The secret Order of the Wyvern
Leaves Glass Mountain City to
Elude the evil machine rulers

He will bring us new hope for humankind
A chance to fight back â Destroy the Robot Clans

Yearning for freedom
A new resurrection
We pray for a new dawn
Leaving the darkness
Defying all tyrants
A dawn of victory

Deep in secret the wise seer
Claims that there's a brighter future
A young child that he's adopted
A well-kept secret never told
Driven by an inner anger
He's the one â the chosen one
A worthy rival to the Robot
Rulers of the world

An oath is taken to fight the Robot Wars
Slaying rulers â The change has just begun

Yearning for freedom
A new resurrection
We pray for a new dawn
Leaving the darkness
Defying all tyrants
A dawn of victory

[Interlude]

[Guitar solos]

Yearning for freedom
A new resurrection
We pray for a new dawn
Leaving the darkness
Defying all tyrants
A dawn of victory
