In the morning
Daylight reveals
A desert, new world
With nothing around
The end of time has
Changed life for all of us
A mute scorched world
Where nothing remains

Waiting for death
A few clan survivors now realise
Time has just failed
A future world
With darkness and disorder
Among all clans
The chaos and pain

No one will ever see the light of day -
A chaos that freezes the sands of time today -
No one here can believe the things you say â
Against all odds and trying to find a way -
