Plans are drawn up
To rebuild
Our lives again
Our backs to the wall
We will struggle
To fight and carry on

Life's about to change
Quest for Blue Light
Darkness no longer
A constant reminder
Leaving the depths
Shadows draw back
On this forsaken world
Rife with confusion

The world we are living in is heading for ruin
There â lies ahead our future in balance
Hanging by a thread â we are living in chaos
Pain everywhere and Death's chilling glance on the lands

Quest for
Blue Light is a matter
Of life and death
A powerful source
That will win us
The battle one day

Heed now
There is no turning back
Gonna leave it behind
There is no point in running
For cover

The world we are living in is heading for ruin
There â lies ahead our future in balance
Hanging by a thread â we are living in chaos
Pain everywhere and Death's chilling glance on the lands

[Guitar solos]

Heed now
There is no turning back
Gonna leave it behind
There is no point in running
For cover

The world we are living in is heading for ruin
There â lies ahead our future in balance
Hanging by a thread â we are living in chaos
Pain everywhere and Death's chilling glance on the lands
