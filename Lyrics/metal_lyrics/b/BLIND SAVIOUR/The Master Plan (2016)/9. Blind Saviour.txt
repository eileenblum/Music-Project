Abandoned at childbirth
And raised by a seer
A blind man turned rebel
The hit man of fear

The voices have spoken
Now hailing his courage
His moment of glory is near

The meeting's all over
The plan has been chosen
A war will be waged and
The Clans will be broken the

Six Crystal Spheres
Lie deep in the Mountain
Protected by Keepers
The Way of White Light

Guided by the Powers of White Light
Towards eternal glory
Revealing the truth now behind his mask
Hail! Blind Saviour!
Guided by the Powers of White Light
Heading towards our glory
Unleashing all Hell on this earth's destiny

Determined to fight back
And guided by anger
Unleash all his fury
And wipe out the clansmen

He cuts through the field now
Alone in the courtyard
Destroying the enemy lines

His mission's accomplished
Six Crystals are ours
The Keepers united
Behold all their powers

Go back to camp now
And join with thy father
Unite with the Keepers
And glory to all

Guided by the Powers of White Light
Towards eternal glory
Revealing the truth now behind his mask
Fight for freedom!
Guided by the Powers of White Light
Heading towards our glory
Unleashing all Hell on this earth's destiny

Heading towards our glory
Unleashing all Hell on this earth's destiny

Guided by the Powers of White Light
Towards eternal glory
Revealing the truth now behind his mask
Fight for freedom!
Guided by the Powers of White Light
Heading towards our glory
Unleashing all Hell on this earth's destiny
