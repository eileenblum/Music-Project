What is this madness that's burning in my head?
The panic inside is so hard to bear
Their voices call upon me, an enemy within

In this cold and senseless world
There's no place for me
I'm helpless and feeling so lost

How I bleed
I hide my inner scars
No one knows that I suffer in silence

The darkness in me is poisoning my mind
It feels like I'm a stranger to myself
The reflection in the mirror, a man I thought I knew

On the edge of sanity
Fragile and alone
How much more I can take?

How I bleed
I hide my inner scars
No one knows that I suffer in silence
End this pain
End this agony
Silent screaming
My cries are in despair

Standing on a ledge
I've reached a point of no return

How I bleed
I hide my inner scars
No one knows that I suffer in silence
End this pain
End this agony
Silent screaming
My cries are in despair
