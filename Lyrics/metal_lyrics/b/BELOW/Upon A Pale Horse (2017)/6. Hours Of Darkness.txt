Trembling roar of thunder
Echoes through the mist
A storm is coming our way
Bolts of lightning across the skies
Precious day turns into night

Mother earth is bleeding
She is crying out in pain
We've abused her for too long
Nothing will ever be the same
Eternal night when darkness reigns

The raven flies

From below comes retribution
A vengeance from within
The time is here for nature's revenge
Misery will be brought upon us
Mankind will suffer for our deeds
The hours of darkness has come

Ancient sleeping evil
Awakens once again
Rises to the ground above
A world in ruins and decay
Mark my words, this is the end

The storm draws near

From below comes retribution
A vengeance from within
The time is here for nature's revenge
Misery will be brought upon us
Mankind will suffer for our deeds
The hours of darkness has come
