What's going on behind closed doors?
So many secrets to unveil
The faceless masters pulling strings
We're like beggars at their feet

In the halls of ultimate power
The liars feed on the poor
The principle of society's structures
Has always been to support the elite

Our denial
Is foolish and naive
So easily led
Their betrayal
They bite the hand that feeds
But blind we follow

Our children will inherit the earth
A dying world is what we'll leave
Open up your eyes and see
The hypocrisy that lives and thrives

Our denial
Is foolish and naive
So easily led
Their betrayal
They bite the hand that feeds
But blind we follow

We are all just slaves that serve
At the temple of mammon and greed
We are pawns in twisted games
Of corruption and fear

I was born to be controlled
You were born to be controlled
We are born to be controlled
I was born to be controlled
