Like the weight of 1000 broken bones
Her heart is burdensome and bleeding
Sickness invades her dark and twisted mind
Will insanity break out?

A fear of the judgement she will face
Regretting deeds but all in vain
And now her terrified prayers and cries
Shatter the silence of the night

Darkness will take her fragile soul
There is no turning back

Hope fades away
All faith is gone
Your angel's dying
Beneath these dark skies

She's slowly crawling on her knees and cries
A veil of blood covers the trees
Deprived of light she accepts her fate
The sun goes down, her end is here

Stained in tears and in blood
Smeared in dirt as she crawls

Hope fades away
All faith is gone
Your angel's dying
Beneath these dark skies
