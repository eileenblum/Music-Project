On this fateful evening the mist lies thick on the ground
The moon is full and the trees reach for the sky
The black veil of the night embraces my soul
I feel a strange magic is beckoning me from beyond

I'm drawn to a place
Of witchcraft and evil

All around me the shadows dance with the dead
Their bodies twisting and turning in abnormal ways
Chanting in trance, speaking their unholy prayers
Like a puppet on string I obey their every command

I'm under a spell
At a witches coven

They say the devil is here with us tonight
In this ritual of blood and fire
In ecstasy I dance with tears in my eyes
Give in to darkness and let go
Kiss the lord below

Waking up with a scream from a twisted dream
My body's aching, got bruises and cuts on my skin
The blood in my veins running cold as I realize
That I'll wear the mark of the beast for eternity
