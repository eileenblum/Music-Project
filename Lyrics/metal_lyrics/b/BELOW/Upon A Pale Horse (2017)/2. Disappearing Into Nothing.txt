Hopeless
I lie awake alone, afraid and scarred
Black are my thoughts
Let me
Rest my tired eyes and drift away
Into eternal sleep

My body, numb and weary
My soul, it fades away
Disappearing into nothing
Death is always present
Now toll the final bell

Nothing
Seems to matter anymore
I've lost the fire and the flame
Torn
There's no cure, no hope
I face the truth
And meet my destiny

My body, numb and weary
My soul, it fades away
Disappearing into nothing
Death is always present
Now toll the final bell

A plague I bear within
The anguish and the fear
A sickness grows inside
My time is running out

As I
Take my last breath in this life
I leave my agony behind
Released and free
From this nightmare
As a journey ends
A new one begins

My body, numb and weary
My soul, it fades away
Disappearing into nothing
As the reaper's soaring
He tolls the final bell
