Behold, our world will burn
To ashes regress
Inescapable judgement will come
The reckoning day

The horsemen bring conquest and war
Famine and death
Damnation is now at hand
With the fourth seal

When the world is at end
The wormwood star is falling down
Through a crack in the sky
Death appears upon a pale horse

Abaddon, the locust king
Summons his horde
The bottomless pit he reigns
The realm of the dead

When the world is at end
The wormwood star is falling down
Through a crack in the sky
Death appears upon a pale horse

The seventh seal is open
The angels blow their horns
The sound of seven trumpets
Prelude the end of time

Behold, our world is doomed
To parish in flames
The reckoning day is here
Time to repent

When the world is at end
The wormwood star is falling down
Through a crack in the sky
Death appears upon a pale horse
