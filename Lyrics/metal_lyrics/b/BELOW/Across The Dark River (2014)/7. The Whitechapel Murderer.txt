The alleys lie silent and calm
Dusk is beginning to fall
Dense is the fog in the air
It's here I'm searching my prey

I'm from hell
I'll come for you

You're unaware of my presence
As I'm lurking behind
I am the shadow you fear
I am the steps closing in

This fateful evening, blood will be shed
My knife is sharp and so is my mind

I cut you up
Washing away all your filth
I take your life
Making you free from sin

The bells are chiming for you
Cause this is your final day
Roaming the alleys at night
These streets belong to me

The Whitechapel murderer I'm called
Who'll be my next sacrifice?
Am I a savior or a pig
Are you the ones to decide?

This fateful evening
Blood will be shed
I'll be a legend
As I take your life

I cut you up
Washing away all your filth
I take your life
Making you free from sin
