Midnight hour
The tolling of the bell
Echoes over these forsaken lands

Haunting whispers
A gathering of souls
Faceless figures are slowly rising

Shadows moving
Silent in moonlight
Seems like this graveyard comes to life

Into darkness
They're marching one by one
Are they dead or still alive?

Deep in the woods
Wicked silhouettes
Circle of ghouls
A portal to the dead

Spirits summoned
Around the dancing flames
Opened a gateway down below

Dark illusions
I can't believe my eyes
But I know what I just saw

Deep in the woods
Wicked silhouettes
Circle of ghouls
A portal to the dead
