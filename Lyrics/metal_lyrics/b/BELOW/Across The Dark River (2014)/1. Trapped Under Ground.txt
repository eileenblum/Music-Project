Wake up alone in the darkness
Praying that this is a dream
Coldness surrounds me in silence
It's harder and harder to breathe

I find myself in a casket
I scream and I scratch to get out
Trying to bring back the memories
How did I end up in here?

Is this how I cease to be?
So this is the bitter end?
Panic spreads in my body
No one answers my cries

Buried alive
Trapped under ground
The walls are closing in

Buried alive
Trapped under ground

Taking farewell of the life I had
Oh Father, take me home
No one is here as I fade away
Open the gates for me

Gathering all of my strength now
The last try to brake my way out
The walls are getting closer and closer
My hope is slowly dying with me

Buried alive
Trapped under ground
The walls are closing in
Buried alive
Trapped under ground
