The air is cold
The sky is clear
Frost covers the soil
Autumn came
And took you away
Leaving nothing but pain

Oh, how cruel life can be
The grief is slowly killing me

In despair we bid you farewell on this day
In my heart you will live
On though you're gone

We're here to take
A last goodbye
In the heart of October
To pray, to cry
Can't bring you back
And it's hard to accept

Leafs wither and die
Under autumn skies

In despair we bid you farewell on this day
In my heart you will live
On though you're gone
