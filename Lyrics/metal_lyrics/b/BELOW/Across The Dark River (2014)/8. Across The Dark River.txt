I take you on my vessel
And carry you across
This dark and raging river
To distant shores

This is your final journey
But don't forget to pay
A coin under your tongue
Is enough for me
A ferryman's fee

Those who cannot pay me
Will not reach their goal
They'll forever wander
Aimlessly

Black rocks mark the shoreline
Of eternity
A place where you can enter
But never leave

The hound of hell awaits you
Three-headed is the beast
The guardian at the gates of
The underworld

Farewell my passenger
My work here is done
I leave you in the hands of
My master
