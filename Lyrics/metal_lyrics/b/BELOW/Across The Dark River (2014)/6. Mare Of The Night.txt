Lying awake in the dark
I'm afraid to fall asleep
A scratching sound in the walls
A cold breeze under the door

In my dreams
Mare of the night
Have mercy
Save my soul

I feel a presence in my room
A creature is reaching for me
Something is entering my bed
A demon sits upon my chest

In my dreams
Mare of the night
Have mercy
Save my soul

What causes these weird nightmares
These dreams of dying?
Unwanted, uninvited
But still it's there

I suffocate every night
So hard to breathe
What is this evil presence?
I wake up screaming
