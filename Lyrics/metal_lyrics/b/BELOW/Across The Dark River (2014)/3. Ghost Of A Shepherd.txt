Now listen closely
I will tell you a tale
About a shepherd who
Lived here long ago
One day he heard the sweetest voice
Call upon him from an ancient well

As he leaned over and
Gazed into the deep
Something grasped for him and
Pulled him down the well

A watery grave
He sank to his doom
His spirit lived on
It's haunting this place

An apparition, the shepherd
Has been seen
Sometimes when fullmoon
You still can hear him scream
Searching for his long lost herd
The wails in torment from the pit below

Fallen in shadows
Swallowed into black
A soul in agony
Never to find peace

A watery grave
He sank to his doom
His spirit lived on
It's haunting this place
