Ilona the porn star
Had been elected
The greatest surprise
Of our last suffrage
Thousands of maniacs
Voted for her
Cause they were disappointed
After brothel repression

[Chorus:]
Tonight! The witch has been recalled
Returned to shock the world
Disgrace! There was no control
Italy "the shame"!

She replied: "I'm not a shame"
"If you compare me with other"
"Parliament's members who are known to be"
"Thieves and merchants of death"
"Criminals"
"Hypocritists"
"Drug sellers"
She'll never die

All TV news
From Japan to the States
Reported the event
Never happened before
Magazines and papers
Did not deny
Two of three pages
To the scandal of the year

[Chorus:]
Tonight! The witch has been recalled
Returned to shock the world
Disgrace! There was no control
Italy "the shame"!

Now she sells thousands copies
Of her last productions (the last with John Holmes)
It seems she doesn't care
About the money she get
She's a witch
She's a star
She's the big
She'll never die

She has got a lot of enemies
Like all the witches
Burnt and persecuted
In the past
She's alive
Got several names
But the spirit inside
Is always the same

[Chorus:]
Tonight! The witch has been recalled
Returned to shock the world
Disgrace! There was no control
Italy "the shame"!

The man living with her
Died of AIDS just few weeks ago
She's persecuted by fate
She never surrenders, she loves sex
No protect
No prevent
No plastic
She'll never die
