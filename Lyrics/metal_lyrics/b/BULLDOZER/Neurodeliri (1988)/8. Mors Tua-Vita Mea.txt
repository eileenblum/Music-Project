Rule of mother nature is killing to survive
That's why ancient romans did not justify
Their cruel and violent everyday style of life
No excuse for their bloody sacrifice

Christian age meant the desappearance of this
Noble saying, substituted by frauds

New mentality came from pharesees
It will terminate the life of roman eve
Worst hypocrisy especially with poors and blacks
False democracy hidden beside their flag

Charity couldn't hide their aggressive aims
Jesuits saved their dirty face
