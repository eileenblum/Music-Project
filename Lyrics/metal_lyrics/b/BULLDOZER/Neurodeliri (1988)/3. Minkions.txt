The hall has been crowded, they are checking the lights
A gaggle of children excited tonight
I'm drunk, I'm bored , I don't want to stay

Babies and chicks, who's making that noise?
The sound of a roost, I don't hear a voice
Cackle gets loud, the band's gonna play

Looking to the stage I see some "Minkions" dancing
I drain another beer... I don't like their cool faces
They play the rotten guys, they are just "cool" and "romantic"
A good fraud for the fans who seek the "look neglected"

Here Minkions
Here you got: Minkions
You can touch: Minkions
You can love: Minkions, Minkions' band!

The show is very boirng , I just want to sleep
While babies together are singing their hit
The sound of a church, I listen.... they pray

Worship the Minkions, their gods for tonight
Moshin' new fashion, they play the rough fight
Minkions agree, that's their good way

Gig's near to the end, that's gonna stop my nightmare
Groopies are gettin' wet, they are moving to the backstage
Minkions are too tired, the roadies substitute them
Their manager decides, they cannot touch their fan girls

There: Minkions
There they sleep: Minkions
You can't touch: Minkions
You can't love: Minkions
You can't get: Minkions
You can't see: Minkions
Cause they sleep: Minkions
Cause they are: Minkions

MINKIONS BAND!
