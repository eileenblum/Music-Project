Three mental insanes, not screaming for fear
Created a new band "Neurodeliri"
Totally ignored, played for themselves
The fate will deny them fame

Filled by desperation
Another fallen angel's suicide

[Chorus:]
NEURODELIRI
NEURODELIRI

The had no friends, refused by the girls
They had to live alone, going adrift
Unlucky jailbirds, they couldn't escape
And spent all their money for playing

Persecuted by misfortune
Sad but proud till the end

[Chorus:]
NEURODELIRI
NEURODELIRI

Nobody knows the song they recorded
Nobody felt their madness
Today is too late, the leader has left
This meaningless world forever

Filled by desperation
Sad but proud till the end
