Yesterday said be felt pain in his head
Now he's too nervous, he's stiff in his bed
One day he's drunk, another is tired
He fails all days: he must be impotent
She feels disdain or maybe compassion
It doesn't matter the kind of reaction
She won't forgive him, she won't try again
Cause he fails all days: he must be impotent

He cannot simmulate
Like her: she's so safe
He must proove the truth
No bullshit, no excuse

[Chorus:]
Failed stallion, where's your strenght?
Are you pretty? Are you tall?
It makes no difference, you are condemned
Cause you are: "Mezza sega"
Failed stallion you are lost
Your pride and your good fame
She won, then she said
You are: "Mezza sega"

Too many troubles I see in the facts
The bad situation when she rejects
You've gotta find out a way to be great
The italian men remained with no strenght
Know a good trick, I'm not gonna tell
They have no problems, they know how to move
And girl will return: I can swear she's satisfied

Just ask Cicciolina
She will show you the way
You'll be full of women
And you won't remain a

[Chorus:]
Failed stallion, where's your strenght?
Are you pretty? Are you tall?
It makes no difference, you are condemned
Cause you are: "Mezza sega"
Failed stallion you are lost
Your pride and your good fame
She won, then she said
You are: "Mezza sega"
