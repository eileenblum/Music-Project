The members of this fuckin' band
Fell into disgrace
We were all persuaded
We were born in the wrong place
We were not born to lose
But we must live here
In this fuckin' sunny country
We will never see around
Blond girls to chase as well
Tall girls with big tits
We don't like the nice colours
We don't like the black hairs
But the italian squat girls
Pretend to be like madonna
And they are looking so disgusting
We are gonna puke in their face

Red wine
Only remained
To spend a good time
Living this place
Being exiled
That's how we feel
We have to admit it
We are..... italian

When the summer time comes
Turists come to visit
Something like ten years ago
Blond girls came alone
All the dirty shaggy stallions
Were ready to attack
Now you find them everywhere
Fuck Off!
False romantic and disgusting
They pollute our land
Everytime we go abroad
We are considered like them
Can't avoid to be confused
Can't avoid to be refused
But I think today it's too late
All this shit will remain

Fool man
Reading this song
You won't understand
I'm laughin' alone
Cause this fuckin' place
Maybe it's the best
I like to admit it
We are..... italian
