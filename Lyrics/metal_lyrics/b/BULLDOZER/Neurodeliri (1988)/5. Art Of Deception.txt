The great deceiver related before
Could be "the man who saves"
For every man and every group
He has got a lot of different namens

[Chorus:]
Blind till death
Art of deception prevails
Man do accept
All the baits they have to reject

You can recognize him, by his behaviour
He doesn't let people choose
But in the end you can easily realize
This bastard will never die

[Chorus:]
Blind till death
Art of deception prevails
Man do accept
All the baits they have to reject
