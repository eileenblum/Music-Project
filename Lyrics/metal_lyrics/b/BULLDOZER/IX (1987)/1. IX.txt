That's my place I found it
this is my life I love it
finally we are all together
finally we do feel much better
My brothers will stick around me
we'll live united and see
the world finally dead
"the master has lost his pet"
(We are) really delighted (we) provoked the disaster
we look satisfied at the ruins of the master 'cause
we do hate gods!
We never liked creatures we never liked Crowley
we hated men's guts they are fuckin' betrayers
(then) we claimed: stake!
The bastards predicted our rout
that was the wish of their gods
our power refused their slaves
we just lived by the graves
Religions called us demons
because we looked for freedom
we hated the saints and their lies
we made the virgin cry
(We are) really delighted (we) provoked the disaster
we look satisfied at the ruins of the master 'cause
we do hate gods!
We never liked creatures we never liked Crowley
we hated men's guts they are fuckin' betrayers
(then) we claimed: stake!
(We are) really delighted (we) provoked the disaster
we look satisfied at the ruins of the master 'cause
we do hate gods!
We never liked creatures we never liked Crowley
we hated men's guts they are fuckin' betrayers
(then) we claimed: stake!
