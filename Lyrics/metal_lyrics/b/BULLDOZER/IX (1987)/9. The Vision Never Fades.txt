A couple of years ago
a vision turned me on
no way! it was not a dream
it was something I've never seen
It was not confused
it was not to lose
It was fuckin' grateful 'cause
they came to visit (me) in my room
I'm not a black magician
I've never called the damned
I'm not the fool who plays
like children with false evil ways
They came to me
and they let me see
It was fuckin' grateful 'cause
they came to visit (me) in my room
