Milan!
Let the violence live
don't listen to the preachers
let the riot take place
let the knives cut
Hatred!
Christianity repressed gladiators
and terraces became the new rings
holocaust!
the Derby claims
Milan!
TV condemned the events
the prime minister cries
but she likes the police's repression
against the hooligans disperated
Hatred!
The Romans had been forgotten
but terraces became the new rings
holocaust!
the Derby claims
