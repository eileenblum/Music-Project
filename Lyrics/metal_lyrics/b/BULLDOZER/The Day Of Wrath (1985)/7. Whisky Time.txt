Every night in a different pub
Get the money, the night's long
Let's begin with some beer
And then drink something strong
That's a fucking place
the girls here look so bad
We'd better change pub
These fucking people makes me sad

Come on let's go to the 'strip'
Looking for red shinning lips
(if) I don't get fucked never mind
We are ready to start
It's whisky time

The black girl is dancing
She is fatty and shaggy
And she's got big tits
There is nothing laggin'
She's moving her ass
Along a white chair
She makes me so hungry
"Show me your holes"

The girl has gone
Another show we are waiting for
A new one has entered
But she's at least forty years old
She's not so good and I shout:
"Come on move your ass!"
She tries to smile but
I know she didn't like it
