I'm a demon of dread
I've got the twisted head
My mind does it spin
From a creature within
Living my life
With this strange human flesh
I'll only start living
After my so called death

Mad man
Through my brain it is spread
Time and again it's been said

Demons, creatures
Listen to me
I don't wanna be
The same fucking freak

I'm filled with pain
They are trying to make me sane
I'm screaming with fear
But no one will hear
People talk
but who knows what they speak
Running in circles
Like a maniac freak

Demons, creatures
Listen to me
I wanna set free
My soul from this pit
