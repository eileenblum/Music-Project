One life here
One soul there
I'm bored with living
I don't even care
Suck up their brain
Rip out their heart
Spit in their eyes
I'm known from the start

We are just cut-throat
We are just cut-throat
Worshipping sin
We are just cut-throat

Off with my head
I'm gonna be dead
In the shadows I hide
Absorbing the black
I'd stick your own mother
With a knife in her back
Move your ass
Get out the lead

I'm seeking revenge
from a pleasure within
The victims in sight
The aim is right
You know I sit
high on my throne
And the throat I will cut
Will right be your own
