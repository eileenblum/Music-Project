Welcome all you fuckers
Freak-out and mortal fools
Seeking evil excitements
Yeah! You want to be cool
And I'm still laughing
Watching you and your foolish ways
Don't try to move around me now
I'm gonna hold your chain forever

You don't realize I'm - The great deceiver
Turn off the light - You'll hear my breath
Don't joke with me - I'm not a believer
You won't refuse - The Diver-lover

Trust me, trust me
I'll save you from your pain
I'm fucking lying
You'll be my slave

I've got the key of the abyss
And a great chain in my hand
(Beside me) Out thousand harlots
Yeah! My only friends
If you want a great sign
Stay calm, you want wait no more
You are on your way
Just to be a rotten whore

Love me, love me
Welcome me with open legs
I'm always ready
No need to beg
