Welcome in my room Lady
Master of the human kind
I know you symphatize
With the men who never fear

I know you, I'll never hide
The cry of mortal fools, you never mind

Welcome Death, enter in my soul
Now I'm ready, I beg your call

I love my real Bride
Black dress she wears
Take me and let me in
In your kingdom free

Living meaningless lives
We feel so unsatisfied
We know you are really great
Come on don't let me wait again
