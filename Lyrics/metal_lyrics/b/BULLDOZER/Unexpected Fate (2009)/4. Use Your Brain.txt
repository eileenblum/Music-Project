Time had come, years ago, Mr micro changed the world
then you could avoid TV, now you need a small PC
just connect to the net, (you) can explore the universe
need some porn? do you love sex?
any kind of taste you've got
you can see the pictures, you can watch the movies
you can choose the website and select your music
you can meet the people, you can see the rock stars
any kind of stuff you want is available to you... but
USE you better use just YOUR It's botta be your BRAIN
just your F... Brain
LEAVE and try to avoid it THEIR what they really do SHIT
what they treat as gold
BE you gotta see just YOUR don't be influenced SELF gotta
be yourself
JUST you will need to use YOUR what your mother gave you WITS:
It's within your brain
Now you can see the show be a fan or be a star
be a leader for your friends, or a frontman of a band
if you want anything, you can find what you need
everything's on the web, you can watch and you can bet
you can lose your money, you can buy your glory
looking for a new life till it's getting boring
just look what you can reach, maybe it's not so real
in this time of fake freedom you will choose (your)
junk to eat...
