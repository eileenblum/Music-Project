The martyrs praying, getting ready for the attack
They knew they had to face their death
"Stay calm, be happy for your destiny"
Instructions promised them new brides

Die
Die in the name of the merciful, die
Kill
Kill in the name of the merciful, kill

They hated the world, everything from western culture
Was to be totally destroyed
"You have to be strong, you cannot be compassionate"
It was a strict command

Die
Die in the name of the merciful, die
Kill
Kill in the name of the merciful, kill

Blinded by the doctrine, they could not use their brain
Hatred for the enemies, turned the men insane
Aiming for destruction of every western being
No mercy and no compassion: they took 'em all to death

Die to kill in the name of the merciful
Die to kill in the name of the merciful

The "ix" circle of hell, where hate is dominating
Once we illustrated it: destruction is their goal
Pure hate for the creation: martyrs and believers
Might be the real aces of the biggest blasphemy

Die to kill in the name of the merciful
Die to kill in the name of the merciful
