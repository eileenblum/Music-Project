And now, death is real, your blood circulation
has stopped forever in your veins
no more time to fear, 'cause your life is over
there's nothing now you can change
Where's your promise land, paradise or hell?
Are you expecting bliss? Or exciting lust?
Unexpected fate your life is over, now face the truth
Unpredictable mistake no reward! Look at the children starved
Unexpected fate you won't see heaven, you let'em die
Unpredictable mistake your illusion has come to the end now!
Billions of souls of innocent people
destroyed by lusting desires
enslaved, condemned to total extinction
they had no chance to survive
destroyers and slaughterers conviced in their minds
eternal beatitude or infernal orgies
escape from the victim's revenge
Where's your promise land, paradise or hell?
Are you expecting bliss? Or exciting lust?
Unexpected fate your life is over, now face the truth
Unpredictable mistake no reward! Look at the children starved
Unexpected fate you won't see heaven, you let'em die
Unpredictable mistake your illusion has come to the end now!
