Failure, depression and every imperfection
(Are) making you feel like that
a perfect occasion, the art of persuasion
the swindlers are ready to reap
feelings of sadness and no satisfaction
turning people into prey
doctors for souls, scientists for brains
Salvation for sale
they will change your life and take you away from anonymity
your money to gain
the easy way to improve the potential of your brain
Is this a religion? or a science? or a truth?
do you need to join it? are they trying to make you a fool? will you be successful?
will you learn to fight your fear?
are they gonna make you live forever?
promising to train you, for total self control
knowledge for your money, asking for your soul
do you really need salvation?
Maybe you'll be able to find your way
are they necessary to help you to be
the winner-man, the symbol of happiness
who's best in showing you how to live?
they pretend to be the "salvation men"
they claim they have the power to heal
they will celebrate their success! thanks to
your time and money spent in vain... feel the pain

[Solo: Jennifer Batten]

New sects, congregations can make you dependent
if you believe in their lies
they know what you need, they know how to move
you'll feel like an angel, you'll feel like a hero
once you're a slave they won't let you go
you have lost! you'll never be free
Salvation for sale
they will change your life and take you away from anonymity
your money to gain
the easy way to improve the potential of your brain
Is this religion? are you trying to make me a fool
I don't need to join it! your law is not a truth
I won't be a winner, I don't care care about my fear
you're not gonna make me live forever
I don't need your knowledge, I don't need your self control
I will make my way: I'll try to get my goal
I won't give your money, won't give you my soul
I don't need your fake salvation
