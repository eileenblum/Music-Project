Violating the temples, outraging religions
destruction is what you need
pleasure in hate, the aim to reject
pilasters of loving theories
Feeling of vengeance, repulsion for love
rebellion's the new prophecy
achieving your goal, forgetting your soul
and your immortality
Love is nothing, sacrifice is nothing

[Chorus:]
See desecrating all gods, the aces of blasphemy
See fisting the chicks, piss-scat and rude sodomy
See puke on the altar, the champions of blasphemy
See rivers of blood, excitement is guaranteed in hell
Screaming for your right, the right to die

[Solo: Jennifer Batten]

Damnation, salvation, redemption, creation
refusing them you feel all right
Insulting religion, you're looking for freedom
you don't fear the eternal night
See desecrating all gods, the aces of blasphemy
See fisting the chicks, piss-scat and rude sodomy
See puke on the altar, the champions of blasphemy
See rivers of blood, excitement is guaranteed in hell
