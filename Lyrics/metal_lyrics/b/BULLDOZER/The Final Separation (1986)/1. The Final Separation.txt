Pretentious mother of the children and the poor
The victims you forgot, and your servants too
You seem so careless when sinners are to be
sent to the gallows with demons and fools

We don't believe What St. John said
We refuse you Religions dead

Pretending to enjoy when triumph will be
Eating the flesh of dead people free
You won't be the mistress of earth and sea
Cause the men of the vengeance will fight with us
