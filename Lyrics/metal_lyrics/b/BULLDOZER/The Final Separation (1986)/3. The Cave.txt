We have never had the possibility
To spend a long night with you because...
But we know you like it hard and huge
You are not this kind of girl
We hate and use to send to hell
You'll be welcome
Cause you never say "I'm tired tonight"

We do really want the cave
We promise: she'll be slaked
Both her holes we wanna fill
When ever of course we will

We've never seen the pictures
And we don't know your 'face'
We don't care We can forgot the rest
A lot of fools laught at you
But I swear that we'll never do
You are the best
We will never kick out you

All the stories we heard about you
Had made us so excited
The tongue is going to taste the sailty
Juice of your sin

If you like the golden shower
We don't feel disgust
Everything you want to do is OK
You can trust us

The only thing we wouldn't like
Is the presence of a man
Cause exists the risk to take
Something in the ass

If you don't believe us
We'll explain what we mean
Don't forget we come from
The 'circle' of the worst sin
