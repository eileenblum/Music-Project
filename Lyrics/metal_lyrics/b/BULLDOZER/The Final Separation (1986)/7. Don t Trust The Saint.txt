The people let the preacher say
What's the saint's own way
They just ignore his wastful aim
They think he is living high

Wake up You crowd of fools
Don't you know who is the "saint" ?
Rise up Don't live by rules
Let me tell you "Don't trust the 'saint'" !

Ignorance leaves the power to them
Without controlling their plans
They will never let you realise
The bait is just paradise

The saint sells his own soul
Without showing his goal
Cheating hides under humility
He says he is the son of the lord
