Seeking high speed, neglecting my health
That's all I want night and day
I've nothing to fear, my painful death
I know there is no other way
Feeling so free, until my last breath
This time could be my last
I don't want to hide, I know I will be
A shadow of dust in the past

Ride hard Die fast
Going free My life at last

Don't give me that bullshit, I know what I mean
I'm late with my date in hell
Refusing the peace, don't wait for the priest
Someone will cast me a spell
Worms rot my brain, as bones turn to dust
The church won't toll the bell
Nobody knows me, nobody touches me
Finally I'm riding so well
