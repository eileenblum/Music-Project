Too many stars pretend to be
Champions of sex, the best you can see
Shaking their ass, licking their lips
And screaming like spastics " I love big tits"

They are giving bullshit, they never die
Barking dogs will never hits!

New disco music and sex into rhymes
They never say they fall all the times
Thousands of girls are seeking big 'dicks'
But no star has got it: that's really shit

Why don't you pretend a trial of strength
Not for their muscles, not for the lenght
Two minutes of sex for them it's a lot
Believe they are nothing that's why they stop
