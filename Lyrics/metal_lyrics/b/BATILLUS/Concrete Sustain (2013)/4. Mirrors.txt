suffer thirst
infinite halcyon
silence the plastic
radiation

power divinity
burn in the stars
far distant beacons
burn in the dark
vigil alienation
all pointing true
feel the afterglow
emit the truth

power divinity
burn in the stars
far distant beacons
burn in the dark
featherless fragments
particles mend
and reach to become
whole again
mirror shining
aeon
