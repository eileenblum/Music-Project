bound
we were prisoners of time
suspended embrace
together we arrived
into this space
suspended in light
understood as one
let our hearts burn

let the black birds fly
and carry the pain
listen to their song
resonate a new day
breaking the silence
clearing vision to see
what I searched in you
I found buried in me

neither by tongues
nor uttered by thorns
we held onto serpents
fragile as blades
thank you for letting what was lost
blossom and entwine
in the windows of your eyes
