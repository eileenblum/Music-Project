anxiety overcome
thoughts ruminate unwelcome
white paralysis
in a background of flesh

reasons unresolved
strengthen weak conduit
flow electric
unsettled minds hold anguish

pinnacles pierce 
into fields of light
waking slow 
in our hollow

abyss 
we grow silent
permeate beneath
shadowed semblant state

where roots embrace
our silver inner coil
motionless
bearing bleeding truth
