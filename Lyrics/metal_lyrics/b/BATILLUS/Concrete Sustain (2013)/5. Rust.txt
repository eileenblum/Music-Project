volatile
what shines turning rust
secrets fail temples fail
burn away pestilence
pranic flames
burn away

this weight pulling

enter a world that wilts
supple flesh turning dust
you are here
and this is real
open eyes
can you feel
all void

swim within
a thousand faces
of splintered need
ceaseless churning
impotence

swim through every tide
and change of time
separate inferior design
illuminate our lies
begin to wash it all away
revive
reset
