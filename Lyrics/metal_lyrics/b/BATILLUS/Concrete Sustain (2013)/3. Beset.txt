control is lost
release bondage
lean in to the blade
embrace the ache

shadow and sun
ride in the undone
polarity
crossing to the other shore
leaving chasm
a transmutation
polarity
suffering into serenity

fire and bone
ash and blood return home
vivification
these portals open
once more
melt in the ocean
begin again
