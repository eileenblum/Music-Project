rise 
in forgotten form
see a burning world 
a price for sacred lust
build 
trust in unseen source
wilt away dried and cracked our useless skin
fall 
the pedals shed of uselessness 
separate from untasted fruit
lay
lay to rot
in our dying world a burning chariot
a field of frozen time
sink in depths
a slow unwind
comatose 
rise
coiled &amp; frozen inside
sink in depths unwind
gifts of suffering transform
enter in stillness reborn
gifts of suffering transform
enter stillness reborn
in a burning world
rise
