distance
cycle full moon
boundless return
tendrils envelop
to hold you
unfold and follow
these inverted disciples
reside in the hollow
open a new marrow
written with dying suns
oracles set in flames
flesh we are bound
binding projection
stripping ourselves
into separate cells
pure
