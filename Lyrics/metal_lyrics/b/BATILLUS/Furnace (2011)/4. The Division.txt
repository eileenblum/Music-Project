i'm falling back now this is why
in deadly grip i'm falling back
and this is why two soiled paths
conquests divide to a sordid pose
look inside all these eyes
a river inside
flows from these eyes
i'm falling, falling in this world
into a distant sky
faced with past eclipsing time
crawl inside
see these eyes
rivers inside 
flow these eyes
falling, falling this world
come crawling back
i'm falling, falling this world
come crawling back
fall 
crawl
this world 
fall
crawl 
back
