for so long bound in timelessness
for i have walked as i have come
into this world alone
in the footsteps of the forgotten
toward horizons of famine
a deprived outline of celestial form
with masked eyes and burned minds
we shall wander
from sea to sea to sea
with a thirst
oceans toss and roar
with the fear in our hearts
search for what we've lost
but always possessed
breathe in a new, a new breath
now climb into shattered skies
elevate
over sleeping beasts
unleash 
forgotten cries
bound
