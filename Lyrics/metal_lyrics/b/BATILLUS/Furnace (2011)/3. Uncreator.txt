garden of forking paths
renounce in vast intricate labyrinth
we've lost our mysteries
engraved in unspoken thought
running wild through fallen boughs
my weary prophet
guardian of seclusion
illuminate
dissolve
in winged intent
a burden crippled
blind
attrition
abrasion
a cripple
burden 
breath
a lost breath
illuminate
the pale atmosphere
summon
broken shards
reflective
outward
spill through bent holes of teeth
i want to see the pain that binds love
i want to feel these bleak holes that bite
held like a stillborn hope
