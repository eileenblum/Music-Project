Can I
Pray more than you
We are brothers
I've been digging all night long
We have our home on run-down highway
We are the barricade
United in fear
Blackest piece of mind
I'm guilty that's all right
Blackest piece of day
You got the soul
Got the soul
I'm Pissing
And I'm looking at you
Fighting

But Who cares about that
Except you
Time is the digger
inside your soul

who sometimes barking like your dog
Out of sight
I got my mask

Be my companion on our escape
You got the soul
Hold your soul
I'm the painter
I have a number
Rely on you
You are my predator
Projector

I'm a trinket, ticket
That's why you blind
Show me something that I can't find
inside myself
I'm looking for
can't deny
And I won't pay for you anymore
