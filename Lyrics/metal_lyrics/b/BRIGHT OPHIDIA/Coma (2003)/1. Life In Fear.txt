Do you think I'm man
Do you think I'm dog
Come
Thrill

I want to fell kind
Gait unreal
Love

love is blind
It's a Quiz,
senseless diary of life

Life
Fear
Old age
God
Thrill
Love
Lord
comes

Save your soul
I'll feed it dope
I feel the devils around me
Save your soul
I know he comes
I hear the howling...
