Password , you talking now
in the damage
and in the shock
In hell will be the same
I've been there

There's nothing special about it
Do you know my name god
Do you know my name god
Do you know something about my fear
Do you, do you
Do you know my name?
Breakdown
Fist

Somebody wants to use you
I am here and I'm so alone
My beautiful friend...he is almost gone
In hell will be the same
we live in hell

And there's nothing special about it
ShowTime
Fist
Somebody wants to use you

It isn't depends on you

Always I tried and I've tried so hard
Somebody has destroyed my stubbornness
Pauper
Let me out
Fuck you bastard!
Why world depends on you
That's fact

Somebody said that the world depends on you
I will tell you something
I know him, he is a liar
He's wrong !
