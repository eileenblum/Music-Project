I know that I'm lost inside
I've lost my faith

Again

Stay and watch underground
Set me free
In the end

Beneath
suffering I've prayed
and thousands nightmares
want to capture me alive
this is illusive time
over hills I've painted my face
the enemy equals your mind
where's my mother blessing

walk with me this way
