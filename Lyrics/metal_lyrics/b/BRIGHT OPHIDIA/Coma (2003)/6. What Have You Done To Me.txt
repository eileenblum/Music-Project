Look out !

Don't talk with stranger
I know you are in the danger
Don't talk to me
I got the plan
But 1 want more
I got the message
I don't care for adore
What happened with my life
And what is for

Hey, what have you done to me
I thought I've altogether known your dreams
I will tell you one thing....

Don't talk to the others
I don't care for the silly brothers
Don't wander with me
I got the plan
Blood craves blood
I got the fixture
I don't care for adore
What happened with my world
And what is for

I know I'm lost my mind
But peace we'll find in grave
And I'm sure all the pain is game
