What you wanted, now you have
Spit it out
It's boiling time
What you wanted
Where's your grave
I supposed I'm SS man
Knocked down

I'm little mouse coursed by pills naive medicine
And I'm absolutely brave
Burning stove
It's start to heal
Say yeah

I'm the man different kind of knife
Say yeah
This poison makes your stench

Shame on you
Shame on you
I'm running again
Dance in light with me
