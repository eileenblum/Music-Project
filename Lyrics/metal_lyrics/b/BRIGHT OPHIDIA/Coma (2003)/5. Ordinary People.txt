Time is moving around
I'm afraid of emptiness in my eyes
Time is moving around
I can't hear beat of your heart
Ordinary people
Ordinary people
we have to say goodbye

Wind will lash your tears
We have no way to run
I'm standing on the line of life
I don't care where's the flat of your god

Ordinary people
Ordinary people
we have to say goodbye

How I can try to understand you
I am the man, I am the crowd for you
Die by my hand
Destroy another world
What should 1 do to find my soul
