As we walk through the ashes of our existence
All our hopes lay shattered
As we dance in the flames of this dying world
Grasping for one last breath
To find meaning and understanding
To find comfort
To reap the seeds we have sowed
In hope of better days to come

As we've torn up these scars
Of the plague you have brought upon
Our spirits lay down buried
In dead abd sterile grounds
To keep us locked away
From sanity
To keep us locked away
From integrity

Left to crawl
stigmatized
Hung to dry
To watch reasoning die

As we crawl through the ruins of a life
That could have been worth living
As we chose to fight to
Make the difference

That could have been worth giving
Up our lives for
To carry the disease in our hearts and our minds
Disconnected, disrespected
Humiliated, torn apart
Stigmatized, hung to dry
Bleed to death, left to starve

As I bleed out from thousand wounds
The world is passing by
Can I still make a difference
Do I still know what is right

Curse the day I was born
With a conscience
Curse the day I opened my eyes
Curse the day I realized what it meant
To see the dead flooding around
Curse the day I realized what it meant
To be painful by being alive
Curse the day I saw myself trapped
In the spirit burial ground
