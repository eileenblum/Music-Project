We the dead - risen back to life
We the dead - in tear of rage
We the dead - risen back to life
We the dead - we are the new age

Awoken to a new dawn
We have risen back to life
The endless nights are fading
In these charming big city lights

With every drop of blood
With every breath we take
We thirst for the coming of a new age

With every beat of the heart
With every drop a sweat
Our eyes drown in tears of rage

No longer stripped and messed
No longer bound by chains
No longer fighting over the crumbs like rats
No longer immersed in pain

I am no longer bound by chains
I am no longer immersed in pain
I am no longer bound by chains
I am no longer immersed in pain
