In this cultural wasteland
What is left for the young and the restless
What is left among your billboard lies
Among your golden prison bars
Among your nicely dressed generation of
Sleepwalking living dead
Wrapped up in shining cells

In this cultural wasteland
What is left for you and me
Where can we scream
Where can we breath
Where can we be free

We are the generation of hope
We are the generation of stories untold
We are the scum of this earth
We are the rats giving birth
To the nightmares of your world

We see with clear eyes
We fell with full hearts
We are the generation buried alive
We are the generation pushed aside

And times will come
When there's no one left to protect you
When the peripheral will have their way
When the castaways will flood your streets
With something to say
When the buried alive
Will rise from their graves
When the young and the restless
Will embrace their hate
