The herd keeps marching
The dogs keep barking
And you will never know
That all your molotows
That all the bricks you threw
Are just another power's tools
You're feeding no fire
You're fooled into fake visions
Of a revolution never to be known

Like sheep led to slaughter
There goes the march
Like sheep led to slaughter
Force fed with lies

Like sheep led to slaughter
Tear down that blindfold
Like sheep led to slaughter
There's nothing for you to die for

Standing on your barricades
Preaching your high and mighty
Slogans of your so-called revolution
Fought with no guns this time
This world is so convenient
You can sit tight after all
In the warmth of your homes
This is the revolution never to be known

Welcome to the world
Of rebels without a cause
Welcome to the world
Of empty, blinding slogans
Welcome to the world
Of the sheep led to slaughter
Welcome to the world
Of the revolution never to be known

Welcome to the world
Where the ignorant are kings
Welcome to the world
Of no real beliefs
Welcome to the world
Of the sheep led to slaughter
Welcome to the world
Of the revolution never to be known

Welcome to the world
Of sick and twisted minds
Welcome to the world
Of symbols as our gods
Welcome to the world
Of the sheep led to slaughter
Welcome to the world
Of the revolution never to be known
