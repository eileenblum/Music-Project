I look around myself and I see
A dying nation
Immersed in desperation
Generations haunted
By the ghosts of past

Sons and daughters infected
With the modern day plague
Of never forgetting
Only regretting
Always turning back

I look around myself and I see
A crying nation
Torn apart from degeneration
With masses fooled
By the ghosts of future

Bleeding from sutures
Of torn up wounds
Caged in sickened distorted minds
Fear the unknown
Bury the faithless
Burn the witches alive

Burn the witches alive
Torch the remains of
A future worth living

Let the degenerates rise
Torch the remains of
A life worth leading

And here I stand bleeding
With my mind infected
With my heart diseased

And here I stand yeaming
With my mind infected
With my heart diseased

I look around myself and I see
A depressed nation
Led by the DeGeneration
Of sleepwalking zombies
Living on our streets and homes
How can I make a difference
How can I be someone else
In this environment filled with
The shackles of death

What if I will be just another one
What if I will stand in line
What if I can't hope
What if I can't live
What if I can't fucking hide

What if I will be just another one
What if I will stand in line
What if I will break
What if I will cry
What if I will silently die

Here we go again
Hoping-Loving-Wanting-Living
We will not ever gain
Hated-Disgraced-Torn apart
