I have lost my faith in the human race
I have lost my way in this human maze
Of endless hypocrisy and lies
Sucking up and stomping down

Where do I turn when there's no one left to believe in
Where do I turn when there's no place left to hide

I have lost my faith in the human grace
I have lost my hope in this dying age
Of values turned upside down
In this age of snakes among us

I have lost my faith - my faith
I have lost my way - my way
I am the faithless, I am the misanthrope
I am the pariah, I despise you all

I am the faithless, I am the misanthrope
I am the godless creature of dying hope

I am the merciless, I am the ticking bomb
I am the fear and horror invading your homes

I have lost my faith in the human kind
I have lost my sight among the blind
I have lost my sense of mind
I am just like you, I am bound to survive

I am bound to survive
There's no place left to hide

I am the faithless, I am the misanthrope
I am the faithless, I am the misanthrope
