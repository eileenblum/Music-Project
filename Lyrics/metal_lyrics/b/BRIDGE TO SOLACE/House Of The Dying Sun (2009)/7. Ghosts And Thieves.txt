Our ways are paved between
The ghosts of past and the thieves of future
Can you feel the weight of life
When yours is at stake

Can you feel the need to live
Trapped in between ghosts and thieves
Can you feel the urge to breathe
Caught up in smoke and flames

Our ways- our ways are paved
Between ghosts and thieves
Our ways- our ways are paved
Between loss and grief
Our ways- our ways are paved
Between ghosts and thieves
Our ways- our ways are paved
Between loss and grief

This is not a cry for help
This is me taking an oath to live
This is me taking back what you stole from me
This is me fighting back your ghosts
This is me standing back up on my feet

What is the purpose
What is the weight of life
Whats waiting but death at the end of the road
What is the wight of life

What shall we do not to de ghosts and thieves
What shall we do not to be ghosts and thieves
