There is a house in the East
They call the Dying Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor boys
And god wouldn't know who's the one

Only if god existed
To hear your prayers that
Fell upon deaf ears
Among the bitter and the hated
Among the starving eyes and sickened minds

'Cause baby there is no god
Among the merciless
And there's nowhere left to turn to
Among the ruins of a paradise
With shackles still to break

There is a house in the East
They call the Dying Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor boys
And I know I might be just one

Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on train
I'm running as far as I can
To get rid of that ball and chain

That ball and chain to
Infect a dying nation
Left without inspiration
Gathering like vultures
To the funeral bells
Of what once was hope

And you can wait for your
Angels to fall from heaven
Showing compassion
For your crying nation

But who would give a dime
For the scavengers who
Dug a hole to hope
And buried it deep
While fighting over bones
