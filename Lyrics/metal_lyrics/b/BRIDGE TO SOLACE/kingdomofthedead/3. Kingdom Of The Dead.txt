Give me a knife and I'll twist it in my chest,
I'll bee the first to cut out my heart and put it away to rest.
It's only if I'm dead,
I'm able to see the end of all nights that nails me to this cross
I bear within these visions that surround.
Dreams, you are so fragile
and I wasn't even aware enough to hold you in my hands as carefully
as in these moments of anger.

I starve for this knife to cut all these nerves through.
Wish I could, wish I could've built a wall surrounding my small world,
but instead I'm left alone to destroy what is old.

Dreams, you are so fragile
and I wasn't even aware enough to hold you in my hands.
Truth rears its ugly head with a sick smile on its face,
Staring at me as I am the only one to blame.

How many times I wished to smash this evil head?
How many times I longed for the embrace of angels to take me far away
and then I could be alone and sit on the throne in the kingdom,
in the kingdom of the dead.

How many times I longed for the embrace of angels to take me far away
and then I could be alone and sit on the throne in the kingdom of the dead,
in the kingdom of the dead,
in the kingdom of the dead.
