Fantasize! In our dreams we are so tough
but this one punch we call waking up
kills everything we we carefully planned

in our warm beds of hate, of love, of sick mindgames.
In search of love I've seen hate.
In search of love I've met pain.
In search of love I've felt fear.
In search of hate I have seen love.
In search of hate I've risen above.

In search of hate I have no longer found myself alone.
Fantasize! In our dreams we are so tough
but this one punch we call waking up
kills everything we we carefully planned
in our warm beds of hate, of love, of sick mindgames.

Of hate, of love, of sick mindgames.
Of hate, of love, of sick mindgames.
In search of love I've seen hate.
In search of love I've met pain.
In search of love I've felt fear.
In search of hate I have seen love.
In search of hate I've risen above.

In search of hate I have no longer found myself alone.
Fantasize! In our dreams we are so tough
but this one punch we call waking up
kills everything we we carefully planned
in our warm beds of hate, of love, of sick mindgames.
Arms wide open with a stare at the pale grey sky.

Fists risen as a resounding fuck-off to all gods.
Arms wide open with a stare at the pale grey sky.
Fists risen as a resounding fuck-off to all gods.
Here I stand, risen from my ashes,
back from the dead.

Through love and hate,
through smiles and tears
that nearly tore me down,
I'm breathing in and out,
I'm breathing in and out,
I'm breathing in and out.
I spit death out
and I breathe in life
and I breathe in life
and I breathe in life.
I spit death out

and I breathe in life.
I spit death out
and I breathe in life.
