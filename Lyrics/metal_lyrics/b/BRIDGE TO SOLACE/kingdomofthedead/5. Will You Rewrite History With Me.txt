This in no way should be taken as me giving up on anything.
I am just simply trying to clear
that whenever anyone is ready to beat me to the ground,
I will not care at all.
Will you take my hand and rewrite history with me?
Will you catch my breath, hold my face in your hands,
look deep into my eyes and scream that we will make it?
Or end up just like all those millions before...
Don't get me wrong, I am into pushing limits as well,
but I have seen enough fates
and enough faces covered by tears,
enough shoulders embraced,
enough stories told,
enough yes-es and enough no-s,
enough hopes hopes that were dying last,
that were dying last.
This of course in no way should be taken as me giving up on anything.
I am just simply trying to clear that whenever anyone is ready to beat me to the ground,
I will not fucking care at all,
because I have lived my fate
and my face was covered by tears.
And whenever my shoulders were embraced,
there were thousands of stories that left thousands of lips.
This in no way should be taken as me giving up on anything.

I am just simply trying to clear
that whenever anyone is ready to beat me to the ground,
I will not care at all.
I have heard yes-es and no-s
and I also have said those
and my hopes were dead and then exhumed,
dead and exhumed,
dead and exhumed,
dead and exhumed.
If you love someone, let her to be free!
And whenever she returns, you know she was always yours.
And if she never comes back, she never did belong to you.
Fuck yeah, I am sure I will rewrite history,

Will you do it with me?
Will you do it with me?
