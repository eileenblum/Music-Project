I still believe!
This was all, when I needed arms to hold me tight and lips to kiss my cheeks.

And you still ask why I am holding on to this?
This was all when I needed a corner to hide and a place to fit in.

And you still ask why I am holding on to this?
This is all I have,
and the earth stops turning,
and the world keeps burning.

This is all I have,
these chords and words that keep my heart alive
and fuel me with the heat

that drives me past all my dreams.
This was all, when I needed arms to hold me tight and lips to kiss my cheeks.

And you still ask why I am holding on to this?
This was all when I needed a corner to hide and a place to fit in.

And you still ask why I am holding on to this?
This is all I have,
and the earth stops turning,
and the world keeps burning.

This is all I have,
these chords and words that keep my heart alive
and fuel me with the heat
that drives me past all my dreams.

May this song be a pathetic one,
may these words be written a thousand times before,
but this is my anthem
I sill scream for those who still believe
and never give in.

For those who still believe
and never fucking give in.
With raised fists
kids go marching
and we never give in,
we never fucking give in.

This is our anthem,
this is our youth
and we never give in,
we never fucking give in.
This is our...

This is our anthem.
This is our...
This is our youth.
This is our anthem. (This is our anthem.)
This is our youth. (This is our youth.)
This is our anthem. (This is our anthem.)
This is our youth. (This is our youth.)
Our anthem.

Out youth.
Our youth.
