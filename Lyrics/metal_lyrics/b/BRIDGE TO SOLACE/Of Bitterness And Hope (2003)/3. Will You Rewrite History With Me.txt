This in no way should be taken as me giving up on anything
I'm just simply trying to clear
That whenever anyone is ready to beat me to the ground
I will not care at all

Will you take my hand?
And rewrite history with me?
Will you catch my breath?
Hold my face in your hands
Look deep into my eyes
And scream that we will make it?
Or end up just like

All those
Millions before...
Don't get me wrong,
I am into pushing limits just as well

But I have seen enough fates
And enough faces covered by tears
Enough shoulders embraced
Enough stories told
Enough yes's and enough no's
Enough hopes that were dying last
That were dying last

This in no way should be taken as me giving up on anything
I am just simply trying to clear that whenever anyone is ready to beat me to the ground
I will not fucking care at all

Because I have lived my fate
And my face was covered by tears
And whenever my shoulders were embraced
There were thousands of stories that left thousands of lips

This in no way should be taken as me giving up on anything
I'm just simply trying to clear
That whenever anyone is ready to beat me to the ground
I will not care at all

I have heard yes's and no's
And I also have said those
And my hopes were dead and then exhumed
Dead and then exhumed (x4)

If you love someone
Let her to be free
And whenever she returns
You know she was always yours
And if she never comes back
She never did belong to you
Fuck yeah, I am sure I will rewrite history
Will you do it with me?
Will you do it with me?
