Speechless I lay down my head.
Shaking from this feeling of emptiness.
Every fucking time I try to create definitions of what my missions are, and why are we brought to this world when the end result is totally fucked, I choke for air, and tears flow like bleeding rivers from my eyes, down my cheek, ending where once I will lay.
I can never find words to express that how I feel being totally helpless, and alone with this, but I just can never stop worrying about this, even if I end up, and become fucking nothing, just like everyone else will.
Well, I guess, this is natural order, well fuck that.
And what makes it scarier, are all the people who just try to cash in on this, all those people waiting for it.
No fucking dogmas can save me, no fucking higher power can save me.
Just myself, and my creativity, all the things I care for, and all the people I just love for being here.
And fuck, this is why it hurts, this why it hurts.
All the things we lived for, are just going to be fucking nothing.
Just like you.
Just like me.
But these are our catalysts to keep us going on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
I can never find words to express that how I feel.
Fuck, I just can never say goodbye.
I hate to say goodbye, it's unfair to say goodbye, I don't want to say goodbye.
