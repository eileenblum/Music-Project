This is something I definitely wouldn't call boys fun at all.
And it's just goddamn ironic, how you blame the cross and the book of lies for your earthly miseries, but in all of a sudden, you're ready to speak their fucking words, whenever it comes down to the rights of someone else's body, who you probably never met, never saw and of course never even talked to.
Fuck yeah, just go ahead and keep your fucked up theories of life, and do your fucking best to talk for something to happen, what you have absolutely no clue of.
I just wonder what the fuck you're looking for, in a so called progressive movement, screaming slogans of totally fucked up righteousness.
And sure, just go and wage this war against their bodies and their minds.
Probably you don't care if it was an accident or rape, living being vs.
living being, one or both ends up being the victim of our everydays, one or both ends up being the victim of this fucking system.
Dude you're so goddamn fucking lame.
