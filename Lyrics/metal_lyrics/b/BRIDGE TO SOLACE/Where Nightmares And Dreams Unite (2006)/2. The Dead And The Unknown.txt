Where have we gone,
among the faceless masses,
The dead and the unknown
close and far apart
torn in between
what's said and what's done

Endless nights and endless fights,
to make our heart's wishes last
to make these beats come to life
to make ourselves feel alive

Where have you gone,
out of reach for my stretched arms
out of reach in the land of
the dead and the unknown

Endless fights break heart's
will these words, breathe life
into the agony of what
once meant the world to us

Where have we gone - The dead and the unknown
Where have we gone - Aren't we supposed to want more

Where do I turn,
In the loss of idealistic visions
In the loss of hope
among the dead and the unknown,
Broken dreams, yet dear to me
now gather around to watch me bleed,
from thousands of wounds
as the nails shred the skin the flesh the bone

Are we born to lose
the endless wars
among the dead, among the unknown
struggling to survive
alienated but alive
in the land of the guilt
in the home of our sins
we always wish for more
where do the wages of sin lay
in death or in the freedom of our will?
