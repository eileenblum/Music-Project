Did you ever hear anyone
calling out your name
Or are you just so busy
saving the world
That you just choke
upon your dogmas
And your mindless isms
and the wish to find
their meanings,
are ruining your dreams
leaving you alone.

Did you ever see anyone
reaching out their hand
Or are the visions
of your martyrdom
blinding you, as much as your
senseless labels land upon targets
who refuse to bear the crosses
of your selfish wars
Wars you even doubt to wage yourself
just take everyone down the drain
I'll just keep my beliefs
and faith for myself
Just make everyone
feel like shit for
Not walking your selfish ways
I'll keep crossing my own paths of life.

Did you ever hear anyone
telling you the little secrets of life
Or are the gunshots of your revolution
deafening your ears
efforts to gain
credibility at any cost
won't make you look smarter,
but just another hypocrite
Who's the next on in the line,
keep walking the Martyr's path
keep thinking you're the only one that's blessed.
I'll keep my beliefs my faith, my ways,
and that already made my world change.
