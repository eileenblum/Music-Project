When we both kill
Who's left there to keep sane
and keep hearts in motion amidst emotions
That lift up and tear down
heal and poison
One out of two is there to die

And I am sworn this cross will be mine
and I walked through
the ashes and I've bled
and now I see ourselves
through the eyes of the dead.

When we both bleed
Who's left there coagulate,
and keep blood streaming
and lungs breathing
and swallow tears down
and throw them up
On this world that is cruel enough
for letting us die

When we both kill
Who's left there to keep sane
When we both bleed
Who's left to coagulate
When we both smile
Who's left there to cry
Who's left there to rise

When we both smile
Who's left there to cry
and keep tears flowing
and our insides aching
For what we have had,
But it was never enough
For us to be content with,
And now we walk hand in hand
with the dead.
