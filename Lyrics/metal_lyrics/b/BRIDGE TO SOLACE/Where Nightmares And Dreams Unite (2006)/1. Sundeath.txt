With our hearts stripped of love
with our heads a tangled mess
we are the desperate to come
to haunt and to hunt
by the night falls down,
searched for something
that we might never find
we the dead - we raise our flags
we the dead - we're the disease
that breaks hearts
arm us up with the knives
to cut the throat of lights
So we'll immerse in this forever night
with our fingernails bleeding
From crawling in vain
up the sewer to your backyards
to your bedrooms
to the back of your minds
to your shiny heavens
made of gold showing us
what seemed to be real
is already buried untold
as the marrow leaves our bones
as bleeding dry we choke
as we kneel down in thorns
and we lose our focus on hope
stripped and messed
abused and depressed
we have nothing left to lose - fuck you
for stealing our days
but we'll rule these nights
and like rats we'll flow
these streets you're so proud to own
we the dead, we raise our flags
we haven't come this far
to give up and turn back
we the dead we raise flags
bloodthirsty we watch this sun's death
