Drag me down with all you've got
With patterns and dogmas designed
To kill whats still alive
And we're left to march through the buried
Thirsty for status, hungry for symbols
Amidst slogans echoing back in our ears
Telling us to be dead is to be alive
And what more's there to life than keeping out
Functions, and closing our eyes, letting moments slip by,
With our heads bowed, with our hearts buried under
The ruins of our heavens in our minds.

I'm not here to save this world,
I'm here to save myself, and set it abiaze
I'm not here to save this world
I'm here to dance in ruins, as heavens and hells collide
I'm not here to save this world,
I'm here to save myself, with my heart bled dry
I'm not here to save this world,
I'm here to dance in the ruins of our heavens made of hopes.

As youthful ideals turn,
Into jaded apathy extreme - is the path I take
Towards the greater good,
The benefit of the self,
Among lives to be led and lived astray,
Astray - in the ruins of our heavens in our hearts,
Ruins - of our heavens made of hopes
Hearts - bled dry and what's left untold
Let it rise! - let it rise! - let it rise!
Nightmare and dreams unite!

I'm not here to save this world,
I'm here to save myself, and set it abiaze
I'm not here to save this world
I'm here to dance in ruins, as heavens and hells collide
I'm not here to save this world,
I'm here to save myself, with my heart bled dry
I'm not here to save this world,
I'm here to dance in the ruins of our heavens made of hopes.

Dragged me down with all you had,
And our patterns and dogmas,
Might have killed what was still alive,
And I was bound to march through the buried
Yet among my thirst and my hunger,
And from the ruins of my heavens
I built this wall around - to keep myself alive
I built - this - wall - around - to - keep - my fuckin' self, alive
