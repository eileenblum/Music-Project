Some are born to wander
Some are born to run
Some are born to oppose
Some are born to hide
Some are born to escape
Some are born to bleed
Some are born to die alone
Some are born to survive

Some are born to give
Some are born to take
Some are born as cowards
Some are born as braves
Some are born to fear
Some are born to sacrifice
Some are born to suffer
Some are born to realize

Are we running from or towards our dreams?
Are we trying to dare whatever it may take?

To dare whatever it may take
To draw an honest breath
To rebuild the ruins of our lives
To ask the questions that's been
Longing for the answers
Longing for the answers
Deep within our hearts
To tell the answers that's been
Waiting to be asked for
Waiting to be asked for
Deep within our minds

Some are born to break the chains
Some are born to live in cage
Some are born to run in vain
Some are born to escape the shame
But where does shame lay
And who do we lay the blame on
If we escape from being burned
What really just defines

Who we are
What we are
And how we fight

Who we are
What we are
And how we lead our lives


Thanks to steve for sending track #4 lyrics.
