As our dreams are killing
As our hopes are shattered
We lay the blame on ourselves
Wishing for one last deadly kiss
To poison our blood with hopes
That might as well be as dead as we are

What have we left
When everything's out of reach
But the will not to give up
When all worlds collide
What have we left
to deal with ourselves
When giving up is where
We are heading towards

As our dreams are dying
As our hearts are blackened
We lay the blame on everyone
Wishing for one last deadly strike
To clean our blood from desires denied
While we might as well be as dead as they are

All the hopes abandoned
All the dreams shattered
All the "If"s and
All the questions
That never really mattered

All the veins poisoned
All the hearts blackened
All the fears stacked up
That should have never mattered

All the anthems unsung
All the wishes unspoken
All the lies we have told ourselves
That left us scattered

All the loves unloved
All the pain we've felt
All the lies we told each other
That left us suffered

All the crimes we committed
All the dying moments
All the hopeless cries for help
That remained unheard

As in dreams we're crying
As our hopes are dying
As our crimes are binding
As our eyes are burning in tears
Is failure what we've left to embrace
