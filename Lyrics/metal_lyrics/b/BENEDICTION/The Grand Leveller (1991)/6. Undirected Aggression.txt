Your life means nothing.
Parting isn't such sweet sorrow.
Dripping with hate.
Words from the inner soul.

Realization of my ways.
Evidently unapparant.
Ignominous behaviour.
Physically repulsed by you.

Tormentation of emotion.
Occupy my every thought.
Freezing you, my infliction.
So cold that you will burn.
Excruciating pain you learn.

Mutual hate - on this vastitude of fate.
Only one stands to win.
Let the murdering begin.

Now you suffer.
Amongst all ye children now.

Cowards die often.
I will not let things lie.
Demise architecht.
This grudge will infect.
