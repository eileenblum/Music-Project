Joyride!
In my dreams the world is - dark.
For the longest time just - black.
No light until the end - fall.
Witness what is hidden.

"There are opportunities with in life...for gaining knowledge...and experience"

A grizzly find.
Playing on the mind.
Let's confusion thrive.
Warning her to stay alive.

Love letter of lead.
Directly from my heart.
Will send you straight to hell.

Deeper and deeper, look beneath.
Find the secrets that lie.
Raped in velvet, oh so blue.
Time has come, unmystify.

These outrageous events.
Break through the peaceful silence.
Into a fragile community.
Enters madness, insanity.

A season of darkness.
No faith in the calm.
Nothing but the storm.

Now it is dark.
Don't you look at me.
You have my disease.
Inhale the ecstacy.
