In the screaming blackest reaches
The stertorous watches of cyclopean night
Atramental immanence
Till daybreak slashes with pernicious light

Exsanguine
Obscene

In tremulous trepidation
In anticipation of the lancet's caress
In ever-desreasing consciousness
For gratification of the cruelest request

Fellate me
As her skin weeps

And though the bloom may wither, the petals gleam
Leaking all scarlet ecstasy, glistening, free
What use is pleasure if not born from tortured cruelty
Bleed out your very life for the totality of my depravity
