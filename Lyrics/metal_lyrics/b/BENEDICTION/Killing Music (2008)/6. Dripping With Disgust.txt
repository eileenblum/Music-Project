Incarnadine
To wash the body of god in blood
When human nature is motive to kill
Soothsayer will be hunted
Do not confess on pain with death
In this dark age the truth is the destroyer

The tyranny of the mindless right
To persecute unsacred plight
From defected birth to deserved end
A blasphemy to live

With ancient curse
The hidden shame
Never to create
A living sin
And god to blame
Duty compells to hate

A black psychosis
Hidden murderous lust
A poisoned blade
Gilt edged and dripping with disgust

Spread a plague
To fight a plague
Hatred cloacked if fear
Lesions
Devour the brain
Screaming they'll meet their end

A black psychosis
Hidden murderous lust
A poisoned blade
Clandestine edged and dripping with disgust

No room to breathe, no such fantasy
A last gasp as riddled with disease you fall

Fighting fire
With holy fire
Tragedy revealed
Innocence
Irrelevant
Vengeance it its own reason

A black psychosis
Hidden murderous lust
A poisoned blade
Wretched edged and dripping with disgust

Incarnadine
An image of god now drowning in blood
