Tumultuous infraction
When stirred the beast will roar
Implacable reaction
Parasites will be abhorred
But in the easy belly
Where beats the savage heart
Lies yet greater evil
Leaving victims hacked apart

Burying the hatchet...

Inquisitions churning
Guiltless plaintiff dies
Invisible assailant
As accusations fly
desperate bourgeois panic
It's never safe to sleep
As victims jump at shadows
And death runs ever fleet

Burying the hatchet...

I am not human
A devil stalks the deep south
Spit forth from hottest hell
Do not seek the axeman
Lest your brains besmear his axe as well
And so persists the spectre
Forever be unknown
Remain a violent mystery
The fell demon has returned home.

Burying the hatchet...
