You could not destoy me though insidious you tried
I detest your seed, you have abhorred me for the final time

No serpent to bar the path of my will

Casting off the yoke of your burdens, do as you will, I'll do as I must
Such brightly glinting promises revealed in truth as dust
All of you that was golded lies tarnished by your fear
Would that I could feel remorse - regrets recede when wrath draws near

No serpent to bar the path of my will

You will not condemn me

Eradicating root and branch
Duplicitous and ill advanced
Twisted features compell me
To rid you of your vanity

Accusations have damned you
I could hurl defiance at your cropse but I wouldn't waste my fucking breath

No serpent to bar the path of my will
You would condemn me for being what I am
