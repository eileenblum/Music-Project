You incubate despicable rancorous seed
No thing of beauty this so tortured flesh turned death

Despised gestation, fertile breeding, suffocation
In the darkest place, foetal horror's corruption bleeds

Infect

All the years of pain and death no saviour
Oh hated injustice, paying tithes to death itself

Despised gestation, fertile breeding, suffocation
Would that we had the knife to cut if free

Let the blood run free

And in the mirror before you
Sightless eyes blind to the growing shadow
Consuming?

And as the dead we shall walk

Blackly erubescent, eschatological descent
Words twisted beyond madness in this world of the truest path

Despised gestation, fertile breeding, suffocation
Would that we had the knife to cut if free

Carved into our hearts
We wear the name called death
Will there be a beyond?
Then let it weep in preparation?

A legacy of shining lights to despise the unjust
History will remember the ones among the first into the breach

Once more unto the breach

Subsumed by abomination
Dead ritualistic threnody
this killing music
