It will start with an invitation, and who would guess the truth?
Nightmare juxtaposition, I'll lead off your child and need no proof
Tiny hands so trusting held in utter evil's thrall
But the innocent is the grey man's now and I'll love her like I loved them all

Consume her as I did them all?

"First I stripped her naked.
How she did bite and scratch..."

Crying supplication and familial appeal
Childish retaliation cannot overcome the beast
You may bite the hand that eats you but you won't survive the meal
And I may not fuck the virgin but she will become my feast

How sweet her little ass will taste?

"I choked her to death.
Then cut her in small pieces so I could take my meat."

The blood thirst overwhelms me

Cruciform fixation, indescribably insane
Deluded aberration, angels must condone these acts
Such brutal flagellation, God must be to blame
Pin cushion perversion, subvert the lightning's wrath

Sane, insane, matters not, regardless the grey man's dead at last
