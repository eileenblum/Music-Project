Reject despised mundanity
Exult in mental empire
Within the prime casuality
Sublimate to defile
Expose the lying bastards' ways
Wretched the strong shall fall
Another low rabid dog's day
Cages animals will torture

The litany of a wasted life
Yet who deserves such a fate
Mayhap the rank abusers might
Grotesqueries to repay
Subject them to the cruelest plight
Plumbing the foulest depths

A symphony of howling fright
Abase yourselves before your master
The litany of a wasted life
Yet who deserves such a fate
Mayhap the rank abusers might
Grotesqueries to repay
Subject them to the cruelest plight
Plumbing the foulest depths
A symphony of howling fright
Abase yourselves before your master

So beg you dogs
Now who's the bitch
As you fuck face down in the dirt?

With wires and cattle prode I'll play your organs

Inside the padded cell
White walls are no defence
Images will show you as I fuck your wife and sanity

I have decayed within this hell
This murine mind disease
Dreamt madness in this mortal shell
All ears deaf to my pleas
Yet as reason fails and I start to drown
Bereft of the will to live
In my empire of twisted shame
I'll never fucking forgive

So beg you dogs
Now who's the bitch
As you fuck face down in the dirt
