Amidst the elegance
Amidst the starving suffering
The supreme predator in an age of dogs
Their wounds will never heal

Dim witted trusted populace
Cloacked in discarded death
An oral tracheotomy
A corpse gasping breath

A coat sanguine satiety
When fed on human swine
Screaming child whore's embraced
When drunk on human wine

Dim witted trusted populace
Cloacked in discarded death
An oral tracheotomy
A corpse gasping breath

The blood moon rises

Attack the corpse with two clean cuts
The intestines excarnated
offal discarded in a pail

See the smoke as the blood moon rises

Skeletal anomalies lie buried in the silt
The act of decapitation
bleeds the audacity of guilt

See the smoke as the blood moon rises

Scouring the earth to soar the earthly soul
Fed my the sale of human meat

A city cries in panic
With skulls in the river mud
Embodiment of contradiction
Behold the moon's face of blood

Dim witted trusted populace
Cloacked in discarded death
An oral tracheotomy
A corpse gasping breath
