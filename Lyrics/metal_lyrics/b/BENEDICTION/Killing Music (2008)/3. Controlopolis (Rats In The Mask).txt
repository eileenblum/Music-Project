Cry freedom
Misleading through eternity
Mealy mouthed control freak frauds
Bleak relief in ivory

So bleak

Break the mechanism
Set aside the frail untruth
Take control of inborn rights
Pay back ten fold the abuse

Pay Back

They'll strip you down to number and a card
And all cry freedom, all codes be disbarred

In the controlopolis
Checked and balanced, fully unaware

Lucid yet transparent
As clockwork savages
Rats in the mask
Can be just one step away

Gaps in the armour of all oppressive states
Long knives of final liberty
Repress control eradication

Deaths of millions in the three pronged strike
Triple tyrant - paranoid sham
Tithe and tite will wait for no man

Commitment a myth, and live to deceive
Serve self the only law, permit no reprieve

In the controlopolis
Checked and balanced, fully unaware

Lucid yet transparent
As clockwork savages
Rats in the mask
Are always just one step away
