Offended by unscathed exterior, unblemished form provokes hysteria.

Self disgust will overpower. Overriding pain acceptance.
Preservation of your cursed hide. Submits to mutilation.

Revel in your attempts, to create the ultimate pain.
Death would undermine, your frenzied theatrics.
No wish for final curtain, or grizzled finale.

Pallor of your healthy flesh, gives the undesired effect.
You'd rather have it raw and crusted.
Reach for the sulphuric acid.

Writhe in burning agony.

Powerless to reject, scarred contentedness.
To ensure pleasure lingers, amputate your fingers.

Revel in your attempts, to create the ultimate pain.
Death would undermine, your frenzied theatrics.
No wish for final curtain, or grizzled finale.

As awareness plummets, into cloudy nothingness.
Enact the final scene, gargling nitro-glycerin.
