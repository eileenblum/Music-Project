Through all seeing eyes, scrutinize the world.
Syndicate of one.
Angered by mankinds affairs.

In his divine wisdom, he laid down the guidelines.
Laws govering existance.
Which mankind dismissed without care.

The deadlines expired - crush them.
With their own evils!

Armed to the teeth power crazed countries.
Levelled by storms of atomic overkill.
Mother nature chastising the corrupt and the selfish.
Unleash the elements in all their fury.

Battered humanity extends it's hand in hope of repentance.

The divine one recoils in defiance, due warning was given.
Divine ultimatium, nothingness prevails.
