Final state, rejuvenate - Acquiring the world...
...of mind without a host - Dreams unfulfilled
Ominous mental man - Leave me bodiless
Percept disincarnate - Physical regress

[CHORUS:]
The Bodiless - Mindforce progress
This scattered Ash - Our Epitaph
The Bodiless - Mentiferous
Tumourous son - Our paragon
Regrowth in wisdom, regrowth in grace
Yet fading flesh
Incongruous to our humanity
Devout and pious

[CHORUS]

"god writes straight with crooked lines.....
.....jesus please us never feed us, god"
Intervenes in our sufferance
Regard without contempt
Deformed, reform the human race
Evolve experiment - Resculpture genetic art
Cauterise an answer - Mutation for amputation
Neoplasm, Cancer - Mnemonic mitigator
Existing without form
A growth of mind darkly saritical
Seraph - The immortal is born
