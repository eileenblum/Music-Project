Grind Bastard - return of the weapon of war
Discharge my stigma
Now I'm back to even the score
Bastard - was condemned through dignity
Mark my soul eternal
Abasing physically

Reduce your will coz I am the Grind Bastard
Fight the world with the strength within
Arise - I am the bastard, I shall win
Debased - revenge on those two faced
Derise - censure guilty I decry.....Opress
Consume - eat your words and siffer
Degrade - humiliate no other
Erode away your futile will
Harass you with exaction
Memorise my calling
I am the bastard, I am the bastard
Though the mills of god grind on....
....they grind so small
A lesson never learned
The bastards never fall

Grind bastard - Rage away 'til teh battle is won
Vex you in your torment
No remorse, grinding on
Bastard - Understand now your life is mine
Dispensing my anger
Flesh is meat, blood is wine
In pain - A world to bthe in sorrow
Grimace - At the Inquisition's horror.....Confess
Intrude - Break the train of your thought
Enrage - Butchered now lie war torn
My principles are to die for

Your end arriving faster
Demonize
I am the bastard, I am the end
Never find distraction
Grinding on reaction
Pain in vain - to retain
The bittersweet one
Rage away in torment
The old ways lie dormant
Your life's mind - Yet sublime
This terror brought from.....Bastard
My needful lust is to direct your fate
Spiteful anger to reciprocate
Obsolete and yet I'm breathing still
Longevity my burden - Immortal kill
Gratitude in my revenge
Accept the fact
Your suffering is all
My vengeance never lacked
What my vengeance never lacked
Share my pleasure - feel my pain
Rational thoughts of a man insane
Septic ways to get me high
Jacking up to watch you die
I'm jacking up to watch you die
I see your torment and anxiety
Recognition of my dignity
There's no survivors
There's no regrets
Nothing more for you to beg...
...except a painless death
Betrayers fear my name
Bastard prophecy
Immortal, I am bound
My eternity
