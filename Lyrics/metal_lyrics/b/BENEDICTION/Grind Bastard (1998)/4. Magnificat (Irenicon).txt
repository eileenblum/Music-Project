Follow the bleeder, undamned you decry
Consummate spirits ne'er follow the lie
Open your heart towards that your mind feels
Death is to conquer all that is surreal
Fortune's enlightenment, hopeful rays of light
Dramatic abundance, shattering the night
Grow biting conflict, halted to an end
The future is certain, the hope we defend
MAGNIFICAT
Up holding the righteous, onward march begun
Deftly remoulding a darkened vision
Strength within unity, mind linking mind
Enveloping beauty, the next humankind
The filth that we all have to climb through
The filth we have to take
Suffering it evermore
Irenicon the wake

"My soul doth magnify......
......my spirit has rejoiced
......remembrance of......mercy...
to his seed forever......"
Yet they lead us to the slaughter
Like they lead a horse to water
They can't force us to drink
But we do
MAGNIFICAT.....Throned
Persevere
So teach us to number our days that we may
Push hearts towards wisdom and fade out the grey
Interventions looming on our dawning world
Hope springs eternal, a hope now unfurled
Persevere.

For Julian.
