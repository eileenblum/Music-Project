Agonising road to ruin
Fright filled roots of soul
Iconoclasmic nightmare watching
Grief now uncontrolled
Uncertain loss, my pain - frustration
Now to reign regret
Wreaking havoc, near undoing
The trauma that dejects

[CHORUS:]
Desolated mindful obstruct
Shattered scream to loudly erupt
Pierce the night, a resoundning crash
Lying dormant, bleeding and gashed

Agonised
Innocence removed fleetingly
Childhood replayed
Remembering the best of times
Still remain dismayed
Near loss of one who's so close
Loving relative
Wishing I could turn the clock back
Lose my will to live

[CHORUS]

Driven to distraction grossly
Morbid mind, it roars
Taken from this mortal coil?
Is the Reaper at the door?
Linear thinking - positive
Yet defeat never stops
Overriding all the senses
Heart begins to drop

[CHORUS]

Agonised
Fear the worst, irrational
Wounds are unsevere
Recovery is imminent
Temped fate now cleared
Relief bringing but emotion
Tears begin to flow
A life was spared from grisly ending
A life still yet to grow

[CHORUS]

Agonised
