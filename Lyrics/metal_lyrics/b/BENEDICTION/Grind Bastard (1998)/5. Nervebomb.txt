Fear is the mind killer, fear will infest
Gratify the nihilist, begin brain arrest
Nervebomb - emaciated nervous tract
Nervebomb - to this torture I react
Panic inside cracking skull
Abrasive aggravate
Forcing through the mental path
Mind exacerbate
Multiplying psychosis
Terrifying rate

Nervebomb - emaciated nervous tract
Nervebomb - to this torture I react
Alienation - Neuropathy
Terminal chaos killing apathy
Neurons converge all as one
Detonation of nervebomb
Fit to burst the pressure mounts
Culmination brain
Overloading neural points
Crucifying pain

Nervebomb - emaciated nervous tract
Nervebomb - to this torture I react
Alienation - Neuropathy
Terminal chaos killing apathy
Neurons converge all as one
Detonation of nervebomb
Neurons conveying impulses
Sensory operate
A morbid thirst they rupture forth
Violence separates
Extreme emotion, suicide
Counting down the ticking time
Repent my florid state
My mental high
Nerve distortion, a massive scale
Mental holocaust
Explosive thoughtless terrorist
Insanity enforced
Storm that raged the human soul
Won over flesh and bone
Trapped forever, caged within
Mental post-war fall-out zone
Nervebomb.
