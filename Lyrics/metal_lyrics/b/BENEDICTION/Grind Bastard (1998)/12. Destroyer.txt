[originally by Twisted Sister]He spent his life a silent sentinel for all to fear
He walks, he talks, he thinks, he feels but no one dare go near
He takes in all he sees, nothing escapes his gaze
And when he strikes, he strikes for right, a glorious sight

Destroyer He is in town

He came to be from a grand mistake, a mystical charade
Created to decide the good and bring repercussive aid
As awareness filled his fame, he examined those who leered
Then he cleaved the air with his fiery stare, rend all those there

A day will come, you'll be drawn into the center of your town
And come upon a mass of steel that cracks the very ground
Prepare to meet your judge, don't think to run away
Just pray your face holds no disgrace for the deadly ace

Destroyer He is in town
You better stay out of his way
He is going to kick your ass
Destroyer
