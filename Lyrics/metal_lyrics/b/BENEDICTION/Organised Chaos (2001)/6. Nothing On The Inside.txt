There is nothing on the inside
A well of emptiness and pain
So totally alone he waits
The rabid dog will have it's day

Revenge is sweet
Retribution bought with a gun

Despised and reviled
Rejection relived within
The beast of hatred born inside
Distorted, disfigured hero's scream

Shattering the silence
Never surrender, never peace
Source bought with blood
Silence the screams with a hail of lead

Vent aggression on the young and pure
There's so alive, but soon to be no more
Burn loving home to ashen shell
Teach the world to know his hell

No more question, no more rules or cause
Pathetic crying ends
Wallowing in misery
Stalk the streets of youth
Forbidden memories of soul starvation
Blast away familiar sights
Erase the sleeping past
Control

Cannot stem the angry tide
Crushed by hatred's weight
There's sorrow for those who have died
Random lives to obviate

Revenge is sweet
Retribution bought with a gun
Solace bought with blood
Silence the screams with a hail of lead

Bullet enters mindless brain
You die as you deserve
Pathetic fuck on a pool of blood
Expires alone in despair

You'll see the world will have it's revenge
Fate's blackened smile
A world of pain to balance the scales
For you who's walked anarchy's mile
