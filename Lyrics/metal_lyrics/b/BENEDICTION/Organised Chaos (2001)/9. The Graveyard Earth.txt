Since the dawn of time the clock's been ticking
Ultimately flawed, man could never survive
An unhealing wound in the side of the earth
A rotten canker that assumes it's divine

There's no divinity in man, just flesh and blood
When you die you do nothing but rot
The blind path leads onward to extinction
Genetic time bomb detonates â armageddon

This graveyard earth, disaster waiting to happen
A brave new world, with no more need for guilt
Freedom at last, break the chains of oppression
No meaning in the end, so do as thou wilt

2000 years of slavery
The time has come, revolution's at hand
A storm of fire, that will ignite the earth
My will's my own, not some god's to command!

I am my own god!

So now we reclaim what is rightfully ours
All gods be damned, nothing stands in our path
Liberated, eyes open wide we are
No more a race of fools, we are but flesh for the worms

A war continues in the name of destruction
No quarter ever given, no quarter allowed
Compromise a word with no meaning for us
In the cries of the enemy let justice be found

And so we stand in the light of a new dawn
Nuclear fires scorching the horizon
The time ahead become a time of rebirth
To recreate man in the image of man

Fuck you all, you won't make me believe
Your foolish prophecies only good to deceive
I'll kill myself before you make me agree
With a single fucking word you say...

You'll never make me believe!

Never...
