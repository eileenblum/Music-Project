There's a price we all pay to Charon
A price we pay for the ride
You're damned if you do, damned if you don't
Nothing remains but emaciated pride
The urge for self destruction
Again drags you into the pit
Bristling with agony once more
A voice deep inside your head screams âFUCK IT!â

Spiralling annihilation
Descent into the abyss
A boiling, blackened violence and hatred
Some fucker's gonna pay for this!
A victimless crime of passion
Or rape of mind and soul
Or the bastard even destroys himself
Violence and drugs to fill the aching hole

The aching hole
Consume to liberate
Pour liquid fire on the pain
Years of frustration finally went
A hate so strong it's driven me insane
Anyone could be the target
And I've got time to kill...
How far salvation seems from me now
One last laugh at anyone who can feel
