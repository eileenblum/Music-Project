Deep in the darkest mental recess
There dwelt a force within the abscess
That you called fear
You were never alone

One final victim's dying dreams
An ecstasy of filth and screams
Emancipated nightmares
On a bloodied floor of dead prayers

In the walls you've built around your feeble mind
I'll sleep through the cracks
Think of me as something you can control
But not predict the backlash
Suppressed inside, pent up terror mounts
You created me
Ghastly automaton exacerbates your plight
Your suffering feeds me!

Now we, we are become the force
The denotative urge
Irrepressible the slayers revolt
O how this worms have turned
Forever repressed, imprisoned for being born
Antimony incarnate
The bastard, prodigal son returns
Bearing gifts to decimate

No more the false enlightenment
Only your death
Revealed
Blood seeking redress
You cry out all you like
There's noone to care
Rotting in a prison that you built from lies

Revisiting your crimes at source
With not a shred of regret
You brought this torture upon yourself
Suffering pain begets
Inflict no more, you wretched fool
Your time is it an end
Divinity a forsaken dream
A rubicon you'll never transcend
