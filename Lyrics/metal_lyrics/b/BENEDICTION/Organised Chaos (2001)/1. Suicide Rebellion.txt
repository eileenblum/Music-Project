Scale the walls of hopelessness
Lungs breath blackened tar
Abusive instinct takes control
No more hope left under darkened star

Staring down a bottomless pit

No escape, no way out
The only way through is down
Cannot speak, cannot move
Inarticulate, we drown
Failure's asexual breed
Life of swine become disease
Better and twisted inside
Worship my god of fear

Face the facts, everything dies in the end

Always brave on the outside
Smiling in the face of despair
Blood courses through constricted veins
Silent screams, gasping for air

Burning blade enters prepared skin
Crimson life flows from within
Welcoming releasing blood
Rivers deep to the desperate sea
Flow...

Yet choices made are not reversed
Persistence in the face of nothingness
Courage to endure despair
Survive, revenge, redress
Floods of blood wash nothing clean
Begin within on the path to redeem
Locking back at a beleaguered past
Something inside changed

So much time ahead
So much that can be done
Speaking words in unknown tongues
Presaging armageddon's son

Pressure building up inside
Something has no give
Vanquish all fear, nowhere to hide
Become the master, choose to live

I choose to damn well live!

Never more to be trodden down
Before noone to kneel

Heart, once frozen, trapped in ice
Now boiling molten steel!

Highest self to vindicate
All cause of doubt to eradicate
Seize control, force mental state
Seconds counting down to detonate

Return to those who would oppress
The way of advance lies through regress
Old enemies made to feel violent caress
Pay it all back with interest

At last, it seems, a return to peace
Destructive urges finally cease
There's still anger, but now it's part of me
I'll never die so easily!
