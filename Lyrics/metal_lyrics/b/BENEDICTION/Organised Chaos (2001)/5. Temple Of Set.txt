Temple of Set

Exorcise inadequacy
Depravity disrepair
Alleviate unthinking plight
Ontologically unfair

Dualistic minds
In a twisted reality
Flesh and senses reunite
Monodichronic consanity

Existence is confinement
Borders to be cast down

The coward's laws lie raped
A butchered priest lies phone
Betrayer, know that we'll respect
No laws but our fucking own

Rusted edifice
Neolithic dreamtime's end
Seize the source
Salvation's divident
Reap the beheld
Reborn through force of will
We're witnessing the end of time

In the temple of Set

Converge within the primacy
Contiguity once more
The disparate remade a whole
Elimination flawed

Carnal desire rules
Lust for flesh dominates

Only flesh dominates

All barriers overruled
We are one
Committed to no supine god
State of permanent confusion

Come join the bacchanalian feast
Orgiastic, all pleasures perversely released
No law to deny us our lust
All that which was divine
Blasted into dust!

In the temple of Set
