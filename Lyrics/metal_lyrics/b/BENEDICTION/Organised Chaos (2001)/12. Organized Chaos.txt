Abstract anger, the hateful game
Injecting drugs of chaos again
A stand-up addict, I cannot control
A seething mass, and it's all falling down

Relative, isolated
Some great truth unfound
Cruelty, unhealthy obsession
Nihilism screams â fuck the world!

New breed!
Where is the new breed?

One more shot, a last cigarette...
...for tomorrow we die
Existence as punishment
Unspeakable, unthinkable belief

So jack up and wither
In your pretext vortex
Maggot addict, on the floor again
It is yours to undercome
Mislocated, the place, the wrong time
Sinews ripped by talons
Filthy, broken, inadequate
Feel the worms under your skin

New breed...
Here is your new breed of spite!

Derision, I hear the laugh
A worm is in your gust, writhing
Effacing the face of disgust
I have nothing to lose
I will gave as I have received
No second hand justice hare
The shattered empire of the real
Dystopic nightmare is born again

Exorcise the demon
Abandon all hope, ye who enter her
Terrifying eyes, they see too much
Alone, sweating, madness, fear
An image of abject suffering
Never to flourish, never to grow
Toiling in the darkness
Kneel and scrape in the dirt

Articulate such misery
Wretched feculent hole
A tearstained smile, a glimmer of hope
Crushed like all the rest

New breed
Where is the new breed...?
