Crawl on our knees through the gutter
From an untimely demise
By remission of all sins
Forsaking old and wise

Violation of domain

An area of conquest
Which only we have one
Don't stagnate within your self
Transcend the Rubicon

Suffering, torment, anguish, pain

At life's shore slowly breaks the waves
Turn of the tides, revenance of rage

Blistering so were the thoughts
When shackled to a wall
Flagrant ways of conformation
Your death sentence appalled
Now plead for a worthless life
Deny us for your guilt
Escape within the stoney tomb
Which you yourself have built

Independence of a drug
To satisfy the need
Orgies filled with travesty
To sow all mocking seeds
Originality the one
Who's screaming at the crime
Sinister the ways of wisdom
Expand or face the fire
Sterile splinter of self doubt
Thorn in your boney hide
Counterfeit within adept
Colossal is the pride
Breeding cynicism
Grandeur crying in your face
Overture derisive laughter
Hateful human race

Incantation of your thoughts
Upon this mortal coil
Open wide the jaws of hate
Serving them so loyal
Reeking contradiction
When you're laughing as you fail
Believing in your innocence
Tells a sorrowed tale
Autumn fall upon a life
This season at an end
Darkened shadows all around
And yet without a friend
Realisation dawns on you
It's time for you to face

Hateful human race
