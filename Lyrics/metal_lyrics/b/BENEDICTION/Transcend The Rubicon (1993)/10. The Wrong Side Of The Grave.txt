Another sun has set in the distant sky
As evil creatures awake to arise tonight
Their slumber disturbed by an ignorant youth
Looking for kicks ignoring the truth
They have come from the wrong side of the grave
Decapitate the living from the wrong side of the grave
Skin hangs peeling blackened, rotten and torn
Evil man creature new life has been born
Eating your flesh grinding your hide
Death like razors blood flows like high tide
