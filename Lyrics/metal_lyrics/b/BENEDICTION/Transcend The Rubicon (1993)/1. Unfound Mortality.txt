Normalicy in threat evermore
Taken apart within the mental core
By ones who walk the wounded land
Uncanny destiny so damned
Mortal eccentricity
Overrule the weird in alacrity
Contradiction tragedy pays
Immortal, shallow, fearless and empty ways

Following a hollow Grail
Men from nowhere shall prevail

Now oblivion waits
Horrendous earth raped eternal
Men from nowhere

Look through their minds eye
What do you see?
A rigid life, indefinitely
Innumerable victims
Cry in vain
Disintegrate in residual pain

Perished shrouded terror
Targets uncertainty
Hunt carries on
Gains predictability
Touched by the dead
A pre-determined soul
Final abnormality
Sounding on in a lifeless death toll

Tine's a way for them to waste
Our existence bloom
Strive for sanity
Amentia's doom

Normality obscured within
Hideous errors rapidly erased
New open wound has embowelled
Remains enraged

No stranger men have walked the earth
In such a lucid form
Victimise abnomalies
And defecating norm
Afraid to die a second time
So living in fear
Enforcing strange supremacy
Until their vision's clear

Men from nowhere
