There's a disease a wrenching bane
Adverse twisted minds
Grip of fear within the flesh
Is eating you alive
Ruins the lives of innocent
A fitful waking sleep
Sadly the world it shakes it's head
And begins to weep

And now to sleep perchance to dream
But you cannot hear your cries
Memories run like rivers flow
Blackened waters of the mind
Phobias, fear of crypts and caves
Oblivion denied

All you see such a lie to behold
Born through a cradle of time
Stomach wrenching, sweat runs cold
Pointless nightmares of bizarre and sublime

Summon them now, arise your fears
Release the pain or drown
Acidic noise like knell of doom
Darkened passages revealing gloom

Nightfear

Creeping on the skulls of man
Softly at the dawn
Sharpened edge of nightfears blade
Pray you now for rising morn

Divine faith a childish prayer
Drilled into you from birth
Yet nightfear continues on
Returning with a curse
Now the fortitudes in light
But darkened eve draws near
Dawning on a ghoulish thought
The night belongs to fear
