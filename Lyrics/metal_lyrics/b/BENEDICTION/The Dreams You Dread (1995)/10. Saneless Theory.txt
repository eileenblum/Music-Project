Obscure opression, from within
Controlled behavious
Mass suppression in complex systems
Dictate before the birth

[Chorus :]
Underlying confusion
Life breaks free
A mournful expansion
Saneless Theory

Those detractors unnatural order
Erratic recursion of thought
Irrational change, the aspect of life
Chaotic order sought

[Chorus]

Regularity / Random
Fractal complexity
Witness sterile fluctuation
Saneless Theory

Ruling powers assimilate
Overshadow, subjugate
No predictions an unfound dream
Egress reality

Yet deviations are amplified
Into chaotic theme
Enter Chaos !

Their passionate numbness
Ascetic credibly
Hidden in the emerging field of
Saneless Theory.
