In oceans of light
Haunts the bleak river
Mindless spectre
Summons malice without thought

[Chorus :]
Insane paradox of dreams gone awry
Stalked and thrown onto funeral pyres

Yeah,
The wrathful one
A screaming sea, fould shore

[Chorus]

Sound without substance
Whispers softly and low
The waters speak and roar
Echoes in the skull
Each drop a human soul
Born from tragedy
Drowning victims amplify
It's desire to conceive

[Chorus]

Seek the lake of voices
Fluid chorus of loss
Destroyed in order
Created in chaos

Smothered !
Identity cast to the flow
Slave !
To water's illusion
Your body dissolves
Fettered !
Existance to the whole
Never break !
The walls between the realms

Flesh wound never bleed
But yearn for the depths
Agony, there's no peace
Even in death
Dark wisdom brings power
An illusion deceived
Union of fellow souls
I wept as it entered me

Insane paradox of dreams gone awry
Stalked and thrown onto funeral pyres
