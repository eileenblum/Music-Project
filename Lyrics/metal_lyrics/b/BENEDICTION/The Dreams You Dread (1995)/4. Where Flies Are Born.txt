Our unity of war and art
Lost the human creed
Here you're no more than a shade
Of blood that never bleeds

The silence breaks, the die is cast
Ignore our final pleas
Engage insanity
World falls to it's knees

Sound the knell of jealousy
Unheard dying's scron
Genocide prodigiously
Where flies are born

Warhorse died on this impure realm
Defiant in it's death
Smelled the fragrant bitter blood
And draws it's final breath
Begin the crimson dust decay
Commence the fall of light
Atavistic human trait
Born of chaotic night

Blood pain [x2]

Tranquill peace attained by strife
Now all is lost
Season of the ice arrives
The killing frost

Blood pain [x2]
