Release me
Erupting
Break out from the Bleakhouse
Fractured mind
Four in one, my storm
Escape my fantasies
Hollow hear of my disease
Angered psychopath unbound
Control my mind's common ground

I'm avenging a hurt
Damn the worms within my brain
Causing me to suffer pain
Mental imagery imposed
My psyche's falling... down

I'm avenging a hurt
Pulsing along channels
Alive with phantom humming
Sweting like a rapist
I cannot avoid becoming

Too much reality in my make believe mind
I am dead, but the four live... on

See blood everywhere
Can't control our vision
Forever we're the Ghoul
Eternal mental prison
