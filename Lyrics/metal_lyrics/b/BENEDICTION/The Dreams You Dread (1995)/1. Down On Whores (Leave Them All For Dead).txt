"What they have in store for them...
... do I desire..."
"They will suffer just as I...
... revenge on the whore."

[Chorus :]
Take the eyes, take the head
leave them all for dead."

"My hands are cold...
... my heart... is colder still"
"I will take the bitch tonight...
The children are well."

[Chorus]

"The gentle man... the whore in in debt...
They are blind as they say"
"Turn round three times
and catch whom you may."

"May comes and goes in the dark of the night.
He kisses and whores and gives them a fright.
... and the Doctors will get all the blame
but it's only May playing his dirty game."
"... ha ha..."

"Rip the bitch wide...
... left my mark...
... had a got at her eyes."
"The pain that night...
... burnt into my mind.
... recall ... to stop my cries."
"... ha ha ..."

"... when I cut her...
kissed... for a while.
... shale I write and tell them...
... peace of mind."

"Left her for dead...
there was thrill.
All whores... feel the ... shining knife

Sir Jim with the shining knife."
"I give my name that all know of me,
so history do tell...
... a gentle man born..."

[Chorus]
