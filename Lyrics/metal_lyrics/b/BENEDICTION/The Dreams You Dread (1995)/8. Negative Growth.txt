Benign, the human form
Malignancy disease
Metastasis major cause
Migration of the beast

Tumour
Invasion

Into the strem
Disturbed balance of life
Trigger wound response

And await to die
Outright attack
Prognosis made
And the growth will spread
As cells break away
Blistering assault on pure
Gnawing into cells
Slow disease, yet so demure
Struggling you ail

Insidious disease
Evicts me from my life
Disfiguring, absurd
The inner parasite

Soul destroying, my skin crawls
Unseen, my body fights a war

Dig deep the healthy flesh
My miserable remnant
Ruined by this ruthless waste
Paying my penance
Reproduce so disorderly
Through bloodstream malignance flows
Detected early, a surgical cure
Perchance a growth in the bones

Blistering assault on pure
Gnawing into cells
Slow demise, and so demure
Listen, funeral bells
