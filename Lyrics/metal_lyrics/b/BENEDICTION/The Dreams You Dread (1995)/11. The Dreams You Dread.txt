Gross abominations
Dreams that haunt your sleep
Dying to awaken
Unheard cries you weep
Inner vision drowning
Shredding terrors nears
Clogging lungs you're choking on
Hallucinogenic fears

[Chorus :]
Incubus, disturbing nightmare
Locked inside your head
Assassinating rational thought
The dreams you dread

Oppose the phobid landscape or you'll
Suffer anxiety
Self witch - hunting pretrifies
Aghast reality

[Chorus]

Your own agression
Generates the dreams you dread

[Chorus]
