Such a gruesome bleeding heart
Stabbing against the thrust
Those vicous memories
Of broken trust
The bitter food of hatred
I will force feed
You'll suffer my indifferrence
Answer to me
My faith in you destroyed
By hypocrisy
It retards your thinking
Answer to me
Retard your thinking
Answer to me

Broken chains of honesty
Fallen without grace
I return the favour
On your second face
I am not the reason
Deceit reigned within
Since you cast the first stone
Are you without sin ?

Scutinize - NO !
Retard your thinking
Carrion ways, no power to judge
Brimmed with aggressive scorn
Damn your name, forever wish
You were never born
Tragedy - Your obsession
Retard your thinking -
My oppression
Sympathize - NO !
Retard your thinking

The final remnants erased
Your identity
Retard your thinking
