Writhing in pain
Your third eye blinks, untamed
We were one to live
Now there's but grief you give

Griefgiver

Dread the hurt
Crush me in the dirt
Panic, extol
Angers my mind and soul
Evolve, inherent living hate
We divide as you subjugate
Disreguard, pre-empt the deed
To avenge I'll not concede

Griefgiver

Evolve, inherent living hate
We divide as you subjugate
You proclaim grief to me
My existance, your disease

Evolve, inherent living hate
To amend is far too late
Enraged inside your grip
Now alone, your power trip

Griefgiver
