I never knew it would feel likes this
Falling into the black abyss of nothing
Function loses all meaning, Engine shutting down
Desperate ideals set in, Body Breaks Down
Apathy covers my soul, Helplessness grows deep
My walls fall down
My body is led to obliteration
I am no longer in control
There is nothing to do but breathe
Blood circulating finding a way
Fighting to stay awake
The voices the sounds
the darkness fills my world
Desperate measures at times like these
Brought to my knees, Fighting to gain control
Demons scratching ripping me inside out
Death all around me
Angels of darkness lead the way
Empty my flesh of plague
There is no light just dark the flames gone out
Goodnight goodbye
