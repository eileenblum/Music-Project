Born from frost sovereign of all
Hail the battle approaching
Living near the gates near shadows of war
A world from the remains arise
Ravens cloud the sky wood and iron in hand
Devoured by wolves avenged by the sun
The sacrifice hung from the tree awaits
Life for life ends to nature
Ritual
Thought and memory closing in
Kings of famine marked with blood
Arise fury of battle
Behold the children of war
Ritual Arise
Arise brood of war bearer of the storm
Onward to the gates the storm is approaching
