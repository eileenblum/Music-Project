Innate devouring subconscious desolation
The desire of sorrow an affliction of mine
Eternal restraint bind my wrists
To an existence or perverse devotion
Deception
Crossing through my desolation
Abandoned on hells half acre
I've been led astray
passion in solitude
Confine my eyes
I'll concede tomorrow
I'm consumed by fire
Betrayal fragments into ashes
Betrayal internal contortion
This is my fall from grace
