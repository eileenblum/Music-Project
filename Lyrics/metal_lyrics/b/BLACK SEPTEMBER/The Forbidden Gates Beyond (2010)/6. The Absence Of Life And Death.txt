Eyes ahead through the bite of the frozen wind 
A tower of form shown through the mist 
A triple crowned wing of six pours forth blood fire and death 
A malicious serpent piercing the world 
The banners of the king of hell advance 
Awaken the behemoth with shrieks of hell fire 
The time has come 
Ride the wings of death through the flaming world 
Take the banner on high 
Ride the wings of death through the flaming world 
We march with no return 
Take the banner on high 
We march with no return 
Born in fire 
Primal breath 
Banished guide to the cliffs beyond 
External exile 
We march with no return 
Fumes from the river hover overhead like vast shadows 
Birds of prey guard the shores 
Primal breath fills my lungs 
Ride the wings of death through the flaming world 
Take the banner on high 
Ride the wings of death through the flaming world 
We march with no return 
Born in fire 
Primal breath 
Banished guide to the cliffs beyond 
Born in fire 
Banished guide 
External exile 
We march with no return
