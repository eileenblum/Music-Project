Crashing forth upon the soil 
Filthy waves gave way to open plains 
Immense flakes of fire and ash settled like snow on a windless terrain 
Desolation swallows us whole 
Tombs lit by single flames 
At least you stand alone 
Reveal my path 
A luminous eye sees all 
Tombs lit by single flames 
Our knowledge is dead 
Our awareness will exist no more once these graves are sealed 
The true way is unseen in these shrouds of black 
Mark my words a single finger raised to the sky 
A shade rose from the depths with a bellow of fear 
This blind prison leads astray 
The future is sealed 
At least you stand alone 
Reveal my path 
Luminous eyes see all 
Tombs lit by single flames 
A stench too impure to inhale came from beyond the valley summoning our course 
The knowledge is dead 
Our awareness will exist no more once these graves are sealed
