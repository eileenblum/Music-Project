The dark holds me without sight 
A demigod among flesh 
I summon thee with a tongue of flame 
For my return release these chains 
Bearer of deprived light 
Nothing sacred in this skin 
Terror in the flesh 
Disdain your penance 
In slumber I dwell awaiting return 
Release me from this tomb 
I summon thee with a tongue of flames 
For my return release these chains 
Hear my cry unleash these chains 
I shall be the last to remain 
In slumber I dwell awaiting return 
Release me from this tomb 
I will reclaim what once was ours 
Your empire is doomed 
Eye for an eye 
I shall bring ruination 
Eye for an eye 
I shall bring ruination
