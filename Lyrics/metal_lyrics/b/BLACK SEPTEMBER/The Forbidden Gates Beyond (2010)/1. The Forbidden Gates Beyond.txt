Fortify for war at days final light 
Realms of death await 
Feed into the silence 
Behold the beast 
Death is little more 
My ascension denied 
He shall feed on wisdom and valor 
Through me is the way into the suffering city 
Claims of second death 
Through me the way into eternal grief 
Enclosed by flame search for sacred light 
Amid legions of blood and tear streamed faces 
The dark earth convulsed 
We moved to the gates beyond 
Out of the quiet 
Into the trembling air 
I have come to a place absent of light 
An icon of cruelty and guilt at the gate 
And in such a moment destruction was sewn 
Ravenous thunder beckons our pace as we descend 
Accursed wolf feast upon yourself with rabid hunger 
Hymns of despair deep in their throats 
The eternal fire in the valley below stains the city walls 
Fortify for war at days final light 
Realms of death await
Feed into the silence
