A voice thundered in the distance 
The abyss below held a swarm of serpents and men 
Men of blood and anger 
Bound by creatures of misery and venom 
Blasphemous rage erupted toward the heavens above 
A serpent assault enclosed the life 
Creation of chaos
Rebirth as a beast of man 
Wound upon wound 
Shadow suppressed 
Creation of chaos 
Rebirth as a beast of man 
A remade serpent of sin returns to the vile mass 
Binding the human form 
Encased by darkness and flame 
A feral soul hissing in the thriving legion 
Bound to the mass of pain 
Confined in the surging horde 
Buried but breathing 
A serpent assault enclosed the life 
Creation of chaos 
Rebirth as a beast of man 
Wound upon wound 
Shadow suppressed 
Creation of chaos 
Rebirth as a beast of man
