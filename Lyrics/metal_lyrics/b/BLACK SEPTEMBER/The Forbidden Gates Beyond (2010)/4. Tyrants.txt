The abyss poured off the upper rim of the high bank 
Down to a river of blood 
The infamy gnawed his own flesh 
The foul depth shook 
The world has been steered back to chaos 
What torment has brought you to this vile land 
His own blood an instrument of vengeance 
Drenched in blood and plunder 
Lend us one who can tame our passage 
To the forest of poison thorns 
One who fears naught cruelty and death 
Pass to the edge of the unknown 
Come now death 
Come at once 
I prepare my final passage 
The end is near 
Come now death 
Come at once  
Descending into black air 
The end is near 
Lend us one who can tame our passage to the forest of poison thorns 
What torment has brought you to this vile land 
His own blood an instrument of vengeance 
Numbers drenched in the vast ditch 
These were tyrants who spent their lives drenched in blood and plunder 
Lend us one who can tame our passage to the forest of poison thorns 
One who fears naught cruelty and death 
Pass to the edge of the unknown 
Come now death 
Come at once 
I prepare my final passage 
The end is near 
Come now death 
Come at once 
Descending into black air 
The end is near
