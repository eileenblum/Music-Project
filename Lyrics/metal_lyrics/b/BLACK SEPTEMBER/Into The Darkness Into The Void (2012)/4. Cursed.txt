Staring into the abyss of the night
This emptiness haunts me
The flood of endless drowning to which
I know no cure
It flows through my blood and shrouds my vision
A hunger which no feast can heal
My internal curse
Its poison binds all
Devours me from within
My weakness and my strength
Chained in this darkness
There is no escape
Inner tension surges through every limb
Collapsing in upon itself
The light swallowed all devouring my soul
I have become my curse
There is no escape
Staring into the abyss of the night
This emptiness haunts me
The flood of endless drowning to which
I know no cure
My weakness and my strength
Chained in this darkness
There is no escape
Inner tension surges through every limb
Collapsing in upon itself
The light swallowed all devouring my soul
I have become my curse
There is no escape
