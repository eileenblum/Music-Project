Fearless into the dark
Blind to the terrors that await
Nothing to guide my path
Emptiness remains
Concealed in solitude
I await
Salvation behind the hidden walls
Vengeance flows through my veins
The absence feeds my hunger
Enter the void stalked by pale death
I see the darkness glaring back at me
Abandon the burning world behind
Shadows overcome
No light left to hide
The path behind me has been consumed
This black air gives rebirth once again
Shed your grievance pain and sorrow and carry forth onto unhallowed ground
Past the black horizon lies the land in my dreams
Revelations of the mind appear before my eyes
Foundations of the world collapse below my feet as
I descend further into the unknown
Enter the void stalked by pale death
I see the darkness glaring back at me
Abandon the burning world behind
Shadows overcome
No light left to hide
The path behind me has been consumed
This black air gives rebirth once again
Shed your grievance pain and sorrow and carry forth onto unhallowed ground

Past the black horizon lies the land in my dreams
Revelations of the mind appear before my eyes
The foundations of the world collapse below my feet as
I descend further into the unknown
