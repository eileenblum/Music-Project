Awaken me from darkness
Let your possession take hold
Purify this blood
Deliver me from flames
Let them light my way into eternity
I surrender to your will
Take hold and let us become one with the void
Bring the end of my past life
I shall transcend this chaos
It shall hold me no longer
Lead me to the point of no return
The forbidden gates are open
I am the sacrifice
Hear my call
I shall become one with the abyss
I welcome thee with open arms
Make us one
Bring the end of my past life
I shall transcend this chaos
It shall hold me no longer
Lead me to the point of no return
The forbidden gates are open
I am the sacrifice
Hear my call
I shall become one with the abyss
I welcome thee with open arms
Make us one
