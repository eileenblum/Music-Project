In fire and flame the light remains cold
The sun shall never rise again upon these lands
The hollow souls have long been forgotten
Let the shadows ascend
Hear the cries of the past
The whispers travel upon the wind
I have come to awaken these ancient tombs
Rise upon these bitter winds to claim the throne beyond the grave
Come forth through black rain and walk again upon withered earth
The world we once knew shall end
The internal battle shall begin
Set the fire that shall purify these hidden vaults
Flames shall cleanse the walls of the tombs
Let the temple that once was rot away
In fire and flame the light remains cold
The sun shall never rise again upon these lands
The hollow souls have long been forgotten
Let the shadows ascend
Hear the cries of the past
The whispers travel upon the wind
Come forth through black rain and walk again upon withered earth
The world we once knew shall end
The internal battle shall begin
Set the fire that shall purify these hidden vaults
Flames shall cleanse the walls of the tombs
Let the temple that once was rot away
