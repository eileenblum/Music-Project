The night beckons with rabid hunger driving me onward into the lurid night
My descent stalked by scavengers
Decaying remains circling above
Demise lurks behind the shrouds of mist
My final call is beside me lurking in the shadows
Deliver me beyond this torment
Take me past the horizons
Beyond the light
Carry me on wings of black towards barren graves
Bury my remains in the cold earth
I shall rest from the eternal wrath
One step from drowning in darkness
Towards the death of life
The foul air hangs above the soil and invokes my course
Releasing me from the cold grip of death
My final call is beside me lurking in the shadows
Deliver me beyond this torment
Take me past the horizons
Beyond the light
Carry me on wings of black towards barren graves
Bury my

Remains in the cold earth
I shall rest from eternal wrath
One step from drowning in darkness
Towards the death of life
