Abandoned at last light with a soul on fire
Worship the cold embrace
Fear resides in the darkness around me
The suffering tears from the inside
Called from beyond
I am the hunter
Heed the calling
Relentless lashes
I cannot escape
Vengeance defines my passage
Staring into the starless night
It haunts my every step
Ruination marks my path of solitude
Called from beyond
I am the hunter
The exile of no return
I belong to the night
Heed the calling from the distance
It calls me through deafening winds leading me down
Relentless lashes that
I cannot escape
Vengeance defines my passage
Striking out into desolate terrain
Fear resides in the darkness around me
Staring into the starless night
It haunts my every step
Ruination marks my path of solitude
Called from beyond
I am the hunter
The exile of no return
I belong to the night
Heed the calling from the distance
It calls me through deafening winds leading me down
