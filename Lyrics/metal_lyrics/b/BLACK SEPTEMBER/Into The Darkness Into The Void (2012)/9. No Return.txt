Guide me beyond the gates
The time for eternal rest is near
The final call echoes through the dark
I have become apart of the end
Bearing down
Closing in
Unleashed chaos takes hold
Ravenous and pure
Our time has come
The fear has lead us to these feral lands
Let it consume and tear us away from the worlds of old
Behold the other side built from the past
It has come for me
I shall not return for the void now lives in these eyes
I have been taken by the shadows of the deep
The dark has come alive within my skin
The final call echoes through the dark
I have become apart of the end
Bearing down
Closing in
Unleashed chaos takes hold
Let it consume and tear us away from the worlds of old
Behold the other side built from the past
It has come for me
I shall not return for the void now lives in these eyes
I have been taken by the shadows of the deep
The dark has come alive within my skin
The final call echoes through the dark
I have become apart of the end
I shall not return
