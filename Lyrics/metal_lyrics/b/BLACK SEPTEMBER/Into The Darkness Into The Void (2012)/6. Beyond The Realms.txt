Reveal my path
Grant me blind sight in the darkness
Guide me beyond the realms of life and death
The land fades away as
I descend
The realm of my dreams has taken me
The cold dark drapes my skin
One last breath
One final sight
This viscous absence is cursed
Into the darkness
Into the void
Through the darkness the shadows stir
Their emptiness resides in the bottomless depths
Rise from the black air and prepare for the passage to the other side
Messengers from the depths
Bringers of the plague
Guide me beyond the realms of life and death
The cold dark drapes my skin
One last breath
One final sight
This viscous absence is cursed
Into the darkness
Into the void
Through the darkness the shadows stir
Their emptiness resides in the bottomless depths
Rise from the black air and prepare for the passage to the other side
Through the darkness the shadows stir
Their emptiness resides in the bottomless depths
Rise from the black air and prepare for the passage to the other side
