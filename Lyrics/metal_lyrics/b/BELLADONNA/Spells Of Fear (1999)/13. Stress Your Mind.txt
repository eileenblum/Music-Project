[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Brains are divided
In two separate pairs
Pressure of force
Walk the dead
Proportion of sound
Cuttin' your head
By compulsion, distress

Don't stress your mind
Impulses
It will make you mean
Don't make your mind overflow
Don't draw the line, sober
You'll grit your teeth
Don't stress your mind no more

Harder you press
The more you will stress
The greater the step to intense
Right by the temple
You flirt with your success
Pray, I don't need this shit

Divin' Drivin'
Divin' Drivin'
There's no limit
Hold on tightly
