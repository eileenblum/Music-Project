[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Type one memo
Arm rest level
Harmless fly on the wall
Seems so blinded
Blinds rolled down
Help me to focus
The way to hell
Release the blindfolds
Release the blindfolds
Right down to the hot coal
Right down to the hot coal

Why leave me there alone
Take it to see the sky

[CHORUS]
Choose between the good and the bad
Now you're lost underground
Now you've lost everything
That you had
Cause you're lost underground
Cause it's a long way down
Cause it's a long way down
Choose between the good and the bad
Now you're lost underground

Bribe won't make it
No forgiveness
Soon your fate's in line
Erase the crime cord
Erase the side show
Right down to the dark hole
Right down to the dark hole

Why leave me there all alone
Take it to see the sky

[CHORUS]

Cause it's a long way down
Cause it's a long way down
Cause it's a long way down
From your face
Turn your eyes
Without knowing
Then you fall
You lie

What does it have to take
Will it make you learn
You believe in the hell
Fool

[CHORUS]
