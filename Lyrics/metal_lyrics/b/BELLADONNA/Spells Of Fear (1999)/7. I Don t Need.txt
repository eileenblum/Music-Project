[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

I beg you
I'm no treasure
Mixed review
Let me go
Without dropping me
I'm on a tightrope
Without a net
Alone with my life
Bracing me
Across that line
Importing tone

Throw me a line
Throw me a line

I don't need
I don't need
I don't need
I don't need
It's all on me
The pressure on me
I don't need
I don't need
I want to live

Trust me
I swear
Please throw me a line
Considering the pressure
Strengthen my hold
Providing that it's over
Runnin' through my head
Writing on the ground
I'm never going down
I'm never going down
