[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Corresponding
Astound
Startled and dumbfound
Misfortune
Youth
Discomfort
Don't be fooled by the way
Dreadful sound
Many ways to feel this
Underneath the grind

Gruesome sound
Simmer down

I'm on the loose
I've lost control
Oh by the way
I'm on a roll
I'm on the loose
I've lost my soul
I'm on the way
I'm on the go
I've lost control
Lost control
Lost control

Nervous and I'm pale
Indication of life
Pass me by
Should I know to avoid it
Should I know to prove it
Respect these feelings
Over and over again

Gruesome sound
Simmer down

I'm dishonored
In disguise
Mindless guidance
Weightless response
Lost my mind
