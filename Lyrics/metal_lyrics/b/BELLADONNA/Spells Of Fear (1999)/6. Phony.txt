[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

It's a self profit
By the looks of you turned away
Seems that I've been down
Time and time again
Now show me something
That I don't already know
I'm the man in motion
Try to find the way out

I smell a phony
You're every bit a phony
I met a phony
Don't breathe on me
Don't get close to me
I met a phony
Met a phony

Often times I fold
Rollin' down the hill
Never look at me in the eye
I don't ever know you
You never really ever knew me
It's the one time I'm not surprised
Please allow me to give you tokens

Goin' down
It's over
You're out of your mind
Wave good-bye
You'll be walkin' the line
I'll be on the other side
Wave good-bye
