[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Push to the limit
Now get me involved
This time I'll be there
Arrive on my own
Guide my emotions
The wild eye stands alone
When I catch you
You'll find a mess
One less beggar
You stand alone
Now you can kiss your ass good-bye

You lock up the question of faith
Try'n open up the door

Must be jokin'
You're outspoken
You're the problem I'm facing
Must be jokin'
You're provoking
Poor conditions
Is fatal

One thing I fear
Is the fear on your face
High time I think it's self-hate
Tell you once
Should I tell you again
Find it's time to eliminate

You lock up the question of faith
Try'n open up the door
Must be jokin'
You're outspoken
You're the problem I'm facing
Must be jokin'
You're provoking
Poor condition is fatal

Nightmare
Nightmare
Nightmare

Must be jokin'
You're outspoken
You're the problem I'm facing
Must be jokin'
You're provokin'
Poor conditions
Is fatal
Must be jokin'
You're outspoken
You're the problem I'm facin'
