[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Several places bother me
Can't replace the memories

You scare me half to death
You brace your soul to rest

Two way road doesn't exist
Might as well say it's over
Breakin' hearts
People stare

You scare me half to death
You brace your soul to rest

Everywhere I turn seems I got to face you
Every place I look I can't erase you
Everywhere I turn seems I gotta face you
To whom it may concern I can't take you
You got me surrounded
Always hounded

Forbidden disgrace is overbearing me
Trample lessons all we learn
Slam me closed
Hold me in

You scare me half to death
You brace your soul to rest
(Been there)

Dependent free from doubt
Surround conditions of life
Pat me down
Cover

You scare me half to death
You brace your soul to rest

Everywhere I turn seems I go to face you
Every place I look I can't erase you
To whom it may concern I can't take you
You got me surrounded
Always hounded
Hounded

You scare me half to death
You brace your soul to rest
