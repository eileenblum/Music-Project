[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

I might be lucky
I might be late
Look out
I'm unleaded
Extremely fast
No matter what scale
Smooth to go

I lead it
Well seated
Then I broke down

Broke down
I've run out of gas
I can't move
I've run out of gas
I'm through
I've run out of gas
I'm through

Feel I'm stuck here
Rather confused
A bit reluctant
Such a fool
I barely trust it
I know who's who
I've now run out
Out of fuel

Not so lucky
And I broke down
Full-shifted
Won't turn over
