[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Cross-eyed folded portrait
Try to hold the pain inside of me
Pin down dimension with grace of sin
Boy I've faced it
I won't retrace it
Try to face the higher god
You know that he's wise

Don't pin me down
About being free
Don't turn it around
Case liberty
Don't turn it around
It's about bein' free
Don't pin me down

Grasp up all the press
We demand much more
Arbitrary rule is based on people
Captured by the moment
Moral influence
Express your independence
Independent free will

Don't pin me down
About being free
Don't turn it around
Case of liberty
Don't turn it around
It's about bein' free
Don't pin me down
Don't pin me down
Freedom
Freedom

Can't stop fightin'
Can't stop fightin'
Can't stop fightin' the war
Can't stop fightin'
Can't stop fightin'
Can't stop fightin' the war

Can you feel the weight
Comin' down your way
Discard you
Scared you
You're unable
Restricted and bound
Look let's be fair
