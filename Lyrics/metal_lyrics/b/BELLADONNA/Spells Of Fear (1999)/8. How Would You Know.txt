[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Golden era
Lost forever
Departing terror
You fly all alone
Gone forever
Couldn't upset
True go-getter
You sweat alone
You've got to save yourself

Frightened
Recreate yourself
Dislocate
Maybe separate
Freak-out
Someday you lose
How would you

How would you know
What I've been through
Sad wind blowin'
Wild with truth
How would you know
What I've been through
The bullshit flowin'
Inside of you
How would you know

Top the test
Might need a rest
Crawl
Confess
You die on your own
God knows best
Will never contest
For those who need to object
Got to save yourself
Got to save yourself

Frightened
Recreate yourself
Dislocate
Maybe separate
Freak-out
Someday you lose
How would you

How would you know
What I've been through
Sad winds blowin'
Wild with proof
How would you know
What I've been through
The bullshit's flowin'
Inside of you
How would you know
What I've been through
Sad winds blowin'
Wild with truth
How would you know
How would you know

How would you know
What I've been through
Sad wind blowin'
Wild with truth
How would you know
What I've been through
The bullshit flowin'
Inside of you
How would you know
What I've been through
Sad winds blowin'
Wild with proof
How would you know
What I've been through
The bullshit's flowin'
Inside of you
How would you know
Gone forever
How would you know
How would you know
Gone forever
