[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Release your mind
To reach out of bounds
To leave behind
Signs are all out there
Only repeat despair
No place for shelter
With disease so massive

High voltage
Alarming cry
Mortifying
You face forward
Cruel
Look at you

Deprived, deprived
Disorder, organize
Remove, destroy the man
Cover me, time to go
Battle

Judgement will be order
Outline the route
Terminate without hesitation
Join me you coward
Whatever the circumstance

High voltage
Alarming cry
Mortifying
You face forward
Cruel
Look at you

Deprived, deprived
Disorder, organize
Remove, destroy the man
Cover me, time to go
Battle zone
Release your man
To leave behind
What's your point
Mercify
You weirdo
I salute ya

High voltage
Alarming cry
Mortifying
You face forward
Cruel
Look at you
