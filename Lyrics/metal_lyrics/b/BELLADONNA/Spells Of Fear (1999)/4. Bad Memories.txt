[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Find a way to combat
What you fought for years
There's no other format
Or way to switch gears
Find a way to combat
Your every little move
Failed the test for battle
That put you in a duel
All set for battle
That all you ever knew, knew

They're comin' now
Flyin' down
All made of spies

Find a way to pull back
That battle's about to brew
Sand's blowin' southwest
Barely have a view
Never had a clear head

They're comin' now
Flyin' down
All made of spies

[CHORUS]
Bad memories
Can't, can't fight it
Those, those bad memories
Don't even cover me
Over and above
Over and above
Bad bad memories
Those bad memories

All seems out of focus
What have you got into
Coast reduction
There's a code blue
No hesitation
My face is green
The unsuspected survival crew
Find a way to come back
The battle through
They'll find a way back
Your little move
Kind of desperate
I've prayed before

They're comin' now
Fly down
All made of spies

Might not ever come back
What you gonna do
Might not ever come back
We're comin' through

They're comin'
Still disarming
Send me the message
Fall over
They're spies

[CHORUS 3x]
