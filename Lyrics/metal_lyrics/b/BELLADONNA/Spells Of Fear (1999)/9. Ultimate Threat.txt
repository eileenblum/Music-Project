[Joey Belladonna/Peter Scheithauer]

Surreptitious conquest
Disturbance
Transmute
Crawl-space of pleasure
You're walkin' proof

Time will be told
By the looks on your hands
Crawl-space of vision
In retaliation
No mercy or forgiveness

Shake
You tremble
Terrorize the rest
Vengeance turned into threats
Worthless
You're worthless

Strong opinion
All points at you
You're the ultimate threat
Blown your cover
Open your wounds
You're the ultimate threat

Retribution
Crime will be carried out
Help me to understand

No one told you
Terrorize the rest
Vengeance turned into threats
Sudden hell
Selfish one
Crawl-space of pleasure
Disclosing the rest
Encounter
Separation
Distress

Well into midnight
Portentous
You press
Vengeance you turned into threats
Cold-hearted one die

Strong opinion
All points at you
You're the ultimate threat
Blowin' your cover
Open your wounds
You're the ultimate threat
Strong opinion
All points at you
You're the ultimate threat
Ultimate threat
Ultimate threat
Die, die
