[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

I'll wait till tonight
Oh, what a delight
Oh, my mind is turning
Tonight
This ain't right
You know

I'm feeling like a new man this time
No more evil inside
Oh, I'm feeling alive
Tonight

Can't you see
I'm alive

Call me whenever
A friend forever
Your great pretender
Just imagine me there
Whatever the pleasure
I'll never say never
So call me whenever
A clever endeavor

[Solo]

Oh, tonight
Can't you see

Call me whenever
A friend forever
Your great pretender
Just imagine me there
Whatever the pleasure
I'll never say never
So call me whenever
