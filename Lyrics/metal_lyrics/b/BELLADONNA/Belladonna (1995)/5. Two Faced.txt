[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

You're two faced like a bad penny
I know what you're doing
You lie to me like you lie to so many
Deceit in your mind it's always brewing

The little kid that you try to hide
Is frightened in the back of your mind
He's always waiting and anticipating

I don't care
I don't know
Who you are
Or where you go

Two faced
Look what you've done
Two faced man
You're such a
Two faced man on the run
Two faced friend

[Solo]

You're two faced like a bad penny
I know what you're doing
You lie to me like you lie to so many
Deceit in your mind it's always brewing

I don't care
I don't know
Who you are
Or where you go

Two faced
Look what you've done
Two faced man
