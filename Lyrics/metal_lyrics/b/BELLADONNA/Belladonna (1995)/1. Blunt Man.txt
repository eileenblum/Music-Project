[Joey Belladonna/Darin Scott]

You're perfectly aware
So disagreeable and rude
Defiant with no care
It goes with your attitude
Ya, your attitude

Must you be so blunt
Putting up your front
Now you've got your way

No such thing called shame
Along with you ya never feeling pain
Respect is what you need
Expect us to get down on our knees
Ya get down on our knees

Try and call your bluff
Enough ain't good enough
Now you're on your way

Gotta use your head
For saying what you said
Inconsideration
You blunt man
Inconsiderate
You blunt man

You know why they call you the blunt man?
No
Do you have any idea why they call you the blunt man?
No
Well I think you do

[Solo]

Gotta use your head
For saying what you said
Inconsideration
You blunt man
Inconsiderate
You blunt man
Got no feeling
You got no heart
Inconsideration
You blunt man
Inconsiderate
You blunt man
