[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

Look, look around
I tell you, we're not alone
Social system in disguise

There's something in the sky
Take a look in my eyes
I'm not one to lie
Not a fool to believe

Time, time again
They hide the truth from me
Lord, I feel so decieved

There's something in the sky
Take a look in my eyes
I'm not one to lie
You're not a fool

To believe
I'm no fool
I believe

Taken by force
(I've been) taken without remorse
State your name
Ahh, you're all insane
(I've been) taken by force

Oh please set me free

Tossing and turning in my bed
Oh I'm so lucky I'm not dead

[Solo]

What, what did I do
I've been stripped of my rights
Try, try to explain
Those lights in the night

There's something in the sky
Take a look in my eyes
I'm not one to lie
Not a fool to believe
Not a fool to believe

Taken by force
(I've been) taken without remorse
State your name
Ahh, you're all insane
(I've been) taken by force

Oh no
Oh no
I've been taken
I've been taken
I've been taken
By force

Oh no
Oh no
