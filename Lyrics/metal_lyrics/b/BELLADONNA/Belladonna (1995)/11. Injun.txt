[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

You find yourself out the door
And you wonder why
You can't handle anymore
Now you realize

Treated so unfair
Cheated, it's not fair

People will look at you
And they won't deny
All the things you can do
By the look in your eyes

Treated so unfair
Cheated, it's not fair

Don't matter anyhow
What you do now is
Take it all
Take it all the way

You won't ever know
Until you try
So take it all
Take it all the way

[Solo]

Don't matter anyhow
What you do now is
Take it all
Take it all the way
Trust me
What's done is done
Didn't mean to hurt no one

I'll take it all
Take it all the way
I won't ever know
Until I try
So take it all
Take it all the way
