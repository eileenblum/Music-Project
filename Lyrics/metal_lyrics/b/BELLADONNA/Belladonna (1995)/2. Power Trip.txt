[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

Listen to the way you sound
You're so full of it
I know this, I know that
Such a hypocrite

Talking down at everyone
Think you're always right
Push your thoughts on someone else
I know what you're like

Power trip
Power trip

The things that you say
Are better left unsaid

Enough is enough
Enough is enough
Shut your mouth
Shut it, shut it
Shut your fucking mouth

[Solo]

Oh so low
Oh so low
Enough
Enough is enough
Enough is enough

Power trip
Power trip

Shut your mouth
