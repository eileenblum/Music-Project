[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

All in all this is one big mess
You should never second guess
All the weight that I felt before
Is now knocking back at the door

It's nothing new, I've seen it before
Yeah before

Taking matters into my hands
That's not the way it's gotta be
The only one that I trust is myself
I know it's hard to believe

It's nothing new, I've done it before
Did you notice, I'm not alone
On my way, yes, I'm on my way

Realized
Not long ago
Save your breath

Rest in peace
You're released
Rest in peace
Rest in peace

[Solo]

Realized
Not long ago
Save your breath

Rest in peace
You're released
Rest in peace

Rest in peace
You're released
Rest, rest, rest
Rest in peace, rest in peace
