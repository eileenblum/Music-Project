[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

Put my collar up
I'm in way too deep
I see dark shadows up ahead
I'm taking every step
As if it was my last
I wonder if I'll make it out alive
Out alive

All the fears inside
Have taken over me
Looking all around, no place to hide
My blood is running cold
I got nowhere to go
I wonder if I'll make it through the night
Through the night

Thinking back I see
The way things used to be
Living so carefree and full of life
I had to walk away
Ahh, what's happened to me
So much pain and so much misery

See ya
So far gone
See ya
So far gone

Save me, I'm down and out
Under a spell
Save me from this hell

[Solo]

See ya
So far gone
See ya
So far gone

Save me, I'm down and out
Under a spell
Save me from this hell

Save me, I'm down and out
Under a spell
Save me from this hell

Whoa
I'm down and out
