[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

Break your back?
We've all been through it
Only time
Time will tell

Life is hard?
There's nothing to it
Only you can break the spell
Brace yourself
I wish you well

Don't confuse my good intent
All good thoughts I create
Building of a new age
Stick around, you'll find your fate

Brace yourself
I wish you well

Trust me
Trust in me
I got nothing to hide
Nothing to hide from you

[Solo]

Brace yourself
I wish you well

Trust me
Trust in me
I got nothing to hide
Nothing to hide from you

Trust me
Trust in me
I got nothing to hide
Nothing to hide from you
