[Joey Belladonna/Darin Scott]

Thinking about the past
Put it all into view
Things are so different
It's all moving too fast
All too fast

So take a look
Way down below
There's nothing different
That I already know

Feel I've been used
There's nothing you can do
Feel I've been used
Man, it's so cruel

Mixed emotions
Playing with your mind
Mixed emotions
There's no surprise
Mixed emotions
Playing with your mind
There's no devotion
Playing with your mind

Strong power behavior
Response with fear
Move on over
Get the hell out of here

Feel I've been used
There's nothing you can do
Feel I've been used
Man, it's so cruel

Mixed emotions
Playing with your mind
Mixed emotions
There's no surprise
Mixed emotions
Playing with your mind
There's no devotion
Playing with your mind

[Solo]

Mixed emotions
Playing with your mind
Mixed emotions
There's no surprise
Mixed emotions
Playing with your mind
No more devotion
Playing with your mind

Mixed emotions
Playing with your mind
No more devotion
There's no surprise
Playing with your mind
