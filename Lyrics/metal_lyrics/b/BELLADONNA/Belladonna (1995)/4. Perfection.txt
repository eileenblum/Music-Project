[Joey Belladonna/Darin Scott]

Ultimate situations
Don't always turn out right
For the lack of perfection
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright by me

Achieve what you want
Achieve what you can
Don't let nothing stand in your way
You're on your road to perfection

Faultless fulfillment
I can't pretend
I can't pretend
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright by me

Achieve what you want
Achieve what you can
Don't let nothing stand in your way
You're on your road to perfection

Achieve what you want
Don't let nothing stand in your way
Achieve what you can
You're on your road to perfection
On your way

Ultimate situations
Don't always turn out right
For the lack of perfection
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright by me
That's alright

[Solo]

Achieve what you want
Don't let nothing stand in your way
Achieve what you can
You're on your road to perfection
On your way
