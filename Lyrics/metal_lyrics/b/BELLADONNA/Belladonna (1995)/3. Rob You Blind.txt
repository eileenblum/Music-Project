[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

Some friend you turned out to be
Who need enemies
Over and over
You lie

Emotions in motion
Full of surprise
No more devotion
Good-bye

Try and hide
Your foolish pride
Pride
Can't deny
You're fried

Never turn your back
I'll rob you blind
Better turn around
I'll rob you blind
Kick ya when you're down
Who needs your kind
Vendetta on your back
I'll rob you blind

[Solo]

Never turn your back
I'll rob you blind
Better turn around
I'll rob you blind
Kick ya when you're down
Who needs your kind
Vendetta on your back
I'll rob you blind
