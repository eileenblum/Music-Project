[Joey Belladonna/Paul Crook]

It's not your life
Just let me be
I'm living life from day to day
So give it up
Let it go
Gonna do it
Don't care what you know

Addiction takes over
Lost all control
Can't stop fighting
So cold

I can see that no one
No one can help me now

Let me go
Let me go
No control
Let me go

Going under
Six feet under
I don't wanna die

[Solo]

Let me go
Let me go
No control
Let me go
