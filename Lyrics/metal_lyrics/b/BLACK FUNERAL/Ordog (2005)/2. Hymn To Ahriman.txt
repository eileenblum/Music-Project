Crumble you days of gilded pestilence
and rot in your imprisoning fear
I cast down your scornful
worm-eaten delusion
cloaked as tatter'd redemption
I roar forth a thousand swords
from stronger mountains
than you could ever dream of falling from
and pierce the rusted armour of your salvation
I bear up this darkening world
upon my serpent-kissed shoulders
and shake loose the detritus
of your crippled hope
Ahriman stands beside and within me as your Omega blooms
Ahriman stands beside and within me as your weakling children earn
Their dust
Ahriman stands beside and within me as your fallen empires mark your grave
Ahriman stands beside and within me as you weep for false glories lost
Rise up on broken feet, oh hobbled aeons of despised light
you'll stand at this moment of thy end if ever at all
my word is the dirt tossed upon your waiting grave
and my deed is the truth that buried you there
