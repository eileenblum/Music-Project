I shall enter the depths of hell
Descending into underworld bliss
When the serpent awakens within
My spirit has been set free
When the body of light is encircled in its shadow
Casting darkness upon all around it
No limitations the flesh is entombed but spirit awakes
Bound by my circumference in a circle of shadow
Breathing the blood of the ancient in my flesh
I open my eyes, burning light, the source
My angelic nature unfolding into the beast
I affirm the mind of Ahriman
Serpents rise from my flesh
Tiamat before me
Chaos stirs within
I ensorcel my spirit to the flesh of draconis
My thirst for life grows fervent
In the halls of the 7th hell does the serpent arise
Shall I be now the father of serpents
To exist beyond the halls of the dragon
