Whoever shall drink of my blood
Shall have eternal life
I have emerged from the Abyss
Vomited my blood into your wanting mouth
Shown you desire in the name of the Beast
Enter my gates which reveal the serpent's throne
I breed dragons beneath my flesh
Cloaked in night burning lust
Scaled in the time worn strains of the Adversary
Breeding war and unrest
Kiss me deep Mother of Serpents
And let your blood drain into my mouth
Tiamat, who devours and blesses a waking world
Your children born of Kingu's blood
Shadowed enraptured serpent entwined
Beneath the scythes blade do we reside
Unending, partaking of the divine
Gazing forever within the reflection of the beast
I have become upon the altar of Lilith
When the moon does not shine
Darkness surround, cast down
I arise in thy flesh
Blood a fountain of spilt life
Whose own land craves cleansing
Beast forlorn lead them to the slaughter
I hate this world of human overpopulation
Raise them up for the feast
Chaos awakened storm summoned bane
Where flesh seeks no end
Drink of my blood and know eternal life
