Memories absorbed
The survival of spirit is constant
Fallen into the void
Where flame is found revealed within
I seek to break down the strong
Absorb and drink from their life
When their hope fails
I want to show them my true form
Blackness enraptured in the visage of death
Yet deathless is the spirit which is the wolf
Given the fire from one so ancient
That time can no longer hold
To give to those who attend the darkness
My brothers and sisters of hungering shadow
Who have tasted the rebirth of the Serpent's kiss
Beneath the veil of a dark moon
When the mothers' legs open again
She of the Night then flows into our veins
A New life awakens
Deathless and eternal
I seek to master your world now
I seek to build the apocalypse
