Oh Prince of the mountain of the eternal midnight
Receive me in the chain
Make me part of those who haunt humanity's nightmare
I give you souls in exchange of godliness
Master of death and resurrection
whose name is a mystery among mysteries
Spirit of shadows spawn from a darker shadow
Green dragon of the court of Sigismund
Oh Lord, receive me in the chain!
In the name of the fire that never dies
In the name of death that feeds from eternal life
In the name of the corpse lying unputrefied in a centuries old grave
In the name of the spirit that grants limitless powers
By these words be the red pact consumed
And I become a link in the silver chain
