On a cold night, still a death, winds send forth the wild hunt, from the east to the coldest north, we are the escort to the grave
Cwn Annwn, spectral wolves and phantom hounds, hail Lolo ap Auw, can you hear them baying in the void? Into the forests, gather the souls and death, deeper into the green wilds
Unto Caer Vandwy, fortress of the otherworld
To the king of spirits and his Queen - Cwn Annwn, you who are entering the forest
For the love of your mate permit us to enter your dwelling...
