She waits there
Pale and still
She is pale until her prey passes by
Beautiful and seductive, Baobhan sith, lurking in the cemetary
Seeking her cold kiss of death
Dearg-due, she bites deep with her kiss
Slowly the life is drained
She is strong
From the mountain wilds, her world opens to ours
To drink the ecstasies of death
Immortal
Shadow upon black wings, the world become gray between the living and the death
Drink the deep with phantom grasps to old until carries off
Behold, Dearg-due, who loves darkness and warm streams of crimson life
