In the cold chill of night, hear mournful wail
Apparition, creeping shadow which takes shape
The cry of the owl cannot be ignored
When the Ankou comes, his thirst must be sated, hordes of phantoms, Labous an Ankou upon the nocturnal winds, Labous an Ankou, I seek to extinguish your fire, let the carrion fill my cart
Haggard corpse filled with a fiery spirits of the darkness
Cain, cloak me in the robes of Ankou, let me take the form of the bird of death
