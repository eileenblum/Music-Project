Dark spirit upon the nightmare steed, bearing its head screeching into the darkness
Small fires in the black light flicker about
A skull with stretched skin, molded and tight with decay
A grin which reveals a lust for death, never sated
Dullahan, carry the whip of the spine of the corpse, the black wagon carries the dead, graven in funeral objects, skull candles light the way covered in human skin
An fear Dorcha Gan Ceann...
