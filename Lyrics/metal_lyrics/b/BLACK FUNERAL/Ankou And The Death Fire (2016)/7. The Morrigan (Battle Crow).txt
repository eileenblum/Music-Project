Behold, the green fields of battle, let the sword be scary and cruel
Under the ravens, banner we ghader to kill and feed the soil our blood
I seek the ecstasy of the blade burying in flesh
Open the flesh of the gods, spears stabbing down
Harbingers of death, hearken to me! As warriors falls, dying and tortured by cruel wounds, let macha drink deep
By the tusks of the boar, fill me with your frenzy
By the hunting hounds biting the throat of my prey, let no weapon assail me
Morrigan favor me under the bleeding crescent moon, Morrigan guide us to the netherworld if you determine that I fall
