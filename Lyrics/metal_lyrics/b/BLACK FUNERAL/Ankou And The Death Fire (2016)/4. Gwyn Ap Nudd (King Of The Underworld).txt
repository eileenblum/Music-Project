The chilling winds of autumn
The horde of darkness rise
Upon steeds and wolves with demonic faces gather, tonight the wild hunt rides
Gwyn ap nudd, libations to an ancient god
No prayers may save your human pray
Fast on the dark skies
A huntsman in the devil's mask
Screaming upon the night sky
Triumphant glance
Across the haunting moon
Let our noise terrify
I deal in death, the wolves and hounds tear life away
