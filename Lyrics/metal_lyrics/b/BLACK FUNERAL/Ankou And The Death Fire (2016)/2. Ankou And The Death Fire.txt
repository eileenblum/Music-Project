At dusk, the gates of the netherworld can be opened
The Ankou takes shape
Tall and gaunt casting shadow
Let the wizened skin bring the stench of death
Ankou, swathed in a ragged shroud
Ankou nigh stalker
Smell the air for the living
Your cart creeks slowly by
Eyes lit with a phantom flame, Ankou the death bringer
Sharpen my scythe on human bones
Plague and dysentery my companions beside me
A appear by the ghostly death fire, won't you come with me?
