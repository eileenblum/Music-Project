Grim terrifying reaper, to all who are gathered by
Ankou
Grave yard watcher, gaunt
Your forms are many, old god
As a wizened corpse tall and decaying
Who wields the scythe or sword, Ankou, shadow-wraith collecting the dead
Black robed phantom, whose burning glance from beneath the hat bring terror
Whose Black cart is led by 2 ghostly servants, four flour black death-steeds
Oberour ar Maro, who is Cain immortal, reaping
Ankou, king of the dead, let the power of shadows be mind
Haunting in decay
Do you hear cart? Karrigell and Ankou (wheelbarrow of death), his pound of flesh best cold
The knock on the doors calls all into the darkness while shedding the flesh
