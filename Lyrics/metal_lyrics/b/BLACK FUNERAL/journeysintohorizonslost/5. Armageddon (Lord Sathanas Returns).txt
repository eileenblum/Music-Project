A spell we chant, a cascade of blood flows...
Fullmoon calls the north hordes, we gather as one
The earth a wasteland, freezing ice and snow
The wind carries our battle cries, a victory chalice is raised

The moon rises again, the blood angel screams
War begun, lord Sathanas returns
Millions crushed, an age of death
My earthly form is finished, I await the sign

Armageddon finally here, the black spells victorious
I call the demon of emptiness, devour our gift of flesh
The earth a wasteland, freezing ice and snow
The wind carries our battle cries, a victory chalice is raised

The moon rises again, the blood angel screams
War begun, lord Sathanas returns.
