I see a star, as blazing as my father's soul
My spirit one color tone, as silent as a vast field
As cold as a rushing winter's breeze
Barren as a leafless tree
Dark and empty as the sky before me

My tear's as a blood covered stake
Covet the scarlet fluid
For I long to join the stars, blazing as the goat's eye

To ride the wings of bats across a dismal land
The chill against the night air, as I embrace the far sky
I am a part of this forever, dwelling in constant shadows
I look up to this star, and the colors change before my eyes
As burning coals of a sorcerer's fire, silent and shadowed, but they scream as one

My before journey traveled,
Yet I remember this ancient time.
