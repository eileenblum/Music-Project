Malefic energies circle the temple as the spell is willed...
where the spheres connect cosmic forces enter the casual world of horrors, beauty to the risen...
watch the cthonic blood pit dwellers rise...controlled by our will.

The Goat of One Thousand young is a shadow of my lust...
Leviathan, serpent of the depths is a reality of my iron will let the trapezoid bring forth...
Mind over matter connected whit sonic energy...
the key is the eighth angel,

The black oceans roar with the sound of demonic laughter, dark waters stir...
Behold, Leviathan awakes...
From the chains in which I have hung myself, I see now this vision knowing, my strength is one with Pan...
