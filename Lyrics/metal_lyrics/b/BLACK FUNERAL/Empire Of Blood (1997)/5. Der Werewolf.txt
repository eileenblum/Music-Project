Before the Samhain full moon I position myself
Facing the soil carved pentagram
Candles incinerate black, smoldering the scent of Mars bellows in the wind...
I cloak my skin in the flesh of the wolf and a mask of demonic symbolism
The lycanthropic strain engulfs my psyche and I feel electric alive...
Holding the tetrahedron, the chant is called,
Fenris is awakened...my eyes reflect red,
Hungering, I walk the dense forests the light of the fullmoon darkens the earth...
And as I watch and feel the ghost rise...the energy builds,
The casual life envelops my being, to go into he world,
To claw and devour the weak and fearful, beholden, upon a mountain...
The purple lightning forms a sigil...
Luna descends, the pleasures of flesh are mine!
