Spirit of Venus
the Morning Star
Fallen and free... we rise from the abyss
crossing and the radiance of Satanael
the gates are forever open
Nephilim joining with us
may Xaphan burn Heaven to flames
werewolf spirits... beasts of nature
gather among mankind, teach them to be as Gods
the slaves shall serve
Lilith walks among us
sorcery and witchcraft through the Lunar cycle
the Goddess takes flesh on earth
Thelema shall be the Law of the Strong
the Beast walks in many forms
our black book is written
fallen and free, we rise from the abyss
adorning the light of Satanael
