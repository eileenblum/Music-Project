Zazas, Zazas, Natsatanada Zazas
Born in the light,
Prometheus, none shall come before me
there is a serpent in the garden
the serpent give wisdom of the illuminated one
now of darkness, now of dragons
infernal majesty
Heaven is no ideal for us, we don't want it
another god becomes death
light extinguished.
Born through the depths of the abyss
where the fire is within us
through our essence, through our forms
born in the light, living through the worms
eating the corpses... devouring the false
light of Jehovah.
Nothing remains...
the wolf rises in the rune of Thurisaz,
bloody specter haunts from the graves
In the night the burning eyes see
demonic glory from the light not seen
infernal majesty, life through the breaking of bonds
become the light one, shadows reigning in the mind
infernal majesty, dragon â serpent
burning the lies
death reigns only with Jehovah
