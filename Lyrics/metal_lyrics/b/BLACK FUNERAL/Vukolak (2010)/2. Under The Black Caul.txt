Born under blood black night - Shadow skin upon - Seperate from humanity - The rite is a rebirth - Marked by Varcolaci - Ascending in the night - I seek the blood of the moon - Towards the lunar sphere - Flesh is left - Spirit becomes as dragon - Strengthen my spirit - The flesh remembers - I hunger to tear again - Consume of the life - The rite of crossroads - Under a black caul - Neverending darkness - My light is within - Always to the musick of wolves - In a land so desolate - Blood is so precious here - Under a black caul - I am reborn nightly - I sip the blood of the moon, of life - Horned splendor
