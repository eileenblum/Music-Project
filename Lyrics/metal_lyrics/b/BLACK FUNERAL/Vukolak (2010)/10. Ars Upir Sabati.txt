[originally by GrÃ¤uen Pestanz]I spread the wings of my shadowed mind, into the circle of Samaelâs seed.
Inauguration in blood, born of Lilithâs fornication
Blood, which drips from the infernal moon forms a sigil upon my lips
To pass through the black witchâs flame, and seal the sign in consecration

Obscuro in melancholicus, simulacrum chorus mortis
Perspicientia lamia, via intempesta nox noctis
Penetralis antiquitas, cruor degeneris Abel
In Pestis nefastus adsigno obscuro lux triumphans

ARS UPIR SABATI

To the Awakening of the immortal Blood, which flows within my veins
Phantoms of The Darkness, born in the Ashes of Libations
Awakening the ghost of the sleeping tomb, the dance of the infernal flame
I kiss the lips of Naamah, and pass through the veil of endless ages.
