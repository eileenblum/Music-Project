Crimson hunger arising - Spirit not encircled in flesh - Gathered in the night cloaked in darkness - To go forth where the sleeping lie - Gathering shadows - Astral tendrils grow, black and darksome - Within the center of my shadow - Burning fire, crimson desire - I hunger for life, I hunger for immortality - To feast eternally on the blood of spirit - The very essence of life itself - No boundaries on the spirit plane - We can rip through them - Our tendrils of darkness reaching in to the body - Tearing into the aura - Draining slowly - Ecstasy and power - Hunger for life renown - Arise in the form of draconis - Arise in the form of the wolf - The bat shall carry us on wings of night - Burning center, the beast hungers within - Must go forth to feed - Tendrils rising, desire for drinking from the spirit of my prey - Gathering shadows - To go forth where the sleeping lie- Tearing into the aura
