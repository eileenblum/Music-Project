Enter the gate of fools - Where the blood brings us closer - To the shades of death - There is the place of night - Where warm flesh is - Not undisturbed - Metamorphosis - The gateway is opened - O pale flesh - Offered at the gate - Of the black mirror - The blood so warm - Offered in the skull cap - The shades gather and drink - To grow strong - My sigils define their existence - Bound by the oath of shades - Take the flesh I give you - Stain it red - Black eyes emerge to enter this world or horrors
