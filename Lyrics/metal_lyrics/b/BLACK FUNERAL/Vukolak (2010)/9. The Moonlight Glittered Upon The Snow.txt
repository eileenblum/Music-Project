[originally by Sorath]Oh, the night rises again, I feel the beast possess me,
Stimulation of bestial desire, way of the wolf is my oath
I prepare for a hunt of human life

Ritual prepared, master satan, grant me the powers of the wolf
Wolfskin belt is given, succubus, rape my flesh and gather the
Blackest lust
I feel the pain and suffering of the innocent child,
As the flesh is torn and the blood is shed

The night has teeth, as many humans have found
I am the lord of the forest, my skills of magick and death perfected
A service to my dark lord-the death of light, in human form he was
Tortured
Death welcomed him... the soul is immortal... beware...
