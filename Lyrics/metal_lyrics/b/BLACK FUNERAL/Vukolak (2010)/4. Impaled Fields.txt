Enriched in the mountains of an ancient land - The wolves howl to our calls - A banner stained in blood - Black and crimson - a sign of strength - The wallachian bat the raiding force - Against the invading prey - Let our stakes be sharpened against the sun - Prepare to hold flesh high to the birds of prey - Wallachian forest, wolves of the forest I call - Swords sharpened and prepared for blood - Let no arrows or wounds touch your backs - Lest I impale you in the field of death - To feed the land the blood of the living - A am a Prince of Darkness - Of Draconian honor - The banner of the dragon is held high - Let our raiding force strike in night - To bite and tear deep into the Turkish host - To feed from their life and fly into the night - As the bat and shadow embraced forest - To feed from those straggling behind their armies - Greeting them with a forest of the impaled - Rotting and life taken to fuel our spirits - Something they cannot break - Hail thou Impaling Prince - Prepare to hold flesh high to the birds of prey - Let swords strike deep, let the mace fall into the skull - The music of solves and the flies around the carrion - Is the music of victory
