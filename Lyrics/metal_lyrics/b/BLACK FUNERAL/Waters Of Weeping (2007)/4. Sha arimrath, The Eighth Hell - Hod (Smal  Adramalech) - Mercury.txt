Behold, the waiting eyes of darkness
Born in flame, enshrouded in fire
Here is the fallen creation
Those knowing of both darkness
Yet possessing light
Samael, the eyes of power
The eye which consemes all life
And gives life to others
In barren desolation
Cav puirty, in perversion be found
Samael, whose poison is a cure
Against the sickness of spirit
In this hell do i emerge
Stronger in the sign of darkness
With a spell chanted in the flame
Of blackened creation
