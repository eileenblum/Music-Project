Mars, sphere of war and strife
Bury the mace to the skull
Spirit of the wounding spear
Who is of conflict and chaos
Asmodeus rise up in the spirit
Against the weakened spirit of light
Darkness and fire burn entwined together
No longer faced with restriction
Asmodeus, who dwells in the heart of man
Let a beast rise up, drink the spirit of man
I go forth in power to rule in strength
Our wolves feast from the ruins of god
Once we have attacked
Master the spirit again and again
Found in the faith Asmodeous
