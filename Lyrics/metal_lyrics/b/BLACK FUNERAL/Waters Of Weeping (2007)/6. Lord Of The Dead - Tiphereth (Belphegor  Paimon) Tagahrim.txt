The revolt against god
Brings the awakening of the spirit
No hunger constricted
YaÃ¯mien, great spirit of Lucifer
Embrace with dreaming knowledge
Mastery of the earth, Black Sun
Burning my dreams, calling me into nightmares
Belphagor, Lord of the Dead
Encircle the shades ento me
That strength shall find me
Here the spirit is devoured cast asunder
Brought before the shadows
Those of our faith
Bury in the trials of the soul
Found as predators among the sheep
Are uplifted to god
The revolt against god
Brings the awakening of the spirit
No hunger constricted
YaÃ¯mien, great spirit of Lucifer
Transformation, awaken me as God
