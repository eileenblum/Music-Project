Ravens formed as flies enciricle
Ripping the spirit apart
To discover the essence remaining
Seperated from ignorance of the undiscovered light
Only with smoke fouled against the flame
Can immortality be seen
Darkness born from the first of fallen angels
Bringing the gift of hunger of light

Here resides Tebat Cain
Making the blades and weapons of war
Found first in your mind and soul
Finding the flesh to center it's will
Cast down the strong who stand against you still
Back, goetic lord of the 72 fallen
Roaming the earth as the spirit of darkness
Awaken more to our gnosis
