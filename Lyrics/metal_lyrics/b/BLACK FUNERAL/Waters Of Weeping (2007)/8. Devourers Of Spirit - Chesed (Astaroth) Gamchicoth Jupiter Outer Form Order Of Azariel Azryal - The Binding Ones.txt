Crossroads, path of the Luciferian spirit
Known in the darkness of the mind
I stretch my limbs out from the grave
Rising as shadow born again
Drink deep here of the knowledge
Forbidden fruit is really the spirit awakened
Devour without mercy
The prey shalt always be prey
The wolf shalt howl again by the night
Spirits with hunger eternal, rise again
Never to withstand
Those God fearing find spirits empty
Knowing nothingness awaits
Unless you have taken within the black flame
Rising up to devour the strong
