Awaken deep in the earth
Worm surrounded
Blessed in filth, nocturnal emissions
I grow from lust and desire
My hunger is insatiable, penetrating
Goddess of flies and serpents

Whore who swallows the spirits of men
Calls them nightly
Insects hear her call
Passions aroused by darkness

Nahemoth
Cast me down into your pit of filth
Let me hold you close
Knowing death brings eternal life
Found in the passion throes of copulation
