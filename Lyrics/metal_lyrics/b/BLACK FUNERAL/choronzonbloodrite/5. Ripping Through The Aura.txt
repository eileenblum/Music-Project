Crimson hunger arising
Spirit not encircled in flesh
Gathered in the night cloaked in darkness
To go forth where the sleeping lie
Gathering shadows
Astral tendrils grow, black and darksome
Within the center of my shadow
Burning fire, crimson desire
I hunger for life, I hunger for immortality
To feast eternally on the blood of spirit
The very essence of life itself
No bourndaries on the spirit plane
We can rip through them
Our tendrils of darkness reaching into the body
Tearing into the aura
Draining slowly
Ecstasy and power
Hunger for life renown
Arise in the form of draconis
Arise in the form of the wolf
The bat shall carry us on wings of night
Burning center, the beast hungers within
Must go forth to feed
Tendrils rising, desire for drinking from the spirit of my prey
Gathering shadows
To go forth where the sleeping lie
Tearing into the aura
