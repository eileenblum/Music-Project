Exhumed by the profane daughter of poisoned passions
Torn by iron forks
Burnt in the fires of the fearful
Fly forth as the raven
Take flesh again
Blood embraced shadow
Dwelling in the temples of Lilith's talons
Fresh crimson blood
Bathed in sapphire splendor
Goddess of immortal hunger
The winds of Zarnesti
Call forth winds of the raven night
Claws tearing forth
In a realm of shadows
She learnt the black art of immortal power
Unto the winds of Zarnesti
