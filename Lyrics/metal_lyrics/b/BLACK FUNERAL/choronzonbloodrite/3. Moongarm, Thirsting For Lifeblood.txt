From within, thirst
From within, hunger
Rising up, gray shadow
To seek the continued existence
To grow strong
From the life escaping in the void
Haunting the skies of night
The moon offers the lamp of wisdom
The wolfshape rising
The mighty darkbringer
Chaos thirsting
Nightmare beast
To fill myself with lifeblood
Of those who have died
To swallow the stars and rise as god
I shall spill blood across the sky
From the storms which tear the earth
Awakening
Empowerment of chaos
Released force of nature
In the mind
We seek to destroy
And consume more life
To grow strong...immortal
