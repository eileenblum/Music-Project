Invoke beyond
Opening the gates of night
Blood spilt
Entering the shadows 
Primal nightmares stir
Memories return
Devil of the Aethyr
We are as one
Crawling in the abyss
Ascending upward
Blood is life, gateway
Choronzon
Dragon-burning black fire of wisdom
Daath illuminated in darkest night
Passing through the veil of death
Entrance, offered the waters of abyss
Entrance of the mind
Joined as one
Son of the Night
Fallen majesty of predatory splendor
I become Master of Forms
As I create my desires
Born into shadow-flesh
I am the Malice of Choronzon
Choronzon Blood Rite
Dragon of the Abyss
Bringer of Consciousness
Initiator of Gods!
