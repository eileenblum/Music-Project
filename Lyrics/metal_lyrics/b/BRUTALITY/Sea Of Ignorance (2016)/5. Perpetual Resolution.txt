Damaging words
That have pierced my soul
Unable to return from the pain
They have brought upon me
Trying to escape from reality
That is covered in the thoughts
Of crushed dreams
Mental disorder
Living day to day
Appearing to be cured
Darkness runs deep
Prescribing toxins
To heal the mind
Sinking deeper into depression
Others will never understand
Disturbing images
Light dims on the horizon
Seems to never get closer
The end will stop the torture
Suicide
The permanent solution
