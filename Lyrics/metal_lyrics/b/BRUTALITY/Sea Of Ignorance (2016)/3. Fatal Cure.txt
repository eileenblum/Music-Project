Since the beginning of man
Survival of the fittest
Overcoming all in its path
War and pain
No regards for its destruction
Medical breakthroughs
Curing all the sickness
Overpopulation
All resources depleted
Global disasters
Leaving the land inhabitable
For life
Human disease
Ourselves, cleansed from the earth
Free of its cancer
Nature takes its course
Nothing is left alive
Generations lost
Civilization abandoned
All is gone
Cowering in their fear
Ruled by weakness
The end is here
Man's final hour
