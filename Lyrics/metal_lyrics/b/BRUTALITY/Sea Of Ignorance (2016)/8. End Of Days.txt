Nine one one
Manufactured lies
Thousands gone
Lust for power, endless greed
Face the facts
Freedoms raped as the towers fall
Survivors crying to be freed
They feed you with thoughts of hate
In a void of despair
Corruption of the mind
Until they're satisfied
Destiny unfolds
Right before their eyes
Landscapes of obscurity
Despising all life
