Fools wearing blinders
Unaware of their surroundings
It has made them what they are
Looking for their own glory

Psyche consumes them
Covering the paths others have made
Followers trying to lead
Overfilling vessels
Only leading them to their demise

Waves of reality engrossing

Negative energy
Helpless from what is created
What they give is what they receive
Communication absent

No responsibility taken
Leaving all to the side
For things more important
Burning bridges

Built with trust
Contractual words exchanged
All for profit
Doomed to fail
