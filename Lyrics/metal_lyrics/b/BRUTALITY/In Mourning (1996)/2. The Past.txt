[music by Walsh/Acres, lyrics by Reigel]

[solo: Outlaw]
stripped of all possessions
collected through time
haunting past constant thinking
reflections of memories
looking for reasons 
must live for reality
absorb the knowledge
gaining strength through preception
unknown powers now revealed
mind capabilities growing
future uncertain
fate will take you there
transformation to oneself
newday will come
strive for dreams
reconstruction through time
[solo: Outlaw]
depression soon will overcome
time for self presorvation
others left behind
no time wasted
opening eyes
seeing what must be done
destiny unfolds travels abroad
[solo: Outlaw]
feeling of guilt
obey your thoughts
quest for answers
hidden in sadness
path leads forward
new millenium
show the truth
life has just begun
[solo: Outlaw]
