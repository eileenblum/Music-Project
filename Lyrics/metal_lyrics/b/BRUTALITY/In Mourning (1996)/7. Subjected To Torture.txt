[music by Walsh/Acres, lyrics by Coker/Reigel]

confronted with humilation
restrained unable to move
subjected to torture wretched sick
preverted hunger pain intense 
forced to obey life of violence
stradegy to prey on weakness
tolerance level
mentally stronger as times goes by
survive by will voice commands
device imprisons domination
initial shock change perception
defile the innocent. ridicule
[solo: Outlaw]
endless pity drugs utilized
elevating moods murderer laughing
leaving scene of crime
blood and sweat flow from body
foreign fluids ejaculated
attacked maliciously left to die
vicious criminal no remorse
for gruesome acts
searched for by authorities
eluding manhunt
diverting attention
stranger intrudes
evidence of abductions
fate is met unexpected
tortured extreme
bleeding incisions
victim paralyzed
motionless in the dark
shrieks from shadow
blind of subduer
pulled chains twisting
[solo: Outlaw]
escape impossible
enslaver to control
awaiting the sentence
let the punishment
fit the crime
time for sacrifice
sounds of pain and pleasure
total silence
subjected to torture
[solo: Outlaw]
