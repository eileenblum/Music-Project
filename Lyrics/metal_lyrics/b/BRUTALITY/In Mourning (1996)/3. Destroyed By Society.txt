[music by Walsh/Acres, lyrics by Coker/Reigel]

dreams of days gone by
life which path to take
flash backs hallucinations
world has changed
back into society
see the light of day
tolerance
perceived as challenge
hostile environment
no excuse for failure
you're victimized
punishment for guilt
blandly accepting fate
humilation
threshold of mixed emotions
deliberately supressed
released from isolation
uncertainty arises
adapt to my surroundings
horrified of what I see
population dominated
aversive stimulation
inability to control
disrupting effect
reopening the wounds
abandoned and deprived
disease potential
[solo: Walsh]
