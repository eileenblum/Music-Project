[music by Acres, lyrics by Coker/Acres]

[solo: Walsh]
diminishing sun 
obscures the light
as darkness falls
across horizon
wind blows slowly
through the trees
change of season
brings new life
tremendous grieving
hard to bare
drags me down
traying to cope
with this bitter pain
casting shadows
crosses marching graves
destined to die
awaiting rebirth
vault of horror opens
casket laden with wreaths
rusted gates
weary sleep
face expressionless
swollen bruised lips
sewn together surgically
despite decapitation
eyes shut still
talisman placed around the neck
cloaked in veil
in mourning I cry
[solo: Walsh]
remembering the dead
deny your maker mortal fear
restless uncertainty
visions of madness rage
[solo:Walsh]
prayer for the deceased
searching for the meaning
next I wander that
will become
life without reason
recollections
flashing vividly
before my eyes
years of contentment
suddenly torn
times spent in harmony
and love
all those moments
will be lost in time
like tears in rain
time to die
[solo: Walsh]
