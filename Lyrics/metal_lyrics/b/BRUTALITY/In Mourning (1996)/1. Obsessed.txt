[music by Acres/Walsh, lyrics by Reigel/Acres]

alone
monster cries inside
devious perversions
invade the mind
trapping the anger
emotional tension
prey must be hunted
human target sighted
the pressures building
[solo:Walsh]
adrenolin rushes
victims abducted
screams of fear
feeling higher
seduced with hate
orgasmic power blows
thoughts now reality
contorted body in pain
[solo:Walsh]
addicted to the power
more to satisfy
body count rises
human errors
follow the trail
soon it will end
no escape
deny the capture
[solo: Walsh]
final life taken
self inflicted
release your soul
leave this hell
