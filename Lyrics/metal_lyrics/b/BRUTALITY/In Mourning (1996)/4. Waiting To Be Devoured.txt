[music by Acres, lyrics by Walsh]

[solo: Walsh]
twisting nature
burning sacred land
deforestation
life beyond our means
epidemic creation
one foot in the grave
famine and sickness
strikes back at mankind
living organisms
unable to quarantine
catastrophic outbreaks
airborn virus
biological tainted blood
instrument of redemption
[solo: Walsh]
reaction to the anti-body
respiratory seizure
hormonal side effects
a world in pain
[solo: Walsh]
violation
existence severed
civilization
born of ancient times
corpses filed high
single cell
cross mutation
corrupt planetary treason
[solo: Walsh]
