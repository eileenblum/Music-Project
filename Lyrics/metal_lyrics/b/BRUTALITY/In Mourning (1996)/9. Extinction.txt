[music by Acres/Walsh, lyrics by Reigel/Coker]

entering a new world
of hate and deception
useless massacres cut and dissected
there is no law all are defenseless
where to go now
lands filled with sickness
blinding brightness swealtering heat
eye of the night safe til dawn
infertile earth ruins from humans
strong will survive
weak will die suffering
must take cover light is near
rations deplenished
hard to stay alive
night grows shorter
dread of the future
difficult to breathe
elements unleashing
drawing closer to the sun
world is crumbling destiny of man
fate will fall fury on planet
civilization swallowed no life
as we know it
