[Music: Acres, Gates, Fernandez]
[Lyrics: Coker]

Ritual not a sin
Evolution
Spawned decay
Bow to thou
On your knees
Retribution
Does exist
Die
Conquer me
You'll survive
Terrorizing
I will crush
Rotting life
Endless vision
At dawn they rise
Out of hell
To torture me...
Drained of life...
Tragedy...
Unholy...
Demonized...
Torture...
Leave me now...
To suffocate...
End is near or is it
The beginning of time
I've been lured unto
The gates of hell
Unprotected
Your guts I rip
The land I rule
Binded by the mark
Thrown into
Pit of fire
Blood I drool
Biting on decay
At dawn they live
Non-existing
Coming back from
The darkness
Crawling through
A spawned illusion
In the night of the dark sky
They rise...
Unregret
Gathered around
The carcass
Slowly death
No release for you
Can be found
Now the dead exist
From below
End of time is here...

BRUTALITY is:
