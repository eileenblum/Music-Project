[Music: Acres, Gates]
[Lyrics: Coker]

Scraping remains of decomposition
Stains of splattered blood
Mutilated cadavers hanging from hooks
Innards psychotically smeared on walls
Symptoms wielding
A fatal epidemic
Bacterial infection metabolism
Doused in disease
Virus attacks the bloodstream
Abdominal pain and vomiting
Clinging helplessly to life
Unable to move this cell imprisons you
Awareness is diluted
Exhaustion lack of energy
Septicemic plague
Uncontrolled trauma
Benevolence destroyed
All that was real
Coming to the end
Slain sadistically
Impaled on spike
Vengeance is mine I say to thee
