[Music: Acres, Gates]
[Lyrics: Coker]

Rising from the crypts below
Carcass is partially decomposed
Eternal entombment absence of life
Awakening the bodies of death
Skulls are crawling with worms
Odor of rigor mortis
Skin is ridden with disease
Corpses living on dying flesh
Emaciated bodies buried long ago
Reanimated by the necromancer
Crawling from beneath the earth
Fulfilling ancient prophecies
Wounds expose the rancid blood
Mind intranced insatiable need
To take life from the living
Into realm of unknown
Disturbing sacred burial grounds
Revealing the dark remains
Remnants of the haunting demise
Emerging slowly from the crypt
Night is dark air is cold
Hungry dead take your soul
Consumption of flesh living die
It is forbidden to stay alive
