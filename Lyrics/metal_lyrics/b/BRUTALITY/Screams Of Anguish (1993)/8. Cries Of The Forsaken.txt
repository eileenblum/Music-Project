[Music: Fernandez, Acres]
[Lyrics: Coker]

Circling the ceremonial fire
Vultures swarm
Shredding carnage in chaotic frenzy
Scavengers feast
Body parts strewn amongst the horde
Showers erupt spewing viciously
Arteries severed
Suffering a tormented existence
Pain in voked torso sliced
Stripped of meat skeleton exposed
Brutally torn flesh adorns my domain
Demoniac beasts embellish the beyond
Fragments of bone
Trails of scattered cartilage
Carnivores attracted to the scent
Shocking genocide affects the helpless
Intense agony open wounds
Fighting over the corpse
Entrails cut to pieces
