[Music: Acres, Gates]
[Lyrics: Coker]

Tomb of desecration
Sadistic land eternal doom
Entrapped in illusion
Prison of insanity
Surrounded by walls of labyrinth
Trapped inside with no escape
Painful scars chained in agony
Death is eminent
Unaware of the tragedy
Screaming to be released
Rotting crypt
Exist to be deceased
buried in the mausoleum
Cremation of the damned
Rise within my subconscious
To seek the other world
Hidden dimensions skeletal remains
Rancid and cold hordes of decay
Drained of the power I bestowed
Indignant suffering
Smothered as the blood flows
