[Music: Gates]
[Lyrics: Coker]

Mourning the souls passed away
Unearthing deceased spirits
Dark cemetary sombrous gloom
Doomed are those who enter here
Confusion grows path obscured
Blackened clouds shrouded sky
Twisting shadows malformed ghouls
Erected tombs in cavernous vaults
Hieroglyphics etched in stone
Inscriptions carved revealing
Birth and death
Running for your life
Excavate
Demons from the earth
Ghouls attack
Burn deceivers
Worship the evil god
Those who deceive suffer
Punishment
