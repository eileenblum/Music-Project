Admired from a far
Mesmerized wondering
Feelings intense
Strong and secure

Weaknes
Not a factor
Suddenly
Stopped in time

Light flashes in the mind
Visions of the past
Vivid memories
Thoughts of the end
Questioning reality
Opportunities in the future
Chances not taken
Anger and resentment

Sorrow piercing
Through the heart
Walls are built
To protect

Breached by trust
Conflicting beliefs
Emotions
Controlling actions

Cutting ties of all commitments
Vows
Forever broken
Returning back
To ones self
Fears
Have been conquered

Leaving a mark

That all will remember
