Selfishness and greed
Feed the ego of man
Strip the world of its resources
Living closed minded
Leaving behind
The dead and the weak
Animal species
Becoming extinct

Mankind
Strives for knowledge
Concrete towers
To the skies
Civilizations
Built and destroyed
Industry
Over consumption

Pain and sorrow
For all the living
Pollution fills
The atmosphere
Poison clouds
Angry seas
Coastal cities
Swallowed

Continue to fight
Each other for survival
Even though
There is no time
To save themselves
No politics or religion
No order
Mass confusion

Endless darknes
Seeing through blinded eyes

Food and water
Running scarce
Vegetation dies
There is no light
No time to evolve
Bring themselves to extinction

Intelligence lost
With all the technology
Moments in time
Desolate wastelands
Ruins of humans
Life returns
Without interference
The world soon will heal

Continue to fight
Each other for survival
Even though
There is no time
To save themselves
No politics or religion
No order
Mass confusion
