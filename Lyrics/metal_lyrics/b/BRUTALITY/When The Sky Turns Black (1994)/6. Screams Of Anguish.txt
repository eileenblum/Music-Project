Melting faces swirfing souls
Man chained to wall of doom
Eyes stare as gloom surrounds
Twisted world of agony
Destination unknown - Lost universe
Through complex and convulted pathways - Time eludes

Reoccurrences of taunting revelations
Scratching frantically to escape - World of torment
State of confusion - Filled with dread
Hateful images

Mind seduced in hypnotic trance
Pleads for eternal life - All will fail
Disenchanted agonisingly torn
Pain grips apathetically
Wounds drain - Carcass has been devoured
Chaos breeds - Xenophobic thoughts emerge
Ravaged land - Amidst destruction
Anticipates the end

Harsh enslavement - Striking with force
Explosion smashes - Penetrating - Heavily engulfed
Punished and shrivelled - Final attempt
Saddening pity violence erupting - In vicious display

Extreme power decimates
All exist deceiving
Subconscious fear
Transformed
Task never-ending
Throughout this dream
Distorted perception
Controls the mind
Hostility surmounts

Trapped in a frightening maze
Twisting thorns gouge
Desensitised - Vortex opened
Silhouettes of shadows pass
Consumed by fog and mist
Scared reality
Life remains depressing

Lost in a place

You will not find
