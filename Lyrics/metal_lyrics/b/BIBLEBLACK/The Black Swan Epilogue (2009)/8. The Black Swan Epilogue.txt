[music â Mike Wead / lyrics â Mike Wead]

A calculated stride into the quiet night
Profane thoughts, echoes, no vows, no fright
Black beads untouched by God
Radiant glow, purified flow
A rosary of pure black light
rests in a clinched hand

...and somewhere a black swan sings
...alone

The water is dark and cold severed from tomorrow
Promising timeless time, no pain, no sorrow
Silent ripples will fade and die
Wilted eyes found peace...at last
A rosary of pure black light
drifts into oblivion

...and somewhere a black swan sings
...no more

I shall embrace the unknown
My heart holds no fear
And I shed no tears
As I cross the last great frontier
I'm free
