[music â Mike Wead / lyrics â Kacper Rozanski]

In her house of sorrow - I'm the little voice inside your head
You can hear her song - Telling the story of the dead
There's no tomorrow - Every new beginning has an end
There's no right or wrong - I know it's hard for you to understand

She's always waiting - Every little thing is bound to die
To relieve your strain - Some of you may call it the divine
In death fear nothing - Listen to the meaning in my voice
Enter her domain - None of you will ever have a choice

Fulfill me
I feel you by my side
You're the One
Called the unnamed bride
No form
Behind the veil so cold
Please tell me,
Is there forever?

Indulge me
Show your alchemy
Come fourth
Oh, sweet blasphemy
This time
Carry the pain back home
I beg you
Lead me, I'll follow

You're the end of all my fears
You're the line that we all cross
You're my angel sent from hell

My head's sick of all the memories
My life is a promise of release
What for? Why do I still remain?
Please tell me
Am I eternal?

Aversion, stuck in flesh and blood
No more, let me see beyond
This form, this vague reality
I beg you, open my third eye

You're the end of all my fears
You're the line that we all cross
You're my angel sent from hell

This is not a suicide
This is in my mind
Only thing that I can call my own

Flame up queen of profanity
Show your face, take my sanity
Obscure, behind the twilight sun
Please tell me
Is there tomorrow?

Demonic visions fill my mind
Is that you? The dread of mankind
So pure, embedded in my heart
I beg you, fill me I'm hollow

You're the end of all my fears
You're the line that we all cross
You're my angel sent from hell
