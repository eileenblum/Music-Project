[music â Mike Wead / lyrics â Kacper Rozanski]

Youâre lost
Cast away
This is your changeless war
Bringer of death, misery

Iâm gonna...

Blacken your eyes and devour your soul
You called my name and now Iâm in control

Kneel down, it is time
Let me lead you astray
Give in to me, let it in

I tell you...

To drink my blood as I open my veins
Dismember this body and burn the remains

Why try to find love
Stay away. Reign forever
Weak, sick, freak
Youâll never see
Be free
Never

I am Legion

At last, we are one
Bound by the truth of blood
Open your eyes
It is done

I can feelâ¦

Your spirit twisting and turning inside
My name is Legion, we scorn the divine

Now grow and convey
Become my chosen One
Burning the earth, unleash hell

Iâm gonnaâ¦

Lead the forsaken to their fall from grace
Extinguishing all light with one black embrace

I am Legion

I will broaden your senses, make you walk on air
But first I need you to witness the stream of your thoughts
and identify the deflection within
in order to see the abstraction of presence from all existence
There will be no image of this in your memory
But you will consider your own death
Then you will be conceived

I am Legion
I am Legion
I am Legion
Iâmâ¦
Perdition
I am Legion
I am Legion
I am Legion
Iâmâ¦
Perdition
