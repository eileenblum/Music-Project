[music â Mike Wead / lyrics â Kacper Rozanski]

I shed no blood
Never for a leach like you
So wipe that grin from your face

I bow to no God
Heaven holds no place for you
Come close Iâll end your disgrace
Pathetic little worm

Is there a reason for you not to see?
The lesson is ending and you need to bleed

A soul so sheer
An animated empty shell
I know youâre failing inside

You are what you fear
In this world you live your hell
You run but you cannot hide
You need a little more

Is there a reason for you not to see?
The lesson is ending and you need to bleed

We all die alone in this perfect world
Nothing can take away your end from you
Tread carefully over these dead bodies
Thereâs no difference between action and reaction

Youâre so polite
Manipulation infuriates me
Choke on your sick serpent tongue

Get out of my sight
Walk away. You know youâll never be,
the unseen or the unsung
Time to go to war

Is there a reason for you not to see?
The lesson is ending and you need to bleed
There is a difference between you and me
Now I am commanding you down on your knees

Is there a reason for you not to see?
The lesson is ending and you need to bleed
