[music â Mike Wead / lyrics â Kacper Rozanski]

The flesh
The evil of man
The disgust
Is pure
The guilt
The evil of man
Define lust
Is divine

The minds
The evil of man
The possessed
You're
The dead
The evil of man
Youâre all blessed

Itâs all desolated
The system is flawed
The oceans of time have consumed the beginning of thought

The evil of man
All you teach
Is true
The young
The evil of man
The power of speech
Refined

The truth
The evil of man
That you need
Anew
The game
The evil of man
The deceived

Itâs all desolated
The system is flawed
The oceans of time have consumed the beginning of thought

The fear
The evil of man
The divine
Convey
The word
The evil of man
Grand design

Itâs all desolated
The system is flawed
The oceans of time have consumed the beginning of thought

The evil of man
The loss
Abide
The condemned
The evil of man
Unholy cross

Itâs all desolated
The system is flawed
The oceans of time have consumed the beginning of thought

The evil of man
The intent
Incite
The means
The evil of man
The sick descent

Itâs all desolated
The system is flawed
The oceans of time have consumed the beginning of thought
