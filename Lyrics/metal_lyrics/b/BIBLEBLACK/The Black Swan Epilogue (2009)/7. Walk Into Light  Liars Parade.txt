[music â Mike Wead / Marco A. Nicosia / lyrics â Mike Wead]

An imagery your mind cannot perceive
Like a relic hidden in the strangest weave

Open your eyes
Open your heart
Walk into light
Liars parade

A path to follow for the blind and numb
Like an icons blessing for the deaf and dumb

Open your eyes
Open your heart
Walk into light
Liars parade

[Guest lead guitar - Marco Nicosia]

Eyes of glass are staring cold as ice
When the air turns thick of all the rotten lies
As you nail your words into my bleeding heart,
then tell me whatâs the sense of your perverted art?

Open your eyes
Open your heart
Walk into light
Liars parade
Liars parade
Liars parade
Liars parade
