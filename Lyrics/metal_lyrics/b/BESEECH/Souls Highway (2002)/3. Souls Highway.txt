Was almost there but slided back
tried to go further but was out of fuel
wanted to be with light and see
all the beauty was there for me
but had to pull over

[Chorus]
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
my chance to reach the skies
souls highway, souls highway tonight
this time I will be there
Souls highway, souls highway tonight
This time my life will end
souls highway, souls highway tonight
this time my life will end

I had a taste from beyond
I wanted more but they took it away
I had to stay in this cold place
instead of a life in eternal grace
please let me go back

[Chorus]

tired of all, tired of this world
now it's time to try again
see the light increase the speed
and fly away

[Chorus]
