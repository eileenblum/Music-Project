Don't you feel its' more than this
if you concentrate
take a look between the truth
and things you can not see
try to break this courage chain and leave
yourself a while
step inside your deepest fear and separate this
world

[Chorus]
Yes I can feel disturbance is the air
people that I knew are trying to break through
No I don't mind going for a ride to meet them
in the fiction city
to meet them in the fiction city

sometimes when I'm feeling down
I know that they are here
reflections of what they have seen
ain't easy to ignore
with respect of who they were before they
touched the sky
step inside your deepest fear and separate this
World

[Chorus]
