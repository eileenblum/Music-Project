Help me to get through my mission inside
help me to respect who I am
show me something real I understand
I wish that I could feel

[Chorus]
Read between the lines
and maybe you'll find out
what they are made of
why they shine so bright

Help me to forget sunshine today
help me find out where I am
I wasn't aware of the pain to come
I wish that I could feel

[Chorus]

Fly into the sun, but never touch the light 

Read between the lines
and maybe you'll find out
what they are made of
why they shine so bright
