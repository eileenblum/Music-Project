Slowly as they reach my soul
with confiding holgrams, why?
Someone pull the strings for me
I am getting weaker
now they're in control

[Chorus]
illusion made of glass
inside a screen
they transformate my soul
completely black
my skill to love is gone
I can not feel
hallucination comes
and makes me breathe

Someone paint my dreams in blood
with no compassion, why?
things that I touch and feel
are now behind the curtain
exit time, please

[Chorus]
