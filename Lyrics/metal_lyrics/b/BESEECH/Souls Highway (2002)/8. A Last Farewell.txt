My last second and angel came
time has come to say goodbye
a coldness began to creep inside
we must leave before the night
tears started to fall like autumn leaves
now it's time to go

[Chorus]
A last farewell this day
when the angel came for me

Where your soul should belong
what if it's not the world I dreamt of
there is no way back
I'm afraid of what will come
Now you'll face your sins

[Chorus]
