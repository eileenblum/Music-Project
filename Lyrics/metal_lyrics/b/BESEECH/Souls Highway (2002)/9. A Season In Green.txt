And a thought came sealing down
Imagination of you and I
so much depression by losing you
a new beginning without grief

[Chorus]
Painfully a season in green came
and our home went up in grief
someone came to bring us the message
saying that there
is nothing to do 

Do you have name my child
maybe that day something died
where are you now cold in a cage
try to be patient, here I come

[Chorus]
