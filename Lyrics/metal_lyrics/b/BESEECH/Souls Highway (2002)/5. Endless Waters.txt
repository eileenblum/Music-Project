My love I left you lonely
I'm bound to a long crusade
over endless waters
where the winds blow fresh and free
this is my place to rest
here isn't the place I wanted to be

[Chorus]
I've even lost our twilight tonight my dear
we'll never see the sun go down
I've even lost our twilight tonight my dear
we'll never see the sun go down, again

the waves my only monument
that reminds me of you
but I want no tears for me,
someday we'll meet again
this is my place to rest
here isn't the place I want to be

[Chorus]
