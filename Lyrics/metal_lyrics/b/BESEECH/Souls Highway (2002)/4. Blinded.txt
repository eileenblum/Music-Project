I remember a star
a star I can still see
one among the others
that shined so gracefully
I wish you stopped me
and embraced my soul
but now it's too late
and tomorrow I'll be gone

I was blinded my your lies

Lost in the shadows
of sins I made for you
the love you gave
is no longer mine
even when you're gone
the light will shine on
my memory of you
will never go away

I was blinded by your lies
