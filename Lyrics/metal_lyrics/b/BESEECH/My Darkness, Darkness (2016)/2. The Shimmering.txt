Scared to meet yourself further on
Sometimes our destiny goes wrong
For someone like you, and those who're among you
Everything fades, into oblivion
Branded by failure

Way down below, shimmering light
Deep down inside, subconscious flow

Every step we take on this road
Forcing us to break our boundaries
Nothing left to say, fade away
Everything I do won't change, oh no

Oh no, won't change
Oh no, shimmering, shimmering
