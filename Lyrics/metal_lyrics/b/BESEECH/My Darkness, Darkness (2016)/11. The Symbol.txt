So hard to breathe, the air in here
Too much confusion, to set the course
I'm hanging by, a fragile thread
Violated by myself

There's a burning sudden sign
A symbol of inconvenience
There's a psychedelic sound
Turning me on, turning you on today

Hell is pounding, at the door
There's no time, for second thoughts
Hey little vision, show yourself
What's your purpose? Let me in
