Time is running out
Don't you surrender, to the sound of time
It ain't so tender, for a beating pulse
For a beating pulse...

If we can't surrender, for the days ahead
If we can make up for, for the days behind
There's nothing we can, but to breathe and die

There's no point in trying, if you're out of plans
There's no time for regrets, when the art is done
Feeling all the feelings, in a lonesome fall
