Drifting through an endless crowd
Feeling insecure
Gazing through a modern age
A black hole in my mind

Lay your hand in mine, feeling so low today
Lay your hand in mine, where do we go from here?
Lay your hand in mine, show me the atmosphere
Lay your hand in mine, tell me that everything is fine

Welcome to my bubble dear
Unbreakable?
Everlasting pleasant past
With cracks in the wall
