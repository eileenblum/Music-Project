Don't wanna feel, what is like
Cause I know they're broken
Tired and cold, so many tears
In their black horizon
Don't wanna hear, about the price they paid
It's hard to get up  when, life feels incomplete

Hello Mr Uninvited, what is going on?
Sorry Mr what have we done? This isn't really fair

Don't wanna see, a mother in pain, or the hell that follows
Nowhere to go, this is the end, hand in hand with sorrow
Don't wanna say, look for a brighter day
A walk in the sunlight, down memory lane

Hello Mr Uninvited, what is going on?
Sorry Mr what have we done? This isn't really fair
Hello Mr we're not buying, the hell you got on sale
Sorry Mr Uninvited, this isn't really fair

Don't wanna be, side by side, with the Uninvited
So hard to lose, the ones you love, Mr Uninvited
