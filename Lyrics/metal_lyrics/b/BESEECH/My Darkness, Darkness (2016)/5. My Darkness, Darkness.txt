There's no room for tears when the deal is done
People they are waiting for the end
We can no longer see, if we're done and out

Death will do us apart, my love, darkness darkness
Nature is setting the rules, my love, darkness darkness

Death was catching up on the other day
It hurts to be aware it ain't gonna last
Therefore I must face it, my deepest fear
