I can't deny, devoted to watch the sun
All of my feelings, want to be reloaded
I need to feel, reliance between the lies
Oh, I'm in trouble, cause I'm out of light

Please don't judge me, I just wanna maintain

Can you tell me all about the starlight
The ingredients tonight
Can you tell me more about the sunbeam
The ingredients of daylight

Lucky to find, a shortcut throughout the night
But there is darkness, in this country song
I need a drink, to make me half a machine
One more to summon, what is left in me
