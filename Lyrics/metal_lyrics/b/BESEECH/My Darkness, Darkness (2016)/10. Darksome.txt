They went for a ride, through cosmic delight
But only one survived
Life isn't fair, when some of us leave
When you can't say no, no more

They crashed into, the unfairly
Can't clarify the events
So I keep waiting, for an explanation
Now I wish they are free

So long dear friends, be prepared today
Life can be darksome, but shiny in so many ways
So long dear friends, take it as it comes
Life can be darksome, but shiny in so many ways
