The sum of grief is way too high
Sanity is on the line
There's a storm of fear a head
It ain't easy to prevent

People fade away, but their presence remain
People pay their dues, when the storm is calling in

Broken dreams of vanity
Harmonize with shades of black

I guess we're equal now
No one else to blame
No limits on the line
The storm is calling in
When the day calls your name

Tear stained blues, made of thoughts
It makes me wanna hesitate
