And I close my eyes, I wait for her
Please help me die, please end my tears

Standing by the sea, watching her rageing waves
Beautyful as she, no one could ever be
Praying for the rain, to wash me down to her
And to end my pain, forever in her arms again

She takes my hand, she leads my way
In a distant land, where silence dry my tears

Rain is pouring down, the storm will be here soon
Meeting her alone, midnight is her gown
The wind never calms, as it caress my face
The cold feel so warm, as I dive into her arms

And I close my eyes, I wait for her
Please help me die, please end my tears
