Awakened by the sun, and the whispers from the mirrorland
Caressed by its beauty, I will travel through space and time
The life I once lived, is forgotten and has turned to dust
My soul has now entered, the dimension of the greater ones

I close my eyes to see myself
I will meet the dreams, and the spirits in my phantasy
Their touch will heal me, I can walk through the mirror again
I am inhuman and a guardian of the dreams

Tables have turned, caressed by its beauty
Release your soul and fly free
Accept its existence, be brave
Take my hand and fly away

I close my eyes to see myself
I will meet the dreams and the spirits in my phantasy
Their touch will heal me, I can walk through the mirror again
I am inhuman and a guardian of the dreams
