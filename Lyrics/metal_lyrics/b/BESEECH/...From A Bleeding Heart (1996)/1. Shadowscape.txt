I am the Guardian, the keeper of time
I hold the seven keys, to places you never been
I show you secrets, of things you never have seen
So trust in your darkest thoughts,
and follow your dream

Dreams of another home,
with pieces of tomorrow
I've seen the future, and what is yet to be
So raise your hands, and call to the gods
Your destiny is ready, to lead the dreams

I can behold your dreams, cause I gave you life
Death is another home, of fallen angels
Your life will become a thought, and you will forget
So sleep into deeper minds, and dream to remember

The dreams take me away, I'll become inhuman
I touch the deeper soul, of eternity
So raise your hands, and call to the gods
Your destiny is ready, to lead the dreams
