In the beauty of the endless, crimson sunrise
That makes me feel so warm
I am drowning my sorrow and my pain
But I'm feeling the season now change

Feel the winds blowing harder, tearing my eyes
By the dusk getting colder, summer now dies
All alone with the midnight, embraced by fall
ANd the fire of the moonlight
Burn us all

The autumn sky shines so red
And all I loved is dead
The seasons change in the darkest of pain
Will we ever see the sun again?

And the beauty of the endless, crimson sunrise
Will never come again
Now the darkness is covering the sky
And the winter is freezing our souls
So we cry together with the pain
When we leave the summer behind
