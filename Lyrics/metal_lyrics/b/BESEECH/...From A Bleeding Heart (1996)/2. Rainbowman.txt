In the garden of the kings, is everything so grey
Colors are all gone
But in shelter of the time, by the breeze of dawn
Comes a man, and today he will help my friends

Rainbowman, rainbowman who are you?
Rainbowman, rainbowman give me a clue
Rainbowman, rainbowman heal me too
Rainbowman.....

And in the garden the time has flown away
And the silence has turned to be peacefull
Here is no color, here is no life
No everything is grey

In the garden of the kings, in every heart of stone
Colors start to flow
So the garden starts to grow, life will breathe again
Now the colors last forever, thanks to rainbowman

Rainbowman, rainbowman who are you?
Rainbowman, rainbowman give me a clue
Rainbowman, rainbowman heal me too
