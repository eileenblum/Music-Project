Falling from heaven, into a sleep
Dirty little angels, is looking at me

God ripped out my eyes, he closed the door to heaven
He gave me wings to fly, and made me taste the human blood

Can you see the blood, falling from her eyes
Don't you feel the mistress, of the crimson sky
Come here fly with me, and I will show you tricks
Invite the dead into your dreams
And watch out for that crucifix

Falling from heaven, into a sleep
Dirty little angles, is looking at me
Just look away

God ripped out my eyes, he closed the door to heaven
He gave me wings to fly, and made me taste the human blood
