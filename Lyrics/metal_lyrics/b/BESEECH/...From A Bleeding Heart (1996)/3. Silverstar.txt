One with the stars
A star is calling inside of me
Embraced by a flame
Eternal flames inside of me
Caressed by a light
Silver light inside of me
Deep inside of me...

In a distance I see,
My sacred funeral
Rivers of tears, in family eyes
They scream out my name, and wish me heaven
But I feel the grace
Far away...

I am the heartless one,
I'm black inside
I am the silverbound, the mighty one
I am the evil one, I love the dark
You are my spellbound soul, and you will fade away

In the stars I will find, a mystical land
Nocturnal grace, close to my heart
I will forever, trust in the stars
Trust in the silver, or else I will fade away
