Suddenly the dawn was here, and so the winds
These were the magic winds, from a foreign land
It may take time, to learn to fly again

Oooh mighty winds, listen to my heart
I know you feel, the eagle inside of me

I am the skyborn son, please take me home
Home to the clouds, from where my heart belongs
Now I see the light, of the stars that will guide me home

Oooh mighty winds, listen to my heart
I know you feel, the eagle inside of me
