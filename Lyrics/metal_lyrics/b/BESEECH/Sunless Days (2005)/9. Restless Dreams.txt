This is a story from a restless mind
A wicked mind
Bewildered worlds forms a meaning unknown
Unleash I lie
The letter haunts me and the silence appear
I stand alone
My body shivering when the hill calls my name
Changing shame
Trapped inside myself
Screaming to get out of here
Restless dreams of you
I am trapped inside myself
Screaming to get out of here
Restless dreams of you
Outless get weaker as the fog lies down
Crystal clear inside
The pyramid falls and my blood starts to flow
The lies was mine
Trapped inside myself
Screaming to get out of here
Restless dreams of you
I am trapped inside myself
Screaming to get out of here
Restless dreams of you
