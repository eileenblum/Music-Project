I feel it move two steps behind
Moving fast into the night
Flashing lights keeps passing by
See the pain that's in their eyes
A screaming child what have I done
See the cold has gripped their spines
Turn around I'm not alone
Lost my faith I'm on my way
Thing's you've said
Thing's you've done
When someone else controls your mind
You'll get worse before the end
You cannot feel you can just bleed
Cannot feel can just bleed
Bleeding under cold street lights
People scream they're all afraid
Blame myself is this my fault
A growing seed of evil deeds
A sickness that has gone to far
Closing in t he chase is on
Turning back is not my choice
Lost my faith I'm on my way
Thing's you've said
Thing's you've done
When someone else controls your mind
You'll get worse before the end
You cannot feel you can just bleed
Cannot feel can just bleed
