I'm resigned beneath the sky
To walk on the endless fields
Only the night take
My only dream away
It's my last obsession
It's my last obsession to get away
And I see illusions
I hear whispers all around
I tried to hold them back
Even if I
Circle around and I try to reach the sun
It's my last obsession
Circle around and I try to reach the sun
It's my last obsession to get away
My hope has flown away
To find a way from here
Another day alone
Without sharing
Circle around and I try to reach the sun
It's my last obsession
Circle around and I try to reach the sun
It's my last obsession to get away
