I have been where silence dwell
Tried to keep you far away
I feel something' still around
It has been kept from us
All illusions are just fraction
Of the fears that they stole from your mind
I can touch what you can't reach
I cannot hold them back aahhh
All illusions seems so real
I can touch what you can't reach
I cannot hold them back aahhh
It's the outpost of my mind
When the darkness came you saw
Now I share what you believe
You are in my silent room
Now I understand it
All illusions are just fraction
Of the fears that they stole from your mind
Now you touch what I have reached
You cannot hold them back aahhh
All illusions seems so real
Now you touch what I have reached
You cannot hold them back aahhh
It's the outpost of my mind
I can touch what you can't reach
I cannot hold them back aahhh
All illusions seems so real
I can touch what you can't reach
I cannot hold them back aahhh
It's the outpost of my mind
