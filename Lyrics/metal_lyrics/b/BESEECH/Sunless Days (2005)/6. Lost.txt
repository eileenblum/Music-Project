Lost in myself I cannot feel
Control I aim I stumble and fall
Believing you that's why I loose
Emotionless I'm falling apart
Reaching for you but falling through
Confused I am I'm loosing ground
Embraced by you in my own mind
Bolding on to the sweet beliefs
Calling out my own reality screaming out all my fears
Overwhelming by all insanity sacrificed a thousand tears
Calling out in pain my weaknesses fighting to get back whole
Overwhelmed by madness lost in the darkness of my soul
Woke up alone but in my heart
You were there whispering my name
Want to go back to the same old place
Where we belonged until death do us part
I close my eyes and numb my heart
Wish for sleep but only face my truth
Embraced by you in my own mind
Holding on to the sweet beliefs
Calling out my own reality screaming out all my fears
Overwhelming by all insanity sacrificed a thousand tears
Calling out in pain my weaknesses fighting to get back whole
Overwhelmed by madness lost in the darkness of my soul
