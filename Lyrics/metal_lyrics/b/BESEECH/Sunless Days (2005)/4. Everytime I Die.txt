Through nightmare
Shades and dreamy hughes
Still hunted by the thing I've made
My shadows still linger all around
Will it never end?
Dying to change trying to relive what's gone
Life's flashing by every time I die
Dying to change trying to relive what's gone
Life's flashing by every time I die
Another day in solitude
This isn't how I want my life to be
A growing seed of despair
Please leave me be
Dying to change trying to relive what's gone
Life's flashing by every time I die
Dying to change trying to relive what's gone
Life's flashing by every time I die
