I know your kind
I've seen that smile
I won't let you come back
But you know
Just how to make my world fall back
Just how to make my world tu rn black
I cannot breath
My mind is blank
You're laughing when I cry
Why did you bring
My happiness so deep inside
My happiness there just to die
Just how to make my world fall back
Just how to make my world turn black
On sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay
You're hiding now
I'll cut you out
My sky will gather clouds
Where can I go
I try to hide but can not find
I try to leave all things behind
My happiness so deep inside
My happiness there just to die
'cause on sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay
I try to hide but can not find
I try to leave all things behind
'cause on sunless days we're side by side
Sunless days
Sunless days
My emotional decay
