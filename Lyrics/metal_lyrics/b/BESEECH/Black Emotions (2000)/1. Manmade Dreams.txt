[Music: Robert, Klas]
[Arrangement: Beseech]
[Lyrics: Jorgen]

Turn around, watch me move
To the ground, I bring you fool
Listen to the smallest sound
Wake up now, you cannot hide
You made mistakes, it's time to pay
Foolish boy, is what they say
So back up now, and take your fall
Listen to your conscience call

I am your conscience baby
I follow where you are
You don't believe it baby
I hunt you to the other side

Listen up, hear my words
Your ignorance will be the drop
The time is here, this is the end
Choose your side, foe or friend
Make it quick, and make it smart
Or your life will fall apart
So back up now, and take your fall
Listen to your conscience call

I am your conscience baby
I follow where you are
You don't believe it baby
I hunt you to the other side

I am your conscience ...
I follow where you are
You don't believe it ...
I hunt you to the other side

I am your conscience ...
I follow where you are
You better believe it ...
I hunt you to the other side
