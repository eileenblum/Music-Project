[Music: Klas]
[Arrangement: Beseech]
[Lyrics: Jorgen]

I see her walking through the shadows
A scent of parfume as her head lays to my chest
A broken heart completes the circle
She screams out loudly as my tongue touches her breast

Come to me now, Velvet Erotica

No friend of God, no she's unholy
Erotic dreams makes you a victim in her sight
From black velvet comes her beauty
And like the wolves, I hear her howling through the night

Come to me now, Velvet Erotica
