[Music: Klas, Mikael]
[Lyrics: Jorgen, Klas]

Cold and lonely, all by myself
The winter caresses my soul
Freezing, the dark is calling me
Makes me dream of...dream of you

Stolen from life within
You will find something on your own
Falling inside my dream
Makes me dream of...dream of you

Can toy feel the magic in my soul
This neon ocean flowing through my heart
So if you can hear me let me know
'Cause I can show you oceans that you need
The oceans that you need
