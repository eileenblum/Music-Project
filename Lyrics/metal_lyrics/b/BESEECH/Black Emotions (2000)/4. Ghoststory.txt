[Music: Robert]
[Arrangement: Mikael, Klas]
[Lyrics: Jorgen]

We lost the paradise of curiousity
Now we're bound to live in anxiety
All we have is hope to find the answer
of the greatest question, will we live forever

We all dream of.....
So we head on.....

Now cast aside your fears, and start believing in
there's a world beyond this, a beginning
We may not see it now, but in the final
it will be much greater than our survival

We all dream of.....
So we head on.....

In a new tomorrow, with all the reasons
we can watch our past, and all the seasons
Now we know the answer, and if you wonder
we can tell you, we will live forever

We all dream of.....
So we head on.....
