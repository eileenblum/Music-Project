[Music &amp; Lyrics: Klas]
[Arrangement: Robert, Mikael]

Late at night while you're asleep
I come for you my dear
I would like to show you how, how to firewalk
You should know, how I feel
I love you, come on let's burn

Get inside my firecircle, hand in hand we burn
Round and round we spin my darling
Can you feel the heat

How about a firewalk, through the flames with you
Can you feel the trance I bring
It takes you somewhere else
I am scared to do you harm
I love you, come on let's burn

After all the choice is yours, if you want to stay
I cannot force you dear, you mean too much for me
You should know, how I feel
I love you, come on let's burn

Get inside my firecircle, hand in hand we burn
Round and round we spin my darling
Can you feel the heat
