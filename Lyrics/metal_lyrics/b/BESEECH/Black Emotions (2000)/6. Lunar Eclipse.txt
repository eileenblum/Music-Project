[Music: Klas]
[Arrangement: Beseech]
[Lyrics: Jorgen]

I could feel her soul, walking beside me
Like a thousand roses, with thorns that cut too deep
By her place I stand, with a picture in my hand
Now my tears are falling, leaving traces in the ground

Sail away
On my trail of tears from the other side
Sail away
&gt;From the world you knew before it conquers you
Sail away
Take the time to see your independency
Sail away
May my prayer be heard in the light of la luna

I would like to join her, in her brand new world
A part of me is dying, since you left our world
I hope you'll be allright, even if it hurtsSail away
Please come back to me I'll make you whole again

Sail away
I will cure your heart you'll have a brand new start
Sail away
In my mind I free you from your misery
Sail away
May my prayer be heard in the light of la luna

I saw it coming through the atmosphere
Now I've been waiting for her
In a flash her image disapears
Now I've been waiting for her...now I've been waiting for her
