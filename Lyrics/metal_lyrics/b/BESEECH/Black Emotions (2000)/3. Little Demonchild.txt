[Music &amp; Lyrics: Klas]
[Arrangement: Robert, Mikael]

Can you feel the wind blow, closer day by day
Blowing with a motion, for a brand new day

Demonchild, why have you been gone
Do you still miss, miss your family
Oh, I'll bet it hurts to loose so much

Can you feel the wind blow, closer day by day
Blowing with a motion, for a brand new day

Demonchild, what have you been through
I can still hear, hear you crying
So you better find a cure

Can you feel the wind blow, closer day by day
Blowing with a motion, for a brand new day
