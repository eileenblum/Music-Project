[Music: Robert]
[Arrangement: Beseech]
[Lyrics: Jorgen]

I heard some noice, it was pounding on my door
And then came voices, told me I will see some more
I close my eyes now, hoping all was just a dream
I am alright now, but then came all the chanting screams

What have we done
We forgot to love the world
And the souls from beyond
Banished us from the earth
What have we done

Well, we must solve this, in a good way or another
If we go on this way, we'll be the one's without the color
So make your stand now, you can't be the on who hides
Be the man who leads us, through all the waters we will fight

What have we done
We forgot to love the world
And the souls from beyond
Banished us from the earth
What have we done
