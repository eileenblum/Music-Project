you told me to walk your way
when i followed for that simple reason
our fate was to stay
together 'til our souls departed

your will was my word
you tried to go against my speach
my word was you'd stay
together 'til our souls departed

you had no choice
was that my destiny
you belonged to me
in sickness and in health
i was your puppeteer
was that the way it should be
together 'til our souls departed

i would never change it
not for anything in the dark world
thank you for those days
i will keep them in the dark side of my mind

the day that youchanged
i will condemn the day 'til i die
what about those words you said
together 'til our souls departed

you had no choice
was that my destiny
you belonged to me
in sickness and in health
i was your puppeteer
was that the way it should be
together 'til our souls departed

the rain clears my thoughts
i embrace it like the night i live in
i'm rather lost than possessed
you will learn the rules
this life is just a game we're playing
and we will lose
there is no way to move the pieces

you had no choice
was that my destiny
you belonged to me
in sickness and in health
i was your puppeteer
was that the way it should be
together 'til our souls departed
i will keep them in the dark side of my mind
