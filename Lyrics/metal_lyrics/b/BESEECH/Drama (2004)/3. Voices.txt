i wanted you to know my name
wish that you could read my mind
you are a ghost in my dreams

you're distracting my mind
see the secrets that i hide
and i'm just trying to avoid them

i'll never forget somebody like you
i wanted to feel that you belonged to me

now i know that you were real
hope you know how much i miss you
how could you push me that far

you manipulated my mind
revealed the secrets that i hide
and i just had to keep you from them

i'll never forget somebody like you
i wanted to feel that you belonged to me

how did hate become love
didn't you get enough
why did you let me cross the line

i'll never forget somebody like you
i wanted to feel that you belonged to me
i'll never forget somebody like you...
