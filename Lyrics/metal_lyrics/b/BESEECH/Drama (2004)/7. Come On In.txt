today is the day
you reveal yourself to me
please don't speak
cause i'll greet you, i'll greet you with my kiss

i watched you from my corner
i felt your eyes from here
i knew that i adored you
when you heard, when you heard me say

come on in, come on in to my world tonight
i want to feel you, feel your life through mine
come on in, come on in to my world tonight
i want to see you, see your eyes catch the sun

just think about all we will go through
it'll take time
a lifetime
a lifetime to proceed

i open my life wider
i crawl inside your skin
you make my body shiver
when you hear, when you hear me say

come on in, come on in to my world tonight
i want to feel you, feel your life through mine
come on in, come on in to my world tonight
i want to see you, see your eyes catch the sun
