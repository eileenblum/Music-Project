these words doesn't seem real to me
what did you try to say
somewhere you hide from me
i just cannot find out where

you left a letter
how could i tell
i know you can hear me
forever i will
i try to reach you
but i still fall
forever falling

i still can feel the touch of your lips
caress and tease my skin
i close my eyes and drift away
i find my way back to you

you left a letter
how could i tell
i know you can hear me
forever i will
i try to reach you
but i still fall
forever falling

without any words i left that world
i don't feel any regrets over the last decisions that i made
the pain i left behind me made a scar in my soul
that will last forever to remind me

you left a letter
how could i tell
i know you can hear me
forever i will
i try to reach you
but i still fall
forever falling
