i can't resist nor refuse the thrill of lust you bring me
the contradictions taking me down
down to the darker side of me

the insecurity is my fear
to loose a part of me
a pray of courage reaching my mind
forgive me for my sins

get down on your knees when i command
lay back and take waht's yours to have
i know exactly what to do
to reach a higher level of you

the feeling of loosing control
to do what you desire
trembling from the shame you bring
you wanna make me beg for more

touch me, fill me do what you please
you're in control of me
the only things i hate to love
my god of pleasure

get down on your knees when i command
lay back and take waht's yours to have
i know exactly what to do
to reach a higher level of you

a higher level of you

get down...

get down on your knees when i command
lay back and take waht's yours to have
i know exactly what to do
to reach a higher level of you
A higher level of you...
