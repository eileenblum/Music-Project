one day i woke up to the light from the sun
i thought the night ghost were all gone
felt that things weren't like they used to be
waking with anxiety by my side

my heart, my soul everything's gone
everything's gone
my heart, my soul everything's gone
everything's gone

even the sun cannot light up the day
everything seems to be without colours
silence was the only thing i heard
wanted to go back again

my heart, my soul everything's gone
everything's gone
my heart, my soul everything's gone
everything's gone

my heart, my soul everything's gone
everything's gone
my heart, my soul everything's gone
everything's gone
