i want you, i need you
i cannot live without you
i touch you, i breathe you
i cannot die without you

i want you to believe
i want to know
i want you to feel
that i'm your god, i'm your god

i ache you, i bleed you
i cannot hate without you
i crave you, i beseech you
i cannot love without you

i want you to believe
i want to know
i want you to feel
that i'm your god, i'm your god
