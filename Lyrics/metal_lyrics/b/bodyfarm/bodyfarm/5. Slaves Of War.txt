Guns are blasting from the trenches
soldiers shouting out the pain
Toxic gas disturbs the breathing
this war is making you... insane

Generals gathered safe in comfort
What is next, where will you go?
Victims in the web of power
this war is forcing you to die

Oil winning dirty games of power
Civil targets victimized
Righteous men devoured by cannons
sudden death is your reward

Napalm is burning around you
machine guns are firing in bursts
Treason by kingdom and country
the price you will pay is absurd

Suffocate, obliterate, welcome to hell
Capitulation comes to your mind
Annihilation, erase the traces, they'll never tell
The enemy is coming, erasing mankind
