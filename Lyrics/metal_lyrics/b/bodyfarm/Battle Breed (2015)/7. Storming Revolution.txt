Sick of nobility and the upper class,  
destroy the aristocracy for it's cancerous,  
gather all your friends and pick up your weapon,  
gunpowder crazy, it is now or never 

Revolution, revocation,  
domination, execution 

Wave the flag of hate as we're marching to the bastion,  
a symbol of oppression but now we're gonna crush them,  
we're gonna free the prisoners and we'll kill the guards,  
Storming Revolution, join with us and march 

Revolution, revocation,  
domination, execution 

Firing into the crowd, it doesn't hold us back,  
revolution trembles as we launch the storm attack,  
the power of the common folk can't be ignored,  
breach the gate, feel the hate, now it's time for war 

Retaliate,  
take it back,  
nobility,  
make them bleed
