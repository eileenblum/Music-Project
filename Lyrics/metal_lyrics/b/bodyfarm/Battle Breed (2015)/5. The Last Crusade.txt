We are crusaders in the army of the Pope,  
send to Jerusalem by the church of Rome 
The holy land awaits for the righteous to reclaim,  
exterminate the enemy without remorse or shame 

Chainmail is shining in the light of the sun,  
the banners of the cross are waving in the wind 
Proudly we march to the walls of the city  
not afraid to die, we will gain eternal glory 

The retribution of a nation,  
reclaim what is theirs by the power of the light 
Domination for salvation,  
do as you're told for a seat in Heaven 

Army of God,  
we will reclaim what's ours,  
the holy land  
will drown in blood 

Blinded by the sun, sweat burning in our eyes,  
we're charging up the wall as we're screaming battle cries 
The enemy is hardened by centuries of battle,  
they won't give in that easily 

Their sabres cut through flesh and put our courage to the test,  
the enemy of God resisting to their very death  
Invasion of a nation,  
religion is the force behind mindless killing 

Army of God,  
we will reclaim what's ours,  
the holy land  
will drown in blood
