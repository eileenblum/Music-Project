Captured in youth by the Ottoman Empire,  
raised at the royal court as one of their own,  
educated and trained but also a prisoner of war,  
he was their best but still an outsider 

Impale the enemy,  
strike with fear 
Prince Of Wallachia,  
the dragon is near 

The years that would follow determined his fate,  
the heart of the prince was swollen with vengeance and hate,  
return to your home and reclaim the throne of your father,  
Vlad the Impaler was hungry for blood and revenge 

Impale the enemy,  
strike with fear 
Prince Of Wallachia,  
the dragon is near 

Ride out to face the oppressor,  
destroy him once and for all 
Crossing Romanian borders,  
don't follow me if you think of death 

Attack in the night when the enemy's asleep,  
caught by surprise, we are turning the tide,  
charge from the woods, use the darkness for cover,  
tidal wave of hate for the enemy will suffer 

Slain and battered the janissaries try to flee,  
look for survivors, set up the pikes and you will see  
what happens when you defy the prince, a wasteland of impaled enemies,  
let fear do its job, bring terror to their hearts and be free
