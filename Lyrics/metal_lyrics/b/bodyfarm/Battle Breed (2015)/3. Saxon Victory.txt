The rise of the conqueror, defying the kings,  
haunting their dreams, it's time to conspire! 
The Celts ride to war, to battle the Saxons,  
three king versus one but his power is growing 

Ring-giver to men  
won eternal glory  
of noble descent,  
ALL HAIL the warrior king 

They clove the shield, the warriors brave,  
nothing could stop them, no foe remains,  
hacking and slashing the enemy's face,  
bloodiest warfare, a bloodbath displays 

Ring-giver to men  
won eternal glory  
of noble descent,  
ALL HAIL the warrior king 

He was the victor over his enemies,  
proud men of the king showed their loyalty,  
they hewed battle shields with remnants of hammers,  
they wrote history, Saxon Victory!â
