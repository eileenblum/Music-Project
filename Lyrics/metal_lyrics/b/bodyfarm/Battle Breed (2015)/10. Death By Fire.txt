Out of the green Hell the devils came,  
screaming, filled with hate and rage 
Suicidal, no sanity left,  
embracing a certain death 

Death By Fire!  
Death By Fire!  
Death By Fire!  
Death By Fire! 

Fuel it up, no time to waste,  
blistered hand fix bayonets 
Death by napalm is coming fast,  
charred remains and molten flesh 

Death By Fire!  
Death By Fire!  
Death By Fire!  
Death By Fire! 

Ready for the firestorm,  
immolation divine 
Incinerate the enemy,  
fry 'em up, let them burn 

Agent orange from the sky  
supported by our Browning fire 
From the front and from above,  
welcome all, we have enough
