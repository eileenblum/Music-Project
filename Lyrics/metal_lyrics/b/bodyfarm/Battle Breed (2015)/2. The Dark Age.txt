In The Darkest Age centuries ago  
chaos reigned and ruled the world,  
Europe burned because of lack of order,  
tyrants battle against each other 

This is The Dark Age, time of despair 
The stakes are burning, death is always near 
This is The Dark Age, chaos declared 
The world in mourning, death is everywhere 

Behold the fallen empire, the sovereign lies dead,  
civilization destroyed, godforsaken land 
The people are abandoned, eyes are filled with fear,  
slavery is coming, for death by sword and steel 

This is The Dark Age, time of despair 
The stakes are burning, death is always near 
This is The Dark Age, chaos declared 
The world in mourning, death is everywhere 

Plunderers are raiding villages and farms,  
murdering and raping, burning grain and barns 
There's no way to escape the violence and hate,  
the rabble cries for blood and so you meet your fate
