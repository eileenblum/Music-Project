I woke up at dawn on the day of my death,  
I don't think that I will survive,  
the honorable task to protect the king  
was assigned to my brethren and me 

Bretons and Normans are marching this way,  
soon we will meet on this blood shedding day,  
battle horns breaking the peace of the morning,  
we have to ride out, we will finally face them 

They charge up the hill to break our lines,  
archers are shooting their arrows divine,  
they run into spears with their light infantry,  
no match for the Saxons who seek victory 

The enemy flees and our fire is lit,  
without a command we have set the pursuit,  
our lines are now broken, the king is exposed,  
the infantry scattered, the shield wall is battered 

Protect the king,  
ride to war for victory 
Protect the king,  
ride to war for victory 

All hope is gone as we watch behind our backs,  
we are surrounded and stolen from our task,  
the king is slain by an arrow to the eye,  
falling from his horse, on the trampled ground 

Death remains, now the king is gone,  
protect the crown, in death we'll meet again 
The last attack before we all fell down,  
the battle done, aggressors on the rise 

Protect the king,  
ride to war for victory 
Protect the king,  
ride to war for victory
