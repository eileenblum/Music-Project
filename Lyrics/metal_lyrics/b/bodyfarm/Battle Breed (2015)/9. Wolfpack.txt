Deep below the surface of the Atlantic ocean,  
lurking in the deep, stalking on its prey 
Terror of the allied fleet, always on their guard,  
nothing could they do against torpedoes from the dark 

They stalk their prey,  
observe the enemy,  
the Kriegsmarine hunts in packs,  
an alliance of ocean's death 

Wolfpack,  
Wolfpack,  
Wolfpack,  
Wolfpack 

Invincible blockade sinks the enemy's supplies,  
never saw it coming, made them terrified 
Counterfire silenced on the enemy's destroyer,  
the bottom of the sea was a grave to many 

They stalk their prey,  
observe the enemy,  
the Kriegsmarine is hunting in packs,  
an alliance of ocean's death 

Wolfpack,  
Wolfpack,  
Wolfpack,  
Wolfpack
