[originally by Massacre]Enter into the Netherworld,
forbidden tombs of horrors,
unhallowed darkened abyss
full of grotesque mutations

Obscure shadows project
from out of the Stygian black,
chronic screams of terror,
diabolical banishment awaits

Transcend deeper into dark,
astral gates unfold,
crimson spirits awake,
apparitional figures appears

Pneumatic dead surpass,
supernatural beings exceed,
trapped within this nightmare,
exiled into the Cryptic Realms

I AM GONNA TAKE YOU
DOWN
INTO THE ABYSS

Vanish beyond the grave,
mystical perpetual sleep,
cultivate visions and illusions,
horrifying universe of bizarre

Vaults of demonic doom
holding the hideous blackness,
vortex of chaotic evil,
monstrosities of death

Enter into the netherworld,
forbidden tombs of horrors,
unhallowed darkened abyss
full of grotesque mutations

Pneumatic dead surpass,
supernatural beings exceed,
trapped within this nightmare,
exiled into the Cryptic Realms
