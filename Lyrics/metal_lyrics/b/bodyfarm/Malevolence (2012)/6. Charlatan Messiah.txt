Preach all you want, convert the masses
Tell them to follow up all your farytails
I, the messiah tell you to fear your god
You be a good man and I will cleanse you of your sinds

Charlatan messiah
Charlatan messiah

You are the one, the true deceiver
In name of God or because of greed?
You pretend to be the peopleâs saviour
Just spread the fear and become a god yourself

Abuser of naivety your preaching is a lie to me
Culling hurds is what you do and demonise who critisize
Charlatan

Drown in the lies of the master of deceit
The cripple ones will walk, the blinded ones will see
Volunteer for his massive slavery
Loose your sanity in religious misery

Open up your eyes
For he who spread the lies
For you it is too late
To seal your own fate
