I am the Tombstone Crusher,
I vandalize your Grave
You'll Rot In Peace forever,
I will crush your Stone

I'll bring a shovel and a concrete hammer,
Graveyard riot act
I will be digging up your filthy Coffin,
desecrating your Grave

As I open up this crate of Death
putrid smells fills my brain
You are rotten, a lot more than I thought,
ghouls are coming for you

Ghouls are coming for you!!

Your putrefaction is what drives me mad;
the tool to turn me on is the smell of Death

I don't feel no regrets!!
