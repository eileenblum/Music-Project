Demons hunt you every Sleeping hour,
wide awake but yet you are Asleep
Horrors are awaiting,
a desperate survival through the Night

Fearing the Terror of sub-consciousness,
cannot Wake Up, demons persist
Fight to return to my sanctuary,
I can't take no more

Your Sheets are the gates to purgatory,
dying to be Awake
Paralyzed by mental rape, its misery,
comatic state of mind is living Hell

Fearing the Terror of sub-consciousness,
cannot Wake Up, demons persist
Fight to return to my sanctuary,
I can't take no more

Sleep Terror, beyond
Sleep Terror, Nightmare
Sleep Terror, worst fear
Sleep Terror, now die

Never to Wake Up AGAIN!!
