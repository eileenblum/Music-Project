Your filthy life has ended here; you're six feet underground,
maggots will devour you until there's only bones
Your face - so pale, your skin - so cold, you never got old,
your parents cry because you died, they should have known

Lay down your life,
give it to me,
I am all that you've got

I am your joy,
your sanctuary,
I am all you need

Innocent - it seemed to you, how harmful could it be?
The force to empower your weak personality,
the drugs are flowing through your veins, the rush is kicking in,
welcome, my deceiving friend and take over my brain

Lay down your life,
give it to me,
I am all that you've got

I am your joy,
your sanctuary,
I am all you need

Living in anxiety, you're paranoid and weak,
you're no longer in control, you need the rush of energy
Nauseating chemicals, your teeth are falling out,
degenerate and horrified, leaving you to die
