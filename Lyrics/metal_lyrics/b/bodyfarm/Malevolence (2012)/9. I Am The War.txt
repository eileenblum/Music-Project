I roam the nations,
I bring them death,
I give them hatred,
fire and blood

I was unleashed
aeons ago
and I will be here
for another thousand years

I Am The War
I Am The War

By some I'm hated,
by some I'm loved,
when I'm summoned
I do my job

Through my disciples
I reign in blood,
they will obey
and bring you on your knees

I Am The War
I Am The War

Bombs will fall,
cannons roar,
raise your sword,
set the world on fire

Spreading chaos,
harvest death,
thousand cities burn,
The War is raging on

The reprobation
of humanity
is fed by urge to dominate

Until the end of days
the world will suffer from
the embodiment of hate

World demise,
global terror,
clouds of ash
are coming down

Armageddon,
the curtain falls,
this is the end
of it all
