As I look at the world
as it is now
I see a place full of terror,
violence and war

With aversion I watch
how regulation revolts,
Malevolent species,
we love to hate, we hate to love

Malevolence!!
Malevolence!!

Injustice systems
are ruled by vile dictators,
murder and torture
by their interrogators

And they will put you away
like rats in a cage
for speaking your mind;
you'll disappear and never return

Malevolence
Malevolence

The streets are the scene of suburban warfare;
powerless law won't help you there
because the masses will follow wherever there's war,
a nation in flames, burnt to the core

Never there's been a war of this size,
global decay due human demise,
I am beholding the war from afar,
without compassion I hate you all

Malevolence
Malevolence

As I watch humanity
digging it's grave
Malevolence
is upon me

Revolting society, humanity is dead to me!!
