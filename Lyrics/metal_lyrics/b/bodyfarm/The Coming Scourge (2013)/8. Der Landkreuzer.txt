Crushing through concrete defense bunkers 
Thunder roars over allied lines 
Marching on to the line of fire 
Panzerdivision is in sight

Thousand tons of terror
Crushing through the lines

Shaking knees as the ground is trembling 
Thousand tons of death riding on 
Massive guns ploughing hidden foxholes 
Screaming FLAK's tearing allied flesh

Thousand tons of terror
Crushing through the lines

Deep inside its bowels generals command 
Advance to the frontline, held for many months 
They will find resistance by fierce artillery 
Infantry defending to death or victory
Calling in the air strikes and activate the mines 
Incinerating fire, these woods become a tomb
