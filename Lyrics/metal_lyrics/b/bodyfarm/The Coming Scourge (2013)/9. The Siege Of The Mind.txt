I am screaming deep inside mg head
There's so much anger stacking up
I am holding on to what I have
On the edge of sanity

Demons truing hard to take me down
To a point of no return
Devil's vultures torturing mg mind
Feeding on my joy for life

Try to refind mg peace
I must hold on
Try to break through the siege
and slay the intruders
Losing the oversight
I need to regroup
Kill the aggressor
Spread mg wings and fly away
