In your final hours, looking back upon your life
Have you been a loyal servant? 
Have you been a humble slave to the holy one?

Time is slipping away, thy kingdom come
Do you need salvation, son? 
Drink from the well of decay

Drink from the well of decay

I will guide you on your mission, 
Iâll bring purpose to your quest
Take my hand and trust me, and youâll find rest

Enter the realms of the Netherworld
Your soul will belong to us

To refine your purity
Your soul now belongs to me
Bathe yourself into the well
Clear your sins and be reborn

Drink from the well of decay

Deceived in all your desperation, by the cult of the damned
Devoted to the Vatican, but your heaven is denied

Tormenting pains, the final chapter of your life
You are passing away now, to the other side but thereâs no light

Drink from the well of decay
