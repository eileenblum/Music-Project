Here I remain unbroken and true
Surrounded by enemies slain
I've broken their swords and shattered their shields
The baffle Is finally done

Draw your sword and hold the formation
Spears up high for the battle is here

We felt the fear but it disappeared
As soon as we ran to our doom
The losses were high, the victims piled up
But we fought with fire and heart

Draw your sword and hold the formation
Spears up high for the battle is here

Here I stand where they are slain
The baffle ends and I remain
