As the world is burning bombs are falling down 
Fighting, killing. dying. Landmines underground 
Soulless mercenaries firing at will
Psycho military bred to maim and kill

Waiting in the trenches for the counterstrike 
When the night is falling catch them by surprise 
Running through the minefield, snipers In the trees 
Blasting mortar fire, kill the enemy

March towards certain death.
No matter what stripes you have
Join us in the killing fields,
Emotionless: we do not feel

Throw away your life and be devoured by the war 
Set aside your self-respect, obey your generals 
Forget about desertion, they want you to die 
There is no way out of this, only suicide
