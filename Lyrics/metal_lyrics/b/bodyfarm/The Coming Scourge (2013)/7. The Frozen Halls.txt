Ride the Hearse, your time has come 
The coin is waiting, it's too late to run 
You're on your own now 
I'll take you to the frozen halls 
There's nothing there 
Only death and despair

We have arrived at the land of none
The wind so cold under the black sun
Let them guide you
The whispers of the dead
Hades waiting
Upon his frozen throne

Silhouettes and shadows
Guiding you towards
The frozen halls
Destiny is near

Close your eyes
and hear their cries
Hopes and dreams
are lost inside the frozen halls
