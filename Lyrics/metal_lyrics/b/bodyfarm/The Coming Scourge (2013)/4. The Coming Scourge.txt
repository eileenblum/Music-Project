Enslave the world, we march with Men
We have come here to slay the human race
Our armies vast, as far as you can see
We wield the burning chains of hatred

Destroyers of divinity are marching to their victory 
The era of humanity is coming to an end

Our scourge is spreading across the earth 
The people fleeing out their burning capitols
They pray to god to save their lives
Don't you understand who send us?

Destroyers of divinity are marching to their victory 
The era of humanity is coming to an end

We are religion, we are at war
We are the scourge, we're marching on

Destroyers of divinity are marching to their victory 
The era of humanity is coming to an end

Mass obliteration by a self-destructive race
Blaming on each other the horrors that we face
Enslaved by fear, enchained by hate
Enraged by war we await our death
