This is my rat race
I'm alone and lost to this world
Happiness is something I can't afford
Thoughts of what could have been never entered
my mind cause there's nothing there when I began
I tried to fit in but failed
Like a speeding train I've derailed
I've gone down the useless path that's only heading
for the sacred nowhere land
Don't want to see you smile
Jealousy and envy boils inside my head
The pressures of life have tripled since I became a fuckin man
Don't feel whole inside
I'm alone
Better of if I had died
I'm alone
I raise my hands to the sky
I'm alone
And ask god why am I still alive
Lady luck turned her back on me
I'm alone
Opportunity never knocked on my door
I'm alone
Then you wonder and ask me why I'm so jaded and angry
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Never needed anyone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I accept my destiny
Being ignored has spurned in me
Contempt for anyone that I see
There's no cure for what I've got
I've tried and fight but the pin is nonstop
I'd isolate myself but necessity had locked me in
It's like a fuckin sin
It's here where I belong and where I've always been
Don't feel whole inside
I'm alone
Better of if I had died
I'm alone
I raise my hands to the sky
I'm alone
And ask god why am I still alive
Lady luck turned her back on me
I'm alone
Opportunity never knocked on my door
I'm alone
Then you wonder and ask me why I'm so jaded and angry
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
Never needed anyone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
I accept my destiny
