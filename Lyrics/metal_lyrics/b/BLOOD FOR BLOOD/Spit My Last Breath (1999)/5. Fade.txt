There's only one sure thing in this world for me
and that is one day my life will end
Until that faithful day arrives for me
I'll drown in misery meant only for me
This is all because I failed in life my friend
I've failed in love again I've lost all hope
it won't get better I fade away my friend
I fade into my pain I give up this hurt is not worth it
Life's been long hard lonely road
I've hit dead ends at every twist and turn
Nearer to the end if I'm meant to lose I wont lose alone
I'll make sure you learn all about loss
You might think my hatred has pushed you away
you're never close enough to know what's in me
My wounds can't mend can't heal this pain
or save the soul of the one so damned
Self destruction on a daily basis intoxication is my only oasis
I do my best believe I can but in the end
I've come up short again there's no will left to better myself
The unrelenting hatred in me has got control of me
Youthful dreams a reminder of a useless past
Overlooked by love I'm found dead last
I failed in life my friend
I've failed in love again
I've lost all hope it won't get better
I fade away my friend I fade into my pain
I give up this hurt is not worth it
I will remain alone as I fade away
No will left to live I'll just fade away
I'm drowning right before your eyes
I'm smiling but I am dying inside
I'm laughing but the voices torment my head
I think I'm better off dead I'm drowning right before your eyes
I'm smiling but I am dying inside
I'm laughing but the voices torment my head
I think I'm better off dead
