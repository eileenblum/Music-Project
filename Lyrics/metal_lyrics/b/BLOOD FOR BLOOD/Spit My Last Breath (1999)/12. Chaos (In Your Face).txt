So I hate you
Much resentment and pain just drains
So I revel alone in the madness inside my brain
I tell you now I don't know how
I don't feel these metal wounds within
Will never heal
My deal was to be alone
That ain't as sad as the fact of being bad
This world's gone mad to the chaos we add
Listen up to what I'm about to say
You preach peace stop the hate
Useless youth feels only
Frustration rising inside inside
Hate still burning inside inside
Chaos will hit you in your face
Chaos in your face
Chaos in your face
Life on the streets is rough
Right or wrong you must be tough
Crime seems like the only way
Down the wrong path you'll become a prey
Chaos in your face
Chaos in your face
Chaos runs wild on the streets
A large part of Me's defeat
Major cause of our downfall
Something I can't ignore
Sometimes I imagine what I'm going to see
Troubles and turmoils fate's got a hold on me
Fuck that
Chaos in your face
Chaos in your face
This time you've gone too far
Sentiments there are no more
This ends justify my means
This ends in that which I believe
I clench my fist to you
I'm right here
What you gonna do
You ain't tough You ain't nothing punk
So let's throw down and show what you got
