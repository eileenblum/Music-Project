Everyday I wake to find nothing has changed
Still down on my luck I pray
Alone still has to be this way
Above me the skies will remain grey
Got jealousy for anyone that's happy
You don't know I hate you want to hurt you
See you suffer, you won't hear the cries
For help in me my fear I writhe in pain
I was born to lose
Angry and alone is what and how I was meant to be
Hatred and fear will always be a part of me
There's no salvation for me I know that
I am cursed for all eternity
Maldito - Yo naci Maldecido
Bastard - Cursed with life and endless disappointments
Monster - Learn to deal with what I've become
Outcast - There's no reason to live there's only
Hatred - Sometimes that's all that's real
Terror - Sometimes that's all I feel
Paranoia's got a strangle hold on my mind
I want to sigh in relief but not this time
It seems now a days to stop this torture
need to drink and drink to forget the future
Even the people in my life hardly know me
The malice and rage I stride to hide and control
I want to end this pain my luck drains away like rain
There's only endless pain
Maldito - Yo naci Maldecido
Bastard - Cursed with life and endless disappointments
Monster - Learn to deal with what I've become
Outcast - There's no reason to live there's only
Hatred - Sometimes that's all that's real
Terror - Sometimes that's all I feel
We're the cursed hide behind friendly smiles
There's a need to crush and hurt to avenge our loss
Day in day out the pain is too immense to bear
My hatred grew cause no one ever cared
I fail and fail at everything I do
I hope, I lose, to me it's nothing new
I try, I fail, I crash and burn
I've lost again I die this curse will never end
Hatred - Sometimes that's all that's real
Terror - Sometimes that's all I feel
Hatred - Sometimes that's all that's real
Terror - Sometimes that's all I feel
