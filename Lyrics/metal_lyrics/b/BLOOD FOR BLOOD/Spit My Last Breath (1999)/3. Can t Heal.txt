Do you know how hard I tried but I fail
Do you know that I tried my best but I lose
Don't you know I'm so envious I've got nothing
Dead to this world cause I'm all alone
Time goes by another wasted year there's no way out
I lose myself to another fear I've lost again
Deviously low scum is what I've become I want you to die
But that's just a lie because I've never changed
I feel my hatred about to explode
Feel my anger consume you whole
You're weak cause life was kinder to you
As for me my goal is to make sure you learn what's misery
My feelings are gone I'm numb inside
I feel they steal I can't heal cause that's my deal
My feelings are gone I'm numb inside
I feel they steal I can't heal cause that's my deal
We won't rot alone the ones we hate
Their ends will comfort my hate
My plans were set long ago
Destroy all the hopes that you've known
Crush all your silly dreams
You're life aint as perfect as it seems
Now feel my hatred explode
Now know my plans are a go
Now I'll complete my revenge
Now my lost dreams I'll avenge
You could never understand
Who I am what I am what I've become
I will spit in your face
Until I die for who I am
And what I've become
You could never understand
Who I am what I am what I've become
I will spit in your face until I die
