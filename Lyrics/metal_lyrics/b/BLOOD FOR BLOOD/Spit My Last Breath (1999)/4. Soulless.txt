Why me
A question I ask myself everyday
My life is hell must it be this way
No chances were ever thrown my way
Was it the luck of the draw
Was I destined to rot away
I question my purpose here
I've also got no one to endear
I'm resentful bitter and more
So all the negative things that happened
I've just stored
Here we go again I'm losing restraint
Here we go again I'm not afraid to
show you how much I hate you
Your views ain't nothing in my eyes
Pathetic outcries lies my rage flies high
We ain't the same in this game where pain reigns
There's no gains hate remains every day just drains
There's nothing here just loathsome misery
Longing for unity is just a fantasy
I can't assimilate to what I can't relate
I feel great irritate there's always hate
I've been left behind, surpassed by my so-called peers
There's nothing for me just sad lonely misery
There's never been a future ahead
None as far as the eye can see
No breaks It's holding me down
Crushing me to the ground
Hatred I am soulless misery has left me soulless
I am your enemy don't turn your back on me
I am the enemy you made this hate you see
I ask myself why I'm so blessed
Blessed with nothing but rage that won't relent
My luck in this world was still-born
So I mourn be good be bad so I am torn
Stay out of trouble my head I drill still
The shit in my life is enough I want to kill
You're telling me how to be and what to do
You got no clue I'm true to me so fuck you
I've been left behind surpassed by my so-called peers
There's nothing for me just sad lonely misery
There's never been a future ahead
None as far as the eye can see
No breaks It's holding me down
Crushing me to the ground
Hatred I am soulless misery has left me soulless
I am your enemy don't turn your back on me
I am the enemy you made this hate you see
I ask myself why I'm so blessed
Blessed with nothing but rage that won't relent
My luck in this world was still-born
So I mourn be good be bad so I am torn
Stay out of trouble my head I drill still
The shit in my life is enough I want to kill
You're telling me how to be and what to do
You got no clue I'm true to me so fuck you
I believe in nothing
There is nothing left to hold me up
I believe in nothing
Slipping and sinking to a worthless existence
I believe in nothing
There is nothing left to hold me up
I believe in nothing
Fading away to an empty nothingness
I know I've been overlooked why me
Can't find happiness could it be that I don't see
Left in the dark why me
Why must I play the victim in this game
That mocks me
I know I've been overlooked Why me
Can't find happiness could it be that I don't see
Left in the dark why me
Why must I play the victim in this game
that mocks me
I know I've been overlooked why me
Can't find happiness could it be that I don't see
Left in the dark why me
Why must I play the victim in this game of misery
I believe in nothing
There is nothing left to hold me up
I believe in nothing
Slipping and sinking to a worthless existence
I believe in nothing
There is nothing left to hold me up
I believe in nothing
Fading away to an empty nothingness.
