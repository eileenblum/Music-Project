Bullshit
Who the fuck do you think you are
You've taken this a bit too far
Believing you're king shit
In your fake fantasy
A clown dress to impress
Soft core, Mickey Mouse and nothing less
Exposing you will make me rest
Until then remember you're
A bullshit fake Paper Gangster
You ain't nothing but an image and a liar
A bullshit fake Paper Gangster
Softcore motherfucker
Could it be you're really not from the streets
Could it be you saw it on TV
The way you act where I come from
You'd never last
Could it be you're lying through your teeth
Liar
Once a long time ago
I was naive to all I know
People tried to push onto me
Their week mentality
I woke up to and I know
I am real and not for show
Unlike you who knows inside
You're soft because
A bullshit fake Paper Gangster
You ain't nothing but an image and a liar
A bullshit fake Paper Gangster
A Punk Ass motherfucker
The life I've lived the pain I've felt
With such things you never dealt
So to me you are a maggot
So when you go and outcast me
And I can't do a fuckin thing
Know that I know inside
You're weak
