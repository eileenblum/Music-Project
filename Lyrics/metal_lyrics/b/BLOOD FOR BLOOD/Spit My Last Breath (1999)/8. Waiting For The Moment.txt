Long lonely nights
My thoughts are a mess
I know what I want but what I want I can't get
Can't tell what day it is sometimes sometimes I sit alone and I cry
And I think off all the things that have gone wrong with me in this life
Grim loneliness and sorrow thrives in me
The seeds of hate have matured at an accelerated rate causing doom to loom
Waiting for the moment I decide it's time to die
Grim loneliness and sorrow thrives in me
The seeds of hate have matured at an accelerated rate causing doom to loom
Waiting for the moment I decide it's time to die
My childhood memories are a pain ingrained in me
To reminisce is to open up old wounds I tried to leave and bury behind
I've lost I've lost too many times
I've failed I've failed in society's eyes
Fuck them fuck them I'll show them as much mercy as this life has shown me

Grim loneliness and sorrow thrives in me
The seeds of hate have matured at an accelerated rate causing doom to loom
Waiting for the moment I decide it's time to die
To reminisce is to open up old wounds I tried to leave and bury behind
I try to better myself but the rush and stress of life
seems to have pushed everyone ahead and left me behind
I've lost I've lost too many times
I've failed I've failed in society's eyes
Fuck them fuck them I'll show them as much mercy as this life has shown me
Long painful nights
My thoughts are a mess
My thoughts have become one
I want to end it now
I want to take all those I hate with me on a journey of pain tonight
There won't be any thing you can do about it
cause when I decide it's time it'll be time for all to pay
It's the only way the only way for my conscience and soul to rest at ease
I belong nowhere
Outcast
I belong nowhere
Outsider
