What you see is what you get
What you said ain't always what you meant
Things were said and things were done
But in the end who turned tail and run
You were so blind and you were riding so high
But you'll see my face alone when you cry
The tables have turned on you
Look inside yourself see the real you
I just want to hurt you
I just want to make you feel my pain
I am dying silently
I will lash out and make you see
Hear your laughter and watch your leisure
Bash your learning face to disfigure
Coming after you with a vengeance to stop
the resurgence of your failed devotions
Judge yourself before you judge me
You're no better than I am
You will see
A message toward your bleeding hearts
Get out our way before our hatred starts
The state, my state of mind is only hate
The hate that dwells inside of me is to infuriate
I can't begin to describe what's inside
I hide the fatal thoughts of final suicide
There's many things that I have to sort
within my head
It's all the bullshit that as a kid I was fed
I can't tell who's real and who's fuckin fake
I take a breath before I seal your fuckin fate
I just want to hurt you
I just want to make you feel my pain
Look around you see the world decay
Can't you see that I don't see things
the same way that you do
