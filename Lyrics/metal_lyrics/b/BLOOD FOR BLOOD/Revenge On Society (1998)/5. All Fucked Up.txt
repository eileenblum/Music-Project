Well as of late I think I've tripped and gone astray
Maybe I'm no good
Somewhere along the line I've lost my way in life
Maybe I'm no good
Waiting for a better way, waiting for the better days
I've gotta stop pissing my life away
But I can't find any shelter, maybe I'm lost forever
Maybe there's no way out
Not everybody grows up the same
Some have to deal with oppression and rage
When you now you know you've got no way out
you find a way to deal with the pain
It started as a casual fling, I'd take a drink
and everything would seem alright
But now I know I've go no way out 'cause this addiction is with me for life
I used to drink form the bottle, but now the bottle seems to drink from me
Lately when I look in the mirror it's a stranger staring back I see
I tried to find the answer at the end of a bottle while inside I was crying
but I kept on trying
you can't hurt something that's already broken
I've fought the world but now my will is gone
I've got to stop living my life all fucked up (all fucked up)
But I just can't seem to get it right because I'm all fucked up
'Cause I've been living, living my life, living my life all fucked up
For years
I look around and see what's going down, and it's all fucked up
I gotta get out
I gotta get away
Maybe it's too late
Maybe I'm fucked up
