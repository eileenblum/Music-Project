I sit alone in my dark room
Visions of my life flash before me
Remembering, then thinking, realizing the world has only fucked me over
And the pain mounts
It builds up, it builds up inside, oh yeah (It's time)
I'm a time bomb ticking motherfucker
A ticking time bomb motherfucker
So all I want, all I need are reasons, reasons for my anger
Reasons for my hatred and fear
This world around me, so cold and harsh
Not letting up, not letting anyone succeed their hardships
and loses and panic and stress
From my life I can't ever expect any less, I guess
But the human mind and soul can only take so much
I've lost my soul and there's not much of my mind left
(It's time) I'm a time bomb ticking motherfucker (My time is yet to come)
A ticking time bomb motherfucker (My time has not yet come)
(It's time) I'm a time bomb ticking motherfucker (My time is yet to come)
A ticking time bomb motherfucker (My time has not yet come)
I stand here and accept the fact I'm alone,
alone in a world that doesn't want me
I stand here and admit my defeat,
defeat of everything I've ever tried my hand in
I stand here and acknowledge my loss, the loss of a gentle heart and soul
I stand here and welcome death,
a death that will cost all those who forced me to hate
I'm a time bomb ticking motherfucker (My time is yet to come)
A ticking time bomb motherfucker (My time has not yet come)
I'm a time bomb ticking motherfucker (My time is yet to come)
A ticking time bomb motherfucker (My time:)
There's never been a place for me in this world
Cold in callous without love is what's me
No more mistakes on my part
Cause I lose when I use my fuckin' heart
I can't go on like this anymore oh no
Cause if I do I'll get hurt even more, so I'll just bottle it up and explode
Vengeance will be mine
For hate's sake, I can't forgive and forget
For hate's sake, from now on no more fuckin' mistakes
For hate's sake, I can't forgive and forget
For hate's sake
For hate's sake, I can't forgive and forget
For hate's sake, from now on no more fuckin' mistakes
For hate's sake, I can't forgive and forget
For hate's sake
Yet another wasted day, another wasted year, another river of tears
Fuck the world and fuck you
(It's time) I'm a time bomb ticking motherfucker (My time is yet to come)
A ticking time bomb motherfucker (My time has not yet come)
I'm a time bomb ticking motherfucker (My time is yet to come)
A ticking time bomb motherfucker (My time has not yet come)
I'm a time bomb ticking motherfucker (My time is yet to come)
A ticking time bomb motherfucker (My time has not yet come)
