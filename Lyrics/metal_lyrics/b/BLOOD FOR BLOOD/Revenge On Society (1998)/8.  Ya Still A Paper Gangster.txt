Bullshit!
Who the fuck do you think you are you've taken it a bit too far
Believing that you're king shit in your fake fantasy
A clown dressed to impress.
Soft core, Mickey Mouse and nothing less
Exposing you will make me rest
until then remember you're a bullshit fake paper gangster
You aint nothing but an image and a liar
A bullshit fake paper gangster
a punk ass motherfucker Could it be you saw it on TV?
The way you act, where I come from you'd never last
Could it be you're lying through your teeth?
Liar! Once long, long time ago, I was naive to all I know
People tried to push on to me their weak mentality
I woke up and I know I am real and not for show
Unlike you, who knows inside your soft
because you're just another bullshit fake, paper gangster
You aint nothing but an image an a liar
A bullshit fake, paper gangster
A punk ass motherfucker
Bullshit!
(I) I know what lies inside
(I know) what lies behind your lies
(what lies) behind your lies inside
(inside) I know your lies
You're just another fucking bullshit fake, paper gangster
You aint nothing but an image and a liar
A bullshit fake, paper gangster
a punk ass motherfucker
The life I've lived, the pain I've felt
with such things you've never dealt
So to me you are a maggot
So when you go and outcast me
and I can't do a fucking thing
know that I know inside you're weak!
