The crime... birth
My motive's clear
my final objective is to destroy and conquer all that I fear
The fears in me instilled through the years
that's causing growing pains
I think back I get irritate so full of hate
The truth behind the madness I faced as of late
I get irrational, but not emotional
Show no emotion will teach them to fear and respect
This world's gone straight to hell fast
It's broke my heart and soul like shattered glass
It's very happiness feeds my hate
It's very existence will open the gates of rage
I'm filled with distress
I want to destroy everything that's ever filled me with rage
I'm filled with distress
I want to destroy everything you've ever known and loved
I seek revenge on society
To destroy all you've ever known
I want revenge on this world
For my crime of being born
This fucking world and life owe me
a lifetime of heartache and pain while you've thrived
and you don't fucking know me
And I'll do all I can to rip your world apart
And I will prove why it was wrong for me to ever be
And I will unleash my vengeance upon thee
I seek revenge on your society
to destroy all you've ever loved
I want revenge on your world
for my crime of being born
For the crime of being born
