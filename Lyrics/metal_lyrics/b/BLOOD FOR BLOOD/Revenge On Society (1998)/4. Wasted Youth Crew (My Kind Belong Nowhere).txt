Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck society to
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck the world because
my kind, my kind, my kind belong nowhere
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
We all started as someone with a chance to make our way
Sometimes the world was cold but we waited for the better days
We watched the years go by and nothing seemed to change
We waited, hoped and prayed as the hard times felt like stinging rain
Well now that hope is gone, somewhere it turned to rage
Hatred, violence, booze and crime,
sometimes it seemed the only way (to get by)
I always knew I'd never make it cause I'm twisted in the brain
But I swear to you all right now that I'll never live like the ones that made me hate
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck society to
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck the world because
my kind, my kind, my kind belong nowhere
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
I know I'm going nowhere and I been on a losin' streak
and a scumbag, zero and anti-hero are all you think of me (and you're right)
I know I'm going nowhere and I been on a losin streak
and lowlife, loser and dead-end cruiser are all you think of me (but I say)
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck society to
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck the world because
my kind, my kind, my kind belong nowhere
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck mankind
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
Wasted youth, I never had all the chances
Wasted youth, I never had no savin' grace
Wasted youth, yeah I've made a few mistakes
Wasted youth, but how long will I have to pay?
So, some of you were born into happiness and wealth
While some of us were born to a life of hell
And some of us were lost and some of us were found
but most of us were beaten by life to the ground
And maybe I'll never see the day that I win
but I'll always have time for a beer with my friends
We'll fight everybody and the world 'till the end
and if you fuck around with us you'll get your head kicked in!
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck society to
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck the world because
my kind, my kind, my kind belong nowhere
My kind, my kind, my kind are hated and feared
