i turned my back on society when society turned it's back on me
i'll be an enemy of this world until the day i fucking die

i am of the mind and the opinion that if something doesn't accept you...
you do everything in your power to fucking destroy it.
i don't care if it's the world, society, 
your family or a fucking high school keg party.
you do everything you can to hit back...and strike back.
let go of some of that fucking hatred
i wanna poison this world the way it fucking poisoned me.
i'm gonna to everything, EVERYTHING in my power to corrupt, to twist, to 
destroy, to rip apart, to poison.
i'm gonna spit my last breath in all your faces.
you're gonna hear me laughing at the end.
fuck you.
this is all about revenge on society you fucks
