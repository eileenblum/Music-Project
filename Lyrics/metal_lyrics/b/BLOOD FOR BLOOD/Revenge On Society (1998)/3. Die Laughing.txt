The things I've done and the things I've seen are the foundation for the pain
that lies in me it never leaves
The pain becomes pure hatred,
the hatred just burns, it burns, it just fuckin burns
I'm being overwhelmed I'm losing control
my childhood ripped away my innocence they stole
It's time to learn true fear on reckoning day
the grand finale I'll never shed a tear
I want to piss on the ashes of your twisted world
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing burn, burn, burn
Because all I have is hate for our twisted world
and when it falls I'll die laughing
I wanna spit on the ashes of this twisted world
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing burn, burn, burn
Because an enemy of man is what I am and when the end comes
you'll hear me laughing
Psychotic laughter as the world I hate burns away praying's no use we've
reached the judgement day of our lives
We'll all meet our demise
The guilt ridden and the innocent must now cry and die in pain
The world will reach out to repent any chances have
been spent and this is what was meant
This world built by hate it'll soon be too late
and we can't ever deny our fucking fate
I want to piss on the ashes of your twisted world
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing burn, burn, burn
Because all I have is hate for our twisted world
and when it falls I'll die laughing
I wanna spit on the ashes of this twisted world
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing burn, burn, burn
Because an enemy of man is what I am
and when the end comes you'll hear me laughing
The glee on my is contempt for the world the end pleases me it excites me
Armageddon my prayers of hate are answered
and now you'll hear me laughing
I'll shit on the ashes of this fucked up world as I watch it burn
let it fucking burn
The last glimpse this world will ever see is me laughing aloud
Bring it on!
