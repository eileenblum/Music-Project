Go! Now I'm older and my mind is set
I'm moving like a guided missile haven't reached my target yet
I'm loaded with anger and adrenaline get so mad
and raged sometimes I forget where I've been
My thoughts are cluttered I'm confused
That causes a shortening of my already burning fuse
Been cheated on a chance to lead a normal life
Everything I've ever done has always ended in strife
In the night, the night always brings the pain
I feel so dirty, my hands, my hands are stained
Can't see eye to eye with anyone, my mind is set and done
You can't argue with a loaded gun
Sometimes, sometimes I feel I'm going insane
with all these sick thoughts in my head I'm going evil in the brain
I lack any type of common sense 'cause I always want to solve
all my problems with my fists and violence
I think I'm going insane
I want to give fear to the world
Evil in the brain
you can't reason with a lunatic
I'm evil, evil in the brain
Evil in the brain are the only words I can use to describe
what I saw, how I grew and what I didn't want to know
I see the world die and not last long enough to see the blood dry
I'll die! Smirking and laughing as long as I get my goals in sight
That's right, it's end is what I wish for every night
And the world is going to hell in a hand basket
all I want to do is fill it's casket
I'm losing the cancerous tumor in my head I call a brain
I'm losing control
evil in the brain
Kindness or hatred, I can't tell the difference
evil in the brain
I wanna give fear to the world
evil in the brain
You can't reason with a lunatic
I'm evil, evil in the brain
Sick ideas seem so normal inside my brewing hate
but in everyday life I'm totally abnormal
And all I see is red I was misled
I wish I was dead instead of having being bled
And now it's me against the world
Right or wrong,
I haven't changed this long because my madness is that strong
But in the end the world will pay
I won't be held responsible there's never been another way
I'm losing the cancerous tumor in my head I call a brain
I've lost it
I'm going evil, evil in the brain
No pity for the suffering of the world 'cause my mind is fucked
and my heart is cold
Look at my face, there's no grace
and I'm laced with disgust for the entire human race
My mind is a fury traumatized by all their shit and lies
Broken promises and endless hatred for the world, it dies!
A recipe for madness in a sick cold world
I can't go on with these cards I've been dealt
I'll just fold
Evil in the brain
evil in the brain
