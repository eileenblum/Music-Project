Iâve always walked alone and Iâll never live like one of them
And though youâve been called my friend
Iâll walk this path until the end
Iâll always stand alone and Iâll never be like one of them
Youâve been living on the tears my friend
Iâll go where I want until the bitter end

Victim victim
I wonât be one they want to bring me down and be a
Victim victim
I wonât be one Iâm gonna hold my ground
Victim victim
I wonât be one They want to bring me down and be a
Victim victim
I wonât be one I wonât back down

Iâve always walked alone and Iâll never live like one of them
And though youâve been called my friend
Iâll walk this path until the end
Iâll always stand alone and Iâll never be like one of them
Youâve been living on the tears my friend
Iâll go where I want until the bitter end

And when the storm comes will it wash away my tears
And will it take away the sins of all my peers
Iâve always stood alone
Iâll always be alone Iâll never be like one of them

Victim victim
I wonât be one they want to bring me down and be a
Victim victim
I wonât be one Iâm gonna hold my ground
Victim victim
I wonât be one They want to bring me down and be a
Victim victim
I wonât be one I wonât back down

Iâll never be a victim
Donât want to be a victim
Iâll never be a victim
Of this twisted system
I wonât back down
