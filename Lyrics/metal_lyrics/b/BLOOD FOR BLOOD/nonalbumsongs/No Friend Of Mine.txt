I've seen your face and I don't like you
You're no friend of mine
I don't like any of the things you do
You're no friend of mine
You're no good it's easy to see
You're no friend of mine
I've told you before stay away from me
You're no friend of mine

You think that you can come around
and act like on of us
Just because you're in the scene
Doesn't mean that you can hang around
I see you everywhere I go
Talking to the boys
Don't you realize you're dirt
In everyone's eyes?

If I've told you one I've told you twice
You're no friend of mine
But you never listen to my advice
You're no friend of mine
What the f**k do you what from me
You're no friend of mine
I've told you before stay way from me
You're no friend of mine

You think that you can come around
and act like on of us
Just because you're in the scene
Doesn't mean that you can hang around
I see you everywhere I go
Talking to the boys
Don't you realize you're dirt
In everyone's eyes?

You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine

You think that you can come around
and act like on of us
Just because you're in the scene
Doesn't mean that you can hang around
I see you everywhere I go
Talking to the boys
Don't you realize you're dirt
In everyone's eyes?
