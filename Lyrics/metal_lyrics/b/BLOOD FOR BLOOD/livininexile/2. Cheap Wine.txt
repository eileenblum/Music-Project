Let's go!
It's just another wasted night
The world is going to hell tonight
I'm stuck in this hell tonight
I'm going down in the flames...
I been feelin' kinda down, I been feelin' kinda out
I been runnin' like a dog that's been kicked around the house
I been starin' out the window and walkin' through the streets
And findin' nothin' but decay in everything that I see
Where can you turn?
What can ya do?
When their society's got nothin' for you
I got hate for everything in sight,
and the world is going to hell tonight
But I'm gonna find some peace of mind
The world has gone to hell tonight
But tonight I'm gonna find some peace of mind...
If I drink this wine I can stand the pain
If I drink this wine I can play their game
If I drink this shit maybe I can bear...
Bear to be a part of this human race!
If I drink this wine I can stand this place
If I drink this wine I can stand your face!
If I drink this shit maybe I can bear...
Bear to be a part of this human race,
Bear to be stuck in this messed up place,
Bear to be lost without a trace,
Bear to be a part of this twisted human race!
I gotta find something to ease my mind,
In this world of shit, in this world of lies
Cheap wine!
I gotta find something to ease my pain,
In this world of shit, in this world gone insane...
