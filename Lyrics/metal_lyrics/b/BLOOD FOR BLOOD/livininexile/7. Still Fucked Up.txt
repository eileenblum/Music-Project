Well as of late I think I've tripped and gone astray
Maybe I'm no good
Somewhere along the lines I've lost my way in life
Maybe I'm no good
Waiting for a better way, waiting for the better days
I've gotta stop pissing my life away
But I can't find any shelter, maybe I'm lost forever
Maybe there's no way fucking out

Not everybody grows up the same
Some have to deal with oppression and rage (it's all fucked up)
When you know you've got no escape
you find a way to deal with the pain (it's all fucked up)
It started as a casual fling, I'd take a drink
and everything would seem alright (all fucked up)
But now I know I've got no way out 
'cause this addiction is with me for life
And it's all fucked up

I used to drink form the bottle, 
but now the bottle seems to drink from me (where do I go from here?)
Lately when I look in the mirror 
it's a stranger staring back I see (where do I go from here?)
I tried to find the answer at the end of a bottle 
while inside I was crying but I kept on trying
You can't hurt something that's already broken
I've fought the world but now my will is gone

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! (Where do we go from here?)
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! (Crash and burn, when will I ever learn)

I've got to stop living my life, living my life all fucked up
But I just can't seem to get it right because I'm all fucked up
'Cause I've been living, I've been living my life, living my life 
It's all fucked up
(For years, for years, for years)
I look around and see what's going down, and it's all fucked up

I've got to stop living my life, living my life 
It's all fucked up
Oh yeah
