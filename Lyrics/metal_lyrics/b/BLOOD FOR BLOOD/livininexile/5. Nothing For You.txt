I got nothing here for you
but a hate that runs me through and through
I got nothing left for you
I got nothing left deep inside, deep inside I cried
I lost something deep inside
Years ago, alone, I cried
I look back and wonder why,
I cried for help alone but where were you?
Where the fuck were you?
I lost something deep inside, years ago alone I cried
I got nothing left for you, I got nothing left deep inside
Deep inside something died
Let's go
What have I got?
I got nihilism
I got nothing, I got nothing for you
I got nihilism
I got nothing to lose
I got nihilism
I got nothing
I got nothing for you
I got nothing
