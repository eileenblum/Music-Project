Oh Yeah! (Yeah!)
Maybe someday Oh yeah!
We've been runnin' after hope, and livin' on a prayer, Oh Yeah!
The sign in the road says we're going nowhere, Oh Yeah!
We gotta get away, get away from here, Oh Yeah!
Maybe someday we'll find a way!

Hey baby I gotta tell ya', there's not much left of me.
I've been runnin' down a dead end street and livin' outside your society.
And maybe I'm kind of twisted, but maybe there's nothing pure (nothing pure)
But if you come with me, maybe we can find what we're lookin' for, Oh Yeah!

The sign in the road says we're going nowhere, Oh Yeah!
Maybe someday we'll find ourselves a way!

Well baby, you know I come from nowhere!
Yeah you know it baby!
And yeah baby, I know that you don't care (you don't care nuthin' 'bout me!)
I've searched this cold, cold world for so many years...

And I've been runnin' after hope and livin' on a prayer.
The sign in the road says we're going nowhere.
I gotta get away, get away from here...
(Go!) Maybe someday I'll find a way!

Well, if I hold out my hand, will you take it from me?
If I open my heart, will you help me to see... (help me to see) again?
I lost my heart and soul so many years ago, Oh Yeah! 
I've been runnin' after hope and livin' on a prayer.
The sign in the road says we're going nowhere. (Oh Yeah!)
I gotta get away, get away from here...

Maybe someday (I'll find what I'm lookin' for!)
Maybe someday (I'll find a better way!)
Someday!
Maybe baby! (We'll find a way outta here!)
Someday... Someway...
The sign in the road says we're going nowhere, Oh Yeah!
Someday... Someway...
Maybe someday we'll find a way!
Someday... Someway... Someday...
Someday we'll find a way, Yeah!
Yeah!
Maybe someday, Oh Yeah!
The sign in the road says we're going nowhere, Oh Yeah!
We're going nowhere, we're going nowhere, Oh Yeah!
