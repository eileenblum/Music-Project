Allright. 
This right here is going out to all you outcasts, outsiders and outlaws out there tonight.
It's going out to everybody that's ever been locked out or held down or kicked around.
It's going out to all the white trash out there. All the wasted youth. 
Everybody that ever felt like they never had a chance.
The world we live in is going straight to hell. The fellows i know, there's no way to turn.
We're all living in exile.

I'm in exile
I been livin' in exile
I'm in exile
I been livin' in exile

I been hangin' on the corner, starin' at the night sky,
and watchin' the cars drive by.
Their faces stare but they don't see me 
as I think about the past and I wonder why.(I wonder why!).
A side of life they'll never see has passed before my jaded eyes(my eyes!)
I'm on the outside lookin' in
I hold the burning tears inside my heart
I been runnin', I been runnin' with the hunted, I been runnin' for my whole life
I'm in exile
And I got nothin' but a hope inside, in my heart where hope has died
I been livin' in exile
Tears and pain like a stinging rain, have passed before my eyes
I'm in exile
I been runnin', I been runnin' with the hunted, I been runnin' for my whole life
I been livin' in exile
Forsaken!
Forgotten!
If you haven't been there then you'll never understand
I've stolen, I've lied, I've traded my pride,
'cause I never had a helping hand
They'll steal your innocence and they'll take away your soul
I've stolen, I've lied and there were times when there wasn't anyplace to go
So let's go!
I been runnin', I been runnin' with the hunted,
I been runnin' for my whole life
I'm in exile
And I got nothin' but a hope inside,
in my heart where hope has died
I been livin' in exile
Tears and pain like a stinging rain,
have passed before my eyes
I'm in exile
I been runnin', I been runnin' with the hunted, I been runnin' for my whole life
I been livin' in exile
How many tears have our mothers cried?(In exile)
How many of my kind have died?(in exile)
So I stand here to spit in your eye
and tell you your society is nothing but lies
They lock us up and hold us down,
just another wasted youth, another dead end town
I been waiting so long
I been waiting so long
I been waiting and now my hope is gone
There's gotta be something more than this
There's gotta be something that I missed
I'm in exile
I'm in exile
I'm in exile(There's gotta be something more than this)
I'm in exile
I'm in exile
I'm in exile
I'm in exile
I'm in exile(There's gotta be something more than this)
I'm in exile
I'm in exile
I'm in exile
I'm in exile(There's gotta be something more than this)
I'm in exile
I'm in exile
Yeah! i've been living in exile
I been runnin', I been runnin' with the hunted, I been runnin' for my whole life
I'm in exile
And I got nothin' but a hope inside, in my heart where hope has died
I been livin' in exile
Tears and pain like a stinging rain, have passed before my eyes
I'm in exile
I been runnin', I been runnin' with the hunted, I been runnin' for my whole life
I been livin' in exile
How many tears have they torn from my eyes?(exile)
How many times will we be denied?(exile)
They lock us up and they hold us down,
just another wasted youth, another dead end town
I been waiting so long
I been waiting so long
I been waiting now my hope is... gone
