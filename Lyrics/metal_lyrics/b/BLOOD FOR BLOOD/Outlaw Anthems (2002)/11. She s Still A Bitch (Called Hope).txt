All my life I relied on one thing and that one thing fucked me up even more
She is tempting and promises things that'll never happen of that I'm sure
Years I've wasted waiting for her to come through for me why was I so blind
Waiting innocently as time went on life's gotten worse my resentment's strong
Now I've smartened up I'm turning my back
I don't need her I gave her a smack
She failed me over and over again no surprise there she was never a friend
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her rope (a bitch called hope)
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her fucking rope
I'd have given her my heart and my dreams
She then strung me along threw away these years
Don't let that bitch take you for a ride like she took me
and took most everyone I know
So I've kicked the bitch to the curb
but in the end she's left me a bitter twisted motherfucker
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her rope (a bitch called hope)
I've been dragging a bitch called hope (a bitch called hope)
I've been hanging at the end of her fucking rope
