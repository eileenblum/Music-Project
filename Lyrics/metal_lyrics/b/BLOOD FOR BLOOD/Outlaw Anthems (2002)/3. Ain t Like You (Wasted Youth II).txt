I AIN'T LIKE YOU!

And I don't want your love.
And I don't need your respect.
I just can't hate enough but I got no tears or regrets.

I ain't like you
I will never live like you and you will never walk the path I do.
I will never be like you and I'll never be a part of your society of lies and fools.
I will never live like you.
I will never walk the path you do.
I am your wasted youth so...
Fuck you and society too 'cause my kind just ain't like you.

Yeah, I'm a King of Nothing,
'cause nothing's what I am and nowhere is where I'll be.
But I'd rather be a king of nothing than a servant in a sick society
'cause pretty little children playing pretty little games in their pretty little worlds is all I've ever seen.
You've never felt my pain
And I just gotta say to your face I ain't like you.

I will never live like you
And you will never walk my path so...
Fuck you and your society too.

Once again I'm a King of Nothing,
'cause nothing's what I am and nowhere is where I'll be.
I'm a nowhere man from Nowhere, U.S.A.
It's a dead end street near you.
They broke my heart, they stole my soul and why?
I'll never know.
I'm exiled from all of you so...
Fuck you and the whole world too 'cause I will never live like you.

If you don't like it... you can suck my dick.
