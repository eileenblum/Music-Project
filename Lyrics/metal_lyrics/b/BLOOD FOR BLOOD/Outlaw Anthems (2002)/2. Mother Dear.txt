Here I am
I am a monster but I was made
Here I stand
I am a beast that was born of pain
Bred to hate in this world gone insane
But now I'm here to stay
and I live to spit in your face.

'Cause I am from the outside
And I am everything that you despise.
Bred to hate in your society's eyes, it's a society of lies
And I live to spit in your face...

Mother dear,
Look at your darling young one.
Mother dear,
Look at what I have become.
Mother dear,
I am you bastard disgrace.
Mother dear,
I will spit in your face.
