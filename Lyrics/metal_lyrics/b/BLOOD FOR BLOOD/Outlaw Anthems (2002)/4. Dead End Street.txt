The sign in the road says we're going nowhere oh yeah.

oh no! let's go!

I been running down a dead end street.
I wanna rip through all the faces of the fools (I see).
And I know I'll never get away
'cause the gutter taught me early that there ain't no better days (for me).
I guess my childhood broke my heart. (it broke my heart!)
Down in the projects you learn pain from the start.
And there i learned, that's where I learned to hate the world,
Just another lost soul praying to the night sky alone...

Can someone, someone please tell me where I went wrong?
And how many more times will I have to sing this same old song?(sing this same old song!)
Can you tell me, tell me please, tell me where I went wrong?
And how many more times will I have to sing this same old sad, sad fucking song?

I done my time on the city streets. (city streets!)
Y'know that corner took a piece of me and my heart
And made me an enemy of the world.
Just another lost soul praying to the night sky alone.

I been running down this dead end street.
I wanna rip through all the faces I see.
I'm lost forever on this dead end street.
I'll leave this epitaph that no one will read...

Nowhere to turn. And nothing to lose.

So let's go!

Allright!

I been running down this dead end street.
I wanna rip through all the faces of the fools (I see).
I'm lost forever on this dead end street.
This is my epitaph that no one will read.

Can someone, someone please tell me where I went wrong?
Tell me where I went wrong
And how many more times will I have to sing this same old song?(sing this same old song!)
Can you tell me, tell me please, tell me where I went wrong?(where did I go wrong?!)
And how many more times will I have to sing this same old song?

The sign in the road says we're going nowhere oh yeah.
