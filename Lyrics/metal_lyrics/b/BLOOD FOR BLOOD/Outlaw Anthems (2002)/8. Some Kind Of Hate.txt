There's no way out.

I got some kind of hate,
I got some kind of hate,
I got some kind of hate and I hate the whole human race.

I got some kind of hate,
I got some kind of hate,
I got some kind of hate and I hate the mother fucking human race.

So let's go...

Y'know I got some bad ideas burning deep in my black heart.
Well, evil is as evil's gonna do now
Y'know I try to do my part. .. HA HA!
And I'm a time bomb tickin'... BOOM!
I been tickin' to the sounds of the rock and roll... OH NO!
I think I'm gonna explode... OH NO!
I THINK I'M GONNA EXPLODE!

You call me anti-social, well you're fucking right!
'Cause I hate this goddamned world and everything in sight
and every one in sight.
You call me anti-social, well you're fucking right!
'Cause I hate this mother fucking world and every mother fucker in sight!

I got some kind of hate for the human race.
I never found a place in the human race...
Maybe it's too late for the human race.
I never found a place in the human race...

Sometimes I wish I could just turn my back and run.
Just turn my back and run away.
Sometimes I feel like I just gotta gotta get a gun
and reach the top of the world my own way...
