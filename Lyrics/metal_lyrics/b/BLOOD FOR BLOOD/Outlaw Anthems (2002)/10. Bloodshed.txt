BLOOD FOR BLOOD DEFEATS!
Straight from the streets
If you ain't from there you'll never see
Watching everybody's move
Cause everyone's the enemy
I know that you don't think of me as a human being
But we don't really give a fuck
To us you mean nothing
Bloodshed on the streets
As blood for blood defeats
(Blood for blood defeats)
Bloodshed on the streets 
As the wasted youth defeats
(the wasted youth defeats)
Bloodshed on the streets
were the exile from the street
(You ain't from my street)
Bloodshed on the streets
Were the outcast of society

I don't need anyone
ahh yeahhh

We have cried so many tears
(so many tears)
Living without a fucking thing
And we'll never get the answers
So what have you left me
(you left me nothing)
But we are here and where here to stay
Cuz we are from the streets
And you can run awayyy yahhh

Bloodshed on the streets
As blood for blood defeats
(Blood for blood defeats)
Bloodshed on the streets 
As the wasted youth defeats
(the wasted youth defeats)
Bloodshed on the streets
were the exile from the street
(You ain't from my street)
Bloodshed on the streets
Were the outcast of society

Come on

Alright I'm gonna turn this over to the
wasted youth crew right here hit it gentlemen
Hey [x13]

BLOOD FOR BLOOD DEFEATS

Bloodshed on the streets
As blood for blood defeats
(Blood for blood defeats)
Bloodshed on the streets 
As Boston defeats
(You ain't from my street)
Bloodshed on the streets
As the bruisers rest in peace
(rest in peace fellas)
Bloodshed on the streets 
As the wasted youth defeats

Alright...

In your fucking face
That ones for you ricky rest in peace
Don't Fear Good Friends Brothers till the end

I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL MY PAIN
