Fucking your pussy was like fucking the wound from a shotgun blast... With gangrene!
Sorry ladies but this song goes out to all the guys out there
that have been fucked over by that lie known as love
Bottoms up.

Check this out!

Looking back at all the times we had, 
Wish I could tell ya' that they weren't all so bad.
But in the end we were just wasting our time,
Yeah I knew what you were but I was out of my mind.
Lost my mind

Knew you were common when we started this thing,
So very common with your everyday dreams.
But I was desperate for a heart of gold,
So I took a chance and I came in from the cold.
Life's so cold

Let me let you in on a secret fellas
if she sucks great cock she's a pro
and if she'll spread on the first date she's a hoe

I oughta' have my fucking head examined for screwing with a skank like you.
But it wasn't like I really fell for you, I was just cold and empty through and through

Fuck it.
Check this out!

Thought you were something but you proved me wrong.
Money is your only god, what a tired boring old song.
Just another coward out to sell your soul 
But it just goes to show that nothing in this world's forever.
And people are all the same.
And there's no such thing as love.
It left me choking like a candle in the cold hard rain.

But there's just one thing I never told ya. You numb fucking broad

You were so common, you were so cheap,
Another coke snortin' slut from the bar room scene.
But brother, I was so empty, I was so blind,
I turned my back on the truth before my very eyes.

'Cause sister, you could have been anybody.
You could have been anyone.
All I needed was anybody,
All I needed was anyone.

Alright check this out 
I was cold and empty and your body was warm

You could have been one of them fucking blow up dolls for all I fucking cared
Thanks for the fucking memories you fucking sow!
