This is a song for my whole town

Oh my sweet, sweet Jesus Christ
Another Saturday night
And I'm hangin once again
on my private little corner of hell
Little Mikey C. Just O.D'd
In the alley just a block away
Him and my little brother used to play
I watched the ambulance take him away
His mom's gonna take it hard
cause his dad just got locked away 
for 3 ta 5
For a deal he felt he had to make
for his family to survive

I know the world can be so cold
I know the world is so cold

(I been) Hangin' on the corner 
Hey hey hey !
I got nothing to do 
And I got nothing to lose
Hangin, hangin' on the corner
Wasting away.
Another wasted night
Another bottle of booze, Alright!


And I know that no one cares:
I can see it in your empty stares
when I tell you these tales of woe
I tell you these tales of woe
because we really care.

I know the world can be so cold
I know the world is so cold

Hangin' on the corner 
Hey hey hey !
I got nothing to do 
And I got nothing to lose
Hangin, hangin' on the corner
Wasting away.
Another wasted night
Another bottle of booze, Alright!

Down past Hayes Square
is where the wealthy dine
where they laugh and drink fine wine
Well, two blocks over
is where the Sergeant died
in a hall of fire ( here we go ! )
on a warm summer's night
All you forgotten in the projects
I hear Ya'.
All you numbers in the cell block:
We care.
All you sweatin' in the detox:
We care.
To all you hoods that are dodgin' cops:
We care.
And to all you bleeding
from a broken heart
You know you've got a brother here.

Hangin' on the corner 
Hey hey hey !
I got nothing to do 
And I got nothing to lose
Hangin, hangin' on the corner
Wasting away.
Another wasted night
Another bottle of booze, Alright!

Hangin' in the corner.
Hey hey hey !
I got nothing to lose and I got nothing
ro prove to you.
Hangin', hangin on the corner, wasting away.
I pray my luck will change one day.
Some day.
