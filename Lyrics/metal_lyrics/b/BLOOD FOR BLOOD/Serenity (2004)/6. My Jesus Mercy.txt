This is the story of a noble heart
that was broken
And pounded from the very start
You think you know violence?
You think you know pain?
Well think again, you little puke.
Cause even Job knew love and life
before he suffered:
my friend never did.
Once he was young and helpess:
help never came.
Well.. he'll never be helpless again.

Who's laughing now?
No one's laughing now?
And never again..
Cause now he's got a gun.
You mothers fuckers better run.
Cause now he's got a gun.

Yeah, there's no justice, there's just us:
he knew it from day one.
That there's no justice, there's just us
NO love and light but now he's got a gun

Who's laughing now?
No one's laughing now?
And never again..
Cause now he's got a gun.
You mothers fuckers better run.
Cause now he's got a gun.
You mothers fuckers better run.
You ain't laughing now.

(This next part of the song is derictly to
Steve, where ever he may be:)
Did you call my name and I didn't hear?
Did you call my name and I didn't care?
Did you call my our names and we didn't hear?
Did you call our names
and think we did not care?

Now he's gotta gun.
You mothers fuckers better run.
Now he's gotta gun.
You mothers fuckers better run.
Now he's gotta gun.
My jesus mercy.
