When it's time you know it's time,
when it's time to go.
I'm running out of time to save my soul.
I gotta save my soul.

Tick tock, goes the clock ( for so long. )
I been runnin' for so long
Tick tock goes the clock ( for so long ) 
I been running and I can't hold on.

I've seen enough, I've seen too much.
And I've done my best
to walk away in disgust
But what can you really do
on that bitter cold day
that you find that the truth horrifies?
But scream. Shout. Spit it all out.
And rage against the empty sky and 
anyone with an ear to hear.
That's what we've done for years
and all I need's a little more time.

Just gimme some time. ( All I need )
Just gimme some time
cause I can't hold on.

Tick tock, goes the clock ( for so long. )
I been runnin' and I can't hold on.
We've seen enough, we've seen too much
And I've done my best
Just gimme some time. ( All I need )
Just gimme some time
cause I can't hold on.

When it's time you know it's time,
when it's time to go.
I'm running out of time to save my soul.
I gotta save my soul.

Tick tock, goes the clock ( for so long. )
I been runnin' for so long
Tick tock goes the clock ( for so long ) 
I been running and I can't hold on.
All i need is time.

Just gimme some time
When it's time you know it's time,
when it's time to go.
I'm running out of time to save my soul.
I gotta save my soul.

I can't wait even one more day.
I feel my time slipping away.
