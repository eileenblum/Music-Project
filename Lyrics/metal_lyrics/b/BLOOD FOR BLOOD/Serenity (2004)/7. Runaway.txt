rock and roll
as i walk along i wonder,
what went wrong with our love,
a love that was so strong
and as i still walk, i think of what we done together, 
while our hearts were young
i'm walking in the rain, 
tears are falling and i feel the pain 
wishing you were here by me 
to end this misery
and i wonder, why why why why why why, why why why why why
she ran away and i wonder, were she will stay
my little runaway, run run run run runaway
let's go,

rock and roll

i'm walking in the rain, 
tears are falling and i feel the pain,
wishing you were here by me 
to end this misery
and i wonder, why why why why why why, why why why why why
she ran away and i wonder, were she will stay
my little runaway, run run run run runaway
when will she stay
