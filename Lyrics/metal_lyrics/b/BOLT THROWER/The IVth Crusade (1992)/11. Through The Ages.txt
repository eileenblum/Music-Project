World War I - 1914 to 1918
The so-called 'War of all Wars', the Great War

The war that should never have happened
The prime example of man's inhumanity
Concluding in the bombing of Japan

The war that America will never forget

More recently the Falklands War in 1982 and the Gulf War of 1991
Mankind's destructive nature - Throughout the ages
