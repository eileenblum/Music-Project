Intimidation you can't take much more,
No compromise - this time its war.
Take none alive - their battle cry roars,
Nowhere to hide - this time its war.
Face the fear that grips your mind,
The final conflict - the end of mankind.
Read the hatred deep within their eyes,
It's your time to die you now realise.
What has occurred to man,
Just isn't how you planned,
Enslaved by machinery,
Submit to technology.
Our future lives - Mankind's entity,
Lies in our hands - Together we must
face reality,
A ruined world of lost identity,
Technological supremacy.
