Turn around and shield your eyes,
Don't look back as the earth dies
No tomorrow for eternity'
The apocalyptic prophecy'
Few shall survive the final war'
Our futile lives shall be no more.
Innocent victims of the nuclear glare,
Are torn apart as they stand unaware.
The whole world is radioactive,
What's left of men now unproductive,
None shall escape the fall-out rain,
Our future life shall be steeped in pain.
Feel the chill of the nuclear winds,
Our planets downfall shall now begin.
No excuse for the vast destruction,
Caused by man with no
comprehension.
Life expectancy now decreases,
As atomic warfare rapidly increases,
Our foolish games, what have we
learnt?
No time for sorrow as the world burns.
