Storm calm neon skies
Still chilling winds roam the nuclear wastes
Haunting the conscience of a forgotten existence
Civilisation's mistake

Peace at last takes its grip on the land
For a moment time stands still
Existing of debris of bygone wars
Hope breeds an incentive not to kill

Existence declines, extinction mankind
A lifetime of time slips away

Resurrect mankind sacrificed to power
From ruins to the birth of a new reality
Rising from the ashes of past destruction
Civilisations, new existence

Lost in a void without future or past
Shattered mind in the presence of pain
Domineering desolation
Controlling the solarity plains

Existence declines, extinction mankind
A lifetime of time slips away

Darkest fears dwell in man's mind
Insight to depths of what will be
Reclamation from the grasp of destruction
From ruins to the birth of a new reality

Construction from destruction
Bringing back life to mankind
Rebuilding an existence sacrifices for power
A future with hope to find

Existence declines, extinction mankind
A lifetime of time slips away

Existence - Declines
Extinction - Of mankind
Lifetime - Of time
Now slips - Away
