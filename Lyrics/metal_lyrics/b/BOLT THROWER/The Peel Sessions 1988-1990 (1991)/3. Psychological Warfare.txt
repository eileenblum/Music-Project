Psychological Warfare
Still bear the scars from a past war ceased
Neurological nightmare
Torture suffered holds the mind from peace

Can't face reality unrestrained mentality
Hiding from the darkness of your insanity
Driven to soul despairs
Madness in your mind tears
No escape from this mental insanity

Captive life, held in past
Deranged memories still burning in your brain
Thoughts of pain, darkest dreams
Self inflicted torture, eating at your mind
Punishment, no pain release
Captive to the darkness of this psychotic insanity

Tearing in deep mind
Madness dwells with pain
Destruction of your life
Renders you insane
