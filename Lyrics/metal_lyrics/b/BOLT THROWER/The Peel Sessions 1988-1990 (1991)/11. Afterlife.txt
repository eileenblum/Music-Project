Afterlife

As you feel your soul depart from this world
Prepare for a journey to regions of the unknown

Your life has now ended
You fear the conclusion
Cast into the dark realms
Destined to the afterlife

As terror grips your soul
Direction is uncertain
Fear clouds your mind
Ignorance your burden

Afterlife

Within the dominion of the lifeless, you plead to die in peace
Now despair for total forgiveness, imprisoned in this land

All is silent
Held within
Existing forever
New life begins
Eternal desolation
Your soul to give

Enslaved for all existence - Perpetual endless torment
Reality is now dormant - Within the afterlife

Afterlife
