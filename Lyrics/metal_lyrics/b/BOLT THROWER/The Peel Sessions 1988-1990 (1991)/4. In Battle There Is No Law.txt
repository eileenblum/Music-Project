In the fight for existence and life
There is no law
And in the presence of eternal death
There is no law
And just the struggle for power the domination prevails
An arising slaughter
In revenging, every man for himself
As in battle there is no law

Countless numbers die in war's path
Armies falling to our wrath
Warriors of power marching to fight
Destruction, killing, all that's in sight

Raise the shield or be cast in to death
Take a final, look your final breath
Innocent victims of war
No turning back, in battle there is no law

Awaiting the slaughter, time stands still
Thoughts fade away, so does your will
Enemy close in, blood on their mind
You won't die, once die a thousand times

Raise the shield or be cast in to death
Take a final look your final breath
Innocent victims of war
No turning back, in battle there is no law

Soldiers of hatred, killing corps of war
Bodies litter the field, what was it for?
Stench of death, no victory for this night
Plead for mercy, you have no right

Raise the shield or be cast in to death
Take a final, look your final breath
Innocent victims of war
No turning back, in battle there is no law

No law
No Law
