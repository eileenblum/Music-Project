Enter the realm of chaos, your nightmare has just begun
You may wake up screaming, but there's no place left to run

The ancient prophecy of dominant supremacy
Find strength through your salvation, the need for domination

Past life you deplore, present life you abhor
Future life is so unreal, intense despair now feel

Mutated creature round you stare, at your limbs they all tear
It's too late now to say a prayer, for your gods have no care

Welcome incursions of chaos, you know you cannot resist
To serve, worship, obey them the only way to exist

Your foretold destiny of perpetual lunacy
The final requisition, is no longer your decision

The obscure depravity blinds you, now you cannot see
What they've made of your world as your blood is turning cold

Now it's time to pay your price - The ultimate sacrifice
Gasp at your final breath - Cleansed now in your death, your
death
