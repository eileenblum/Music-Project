Into your minds now, waiting to unleash
Words of their law, they have come to teach
Growing in strength, draining power from life
The ultimate forces, masters of the seven nights rise

Captives of the timeless wastes
Imprisoned for no crimes
Held by the force of desolation
Damnation for all time

From fallen masses, arisen life
Survivors start to rise
Survival instinct gathered strength
Quest for power burns inside

Excessive violence, fight for control
Aggressive vengeance taking control
Of the power you hold

Deep in your minds now, power out of reach
Hate is their law, vengeance now you seek
Diminished strength, fighting for your life
With subdued forces, servants of hatred now rise

Overthrow intentions growing
Authority of command
Vengeance breeding, justice seekers
Of the barren lands
