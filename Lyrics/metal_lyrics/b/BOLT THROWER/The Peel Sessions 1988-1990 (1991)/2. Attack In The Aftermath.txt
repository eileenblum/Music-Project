All is lost, survival is all that remains
Dying at will, there is no pain
Memories of hate run deep in my mind
Body's numb, no feeling towards mankind

Ruins fall, the warzone lies in decay
Wounded crawl, dying, lying they pray
Fallen dead row on row line the path
Streams of blood run thick in the aftermath

Fighting for life
Defending yourself from the night
The strong shall survive
Weak shall fall to their plight
Fight to the death or surrender to their wrath
Attacking in might, attack in the aftermath
