Driven now by fetid winds, we came to this place of despair
Fresh visions of death filled my mind with disgust
Yet still we stood here and stared

A world steeped in torment
Where agony prevails
With cruel sadistic torture
All hope of life now fades

The time has come, you have no choice, now you face your death
Choke at your last breath

Your mind now screams
Could it be you're insane
To live your life
Within the lost souls domain

Lost souls domain

Plead for mercy
To your gods now pray
For in this place
You now shall stay
No way out
Trapped within
This reign of terror
Shall now begin

Shall now begin

City of the damned - Hear the screams cry out
The agony within - Untold without a doubt

Feel your life - Slipping through your hands
A new reality - Held now by this land
