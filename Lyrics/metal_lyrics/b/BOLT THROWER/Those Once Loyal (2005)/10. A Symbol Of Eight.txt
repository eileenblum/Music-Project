Entering - the dawn of a new era
Confused perspectives - there is nothing left to fear
All objectives - now rearranged
No principles - to enslave

Within the eye of chaos waits
Deep in your soul
Awakened
Symbol of eight

From the ruins - past life of delusion
Out of darkness - destroy all false illusion
New reality - discovered with time
The death of history - under this sign

Within the eye of chaos waits
Deep in your soul
Arising
Symbol of eight

Drowning
In a vast sea of contempt
There is almost nothing left
Of the world you once used to know
From the chaos, new strength to grow...
...New strength will grow

No gods
No king
With no country
In chaos ascending
Symbol of eight
