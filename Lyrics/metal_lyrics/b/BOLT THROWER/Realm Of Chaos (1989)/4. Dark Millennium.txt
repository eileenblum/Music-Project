You feel confusion and new torment as your mind decays
Devolution of your life - begins today - begins today

Hear the sircas scream in vain
Despair for your life
Hope is futile as missiles strike
A cruel twist of the knife

Those that dominate, direct their hate
Life obliterate, humans terminate

Hope for a future, is what you say
With your world in ruins, what a price to pay

As you crawl through the wreckage - you can't believe
Could mankind really be so naive
This world now twisted, brought to its knees
With the people in power left to oversee

A world totally deformed, no hope of being reborn
The heart from it now torn, this world now we all mourn

Look to the future, on your knees now pray
With this world in ruins, what a price to pay

Your world's now in ruins
What a price you paid
