Contamination - spreads throughout the world
Contagious evil - now that chaos takes its hold

Sadistic torture - warps your earthly form
Your blood now curdles - now to be reborn

You scream in pain - yet no-one hears a sound
Plead for redemption - now by chaos you are bound
By chaos you are bound

Infectious disease
Feel your body rot
Your final lament
Will soon be forgot

Slow painful death
Dementing your brain
The tribulation
Driving you insane
