Cenotaph

Alone you stand - The final parody
Destined to silence - A memorial to mortality

Carved in stone - A tribute to the dead
For nameless victims - Whose litany is unread

Never forgotten - Wars memory lingers on
A dark reminder - To mankind's oblivion

This solemn image - Constructed with resolution
A monument - To wars terminal conclusion

Cenotaph
