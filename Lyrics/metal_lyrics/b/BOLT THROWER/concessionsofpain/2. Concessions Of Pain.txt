No justice found
Beneath the blackened clouds of war
Attack in the darkness
No peace before the dawn

Killer instinct, sadistic tendency
Aggression breeding hatred, kill all enemies
Powersurge eliminates remorse for mankind
Hopelessness, domination freezes in the mind

Dormant hatre lies in state
Hands of death await your fate
Concession of pain, taste for power
Life awaits its final hour

Locked in conscience, strange mess of thoughts
Privilege of pain, gained the power sought

Mass enforcement, total control
Captives of command, fallen to our hold
Dark torment of the fear inside
Domination takes away your pride

Dormant hatred lies in state
Hands of death await your fate
Concession of pain, taste for power
Life awaits its final hour

No justice found
Beneath the blackened clouds of war
Attack in the darkness
No peace before the dawn
