Final challenge laid down
Decision on victory is death
Ultimate forces rise
Building weapons of strength

Wheels of war again roll
Strategic tactics are planned
Military minds take control
Ownership of the domain

Taste to conquer grows strong
Ruler of all that remains
Agony for conquest prolongs

Call for the power to rise
Battle of strength within strives
Total authority demands
Ruling territorial lands

Fighting for total command this night
Successor to take up control
Aggression overthrows fear
Your downfall slowly unfolds

Burning quest for power
Possess minds as they fight
Domination and destruction
Reign in glory of might

Challenge for power ends
Battle cry for victory (sound) no more
Ultimate forces have grown
Rising from the slaughter of war

Rulers of the seven nights rise
The future of mankind unfolds
Hail the dawning of a new age
The master race shall now take control
