Fallen are the people of the decaying race
Now proclaim the legacy inherited too late
Too late

Mankind - The dying creed, reared on ignorance and greed
On suffering we feed devouring all beyond our needs

A path of self-destruction they cannot see
Regarding their only interest in profitability
They cannot see

Open up your mind before it's too late
Unlock the chains of confinement that we create
Grasping all you can - Overloaded capacity
Nothing can conceal instinctive rapacity

A movement to disaster could this be the final plan
Blinded by our avarice the closing chapter
Extinction of man

Mankind - The dying creed, reared on ignorance and greed
On suffering we feed devouring all beyond our needs
