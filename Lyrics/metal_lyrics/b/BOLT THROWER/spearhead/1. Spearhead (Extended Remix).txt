Spearheads

Spearhead - Pierces through you
Fear numbs my mind, persecutes you

Spearhead - Marching onwards
Take my soul, sacrificial offering

Your initial strike taken by surprise
Now left alone, condemned by my pride
Drained of all emotion - Body now an empty shell
There's nothing left - You've taken all away

Adrenaline flows
Now filled with anger
Just what will be the outcome
Mass confusion tears my mind

Spearhead - No victory sublime
Another fallen victim - I will not beg to you
Spearhead - To which I cannot hold
With clear perceptions my destiny unfolds

I look to the reflection, fail to recognise what's seen
A figure clothed in hatred, I pray that this cannot be
Faced by this total stranger - Aware of your creation
No vision of your former self - Controlled by your instructi-
ons

Onward you advance, left in a mindless trance
Hypnotised by your will, desire is now instilled
Now staring face to face, your eyes filled with hate
Held by your contempt, both by weakness and by strength

Adrenaline flows
Now filled with anger
Just what will be the outcome
Mass confusion tears my mind

My mind

Tears my mind

Spearhead
