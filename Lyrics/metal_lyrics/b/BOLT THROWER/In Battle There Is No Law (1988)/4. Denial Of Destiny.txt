Denial of your destiny
Your future - Your fate - I control
Denounce your past existence
Your life means nothing to you now

Enslaved by the power of fear
The torture - The pain - I unleash
Suffering at the hands of command
Mercy for you is out of reach

Brainwashed, past lost
Now taught only to obey
Mind scan, thought ban
All that exists is all that I say

The future you see
Is my enforced reality
Command me obey
Your mind now belongs to me

The executioner of all recollection
To eliminate the memories you hold
