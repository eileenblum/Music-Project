Led to the slaughter, your life in their hands
Destroying maiming at will
Spread all around, deep in the group
Trenches for corpses to fill

Advance to attack - Forward to death no retreat
Onward they charge - Running blind to defeat

Battlefield graveyard bodies pile high
Laid to rest where they fall
Merciless war which they had fought
They showed no mercy at all

Advance to attack - Forward to death no retreat
Onward they charge - Running blind to defeat

Another assault - Counter attack
Half the battalions gone
Numbers decreased masses deceased
The mindless killing goes on

Advance to attack - Forward to death no retreat
Onward they charge - Running blind to defeat
