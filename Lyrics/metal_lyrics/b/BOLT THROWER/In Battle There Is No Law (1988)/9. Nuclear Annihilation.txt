Holocaust, nuclear Annihilation
Final blow, life eradication
Night turns to day, a blinding flash
Total deafness from the blast

No warning, no time
Split second, no chance of escape
Confusion of mind
Panic sets in, uncontrollable state

Crimson clouds melt the skies
Acid rain, slaying storm
Massacre lifeforms destruction born

Radioactivity
Total possession of the atmosphere
Oxygen capacity
Extiction is drawing near

Hide from the air nobody breathes
Eyes see pain, body bleeds
Poisonous gas, chokes your breath
Active fallout, burning flesh

Asphyxiation
Gasping for air, suffering you lay
Slow suffocation
Torment as time slips away

Survival craves in the minds that live
Hunger to take, no more to give
Living dead, parasites feed
Contaminations, mutations breed

Disease takes it's toll
Wiping out thousands each day
Infection controls
Pray for death as the living decay

Toxic chemicals, pollution stays
Terminal madnss seeks it's prey
Life takes life, mass genocide
Desolate void opens wide

Mass suicides
Ending it all tho ease the pain
Fear rots inside
Suffering now drives you insane
