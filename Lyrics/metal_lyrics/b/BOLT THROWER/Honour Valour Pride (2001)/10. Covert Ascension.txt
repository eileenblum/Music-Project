[Bonus track]

With all darkest manoeuvres
Now concealed
Technology asunder
Re-engineered

Total immersion in subterfuge
Propagated lies denial of truths
The unseen image a silent recollection
Subversive tactics covered with deception

Reticent war machine
Hidden operation
Pwoling evasively
In latent devastation

All missions silenced
Under the black banner
Repetitious action
Spectral their agenda

Indoctrination
Deemed classified
Holes within the net
The need to know intensifies

Massive restrictions
Reflective all sectors
Outside the radar
Parameter secure

Inherently to rend - A world of hurt to end
Knowledge will defend - Covertly now ascend

Unsteadfast beliefs
Assassinated state
Conflict rapacity
Aurora - Aurora of hate

Dave Ingram - vocals
Jo Bench - Bass
Gavin Ward - Guitar
Barry Thomson - Guitar
Martin Kearns - Drums
