Shadows amongst the cloudburst
Maelstorm returns
A darkened shroud begins descent
Wasted man secured
As pulses fade
Seventh offensive laid down
Project D.O.4
Heroes made dishonoured ground

Artillery now silent
Fires forever silent
Chlorine burnt the throat
Of all blood agent kills
Gradients of syndrome
Clouds of war enraged
The day is lost, the night has won
All ends at point blank range

Maximum casualties
The pointless slaughter
Wiped out generations
Man, en masse destroyer

Final road to glory
Surrendered life eternally
No survivors
Now proclaim the call for victory
