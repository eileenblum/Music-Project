Ground assault begins
By order open fire
Vanguard - respect is borne
Proud to hold first battle front none superior
... None superior

Axis ever turning (advance as one)
Warâs attrition has begun
Intense the battle harvest
Through the crimson mud
Now thoughts turn and decline
Unswerving loyalty advance is one
Advance is one

Weary from the start - at dawn's early light
Silently torn away - unto the end of life

As night has fallen
Far distant horizons afire
Beyond pursuit of victory
In belligerence and pride
A war to end wars
With loyalty above all - except honour
Loyalty above all
