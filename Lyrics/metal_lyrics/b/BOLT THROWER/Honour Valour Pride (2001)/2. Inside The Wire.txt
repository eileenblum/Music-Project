Outer defences neutralized
Lessons in munitions are reprised
Kancet never hammer
Caution must prevail
Concealment deep inside the wire
Where instincts never fail

Through fortified lines
Last phase intercept
Based in destruction
Silently shreds

Exist longer under threat
Engaging to replay the debt
Damage to infliction
Patterns lie half formed
Assaults never retracted
In the hope to halt the war

Laying waste, subversion
Rendering in chaos with dead ammunition

Undermine defences - facilitate
Saboteurs inside the wire - interpenetrate
Inner defenses - eradicate
Inside the wire - too late... too late
