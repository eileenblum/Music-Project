Action this day
Ordnance at full release
Frontiers crossed and violated
Remote the chance for peace
Acts of valour
Fortify advocate
Engage a strange alliance
Embittered against hate

Second battle drawing near
March again on darkened moors
Defiant without fear
Belief a mortal cause

Paradoxic triumph
Foretold cost too high
Here gods teach man nothing
Uncensured life decry
Legions robbed of faith
Senses fractured in despair
Main force of hardened souls
Retro-active in nightmares

Lifeless splinters of man
Counterparts as one

Splinters of man
Counterparts as one
Now in times of peace
Rain falls on lonely graves

Now in times of peace
Rain falls on lonely graves

Vast stone assemblies
Symbolic sacrifice
Known only unto your god
Hold anguish over life
