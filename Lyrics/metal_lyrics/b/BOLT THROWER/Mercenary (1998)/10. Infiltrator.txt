Strike first strike
Accurate speed
Strength of surprise
Covert need
One mad minute
Nothing left alive
Furtive action
Far from allies

Taste cold steel
Fast and quiet
Face the fear
Within the eyes
Unsurpassed
Chosen elite
Transformation
From defeat

Stealth - The myth endures
Secret - Disciples of war
...Disciples of war

Sealed your fate
Condemned by hate
...Infiltrate

Now discovered
Far too late
Mind displaced
... Infiltrate

Thanks to Gavin Spearhead for sending track #10 lyrics
