Technology - Now controls
Powersystems - Overload
In the matrix - Once your mind
Lies the sorrow - None survive

Globalised - Authority
World enmeshed - Hyper reality
Brain connected - Consume priority
End millennium - Mass anxiety

Time compessed - Rapidity
Space is stretched - New totality

Pulse still beats - Deep inside
Accept the chaos - Embrace new life
One mans valour - Anothers sin
One chapter closes - Another begins

A final tribute
Overshadowed by stone
At the end
Alone
