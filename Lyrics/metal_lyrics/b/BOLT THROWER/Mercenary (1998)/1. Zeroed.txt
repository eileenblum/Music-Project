Singled out - Vision becoming clear
Now in focus - Judgement draws ever near
At the point - Within the sight
Pull the trigger - One taken life

Vindicated - Far beyond all crime
Instigated - Religions so sublime
All the hatred - Nothing divine
Reduced to zero - The sum of mankind

Untold suffering
Of forgotten wars
One more statistic
The world ignores
Another victim
Within sight
With no profit
One more taken life

No truth - No justice
All false belief
Blinded by mortality
There shall be... no peace
No peace
