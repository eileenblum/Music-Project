Behind the lines
Concealed
Deconstructed truth
Revealed
Clear from all known danger
Hostility deplored
Ignorance the principal
Unknown wars

Now beneath
Electrical skies
Artilleries
Uneartly cry
Devastating power
Cynically imposed
Futile resistance
Savagely dispose

No expectations
Courage of despair
Annihilated wisdom
Belligerence declared

It's all illusion
Life's tragedy
No comprehension
Beyond infinity
