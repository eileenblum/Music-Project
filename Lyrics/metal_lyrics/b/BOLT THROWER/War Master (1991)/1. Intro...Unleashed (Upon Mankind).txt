You watch in terror, in fear of your life
Their execration revealed, only your death will suffice
You cannot conceal, this reality from your mind
As unknown powers, are unleashed upon mankind

Unleashed upon mankind

Running - in search of safety
No escape - from [the] deadly wrath
Screaming - you beg for mercy
Silenced - by the searing blast

You are forced to believe, this is for real
Mind frozen with horror, as your body trembles in fear
No prayers for deliverance, your gods you now forsake
Summon courage from within, face your unperceived fate

Unleashed upon mankind

Awaiting - with expectation
Impending - life's annihilation
Annihilation [sings something else here]
Mass genocide - the resolution
Now verified - out termination

Now the stench of death, abides throughout the world
As infesting plagues, cause agonies untold

Unleashed upon mankind

You are the final victim, no one else has survived
Alone you now suffer, eagerly waiting to die

The ending draws nearer, our extinction is justly deserved
Through thoughtless intentions, this holocaust incurred
The closing chapter finished, now face the torment and pain
Through death it becomes clearer, mankind alone is to blame

Unleashed upon mankind [doesn't sing this]
