War to end all wars
Hatred lost control
Casualties now mounting
Tales yet still untold
Life's eradication
Of man now beyond all reason
Totally insane
The human race becomes

[chorus]

Lest we forget - thoughts will always haunt the mind
Lest we forget - the bitterness remains

Vast termination
Man made rationality
Complete elimination
Of life beyond brutality
Eternal resentment
Re-occurs time after time
Driven to despair
Extinction drawing near

[(chors) x 2]

Commence removal of all things valued in life
The persecution what was once believd right
Humanities objective now totally deranged
When ignorance transpires, this world becomes insane.
