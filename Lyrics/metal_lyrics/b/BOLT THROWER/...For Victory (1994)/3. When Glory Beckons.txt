When glory beckons
With no regrets
On this day of sorrow
The course now set
End of life converges
A sweet release
Away from turmoil
To find peace

Death now approaching
Where is victory?
At one with the earth
For all eternity
Pride now forgotten
Fighting for life
Strenght decreasing
Twisting the knife

Now to leave - departure of the soul
With relief - eternity unfolds

Do not be sad - the pulse now gone
The war of life continous - this battle now is won

Mourn no more - reaching eternal rest
Remember with no sadness - the final request

Now to leave - departure of the soul
With relief - eternity unfolds
