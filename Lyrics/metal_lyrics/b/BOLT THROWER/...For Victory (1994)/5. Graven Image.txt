Words cannot explain
Darkest thoughts within the mind
Centuries of hatred
Now subside
Commencing the birth
Of new life
Rise from the wreckage of the past

Words cannot explain
The feeling agony within
Anguish summoned
Perception begins
All secrets now revealed
You cannot win
Searching in hope of a new age

All feelings put aside
Numbed by the vision
Nothing left alive
Facing devastation

Awakened in remorse
To rebuild from destruction
Recreate life's evolution

No chance for redemption
All life now ceased
Pleading for forgiveness
There shall be no peace
