As daylight returns
The fires of hope still burn
Crawl through darkened light
Sickened by the mournful sight
Tears fall from eyes
Not sure what has been done
Sorrow creeps throughout my soul
All is lost, none have won

The battle smoke remains
Begin to feel the pain
Alone now stagger on
Unsure how it begun
Through time war previals
Thoughts fears cast aside
Face the consequence alone
With honour - valour - pride

As fire fills the sky
We once believed in life
Now time to die
...For Victory

Now in deaths glory
Mans final destiny
The final price to pay
...For Victory

"They shall not grow old
As we that are left grow old
Age shall not weary them
Nor the years condem.
At the going down of the sun
And in the morning
We will remember them."
"We will remember them"
