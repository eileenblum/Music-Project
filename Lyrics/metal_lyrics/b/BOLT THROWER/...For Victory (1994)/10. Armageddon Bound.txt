On the edge - spirit begins to break
Chances unsure - not much more you can take
Weakness grows - nerves start to crack
Far from safe - there is no turning back

A fine line - between victory and defeat
At the midpoint - uncertainty complete
Confusion prevails - unsure which way to move
Holding no hope - there is nothing more
nothing more to prove

Trying to discover what is right
And what is wrong
Judged by false criteria
Ideals strong
Misfortune predictable
Lessons learnt before
Decisions now justified
Perpetuate this war

This battlefield wide open
No territory gained
Within this wasteland
Humanity constrained

Here in no mans land
No mercy can be found
Delirious perspective
Armageddond bound.
