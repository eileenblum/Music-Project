A time for peace, a time for war
Time moving onwards forever more
A time to live, a time to die
The prophecy now denied... denied

Life blood flows cold
Contempt overruns the soul
Burning deep inside
The litany abide

Embrace the terror
No place to hide
Face the final judgement
Compassion now slowly dies

Stripped of all sanity
Installed a new reality
Overlord supremacy
Vengeance now implied

Embrace the terror
No place to hide
Face the final judgement
Compassion now slowly dies

Now free from strain
Existence drains away
Fallen as the rain
To the last with life pain

Now slipped through veins
Can't comprehend such feeling
Now stretched beyond capacity
Vengeance shall be mine
