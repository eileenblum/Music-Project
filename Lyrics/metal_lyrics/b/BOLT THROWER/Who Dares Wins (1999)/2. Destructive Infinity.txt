You never thought life could come to this
Man reborn to die upon the altar of war

And now we stand, to face the truth
This world now enslaved, bound by hate

In fear of life now that the mindless control
As the flame of hope for mankind now burns away

For now you stand alone to die
Whilst visions of horror infest your mind

Destructive - Man's lust for power
Infinity - A lifetime of war

Destroying your world, again and again
Suffering in torment, through agonizing pain

Killing for pleasure, only the strong shall remain
An arising slaughter, as hatred and terror now reigns

Now reigns

Destructive - The world ripped apart
Infinity - A never ending fear
