The time has come to leave this place - Never to return
Nothing's left but ashes - My body now is spurned
Your sorrow will subside in time - My one, true, only friend
There is one thing we can do - To avert this bitter end

Up amongst the stars I dwell - Tranquillity is found
I look upon the earth - To which all human life is bound
Alone I wander aimlessly - For now my spirit's free
My soul exists within you as I guide your destiny

The tears of grief you weep for me - Through uncontrolled emotion
You have given me your all - A life time of devotion
So come my friend take my hand - Together we shall see
The pathways through the darkness - For all eternity

Eternity
