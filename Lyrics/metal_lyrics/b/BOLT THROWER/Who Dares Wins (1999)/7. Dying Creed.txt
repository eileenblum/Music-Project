Falling are the people of a decaying race,
Now proclaim the legacy inherited too late - too late,
Mankind - The dying creed, Reared on ignorance an greed,
On suffering we feed devouring all beyond our needs.
A path of self destruction they cannot see,
Regarding their only interest in profitability - They cannot see,
Open up your mind before its too late,
Unlock the chains of confinement that we create.
Grasping all that you can-overloaded capacity,
Nothing can conceal instinctive rapacity.
A movement to disaster could this be the final plan,
Blinded by our avarice, the closing chapter, extinction of man.
Mankind - The dying creed, Reared on ignorance an greed,
On suffering we feed devouring all beyond our needs.
