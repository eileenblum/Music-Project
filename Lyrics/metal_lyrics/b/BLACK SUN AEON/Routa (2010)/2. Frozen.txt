In this cold, calm damnation
Six feet under below the ice
The hell stays still
The hell stays freezing

I don't bleed
Frozen blood doesn't flow
Death came for me this winter
Death, white as snow

I don't feel
Ice covered my soul
My breathe was taken
My skin turned cold

Since daylight died
In darkness lay the shadows of the sun
The only shine comes from the burning sky
Northern light, shed your fire

I don't bleed
Frozen blood doesn't flow
Death came for me this winter
Death, white as snow

I don't feel
Ice covered my soul
My breathe was taken
My skin turned cold

Into the dark
Where you can't see
But I breathe free
I want you to leave me

Into the dark
I want you to lead me
Winter light
You never saw me
