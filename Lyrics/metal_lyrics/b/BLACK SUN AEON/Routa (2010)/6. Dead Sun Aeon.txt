I hope the fallen snow will cover my tracks so you can't follow me.
I want the icy flow to freeze my blood to drown me in the flood.
I ask you to touch my skin so you could feel that there's no warmth in me.
A beating heart that is still burning ice broke my will. Please set me free.

Cold wind from the north, fierce and untamed knows my true name.
I am the daughter of the snow with winter in my heart and frozen so I depart.

Cold wind from the north, fierce and untamed knows my true name.
I am the son of the snow with winter in my heart and frozen so I depart.
