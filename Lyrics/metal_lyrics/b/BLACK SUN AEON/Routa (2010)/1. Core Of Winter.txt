On the dawn I'm lying here, a desolate obscene
Home is where your ruin is
The long series of failures,
My shallow life has been so tired of all this

All your warmth didn't fill this endless void of a heart
Its infinite emptiness
Longing within to vanish and depart
Into nothingness

I have come to bring the end
Dry and hopeless my descent
For I am the core of winter
The unforgiving darkness

Into the dark breathing cold
River runs frozen to my heart
Into the dark coming home
River sung frozen to my heart
