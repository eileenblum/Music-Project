By his wish people breath
For ???? or for valor
One least for another

You shall numb frozen core
By my skull now and forever more
Now and forever more

Surrounding silence
Tranquility around me
In the freezing world
No disarray and violence
Chaos and wrath
In the sleeping world

Lord is the cold liquid ship
Toleration post-unity
Honor of disease

And be war for all this world
Mother Earth rejoin the claw
For nuclear winter

Surrounding silence
Tranquility around me
In the freezing world
No disarray and violence
Chaos and wrath
In the sleeping world

The meaningless freezing shit
You goddamn motherfucker
United ???? they name parasite
Oh goddamn this is the strong of hate, hell and sin
And do I become man
I wonât be self-destruction power

No disarray and violence
Chaos and wrath
In the freezing world
Surrounding silence
Tranquility around me
In the sleeping world
