Cry out your desperation
Bleed out the blood
That turned black
The pain
That runs in your veins
The hurt
That takes you down
Into forever frozen ground...
When the ones with wings
Start to sing their sorrowsong
The notes will guide you
To the place where you belong
Cry out your desparation
Bleed out the blood
That turned black
The pain
That runs in your veins
The hurt that takes you down...
In oblivion
I fall but to be alone...
Is more than the solitude,
I embrace and belong
In solitude what
I've belong.
