Freezing string that purifies
But ???? like tears
With his power overwhelming
And who win his will

Beware the blade of frost
The winter will claim its sacrifice
The cold funeral awaits in the river of ice

Break on peace where no lie devilâs will
To found and end this
We should give that once in your face
Death knows your name

Beware the blade of frost
The winter will claim its sacrifice
The cold funeral awaits in the river of ice

Beware the blade of frost
The winter will claim its sacrifice
The cold funeral awaits in the river of ice
