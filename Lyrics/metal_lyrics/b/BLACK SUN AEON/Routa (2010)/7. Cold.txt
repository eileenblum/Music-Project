I can't remember
I can't recall
The last summer before the fall
The final winter that followed
When days turned cold
Marked the aeon of
The black sun

The everlasting flame
Expired
Dark it became
To mark that I was replaced

In my memories
I still see a glimpse of the sun
The blazing star
Remembrance from a far
Dying sun on fire

I won't surrender
Not going to crawl
Remind that I conquered all
Dark case of blizzards
That follow the years to come
Started the aeon of
The dead sun

The everlasting flame
Expired
Dark it became
To mark that I was replaced

In my memories
I still see a glimpse of the sun
The blazing star
Remembrance from a far
Dying sun on fire
