Depart, escape and break free
Withdraw, retreat and flee
Fool, deceive and mislead
Alter, rewrite your fate, rewrite your destiny

Rebuilt a whole new world
Improve and reform the whole universe

[Chorus:]
From these dreadful surroundings
Where fields of grief and despair
Grow tall
From these lifeless landscapes
Where the rain that falls is ashes of the scorched
Heaven above

Barren earth beneath me
A dead cold soil
Blacken terrain around me
Desolate and destroyed
Self-created void
A black hole within me

The ghost of this wasteland whisper
Words coal-black, in language of the dominion torn asunder
