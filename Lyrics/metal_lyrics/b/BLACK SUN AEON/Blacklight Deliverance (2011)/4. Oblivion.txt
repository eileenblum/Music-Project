My voice breaks the silence untouched
My words wars against the absence of the sound
My whispers echoes in these halls
My declaration painted blood red on these walls

[Chorus:]
Into the oblivion
In the world of light
I don't belong

Into the oblivion
In the world of light
I never saw the sun

In my desolation in my grief
In my god forsaken existence I feel
That damnation in form of a despair
Precedes the path of salvation
That I have foreseen
