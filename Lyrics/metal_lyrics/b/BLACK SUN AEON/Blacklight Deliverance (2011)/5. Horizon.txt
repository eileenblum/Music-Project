Black flame from the abyss
In vein was attempt to restrain its powers

Regain, restore and contain
The might of the fallen

Forces of legions inside
with strength I ablaze
So I can be reborn

Begin the last solar cycle
Arise and erase with power

Ignite the bleak horizon
Set the sky on fire

In fire
I was reborn and reawakened

Still Higher
Into the core of the sun

Wings of fire
I forged from the flames

I fly
Towards the blazing star
