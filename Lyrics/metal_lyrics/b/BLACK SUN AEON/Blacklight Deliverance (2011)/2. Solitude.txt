Downhearted daybreak
Pale morning light
Ill-natured and bright
Draws shadows unkind

Designs and shapes
A dreadful day
Crestfallen sunrise
Paints a grey landscape

[Chorus:]
Never before has my solitude felt like a cage
Regret as a friend
Misery as company in this deserted place

Find solace thru
The darkest relief
Redemption without
Faith or belief

Blackhearted awakening
Ill-fated and bright
Dawning in sight

From this solitary sense
Distressing state
From this misfortuned fate
I fear I can't escape
