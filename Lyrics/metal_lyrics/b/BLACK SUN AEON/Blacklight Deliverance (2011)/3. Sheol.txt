In the abyss of the netherworld
Realm of fiends, sheol reformed
Demon dominion
Kingdom of a fiery storm

Haven transformed into hades
Black flames high as the skies
Symphony of destruction was performed
As a final cradle song

The world disintegrated
The ruins of the earth
Reigned ages with dominance
And prevailed eons supreme

Failed in multitude a swarm of faults
Like a cancer we brought the 1st plague
River run red, river run deep,
Blood river will flood

[Chorus:]
Last flight of an angel
Above the world
Consumed and devoured by flames of the end

Silvery wings were discolored by ash
And feathers grew coal-black
Along with the sun she fell from the welkin
Into the earth burned by wrath

Backfire in quantities, determine defeat
In numbers beyond comprehension
Ravage and tear apart and sear
The shrine of the fallen god

Failed in multitude a swarm of faults
Like a cancer we brought the 1st plague
River run red, river run deep,
Blood river will flood
