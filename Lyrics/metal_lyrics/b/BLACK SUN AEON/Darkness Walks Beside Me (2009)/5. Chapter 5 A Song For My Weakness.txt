I embrace
The depths of oblivion
I am engaged to the escapeable end
The void that once was a strength
Consuming and fears
Became too intense
Destructive
I behold the days that are numbered
In my perdiction
The end has been forseen
I am unable to accept this failure
As weak as I am
I have no strength in me to pretend
The throne that once
Marked my strength
Is now a token of my failure
