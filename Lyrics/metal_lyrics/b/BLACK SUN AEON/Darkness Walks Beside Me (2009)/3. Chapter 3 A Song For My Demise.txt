I am counting hours
Waiting for the sun to set below horizon
Blinded by the light until the
Darkness will fall upon me
And I become as one
Last few restless hours
Until the daylight will reach its end
I am granted with great powers
But blinded by the light until the
The pyre of gods, black flame within me
Purgatory
The fire of wrath inside
I burn alive
