I have become to question my existence
The purpose of life
The essence of the creature I am
These days will be remembered
As the dark ones
When all life withered away
Death came with me side by side
Our trail across the land
Left only void behind
I have become more than my reflection
I have overcome the sickness
The weakness of my blood
I am the plaque, I am the flood
I have become more than a man
Weak flesh seals inside a god
