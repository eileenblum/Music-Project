I am the god, the chaos and destruction
Behold the powers of my wrath
I am the sword
The burning blade of vengeance
Your blood in my hands
As I embrace the black fire of the end
Ashes rain upon me when heaven is in flames
I am the bringer of your damnation
The judge and deliverance in one
If I say there shall be darkness
All light will die
I rule the world without a sun
With sorrow I behold the demise
The ruins of empyrium
With sorrow I behold, it was fortold
When angels fall, we have seen the last dawn
