[Bonus Track]Would you keep talking shit
About me and my friends?
All your fake smiles
To me are just an offense.

I don't see compromise
In your actions
I don't see any passion.

Take off your disguise
Integrity doesn't have a prize
I'll be there to see your demise.

Keep waiting 'til I fucking sink

I can see through your eyes
You're all falsity
You can say what you want
But no one even cares!
