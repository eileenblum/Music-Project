You will never understand
Why I live my life like this
True friends by my side
Nothing more that I need
They helped me when the world
Turns tough and cold
This is what family means
This is what family
Means.

Facing our problems
Following our path
'Til the day we'll die.

Never falter
Never a two-faced
Motherfuckers!

Always true to my friends!

I will never leave their side.

We will never grow up
If growing up is
Giving up on
Everything we believe.

I will die for my friends
I will never leave their side
This is my commitment
This is for all my life.
