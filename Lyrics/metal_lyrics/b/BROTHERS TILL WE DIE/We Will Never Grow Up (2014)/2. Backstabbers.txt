Backstabbers! [4x]

Watch your back

Watch your surroundings
Expect the traitor's hand
Knowing the truth
Wasn't in your plan.

Finally I've learned
From all my mistakes
Finally I've learned
Also friendship ends.

I won't try to save the life
Of a deadman
You have broken what I love
You are all I'm sick of.

Try to deny
I caught your lie,
Try to deny,
Don't ask me why,
Try to deny,
I caught your lie,
Try to deny,
Don't ask me why.

To me you're dead
I have decided.

Get straight to the point
You have made your choice:
Sell your friends for free
You have no loyalty.
