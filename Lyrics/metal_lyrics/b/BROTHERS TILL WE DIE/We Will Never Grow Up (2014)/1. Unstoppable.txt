These are my pillars
This is what I stand for
Never give up,
Never get back
Always looking at the sun.

Sometimes I feel alone,
Living by my own
This was my choice.
I don't believe in what's been told.

Television made us numb,
A generation lack of any inspiration.

Loveless
Emptiness
Careless
Loneliness

Isolated from the warm of others
I can't understand when we sold our souls.

This world makes me sick!

These are my pillars
This is what I stand for
Never give up,
Never get back
Always looking at the sun.
