[feat. Guille from This Thing Called Life]This is for all who talk in the distance
Only in your caves know about your existence
Tell me to the face
All your stupid words
Your life of regrets
Is a fucking joke.

Your life of regrets is a fucking joke.

Get a life
Talk is very cheap
You can't hide
This is you and me
Get a life
I'll bury you 2 meters deep.

[Guille:]
There is no mercy when you betrayed us
I smell your shit from miles away
Let me listen closely to your screams.

I will slice your tongue.

I am nothing, I am nothing like you.
