I still wonder
How could you sleep at night
After what you've
Done to me.

Cold words and broken promises
Running through your mouth.

You think you did well
You think you did well
Breaking my heart and soul
With your poisoned words.

I just hope time will tell,
And time will tell,
And time will tell.

Karma Imperator Mundi.

Treason's never a choice

I curse you
I curse your friends
I curse the moment when this story ends
And I keep telling to myself
I'll never be happy again.
