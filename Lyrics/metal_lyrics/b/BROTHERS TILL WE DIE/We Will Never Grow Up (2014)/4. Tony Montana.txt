Brothers 'til we die
This is our plan
Like a pack of wolves
Forever we stand.

Family and friends
My life for them all!

In this cold world
We'll bring the warm of love
Living the dream we proud of!
We proud of!

[Tony Montana:]
Say hello to my little friend

Keep your mind clear
Live with no fear [2x]
