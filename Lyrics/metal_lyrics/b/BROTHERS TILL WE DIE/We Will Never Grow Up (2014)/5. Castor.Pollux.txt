Always with my family
Always with my friends
These two statements will lead me
'Til the end.

Happiness only exist
If it's shared
Lead me through
Be my eyes.

Mine is yours
United we'll stand
Restless fight
Connecting our hearts
I will always be
An unstoppable light.

Learning from my brothers
Strong we will stand.
I'll never be afraid
If you take my hand.

This life prove us
Our hopes always win.
Forget the past
Fight like a team.

How many of you
Are still with me?
I've lost so many
People in the way.

It was real, baby
We were the best
But now it's too late
To still complain.

There's is a long way home
It's not safe to be alone
Even in the darkest hour
There's always hope.

Learning from my brothers
Strong we will stand.
I'll never be afraid
If you take my hand.

This life prove us
Our hopes always win.
Forget the past
Fight like a team.

People who's worth
Don't leave your side
They'll be with you
'Til the end of time.
