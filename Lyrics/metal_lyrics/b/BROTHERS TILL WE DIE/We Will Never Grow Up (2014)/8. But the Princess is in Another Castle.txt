[feat. Alfon from Fear My Intentions]When I look at you
There's one thing on my mind
The only think I knew
Was just a bunch of lies.

Sick of being sick
Tired of being tired.

I don't want these wounds to be heal
I don't want time to forget
I want to keep this alive
And taste the pain just to remind.

You're still in my veins
In my veins.

I've still got something more to ask:

How could you turn our love
Into poison?

[Alfon:]
You're a shit
Now I don't give a fuck anymore
No, I don't five a fuck any fucking more
I thought we had pure love
As you were injecting
Your poison in my neck
This is the deal, my moaning whore
This is the deal, fucking moaning whore:

Bite your tongue and suffocate in your poison.
In your poison
Poison fuck.
