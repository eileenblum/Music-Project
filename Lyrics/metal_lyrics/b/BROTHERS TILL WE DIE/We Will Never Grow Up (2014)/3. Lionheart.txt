[feat. Robbert from Wasted Bullet]Lost in my mind
Trying to get things right
This feeling on my chest
I can't deny.

So many things have changed
Did I grow up?
Did I get old?
Did I forgot to love?

Find no pleasure where it used to be found
Find no rest in the place where I belong
Time has passed, I am not the same
I make an effort, but everything's just lame.

Through my way
I will prevail

I will prevail
Where another's have failed
I'll break the chains
I will achieve my aims.

[Robbert:]
I'll wake up the lion
That lives in my heart
I'll revive the flame
That keeps me alive
This fire burns like it's never done before
Out of the rain and I won't go there anymore
Stand strong and be brave like a lion
With good heart or there is no point in trying.

Always proud
Of my life
Always proud
Of myself.
