Every night I close my eyes
Memories got me in my dreams
Iï¿½m lying on the battlefield
And blood is running down my neck
Never knew this pain I feel
Seems years ago thatï¿½s all been real
Bleeding crying people dying
Around me thousands screams for death

They shot a bullet in your head
Around me all is dead
The world has gone insane
So close your eyes in pain and die

I see the bridges burning
Reflections in my eyes
That feelingï¿½s much too cold to share
Another broken heart to spare

When the battle came to end
I felt something touch my hand
Two young boys look in my eyes
Some children standing side by side

Moving towards the place I lie
Raising hands into the sky
Hand in hand they start to sing
Of freedom peace and human rights

They shot a bullet in your head
Around me all is dead
The world has gone insane
So close your eyes in pain and die

I see the bridges burning
Reflections in my eyes
That feelingï¿½s much too cold to share
Another broken heart to spare

They shot a bullet in your head
Around me all is dead
The world has gone insane
So close your eyes in pain and die

I see the bridges burning
Reflections in my eyes
That feelingï¿½s much too cold to share
Another broken heart to spare
