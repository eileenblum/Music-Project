The only way you think is black or white
The only steps you move are left or right
Steered by instinct you donï¿½t use your brain
Caught between genius and going insane

Who should believe all the lies you just tell
Why canï¿½t you see itï¿½s your own soul you sell

The higher you climb the deeper you fall
What more do you want canï¿½t have it all
The higher you rise the deeper you sink
The only thing you are the missing link

Who you want to be or who youï¿½ve been
I canï¿½t see if itï¿½s just man or machine
Listen to the stories youï¿½re trying to tell
When you lie to others you lie to yourself

Who should believe all the lies you just tell
Why canï¿½t you see itï¿½s your own soul you sell

The higher you climb the deeper you fall
What more do you want canï¿½t have it all
The higher you rise the deeper you sink
The only thing you are the missing link

Your only solution is kill or be killed
We have never trust you and we never will
Is it real or have we been so blind
Heï¿½s the animal in all mankind

Who should believe all the lies you just tell
Why canï¿½t you see itï¿½s your own soul you sell

The higher you climb the deeper you fall
What more do you want canï¿½t have it all
The higher you rise the deeper you sink
The only thing you are the missing link
