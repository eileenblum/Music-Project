They follow blind their agressor
Side by side and line by line
Who are the liars
Hatefull fights for gods and races
Itï¿½s a war we cannot win
You are a betrayer

From everything you vlose your eyes
How many more will have to die
How many mothers have to cry
Until they come to stop this lie

Everytime I close my eyes
I feel an evil thing go around and around

Our brothers were imprisioned
For a crime theyï¿½ve never done
You are a liar
Our sons shall live in freedom
Our sons will live in peace
No more betrayer

From everything you vlose your eyes
How many more will have to die
How many mothers have to cry
Until they come to stop this lie

Everytime I close my eyes
I feel an evil thing go around and around
