Firstt time I ever saw her
Standing there she looked to me
A burning fire in her eyes
So much emotions in her
But deep inside I always knew
That sheï¿½ been hurt so many times

I see frozen tears
In your crystal eyes

How could I ever tell her
What she means to me by now
Sheï¿½s like a bird with broken wings
I wish I could make her see
All the feelings burn in me
I just want to make her fly again

I see frozen tears
In your crystal eyes

Forever I will keep her
In my heart sheï¿½ll never leave
To make the fire burning on
And when our last day has come
When itï¿½s time to say goodbye
I know there wonï¿½t be no more tears

I see frozen tears
In your crystal eyes
