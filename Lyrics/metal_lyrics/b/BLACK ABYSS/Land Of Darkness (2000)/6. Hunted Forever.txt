Oh my god what have I done
Feeling lost and all alone
Sitting here and asking me
Whatmy lifehasjust become

Hey have you ever had before
Such a feeling there is more
In your life of dark and cold
You have to find the light of day
Have to go another way
Reach your inner peace of mind believe in me

Ever and ever
Touched by a cold hand in the night
Running forever
Out in the cold thereï¿½s no way out

Hey have you ever lived before
Such a life of hell and gore
You wonï¿½t ever have much more
Youï¿½ll never find the light of day
Never find another way
Thereï¿½s no inner peace of mind believe in me

Hey have you ever died before
Can you tell me if there is more
There must be this canï¿½t be all
Now I have found the light of day
Found my own eternal way
To my inner peace of mind now I am free

Ever and ever
Touched by a cold hand in the night
Running forever
Out in the cold thereï¿½s no way out
