As I arrived at the lost hall of stone
My torch lights weakly up the hall
I am alone pulled by something strange
I see a black mirror itï¿½s calling my name

Dreams of endless black
I know that Iï¿½ll never-never come back
Dreams of endless black
Absurbed in the mirror with no way back

I feel in a dark dream and lost my control
Riding a white horse the floor is colored gold
Blood red horizon I cannot restrain
I heard the wind crying, crying my name

Dreams of endless black
I know that Iï¿½ll never-never come back
Dreams of endless black
Absurbed in the mirror with no way back

Wings of death where flying over my head
Too tired to go back just my own destiny
Pulled by something strange I couldnï¿½t restrain
My soul left my body now an empty cell

Dreams of endless black
I know that Iï¿½ll never-never come back
Dreams of endless black
Absurbed in the mirror with no way back
