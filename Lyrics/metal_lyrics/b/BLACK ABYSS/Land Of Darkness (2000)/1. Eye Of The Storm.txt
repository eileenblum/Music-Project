In the eye of the storm far beyond reality
We will rise from the ashes again
Under one gleaming sun reching out for unity
Never fall down again on your knees

In the eye of the storm where the restless creatures roam
Donï¿½t be shy and follow me my friend
In the eye of the storm where all dirt and dust is turned
Thereï¿½s a place where your soul is free

In a time so full of agony
Follow me my friend and you will see

In the eye of the storm where the restless creatures roam
Donï¿½t be shy and follow me my friend
In the eye of the storm where all dirt and dust is turned
Thereï¿½s a place where your soul is free

Just look up to the sky and tell what you see
Go my way and try to reach the stars
Youï¿½ll still believe in my words
When all the world will be gone
So donï¿½t cry for a dying mankind

In a time so full of agony
Follow me my friend and you will see

In the eye of the storm where the restless creatures roam
Donï¿½t be shy and follow me my friend
In the eye of the storm where all dirt and dust is turned
Thereï¿½s a place where your soul is free
