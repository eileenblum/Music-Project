Chainbreaker
Let the game begin
Will you lose or will you even win
Chainbreaker
Now your time has come
Itï¿½s never ending ï¿½til youï¿½re gone

We were born into a world of hate
No need to wonder weï¿½re all victims of fate
Day by day we have to fight to survive
Donï¿½t turn your back to me
Iï¿½ll take your life

Chainbreaker
Let the game begin
Will you lose or will you even win
Chainbreaker
Now your time has come
Itï¿½s never ending ï¿½til youï¿½re gone

Running, fighting, nothing more to do
Try to get me before I kill you
Iï¿½m behind you press your faceinto the dust
Tomorrowï¿½s coming just for one of us

Chainbreaker
Let the game begin
Will you lose or will you even win
Chainbreaker
Now your time has come
Itï¿½s never ending ï¿½til youï¿½re gone

Blood and death is ruling our world
We must pay the the price for whatï¿½s gone wrong
Forever and for all eternity
We can not escape our destiny

Chainbreaker
Let the game begin
Will you lose or will you even win
Chainbreaker
Now your time has come
Itï¿½s never ending ï¿½til youï¿½re gone
