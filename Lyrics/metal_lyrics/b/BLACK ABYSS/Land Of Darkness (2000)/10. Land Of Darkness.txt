There she stands by the lake
Snowwhite her skin and so empty her eyes
Her hair is flowing in the wind
Noone remembers her name
Her soul is fading to gray
Her life is wasted away

No pride inside a clash of hopeless life
There on the outside with nothing in her hands
Nameless and faithless disappeared her life
Existed with nothing to save her life

No time to try no place she ever had
There in her childhood
With nothing to regret
Faceless and shameless
Dissappeared her pride
Asking nothing ever about how or why

Go this way to the land of the dark
Far away to the land of the dangerzone

No way to go no other but his last
There in the darkness with nothing in her mind
Fearless and hopeless dissapeared herself
Leaving back nothing but black cold night

Go this way to the land of the dark
Far away to the land of the dangerzone

No pride inside a clash of hopeless life
There on the outside with nothing in her hands
Nameless and faithless disappeared her life
Existed with nothing to save her life

Go this way to the land of the dark
Far away to the land of the dangerzone
