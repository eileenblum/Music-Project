You're forced into a world
Of hate and lies
A God forgotten place
Destined to die

My fate I will not face
Your black and cold embrace
Salvation free my soul
May death be my savior

One step higher - evolution - live to die
Feel the fire - revolution - it's a lie
Domination - devastation - heaven sent
Damnation - damnation - it's where we end

War, corruption, terror
Rule our days
The monsters we create
Are here to stay

My fate I will not face
Your black and cold embrace
Salvation free my soul
May death be my savior

One step higher - evolution - live to die
Feel the fire - revolution - it's a lie
Domination - devastation - heaven sent
Damnation - damnation - it's where we end

Listen to my words
Before you die
No one ever dries
The tears we cry

My fate I will not face
Your black and cold embrace
Salvation free my soul
May death be my savior

One step higher - evolution - live to die
Feel the fire - revolution - it's a lie
Domination - devastation - heaven sent
Damnation - damnation - it's where we end
