Years ago you won't remember the time forever gone
More than friends we just were brothers
We stood together as one
All those memories, all our dreams and every tear we shared
But now you're gone, you turned to leave and no more I don't care

Can't love you, can't hate you
Don't know you, no more words to say
Don't want you, don't need you
Won't see you, never see you again

Lose or win, pray or sin
I don't mind, it's your affairs
Laught or cry, live or die
I do not worry, I don't care

Never I could understand the reason why this bad to be
Still I see hate in you but it's been leaving me
No more pain, there no more trust in you I won't believe
Play your games and go your way but never count on me

Can't love you, can't hate you
Don't know you, no more words to say
Don't want you, don't need you
Won't see you, never see you again

Lose or win, pray or sin
I don't mind, it's your affairs
Laught or cry, live or die
I do not worry, I don't care
