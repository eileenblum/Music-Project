When I was young man I've been fighting day by day
Fighting for my dream of freedom for my right to say
I am me, I'm my own nation, going my own way
Me and millions of my brothers, that's the game we play

Come with me, in a union we stand
Come with me, our rights we just defend
Come with me, all against conformity
Come with me, for rebellion shall be our destiny

We bad so much power and a fire in our eyes
Tear down the walls, destroy the system, fighting all their lies
Our burning souls, infinite will, together we were strong
One by one but all united, how could we be wrong

Come with me, in a union we stand
Come with me, our rights we just defend
Come with me, all against conformity
Come with me, for rebellion shall be our destiny
