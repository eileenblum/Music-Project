Day after day all the years I remember
I have been living like time never ended
If there's a tomorrow, it's so far away
It seemed like my life had a millions of days

When we are young we don't need to look back
When we look forward, horizon is black
Just take a look in the eyes of a child
Infinity's burning there restless and wild

There are thousand ways to go
A million places known
But time once lost will not return
There is so much more to give
The reason why we live
But time once passed (is) forever gone

Time is over, never coming back again
It's lost and gone by no more chance for another try
Time is over, but still it's running on and on
Wherever you hide it will be there and wait for you

Hours go by in those dark rainy cold nights
Sleepless and scared as I gaze at the moonlight
Wondering how it could be that my life ends
Has it been worth all that, what has it mean?

What is now left for me more than remembrance
When I will go there is nothing in my hands
Just take a look in the eyes of a wise man
There you will see how to face your horizon

There are thousand ways to go
A million places known
But time once lost will not return
There is so much more to give
The reason why we live
But time once passed (is) forever gone

Time is over, never coming back again
It's lost and gone by no more chance for another try
Time is over, but still it's running on and on
Wherever you hide it will be there and wait for you
