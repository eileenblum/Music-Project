Time's gone by, forever it's lost
Winter of life, eternal frost
Back in time, the early years
A young man full of hope appears

Into the abyss I'm falling
The creature of death now is calling
Beckoning we the hand of doom
I follow, make me see

Sadness and sorrow guide me to the other side
Now as the end is near for me, salvation is in sight
Blinded by darkness am I crawling in the dust
In your eyes I see my shadows of the past

Now it's near, the night has come
I see clear now, it's work is done
The truth is here and it ends like a knife
Willing to hurt me this beast called life

Into the abyss I'm falling
The creature of death now is calling
Beckoning we the hand of doom
I follow, make me see

Sadness and sorrow guide me to the other side
Now as the end is near for me, salvation is in sight
Blinded by darkness am I crawling in the dust
In your eyes I see my shadows of the past

I've lost my will, so many wasted years
I never knew the meaning of fear
After all there will be nothing left
I close my eyes, in peace I rest

Into the abyss I'm falling
The creature of death now is calling
Beckoning we the hand of doom
I follow, make me see

Sadness and sorrow guide me to the other side
Now as the end is near for me, salvation is in sight
Blinded by darkness am I crawling in the dust
In your eyes I see my shadows of the past
