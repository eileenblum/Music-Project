Somewhere in the dark there's a shadow falling down on me
Covers me wherever I go, where it takes me I'm too blind to know
Out there in the night I need to find the light
To lead me on the path we have to go

In a time, in a dark age, known as present day
The legend, the new messiah, he's reborn to end his way
Fear him, he's in disguise, dead eyes, his soul is black
Came for final judgement, it's here now, the beast is back

The angels wear black, holy bibles are burning
The good and the evil, their powers collide
The angels wear black, armageddon is calling
Your souls will be taken, the end of mankind

In his name they will divide the sinners that walk the earth
They sent us to purgatory, our downfall a new rebirth
By his word, his prophecy, fall down on your knees
Damned ones, you shall be cursed, a desert the earth will be

The angels wear black, holy bibles are burning
The good and the evil, their powers collide
The angels wear black, armageddon is calling
Your souls will be taken, the end of mankind

In the end our planet dies, a new age, decay begins
Crucified to wash away the seven deadly sins
The dark one, what has he been, messiah or antichrist
One day, when he'll return, a better kind will rise

The angels wear black, holy bibles are burning
The good and the evil, their powers collide
The angels wear black, armageddon is calling
Your souls will be taken, the end of mankind

Somewhere in the dark there's a shadow falling down on me
Covers me wherever I go, where it takes me I'm too blind to know
Out there in the night I need to find the light
To lead me on the path we have to go
