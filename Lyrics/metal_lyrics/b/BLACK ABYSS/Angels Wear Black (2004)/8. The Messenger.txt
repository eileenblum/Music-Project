Full moon shining cold outside, I'm walking in a sweat
Something strange inside a nightmare, just a shilouette
But now it's coming closer to me, his breath it strikes my skin
Am I insane or is it real, the nightmare I'm still in

Beware of what you dream
Save me from my dreams

Black holes where his eyes should be, a face as cold as ice
A shiver's running down my neck, my throat is hot and dry
I cannot move, I'm turned to stone as he begins to speak
You'll do my deed, you can't deny, the human will's too weak

Beware of what you dream
Save me from my dreams

Every night - he's talking to you
He's by your side - he makes it come true
Deep in your mind - He manipulates
The messenger's here - He's choosing your fate

The sun is shinning bright outside, I'm waking up again
Last night I cannot remember, it's every time the same
I don't care I never wonder, 'bout the strange things that I do
Until the shilouette is back, the messenger it's you

Beware of what you dream
Save me from my dreams

Every night - he's talking to you
He's by your side - he makes it come true
Deep in your mind - He manipulates
The messenger's here - He's choosing your fate
