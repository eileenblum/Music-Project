A shadow has fallen all over the sky
The curse has begun as the wizard has died
Killed by the king in the name of their god
His gravestone is covered with words of his blood

The king did not care and spit on the grave
Upon his throne felt so mighty and brave
But soon came the storm, a big thrust and disease
Over his kingdom the curse's now set free

Revenge will be mine, these last words I have spoken
The blood of your sins will break the spell

For the blood on your hands for my death you will pray
It's the only way to wash your sins away
For your kingdom to save and for to make your eyes see
Forever remember my dark legacy

Caught in his suffer, the king's torn in two
Offer my own life, what else can I do?
My sons or my kingdom I won't give away
Too late to regret
But it's my turn to pay

Revenge will be mine, these last words I have spoken
The blood of your sins will break the spell

For the blood on your hands for my death you will pray
It's the only way to wash your sins away
For your kingdom to save and for to make your eyes see
Forever remember my dark legacy

The wizard appears, a cold smile in his eyes
The king makes his offer but he just denies
Feel all my pain now for what you have done
Forever he dies then, the spell it lives on

Revenge will be mine, these last words I have spoken
The blood of your sins will break the spell

For the blood on your hands for my death you will pray
It's the only way to wash your sins away
For your kingdom to save and for to make your eyes see
Forever remember my dark legacy
