Straight from hell appeared the evil creature
Prepared to kill to take away all life
It shares to you and you cannot resist
His black dead eyes so full of hate to mankind

Deep black night is falling down to earth
The end comes near from deep below the diabolic curse
A nameless evil took it's human shape
It's deep inside of all mankind, just waiting to escape

He come to make the human race bow down
Reign of terror, his pleasure your pain
Be his slave until the end of all days
'til the last drop of human blood falls down to the ground

Deep black night is falling down to earth
The end comes near from deep below the diabolic curse
A nameless evil took it's human shape
It's deep inside of all mankind, just waiting to escape

Born out from your rotten tombs
It means war
Hear his name and die in fear
It means war
The gates of hell are open now
It means war
Out of the mirror, it slaves to you
It means war

The essence of evil's coming down on you
No way to refuse, no need to obey
The incarnation of a nightmare comes true
Rips the flesh of your body takes your soul away

Deep black night is falling down to earth
The end comes near from deep below the diabolic curse
A nameless evil took it's human shape
It's deep inside of all mankind, just waiting to escape

Born out from your rotten tombs
It means war
Hear his name and die in fear
It means war
The gates of hell are open now
It means war
Out of the mirror, it slaves to you
It means war
