Forgotten ages of the past
An endless trip - a holy quest
Their tribe was lost in misery
For their promised land - they would search until the end

Until they found a foreign land
Controlled by an evil hand
The king and his warriors
Explored the land - until their quest will end

Attacked by hordes of flying creatures
Spears are thrown against the men
Thousands were killed and wounded
In a deadly zone - will they lose and fall?

A gorge into a cave was opened
No light inside the stony hills
All they feel were haunted spites
Caught like in a cage - no way out for the brave

Conquering of fate - and we will never fall from grace
Conquering of fate - we have to take this resolution
Conquering of fate - and we will never fall from grace
Conquering of fate - the time is right for a revolution

Seems to be a fatal trap
Staring in the creatures morbid face
Surrounded by the smell of its breath
It's no trivial fight - mental cruelty and death

It's time to take on the fight
Create your destiny - show your might
Change the evolution - for eternity
Fight against the beast - by the sea of destiny

[CHORUS 2x]
