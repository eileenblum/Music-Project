Guardian angels will you find the time
To heal the bleeding wounds of mine
Stones and steel smashed hard on the ground
We were lost ....and we were found

Run aground on an empty coast of hope
Silent waves awake the bitter truth
It's just too real for an evil dream
Bleeding flesh beyond stone and steel

As long as I'm bleeding I'm alive
As long as I'm bleeding I won't cry
As long as I'm bleeding I'm alive
As long as I'm bleeding

I will increase my strength // my hate // my force

Living in a world of truth and lies
Searching reflections of the light
Time will melt down mountains of ice
There's no perfection in our life

As long as I'm bleeding...
Guardian angel lead me to the light
Feel the spreading hope and might
We don't run and hide from a furious fight
Hold my bleeding body... hold it tight

As long as I'm bleeding I'm alive
As long as I'm bleeding I won't cry
As long as I'm bleeding I'm alive
As long as I'm bleeding

I will increase my strength // my hate // my force
