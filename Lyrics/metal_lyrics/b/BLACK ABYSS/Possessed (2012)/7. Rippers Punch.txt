Empty town, a random victim bleeds
In the alley it was found
Your silhouette your shape,
You're so alone
This is my sweet romance to
Bring the harvest home

My way, my aim,
Fatal error, your blame
You're forced, to stay
Your beautiful innocence
Becomes your fatal trap

Rippers punch, loaded gun
Now I start the rippers punch,
Chainsaw run, havoc and bloodshed
Rippers punch, loaded gun
Now I start the rippers punch,
Mordio, silence

Can't resist incurable disease
Perverted lust, no release
Torrent of wasted tears
You're still alone
This was my sweet romance
Bone after bone

My way, my aim
Fatal error, your blame
You're forced, to stay
Your beautiful innocence
Becomes your fatal trap

Rippers punch, loaded gun
Now I start the rippers punch
Chainsaw run, havoc and bloodshed
Rippers punch, loaded gun
Now I start the rippers punch
Mordio, silence

Rippers Punch - Loaded gun
Rippers Punch - Chainsaw run
Rippers Punch - Loaded gun
Rippers Punch - Chainsaw run
Mordio, silence
