Cruelty made me strong, fears are gone, there's no right or wrong
I do what must be done, not to run, when seeds of death are sown
They can't fly away, their broken wings, carry them no more
Riddle to them all, when tragedies, will go on and on

I can't describe the fear I feel, I saw it in my dream
My destiny, my final destination

When you reach the aim tomorrow
When the reaper commands to follow
All that's left , your empty husk
They will burn out love and lust

When you reach the aim tomorrow
When the reaper says: "NOW FOLLOW"
No way out to break the spell
Follow (the) sinners down to hell

As the morning dawned, the blood red sun, it looks as dark as death
Like a drowning man, clutching at a straw that is too short
I try to break the rules, rules of death should exist no more
And like a lightning bolt out of the blue, life was absolutely new

I can't describe the fear I felt, I saw it in my dream
My destiny, my final destination

When you reach the aim tomorrow
When the reaper commands to follow
All that's left, your empty husk
They will burn out love and lust

When you reach the aim tomorrow
When the reaper says: "NOW FOLLOW"
No way out to break the spell, follow (the) sinners down to hell
