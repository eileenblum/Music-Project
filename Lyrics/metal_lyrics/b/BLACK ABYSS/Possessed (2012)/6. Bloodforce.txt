Man became machine, out to redeem
Hateful humankind prepare for the extreme
My dignity is reaped, brutality will lead
We won't strike from behind, the metal force machine

In my burning eyes, I search for a sacrifice
Complete demise, to take away your life
My word is done for now I'm vanishing to haze
My destiny is opening new ways

Invisible like the night, you'll never feel the pain
Born to hate born to kill, we fight to break the rules
You'll get what you deserve, feel my hate and bloodlust
This world (will) deny, humanity

Never strike from behind, we're the metal blood force
Never strike from behind, we're the metal blood force
We're the metal blood force - BLOODFORCE

Search the enemy, in society
Wake up from your sleep the metal force is real
Pure brutality, worst of all your dreams
Boiling up from hell to kill morality

Invisible like the night, you'll never feel the pain
Born to hate born to kill, we fight to break the rules
You'll get what you deserve, feel my hate and bloodlust
This world (will) deny, humanity

Never strike from behind, we're the metal blood force
Never strike from behind, we're the metal blood force
We're the metal blood force - BLOODFORCE

When I feel the time has come, to set me free
When I feel I'm saturated, by agony
I swear to god, you will remember me
Never strike from behind, the metal force machine
