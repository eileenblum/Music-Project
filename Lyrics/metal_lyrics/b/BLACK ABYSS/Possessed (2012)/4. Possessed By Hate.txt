Your poisoning you plead for it
Your time has come, indignity

Possessed by hate of your face, mankind
Demonic spell, demonic mind
Possessed by hate of your prayers and your lies
Indifferent about what's wrong or right

Your poisoning you plead for it
Your time has come, indignity
Total thrill one hundred ten percent
My will be done that's who I am

Possessed by thoughts that are not divine
Serenity can not be defined
Obsessed you gaze down from the shrine
Blinded by your mystic shine

Your poisoning you plead for it
Your time has come, indignity
Total thrill one hundred ten percent
My will be done, that's who I am
