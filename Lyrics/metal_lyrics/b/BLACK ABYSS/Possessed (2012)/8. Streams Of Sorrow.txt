Waiting wishing a peaceful end
When the time has come to die
Waiting for the final rest
No regrets in life
No reproach 'cause I am the last
The last one on his way
The last one who is all alone
My bright shine fades to grey

Looking back teary eyed
As the last bird sang his song
I know my destiny, switch off the light
Soon I'll be gone

When your soul leaves your body and fly
You meet the end of time
Sail down the streams of sorrow
Your death makes me insane
Such a loss, it's my decay
But soon comes the day
I will walk the same way

A peaceful end was my last will
My final words unspoken
I press the air into my lungs
I fought hard, now I'm broken

Depression killed my life and love
Now all what's left is pain
The last cue I remember
She was dancing in the rain

Looking back teary eyed
As the last bird sang his song
I know my destiny,
Switch off the light
Soon I'll be gone

When your soul leaves your body and fly
You meet the end of time
Sail down the streams of sorrow
Your death makes me insane
Such a loss, it's my decay
But soon comes the day
I will walk the same way

When your soul leaves your body and fly
You meet the end of time
Sail down the streams of sorrow
Your death makes me insane
Such a loss, it's my decay
But soon comes the day
I will walk the same way

Same way
