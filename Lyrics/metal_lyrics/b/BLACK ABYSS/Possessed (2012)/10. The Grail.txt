This is not our century, hundreds of years just flown away
All is lost no one can see, inhuman earth in misery
A secret present of the past, lost in the ruins we've built
Transience is all you see it's your task to set us free

Read the signs of the stars above
The key to your final quest
Angels will spread their wings
And they alight your path

The path you walk is real the devils claw behind you
Follow a distance scream-step on brave, catch your dream
In ruins beyond a burning sun, whispering souls you hear
Between dream and reality you will set us free

Read the signs of the stars above
The key to your final quest
Angels will spread their wings
And they alight your path

The tale of the only one
The battles of the king
Incredible mystery was real
The body of a queen

Read the signs of the stars above
The key to your final quest
Angels will spread their wings
And they alight your path
