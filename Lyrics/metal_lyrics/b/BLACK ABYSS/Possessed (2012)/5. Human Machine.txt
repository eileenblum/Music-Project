Human machine, give me a sign, teach me to speak, I will
Human machine, what will I find, teach me to read
Tell me the reason of my life, command me where to walk
Tell me how to talk

WALK TALK SCREAM directed like a human machine
WALK TALK SCREAM directed like a human machine

Human machine, confuse my mind, priorities, I can't find
Human machine, destroyed memories, dead skin on steel
Push me around down to the ground, command me where to walk
Tell me how to talk

WALK TALK SCREAM directed like a human machine
WALK TALK SCREAM directed like a human machine

Human machine, I'm in misery, stole my mind from me
Human machine, too blind to see, a material world
All we chase won't set us free, command me where to walk
Tell me how to talk

WALK TALK SCREAM directed like a human machine
WALK TALK SCREAM directed like a human machine
