When you throw these fits, I only see what I want to see We need to talk just means, you'll never be what I need you to be I need to be told, I need to be sold There were times you stayed so silent L.ooking O.ut V.isionless E.yes What were you hoping to find? Are you even human on the inside? This is just like old times with you You're so quiet and I'm kicking over everything in the room When I throw these fits, you just see what you want to see We need to talk just means we have nothing to fight for
