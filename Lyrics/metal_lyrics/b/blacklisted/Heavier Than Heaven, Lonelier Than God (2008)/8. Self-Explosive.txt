If I said what this was about Would you even care? Would you stare at me defeated? Or would you say that "all is fair"? Would you believe me if I told you this time it's not about you? I know it's hard to believe But it's not all about you How selfish of you to believe that when you cut yourself off you didn't cut me just as deep How selfish of you to say that you know me better than me How selfish of you to hide in a circle of lies pretending everything's fine But the thought of anyone but you never crossed the landmines in your mind You're just pretending to be naive You can't really believe that this is about you You, You, You, You, You
