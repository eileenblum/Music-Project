Please just give me a Chan Marshall eulogy If I was ever anything at all it's all breaking news to me Breaking down in a rage just to apologize It's really so strange watching all these strangers sigh If feels like I'm living through my last days every day On your strongest of days you couldn't make me feel any less insane Wish the ongoing theme about me wasn't "he's just crazy" Wish I knew safety Wish nothing phased me Wish I felt more than just feelings of unrest Wish the darkness didn't cloud me Wish I wasn't an emotional wreck
