The pressure's building and nothing's fulfilling Slow down I can't keep running The good word is "You get what you deserve" I know my time is coming Hey, Hey, Hey I'm the only one left in my life I am me and I am mine So go ahead say that I'm ill But do you know what that really means? Hey, Hey, Hey Everyone's open to heaven But no one's open to death That's why the whole world is a graveyard Filled with those who lost their step I'm the only one left in my life I am me and I am mine So go ahead say that I'm ill But do you know what that really means? There's times I know I don't take care of myself So lost inside my mixed state mental health We all bury ourselves, when we feel there's nothing left We don't need Jesus to please us It's not as comforting as you'd like to guess
