Was it always like this? Finding new ways to clench my fist It doesn't take a genius to prove I take swings at the things that remind me of my youth You'll never keep them guessing wearing other people's clothes So just start confessing Mother, Father, Sister, Brother Everybody knows There's nothing you can do to wash away your past They'll just laugh and laugh when you ask Will it always be like this?
