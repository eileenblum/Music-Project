There is no line to be drawn When I just turn my back and withdraw Silently defy You're so sad, you write your own version of my life My tongue's been bitten through There's nothing to do but stand and watch the truth Roll its eyes at the lies as it lies down and dies inside Your favorite fire Shackled to the weight of your emptiness Please don't take my silence As passiveness
