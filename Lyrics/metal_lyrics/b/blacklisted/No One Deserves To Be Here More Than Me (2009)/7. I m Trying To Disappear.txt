This lifeâs not inventing The fighting in me has ceased When it looks like Iâm Growing thin and weak Please donât hesitate to cut the leash Itâs only a matter of time Before I inherit my bloodlines evils I donât think itâs wise for me to get close to too many people My bruises seem to be breeding And my boys becoming a landing strip for flies In the mirror watching blood dry Trying to cut out the bags beneath my eyes My skin is turning grey I havenât bathed in days Please donât encourage me Iâm enslaved I canât be saved. Enslaved I canât be saved, Enslaved I cant be saved Enslaved I canât be saved, Enslaved I cant be saved Enslaved I canât be saved, Enslaved I cant be saved Enslaved I canât be saved, Enslaved I cant be saved Enslaved I canât be saved, Enslaved I cant be saved Enslaved I canât be saved, Enslaved I cant be saved Enslaved I canât be saved, Enslaved I canât be saved
