Since Iâve been on the wane the days have felt exactly the same I heard you squealing my name Well, let them think whatever they may You painted the perfect picture From inside the pen with your New pig friends Iâve watched your disappointment in me grow From the other side of the fence The child that you didnât want our children to be You squealed and you squealed In the pen with all the pigs All the times you left work early to check on me was sweet Wish I did more to welcome you but I was just trying to sleep Still I have reason all my own why Iâm this way And knowing all that you know you chose to Squeal my name And I may be shit But I didnât once think That youâd choose to climb into a pen with pigs Live in it
