It was always the world that I was crushed beneath Scraping concrete with my teeth till it bleeds All I ever asked though it all was Please tell me that nothings wrong Lost in my sickness This is not a phase On the top of a burning house daring the roof to cave Its funny because coming from me That doesnât even seem insane No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me Sometimes I leave the house early Just to ride the subway all day Sizing up every station To see which one fits my plan of jumping In front of the train No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me In the shower alone with all the lights out Talking to the tree bugs again as they crawl on my towel The hot steam ran like a waterfall down the wall Pressed my tongue to the socket see if I could feel at all No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me No one will ever come for me No one needs to tell me That thereâs no use for me around here anymore Iâm humbly watching my life crumble from this bubble I created Well itâs the greats It was always the greatest It was always the world that I was crushed beneath Scraping concrete with my teeth tilâ it bleeds All I ever asked though it all was Please tell me that nothings wrong Please tell me that nothings wrong Please tell me that nothings wrong Please tell me that nothings wrong Please tell me that nothings wrong
