Those secrets that youâve know Well youâre the only one Iâve ever told Like the summers as a child I spent alone On the beach searching for gold Make no mistake Iâm exactly Iâm exactly what you make me And now I just want to dance at your funeral Because I already paid the band With the gold I found buried in the sand Was I ever part of the life you had planned Those secrets that youâve known Well youâre the only one Iâve ever told Like that Christmas that I spent alone Trying to stay alive until you got home Visions of you with a stranger on a semen soaked love seat patterned floral If you can cast the first stone Well you can be the first to call me immoral Make no mistake I'm exactly I'm exactly what youâve made me. And now I just want to dance at your funeral Because I already paid the band With the gold I found buried in the sand Was I ever part of the life you had planned Those secrets that youâve known Well youâre the only one Iâve ever told Like the time you bailed me out of jail and you cried the whole way home Then you left and I loved myself with a closed fist and your shampoo for added bliss I must admit Iâve gotten better since I vomit blood when Iâm my happiest Make no mistake Make no mistake Make no mistake Iâm exactly What You Made Me Those sects that youâve known Well youâre the only one I ever told So I suggest you stop snooping though my things whenever Iâm not home
