I know youâre waiting in the wings I welcome you my stranger We live like rats anyway so this moment I must savor If you could only touch me And feel what I am feeling Scars form like Braille on my hands Moving like maggots when I try to reveal them I am only scared because I myself am scary If it wasnât for the roaches in the wall thereâd be No one Who could Stand me I see you there alone and just waiting I welcome you as a friend do please do not Betray me I am only scared because I myself am scary Just do what we agreed and Beat my Brains In I am only scared because I myself am scary I am, I am Extraordinary I am extraordinary I am extraordinary I am extraordinary Well I am, I am I am extraordinary I am extraordinary I am extraordinary Well I am, I am I am extraordinary I am extraordinary I am extraordinary Well I am, I am I am extraordinary I am extraordinary I am extraordinary Well I am, I am
