Self worth is worthless when Iâm constantly on trail Armed with a smile that just smells of stomach bile I need to move to the country So my malevolent mind can relax for a while Iâm selling myself off Everything must go My skin from my head to toe Down to my bones Maybe theyâre hiring scarecrows I can sit in a field in the sun I donât need the training I already repulse everyone Iâm selling myself off, everything must go My skin from my head to toe Down to my bones, down to my bones Iâm selling myself off, everything must go Down to my bones,down to my bones, down to my bones
