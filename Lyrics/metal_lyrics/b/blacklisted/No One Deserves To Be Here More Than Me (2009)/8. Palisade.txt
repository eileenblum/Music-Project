Build a place to keep me safe From those who fill their pockets wile the others pray If I had my way id carve away my face Fix me, Iâm in a fragile state Its all okay, Iâm made of clay I can mold and remold and remold into any shape Like a butterfly I crawl till I fly Waiting for my wings so this worm can worship the sky Build a place to keep me safe From those who fill their pockets while the others pray If I had my pick id carve you Into my skin So we could be identical twins Draw the drapes, Iâm insane At least thatâs what they say Who are they, I donât know Its hard to explain They have names, yes they do They each named after states Want to see a trick Just wait and Ill disintegrate Build me a place to keep me safe From those who fill their pockets while the others pray If I had my way id carve away my face Fix me, Iâm in a fragile state Fix me, Iâm in a fragile state Build me a place to keep me safe From those who fill their pockets while the others pray If I had my pick id carve you Into my skin So we could be identical twins
