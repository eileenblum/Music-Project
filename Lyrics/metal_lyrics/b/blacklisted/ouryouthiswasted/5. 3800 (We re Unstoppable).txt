I blame you most of all for this, The songs I sing, The loves I missed, The words you spoke The heart you broke, The sleepless nights where I can't cope. The good, the bad, the in between, All the times you believed in me, You've thrown it all away, Can't believe I'm losing you (I can't wallow in my losses) Left with time and nothing to say, Guess it's time to face the facts, I'll still save the fucking straws that broke my.... BACK. I'll never know what you wanted me to do, 'Cause you didnt care, I'll get by try my best This I swear on your life.
