DONT CARE--about my generation, DONT CARE--if I stand or fall, DONT CARE--about my reputation I'm chasing aspirations I never saw. Well fuck you! So sick of culture sickness And all that I have witnessed I can't face a crowd Please believe me when I fucking say, Times about the last thing that we need, I know how it feels to not want to speak, Sometimes I wonder if I'll remember names of the faces that just went away with age, Please just go and leave me alone..
