Twenty one years getting older, Cashing in chips on my shoulder, Ice age coming warm heart turned cold, You're killing me or so I'm told, Memories are miseries company, I've bared my fair share, Promise land not far from here, But beggars prayers got me nowhere. String me on this fucking cross, I gave in to your cause, This is where I'd cut a loss, And tally up all my falls. I NEVER PROMISED YOU ANYTHING. I NEVER PROMISED YOU ANYTHING. Stuck in all these places Never wanted to be, Feels like a thousand faces, Staring back at me, Just let me be.
