Loose lips have sunken our ships. we don't need to be reminded of it. The bridges we walk on have been burned, just another lesson learned. You cannot discredit me, I've been following destiny and I've still got a bone to pick with whoever called me a heretic. Miserably misunderstood. you see through everything I said. What makes you want to rely on me? Living through my ups and downs, I'm just trying to balance out. Hopelessly Hopeless and out of luck. please be quiet you selfish fuck. Miserably misunderstood, you see through everything I say. What makes you want to rely on me? Let's let the music speak for itself.
