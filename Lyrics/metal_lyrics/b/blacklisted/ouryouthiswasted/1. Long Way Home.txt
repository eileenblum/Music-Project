My ego has been bruised, Havent you heard the news? Used my last excuse, now I'm falling. Just cant see through my lies, See the ghost behind my eyes, Severed all my ties, Said my goodbyes. I faced an army of myself, and I failed. My good intentions, were last seen falling through the cracks. You're pointing out everything that I lack. All my misfortunes were last seen leaving your lips, Silence is golden. Time for me to cash in. I'm taking the long way home from here, THE LONG WAY HOME. I'm taking the wrong way home from here, THE WRONG WAY HOME.
