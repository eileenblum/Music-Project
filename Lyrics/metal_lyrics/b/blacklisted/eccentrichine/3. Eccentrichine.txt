Told me "Don't be so sensitive" So I ripped out my teeth and spoke in tongues through my gums. Said you saw no future in me So I drew your picture in my blood. Told me there was no halo above my head So I declared was horns instead. Is that, enough for you Is that, enough for you Is that, enough for you There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do Told me I was a piss poor liar So I set fire to your car and came clean with the truth. Told me I sleep too much So I stayed awake for most of the month. Until we went out to dinner with your parents, I passed out on at the table and they thought I was on drugs. Is that, enough for you Is that, enough for you Is that, enough for you There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do It's amazing without anyone twisting your arm You stuck around this long. It's amazing without anyone twisting your arm You stuck around at all. It's amazing without anyone twisting your arm You stuck around this long. It's amazing without anyone twisting your arm You stuck around at all. There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do There is no telling what I may do
