Your guise fell, Like dominoes
On your belly crawl follow your grimy glow
So indignant at my indifference to you
Begin to thaw, I see through you
You were so glad to hear I've weakened, my bones couldn't hold my skin
I lifted all of Pennsylvania when my world began to spin
Wreck chaser
I see through you.
You sneered at me when I said Id get healthy
Like when I had nothing as a child
and laughed at other kids water ice melting
You were seething to see I've strengthened, tough bones and perfect skin
I finally left Pennsylvania and its entire world of shit
Your guise fell, Like dominoes
On your belly crawl follow your grimy glow
So indignant at my indifference to you
Begin to thaw, I see through you
