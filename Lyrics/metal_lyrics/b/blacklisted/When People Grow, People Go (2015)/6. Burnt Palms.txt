Burnt palms hold your anger and don't let it show, don't let it go
Tuck it beneath the scars in your palm and watch the callus grow
Keep it safe don't let it show, don't let it go
Just watch it grow
Balled fist hold your forgiveness safe in your hands like a snow globe
Fragile now don't let it go
Keep it safe, don't let it show
Forget it, I dare you, let it go
You've grown callous
Said I could never change well hows this
Press your palms together quote psalms watch the callous grow
Empty church alone, Roam, your way up to the steeple
Swan dive, Go, Test your faith in people
They wont catch you, I've been through this, Im not evil
You've grown callous, Callous, Callous
You've grown callous
