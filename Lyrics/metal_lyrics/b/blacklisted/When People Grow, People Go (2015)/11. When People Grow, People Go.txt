There is no easy way to explain if you couldn't piece together the clues
I wasn't that cunning, that astute, How could you not see through the ruse?
Affected everyone I loved and they all left beautifully bruised
Im as shallow as a Schuylkill cruise, still Im sorry for the abuse
I took the only way I knew
But the road was closed
I couldn't just call your name
There is no easy way to explain
When people grow
People go
Too proud to reach out when I lost my brave
I couldn't find another way, Couldn't look myself in the face
I didn't have the strength, No, I couldn't take the weight
There is no easy way to explain when it all begins to cave
I took the only way I knew
But the road was closed
I couldn't just call your name
There is no easy way to explain
When people grow
People go
There is no easy way, To explain
When people grow, People go
There is no easy way to explain there is no easy way
Too proud to reach out, When I was dying
