They will kill you for your dreams
So what I need
Is for you to shake me when I start to drift to sleep
Our wait, Will never be over
This weight, Will never have closure
Don't let me speak, Don't let me sleep
When the creation fills my mouth
Just break my teeth
Our lives are broken
Exploding and floating
Time, Will not be kind
No one survives
Trying to escape the universe as it floods the highway
Black ice
Frozen light
I see heaven behind me
Above me its hovering
I can feel it crumbling
Don't try to find me, Don't be kind to me
Walked barefoot on the sun to drink tea and live quietly
Our lives are broken
Exploding and floating
Time, Will not be kind
No one survives
