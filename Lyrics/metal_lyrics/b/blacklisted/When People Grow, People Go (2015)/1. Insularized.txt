Wounds self inflicted I can heal myself
Theres a magic being encased in flesh
I try to will the world away
This life's a prison and so is the next
The truth is I deserve this, When I find good I hurt it
My sense of self doesn't allow empathy
Close my mouth I wont learn their language
Close my eyes to simplify the scenery
A disassociated, self-deserter, I look at these as strengths.
Im rigid, I've learned the power of NO. I wont bend, Id rather break
Theres no salvation made when theres nothing to salvage or save
Theres no expiration date to recover from the damage you create
Do not let the truth be exorcised
Sit safely inside your lies
Surrenders just a word for dropping your guard
When theres no one left to harm
We all die, We all die
We all die disguised
We all die, We all die
We all die disguised
Close my mouth I wont learn their language
Close my eyes to simplify the scenery
