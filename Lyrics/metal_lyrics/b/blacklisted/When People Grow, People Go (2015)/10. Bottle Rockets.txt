Behind closed doors you declared war
Glass breaking and raining my house looked like the fourth
I could not find the cure to your crying
My bathtub became the shield of Orion
Your tongue lashed out like a Roman candle
Secrets shot like comet shells ripping through your teeth
There is no cure to my detachment
I can be so silent; I can be so still
Fury tore like napalm dripping from your skin
I can be so mean; I can be so cruel
Let it go from your hand and keep your head down
Should have read the directions I'm dangerous
Next time you point and shoot don't miss
