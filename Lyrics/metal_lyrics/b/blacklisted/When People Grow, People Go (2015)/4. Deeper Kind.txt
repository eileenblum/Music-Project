This is a deeper kind of resurrecting
Dealing with feelings I've always neglected
Hospital gowned, confined to a bed
A deeper kind of death
This is a deeper kind of scar
The ceiling keeps moving swallowing the floor
This bed is a hollow as hollow as you
A deeper kind of abuse
This is a deeper kind
A deeper kind of mercy
This is a deeper kind of dark
The ground keeps shaking trying to depart
Leave it behind with all I destroyed
A deeper kind of void
This is a deeper kind of forgiveness
Conscious of nothing but my existence
My will and the strength to survive
A deeper kind of light
This is a deeper kind
A deeper kind of faith
