Change my appearance to a disappearance
Im so selfish and narcissistic
Cross out another friend from the short list
I can't write my way out of this
Admired for weaving words together
Riddled in rhyme
Little do they know I can barely live inside
My body most of the time
Destroy the old, to build a new
A monolith of bliss
But the cracks in the mirror show
A lifetime more of this
You're just a day-tripper gripping my truth
As transparent as the pyramid at the Louvre
What did we learn in Saturn's return?
Foreign observer just stay safe and observe
Foreign Observer
Foreign observer
Wake me up when you yourself are found
Foreign observer
Don't make eclipses out of my shadow on the ground
Foreign Observer
How long can you sit and watch this hole I am in fill up?
My spirit be crushed by gravity
