If I should ever fall from grace, Just let me fall right on my face, Turn around and walk away, My soul just ain't worth the save, Your wasting your life waiting for me to come around, But when I hit the ground I'm off and running, Your trying to build something out of nothing, Say you'll never give up, But I can tell you one thing, The only person I've ever been afraid of is me, Cause I hear the things I hear and I see the things I see, It's been twenty-two years since I've bothered to care, I'm not impressed with yourloneliness or the fact that your still here, I'd say sorry if I thought you'd believe it, I'd promise you something if I thought that I could mean it, I'd show you the way, I'd promise you hope, But I won't.
