I've stood on a wire with no desire to ever go a certain way, Looked down on the world never tried to be heard, Real life just had to wait,when I tried working it just didn't seem to work out, so I tried college but I just wound up dropping out, I've put my life on a shelf while everyone around me found happiness and wealth, A tourist among my family and friends They all wanna know what goes on inside my head, There all happy in homes of their own while I have nothing to call my own, I lived between right and wrong for far too long.
