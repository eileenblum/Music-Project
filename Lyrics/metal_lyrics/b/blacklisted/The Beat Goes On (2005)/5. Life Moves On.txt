Going through the motions, Can't turn back time, I've lost all devotion, I've had inside, Like anyone I've learned to play like I'm blind, I've learned to believe I'll always get by, So many times I've wished my emotions would just give in, So I could be anything, Anything but human, Like anyone I've learned to play like I'm blind, I've learned to believe I'll always get by, Life moves on or so I'm told, Life moves on when your gone.
