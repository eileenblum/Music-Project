I was thinking to myself, If you keep performing this act you just might lose yourself, All of this just desn't suit you but you wear it with a smile, Inside I know your not happy so I'll bite my tongue for a while, I've seen it now for myself, Your just slowly losing yourself, You look so old, Felling so cold, Believing all the lies you're told, I'd say something if I had something to say, It was all so long ago, I feel like I went astray, Treading water, Trying to breathe in, I should have been there by there was no way of knowing, All this time, You were drifting, Drifting away.
