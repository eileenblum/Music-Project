The end is just the beginning of being lost then found, You find yourself wondering how it would be if you weren't around, Here I am, Here I stand, I've reached out my hand, But you had a different plan, I've should have known you were one of the wolves at my door, You drain the life from me, I'm so easily deceived, I just wasn't made to believe, I've given so much energy trying to place the blame around, This time it rests on me for letting my guard down. I should have known, All along, You were one, Of the wolves at my door, Now we're back again at this same old place, I'm just trying to recognize your face, I can't let you in now, That's how it all happens in the first place. I should have known all along, I let you string me along, I was just to stupid to realize, I let myself be compromised.
