I couldn't tell you what I was thinking, god only knows. You've got me stumbling over myself feeling so low. Don't tell me about love, you only love yourself. You're a liar. You're a liar. I slept in deathbeds, Felt so disconnected, you've got me running on empty. You gave me that look that makes me feel like a lesser man. I couldn't feel your face hit the back of my hand. Don't tell me about love, you only love yourself. You're a liar. You're a liar. Your wrong, I'm right. You just can't see the truth, Your built on lies, Dry your eyes its only a bruise.
