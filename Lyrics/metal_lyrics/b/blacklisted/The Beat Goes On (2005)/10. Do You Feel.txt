I hope the pain opens up your eyes, Cause what you can't see you can't feel, It's time to put aside our difference, It's time to heal, You've gotta open up your eyes and see things clear, Do you feel, Do you feel it, Do you understand now, Do you feel it coming down, Your tears begin falling, Falling just like rain, Can you feel it now, The pain is here, Its time to heal.
