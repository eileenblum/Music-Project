Those traditions, Those ambitions they are yours, They are not mine, I don't have any visions, And I can't tell you my position, I'm not trying to reach the sun And I'm not shooting for the moon, I guess I'm just my mothers son, I gotta do what I gotta do, This life your living, Everything that your giving, These are all things you choose to do, I'm not trying to be just anyone, I'm trying to put my life in tune, I guess I'm just my fathers son, Willing to lose what I gotta lose.
