He hides his thoughts buried so deep inside, In the very back of his mind, Everything he can't let others know and prays that no one finds, He has reasons for everything, In his mind its all justified, Always so easily embrace, The mirror is just two faced, It hurt sometimes but he liked the taste, Didn't want to hurt anyone, So he looked to the blind one above, He'll need answers in time, For now he'll just stand tongue tied, What, What he feels, It hurts, And it kills, His mind, Stays concealed, His thoughts, Stay unrevealed.
