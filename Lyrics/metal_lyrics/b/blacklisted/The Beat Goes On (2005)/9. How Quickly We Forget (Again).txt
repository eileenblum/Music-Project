They're all coming back again, The same faces that turned they're backs are now letting me back in, How quickly the tides change, How quickly they remember my name, Did they think I'd sit around waiting for them to stand by my side, Did they think I'd sit around waiting for them to arrive, They're all leaving again, The same faces that came back are now walking away, How quickly the tides change, How quickly they forgot my name, It's all water under a bridge now anyway, How quickly we forget.
