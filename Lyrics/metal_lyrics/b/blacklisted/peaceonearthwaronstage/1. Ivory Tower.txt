I see no new day rising, I've been living in darkness for so long, the storm marches through the horizon, coming to take me on.
Isolation has clipped my wings there's no way out of this cold, I need you to come close.
There's some warmth in the way that the distance grows.
I find shelter, no security, no calm before the storm.
Staring at the sun has never, never, never, never kept me warm.
No shelter...
