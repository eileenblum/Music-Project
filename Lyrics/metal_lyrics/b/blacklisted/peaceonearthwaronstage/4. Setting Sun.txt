Your lifeless eyes scream your desire, as the crow flies, higher and higher.
Letting you know there's nowhere to go, feet bound to the ground in your black tar empire.
Whatever you're chasing please leave it alone, it's something you're never finding.
Everyone but you seems to know you cause you're so busy flying.
I know your sick so sick, sick down to your bones, I've never seen a mothers love die before, so I just let it all go.
How could you let your life be stolen, a shell of yourself left out in the open.
You're no setting sun, you're no setting sun, please don't pretend to be one...
