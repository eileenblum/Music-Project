Finally you are dead!
No way back
Remember your life
From childhood to old age
Life is short
Life isn't fair
Resistance is futile
Life is a waste of time.
Yes
Wasting time
Let it burn away...

***

Fear of living on
So kill your goals
And kill your mind
And kill your life
I hope you don't understand
