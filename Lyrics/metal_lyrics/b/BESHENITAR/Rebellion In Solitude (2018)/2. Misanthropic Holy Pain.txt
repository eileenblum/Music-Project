Now look at you. What happened?
Yes. Dark time
It was dark time
Eyes as dark as night
I used to see a dark shadow. Life is humiliation
Life is hopelessness
I'm coming to an end
There is only one way...
Misanthropic holy pain

The end is near
I've seen myself falling
Running through the jungle, screaming and crying
Call your fate
And say say say!
Motherfucker is coming
Say say say!
I'm ready for the pain

Call your fate
And say
Motherfucker is coming
Say!
I'm ready for the pain
