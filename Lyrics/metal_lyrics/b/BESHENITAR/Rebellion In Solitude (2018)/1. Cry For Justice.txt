Flame up to burn seven seas
Get up and fly into my every segment
Larynx sing this burning melody
Larynx burn with flame this chronic enemy
Larynx restrain
Flame up and burn 'til morrow
Fill up and get rid of this cage
Larynx restrain in the time of in justice
There's no any freedom
My homeland was destroyed
There's no any life
This is not the world
Today news is pain and sorrow
Today news is end of life
Today news is lie and deceit and hypocrisy

*****

Shame on me
Why am I alive?
Shame on me ?
Why am I here?
Shame on me
Damn
Why am I alive?
Shame on me
Why am I here?
Shame
