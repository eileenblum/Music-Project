Life, basis of patterns and scenes repetition
Life, basis of money and lust
Life, basis of killing and slaughter
Life, a new known pain
Lie, poverty and misery and blasphemy
Seeds of pain has been produced
Are pointing at me
And why are the pointing at me?
A moment on the thought of essence of me

One of the more bitter and sweet
There is no return to the past
And I am drowned in pastâs grief
Seeds of pain, are being shaping
Seeds of pain
Life, basis of patterns and scenes repetition
Why?

Past delusions and now this earth
Steps to extend the injustice on earth
Modernity was crushed under my feet
Modernity was crushed under my feet
Modernity was crushed under my feet
