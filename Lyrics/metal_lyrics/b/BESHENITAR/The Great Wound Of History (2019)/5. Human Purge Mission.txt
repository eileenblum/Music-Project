Alarm!
A dirty and unwilling birth
Satanic kids, yesterday's product
Satanic hug, bon appetite
Dirty and beautiful deceit
Small bloodthirsty innocent smile
A moment of foresight
Dirty eyes looking for joy
Showing mercy is impossible
Destructor of tomorrow's hope
Escape from an untrue and short chastity
Time belongs to me
Because is the repetition of this words
In the search of human purge mission
Human purge mission

A needle droop in the heart
That this needle
Has the revealer of vanishing thoughts
And meaning giver to death in life
Yeah
Yeah

Thirsty for vengeance
Empowered the cells
To the broadness of fury in me
Fell for rebelling against orders

I will destroy you
I will destroy you
I will destroy you
This is my right
Hatred hatred hatred of short chastity
Destroy you!
