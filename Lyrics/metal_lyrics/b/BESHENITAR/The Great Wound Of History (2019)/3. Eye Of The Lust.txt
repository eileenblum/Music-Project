I saw the life to loss
I called the depth of misery
I satisfied solitude
I separated myself from society
I separated darkness from light
My soul has words
Full of pain and wishes to fuck
Has dreadful thirst and eager for vengeance

Has a flame between the enemies
Yells as if wishes to curse
My soul has words
Messenger of dirt and impurity
Messenger of sickly life
Social corruption's reflector
Eye of the lust
Eye of the lust
Eye of the lust

Now
My eye of lust was brighten
A razor was hit to the hopefulness' fiber
Living was taken away from me
Sandglass of death hasn't broken
And my grave still countdown
To give meaning to the end
To give meaning to the end
To give meaning to the end
Eye of the lust
Eye of the lust
