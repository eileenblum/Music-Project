I had a flag in my hand
Chosen to the color of black
Beside of a green river
With the shadow of bright moon
In the darkness of night
I just heard the whisper of the river
I passed the night
I ignited a fire
On a sad winter night
Fire flames was awake 'til morning with me
I wish I stayed longer in this solitude
A fleeing out of human being

There is no hope
There is no hope
Search of death
There is no hope
There is no hope
Death in life
There is no hope
There is no hope
Living death
There is no hope
Full of sorrow
There is no hope
Fuck the life
There is no hope
There is no hope

Now
Living death
Drew the flood of tears in my psyche
An ambiguous fate
A year full of sorrow and grief and hopelessness
My soul and spirit in the search of death
Except to the year of my gradual death in this life
And still waiting
And still waiting

There is no hope
There is no hope
Search of death
There is no hope
There is no hope
Death in life
There is no hope
There is no hope
Living death
There is no hope
Full of sorrow
There is no hope
Fuck the life
There is no hope
There is no hope
