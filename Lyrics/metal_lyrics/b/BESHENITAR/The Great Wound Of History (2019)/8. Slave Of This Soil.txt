Sun will fall forever
And you will be always fall
And my slavery in this soil
Neglecting of each shameful phenomena of life
And at the end, an endless and limitless sleep

Life, shout
Soil's death sentence
Slave of this soil
Sunrise of darkness
All in the wind

A body weary of days
On the darker spots, insist
To the solitude more insist
A wrath full of pain

And you are not important
And you are slave
You are slave
You are slave
You are slave
