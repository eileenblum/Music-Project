No power in flesh

Soul, has idleness as his companion

Black day repetition of moment

Disgusted by all success

My hopefulness for a tear drop on my coffin

Effort on the way of gaining an absurd wealth

Captivity in the way of permanent justice

I've dig my grave by my own hand
I've dig my grave by my own hand
