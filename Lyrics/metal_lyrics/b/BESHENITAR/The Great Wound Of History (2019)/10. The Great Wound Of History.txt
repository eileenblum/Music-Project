And the obscure history was turned over
I feel the sting of book's content
Resistance, hard and absurd
I was bereaved of a lifetime slavery in the history
Actor sovereignty

Dreams gone with the wind
In the suffocation and chains
A plan for tampering freedom's history
Creator of the great wound of history
Duality of politics crushed me
The real truth was destroyed
A truth full of lies, appeared
Given up the ghost in the lethal life
With the end of the finishing of this choice
This is ignorance over reason
Predominated to the idiocy
The world has no justice
A country of peaceful thieves
Robber of my right

All are sacrificed by deceit and fraud
Under the name of complicated laws
Human's downfall with slaughter machine
Slaughter machine

This breaths is weird, has no fear of anything
Release the arrows to me
Destroy my body
Destroy my body
