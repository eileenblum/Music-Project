My soulless body in life's swamp
A moment of thought
Thunderstruck of past
Cold flesh
Life worse than yesterday
No loophole
Aims was destroyed

Return to the chains
No hope again
Filthy executioners were hoping
A window was opened
The sign of claws of death was appeared
My last breath began!
My body was destroyed
And finally my black spot was found
