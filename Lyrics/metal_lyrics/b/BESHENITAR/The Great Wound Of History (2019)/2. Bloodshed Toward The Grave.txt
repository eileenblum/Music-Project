Morale of lawlessness in me
Destructor of every beauty
Rolling in fire and blood
Has shadowed under oppression
Fear of dirty politics
Everyone in idiocy and stupidity
Everyone in grace of endless pain
Closed tongues in suffocation
Here it is the endless tortures
I crushed the laws under my feet
It's hard to tolerate it
Some dull men governing in society
Again asking for avenge
They themselves are bloodthirsty and unaware
That their blood will flow
Flags moistened by blood, is drawing our dirty future

Dirty future
Old cows in time passage
I feel their dirty plans beside me
I feel the smell of past fire
Heat and warmth of a hot torture
Draws birth of a social crisis

Creator of clean lawlessness
Hit and kill and eat and destroy me
And this is which keep me satisfied
A grave and a flesh and little blood
This my flesh was named:
bloodshed toward the grave
bloodshed toward the grave

Shields has broken
Resistances futile
So I gave up
So I gave up
So I gave up
