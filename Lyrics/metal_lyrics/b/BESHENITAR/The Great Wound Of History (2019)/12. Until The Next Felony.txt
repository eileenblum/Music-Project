A creature named sovereign
Having on hands, the bell of death
Chains got tired now
A barrier in line with procreation
Growth of perceptions of modernity
Denies dreams of eternity
New words on next felony
Time and place has been destroyed
New words on next felony
Sticking of this sentence
A complaint of argument of procreation

In vulgarism and contempt
In agony and hardship
Sovereign's promises: my genital's hair
Ignorance position of this territory
Ask for my eternal death of this territory
Ignorance disease of people
A creature named sovereign
Reign with deceit and hypocrisy
Genocide by wild murderers
A creature named sovereign
Now
Beginning of way of this idleness
Alas to this dishonor
Alas to this dishonor
Fuck
