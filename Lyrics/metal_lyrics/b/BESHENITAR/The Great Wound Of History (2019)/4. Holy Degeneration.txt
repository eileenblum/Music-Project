Endless game
Unending competition
Banishing me from the life
I broke my promises
My reason decided
The ugliness and the goodness
My inside hatred's storm
Gave meaning to life's pain
Changed up my thought
Freed my from captivity
Forgot the social
Chose the isolation
Gave meaning to pain
Gave meaning to pain
Holy degeneration
Holy degeneration

I named life as holy degeneration
I fucked life hard
I called people my enemy
I propelled the young and the old
I named each as money
With a ruined destiny
I erased my belief
What is the real belief?
Belief in oneself
Captivity in life
Fuckin' life has sent me eternal curse
I sting myself
And I enjoy the pain
And draw the smile of carnivorous worm in my grave.
Worm in my grave
Worm in my grave
Worm in my grave
Worm in my grave
Worm in my grave
I enjoy the fall
I enjoy the fall
Holy degeneration
