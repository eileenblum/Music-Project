Dreamy thought, full of sensation in me
A personal movement
Again cemetery
In the darkness of night
A journey to the known cemetery
Digging grave in the known cemetery

Bones extracted out of soil
Bones made of past pain
Bones made of rue and grief
Bones made of liberty taste

A part of that, I put in my mouth
A delightful taste
Invite me to silence
Expecting for a strange event
Silence prevailed over me

Bones extracted out of soil
Bones made of past pain
Bones made of rue and grief
Bones made of liberty taste

Here
I feel the joy
A life in this darkness
Constant silent
With death
