And when we all die the legacy we leave behind will scar the face of the planet for eternity
The contagion festers in the dreams of us all
And when night falls we become the nightmare

Spilling words from their infected tongues they orchestrate
The blueprint of corruption in the modern age
Spilling words from their infected tongues they will craft
An idol in their image for the rest to gaze upon

The lies that they told will slowly become moral flaws
Moulding misdirection of a malleable misconception [2x]

Serpents of disorder
They will impregnate the system guilty of miscarrying justice
The contagion festers in the dreams of us all
And when night falls we become the nightmare

Sold just like slaves to a master race
By those who claim to be our one and only savior
We were a scapegoat

Cursed filth delivered from the mouth of God [2x]

And when we all die the legacy we leave behind will scar the face of the planet for eternity
The contagion festers in the dreams of us all
And when night falls we become the nightmare

And when we all die there is no God to hear our cries
He gave up on this shit and left us on this world to rot
Our lives are lived in exile
Our future lies in dirt
Six feet under lay our fragile shells entombed by Earth

Separate the skin that conjoins the twins
Church and state are one
As life falls apart
Suffocate the truth
Their lies are a tool
Used to manipulate and intimidate
People that are just like me
