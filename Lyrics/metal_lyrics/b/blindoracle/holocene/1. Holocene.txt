I will transcend beyond horrors of this world to fabricate this species' reckoning

We become the face of a new extinction breathed in by man
Our insecurities will crumble this society
We become the face of a new extinction
This world is fucked and its blood is on our hands
Justifying genocide

The surface will be erased, and all life will be choked
The blackened Earth will now serve as nothing more than dust
A new host for our race must be found before we all decay
The sun will begin to dissolve the layers of our flesh

This pathogen we call life will continue to thrive, despite unstable climates
We will adapt to survive in this atmosphere

Genocide of reason will lead to extinction
Our dominion has ended, behold the fall of man

Nothing to lose, no friends or family
All my fucking life I've been seeking death's serenity
I'll never know peace until my eyes close finally

All my fucking life I've never known peace
I will return to inflict my torment
