Come inside this hole called life 
Follow the rabbit 

Dressed in white
Take every word he says for sure 
Don' t ask why 

Nevermore 
Kill the raven on the door 
And let his blood spill on the floor

Then wash yourself in the remaining flood
And scream as long as your mouth reacts

Do you hear the people sing
Sing 

Sing
It is the music of 
The people who will 
Not be fucked again

Come inside and free your mind 
The tub is filled with the liquid of life 

Just wash yourself in the restraining flood
And scream as long as your head reacts

Do you hear the people sing
Sing 

Sing
It is the music of 
The people who will 
Not be fucked again

This is the core of your mind which is fragile 
This is the pain in your brain that steals you everything [2x]
