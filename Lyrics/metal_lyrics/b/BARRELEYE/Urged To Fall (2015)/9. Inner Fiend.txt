It's on can you feel the itching
Come closer 'cause I changed who I'd been
This time we'll replace the hatred 
With everythin' inside of our hands

I will crucify them all 
Priests will pray to avoid the fall
Bleed myself out on the floor
To cure the disease that rottens our hearts

I can't live this reckless life 
I tried so many fuckin' times
Can't reach my own soul inside
Try to grab the days I tried 

I break because of the weight of the world [2x]

What is it for? Why do we even get up? 
The world shouldn't be our fuckin playground

I never will be part of this shit
'Cause I have a gun
I have a gun inside of my 

I'd been come so far without some pain 
My hands reached for the golden grain 
I live in a castle inside of my brain
Let everything burn and I hope to see you again

What is it for? Why do we even get up? 
The world shouldn't be our fuckin' playground

I never will be part of this shit
'Cause I have a gun
I have a gun inside of my 

Not much left 
Not much to say 
When we're done 
Even the sinners start to pray

Time to start to pray [3x]

My vision fainted just tonight 
I tear the lids off my eyes 
To see through my own disguise
To forget how much it hurts inside

I never will be part of this shit
'Cause I have a gun
I have a gun inside of my fist
