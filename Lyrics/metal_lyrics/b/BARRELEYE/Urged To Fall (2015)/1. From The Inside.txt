Empty walls
In empty halls
Darkness crawls
Eater of sins

The cold wet stone
Cruel intentions within
Is leading where
The dead heart beats

The fear's the only fuckin' thing that's real
It's everything
Dead eyes won't disappear 
In this black cave

Time won't pass by
'Cause life has faded to black
Instead of 
Spending warmth it's 
Burning holes into grey heads
Breaking bones of innocents 
Like the curse of rotten flesh it lies its breed
So clocks can sleep

Empty frames 
Mirrors of trust
Deformed men 
Object of lust
The simple things 
Are meaningless
'Cause wielded steel 
Is forcing to confess

The fear's the only fuckin' thing that's real
It's everything
Dead eyes won't disappear 
In this black cave

Time won't pass by
'Cause life has faded to black
Instead of 
Spending warmth it's 
Burning holes into grey heads
Breaking bones of innocents 
Like the curse of rotten flesh it lies its breed
So clocks can sleep
