I can' t write a song that' s good enough 

To make the blue skies grey
Enough to make the sinners pray
Enough for minds to concentrate 
Enough for hearts to beat the same

This is the weakness holding me
Back from things to say
I always hesitate
There' ll be war

I won't regret
Streets will be red 
There is only one thing we can do 

Save the world by suicide
Givin' it the chance to bring the fight
Together as we unite 
We can save the world by suicide

I want to be the voice of those 
Who can' t use it inside the court 
I' ll make a chain out of tongues and bones 
Torn out of the liars' throats

I' ll be covered with the guts 
Of self-destructive bots
Forced to go their way 
Paved with ignorance

I can' t regret
Streets will be red 
There is only one thing we can do 

Save the world by suicide
Givin' it the chance to bring the fight
Together as we unite 
We can save the world by suicide
