Innocent I never was
But I feel never guilty
Lose my faith from time to time
Nothing can harm me
I just go out in disguise
Been the biggest fan of mine
Can't read any word I write
Just wanna get inside
I can never change it
I can only face it 
This is my only curse
That I
Want to wear your skin every motherfucking day

I see all I know is fake
Every word I say 
Is wrong my head can't handle it 
Just can't handle it
I know all I see is rain
Your blood all over me
Tonight I tear the guts out of your body

I can feel your heartbeat
As my hand is starting to squeeze
First I have to breathe in
Then it's time to begin
Your lungs come out easily as I cut them piece for piece
I have to puke because it stinks 
As I throw all your shit into the garbage bin

I see all I know is fake
Every word I say 
Is wrong my head can't handle it 
Just can't handle it
I know all I see is rain
Your blood all over me
Tonight I tear the guts out of your body

I told you
I hate to be me
The only 
Way to be free
Is to be you
To own your body 
To wear you 
Only not to be 
Me
