This is my last will â my testament 
Cause I ran out of arguments 
To live this life alone
To keep this place called home

I never wanted to be this one man 
To save this place â save everything
It's coming down to this moment
It's just a thought â it's in his head
He's the leader of your land
You gave him everything just to waste
It all â just to break every piece
Do we really want to owe our lives to them 
It's genocide â of a thousand minds
Do we keep loosing everything that once was ours?
This genocide â will cleanse our life
Ask yourself a question now
Is it okay to crawl?
Break the peace they want you to know
'Cause this is war! 

In our hearts there lies a pain 
To break it all â a goal to gain
We rape ourselves to ease the fray
In our heads â with everything

Do we have â what it takes to make a change?
Is it all illusion?
Are we afraid â to see what lies ahead
We look into the void

Do we really want to owe our lives to this?
It's genocide â of a million minds
Do we keep loosing every piece that once was ours?
This genocide erases our minds

It's like a cigarette
You try to take a drag of 
You feel the smoke in your lungs
But not the cancer that had grown

This cancer grows [3x]

Do we really dedicate our lives to this?
This genocide â of a billion minds
Will this seed we'd planted finally arise?
This genocide â will end your life

Is this black ulcer everything we can call ours?
We press our claws â into our minds

Into our minds.
