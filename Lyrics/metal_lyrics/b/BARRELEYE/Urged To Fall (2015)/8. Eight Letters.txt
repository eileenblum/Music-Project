Point of no return
We reached it and we crashed right through
We're old and wasted
Let's make this life feel brand new

From now on we're strangers
I throw you and your heart away

Time to go on
We'd come this far and can't give up
I want to feel you 
But my mind still fucks me hard

Please be quiet and don't disturb me
I'm inside of my hole and I dig 
Don't you try to come and save me 
When I try to shoot myself to quit 

I adore you
With all my mistakes
You gave me the strength to breathe again
There are only 8 letters to be said 
But life's strange 
And so am I

Don't walk away 
Without you I won't make it through 
Give me the time 
To show you what I feel for you

From now on I'll love you
I throw my heart to your feet

Please be quiet and don't disturb me
I'm inside of my hole and I dig 
Don't you try to come and save me 
When I try to shoot myself to quit 

I lay down besides you
I try to clean my head
I know that your not near me
And I still regret

That I was not
The one I want to be
That I was not 
There when you're in need
And I am
The pain that won't get eased
Cause I am 
Dead inside of me

I adore you
With all my mistakes
You gave me the strength to breathe again
There are only 8 letters to be said
But life's strange and 
So am I
And so are we
