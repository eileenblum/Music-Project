Welcome to your lonely life 
Where money burns you down to size 
No shrink no friends they're only lies 
The hands you reached for flew away

I've got 
Beaten 
Almost 
To death

My wounds got ripped apart
There's blood everywhere
All of my old scars
Are showing me its time to crawl

The cold is coming and with it all its friends
And its introducing you to the sweet 
Anger depression and hate
Don't try to get away cause you are damned
'Cause we'd all been thrown into this 
Big shiny shit-pile called our life

You can try to run away
'Cause you know there's not much left to stay
It'll make you feel the pain you pray
But to fail here is the only way

You'd just fall on your face 
Thinkin' it will ease
The pain inside your head 
Letting you know its real

The cold is coming and with it all its friends
And its introducing you to the sweet 
Anger depression and hate
Don't try to get away cause you are damned
'Cause we'd all been thrown into this 
Big shiny shit-pile called our life
