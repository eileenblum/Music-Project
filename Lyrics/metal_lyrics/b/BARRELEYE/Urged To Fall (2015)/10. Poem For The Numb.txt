I am the voice in your head leading you
I am the thing in your hand thrilling you
You are the heart that won't beat without fuel
And you are the fear of a loss breaking you 

It all began so long ago 
Our cruelty gets out of hand

I cut their throats burn their homes
Take their lives
I do it all 'cause I can
But its not right

It all began so long ago 
My sane mind is no longer home

The world won't see the pain that's inside a thousand tortured lives
'Cause all we ever care about is to don't look fucked tonight

I am numb and I sing a poem to the deaf [2x] 

We are the curse of the world me and you
We still ignore and won't change anything

The world wont see the pain that's inside a thousand tortured lives
'Cause all we ever cared about was to don't look fucked tonight

You can live your life like that when your head is filled with shit
But I will choose the easy way so I tell you I quit...
