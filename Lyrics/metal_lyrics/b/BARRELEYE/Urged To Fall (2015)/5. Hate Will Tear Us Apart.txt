This can't be freedom 
When I feel so unkind
And there is no reason
For you to be the night
So deep dark and faded to
Black... thick... red...
And me to be the bright 
Day... make... believe...
That everything will be okay

But I don't wanna feel what you'd felt 
There's no tattoo of worn shoes 
I offer you my head and my heart
I will wait here till hate will tear us apart

My thoughts will be the only thing that's left of me
Your heart will be the only thing I need

I call it freedom when I dance on my scars
And you call it hatred when I call you a retard
I've givin' my whole fuckin' life for you
My whole motherfuckin' life for you
And you were worth it all the time

But I don't wanna feel what you'd felt 
There's no tattoo of worn shoes 
I offer you my head and my heart
I will wait here till hate will tear us apart

My thoughts will be the only thing that's left of me
Your heart will be the only thing I need

You asked me lately
How I want it to be
I told you quietly 
"Just leave me"
This hard honesty
Came too close to me
My mouth's a cave 
And I'll crawl into it

My thoughts will be the only thing that's left of me
Your heart will be the only thing I need
