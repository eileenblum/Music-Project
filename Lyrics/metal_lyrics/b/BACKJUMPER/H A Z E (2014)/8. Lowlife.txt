Behind
those fuckin screens
you're all so tough, you're all so mean
you're spitting shit
on the ones who believe
just because your life didn't brought you anything

Living lowlife
Like a rat will bring you pain and disease
your daily dose of hatred feeds your overdose
is getting worse now, it gets so close

Failure
Nobody's scarred for free
you coward, to the bone
You'll be dead if keep living through me

Lowlife ain't gonna change
Yeah you'll die with nothing at all

your filth
has built the walls of your room
punk ass bastard

Filled up
with anxiety
But that's your fault, don't stare at me
So sad for you
for the fucks I don't give
just because I'm scarred but not broken

Junk head fakin'
keyboard wankin'
Like a rat will bring you pain and disease
your daily dose of hatred feeds your overdose
is getting worse now, it gets so close

Failure
Nobody's scarred for free
you coward, to the bone
You'll be dead if keep living through me

Lowlife ain't gonna change
yeah, you'll die with nothing at all

your filth
has built the walls of your room
punk ass bastard

Your image of me, it's what defines you
You wretched
You frustrated
the only thing you can do is hate

Still eagerly await for your days to end
No need to mend
all the curses you sent to me
the only thing you can do is envy
so frustrated
so low, and lower

I am counting down the days
And I don't need to mend, no need to mend
'cause your presence is worthless

And I am keeping up the place
And I don't need revenge, don't need revenge
'cause you ain't gonna change
