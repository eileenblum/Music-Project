I've heard about brain drain,
unemployment and inflation
But I define all this with the word brainwashing
While we struggle to seize the day
corruption feeds our stomach
They fuck with our lives again

black youth, burning fast
is burning fast in flames
This world is becoming the Hall of Shame
the Hall of Shame

If there's a line
I've heard thousand times
It's "Vote for me
and we'll change the world"
The only thing I vote for
is your exctincion
We all met in the end, same floor, same dust my friend

black youth, burning fast
is burning fast in flames
This world is becoming the Hall of Shame
the Hall of Shame

There's no real need to say
"we are building the future"
like the graves we are digging ourselves, right now

And you'll have the picture
of what we became
through what can't we see
and what we can't we blame

It's sold on screens
Turn it up, bleed for me
Mind out there, for the collision

That's the set up coming down
Welcome to falsehood.
That's the set up coming down

They fuck with our lives again

black youth, burning fast
is burning fast in flames
This world is becoming the Hall of Shame
the Hall of Shame

There's no real need to say
"we are building the future"
like the graves we are digging ourselves, right now

And you'll have the picture
of what we became
through what can't we see
and what we can't we blame
what can't we see
and what we can't we blame
