I won't stand on my own
I won't be a detached beholder
I won't be another puppet in their hands
I won't be another death concealed as tragedy
I stand on my guts, with two feet, and my own mind
I starve with my pride, but I'll feed it with hate

Paved with strenght, Built with consciousness
Marked by deception and Fueled by revenge

Selfishness is their lifeblood
Hungry for fame, Infamous cowards
like snakes, their venom is deadly
But more fatal are their proclamations

It's all going to the wrong side, man!
This threat's real
What I see, I truly can't forget 

Perfect Patethical Picture of this world

It's all going to the wrong side
going to the right side of them
It's all going to the wrong side man
the wrong side
the wrong side

They want me to quit, but I Keep up the pace

This threat's real
What I see, I truly can't forget

Paved with strenght, Built with consciousness
Marked by deception and Fueled by revenge
