Outsiders
like waves back to the shore
like a child left alone in this world
They got no heroes there
They got no heroes there

Realize the worst is you
the worst is still yet to come and reveal
You got to set it free
You got to set it free

This is no place for us
This is no place for the hopeless romantics
From the bottom of earth
This is no place
for those who seek understanding

Like waves back to the shore
like a child left alone in this world
They got no heroes there
They got no heroes there

Realize the worst is you
the worst is still yet to come and reveal
You got to set it free
You got to set it free

This is no place for us
This is no place for the hopeless romantics
From the bottom of earth
This is no place
for those who seek understanding

My enemies right in front of me
Armed with lies and hypocrisy
Awaiting me to do the first move
the first move to the grave

The whispers
in my head
They don't whisper anymore
they all fuckin scream

When breathing doesn't mean living
The first move to the grave
When breathing doesn't mean living
The first move to the grave

Said and done
not afraid if the fact leaves its ghost
but you're still there waiting me to do

The first move, the first move, the first move

cover up and settle down
Holding over our bid farewell now
that one day will come
to release all the consequences
