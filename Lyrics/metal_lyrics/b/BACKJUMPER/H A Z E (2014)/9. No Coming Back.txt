It's all about the blood
The passion and no tears
that's how it was
Crowd surfing, real poems and sing-a-longs

that's clearly how it's supposed to be
Before the show went flat
Before the fashion took over

Our target is to bring it back
to the streets
Where the heart's not gone
Where reality stands strong

Nothing can touch us now
if we all, get along
United we stand, Divided we fall

There's no coming back
We still settle for nothing
Come on come on
There's no coming back
We bring the noise in

Something happened
and it's quite simple how
Sellouts created
discomfort in the crowd

They sold out the realness
of the glory days
salad days
like someone always used to say

A Black flag showed us
how to roll
How to unshape
the punk that was
supposed to come

while someone in the waiting room
doing by self what he had to do
In the underground
integrity lies within

There's no coming back
We still settle for nothing
Come on come on
There's no coming back
We bring the noise in

Every single track burns
And every single trace is near
Every single track burns

And every single trace is near
Every single track burns

We will not be so far
our message stands clear
take a deep breath
guide your wrath
channel it

Every single track burns
And every single trace is near
Every single track burns

I'm not gonna move
Cause I'm here to stay
and share my thoughts
for the ones in need
for the ones about to be broken
with arms open wide

When hope is nowhere to be found
Try to find the strenght to keep the lights on
For every heartache
for every single wound
This saves from getting lost
When you're laying down
When your temper touches the ground
get in, get sedated
spirit's not gone, not faded

flow it into the aftermath
cut back the deadwood
sail back from the flood
till air fills my lungs
Until I will have a word to say
I choose not to disappear
When hope is nowhere to be found
Try to find the strenght to keep the lights on
For every heartache
for every single wound
This saves from getting lost
When you're laying down
When your temper touches the ground
get in, get sedated
spirit's not gone, not faded.
