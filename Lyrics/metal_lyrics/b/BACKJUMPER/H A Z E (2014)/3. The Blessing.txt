My lifetime commitment
our lives united by the same pledge
lot of stories left behind
lot of roads coming straight ahead
and there is nothing wrong about it
to know from where we came from
we chose this life years ago
we chose to reap what we sow

we chose to fulfill our destiny
through the same honest bet
living a life with no regret
trying to forgive but not to forget
this is what we've always been
this is why we're still here

we're cast, miles away, but we still remember everything
We're a million miles away, but we still got the blessing

We're drifters, with no land to reach
all is clear, none to believe
Our whole lives are becoming our efforts
trying to keep real forever
trying to keep it fucking real forever
is slowly becoming our hymn
our will to survive never fades
never to be afraid

we chose to fulfill our destiny
through the same honest bet
living a life with no regret
trying to forgive but not to forget
this is what we've always been
this is why we're still here

we're cast, miles away, but we still remember everything
We're a million miles away, but we still got the blessing

I'm constantly spilling my guts on a piece of paper
letting the world to know how I feel
Bruises not hided, words screamed it, out loud
This is my life, my will, My devotion
Try to deny us now

We're not going to stop this
No matter what you've been through
and now whatever will come, will come for us
Look out,
we are going to keep with us this momentum
it's on and on and on
it brings us to the next chapter, till it's written down
this time next time and time again

I'm constantly spilling my guts on a piece of paper
letting the world to know how I feel
Bruises not hided, words screamed it, out loud
This is my life, my will, My devotion
Try to deny us now
