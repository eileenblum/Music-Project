Searching for a meaning
lasting a lifetime, wasting nights
without taking care
of what it could have been

Actions have no sense but there were consequences
Nothing was truly clear and unaffected
Until I realized

Until I truly crossed
the Day I Died
It is painted through my synapses
I stole your life to give
a meaning to mine

Watch me from a different perspective
just like everybody else's ever done
Brother, put your defenses down
The blessing for that day
the king has lost the crown

Under the stars, I see no light for me
I'm choking on life
and the reflection of my eyes is blank
my breath is cold
We're floating away as we're getting old

One more day that could have pass
But it's never left behind
It seemed to go nowhere
just like everyday

But that voices inside my head
broke all the securities away
to live and regret
to love and forget
Still was not ready yet

I used all my chemicals to become unvulnerable
To behave on a path leading me to a huge void
that became my life, my actions and my integrity
Something happened inside of me changing me dreadfully
The acceptance of a new shadow
a shadow becoming my skin
I will never see you again
I will never see you again

Under the stars, I see no light for me
I'm choking on life
and the reflection of my eyes is blank
my breath is cold
We're floating away as we're getting old

Discomfort,
like pouring rain into a sunny day
Limbs outstretched
we're all consumed
but breathing entwined in oblivion
