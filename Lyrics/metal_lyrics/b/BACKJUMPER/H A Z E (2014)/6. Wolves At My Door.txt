Black days, chaos true,
bad nights step in this nightmare again
and there is nothing that we can do now
even though we can't accept this concept
of malice, hope and vengeance

It's a disease that we long to cure, invain
from those who decided euthanasia
before And now I'm cold
from the top of my head to the toes
feeling desperate will not help me, this time it won't help me

That's not your face always known
it's so easy to hide yourself behind a shield
that makes you feel so damn secure, no
meanwhile I'm fighting the demons sent to me
sent to me
you sent to me

And that there is nothing that we can do now
even though we can't accept this concept
of malice, hope and vengeance

but I've chosen the long road home
I decided to cut right through me
and i'm still beating my chest with my own knife
and once again
i can say that I'm feeling desperate

Head what it's left for me
As I keep on feeling empty
Head what it's left for me
As i feel empty
Nothing is left for me

Noone else around, a desert town
A big city of streets blinded by compromise
There is no - one left to hurt
when hurt's not a feeling anymore
with wolves angry at my door

That's not your face always known
it's so easy to hide yourself behind a shield
that makes you feel so damn secure, no
meanwhile I'm fighting the demons sent to me
sent to me
you sent to me

they're still knocking at my door
