Step up and smile if you ever wonder
gonna take a deep breath and you will step on this
my shadow doesn't reflect me anymore
I've burned the pact that lead me to it
You can't imagine what hides
the smile right on my face
it's just a taste of things to come
will not be any guiding lights on

Here it comes the day of another damn freedom, pull the trigger

Sail the black seas of uncertainty
when your days are still unnumbered and safe
the realm will come and knock at the door to set up your chemistry
causing the shipwreck of your old intentions
So drown
Keep decaying my joy the war in your heart will last forever
please don't let me down, your hand can't save me
It's just a taste of things to come
will not be any guiding lights on

Sometimes becomes everytime, everywhere becomes my home
if this is beginning, I hope it will end soon

So drown
Sometimes slightly becomes overtime
nowhere from everywhere becomes my home

Once again you're facing yourself
learning from the stories you've been told

I told you
I warned you not to waste your shots
gotta get a way, got to reload reload !!!
It will burn deep inside
inside the depths of my soul
the frailty of words
collapsing beneath the loss of control

Here it comes the day of another damn freedom, pull the trigger
becomes the day where you're just in the middle
everywhere you go, every time you fall, everything you know
every place you've been laid

Step up and smile if you ever wonder
gonna take a deep breath and you will step on this
step on this
you'll repent on this
coward
you'll finally step on this

Dissect your life as it goes deeper and deeper
one chapter of relief, has a whole story of letting down
It's a consequence
it's not a personal choice
it's a constriction
