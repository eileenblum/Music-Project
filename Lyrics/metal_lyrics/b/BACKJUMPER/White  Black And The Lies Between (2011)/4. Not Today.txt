A thought of you that often grows in my dreams
as years pass on I can't divide myself from what I've done
I should start everything all over again
just open my eyes and separate me from this

But the burden is framed within me, eternally
With the same consciousness
of what I decided to keep to go on
It's all I ever known
pouring my ink to fill it, my inner book
I got blank pages on

And going on is painful as looking back
understanding what I left someday somehow

Looking at the scars that still burns
how I wish it was all that easy
bringing solace deeply, how I wish I could
the rain keeps falling on these streets
As tears that cover my face with regret
that help retrieving the letters I can't forget
Motionless I pose
accepting the mobility of reason
it's a selfish prison

You know, I fall into the void of weakness

The reason why
they hold on saying (they say you learn everyday)
I rather say (that I don't feel like growing up today)

Still picking up the pieces
of times where I was down again
make them a part of myself
I'll rebuild me
While days are
standing still
I'm getting through them
I'll rebuild me
