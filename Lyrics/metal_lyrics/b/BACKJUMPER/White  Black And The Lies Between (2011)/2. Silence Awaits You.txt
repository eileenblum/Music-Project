Watch the weather it's changing, rearranging for you

Rain, the silence awaits you
the sky's turning now
empty grounds seeking through our day
Your heaven turned into ashes, it's in the palm of my hand
here comes the sorrow, the empty
to set your eyes to decline

Signs of fail, the sky's turning
and we'll always be down
just wait and see what happens to me
to blow this morning and drive it away

Now take a breath and climb these walls
of indecision
Two seconds left alone

Come and slide away if you can
above the end of this night
punching my skin too tight
away from you

Just free me now
Take this life, is filled of promises
I will try to reach the glory of mankind

Nothing to gain, it was decided
when you chosen to crave
the vain engraved in the back of my eyes
and i'm willing to wash it away

Now take a breath and climb these walls
of indecision
Two seconds left alone,
Until midnight

And I cannot seem to control life
digging in my hole
that's why I'm falling over you

Fade away from here
look me in the eyes
promise me
Your heaven is ending its life, it's cursed
broken and drown, before this dawn
your heaven is ending
it's our time
