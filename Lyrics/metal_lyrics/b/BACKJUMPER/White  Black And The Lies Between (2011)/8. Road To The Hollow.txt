I've heard your screams for way too long, there's no instructions
you fail me through your dirty words, rapture
create into greed, your hunger for mightiness
I've counted your second thoughts one more time again now
beware of the sign again, beware of the end
Don't try to make me another fucking outcast just like you
but the memory remains, this time I won't let them go
You're reaching slow at the edge of my patience
I'm gonna make you pay back this load of bullshit

I can't deny your sacred views
can't deny your made up tales but left are only a few
In this time of neglect you can bet I won't lack of attention
I cannot be so shy, I just can let you die
there's no wasted blood, reset this fucking world
recall the times that saw you and me together

That's road to the hollow, that's road to be alone
we won't miss you, when you're gone

I've heard you , stand off !

I've heard your screams for way too long, there's no instructions
you fail me through your dirty words,  this call becomes, a rapture
It's clear you're trying to make me another outcast just like you
but the memory remains, this time I won't let them go

I just found another way to die
I just found a matter
I just found another way to die
I just found another way too
I just found a way to make things right

Heal the fracture of the thousand wounds
so take me down and aim me back and fake me to you
be the witness of the buried faults
you're the victim of your own deception

You cannot last
You're the fracture of my thousand, thousand wounds
and there's only one way to sell back to you

Burn you down to the fucking ground and be a slave of your mistakes
burn you down, a new light is found, to point blank all over this bloodbath

There's no need for your saviour
