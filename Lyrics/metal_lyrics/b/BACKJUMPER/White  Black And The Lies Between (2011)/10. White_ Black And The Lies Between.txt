Don't you see, you're feeding me
that's the cause for you've been cursed
too late to care, it's my despair
I can't see brighter
through the eyes deceased, the more you bleed I
let you, my deadly cure
between the oppose, you'll not get close
to realize I'm dying inside

Now I lay between the death and love
now I lay descending from above
Come back to me, the thoughts of what I'll never mean to be
come back
forgive the hopeless reveal the worthless of your smile, a break

Straight to me endlessly
no replace for the mind absence
throughout the time the subtle crime
I regret everything
To deliberate these thoughts I hate
the thoughts I feel feeling for real
you're going down through what I found
another time I'm dying inside

Come back to me, the thoughts of what I'll never mean to be
come back
forgive the hopeless reveal the worthless of your smile, a breakdown
that fades inside of me, fades inside of me
confide the emptiness in your eyes, a breakdown

You see it's all been made for you
it's made for you

Love blood, cursed things
will we ever know what those means
life death, uncontrolled things
WHITE BLACK AND THE LIES BETWEEN
nothing else but
life death, uncontrolled things
WHITE BLACK AND THE LIES BETWEEN
nothing, nothing else
