you're stuck between  these walls
so deadly chained to this motherfuckin order
the border it's still redefining all

get closed within this room
so realiza that everything is wrong
and wait for you

tired to held the weight of the world
there's need to confidence through resistance
time to rise (NOW)
struggle 'n fight (THIS)

to get in our graves and cease to move

you know the time does not cease to move
don't cease to move
the time make the system move
the things you use to..

try to leave
what i see (NO MORE)
the enemy within me
stabbed in the back and fall, yeah

STABBED BACK

hit the target and then it's gone
the resolution you wait i'll never come
down to no one
too soon
to get in our graves and cease to move

you know the time does not cease to move
don't cease to move
the time make the system move
the things you use to..

try to leave
what i see (NO MORE)
the enemy within me
stabbed in the back and fall
ain't gonna lie and forget this muthafuckin' law

destroying your faith and all that stands on my way
remember the time you've wasted

destroying your faith and all that stands ON MY WAY

TAKE IT DOWN
STOP SEEKING THROUGH ME

ALWAYS EXPANDING THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE WASTED
IMPOSSIBLE TO REACT
