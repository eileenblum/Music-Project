there were thousand of days
running out the border
thousand of days, thousand of days, aggression and disorder
to complete what's left on this side of mine
travelling down my madness of these times

everybody's now it's turning around

silently they sleep
outlasting

give me all the strenght i need to move on
to head all that i could understand

give back me something to believe in
till it turn into sand

CAN'T YOU SILENT MY HATRED
FROM THE GUILT ON YOUR SIDE

CAN'T YOU SILENT THE WAKE
OF THE ONE BORN FROM THE FIRE

take it away, save it, pull it to mind everyday
remember to clean up the mess in your fuckin'  head
to be perfect to who
laughs at you
lead on you
make use of you
lie to you
wear out
everything puts you through

set it, set it off

BROUGHT, COMPLETE AND FELT BY THE TRUTH YOU CAN'T HIDE !

there were thousand of days
running out the border
thousand of days, thousand of days, aggression and disorder
to complete what's left on this side of mine
travelling down my madness of these times

give me all the strenght i need to move on
to head all that i could understand

give back me something to believe in
till it turn into sand

CAN'T YOU SILENT MY HATRED
FROM THE GUILT ON YOUR SIDE

CAN'T YOU SILENT THE WAKE
OF THE ONE BORN FROM THE FIRE
