what the hell is this so called life?
i can't see behind
redefined in a scheme of thoughtless
in a state of mind

ideals to fall try to rule at all
to the blackened feeble kind
before the ruin, please
CUT ME UP ALIVE

yeah we're gonna take it back to this twisted world
remembering that there's always one choice you can make
there's always one way to escape
and our mighty god will show us the light

SHUT THE FUCK UP

RAGE! open up your eyes and see
YOUR CAGE! built up inside to lock my
FAITH! my Prison  got to be followed without a
REASON and take control upon us
ALL

It's the world you believed to be in
The same  nursery rhymes
from the day you born, till the day you're gone

Face you
Damn fool
I'll never be too

Fight you
to save you
From yourself

see and realize the fuckin' lies
you've been told since day one
filthy truthless behaviors
so don't get me close
to this view full of hypocrisy
of what am I supposed to be

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO BE IN?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAYIN'
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DIE FOR

It's the world you believe to be in
The same Nursery rhymes till
from the day you born, till the day you're gone

Face you
Damn fool
I'll never be too

Fight you
to save you
From yourself

TO SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELF

BORN
REALIZE
FOCUS ON
CUT ME UP ALIVE

RAGE! open up your eyes and see
YOUR CAGE! built up inside to lock my
FAITH! my Prison  got to be followed without a
REASON
