Something passed so fast infact
it just can't be brought back
just have to tolerate it
even if It fuckin' hurts
cuz it hurts so fuckin' much
in your flesh and in your thoughts
in those memories that's bleedings
from the martyr of a wasted LIFE 'n a wasted SOUL !

I'm - still
Seeking what I've lost in the secrets and the faults so closed
within that mind
abduction of the will
from something that's unclear
in the face of time
we manage to fill
all the emptiness inside
of unhappiness and thrill

ALLOW TO SAVE, ALLOW THIS CHAPTER TO BE SAVED
AND PASSED FOREVER
ALLOW TO SEE THE FINAL HOUR OF LIVE, YOU'VE JUST TURNED TO SIN, SALVATION DENIED

bottled up inside let me

get out from the chains
i've been locked for all this time
scars so goddamn deep
this revenge is what i seek
to complete this forced path
where's told that LIFE is equal to LOST
to control and preserve
the cursed feeding

ALLOW TO SAVE, ALLOW THIS CHAPTER TO BE SAVED
AND PASSED FOREVER
ALLOW TO SEE THE FINAL HOUR OF LIVE, YOU'VE JUST TURNED TO SIN, SALVATION DENIED

god had set the deadline today
I'ts over, my fate
god has SENT salvation to ME
beating me down tearing me down C'MON

PROVE ME I'M WRONG
I WEAR SCARS THAT PROVE
I WEAR SCARS THAT PROVE HOW
JUST PROVE ME I'M WRONG NOW

cuz it hurts so fuckin' much
in your flesh and in your thoughts
in those memories that's bleedings
from the martyr of a wasted soul

ALLOW TO SAVE, ALLOW THIS CHAPTER TO BE SAVED
AND PASSED FOREVER
ALLOW TO SEE THE FINAL HOUR OF LIVE, YOU'VE JUST TURNED TO SIN, SALVATION DENIED

god had set the deadline today
I'ts over, my fate

god has SENT salvation to ME
it's time to walk away

it's time to walk away
