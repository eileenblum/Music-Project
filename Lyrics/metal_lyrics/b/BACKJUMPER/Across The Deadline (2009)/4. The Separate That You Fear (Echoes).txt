GO!

slice the sickness to the core
slice the sickness to the core
slice the sickness
and face the privation anymore

priceless intentions to this calling, just let you know
I'm really fucked up fed up with you
and come here to
remember the shit that you whenever put us through
hey think at the shit that killed us
you fake the things that are so clear now
from the bottom of the unforgiven
to the blood that you won't be taken

Get away from me
in the while you trail the song
of your despair
the separate that you fear

You can break it
Can tear this motherfucker down let his face just crashing over 'n over

right in time to fall
to fall behind this going
to hear these echoes

rah

stop now to fill over the empty
so lost and silenty grinding
cause you know what you got of mine
under the predicted of loss'n'time [anticipa]

standing there for a victimless shock
hail to the thief that's sinking deep
the kings of the world are falling asleep
while those fuckers are bleeding the sick [the sick]

Get away from me
in the while you trail the song
of your despair
the separate that you fear

You can break it
Can tear this motherfucker down let his face just crashing off

You can break it
Can tear this motherfucker down let his face just crashing over 'n over

priceless intentions to this calling, just let you know
I'm really fucked up fed up with you
cause I know what I got to lose
remember the shit that you whenever put us through
remember the shit that you whenever put us through
remember the shit

You can break it
Can tear this motherfucker down
let his face just crashing over 'n over

Get away from me
in the while you trail the song
of your despair
the separated you fear
