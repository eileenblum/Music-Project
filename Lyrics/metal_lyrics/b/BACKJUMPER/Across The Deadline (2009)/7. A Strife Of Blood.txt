unspoken words, unwritten laws
we're fuckin haunted
they control what surrounds us
while the hero is fallin
a new reality warns me

and fall into this
into this black hole
they're just to busy
to care about their souls

a strife of blood of ignorance and no reason
show me the sun that's blinding my eyes
from the fuckin truth

fall down to their wonders, just a toy to the slave

hiding the purpose so full of shit
using fake himn closed like a goddamn door
hard to ignore experiencing the betrayal

and fall into this
into this black hole
they're just to busy
to care about their souls

a strife of blood of ignorance and no reason
show me the sun that's blinding my eyes
from the fuckin truth

fall down to their wonders, just a toy to the slave
and you will be forgotten today

now you feel left outside
explore this anymore
stabbed back and raped
on the floor of this fuckin taking over

same routine of hate is expanding one more time again
is the same old story ain't change

these few seconds of quiet
been brought back inside
they'll be denied
through the ashes of lies

never to believe in a brand new world denied
through the ashes of lies

LIES

nothing changes not in vain
it just remains the same
