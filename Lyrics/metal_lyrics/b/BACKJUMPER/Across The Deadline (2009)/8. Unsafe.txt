SAFE!!!

Fight inside for blood an oil
Fight The War not asking why [what?]
Only pain who got the control
army of hypocrisy

crucified from regrets
the voice of emptiness

living a fuckin life lost
where death is the only price to pay
and there's NO ESCAPE from the lies
with fear in their eyes

crucified from regrets
a voice for the emptiness
in the hands of violence
haunted and mutilated

Inside your fight Crawling again
the name is none on the tombstone
are dead but don't even know yet

disperation that lives in them
they soon will be free
yeah goddamn free from the faults
that were never been inflicted

crucified from regrets
the voice of emptiness
in the hands of violence
they're haunted and mutilated

your madness is endless

world wide war disorder
the times are so unsafe

no escape from the lies
with fear in their eyes

the times are so unsafe

Help them save their souls
entrapped in the bullets
killing millions of people
deliver them from evil
