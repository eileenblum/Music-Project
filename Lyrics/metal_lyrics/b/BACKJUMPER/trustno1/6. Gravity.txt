Surrounded by surrenders

So detail this policy
We got tendency
To chase something fake
Canât stop this legacy
Repeating every mistake into another mistake
Piece by piece, choose by choose
Keep your ass down to truth
Nothing gone escaped this, and you too!

No time for looking forward
No time for looking back
We get now
We get all
Of this fuckinâ land

Thatâs called âevolutionâ
Please read âself-destructionâ!
We get now
We get all
We got sickness
We got fault!
-Gravity is killing me!-

Bury the past, donât give a shit
We got concrete
For the futureâs sake
Canât stop this legacy
Repeating every mistake into another remake
Piece by piece, step by step
Lots of secrets, laid to rest
Nothing gone escaped thisâ¦no!..tomorrow nothing will never escape !

This is stronger anymore, as an animalâ¦.!!!!
This is stronger anymore, as an animal
This is stronger anymore, Iâm an animal

Criminal ânâ paranoid
Parasite
Only searching paradise
To multiply
Thru the motherfuckinâ time
Metropolitan pain
Toxic rain
Nothing can be sane
The sufferance
People die
Oh my god!
Itâs our shit that falls from the sky..
Go!

Never enough!

it's the only law
We still are slaves
it's the only force
That keeps us here
So close your eyes now, and believe
We get now
We get all
We got sickness
We got fault!

Gravity is killing me!
