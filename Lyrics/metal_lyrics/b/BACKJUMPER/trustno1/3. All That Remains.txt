Read between the lines for once,
This is dedicated to you phony
Because even if you thought
You will never ever know me

I don't care what you think about me
Talking like someone that will never be free
Once again I choose for myself
Cause I'm a loser with no fucking excuses
Just in case you question, run away guy
You've always been the child, that never cared, rise up
Stuck in this life breathing and now thinking about it
I made my decision, this time I ain't gonna loose
visions so distorted with no order
I do this for me you're so blind now
I see my reflection in the future, so close

All that remains, in the end
I thought we were friends
But it can't never be the same
Never be the same

Yeah, this time you hear what I say
You've never been true to me

I'm always the same, the one you hate
Nobody's on my side, but still alive
Using my words letting you fall
In this life I've always been alone
You were lost when everything was right
Another day, another fight for me
Don't tell me no more what to do
Cause i'm no more your fucking toy
Nobody knows, nobody's got, nobody's standing here
All those right reasons aren't right for me
My eyes aren't able to recognize
What you got inside, in your own life
Now you act mothefucker like is all right
But i know what the fuck is like
Just a question: have you ever felt this way ?

All that remains, in the end
I thought we were friends
But it can't never be the same
Never be the same

Yeah, this time you hear what I say
You've never been true to me

That's what you taught me

giving you back and close the casket
giving you back punk, I'm gonna trust no one !

giving you back all the shit that I found in the memories
just a piece of the plan has remain to complete, till the end

you're the cause of my hate, don't be so hyprocrite
now you know I will never fall down in your bullshits
