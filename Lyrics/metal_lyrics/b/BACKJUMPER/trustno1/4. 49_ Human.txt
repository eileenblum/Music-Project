49% Human

Stuck here in the underground still in a shadow zone
Nothing clear to reject my fears, i'm a monster of flesh and bone

Know can't you fight, and know can't you kill something that you can't see

Darkness is my only skin, cause I settle to disappear
Far away to reject my pain, I keep however my troubles close to me

Know can't you fight, and know can't you kill something that you can't see

They're teaching me to stay calm, this is a fuckin make up

Hatred in my fucking veins, feeding a new mistake
I refuse the truth and I pay my dues
While they murder, kill and rape

Stuck here forever, cause I'm naked and caged by the hands of a fool

Here comes the time of the 49, will pay for a closer view

Know can't you fight, and know can't you kill something that you can't see

Be what you made

It's time
Hiding myself is so easy, like running down the stairs
But the world cannot keep my secret, I've got to climb and rise

I need my hope, I need my strenght, my 51% Human
