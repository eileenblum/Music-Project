Yes I feel it, the power fills me.
Yes, I feel the universe within me! I am a part of the cosmos! The power flows through me!
Of what consequence are you now? This planet, these people. They are nothing to me!
The universe is power! Real, unstoppable power! And I am that force!
I am that power! Kneel before your master!
Fool! You are no longer my equal! I am more than man! More than life!
I am a God! Now You will kneel!
