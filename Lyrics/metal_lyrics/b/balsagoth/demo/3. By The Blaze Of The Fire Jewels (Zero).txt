I hearken to the grisly murmer of nameless fiends, black jaws drooling blasphemy,
Beyond the witch-song, darkly sweet, the wyrm-horn sounds cross Dagon's mere,
Shadow-gate (portal to the Black Pyramid) yawns wide, beckoning...
Spells scrawled in blood and frosty rime, squamous god encoils the onyx shrine,
(by the bleeding stone) I am enraptured by ophidian eyes.
Pungent odour of engorged flesh, vaults of eon-veiled horror,
Embraced by delerium, witches' balms anoint me.

Veils of frost entwine me in the haze of baleful moon-cursed dreams,
I hear the High Ones whispering ancient spells in the long-dead tongues,
There is the gleam of blackened steel in the flickering torchlight,
And I embrace the balm of sublime forgetfulness...

By the blaze of the burning skulls, beneath the Well of the Black Flame,
In the vaults of the dreaming gods,shackled to the slime-smeared bleeding stone.
Squamous orbs, black sword, drink deep, blood oath.
Supine shapes dancing in the mist,
Serpent-tongued priestess bares her pale flesh,
Shadows crawl to the sundered stones,
The Eternal Fiends exult in rapture.

Tomb-worms bloat on carnal blood, trickling onto wraith-carved stone,
Dark laughter echoes through the vaults,
Black-winged, cruel as envenomed steel.
In the Well of Black Flame, squamous shapes writhe,
A dark tide of shadows follows me,
Ravening fiends unleashed to feed,
Incantations pour in torrents from my lips
Wraiths and fiends whirl to my bidding horrors 'neath the pyramid.
