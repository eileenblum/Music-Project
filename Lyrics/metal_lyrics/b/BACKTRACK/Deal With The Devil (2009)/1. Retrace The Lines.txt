I'm walking away
I see the line,
it's staring back at me
But all the debt has been paid
So I'm released as a pawn in this game
And still I'm wondering why
You never see- this from the other side
Illusion burned in your mind
I'll drain it out after I burn the bridge
Retrace the lines that I've made
So you can see the point
The faces switch with the day
And now I'm starting to track
Consistent patterns where I'm dodging the blame
I'm walking away
I see the line,
it's staring back at me
But all the debt has been paid
So I'm released as a pawn in this game
And still I'm wondering why
You never see- this from the other side
Illusion burned in your mind
I'll drain it out after I burn the bridge
When I open my eyes I can't stand what I see
Misled into a trap and now I'm turning my back
I try to keep my faith but how much more can I take?
The big picture lost it's chance to be seen
Retrace the lines, Demanding permanent praise.
That's not a price I'll pay
The truth is leaking, Slowly revealing,
Spells out intentions that were hidden inside.
