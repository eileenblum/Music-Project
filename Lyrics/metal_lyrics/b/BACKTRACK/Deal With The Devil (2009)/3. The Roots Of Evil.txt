The roots of evil
They follow you around
Waiting for their chance to latch on
And once they get a hold they'll never release
That's the way that it goes in this world of deceit.
Intentions turned around
All your sources are facing down
Intentions turned around
All your sources are facing down
On to the ground
That reflection will never be found
I fought the battle and I'm losing the war
Down in the count but I'll still settle the score.
Lost in the shuffle are all of the facts
Now collecting them all
It's just a failed attempt
The words I said never made the page
Replaced with lies you only see on the other side.
Distort the truth. I'm still searching for the proof.
Been left to rot on the ground,
For the whole world to find out.
Still searching for the proof.
