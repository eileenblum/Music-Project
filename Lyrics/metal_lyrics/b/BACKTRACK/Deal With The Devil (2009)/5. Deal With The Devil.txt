Another story with the same ending
We're dead inside but still pretending
The constant theme, stuck in a trap
For every move I make I'm being sent back
Deal with the devil that I try to escape
No sense in running when he's holding my fate
It's just an instinct that I fight to erase
But the deal is done, The end result
It's still the same, Can't look away
Eye's stuck on the darkside.
Running in circles and I'm trying to find
Another way out cause I'm losing my mind
Running in circles and I'm trying to find
Another way out cause I'm losing my mind
But I can't move ahead when you're stuck on the past
Making the changes only deepens the ditch
Down to the bottom is the place that I'm sent
I think of what I had and where it all went
Deal with the devil that I try to escape
No sense in running when he's holding my fate
It's just an instinct that I fight to erase
But the deal is done.
With every step that I take
I see the same face shaking it's head at me.
Never in approval.
