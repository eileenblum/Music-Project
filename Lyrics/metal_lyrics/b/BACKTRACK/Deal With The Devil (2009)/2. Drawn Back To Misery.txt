Facing the facts
I'm getting stuck by the day
Now what I'm figuring out
No chance in breaking away
I see the reasons
And they're repeating
Can't shut them out of my mind
Stuck in rotation
Where devastation
Is quickly spreading
Cutting the chance to survive
Facing the facts
I'm getting stuck by the day
Now what I'm figuring out
Drawn back to misery
The only path I see
So many fail the test
And I won't drown with the rest
That's all I see, The only sight that I see
I see the reasons
And they're repeating
Can't shut them out of my mind
Stuck in rotation
Where devastation
Is quickly spreading
Cutting the chance to survive
Destroy it more by the day
Watching the fates fall in line
The futures fading away
