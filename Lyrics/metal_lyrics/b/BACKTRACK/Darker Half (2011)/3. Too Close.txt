You left me out
Thatâs why Iâm empty now
I need that piece of me back
I need that piece of me back
So I can kill my past and start from scratch
I brought you too close
I lowered my guard
I need that piece of me you stole away
I brought you too close
Now cause of you
I canât get out of this hell
You left me out
And Iâm still empty now
But what you wanted from me
I couldnât give
Iâve seen the warning signs and the whole time
I brought you too close
I lowered my guard
I need that piece of me you stole away
I brought you too close
Now cause of you
I canât get out of this hell
I brought you in too close
Trusted you with my life
I brought you in too close
And then I watched you pull the plug
What you wanted from me
I couldnât give to you
So Iâm not looking back
Just want to bury my past
I brought you in too close
