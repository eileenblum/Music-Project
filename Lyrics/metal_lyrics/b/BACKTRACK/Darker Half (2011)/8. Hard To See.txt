Iâve always been misunderstood
So why should I expect for things to change?
Throughout my life everyoneâs been questioning
What goes through my head
And why I wonât snap out of it
What they never see is all the times it saved my life
Iâve said a thousand times that I know the reasons why
Why I take from all my time
Forever burned inside my mind
But for them itâs so hard to see
Iâm not looking back
What goes through my head
And why I wonât snap out of it
But I chose my path
So i will forge my way
Iâve said a thousand times that I know the reasons why
Why I take from all my time
Forever burned inside my mind
I see no light at the end of the road
But now I have a place to go
For you itâs hard to see
All the things I see and what Iâll always be
For you itâs hard to see
But I canât count on you
Iâll just count on me
