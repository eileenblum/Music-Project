Iâve seen enough to know that some of you have to go
Canât let the bad drive the good away
The cure will never be far out of our reach
We gotta fight this war to secure our peace
Iâm getting sick the way things are
So Iâm putting my foot down
It is so hard just to see the light
Darkness surrounds me
Putting my foot down
You see whatâs going on?
Putting my foot down
Before we wait too long
Canât sit back and watch the bad rise up and drive the good away
Iâm getting sick the way things are
So Iâm putting my foot down
It is so hard just to see the light
Darkness surrounds me
Putting my foot down
You see whatâs going on?
Putting my foot down
Before we wait too long
Iâve seen enough to know
Enough to know that some of you must go
Iâm putting my foot down
Iâm getting sick so some of you must go
