I keep pushing for something to push me
Far from the days where I fight to keep myself sane
Deathâs on the way so I turn around my rage
Wonât let my darker half control my ways
Itâs safe to say Iâm not the only one
Itâs always been easier said than done
Iâve seen their fall so now itâs time for a change
Wonât let my darker half control my ways
Been waiting for something to set me apart from pain
Why would you lead me this way?
Wonât let my weaker side consume my days
Itâs safe to say Iâm not the only one
Itâs always been easier said than done
Iâve seen their fall so now itâs time for a change
Wonât let my darker half control my ways
Iâd rather spend my days in pain than send my dreams right down the drain
Wonât let my darker half control my ways
Wonât let my worst betray what Iâve earned
My darker half wonât control my ways
Wonât let my worst betray what Iâve earned
Thatâs always easier said than done
Iâve let this world disprove all that Iâve grown
To know the day I questioned my own
Done spending my time feeding my weaker side
I turn the page on those lies
Easier said than done
