First we said that weâd never part
Broke my trust but that was just the start
I never thought it would come to this
Youâre another down, crossed off my list
Damaged whatâs sacred
Not the path that I chose
A violent split of the two
Let it be known
This hate between us is running straight to my bones
I have grown away from him so just leave it alone
Damaged whatâs sacred
Not the path that I chose
A violent split of the two
We broke our bonds and Iâm moving on
So Iâll make sure that it stays the truth
We grew apart, thatâs where it began
Now I donât ever want to see you again
You left me out stranded at sea
I know weâre blood but youâre still dead to me
A violent split
