Sucked back into a place
Where all I ever see is the actions of the possessed
Their hands are tied but theyâre still digging their graves
Arrested by their own debt
I see their lives on the line
The more they fight the more theyâre falling behind
I see them falling in front of my eyes
Each chance Iâm given I try to escape
A part of me that Iâll never embrace
These greedy hands have been choking my dreams
So now itâs up to me
Iâm face to face with whatâs been killing the oneâs around me
The blindest eyes could even notice the pain that I see
Their different lives planned their demise
But now this world that Iâm living in is self destructing
Fools in my way and I can hear what they say
So now itâs clear
Theyâll never find their way
