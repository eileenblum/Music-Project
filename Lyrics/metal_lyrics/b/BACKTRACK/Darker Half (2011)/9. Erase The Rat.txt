Hid from the truth
Lied to the youth
Now I see those words
They mean nothing to you
What youâre selling
I wonât buy
You sucked this dry
When will they realize?
Erase the rat
Youâve been dead in my heart
So why the fuck wonât you die in my eyes?
I need to expose who you are
Youâve been dead in my heart
So why the fuck wonât you die in my eyes?
So I can erase the rat
Hid from the truth
Lied to the youth
Now I see those words
They mean nothing to you
What youâre selling
I wonât buy
You sucked this dry
When will they realize?
I donât owe you
This wonât happen on my watch
I donât owe you
I just need to expose who you are
Erase the rat
Youâve been dead in my heart
So why the fuck wonât you die in my eyes?
I need to expose who you are
Youâve been dead in my heart
So why the fuck wonât you die in my eyes?
So I can erase the rat
Erase the rat
