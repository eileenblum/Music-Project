Strayed away as I grew with age
The love and hate could never separate
Iâm left alone cause of the choice I made
And you wiped the smile right off my fucking face
Why canât you look for the greater good?
Why wonât you look for the greater good?
I found mine so now I sacrifice
Iâll tread my way but Iâll always wonder why
Iâm dismissed by the both of you
Just for the course that I choose
Dismissed by the both of you
My road splits in two
I know this world too well
You gotta look out for yourself
I know this world too well
Canât change for anybody else
Why canât you look for the greater good?
Why wonât you look for the greater good?
I know this world too well
The lesson learned when dragged through this hell
Iâm dismissed by the both of you
Just for the course I choose
Dismissed by the both of you
My road splits in two
To do whatâs right for me or change it all for you
Dismissed by the both of you
But in this life I seek some truth
I know this world too well
You gotta look out for yourself
