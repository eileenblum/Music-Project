Still on the search for peace within my mind
Ills of this earth have left me nothing to find
But I canât seem to shake that feeling inside
In every corner I turn I see a dream I let die
My first mistake was trying to keep up a pace
So i could stay in a race that led me straight to my grave
So now I turn away
I leave behind the fools that wonât change their fate
If lifeâs plan for me is to be this way
Then Iâm scratching and crawling to stay away
If lifeâs plan for me is to be this way
Then Iâm fighting and pulling to stay far away
Lifeâs plan
Still on the search for peace within my mind
Ills of this earth have left me nothing to find
No longer living with this hole in my chest
I wonât be forced down this line towards an end with the rest
Now that Iâve seen the way that this world turns
Iâm bowing out of this race but others never learn
They reach the finish line and all they get is a dead feeling inside
If lifeâs plan for me is to be this way
Then Iâm scratching and crawling to stay away
If lifeâs plan for me is to be this way
Then Iâm fighting and pulling to stay far away
Lifeâs plan
Iâll stay far away
Lifeâs plan
For me
Whatâs so understand?
Itâs just the way I am
Another angry man
Trapped in this life without a plan
Everyoneâs caught in the race
