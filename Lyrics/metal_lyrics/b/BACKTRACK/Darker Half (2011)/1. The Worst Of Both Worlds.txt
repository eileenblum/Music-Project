Cursed
I face the worst of both worlds in every place that I turn
Itâs hard enough to find balance between
When each sideâs destroying a part of me
I need a way
Need a way to snap this curse
Cause I canât keep up
Canât keep up when Iâm in reverse
I face the worst of both worlds in every place that I turn
Itâs hard enough to find balance between
When each sideâs destroying a part of me
I fought to find a way
To rid myself of the shame
I never found a way
To carry the blame I have been cursed
I face the worst of both worlds in every place I turn
Now all I need for me is a way to break this curse
Worst of both worlds
