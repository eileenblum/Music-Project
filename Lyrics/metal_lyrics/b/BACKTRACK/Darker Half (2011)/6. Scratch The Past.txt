Iâm searching for a sign so I can make it by
Scratch the past out from my eyes and move on with my life
Iâm searching for a sign so I can make it by
Iâve reached the end of my road and Iâm still torn between choices
Should I bring back what has died?
Or scratch the past out of my eyes?
Iâm searching for a sign and Iâm still torn between choices
Show me a sign
