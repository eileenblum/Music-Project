Growing tired of these faces
Always twist around whatever they say
Now that I know truth
It will bury you
Mistook my kindness for weakness
But Iâll be striking first so that it sinks in
This time you struck a nerve
I caught you red handed
So now you'll pay for it
I caught you red handed
You broke the golden rule
I caught you red handed
This time you struck a nerve with me
I caught you red handed
And now youâll pay for it
Gone are the days where I could, where I could see a trusting face
Now all my eyes can see are ways to dodge the fake
But time will tell how you choose to react
When this time itâs my knife thatâs stuck in your back
I caught you red handed
So now youâll pay for it
I caught you red handed
You broke the golden rule
I caught you red handed
This time you struck a nerve with me
I caught you red handed
And now you'll pay for it
And now you'll pay for it
I caught you red handed
And now you'll pay for it
How will you choose to react
When this time itâs my knife thatâs stuck in your back
I know the truth
You broke the golden rule
And I caught you, I caught you red handed
