I can't just leave my world the way it is
You think I will just lay down to die?
Been fighting these uphill battles my whole life

I'm still biting these chains
Bite till they break
Chains break
Bite till they break
I'm still biting these chains
I won't just lay down to die

I won't just leave my world the way it is
You think I will just lay down to die
Been fighting uphill battles my whole life
I'll rip up the hand you're dealing me
I won't go through this life on my knees

I'm still biting
I'm still biting these chains
Bite till they break
Chains break
Bite till they break
I'm still biting these chains
I won't just lay down to die

So I'll rip the hand that your dealing
I won't go through this life on my knees
I'm still biting to break these chains
I won't just leave my world
The way it is
