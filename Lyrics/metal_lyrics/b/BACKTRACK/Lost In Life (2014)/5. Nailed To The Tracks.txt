Ask me why I take this path I choose?
I'll spit those words right back at you
Ask me when I'm gonna grow up too?
But I will never be like you.

Nailed to the tracks

Older and older as I'm growing older
It's getting harder not to fall for their trap
Older and older as I'm growing older
I'm seeing more of them nailed to the tracks

Ask me why I take this path I choose?
And ask me when I'm gonna grow up too?
Ask me why?
I'll never be like you

Cause you're nailed to the tracks

Older and older as I'm growing older
It's getting harder not to fall for their trap
Older and older as I'm growing older
I'm seeing more of them nailed to the tracks

You tell me you're the one who's growing up
But your the one who's giving up
And now you're nailed to the tracks

You say you've grown up but you're just giving up
I walk past you while you're nailed to the tracks.
