I won't stand aside while you try to make a fool out of me
You've got to realize how hard I tried to let this be
What's done is done we can't change that

I've bit my tongue for far too long
Cause you've been speaking out of place and now it's time
I've bit my tongue now it's time to right this wrong

I tried to turn my cheek
I tried to walk away
But you just keep pushing me
They say to walk away
I tried to let this die too many times
Why's it so hard to walk away sometimes?
I won't let you get the best of me this time
Right this wrong

I've bit my tongue now it's time to right this wrong
I tried to turn my cheek
I tried to walk away
But you just keep on pushing me
Now it's time to right this wrong.
