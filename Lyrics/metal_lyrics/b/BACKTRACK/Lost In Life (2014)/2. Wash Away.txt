When will you wash away?
Over and over they keep us down
They keep on coming back around
You say things changed
It's not the same
So when will you fucking wash away?

Crawling
They keep crawling back
They never found what they needed
So they're crawling back
They keep crawling back

Wash away
The infected bacth
So we send them back
Wash away
Wash em' away wash em' away
Send them back

You talk like things changed
The flame burned away with age
Send them back
Just take them to the trash
Send them back
The infected bacth
Send them back
