You played it safe all of your life
Always searching for something you can't find
Because you'd rather take the easy way
I can't believe you say that you're alive

Say that you're alive?
You're fooling me cause your hearts not beating
Say that you're alive?
You had a chance but you'd rather play it safe
Why can't you see there's more to what you're living?
I can't believe you say that you're alive
Say that you're alive?

You had a chance but you'd rather play it safe
My biggest fear?
A life that goes to waste
You're telling me that you're alive on the inside
But you're hearts not beating.
