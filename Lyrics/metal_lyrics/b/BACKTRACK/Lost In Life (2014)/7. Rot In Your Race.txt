I'm walking my own pace
Live day to day
Think that I'm joining you?

Rot in your race

Too many times
I've tried to walk with the rest of the world
I fooled myself to think I'd fit into their world
I wasn't made just to rot in your race
You've got to realize that there's much more to life than you see

So don't rot in your race
I'm walking my own pace
Live day to day
Think that I'm joining you?
Rot in your race

Too many times I've heard you say that I'm the one who's changed
So I walk away from you- your loss my gain
I wasn't made to rot in your race
You've got to realize that there's much more to life than you see

So don't rot in your race
You tell me to face reality
You say that I'm the one who's dreaming?
You tell me to face reality
But I don't wanna live your nightmares

Rot in your race
I'm walking my own pace
Live day by day
Think that I'm joining you?
Rot in your race
