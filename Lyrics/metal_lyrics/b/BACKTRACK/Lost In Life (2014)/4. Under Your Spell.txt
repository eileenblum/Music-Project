I need a brand me start
Cause I've been torn apart
Just need to rip out this dirty heart

I need a brand new start
Cause I've been dying under your spell
I've been dragged around in the dirt
I stuck around just to feel so hurt
I've been dragged around in the dirt Cause I've been dying under your spell

I've been under
Falling under
Dying under
Your spell

I'm seeing black and I've been dying under your spell
I need a brand new start
Stopped seeing the truth awhile ago
Still I can't walk away

I need a brand new start
I let you lead me down this path of broken class
I've been dragged around in the dirt
I stuck around just to feel so hurt

I've been been under
Falling under
Dying under
your spell

I've been waiting but the suns not shining
I've been under
Falling under
Dying under
Your spell

I'm seeing black and I've been dying under your spell
Searching for my brand new start
I can't live under your spell

How many times can I be dragged down through the dirt?
Cause I'm tired of dying under your spell
Dragged through the dirt living under your spell
