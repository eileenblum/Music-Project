Lost in life- is what they labeled me.
Lost in life- they say I'm out of reach
All this time I needed something more

No longer lost
I found myself a cure
Saved me
No longer bleeding
I found some meaning
So I'm not feeling lost in life

Lost in life- done searching for the light
Lost in life- so save me you advice
No longer lost
Now I have something more

No longer lost
Finally found a cure
Saved me
No longer bleeding
I found some meaning
So I'm not feeling lost in life
Cured so save me your advice

We're no longer lost in life
Now that i found the cure I found my place in this world
Now that I found the cure
I'm no longer lost in life.
