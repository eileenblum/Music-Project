Ambition's got a hold of me
Keeps putting me into the night
All this energy right in front of me
This is a chance that won't last forever
Here today but I'll be gone tomorrow
There's a hole in my life that I've gotta see through
I'm sorry I can't stay
There's something out there calling my name
I hope you see what I'm going through
This is something that I've gotta do
Searching for my smile
Ambition's got a hold of me
But I'm losing my hold over you
I'll understand if you move on without me
But please don't forget me when I'm gone
My spirit's suffering
I have to follow the voice in my head
My spirit's suffering
But it's been leading me to a path on my own
I'm sorry I can't stay
There's something out there calling my name
I hope you see what I'm going through
This is something I've gotta do
I can't stay
There's something out there calling my name
This is something I've gotta do
I hope you see that I'm searching for my smile
