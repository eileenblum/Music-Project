Conscience drifting towards the darkness and the light
The thoughts attack me
Won't let me sleep
When will I rest in peace?

Closed off
I never did their crimes
Still I'm living with a guilty conscience
I never did their crimes
So why am I still burning inside?
I never did their crimes

My thoughts eating me alive
Closed off
I never did their crimes
Still I'm living with a guilty conscience
The thoughts attack me
Still I'm guilty
I never did their crimes
Still I'm guilty
