What the fuck
Is going on?
Am I sleeping maybe sleepwalking?
So dizzy by what is happening
I feel like time
Has no ending
Still don't feel like this is real
Still don't know how this makes me feel

I can't go back on
Wait , wait for me don't collapse hun
The clock wants to beat me on arrival
I can't control the game anymore

I'm screaming to know more
I'm screaming to know more

Even here there's no explanation
Only people who eradicated my emotion
The wait only kills me more

What the fuck is going on
Is going on

I never wanted it that way
I never planned to make you face this all alone
I'd give you my life to clear your memory
Of this past tragedy

Now the only thing I have for you is a promise
The promise that i'll forever protect you
I can't go back on
Wait, wait for me
Don't collapse hun
Still don't feel like this is real
Still don't know how things makes me feel
WHAT THE FUCK!
