These countless sleepless night
I dreamed of this situation
My empty mind filled with those visions
It will always have the same beginning
But so many different endings

I've been confused
I've been confused for a minute
But it didn't take me long
To realize
That this is my time

Dear precious soul
Everything will be
Dear precious soul
Everything will be .. fine

And now looking at you
The one that took our lives away, we want them back
We want them back..
And i promise i'll see the horror in your eyes
Knees down you will beg me to stop
This was your only chance

And tell me how do you feel when i drown your soul
Give up

The agony is taking over your cold body
Destroyed from the inside you will give up on life
Destroyed from the inside you will give up on.. life!
