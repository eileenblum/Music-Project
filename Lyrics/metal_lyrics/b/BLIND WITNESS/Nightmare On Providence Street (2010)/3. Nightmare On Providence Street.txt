Get me out of this house alive
She's screaming for her life
Get me out of this house alive
She's screaming for her life
She's saying it so loud
I would hear it even if were miles appart
She's saying it so loud
I would hear it even if we are miles appart

I want to help you
But what can i do the devil is on you
I want to help you
But what can i do
I just got there too late
I'm gonna blame myself for decades
I just got there too late
I'm gonna blame myself for decades

This feeling wont fade
This feeling i can't trade

I wanna open my eyes
I want you to tell me this is a lie
We wont let those tears
Wash away our pride
Well stand on our feet
We'll raise our head up high
Hold ourselves tight
We will survive!

I gotta figure a plan tonight
I clenched my fist ready to fight
We will raise our head up high
Hold ourselves tight
We will survive

I gotta figure a plan tonight
I clenched my fist ready to fight
Trust me I'll get everything alright
My only question is
Where was Jesus Christ?

WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU GOD??
WHERE WERE YOU GOD?!
