I'm telling you something right now
Something that i should have yelled so many times before
Just take a look at your past lover you whore
They are still suffering from your insincerity
You've destroyed.. destroyed their integrity
I wanna nail you on a wall
And stone you with my words for all your sins

I hope one day you'll be able to breathe sincerity
You were suppose to help me
But you almost killed me
I had trust in you now i cant even look at you
I had trust in you now you dont wanna know what i would do to you
Why would you not face all this
So i can yell those words
You are nothing better than a drunk as fuck one night
You're nothing better
You're nothing better
You are nothing better then a drunk as fuck one night baby
You had the singer now got a loser
Swallow your false excuses and your true lies

You're nothing but fake
You're nothing but fake

Theres something missing
I can go on and on but youll never change
If only everybody can see you as i pictured you

I HAD TRUST IN YOU NOW I CANT EVEN LOOK AT YOU

I HAD TRUST IN YOU NOW YOU DONT WANNA KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO TO YOU!!
