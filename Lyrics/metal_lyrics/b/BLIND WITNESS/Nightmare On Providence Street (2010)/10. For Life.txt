Turn over motherfucker
Show me your true colors
Stop hiding your ugly side
You have no one to hide
No one to hide behind

I should have fucked you up
Your time is up
Ripping your mouth appart
So you can't say anything
Ripping your mouth appart so you cant say anything
Drown others that are barely breathing
Sause you're nothing
After all this after what we've done i want you gone
After all this after what we've done i want you gone
After all this after what we've done i want you gone
I dare you to find the small amound of courage you have in you
And admit it youre a piece of shit
A piece of shit

You took the spring winds that was blowing on me
Someones must take it back, someone must take it back
But did you know that this season is out of breath
Someone must take it back
I'm gonna take it back
