Separated, isolated
Away from who I was before
My only consolation is to dream
Of you laying in your own blood on the floor
Of you laying in your own blood on the floor
But this is what keeps me so far away
Away from the ones who can give me the chance to see another day
I'm going six feet down
But I swear I'm taking you with me into the ground

Precious glory moment come near me
Let that dream become
Your worst enemy
Let me help you
Put that rope around your neck
Satisfaction everywhere
Then I kick the fucking chair

THEN I KICK THE FUCKING CHAIR!

Who gives a fuck you're fucking dead
Who gives a fuck you're fucking dead
Bitch

This is weird how it's gonna hurt you
But please me
I'll make the pain last forever
i wont give up on you
Till i can hear the word im sorry
Until you'll realize what the fuck you did
I wish i wasnt weak that day
Without compassion

You never got what you fuckin' truly deserved
Oh glory moment become my liberation
BECOME OUR LIBERATION
