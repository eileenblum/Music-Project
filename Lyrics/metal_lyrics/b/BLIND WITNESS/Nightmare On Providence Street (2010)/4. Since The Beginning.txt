wish i never woke up
on this day i saw my whole life breaking into pieces
the morning light just came out
as the shadow 's falling on me
falling on me

this phone call, this apocalypse
this voice was murdered
like an earthquake
these words shattered on me
my body's shaking this disaster
these words shattered on me
my body is shaking this DISASTER

my pain separated me from
the rest of the world

she fought to survive, survive for us
she was so innnocent
how could you do this
this cant be real
how could you do this

i've would have killed just to be by your side
before he killed you

i wish i never woke up....
