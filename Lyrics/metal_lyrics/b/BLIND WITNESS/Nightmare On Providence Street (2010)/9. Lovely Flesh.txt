Drinking the insensibility potion
To be sure
That its gonna slow down my motion
So my mind paralysed my emotion
I know it's not a good solution
But for now on this is my devotion

I'll bring you home for the tease
After my last sip you're my tip
I wont fuck you even if you say please
That a part of the sleeze (tease)

I'll drink you all, i drank you all
Now im drunk of you all
And I'll puke you all!!

In the end where this is leading me
I still feel empty cause you're not the one that i want
To wake up next to me
To wake up next to me
Lots of lovely flesh passed through my sheets
Lots of lovely flesh passed through my sheets

But only to find the one
That would have your scent
I dont need to tell this is making me gong straight to hell
The last time i said goodbye to you
Meant I'll see you later
But now later seems forever
Will you ever forgive me one day or another

I know I'm not alone in this game
I dont do that for the fame..
In fact im just really ashamed
In this fucking heart game..

Drinking the insensibility potion
To be sure
That it's gonna slow down my motion
So my mind paralysed my emotion
I know it's not a good solution
But for now on this is my devotion
