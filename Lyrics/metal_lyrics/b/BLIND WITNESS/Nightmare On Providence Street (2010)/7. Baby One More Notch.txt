We'll drink ourselves to death
Until we're red eyed and nothing is left
So take shots at the bar (So take shots at the bar)
Until there is no more!

Add a drink to my tab!
Add a notch to my bed
We're all zombies waiting to die
We don't know why but we'll give it a try!

Add another nail to this casket
take another bill from my wallet
All I know is that I'm thirsty &amp; I'm craving for some more!
Going through life, living a lie
So tell your fucking god to show me a sign..

My conscience is blind and my morals are deaf
I don't give a fuck I'd rather be dead
My conscience is blind and my morals are deaf
I don't give a fuck

Going through life, living a lie
So tell your fucking god to show me a sign..
It's my time to get the fuck up!

TABARNAK!

Let me rot
Let me vanish
Let me sway
One more night, Drinking away.

Add a drink to my tab!
Add a notch to my bed
We're all zombies waiting to die
We don't know why but we'll give it a try

One more night, drinking away!
One more night, drinking away!
Fuck you!
