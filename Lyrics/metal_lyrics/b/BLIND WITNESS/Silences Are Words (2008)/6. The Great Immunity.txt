Inferno's coming this way.
The degradation of reality.
Combustion of all the city, revealing a plague.
Shame of the vitality, it'll be.
Funeral of the whole vivacity.
The greatest hallway to a ruining extinction.
But we, we wont retreat.
Ascendancy, we're clevering everything.
Load up the metallic element.
We are crushing the cryptic legion,
We're crushing the nuance,
We're crushing the shade
And we're crushing your face,
Destroying the grace.
Clearing the way and engraving the frontline.
The engines are smoking,
Depressed by the time.
We are the union,
You should glorify this moment.
