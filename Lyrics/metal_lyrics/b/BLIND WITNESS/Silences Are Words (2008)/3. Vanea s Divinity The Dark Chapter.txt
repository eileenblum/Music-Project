Hundreds of circles are on the pathway.
Leading the evidence.
The venom is taking all the optic lines of the carcass.
An ocean of misery.
You are stagnant.
This is the junction ending.
Ruining my globe like every time.
Drained as consumed an additional chronicle to endure.
The fall of the affinity and all those sweet instants, abandoned.
The radiance will appear soon.
Leading the way out to the domain.
Revenge. Thrust me. I'm indestructible.
I wont give up, you're the next.
There will be no more afflictions.
I'm the solidity and you'll be vanished.
Every sense you're living, will be your following agony.
