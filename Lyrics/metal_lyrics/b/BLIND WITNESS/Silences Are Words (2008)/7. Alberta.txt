As these days pass, I miss you more and more.
Baby, you're further from me now.
You made my heart stop
When we first met.
You're so flawless, so perfect,
But you were so quick to leave me.
Wide awake I lay in my bed,
Hoping my phone will ring,
So I can hear your voice again.
When I think about your smile,
It makes the distance seems like nothing.
This seems to be so right.
I could almost say it's fate.
Just say the words: I'll be yours...
