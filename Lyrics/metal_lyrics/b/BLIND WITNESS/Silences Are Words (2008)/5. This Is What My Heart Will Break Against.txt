For the first time,
I raised up my head to the sky
And I've clearly seen the sunshine comes through the heavens.
That shining light shows me the path I need to follow to be by your side.
So many time I've got close enough to feel your love shine on me
But I lost it without being warned.
I found myself alone and cold again.
You're probably too far to feel the distress in my veins
That gets me on my knees again and again.
This is what I'm killing myself for.
As tides meeting the shore,
My heart will break against yours.
