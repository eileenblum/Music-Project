The dawn is coming and I'm feeling the fluid over my skin.
Melancholy is filling the life and it will grow by itself.
Pass through this masquerade.
You will die.
This universe can't stop us.
This is our world.
You will be buried.
I remember you were there full of passion with a smile on your face.
Enjoy every moments.
Hoping, living and tightening.
Now you're white, pale like snow and you know.
You'll pay for this.
Don't you know that you'll burn?
And I'll be sitting on the throne.
Hear this symphony.
This is your end!
Don't you know that you'll burn?
