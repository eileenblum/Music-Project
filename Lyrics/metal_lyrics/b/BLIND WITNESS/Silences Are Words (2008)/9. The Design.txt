I've slept for years under a white blanket.
Maybe I'm not right?
But all there thing have changed from themselves so fast.
So should I ask them to be like before?
I don't think so.
Buildings are higher by the time and all this highness get rid of me.
Take these five snakes and take you're time.
Slowly, hold them tight.
Clearly, it shows a light.
And oh dear, they wont bite you.
I promise.
They're kind of seraphic.
Please, please show them who the king is.
By the next days, I'm leaving the high voltage kingdom,
Becoming one of the glowing sea.
Underneath the torrent, filling the stream.
I'm levitating through well-known capitals.
Walking down the dark hallway; skies are sinking cocaine.
The citizen's routine.
This is the first look of a new generation novel.
Oh god, this can't be happened all these snakes around me. I wake up.
