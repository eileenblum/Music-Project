The first incision is made.
The knives start to tear your skin.
The blood drips at the end of the bland and you can't go back.
You started to change your life.
Why don't you love yourself?
Your infinite beauty disappears.
You will never really see your true self in the mirror
Until you see yourself in someone else eyes.
You can smash the class, cut yourself, change the pieces
But don't you know your heart will stop someday?
