A thousand miles between us can't separate me from this.
I'll reach all the seas, looking for an end.
Giving my everything to forget permanently red.
Hiding myself in different cities.
Lost in conversations, seeking for the moment I'll get back to my head.
Fighting in this one soldier battle.
Now we are both missing what we use to be.
I keep running, sinking, sticking myself to it.
For you nothing matters at all.
Finding the balance to know if it was the right move.
