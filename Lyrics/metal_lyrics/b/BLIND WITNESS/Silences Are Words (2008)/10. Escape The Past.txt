My spirit is now too weak to escape the past.
All my souvenirs of you still remain the sacrifice that I did for you.
I try to forget every moment I spent with you.
You're engraved in me.
Now, I'm requesting you give me he chances to come back on the right way.
The way I should keep.
I try to forget every moment I spent with you.
You're engraved in me.
You're engraved in me.
