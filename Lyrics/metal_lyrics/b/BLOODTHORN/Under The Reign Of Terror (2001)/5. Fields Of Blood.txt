Onwards into battle
Armies marching, seeking death
Fearless legions
On the road to hell, a killing spree
Crushing forces
With wicked lust they march to war

Approaching death
Spearhead tearing through their flanks
Besiege their cities
Walls and trenches battle in blood
Their ranks are crumbling
The last defenders soon will fall
Release the madness
Sadistic beasts with cruel intent
Arise with hunger
Chaos creatures feasting on the dead

On the fields of blood
The slaughter commence
On the fields of blood
To face the end

No mercy given
All must perish, none shall live
Inferno coming
Black magic spells, evil rise
Malicious fiends
The dead awakens, craving blood
Frenzied slaughter
The aftermath, relenthless death

On the fields of blood
The slaughter commence
On the fields of blood
To face the end
