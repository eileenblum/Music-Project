When the last defenders fall the city is overrun
Storming through the gates
Raping, maiming, burning down

No prisoners will be taken, no wounded will be spared
Lift the blade, decapitated
Maul their bodies, mutilate

Soldiers turn to beast, unleash inhuman urges
Revel in frsh meat, chopping limbs and organs
Tearing flesh from bodies, the fallen are their prey
Devouring hot entrails, no parts left to decay

Chewing eyes and brains, cannibal atrocity
Blood is tapped from veins
Infecting corpses with their seed
Getting drunk on bile
They drape themselves in human skin
When all is consumed
They eat the marrow from the spine

The attackers now move on, as the city lies in waste
Leaving piles of bones, they're killing off the human race
The horrors will continue, they know no other way
Feeding on their victims
No parts are left to decay
