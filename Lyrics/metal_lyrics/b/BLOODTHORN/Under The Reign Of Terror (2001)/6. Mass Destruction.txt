Panzer churning, smashing, burning
Crushing force on chained feet
Armoured beast, steelclad terror
Pulverizing, grinding meat

Total war
No redemption
Violent death
Mass destruction

From the skies they attack
On wings of steel, spewing death
Airborne carnage, millions die
Massive bombraids, a world on fire

Total war
No redemption
Violent death
Mass destruction

Nuclear hell breaking loose
Destroying all, leaving few
Melted flesh, bones that dry
Radiation kill those left behind

Total war
No redemption
Violent death
Mass destruction
