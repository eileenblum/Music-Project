Once again the taste of death is on my lips
Images of horror reflecting in my eyes
Morbid lust arise, as I watch them die
I succumb to sadistic urges, devouring their flesh
Feeling frenzy of the insane
Exophagus - eater of the dead

Demonblood - burning my organs, searing my skin
Demonblood - the curse of darkness, evil within
Demonblood - feeding the madness eating my brain
Demonblood - driving me insane

Arteries filled with black poison bursts
Gasping for air, choking on my guts
I succumb to sadistic urges, devouring their flesh
Feeling frenzy of the insane
Losing control, I start to devour my self

Demonblood - burning my organs, searing my skin
Demonblood - the curse of darkness, evil within
Demonblood - feeding the madness eating my brain
Demonblood - driving me insane
