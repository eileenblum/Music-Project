[Written by Mayhem]

Demonic laughter your cremation  
Your lungs gasp for air but are filled with blood  
A sudden crack as I crushed your skull  

The remind of your life flashes by  
A life that soon won't be  
Smiling with axe in my hand  
Evil's rotten hand you'll see  

I come forward  
Deathcrush  

I'll send you to your maker  
I'll send you to your death  

Death nicely crucified  
Death, heads on stakes  

The barbeque has just begun  
Deathcrush - Deathcrush - Deathcrush  

Crush - Crush  
Deathcrush  
Deathcrush  
Deathcrush
