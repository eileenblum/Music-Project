In the far horizon a shapeless darkness filled the sky
And slowly with a faint whispering, making the air putrid and unbreathable
The nightshadow came crawling...

The ground was covered by fallen men, their bodies mangled and torn
Upon the Hillside the Final stand, and they knew they would come home no more
A deafening thunder shook the earth and lightning split open the sky
Rain fell like blood when the heavens turned black and the sun slowly withered and died

Engulfing the fallen and standing alike, killing the living and waking the dead
A darkness so black it would make night seem like day covered the hills and the plains
The hearts of the mortals, all but the brightest, turned to stone black as the night
But the brighter the light, the darker the shadow that consumes the source of all life

Trapped by the evil he set out to conquer, his soul now cried out in vain
His mind was twisted and lost in the kingdom where madness and suffering reign

Deformed by the darkness the Nightshade brought
Condemned to be killed but never to die
Forever in torment, chained to the throne
Where the Nightshwadow rules with death on it's side
