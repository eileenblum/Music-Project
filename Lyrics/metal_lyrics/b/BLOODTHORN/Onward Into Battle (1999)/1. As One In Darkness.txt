In the blackened shadows beneath the mistveiled mountains
Dwells an ancient evil of a long forgotten past
Beneath the twisted trees it's hatred is growing stronger
Restrained for an eternity, soon to be unleasehed

Ravaged by a thousand storms
Scarred by the anger of gods
Tainted by a magic foul
Mighty mistveiled mountains

Reaching towards the sky like a thorn that's forged from darkness
A symbol of oppression, a monument of fear
In the tower bloodthorn the unspoken horror breeds
Hidden by the veil of time untouched by the light

Ravaged by a thousand storms
Scarred by the anger of gods
Tainted by a magic soul
In the shadows of mistveiled mountains

"Come to me you pitiful mortal
I sense your presence... and despair
Come to me you pitiful mortal
I thrive upon - upon your fear
Your soul for me, for me your flesh
Your pain and anguish - my life
Joined together, become as one
As one in darkness"

"Summoned by a chanting whisper"
"Your soul for me, for me your flesh"
"Lead astray from the path I follow
Can it be my soul is fading
Lost eternally
Embraced by evil
Surrounded by darkness"

"Come to me you pitiful mortal
I sense your presence... and despair
Come to me you pitiful mortal
I thrive upon - upon your fear
Your soul for me, for me your flesh
Your pain and anguish - my life
Joined together, become as one
As one in darkness"
