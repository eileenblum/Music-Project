The Warmachine...

Blackwinged panzerdemon
Spewing thermonuclear blaze
Pure black omnipresence
Revealing the final essence

Hunter...
You will fall prey to me
Hunted...
No shelter from your destiny

All-out world inferno
Brimstone magma flow
Black clouds raining blood
Total hellfire flood

World war three
The end offensive
None left to witness
None left to grieve
(No soul
No heaven
No Devil
Hell's seven)

A warmachine
Perishing it's blackened path
World roadkill
One being under one will
