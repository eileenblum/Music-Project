Soon shall the sun rise to morning
In glorious northen light
Gods of darkness grant me wisdom
And let the wisdom victor me
March to war!
When the doom is full of sorrow
When the stone is covered with blood
When the winds cry out their wisdom
When the spirits call the dead
When the sun is sunk in slumber
When the moon shines through the light
March to war!
I fear no death, nor the bravest man
Lightning, thunder, tempest, storm
Join me on my march to war
I've fought through the fiery furnace
Through murky Deaths' darkest fields
If the Gods would see me die
I welcome you Death -
When I'm doomed to die...
