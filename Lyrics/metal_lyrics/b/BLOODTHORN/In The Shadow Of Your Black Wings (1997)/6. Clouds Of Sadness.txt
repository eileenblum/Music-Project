Lost in enchanted woods
I can't find the path
My ancestors so solemnly found
Lost in darkness
Afraid without hope
In the sacred forbidden forest
Where sad dreams blow through dark trees
The silence cry out thy name
Clouds of sadness
Begin to rain
I float on the water
Night is so dark
Love is gone
Light is gone
Come dark
Come evil
Come hell
