The cold misty veil of frost
Shadow eternal call
The shapeless twisted darkness
With Aurora Borealis illuminates the northen soil
Among mighty forests
Hills and mountains mightier than
The words of gods - here lies the path
The path to the nightshadow
Through the moonblue night
The dim and dusky light
The nightshadow crawling hunger
A key to the abyss
Here - in the majestic north
Here - the woe of frost
By the bestial might of the mountains
Here - I shall walk as a sheep
To the lair of the wolf
Into infinity
Night call, shadow fall
Unexplored visions in my innermost thoughts
Beasts howls in the ecstasy of hate
The dark tempts me out this night
Summons me to the horrid hate
Such silence - such liberating silence
Here I shall rest throughout eternity
Here - in the shadow of your black wings' embrace
