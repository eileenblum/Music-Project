This is the last time...
The last time I watch the sun rise to blind my eyes
Tonight the dark sky is my roof
And all misty fields my floor
I have found my place to be
By your side; in your arms
You're my bride - I'll die for you
Eosophobic wedlock - forever by your side
I won live to bid you farwell
You're the embodied core of darkness
Pure beauty dressed in black
I feel you are a part of me
Thus I a part of you
Never again shall the light of the day
Come between us and tear us apart
You're the heart of night
And now my heart is yours
Seductive Noctil'uca
Your eyes have never seen the sun
