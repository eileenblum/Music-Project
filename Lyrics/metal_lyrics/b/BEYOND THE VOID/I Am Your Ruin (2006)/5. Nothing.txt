there is nothing
where i were
I've come to feel so not here

prone in ashes
can't bring myself to be
i've lost belief in reality

'cause i can't be
when all i held dear,
that was holding me here
is torn away

anything
i dared to trust
is falling to dust
just leaving me
nothing

i am nothing
with nothing left
to lose, a lifetime to regret

hell, if i'm to lie here alone
shattered and torn
i might as well
go forth and unchain hell

'cause i can't beâ¦

we are brought down by the smallest things
the grains within we can't be without
they rest in silence we rely upon
and broken are our doom

'cause i can't beâ¦

the only thing
i dared to trust
is falling to dust
leaving me
