Never close your eyes
On what you don't want to take place
Never let your mind sway
To be far away

Never shut in your tears
Afraid they would give you away
Never let yourself give in
Without a fight, again and again

They can take you apart
Never break your soul
As long as you're
Defiance to the end
And nothing less

You gotta scratch your deepest
Scream like you never screamed before
Clench your broken fingers
And strike the face to fear

See them swirl around you
Scavengers upon your ruin
Give them no surrender
Hate them âtil they bleed

They can take you apart
Never break your soul
As long as you're
Defiance to the end
And nothing less

I can't save you now
Nothing I can undo
Nothing I can do
Run away from time

Just so far every night
Leave your shade behind
They can take you apart
Never break your soul

Hate them âtil they bleed
Defiance
To the end
