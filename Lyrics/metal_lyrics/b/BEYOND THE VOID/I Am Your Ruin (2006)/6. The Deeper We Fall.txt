So that's how it feels to be buried alive
To be cast into the void
Deeper than all shades of night
With no morning to return to

My bones are forged into the soil
And death just looked away
Finally no-one's left to turn from me

You betrayed me with your nevers and eternals
Every promise breaks a dagger in my soul
Now you're gone there's only one truth left unbroken
The deeper we feel, the deeper we fall

Where hatred is willing, the body complies
Wish I could leave this place behind
Defeat the undefeatable height
To reach a past too far to cling to

I will drag me out of here
If it's the last thing that I'll do
I will scale the skies denied by you

You betrayed me with your nevers and eternals
Every promise breaks a dagger in my soul
Now you're gone there's only one truth left unbroken
The deeper we feel, the deeper we fall

You can't break me whole
Something will endure
Something left to share
As my gift is my fall

You betrayed me with your nevers and eternals
Every promise breaks a dagger in my soul
Now you're gone there's only one truth left unbroken
The deeper we feel, the deeper we fall
