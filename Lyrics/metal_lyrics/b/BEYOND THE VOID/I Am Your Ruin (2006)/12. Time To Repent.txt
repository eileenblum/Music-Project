When I'll have broken you
Will it go away? If all I ever knew was pain
You taught me all I know
You don't seem to pleased I learned so well

You never thought I'd go this far
That I take it so bad
Who could have known that some things just won't heal
And you were deaf too many years

Mercy just isn't you
And will be the end of you
Now that it's time to repent

Let me hear you're sorry now
Swear you've become a different man
Say you've finally seen the light
In the arms of a gun
There is no way out for us
No force on earth could save us now
As we're all victims here
Until the end

You are right, the wounds have sealed
But only those you can see
We h ase
Repent!

Let me hear you're sorry now
Swear you've become a different man
Say you've finally seen the light
In the arms of a gun
There is no way out for us
No force on earth could save us now
As we're all victims here
Until the end

As we're all victims here
Until the end of you
Repent! The streaks will always
Betray the shape of the whip

As the wound bears resemblance to the blade
The fists of fathers
Will surface in their blood
As that what you destroy

Will rise to bring you down
A tragedy we can't explain
Just what could twist a mind
To turn against its kind? Mislead, a victim of vile influence

The songs, the games
We say x is to blame.
