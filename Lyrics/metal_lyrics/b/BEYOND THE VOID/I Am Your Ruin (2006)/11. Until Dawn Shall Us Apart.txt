Stay with me, solitary, whitecold and clean like unfound snow
Let us forget what hides beneath
As we share a loneliness for two

One night closer than ever
Until dawn shall us part
Not alone on the outside
Yet lifetimes apart
All we have is one moment
Until weâll have never known us

Donât let lies spoil our moment
Used once and destroyed, you know the rules
Let us pretend tomorrowâs real
And weâll know our names when the night is through

One night closer than ever
Until dawn shall us part
Not alone on the outside
Yet lifetimes apart
All we have is one moment
Until weâll have never known us

See, our fitting scars
Yet absent hearts
Have met to never know
Youâre but a shell
To lend me warmth
Yet fail to mend my soul

One night closer than ever
Until dawn shall us part
Not alone on the outside
Yet lifetimes apart
All we have is one moment
Until weâll have never known us
