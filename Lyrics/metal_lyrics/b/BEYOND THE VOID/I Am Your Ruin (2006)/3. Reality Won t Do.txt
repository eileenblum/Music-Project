I dream in black and blue
where what I say is true
I won't come out this time
no matter what they do

I lie dead to a world
that never wanted me
locked myself up in here
and swallowed is the key

here I can shape a world
conveniently more real
no god beside myself
my whim to love or kill

I'm gonna live inside a dream
a dream, a dream, a dream,
where mere reality won't do
I dream a life come true

I dream in black and blue
where what I say is true
I won't come out this time
no matter what they do

come spare yourself the fuzz
and bury me alright
just let me drink my dust
and dwell inside my mind

relive my favored nights
make moments disappear
so you're forever mine
or you were never here

I'm gonna live inside a dream
a dream, a dream, a dream,
where mere reality won't do
I dream a life come true

I'm gonna live inside a dream
a dream
where mere reality won't do
a dream

I'm gonna live inside a dream
a dream, a dream, a dream,
where mere reality won't do
I dream a life come true
