Don't believe those eyes that say I'm still like me
That corrosive skin, a mouth like cocaine
Born posthumously

You won't find no one
The only thing left here is you alone
You won't find no one
Whoever you left, they all are gone

Once the pain recedes it all comes naturally
That itching in my head, a mind like formalin
Sustained mechanically

You won't find no one
The only thing left here is you alone
You won't find no one
Whoever you left, they all are gone

You won't find no one
Whatever you did is done

You won't find no one
The only thing left here is you alone
You won't find no one
Whoever you left, they all are gone

You won't find me
