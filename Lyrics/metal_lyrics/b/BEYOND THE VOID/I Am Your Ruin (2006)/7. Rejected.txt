Take these visions away from me
They don't mean anything
You see, my senses have gone blind

You follow a code of no return
Who minds the conformists
We're assassins in a dynasty long dead

Hey you - rejected by this world
You run but you cannot hide
This world is burning
And Iâm gonna make it mine

Let mankind disappear
It's too late anyhow
We're half past dead and forgot how to care

Feel sorry for the things we don't regret
Refused and ostracised
Pray for remission - it's time to break the line

Hey you - rejected by this world
You run but you cannot hide
This world is burning
And Iâm gonna make it mine

Hey you - subtracted from this life
It's time to realise
Our world is dying
To make us feel alive

Hey you - rejected by this world
You run but you cannot hide
This world is burning alive

Hey you - rejected by this world
You run but you cannot hide
This world is burning
And Iâm gonna make it mine

Hey you - subtracted from this life
It's time to realise
Our world is dying
To make us feel alive
