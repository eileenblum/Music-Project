And then we all died
All as one, finally
All is gone
But a memory

A no-mans-memory
With no-ones left behind
No widow's song
No-one to realise

In a beat
The world dies with me
Everything we were
Would ever be

Anything
All mankind falls to waste
Every thought and feel
Has been erased

But how can we leave all behind
When we're grief in no mind? Have we ever been
When we die in no-one's eye? Not I.

And a mind dies just like that, all alone
Thus I'm dead
No trace in anyone
My saced memories

All there was left of you
My deepest oath
To never let it go

In a beat
A world dies with me
Everything we were
Will never be

Anything, everything
All wiped out, without a trace
A world in itself
That can't be replaced

But how can we leave all behind
When we're grief in no mind? Have we ever been
When we die in no-one's eye? Not I.

But how can we leave all behind? Have we been
When we're grief In no mind? Not I
