I can hear you
Even when your tears wonât speak
When you fly from day
When you try to hide in sleep

I can read you
Like a crimson trail
To guide me to your hideaway
So come and shed your gaol

Weâre lost in here
Whatever made us stay
I will take you away from here
Canât leave you here
Whatever they might say
Away is the only way

Iâm awake now
Canât look away no more
Should have read the signs
Should have done this long before

I will cut you
Out of yesterday
Torn-out pages mark our way
So come and raze your veil

Weâre lost in here
Whatever made us stay
I will take you away from here
Canât leave you here
Whatever they might say
Away is the only way

Scarlet letters ring inside
Cries of distress red on white
A silent prayer
Away from here

The end still wet in lines of fate
Even if Iâve come to late
We are safe now
Away from here

Weâre lost in here
Whatever made us stay
I will take you away from here
Canât leave you here
Whatever they might say
Away is the only way
