The sun shall melt away
The end of day
Twilight has begun
I feel it stir inside

A glow we hide
In dusk to lead us on
I feel it take my reigns
And ride my veins

As darkness is reborn
I take those tears from your eyes
Grind them and fling them away

Farewell to light
Reborn to night
We left a life as cold as ice
To blaze inside

In here your velvet skin shall not resist
Your sinful hearts deluge
Black scissors dream a scarlet stream
Sweet sacrilege our night

One for the red of hearts
The grin of shards
To strike the reigns of sin
One for the black inside

To learn tonight
Pleasure does know
Your name
I know despite all words
And deep-set hurt
This moment you are mine

Farewell to light
Reborn to night
We left a life as cold as ice
To blaze inside

In here your velvet skin shall not resist
Your sinful hearts deluge
Black scissors dream a scarlet stream
Sweet sacrilege our night
