Go forth and break me
As I am ruinborn
to fall apart is to become,

to make ends meet me
to break and remend me
I've lost a mind to gain a few
in return

I might be over
more fracture than matter
yet I found a shape in loss
ruinborn

I'd never surrender
any dark chapter
as I am what I've been through
ruinborn

go forth and strip me
there's nothing left to take
no more edens to unmake

my shards define me
here, indivisible
with nothing left I haven't lost before

I might be over
more fracture than matter
yet I found a shape in loss
ruinborn

I'd never surrender
any dark chapter
as I am what I've been through
ruinborn
