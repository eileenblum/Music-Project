Far from these lands
Where gods mercy dosen't reach
where the of the jew shepherd have forgotten
cremated in the flame of hatred

There the love for Adams children
ceased to exist and withered away
The shadow has build his kingdom
and a new black God risen to his glory

We are the black arrow
poisoned by the snake
aimed at holy dove
from the bow of the fallen angel

The ritual of cursing life
we drink the rotten blood,
from the skull of gods creation
with death of believers of Christ in our minds

In the stench of the dead rats
Your burning piety cooled
Your belief is faltering
and once you denial your god...

We are the black arrow
poisoned by the snake
aimed at holy dove
from the bow of the fallen angel
