Born in  Thee, in Thy name
In the serpent of the abyss,
in the spirit of chaos
Cursed before my birth

God isn't watching his image in me,
he couldn't recognise me as one of his kind
In my anger I have closed my heart,
and taken the poison of the serpent

Through lambs blood in to darkness
as a son and a daughter of the Abriman
Show me your way, and I'll walk to the end,
as his spirit, as his voice....

The serpent of the abyss...
My open wounds are bleeding for you, My Lord
The chalice of devotion will have a new content
And at the altar of the morningstar, I drink deep
