Oh, our God Satan
The blackflight of our lives and the all:seeing eye
highest being of the shadow realms
hear, and receive my prayer

Lucifer! The fallen star of the cosmos
Burn away my vanity
Make me pure for you,
as a golden bowl of your spirit
here in the cathedral of the victorious angel
In the black vaults of your temple
With prayers I light the incense
In front of your immense void

Give me your flame
so I can burn as a torch for your glory
for the devotion smouldering in me is great
love that will never die
The path of dedication...
to the infinite emptiness

Lucifer! The fallen star of the cosmos
Burn away my vanity
Make me pure for you,
as a golden bowl of your spirit
here in the cathedral of the victorious angel
In the black vaults of your temple
With prayers I light the incense
In front of your immense void...
