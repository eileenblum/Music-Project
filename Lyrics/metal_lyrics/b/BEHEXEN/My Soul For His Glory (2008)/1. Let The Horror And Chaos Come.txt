World of plagues
Nest of disgusting filth
To be taken to ruin and damnation
All created must be raped

Into the night we whisper a prayer
A black spell full of hate
full of horror and chaos
World will perish in flames

Piece by piece your world will collapse
filling with emptiness
Slipping to the end of your poor life
Slowly but certainly

When the priests rape your children
and fathers kill their families
We stand behind you in the shadow of our Lord
breathing your agony

Let the horror and chaos come
Let it flow freely through me,
like a black rapid stream
full of your immense hatred
