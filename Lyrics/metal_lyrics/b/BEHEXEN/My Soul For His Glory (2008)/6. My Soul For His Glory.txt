I believe in the one clandestine
and the unspeakable Lord,
and in the star amongst stars,
of which black flame
we all have been created,
and in to where we all will return.

The secret of secrets in his name, Lucifer!
I believe in the one convenant
of the darkness, light, life and death.
In the temple of the black star,
and in its mysteries.
And I believe in the sepent,
the poisoner of the lion, in his name, Satan...

The hands squeezed in to the prayer of devotion,
The wind directed in to the black triangle,
The mystery of the matter.
With ceverence I kneel...
my soul for his victory...

A father of man, bring your bright torch for us,
and fill our temple with your infinite wisdom.
Guide us to you, in to the dark walls of the cosmos
Away from life, away from light, under your wings...
