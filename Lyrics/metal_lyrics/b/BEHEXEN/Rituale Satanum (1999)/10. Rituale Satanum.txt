Rituale Satanum... Silver dagger of ritual sacrifice.
Night so gloomy and silent. Seven demons of Hell gathered.
Waiting blood... waiting the soul. Rituale Satanum.
Mighty Baphomet whispers my name. Calling me towards the dark side.
My biggest sacrifice. I give you my soul... tonight!


Thanks to pale_mafia for sending track #6 lyrics.
