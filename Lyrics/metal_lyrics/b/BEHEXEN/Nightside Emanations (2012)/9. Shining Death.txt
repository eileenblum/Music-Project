There lies one pure truth in the world,
There was at the beginning
And shall be in the end
The all-reaping and ending force
Death...

"wherever you look, I am there
In the North, South, East and West
As above so below
Worsip me, for as I am... the Universe"

Why bow down to death, war and mayhem?
Because you shall not be offered lies
But only the truth
The absolute and unswerving

Life is only within this moment
But Satan the destroyer is eternal
And luminous abyss
Appear before us - Nimbus of death

"Come with me, sons of Saturn
Tear to pieces this ugly form called the world
make it as an image of me..."

There lies one pure truth in the world,
There was at the beginning
And shall be in the end
The all-reaping and ending force
Death...

In the age od Capricorn
I can see the world hanging from your horns
Upside down, leaking and dead
I kneel before you, Oh Satan
Make me your son of Death
