Circle me - Samael
Circle me - Lilith
Circle me - Azazel
Circle me - the King

You who laid down your bloody hand on my shoulder
The feeling it left is deeply rooted
in the heart and riverbeds of the soul
From where it shall never disappear

Circle me - Samael
Circle me - Lilith
Circle me - Azazel
Circle me - the master

Open the path to the nightside thrones
Embody your spirit in me
The flaming triangle: Father, mother and son
My body is the flesh-temple
Of Zabulus the king!

Let me drink your crimson wine
From the cup of damnation
It is like death, the well of the netherworld
Boiling, full of grief and pain

But i have to walk to the end
Search for your lost wisdoms
Explore every cave
It will be joyless, it will be lightless...
And it will be a lonesome journey

Everything dies in your hands, as do I
I'll Vanish in your seas
From where i'll rise once more
So be it...
I'll walk with my body whipped
Along on your black sinister path
Carrying the cross of Saturn
On the withered leaves of life

Circle me - Samael
Circle me - Lilith
Circle me - Azazel
Circle me - in the void
