Vanity has wilted the world
Taken Man away from the gods
The fruit in their hands turn to sand
Our time has come to an end
The beginning of a new age
The keys of the second coming
Ready to be taken
Ready to open the ingrained locks

An ardorous light from the unknown
Like a lighthouse in the abyss of the night
The magical eye of the great dragon
Deep, deep in the soul of the lost one

Awaken Tiamat!

Rise, thou flaming one!
The first ocean and the mother
Death, chaos and liberator
Rise O Goddess of black blood
Dragon known by many names
Thy dark dream hath come to an end
Thy path out of the abyss lieth open
Serpent of The Black Fire

Set thy children on fire
Lead them on thy ominous path
Through thy womb, until the end
Towards the black star of Lucifer
