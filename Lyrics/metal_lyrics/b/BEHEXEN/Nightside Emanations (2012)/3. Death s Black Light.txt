Ominous currents have begun to stir
And awaken the dormant senses in man
A shadow of the masters tree spreading
The Kliffotic jaws are open

Death's black light
Shine on me...

Can you hear it's heavy beat?
The pulse of the black dragon
Fulfilled with new obscure power
Stolen from the Sephirotic side

The abyss shows it's face
Feed the roots of the Tree of Death
It's branches crush the strings of lies
And reveal our terrifying God
The time of re-awakening is at hand
In your wisdom, Lord of the other side

Towards the new dawn we'll walk
Across the flaming path of Satan
With the love of Death
And hearts like a flaming pentagram
