On this important night of the year
I speak again those obscure words
This thime, there is more rapture
More assertiveness in my voice

I step closer to the border
Approaching the kliphothic deep
And fortify my prayer
With full dedication on my lips

Wth my will i command
May the stone move aside
From the mouth of the tunnel
And let the venom of our God run free

Vibrations in the air
The burning breath of the demon
O reflection of the chaotic sea
Follow the command of my chants

In the temple of the silent curses
I spread the terror of darkness
Spitting the venom of our awesome God
In the face of Creation

" Veni Belsebuth, per Adonai Sathanas,
Adonai Lucifer, Adonai Azazel!
Veni Belsebuth, per Adonai Sathanas,
Adonai Lucifer, Adonai Azazel!"

In the temple of the silent curses
I spread the terror of darkness
Spitting the venom of our awesome God
In the face of Creation
