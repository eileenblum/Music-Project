Your temple was formed in silence
In a time that man does not know
Slowly rooted in the depths of
The spiritual rocks of this black soil
Slowly desolating
The world of limitations
Eating the poisoning the alliance
Between the man and the creator
Rise. Tyrant of the luminous darkness!

With all the shadows you are held back with
Release the 11 rivers of poison
Upon the world of white illusions
I praise thee the Dragon of outer darkness
The merciless one, ruler of the black Gods
Strike your sword at the heart of the earth
Cutting open the dimensions to you

Hail Satan-Molok!
Apocalyptic monument of change
Reveal unto us your altar upon which
The world with stars shall be sacrificed
