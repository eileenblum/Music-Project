I raised the wand of shadows
Towards the eastern gates
And called for the night wind to rise
And penetrate the ego's walls

The winds of Belzebuth
The tempest of Satanic truth
Empower this tool of shades
To the nightside of my mind

Wield it as your living limb
As a black poison fang
Which tears open the mask
Unveiling the forms in darkness

Filled with devouring storm
It slits my fiery eyes open wide
And binds the sight of the spiritless clay

It seals my ears from the lies
So I can reach out for your voice in silence
In the stroke of the raven wings

The dreadful storm of emptiness
The king of void and Death
Whose name bears the power
To destroy the kingdom of God!
