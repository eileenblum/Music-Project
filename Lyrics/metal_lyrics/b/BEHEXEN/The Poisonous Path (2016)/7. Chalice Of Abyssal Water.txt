Through the gates of west, the rising tide billows
The primal sea of raging Chaos
Raising the element of dark water
Beast of the great ocean of night
Tear down the veil between you and me
And reveal your throne, O Leviathan!

From beyond all worlds
And from beyond all times
Come with your wrathful aspects
Let go of from your own tale
And let the circle be broken
And bless this raised grail, full of your elixir

May your gnosis touch this vibrant grail
Toast of liberation, the womb of night
Raised in your pitch black darkness
Dragon of racing sea of death
Set this magical weapon afire
With your sinister light
And bestow your powers on it
Great dragon of western gates, Leviathan

From beyond all worlds
And from beyond all times
Come with your wrathful aspects
Let go of from your own tale
And let the circle be broken
And bless this raised grail, full of your elixir

I'm drowning in this chalice
Which has been shaped into your dreadful image
Into this vast, arcane sea of emptiness
Whose deep currents I shall once dwell...
