I face the southern throne of Lucifer
And invoke the all-consuming blaze
Black Promethean fire
Destroyer of sephirotic illusions

Falling star of forbidden knowledge
Illuminating furnace of Kliphotic depths
Touch this steel with your flaming tongue
Forge an iron bridge to your realm

Lucifer's scalding blade brightens
And slits a passage through every thing
Cutting open the reeking lairs of lies
Bringing forth nothing but the truth

This dagger of Satanic darkness
Shall sever the manacles of imprisonment
And cut the chains of life
The impulse of Godly light

Hail the king of the black illuminating fire!

Rise, rise, rise!

Fiery sword of my Satanic will
Transcending all dualities
Liberator and destroyer
A piece of your essence on the table of art
My lord and black light, Lucifer!
