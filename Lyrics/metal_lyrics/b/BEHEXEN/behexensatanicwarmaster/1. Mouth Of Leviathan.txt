Now, open wide the mouth of Leviathan
and free Your wrathful shadows the formless beasts
of Your flame.

Like a fog they rise from the face of the earth
as your cold and freezing hand
Faithfully haunting the souls.

The disciples of your path prepared for your magnificent coming
momumental era of chaos the inverted dawn of creation
Hungry God of the depths...Release the death.
