The fist forged of black metal
by the hammer imperegnated with hate
In the smithy spitting the black flames
In darkness the glory of Satan in our minds

With the iron fists and the will to use
them we are wandering in the storm of violence
With the hateful hits desecrating your flesh
With the claws black as those of
a crow tearing the human faces apart

Fist of the Satanist
-crushes joy and light
Fist of the Satanist
-crushes the weak and degenerated
Fist of the Satanist
-crushes the good and clean
Fist of the Satanist
-crushes the heaven

The blood of my enemy on the ground
is reminding what happened to those
who arose against our darkness
The wrath of Satan in these hands
we strike with hate and kill with hate
The violent mutilation of the christian face

The filth you learned from the book of
lies will lead you in your destiny at the
end of the road where we'll be waiting
for you and there will we execute our
twisted dreams!
