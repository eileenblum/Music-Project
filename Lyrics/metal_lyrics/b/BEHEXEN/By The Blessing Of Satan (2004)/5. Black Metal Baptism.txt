I chose the blackest robe
Shadow, darkness before the light
I threw away the false life
artificial and worthless
I kept only the deep mysteries of Satan

Black metal baptism opened the gates
to darkness and gave me the powers
of sorcerers
The sign of black pentagram
burned deep in my heart...

Satan! come forth...
in this black metal night
Master! bless this art...
dedicated only for you

The new cult has risen
from the ruins of the failed
The true black metal spirit
has never died...
