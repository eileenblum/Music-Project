Cursed I am with the wrath of lord Satan
Blessed I am with the unholy power
O' Father of Hell...
grant me immortality and let me be one
proud spirit in your legion
I am wandering in the path of darkside...
under the eye of lord Lucifer!

The gates are opening to me
Now I can understand the hidden secrets
All is so clear to me...

Satan! grant us the emotions
to explore our way along the darkened path
We dedicated our souls to you
and work for your kingdom

In nomine dei nostri Satanas
Luciferi exelsi!
