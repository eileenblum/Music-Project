And again is the easter night
celebration of victory and absence
year by year my heart delights
the death of semitic Christ

Gather the congregation of darkness
witches and worshippers of grand evil
in the cradle of gloominess
we rise the overflowing chalice

In this night we embrace
the ways of the flesh
and the wisdom of the serpent!

Celebration of Christ's Fall!

Rise! Rise up from the depths
the beings of the night
to celebrate with us
All evil spirits rise!
Rise from this magic ring
to honour the true God
God of all sorcerers, SATAN!!!
