Hear, the song is praising our Lord.
Him who arrived with death,
Him who hurls nation of doom.
Him who betrayed your God.

He is Satan, and he is the one!
Glory be for ye Lord!
Glory be to Satan!

Behold, the lord is mighty.
We are fulfilling of his strength.
Angels tremble before Him.
And the semitic heart frozens.
I am not a lamb but a servant.
Under His sleepless eye.
A fist of hate, a seed of evil.
A parson of shadow and damnation.
