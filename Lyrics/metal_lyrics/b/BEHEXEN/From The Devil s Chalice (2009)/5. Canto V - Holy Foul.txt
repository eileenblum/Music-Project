My hand is clenched in fist.
Not of bitterness but of hate.
The dreadful smell of the holy stench.
You foul are looking at me in my eyes.
What can you see from my fiery eyes?
Look deeper, your are watching Him in his eyes.
You won't see life nor light.
You'll see only black emptiness.

Dead inside, possibly but there is fire in my heart.
Your empty words can not put it out but your tears will only make the flames increase.
Turn and walk awaw you holy foul.
My life's been sealed for the Devil.
I have thrown away the pathetic presence that your God offered.

Eternal life in the abyss belongs to me.
In the endless depths of the cosmos.
Side by side with Satan's throne forever.
