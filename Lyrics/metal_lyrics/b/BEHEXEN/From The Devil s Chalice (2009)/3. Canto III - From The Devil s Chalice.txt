Hands covered in black veil are preparing the dark altar sanctified silverware on black velvet.
Ancient litanies, those once lost are whispered in the shadows.
Read in silence...

From the Devil's chalice I drink the poisoned blood.
From the Devil's chalice I fulfill and become one with him.
Your sign... Burned in my soul!
Your blood... Running in my veins!
