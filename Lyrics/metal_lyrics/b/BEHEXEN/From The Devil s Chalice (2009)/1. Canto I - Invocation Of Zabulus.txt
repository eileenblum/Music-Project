Black candles ignite.
Sweet odouring incense is thickening the oppressive air.
The call of the serving spirit.
The silent prayer begins.

Servants of the secret temple.
The order of the fivepointed star.
Under the black sky.
In the light of the moon in the Scorpio and thousands of serpent-eyes.
Invocation of the Master Lucifer.
Bringer of black light and the angel of the dead star.

Hear our call! Hear our worship! Deus Zabulus Dominus!
Arise O Lucifer, from the depths of the abyss, from caches of darkness, from occupying shadows.
You are our Lord and Father.
We honour and worship You!
