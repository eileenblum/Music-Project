No more are the walls of flesh holding back your black aureoles.
Exhailing from pain and hatred.
Cold and impure words.

Wine of the Devil stains the skin.
But pain won't impregnate your thirst.
As a castle of demonic possession.

As black and ghastly.
As cold but not dead, feeling nothing inside.
Only emptiness only the cold void.
4 Void has conquered and devoured everything.
In the deserted and gloomy halls of my soul, echoes only your word. I am Belial!

As black and ghastly. As cold but not dead, feeling nothing inside.
Only emptiness only the cold void.
