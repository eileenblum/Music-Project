[Merry-Pippin:]
"Freeful but with no sure path
We wander through Fangorn
The Uruk-Hai dead now they are
By spears from eorlingas

We walk until a bright
As ground is steeply rising
Then we climb up some rocky stairs
Expecting for a chance"

An unknown and sudden voice
Merry, Pippin and an ageless form
Hope reborns, the Quest gets on the road!

Till the Entwash they went on!
The Derndingle followed as a way for channelling force
An awakening for all the Ents!
Down the green Methedras should be settled up...

...The Entmoot!!!
So in some more days
Wrathful Ent forces will enter Isengard
Saruman in terror will fall!!!
And Orthanc will be a sure weight less
For Freedom to come!

Great longing came over them
For faces and voices
For Frodo and the Fellowship
For Gandalf and Strider

Then the Entmoot raised
But only for a while
Now Bregalad will accompany
Them until the departure

Suddenly voices emerged!
Drum redoubles sounds of rage!!!

The Final EntÂ´s March
Began always towards Isengard
[Treebeard:]
"We are off to face the Doom
To hew the stones and to break the doors!!!"
The awakening of the whole Forest was done

Nan CurunÃ­r
Will fall down
Down!!!
