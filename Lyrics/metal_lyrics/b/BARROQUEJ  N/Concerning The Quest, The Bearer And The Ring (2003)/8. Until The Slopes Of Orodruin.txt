Kirith Ungol now stayed behind
[Frodo:] "Aiya Elenion Ancalima!"
Frodo cried loud at the devilry door
Guarded by the will of darkened Watchers

A bell clang emerged while the hobbits
Wanted to cross the high bridge of stone
Iron-shed, feet sounded, Frodo decided
Falling down from it was the last option!

First Sam fell, Frodo at last,
Landing into a tangle of thorny bushes
Then the hobbits followed
Their march towards the north
To Morgai!!!

To the left and towards the south
The hobbits felt the battle so far away
[Sam:]
"Up there in the world,
The darkness is somehow vanishing!"
Ribbons of Light!!!

A sharpened scream was everywhere heard
The Lord NÃ¢zgul facing his cruel doom
Signs of Good even though the heavy Ring
Weights, more and more!

Heartened by sharing a wafer of lembas
Soon they'd be provided by water and light
That's the moment where (the) course changed
Now to the East they went!!!

Still far, but in course, from Orodruin
Forty miles would be covered up
In sorrowful long march

The Eye is now restless
What meaning or significance
Can have a reduced group leaded by strikers...?

...Facing the front of the Great Evil Empire
The Lord of Dark does not know how to act

He is suspicious but somehow his Eye is not here
Frodo and Sam are omitted!!!

Frodo and Sam, courageous hobbits!!!
Now they are in front of having their Quest achieved!!!
They take off their useless orquish clothing
Periannath will rewrite out Middle Earth's Destiny!!!
