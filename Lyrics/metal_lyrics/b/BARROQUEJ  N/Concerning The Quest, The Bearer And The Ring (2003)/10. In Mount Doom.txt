At twenty miles away, towards the Isenmouthe narrows
The hobbits swung east
A long walk march through the evil and dreadful Mordor
Heart of the Dark...

...Suddenly a noise arose
Marching feet plus two big Uruks
[Uruk:] "You now should have been inside UdÃ»n"
Raised up and to the row are now the hobbits

Faith goes away
The wrath arrives
The aim so close
Frodo be rough!

Just on time an unexpected relief came
The troops are confused
Sam sneaked away towards a shallow pit
Next to him Frodo

And the grey morning arrived
To the southeast the Mountain straightened up
They undertook the final march
Pulling orc helmets and shields away

The Orodruin is faced finally
Crawling arrived there the brave hobbits
The very last stage, struggling for the Quest
Soon they will see the way that goes
Towards Sammath Naur!

They finally reached the issued road
That leaded to the Chambers of Fire
The Bearer looked to Barad-dÃ»r
And it was like a stab!

The Eye did not discovered them now
They can still continue the path
Although if it is on the shoulders of Sam!

Turning a wondrous bending of the path!
A sudden wrathful stroke arises from Gollum!

With fury, Frodo prevailed and dismissed them:
[Frodo:] "Farewell Sam, course up I'll go"
He turned to went on and then fade away!!!

The forgiveness for Gollum
And Sam goes up searching for the Bearer
In ascense the path he covers
Until reaching the doors of the caves

Darkness asphyxs
While Sam enters to the dreary caves
He calls loud for Frodo
The silence confirms the horror

But suddenly a violent voice arise
[Frodo:] "I won't make it the Ring is mine"
Frodo shouted as he vanished

But just in time a shade slipped in
Gollum went directly for the Ring
Bordering the abyss
Two ring-slaves will fight blindly

Hissing and with more fury
Gollum mutilated him, (and) repossessed his precious

Dancing and stepping too far
He wavered and in shriek fell
And everything ended
The Ring is smelted!
