[Bilbo:]
"Bright and fair mornings
Cool and clear the evenings
Here in Imladris

While days slip away
Forget about pains
(The) Perils and dreadful paths may be away

And night after day, have graceful living
Talking endlessly as summer end

Let soothing air of safe Rivendell
Leads you to longing of good days

Let me be the one to stay near you...

Hopes for a better Quest
Take care of yourself
And dare the Black Lord
And destroy the One Ring

Forevermore I'll pray
Frodo, for our deeds
And for (the) Magic to rise
Till then I will expect your arrival... oh!

I will stay in safe here next to the good elves
Wishing you the best as all the rest
Don't forget to bring any old songs or tales
I'll do my best with my book in return

Let soothing air of safe Rivendell
Lead us to longing of the good days

May your journey have a good end.

Have hopes for a better Quest
Take care of yourself
And dare the Black Lord
And destroy the One Ring

Forevermore I'll pray
Frodo, for our deeds
And for (the) Magic to rise
Till then I'll expect your arrival...

... With morning mist and endless bright!!!

Farewell friend, don't forget to return...
Someday...."
