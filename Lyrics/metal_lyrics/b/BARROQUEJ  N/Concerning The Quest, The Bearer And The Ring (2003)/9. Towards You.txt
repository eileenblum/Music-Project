[Sam:]
"Although (the) threat and fear
Countless wounds, endless tears
I'll always keep your way
Even until the death

I'll contain your grief in my heart
May my love for you help on your deed

Where's the hope
For us to find
Let now the light
Be our sure guide

Where's the bright
And all we've left behind
May your will
Be our last key...

Now we'll face the last stage
And the struggle for the Quest
Even if there's no return
I'll stay with you

Though my heart weep in tears
For your painful and risky deed
Master Frodo I'll always be
Towards you..."
