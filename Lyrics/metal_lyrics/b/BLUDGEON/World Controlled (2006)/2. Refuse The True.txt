Penetrating affection
The sensation overcomes you
Everyday seems like the last
It's time to face the truth

Slipping away opportunity slowly fades
Sucked in your world turns black exposed you weakened and afraid
Sucked in your world turns black imprisoned blinded by your rage
Sucked in your world turns black forcing you to relive everyday
Sucked in your world turns black

Whoever thought it would end like this
Sucked in your world turns black your lost faith you walked away
Sucked in your world turns black

Accept the fucking facts
You will not hold me back
Your hate has you enslaved
Leaving you to feel betrayed you're the one who betrayed motherfucker

Refuse the truth I will not fucking change
Refuse cut loose take off the fucking chains
Refuse abuse I'm not your fucking slave
Refuse to lose no longer kept restrained
Bias I will not be controlled

Slipping away opportunity slowly fades
Sucked in your world turns black exposed you weakened and afraid
Sucked in your world turns black

Accept the fucking facts
You will not hold me back
Your hate has you enslaved
Leaving you to feel betrayed

Refuse the truth I will not fucking change
Refuse cut loose take off the fucking chains
Refuse abuse I'm not your fucking slave
Bias I will not be controlled
