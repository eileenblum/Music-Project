Rebirth from darkness
Watching the fires grow
The dead have risen chaos controls

Armies of corpses
Hunger within
Unlashing terror carnage begins

Bodies unfold staring at black-skies
Mutilated flesh giving the dead new life
Lifeless remains on which zombies feed
Hunt or be hunted now you believe

Half eaten corpses will rise again
Hungry to feed on the living luring
Millions to their deaths screaming for help within your last breath
Now that you're infected hunger setting up
Upon my resurrection
I live to walk again

Bodies unfold staring at black-skies
Mutilated flesh giving the dead new life
Lifeless remains on which zombies feed
Hunt or be hunted now you believe
Now you believe now you believe
Do now you believe

Armies of corpses
Hunger within
Unlashing terror carnage begins
