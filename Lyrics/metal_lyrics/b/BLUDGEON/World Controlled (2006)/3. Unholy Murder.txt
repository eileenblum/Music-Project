They watch your blood run dry
As you walk without fear
Hiding behind the ignorance
Of evil that appears

I prey upon the weak
To institute a crime
Set free their souls within
Eternity is mine
Inner remorse
Your cries unanswered
Tightening the ropes
Destined to take your life

You'll beg for mercy
From sacrifice
Unholy murder
Of human life

You'll beg for mercy
From sacrifice
Unholy murder
Of human life

Unholy murder
Unholy murder
Unholy murder
Fuck human life

The loss of freedom
The loss of life
I'll slit your throat and watch the blood run dry
I'll watch the blood run dry
I'll watch the blood run dry
I'll watch the blood run dry
I'll watch the blood run dry
