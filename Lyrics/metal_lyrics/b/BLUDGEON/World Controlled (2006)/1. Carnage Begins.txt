A blood lust cures the thirst I keep
With intent to prey upon the weak addicted
I crave the taste of fear

As death grows more victims will appear
With each breath you feel the grasp of fear
Sweat drips covering your face terrified afraid o what
I'll find closing my eyes letting my rage blind...

Cemeteries filling up
As the bodies multiply
Manifest with no remorser for life
On a killing spree evidence is hard to find

Disguised by hypocrisy
No motive for disfiguring
10 nameless bodies found
Decapitated with no limbs buried under ground
A blood lust cures the thirts I keep
With intent to prey upon the weak addicted
I crave the taste of fear

As death grows more victims will appear
You try so hard but you can not replace
The memories that you once embraced
A hollow shell can not erase the past
Drowned your sorrows in an empty glass...

Cemeteries filling up
As the bodies multiply
