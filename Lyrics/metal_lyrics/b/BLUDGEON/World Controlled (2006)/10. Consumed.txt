My blood boils, clenching my fists with rage
Revealing my hostility
Should I embrace this hate
Clouding my thoughts with anger
As my impatience grows
Uncertain of the outcome
No sense of self-control
Cold eyes stare, hollow and empty
Trying to erase the past, replace the envy
Antagonistic peace of shit, so full of bitterness
Integrity is what you lack
Disgraceful, your pleasantry
A shallow senseless ploy
You try to see if I'll fight back
Impulsive, relentless and full of mal intent
Sheltered and anchored within you
Complex, with animosity I don't know what the fuck you want from me
Is this just part of an excuse
Clouding my thoughts with anger
Clenching my fists with rage
Uncertain of the outcome
The loss of self-control, control
