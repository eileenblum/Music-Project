Cold stares shatter like glass
The emptiness surrounds you
Reflecting on the past
Change the road you're on

Conditiones to live one way
Separate and break away
Break this mold they've made for you
Re-create and find the truth

We are all part of the same struggle
Just fighting to stay alive
We should be on the same level
Why can't we see eye to eye

Conditiones to live one way
Separate and break away
Break this mold they've made for you
Re-create and find the truth

Boundless and bare we struggle
Striving through obscurity
Our heritage battered half-sunken and shattered
All for one's fortune and greed

We're all part of the same struggle
Just fighting to stay alive
We should be on the same level
Why can't we see eye to eye
