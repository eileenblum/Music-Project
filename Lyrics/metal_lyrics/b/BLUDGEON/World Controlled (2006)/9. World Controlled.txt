It's in the air we breath
Within the lies you read
This is what we create
Accepting soulless hate
A world controlled be greed
As if for life you'll bleed
There's nowhere left to run
Punishment has just begun

Our world
Our blood
Our fate corrupting me with hate
Our world
Our blood
Our fate

There's so much more at stake
I stand alone an empty space called
Existing only to be a step beyond
Was greed pain death torments me
Was greed pain death torments me
Can I escape this isolation am I awake a cold tired state
Should I believe that what I see is true
Or should I turn and walk away from you you you from you...
I stand alone and empty space called
Existing only to be a step beyond
