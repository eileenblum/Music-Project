Screams they surround you,
Only to be pleased
Erotic satisfaction,
My dominating need

Many cry in sorrow,
Many still believe
Beg to see tomorrow,
Begging as you slowly bleed

See her eyes before you,
Weep tears of blood
Shed away the anger,
Repair what has been done!

Watching as you bleed,
It takes away my pain
Making me feel sane,
Cure my sanity

Creature of insanity,
Born to sacrifice
Creature of humanity,
Forged through Satan's eyes

Watching as you bleed
Hear your fucking screams,
Take away the pain!
Take away the pain!

Many cry in sorrow,
Many still believe
Beg to see tomorrow,
Begging as you slowly bleed

See her eyes before you,
Weep tears of blood
Shed away the anger,
Repair what has been done!

Repair what has been done!
Repair what has been done!
Repair what has been done!
