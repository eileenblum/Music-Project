A painted portrait,
Stained in blood
This is a painting,
Of my love...

Gone, gone, gone!

I can't explain,
It's killing me
Am I to blame?
It's you or me

I am addicted,
To living flesh
Am I alone?
My fear of death

Can you describe, being burned alive?
Can you feel it, rip you from inside...?

Rip, rip, rip!

A painted portrait,
Stained in blood
This is a painting,
Of my love...

Stained in blood
Stained in blood
Stained in blood
Stained in blood

You're wanting to die!
You're wanting to die!
You're wanting to die!

Forgive them, For killing!

Stained in blood
Stained in blood
Stained in blood
Stained in blood
