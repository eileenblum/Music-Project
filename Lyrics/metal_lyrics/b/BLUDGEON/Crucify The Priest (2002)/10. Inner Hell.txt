Can you predict,
The pain of knowing what's inside?
Twisted psychotic vision,
Thoughts of suicide?

Revelation of the future
Blood beyond belief

You feel the nails,
Driven in your chosen one
He is the one you say
Killed the antichrist

Suicide slow coming
Onslaught of flesh and blood
Releasing your soul
Your cries no longer feared

He is the one you say
Killed the antichrist
Savior of life.... Jesus Christ!

Pray for the holy one!
Pay for sins!
Pray for the holy one!
Pray...alone...your soul...
you'll pay!

Unbound...
Walk through the valley of hatred
Renounce...
Know when your savior is gone
Your Cries...
Hatred within your eyes
Repent...
Know when you're savior is gone

Can you predict,
The pain of knowing what's inside?
Twisted psychotic vision,
Thoughts of suicide?

Your pain!
Your pain!
