Revolving obstacle
Another raw deal
Understand my pain
Try to accept it's real

Can you hear the voices?
Do you feel the stares?
Watch them try to break you
Because you don't care!

You don't care!

Keep your life, I don't want it
I'll never be like you!
Keep your life, I don't need it
I'm revived without you!

Keep your life, I don't want it
I'll never be like you!
Keep your life, I don't need it
I'm revived without you!

Can you hear the voices?
Do you feel the stares?
Watch them try to break you
Because you don't care!

Can you hear the voices?
Do you feel the stares?
Watch them try to break you
Because you don't care!


Keep your life, I don't want it
I'll never be like you!
Keep your life, I don't need it
I'm revived without you!

Without you!
