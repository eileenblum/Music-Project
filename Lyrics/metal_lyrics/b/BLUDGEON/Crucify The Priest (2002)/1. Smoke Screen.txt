The button's been pushed
Five hours left to live
Chaos all around
As you prepare...to die

Look to the sky
You long to see light
Sit and laugh
Watch the earth

Regress
Destruction awaits
Futile mass, divine aphasia morality,
No longer exists

Struggling, striving existence!

Burning flame
Scream in pain
Intense heat
Smoke screen!

Nothing is left
Nothing but death
No one survives
The smoke screen!

Burning flame
Scream in pain
Know one survives
The smoke screen!

Incarcerate
Incandescent light
Feel the fire start to burn
As you prepare to die!

Choke!
