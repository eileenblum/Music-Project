Darkness, buried beneath it all
Gripping solitude
Empty souls, with tears of blood
Violence consumes

Scarified, randomly
Hidden behind the lies
Reclusive, suffering
Just to rectify

Tortured through lies!
Tortured through lies!

Mortified, the bleeding souls
Flourish from the ground

Begging for forgiveness
In a god...who's never found!

Darkness, buried beneath it all
Gripping solitude
Empty souls, with tears of blood
Violence consumes

Scarified, randomly
Hidden behind the lies
Reclusive, suffering
Just to rectify

Tortured through lies!
Tortured through lies!
