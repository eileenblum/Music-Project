You feel the pressure building
You feel the walls cave in
All around you so much tension
Someone to pull the string

Reality sets in
Realizing it's not a dream
Wake up and face the truth
Release me, set me free!

Can't take the pain
I feel the strain
Drive me insane
With pressure

Can't take the pain
I feel the strain
Drive me insane
It was you!

It was you!
You mother fucker!

Blasphemy,
Conflicting,
Between heaven and hell

Release me, set me free
In the eyes of god..

You feel the pressure building
You feel the walls cave in
All around you so much tension
Someone to pull the string!
