In the dark emptiness
My soul bleeds pain
Through the suffering
Life is drained

To release the anger
Anger that builds
Violent screams of victims
Are echoing within...within!

Scorn, scorn, scorn, scorn!

Looked on as one
Violence becomes
A vision of blood
Judge and jury!

A vagrant to some
Warned I will come
Warfare's begun,
Judge and jury!

Looked on as one
Violence becomes
A vision of blood

A vagrant to some
Warned I will come
Warfare's begun!

Warfare's begun!
Warfare's begun!

You've been warned,
I will come!

Hate!
