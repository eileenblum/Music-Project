The punishment
You pay with your blood
Another victim
Death is a drug

The afflictions
Not dreams in your mind
The punishment
You will die!

Your ignorance
Appeases me
Your suffering
My ecstasy

You want to live
Beg for your life
The punishment
You will die!

Impale your corpse
Prolong decay
Preserve your flesh
Before you rot away

[Repeat]
-Let them take you away

The punishment
You pay with your blood
Another victim
Death is a drug

The afflictions
Not dreams in your mind
The punishment
You will die!

Impale your corpse
Screaming, bleeding
Beg for your life!
