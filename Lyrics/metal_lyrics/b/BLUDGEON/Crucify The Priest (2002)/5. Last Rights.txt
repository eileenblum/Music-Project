Father forgive them
They mean no harm
They know not what they do
Or what they've done

Suicide and murder
You pay your last respects
Hundreds more will follow
Unexplainable death

Searching for salvation
You're reaching for the light
Nothing but darkness
Nothing in sight

Take a look through my eyes
Does it look the same?
Can you pull the trigger?
End your life in vain?

In vain, in vain, in vain?

No burning desire
No will to live
Constant denial
Rejection lives

[Repeat]

You must reach deep within
Reach deep...you'll find
Your life... is worth living
Not a waste of time!

Awakening, no demise!

Awakening, no more lies!
