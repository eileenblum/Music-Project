Inside this hell
Empty thoughts imprison me
Revealing all
That's left internally

Am I alive, what has become of me?
Have I just died, has life swallowed me?

Push me, to the edge; I'll push back!
Shut down, with lies; React!

[Repeat]

Judging me by what you see
In your mind you envy me
You're smiling to my face
In my back you push the blade

Inside this hell
Empty thoughts imprison me
Revealing all
That's left internally

Am I alive, what has become of me?
Have I just died, has life swallowed me?

Push me, to the edge; I'll push back!
Shut down, with lies; React!

[Repeat]

Reach back inside of me
Reach back inside of me
Reach back inside of me
Reach back inside!

Reach, reach, reach, reach!

Inside this hell
Empty thoughts imprison me
Revealing all
That's left internally
