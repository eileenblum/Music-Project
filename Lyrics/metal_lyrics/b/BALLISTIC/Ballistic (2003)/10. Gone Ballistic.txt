You think youre ready for me
You think you've got me down
In place of, humilliation,
I'll tear you down and left to die

Now whose the one who hears the laughter
Now whose the one who feels the pain
You better watch your step all hell to pay
I'm the man of your creation

And I'm the man within the monster
You dare, you die
You fuck with me its right between the eyes
You wont hear from me, you wont see me at all
Nwow that I decide 
Just one more word, one word will put me on the edge
Gone Ballistic

You want to murder all of me
Look into the face of hell
What say you, I'll break you
Just ling to see the look into my eyes

Destroy the man who stands beside me
Destroy the man that I became
Now this will be your dying day

I'm the man of your creation
And I'm the man within the monster
You dare, you die
You fuck with me its right between the eyes
You wont hear from me, you wont see me at all
Nwow that I decide 
Just one more word, one word mah bitch
Gone Ballistic

The first thing that I'm gonna do 
Is step outside of reason
And set my sights on all of you 
Who rip down and burn
I've got my gun I'm ready to snap I need
That fire from you 
I've gone ballistic

I stood in silence, wont take in anymore
Spoiled little bulley, bleeding on the floor
Ha! Ha!
I've snatched a victory from defeat
And taken my revenge
Hoooo, Hooooo, Heeeee, Hurrrrrr

Come see the blood on my hands
Come see my war
Their lives have run through a river of pain
See what the made me, a bringer of pain and the 
Suffering done
