I'm watching your style, watching your pace
I'll wipe that smile of your fucking face in no time
Cause I can see through, right behind
The narrow shiftless eyes of an habitual liar

And they, (they) they call me evil
And they, (they) they know im right
It's a shame you have fallen
To the hands of the underworld
Shame you can't prey into the valley of the king

Well you aint't the worse than I've seen
Like a bad dream, I'll take a piece of you right 
Out a piece of me to break down
But all the people you've taken
And shattered their dreams
When I count the cost you'll see
It's a principal that I bring
No mercy in my veins

And they, (they) they call me evil
And they, (they) they know im right
It's a shame you have fallen
To the hands of the underworld
Shame you can't prey into the valley of the king

And they, (they) they call me evil
And they, (they) they know im right
It's a shame you have fallen
To the hands of the underworld
Shame you can't prey into the valley of the king
