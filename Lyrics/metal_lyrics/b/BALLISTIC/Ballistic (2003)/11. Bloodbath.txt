Bloodbath
At last a new reality, God I know
And now this pain is just a vast Illusion
Take control, this hatred builds inside me 
Frustratet I will live forever

Now there has to be a better way
Is't eating me alive
I am defensive as my destination arrives
Screams are heard, defeated in death
I stand alone in despair

Before, this hell continues
Now we have their forces on the run
Cry for the millions
There will be mire before I am dine

And now if you kill me
I'll rise to be the martyred one
Survey the bloodbath, elusive hater
And I'll survey the bloodbath, in entirety

In a world of anarchy and passed responsibility
I'am powermad dellusional
I'll tabe yiur body and I'll rape your soul

Do you stand beside me to lead and destroy

Debaucherize and desecrate, elusive evils son
You pray for pain you pray for me
Your beaten with battery
If left alive I'd like to kill them all
And I'm to rule this bloody hell

And now if you kill me
I'll rise to be the martyred one
Survey the bloodbath, elusive hater
And I'll survey the bloodbath, in entirety

Stripped of all your dignity and in decending infidelity
Tear my heart out, I'm trained to purify my soul

Bloodbath
At last a new reality, God I know
And now this pain is just a vast Illusion
Take control, this hatred builds inside me 
Frustratet I will live forever

Screams of torture lost in hell, so alive, I SURVIVE!
