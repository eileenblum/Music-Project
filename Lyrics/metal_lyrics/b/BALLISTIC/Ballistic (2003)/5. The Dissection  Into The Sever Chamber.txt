God playing is my right, my will, my insight
Comotose before me lies
A lukewarm stiff to tear inside

My pleasure will insure my success
Pungent fumes leak from your pancrease
Festival of pure hell to begin
I inspect and dissect limb from limb

Society is sick because you disagree with me
I could make you happier than you could ever be
I will fit in, don't stand out I a crowd
Others can pretend, but I'll laugh aloud...

Where am I and what have I been through
My surroundings are strange
I don't remember much but I remember you
A victim of the derranged

Through all this horror I see
A vision bent over at me, a shadow in black
Scalpal in hand to attack

I gotta find my way out of this place
A butcher's shop of horror
Put myself toghether and head for the door
Amassing of blood that can never be restored

Through all this horror I see
A vision bent over at me, a shadow in black
Scalpal in hand to attack

Stooooooop! In your tracks
Unfold your arms and spill your wretched sack
Your mine until the end
A table set for two my dismembered little friend
Into the sever chamber...!!!

Hee hooo - the parts are flying
Whack-whack-whack - you lay there dying
911 you dial in a stubb , into the sever chamber
resect and dismember, I could get $4.99 a pound
