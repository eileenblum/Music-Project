You liik into my lifeless eyes,
Roll back another victim dies
A whisper of terror returns from the cold 
Determined, and a survivor, the devil is born

You won't see me in the shadow of night,
Feel the chill run by
I lie in wait and ready to strike,
Sharpenis the knife
Shaking I anticipate, adrenaline accelerate
The walls have come alive, I taken another life

Oh, there's nobody left
There's no one here left alive
Oh, dawn a black new peace 
Has broken my thirst for a life

I'm a silent killer, wicked and abused
And a killer feeds upon the power of you

With a slash at your back, violence attack, 
And a killer sees just what he has to do

Who aim I, can you tell me what you see
When you look into my eyes, who am I
Who aim I, can you tell me what you see
When you look into my eyes

You tell the world that I am god, the power
Of life and death, install the fear that I
Desire, but speak with baided breath, arrest
Them all but miss the one that's taken many 
Lives, the pleague that goes from dusk to
Dawn, watch your city cry

Oh, there's nobody left
There's no one here left alive
Oh, dawn a black new peace 
Has broken my thirst for a life

I'm a silent killer, wicked and abused
And a killer feeds upon the power of you
With a slash at your back, violence attack, 
And a killer sees just what he has to do
