Lay dormant ancient creature
Arise this glory day
What I can bring, I can deliver with might
This power be apportioned
Come worship like a god
A call to arms, the time for violence is now

Into the last front, into the last man
Save yourself, now we, we destroy all in sight
The slaughtered depraved and deseased

Well heres the sound that you know so well
From the mind that is not for sale
Though the years flow by me like a dream
Think you're a man and you can muscle me
Listen boy as your about to see
I'll bitch slap you back in position 
Don't you look my way again
If you think you can look me in the eye
Like I told you before that's how the others
Died away, they died away

Now you can see me, see me for who I really am
The face I see now when I look inside the mirror
I'm standing proud, I'm standing again
And the sound...It's the sound of the gods
Thunder of pride before me
From every corner, into the stage 
And you can hear them call my name
On the threshold of pain

Into the last front, into the last man
Save yourself, now we, we destroy all in sight
The slaughtered depraved and deseased

A sound pervasive truly abrasive
I'll put you through the wall
Afterburn will erase your mind
In an brand new way
There's a piece of me 
Caught in a revolving door
And you want to know
Why they're calling out for more
Call it honesty, integrity
A rare commodity today

Now you can see me, see me for who I really am
I destroy the avent garde
Awake the tired masses
I'm standing proud, I'm standing again
And the sound...It's the sound of the gods
Down on your knees before me
From every corner, into the stage 
And you can hear them call my name
On the threshold of pain

I call upon you
Fight the imposters rule with power
Destroy
Threshold of pain
