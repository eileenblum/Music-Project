see the heavens fall, see the sun race to black
see the planets burn, fire races from my eye
distant screams of terror
visions of the fading sun
revelation the sky is turned to blood red
pray for the dead, lightning destroying
creation above, lock and kill

the wicked people bring us the wicked dream 
it doesn't matter what you believe
heaven falls and race into the sun
armageddon, no where to run

burned inside as you gasp for breath
the cold burns in the aftermath
the nazarine will not be seen
as all humanity is laid to rest

and the told us it was in its way
ant the told us there'd be hell to pay
and now If I where you, nothing more to do 
you better finish what you start today

thy father, thy god, deliver me from this evil
world we know, pray for the dead
lightning destroying creation above

oh, fir the prophet of the dead, I'm buried alive
leave my soul, demon of possesion
on this earth and alive, hell's fire

oh, the zombies to the fire, remaining only to die
the final battle is won for the supreme being that 
will arise, evil takes hold us, into the years 
armageddon has begun, you must respect the role 
thas this history plays, armageddon has won
