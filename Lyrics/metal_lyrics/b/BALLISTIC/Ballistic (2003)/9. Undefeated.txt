You can feel  the tension everywhere 
Hear them gasp for breath
This hand is the one is spare, and this one leads
To death, legions, strike them out alone
One by one they belly up and one by one they fall
One by one go bottom up, with speed I kill them
All, strike down, king throughout the land

Cast in thousands, as I brave a vile world
Insurrecting terror
And then lead us to control
I will defeat, and if the task is mine to meet
And lead into the future, after the fall
I dare to go, battle for supermacy
The ages call me a leader (leader)

Smashed destroyed burned and decayed this 
Born ro obliterate, your lives
Savior, challenge of my life
Into their eyes I look for weakness
Backed into distress
In the end they call me on, master
Rivals fall away

Cast in thousands, as I brave a vile world
Insurrecting terror
And then lead us to control
I will defeat, and if the task is mine to meet
And lead into the future, after the fall
I dare to go, battle for supermacy
The ages call me on

And I will give my only son
When this battle must be won
Cold hearted, cold hearted, afterlife limbo

You're a beast of mina and the price of fame 
An everlasting lonely sea of pain
And if I jump off, ill never know

My realities fleeting and my eayes are red
There's a dangerous thought running through my head
Betray my feelings now, let them go

So many have tried and many have failed
You're not alone in betrayal
In misery, you belong
But I will survive I will defeat
The weakness you lay at my feet
My happiness, my revenge
Sail on (conquer, suffer) but live forever

I'm undefeated, leave me alone (alone, alone)
In this insane assylum leave me alone
(alone, alone)
I'm undefeated, leave me alone (alone, alone)
In this insane assylum leave me alone
(alone, alone)

You can fear them, hear it, the undenying pain
Into the land, where angels cry 
I'm bound and torn again
