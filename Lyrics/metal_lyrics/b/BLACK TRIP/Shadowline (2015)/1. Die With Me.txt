The will is struggling in a state of despair
These broken pieces I cannot repair
There's nothing here that I can argue about
It's just a shame I couldn't figure it out
Degraded, bowed and pushed to detest
Betrayed desires, all ventures suppressed
You keep on digging till the tables may turn
You better act before you get yourself burned

With all prosperity that could have been found
There is no way to stop, no turning around
A vague imprint is all that is lost
All great ambitions caught in that black hole

Breathe the fire, breathe it in
Breathe the air of original sin
Wring the ashes of the dust

Let die, set free, resign and die with me
No loss, no life, let go and die with me
Hold on, hold tight, this act can only make it right
Let die, set free, resign and die with me

I stand here gazing at a ravenous void
My legs are broken and the road is destroyed
The will is struggling, we were born in a storm
All great ambitions put here on a platform
The shining fortunes will never be seen
They're just a fragment in a part of a dream
Looking back there's nothing there anymore
You look ahead, there's no way, you just can not do it

Breathe the fire, breathe it in
Breathe the air of original sin
Wring the ashes of the dust

Let die, set free, resign and die with me
No loss, no life, let go and die with me
Hold on, hold tight, this act can only make it right
Let die, set free, resign and die with me
