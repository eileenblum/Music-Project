A night of desperation, crawling back for more
I think I've seen this madness, in a previous war
Stumbling on through old memories, I don't know why
These deadly feelings just have to die
Now I'm fumbling, I'm stumbling, I'm coming back for more
I'm going down for sure

I had a chance but I wouldn't take it,
I was afraid I was to weak to make it
But now I sense I should have tried
I could have left alive
So spare your passion, the road is long
Don't think adversity makes you strong
The resolution is coming on

This gloomy road is way too long, I cannot do this on my own
The drive keeps on pushing to the edge
I'm looking back and I'm so afraid, I cannot run from my darkened shade
The solution leads onto the end

Oh you know I can't make it sustain anymore
I'm forced to resign
Tonight I give up
Down the line

Oh, you know I can't live this dream anymore
I'm off this shaky ride
Tonight
I give up
I gave all that I had

In the hallucinations I see beyond all faith
I wind the wheel on backwards and it won't be too late
I'm burned to ashes and will not glow
I've planted all my seeds into a ground that can not grow
The resolution is coming on

This gloomy road is way too long, I cannot do this on my own
The drive keeps on pushing to the edge
I'm looking back and I'm so afraid, I cannot run from my darkened shade
The solution leads onto the end
