Mechanistic morality and pride
As the pointer strikes me all abide
Moulded, framed and persecuted
By the shadow of the pendulum

Finest copper to encase the cogwheels
We are the ghosts of this machinery

Heave and struggle to bend the range of hours
In the workroom of the watchmaker
Strict obedience and conformation
By the motion of the ticking god

By the code of horology
Repetitive frames are designed
Through the gap of the formula
Overhear the final chime
Doomsday clockworks ringing out the time

The inconsistent reveals the hidden numbers
To change the rhythm of the pendulum
Spin the wheel for seven hundred thousand hours
We throw our moments to the bottom half

By the code of horology
Repetitive frames are designed
Through the gap of the formula
Overhear the final chime

Doomsday clockworks ringing out the time
