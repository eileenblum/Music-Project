We passed upon a lonely lane
Walked throughout the driving rain
The closing path was altered in the dark

Running with the rising tide
The shore is lying open wide and sleek
Waves are rolling soft and silently

The plants, the soil, the air, the sea
Are sleeping in this scenery tonight
Where everything allies

Past north, south, east and west
They've gone to their eternal rest
Where everything expires

Formations lying perfectly for the last goodbye
In the circle all becomes alive, in the circle all will die

The void and atmosphere allied in this 
Scenery
The closing of the circle in this
Scenery

We passed upon a lonely lane
Walked throughout the driving rain
The closing path was altered in the dark

Running with the rising tide
The shore is lying open wide and sleek
Waves are rolling soft and silently

Formations lying perfectly for the last goodbye
In the circle all becomes alive, in the circle all will die

The void and atmosphere allied in this 
Scenery
The closing of the circle in this

Scenery
