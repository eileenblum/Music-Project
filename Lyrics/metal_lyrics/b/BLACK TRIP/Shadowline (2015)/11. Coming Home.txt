Riding on through shapeless lands, at the pulse of restless thirst
Losing track of north and south in a weird and constant haze
I am stuck in constant motion, impressions are unconcerned
And the ride is pounding on, through bavarian city nights

Putting out the lights
I'm on my way

Sceneries flashing by
It's the final passage now
Through the rapid city lights
I'm coming home tonight

550 miles away, can't recall where I was yesterday
Nights are days and days are waste
I've been looking for a saving race
In the flashing city lights, I see the goings-on through the glass
And when the bar is empty and the lights are out, a longing is growing strong

Putting out the lights
I'm on my way
The curtain is coming down
I'm coming to stay

Sceneries flashing by
It's the final passage now
Through the rapid city lights
I'm coming to stay

A fire on the road as the days turn into weeks
Across a hundred borders through motorways and streets
A ride through slings and arrows, through darkness and through light
This is the final passage, I'm coming home tonight

Sceneries flashing by
It's the final passage now
Through the rapid city lights
I'm coming to stay

The runway is set alight
For the final flight
Above the rapid city lights
I'm coming home tonight
