Round 11
In the middle of the H.O. Game
Sirens howling
A panel truck put in flames

And as the chase went on along deceptive ways
The traitors were in full blast, putting out the trace
Oh, the trace

And when the set up suspect soon was found
The real men of the break-in were unbound, unbound

The judge was the offender and the witness was his aide
All leakages were sealed to perpetrate the perfect raid
The trial was entertainment by the judgement of the innocent
No evidence came through, locked inside a Berlin model 32

In the outskirts
In the quarters by the gas works wall
Assassination of the one who had heeded the call

And as the chase went on along deceptive ways
The killers were in full blast, wiping out the trace
Oh, yeah

And when the set up suspect soon was found
The real men of the murder were unbound, unbound

The judge was the assassin and the witness was his aid
All leakages were sealed to execute and to evade
The trial was entertainment by the judgement of the innocent
No evidence came through, locked inside a Berlin model 32

Decades later a discovery of hidden truth
Cryptic writings in a safe of model 32
And though the case was over long gone prescribed
The bigwigs and the renegades denied, denied

The case had been running on deceptive ways
The red tape scandal was secluded in the safe
In the safe

The judge was the offender and the witness was his aide
All leakages were sealed to perpetrate the perfect raid
The trial was entertainment by the judgement of the innocent
No evidence came through, locked inside a Berlin model 32
