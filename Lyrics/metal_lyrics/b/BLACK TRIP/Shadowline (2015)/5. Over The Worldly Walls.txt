I float unconscious in the level inbetween
Riding silent, slowly further down the stream
I have forgotten where this quiet ride began
But I have a feeling that my days out there are done

I've passed a crossroad, in which I chose my way
I had the option to return back or to stay
Beneath the surface there's a peace I can't resist
I'm floating further through the tranquil, quiet mist

Float on forever, over the worldly walls
All sequences severed, over the worldly walls

I float unconscious in the dim and parallel
Riding silent beyond the earthly carousel
I keep on wandering through the quietude of my dream
I know I'm leaving, into silence down the stream

Float on forever, over the worldly walls
All sequences severed, over the worldly walls

Riding above the storm, over the worldly walls
Float on forever, over the worldly walls
