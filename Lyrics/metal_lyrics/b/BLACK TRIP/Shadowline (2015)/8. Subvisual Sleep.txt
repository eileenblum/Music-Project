In the theatre of somn I fall asleep
And the nocturnal play begins
It's an act of the burlesque
Restored from deep within

In the muffled red light of the spots
A shade of the aerialist
She's dancing at the string
And the ballet-broads they sing

Go deeper, go deeper into the dream
Come closer, come see what is left unseen
Go further, your wicked thoughts are dwelling over here
Go deeper, go deep in subvisual sleep

The play proceeds beneath the dust
And the roam begins to spin
It's an act of the grotesque
In the theatre of sin
In the blinding blue lights of the spots
A disfigured face of death
He is beating at the string
And the ghastly choir sing

Go deeper, go deeper into the dream
Come closer, come see what is left unseen
Go further, your wicked thoughts are dwelling over here
Go deeper, go deep in subvisual sleep
