When the night is taking over in the recess of our loneliness
I wish my words that I told her, would be enough for our world to last
On a flight back home from London, I see the stars through a plaintive haze
We spoke of death on a verdant graveyard, I close my eyes now I see your face...

Leaving on the shadowline

On a late night separation, a final kiss by your hallway door
Inner commotion, I can feel it swelling, departure in a mental war
When you awake in that sweet position, I'm heading east on the shadowline
I got a taste of my own endeavor, now I go back to where the sun resign

Leaving on the shadowline

Heart beats hard in a deadly rhythm, for the words that I gave away
I was scared but I could see it coming, I should have known it was too soon to say
When the night is taking over, I dream away to a distant shore
Where the ocean doesn't flow between us
Where I can hold you forever me

Leaving on the shadowline
