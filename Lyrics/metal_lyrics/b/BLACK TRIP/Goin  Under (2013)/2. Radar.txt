Out in the fields there's a stake in the ground
And through the mountains comes a poisonous sound
Down below, the surface is turning
Any day now, we'll be burning

We live the world beneath the horror
The waves are calling us all over
Their frightening sound is growing louder
You'll hear the sound of the...

Souls of Elahiji arising from the sea
And their frantic lamentation's moving around mysteriously
A rush of wings and then their falling
From beyond we hear the downfall calling

Out in the streets there is no one a round
And in the fields there's a furious sound
Count me out, this world is crazy
Any day now, we'll be burning
