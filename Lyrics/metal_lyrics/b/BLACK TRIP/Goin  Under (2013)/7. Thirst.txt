In the murky morning, in a silent room, in a desert place
The healing comfort of the morning sun has  come too late
She fought the whole night through to stay away from her dreadful fate
But in the murky morning, the shining light has left her eyes

I tried to wake her before they'd take her
But her mortal thirst was way too strong
She walked right out of life
I kneeled to hold her, her blood ran colder
Her mortal thirst was showing in her eyes
She walked right out of life

The night was falling, she bowed her head, her aura bled
The night was calling into a world where s he could lay
She fought the whole night through to stay away from her dreadful fate
But in the murky morning the s hining light has left her face

The black rooms are calling, and her heart stands still
She won't be around when the day begins

Her sorrow is pounding and the blood leaks in
She won't be around when the day begins
