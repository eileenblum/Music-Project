We must engage genetic manipulation technology in the creation of a subservient species
To fulfil our earthly intentions they shall be our distant kin
We have come here now the plan has been realized
Extraction of earth's riches mankind was created to mine land
Foragers, architects products of our design hunters, prophets absorbed and die

Welcome to the new revolution futureproof human resolution
Creations from our institution slave labour for all generations
Location is secure laborers are in place
You are only worth as much as the possessions that you can hold
Foragers, architects products of our design hunters, prophets absorbed and die

Welcome to the new revolution futureproof human resolution
Creations from our institution slave labour for all generations
Burrow, and take what is ours pray to the gods you have made
Serving endlessly collect, then lay to rest serve your purpose and die
