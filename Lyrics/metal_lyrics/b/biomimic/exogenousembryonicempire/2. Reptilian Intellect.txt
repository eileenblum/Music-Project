Bleeding out conformity, breathing in primal rage.
Living endless agony for dollars not well spent.
Trading suits for loin cloth, exchanging pens for knives.
No more domestication, forfeit is your lives.
Decay of our social infrastructure degrade the value of our soul

Times up, no more protection, ending the reign of man
Submerge logical conscience, your lives are null and void
Buildings, turned into war zones, desks turned to barricades
No more domestication, forfeit is your lives.
Decay of our social infrastructure degrade the value of our soul

From tranquillity, to hostility from normality, to brutality
From serenity, to obscenity, from humanity, to profanity
