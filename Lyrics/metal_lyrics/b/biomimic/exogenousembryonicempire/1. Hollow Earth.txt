Escape is futile when the atrocity is below
More than man or reptile an abomination consumes
Within the world you live on beneath the gardens and trees
Deception or remorse either will bring the world to its knees
Living, breathing, seeing is believing down in the Hollow
Living, breathing, seeing is believing down in the hell we have made

Destined long ago original creation
Tunnels down below insemenation of Mother Earth
Within the world you live on beneath the gardens and trees
Deception or remorse either will bring the world to its knees
Living, breathing, seeing is believing down in the Hollow
Living, breathing, seeing is believing down in the hell we have made

Persistent Resistance you solve all your problems with persistent resistance
No, you can't escape me, I am down below civilization, hidden by your earth
Do not mistake me, I am real, I exist Hades nor hell exist in our realm
