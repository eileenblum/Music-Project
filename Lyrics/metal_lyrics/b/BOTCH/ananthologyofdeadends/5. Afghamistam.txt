You'll take the ride to leave this town along that yellow line
You'll find a life on the outside
You can't deny the walks too long, you'll get there in half the time
If you take a seat ion the shotgun side
Tahoma calls. It's waiting there to get rid of us all
When the big on comes better hope the car don't stall
Better hop on in the pass will close if the clouds start rolling in
Can't take the thought of being stuck again.
