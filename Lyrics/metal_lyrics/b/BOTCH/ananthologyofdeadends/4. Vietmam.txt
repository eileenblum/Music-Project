Our boys need something to rape, I want to taste you today, like kids kissing
I've lost all sympathy, only living for me, preservation
We need smoething to break, I want something to break
Those words weren't meant to escape, but they do anyway, I hate the others
So show me your strength
Explaining changes nothing
"Chocolates only so much shit, floating out of the snake, to the see..."
And I'll take their fate, and I bet no one will care
So sink in your tusks, mighty walrus
Take what's yours, Walrus's of the night, take your prey, with tusks bared in the burning light,
Take their life and rob me.

"Ever think the world is just one big blubbery walrus ready to sink it's ivory tusks into you? Me too."
