Six chevy's in our front yard, a thousand empty Coors, is all it takes to make me different
And it's like you never knew the effect it had on you
Pop another top. Today's lesson how to live with these cracked out mutha fuckas
And it's like they never knew the effect they had on you
Mom's cookin' shit in bed, no angels for the living dead
Light the propane
Boiling the medicine, taste it is it done
I've only done it a couple times, so take this pill for me
Give your daddy a hand
Open the batteries like I showed you
Precious lithium I own you like you own this single wide lot.

"A house fine in the town of Roy took the lives of two children.
The parents made it out of the single wide trailer home without a scratch.
See they were too busy trying to save their crop of Meth that had started the fire.
Too busy to get their kids out."
