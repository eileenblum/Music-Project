Listen to what I have to say to you
Painful repetition - comes and goes again
Painful repetition - comes and goes again
And it goes
So now I'm the human
Now I'm the human shield
Finest engineering - we've ever seen
Finite enginerring - it never leaves
Never leaves
And that's why
We dine on your design
I like the look on your face
It's bittersweet, and lasts
For six hours
Alone for one day and six hours
