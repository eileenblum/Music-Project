Love it leave it
Cradle it in these loving arms
Exposed to regret
Alone long enough to set
What made you think
It would work
Exceptions spoken softly
Raised it trained
Felt the void and then filled it
It grew up to know you as the one to blame

Now you've done it
And time will tell
But there's a price to pay
I hear the babies cries
I'll see you begging
On your knees for forgiveness
