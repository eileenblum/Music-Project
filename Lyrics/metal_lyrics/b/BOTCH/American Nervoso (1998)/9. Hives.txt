Words on lies
Form these feelings
And I'm still feeling everything
Can't think of what I'd say
Your canary covered eyes
Still shine through everlasting hives
Still, Can't think of how I'd respond
I've caved in once before
Answers on the mantle
Right where we left it so many times before

Father fell off again
But I see no reason why
We can't go without him
On our side
