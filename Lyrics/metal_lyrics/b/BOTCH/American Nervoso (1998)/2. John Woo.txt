Dir sir or madame
I'm writing you on behalf of me and my
Fellow man
You see we're so sick and tired
Of being rediscovered
Again
I'll take the fate of texas into my own
Hands
It's still dripping consistant constant
Goodnight sweet Susan
Oh don't worry I'll still drive by
It's sealed and signed goodbye
But I've recieved nothing from you
