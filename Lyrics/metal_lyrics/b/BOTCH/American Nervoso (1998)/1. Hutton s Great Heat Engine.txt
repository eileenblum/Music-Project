We'll never see them again
I won't even try to run
Because it's kind of pointless
Here comes the sea, the sea of red
It's hard to believe that our end has come
Oh she still erupts
It's hard to believe that something so thick
Is so quick
But it buries us by the hundreds
It's so quiet here
And the heat is my new freind
