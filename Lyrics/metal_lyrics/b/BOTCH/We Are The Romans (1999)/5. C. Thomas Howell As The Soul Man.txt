Stop the show listen up cause we've got something
to say and it's important | Can't hear the notes you
play or the words you say and
you're not changing the world |
Just a few more moments of your time just a few
more moments while I speak |  So we can change
your mind | We're all breaking ground, bringing the
revolution around | Support this support that once
again it's all an act | Wasting our time on you stop |
The worst music I've ever heard, honesty that touches
a nerve | The words fall onto the floor, drive home
with no lessons learned | Soon the content outweighs
the form with time the sound gets boring | For you
and for me this posture is self serving
