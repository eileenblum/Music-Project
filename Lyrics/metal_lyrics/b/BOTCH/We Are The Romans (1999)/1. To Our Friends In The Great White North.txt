Set apart, great divides/ You are not what you seem,
always different, always changing |It brings the worst
out of me, and it's here to stay |
That's the way it's always been for
men | Always on your attire silences what you think
and now you're wearing eyeliner | so lie | Now see
how you look in the light not so different and it's hard
for you to swallow | Gone | Don't change a single
thing atleast not for me just keep on acting | It's
maddening it's flashbulb thoughts it's contrasting I
can't decide who you are no feelings plagues my
head we'll all be specimens | It's your fault, fucking
up the kids | Complaints have all been heard we're
tired we're bringing out the dead | Where's the first
you that I knew
