White eyes in coal mines, concrete industry, bare
backs, baseball caps | The sweat is part of life we're
still thriving | We've got alot of
mouths to feed and we're trying |
You think I do this for me to join the caste | Flip through
old photographs of our family's past | Building your
home, giving you life, our livelyhood | Creators | It's
always been like this | People you never see the
ones you'll never be | Working with their hands
We've downsized again | All through history building
piece by piece | It's not for you to erase with your
algebra and your science | Simple labor
