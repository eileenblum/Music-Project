Wide eyes help you stand out and the fact that you
bare all skin | Silhouettes keep me thinking about the
habits you are in |Watch us blanket
all things and solidify all claims |
Hopes dreams we're here to make ourselves better
| Time to build our colony | There's no stopping it now
conquest is at hand | And the thirst for more and the
need for more go on | Never satisfied never dormant
we go one | See us conquer all the humans that are
left | This is our new home and we're still building
