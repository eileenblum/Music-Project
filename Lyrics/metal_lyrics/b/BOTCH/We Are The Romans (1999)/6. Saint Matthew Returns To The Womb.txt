On the porch two words changed life for me | And
I'm not the same | He said son soon your life will
change | And I believed in him |
And your soul will be free of the
pain | In time you'll know that it's true | The hand of
god will pick me up | Just pledge your loyalty | So I
fall to you | False eyes, forked words, I'm ten | Now
that I see you're just a man | Recruiting your
followers | And this world is not one by your hand |
Questions and contradictions | Feels like I'm
following the rabbit 'round the track again | Around
around | And you're so sure | Two words | The
changes I've endured | I know that it is all shit
