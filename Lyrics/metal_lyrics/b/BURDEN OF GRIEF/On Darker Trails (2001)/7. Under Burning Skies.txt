Dance with devil tonight
Dance withe devil by your side
Dance under the moonlight skies
Dance with the devil tonight
March with the demons at night
The legions of victory and pride
Fight in the dawn of the night
Fight till all enemies die

We are the children of the night
We are damned in hell to fight
Against the human kind of life
With might and main
Destroying the enemies of light
We kill to ensure our life
Enslave the angels into the night
And drink their blood like wine

Drink with the devil tonight
Drink with the devil blood red wine
Drink under burning skies
Drink with the devil tonight

I take a look around
look at the bloody ground
bloody wounds, arms, flesh and skulls
with dirt and mud

After all these fights I can see
The shade of death walking over me
I can feel the might in my mind
The mind of the devil is by my side
I'm drinking the blood
And I am dancing tonight
Dance with the devil by my side

Dance with the devil...

We are the legions of the night
On mighty horses we will ride
We oppress all and everyone
For our victory
Headed by the devil's one
We march fearlessly through the land
The celebration never end's
We drink the blood red wine

Drink with the devil...

We dance with the devil tonight
We dance under moonlight skies
We drink with the devil at night
We drink under burning skies
