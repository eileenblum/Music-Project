Disillusioned of this world
Running to the end
Seeing what happened
The future, the past fill in a mirror
Time runs fast, death's coming slowly
Walking down the stairs

Into the depths of my soul
Seeing what happened
With the rest of my life
Till its dawn, the moon shines
Bright on the sky
Whispering winds calling my name

Who am I, and where am I from
Do you know the answer
Is there a place, was I made
In heaven or in hell
Starring eyes surrounding me
Glittering in the dark
Showing me the endless path
Another sphere of life

Frozen seas or endless green
The fields of joy have gone away
Time runs fast, death's coming slowly
Walking down the stairs
Into the depths of my soul
