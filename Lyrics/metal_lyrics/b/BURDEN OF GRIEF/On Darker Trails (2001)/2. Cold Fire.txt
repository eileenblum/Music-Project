Cold fire, it burns in me
Desire, in my heart
For fire, in deep anger
It burns higher, in my head
Cold fire, for me you are
A liar, damned in black
Cold fire in the real world, like in a dream
We realise not all we see

My anger - frozen in my brain
But not for all the time, for all the time
My soul - in the middle of the war
Among the honest and the evil

Cold fire, from my lungs
I expire icy breath
Cold fire, life in distress
Minor as the time before
Fire, it burns so hot
Dire straits feel burning
Fire, nobody can quench it
Before the detonation will crush you too

My body out of control
My nerves are at the end
I can't fight on against
The sorrow in my brain it makes me insane
