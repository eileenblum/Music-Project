When the night comes over me
I see the lights of the atmosphere
The arrival of the dark lord
Kneeling down he speaks to me

I am god the only preacher
I am the devil in your mind
Rising to the depths of your hell
I am your god the chosen one

Sinking down on my knees
Bowing my head to his feet
Falling down into the deep
In my nightmares I will scream
When the night comes...

I am you god forever
I will bring you down in my hell
I breathe your breath in my lungs
I can give you peace in your life

Demons around me, calling my name
They make me insane, won't go away
Taking my mind, taking my soul
Please let me out, I can't run away

In the dark night I can see
A flash from hell deep inside of me
See the dark lord over me
This is what he speaks to me

I am god the only...

I can't move I can't speak
my body is like paralysed
I'm a slave in the dark
Damned in hell to serve them all
In the dark night...

I am you god forever...
