In a world of pain and lies
I found no concept, no sense
My mind, always black and dark
Fear is what I feel

Voices - from the other side
Voices - freezing the blood in my veins

Uncounted years have passed by
I'm afraid of all my emotions
On grey walls, the eyes of death
Looking at me, showing only pain

Flying through the times of endless visions
But I won't die
Journey through my thoughts will never end
But I won't die
As I reach the end I see a light
But I won't die
Bleeding me, but it attracts my soul
I will never die

This is my last dream
The deliverance from the torments
Flying to the other side
Into a new doimension

Voices - from the other side
Voices - freezing the blood in my veins

The light begins to fade away
The light that gave me new hope
Crying, screaming, I long the light to return
But complete darkness fills my soul

I begin to understand the voices
And I must die
Whispering my fate into my ear
And I must die
I become one with the darkness
And I must die
I gain my end, I am free
