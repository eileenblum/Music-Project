I can see the light behind the shadow walls
See the faces of another unknown world
I can feel that my heart is pounding slow
Feel the fear reinforcing my agony

Lost in a sea of nothingness
The force is around and the force is inside
I reach the light and the light reaches me
As the heart in me stops pounding

In the name of my blood I curse my life
Darkness, wild and unturned colours burst within
I spread my twilight wings and fly away
And I feel the infinity of my sense

I see a long cave, the light is far away
I am everywhere, around and inside
I am the one who never wanted to be
I will reborn before I die

The gate - your portal to life
It seems like I can't reach it
I'm eternal, I'm delightful, I'm supreme
Illusions which speak of endless nights come true

In the name of my blood I curse my life
Darkness, wild and unturned colours burst within
I spread my twilight wings and fly away
And I feel the infinity of my sense
