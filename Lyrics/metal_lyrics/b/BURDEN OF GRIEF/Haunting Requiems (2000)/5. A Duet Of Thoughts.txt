Reflections of dark shadows
The wintermoon is shining nebulous
Through the grey clouds upon the high mountains
Their shadows lie dark over the lake
New dreams begin to rise in me
I think I'm the only one under the deep sky
Calm winds stroke my hair
Suddenly outlines of black shapes appear of the horizon

They move slowly towards the old dark ruins
Up on one of the high mountains
They march to the rhythm of the night
Along deep caverns

Deep in my mind I wish to return and be grateful
To feel the infinity of the deep sky
I sense the forces that burn deep within me
I am now forever one with myself

The light of the moon of decayed ruins
The shapes begin to build a circle
Around the gloomy ruins
And stillness surrounds the sky around me
My heart begins to pound faster and faster
They look to the bright sky
And blazes appear as the old man
Rises his arms towards the sky

A duet of thoughts in my mind
I feel the presence of God
And natures truthful solitude comes over me
I close my eyes...and dream
