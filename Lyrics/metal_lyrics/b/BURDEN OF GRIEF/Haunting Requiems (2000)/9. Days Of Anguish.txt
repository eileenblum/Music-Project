Never thought I would be the one
Who dreams of you night and day
You chained me against my will
And I can no longer resist

You know you are the only one
Whom I love, you ignore me
There is silence in my heart
When I stay without you

But you left me in my room
Days of anguish begin for me
And I, I got no reason
To live without you
I can't live without you

You're walking alone
Without noticing me
But I hope the day will come
When you will stay by my side

When I leave you without hope
When you turn your face away
Your laughter still burns in me
And I feel frustration
