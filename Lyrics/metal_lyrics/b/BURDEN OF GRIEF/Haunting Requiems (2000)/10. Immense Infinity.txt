The life is inscrutable
No one knows the sense of this existence
I, I hate my own life
Of much obscurity and immense infinity
I search for sense in my life
But the search will never end
Beautiful death takes my life
Come to me and set me free

Life what is life, time what is time
Death what is death, to live is to die

For a part of the human race
Is death the only chance
To reach deliverance
What does it really mean?
Paradise of what men tell
Or is it really hell
Time after time I think about
What is life and what is death
