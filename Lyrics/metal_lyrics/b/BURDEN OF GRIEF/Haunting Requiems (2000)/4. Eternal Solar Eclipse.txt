The kingdom of darkness are marked by mankind
Nature can be the mirror of all our evil thoughts
Insanity and murder expressed by thunderstorms
Ligghtnings in the dark accompanied by cold rain

Forests of fear in dark night
The black clouds in front of the moon
Stormy winds are blowing through the trees
Knots break like crushing bones
Howling wolves in the dark
Their glittering eyes like diamonds
Announcing the dark, dead laughter
Appearing at midnight

The kingdoms of darkness are marked by mankind
Nature can be the mirror of all our evil thoughts

I swear that I'm a good man
But dark visions sometimes haunt my mind
Darkness lives in the best of us
But in the worst the darkness already reigns

Mentally deranged by torments of hell
My insanity grows with every torture
Pain in my life until the death
Fuck you in your fucking cunt

The lake of no escape
With its dark, infinite depth
The mist around the lake
It is all over the near swamp
Imprisoned in the infinite depth
You cannot get away from it
Darkness all around you then
You're lost but still alive

In our darkest dreams the past of nature
Is to create pictures of the black, dead visions
Most people give a home to the darkness
But some already give to it a kingdom
