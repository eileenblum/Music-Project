I have to take these drugs tonight
Cannot live with all this pain in my hand
There is no place for me to hide
I won't strain myself for you

Hold me - I have no chance to live on with this pain
Hold me - Where is the end, there's no way out from here

So many tears in your eyes, no way to dry
I search the way to the final exit without pain
But who is lighten me my way
Please let me kill myself to end this fucking...

Situation more complex
Feeling are so frightening
Sin against god
Sin against human
On my knees I'm praying for the end

I have to take these drugs tonight
Cannot live with all this pain in my hand
There is no place for me to hide
I won't strain myself for you

Hold me - I have no chance to live on with this pain
Hold me - Where is the end, there's no way out from here

Situation more complex
feeling are so frightening
Sin against god
Sin against human
On my knees I'm praying for the end

I have to take these drugs tonight
Cannot live with all this pain in my hand
There is no place for me to hide
I won't strain myself for you

Hold me - I have no chance to live on with this pain
Hold me - Where is the end, there's no way out from here
