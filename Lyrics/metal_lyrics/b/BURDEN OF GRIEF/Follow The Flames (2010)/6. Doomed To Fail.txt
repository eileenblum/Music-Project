Searching for the eternal treasure
In my life I fade away
Searching for the immortal life
Blinded by the human light
Answers wrapped in mystery

Sailing through the seas of madness
Feel a fresh breeze blowing slowly
Hear the sounds of rolling thunder
Open my eyes to find a way out
Never ending torture
Never ending grief and despair
The quest of life will never end
The endless search is doomed to fail

Bewildered by the human being
Every night the same old shit
In my mind I feel so strained
Where are the answers I'm looking for?

Sailing through the seas of madness
Feel a fresh breeze blowing slowly
Hear the sounds of rolling thunder
Open my eyes to find a way out
Never ending torture
Never ending grief and despair
The quest of life will never end
The endless search is doomed to fail

Blinded by the eternal treasure
Blinded by the immortal life
Dazzled by the human light
Every night an endless torture
Answers wrapped in mystery

Sailing through the seas of madness
Feel a fresh breeze blowing slowly
Hear the sounds of rolling thunder
Open my eyes to find a way out
Never ending torture
Never ending grief and despair
The quest of life will never end
The endless search is doomed to fail
