In my world there was a scene of destruction
Into my dark world there is only bitterness

Hatred, full of hate
Insomnia within my painful dreams
I'm losing the feature
My sense to control

In my world there was a scene of destruction
Into my dark world there is only bitterness
Lying in darkness with the shadows of death
Crying for pain, falling deep in the abyss

Hatred, full of hate
Insomnia within my painful dreams
I'm losing the feature
My sense to control

Frozen darkness, cry of fear
Feeling that the end is near
Endless torture, slave in hell
Burning fire, flames of pain

Hatred, full of hate
Insomnia within my painful dreams
I'm losing the feature
My sense to control

Hatred, full of hate
Nightmares continually
Deceptions, confusion
Bitterness, so unimpressed
Nightmares continually
Deceptions, confusion is all I feel

Frantic every day
Insomnia within my painful dreams
Spread wings in black
Call it the arms of death
