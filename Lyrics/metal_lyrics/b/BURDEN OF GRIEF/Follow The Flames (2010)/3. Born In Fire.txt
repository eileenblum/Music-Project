Feel the desire into the fire. In the fire we are born
Into the ashes of the night
Into the deep black heart of mine

Into the ashes of the night
The deep black heart of mine

Feel the desire into the fire. In the fire we are born
Into the ashes of the night
Into the deep black heart of mine
We make the sound of a dark fringe group
No more deserted commercial fucking shit

Love it or hate it
You know what I mean
Love it or hate it
Things are never as bad as they seem

Hear my denial to the self serving beings
Greedy for money every day
Not the least inkling, no matter at all
We give a fuck what others say

Love it or hate it
You know what I mean
Love it or hate it
Things are never as bad as they seem

Into the ashes of the night
The deep black heart of mine

Feel the desire into the fire. In the fire we are born
Into the ashes of the night
Into the deep black heart of mine
We make the sound of a new dark age
Blaze up the fire, burn it down in rage

Love it or hate it
You know what I mean
Love it or hate it
Things are never as bad as they seem
