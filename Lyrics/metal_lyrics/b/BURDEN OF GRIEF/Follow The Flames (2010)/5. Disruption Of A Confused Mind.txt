Dichotomy, reality or fake
Blurry pictures is what I see
A total chaos in my brain
Illusions deceiving real

Falling down into the dark
Nightmares moving on and on
See the fear in their eyes
There is total desperation
Lasting daydreams moving on
Depressions frat into my mind
Fear inside and no espace
Disruption of a confused mind

Dichotomy, I can't discriminate what's real
The pictures in my brain are dim
Fear and pain no normal life
Schizophrenic Daemons are omnipresent in my life

Dichotomy, reality or fake
No change to see environment clear
The pictures in my brain are dim
A horror world I'm living through
A suffer of a martyrous

Falling down into the dark
Nightmares moving on and on
See the fear in their eyes
There is total desperation
Lasting daydreams moving on
Depressions frat into my mind
Fear inside and no espace
Disruption of a confused mind
