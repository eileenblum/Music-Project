Take a look into the mirror
Take a look deep inside your soul
Can you see your other self?
Can you see your real identity?

Take a look into the mirror
The owner of your thoughts
Can you believe what you really see?
Is it the truth? Come and look behind the scene
Shiftless, to see the truth
My eyes can not believe
Take a look in the mirror
Take a look deep inside your soul
Do you see the trueness in you broken mind?
The unvarnished truth is in your eyes
Take a look into the mirror
Take a look into your own identity
You can see what you really want
You must believe everything what you see

This is the mirror of truth
It reveals your innermost thoughts
The reflection of your body and soul
It is the second sight
This is the mirror, it is the mirror of truth

Take a look into the mirror
Take a look into your own identity
You can see what you really want
You must believe everything what you see
Did you look at yourself in the mirror?
Take a look deep in your soul
And find out who you really are
Find the secrets in you broken heart
