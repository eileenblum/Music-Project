The war is lost on the battlefields
Hordes of terror tyrannised the land
But then a lightning in the sky
The earth is quaking with clouds of dust

Stormy clouds in the sky
The resurrection of the human army
Sprout up out of nowhere
The heroes are back
Rise like a phoenix

Sending back to safe the world
The resurrection of the human army
Sprout up out of nowhere
The heroes are back
Rise like a phoenix

Stormy clouds in the sky
The resurrection of the human army
Sprout up out of nowhere
The heroes are back
Rise like a phoenix

Sending back to safe the world
The resurrection of the human army
Sprout up out of nowhere
The heroes are back
Rise like a phoenix

The human army marching on
Thousands standing face to face
war cries all over the land
The final battle between good and evil

Blood red saturated ground
The enemies butchered all long the line
High in the sky a phoenix
Celebrate his famous victory

Stormy clouds in the sky
The resurrection of the human army
Sprout up out of nowhere
The heroes are back
Rise like a phoenix

Sending back to safe the world
The resurrection of the human army
Sprout up out of nowhere
The heroes are back
Rise like a phoenix
