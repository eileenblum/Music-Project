Hide the light
Forever darkness in my mind
So sad tonight
The overtaking cold dark night

Meander around with no intention
There's only a gleam of light on the horizon
The way is marked with flames on the ground
Is this the way to the world wide reputation

We must follow the flames until aeon's calling
We must follow the flames within a long time
Come and follow the flames to the remote horizon
Come and follow the flames with me my friend
This is a journey to the ups and downs of life
A long, long journey to learn from our defeat
Roaming about a long distance in our whole life
So we must follow the flames before it ends

Hide the light
Forever darkness in my mind
So sad tonight
The overtaking cold dark night

Kill the night
Let's turn the darkness into light
Fight tonight
The overtaking cold dark night

Running fast forward to the top of the stage
The flames burning bright over the place
Humans raising their fists high in the sky
The pray there masters of the flames in the night
