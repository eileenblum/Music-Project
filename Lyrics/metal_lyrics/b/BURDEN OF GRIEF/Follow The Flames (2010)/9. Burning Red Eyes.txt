Walking through a dark black night
Only the moon shines bright at the vault of heaven
I break out in went, begin to run
I feel there is something in the dark, watching me

Running forward no look back
He wants to catch me
His blood red eyes are staring at me
Running, running far away
Don't let him get me
The devil's back again to take my soul

Out in the dark
There is a demon hunting me
Moving like a snake
As a shadow in my dreams
His dark red eyes are burning
Like fire in the night
The devil's back on earth
To saving the souls on the damned

Running forward no look back
He's sure to succeed
His blood red eyes are hunting me
Running but there's no escape
My way is chosen
The devil's back again to take me home

Out in the dark
There is a demon hunting me
Moving like a snake
As a shadow in my dreams
His dark red eyes are burning
Like fire in the night
The devil's back on earth
To saving the souls on the damned
