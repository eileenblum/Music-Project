Another day has come
For your destructive mind
You will go on - to crawl

This conflict deep inside
You cannot longer hide
Still on the run - to fall

I hate you - unbroken
I loathe you - you fool
I hate you - unbroken
I loathe you - you make me sick

Fallen
You're fallen from grace
But now you time has gone
It's you turn to speak

Another day has come
And you're still here to crawl
For all the scars - to come

You can't control your mind
Your reason's hard to find
You'll see the light - no more

I hate you - unbroken
I loathe you - you fool
I hate you - unbroken
I loathe you - you make me sick

Fallen
You're fallen from grace
But now you time has gone
It's you turn to speak

Fallen
You're fallen from grace
But now you time has gone
It's you turn to speak
