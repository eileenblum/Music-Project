Is this the world we are living in
Is this the place where we are
Hate and despair all over the place
Is it real or just a dream

I close my eyes
And feel the wind touching my face
Feel anger, feel pain
But I don't know where I am

I stare at the dark sky outside
Storm clouds allover me
There is thunder and lightning
Is it real or just a dream

I close my eyes
And feel the wind touching my face
Feel anger, feel pain
But I don't know where I am
I close my eyes
And feel the rain touching my face
Hear thunder rand noise
Feel the fear deep inside of me

I want to wake up, let me wake up now
Am I dreaming or is this reality

Through the rain I'm running
Along an endless road in the dark
Confusion deep inside of me
Is there a way out
Is there another side of life
I cannot comprehend what is real

I ask myself what's the meaning of life
I can't understand why we live here
Is there anybody out there who can help me find my way
I cannot escape of all these lies

I close my eyes
And feel the darkness deep inside of me
Feel anger, feel pain
But I don't know where I am
I close my eyes
And I feel the emptiness inside of my heart
Hear nothing at all
Feel the fear deep inside of me
