Sitting in my room at night
Gazing at the sky outside
Just another just goes by
Madness roams my mind
Thinking, searching, looking out
Asking what my life's about
Restless running of my thoughts
Question but no answers

There's a killer and a victim deep inside of me
Confusion about what is meant to be

Maybe I go down the drain
Maybe I can't stop the pain
Waiting for another time
Hoping something clears my mind
Decay and renewal inside of my head
Merciless time is running on

Tired of this endless running
Tired of this endless waiting
Repressing all those ugly thoughts
Nothing gets me out
