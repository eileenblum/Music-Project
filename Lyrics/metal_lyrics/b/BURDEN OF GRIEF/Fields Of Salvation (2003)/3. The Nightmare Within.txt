Risen back from the dead
Human fear feeds my suffocating lust
Haunting screams fill the night
Raped and splattered corpses rise my anger

Bodies - worn out - souls falling down
Butchery - makes me feel - a sense of release

So many years which have passed by
And humans seem to be the same
Dying with or without feelings
Lifeless eyes stare in the dark
Waiting while my victims sleep
Just another game begins
And in their weakest hour
I decide their fate
Waiting while my victims sleep
Just another game begins
And in their weakest hour
I decide their fate

Malice - in my chest - just destroy subsistence

Certain death crawling nearer
Senseless moments interrupt the strain
Smash your body, rape your soul
And your nightmare starts again
