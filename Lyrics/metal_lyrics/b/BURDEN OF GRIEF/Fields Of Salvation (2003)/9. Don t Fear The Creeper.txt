Take care, beware
'cause the night is watching you
Out there in the dark
There is a demon out of control
He comes every spring
And then he wants to eat
He eats every part of all body
To stay alive
He is the one, he's on the hunt
Blood marks his way, with countless corpses
He will get you, 'cause he smells your fear
So please run away, and don't turn around

Don't turn around when you hear these words

Jeepers Creepers is what you hear
Jeepers Creepers the demon is near

He comes every spring
And then he wants to eat
So be careful and watch out
When you hear these words

Jeepers Creepers is what you hear
Jeepers Creepers your death is near
Jeepers Creepers he is hunting you
Jeepers Creepers and cripple you

Take care, beware
'cause the demon's smelling you
Out there he is
And he wants a piece of you
