Come with me into my own land
I will show you heaven eternally
You see what I see, you feel what I feel

My paradise is your demise
And your demise is my surprise

I am a demon inside of your head
I am the evil I'm your death
I show you heaven, show you hell
Land of disaster and decay

Come with me into my land
I will show you what you'll get
A place in heaven on earth
A place in paradise

Fly away with me, to a place where we can be
Fly away with me, to another place

Life's to live - death's to die - to the end we fly

Come with me into my own land
I will show you heaven eternally
You see what I see, you feel what I feel

Come with me now, away from here
I will take your soul for eternity
You see the darkness, you see the hell in your own heart
