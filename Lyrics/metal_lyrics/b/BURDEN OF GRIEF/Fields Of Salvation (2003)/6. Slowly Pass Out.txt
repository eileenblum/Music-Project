You can hate me (if you want)
You can punch me (into my face)

I got out Friday night
Have some beer, let's rock tonight
Metal music, heads bang
The mood is great, people sing
The party goes on and on
The music's loud, all girls are hot
So much beer slowly fills me up
Until my brain's a big huge mess
I lose my sense, I'm out of control
So I take some drugs to cheer me up
The power flows right through my veins
And takes control of my body and soul

I take a trip into another sphere
Don't realize what happens to me now
Hallucinations confuse me so
Colors and noise are one big blur
But I feel great, so very alive
I dance all night and love the girls
Then a punch, pain and blood everywhere
I'm on the ground slowly pass out

I wake up 'cause somehow I'm cold
Hungry, bloody, aching and sick
Where am I, I'm in the ditch
There's so much dirt and puke everywhere
I don't remember last night
My brain is in a confused mental state
Now I need more of these drugs
Because tonight begins the same shit again
