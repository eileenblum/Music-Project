I can smell the blood on the floor
And I open the door to my fate
See the dying see the pain
Feel the anguish of my hate
I don't understand
What this vision will forever mean for me
I get captured and confused
When wondering about the meaning of my life
I walk down a long way to hell
With blood on my hands from those people who I wish to kill
See the dying, see the pain
Feel the anguish of me hate

I slowly come back into my life of misery
I don't understand why hate burns inside of me
I don't know what's the sense of life and death
Can I glide into heavens shore

I walk a path to the horizon
Blinded by the blackness of my mind
With endless yearning for salvation
I glide into heavens shore
