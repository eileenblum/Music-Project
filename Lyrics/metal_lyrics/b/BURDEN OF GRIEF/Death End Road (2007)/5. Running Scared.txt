Running through the darkness of the night
Running away of all these lies
Errantry in the streets of modern life
Paved with rules they don't make sense

Falling - falling - falling down into an endless illusion
Crawling - crawling - crawling on the knees and pray for a better time

They want to determine our lives with acts and forms
Confusing for the little citizens
Wasting money for senseless things driving people into ruin
I will escape of all this shit

Running through the darkness of the night
Running away of all these lies
Errantry in the streets of modern life
Paved with rules they don't make sense

[Pre-Chorus:]
Falling - falling - falling down into an endless illusion
Crawling - crawling - crawling on the knees and pray for a better time
Falling - falling - falling down into my innermost being
Dreaming - dreaming - dreaming of a world that shows us no lies

[Chorus:]
I am running disillusioned without an aim
I disguised my feelings, close my eyes and running scared
Falling down into the deep, my body's flying
Unclasped of this world sinking deep in my innermost being

They told us what to do, pushed us into a corner
This is making our lives a misery
I want to run my life I only will escape
And then I'm creeping away in my own thoughts

Skedaddle in the darkness of the night
Bolt away of all these lies
Escaping from the streets of modern life
Paved with rules they don't make sense

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

My innermost being...
