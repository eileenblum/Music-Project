Father can you help me I am dying tonight, the ritual begins
Misery, no escape, captivity
Misery, no escape, captivity in hell

Going down the stairs follow my voice
Feel the evil words I say
You surely don't have to be afraid
I will only rescue you, I rescue you

Going down into the depths of my empire
I will lead you on your way
Misery, no escape, captivity
Misery, no escape, captivity in hell

[Chorus:]
It is the passion of the night
The fascination when souls are burning
Seducer in the dark
I am the master of the souls

Going down the stairs follow my voice
I will dash your hope of life
You surely don't have to be afraid
I will take your soul today, I rescue you

I am the evil one I'm damned in hell
My only obsession is when souls are burning
I am the ruler of the dark land
This is my curse, I am the master of the souls

Going down the stairs follow my voice
I will dash your hope of life
You surely don't have to be afraid
I will take your soul today, I take your soul

Going down into the depths of my empire
I will burn your soul in hell

Going down into the depths of my empire
I will burn your soul in hell
Misery, no escape, captivity
Misery, no escape, captivity in hell

[Chorus]
