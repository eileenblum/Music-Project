Wake up every day, try to find my way
Walking down a long road in this game I have to play
But the rules are difficult, not easy to understand
I must find a way to cheat the death eventually

In the sickness of my mind, in the darkness of the night
I must try to play this game and win someday

It is the game of life I try to play
It is the game I try to win some day
But the rules are difficult, I don't understand
I must find the answer of the meaning by myself

[Pre-Chorus:]
Try to find the sense of life
In the sickness of my mind
Try to find all the answers in me

[Chorus (x2):]
We are all chess pieces in a large game
Only puppets in a world we have created
But for what a reason it makes no sense for me
Why do we live on earth when death's the only solution

It is the game of life I have to play
It is the game I try to solve some day
But I can't figure it out, I don't understand
I must find the answer in the depths of myself

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
