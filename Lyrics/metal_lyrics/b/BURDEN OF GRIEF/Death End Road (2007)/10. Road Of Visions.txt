I wander through the night
My eyes they are too blind to see
Where is the love where my hope?
I can't remember the better days in my live
I'm walking down the death end road

[Chorus:]
I walking down into the depths of the night
With no sense into my mind
I'm leaving all behind me
There is no turning back for me
This is the way to my visions
This is the death end road I go

There is a light, far away at the end
I try to reach it but the way seems endless long
Walking faster I leave all my thoughts behind
I'm walking down the death end road

[Chorus]

I reach the light and raise my hands into the sky
It holds me tight it holds me warm
The end of nothing, the beginning of an unknown way
I went down the death end road

[Chorus]
