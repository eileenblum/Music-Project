I am a killer, my mind was black
I am the saviour, you'll never come back

Saving from life, saving from dark mind
Saving from all your evil thoughts
I am the one whom honour is due
I am the only one who's delivering you

[Pre-Chorus (x2):]
Killer in me, killer in me, it's the killer in me, a sinner

[Chorus:]
It is the life of a sinner in me, I am not a winner indeed
It's just the killer in me
This is my way of repentance, the course to make examples
There's only just a sinner in me

Saving from life, saving from dark mind
Saving from all your evil thoughts
Dark is my whole life dark is my soul
Killing is my only satisfaction
I am the bearer of death
The grim reaper, a dash of mystery

[Pre-Chorus x2]
[Chorus]

The life of a sinner in me, I am not a winner indeed
It's just the killer in me

Dark is my whole life dark is my soul
Slaying is my only religion
Everyone gets what he deserves
I'm just the one who executes
Instructions from another plain
Instructions from the darkest of my brain

[Pre-Chorus x2]
[Chorus]

The life of a sinner in me, I am not a winner indeed
It's just the killer in me

It is the sinner in me
It's just the killer in me
The killer...
