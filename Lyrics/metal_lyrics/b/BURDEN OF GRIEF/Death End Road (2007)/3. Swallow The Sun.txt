I am looking out my window
Thinking of the world these days and I ask myself why
Why there's so much pain and rancor
Why there's war and poverty outside today

Living in a dark age where people live in fear this time
Drowning in the seas of life, humankind is lost tonight

I watch it every day on TV
See the people in the smut starving in their misery
Lifeless children in their parents arms
Lifeless bodies on the ground, the world is dying

Living in a dark age where people live in fear this time
Drowning in the seas of life, humankind is lost tonight

[Pre-Chorus (x2):]
I am out of my mind
I can't bear this shit
I cannot comprehend
I wonder why...

[Chorus (x2):]
I wonder how I wonder why
There is no sense in the world outside

I see terrorists killing
Bombing innocent people in the streets
Wounded bodies, thousand corpses
Killing, terror everywhere, for what a reason

Living in a dark age where people live in fear this time
Drowning in the seas of life, humankind is lost tonight

At the thought of this sick world
It is grim for me to recognize
Why there's so much pain and hatred
Why there's war and poverty outside today

Living in a dark age where people live in fear this time
Drowning in the seas of life, humankind is lost tonight

[Pre-Chorus x2]
[Repeat Chorus x2]
