I try to look around, but nothing I can see
Where am I lying? Or am I dying?
I only feel coldness and pain inside

Awaken in the cold my hands are cold as stone
Where am I now where lies my body down?

I try to look around, my eyes heavy like lead
Where am I lying? Or am I dying?
I only feel coldness and see the darkness

[Pre-Chorus:]
Darkness all around my body
Panic in my confused mind
I think I'm lying in a coffin
I think that I am...

[Chorus:]
Lying in the cold this moment
Darkness all around me
I am lying here alone only for myself

No one hears my cry for help
No one's there to warm me up
I am lying in the cold, dying here alone

Lying in the cold
Darkness all around
Crying here alone
Dying here alone

Implicitly in a little chest, panic in my mind
No door no window no escape captured for all time
My body's knotted, my eyes open wide
I calmly meet my fate, I am buried alive
I only feel coldness and see the darkness

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
