Slowly - I woke up this morning
Nightmares - nightmares of last night
Visions - blurred imagery
Darkness - in my confused mind

My brain hurts like hell the aftermath of last night
Blood on my hands and no reminder why
What can I do, what have I done?
Is it just a joke or have I killed someone?

I can't remember why
I don't know what's wrong with me

Visions - blurred imagery
Darkness - in my confused mind

My brain hurts like hell the aftermath of last night
Blood on my hands and no reminder why
What can I do, what have I done?
Is this just a joke or have I killed someone?

Remembrance of my life
Obscured from the night
I can't remember why
I don't know what's wrong with me

I'm on the road to my perdition
Is this the curse or only visions?
Hazy pictures all around me
Darkness inside my brain

Fleeing - is the only way
Running - running far away
Coward - I am holing up
Darkness - in my confused mind

My brain hurts like hell I can't remember why
No blood on my hands and no reminder why
Nothing I can do, nothing have I done
This was just a dream a nightmare, evil one

[Chorus (x2):]
Remembrance of my life
Obscured from the night
This was just a dream
A nightmare, evil one
