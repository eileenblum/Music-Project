Schizophrenic

Let's get down to brass tacks
I am your incubus
The demon in your life
The pain by your side
I am your master, only bring disaster
I am in your mind I designate your life

Schizophrenic, distortion of thoughts
Hallucinations, voices in my brain
Disorder and depressions of all sense
No self control, only perplexity

[Chorus (x2):]
Dark desire in my feelings
Dark emotions in my mind
At the abyss of my being
Broken fragments of my mind

Paranoia

Let me in your brain
I specify your life
The only friend you have
Is right by your side
Don't look at others, only look at me
I am your god, you can do evil with me

Schizophrenic, distortion of thoughts
Paranoia, anxiety to the world
Sensations of fear and distrust
A life between heaven and hell

[Chorus x2]
