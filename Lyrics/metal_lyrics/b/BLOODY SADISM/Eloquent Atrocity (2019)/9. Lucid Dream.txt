Once upon a time
There was a whore
Who fucked up all my mind
I wanted to find her dead
She was bleeding
Cause of the knife that I put it in her heart
Bleed, suffer her, right now, butcher her
Shiva died, in my bed
Shiva died, exactly beside me
Shiva mord, Shiva mord, Shiva mord, in my heart
NOâ¦
Slice her damn corpse, you have to suffer
Right now, do it, get back to default
I went there Shiva was dead
I knew that she was a whore
I didn't want to do this to her
I didn't like butcher and dismember
Shiva mord Shiva mord, she's dead in my heart
I didn't want to hurt her
I'm regret of what I've done to her
