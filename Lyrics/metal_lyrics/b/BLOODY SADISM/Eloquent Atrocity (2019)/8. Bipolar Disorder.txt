Suffering is my religion
No one can illustration of it
Test it just with me
You, will see
No one is better than me on this
No one is my damn rival on this
Show me what you got for this
Show me what you got for that
Suffering wants two big bulls to do
Suffering requires a real man to be followed
See me on this
I'm your god
See me and this
Before you be killed

Suffocation is first of all
You have to know
See me how can
I do it without the fear
I see no one can stand in front of me
You have to be god to stay in front of me
Hey, see, me
It, makes me
Died in the darkness
Conflicts with the madness
Died in the darkness
Suffer and torture are my traditions
I see no one can stand in front of me
You have to be god to stay in front of me, even
HE
Go now, suffer, go now before you be fucked up
Go now, without, everything you left with me
Go to kill, see me, what do you see?, a guilty ?, yeah it's me
Forgive me just this time, don't suffer this time
You must to be dead, there isn't a chance

Suffering is the way to be clean forever
You had your chance,
All of your life
You have to pay cause of what you did
DIE...
