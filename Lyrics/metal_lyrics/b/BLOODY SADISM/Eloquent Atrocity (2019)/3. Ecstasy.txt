Suffer now
It's almost time
Now you're all alone you're coming with something to me but you're still a kid for these you put it, in your vein, as you looking to me you don't know, what will be happened suffocate, pursiness, bleeding, wrong vein
I told you're a kid for these
Think about your mom and pa
Fear of the frustration
Now you're receive to me
You can't run away from me
All of us are guilty
Suffocation with the bleed
Save me from this
I know
I was such a pig
Save me this time
I won't do anything

I promise
I won't do anything
