Majestic and unconquered you appear to my eye
You've kept the pride of olden days

My mind is taken back when I touch you
And I can hear great seas moaning
Cut asunder by your power
In deadly dance of fire
To the lost coasts
You were taking the unconquered ancient times

And though my sun of glory set
Nobody ever shall forget
The terror of my name
And oft shall ancient heroes rise
New planets in these northern skies
Through clouds of blood and flame

The Moon blesses your grand shape with light
Fierce winds will fill your weaved dress anew
You wake up to the Gods' call
Ready for the last march
Oh I yearn for your touch
