Cold is my yell
As cold as sites of ancient fires
Like hell
My mind is burning with recollections of great days
My spirit's just the fierce force of northern gales
It seeks to break away like hell

The flame within my soul is flaring up again
There's no more doubt in my heart no chains
Strength is my nature firm will to win has been collected

I feel approach of last and fatal battle
The sky is lightened with queer crimson dashes
I will pour out my hate and threaten
My foes my wrath my hate will turn them into ashes

The shadows gather round and
Fill my soul with gloom
They never would compound
So I accept my doom
