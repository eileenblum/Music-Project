On that day flowed the river of blood
In groans tearing skies hope was dying
Every drop of this flood took it away into mud
Cold earth was crying
On that day the river of blood was flowing
On that day heroes were born their power was growing

Black chains on my hands are pulling down to earth
My blades are captured
Alas
I wish I fell like my brothers but cruel fate
With out demur dictates
I hate to live on
Alone

Quick as lighting my appeal will dash off
Night feel my will
With pain call to arm
Will pierce the mind
Again their anger will shudder earth
None will flee
They will rise to follow the call to fight

But now at night
I can hear hopeful voice
She calls to me
My fate is not to be with thee

The first sun beam
I hear the rustle you approach
I never thought I could so close feel your embrace

Thud of hoofs clink of blades storm of arrows
All as one
That was price for their death
Heroes are not to be forgot

On that day flowed the river of blood
Honor outraged was restored
