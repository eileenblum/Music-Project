Endless days he spend in vain attempts to find his calling
With the gaze that night absorbed
Yet

Like mournful soul hope that was killed was lost forever
Was cradled was consoled by blackness
Will heal never

Tormenting wound that bears for ages my damnation
Is being in heaven mourned in deep distress by angels

Mighty Father help my to find my self
So that I could see my predestination

Torn to pieces, destroyed is his perception
Hope is gone but he tries to find salvation

The light of absolution hidden by the scales
Of sufferings from his eyes shone warming his tired soul
Exhausted by everlasting wanderings
Blood did not warm the cold stone against my hope
Search for fate was cut by death
