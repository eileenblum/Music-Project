These words are burning inside of me
Spend years in liquid harmony
This dream is who I wanna be
Youth and whisky

I grew from those who hate me
Stead fast to a razor-blade symphony
Cigarettes n' lyrics made me
Youth and whisky

Can you see,
Can you see me?
I'm strong from what they made me
These angels,
Who carry me,
They taught me
Youth and whisky

Baptized in smoke and misery
A loaded gun and a bastard's history
My temple's for the crazy
Youth and whisky

No sorrow left inside me
Celebrate the moments behind me
This shot is Holy Mary
Youth and whisky

Can you see,
Can you see me?
I'm strong from what they made me
These angels,
Who carry me,
They taught me
Youth and whisky

Hey hey!
Brothers..
Hey hey!
Fighters..
Hey hey!
Bottles living for another round
Hey hey!
Lovers..
Hey hey!
Liars..
Hey hey!
Throttles speeding towards a black out

Black out!

Can you see,
Can you see me?
I'm strong from what they made me
These angels,
Who carry me,
They taught me
Youth and whisky
