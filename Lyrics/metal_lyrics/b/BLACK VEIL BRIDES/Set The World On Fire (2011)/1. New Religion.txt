Welcome to your life
We have got you in our sights
And thoughts of God are better left alone
It's in your head, black and blue
What they told you wasn't true
Come along and fight the unknown
The army's grown

We'll pray to all the wrong decisions,
Woah oh oh
This time you'll show all that you can be
Woah oh oh
Grab your weapons now, we'll run against the crowd
And changing history

So
Let's take the vow
We will show you how
Your time has come for the new religion
Your voice is proud
Be your savior now
The battle's won for the new religion

No one can defeat what the congregation speaks
Bound together, the flag that we defend
They made a fool out of you
But you knew just what to do
Raise your fists up and stand until the end
Amen

We'll pray to all the wrong decisions
Woah oh oh
This time you'll show all that you can be
Woah oh oh
Grab your weapons now, we'll run against the crowd
And changing history

So
Let's take the vow
We will show you how
Your time has come for the new religion
Your voice is proud
Be your savior now
The battles won for the new religion

Come now and imagine with me
Taking back a world that once was ours
Let's regain the power
And then we will end what we've begun

Let's take the vow
We will show you how
Your time has come for the new religion
Your voice is proud
Be your savior now
The battles won for the new religion

We are the unholy
We are the bastard sons of your media culture
Our minds, eyes and bodies were born of your exclusion
And illusion you hide behind
You don't love a God, you love your comfort
To you were are filth, we are dirty, so be it

We are dirty and unclean, a congregation of the unseen
Together we will set this world on fire
This is the new religion
Amen!
