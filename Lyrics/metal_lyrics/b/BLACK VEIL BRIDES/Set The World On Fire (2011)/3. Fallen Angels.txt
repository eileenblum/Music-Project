Scream, shout, scream, shout, we are the fallen angels

We are the in between, cast down as sons of war,
Struck to the earth like lightning on this world we're torn,
We won't cause the pain, of living out their law,
Take joy in who you are we know our wings are flawed

We're bored to death in heaven, and all alone in hell,
We only want to be ourselves

We scream (We scream) we shout (We shout)
We are the fallen angels, we scream (We scream)
We shout, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh,
To those who sing alone, no need to feel this sorrow,
We scream (We scream) we shout whoa,
We are the fallen angels

Follow the morning star, A light when darkness fell,
The passion left unholy now you find yourself,
We have nowhere to go, no one to wish us well,
A cry to find our home, our stories they will tell

We're bored to death in heaven, and all alone in hell,
We only want to be ourselves

We scream (We scream) we shout (We shout)
We are the fallen angels, we scream (We scream)
We shout, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh,
To those who sing alone, no need to feel this sorrow,
We scream (We scream) we shout whoa,
We are the fallen angels

Scream, shout, we are the fallen angels,
Scream, shout, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh
We scream (We scream) we shout (We shout)
We are the fallen angels, we scream (We scream)
We shout, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh,
To those who sing alone, no need to feel this sorrow,
We scream (We scream) we shout whoa,
We are the fallen angels

We scream, we shout, we are the fallen angels,
We scream, we shout, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-ohh,
Whoa-oh-oh-ohh, we shout whoa, we are the fallen angels
