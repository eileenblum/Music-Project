Saints born together to fight against their holy fables
The streets are where we pray
Hymns for the lonely, wretched and forgotten
The feeling in our hearts wont ever fade away

We stand tall ( United! )
Watch them fall ( Divided! )
Break the chains and now we'll show them all ( Fight! )

Fight for all you know
When your back's against the wall
Stand against the liars
Stronger than before
When your life becomes a war,
Set the world on fire

Sing out united against the ones you left in hatred
Our message of today
Like children crying when all they knew was dying
And we will raise our flags up
Its time for them to pay

We stand tall ( United! )
Watch them fall ( Divided! )
Break the chains and now we'll show them all ( Fight! )

Fight for all you know
When your back's against the wall
Stand against the liars
Stronger than before
When your life becomes a war
Set the world on fire

(Woah ohh)
So sing it loud you hold the key
(Woah ohh)
We're the rebels and we're free
(Woah ohh)
Its time to burn all that you see
(Woah ohh)
Now the world belongs to me

Fight for all you know
When your back's against the wall
Stand against the liars
Stronger than before
When your life becomes a war
Set the world on fire

Proud in all you are
Showing every scar
As your badge of honor
When you can't take anymore
Of what they're living for
Set the world on fire
