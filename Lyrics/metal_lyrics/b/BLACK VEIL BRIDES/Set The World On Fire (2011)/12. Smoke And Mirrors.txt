[Bonus Track]Quiet as I watch you falling
You become a pray again
I can see your skin is crawling
Lipstick cases and sins

Wake up Wake up  Wake up
Youâre drowning
Same old song and dance 
Wake up Wake up Wake up
My Darling
Never stood a chance

Lost in another one
And itâs just so far
An Illusion
Itâs all just smoke and mirrors
Always chasing scars 
Never gets you far 
An illusion 
Itâs all just smoke and mirrors

I hear it in her voice, sheâs stalling
âYou were just another manâ
Your claims of love are falling
Now itâs clear you canât win

Wake up wake up wake up
Heartâs pounding
 Praying for romance
Wake up wake up wake up
Itâs sounding
Time to try again

Lost in another one
And itâs just so far
An Illusion
Itâs all just smoke and mirrors
Always chasing scars 
Never gets you far 
An illusion 
Itâs all just smoke and mirrors

Iâd rather be alone
Then watch you outgrow
And lose my faith in smoke and mirrors

Black painted eyes
Cover the lies
Itâs time you threw away your cruel disguise

Lost in another one
Now itâs just so far
An illusion
Itâs all just smoke and mirrors
Always chasing scars
Never gets you far
An illusion 
Itâs all just smoke and mirrors

Iâd rather be alone 
Then watch you outgrow
And lose my faith in smoke and mirrors
