Weâre all told that when we die
We leave to a better place
And all I know is what you left;
A love I canât erase

All the same in love and war
Burn my name and ashes scorn

You left me with these broken lies
And I let you
Got no more time for your goodbyes
So God bless you
God bless you

Shed those faded memories
This is your curtain call
Iâve had enough of sympathy
Itâs time to watch you fall

All the same in love and war

You left me with these broken lies
And I let you
Got no more time for your goodbyes
So God bless you
So God bless you
God bless you
God bless you
God bless you

You left me with these broken lies
And I let you
Got no more time for your goodbyes
So God bless you
You left me with these broken lies
And I let you
Got no more time for your goodbyes
So God bless you
So God bless you
God bless you
God bless you

God bless you
