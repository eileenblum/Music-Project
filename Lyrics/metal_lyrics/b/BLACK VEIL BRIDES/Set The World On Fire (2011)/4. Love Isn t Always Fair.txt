One look and I am sold
You got me on my knees
You steal all my innocence
A love sick melody

Take meâ¦

You always want the one that you canât have
Cuzâ love isnât always fair
You are the best romance Iâve never had
Cuzâ love isnât always fair

Your kiss, a withered rose
Your lips have buried me
Hearts race the moments gone
We shared this fantasy

Take meâ¦

You always want the one that you canât have
Cuzâ love isnât always fair
You are the best romance Iâve never had
Cuzâ love isnât always fair

Kneel and pray for closure baby
This is the ride that weâre on, oh
Iâm taking what you give to me
Never want it to stop,
I want it all

In this temporary love

You always want the one that you canât have
Cuzâ love isnât always fair
You are the best romance Iâve never had
Cuzâ love isnât always fair

(Woah oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohâ¦)

Love isnât always fair!
