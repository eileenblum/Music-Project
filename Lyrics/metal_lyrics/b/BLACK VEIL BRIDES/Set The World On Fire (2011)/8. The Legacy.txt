Racing faster,
Escape disaster,
Partners in crime will leave their mark
We make our own way,
No thoughts of yesterday,
Black hearts of chrome and battle scars
(Chrome and battle scars)
Woah-ohhhh

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings,
Rose from the streets,
With the hand on destiny

We came from nothing,
But promised one thing,
We'll change the world with these guitars
So listen closely,
And don't stop working,
No one can tell you who you are
(Tell you who you are)
Woah-ohhhh

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings,
Rose from the streets,
With the hand on destiny

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings,
Rose from the streets,
With the hand on destiny

Arggggh
GO!
RUN!
(Run)
RUN!
Never look back!
RUN!
(Run)
RUN!
Never look back!
Run!
Run!
Run!
And never look back!
Ruuuun!

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings,
Rose from the streets,
With the hand on destiny

The legacy
Born from a dream
On leather wings,
Rose from the streets,
With the hand on destiny
