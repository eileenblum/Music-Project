Now our lives have changed, I wish that I could heal
Time has taken love, a darker side revealed
For every lie begins, with what we used to feel

Bring my sins under these chains and livin' in pain
Under your tears everything's gone, is it too late? Walk away!

A lonely heart will mend, until we know the truth
But if it stays the same, can we make it through?
A life without the hurt, a life without you

Blame my sins under these chains, livin' in pain
Under your tears everything's gone, is it too late? Walk away!
Everything's gone, everything's gone
Blame my sins under these chains, livin' in pain

Under your tears everything's gone, is it too late?
Walk away (everything's gone)
Walk away (everything's gone)
Walk away
A life without you, everything's gone
A life without you, everything's gone
