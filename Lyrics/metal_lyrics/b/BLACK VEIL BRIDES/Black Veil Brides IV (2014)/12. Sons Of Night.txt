[Best Buy Bonus Track]We are dust and bone, a temple's made of stone
We have seen it all, even watch our armies fall
We are mysteries, secrets that they keep
So that they won't show, stories that you'll never know

When war begins, we'll ride again

Tonight, our chapter will begin
It's time, to wash away the sins
And no one can deny, we are the Sons of Night
We're driving faster through our pain
No more, waiting for a change
Black crosses stop the light, embrace the Sons of Night

Wear a mask of shame, hiding all the pain
That the world has taught, every word and evil thoughts
Courage hides the truth, rubbing on the youth
Of the given rights, heaven let the world ignite

When shadows crawl, you're not alone

Tonight, our chapter will begin
It's time, to wash away the sins
And no one can deny, we are the Sons of Night
We're driving faster through our pain
No more, waiting for a change
Black crosses stop the light, embrace the Sons of Night

Tonight, our chapter will begin
It's time, to wash away the sins
And no one can deny, we are the Sons of Night

Tonight, our chapter will begin
It's time, to wash away the sins
And no one can deny, we are the Sons of Night
We're driving faster through our pain
No more, waiting for a change
Black crosses stop the light, embrace the Sons of Night
