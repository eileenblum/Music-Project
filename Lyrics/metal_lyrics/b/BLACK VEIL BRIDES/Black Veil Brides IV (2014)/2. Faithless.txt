Behold the new hate with all the same
Lost values
Forsake what lives deeper
In death we're all believers

Raised up your sirens
Break through the silence
We are united in the seach of
Something more

Cross your heart
Open you mind
Hide your face in their disguise

Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the sun
But I will never be the faithless one

No I will never be the faithless one

Refuse to destroy
The altars we are serving
The truth in living
Is that our souls are seaching

Live with defiance
It's time to fight
Don't ever let them keep your words
From being heard

Cross your heart
Open your mind
Hide your face in their disguise

Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the sun
But I will never be the faithless one

No I will never be the faithless one

Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the sun
But I will never be the faithless one

Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I will never look up to the sun
But now I wanna be the faithless one

No I will never be the faithless one
But I will never be the faithless one
