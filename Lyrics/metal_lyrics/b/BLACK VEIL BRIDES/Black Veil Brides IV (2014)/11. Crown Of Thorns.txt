Seven years have come and gone
All that's left are scriptures songs
Livin' with the pieces of my memory
And now gone all the dyin' and kill all the blamed and hoped
When Moses dies who is left to hide the moonlight?

I will walk through hell in these words I've fell
Striving into your arms
With this crown of thorns
With my crown of thorns

Drag me into sky black lungs, give you hope to rise above
And I watch you wonder who I had to be
And I'm not the Messiah and I can't feel broken hope
I'll give you my life and my pride to live through tonight

I will walk through hell in these words I've fell
Striving into your arms
With this crown of thorns
With my crown of thorns

Faith incumbent through the darkness
Sins of comin' we've become of

I will walk through hell in these words I've fell
Striving into your arms
With this crown of thorns
With my crown of thorns
