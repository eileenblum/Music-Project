I see you lived illusions
Pictured life with your conclusions
I don't know how to tell you
This path has lost its value
With lies of shroud I walk
I suffer a loss of life
I am the social hero

Oh poor man, in a time that's broken
I pray to the heroes of the damned
I sing with dull devotion
A song for the ones behind the mask
I can't feel false ideal
Another fool that's blind to what's real
I sing for the hopeless, broken
They live for the stolen omen

I see this, I know pain
Let's see you try aaaaah
You got me enter my mask
They awake the priest, aaah
With lies of shroud I walk
I suffer a loss of life
I am the social hero

Oh poor man, in a time that's broken
I pray to the heroes of the damned
I sing with dull devotion
A song for the ones behind the mask
I can't feel false ideal
Another fool that's blind to what's real
I sing for the hopeless, broken
They live for the stolen omen
