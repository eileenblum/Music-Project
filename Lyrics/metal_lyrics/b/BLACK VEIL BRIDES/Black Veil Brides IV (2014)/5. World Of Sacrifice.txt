We're faithful broken promises of the lies
The virtues beaten down into your empty eyes
A saint is not a weapon, it's a message, a message.
A sermon of shame, a demon that you want to blame
Sell you, change you, leave you in a world of flames.
Pain is not a blessing, it's a lesson, a lesson

Don't bow down to a world of hate
From your cradle to the grave.

Cause even if you sacrifice beliefs to get through
And even if you take the side of lies over truth
Everyday the world will take what you give in to.
So hold on to every breath of life in a world of sacrifice.

A personal slave the one you left to die in vain
Sold you, changed you, taught you all their selfish ways.
Faith becomes an addiction not ambition, ambition

Don't bow down to a world of hate
From your cradle to the grave

Even if you sacrifice beliefs to get through
And even if you take the side of lies over truth
Everyday the world will take, what you give in to.
So hold on to every breath of life in a world of sacrifice.

Hold on, in a world of sacrifice
Hold on, until your last breath is gone
Hold on, in a world of sacrifice
Hold on, until your last breath is gone
