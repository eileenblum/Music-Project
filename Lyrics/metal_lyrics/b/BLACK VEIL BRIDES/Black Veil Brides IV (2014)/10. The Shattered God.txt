Failure and apathy descend
Success just hasn't been your friend
You live a lie high as the sky
This taste like iron blood and greed
Tell us of what you'll never be
I won't ask why, just let it die

Sleeping tight in your insanity
The truth could remedy

You stole it all, sold them your soul give it up,
You are, you are forever alone
Casting your stones, give it up
You are, you are the shattered god

I try with every ounce of hell
to pry you open from your shell
Twisting the knife
Regretting your life
Your eyes are empty like your bed
Somehow you haven't whelmed up dead
Chances passed by
You'll never fly

Singing hymns about the sins you see
But you'll never hear from me

You stole it all, sold them your soul give it up,
You are, you are forever alone
Casting your stones, give it up
You are, you are the shattered god

Feel the embrace, all of the hate
I have watched you fall
Finding your words sounding like silence
You've already set it all

You stole it all, sold them your soul give it up,
You are, you are forever alone
Casting your stones, give it up
You are, you are the shattered god
