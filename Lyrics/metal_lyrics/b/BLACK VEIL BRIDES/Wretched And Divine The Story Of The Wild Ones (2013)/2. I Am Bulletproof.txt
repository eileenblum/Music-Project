Here we go
Holding onto lies, holding onto ties that vanished
Cut the rope
And fall into the sky, the devil filled our minds with sadness

The worldâs a gun and Iâve been aiming all my life

Got something to live for, I know that I wonât surrender
A warrior of youth
Iâm taking over, a shot to the new world order
I am Bulletproof

Here I go
Another prison flight, another perfect sky I damaged
Now I know
Just who created life and why I set my sights to save it

The worldâs a gun and Iâve been aiming all my life

Got something to live for, I know that I wonât surrender
A warrior of youth
Iâm taking over, a shot to the new world order
I am Bulletproof
And as they take their final breath, I have built the truth
Iâm taking over a shot to the new world order
I am Bulletproof
