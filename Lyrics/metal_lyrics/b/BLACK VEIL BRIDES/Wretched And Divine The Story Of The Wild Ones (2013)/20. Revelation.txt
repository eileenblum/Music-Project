[Deluxe/Ultimate Edition Bonus Track]The Glory of a Nation dies
The Symbol of this War is coming
A Warning meant to save our lives from F.E.A.R.'s Religion

Out of the depths we crawl to light
Never Give In when the Fire rises
Standing here we are unified our Hearts bear crosses

Can't turn back now

We are
We are the Revelation
So scream it out loud
We are
We are the Birth of a Nation
So join as one
It's time to raise our flags up high
We are
We are the Revelation
So scream it out loud

Wooo..
The Sound of a Nation
Wooo..

There are no Stars in the Sky
No sight of what was Freedom
Where do we turn when our Brothers die in a Fight worth winning?

We are Legions mesmerized
By the fools that killed our vision
Won't stray or apologize for their decisions

Can't turn back now

We are
We are the Revelation
So scream it out loud
We are
We are the Birth of a Nation
So join as one
It's time to raise our flags up high
We are
We are the Revelation
So scream it out loud

Wooo..
The Sound of a Nation
Wooo..
The Sound of a Nation

Can't turn back now

We are
We are the Revelation
So scream it out loud
We are
We are the Birth of a Nation
So join as one
It's time to raise our flags up high
We are
We are the Revelation
So scream it out loud

Wooo..
The Sound of a Nation
Wooo..
The Sound of a Nation
