Iâll die fighting, inside me thereâs a fire that burns
My life begins and ends without the faith that we learn

Save me from the darkest places
Save me from myself

Iâm a loaded gun, an only son
But Iâm Nobodyâs Hero
Iâve come undone, Iâm on the run
Yeah Iâm Nobodyâs Hero
Nobodyâs Hero

To heal your scars I will give you everything I can
This war of hearts, we will rise again and take a stand

I can lead you to salvation yet I am just a man

Iâm a loaded gun, an only son
But Iâm Nobodyâs Hero
Iâve come undone, Iâm on the run
Yeah Iâm Nobodyâs Hero
Nobodyâs Hero

This martyrs cross gets too heavy to exist
And we feel the loss of the lives I left to risk

Iâm a loaded gun, an only son
But Iâm Nobodyâs Hero
Iâve come undone, Iâm on the run
Yeah Iâm Nobodyâs Hero
Nobodyâs Hero
