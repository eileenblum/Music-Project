Youâve been running for so long, still breathing
Hoping soon to find a song worth singing
Every chapter of this note, theyâre reading
But youâre slowly losing hope on bleeding

Iâll carry you my darkest desire
When life sings to you
Through Devilâs Choirs
F.E.A.R. wonât steal what burns in you
Iâll carry you away from the fire

My desire, Devilâs Choirs
My desire, Devilâs Choirs

Raise another broken glass to failure
A simple promise of a crimson saviour
Take a look into the life youâre leaving
I promise you this isnât pain youâre feeling

Iâll carry you my darkest desire
When life sings to you
Through Devilâs Choirs
F.E.A.R. wonât steal what burns in you
Iâll carry you away from the fire

My desire, Devilâs Choirs
My desire, Devilâs Choirs
