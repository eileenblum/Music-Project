All the graves of the ones remembered in a desert we call home
All the slaves of the cold December find a voice to call their own
Stand up we are united in the eyes of the greatest storm
Line up we are ignited, this world will be reborn inâ¦

Five, Four, Three, Two, One

This is New Yearâs Day â so rise from the ashes
Faith will find a way- like lightning crashes
Weâll keep marching on and on and on...
Itâs New Yearâs Day, so rise from the ashes

Ring a bell so the serpent hears us
Let her know that weâre tried and true
No the beasts, they wont get near usâ¦ and weâre not scared of you
Light âem up now
Start the count down inâ¦

Five, Four, Three, Two, One
Letâs go!

This is New Yearâs Day â so rise from the ashes
Faith will find a way- like lightning crashes
Weâll keep marching on and on and on...
Itâs New Yearâs Day, so rise from the ashes

Let the eagle fly
Freedom in the night
Let the eagle fly
Legends never die

Five, Four, Three, Two, One

This is New Yearâs Day â so rise from the ashes
Faith will find a way â like lightning crashes
Weâll keep marching on and on and on...
Itâs New Yearâs Day, so rise from the ashes
