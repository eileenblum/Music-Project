I am the innocent
I am what could have been
The dreams you talk about, now left on broken skin
Here lies hysteria, a land where chaos reigns
Global disturbia, bows down to twisted ways

A world of hate awaits
We are The Wild Ones
They all look the sameâ¦ our time has come

I am the chosen, Wretched and Divine
I am the unspoken, the one they left behind
Fearless, fight until we die
I am broken
The Wretched and Divine

I am the devilâs smile, the one caught everyday
A hopeful heroâs speech wonât stop the years you bleed
I am a hurricane, an army strong as one
As they sit back and laugh the one you left has just begun...

A world of hate awaits
We are The Wild Ones
They all look the sameâ¦ our time has come

I am the chosen, Wretched and Divine
I am the unspoken, the one they left behind
Fearless, fight until we die
I am broken
The Wretched and Divine
We live for the broken hearts, wonât watch them fall apart
We live for the ones who donât know they exist
We die for the endless winter, beginner and the sinner
We die for the ones who raise their hands to resist

I am the chosen, Wretched and Divine
I am the unspoken, the one they left behind
Fearless, fight until we die
I am broken
The Wretched and Divine
