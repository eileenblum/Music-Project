I ruled the world
With these hands I shook the heavens to the ground
I laid the gods to rest
I held the key to the kingdom lions guarding castle walls
Hail the king of death

Then I Lost it All
Dead and broken
My backs against the wall
Cut me open
Iâm just trying to breathe, just trying to figure it out
Because I built these walls to watch them crumbling down
I said then I Lost it All
And who can save me now?

I stood above
Another war, another jewel upon the crown
I was the fear of man
But I was blind, I couldnât see the world there right in front of me
But nowâ¦I can

Cause I Lost it All
Dead and broken
My backs against the wall
Cut me open
Iâm just trying to breathe, just trying to figure it out
Because I built these walls to watch them crumbling down
I said then I Lost it All
And who can save me now?

I believe that we all fall down sometimes
Canât you see that we all fall down sometimes?
I believe that we all fall down sometimes
