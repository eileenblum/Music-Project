This is to be our final transmission
The rebels have defeated our illustrious armies
They have damaged our intention of ugly an defiant malevolence
All that we love and care for will sink
Into the abyss, into a dark age
Made more sinister and perhaps more protractive
By the light of preverted science and rebellion
The whole root and heavy core
Will perish and starve in captivity
You will never win your freedom
You cannot escape...
F.E.A.R.
