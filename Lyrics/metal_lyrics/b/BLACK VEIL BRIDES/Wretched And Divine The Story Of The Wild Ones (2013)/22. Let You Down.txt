[Deluxe/Ultimate Edition Bonus Track]After the blood, After the tears have fallen down like rain
A loaded gun shot through the years and heaven was to blame
I'll take on all your shattered dreams
I'd give you almost anything
A chance to rise above the fog
I swear these words are true. I believe in you

I'll never let you down
I promise right here. Right now
I won't let you down
(Woah)
I'll never let you down
Our faith will silence the doubt
I won't let you down

(Woah)

The serpent's touch has made it clear that evils on it's way
This desert land of broken mirrors, we live another day
I'll become all your blasphemy. A war that's fought with tragedy
The scars we've left along these walls
I swear these words are true. I believe in you.

I'll never let you down
I promise right here. Right now
I wont let you down
(Woah)
I'll never let you down
Our faith will silence the doubt
I won't let you down

(Woah)

In the dead of night we'll rise of one for the fight
The sun ignites the spirit back to our lives
I won't ever let you down
I won't ever let you down
(I believe in you)

I'll never let you down
I promise right here. Right now
I wont let you down
(Woah)
I'll never let you down
Our faith will silence the doubt
I won't let you down

(Woah)

I won't let you down
