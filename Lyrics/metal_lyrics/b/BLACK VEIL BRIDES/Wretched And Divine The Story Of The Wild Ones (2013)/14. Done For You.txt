The best things in life come with a price
The star that burns so bright faded the fastest
Youâll always feel itâs right... even when we end the fight
Welcome home, home tonight

Singing oh oh welcome home tonight
Oh tonight

Words they donât know how to make amends
And all they do is push you to the edge
But itâs not wastedâ¦

Itâs all Done for You
All Done for you
All Done for you
