Before your life is over know this to be true
All the hate we hold inside still wonât save your youth
Donât waste your time on tragedy, easy to forget
Time thatâs lost enemies fought, arenât worth the price to live

One day at a time
One day at a time
Listen when weâre calling
Your time has arrived

Our Days are Numbered in a world of fools
We feel the hunger and follow no ones rules
Everybody wants eternal life
Nobody can seem to get it right
Our Days are Numbered and youâre no fools
Nobodyâs fool

Man worships the gospel that they preach to you
Living like a demon, a burden left to prove
You can live your life in heaven or create your hell
We will write our end result with every tale we tell

One day at a time
One day at a time
Listen when weâre calling
Your time has arrived

Our Days are Numbered in a world of fools
We feel the hunger and follow no ones rules
Everybody wants eternal life
Nobody can seem to get it right
Our Days are Numbered and youâre no fools
Nobodyâs fool

These steps we take to be fearless are yours
Life is yours
When deaths at stake youâll be fearless
Be sure
Life is yours

Our Days are Numbered in a world of fools
We feel the hunger and follow no ones rules
Everybody wants eternal life
Nobody can seem to get it right
Our Days are Numbered and youâre no fool
Nobodyâs fool
