Tear down the cross, splinters and shards remembered
This Trojan horse, rode to the land we enter
Weâll burn away and free our fallen brothers
From shackles made of steel and bones of soldiers

Let Shadows Die so I can feel alive
A church of lies canât tell me what is right
Our little victories and desires wonât live on
Let Shadows Die so I can feel alive
I Feel alive

In fear and faith, the candles light our freedom
By tainted night we live this war of wisdom
The streets are stained with blood that ran their kingdom
And feed the beast that lies beneath our treason

Let Shadows Die so I can feel alive
A church of lies canât tell me what is right
Our little victories and desires wonât live on
Let Shadows Die so I can feel alive
I Feel alive
