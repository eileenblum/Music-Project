Here in the echoes madness grows
The years of my sinning teach to show a heartless feeling of pain and regret
These wounds were opened like lines in the sand
The world is sleeping but they still have hope soâ¦

I pray for mourning, I swear Iâll never let you die
These saints within us can bring this moment back to life
And my hearts held high, with this battle cry Iâll march on
On the horizon we willâ¦
Resurrect the Sun

For the darkness has broken our homes
All that we wished for, like fools on a rope
I can feel it, the desperate control
A burning passion when love takes its toll
Yet souls have a reason and I wonât let go

I pray for mourning, I swear Iâll never let you die
These saints within us can bring this moment back to life
And my hearts held high, with this battle cry Iâll march on
On the horizon we willâ¦
Resurrect the Sun
