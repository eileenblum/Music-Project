[Deluxe/Ultimate Edition Bonus Track]Lonely among the dust and fog
Hungry for what the scriptures taught
Angry at all the love that's lost
Ready to heal our battle scars
A Holy War

This is one last Victory Call
Time waits for those who want it all
Watch their weapons fall!

Missing another life that's lost
Warning to all the paths we've crossed
Freeing ourselves from what they sold us
Starting to know the world we fought
A Holy War

This is one last Victory Call
Time waits for those who want it all
Watch their weapons fall!

This is one last Victory Call
Time waits for those who want it all
Watch their weapons fall!

This is one last Victory Call
Time waits for those who want it all
Watch their weapons fall!

This is one last Victory Call
Time waits for those who want it all
Watch their weapons fall!
