The gates of heaven were locked shut, the pits of hellâ¦ they were all filled up and I fear
I donât belong here
They might call me a âsinnerâ, a walking flame from a fire that burns
Disappear
You donât belong here

The church of F.E.A.R., the church of failure, the church of fools
So call me a nothing, call me a something
Treat me cruel
We Donât Belong here
We Donât Belong
We Donât Belong here
Itâs the anthem of the underground, so get back up when they push you down
Weâre singing
We Donât Belong here
We Donât Belong

Can you hear the march of the rejects?
Line up the parade of the defects
Can I hear We Donât Belong here?
So rise from the darkness, eyes of the dismissedâ¦ hearts of the used
Show me your worst, show me youâre cursed
Tell me the truth

We Donât Belong here
We Donât Belong
We Donât Belong here
Itâs the anthem of the underground, so get back up when they push you down
Weâre singing
We Donât Belong here
We Donât Belong
