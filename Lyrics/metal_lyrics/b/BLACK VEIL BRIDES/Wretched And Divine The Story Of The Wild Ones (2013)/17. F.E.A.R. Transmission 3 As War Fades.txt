We are not interested in the possibility of defeat
Not within the silence of a deserted ally, nor the clamor of a crowded street
F.E.A.R. cannot be vanquished, we cannot be destroyed
F.E.A.R. will rise up again and control the masses
Take back the power and crush the insurgent horde
As war fades into the distant memories of enlightened pigs and open wounds
The Rebels will begin to perish - one by one, it should
Feel the fear of dying young
Not ignore the chance to scream
Lie awake at night in terror, admitting F.E.A.R. will return to glory
And the story of Rebels who set out to conquer will finish in blood
