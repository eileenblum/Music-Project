In the End as you fade into the night
Who will tell the story of your life?

In the End as my souls laid to rest what is left of my body?
Or am I just a shell?
I have fought and with flesh and blood I commanded an army
Through it all I have given my heart for a moment of glory
I gave it all

In the End as you fade into the night
Who will tell the story of your life?
And who will remember your last goodbye?
âCause itâs the end and Iâm not afraid
Iâm not afraid to die

Born a saint but with every sin I still want to be holy
I will live again
Who we are isnât how we live we are more than our bodies
If I fall I will rise back up and relive my glory

In the End as you fade into the night
Who will tell the story of your life?
And who will remember your last goodbye?
âCause itâs the end and Iâm not afraid
Iâm not afraid to die
Who will remember this last goodbye?
âCause itâs the end and Iâm not afraid
Iâm not afraid to die
