Standin' alone in the soot and stone,
He draws from this holster, a man.
Crawlin' alone
Through the soot and stone,
He makes his way home half to death.

In time.
In vain.
I wash my hands of yesterday.
If I should fall,
If I should pass,
It's worth one last stand before the gates
Before the gates of Hell.

Crawlin' alone
Through the soot and stone,
He makes his way home half to death.
Standin' alone
In soot and stone,
He draws from this holster...

Yeah...

When sun sets dusk and streets are cleared,
This town's renegade is near.
I'm standing tall, awaiting host,
What's it like to see a ghost?
Both outlaws equal, yes indeed,
A one shot rhythm to the gunsling
So long my sweet.
Bye bye.

Standin' alone in the soot and stone,
He draws from this holster, a man.
Crawlin' alone through the soot and stone,
He makes his way home half to death.

He clenched his fist and said a prayer,
For every breath of dusty air.
He fires loud, the end is close,
What's it like to be a ghost?
Both outlaws equal, yes indeed,
A one shot rhythm to the gunsling,
So long my sweet.

I hear those voices calling...
"Take my life"
I cannot take this lying down...
No!

Standin' alone through the soot and stone,
He draws from this holster, a man.
Crawlin' alone through the soot and stone,
He makes his way home half to death.

In time.
In vain.
I wash my hands of yesterday.
If I should fall,
If I should pass,
It's worth one last stand before the gates of Hell!
Before the gates of Hell!
Before the gates of Hell!

I hear those voices calling...
"Take my life"
I cannot take this lying down...
No!

Standin' alone through the soot and stone,
He draws from this holster, a man.
Crawlin' alone through the soot and stone,
He makes his way home half to death.

In time.
In vain.
I wash my hands of yesterday.
If I should fall,
If I should pass,
It's worth one last stand before the gates of Hell!
