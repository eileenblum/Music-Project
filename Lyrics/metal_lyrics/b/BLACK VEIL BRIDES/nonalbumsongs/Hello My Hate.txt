I don't wanna be!

Hello my love, well good riddance and farewell to you.
This marks the day we met on your terms.
Hello my hate, well this marks the day I killed you.
So cuddle, make your bed, we broke the ice...your only dead and..

I don't wanna be!
Another dead-weight victim of love tragedy and
I don't wanna be!
Another "look like James Dean" punk trippin' sanity and
Another straight edge poser preachin'
Lets be smoke free!
Cause all I wanna be!
Is another "who cares" "shot dead" kid, I'm going down, down, down!

I am your hate, you are my love, I am your lust, you are my lovedrug.....
the one that cures me.
Hello my hate, well this marks the day I killed you.
So rest in peace, you made your bed...quit haunting me your only dead!
I don't wanna be!
Another dead-weight victim of love tragedy and
I don't wanna be!
Another "look like James Dean" punk trippin' sanity and
Another straight edge poser preachin'
Lets be smoke free!
Cause all I wanna be!
Is another "who cares" "shot dead" kid, I'm goin down, down, down!
