Well lets pack our bags and head west
Where the cities only breed evil, yes,
The entertainment news becomes approach
But sex, drugs, and ballads wake a dog
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Well just try to make me glimmer anti sin
And see if I survive tomorrow
Cause I am the nightmare, not what it says
All feels how you've chosen, and we'll live the dread
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
Sex and Hollywood, Sex and Hollywood
(Woo Woo Woo)
