[2012 "Avengers" Movie Soundtrack]Now you're drifting to the sea of lies
A foolish villain hidden in their shelter
The demons are running behind your eyes
A simple shadow we can fight together

I'll never walk away

Tear down
The walls that will surround
Cry out
Above the burning sound
Show me
How bleeding hearts can pound
If we stand together we will be unbroken

We carry forward into the night
The strength of innocence like children's laughter
An army standing for what is right
We'll fall like angels if we lose what matters

I will not walk away

Tear down
The walls that will surround
Cry out
Above the burning sound
Show me
How bleeding hearts can pound
If we stand together we will be unbroken


We will not walk away

Tear down
The walls that will surround
Cry out
Above the burning sound
Show me
How bleeding hearts still pound
If we stand together we will be unbroken

Tear down
The walls that will surround
Cry out
Above the burning sound
Show me
How bleeding hearts still pound
If we stand together we will be unbroken
