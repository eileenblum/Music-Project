Well now is the time to say your prayers,
And now is the time to show your stuff
Cause' people talk but people separate,
it's the same damn excuse when danger is headed your way

You talk the talk but do you walk the walk?
Your apathy is just a living flaw, you pull the trigger
count 1,2,3 it's a finger flip for you...and a devil for me

A wedding of the damned
This razor cuts the pain right out, we're bound until the end
My Love

You acted first you could have walked away,
With broken parts and things you can't replace.
You pull the trigger
count 1,2,3 its an "anti christ" for you...fallen angel for me

[x2] A wedding of the damned
This razor cuts the pain right out, we're bound until the end
My Love
