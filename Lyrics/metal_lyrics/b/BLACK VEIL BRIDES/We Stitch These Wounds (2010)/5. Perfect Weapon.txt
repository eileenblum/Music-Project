GO!
Awake at night you focus,
On everyone whose hurt you,
And write a list of targets,
Your violent lack of virtue.
Leave us alone!
You're on your own!
Go!
We are breathing,
While you're sleeping, go, (GO! )
And leave us alone,
The lines cheated,
Our hearts beating, go, (GO! )
And now you're on your own.
Here's to your perfect weapon,
Crack bones with blind aggression,
Like birds whose wings are broken,
You live without direction.
Leave us alone!
You're on your own!
We are breathing,
While your sleeping, go, (GO! )
And leave us alone,
The lines cheated,
Our heart's beating, go, (GO! )
And now you're on your own.
GO!
GO!
GO!
GO!
And now you're on your own!
GO!
GO!
And leave us alone!
We are breathing,
While your sleeping, go, (GO! )
And leave us alone,
The lines cheated,
Our heart's beating, go, (GO! )
And now you're on your own.
