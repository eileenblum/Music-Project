I open my lungs dear
I sing this song at funerals...no rush.
These lyrics heard a thousand times, just plush.
A baby boy you've held so tightly,
This pain it visits almost nightly
Missing hotel beds, I feel your touch.

I will wait dear, a patient of eternity, my crush
A universe so still.
No rust.
No dust will ever grow on this frame,
One million years, I will say your name.
I love you more than I can ever scream.

We booked our flight those years ago,
I said I love you as I left you.
Regrets still haunt my hollow head,
But I promised you I will see you again, again.

I sit here and smile dear
I smile because I think of you and I blush.
These bleeding hollow dials...this fuss.
A fuss is made of miles and travels
When roadways are but stones and gravel.
A bleeding heart can conquer every crutch.

We booked our flight those years ago
you said you loved me as you left me.
Regrets still haunt your saddened head
But I promised you I will see you,

We booked our flight those years ago
I said I loved you as I left you
Regrets no longer in my head,
But I promised you and now I'm home again, again, again, again, again, again.

I'm home again.
