I am the heartache, you built by your deception
A blind leap of faith, despair for passing seasons

Sink in Anger, fountains forming
Spills like thunder to what we're holding
Sleep forever now my darling
I won't dwell on Heaven's Calling

Drive into the stake, secrets of his "compassion"
A perfect escape, like hell you'll list your reasons

Sink in Anger, fountains forming
Spills like thunder to what we're holding
Sleep forever now my darling
I won't dwell on Heaven's Calling

Sink in Anger, fountains forming
Spills like thunder to what we're holding
Sleep forever now my darling
I won't dwell on Heaven's Calling
