We're born into the night like children of the damned
Our pain will shine a light to those who understand

Whoa whoa sink your teeth into forever
Whoa whoa sunlight burns Children Surrender

An exorcise of life to cut beneath our hands
Like souls who missed their plight, we'll bleed along the sand

Whoa whoa sink your teeth into forever
Whoa whoa sunlight burns Children Surrender

Sink your teeth into forever

Whoa whoa sink your teeth into forever
Whoa whoa sunlight burns Children Surrender
