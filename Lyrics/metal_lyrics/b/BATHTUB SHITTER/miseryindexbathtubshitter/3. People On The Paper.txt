We are on the history, but sill making long story
Is it beyond our memory? What happened at rudimentary shit
The continent, peninsula and island country
What are we hating? Is it for money? What's the reason that we won't be one?
Did you say this sea called toilet divides us?

People on the pear

Some nature were killed
Forest was destroyed for wiping our tears and blood
Are we wrong to use this paper?
The east Asian People get the paper
We didn't we wipe each other's ass?
Pooh P.O.P Pooh P.O.P. People on the Paper

Do you say We mush look back our shits
On this paper that you invende?
But we think it went back to the earth
We stand there, and make our new shits

Shit on this sea
As for Asian ass which will make for one
Asian People
Reshit to shit now
Are we a shit of history?
Eat it each other, mix it all
Asu of people

Do we want to tear this paper?
But there is old shits sticking on our minds
Odorless and shapeless old shits
What do we discuss?
Is important to open this door for next shits?
