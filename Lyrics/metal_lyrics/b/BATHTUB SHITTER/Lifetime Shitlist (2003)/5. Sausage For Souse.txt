Countless Tributaries Of A River
Where Is It Going ?
I Drink And Thinking About It
But Really Need Snack
And My Blood Vessel Wants Beer
Why Am I Drinking ?
Repeat It And Thinking Again
And Really Need A Snack

Parched Ground Wants Rain
My Body Needs Alot Of Beer In Summer

What Is Temperance ?
What Is Riotous ?
What Is Good Behavior Of Beer ?

And Autumn Comes To Call The Harvest Season
I'll Know
My Blood Vessel Is Going To The Intestines
To Make Sausage

Drink And Eat
Sausage For Souse
In Toilet
Drink In Congratulation Every Morning

Sober Lifes Will Stop My Bowels
Sottish Vision Will Make Nice Dish
