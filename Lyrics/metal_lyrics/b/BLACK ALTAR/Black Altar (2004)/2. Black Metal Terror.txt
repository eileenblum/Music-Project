Death, death to traitors!
Die you bastards!

Nothing will save you now
The day of the rope is near
There are more and more of us
warriors of the night
In the depth of the dark, we await the command

The demons of war embracing us with their wings
Will lead our army to the victory

Black Metal Terror will soon begin
Gathering the legions of destruction
Black Metal Terror will soon begin
We are the warriors of extermination

When the time of revenge comes
we will stand up to fight
To destroy your filthy morality
When the time of revenge comes
we will reveal our might
Satanic terror will take its toll

The fire of revenge has burnt too long
in our hearts
Soon our wrath shall reach you all
Thrusting at your worm-eaten hearts
with our blades

Be prepared to death!

There are more and more of us
warriors of the night
In the depth of the dark, we await the command
The demons of war embracing us with their wings
Will lead our army to the victory

Black Metal Terror will soon begin
Gathering the legions of annihilation
Black Metal Terror will soon begin
We are the warriors of lord Satan
