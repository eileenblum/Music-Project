Is that the great one who will be the awaited redeemer?
Or just another shining beauty in the eyes of the weak?
The cross and the dead star are the same now, symbiosis of sickness
(there will be no bastard to just take your hand and take you out of hell)

Good can't exist without its opposition
So show me what is your belief!
Who is the savior and who is the slave and the lamb?
What would you do, I ask 
Will you be a slaughter or would you rather be slain?

Your own blood in the chalice
The past cannot be written twice...
Open your dead eyes, and see... (if you can)
I am the hunting wolf
And there's no fucking (so called) memento on all of your kind
No one can accuse you!
Your will is the only law!
The law of mind and steel, (but) who remember it yet....

Degeneration of the self
The fall of pure thought
(this is the transcendental filth  
of life you can't even feel...)
The dirty mind cannot be clean at once

There's no peace without war
So pray your idols and drink the wine of delusions...
Forever turning your back, in pity (slave)
or let yourself drink from the chalice of sin
this is the true perfection in simplicity
