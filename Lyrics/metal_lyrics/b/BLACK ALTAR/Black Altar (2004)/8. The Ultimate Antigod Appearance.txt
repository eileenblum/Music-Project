Here and now...
We start the era of destruction (deconstruction) [?]
As we killed the god by our thought
As we pray for the scorched ground
As the flames wipe all shame

The last drop of blood redeems the humanity

Nothing to mourn for 
Pathetic graveyard
Cursed by my hatred
Determine(s) the new horizon
Cruelty, grief and pain

Nothing but true existence!!!

This is the time for resurrection of the Beast
They must bow to the monster
That is created by them...

This is the dawn of all beliefs
As we demand to crush all symbols of pity

As we burn your heavens
With the eternal fire...
As we burn your heavens
With the eternal fire of our darkest desire
