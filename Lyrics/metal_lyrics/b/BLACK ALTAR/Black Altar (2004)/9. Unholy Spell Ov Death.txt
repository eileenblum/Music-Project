Frozen stars fall into the abyss
The moon illuminates the vanity with ghastly glare
Standing on the hilltop I summon the forgotten powers
The words that haven't been uttered for ages
Will sound one more time, carried on the night's wings

I cast the spell of the dark and death
The ancient, unholy art is used one more
When the scythe of time marks the circles of death
The gates will open again

The cosmic thread of fate entwines the empirical world
Joining it with another dimension
The witchcraft of the dark and death circles my victims
Like a pestilential cloud

Their life approaches its end, fades away
When the stars reach the one-row pattern
The will pass away, lost in non-existence

I cast the spell of the dark and death
The ancient, unholy art is used once more

Destruction and death, mists of madness
The echo of the past blasphemous act

I cast the spell of the dark and death
The ancient, unholy art is used once more

A lethal chant of horror
Freezing my veins and mind
My soil proceeds towards the unknown
Masters the inscrutable dimensions
My soul leads death
