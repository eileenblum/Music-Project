The cry of the stone idols
Tears the old wounds open
Long forgotten laws
Reverbate with pounding of my heart

Living in me is the pain
Of misplacement and grief
Of having nothing real to gain
Civilization is the thief

Persistence
Guarding my identity
I've laid the cornerstone
Of misanthropic supremacy!

Sick of omnipresent verbal seizure
Meaningless backdrop existence
I withdraw and step aside
Grinding, sheedding, annihilating

Clenching my fists I give out a cry
Of suppressed hatred and prisoned mind
What you worship I call a lie
Blindness and idioncy of all mankind

Perseverance
Stronger than ever
Led by the principles
Of misanthropic supremacy!
