The dawn of our predestination
Emerged from the blood of our ancestors
The day of its glory and our birth
Begotten by the history's revenge
We shall fight for our invaluable laws
As the only heirs of this Land

In the name of blood!!!
In the name of purest blood!!!
We doom you all to death!!!

Offered up by ourselves
On the Black Altar of truth
We dedicate our own blood
As the greatest tribute
We shall baptise this world with pure blood

The path of glory leads
Through blood, tears and pain
Set p as a trial of loyalty for all of us
The bloody path into the flames of glory
We shall follow!

Carried on the eagle's wings
The doom of our existence
Uplifts us to the higher levels
Of human desires and ideals
All resurrected in our deeds and determination

Dying out in the abyss of our blood
They will learn its mighty anger

In the name of blood!!!
In the name of purest blood!!!
We doom you all to death!!!
