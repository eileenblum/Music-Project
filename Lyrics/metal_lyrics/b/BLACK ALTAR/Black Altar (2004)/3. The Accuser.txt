Behold your face in the visage of the dying opposition
Behold, thou slave of free thought
See the wrath in the eyes observe you
The last strike from the grave
The traumatic view of the whirling space
It may be, but that feeling you've already known

From the maelstrom of destructious dance I arise
Like an angel of a new incoming era
Once started the natural cycle has been done
And now, what is able to persist in eternity?

I piss on the cross of every faiths and every laws
Perishing this moral world appears unchanged
Behold this grotesque-cambered flesh of ravished truth at my feet
Do you walk with me or your footing has been disappeared and you can't stand?
