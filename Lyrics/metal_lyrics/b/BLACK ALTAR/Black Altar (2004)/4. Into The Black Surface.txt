Creature of two faces
Pacing through the gardens of the infested Eden
The pigeon of the serpent's shadow
The curious state of the emotional weakness

His fucking heart became raging
One-day triumphator became filthy
renegade of his own beliefs...

Overjoyed by watching destruction and pain
Encouraging one but never in action
He always stands under the right banner
(first:) coldeyed fearful daemon
that waiting death of 
(later:) pity and mercyful filthiness
on the cross

Flickering symbols on the walls
of his chapel became clearer
And then he begins to understand
his position in that endless loop...
His fucking heart became raging
One-day triumphator became wooden crying
statue that can't do anything...

Before light ineluctably fades and brings death 
and nothingness
He still believe... (but)
Did he ever know what real darkness is?
He asks the last question:
Is he able to accept defeat in the last battle
of his grotesque destiny?
