I've descended into the chamber of primal time...

I'm watching the tangle of naked bodies
I'm admiring licentious shapes and forms
Shivering in the exalted dance of self-engrossment

The dancing shadows born
Of their white bodies
Sculpture the subsequent projections
Of my own thoughts

I'm coming closer...

The bodies are surrounding me
Touching me with their common need
Their licking flames are burning me
Like a convict being hurt at the stake

Amid the cross-dance of fire and blood
We're merging into a unity
Of thought, form and shape
Within which time is measured
By blood, annealed in fire!!!

Incarnations carried by the black centuries
Onto the altar of truth
As the end and the beginning
Of the ever-reviving immortality!!!

I'm naked...

Woven with an invisible thread
To what has been and what will be
United with pure and noble blood
I fall down or I'm raised up again
I'm omniscient and omnipresent
I merge into the unity
I reach within the heart of hearts
Of the common human nature
I can see all and everyone!!!

All that haven't been dishonored
by the teaching of the cross...
All that tramples the star of jahwe...
All those who know...
All those who are alive...
