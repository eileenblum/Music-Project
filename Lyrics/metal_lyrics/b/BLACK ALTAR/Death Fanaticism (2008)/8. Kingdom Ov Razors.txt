In the labyrinth of decay
My body, drowned years ago in cold abyss
My soul is crying with astral pain
Ohh, my abyss come and kill me
Of my desires come and feed my lust
Lust of cold feeling of nothing
I opened the gates of filth
Reality is forever my grave
My consciousness is burning with failed ideas
I want to forget any symbol of life
I want to forget any symbol of human kind
I am thorn in the eye of god
I am poison on their tongues
I am fear of their material dream
Death is my future
Without reality and past
I build my kingdom of razors
I build my own grave of cold touches
Taste my blood and drink my suffering
I want to end my life without any symbol of birth
