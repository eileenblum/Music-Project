When the flame tears up the throat of the earth
The dead raise their hands in the prayer of scream
When the razor blade cuts the white boy
The seas of blood start their symphonies
When the last stat falls
Era of the nameless void will come
When the last human being turns to ashes
Harbinger of the god of nothingness will arise on the gory sky
When the last dead child cries with a gory tear
The bastard's kingdom will fall
When millions of tears run to the kingdom of pain
Scream of the glory will arise above the piles of corpses
When flash of the nuclear triumph arises above the grey heavens
I shall kneel down praising the power of pain
When the last of saints decays on the wooden pole
Thousands of angels from the forgotten nothingness
Will stretch their arms towards the abyss
When the last of the holy books burns on the pile made of black bones
The human's body will become the cloth of history of the eternal pain
Let's praise the pain
Let's praise the tragedies
Let's praise all of what sheds blood of millions
Let's praise all that what tears the soil in the perennial fire
Let's praise the extermination
Let's praise the nothingness, because there is meaning of death
Restoration, decay, void
