Ancient dimensions of pure evil, ascend into mankind's dominion
Technology is not a salvation, reliigion is our damnation

Nightmares will come alive
Fear will bring doom, hope will abandon the living
Death will reign, the dark is coming

Pain grows inside my head, explodes with thousands of razors
Each scream tears my body apart, images of the end of days
Flash before my eyes
It is near
It is now
The dark has come! Mankind's doomed!
