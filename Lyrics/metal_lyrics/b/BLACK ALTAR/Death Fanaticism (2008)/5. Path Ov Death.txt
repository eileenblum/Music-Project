I abandon my flesh
I leave my deeds behind
My consciousness enters another dimension
Funeral songs echo around
I walk proudly onto the path ov death
No return
I step into immortality

I transcend dimensions of time and space
Astral world reveals its secrets
Everything becomes a logical whole
I walk towards my dark destiny
Forever my blessing and curse

Path ov Death - The way to immortality
Path ov Death - The way to victory

My senses are becoming sharper
I discover a new reality
I travel through places and dimensions beyond reach for mortals
No boundaries exist anymore
My soul is a mirror of the universe
The land of death lies in front of me
Darkness welcomes me to its kingdom
I belong with the shadows!
