Overwhelming pain runs through my veins
Death lurks at the threshold of being, creating false images of heaven
Maggots transform the flesh into blasphemous entities

The burden of life shall never concquer death
Morphing into nothingness, reaking beasts of heresy
A bow to the dark

Never ending suffering lures the demons of madness
Lures the conquerors, let them feast upon my flesh
Decomposition of life, creation of death
Live and be forever dead
