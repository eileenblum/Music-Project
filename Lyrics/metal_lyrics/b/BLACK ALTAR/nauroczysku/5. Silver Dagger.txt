from another dimension, from the mist of the past
where echoes of history are covered by the fog of mistery
from the darkness of eternity it travelled a long way
going through the immeasurable abyss of time
the silver dagger forged from cosmic metals
in the depths of hell called to being
by the blasphemous invocation, by the ancient demons
the name of which was forgotten
the ancient talisman changing the race of history
it has accompanied humanity since the moment of its creation
to destroy it
when the time is right
the greatest of this world, being its owners
with its help made away with themselves
it was the witness of bloody rituals
and mysteries forever carried to hell
from another dimension...
the silver dagger...
reborned from nonentity
vibrant with the aura of evil, being in pain
paissing the succesive stages of initiation
ominous talisman gives the power to its owner
now i have it!
the lair of demons in the silver dagger
bringing extermination to everyone who is against
the mission must be accomplished
so that the diabolical plan could be finished
the silver dagger...
