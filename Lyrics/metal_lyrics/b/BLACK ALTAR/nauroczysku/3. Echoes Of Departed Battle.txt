From the ancient slavonic tradition
I derive my power and inspiration.
Walking through slavonic forests
I commune with dark scarps
Of memories of Sventevith's cult
The fire of knowledge is burning in my eyes
Sounds of the departed battle
Are echoing all around
I transfer myself to the ancient times that are
Praised in forgotten legends
To be there one more time...
Clash of arms, groan of dying people
(Fertilizating the ground with their blood)
They all are the music enchanted amidst the trees
Slavonic warriors drunk with need to kill
Repelling the attack of invaders from the west
Cold steel is being plunged in their bodies
Letting out the blood imprisoned
Piles of corpses lying all around
Are the witnesses of polans' victory
Their impaled heads shall be
The foundation of Perun's temple
Wolfs' howl is mourning over the dead slavs
Tearing the bodies of the dying enemies
All The enemies ahall be destroyed
Whenever they appear!
Let the fire dance like in the old times!
