the astral world, the second side
is awaiting us after death
the wandering of souls in grim lands
serching for relief in pain
in the land of darkness, in the land of evil
they continue in everlasting nightmare
searching for humanity, they find nothing
that would link them with previous life
evil circle draws its ring
seizing the preys of destiny
the envoys of death, dancing madly
are reaping the harvest
among their follovers
ther's no way back, the decree is made
on the bloody pages of history
the ancient spells are reviving
the demons of human fear
the astral world, the second side
is awaiting us after death
