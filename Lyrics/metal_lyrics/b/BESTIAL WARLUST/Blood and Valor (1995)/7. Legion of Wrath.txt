[Lyrics by: Bloodstorm]

Blood For Blood, Kill For Kill
Wrath The Way of Force
Path Of Destiny, Fearless Guest
Power Reigns Forevermore
Wrath Is Fire, Damnation Pride
Flames Enlight The Eyes
Invoke Fury, Burning Storm
Blackened Skies Now Roar

Power of Death, Strength From Hell
Destructions First Spell
Rebel Force, Mark To Kill
Defenders of The Will
Clashing Steel, Raging War
The Battle Is The Law
Blend of Might, Sinful Greed
All Lifes Blood Will Bleed

Fighting We'll, Kill With Ease
We Crush And Defeat
Pride of War, Flag Raised High
Storming Armies Never Die
Riding Torment, Bringing Pain
Annihilate We Command

Breeding Hate, Cast Iron Will
We Are Living For The Kill

All The Weak, Shall Fall
Legions of Wrath Will Rise
