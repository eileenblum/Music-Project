[Lyrics by: Bloodstorm]

We Set Forward
Time Shall Tell
What We'll Find
Endless Crusade
Into The Unknown
Places Beyond

Striving Through The Distant Land
Through Storms of Fire
In Search of A Battle Unforgotten
The One We Desire
Lost Is The Force of Will
Our Pride Still Defies
We Shall Forge on Relentless
Through Depths Unknown

To Foresee And Voyage Through
The Eyes of Death
Our Vengeance Shall Pave The Way
We Shall Ride On Till The End

Eye For An Eye
We Conquer
Our Victory
Shall Avenge

Striving Through The Distant Land
Through Storms of Fire
In Search of A Battle Unforgotten
The One We Desire
Lost Is The Force of Will
Our Pride Still Defies
We Shall Forge on Relentless
Even Till The End of Time
