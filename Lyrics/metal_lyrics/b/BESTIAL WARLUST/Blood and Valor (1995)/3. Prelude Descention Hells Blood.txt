[Lyrics by: Skullfucker]

Break Through The Shell of Man
Unveil The Trinity of Soul
Compel Beyond The Dismal Light
Grasp Darkness Inhumane
Dispelling All That Is Clean
All In Homage To The Goat
How Will It Take To See
The Demise of All Humanity

Heaven Shall Weep And Burn,
It's Hell on Earth

HAIL! The Mighty And The Proud
Victors of The Earth
Evil unto creed HAIL!
Immoral Is Our Way
A Never Ending Path
To Infinity HAIL!
Purveyors Who Summon Might
Rulers of The Night
We Gloat HAIL!
Burn The Godly And The Weak
Hterzan Shall Bleed
We Laugh Aloud CUNT !!!

[Repeat]
