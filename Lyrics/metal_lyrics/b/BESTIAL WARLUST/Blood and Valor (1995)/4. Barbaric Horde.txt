[Lyrics by: Skullfucker]

Battle on The Rise
Rivals Doom Awaits
The Stormbringers Moon
Warclouds And Thunder Awake!

We Come At Night
Barbaric Horde
Evil Vicious Plight
Charge Forth

Fiery Torches Ablaze
Follow The Setting Sun
Heralds of A Dawn To Come
The Land Yet To Be Won

Steel Clashes Steel
First Blood Drawn
Mortals Crushed Underhoof
Swordarm Judges Might

Unchained Attack Behold
Overthrow Shall Unfold
All Fighting For One
And One Fighting For All

Darkened Skies Above
They Beckon In The Wind
Ash scatters In Stars
The Flames Grow Higher

We're Here To Reap
Holy Waters Poison
Lords of Battle
Forge Forth Now

Many Have Fought And Sought
Raging Through Wars Blood
We Rouges The Victors
Kings Head Carried Home

Dark Ages Repisal
Mercenaries of Wills Pride
Conquer Through Hills of Death
Hells Fuckin' Militia

Rain Thrashes The Earth
Smoke Fills The Air
The War Is Over
We Won Again
