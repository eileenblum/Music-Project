[Lyrics by: Skullfucker &amp; Bloodstorm]

Out For War, Death I Implore
Out For Kill, The Blood Will Spill
Out For Sin, This Fight I'll Win
Out For Hell, Eternity I Will Dwell

Relentless, We'll Hunt You Down
Chaos, Destroying All Grounds
Bloodshed, To The Fuckin Core
Dominate, Our Victory Unfolds

BLOOD AND VALOR
BLOOD AND VALOR

Unstoppable, We'll Crush Your Vows
Invincible, We're The Gods Now
Bludgeoned, Fools Lie Dead
Hell Awakened, Your Funeral Now Calls

For As Long As The Wind Blows
It Will Howl My Hate
Fists Full of Blood
Painful Death Your Fucking Fate

Hellborn, Delivering My Wrath
My Love Is Lust, But My Pleasure Is Death
Until My Hands, Drip Your Blood
I Shall Kill, And Kill Forevermore

BLOOD AND VALOR
BLOOD AND FUCKING VALOR ! ! !
