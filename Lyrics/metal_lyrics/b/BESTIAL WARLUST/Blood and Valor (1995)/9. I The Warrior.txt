[Lyrics by: Skullfucker]

My World, I Don't Give A Fuck What You Think
I'm Livin' For Today
I'm A Warrior I'll Do Each And Everything
My Own Fucking Way!
Unrelenting, I'll Force my Sword
Through Your Shrines of White
Spirit of Hate, The Devil In Disguise
I The Demon of The Night!

I'll Climb The Highest of Mountains
And Journey Beyond The Sun
I'll Cast My Will Content
I The Mighty One
Set Foot On Virginal Land
Grasping All By My Own Hand

Oh, Mighty One Is Thy
The Primal Soul And Elite
Empowered Beyond The Worthless Flock
No Mortal Shall Defeat

Embodied By All That Is Sacred
of Will And Lifely Treasures
It Will Be Thine Now
And In The End To Reap All Lifes Pleasures

Bestial Fuckin' Warlust Is:
Skullfucker: Lead Guitar &amp; Voice
Hellcunt: Drums
BloodStorm: Voice
Battleslaughter: Rhythm Guitar
Fiend of The Deep: Session Bass
