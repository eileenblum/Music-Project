[Lyrics by: Skullfucker]

Tonight Is The Night
The Night of Ghoul
I'm Ready To Fight
This Land I Rule

Avenging, Killing, Destroying, Charging

I Am The Warrior
I Hold The Law
I Am The Redeemer
Manic Fuckin' Hate

When I Look Into Your Eyes I See Death!
When I Taste Your Blood I Want More!
When My Fists Drip Red You'll See Me In Another World!
When I Take Your Last Breath I'll Laugh With Death!

[Repeat pre-Chorus]

Death Rides With Me Tonight
Enflamed With Fury
Victim In My Sight
I'll Fuck Him With My Knife

[Repeat pre-chorus]
[Repeat Chorus]
