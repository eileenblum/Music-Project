Lust, sweat, filth, Disgust
Die, cry, screaming pain
Want, take, have, receive
Fuck the lamb of God

Fuck the lamb of God!!!

I do the fuck I want when I want
Im not looking for peace, trying to start a war
I get my pleasure from sex and drugs
When I make a kill I don't give a fuck!

Fuck the lamb of God!!!

Lets die burning some pigs
And bring the world to the end
Im waiting for the last sun down
I long to see it burn
To burn everything down

Lord of darkness laughs aloud
As tens of thousands fall to die
Unnatural at dark and the light

Lust, sweat, filth, disgust
Die, cry, screaming pain
Excruciation, fullfilment need
Want, take, have, receive
Fuck the lamb of God
A perishment in utter ecstasy

He manipulated the earth
A peasant who had
Devoured the wrong shroom
And spoke of his pitiful mind fantasy

Im waiting for end of world
Im waiting for the last sun down
I long to see it burn
To burn everything fucking down!!!
