New age of misery
Live life to death's decree
Shadows fall
Hypocritical oath
The global threshold chokes
Is there hope at all?

This world - untold chaos and sadness
We're forced - comply or die, feeding their greed
We fall so small
Trivial is this living at all?
Visions of abyss
Life forever shadowed

Forlorn world
We are alone, existing as one
Born to the Earth, consumed by the Sun
Irreversible existence
Back to the Earth, we continue to take
Ravage our planet, our final mistake

I stand alone
Death accepted, free is my soul
Surrounded by depression
A pill for immortality?

Wait for death

The world - foretold death and destruction
We're forced by these laws, to wait for death
We fall so small
Trivial, is this living at all?
Visions of abyss
Life forever shadowed

Forlorn world
We are alone, existing as one
Born to the Earth, consumed by the Sun
Irreversible existence
Back to the Earth, we continue to take
Ravage our planet, our final mistake

I stand alone
Death accepted, free is my soul
Surrounded by depression
A pill for immortality?
