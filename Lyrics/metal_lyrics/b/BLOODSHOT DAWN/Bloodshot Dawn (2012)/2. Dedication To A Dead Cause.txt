Under the strain the cracks start to show
Still can't tell when it falls, which was it will go
How can an empire, for aeons stand
With it's foundations built upon the sand?

A thousand questions, but never an answer
After a lifetime spent, I can't tell what's been gained
Where am I going? What am I fighting for?...
...Still this undying dedication to a dead cause

The lasting shreds of belief barely hold me together
As I stand on the edge staring out at the dark of forever
No way to tell which way is wrong or right
I'm blind in the darkness, and I'm blind in the light

A victim of my own uncertainty
Bound by parameters of my morality
Am I knowingly leading myself where no one can follow?
Deeper into this hole, there's no way out

A thousand questions, but never an answer
After a lifetime spent, I can't tell what's been gained
Where am I going? What am I fighting for?...
...Still this undying dedication to a dead cause
