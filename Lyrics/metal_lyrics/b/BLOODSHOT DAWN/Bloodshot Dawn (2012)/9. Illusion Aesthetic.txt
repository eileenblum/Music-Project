The wretched hollow, a void within
Disintegration of identity begins
Driven by the need to be complete
You fabricate an inaccurate reality

Compulsion to deceive yourself
Distorts your view of the world and all else
Incessant self obsession: ego infatuation
What will you gain, deluding yourself?

What you see is not real
You cannot be coerced to feel
Reject the thoughts flooding the senses
You're lost to this illusion aesthetic

Lost in illusion...

Problems ignored through misdirection
A conscious diversion of attention
Distractions pulling focus from the way you've condoned your own slavery

[Solo: McMorran]

What you see is not real
You cannot be coerced to feel
Reject the thoughts flooding the sense
To be free from this illusion aesthetic

Lost in illusion...

[Lead: Ellis]

[Solo: Ellis]

Now is the time to recreate
And abandon this idea of fate
Conceptualise and begin rebirth
To rediscover a sense of self worth

What you see is not real
You cannot be coerced to feel
Reject the thoughts flooding the sense
To be free from this illusion aesthetic

Free from illusion

Free from illusion
