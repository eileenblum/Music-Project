As we march, following the line that cannot fade with time - our spiritual bearing
Despite differences in minds, with this truth, we find friend and enemy are one

Now cast out fears of the past
To move forward from what was then, to what will be
Fortune comes from conscious choice
Who we are is not written in our blood

Destiny waits
We choose our own path
Yet share the same end
This beckoning oblivion

Are we born into a shallow life, just standing defiant, devoid of meaning?
Or are we set to always continue, beyond physical form?

Destiny waits
We choose our own path
Yet share the same end
This beckoning oblivion

Now move forward from what was then, to what will be
Fortune comes from conscious choice
Who we are is not written in our blood

Destiny waits
We choose our own  path
Yet share the same end
This beckoning oblivion

This beckoning oblivion
