DNA created slaves
Born the archetype - forefather of man
Embryonic deficiencies
Miscreation humanity
The evolution begins...

Brought upon Earth
A plague of deception
A slave race revolution
Through archetype design

Fuelled by hate
Greed and malice
A flawed creation
Self deprivation reigns
The Earth will never be the same

A catalyst created
Count down to the end of the world
Monstrosity, anomaly
We are the virus

Brought upon Earth
A plague of deception
A slave race revolution
Through archetype design

Brought upon Earth
A plague of deception
A slave race revolution
Through archetype design
