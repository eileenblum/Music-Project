Morbid terror
Godless forever
World, slaves to hypocrisy

Living life my own way
I strive for everything I do
Determined to take what's mine
Existence divided by belief and lies

Sheltered by your own ignorance, you're blind to see
That we are one with this Earth
Self serving entity
If there is a god - one almighty power
Will it hear your prayers?...
Give you the answers?...

Rise
Strive
Eternally godless

Burning hate forms scars that never heal
Four walls with no doors
Suffer this my own way
I'll die for anything I do
Determined to take what's mine
Existence divided by belief and lies

Sheltered by your own ignorance, you're blind to see
That we're destroying this Earth
Self ending entity
If there is a god - one almighty power
Will it hear your prayers?...
Give you the answers?...

Rise
Strive
Eternally godless

Godless reign

Free will denied
Conform, sheep drawn to the light
Control defied
Cast God aside

Go!
