Blood red eyes
Thoughts of genocide
Parasite
Decay of sanity
Imploded evolution
Accepted disillusion
Conscience void
Programmed to destroy

Humanity will be it's own end
The virus the cancer
This world consumed... Devoured by sentient disease
The famine of morality

Self inflicted wounds draw the virus in
The failings and suffering of mankind
Replicated, mutated, errors are the same
Destined to be remade

Facing death
Perpetual demise
Ignorance
Global suicide
Neglect and self destruction
Dawn of a dark horizon
Gluttony
We gorge on our existence

Suffering in it's finest form
Internal, forever scorned
With intentions of hate that we nurture within
Vile acts of volition, over aeons of old

Humanity will be it's own end
The virus the cancer
This world consumed... Devoured by sentient disease
The famine of morality

Self inflicted wounds draw the virus in
The failings and suffering of mankind
Replicated, mutated, errors are the same
Destined to be remade
