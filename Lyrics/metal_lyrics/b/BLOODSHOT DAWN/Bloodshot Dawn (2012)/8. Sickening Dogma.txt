I will rise, feeding the blind
Propagate a need for dependency

Man made God - Apotheosis
They have no right, yet say they do
To take what they want from you
This sickening dogma

I divide - deceiving the weak of faith
In the strength of their minds

One by one - tyrants will fall
Scriptures will burn - vindictive lies
Now lift the veil from sleeping eyes
Truth bought to light - awakened minds

Man made God - Apotheosis
They have no right, yet say they do
To take what they want from you
This sickening dogma
