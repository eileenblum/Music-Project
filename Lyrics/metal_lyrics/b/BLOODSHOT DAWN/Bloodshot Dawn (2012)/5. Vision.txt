[Solo: Ellis]

Convoluted past, unrepentant sin
Behold the arrogance, of a race dying
Desire to liberate, pretence to dominate
An age of suffering

War
That never ends
Greed
Forcing us to bend
Pain
The last days of man
Visions of a master plan

[Solo: Ellis]

The light that blinds, searing through my mind
Visions that speak of a crimson sky
Rise the sun of a bloodshot dawn
Our time is over, visions have been spoken
A new chapter opens
Now comes the time of a grand design

Reckless disregard suffers punishment
As the ones before, we bite the hand that feeds
Failure to learn what history has taught
We are our own downfall

Fire
Consumes the sky
Seas
Boil and turn to blood
Pain
Of our timely demise
A new dawn will airse

[Lead: Ellis]

[Solo: McMorran]

And as the old world dies
Remorse saved for none
When we face our own demise
You'll burn in the heat of a bloody sun

[Solo: McMorran]

[Leads: Ellis]

The light that blinds, searing through my mind
Visions that speak of a crimson sky
Rise the sun of a bloodshot dawn
Our time is over, visions have been spoken
A new chapter opens
Now comes the time of a grand design
