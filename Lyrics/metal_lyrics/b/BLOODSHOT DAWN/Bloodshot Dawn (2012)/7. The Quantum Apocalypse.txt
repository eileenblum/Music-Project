End of the line
All existence ends
Universal collapse
Our destiny's tied
Solar systems collide
Gravities relapse
A black hole erupts, to consume all life
Not even light can avoid this fate
Cataclysmic destruction

This is our end
The quantum apocalypse
Nothing will remain
Time and light extinguished

Death of a star
Only the beginning
Matter is no more
Vortex of end
Planets collide
The living die
A black hole erupts, to consume all life
Trapped in a void, forever destroyed
Crushed into nothing

Forces unseen begin the cosmic unravelling
What once was all will be returned to nothingness

[Lead: Ellis]

This is our end
The quantum apocalypse
Nothing will remain
Time and light extinguished

Caught on the event horizon - gravity snared
All light now turns to darkness - matter erased

This is our end
The quantum apocalypse
Nothing will remain
Time and light extinguished

Caught on the event horizon - gravity snared
