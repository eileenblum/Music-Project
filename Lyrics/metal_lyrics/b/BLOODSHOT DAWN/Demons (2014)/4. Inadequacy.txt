I have a story to tell, living in my own hell
Complications, interrogations of my own thoughts
Inadequacy to expectation, forever striving for what?
How can you know what you want if you don't know yourself?

In the vortex of thought
My mind collides with my empathy
Complexity of inadequacy
Shaping the path that will be

[Verse:]
Pushing the limits of human capacity
Blind by self expectations, a driving tenacity

[Pro-chorus:]
Standing still in the eye of the storm
While everything's torn apart
A twisted sense of fascination
How did you let it get this far?

[Chorus:]
I'm at the edge of ruin
Caving under the pressures that I put on myself
In danger of burning out

Complexities of my mind
Failing to see the grand design
Concerns for others thoughts
Hindering me, my future diseased

[Verse]
[Pro-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo: McMorran]
[Solo: Ellis]
