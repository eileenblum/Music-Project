Infinite life, recycled matter erupts
Light reforms, planets are torn as power is formed
From black hole devastation, time and space, recreation
Infinite...

[Chorus:]
Beyond all comprehension
The galaxy becomes part of a new dimension
Beyond the realm of no light
Foul species shall thrive

Gravity's force, aeon of endless creation
Solar system's source, the Sun is god

Our earth's destiny out of our control
Destruction of all worlds, collision of fire and planets
Behold the death of everything, the birth of a new beginning
Infinity...

[Chorus]

[Verse:]
As we return to the void from which we came
Nothing will remain

[Solo: McMorran]
[Solo: Ellis]

[Chorus]
[Verse]
