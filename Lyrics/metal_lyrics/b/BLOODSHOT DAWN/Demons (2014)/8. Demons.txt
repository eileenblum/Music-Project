So many things I can't remember
Too many things I can't forget
The thoughts that keep me awake and plague me with regret
A constant reminder of mistakes I cannot escape

A wretched ache that never leaves
The scars unseen
Caught in the shadow of a memory
My mind's my enemy

My mind's my enemy

These demons
They're haunting me - they're all I see
These demons
Threaten with destiny - it's changing me

Can't say you didn't see it coming
And now you're losing this war
You're the only one in it now... The others have moved on
So stop saving face and start saving your soul

Can't keep living this way
Won't dull this pain
Stop trying to fight it alone
Now let these demons go!

Let these demons go!

Go!

These demons
They're haunting me - they're all I see
These demons
Threaten with destiny - it's changing me

[Solo: Benjamin Ellis]

These demons
They're haunting me - they're all I see

No more will demons be haunting me
I set them free
