Rising
A fear of unknowing and misinformation
The Death of indignation
pure ignorance

Powers
Force fed facts to deter the mind
What's real? What is lies?
When is our time to die?

[Chorus:]
Serpent's tongue
Spitting poison
When you look upon the mirror
Can you face what you're blind to see?
No more lies
We won't survive
If you read between the lines
You'll see beyond the blindfold of our times

Rising
Hidden agenda, battles of nations
The death of care and reason
Total war

Powers
Force fed facts to deter the mind
What's real? What is lies?
Now is our time to die!

Living in fear
We are more than this
Civilization was built under nations
Of humans existing as one

[Chorus]

[Solo: Ellis]
[Solo: McMorran]

[Chorus]
