Behold!

Behold your empire of ritual disdain
With you the martyr king
Crying out for the advent of change
While clutching so tight to your invisible chains

You keep your mouth shut for fear of judgement
As soon as backs are turned you abandon your silence
You're a hypocrite and liar, but you know this too well

[Chorus:]
We are unified in chains
That hold us to the ground
Content to blend with the crowd
Mediocrity resounds

Behold, the signs of a fractured mind
Now push it 'til it breaks
So fucking used to denying yourself
You know it must end, but you do it so well

I hold your world in the palm of my hand
I'll squeeze the life right out of you...

[Chorus]

We are unified in chains
That hold us to the ground
Content to blend with the crowd
Identity unfound

[Solo: Ellis]

You say that we are unified
I say that we have lost control

I refuse to accept that this is my only solution
A broken machine that no one even tries to fix anymore
I am sick of pretending that this is the only way for me
This is not who I am meant to be...
It's meant to be

[Solo: Ellis]
[Solo: McMorran]

[Chorus]

A time will come when this will be undone
As all you thought you knew turns out was never true
And all that we are returns to the start
But I'll welcome in the end to begin and grow again
