Born...
A pure existence untainted by others
We go through time ingesting negatives and lies
But ask yourself, what is life?

You must not hold your problems
The time is up
If you don't face the facts
Your mind will erupt

[Pre-chorus:]
Mind over matter, trivial factors
Control the storm within the head

[Chorus:]
You must cast into shadow
All the hate and fear for a better tomorrow
We won't be defeated
The consequence complex controls
Shaped thoughts of all will falter
As your mind is filled and becomes altered
Break free from the shackles of your mind
And see the grand design

Living...
Animosity is rife
Journey of life, unfathomable pain
Take from the positive, not negatives and lies
With questions unanswered, this is life...
