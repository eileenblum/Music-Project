You close your eyes and try to recall
But can only glimpse the splintered pieces of the whole
Try to catch them and they drift out of sight
The Image Faded
Unclear after all this time

Begin scrabbling for inspired fiction
Subconscious fabricates a distorted scene of the story you left behind

Living your life in a dream
Of the day that never comes
A fantasy so clear
Only to wake and findâ¦

â¦ Nothing can live up to this
The images in your head
Start to believe it and youâre losing your grip
Addicted to a made up world

Now indifferent to your waking life
You pray for endless night
Keep your head in the clouds and your life will pass you by

Living your life in a dream
Of the day that never comes
A fantasy so clear
Only to wake and find it never was

With every sleep you return
To the day that never comes
But always wake to find it never was

[Solo]

Living your life in a dream
Of the day that never comes
A fantasy so clear
Only to wake and find it never was

With every sleep you return
To the day that never comes

But always wake to find it never was
