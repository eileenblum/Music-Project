[Chorus:]
Caught between your lack of empathy and callous greed
The Human Void dominates me
Caught in the boundaries of my mind
All emotion declines
Set yourself free from the plague of humanity
Open the doors of your mind and leave
Among the Human Void
Existing without reason, living without ploy

Vicariously live your life without compassion
A grotesque trait of the human condition
I can't deny we all fall for it
Yet we preach contradiction, hypocrites

[Verse:]
Soul destroyed
Human Void
We all fall into the void, catastrophe
We all live an existence with care from sins absolved?

[Chorus]

Life without compassion will lead to our extinction
I won't deny and embrace it
In the blink of an eye, we are just hypocrites

[Verse:]

Human
Human Void
Shallow and Callous
We exploit
Burn it all

[Solo: McMorran]
[Solo: Ellis]

Burn it all, this failing society
Through self absorption we damned ourselves into nether
We are beyond salvation
