Unholy acts of miseration 
Cause for reaction - Meaningless destruction 
At war with ourselves 
And within the mind 
We are running out of time 

Theoktony - the death of all Gods 
As humanity breaks free 
From the chains of the Dogma 
Remove the blindfold of deceit 
The world no longer cast in shadow 
Our own path we shall follow 
As the world sees itself in new light 

[Solo: Ellis] 

Religious tyranny of this Earth 
Begins to fall 
Innocent suffering plagues us 
The world at war 

Unholy Acts 
Discrimination 
Cost of reaction - Infernal Retribution 
At war with ourselves 
And within the mind 
We are running out of time 

We must erase the concept of God 
Before we destroy ourselves and everything we stand for 
When's there nothing left, where will you fall?

Eyes fixed forward 
No looking back 
Deny the devastation they left in their wake. 

Time has come to forget 
Those who outlived their purpose 
Left them for dead now 

[Lead: Ellis] 

Theoktony - the death of all Gods 
As humanity breaks free 
From the chains of the Dogma 
Remove the blindfold of deceit 
The world no longer cast in shadow 
Our own path we shall follow 
As the world sees itself in new light
