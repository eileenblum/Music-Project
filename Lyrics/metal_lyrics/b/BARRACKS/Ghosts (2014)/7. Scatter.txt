Scatter, scatter

They scattered your bones from the inside of trees
Rings around fingers from years and then leaves
Footsteps like roots itch the halls in the summer
Words cut like knives from the throats of another

I swear he said "throw me to the waves
or bury me where I lay"

No refuge in sin from blood or red wine
I found god in a pill but faith comes with a price
