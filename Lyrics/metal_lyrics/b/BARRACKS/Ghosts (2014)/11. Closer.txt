Let me tell you a secret, why they're all so scared
Let me let you in, inside my fucked up head
We used to jump shadows, tried not to fall in
But last night I did and I lost everything

So come a little closer
Don't come any closer

Walked down Caernarvon 'til we were alone
I just didn't want him to follow me home
The darkness made me believe in the sun
You're trapped with me now and there's no place to run

So come a little closer
Don't come any closer

I'm not you
You're not real
You're not here
