I can see the sun in your eyes
And it burns out and pulls me in at night
Your eyelids wane and change with the tide
I just want you to know that everything will be alright

You left a mark in the sky
But we're lost for now
Your lips are moving
But I can't hear a sound

There's ice on your skin
Slow-frozen gray
I just can't speak
I don't know what to say

You're swimming through my blood again
Hang heavy in the winter rain
