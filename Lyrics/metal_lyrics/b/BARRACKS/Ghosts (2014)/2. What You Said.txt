I've been running for most of my life
From something that I can't seem to find
I can't remember why I'm so scared

But I remember what you said
That this is nothing new
You said what you said
You gave me shit so there's nothing to lose

This is nothing new
I just hope you've got nothing to lose cos I do

We've seen better days
All these things that I'm trying to change
I showed you my ghosts
Then I became your own
