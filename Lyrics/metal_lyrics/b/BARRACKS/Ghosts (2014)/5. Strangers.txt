You've got them cold, dead eyes
Minutes like razors, hours like knives
The places where the day just wore down your spine
Sometimes you can live and still not feel alive

Watching the sun go down
Waiting for the night to come around
I know what I said, I know how you felt
Now I just want you to come around and

Just forget everything
Show me the places you won't let anyone else in

We could be strangers

You've got them cold, dead eyes
Your demons escaped and they ate you alive
The night comes in cold and it crawls down your spine
