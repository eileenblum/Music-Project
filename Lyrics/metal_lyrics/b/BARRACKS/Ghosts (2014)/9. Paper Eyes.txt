Are we afraid of our own voices
I'm buried under concrete weighted down by my own vices
Are we just clay and dirt, broken down and reinvented
This voice is your own, bouncing off the walls

Just listen
"I am afraid"

Everywhere I walk, paper eyes follow me
I'm sick and tired of always being told who to be

Are we so caught in our own traps
Invented disorders keep us locked inside our heads
We all need someone to blame
But I'm the one responsible for where I am today
