I feel like I haven't slept in weeks
Making maps of this town on the soles of my feet
Do you remember we spent the nights indoors
Now I've been outside I know

How much of this can we bear before we find out
We've heard it all before, we spoke it all ourselves
It's easy to take the wrong meaning from the words that we say
So now I have to speak up and break down the walls that we've made

You're worth more than this
Don't sell yourself short

You're left with nothing except
The people that stood on you and left you for dead
I'd rather lose this all in exchange for the truth
Than be someone like you

I feel like I've been asleep for weeks
These are my nightmares, can't wake from this dream
I'm not fucking blind
I won't sell myself short this time

In the end we all have the same demons
