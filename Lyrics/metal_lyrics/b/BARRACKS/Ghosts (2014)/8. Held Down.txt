Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my head
Every day I lose some leverage
Every day I'm giving in
Like a rat afraid to take a step
Living in fear of breaking my own neck

This is where the panic sets in
First world paranoia of blood that won't thicken
I keep bending my chains but they just won't give
In a world where your paycheck says how much you can live

We need to break out
I won't be held down
