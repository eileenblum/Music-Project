Are there ghosts in my house
Because lately I've been hearing
Gnash teeth marking the pavement
Cold bones break in the evening
The floor boards are creaking now
You should be sleeping now
But I keep having the same dream
That they're coming to get me

Show me the cracks in the pavement
Show me the dark in your dreams when you're dreaming
Show me your underneath
Show me your skin in the sheets

I never saw the way out through the cracks in the floor
