You used to tell me everything would be alright
But that never stopped me from lying awake at night
The lives I'd never live, the songs I'd never sing
Drowning in my own fucking memories

Lift your skinny fists, kid
The scraping of the city's growing concrete in your skin

I won't give in
Remember the songs we used to sing

Hold on now, keep breathing
It still isn't over yet

Lift your fists and fight back
