Ridiculous!

Control lucks the sky and cheats my conceptions
Narco-Hypnosis, unwilling, take my life!
Keeping us in a state of fear.

Aging with anger, Civil unrest withholds my spine
Interectual dead mind!

Are you tuned to human standards?
Are you tuned to their standards?

This technetronic leash tugs on our self judgement
Polluting our ucking brains, with wants
Neural cell manipulation

Machined brain, machined brain, machined brain
Please change the channel

Dumbing down of humanity, dumbing down!
Dumbing down of humanity.

Victims of a programmable assassinations
Victims of a programmable assassinations
Victims of a programmable assassinations
Victims of a programmable assassinations

Using our emotions, as strings to control us

Control us!
Control us!

Repetition finds it's nest in the mind of the weak
Laying a method of citizen control
Distracted by flashes and invisable power governs our path

Your now recruited
An animal tested
This is the time and age
Please emake sure you wave, make sure you wave!

Mind Control!
