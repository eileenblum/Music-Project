A miracle has save your life
and graced your presence with faith
Running through this mysterious creation

Taking a path with footsteps, that lead nowhere
Taking a path with footsteps, that lead nowhere

A wizard of the land
Which eyes have never seen
An illusion from the mainstream

Knees that worship
Arms raised, eyes closed
It's a cold winter for the weak

Baptized with no intuition,
Living life by the book
Take this and drink from it
For its the blood of Christ

Baptized with no intuition,
Living life by the book
Take this and drink from it
For its the blood of Christ!

Get off your knees!
Your imaginary friends will not respond
They will not respond!

Word of the gospel a contagious fairytale has controlled how you live,
Paying your way into the heavens

Disciples
You have served your life sentence
Desciples!
You have served your life sentence

Disciples!
Disciples!

You have severed you life sentence.
