We live our daily lives understanding almost nothing of the world!
Most giving little thought
To the machanics that generate the sunlight and make life possible
Few of us spend anytime wondering, why nature is the way it is, and how gravity cements us to an earth that would otherwise send us spinning off into space, spinning off into space!
And where did cosmos come from? or was it always here? Was it always, was it always here?

Do you ever wonder the atoms of which we are made?
And on who's stability we fundamentally depend.
And if time will on day flow backwards.
Causing alternate dimensions
An earth on day warped through a black hole.
We lack experience, we lack honor, we lack intellect, we lack the truth
Breezing though your life no knowing a grain of the world's sand!
Most of us stay within walls and lack the wisdom to reach nirvana
