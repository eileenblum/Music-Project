Sitting in your room by yourself
Lessening your values to the world
Decieving the rest
Stimulated for sakes
Inhaling into a dreamland occurs

Inhaling into a dreamland occurs
Persisting the everlasting feeling of freedom
Fantasy clouds your mind,
Altering your perception
Color are oh so wonderful!

Triple fucking vision
Triple fucking vision
Triple vision

Excruciating tension, hyperventilation
Holding hands with death
Excruciating tension, hyperventilation
Holding hands with death!

The hellish dark engulfs your eyes and steals your consciousness
Losing control of all your senses
Losing control of all your organs
Losing the law of the jungle

Euphoria's Nightmare
Euphoria's Nightmare
Euphoria's Nightmare
Euphoria's Nightmare!

The hellish dark blacks your eyes and steals your last ounce of strength
Your soul evaporates away
Leaving your body to decay, into hell

Grasping at your last ounce of strength
Overwhelmed fighting off gravity
No one's laughing
No one knows
All your memories are lost

Euphoria's end
End!
