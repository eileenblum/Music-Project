Kept away from fear and hate
Drag out all your rage
With no one to stop you now for
They won't hear your pleed

Fall! for your, your dying lives
As they bow down at your feet
Fall! for your, your laughing cries
As I begin to bathe in your blood

All eyes inside, rest on
All eyes inside, rest on me
All eyes inside, rest on me!

Before your own downfall
You'll be sacrificed
This is not of my life
Your dark will see light
With your life

With your life!
With your life!

Drag them to see sovereignty
And let them see the throne
Kill the motherfucker and don't give a fuck
See, for he sees, he is a fool
For the feeding, a cold disease
