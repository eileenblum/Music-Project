And when it came to sit
It's wings folded
At it's own sides

Taking flight over the sky
A creature made by fear
It seemed senseless to try and fight the beast
With so many slain uncountless

As then it came to me
With wings of fire
Burning the town
Left no sound

Die endlessness
As I watch you scream
You will not change
With wings ablazed

As then it came
With wings laid in pieces
As then it came
Your time, a time for destroyed

To sons of the fucking sin
Screaming exhuasted pain
If dies if you're alive
To the sons of fucking sin
It does see what's left

Before you walk away
Ignore what rests behind
It's hunger thirsts for more

Let's rise and set out for the beast of the sky
