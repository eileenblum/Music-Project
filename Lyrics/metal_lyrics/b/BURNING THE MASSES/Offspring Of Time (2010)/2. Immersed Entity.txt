Ten thousand years pass as the flesh of a god remnants, waiting for the spark of oblation to become nevermore suppressive. Scales in the form of spines, Eyes; translucent creators of sin and enthrallment. These eyes radiate in never ending pattern until it's animation. The anticipating factor of an act of blasphemy, pagan like and serpentine. The circle created a square, the night is luminosity. A vermilion spear of light, a howl of the beast soars through the oceans of time. It's time for our abstract aspiration to shatter the arms of Morpheus. Now we are just a schematic. A figurement of time, a measurement of mine. Now we are just a race with a visible end. The human race is the only valuable source of subconscious sustenance for the underwater ensemble. Now we are just a schematic. Let the star-god apocalypse begin.
