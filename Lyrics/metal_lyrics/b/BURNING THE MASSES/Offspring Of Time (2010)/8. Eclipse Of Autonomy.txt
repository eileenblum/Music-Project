With this new division of power,
The thirst for dominance reveals the true nature of mankind.
This is a revision of truth,
We are this deception incarnate.
Breathing infects the mind.
Starvation manifest kneeling before the tyrant mother of earth.
Her walls crumble.
The Earth stands the last souls impediment.
Oh mother,
Hawk-like and atrocious,
Your enormity trail of destruction,
Deprivations strangled the thirst for light.
Immorality.

The claws of contemporaneous emulation with this new division of power
The thirst for dominance reveals the true nature of mankind.
This is a revision of truth,
We are this deception incarnate.
Floods the minds of the meek.
The final hand of Ra has taken the vow of aggregate destruction.
