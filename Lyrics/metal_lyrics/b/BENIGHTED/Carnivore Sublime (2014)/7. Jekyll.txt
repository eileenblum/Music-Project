Imagine there's nothing
Left but pain
And no way out
To escape the circle
Surrounded by spiders
Always getting closer
The circus has begun

In brutality we trust
Time to unleash the beast
Which has been tamed for too long
No mermaid for singing
No authority to obey
Just being what you are,
A perfect animal creature
Only enslaved to
His primal needs
There's no reason
To pretend any more

The social lie is over
And bursts with the rage
The creature inside,
Excruciationg pain
Starvation,
The antagonist compromise
A new level of being

I can only fake for now
But there's no lost hope
For the legitimate birth
Of my coming dominance
