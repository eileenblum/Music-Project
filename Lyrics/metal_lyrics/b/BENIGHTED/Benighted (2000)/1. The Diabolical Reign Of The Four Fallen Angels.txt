There's no light, just decay
Waiting for the judgement's Day, Lucifer is dying
Hell in mourning for its King
Devils gather in council to spill the blood that war appeals

Satan and Astharoth bring the war
Belzebub and Cerbere bring madness
Devil's requiem for God

Legions progress, destroying paradise
Last evil will, his dream they realize
God will be slave for Eternity
Under the reign of the four fallen Angels

Into the light, human souls fly, dying, through the Devil's path
Fire burning from everywhere, they fear the Sentence in Evil Arms
Demons staring upon God's Torment, another Path of Cross Eternal Night...
The diabolical reign of the four fallen Angels has started under the sign of cruelty.
