Darkness replaces the light; I'm a creature of Night
I hide my dark side of personality.

I'm as the wolf; bestiality rules my life and my heart
My prey tries to flee but it's running in vain
Hidden in gloomy wood, I am slavering for meat.
My sight has changed; my green eyes are now deathly pale
My blood-spotted muzzle dives deep in entrails
And I greedily devour muscle, tendons and veins.

I stare at the Moon
There's a smell of Death beneath Darkness of sky
Torture  without cruelty
In the woods reigns something funeral
Beneath Darkness of sky.

Do you know why you die?
