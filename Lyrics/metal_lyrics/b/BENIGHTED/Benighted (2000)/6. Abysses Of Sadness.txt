Falling down, searching for Satan
Your hypocrisy comes too far, too fast, stand up the ripper, coming soon
You fall into the abysses of sadness bloody curses from the one of the unlight
Hidden somewhere in old flames, manipulations of senses destroyed your mind
You wanted the forbidden but the power escaped from your hands, not betraying.

You tried through lies; you die on your lonely way
I die in my mind, ashes become my power
You created hate atrocity will come for you
I swear revenge; benighted was your cold destiny.

Power is mine
I grown too
In your mind you complain
Never-ending pain born from your doubts tears your soul apart

From the fucking dark past waking up again
Trying to justify that your fault was betraying your conscience.
You lost your mind creates a new line for your future, cold illness.
Ready for rising, smoke through the hole
Crawling from my soul, ready for a night to fight against your will

Rising again, breaking the unlight
My own destiny, escaping from the dark
Knowledge comes as the power of ancient gods
Delivering fire from the sky, burning
Thunderstorm shining over your soul
Your minute is coming, be ready.

Escaped away far from the light 
Into the night, into the dark 
In the deepest mystery, unlight
Dying too fast

Dark as the night, benighted feelings
Hate blinds your eyes, you've only enemies
Satan lines are life through your ill mind
That will never stop to rule your thoughts, haunting your nights

Trust in yourself, forgive the others
You are in the light you can choose your way
Coming from the mountains of thousand lies 
Your hope makes your strength, you can trust in future of your life.
