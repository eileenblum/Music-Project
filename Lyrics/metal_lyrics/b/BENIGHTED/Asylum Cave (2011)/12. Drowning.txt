They drown me into absolute black
All these silent and friendly bastards
Impatient to make me play their game
And feel me suffocate with anguish
My throat gets dry, lungs collapse
My chest explodes
Knelt down, I guess my hands are attached
Cause I cannot actually feel them
My shoulders hurt
The electricity burns my nerves
Those whom I hear behind
I know they do exist
Sweat makes me blind
Unable to react
Only darkness round me
Asphyxiated
Carnage
I hear your coward walk
Carnage
Is it not what you want? I wait for the first bite, grind and choke
To feel the rest of the horde rip my entire skin
I wait for the first bite, grind and choke
Ignore the end, don't mind the fall
Those whom I hear behind
In close circles of desire and unknown expectation
Excited by blood stench and primal animal fear
Archaic excitement of murderous frenzy the warm breath of the best on my neck
And movements on both sides
My own breath seems closer
Plastic film comes back on my face
Never wake me up
I drown in constant fear
Tear me into pieces inside
Heinous deceit
Nothing is over
They do exist
Those whom I hear behind
