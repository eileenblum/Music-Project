Let the blood spill, between my broken teeth
The desert landscapes stretch on the infinite horizon
Monotonous and wild
Unchain the wrath, naked skin tries to stay closed
Under the atrocious lashing sounds
Step by step appear the lugubrious furrows
Drawn by the born rivers
Their streams dig again and again, corrode the ground
Torturing the wide expanses
The sky turns black, the surfaces become quivering
The fleshy mountains like alive proudly rise
Cut in their middle, pierced under the rock
Opening the labyrinths of human thoughts
Lacerated plains by barbaric passages
Underground flows and plaintive whispers
Floods and earthquakes
Lightning strikes, traumatizes and signs the eternity with a forgotten name
Beneath a blinding light
A blinding light
The ground separates, cut in several places
The imprint of hostile elements is close to be made
Break
I clench my jaws and I bite as strong as I can
I let the blood spill between my broken teeth
Lava currents drown
The fissures
And spread the running disease
Hidden under indelible scars
Damages are made of a delicious disharmony
Like a bow sliding at random on a out of tune violin
Shapeless and devastating magmas search for the path of the surface
Fighting hopeless not to be broken
The desert landscapes stretch on the infinite horizon
Monotonous and wild
Unchain the wrath, naked skin tries to stay closed
Under the atrocious lashes
Lava currents drown
The fissures
And spread the running disease
Hidden under indelible scars
