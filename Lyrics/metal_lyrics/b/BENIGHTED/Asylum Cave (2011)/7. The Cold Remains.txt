The candle is dead, the cold remains
Keep as a memory what you did to me
Die for this! The wind makes the flame twist
Smile as you see my defeat
The scars are closed, the cold remains
The cold remains on my cold remains
Look me deep in the eyes
Around me falls the sweet and cruel darkness embrace
Let me love you, beautiful guiltiness, you devour me so slow
I can feel the demons of your run in my blood gnaw my veins from the inside
The sensation is so delicious
Hit and consume my equilibrium
Hit and consume deeds of survival
There's no wrath or remorse as I creep until the unknown abyss
It's only the fear as I see my cold remains
Spilled everywhere around me
It makes confuse my sense, forget the limits of my own body
The place where I lay savagely left to die
My tongue is dry, my teeth are chattering
I feel the awful taste and nausea envelop my brain
In an opaque veil which shrinks and smothers it
The hazy horizon grows and the flame still shakes
The pale silhouettes disappear one by one
They can dance, I don't care
There's this sweet gasp rocking my heart
Its beats are so slow and discreet now, like falling asleep
I see the candle extinguish
Fire consumes the wax and vanishes away
Daddy will never leave you my lovely kids... the scars are closed
The candle is dead, the cold remains
The cold remains on my cold remains
