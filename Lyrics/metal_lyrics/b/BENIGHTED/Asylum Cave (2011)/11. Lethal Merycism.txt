Lethal
This weird and recurrent dream my subconscious forces me to
Where I stand and behold a sinister painting I made
Holding my mother's hand the disfigured face stares at me, so little... lethal
Hidden darkness in nooks and corners
Shrouded in smokes which daze his portrait so pale
I wait for the dreadful second
The fall of the uncrosses barriers
Seeping through my dreamlike visions
Senseless and self destroying reflects
Torture quietly, dig the thin bark
A forgotten being
Without vice and purpose
His skin so cold... the eyes smile as lips are absent
Feed me with you abandoned life
Behold me brother
