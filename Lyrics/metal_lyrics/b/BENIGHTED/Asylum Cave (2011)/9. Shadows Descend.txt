Behold the ridiculous marionette
Lost in the meanders of his pathetic existence
Trapped in medical chains against the decrepit wall of his mental health
Mummified by the leather of the belts embracing him
He tries to breathe the air of a time he cannot understand anymore
Nibbles himself with each inhalation
His life's solstice in stabbing mastication
Shadows descend
They chew as the architects of his sickness
Back from a denied past
They wind in a threatening dance
All the familiar faces with their empty eyes
Chocked screams in abortion of the coming insane
Kill them all! Josef
Paints of the wounds color the skin
The shy brook of hemorrhage becomes a nile
A dreamlike travel without a return
Definitive sacrifice of realities without a curse
