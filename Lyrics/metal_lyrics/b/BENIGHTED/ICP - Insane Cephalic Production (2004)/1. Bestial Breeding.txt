Hurt my eyes, dear sweet daylight
In this sticky and damp cave
Where my body lies
Unmoving with my ravaged face deep in the mud

Feeling the lashes of whip
Love conditioned in violence
Bestial breeding

Squestration, parental molestation
Learning by the blows the reality of life

Existence through sufferings
My only one wish is to return
This life I never asked
Flesh is hurt by the beats
I hear the steps coming near me
And again he started to molest my body

"Beast, bastard,
You feel the wrath boiling into me, you compelled me to do that
Cast down your eyes and don't defy me
You know what is waiting for you !"

Confrontation, humiliation
Sweat burns my wounds, it's not enough
I ask for more
Bestial breeding.
