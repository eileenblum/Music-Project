Hear my cries, white is everywhere
There's no way to escape from this strange nightmare
In front of me attached on a bed
Lies the corpse of a child
With a face so pale
He turns his head and his glance meets mine
His voice resounds in me
Hurts and pierces my mind
Words of hatred try to dominate
Religious incantations desecrate my will
"Come to me little child,
See in my the resurrection of your god !
Self-proclaimed god
I am the one who lives in your entrails 
Make you rot from inside
Invade me, blasphemy,
*I submit you to serve me
Your blood is mine, I'm your god
Alive
You'll learn to believe in my twisted existence
Crouched in the depths of your conscience
All the concepts fly away
End of dreams, beginning of fear."
Nervous disorder, go away !
Vicious imposter torturing my mind
Mental parasite, go away from me !
His words terrify me and I fall upon him
Severe corporal punishment
By pure act of the rage, uncontrolled
Blinded by blinkers of madness
The child lies disgorged
The white bed becomes red with his innocent blood
My eyes are lost in this ocean
Flowing on the ground until my feet
I sit in the most obscure corner of the room
As the child still look at me
I understand what death is really talking about.
