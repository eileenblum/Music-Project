he inconscious repression always grows in the head
There's no forgiveness inside, it's just a semblance of truth
This unacceptable state cuts the mind in two
And one of them disappears in the limbs of oblivion
Anormal human behaviour by morbid rationalization
Installs istelf disguised by perversion
Restrictionof the vision, diversions, manipulations
All the tricks are used to realize the deviated purposes
Dementia, the precocious symptoms of mental perversion
Anger from disturbed childhood
Comes through unconscious paths
Far from our reality, hate for his identity
He wants to become more than a simple human
And behind a wall of lies, build his own pleasure
Violence as answer to affective deficiency
Forever torn between repulsion and fascination
