Begetting of disorder nature
Perpueral cannibalism
The sensation to be devoured
And consumed little by little

She recognizes him behind his disguise, guessing his features
Vile creature 
She sees his unhealthy and sinister smile
As the beginning of her torments

Organic liquids flow through the natural
Wide opened wounds of her chest
His mouth does harm, burns the areola
Masticates the breast until the blood

His pupils are shining, inspiring the dread,
In the abysses of the eye she could see the bottom of hell
Absorbing her vital substance
The murmurs of a nameless fear, torture of the flesh by the flesh
Like a cancer which would spread to all the organism

Sensitive illusions, victim of visual hallucinations
Each cry hurts the drums, tears the mind apart
Hunger for killing, thirst for the evil

It would settle  the cells until yhe last one in her
Best disguise of the devil hidden behind the picture of the innocence
Her own-blood is searching for self-destruction

Unable to move like paralysed
Perpueral cannibalism
Used as food she can just let it do
Tetanized by what she has by her
