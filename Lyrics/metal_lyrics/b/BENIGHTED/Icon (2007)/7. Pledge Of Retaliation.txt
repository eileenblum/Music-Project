Daddy has told me when he was alive
That forgiveness is strength
And all That I want is to get rid of this hate which gnaws me
Accept my forgiveness and fall !

My bitterness devours my entrails, takes the entire place in me
Don't consider me as your enemy but sleep with an eye open

Cause the day will come and all my fondness will fall on you
I'll clasp you so much that I will be able to hear
The sound of your broken bones
A word from me will slide on you as a scalpel on your skin
You'll understand what my terror means
And my imploring glance will make you sick
Accept my forgiveness and fall

I look at myself and I probe my mind
What I can see destroys me everyday

Pledge of retaliation
The day will come and all my fondness will fall on you
I'll clasp you so much that I will be able to hear
The sound of your broken bones

I don't want any revenge just a return to the balance
The thing which helps me to live is to know you suffer
I'll stand stoical admiring your slow decline

Please, accept me to forget it all but never turn your back
All is behind now but I am sorry
Cause the unconscious work is not over
