There's this vision of red colour on the stainless snow
Painful senses, kindly coldness
The shy warmness fleeing little by little
Let the place to the emptiness of unknown feelings
Smile then bleed
You smile?
No affection on my face

Each heartbeat I can feel is like a slow step to chaos
Irremediably attracted to the other side

A long way to the breakpoint
I saw the gleam and followed it, this trail tinged with blood
As the macabre furrow of my life

I dream about beautiful work I let behind
Transported by the desire to lose all that remains me
My eyes are closed
And I hear this voice repeating this words "smile then bleed"
White and red together are splendid

A long way to the breakpoint
I saw the gleam and followed it, this trail tinged with blood
As the macabre furrow of my life

The landscape is peaceful and hostility has disappeared
A piece of resplendent cruelty, progeny of the sufferings inside

I let you as memory this glorious picture
Where the colours of life and death are mixed in a last breath
Then I put the light off

A long way to the breakpoint
I saw the gleam and followed it, this trail tinged with blood
As the macabre furrow of my life
Asleep with a smile on my face
