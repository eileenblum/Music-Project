Saw it all
When it happens that you love someone this someone possesses you
I refuse to be possessed by anyone on Earth
My silentglance is a torture for the mirror of the mind
Because people feel like if I was seeing through them instead of seeing them
Just take a look over yout shoulder

I dreamt they spilled blood everywhere around me
And I found it really aesthetic
All these people I killed, in particular the one I killed so many times

A part of me wants to make love with her
Another wants to see her head on a pick
Adrenaline grows and the excitation gets its paroxysm
With the sexual dimension of the knife entering the flesh

Just take a look over your shoulder
I saw it all
Embraced your life
Saw it all
Leaded you behind
Coloness takes me away and the sight of colours is so delicious
Consider that your pain's nothing, compared to mine

When it happens that you love someone this someone possesses you
I refuse to be possessed by anyone on Earth
The instinct for destruction has no limit anymore and my work is now
To exterminate what does not deserve to live
Even my reason I want to be delivered from

Saw it all
Embraced your life
Saw it all
Leaded you behind
Coloness takes me away and the sight of colours is so delicious
Consider that your pain's nothing, compared to mine
