How easy and comfortable it's to be master in your own world
Enter my circle and let be a human instrument of it
Betray me and wait for your retribution

The mind next to the body patiently waits
And takes a look at the ill entity
The weak empty body enchained to unavoidable decrepitude
Condemned to return to ashes as impotent witness
My rules, my vision, my doom

You can be all and nothing from a second to another
As you're over with human state there's no turning back
Just patiently wait for your fate
Human as I know me
Thing as I deny you

This is an abstract conviction,
Everything still exists by the simple idea I have on it
Spiritually beheaded
When you're out of my circle you lose the right to be someone
Someone becomes something
And now something can pretend to have won the right to die
Human circles

Traumatism in my mind
The subject of my deceit is in front of me
Ans blood is boiling in my veins as the rage's growing in me

You can be all and nothing from a second to another
As you're over with human state there's noturning back
Just patiently wait for you fate
Human as I know you
Thing as I deny you

This is an abstract conviction
Everything still exists by the simple idea I have on it
Spiritually beheaded
Human circles

All of them are just things for me
