In my den of limbs where I've been sent by the immortal gods
I reign and I count your days
Do you believe in atrocities of divine punishment
Hovering above your head?
I judge you die
Stones of my edifice will slowly become my throne
My venom gnaws your founding
The sinner pays for the fault

Behind the loop-holes I will witness and then I'll designate
Who shall answer who shall die?
Asepticized brains hidden behind the mirror of their lies
Nothing will be forgotten

[Chorus:]
I judge you die
In my domain, I reign
I count your days, human
Your blood is my emblem
Nothing will stay but the silence that dominate
The silence that I hate
I judge you die

I am the divinity, the sovereign
See in me the phantasm everyone is looking for
Rising high in the sky, my shadow above you

Ready the fall the arm of justice
Womb of the earth is deadly infected
The arrival of my command
For the advent of a dehumanized world

[Chorus]

Such a violence in a room is very impressive
Smashing her face on the walls
A disconnected woman
