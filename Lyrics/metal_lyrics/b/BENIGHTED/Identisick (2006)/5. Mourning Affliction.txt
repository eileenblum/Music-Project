I dreamt I was in the skin of someone else
And everybody around me
Told me that I was this man
Preferred blindness to lucidity

Truth is a blinding sun that sight can't stand
To fill the emptiness with flight

[Chorus:]
Mourning affliction makes the lie
Makes the madness
Torn away

Ancient trauma, epileptic passage, the rebirth of rage
Subconscious
Deceased person, his face comes to my mind
So familiar but so frightening
Lying powers dominate

I'm the sum of the identities which compose me
As pieces of puzzle
The real one falls in nothingness
Lost in dark parallel spheres
Let it die
You lie, let him die
Escape by all means the conscience of the mortal state

[Chorus]
