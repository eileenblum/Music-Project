There's this strange feeling invading me in all my being
It prevents me from all kind of thoughts
Without humanity
Inaccessible things torture me, gnaw my entrails

I am slave to this unknown entity
A burning demon watching me in each place I can go
An external part makes my life unbearable
My last moments of peace are when I see it bleed
As I pierce it through an through
My reason is drowning in an
Absence of delight

There's this strange feeling invading me in all my being
It prevents me from all kind of thoughts
Without humanity, inaccessible things torture me, gnaw my entrails
Disharmonic nature between human being and animal kingdom

[Chorus:]
Sex-addicted
Blind is the soul as you rise in bestiality
Psychotic world ruled by twisted sexuality
Nowhere to hide if you need to escape
I mutilate

As the blood runs from the sores, I feel guilty
The days are gone, only stay the scars of my wrath
Hidden in silence, followed by its presence
Can't be delivered from my own-existence
Monomaniac

Tomorrow the time will come and the wounds will be closed
The constant persecutions will never end no more
Once again I won't be alone and will lose the control
And you'll take the entire place in me, my dark tormentor

[Chorus]
