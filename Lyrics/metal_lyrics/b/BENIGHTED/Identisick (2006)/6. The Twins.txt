Darkness and nothing else in his eyes
And once again he awakes in this closed unknown chamber
Explaining parts of childhood coming to him
His remembers are woolly, no birth-date
Past forgotten
Vicious, dangerous, incurable

As all the other times he's searching for his brother
Supposing that he owes him this new solitary confinement
Fixed glance, he pricks up the ear
Assuring us he knows who's behind the door
Negation of our existence
He begins to speak alone

Who are you? Are you the other me?
How could I know who I am? I'm just a half of myself
Again I feel this pain

[Chorus:]
Do you hear my voice behind this fucking door?
I hear you my brother
why have they put us in a strange place?
Why don't I remember?
I have to tell you something, we've done something evil
We have murdered our father
We've done it together

Dissociation of mind always torn between fraternal love and hate

He refuses to pay the price for his fault
Fit of anger he violently breaks the door
And as he realizes what stand behind
Not his brother but absolutely nothing

[Chorus]
