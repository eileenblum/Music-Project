Greed becomes wrath, annoyed, hateful
Out of control, no sky above
Lust as the life turns to the deepest disgust

I hear this voice in my head 
Ruling all my thoughts now until the lie.

From desire to disgust
All dimensions are collapsed
From desire to disgust
My feelings are a lie for me
Where the root of the evil is searching for another me.

Hell is let loose in me
War in the head, visions in red
Mental perturbation, senses abolition.

Shut in avidity
I'm shut up in avidity
Destroying what I desire

From desire to disgust
I hear this voice in my head
Ruling all my thoughts now until the lie.
