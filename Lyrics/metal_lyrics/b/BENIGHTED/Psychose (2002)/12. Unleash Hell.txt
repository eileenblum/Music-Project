Dying, crossing the Styx to the other side
Entering abysmal world
Feeling extreme coldness from winds of hate
To endly regret past mortal pain

Listening to the howlings
Sleeping without dreaming
Pictures of murderous scenes where blood and tears mix together
To create a morbid essence

Entrails burn from inside, face the beast, unleash hell now
Bloodbath torture the weak, skin the lamb, unleash hell.

Blackness of my thoughts still so deep
Lightning of wrath fall on flesh

Mass decayed, putrefying, submitted flesh gives itself up
To the torments of a mad spirit, slow beheaded, deep delight
Dust away, burst the eyes, human belief falling insane
Crows eating corpseâs remains
The scorching heat and dismal fear reinforce the sick feeling

Drowning in death's anguish
Darkness fires unleashed
Demons devour the heart
The mind is torn apart

From the torrents of blood flows eternal hate
Mountains of cadaverous faces left to their sad fate
As the macabre essence becomes great red sea
Anger into the glance becomes euphory
Murderous delight

A mind eclipse, corporal possession will
Senses supreme annihilation
Each step in life, still a step to death.
