As my eyes open, lying in warm blood
I try to move but my body is worn out
I don't know how long Iâve been unconscious
Remains are so far ; obscurity's gone.

I ignore the date and don't feel life flying
Days are slaughtering me little by little
I crawl along the ground like a blinded child
Trying to rule the lost senses of life.

A never-ending night is taking me away
Through the path of the eternal sleep.

I have lost the control of my body I begin to slaver
Intelligence is now an old remain beast without reflex
I still lying, unmoved, lost in dark habitude
Time endless runs out embracing this slow agony

I dream of a grave under the sun
With my name engraved on the stone cross
Holding out my hand to this illusory hope, lost.

Internal bleeding, I suffocate
Life is drowning like a corpse in a casket
Die for dying, always vain...
Lost frost inside.
