Between the tombstones, my body lies, dead
Among my remains swarm the maggots
Greedily masticate
Members dislocate
Man feasting on the disinterred corpse

Muscles cut in slices trickle
Pus and blood are running from my mouth
Greedily masticate
Members dislocate
Man feasting on the disinterred corpse

I can see the scene out of my body
Necrophagous
Rotting innards, decomposing organs are devoured
Night's cruelty and the sight burn my stomach from inside

I hear that my soul cries
The wind is cold as stone
As my complains anise
My hangman licks my bones

Tasting the light, just trashing the light
To forget all the pains 
I lose my mind in my agony
Life and death are drowning in the dark.
