Tongue so dry and glance completely lost,
Feeling insane, out of control
Dreaming of a welcoming coffin
My screams born from your mouth,
keep on watching me, keep on watching me
I hate what he is doing to you during
these two hours of nothingness

Reeks of Darkened Zoopsia
I can smell you through my eyes,
Your dirty sweat is a blessing to me
Reeks of Darkened Zoopsia

The masquerade is going on, you innocent disposal,
All the clowns have stopped laughing,
They watch the dead animal's parade,
The smiling filthy little beasts...

Relaxing and terrifying
They're just still, frozen by absence of life,
Creatures of the sewers, slowly returning to dust
The whole scene suddenly fades
to black and comes back again,
Shining and painful
My bowels are killing me, 
burning from inside, close to explode
The sight is disturbing and so obsessive

The masquerade is going on, ravaging you again and again
The clowns are now long gone
On your innocence fall the curtains

Two hours of an unbearable show...
Come back to me kitty... Don't leave me alone...
