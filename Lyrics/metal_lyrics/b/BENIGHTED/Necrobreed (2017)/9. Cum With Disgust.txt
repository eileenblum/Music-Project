Paralysed in pleasure I hear you call
Lost my cognitive control
Dumb vermin opens the unexplored paths
Digs their flesh relentlessly rapes it

Following the sickness I tasted the remains of freedom
I freeze the sun, burning dopamine
Pressure increases, missing the paroxysm
Give me your worms swarming under the torn skin

Cum, cum, cum
Cum with disgust
Suck my body, drain my body until my flesh turns into dust
Cum, cum, cum
Cum with disgust
Suck my body and welcome my kids as I cum with disgust
Honor me with your bite

Skin still warm decomposing in adipocerous liquids
My spirits abandon me in these incestuous dances
Leave me lost in shame, and deceitful

Trying to reject the impure thoughts

Insults resound in my skull from the voice of the unnamed
Commanding me to send the sleeping dog to the afterlife
For his Lord to feast on my soul

Don't you see them tickle my extremities?
Why all of you remain so silent?
Don't you see them tickle my extremities?
Why all of you remain so silent?
