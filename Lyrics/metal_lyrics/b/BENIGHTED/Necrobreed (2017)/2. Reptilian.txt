Piercing my soul, my body too weak to help me flee
Nothing in control, mind turned to slavery
I became the puppet of the loving reptile

She wants me to dance like a doll
Feed me only when it pleases her
Ignoring my screams and my sufferings
From the digestive vortex killing me under her care
I would speak if only my tongue would obey

Tenderness, suffocation
Loneliness, humiliation
Happiness to deception
Her filthy eye staring at me

Reptilian brain
I suffer in front of the Lord
Flavorness liquor poisoning my blood
Reptilian brain

Get all these dirty hands off me
Their sweet touch hides your ugliness
Your serpent tongue spreads the bitten truth
Empty promises of the next dawn
Where you will leave me alone
Vulnerable, I throw up your realities
Arisen from the scales of your mortal coil

Your pathetic bait has no meaning to me
And you think I will trust you someday
Not a chance!

Prisoner of the reptile
Don't you see my leash?
