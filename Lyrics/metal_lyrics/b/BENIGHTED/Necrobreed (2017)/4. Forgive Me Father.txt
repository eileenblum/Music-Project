The weight of my miscreation crushing my shoulders
A distant echo reminds me of the abhorrent mistake
You made me
Humble servant of your unknown will
Following your steps in obscurity

Forgive me Father full of guilt I shall bend
Forgive me Father your reign comes to an end

The thorns blessed my miserable flesh
Embracing the cadaverous condition of a degenerative seed
I wear my own stigmas, I owe you nothing
Not even the filthy bile burning my stomach

This is my legacy, chronicles of an ordinary hate
Against the perfidious re-creator
All these children are mine, my own manking
Transcended in submission

I stand in front of my throne, triumphant and bloodthirsty
The authority long forgotten
The cold grasp of death vanished
I kneel in front of you, guilty and begging
Your severe glance crushing me to the ground
Forgive me Father
Liar
I absolve you from all your burdens

Mankind
Through the evil incarnated
Mankind
By needles regenerated 
My sons, my sins

I can't hear the scream of the horses anymore
Your silence remains insane and deafening
Forgive me Father your reign comes to an end

My rage is consuming me, I can barely see my leash
Deforming my neck in a heavy breath
Proud victim of a voluntary slavery
