The masquerade now ends and the garments are cast aside
The dragon has awakened and a ravenous hunger burns inside
Open wide to empty your womb, putrid jaws will grant the infant a razorblade tomb

Blinded eternally by the illusions of light
You do not recognize what stands before you
Attempt to cage it, attempt to break it
You are doomed to feed the therion

I am the devil, the devil who dances his waltz with the world as his bride
I am the hammer, the hammer which strikes into the soul of a degenerate age
I am the fire, the fire which sweeps the earth and sets hearts ablaze
I am the dragon, the dragon who lurks beyond the stars

Bear witness to the great becoming... bear witness to the great becoming...

I am the devil, the devil who dances his waltz with the world as his bride
I am the hammer, the hammer which strikes into the soul of a degenerate age
I am the fire, the fire which sweeps the earth and sets hearts ablaze
I am the dragon, the dragon who lurks beyond the stars

To feed upon their misery, to ascend through a feast of carnal delights

This is the great becoming, this is the great undoing
This is the great becoming, this is the great undoing

The masquerade now ends
