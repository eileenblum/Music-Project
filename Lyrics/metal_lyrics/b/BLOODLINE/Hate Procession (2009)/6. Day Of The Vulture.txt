Assume, move and appear like silver through rituals of sordid gesture
The godflesh of repetition unfolds
Hide, silence and fear
Spasms
Currents of nothing
Feel nothing
Poison everything
The lashes rip through eons of doctrine
Become contamination

The scales, lamp and knife of the revolution called freedom have died
Flies on the wisdom, flies on the soil we call blood, day of the vulture

Day of the vulture... day of the vulture... day of the vulture...

Rearrange, extract and modify
Exorkizein
Lamenting the flesh, it loathes you
Salutations o' ass of the world

There is no will but the greed that feeds you
There is no will but the greed that feeds you
