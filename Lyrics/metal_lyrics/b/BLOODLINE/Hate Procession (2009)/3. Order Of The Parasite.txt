Hear me slaves of the sun that never sets, oppressed citizens of the all seeing eye
You who long for the realm beyond the stars, yet swarming like vermin among the concrete tombs
Children of the dysgenic media raise your hands, servants of the tyrant king step forth into the light
Rejoice in rapture for your will is to be done, may a million voices speak as one

We defy the order of the parasite, we long for death and eradication
We are the awaken in this nightmare world and our bloodline calls for retaliation

Can you hear the deathmoans in the empire of the eye? Echoes from the pulpits, as the kings stagnate and die
Hearts were poisoned by the lie which was never told, urtered as the first light, blazed in the age of thee old
We call for the reign of death to turn into ash, as the foundations fall and armories forver clash
We won't let the failing star guide our way, as we set out to kill a world gone astray

Sing for us the songs of war and silence without end, let the tide of Hell reap the lands from all life
May the kingdom come from the sea of the ever dead, let the night spread out its wings when the beast is forever fed
The city of gold succumbs to the storm of steel and hate, let the mourning walls crumble as winds of fire descend
Kill their warriors, their peasants, their leaders and their spawn, for we are the rays of the shining new dawn

We defy the order of the parasite, we long for death and eradication
We are the awaken in this nightmare world and our bloodline calls for retaliation
