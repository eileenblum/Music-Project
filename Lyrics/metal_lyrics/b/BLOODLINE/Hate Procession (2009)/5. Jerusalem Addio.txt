Tremble armies of the heavens, your kingdom has come to its end
Chain the hearts of your children, for I intend to lead them astray
Harvest the rage of the rebellious tide... commence... commence...

Crush the keepers of the tyrant, no longer their beast shall be fed
Through the blinding of countless souls, through the silencing of thousand songs
We call the fire to redeem us and to drown the world in its cleansing tide
To drown the world in its cleansing tide

The flower of treason shall bloom no more, the wave of freedom shall reach its shore
Just like the emperors of past have lead the way, better to burn alive then fight another day

We shall cloak the stars, we shall burn your world
Pathetic creation, we are the reaper's blade

We are the reaper's blade
