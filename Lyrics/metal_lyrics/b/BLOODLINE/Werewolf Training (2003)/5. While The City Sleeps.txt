[Music:Sasrof, Set; Lyrics:MC900]

Stealing down an alley in the cold dark night
I see a nalo in the rain round street light
I stop and look and listen to the sound
As the raindrops penetrates the silence all around
Alone I gaze into the glistening street
A distant thuder echoing my heart beat
Urging me on to a secret goal
Away from this lights
From this lamp on a pole
So I turn to sleep away into the rain
Drifting like a spirit through the shadows in the lane
clutching the tools of my trade in my hand
An old boxe of matches and a gasoline can
Darkness envelops the scene like a shroud
A veil of emptiness hang from the clouds
Filling up the cracks in the desolate place
Cradled by the night in an icy embrace 

Moving through the town like a ghost in the rain
A dim reflection in a dark windowpane
blackness bockons from every side
Creeping all around all round like an incoming tide
A broken window in an empty house
I slip inside and begin to douse
The whole place with the fuel that will feed the fire
And push back the night, taking me higher
on out of the darkness in a deathly roar
The match in my hand is the key to the door
A single turn of the wrist will suffice
to open up a passage to paradise
I pause I think about the past and the gloom
The smell of gasolijne permeats the room
Every one has a little secrets he keeps
I like the fires while the city sleeps 

The match makes a graceful are to the floor
And tymes stands still when I turn for the door
whic explodes in a fire ball and throws me to the street
I hit the ground with the flames at my feet
Reaching for the night which recoils in the fire
the rain drops hiss like a devilish choir
Dying in the flames with a terrible sound
Calling all the names of the sleepers all-around
But then in the arms of the night they lay
therir dreams sprout wings and fly away
Out of their houses in a gathering flock
Swarming over head as hurry down the block
I make my escape with the greatest of ease
And safe in the darkness drop to my knees
at a lightless the window my hand on the latch
I reach down my pocket
and pull out a match...
