[Music: Sasrof, Set; Lyrics: Sasrof; Intro by Survival unit, outro by Jiehna]

Fanatic genocidal passion
With earth murdering desires
Endless repulsion towards man
and all the filthy things he admire
The worship of synthetic souls
And a order from a history of lies
May all this world finally dies 

Hatred of infernal proportions
Flow through the dephts of my soul
all love abolished
From my cold black heart 
All humans begone
Your lives are all done for
My obsession shall slay you all
I willredeem the fire and be your fall

I shall seduce your young ones
Ishall be the last one remaining
I feel the bloodlines
I am werewolf training

All emotions overthrown
All feelings deleted
They all lie
They all deserve to die
