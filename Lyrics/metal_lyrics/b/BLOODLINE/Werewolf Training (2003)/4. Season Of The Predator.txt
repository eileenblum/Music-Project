[Music and lyrics: Sasrof]

Angels of Sephiroth
You call my name in vain
Your children shall burn
In the scarlet flames of pain
My obsession reign supreme
For a total world demise
Let all life tremble in fear
As the werewolf rise
This is the razor age
This is the death of the creator
The season of the predator
The season of the predator...

I choose my preys at random
And enjoy all the aspects of hate
I wage my war in shadows
Glorious be my fate
I flow with the raptures of death
And I let this world feel my wrath
From the well of chaos sea
streams the predators path
