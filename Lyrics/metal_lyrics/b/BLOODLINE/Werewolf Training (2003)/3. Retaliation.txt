[Music and lyrics: Nigris]

Are you weak?
Are you unstable?
I'm here to weed out
Those unable
I've come
Collect your taxes
I am here
To grind our axes

War, war, war
To end all wars
Anger grows

And so he eats
Well never bite
The hand that feeds
This is a carnival
A celebration
So all rejoice;
Retaliation!
War, war, war!
To end all war.
