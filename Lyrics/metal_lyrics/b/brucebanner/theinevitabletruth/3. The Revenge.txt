She likes the weight of the hammer in her hand
His light breaths in bed
The sheet raised, lowered, lowered, raised
His head - a shadow against the wall
She picks up the hammer, looks down at his face
A meaningless face, an insignificant face
Raises the hammer, lets it fall
Down to his head
Do it while you still can
Once to break
Once to not loose pace
Once just to make sure...
