I'm walking through the door
and I know what i'm going to see once I get around the bend.
I know what I'm going to get through the wall after one hour has passed.
The door will slam.
I know who's car is going to take off after that.
Stone wall, your vice.
No ear for advice.
Stoned at the wall.
Hearts down.
Straight up.
This is your life.
What's come of your life?
Destroy your mind.
Push back from life.
Well, your dark room is luminous,
when you give yourself a chance.
When you step back from all this madness.
Step back madness.
I know your head is ready to explode.
I can see it in your eyes.
Your heart has died.
Your will has been erased.
Motivation displaced.
And this is how the story will end.
NO good will ever come of it. No.
Unless you realize you're selling yourself short.
A fine heart marked down.
And you cheapen it day by day.
Unless you realize you're selling yourself short.
And you cheapen it day by day.
