And now I'm getting bored of laughing out loud.
We wear ego like a shroud.
And we won't shut up.
Yeah, we've got it figured out this time, we're sure.
Indecision blessed.
Put our minds to rest, onto the next term.
November 7th was just another day for the world to laugh.
It was just more of the same.
The game being played shut out (shut out) the voices of sanity.
Exit concept of reason.
They shut it down.
We watched them shut it down.
They shut it down once again.
Shut down. They shut it down. Shut Down.
We let them. ( We let them shut it down)
Let's look at the facts: we're sidetracked by how much we're being taxed.
What little regard we have for human life.
We fight for the scraps and blame the poor.
All the while our future is bought and paid for.
Who manipulates the economy?
And so the story goes.
Don't let your mind be guided by who you vote for,
because chances are you don't know what's in store.
Whats in store?
