I'm Staring into the sun, waiting for it to fall down.
I've collapsed over this madness.
My hair has been pulled out. I've tried, but to no avail.
me is resting. I Finish.
Words cannot convince the mind when I can't believe my eyes.
Who am I kidding? I am dreaming.
My Time is clocked in once and for all.
All over again.
I told myself it could not fall.
But you are here as clear as the day.
It's as clear as a star on my wrist.
So long, loneliness, my love.
What you see when you look down at the star on my wrist
is what I've always hoped I'd find.
And it blows my mind.
