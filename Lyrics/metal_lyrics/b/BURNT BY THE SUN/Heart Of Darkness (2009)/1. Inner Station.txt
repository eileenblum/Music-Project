The time for truth is now gone
Hallow words compose a shallow narrative
We abrogated our sense of wit and intellect
to an instinct low, utterly savage and loathsome

We have finally come. And we have come clean with what we want of you.
This moment of time is ours and we have come clean with what we want.
And now that we are here, you have our ideals to call your own.
This moment in time is ours and we have come clean with what you will be.

"You do not speak to him. You listen to him...
The man... he's enlarged my mind...
He can be terrible, he can be terrible, and he can be mean and he can be right.
He's fighting the war. He's a great man...
You don't judge him like an ordinary man.
Civilization only comes through him.
And his security only comes through you."

There was never an intent to exit
and there is not now
There was never an intent to exit
and there wont be soon
There was never an intent to exit
and there will be none
There was never an intent to exit
Iraq of America
(There is nothing. There is no hope.)

Wake up. Open your eyes.

A stake in the cradle of civilization
at the expense of civilization itself.
An objective for decades finally achieved.
Two hundred years of progress back to the savage mind
