I swear this time is real. I swear this time is real.
Stood back and took some copious notes
observation lent some truth
evaluated where I stand.
Dove into the midst of what I would never want to be.
I'd rather drown than breathe
in what the world expects from me.

And I swear this time is real. I know this time is real.
Look over the other side of the fence...
of this thing called life.
Let me show you how it's done...
All resistance. Hesitance checked at the door.

No "just one more time."
Leave all that behind.
Full steam ahead.

No hesitance. All resistance, dedicated life.

Steamroll this life.

Pave the way through your
old ways, force the mind
into another path.

Just once this time.
Just once this life.
With nothing in vain.

I took the road less traveled upon
Sorted out what didn't belong.
Running through this life.

Sorted out what didn't belong.
No party line to string me along.
Running through this life.

Stretched this life apart.
Running through this life.

I took the road less traveled upon.
30 years and going strong.
With nothing in vain.
