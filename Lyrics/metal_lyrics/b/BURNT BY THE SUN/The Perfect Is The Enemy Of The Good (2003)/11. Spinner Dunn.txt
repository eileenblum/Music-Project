What made you think that we know?  If truth is a virus we're healthier than 
we know.  Shaken. Taken. Hardly mistaken.  Withheld. Purpose.  No clue of 
this life.  Cultured and nutured with selection.  We are students of 
fictional history. Fed an incomplete formula.  Perfect for ignorant mass 
efficiency. (Making less of you and me) Fed diets lacking truth.  Truth 
lacking relevance.  All context put on hold.  Fed diets lacking truth.  But 
I want it back with no looking back.  So tell the truth
and run.  I'll take it in, like a shot of gas burned into my brain like the sun.  No compromise.
Not even at this stage in the game.  What you perceive to be locks and chains I call the only way.
This is our humble testament to all that we don't know.  We may not know where we are but we know where not to go.
