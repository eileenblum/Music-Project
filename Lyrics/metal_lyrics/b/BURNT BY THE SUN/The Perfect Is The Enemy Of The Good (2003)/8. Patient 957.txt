Numbed to the bone.  Shaken down.  Can you feel the thickness of 24-hour days can you feel the
world and your blood escalate can you feel your body from the neck up?  You sink.  These
desperate needs call more extreme means. In a world of disease there are products to appease.
Resolution won't come back when the numbness fades.  Now more than ever.  
You never have to question the cure.  Our mark of civilization ends and 
begins with a price tag on everything.  See the ads.  All the good health 
you could have. Perfect life.  Co-payed slave.  Diagnosed and baited the
same day.  All hail this progress.  It's all for sale.  All hail.
