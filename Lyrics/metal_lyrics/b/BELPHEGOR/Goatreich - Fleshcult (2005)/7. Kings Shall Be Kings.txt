[Music: Helmuth, Lyrics: Barth]

Stamp down the fools that god adore
Tear down that lying spectre of the cenuries
Let them die in their - their misery
Torture and spare not, for they feel not

Curse them

Jesus! Allah! Mohamed!
I spit on your crapolous creeds
Jesus! Allah! Mohamed!
There is death for - for the dogs

[Lead: Helmuth]

Let Mary inviolate, be torn upon wheels
Drag their souls to awful torment
Throw them into the - the hellish pit
And perish with their - their crap dogs

Curse them

Jesus! Allah! Mohamed!
I spit on your crapolous creeds
Jesus! Allah! Mohamed!
There is death for - for the dogs

Kings shall be Kings
Power and fire is ours
