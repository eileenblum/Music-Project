[Music: Helmuth, Lyrics: Helmuth / Sigurd]

Drowned in fire
To heal my wounds
I stab the kruzifix
Through your - your forehead

Dead, your god is dead
Strangled with a rosary
Dead, your god is dead
Sepulture of hypocrisy
Dead, your god is dead
Squealing like a pig
Dead, your god is dead
Sepulture of hypocrisy

[Leads: Sigurd, Helmuth]

We burn your scriptures
Damned in fire, you fucking failed
So take your - your last breath
Feel the iron through your veins

Dead, your god is dead
Strangled with a rosary
Dead, your god is dead
Sepulture of hypocrisy
Dead, your god is dead
Squealing like a pig
Dead, your god is dead
Sepulture of hypocrisy
