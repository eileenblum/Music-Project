[Music: Helmuth, Lyrics: Sigurd]

Liars, false prophets
Cowards, holy whores
Destroy your sickening dogmas
Clerical scum

Decayed dreams of heaven
His blood was shed in vain
Blown up halls of worship
Their fall is our win

[Leads: Helmuth, Sigurd, Helmuth]

Shovel your own graves
Cuttbroat, bleed to death
Croak in your excrements
Wipe out your ulcerous kind

Decayed dreams of heaven
His blood was shed in vain
Blown up halls of worship
Their fall is our win - our win

Bleed to death!
