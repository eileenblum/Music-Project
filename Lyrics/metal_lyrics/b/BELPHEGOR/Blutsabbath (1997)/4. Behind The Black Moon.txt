Walk the way of the hunter
Not the fucking victim
Take your own decisions
Follow your path
Hail misanthropy - hail nihilism
Behind the black moon
We praise satanics rebirth

Extreme extinction rages on without mercy
Battlefield chaos distor their souls
Behind the black moon

Taste unholy water and scream
Apocalypse will return
The sun turns into everlasting blackness
Dark centuries will arrive soon
Awake them and glorify
Their purebred blood
Behind the black moon
We praise satanics rebirth

Extreme extinction rages without mercy
Battlefield chaos distort their souls
Behind the black moon
