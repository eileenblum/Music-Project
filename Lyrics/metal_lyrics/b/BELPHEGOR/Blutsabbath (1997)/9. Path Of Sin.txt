Again and again and again
You bring me to ecstasy

You have died but I don't care
Burial place is not your true relief
Fistfucks in your backdoos hole
Necropenetrating lust takes command

Path of sin - sin
Create the sin - sin

In darkness we'll always be together
Forever your body belongs to me
Wrapped in pleasure we will burn
In eternity we shall be reborn

Path of sin - sin
Create the sin - sin

1997 Last Epitaph
