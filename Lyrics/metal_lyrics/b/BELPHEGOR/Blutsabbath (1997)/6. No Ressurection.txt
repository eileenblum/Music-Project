Desecrating - with possessed burning eyes
hell has risen - the gods of pain
Pull the veins - tear out the rotted soul
take the last breath - snuff out the life

No resurrection
Massacrate the lord of the weak
Buried blessings
Destroy the remains of Christ

In the burnt out chruches
They stand awaiting their doom
Indulge in their blood
Sepulture of hypocrisy

Light of holiness
Forever now extinguished
Edure eternal pain
You foolish ghost of god
