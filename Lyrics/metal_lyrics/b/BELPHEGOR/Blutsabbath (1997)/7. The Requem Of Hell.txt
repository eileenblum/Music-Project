A dislodged angel glide onto
Cold replacing blindness
Wash the rain away
Yearning for spraying posion

The requiem - of the antichrist
Far away - from the sun
The requiem - of the antichrist
Create hell on earth

bath in warm blood is her promised
Renounce the frosting death
Icer at the enslaved
Crying dying fearing gods

The requiem - of the antichrist
Far away - from the sun
The requiem - of the antichrist
Create hell on earth

Take these almight wings and fly away
