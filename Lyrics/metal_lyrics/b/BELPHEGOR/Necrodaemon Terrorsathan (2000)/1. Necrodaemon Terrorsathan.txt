Mutilated on the cross
Blackness covered the bastards flesh
Hear the trumpets of hell
See the fire through my eyes

Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
Necrodaemon terrorsathan

Unholy sins inside my other hell
Praise the lord of disrespect
Let them die in their own curse
Because they don't feel

Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
Necrodaemon terrorsathan

Necro-daemon
Terror-sathan

Blutsathan - Herrscher des Stolzes
Das Teufelsmal - Zeichen der Erhabenheit

In the purgatory of sin
Swear the oath of blood
The black mighty raven
Picks for the eyes of jesus

Black winged angel
Reborn in chaos
Necrodaemon terrorsathan
