Christ has died - squealing like a pig
Hellish torment - seething flesh
Mocked and spitted at - his lies now ignored
Kill his minions - exterminate 'em all

Behead the disciples of god...

Turn their churches into abattoirs
Wade in desecrated blood
Bomb the vatican - crucify the (polish) whore
Cremation of holiness - destruction of faith

Profanation - Blasphemation
Fornication - Bloodperversion
