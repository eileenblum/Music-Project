Gloriole on your worm eaten head
Foul air escapes your lying mouth
Tyranny throughout the centuries of pain
Blinded zombies followed into the decline

Kneeling... in a stinking church
Crawling... before an image of god

Obliteration of adoration...

Burn the scriptures - fuck your obnoxious sermons
Shove the host - up your sanctimonious rectums

Son of stench - oppressor of vice
Castrated savior - king of imbecility
We press the thorns deeper into thy rancid body
Perennial torture - get raped by our sins...

Deride the martyrs of their crumbling dogmas
Devoted vermin poisoned with impurity
Shoot the servants of this rotten kingdom
Abomination is the wages idolatry

Shed the blood of christ - vomit upon the cross

Kneeling... crawling...
Praying... Dying...
