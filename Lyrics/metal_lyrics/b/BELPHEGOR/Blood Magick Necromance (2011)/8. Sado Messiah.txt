Brilliant totality â illuminate aethyrs
A shadow falls â shatters the veil
Necrosis draped in ruin â immutable
Malachite â your eyes inlaid in silver

SADO MESSIAH â a conquest of mortality
I'll eat your heart â to taste you again
SADO MESSIAH â your eyes reflect, no remorse
Your cunt is cold â your lips of fire

Brilliant totality â illuminate aethyrs
Smash the plateau of humanity â incredulous
Barren harlot propagating vice
Ingenious submission â as I tear apart

SADO MESSIAH â a conquest of mortality
I'll eat your heart â to taste you again
SADO MESSIAH â your eyes reflect, no remorse
Your cunt is cold â your lips of fire
