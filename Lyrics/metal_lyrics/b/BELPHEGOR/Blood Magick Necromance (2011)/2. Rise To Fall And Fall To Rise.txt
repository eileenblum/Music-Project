Purity of white â blackest, of night

RISE TO FALL AND FALL TO RISE

Take in the sight â open wide your human eyes
To stop evolving is to die â the knife in between your eyes
I am the unwavering stare
Turn the eternal balance to my whim
I burn the dark in gleeful sin

I RISE TO FALL AND FALL TO RISE

See the serpent in my eyes
Absolute violence â chaos in serenity
Blood bathed infinity â true will is my only law
I stand between â forces of light and dark
I am the middle and everywhere â I am the lamb and the shark
I am the unwavering stare
Turn the eternal balance to my whim
I burn the dark in gleeful sin

I RISE TO FALL AND FALL TO RISE

See the serpent in my eyes
Unyielding faith is the devil's claw
Light so dark â it is the white
Black is the blood â which takes flight
Unyielding faith is the devil's claw
Ethereal truth â heard not by these ears
Forbidden and driven into fears
