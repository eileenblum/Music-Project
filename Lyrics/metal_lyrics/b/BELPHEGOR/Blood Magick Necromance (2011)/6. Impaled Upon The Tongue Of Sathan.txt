Rise, rise from the deepest

Eyes of death awaken
The fields of skulls
Is the path of wisdom â die!

The confessional â is your casket â I blind you in
Winged flesh mutilation â burn the cross
Broken one by one â your angelic sworn oath

Impaled upon the tongue of Sathan

Rise, rise from the deepest

Resurrection never coming
Savor my blood cum
Revel in â the choir of screams â die!

The confessional â is your casket â I blind you in
Winged flesh mutilation â fukk the church
Broken one by one â your angelic sworn oath

Impaled upon the tongue of Sathan
Impaled are those that preach fear
