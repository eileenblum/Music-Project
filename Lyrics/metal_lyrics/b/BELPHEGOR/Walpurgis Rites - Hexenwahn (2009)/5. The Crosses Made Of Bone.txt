All they hold sacred - all they consecrated
Corrupted and trampled - lewd acts desecrated

The witch's hour - the devil's power

The affliction spreads - blood soaked oaths
A permanent Kraft - of eternal black

Sathan: Let the impurity prevail!

The crosses made of bone
In shallow graves of stone
The ravens pick the tombs
Sathan's hovering above the black mass

[Lead: Helmuth]

The twisted hymns - will forever be preached
A gospel of sickness - height of madness reached

The witch's hour - the devil's power

Children's skulls and feet - crushed and brewed
A permanent Kraft - of eternal black

Sathan: Let the impurity prevail!

The crosses made of bone
In shallow graves of stone
The ravens pick the tombs
Sathan's hovering above the black mass
