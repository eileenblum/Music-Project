Mistress feared by all - bathed in death
Lurker at the threshold - she wanders
Queen of the mighty dead - screams of bloody rape
She - Wolf devour the dawn - enter the underworld

Hekate: ...you could never live forever!

Destroyer Hekate
Savage of face
Destroyer Hekate
Drink from this mystery

Unnameable goddes - enemy of mankind
Guide me in the dead of the night - this waning moon
All is ash - return to stone
Bitter winter lasts forever - enter the underworld

Hekate: ...you could never live forever!

Destroyer Hekate
Savage of face
Destroyer Hekate
Drink from this mystery
