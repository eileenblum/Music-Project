The rebellion - of man against god
The stability - of the church
An illusion - raped by time
Pestilentia - Christorum

Rest in peace...

Divine serpents - throne of sacrilege
Fanum diabolicum- Armageddon's raid

Terror is now unleashed - only fools wait for an answer
Demons now crawl the earth - the key is in your hand
Chant your words- inside the flames
Pestilentia - Christorum

Rest in peace...

Divine serpents - throne of sacrilege
Fanum diabolicum- Armageddon's raid
