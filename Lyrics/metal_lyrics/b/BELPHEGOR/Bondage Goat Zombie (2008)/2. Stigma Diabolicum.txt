So much flesh - so many different pleasures
Receive this sacrifice - this lifeblood of mine
Infernal power - shout for the devil
He who flies - faster than the hawk

Stigma Diabolicum - possessed and branded
I cut your signs - into my flesh
Stigma Diabolicum - possessed and branded
One flesh, one spirit, one blood!

Dancing witches - wrapped in flames
Demonic claw - rips lecherous flesh
Three bleeding chunks - the beast's vestige
He who flies - faster than the hawk

Stigma Diabolicum - possessed and branded
I cut your signs - into my flesh
Stigma Diabolicum - possessed and branded
One flesh, one spirit, one blood!
