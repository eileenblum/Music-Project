[Music / Lyrics: Helmuth]

I am your will, that breathes in you
I am your birth, your life, your end

Feel the Kraft - to take revenge

Defend - your life, your freedom
Retribution - written in blood
Pride - turns to wisdom
Retribution - oh, demons of cold

[Lead:Helmuth]

I am your passion, that starts to rise
I am the god, of all - of all gods

Feel the Kraft - to give death

Defend - your life, your freedom
Retribution - written in blood
Pride - turns to wisdom
Retribution - oh, demons of cold

Angel of Retribution...
