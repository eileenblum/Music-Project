[Music: Helmuth, Lyrics: Sigurd]

Adoration - of the fools
Sickening ways of - idolatry

I deny the cross
Man made virus - rigor mortis

The Ancient Enemy
Bloodstained Depravity

[Lead: Helmuth]

Revocation - of the lies
Rancid morals - and stupidity

I deny the cross
Faith molested - buried blessings

The Ancient Enemy
Bloodstained Depravity

No god shall come before me
