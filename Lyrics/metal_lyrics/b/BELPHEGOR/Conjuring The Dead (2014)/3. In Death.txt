Cruelty is â your life that binds
Insanity is â your flesh that blinds
Mighty is â your teacher this pain
Your prison â your wish to attain

Burn my moral â restriction
Beyond excruciating constriction
Beyond the flesh â to wander free
Beyond the flesh, the soul of me

A cruel master â I hearken unto thee
Disease and suffering â shall set you free
Let death â dance as a knife
The steps in time â to bleeding strife

Burn my moral â restriction
Beyond excruciating constriction
Beyond the flesh â to wander free
Beyond the flesh, the soul of me

[Lead: Helmuth]

Burn my moral â restriction
Beyond excruciating constriction
Beyond the flesh â to wander free
Beyond the flesh, the soul of me
IN DEATH!
