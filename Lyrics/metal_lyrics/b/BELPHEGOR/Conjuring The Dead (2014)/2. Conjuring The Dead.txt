Hollow â virgin eyes ripped
Torn â just like your throat
Fester â obsession incarnate
Another grave â another sacrifice

I am misanthropic sin â sin

CONJURING THE DEAD â ancient tongue of shadows
CONJURING THE DEAD â give yourself to Sathan

[Lead: Helmuth]

Transmit â this burning torment
Bleeding â clawing at the walls
Transformed â invoking his commands
Manifest â ascend before the fall

I am crowned by the obscene

CONJURING THE DEAD â secretion sick in sin
CONJURING THE DEAD â give yourself to Sathan

I am the grinning ecstasy
I am the lord of all poison
I am misanthropic sin â sin

CONJURING THE DEAD â priest collapsing dogma
CONJURING THE DEAD â give yourself to Sathan
