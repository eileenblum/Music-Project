Abhorrent human race - you are disease
Death, misery and plague - upon the earth
I dance with demons - through the night
As floods and fire - make things right

Spell of reflection

Their bows shall be broken apart
And their swords shall enter their own hearts
Gladis eorum intret in corda ipsorum
Et arcus eorum confringatur

I mirror your hate - vomit your disgust
Put your blade - against my throat
Decapitated - you shall fall
In ashes and dust - your bones will rot. Eternally.

Spell of reflection

Their bows shall be broken apart
And their swords shall enter their own hearts
Gladis eorum intret in corda ipsorum
Et arcus eorum confringatu

Spell of reflection
Spell of extermination
