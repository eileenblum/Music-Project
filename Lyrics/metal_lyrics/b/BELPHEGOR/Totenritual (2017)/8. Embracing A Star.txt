I embrace a star - the pentagram, it illuminates
The cosmic energies - of the eternal divine

Lay before me - flesh to adore!
The body below - only a tool

Primal force of nature's core
Fill me now, gimme more

Instincts must yield - to the magickal rule!
I am rooted
I am perfect
I am ready

I open my arms - legs wide apart
Touch the five points
The shape is complete

Every man and every woman is a star

Sex-Magick, self-creation
I am the giver
I am the taker
I am the receiver

Bigger than life - I embrace a star
Fueling its core - to burn ever more

Emotionless passion - simple and cruel
I enter the Fleisch - to please myself

Creating and growing - within my own skin
