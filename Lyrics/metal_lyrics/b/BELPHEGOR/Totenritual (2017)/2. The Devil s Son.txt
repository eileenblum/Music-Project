You are tainted - the Devil is in your flesh!

Receiving blessings - of the Devil
I am progeny virtuoso - my teacher's master
None surpass my skills - I cast my soul
Into hellish fires - fire!

Hew my limbs - strain my joints
I'm the Devil's son
Chants from hell - devilish dance
I am the instrument of Sathan
Hew my limbs - strain my joints
I'm the Devil's son
Chants from hell - devilish dance
Sathan father guide my hands

Infernal powers - of majestic art
Unmatched by man on earth - I play my spell
Collecting souls - from my trance
My appetite for flesh - boundless

Hew my limbs - strain my joints
I'm the Devil's son
Chants from hell - devilish dance
I am the instrument of Sathan
Hew my limbs - strain my joints
I'm the Devil's son
Chants from hell - devilish dance
Sathan father guide my hands
