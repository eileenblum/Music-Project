We used to care
But things have changed
Where joy should reign
Painted lines on your face
To grasp your gaze restrained
So tranquil the outside rain

Stillborn, my child
Underneath the skull of night
The cold has a voice
The one that made me so old
And sweet determination
That versatile thing
It's not consolation
You are here to learn

We were born in this town
Where we cherished quiet rain

Stories everywhere
Lives were sculpted here

In this town where few know love
Our communality once so strong
Things here have changed
It airs no need to hold

I would like to meet the villain somewhere
He who tore apart
Burn his eyes with fire
And then step back, fall into peace

And watch the silver rain
The tranquil silver rain
