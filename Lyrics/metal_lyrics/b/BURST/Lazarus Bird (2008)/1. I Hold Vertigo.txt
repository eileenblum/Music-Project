What is the nature of this?
A standard always amorphic
Strange, how easy to list:
Routine tediously cyclic

I don't know where I get it from
I rely so much on expectation
Castles of air amidst this very sober reason
Yes I profess abnegation
But never you mind;
Great hopes, little one, I'll bear your delusion

I admit that no one is sovereign
Not even I
No, I don't even try
I admit that no one is sovereign
Not even I
No, I don't even try

And never you mind -- I've asked nothing of you
Nothing which lies at your promise behest
Never has nothing rang true

I don't know where I get it from
I rely so much on expectation
Castles of air amidst this very sober reason
Yes I profess abnegation
But never you mind;
Great hopes, little one, I'll bear your delusion

Master all by easy hand,
I commit no act of violence
Marching to the strike of fragile cadence

And I see you in the corner, distressed
Somehow I'm not impressed

I admit that no one is sovereign
Not even I
No, I don't even try
I admit that no one is sovereign
Not even I
No, I don't even try

But I wonder, when did we decide?
If you're determined, I promise it's done
I am with you
Changing from nothing to one
