I, author of strife
Spread ashen wings
Mad avian glare
Sharpen both talon and break

Simplify to
Modify to
Amplify to
Carry them to war

Heave, hordes
Bring me their heads on a plate
Heave, hordes
Lord of their doom and their fate

I, shepherd of fools
Congress of goats
Fell masses bleat
With lust for black blood

I will carry them to war

Simplify to
Modify to
Amplify to
Carry them to war

Heave, hordes
Bring me their heads on a plate
Heave, hordes
Lord of their doom and their fate

I will carry them to war
