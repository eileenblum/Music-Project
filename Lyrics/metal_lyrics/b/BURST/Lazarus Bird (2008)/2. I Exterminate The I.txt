Moral shadows dancing on these walls
A surge of insight amidst the fall
To know this commonwealth again
The spectre growing ever tall

And no creed remains
Only filth detained
No more wanton blindness
Disregard the value slain

In these halls -- words of grandeur riding
A western code, I detest all placid laws
Only creatures of the earth abiding

The fowl of the air
And the fish of the sea
As these I conjure
Us rendered unity reborn

Disappear
Flee
Not wither slowly away
The wind will carry me
To leave behind that which plagues a man
To simply flee

And your moral shadows dancing evermore
No surge of insight
Acuity closed the door
Forget a commonwealth again

As I exterminate the I

And start to live again
