Life cheaply spent
All feelings put aside
Deep paralyzing anguish
Pays the price, twisting the knife

Eluded for so long
My path was clean
I thought it was long since gone
Now the faces come again

Delving into depths
I never thought were there
Racing with turmoil
All visions distorted

Facing devastation
The course now set
Rebuilding from destruction
A sweet release, I swear
