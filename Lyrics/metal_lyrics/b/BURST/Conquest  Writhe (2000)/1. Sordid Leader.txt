Arms gagged
I'm flat on my back
Those nauseating grins
Covers all light, blackest lies

How unconcerned we swallow
All which we're fed
A revelation came to me
Integrity, a new entity

Genuine and truthful
I smite your grim design
Taunted, unconscious
I woke to find a life

Arms gagged
Tied to the back
With no questions asked
We shall remain on our backs
