Under siege, mental chains
As a caged rat
My will condemned
Fallen on faith of others

What the hell had I?
By god, I wonder where's my chance?
I'd sell my soul
For just one glance

Nourished on forsaken lust
Covet memories, long to be
Born of promise and devotion
Caught and bled for thee

Tired, soulstrained frantic
I free these shackled hands
On wings of promised faith
An eternity broken free
