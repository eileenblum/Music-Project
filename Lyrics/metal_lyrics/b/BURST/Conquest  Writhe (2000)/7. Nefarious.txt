Spare me your righteous lesson
This path I walk is mine
Those hollow words you speak
Won't change my made up mind

How cheap we buy our ideals
A standard set for all
How dull they seem, your idols
Submit, the worm is turning

A mind gone numb
The stinging mockery
All I feel for you is pity

It's easier to let go
Than cling to shattered dreams
I lost control
By my own choice

A mind gone numb
The stinging pain
All I have for you is pity
