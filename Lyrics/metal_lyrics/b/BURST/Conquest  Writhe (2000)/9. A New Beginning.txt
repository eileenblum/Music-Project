Polluted the ways of days to come
What more am I than what I've made?

Apathy as virtue, a self-made trap
Seated in the front row
Too ignorant to care

Turn this fatal mission
And I shall be redeemed
Ring true with creative visions

Damn it, I live, I breathe, I care in life

A new beginning, I'll find a way
Daunted by decades
I'll make my way
