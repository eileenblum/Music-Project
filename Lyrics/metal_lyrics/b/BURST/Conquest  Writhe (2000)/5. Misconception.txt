A legacy of pain
Born into suffering
Bound by some spiritual chain

Cowering under
The weight of a cross-shaped shadow
Your definition of sin
Leaves mankind crippled and cold

I pity this mindless dependency
Confess to none but yourself
Who better to judge your actions?
No damnation awaits

No man is born sinful
No rules are set
Salvation won't be found
Through self-induced starvation

No judgement awaits
Religion is misconception
