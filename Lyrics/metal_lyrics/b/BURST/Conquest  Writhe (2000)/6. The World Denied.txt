So I remain the misanthrope
The words I spoke left unheeded
No lesson learned, no will to hear
You never knew what you needed

The world denied
Mockery my reward
This world deprived
Of it's essence

So I guess I'll try my best
No need to maintain the lie
Your eyes and ears sewn tight shut
Your stagnant vision prevails

That's when I wanted it to end (coward)
That's when I wished for release (coward)
