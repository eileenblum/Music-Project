[Wound:]
Inching closer
Corrupting my ambition,
Saw your wretched incarnation

[Scorn:]
Growing colder
Retire my frustration,
Turning fire into stone

[Disease:]
Decimation,
Biding time in apathy,
We partake in betrayal 

[Monument:]
Invite destruction
Embrace sweet silence

I bury all
My inner sculpture
I hide all
Narcotic sculpture
