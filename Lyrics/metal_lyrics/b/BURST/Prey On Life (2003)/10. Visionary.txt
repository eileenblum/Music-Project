Please stay awake
Our defining moment struck
The power faithless
Struck

While we were contemplating visions
Visions ran us by
Immortal
Yet decayed
Oh truth, this bitter lie

Though it burns like hell's fire
Scorched are all but us

Did ambition not prevail
While mortal seasons fled?
We seize this carving, 
Here and now
Or the earth shall strike us
Dead

Though it froze like cold destruction
Disarmed are all but us
