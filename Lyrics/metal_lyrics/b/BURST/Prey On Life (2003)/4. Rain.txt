Eyes are bleeding
Scolding heat
Succumbing to the wish-
Not to feel anything at all

Rolling waves of nausea
Seeping through
My mind
Darkest abyss of conscience
Time will swallow
All

Converge upon me
Crushing all I see
Take away my pain
Purifying rain

I am swept away

Skies are gray now
No sun to guide me
The balance of opposites
Through self-annihilation.
