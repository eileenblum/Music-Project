Let the light
Be less annoying 
Don't expose me like this
I won't lose my way again
As long as it's dark enough to see

Welcome blindness, transparency:
No system of harmony
More accurate than this
Welcome bleakness, disconnection: 
No yearning stronger
Than the lust for self-preservation

Let it be only skin deep
Don't expect me to shine
I won't look too deep
As long as it's dark enough to see

Let distractions become illumination
Don't question what you see
I won't toy your patience,
As long as it's dark enough to be

Forgotten, ignored, redundant, adored
Sedated, left instead, or induded, truly dead.
