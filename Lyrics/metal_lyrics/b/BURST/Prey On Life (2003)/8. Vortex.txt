All that I see can conceive 
Your wanton indifference derides 
Decisions weren't hard to deceive
How we fooled ourselves
When it died

Searching for a new place to hide
Afar from your vile, naive complacency
Burning
Scathing
In nausea confide

Mocked in sudden ecstacy

In the earth
As in fire
Fundamental laws I repel
The fool I was, 
Allured by desire
Corroded and hollow you feel.

All and more you could not see
When the frankness would devour
Though the flesh trouble me
And the world tempt me sore;

The victor I was to be
Ascended, your futile ways I deplore.
