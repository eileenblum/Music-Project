I lost this
I surrended this
Carry out the sentence passed
They nurture no more dreams
In acceptance this mute was given
Voice, as he fell from the sky...
And everything was bled into this
Hold me down this time
Killing slave emotion
Letting all pass through
We wed darkness, worship the light
Tragedy woken from slumber
Once again given voice
As it grew out of the earth
Reinvent and pry it open
Spine bare, hollow shell
Kill all slave emotion
Lying, soothing voice
And there is no horizon
No
Horizon
