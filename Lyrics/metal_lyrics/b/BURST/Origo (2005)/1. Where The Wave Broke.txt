Could have carried us farther
Mired only by ourselves
Horizon glowed in morning
Through vile was our resolve
A promise to betray
A betrayal to remember
Where the wave broke
And flushed us back
Back into the sea
Would have brought a haven
Sadness, that bitter failure
Night's embrace was colder
As the stars lit
One by one
A memory rejected
Rejection was the promise
Should have gazed beyond
Ashen clouds that covered
Saw us huddle
Fearing
That bloated bastard sunrise.
