Wing's riding evening breeze
Skies run vast around
We'll find our place there
These Borderlands abound
Strike a path through air
Flapping winds of glory
Below the fires on the moors
We fare and end our story
Haven for the weary
Flight's end summarize
Journey to an end
Rest for broken wings
Ever purging
Time through sand
Adorn me wings of plight
Nesting in the Borderlands
Sting our cherished flight
Connect again
Nothing dies in vain
