Where have we gone?
I find it harder to connect
And I find it farther away from me
Where did you go?
Where have I gone?
I feel my wound is healing poorly
Scar tissue render me frozen
Bitter
Where is it now?
What have I lost?
Give me back my demon
Call me back my demon
I feel the void won't swallow me
Has it been torn from my heart
It takes us so long
Are we waiting for nothing?
Summon back my demon
Sing for me my demon
Foreboding this uprising
A vermin coronation once again
Sever
