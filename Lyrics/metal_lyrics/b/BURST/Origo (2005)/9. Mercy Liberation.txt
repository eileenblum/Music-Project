Hear now what I tell you
Men shall know of this
They shall sleep content
With certainty they'll see
And here's the secret
No hidden logic in the seasons
Dreamer's topic denouncing
All forms of reason
Every lie to a child
Every beating of a promise
Embody all the scourge
Something beautiful to throw away
Let the weight of the centuries bend you
And the light of clarity blind you
I tell you of humanity
It's come to rise unbound
Finally to Earth
Finally born
