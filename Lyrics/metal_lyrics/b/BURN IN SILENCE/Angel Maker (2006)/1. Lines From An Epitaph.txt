I won't lie down today
Won't give in to frustrations
Push myself to insanity
Just for your satisfaction

I won't be used, you can't keep pushing me
The trust I gave to you can never be replaced
You failed in your life

Your actions have been
The cause of your demise
Stop blaming others
You chose your way to die

You've let your secret out
Spread eagle for your fix
Along with all the lies
You spread like a disease
Spewing from the gaping hole
Cancer infected words spoken without remorse
Gives just cause for you to die
Read your lines

Your actions have been
The cause of your demise
Stop blaming others
You chose your way to die

This is your epitaph (You die alone)
