I refuse to rot from the inside
Become a part of what was whole
Corrupting my sense of being and my own self worth
I take back my self control
I always said I never want to live that way
Please let me die, before I stop living
It's through these times I am reborn

You made me what I am today
Through all those lies and deception
I could have lived a thousand lives and never
Felt that kind of pain
But what I lived through
Will empower me until my final days

Through these lies I am reborn
Rebirth

I now rise from the ashes
Of what you thought that you destroyed
With new found conviction and new found self worth
I take back my self control

I always said I never want to live that way
Please let me die, before I stop living
It's through these times I am reborn
This is my time of rebirth
