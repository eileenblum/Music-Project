I'm not
Here to bring my twisted soul into your life
Every moment
Stone eyes view from a requiem
Laughter Echoes
Within these walls I'm forced to live
Shattered memories
Crippled thoughts
About my past (x2)

So sure this was the end
No light has
Been seen
To face a faith which was

Forced upon me as a child
Although I looked at the cross
As something vile and wrong
Cherish the hate built inside
Walk amongst those who shall burn
Burn from their sins
A feeling that drives you to
Awaken and embrace the plague

As it spreads through me it teaches me
To feed on hate
I feed

So sure this was the end
No light has been seen
To face a faith which
All who opposed
To the beliefs that one
Could create all

Laughter Echoes
Within these walls I'm forced to live
Shattered memories
Crippled thoughts
About my past

Forced upon me as a child
Although I looked at the cross
As something vile and wrong
Cherish the hate built inside
Walk amongst those who shall burn
Burn from their sins
A feeling that drives you to
Awaken and embrace the plague

Embrace the plague
That tears apart m mind and soul
Embrace the plague
Which consumes my life
I feed on

I feed on your hate
It's only made me stronger
I feed on your hate
It's made me who I am
