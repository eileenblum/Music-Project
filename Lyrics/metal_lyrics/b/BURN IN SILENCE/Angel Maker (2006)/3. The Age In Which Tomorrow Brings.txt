Fight the blindness of plastic passion
Can't give into the nights of fashion
Lost inside your false intentions
I lift my head and raise my voice to be heard
Now the only way to push through the filth
That surrounds me
Before I get sucked back into the grind
Shredded and put back together
In a nice little package, for all to consume

I see right through you
You're what I despise
The age in which tomorrow
Brings my heart inside to die

Forever wanting to find, another trend to
Follow behind
I know the way to stop you
Will be the way to set us free

I see right through you
You're what I despise
The age in which tomorrow
Brings my heart inside to die

You've shown what you're made of
In just so little time
You've proven how pathetic
It must be to live your life
I can't stand by and watch
You ruin mine
Last time you lied
This time I'll watch you die

But I see right through you
Although you're what I despise
The age in which tomorrow
Brings my heart inside to die
