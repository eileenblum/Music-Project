Eyes in side your mind
That place you hide
Try before you find
It's been done
Before these things were said and done
We swore we'd never falter
But when the hammer falls it destroys
All in it's
Path we chose to walk
Won't be forever
Take a chance and change
Your life, your mind, your
Ways of looking at the world
Could use a second guessing
It's fucking obvious you live in a world of
Regrets of things you've done
Or could have done
Without it seems your ignorance
Could spread like fire
I can't let, that happen
Once would be one time too many

How do I make you go away?
And show the error of your ways

Through complacency and in dignity
You clouded the lines between
Falsehood and honesty
It's not the truth you seek
Through your false modesty
Only your idea of reality
That shapes your perception
Of the say we should live no more
Regrets of things we've done or could have done
Without it seems it's time to open up our minds
You can't stop our rising
This is our time

How do I make you go away?
And show the error of your ways
To prove that nothing's been in vain
I strive to rise above the pain

I rise
Rise above, rise above the pain
