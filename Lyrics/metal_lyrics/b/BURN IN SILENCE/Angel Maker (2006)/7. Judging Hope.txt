When all else fails... it means hope dies
Everybody, look around and be sure what you've done
Can satisfy your empty heart
Without suspicion, a starving man will finish
What he starts
Cause he has nothing left to lose
When all else fails it means hope dies

I'd give anything for you to
Be judged based on your deeds

Judge not lest you be judged
Everybody, look inside and make sure
What you've said
Can be received the way you meant
No hesitation, (I) stand strong behind what
I believe

I see with speculation as to what you are
I will not pass judgment on you
Your apprehension has given me reason not to judge
I will not pass judgment
When all else fails it means hope dies

I'd give anything for you to
Be judged based on your deeds
