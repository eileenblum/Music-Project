Look inside my window
Tell you what I see
One hundred million eyes staring back at me
Do I meet up with your standards?
Did I fuck up their plan?
Will I grow up to be a well adjusted man?

I will not become a shell of who I am
What I make of myself through my own will
I will not adapt to your kind
This my my way, my life

I put up with their bullshit
I swear I won't give up
I've got one more fight left in me
And this time I won't fuck up
I'm not a well adjusted man

Look inside my window
Tell you what I see
Endless sea of eyes
Staring back at me (staring back at me)

I will not become what you want me to be
I will not become you
I will not be what you are
I will not be you
