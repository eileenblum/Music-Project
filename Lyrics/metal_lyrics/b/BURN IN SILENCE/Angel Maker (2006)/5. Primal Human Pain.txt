Primal human pain
It shows me the way
Pure as your first day
Images pass before my eyes
Some hard to see to visualize
Given my state of reality
Sometimes it's best not to believe
Natural design
The fragile nature of my mind
Breaking point dissolved
Here comes the flood (of)
Primal human pain
Spewing from my heart and soul
Taking me away
It takes me away

You don't have to fall into the patterns
Of and everyday
Look behind these mundane walls to a life
As pure as your first day

Reaching out to find what's real
My hopes are gaining strength
Eyes are open to the lies you concealed
The real truths mine to take
Natural design
The evolution of the mind
Pushes me to find
Order in the
Primal human pain
Now that I have overcome
It shows me the way

You don't have to fall into the patterns
Of and everyday
Look behind these mundane walls to a life
As pure as your first day
Primal human pain
It shows me the way
As pure as your first day
