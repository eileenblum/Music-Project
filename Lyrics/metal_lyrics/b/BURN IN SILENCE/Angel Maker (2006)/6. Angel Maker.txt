Everything that has happened
Has led to this moment
Each glance at the clock
Each late night walk
So let me tell you what it's like to
Ride the wave of the earth
When it grabs your heart, body and soul
Feel the wrath and power that it holds

I will make you a goddess and angel
You will be remembered forever
Honor me, the angel maker
I give you your wings

My payment is your life
You are immortal
You serve the army of god
It is my honor
By my hand you die to serve god

I have made you the goddess the angel
You have been remembered forever
Honor me, your angel maker
I give you your wings

When it pushes you past the everyday atrocities
To new heights of mayhem

Everything that has happened
Has led to this moment
Each glance at the clock
Each late night walk
Has led you to me and false security

This is your last chance
I give you your wings!!!!!
Each angel I make gives me strength
Pure energy, white light I will fill
The heavens with angels
I give you your wings
