Slowly walking through the darkened forest,
Wondering how I spawned into this place;
Resignation no option, that's not what I am;
No I'm not escaping, not quitting the game.

And my challenge tonight, is not to die -
Not give my blood to some creatures but walking my way;
No direction, no idea where to go,
But I'm making my path, as I'm cleansing my soul.

Grubbing in my dreams.
Blackness and peace.
Darkened forest.
Must be released (from black creatures).

Grubbing in my dreams.
Blackness and peace.
Darkened forest.
Must be released (from black creatures).
