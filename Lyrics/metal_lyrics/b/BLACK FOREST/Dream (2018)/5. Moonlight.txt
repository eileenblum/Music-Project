I thought I had seen the first rays of light
Yet these woods still oppressive and dark at night
These visions of glowing eyes in the darkness
Make me question my own sanity

I feel as if this forest has a grip on my mind
The lines between dream and reality twined
Like a curse urging me to find,
The place where I can leave all this behind.

But I have to keep wandering,
Struggling through this eternal fight.
In the distance thousands of colors emerge,
Falling from reflections of the moonlight.

The ghostly light of the moon will guide my way out of these woods
Touched by the glistening light I feel the burden on my mind is slowly starting to fade
The dark creatures give way to spirits dancing in the ghostly glow of the moon
I believe the path of my journey keeps on going
The end is not yet in sight

A light shimmering through the forest leaves
So subtle and pale yet with an eerie presence
