Soon is dawn,
The darkened sun rising,
Through the obscured horizon;

Soon is salvation,
The trepidation â fading,
Finally almost gone (is it gone?);

Looking towards end,
The dust â withering.
Blackened are my hands,
Water â requiring.
Freezing my feet,
The coldness â lasting.
Where is the end?
Orientation â losing.

Still some time to dawn,
When the sun will rise (will rise (will rise))

Looking towards end,
The dust â withering.
Blackened are my hands,
Water â requiring.
Freezing my feet,
The coldness â lasting.
Where is the end?
Orientation â losing.

Now it's dawn,
The sun is rising,
Through the brightening horizon,

My fear,
My angst,
Is finally gone (is it gone?)

Looking towards end,
The dust â withering.
Blackened are my hands,
Water â requiring.
Freezing my feet,
The coldness â lasting.
Where is the end?
Orientation â losing.

Now it's time of dawn,
The sun is showing up.

In the end the sun is rising
Through the brightened skyline;
Maybe with some daylight
I can find a path.
