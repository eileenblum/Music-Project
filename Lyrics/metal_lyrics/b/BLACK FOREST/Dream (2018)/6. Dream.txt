[Part I]

I'm on my way into the unknown realms
Of darkness, snow and strange events.
As if this place is not what I've been thinking of,
Not even sure if this ever ends

After all this way I now reached a place,
Of endless joy and discontent,
Bursts of silence sweeping through the forest
Where the river's floating down the land.

From far behind rustling noise between the trees
The moss on the ground turning into black disease
I'm falling through the shadows of earth and in the darkened seas
I turn around, I'm lying on my knees.

As the brightest light is falling down from the skies,
And the slightest breeze turns into deadly storms of ice
The narrow path that keeps me clear is bouncing on both sides.
With an owl on its left and the witch with kaleidoscope eyes.

[Part II]

Torrents rushing down the once so silent land
Demons from the dark crawling through the sand
The witch waddling over, rising up her hand - is that the end?

The lights so dense they're piercing my eye,
My inner body purely rendered empty by
The dark spirit rising up into the sky - will I die?
