The moon is dancing
On the blackened sky
In this frozen land of doom

I will meet the winter here
I feel the endless howling winds

I'm kneeing down
before your might
I'm kneeling down
before your path

Ancient songs of olden gods
Thundering the full moon sky

Oh winter night
Oh, olden gods

Over the cold fog mountains
Thy tower in the mist awaits

The moon is dancing
On the blackened sky
My sword is shining
In moonlight...

I see awaking
Forgotten realms
Centuries from the past
Will rise again...
