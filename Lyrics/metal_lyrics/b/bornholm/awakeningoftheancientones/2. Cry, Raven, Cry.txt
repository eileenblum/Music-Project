Holy fire burns the night,
I hear their last screams,
All the stakes shall burn again,
Cry, raven, cry

I've seen the ravens
Flying by moonlight,
The ancient prayers
Will be chanted again...

I saw the black hordes
Riding from Aquilon
The mountains are bleeding
Cold wind blows far from north

Cry, raven, cry

I hear the lost spirits
Screaming by moonlight
Desecrated ones,
Legion of evil

The wrath of hell
Like thousand ravens
Evil forces rise
Waiting our lord to come

Oh, blackest night,
forever we rule
oh, night of blood,
oh, night of hunger...
