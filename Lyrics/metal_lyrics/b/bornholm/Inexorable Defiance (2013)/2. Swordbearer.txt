To earth I pray and sky
I rove through mountainsides
Blazing the torches fire
Shining and bright, it burns inside

The oak leaves whispered the truth
Lying god arrived
I summon the beast
Under the spell of the moon

Lying god
Murder sheperd from the land of lies
Whore of deserts
I deny

I hold my sword soaked in blood
I drive my hands to the golden halls

Burn fire, on the thrones of heaven
Oh, stakes of might
And you'll have to pay
For the cross of lie
