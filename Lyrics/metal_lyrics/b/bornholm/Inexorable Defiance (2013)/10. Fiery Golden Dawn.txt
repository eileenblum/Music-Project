Be strong like a mountain
Stay still like the sky and the earth
And retain control of power at all times
The sky, the earth and the mountains are unmoved
As unmoved is the world of living beings
And this king of men

There will come a golden dawn
When the fire covers the lands
Wrath will burn in the hearts
Swords will hold all the hands

A new era coming slowly of
Those who know and those who belive
The power of a new middle age is needed
A barbaric purity

Columns of a new era rising
The ancient walls stand again
The will of hierarchy
In the hearts of men

As stars above the mountains
As fires upon the hills we shine

Unleash the fire and the thunder
Release the eagle again
Rising the power of elders
The new dawning of men

Dawn of might and splendor
Ewoke the gods of war
By the fire of burning temples
Pagan way we pray
We pray for war
