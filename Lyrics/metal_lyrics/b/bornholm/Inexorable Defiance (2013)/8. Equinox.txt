Pagan nature wake up now
Grey spirits of highland
Stay here forever and more
Old kingdom's old guardians

Now I will blow the horn
To cover the world in fire
That will burn forever
Burn with the flames of glory

Rise the faith of elders
Die to be born again
Sun and moon are equals
Twilight be my guide

Ignite the shining fire
Hail to the sun of woe
You have to know that
We will never die

We're first in the rage of battles
War guides, blood follows
Reach the stars that shining above
Spill the blood of the gods!

Be the ruler of all empires
Ride the shore that borders the world
Hold your sword and shout as thunder
Equinox has come!

Thus has it ever been
Thus is it now and
Thus shall it always be
