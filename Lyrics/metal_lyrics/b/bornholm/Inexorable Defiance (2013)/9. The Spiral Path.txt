In the shades of unseen
Surfing on the waves of saturn
I breathe the air of tension
And all are concealed beyond

Isolated from far horizons
Awaiting in soundless flight
Light of heathen flames quells me
Buried and consumed by time

The source of hidden knowledge
We seek in dreadful sleep for
Now unlocked in the sphere
We wander far from deep below

Impressed by those who lead
Here we are now, awaken and thrive
A new kingdom is rising
Surrounded by the utter strife

I'm walking down
Down the spiral path

Haunting cries sound written
Beyond purity and torment
Waters of cold are dripping
Unveiling the path to nowhere

Mighty gates of inner kingdom
Built from the force of mind
Leading the spiral path
Where the valkyres fly

Driven into ourselves
We'll turn inward to march
With hunger and hail to
Riding father, wotan
