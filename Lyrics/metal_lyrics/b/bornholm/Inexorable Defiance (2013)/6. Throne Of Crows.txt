Clean my eyes, oh eader of souls
Let me see the gods arise
All the secret beyond the walls
Lead me where the ravens fly

One vision led to another
I feel I travel far
I know the ways of the world
Let my spirit flying high

I see the one-eyed master
Thousand ravens circle his throne
The throne of crows

The future opens wide
Grim battles raging on
Slaugther on the island of woe
Where is the wheel of sun?

Under the forlorn sky
My spirit now returns
Ravens starting to cry
Midnight fire burns
