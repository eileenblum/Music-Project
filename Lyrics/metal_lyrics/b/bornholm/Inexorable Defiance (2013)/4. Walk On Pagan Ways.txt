Like the moon I shine
Like the rain I fall
I sleep like dreaming mountains
I walk on pagan ways

A world of wonders I see
Endless realms of honor
Howling winds I ride
Above mighty cliffs

The shades of dark calling my name
Waiting me to die and fade away

May the light cover reality
May the night create the day

The storm brings the order again
The war brings the fall of realms
Rule your own world, destroy all others
Destroy and become god

I saw my death in my dreams
Rising a world beyond again
The mesmerizing smell of battlefields
Dreams of blood haunting me

I fly towards the halls
The gods waiting for mw
I hail all the idols
I'm rough. I'm pagan

I fight under the runes
The gods warding me
I rule my own kingdom
I walk on pagan ways
