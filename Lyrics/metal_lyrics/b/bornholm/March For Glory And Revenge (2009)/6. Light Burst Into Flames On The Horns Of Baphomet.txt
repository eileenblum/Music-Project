The time passed by
When we met in the light
In the light that He brought
Light without shadow

We're waiting for the sign,
To show the way again,
Idols in the black halls
The halls, where His soul shines
Baphomet

We are our own god,
We have our own god within

Cold was the night when we are gathered
Around the the ancient altars
But my heart was burning temple
My soul was the only God

We felt the power of Thee
His soul shone through ours
Show me the way to the stars,
Let me tear down my flesh

We are the true God,
We are the light
We are our own God
We burn

The time is coming,
I saw in my dreams
We will meet in the light again,
That burst into flames on the horns of Baphomet

I came to this world to slay
The Gods of weakness,
Murder the servants of compassion,
And tear down the walls of the
Forsaken heaven

Save me
