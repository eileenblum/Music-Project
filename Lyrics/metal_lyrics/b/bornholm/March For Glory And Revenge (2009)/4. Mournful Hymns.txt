Fading shadow of time
We will gather again
Die with hope in the heart
Deathwish, thirst for pain

Clouds rise above the land
Proud Wind, blow with rage
The world is under my will
Will to rule, will to conquer

Hear the lamentation of kings
Once they were great,
Once they were ruled
From dismal caves of glorious spells
The worms of time âre eating their flesh

Ashes of thrones cover the land
Ruins of empires, fallen realms
Crying souls break the silence
Mournful hymns through the autumn sky

Faded armor, rusty blades
Once they were knights,
Once they fought
A sound reflecting throughout the graves
Heroes of honour singing

Dark, mournful hymns
