Cold, endless night,
Black wings of Death
Bun all hell's fire,
Burn the slaves of this
Lying, foreign god...

Desperate cry, of the burning
Christians, ancestral prayers
Mingled with their scream
See, you fist fucking Christian god,
When the wolves are tearing
To pieces your herd...

Glowing blades of steel,
Blazing in growing darkness,
Ashes of stakes turn black,
As th blackened blood on my
Sword...

The strong will live, the weak
Must die...
Baptized by fire, crowned by
Own hands...
A king of a new age rises,
An age of death, blood and
Iron...
