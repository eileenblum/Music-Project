Stormy clouds rise
Over the legions of the past,
Blazing northern fire
Beyond the mountains of
Forgotten times

In the blackening sky
The heralds of a new age fly
Holding the eternal flame

Thousands of shining swords,
Conquerors of hell
See their glorious march,
The ashes, the bleeding wounds

Blood and fire flows away
The olden gods were buried by time,
Oh, I remember the graves...

Under the pale grey sky
Circles of stones...
Pagan hordes ride
Through ancient woods

As long as the wind howls hymns,
As long as the ravens fly
Heathen fires will burn
For the forgotten pagan gods...
