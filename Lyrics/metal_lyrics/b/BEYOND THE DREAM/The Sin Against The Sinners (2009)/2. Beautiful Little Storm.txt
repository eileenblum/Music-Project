Firstly i was too blind to see
The burden of power as decease infecting me
Watching the chaos without form
And empty space, the location of the ball

Finally i got something to do

After the five days of creation
There was a time for early form of so called human nature
In paradise under my eyes
`cause soon the playground was ready
Between the sun and the moon

As closed eyes in different lights
Are able to see the shapes you want to see
And the most God did want to see 
Was the shape of the man next to the tree
but he was alone, He is so alone still
There was a time for the next form
Now in my beautiful little storm iÂ´ll breath...

IÂ´ll breath the night away
IÂ´ll breath the life in
Â´cause two will become
One of a kind

IÂ´ll breath the night away
IÂ´ll breath the life in
Â´cause two will become
One of a kind i hope

After the five days of creation
There was a time for early form of so called human nature
God assumed that man will be followed by woman
That would be perfect, that is perfect
Now he got his playground

As closed eyes in different lights
Are able to see the shapes you want to see
And the most God did want to see 
Was the shape of the man next to the tree
but he was alone, He is so alone still
There was a time for the next form
Now in my beautiful little storm iÂ´ll breath...

IÂ´ll breath the night away
IÂ´ll breath the life in
Â´cause two will become one
