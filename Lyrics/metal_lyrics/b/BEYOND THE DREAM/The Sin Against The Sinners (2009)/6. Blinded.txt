Temptation as a sirenÂ´s voice is calling after man
Like a wind blowing among the branches carrying laughter
Of God who made up this test his best weapon against the man
Was the one who used the tongue between the fangs

The fall and the gates were opened
They were blinded and the short visit was ended

I can feel fear on your skin
I am the rain, I am the wind, I am the air

The sin is made
The swansong for the paradise is written
and it is ready to be sang

They were blinded as god made them
And naked as i saw them
Blinded
They were blinded
...So blind

Your hands on the apple, only one step to the sin 
IÂ´m in your mortal soul, once and for all
your thirst, the despair

So weak, she was perfect for me
Her body like a custom-shaped just for me
I was already inside her
When my lies penetrated through that virginal beauty

The sin is made
The swansong for the paradise is written
and it is ready to be sang

Blinded as god made them
And naked as i saw them
Blinded
They were blinded
...So blind

Blinded by the god who made up this test 
Blinded by the god who made up this test
