Welcome, decadence of the earth
Goodbye, the old innocence of the world

Paradise was passed by
The whole place was dry
And we were thirsty for something new, something forbidden
The world outside is so tempting
While illusion of peace is fading
Oh, something forbidden
But the truth was hidden...

In the test of cruelty
He knows that we are weak
Yes you are abandoned, surely
We know that we are free
Free to choose
Free to live
Free to lose
Free to die and so we will
With our own freewill

If youÂ´ll decide not to listen
IÂ´ll decide not to be here anymore

With you iÂ´ll find my peace, i hope 

Even we were building our haven
Our own paradise, safe and sound
Rain kept hitting us down like ravens
Feasting filthy on our rotting bodies screaming the pain out loud... 

They did buy you a present
From gift shop of eden
They did bring you
The freewill as a souvenir

Welcome, decadence of the earth
Goodbye, the old innocence of the world

In the map out of eden
We are holding in our hands
X does not point the land
We are looking for

In the test of cruelty
He knows that we are weak
Yes we are abandoned surely
Free to die and so we will
With our own freewill
