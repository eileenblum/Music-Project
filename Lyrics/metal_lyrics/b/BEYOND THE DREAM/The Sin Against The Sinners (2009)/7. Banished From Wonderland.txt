Please give me something i wanna feel
Give me something real
Creatures in my head seem to take hold on me 

Stuck in the shadows iÂ´m trying to steal the light away from the day
Together we are stonger than enemies on our way
Trying to break us

One mistake
And the cruel decay was accepted
Drunk on each other they swore...

IÂ´ll hold you every night and day
Our love will not fade away...
With a power in thunder and wrath
They were banished from wonderland

Let me know what do you see when youÂ´re alone in the dark
And your demons are coming, do you see me? 
When your demons are coming...do you see me?

Like Lovers, banished from wonderland
Cast out in thunder and wrath

IÂ´m not sure if you trying to kill me 
Or are you just stealing my blood
When i see these bitemarks on my skin
I know i love you
IÂ´m in love with you

Stuck in the shadows iÂ´m trying to steal the light away from the day
Together we are stonger than anyone else
who is trying to break us

When you are alone 
When your demons are coming...do you see me?

One mistake
And the cruel decay was accepted
Drunk on each other they swore...

IÂ´ll hold you every night and day
Our love will not fade away...
