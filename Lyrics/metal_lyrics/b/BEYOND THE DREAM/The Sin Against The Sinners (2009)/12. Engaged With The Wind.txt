one, love
two, hate
three, angel
four, demon
five, paradise
six, six, six

Like they did
Prepair yourselves for the freefall from heaven

They said "we fear the inferno which we are heading to..."
DonÂ´t worry my child, you are much deeper than a hell you know
You are heading to your grace
Your salvation your place of inner peace...

Hatred is engaged with the wind
And itÂ´s blowing all this away
