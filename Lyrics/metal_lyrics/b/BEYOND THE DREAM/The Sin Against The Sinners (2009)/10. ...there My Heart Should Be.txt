Feeble as we are and as we were before
Where the mistake was made
When the apple was eaten by those who did not fight against the evil
donÂ´t be sorry and do not worry

Â´cause the God will paint you out of the picture for sure

Fable is the lie which told i'll try to care about you
To care about who does the right or wrong
His children are dead and their offspring in bed
Did a sin after sin 

Now the god is painting them out of the picture...

In his heart he loved them too much
but was not allowed to touch 
Â´cause he is not part of their world anymore
of his own greatest creation

Buried six feet under there my heart should be 
As he told before cold wind filled his mouth and made him mute

I said iÂ´ll drink that weakness away
Just pour me the blood from your heart

Fable is the lie which told i'll try to care about you
To care about who does the right or wrong

God is painting them out of the picture
Of his own greatest creation

Buried six feet under there my heart should be 
As he told before cold wind filled his mouth and made him mute

...Sweetly buried in six feet under ground
