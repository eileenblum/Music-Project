When spiritless wind blows through the withered Eden poor man stands alone
All the beauty is gone with her love with her smile so fatal but still so adorable

She was his natural born lover
Better half in passion
Hidden and forbidden untainted pearl

Full of secrets, atrocity 
Owns gift to know of the name of higher power
But still stays beside the lower
God had plans for them even they prayed

Right time to break up the first dolls ever made

Her heart a cemetery that carries my name
Her smile a tombstone which remains are the same
As her last cold caress while Eden is filled with nothingness

Now i can see only fading stern of your ship
To moving across the sea, fading as your last bitter kiss
Only fading stern of your ship to moving across the sea

First is gone, the second is coming
Right time to feel love within again
But when she can be the one for me
How long it takes

Her heart a cemetery that carries my name
Her smile a tombstone which remains are the same
As her last cold caress while Eden is filled with nothingness

Now i can see only fading stern of your ship
To moving across the sea, fading as your last bitter kiss
Only fading stern of your ship to moving across the sea

no, no donÂ´t go away
Please, no, no donÂ´t go away
