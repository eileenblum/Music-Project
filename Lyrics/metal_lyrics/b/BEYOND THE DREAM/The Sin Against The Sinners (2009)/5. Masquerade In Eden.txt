In the place where everything is fine
In the place where everything is more than fine
Woman beside man just like it was meant to be
They were not willing to see those eyes
The first shadow in paradise

The place of great hope and glory
At the same time so fragile like a feather
That God can blow away
The place so stunning, so unbroken
At the same time so faint 
Like a GodÂ´s mind Â´cause he let it in...

And it took a form of the snake
No legs no arms only poison for unhealed scars
Now they are carried by you

In the place like the end of the rainbow
The party was about to start
The costumes were nudity, leaves and...

Slimy skin, agile moves, wicked tongue, game for own rules
And two fools who believed the one who will lead them into original sin
Even it was day they were not able to see through itÂ´s perfect costume
See through itÂ´s perfect mask

In the place like the end of the rainbow
The party was about to start
The costumes were nudity, leaves and skin...

Â´cause it took a form of the snake
No legs no arms only poison for unhealed scars

Slimy skin, agile moves, wicked tongue, game for own rules
And two fools who believed the one who will lead them into original sin
Even it was day they were not able to see through...

So get ready for the masquerade in Eden
