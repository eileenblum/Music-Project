I see things in my mind
I can not stop wondering why
I hear things in my head
No forgiveness from god
No regret from me

ItÂ´s dark, still i see you there
This fear that everything is gone
Reminds me on you everywhere
ItÂ´s dark, still i see you there
IÂ´m used, abused and played by god
Who did not listen what we claimed

Is my faith in nothing able to save me
Is my faith in nothing able to lift me higher
...lift me above all this
...while my love to god is dying

Meanwhile the nature is crying
This fear is tearing our souls into pieces
After all i will die, too 
Would you still believe in me
And stay with me when we are not as one no more
Â´cause After all i will die beside my so called god 

I will keep myself busy with picturing our doom
I will keep myself busy with picturing our doom

When we make love with no regret
This world is like burning bed for us 
As the sinners we are
The sinners we are

ItÂ´s dark, still i see you there
IÂ´m used, abused and played by god
Who did not listen

The nature is crying
This fear is tearing our souls into pieces
After all i will die too 
would you still believe in me
And stay with me when we are not as one no more
Â´cause After all i will die beside my so called god 

I will keep myself busy with picturing our doom
I will keep myself busy with picturing our doom
