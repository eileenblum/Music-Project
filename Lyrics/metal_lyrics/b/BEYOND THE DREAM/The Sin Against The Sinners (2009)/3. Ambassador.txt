Through the burning fire with so called desire
To do the right thing and made it for him
With strong wings in flames with mission and claim
For the prize heÂ´ll earn when he has banished her

She lives beside the man in well made land
Under rules of god added to guide them

In a storm he raised angel keeps looking for her
Through the flames he saw her eyes shining like pearls
She is hard to catch, so hard to catch he screamed
And dreamed about awakening from sleep so deep

His burns also too hard to heal
TheyÂ´ll remind him 
His dream was real

Playing hide and seek she took a time away
From the ambassador of God
While he was lost she knew she must kiss the man as soon as she can
Â´cause right after that her destiny will be to face 
The ambassador of God

In the burning fire so lost in desire
To do the right thing and made it for him
Freewill to find her before heÂ´s found her
Still under godÂ´s command Â´cause she knows too much

She lives beside the man in well made land
Under rules of god added to guide them
God whose name she knows

In a storm he raised angel keeps looking for her
Through the flames he saw her eyes shining like pearls
She is hard to catch, so hard to catch he screamed
And dreamed about awakening from sleep so deep

His burns also too hard to heal
TheyÂ´ll remind him 
His dream was real
They are so minimal price
In godÂ´s masterplan

Playing hide and seek she took a time away
From the ambassador of God
While he was lost she knew she must kiss the man as soon as she can
Â´cause right after that her destiny will be to face
The ambassador of God

Playing hide and seek she took a time away
Playing hide and seek she took a time away
From the ambassador of god
