ItÂ´s true i do hold the master key to sinful hearts
TheyÂ´ll replace the juries while saints are locked in
Asylums and penitentaries

When this court is over man will no longer exist 
As a content of this world
`cause i demand - the so called walls 
Between these two worlds are condemned
Just like i recommend before
Just like i recommend before

No time to smile, it is worth nothing
The only right time to cry, it is worth something

You are dismissed so take your leave
Fear and all this will hurt you
A shooting star in godÂ´s greatest failure

Dismiss, say your goodbyes to all this

Fool, feel the sin against you...
The sin against the sinners
Satan and his whores will have their score
When man exists no more
When man exists no more

Now when you are gone
I have no mercy on your soul
A shooting star in godÂ´s greatest failure

You are dismissed, say your goodbyes to all this
Or beg for more, more and more

Fool, feel the sin against you...
The sin against the sinners
Satan and his whores will have their score
When man exists no more
When man exists no more

Fool, feel the sin against you...
The sin against the sinners

The sin against the sinners

The sin against the sinners

When man exists no more

Ever after there is a light
My light, Light that illuminates nothing...
My vision of a new day is rising
And this all will start again...

...And they are standing before the new higher power
Breathing the choking smoke of forthcoming fire wall
