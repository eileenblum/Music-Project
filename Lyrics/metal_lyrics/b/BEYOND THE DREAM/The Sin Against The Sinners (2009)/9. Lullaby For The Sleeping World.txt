I did give them a freewill as an option to choose but what they have done
They have used it so wrong

Now itÂ´s my time to sing my lullaby for this sleeping world
Â´cause this night will last, and i have not forgot the past

IÂ´ll let my shadow grow in front of the sun
And iÂ´ll name, no more, the man and eve as the chosen ones

There is no god
I can tell 
The heaven we believed in is worse than hell
There is no god
No god for us

There is no god
No god for us
