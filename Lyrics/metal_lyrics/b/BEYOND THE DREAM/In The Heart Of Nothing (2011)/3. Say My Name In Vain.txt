donÂ´t remind us
who we are and how do we look
we know the world, thus we all know weeping
our stable yet wayward mood
a pensive leer against a malign cheering

the way sheÂ´ll whine makes me a father of lies
mirrors, took an overdose on our faces
from hidden places weÂ´re crawling...you might hear us shouting
"mirror, mirror on the wall just outblind them all"

come on in...
have a seat and take a drink
i pour you a shot
Â´cause you dared to come in
i welcome you to be by my side
it only needs one thing to be done

please...
say my name in vain make me worthless and plain
oh dear, could you say my name in vain

say my name again
Â´cause iÂ´m worthless and i need this pain

the way you whine makes me a father of lies
just withdraw or dare to see what resides here

there is no need to fear your tears
as you know the world
you know the weeping

come on in...
have a seat and take a drink
i pour you a shot
Â´cause you dared to come in
i welcome you to be by my side
it only needs one thing to be done

please...
say my name in vain make me worthless and plain
oh dear, could you say my name in vain

say my name again
Â´cause iÂ´m worthless and i need this pain

i need this pain

your unstable mood makes your god fear your cheer
your unstable mood makes your god fear your cheer
your unstable mood makes your god fear your cheer
your unstable mood makes me fear your cheer

just come on in...
have a seat and take a drink

come on in...
have a seat and take a drink
i pour you a shot
Â´cause you dared to come in
i welcome you to be by my side
it only needs one thing to be done

please...
say my name in vain make me worthless and plain
oh dear, could you say my name in vain

say my name again
Â´cause iÂ´m worthless and i need this pain

iÂ´m worthless and i need this pain
