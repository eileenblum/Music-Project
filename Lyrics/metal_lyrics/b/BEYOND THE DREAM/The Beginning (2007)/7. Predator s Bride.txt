When I saw your emerald eyes
First time in My life
The sweat filled My own eyes
When I touched You for the first time
Now My heart is beating the rhythm for Your funeral song
The same song was the tune for Your happiness

The song in Your wedding
When hell was above Us
When You said "I do"
When I prayed for forgiveness

This is Me poisoned by the deadly spider
While You're the predator s bride
You use to worship the black side of sky
and tear Our love away from Our sight

I keep on dreaming, hoping, praying without You

I use to put My trust in You
but Your heart was like the wickerman for unholy god
Until today...I saw You hanging from the roof
like an unpainted portrait on a wall
Why You gave Yourself away
Why You gave Your life away

For the love that makes You bleed
Now hell is above Us
You said "I do" I prayed and now I regret

Now...You may kiss the bride.
