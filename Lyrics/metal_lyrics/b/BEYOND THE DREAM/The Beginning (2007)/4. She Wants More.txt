Fear...My body is shaking
My head is aching
My tears are falling
Shame...My mind is collapsing
She was My score

I'm in this weird place
I know I'm so unsafe
They keep on asking for so much more
I think I've been there before

After absinthe
My mind was blank
Now My heart is colder than winter
...Flashback

I was there between the Adam and Eve
I was third wheel in the garden of Eden
I was the snake in Paradise
I was the reason for lust in Eve's eyes

'Cause She wants more
And I knew She wants more

Tears...Are falling from My eyes
They will undress My ice-cold disguise

They'll uncover My heart
2000 years are far away from the time
when Our kiss became a scar (of mankind)

I'm in this weird place
I know I'm safe
but They keep on asking for So much more
They know I'm here...On and on

After absinthe My mind was blank
That makes Me shift through this all
...All once more

'Cause I was there...
Lies are easy to bear
'cause I was there.
