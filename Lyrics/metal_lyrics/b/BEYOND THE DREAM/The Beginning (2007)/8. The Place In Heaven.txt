I remember those days
and the holy serenades and Your golden age
When those fools believed
that Your light can cover the shadows of night
but one weak mind in the fear so blind
The truth was hard to find
That blind trust became the kiss of a betrayal

He is searching the truth forever
The place in heaven or palace in hell
After sundown He and noose together
far away from the place in heaven

You say "I don t believe what I see"
But there is no one else who I can be
Cause there is so much to do with His reasons
To be somebody else and see You have to disagree with life
and survive those four different seasons

On and on...year by year...
on and on...tear by tear...

The looking glass tells
the beauty is just an illusion
When You'll face the truth You will cry
The same tears that I've cried

I'm in Your mind to stop His second coming
That will raise Me to the top
And when You stop loving
the golden gate is sealed up

I remember those days and the separated ways
Where You walked with Your people
and I m sure I was not alone
When I felt the heat
the great burning of Rome...

It's His truth forever
His place in heaven or palace in hell
After sundown His town together with flames
far away from the place in heaven.
