No life, no grief, no more pain inside
The war between the truth and false
I felt in your words you said beneath the stars
Addiction like malediction, of superstition
In my dark, black and magical way to view the world
In my black and magical way to view the world!
Living in the lie is like playing the game when the die is cast
At last, I am dancing on the razors edge.

My bare feet on the blade
They are bleeding red rivers
When there is no one to hail my name
It will send me down again
My bare feet on the blade
They are bleeding red rivers
When there is no one to hail my name
I will go down, in flames!

No life, no grief, no more pain inside
The war between the truth and false, I felt in your words
My addiction caused by your malediction
Makes me superstitious again.

My bare feet on the blade
They are bleeding red rivers
When there is no one to hail my name
It will send me down again
My bare feet on the blade
They are bleeding red rivers
When there is no one to hail my name
I will go down, in flames!
- I will go down in flames!!!
