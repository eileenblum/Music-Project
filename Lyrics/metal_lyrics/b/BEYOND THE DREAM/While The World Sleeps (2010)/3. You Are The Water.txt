This is my world, the world is me
You will deny it, before you see, I'll make you weep
When naive laughter turns into funereal crying in fear
I am smiling, there's nobody to wipe away your tears
How to confess your sins in the end when death wins?

Whispers form silent lies dreaded like the devil's eyes
Before your blood stains the sky tonight
I'll slay myself to know...
When I'm slain I'll know what is right!

If we'll throw away these rings, will it end this suffering?
You said every breath I take is sin
Remember, there's no god
Remember, you can not win.
I bring no shelter for your altar when the sky will burn!
In flames I am free, so share with, me this moment
Last we'll have, learn to breath the smoke or choke
This flame still burns even if you are the water
This moment, last we'll have
Learn to breath the smoke or choke
This flame still burns even if you are the water...
- You are the water!

Under ravishing skin, there's a flesh
Thirsty for sin, no need to say who's gonna win
Rejected, there's no god
Rejected, I will not bring...
The shelter for flames
I will not say in vain the names
I don't want to hail
When naive laughter turns into funereal crying in fear
I am smilingâ¦there's nobody to wipe away your tears
The sky will burn before you see it!
Share with me this moment, last we'll have
Learn to breath the smoke or choke
This flame still burns even if you are the water
This moment, last we'll have
Learn to breath the smoke or choke
This flame still burns even if you are the water!
