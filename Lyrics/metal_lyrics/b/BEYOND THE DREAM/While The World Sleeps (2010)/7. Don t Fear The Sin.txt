It's like disease infecting your mind
It's like maggots eating you alive
It's like undertaker setting you into rest
It's like direction which is always the best
It's an answer, a seducing dancer
It's hard to resist, I know you can't resist.
In this season it's hot, it's in
Oh baby please don't fear the sin
There's no way, out of this!
So enjoy and slit the useless skin to feel this pleasure
Enjoy and join this needful sin to feel this pain
This pain ain't just suffering!

(it roars the words of loveâ¦ it whispers softly the poems of hate)

This pain ain't just suffering, listen to the wind
It's lips are moving, love and hate, somewhere there between
The fictive apple you can reach, takes you closer to me
- I am the sin!
Just suffered loss, former you is lost
Blind eyes can't see, insentient can not feel
So peel yourself, let the addle matter run out from within...
Don't fear the sin
It's like denying the meaning of life
Your fear, brings their god alive!
Don't fear the sin
It's like denying the meaning of life
Your fear, brings their god alive!
- It's like denying the meaning of life!

I want to be the kiss you can't forget
I want to be the bliss before abomination
Regret is my other name
Name you are not familiar with
I want to be a wound on your wrist
The door for the way you can't resist
Forgiveness, my actual fame
Shame you are not, familiar with me
I want to be the fact in your mind, the fiction
The alternative ending for your creation
You wretch, you can't resist, me!

I am the sin!
Just suffered loss, former you is lost
Blind eyes can't see, insentient can not feel
So peel yourself, let the addle matter run out from within!

Don't fear the sin!
It is like denying the meaning of life
Your fear brings their god alive!
Don't fear the sin!
It is like denying the meaning of life
Your fear brings their god alive!
