Night, the time for me to be the creature they are not willing to seeâ¦
I'm still breathing even if this feeling is so suffocating
When all is gone being here feels so unreal
Surreal dreams, in them all I see feels so distant to me
All hope is long gone before I was even... born...
Long gone before me...

Night, my sign, to wake up from this coffin wherein I was sleeping like a child
There innocence was surrounding me
As a lost one, without direction or salvation, fact is a fiction in my life
I'll be fine without your lies or the pity for this poor, soul.

Those eyes in the mirror they are not mine
They are opened, mine are closed
Am I awake or is this, just another night, another night-mare
Another burden to bear...
[I won't] change my lies or the truth
Or sacrifice all, this for you
Cause us two are the same as they who
Were in the garden of fools
Blindly in love who tried to be above god
Their love was just a proof of their weakness...
The legacy they did give us I'll give up
Here's my soul ready to be taken away
Don't mind am I asleep or am I awake...
...'cause I'm still breathingâ¦

Night, my sign, to wake up from this coffin wherein I was sleeping like a child
There innocence was surrounding me
Tell me, am I awake or is this, just another night
Another nightmare, another burden to bear.

I won't change my lies or the truth
Or sacrifice all, this for you
Cause us two are the same as they who
Were in the garden of fools
Blindly in love who tried to be above god
Their love was just a proof of their weakness...
The legacy they did give us, I'll give up
Here's my soul, ready to be taken away
Don't mind, am I asleep or am I awake.
