That is not fear in my eyes
I just, want to see love tonight...
Love, safe from the world
Love, saved &amp; buried
I remember them, I once knew
Two became one, their journey was just began
On the path I would never find, but I could find them
At the end of the path, I will never find...
Here I'm standing bravely above them
Mud on my hands, I am, almost there
Here I'm standing bravely, above them
With a thousand roses I did bring.

Watching proudly, they're embracing before me
Sweetly rotting lovers on the withering flowers
Man who's used, abused and without the Muse
Feels himself, finally fulfilled.
Watching proudly, now they are embracing before me
Maybe I won't leave them, maybe I will keep them.
Maybe I will never lay them into rest again
Disdain was mine while walking thin line and when
The line ends or bends my way into dark - I'll be the perfect mark!
For them who'll travel my steps into depths, here's no room for tears
But I was weak, I was weak and I wept.
Here I standing bravely, above them
Mud on my hands, I am, almost there
Here I standing bravely, above them
Blood on my hands, the same color as the, roses I did bring.

Watching their bodies, rotting slowly from inside
The expiration dates of them has been long time ago passed by
Still this is the only thing I want to remember!

Watching proudly, they're embracing before me
Sweetly rotting lovers on the withering flowers
Man who's used, abused and without the Muse
Feels himself, finally fulfilled...
Watching proudly, now they are embracing before me
Maybe I won't leave them, maybe I will keep them.
Maybe I will never lay them into rest again
Disdain was mine, while walking thin line and when
The line ends or bends my way into dark - I'll be the perfect mark
For them who'll travel my steps into depths here's no room for tears
But I was weak, I was weak and I wept...
