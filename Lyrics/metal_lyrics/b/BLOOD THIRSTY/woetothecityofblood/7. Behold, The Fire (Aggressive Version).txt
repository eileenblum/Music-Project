Like a thief, the Great Day is near
Deafening roar, the heavens disappear

Conflagration, the elements destroyed
Earth is stripped, completely life-devoid

Behold, the fire

Great will be the destruction
But God keeps His word
A place where righteousness dwells
A new Heaven and new Earth

Since creation, life will persist
But by His word, the heavens and earth exist

He's patient with you, His promise not delayed
Not wanting anyone to perish, repent and be saved
