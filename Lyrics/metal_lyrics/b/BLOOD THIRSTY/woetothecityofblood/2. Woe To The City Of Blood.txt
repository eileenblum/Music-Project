Woe to the city of blood
Where murder rushes in like a flood
Completely full of pillage and lies
Where prey never escape alive

The cracking of the whip
The rattling of the wheel
Galloping horses, blood on steel
Horsemen charging forward
Swords flashing, spears gleaming
Slain bodies, steaming
A mass of corpses, endless in sight
Horsemen stumble over the lifeless
Destroyed with overwhelming might

Because of the many acts of prostitution
Nineveh brought destruction on herself
Charming and well-favored one
The one who betrays nations and families, the mistress of sorceries

I will throw filth on you
Make you vile and treat you with contempt
You shall become a spectacle

You too Nineveh
Will become drunk with the cup of Godâs wrath
You too Nineveh
Will search in vain for a rescue from the enemy

Your fortresses are nothing
Your people are weak
The gates of your land are opened wide
The fire will devour you

Multiply yourself like the creeping locust
Multiply yourself like the ones that swarm

Your shepherds are asleep
Your nobles are lying down in death
Your people are scattered on the mountains
And there is no one to gather them

There is no relief or healing in sight for you
Incurable is your wound
All who hear the news
Rejoice at your demise
[Nahum 3]
