Surrounded by principalities and powers
Entrenched deep in desert lands
Wickedness resides in supernatural realms [Ephesias 6:12]
Sifting lives like the falling sands [Luke 22:31]

Ideological displeasure
Hatred of Christ is manifest
I refuse to renounce my God
Behold, my faithâs final test

Prepare the blades
Herded to the shore
Revealed to eyes of the world
This shell will soon be no more

Surrounded by principalities and powers
Entrenched deep in desert lands
Wickedness resides in supernatural realms [Ephesias 6:12]
Sifting lives like the falling sands [Luke 22:31]

Ocular disparagement
Execution imminent
Line us up one by one
Forced to my knees, I cannot run

I cease not speaking Yeshuaâs name
The name by which salvation comes
No other name is given under the heavenly realms
And there is salvation in no one else [Acts 4:12]

Extremist militant mind
I feel the cold edge of the blade as itâs pressed to my flesh
Starting to slice
The edge of the tool is beginning to cut through my neck
The spurting of blood
Lacerating the skin revealing the organs within
Off with my head
Itâs held in the air as my body descends to the ground

Behold, the scroll
The fifth seal will break and then you will see me among the saints
Under the Altar of Souls
With those who were murdered and slaughtered because of the Word
Of my God
And because of the word that they kept of the testimony
Holy and true
The Lord will avenge all the blood that you shed with my fellow brethren [Revelation 6:9-11]

He is Lord
He is God
Almighty
For all time [Hebrews 13:8]
