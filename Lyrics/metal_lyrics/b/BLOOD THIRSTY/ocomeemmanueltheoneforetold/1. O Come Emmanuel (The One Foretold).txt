[CHILD:]
O come, O come, Emmanuel and ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appears
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel shall come to thee O Israel

[MAGI:]
Traversing westward from afar
We beheld the rising of the star
Tell us where the child was born
The One foretold
Crown to be worn

[HEROD:]
Priests and teachers, come draw near
Greatly disturbing, this prophecy here
That out of Bethlehem, birth foretold
But I am the king, itâs mine to uphold!
To be dethroned is what I fear
Call the Magi, bring them here
With my command, you are beguiled
Search ye carefully for this child

[MAGI:]
We have finally found the one
The Son of God
His will be done
Treasures to the child we bring
Glory to the newborn King

[NARRATOR:]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[ANGEL 1:]
To the Magi I speak of impending conspirant
Return to your land, avoiding the tyrant

[HEROD:]
Slaughter the children, two years and under
Weeping and mourning, hearts torn asunder

[ANGEL 1:]
Joseph arise, take the child and Mary
To Egypt you go and do not tarry

[HEROD:]
This kingdom is mine, spare not one breath
If itâs the last thing I do, Iâll go to my death

[ANGEL 1:]
Joseph, get up! The reason you fled
The ones who were killing have now become dead
Of Herod I speak, the tyrantâs deceased
With your family, itâs time to go East

[NARRATOR:]
Upon the learning of Herodâs descent
Back to the land of Israel they went
But when Herodâs son reigned in his stead
The family went forth to Nazareth instead
Thus fulfilling words what prophets foreseen
That the Christ would be called a Nazarene

[ANGELS:]
O come, O come, Emmanuel and ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here until the Son of God appears
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel has come to thee O Israel
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine
