Hear the roar of a thousand thunders' cry 
As blinding flashes streak across the sky 

Cyclone of death is bearing down on you 
Its mighty wind ripping flesh, creating a crimson hue 

Jesus Christ provides the way out 
Call on His name in your hour of need 
Even wind and waves obey His command 
He alone has the power to set you free 

Feel the waves crushing, pulling you under 
Things once held precious are now torn asunder 

Feel the fury subside 
The weight of the storm is lifted 
Holy Spirit gives peace inside 
Rebuke the wind and waves 
The tide has shifted 

Storms in life will come 
They continue to rage on and on 
Don't be at the mercy of the storm 
Make the storm be at your mercy
