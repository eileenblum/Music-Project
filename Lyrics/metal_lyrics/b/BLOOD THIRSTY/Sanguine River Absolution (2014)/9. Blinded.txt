The world wants constant compromise 

Everything this world has to offer 
Lust, envy and pride 
It comes not from the Father 
Lay them aside 

Remove the blinders from your eyes 
The world wants constant compromise 
Jesus Christ, the one despised 

The world and its desires pass away 
Distractions will come to lead you astray 
Be strong in the Lord, stay focused on His way 
Fall to your knees and pray 

The reason we can't see the Bridegroom's face 
Is because we're too busy looking at other lovers 

Whatever you do in word or deed 
Do it in the name of the one who set you free 

Remove the blinders from your eyes
