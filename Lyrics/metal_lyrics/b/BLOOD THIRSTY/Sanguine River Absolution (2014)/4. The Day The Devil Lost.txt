Selfish nature takes hold 
No longer to abide 
Jealousy-fueled desire consumes 
Becoming enraptured in pride 

Disgust 
Inflamed with repulsion 
Wanton ascension 
Resulting in expulsion 

Legions of angels 
Answer the battle call 
Beauty doused in blood 
Like lightning from Heaven he falls 

The day the devil lost 

Part of Heaven 
Enters unholy alliance 
And so their fate is sealed 
Consuming fire for their defiance 

Wage war 
Burning hatred made known 
Obsession 
To rise above God's throne 

Prowl around 
Frantic 
Seeking to devour 
He knows it's the final hour 

Satanic eradication is nigh
