Where will you go when you run from God? 
What place can you find? 
He is all-seeing and all-knowing 
Searching the heart and mind 

Intelligence beyond human comprehension 
Bring forth compassion, eternal life-extension 

Encompassing consciousness 

Word was made flesh 
Jesus Christ, the only begotten Scion of One 
Brings forth compassion 
Eternal life through the Son 

The universe expands by the breath of His word 
Majestic Creator, not of this world
