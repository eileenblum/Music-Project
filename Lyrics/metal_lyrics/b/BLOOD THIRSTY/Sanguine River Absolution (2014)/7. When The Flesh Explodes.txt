Those who live according to the flesh 
Have their minds set on what flesh desires 
The mind led by the flesh is decease 
Those who live according to the Spirit 
Have their minds set on what the Spirit desires 
The mind led by the Spirit is life and peace 

The mind governed by the flesh 
Is hostile toward the Most High 
It's time to tear off the ways of dark 
And become the children of El Shaddai 

The flesh desires what is contrary to Spirit 
Mind depraved, inflamed by self 
Those who walk by the flesh reap fatality 
Spirit desires what is contrary to flesh 
Soul is saved, embraced by life eternal 
Those who walk by the Spirit reap immortality 

When the flesh explodes 
Open your eyes to see 
Embrace the new life 
You have been set free
