Don't run from the chaos, stand still 
Let the chaos run from you, don't fear it 
We have power to conquer the enemy 
Through the Holy Spirit 

The chaos of the time creates the conqueror in you 

Confusion ascends, creates disorder 
That which is set up by spirits of deceit 
Untruths spoken, lives are shattered 
Resulting in mental defeat 

Brethren, rise up 
To slaughter the discord 
Angelic beings surround us 
As we utter the Holy Word 
We can do all things through Christ 
Who strengthens us 
God has not given us the spirit of fear 
But of power, love, and a sound mind
