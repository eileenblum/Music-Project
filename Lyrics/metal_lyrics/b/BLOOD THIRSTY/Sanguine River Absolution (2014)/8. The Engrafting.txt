Behold the mighty tree of old 
Whose engrafted branches will take hold 
Veins pumping the blood of freedom 
To all who would receive its wisdom 

Ancient abode of infinite sustenance 
The rich sap flows over in abundance 
Its embrace extends to rescue the soul 
To be grafted in and be made whole 

When unbelief thrives, limbs are broken 
Others are grafted in, confession of faith is spoken 
Spiritual insight with time grows slowly 
If the root is holy, the branches are holy 

Call out to Him for your every need 
A severed limb can be grafted in again 
God doesn't cut you to watch you bleed 
God cuts you to graft you in 

Join the eternal forest
