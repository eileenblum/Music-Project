Struggle not against flesh and blood in these last hours 
But against the rulers, authorities, and dark powers 
Against spiritual forces of evil in realms unseen 
Distorting the truth for lies, ways of the obscene 

The weapons that we wield are not of this physical realm 
They have divine power to tear the strongholds down 
With arrows of fire, the demons take aim 
On earth as in Heaven, be bound in Jesus' name 

Stand against the devil, put on the full armor of God 
Belt of truth, breastplate of righteousness, feet are shod 
Take up the shield of faith and helmet of salvation 
Brandish the sword of the Spirit, evil exsanguination 

Thirsty for the blood of Christ to wash away our sin 
The sanguine river absolution 
We submerge our shells of flesh deep within the flood 
And rise to overcome the world through His cleansing blood 

In His mighty power, we are strong in the Lord 
Dismantling the deceptions as we speak His Word 

Prepare for the slaughter
