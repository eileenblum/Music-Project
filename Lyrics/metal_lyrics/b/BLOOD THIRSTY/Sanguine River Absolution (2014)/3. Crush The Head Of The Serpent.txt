Cursed ancient one, you slithering snake 
Trails in the sand and dirt you will make 
Eat the dust, your sustenance made 
For your deception, the price you've paid 
The age-old falsehood, by lies to ensnare 
With forked tongue tasting the air 

Precision strike, the venom inject 
Years of mendacity, ways to infect 
Equivocation, untruths are told 
Beguiling the masses, a concept of old 
Jealousy to God, your plan of condemnation 
Entice humankind with multitude temptation 

Your crafty ways, the plan to deceive 
That day in the Garden when spoken to Eve 

Jesus took it all, the Lamb who was slain 
His payment on the cross, body wracked with pain 
Death could not hold Him, divine resurrection 
Took the keys of death &amp; hell, sin disconnection 
Doomed to destruction, your fate has been sealed 
When Christ returns, His glory revealed 

Crush the head of the serpent 

Lucifer, you better run! Run! 
He's coming! He's coming! 
It is finished!
