Possessed by many spirits, he dwells among the tombs 
Breaking through the chains, the wicked nature fumes 
Seeing Nazarene, he fell down at His feet 
"Son of the Most High God, what do you want with me?" 

"Spirit of impurity, depart from this man!" 

Jesus asked the spirit, "What is your name?" 
"My name is Legion, for we are many" 
Viewing herd of swine, the pathetic spirit begs 
"If you drive us out, send us to the pigs!" 

"Go! Into the herd! Go!" 

The spirits exit the man 
Possess the swine on the hill 
The whole herd rushed down the steep bank 
Two thousand to their death, drowning in the lake 

The man, set free 
Break the chains 

Demons burn with fear, they are scared to death 
So give the glory to God, the One who gave you breath
