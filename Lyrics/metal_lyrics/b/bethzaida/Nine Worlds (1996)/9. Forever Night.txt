Pray for darkness, pray for the world below
Pray for winter, pray for forever snow
Pray for the sun never to rise above the hills
in the horizon far away, far away

Forever night
Ah... Forever night!

Pray for sorrow, pray for melancholy
Pray for sadness, happiness will never be
And at night, we'll walk together, you and I
And pray for your soul not to perish in the darkest of nights

Chant of the Witch:
"Spirits whispering in the darkness
Shadows dancing in the night
Fear the demons, ever present
Run in panic, scream in fright"
