Divine intervention is only a dream
You give up your lives and follow the stream
I saw the prophet, preaching his lies
I heard him beg for mercy the moment he died
Under many moons I looked for you
Under many names I sought for you
I never found you, it's a minor loss
I denied, saw you die upon the cross

Dividement... The Dividement

Thousands of years they've been preaching your lie
Giving people a reason to die
And on my death-bed, I do not complain
Because you were a servant of darkness, which held you enslaved
A smile on my lips, now pass on
Bring on your heritage, like father like son
A testimony of the evil of man
And in my eternal sleep I will never see your face again
