Creeping upon my soul, the disease was blinding me
The vulture's shadow was out of reach
The carcass of hope I could not see

My spirit trapped by midnight, deeper down it sank
I gasped at the land of shadows
At last in death I found my rank

Nine worlds below Nivlhel I went
That is where the dead of Hel's domain are sent

In a dream I saw a dark figure, a black cloak was hiding her face
My empty eyes stared insane with fright
By death would I now be embraced

I thought I had found a sanctuary, could a mind so empty go insane?
But one fear trod on the heels of another
I was dying again and again
