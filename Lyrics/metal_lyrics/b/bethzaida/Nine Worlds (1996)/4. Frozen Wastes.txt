I will see hope as a loved one you seek
I will see ice made of tears on your cheek
I will see darkness trapped beneath the sky
I will see melancholy as you cry

I will hear wolves howl in the night
I will hear beasts wail in fright
I will hear elegies hurting the ear
I will hear men whisper "Winter is here"

I will feel cold as I walk through the mist
I will feel pain in my frost-bitten fist
I will feel sorrow as snow-covered I lie
I will feel comfort as with you I fly

Frozen lands...
Frozen wastes...
