Carpathian dream, bloodthirsty beast
Preying on man, every drop of blood a feast
A wraith in the night calls your name
At the mountain top burns the eternal flame

And from the flames they will come
Seven times seven
Vengeance of the ancient ones
Defier of heaven

Dreams of the living shall be no more
The dead shall rule this rotting world
Demons returning from the other side
Heaven is burning, there will be no more light

And from the flames they will come
A memory of the evil ones
To once again walk the earth
Arcane horror set to birth
