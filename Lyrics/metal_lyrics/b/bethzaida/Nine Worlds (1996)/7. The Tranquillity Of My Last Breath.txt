Darkness now surrounding me
I gaze into eternity
A burden I had to endure
For a heart that was unpure
A feeling of tranquillity
At last my soul would be set free
But the last thought in my mind
A memory of faded crimes

The wrath of darkness in your eyes
I see it as I cry
A wicked laughter, betraying smile
I knew my life to be a lie

Night I am awaiting thee
Soon I will cease to be
A life so long, a life of pain
An evil side I could not tame
A feeling of tranquillity
At last my soul would be set free
Regretting now but it's too late
I step forth to meet my fate

[Plea of the dying:]
"I see your hand, a palm so white
I dream of day, here's forever night
I know that I will never see
The realms beyond, they are not for me"
