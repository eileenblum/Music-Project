A death's shadow resting over me
I longed day after day to be set free

And then I turned towards darkness

Never again will I let your will restrict me
Darkness where I belong, now at last I can see

And then I turned towards darkness

I live my life to destroy the world you built
Dream of 2000 years never to be fulfilled

And then I turned towards darkness
