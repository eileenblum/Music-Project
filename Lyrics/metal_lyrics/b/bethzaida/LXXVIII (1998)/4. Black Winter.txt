I used to miss the cold winter-nights back then
I waited for the day to pass so you would come again
Remember how I fed you (those memories do stain)
I always gave you more even though nothing did remain

My world is black
Black fire burns the night
I greet the darkness
With wide open eyes

Cover me white, cold winter sky
Cover me white as I take off and fly
Cover me with your ice cold tears
Near you I possess no fear

I used to cry myself to sleep those nights so long ago
Both day and night I longed for you, I never could let go
But recently I realised that you were on your way
As frost did spread across the ground I knew you'd come to stay

One last time I kiss the frozen ground
I wave goodbye to my fallen gown

Winter, winter... at last you have come to set my soul free
Black I was forever and will forever be
Embrace me, I will touch you, the wind my elegy
The children of the Great winter are mourning constantly
