See the leaves wither, see the flowers die
As animals seek shelter, as birds towards south do fly

Forever my farewell is, forever will I depart
Forever my soul remains black, forever remains my heart

I do not hope for remedy, I lost all hope on my way
And all I ever wished for was to find love where I stayed

And all the blood was spilled, how many tears were shed
As darkness falls upon the sky these thoughts return to my head

Autumn... I welcome you home
Waiting so long, always alone
Autumn... the cold of the sky
Now at last to die

I do not attach importance to sunshine any more
Or sparkling fountains that the youth is so fond of
I love darkness and the shadows of the night
Here I can be alone with my thoughts and my emotions

I do not ask forgiveness, my sins are far too great
I walked the streets of Babylon, I always turned up late

I do not claim to be guilty, guilt does not suffice
Wherever I brought hell, I took away your paradise

See the leaves wither, see the flowers die
As animals seek shelter, as birds towards south do fly

Forever my farewell is, forever will I depart
Forever my soul remains black, forever remains my heart

Autumn... at last you have come
Never again will I see the sun
Closing my eyes, for one last time
I kiss you and whisper "goodbye"
