Once so mighty I was aeons ago
I would make thunder roar and lava flow
Times do pass, moments do wither and fade
Man do forget the memories of my glorious days

Forever to live in purgatory's darkness
Blend in with the low-life among this putrid mess
Some praise my name, they do not know
I changed it millennia ago

Pestillence will spread across Earth
Death to the first set to birth
Snow-covered the ground shall remain
As yet another life I do reclaim

Fire from the ground to the sky
No place to hide, nowhere in safety to lie
Expelled again, myself to blame
Now I am never to return from whence I came
