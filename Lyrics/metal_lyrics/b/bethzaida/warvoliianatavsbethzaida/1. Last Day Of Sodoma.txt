I offered you my world to have, my kingdom to explore
I gave you warmth and shelter against the raging snow
My dark love was rejected, too bad you could not see
That love lasts eternally and we were ment to be

Your tears cannot move me, I am delighted by your cries
As blood runs down from your chest, I am smiling as you die
Though my eyes are red and wet, this is my greatest thrill
If I cannot have you then no-one ever will

I welcome you home one last time
To greet you goodbye with a knife in my hand

Steel so sharp against tender flesh
River of blood flowing down her chest
Metal blade carving up her skin
As one life ends a new one begins

Anger of Cain raging in my head
Again and again, she is soon to be dead
Tears in her eyes, I hope she can hear
my "goodbye, you have nothing to fear"
