Time hangs in a lazy noose, a medicated haze 
A waltz through your alchemy, in a cosmic juggernaut 

Heavy eyelids, drop on down, rivers of drool 
A school of galaxies pass, holy assassin holds the mass 

The old monk on the run, he scrams 
Violent rhythm, a dead romance 
Smoking Hookahs, paint the sky 
Nocturnal assassins in a trance 

Your dreams and your nightmares, will light the sky 
A carpet, your life floats by, holy smoke in your mind 

Sleep until tomorrow, on borrowed time 
Sleep until tomorrow, The Universal Sleeper grinds 

The song and dance will wind down 
With the tick-tock of time 
Heavy eyelids let you in 
Another light of your pipe 
Leave the scum to the earth 
Take the flight of rebirth 
Sleep forever, sleep 

Sleep until tomorrow, on borrowed time 
Sleep until tomorrow, The Universal Sleeper grinds
