With the sun going down 
With the night creeping in 
Watch where you go 
The steelâs still cold 

Pint-sized immortal 
Stalks the damp alleyways 
Beer, chicks and bong hits 
The party meets a bloody end 

Creepy, crawly, snarly and small 
Oi, Abishtu 
Care to meet him after dark? 
Oi, Abishtu 

Innocent blood streaks off his face 
He rides the west coast, sea breeze laced 
Another town, another few kills 
No remorse for the blood he spills 

The sirens pierce the still of the night 
Gunshots racing faster than the bike 
The khaki finally catches up with him 
Only to find another victim 

Creepy, crawly, snarly and small 
Oi, Abishtu 
Care to meet him after dark? 
Oi, Abishtu 

As old as time itself 
He still lurks the depths, evil intent 
âBlood must flow for I am still hereâ 
His booming voice resonates still 

His ride shines in crimson red 
Chrome wizard, runs on the blood he spills 
Thundering down towards the sea 
He melts away, will never leave you be 

Creepy, crawly, snarly and small 
Oi, Abishtu 
Care to meet him after dark? 
Oi, Abishtu
