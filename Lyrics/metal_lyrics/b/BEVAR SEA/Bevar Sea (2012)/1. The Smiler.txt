A silent flick of a serpentâs tongue 
Shut the light, hereâs the opium lung 
The pale blue haze of a beetleâs eye 
Turn on the night with a phat smile 

The smiler watches certainly 
The hero of the hourglass dream 
The smiler cries, you leave 
The hero of the hourglass dream 

A poisonous tale of a dream unknown 
Turn loose the swans, the truth be told 
A wizardâs eye that has no gleam 
The mist of the midnight rolls by me 

The smiler watches certainly 
The hero of the hourglass dream 
The smiler cries, you leave 
The hero of the hourglass dream 

When he's done 
He plays tricks on you 
Can't you hear him come? 
He'll put a smile through you 

Cheek to cheek 
That toothless grin 
He'll walk away 
You'd better turn on that smile 
Again 

The smiler watches certainly 
The hero of the hourglass dream 
The smiler cries, you leave 
The hero of the hourglass dream
