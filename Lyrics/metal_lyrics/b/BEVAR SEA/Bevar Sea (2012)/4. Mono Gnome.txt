The Gnome tries talking to his head 
What does it tell him about him, about himself 
Do you want to be insane still? 
Whatever I do, my head, I do it for the thrill 

Do it for the thrill 
A bit of a spill 
Got to walk for the kill 
Do it for the thrill 

The Gnome's knife is stained with his blood 
A nasty glare, waiting on his prey to come 
His need to ride the Devil's woman 
Whatever he does, my friend, he does it for the thrill 

Do it for the thrill 
A bit of a spill 
Got to walk for the kill 
Do it for the thrill 

Come with me to the mountain top 
Let me show you the dreams we've bound 
The lady atop here, wishes you were here 
The Devil's mistress, she lays bare 

For in the shadows there are lies 
The mistress rides, she rides the Gnome hard 
They set the world on fire 
The Mono Gnome he crawls
