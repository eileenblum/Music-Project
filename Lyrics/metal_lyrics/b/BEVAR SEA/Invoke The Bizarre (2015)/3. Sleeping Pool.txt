Look around the Mirrorland
Possibilities seem offhand
Somewhere in the depths of minds
The universal paradox declines
Reaching for the endless goal
Robots walk the hyperbole
Union of mechanic wholes
Creates the Sleeper
The men with no soul

Sleeping Pool
The waking is here
Sleeping Pool
The dead lay clear

Crying through space and time
He grows to be one of a kind
Finds his way into your brain
Within you lives the man insane
Open all the doors right now
See the colours begin to wow
Creator dies another lives
Oh Sleepers walk me amongst the mist

The smokestack is spitting black
The grease slips from his curls
Mammoth wonât forget his cage
The Clown wears a frown on his face
All aboard the whiskey train
Where you have gone
You have gone insane
Where you have gone itâs what youâre looking at

Sleeping Pool
The waking is here
Sleeping Pool
The dead lay clear
