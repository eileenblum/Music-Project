Centuries under a dying Sun 
Pray for the spiral dance 
Dreaded winter comes your way 
Dead is the fragrant air of May 
Stars align with grace 

Three five pointed stars align 
Bleeding iron from the veins of time 
Ancient moon bogs come alive 
Nightmares swirl in your mind 
Rulers of the Elder Time 
Tentacles grip your mundane life 
Lurking fear from remote lands 
In perfect chaos they ride 

The embers of life they fade 
As the stars they align with grace 

Anti-life creatures of moonlit groves 
Waltz in to the dark 
Wormholes in their crystal ball 
Speak of rotting winds and sinister lies 
(The) Esoteric Order of Elder Time 
Draw an unholy line 
And the stars they align 
Upon the unholy line 
And the stars they align 

The embers of life they fade 
As the stars they align with grace 

Fear the death curse from the stars 
For they have aligned in eons past 
Naked and twisted your life will end 
Paving the way for the Ancient 

From a time where Death has died 
And a place where drought brings joy 
Comes a hate that brings forth life 
Creatures strange with loathsome eyes 
Killing darkness, one youâve never seen 
A rotting life, one youâd rather live 
And the stars they align 
Upon the unholy line 

Fear the death curse from the stars 
For they have aligned in eons past 
Naked and twisted your life will end 
Paving the way for the Ancient 

Blind mountains they rise 
Monoliths stand proud and tall 
Crawling chaos youâre the master 
Obey the unknown one 

Look to the sky 
It burns grey 
Look to the sky
