Those made from technology 
Stake claim to humanity 
Of cyborgs and their queens 
The meek lay slaughtered in between 

Cordite fog it blinds their eyes 
One at a time none survive 
Chaos overdrive 
Fuelled by lies the men they die 

Pyres burn light up the night 
Cried drown daylight midnight 
Pyres dot their distant lands 
The despots rule over the Man 

Born of dirt an Earth like man 
Strong as the hills he scans the land 
Justice on his left, an arm on his right 
All (of) them rulers cower in fright 

Pyres burn light up the night 
The despots slowly vapourise 
Pyres dot their distant lands 
Turned to dust by earthen Man 

The wind spreads his word around now 
Silent masses take to his cause 
The wind spreads his word around now 
Greedy generals dead for a cause 
The wind spreads his word around now 
We are the ones who are lighting the fire 
The wind spreads his word around now 
We are the ones who are stroking your pyre 

The wind spreads his word around now 
Earthen man is dead for no cause 
Still spinning in this void now 
Earthen man is dead for no cause 
The wind spreads his word around now 
They are the ones who are lighting the fire 
The wind spreads his word around now 
They are the ones who are stroking your pyre
