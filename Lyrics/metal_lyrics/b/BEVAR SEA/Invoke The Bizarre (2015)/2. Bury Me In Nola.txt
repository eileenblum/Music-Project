Thereâs a place where sickness winds 
From early hours when the fog subsides 
Sons of the Crooked Cross 
Wage a war at all costs 

Beating demons in their lair 
Sonic murmurs of despair 
Turning gold into dust 
Songs of creation bloody rust 
Do not walk a single file 
Burning order with chaotic pride 
Sons of the Crooked Cross 
Wage a war at all costs 

Beer bong justice 
Gnarly eyes 
Tombstones over land suffice 
Fearless madmen put to test 
Find me a grave where I can rest 

Needle pile over broken glass 
Moonshine Mary 
Stained class
