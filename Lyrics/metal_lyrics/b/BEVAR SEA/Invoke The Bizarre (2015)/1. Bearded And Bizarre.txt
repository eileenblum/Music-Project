Union of the cunning souls 
A gathering of dark mysteries 
Keepers of the black scrolls 
Green wizard strolls through time and history 

Sleight of hand 
Full moon song 
Cosmic arcane man 
Hail the fallen star 

Riding backwards on a goat 
All roads lead to the Sabbath 
Oarsmen row the horned boat 
Green wizardâs reefer madness 

Twisting mass 
Blackhole laws 
Cosmic curse 
Wizard Bizarre 

Some came running 
The others crawled 
Two stars collide 
Invoke the Bizarre 
Wizardâs eye 
Sets seeds afire 
Smoke laden space 
Invoke the Bizarre 

Twisting mass 
Blackhole laws 
Cosmic curse 
We are bizarre 

Nefarious grace 
Lunar phase 
Wizard displaced 

Gaseous embrace 
Lunar daze 
Wizard in pain 

They came running 
And they crawled 
Two stars collide 
Invoke the Bizarre 
Wizardâs eye 
Sets bongs afire 
Smoke laden space 
Invoke the Bizarre
