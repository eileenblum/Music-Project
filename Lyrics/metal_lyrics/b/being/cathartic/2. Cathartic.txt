My fingers on the bench, centipedes in my ear
I'm a worthless, nervous wreck and I am tired of living in fear
I don't want to eat anymore, I don't want to breathe at all
I can't be saved!
Counting backwards from the thousands I try to keep myself sane,
Run away, run away!
Digging into my own flesh reaping grief, people die so easily
In this world the strong devour the weak, to live is to eat others humanity
It's been weighing on my mind for quite some time now, if a bastard son could ever feel proud
Because all I ever knew how to do was to fucking drown
