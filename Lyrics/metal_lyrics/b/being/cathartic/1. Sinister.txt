Death around you, it's over your fucking shoulders
I've been trying to find it but I wither older
I owe you one last kiss
In this world of ignorance there's bliss

I'm watching everyone leave, more for the list of the deceased,
I'm finding it hard to grieve In this life of selection
It's not me who is in the wrong - this world is!
Death
I cannot live with you or without you
Death
I cannot live a bitter life where are you
Death almighty death
