Ire upon the fucking Earth, assembling from across the sky. Rest assured there will be nothing left, for after all there is only I. There is only me, one.

Bow down and proclaim me as your true heir, fall to your knees subjugate to me.

With this world as my vassal, I shall bring upon order, I shall bring upon reign. To providence once again, with serpents.

I bathe in the blood of my enemies, tides of crimson casualties. Pushing and pulling in crevices, evicerating everything.

Some say that this is tantamount to genocide, I say this is a step forward. The cleansing. The ending. Evicerating, evicerating everything.

Dabs of thickles in the minds of cattle. Thoughts swimming in nothingness. Weeds of apathy towards mankind. My name is aversion. Planetary Devastation. One last calamity to bring upon completion of purity. I fell nothing but odium towards this futile, fucking existence.
