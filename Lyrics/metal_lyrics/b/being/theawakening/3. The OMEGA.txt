[feat. Evan Sennuck of Continent]Goddess of my intrepid earth
Undaunted by decrepit flowers
One not yet tainted
A deity of hope

Oh great lady epicentre
Of this pigs eye
Free me of that which leaves me still
Unground me evermore

Rooting like parasites
A catalyst for collapse
This pigs eye is the overseer of destruction of many

An ancient of the garden
Tampering the balance with ore
A final fantasy

[Evan Sennuck:]
Alpha the headless queen,
Feed her to the worms,
Feed her to chaos.

Goddess of my intrepid earth
Lady epicentre
Free me evermore
