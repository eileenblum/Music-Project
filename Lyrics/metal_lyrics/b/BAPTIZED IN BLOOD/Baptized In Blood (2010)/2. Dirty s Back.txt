Stand up and smoke while I eat
Haven't washed my hair in weeks
Wink at every girl I see
I'm bringin' Dirty Back.
Get so high I can't breathe I'm swearing constantly.
Fuck shit you can suck my dick see it just comes naturally.
We're bringin' Dirty Back.
Do what you want have a little fun.
Go out and cause some shit so I know I'm not the only one
Who never washes jeans. Loves the smell of gasoline.
Down Jack till I fall asleep. We're bringin' dirty back.
Fuck rubbers I think they suck.
I'm not wearing them when we go fuck.
No I didn't call you a slut. Just think you look good on me
Hit the rippers grab some eats.
Downing brews as you shake your cheeks.
Sporting joggers so I get a piece. We're bringin dirty back.
Do what you want have a little fun.
Go out and cause some shit so I know I'm not the only one
Who never washes jeans. Loves the smell of gasoline.
Down Jack till I fall asleep. We're bringin' dirty back.
There's only one thing to remember.
(Hell No!) I won't change a thing for anyone.
(Hell No!) We won't change a thing we're too busy loving it.
(Hell No!) I won't change a thing for anyone.
(Hell No!) We won't change a thing we're too busy loving it.
We're bringin' Dirty Back.
Do what you want have a little fun.
Go out and cause some shit so I know I'm not the only one
Who never washes jeans. Loves the smell of gasoline.
Down Jack till I fall asleep. We're bringin' dirty back.
We're bringin' Dirty Back. We're Bringin' Dirty Back.
Dirty's Back.
