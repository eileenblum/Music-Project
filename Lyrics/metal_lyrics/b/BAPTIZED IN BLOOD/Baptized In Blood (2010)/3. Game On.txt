Anxiety's taken over me, Draining all my stability, it's gone
Walls feel like they're closing in, grips on my heart and you're squeezing me

Light headed I need to find a seat, get these ghosts away from me
Nothing I hear is comforting, waking up alone is killing me

It's on, don't know how I'm going to turn it off
You're gone, don't wanna be lost forever

I've played the game, accept the pain
I get this feeling that you're never coming back
I'll take the blame just say you'll stay
I get this feeling that you're never coming back [x2]

One more chance for victory, history keeps reminding me
Get your head out of the clouds, I'm burning this boat when I touch down

Living as the enemy, living with these uncertainties
Defeated 'till the bitter end
Desperately trying to understand why you're gone
Don't wanna be lost forever
It's on, don't know how I'm going to turn it off

I've played the game, accept the pain
I get this feeling that you're never coming back
I'll take the blame just say you'll stay
I get this feeling that you're never coming back [x2]

Please tell me this is all a dream, Procrastinations killing me
The planes just crashed into the river
And I'm the sole survivor, And I'm the sole survivor

I've played the game, accept the pain
I get this feeling that you're never coming back
I'll take the blame just say you'll stay
I get this feeling that you're never coming back [x2]
I've got this feeling that I'll never get you back
