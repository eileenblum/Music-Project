I will not be judged, I know I'm self destructive
Temptation surrounds me and I can't rise above
The blackened water is slowly rising
And the captain is going down with his ship
The waves keep crashing in. Time to repent for my sins.
Temptation surround me and I've gotta move towards
Decisive actions must be taken. To curb this insatiable addiction.
And now I'm drowning on the inside
But I won't back down
And now I'm lying on the outside
But this is love, this is love this is love
No, this is me forgetting how to breathe
Just like dying in a dream this is all so overwhelming
This is me forgetting how to breathe.
With my hand under the water I am left with no reflection
I can't believe I'm self destructing. At least I'll leave a gorgeous corpse
The water is slowly rising and the captain is going down with his ship
And now I'm dying on the inside
But I won't back down
And now I'm lying on the outside
But this is love, this is love this is love
No, this is me forgetting how to breathe
Just like dying in a dream this is all so overwhelming
This is me forgetting how to breathe.
With my hand under the water I am left with no reflection
And now I'm drowning on the inside
But I won't back down
And now I'm lying on the outside
But this is love, this is love this is love
I can't believe I'm self destructing. At least I'll leave a gorgeous corpse
The water is slowly rising and the captain is going down with his ship
And now I'm drowning on the inside
But I won't back down
And now I'm lying on the outside
But this is love, this is love this is love
No, this is me forgetting how to breathe
Just like dying in a dream this is all so overwhelming
This is me forgetting how to breathe.
With my hand under the water I am left with no reflection
