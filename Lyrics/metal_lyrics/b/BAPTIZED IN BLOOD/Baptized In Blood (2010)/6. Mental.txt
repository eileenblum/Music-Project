Within temptations lies demons inside, these animals have taken my brain
Enter the presence of mind numbing drugs, these are the only things keeping me sane
I, I want it all, I want the comforts of this world
Placed in my hands never to leave my side again
I am losing it, I am losing it, I am slowly going crazy
And I can't help but wonder what brought me here

Wither the flesh of the bodies of brave
Even the strong don't survive, exit the presence of mind numbing drugs
You alone kept yourself alive, Lost, lost to this world, lost to the presence of your rule
Found in the sense that I have found myself here
I am losing it, I am losing my mind, I am losing it, I am slowly going crazy
And I can't help but wonder what brought me here, Distorted perceptions drove demons
Inside these monsters devoured my brain, Exit the presence of mind numbing love that was the only shit keeping me sane

I, I want it all, I want the comforts of this world
Placed in my hands never ti leave my side again
I am losing it, I am lost, and I want it back rational thoughts all but gone
Can't have it back 'cause I am slowly losing it
And I want it back, the power of virtue is gone, you can't have it back 'cause
I am slowly going crazy, I am slowly going crazy, and I can't help but wonder what brought me here
