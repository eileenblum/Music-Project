What's brought you so down? Down and out
Get off the fucking floor

This is nothing new, get a fucking clue, this is your life's redemption
Stand up for yourself, count on no one else, take control of your situation
I respect respect, what about you? A shadow of your former self

I can see you're gutter bound, cast aside, nothing left but tomorrow
Your life's a mess, nowhere to hide, you've got nothing left, but you've got tomorrow
Down and out, for the hundredth time, Down and out
In your eyes, I respect respect, what about you? A shadow of your former self

I can see you're gutter bound, cast aside, nothing left but tomorrow
Your life's a mess, nowhere to hide, you've got nothing left, but you've got tomorrow
Gutter bound, cast aside, nothing left but tomorrow

Your life's a mess, nowhere to hide, you've got nothing left, but you've got tomorrow
You're gutter bound, been cast aside, but you've got tomorrow
Your life's a mess, with nowhere to hide, but you're living for today
Down and out, for the last time, I'll get back up and take what's mine
Down and out, take back my life
