All alone again and I did it
Fucked up and I admit it
I've gotta learn to move on and start my life without you in it

These are the lives, built on lies, that you hold so deep inside
And it makes me realize that this shit ain't working out

Another tall can for another long night alone
And it's feeling empty
Another tall can for another long night alone
You leave me breathless

Don't you know that we're finished
Hopes and dreams diminish
I've gotta do this myself and start a life without you in it

These are the lives, built on lies, that you hold so deep inside
And it makes me realize that this shit ain't working out

Oh I, well I feel like, I'm running on empty
Oh I, well I feel like, My time is running out

Another tall can for another long night alone
And I'm feeling empty
Another tall can for another long night alone
You leave me breathless

Quit leaving me, quit leaving me, don't leave me now

Another tall can for another long night alone
And it's feeling empty
Another tall can for another long night alone
You leave me breathless
Another tall can for another long night alone
It's feeling empty
Another tall can for another long night alone
You leave me breathless
