Just give it a shot, give it a last line lady, for I forget why I wanted you back at all
Give me a shot lady, before I know it I'll be set up to take the fall
Throw me a line, throw me a last line lady, let's remember why we started this trash at all
Throw me a last look hunny, before you know it I'll be walking out the door

I can deal without your sense of sensibility, Common sense makes sense to me
I can deal without your sense of sensibility, your twisted logic's lost on me

Tell me a tale, tell me a tall tale sweetie, trust me I listened but it doesn't make sense at all
Throw me a last line lady, I know you're pretty but it doesn't change this at all
Throw me a line, throw me a last line lady, let's remember why we started this trash at all
Throw me a last look hunny, before you know it I'll be walking out the door

I can deal without your sense of sensibility, common sense makes sense to me
I can deal without your sense of sensibility, your twisted logic's lost on me

Fuck, and you keep coming back for more and I've got nothing more to say
You keep coming back for more, guess I'll die another day
Devil's knocking at my door and I'm about to let her in
She keeps banging on my door, she knows this body's built for sin

I can deal without your sense of sensibility, common sense makes sense to me
I can deal without your sense of sensibility, your twisted logic's lost on me
It's your last line lady, I can deal without your sense of sensibility
Last line lady, common sense makes sense to me
It's your last line lady, I can deal without your sense of sensibility
Common sense makes sense to me, 'cause I decide what's best for me
If you love something set it free, your twisted logic's lost on me
