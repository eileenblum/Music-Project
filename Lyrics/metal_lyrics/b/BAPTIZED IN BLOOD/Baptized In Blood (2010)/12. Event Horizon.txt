Damaging the population unimpressed with your state of mind
Cast down into damnation once again you've been redefined
You're so damn pessimistic every day drowning in the red
You ain't getting busy living you might as well get fucking dead

There always something wrong, with every situation
If you feel all hope is gone
Trust me I've been there, you can't live for yesterday

There's always a silver lining, in every black cloud in the sky
The sun will still rise tomorrow, and one day you'll see the lights

Open your eyes

Treachery in a fallen nation all withheld until we fall in line
No remorse or practically tragic values all lost in time
Don't let fear take you over, life is hard, you're time's a test
You alone can make the difference separate yourself from the rest

There always something wrong, with every situation
If you feel all hope is gone
Trust me I've been there, you can't live for yesterday

Open your eyes

And one day you'll see the light, you can't live for yesterday

Open your eyes

And one day you'll see the light
There's always a silver lining, in every black cloud in the sky
The sun will rise tomorrow, and one day you'll see the light
