They're shipping me off to the blackened unknown, hoping my heart will decay
It just doesn't seem like today is my day, In a world full of werewolves I'm a sheep in open pastures
I'm a sitting duck if you don't come and rescue me
I stare dead into the darkness, don't know how I'm to live this anymore
I swear with God as my witness, don't know how I'm to live this anymore

Settling into my place in the masses, still know there's something wrong
They've made me throw away my social liberties, I can't eat, I can't speak
I'm finding it hard to see straight, I can't even pray without some asshole watching me
I stare dead into the darkness, don't know how I'm to change this anymore
I swear with god as my witness, don't know how I'm to change this anymore
In a big way I hate the way I'm forced to maim these strangers
Somehow you've gotta get me through this door

They're shipping me off with no real destination, giving them my salute as they load me on
Get it through your head, before I'm gone forever, you're fucking wrong [x3]
You know I'm right, you're in the wrong, bullets are loaded, filling all the chambers
There's nowhere else left to run, you're the target, sighted.
Dead on the cross hairs, I'll be shooting my mouth like a gun
I stare dead into the darkness, don't know how I'm to live this anymore
I swear with God as my witness, don't know how I'm to live this anymore
I stare dead into the darkness, don't know how to save this anymore
Ina big way I hate the way I'm in dear and present danger
Somehow you've gotta get me through the door

They're shipping me off to my final destination, giving them my salute as they load me on
Get this through your head before I'm lost forever, you know I'm right, you're in the wrong
You're fucking wrong [x3]
I'll say it again, you're fucking wrong [x3]
You're all fucking wrong, you know I'm right.
