I'm a cold hearted classless son of a bitch now
Got a drink in my hand and my eyes on your ass (yeah!)
Thought this was just another one night stand
Drown me in your lies woman!

Come back baby! I wanna watch you walk away again
Come back baby! I wanna hear you scream my name
Oh yeah hunny! Your voice just like the angels singin'
Oh yeah hunny! I wanna feel your skin against me

This is no angel, I hear that voice inside me say
Press them bottles to your lips
Drown me in your lies
Let's give it a go
Let's give it a go!
I will never sympathize with you

No I don't sympathize with you!
Come back baby! I wanna watch you walk away again
Come back baby! I wanna hear you scream my name
Oh yeah hunny! Your voice just like the angels singin'
Oh yeah hunny! I wanna feel your skin against me

Oh! I'm no good for you
And babe, you're no good for me

Come back baby, I'm no good for you
Oh yeah hunny, and you're no good for me
Come back baby! I wanna watch you walk away again
Come back baby, I'm no good for you
Oh yeah hunny, and you're no good for me
Come back baby! I wanna feel your skin against me
