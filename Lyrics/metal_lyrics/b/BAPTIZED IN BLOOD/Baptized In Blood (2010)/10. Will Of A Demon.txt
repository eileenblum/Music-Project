Lay awake, paralyzed, inside my bed all day
Lowered down surrounded by my family
Everything I see is never what it seems to be
Now I'm leaving in this box, I've filled with broken dreams

I, I can't justify my actions
I'm just a man cursed with the heart of a heathen
I, I can't step aside or let you in this time
As I possess the will of a demon

My head is saying yes but my heart knows that it's lying
My head is saying yes but my heart knows

Fire in your eyes is just sarcastic fantasy
I can't take away this pain inside my head today
Want this to have an end that I cannot foresee
Still uncertain what the future's gonna hold for me

I, I can't justify my actions
I'm just a man cursed with the heart of a heathen
I, I can't step aside or let you in this time
As I possess the will of a demon

My head is saying yes but my heart knows that it's lying
My head is saying yes but my heart knows

I won't apologize for anything this time, if I was wrong I'd only be lying
You, you've come undone inside, you've let me down this time
Would up your thoughts, now your story's unraveling

My head is saying yes but my heart knows it's lying

I, I can't justify my actions
I'm just a man cursed with the heart of a heathen
I, I can't step aside or let you in this time
As I possess the will of a demon

My head is saying yes but I know it's lying
My head is saying yes but my heart knows it's lying
My head is saying yes but my heart knows
