I hide behind this hair that blocks these bloodshot eyes
I'm captivated with all of the crap that's crammed inside your mind
Yesterday is gone forever and tomorrow may never come
But as for you and I, Darling I think I'm done

I'm sick of compromise because it's getting us nowhere
I'm powerless to your power trips
Feels like a part of me's died

I ride for days on end, yet still can't comprehend
This damage that's inflicted again
Sleeping with the enemy, is sheer indecency
For purely selfish reasons but this shit has got to end

This shit has got to end

I'm sick of compromise because it's getting us nowhere
I'm powerless to your power trips
Feels like a part of me's dead
I'm done crumbling inside because it's getting me nowhere
Take without giving, faith without healing
Feels like a part of me, feels like a part of me's died
Feels like a part of me has died
Yet I've never felt more alive
No, I've never felt more alive

There will be no compromise because I'm leaving this bullshit behind
No more excuses no more these loose lips cremate the past in your mind
No matter what the cost, no matter what I've lost
I'm sick of being in the wrong
Take without giving, faith without healing
I've never felt, I've never felt more
I've never felt, No, I've never felt more alive
