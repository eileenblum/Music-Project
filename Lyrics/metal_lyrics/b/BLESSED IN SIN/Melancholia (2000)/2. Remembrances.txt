I can't drown your face from my mind.
I can feel that the sadness fills my soul.
Your watch shows me the way
Your breath gives me the life.

My soul is bleeding because of the pain
The pain that lacerates my heart
Since the day you left us
Our heart is full of sorrow.

Dark, black, are my remembrances.
All around me is dark.
Dark, like, my soul.
My soul is sad, she's bleeding.

Come on little sister,
Enter the kingdom of light.
Become an angel of purity
And walk near us.

Dark, black, are my remembrances.
All around me is dark.
Dark, like, my soul.
My soul is sad, she's bleeding.
