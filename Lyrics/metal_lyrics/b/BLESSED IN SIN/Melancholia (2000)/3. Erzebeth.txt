O vampire with eternal beauty come to me and drink my blood
countess eager of beauty, be the mistress of my nights.
O my beautiful dark countess go out  of your antiq coffin with the
mysterious flame of my wonderful power.
Now your soul will next feed on darkness.

Go out your black marbled tomb and drink on the antiq chalice of
the sky kingdom.
O sumptuous queen of whom the black and cold stare freezes the
blood of men.
Your sinister splendour reborn from the earth entrails. At last your
sobs are ending.

O dark mistress make us both be one.
O sumptuous Countesss, drink my blood, daughter of the night, be
by this blood the supreme synarchy of the universe.

Now you're riding the fatal serpent who will guide you out of the
abyss; go infamous creature and bring the eternal bereavement on
earth and feed with the blood of humans and taste again with me the
blasphemous barbarian pleasures and lusts o my dark countes
