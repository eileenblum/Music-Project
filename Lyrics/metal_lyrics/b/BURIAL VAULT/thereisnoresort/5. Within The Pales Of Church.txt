As I Glance At The Shore
My Eyes Espy Their Ships
The Sign Of The Cross
Painted On Their Sails

They Are Telling Us How To Pray
They Are Teaching Us Who To Obey
Theyâre Instructing Us What To Believe
Culture Killing Missionaries

Don't They Think It's Criminal
To Steal Someone's Identity
Just Because Of Prejudices
What Gives Them The Right?

Priests Of Ignorance
They Show No Mercy
I Can't See Much Truth
In What They Say

The Only Wrong Church

They Think The Ultimate Goal
Is To Proselytize The World
But What Is The Price?
Slavery Of Individual Thoughts

They Think We're Just Barbarians
But What They Do Is Barbarous

Within The Pales Of The Church
Within The Pales Of The Church
