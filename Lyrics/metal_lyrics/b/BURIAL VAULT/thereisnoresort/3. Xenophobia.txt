It Goes Into Your Head
Runs Into Your Brain
Spreads Through Your Veins
And Makes You Insane

Toxic Comes Out Of Your Mouth
As You Get Beyond Control
The Rancor Grows Deep Inside You
And Your Voice Polutes The Air
You're Hung Up On Racist Ideals
And All Facistic Laws
You're A Mercenary In The Legions
Of Xenophobia

You Are Put Into A Rage
By A Right Wing Extremist Virus
Face The Wall Of Hatred And Scorn
That You've Constructed On Your Own

Use The Antidote
Before You Can't Return
Before You're Just A Slave Of Hate
A Machine In The War

Use The Antidote
Before You Can't Return
Before This Lethal Injection
Is Ripping You Alive

Use The Antidote
Before You Can't Return
Because This Desease
Is More Horrible Than Anything Else

It Goes Into Your Head
And Makes You Insane

Use The Antidote
Before You Can't Return
Because This Desease
Is More Horrible Than Anything Else
