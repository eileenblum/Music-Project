Blackness
Am I blind?
Why Can't I See A Thing?
Narrowness
There's No Space
I Can Hardly Breath

Is This The Afterlife
Or Is This Just Illusion
Am I Buried Alive
Condemned To Die

Burial Vault
Trapped Inside My Wooden Cage
Burial Vault
Six Feet Under Ground

There Is No memory
What Happened To Me
Who Has Done All This
Just To Bother Me

Burial Vault
There Is No Resort
Burial Vault
Six Feet Under Ground

Sanity and Reason
They Disappear From Me
I Seem To Hear Voices
Theyâre Screaming My Name

Death Is My Redemption
I Recall The Past
Now I 'll Pass Away
I Draw My Last Breath

Exitus
End Of Life
Decay Of My Cadaver
Death
My Dead Body Will Dwell
In The Burial Vault
