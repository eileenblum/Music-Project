When Suicide Commandos
Rule The Day
When Normal Life Is Removed
From The Agenda
Pain And Desperation
Form The Government
Racism And Fascism
Are Raging Through The Minds

When Nightmares Come True
A Dominion Of Fear
All Colors Turn To Gray
A Blackened Earth
All Hell Breaks Loose

When Pandemonium Reigns The World
And The Truth Is Just A Lie
When Life Is Just Endless Pain
And Death A Desperate Cry

The Last Judgment Is Coming Near
The Apocalypse Is Here

When Nightmares Come True
A Dominion Of Fear
All Colors Turn To Gray
A Blackened Earth

Pain And Desperation
Form The Government
The Truth Is Just A Lie
And Death Only A Desperate Cry
