Eternal Torture - Final Chapter
Death Desire - Endless Fire

Awakened By The Stabbing Pain
Watching The Ball And Chain
Listen To The Sound Of Death
Final Breath

Eternal Torture - Final Chapter
Death Desire - Endless Fire

My Blood-Shot Eyes
Descry
My Sawed Off Extremeties
That Are Nailed
To The Wall
Like Trophies

The Beat Of My Heart
Feels Like
A Striking Sledge
And I'm Afraid
Of My Rebirth

There Is No Escape For Me
Soon I Will Fade Away
Someone's Turning Out The Lights
Judgement Day

Eternal Torture - Final Chapter
Death Desire - Endless Fire

Victim Of The Insane Mind
That Once Created Life

Eternal Fire
Eternal Pain
Eternal Torture
