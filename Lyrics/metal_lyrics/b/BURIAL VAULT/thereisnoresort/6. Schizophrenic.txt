What Happened Here?
Who Are These People?
Who Killed Them In My House?
I See The Blood
I See My Gun
Itâs Been Taken Off The Wall

You're Guilty
You've Done It
And I Was Helping You
I'm Your Alter Ego
And We Both Hated Them All

Every Time You Tried To Make A Good Job
There Was Someone Who Was Better Than You
No One Recognizes Who You Are
You Are Just A Removable Looser
That's Why You Hate The Human Race
And Everybody On This Earth
Because you've always oppressed your emotions
You've created me

What Have I Done?
That Can't Be True
Such Was Not My Intention
You're A Liar
Go Out Of My Head
You Won't Take Over Me
We Are One
Accept It
I Did What You Ever Desired
Remember What They've Done To You
They've Never Done Anything To Me
You Hate Human Beings And Their Snootiness

You're Right And Now Let Our Carnage Begin

Youâre Right And Now Let Our Carnage Just Begin
