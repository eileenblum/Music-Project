Are Rotting On The Floor
A Big Puddle Of Blood

A Creature With Pale-Grey Eyes
Appears Out Of The Darkness
An Undead Body
Driven By Murderous Frenzy

Searching For Dead Meat
A Scavenger On The Way
To Quench Its Thirst For Blood

Creature From The Vault
A Slave To The Death
Watching Out For Battlefields
To Munch Dead Soldiers

Creature From The Vault
Controlled By The Old Curse
Waiting For Salvation
But It Will Never Be Redeemed
