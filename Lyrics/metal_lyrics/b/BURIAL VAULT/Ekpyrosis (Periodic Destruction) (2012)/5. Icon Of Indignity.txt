Ignorance, intolerance
No acceptance from your vicinity

Nonobservance, ejection
You are trapped but you want to flee

Ostracized and disdained
Your life feels like a heavy burden
Social exclusion
Is part of your daily routine

Youâre searching for recognition
But no one regards you
Not anybody

You start creating your own world
A world that exists in your head
Where you can not be passed over
No outcast anymore

The illusion grows inside your mind
You want it to be real

All shall be left behind
Forgotten
Youâre going deaf, dumb and blind

Totally numb
Depressive
You lose relation to reality

It begins to dawn on you
The only to find peace of mind
Is to fulfill your desire
Itâs going to dominate you

Lost
Possessed
Driven by your phantasmagoria
You start to execute it
Now itâs time for revenge
They all must pay
For what theyâve done

Nobody knew your name
But from this day forth
Everyone will know who you are

You thought it would
Be your catharsis
Too see all your 
Tormentorâs suffer

Youâve lost yourself
In animosity
And there is still no other person 
Than yourself

Look at you now
Youâre still alone
Your face will be remembered
Remembered as an icon of indignity

Indignity

You couldnât change
What hurt you the most
And now this horrible pain hurts you
Even more

Ignorance, intolerance
Nonobservance, ejection
Social exclusion
Defines you
