Obsessed by power
They want to eliminate us
Their urge for mastery
Makes them merciless

They spread their doctrine
Full of racialisms
An inhuman
Race ideology

Deported to this baneful place
Just waiting to be slain
We are treated like the 
Unadulterated filth
We are treated like toxic waste

Although they discern us
By the colors of our badges
In the end
We will die the same way

Persecution
Due to hate
âFinal solutionâ
For what?

Who can do this with a 
Clear conscience?

Violent
Lunatic
War leads to nothing
Disrespect of human rights
Keep World War II in mind

An awful endeavour
An insane outrage

In the concentration camp
Weâre split into groups
Groups formed to us suffer

Some of us shall simply be shot to death
Others become victims in human experiments

Doomed to work for the enemy
Several camp inmates 
Have to prepare
The most vicious murder instrument of
All time

The gutless guards dread the infestation
So we have to fill in the deadly gas

Zyklon B
Our lives end in screams

Sickening
Savage
War leads to nothing
Negation of human rights
Keep the holocaust in mind
This rancid felony
This iniquity
The allied forces see behind the curtain
They notice that they must intervene

As they arrive at the place of our 
Martyrdom
Our dastard tormentors â already
Absconded
Too coward to pay for their atrocities
