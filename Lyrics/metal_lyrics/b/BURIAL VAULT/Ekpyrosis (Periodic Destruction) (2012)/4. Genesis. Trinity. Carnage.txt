Atomic Warfare â A horror vision
Becomes reality

Only three steps â Base for the calamity

In the beginnings of the 20th century,
A chemist starts atomic research
After operose years he discovers the fission
This day marks the birth of the atomic age

A detection changes the whole world
Its malpractice could end it all forever

Genesis: Birth of the atomic age
Trinity: They experience the annihilating force
Carnage: Ekpyrosis

During the war the military gets hold of 
This knowledge

But the chemist doesnât want to be part of
Their scheme
And armed forces search for a way to
Exploit the fission energy
For a weapon of mass destruction

The world leaders open an inexorable struggle
For the realization of the first atomic bomb
Then some scientists crack the riddle
They devise trinity
Like an explosion thatâs not of this earth
The harbinger of carnage

Genesis: Birth of the atomic age
Trinity: They experience the annihilating force
Carnage: Ekpyrosis

Just to demonstrate their lethal weapon
They attack and kill thousands of innocents

Craving for
Global ascendance

For him it was a groundbreaking discovery
But now the chemist wishes that he could
Revoke everything
