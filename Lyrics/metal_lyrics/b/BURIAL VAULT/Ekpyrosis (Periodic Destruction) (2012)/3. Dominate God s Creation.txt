Since time immemorial
Mankind tries to âcorrectâ
From its point of view
Plants and creatures
Donât seem to be perfect

âThe pride of Creationâ
Humans carry things too far

Their megalomania fathomless
Their greed is never satisfied

So human beings start vandalizing
Their natural environment

By studying their roots
They set up a theory of evolution

The examinations show
That mutation defines the biological progression

This fact causes a huge fascination
They started some experiments
With vegetables and animals

Breeding new races
A competition at the cost of a virgin earth

Ruthless, cold-blooded and disrespectful
Towards flora and fauna
They dismember their surroundings
Just striving to dominate godâs creation

With every step they take
They go deeper into the secrets of genetic
To dublicate life

Now human beings annul the nature
Defying their evolution
Theory

Men laugh into the face of a god that
Theyâve created
Now that he is obsolete
Outmoded

The domination of godâs creation
Delusions of grandeur

Men laugh into the face of a god that
Theyâve created
Now that he is obsolete
Outmoded
