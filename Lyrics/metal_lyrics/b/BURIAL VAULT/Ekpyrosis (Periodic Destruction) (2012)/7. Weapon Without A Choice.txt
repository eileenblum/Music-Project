Born into this world
I learned the bitter truth
About living in a world of war

Since I was a child
I was always drilled to kill
Constant rejection of my free will

Impelled by their wrath
They rear troops of rage

Biological warfare â I shall become their gun

My childhood controlled by their lies
My innocence raped by their ignorance
No individuality â Domination of the group
My childhood, torn to shreds

Absurd phrases
Raven my thoughts

Despondency takes command
Black despair compels me

Destroys me

Pestilence

Pointless malediction

Iâm the spawn of their malevolent nation

My war starts at the sharp end
I have to face what they call âfiendâ
Now Iâm a weapon
Without a choice

Who is the villain? Who is to blame?
I wait a second and I aim

In my ballistic curve
There is just my head

Iâm no longer part of this terror

Iâm no longer part of this disease

Salvation by suicide
