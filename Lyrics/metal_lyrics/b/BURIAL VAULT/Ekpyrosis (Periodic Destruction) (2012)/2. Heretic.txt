They called me a heretic
So I deserved nothing but torment
For what they seemed to see
In my views

First they arrested me
And locked me into a cell
A chamber that was out of reach 
For the light of day

In The darkness, I heard things
I've never heard before
Step by step I began to feel empty and faint

After days of attrition
They started their procedure
A bestial torture

They called me a heretic
So I deserved nothing but torment
For what they seemed to see
In my views

A mummed torturer entered the room
A relentless man without remorse
Bloodshed wasn't allowed by the church
So he used other ways to violate me

He put screws into my thumbs
And into my knees
He blemished my body
With blistering steel

My neck was enfeebled
By a tremendously heavy rosary

With broken bones
And luxated arms
I was no longer able to walk,
No longer able to grip
Mutilated because of my ideas

They called me a heretic
So I deserved nothing but torment
For what they seemed to see
In my views
