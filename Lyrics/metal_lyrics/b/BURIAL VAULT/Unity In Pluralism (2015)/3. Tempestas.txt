Do we know what time is?
Is it the time on the clock that's ticking,
The ticking that accompanies us all day,
All night and in between?

Is it our lifetime
Periods that run
Always aiming a certain point
A point that stays unknown until our arrival

Thoughts they fly
Time goes by
Impossible to keep hold of it

Thoughts disappear
But time won't
Immeasurable, stable

Tempus edax rerum

Are we the ruler
Or are we subjects?
Is time our influence?
Are we to neglect?

Time is precious
Time is rare
Though we're sometimes
Unaware

We are no masters
But we're not enslaved
Sometimes it's fate
And sometimes dictate

Tempus edax rerum
