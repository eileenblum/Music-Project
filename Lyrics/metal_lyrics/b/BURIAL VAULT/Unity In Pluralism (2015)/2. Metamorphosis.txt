Close look into the eyes
Cold sphere of malicious deceit
Ever-growing antipathy
No respect - just dread

The lowest form of recognition
For a man - calculating
Insensitive, unethical, conscienceless

Aim = career
The pressure of the peer
Minutes, hours, days and years,
Friends, companions disappear

Battle for promotion
Obstacles or inner conflicts
Dazed and numbed - fast motion

Memories, stages, moments, years,
Friends, companions disappear

Solely climbing that ladder
Following one matter
Perpetual motion process
Pursuit of success

A weird face in the mirror
Recall of familiar dread
A sudden awareness
This twist - a shock

The lowest form of recognition
For myself - how could I
Disregard my metamorphosis

I wasn't looking back
Nor looking left or right
Life on the fast lane
Without taking any notice
Change - evolution?
Transformation - metamorphosis

A smothered mind - reprogrammed
Creeping metamorphosis

Solely climbing that ladder
Following one matter
Perpetual motion process
Pursuit of success
