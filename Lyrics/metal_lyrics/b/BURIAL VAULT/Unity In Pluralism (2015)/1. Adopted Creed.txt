At any time, the news show us
The instability within society
They say the danger's almost everywhere
There's no resort
We walk this path without an escort

Adopted creed - they awe and daunt us
Proceed to foist new fear
Adopted creed? - injected creed
Just to make us amenable

Vengeance of nature
Rivers overflow their banks - polar caps melt
Moving tectonic plates - the earth quakes

Adopted creed - they awe and daunt us
Proceed to foist new fear
Adopted creed? - injected creed
Just to make us amenable

Where is the steadiness that we had once?
Or is it just a misbelief in something that never was?

Longing for a force - able to guide us
People are in search for god
but is the organized church
Just another scare monger?

The tongues of the leaders of sects are split
Deception - It's just about a bottomless pit

They won't give in - they will persist
Christ, muslim, zionist, islamist, baptist

When people live in mess and pertubation
Anguish - volitional obfuscation

Can we discern between hand and fist
Christ, muslim, zionist, islamist, baptist

All over the place, a search for healing
And deliverance from this disorder
Driven into the mouth of greed
Clouding the difference
Superstition or faith

Adopted creed - they awe and daunt us
Proceed to foist new fear
Adopted creed? - injected creed
Just to make us amenable
