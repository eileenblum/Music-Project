Loss of time
Loss of place
Loss of memory

Liquid crystal dementia
Knowledge doesn't matter
You simply have to know
Where to find the answer

A screen that doesn't only mirror true life - reality
Disarrayed - causes brain injury?
Progressive de-evolution
Proceeds with capricious velocity
Cognitive area damage

Syndrome of a sickened society
Void - oblivious - delirious
A head without memory
A fortress of solitude

Addicted to technology
Without natural urge
Multi-task, single task, "no task"

Liquid crystal dementia
Knowledge doesn't matter
You simply have to know
Where to find the answer

A language lost in phrases - shortened to acronyms
Without sense - no grammar - no structure
Information is energy
In every transmission it loses something
Information overkill

Syndrome of a sickened society
Void - oblivious - delirious
A brain without data
Etiology of the disease

The capitulation of discrete thinking
Force liquid crystal dementia

A brain without data
A head without memory
LCD
