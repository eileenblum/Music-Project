The return to the origin - a place where it all began
The return to a mindset where everything was new
Sumless faces, unknown spaces, different shades
Changes like traffic signs on
The path back to point zero

A scream out of nowhere
A story that tells itself
A blank page with a deeper sense than any word
No expectations
External pressure
No limits, no breaks, no boundaries
Like a virgin
Hour of birth
Innocent, impartial

Making mistakes,
Going on
Walking through bodies
Still going on
No boundaries at point zero
Life is not a circle but a spiral
The angle changes with every step

We walk along the path
A path we call our life
And even if we turn around
we can't go back

Though we keep our origin in mind

The spiral makes the stages
Reappear - randomly
But from a different point of view
A change of circumstances
A change of personality
But in the core - still the same
Return to point zero
Heart's desire
Infeasible - still worthwhile

Making mistakes
Going on
Walking through bodies
Still going on
No boundaries at point zero
Life is not a circle but a spiral
While certain feelings recall the start
It's impossible to go back

Back to point zero
Back to point zero
