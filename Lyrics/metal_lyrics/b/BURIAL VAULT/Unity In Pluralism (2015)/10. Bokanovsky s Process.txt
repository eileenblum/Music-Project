Deformation and disfigurement,
Unnatural progression,
Higher, faster, further

Evolution on the assembly line
This process - our holy shrine
Millions predefined
Billions of a kind

Efficiency, technology
Equality means quality
Symmetric in design
Digital age - divine

Reproduction on the assembly line
Flawless and irresistible

No one should stop the technological advance
A highly controlled social world
