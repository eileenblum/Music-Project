They aimed high
Much higher than a human mind could see
Were over the people's heads
Like a godhead

The creator made us all
A doctrine of the past
The church becomes the outcast

The church becomes the outcast

Fighting for their reputation
So many want their revocation
Too many mistakes, too many scandals

Science brought answers
Killed the power of the church
A power based on ignorance, nescience and fear

Religions dismantle themselves
A search for a surrogate
To keep the people in fear

Godliness means anxiety
Of god's vengefulness
Downright sanctimony

Just an antiquated mindset
A world in constant motion
Tear down the lies - piece by piece

Rape cases and accusations
Drug abuse - manipulation
Too many mistakes, too many scandals

Scientific findings
Now the clergy's s filled with fear
A paradigm change

Religions dismantled themselves
The search for a surrogate
Pointless

We are not afraid of you anymore
