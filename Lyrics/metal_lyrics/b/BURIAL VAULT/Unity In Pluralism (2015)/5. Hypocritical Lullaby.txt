While innocent people are killed in mindless wars
They sing their hypocritical lullaby

Hush, all you people, don't say a word
This war's for freedom and not absurd

That very lord is he that made all things
Of all lords he's lord - king of all kings

Lullaby and good night,
Don't question our might
Lady thee down now and rest
May thy slumber be blessed

Atrocities - concealed
Soothing stories to calm us
Their tranquilizer

They are taking us for fools
Treating us like infants
Utilizing us like tools
Drawing the curtain over their intent
Drowning the pure lament

Biased reporting
Spiced with fairy tales
Well-prepared Propaganda
Spread through memorized speeches

Double-tongued turncoats
Abusers of elocution
Skilled twisters of facts

Camouflage - disguise - Hypocritical lullaby
The truth that lies between the lines
The lines no one gets to read

Awaking from slumber
The voice of the people
Screams its lament
A cacophony to break the walls

Lullaby and good night,
Don't question our might
Lay thee down now and rest
May thy slumber be blessed

Who is the lord?
Who is the king?
Vox populi
