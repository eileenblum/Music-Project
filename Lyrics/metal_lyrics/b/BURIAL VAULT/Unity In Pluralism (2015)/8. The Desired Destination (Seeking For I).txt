I struggle through the day
Deserted and reclusive
In search for real motives
To go on - the pathway to I

Who is the real me?
Where can I find myself?
Questions - so easy to ask
So hard to answer

A step between the worlds
A walk through my mind
A dark cloud above starts to rain
Every drop - so full of salvation

In search for myself
Seeking for I

The desired destination
Seeking for I

Longing to walk alone
Yearning to stand alone
To stand my own ground

With no guidance from above
Conceiving all the multi-colored shades

Of my being
of myself

Seeking for I
Seeking for I
Seeking for I
