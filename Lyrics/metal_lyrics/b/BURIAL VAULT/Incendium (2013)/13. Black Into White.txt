Absolutely paralyzed - What have I done?
Invisibly cicatrized - Going on the run
My target is the river, so that the hound can't follow
My former colleagues fed it with my DNA

This creature
That's not dead and not alive
I feel its presence so near

Flashing blue light and siren's screams
The display that surround me
Broadcast the chase like movie scenes

As I arrive at the water
I throw my clothes
And my past away

Firemen are just pawns in a game of senselessness
Instead of choking fires they start fires
Now it's time to change my life from black into white
Black into white

Everthing that I believed in it was only a shade of the truth
My life was like a hound
Not dead - Not alive
Now I'm gonna change my life from black into white

Flashing lights and bomb blasts
A violent tendency no one perceived

Out of control
The unavoidable war starts far away behind me
Restrained emotions break free
End of the line? Every end is a new beginning...
