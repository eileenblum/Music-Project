I hear the siren drawing near
451 I am exposed
The salamander arrives
In front of my eyes

Before the door
The firechief
Armed with a flamethrower
Ready for a new procedure

He roars at me, "Open the door!
There's no way out.
You know what's gonna happen now."

This is your chance
Show me that you regret
You fatuous fool
Books aren't necessary
They cause disorder between people
Disturbing the peace

Your wife is already gone
Do you want to lose everything?
For heaven's sake

Do you remember the girl?
You met her several times
We had to eliminate her

She was a nonconformist
And you are turning into one too
Take the flamethrower
Burn the books to ashes
Then burn the ashes

He hands me the weapon
I turn around and pull the trigger
The firechief turns into a human torch
He flares, he flickers
Then he breaks down

With the books put under my garment
I burn everything down to ashes
All the lies, all the insanity
To leave the corset that once was my life

She was a nonconformist
And you are turning into one too
Take the flamethrower
Burn the books to ashes
Then burn the ashes
