Opening the door to my house
Words haunting through my head
It's late at night I try to be quiet and calm
To not awake my wife

Entering the bedroom
Darkness everywhere
And a mosquitoesque
Hum's in the air

Unable to stand the silence
She listens to something
Something irrelevant
Loud trivial noise

This room looks like a tomb
It seems so alien to me
I am not happy
The girl was right

My foot hit an object on the floor
A dull clink in the ongoing hum

Coming nearer to the bed
I can't hear her breathing
Under the light of my igniter
The horror's unleashed

Her face - Pale as ashes
Her body - Motionless
The object on the floor
An empty bottle of sleeping pills

Panic - I call the emergency
Waiting tremulous for help to come
Two men appear in front of me
No medics - Just ordinary personnel

These cases are routine nowadays
No need for a medic
I watch their machine
This black cobra slides down her stomach

Pumpking - Until the stomach's void
That's not the end of their task
Sucking off all the blood
To clean it from all poisons

Lack of emotion by the two men
Indifferent treatment
Without any word
They leave just like they came

The day after the incident
She wakes up but there's no recall

Acting upon me like a zombie
She ignores my constemation
Without rest the display
Still dictates her routine
