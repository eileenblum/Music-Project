One day later
The fire chief comes to visit me
He wants to check my health status
And wants to know

When I would return to work
Right before I could answer
He started to tell me the truth
About our job

The here and now
Is not a sesult of the states' doctrine
It was forced by the people itself

It began as consumerism changed
And everyone wanted everything
Things began to have mass

It all started with photography
And the invention of television
Books just appealed to a few people
So the content got reduced

From abstracts to headlines
Simply to have a blowoff
The world moved faster
And it was easier to watch the TV

Classics of literature were shortened to a one-page digest
In a lexicon to make sure that no one is left behind

The ongoing growth of mass media
Seemed to reach more people
The comprehension was easier
Because of the explanations were shallow-brained

Why should anyone learn anything
When it's enough to press a button?
There's no room for profoundness
In these restless days

The here and now
Is not a result of the states' doctrine
It was forced by the people itself

You see there is nothing necessary about books
On their pages you won't find any answers
They'll only confuse you
