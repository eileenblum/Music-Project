It's a desire to set a blaze
See the fire rise
The beauty of destruction

Something turns from white into black
Then it fades away
So fascinating and so beyond belief

It's in the nature of mankind to feel this way
An inborn captivation

In a time where reading is illegal
And even having books is prohibited
Literacy is oppressed
The termination of having a mind on one's own starts

Loss of identity
Mass conformity

The roll of mass media grows
The display dictates the routine

There is information everywhere
Trivial or fundamental?
The line becomes thinner
Friends and relatives are networked digitally

The changes in the world affected the activities of the firemen
Instead of choking fires they start fires to burn the unlawful books

Like a circus show
People on the streets are watching the firefighters march out
The books are put on a pyre and then the fire releases
The stench of burning thoughts
