After the fire chief left
I am totally perplexed
Was it true was he said?
Is a book just an unimportant absurdity?

The young girl comes to my mind
She seemed to be so frank
With an open heart for everything

I can't resist no longer, I open a book and read
Letter by letter - Word by word
From the outset, there's so much going on in my head

I feel emotions - I've never felt in my life
New thoughts sprout in my mind
These words are so powerful - So full of life

I come to the conclusion
That I haven't learnt reading
To decode billboards and I haven't learnt orthography
Just to write short messages

My wife can't understand my behavior
She packs her things and abandons me

Her belief in the system is too strong
The hardest part of the circumstance is:
After the slamming of the door
She will forget about me

The girl knows more about me
Than my wife ever did
What was the basis for our marriage?
I can't remember...

I become aware of so many things
It's like I've just started to think
I think therefore I am
Reading fills the void I have always felt

People aren't happy these days
The media blocks them from thinking on their own
That's why they can't realize
That they are thoroughly distraught
