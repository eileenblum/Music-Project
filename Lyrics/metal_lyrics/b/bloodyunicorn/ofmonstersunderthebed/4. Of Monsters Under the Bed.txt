Cold,
It's cold inside this room
Relics of a broken mind
Reflection cracked
I can't see my eyes
Who have I become?
Monster is growing within
I can't control him
He's feed by who I am
My heart is black
I can't run away from this

I was the little girl scared of
Monsters under her bed
And I couldn't sleep without
My little Teddy Bear
And I used to pray the God
Not to become one of them

I can hear the scratches underneath
It has always been the one I'm afraid of
I embrace my inner destiny
I'm no more
The Teddy Bears' little girl

I was the little girl scared of
Monsters under her bed
And I couldn't sleep without
My little Teddy Bear
And I used to pray the God
Not to become one of them
