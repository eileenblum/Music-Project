Peace is for the weak
Strength is for them who live
Above us all
And being afraid is not contemplate
In this world of lions and sharks
That are searching for the outsider

War is on our shoulders
Claiming for sacrifices
Begging for the mercy
Faith is on her knees again

From the ashes we will rise
Burn the world and sacrifice them
Lion for lion
Eyes to eyes
Rivers of blood are going to scream

Flames in the sky
Are dancing on our heads
Waiting for us to be dead and
To take our place in this world
Full of monsters and demons
Waiting for us all
To be condemned

War is on our shoulders
Claiming for sacrifices
Begging for the mercy
Faith is on her knees again

Our demise is now near
You've taken everything for granted
Now it's time to pay
Don't try to run away

Dead sky upon us
Head faith in humans
Dead moon upon us
had faith in humans
Dead sun upon us
Had faith in humans
