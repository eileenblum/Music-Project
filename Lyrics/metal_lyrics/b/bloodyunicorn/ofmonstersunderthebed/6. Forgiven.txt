Rotting away, day after day
Putrescent flash among the flames
My nostrils burn
The smell's too strong
My lungs are suffering
Life is too long, death never come
Rest in peace in your tomb
Running away, day after day
A day in Earth, a Hell in our hearts

Condemned the rich, killing the poor
No one is left in their home
The Earth is dying, no one is crying
Money spent on guns and breads
Too many people dead for freedom
Anorexia of the brains
No heroes needed, love is injected
Happiness inside the veins
On our knees in front of God
Humanity can only laugh
Being judged, being condemned
Is too late for turning back

Don't surrender to the hate
There's still a chance to survive
Believe it or not, there's a light
Follow me
I'll be your guide in this world
Through the ruins will go
Until the time will come for us
To save them all
And we'll light a candle to the storm
Raising a rose under the snow
Drifting away from darkness
'Til the sun will shine again

We will rise from the ashes
Like a phoenix we will fly again
The candle is still burning
We will rise from the ashes
Nothing is dead yet
We can be forgiven
We can not be forget
