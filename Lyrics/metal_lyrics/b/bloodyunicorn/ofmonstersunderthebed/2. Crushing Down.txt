God wasn't here for me
And I'm tired of suffering
My brain isn't helping me
It's killing me from within
Pain is crushing in
Ripping off the body
As I can't leave my bed
And all I wan't is to be dead
To be dead

This isn't life for me
I can't go on like this
I went down and down
Crushing on the ground
Can you feel my anger?
The hate I feel for life
I used to be the wolf here
And I've been eaten by the bears
Down again on my knees
I pray a god that doesn't exist

Happiness is crying now
And I wonder how you came
In this desert of hearts
I'm dealing with

Screaming and no one's hearing
Dancing on the edge of the void
I can't face all my fears
Am I just a tourist here?

Crushing down
On my knees again
Searching for an answer
That will never come
Please, mom, forgive me
For what I've done
