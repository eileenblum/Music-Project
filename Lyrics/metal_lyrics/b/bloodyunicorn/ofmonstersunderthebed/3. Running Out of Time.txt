Time is fleeting
Our memories are fading away
All the chances I had
Never took me away
I can't define myself alive
I can't go on like this anymore

Dashing under water
I'm drowning
How can I breath
Please, lead me
On my path
So teach me
How to swim among my memories
I'm running out of time

I am dreaming
The stars are waiting for me
All the love I get
Is my salvation from this
I will define myself alive
I'll fly to moon for the last time

Ground is breaking
Under my feet
And I'm waiting here
For her to set me free
On the wings of death
I can be alive again
I can remember me

Dashing under water
I'm drowning
How can I breath
Please, lead me
On my path
So teach me
How to swim among my memories
I'm running out of time
