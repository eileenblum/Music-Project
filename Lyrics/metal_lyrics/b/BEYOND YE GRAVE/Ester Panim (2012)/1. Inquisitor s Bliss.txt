I am here to make you suffer
I am the satanic tool
Crucifix is on my chest
But the devil is in my heart

I am the maker of supreme will
I will wash your sins away
By iron, by fire
I will clean up your worthless soul

Kneel before me!
For you have sinned against God!
Confession through torment
Salvation through death

For the sake of beggaring God you must be trailed
For expiation of your sins, you must endure the torments

Screaming for clemency - sounds so sweet
Heavens are deaf to your prays
But I can hear you very well
Your screams are music to my ears
