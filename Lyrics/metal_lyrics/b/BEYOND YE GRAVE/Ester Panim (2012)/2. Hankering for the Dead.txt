I am obsessed with morbid hunger
To penetrate the rotting flesh
The flesh that once was full of life
But now it's just some bitter meat
Silent cemetary night
Here my lust will be pleased
Alcohol is in my veins
And I am hankering for the dead

Perverted ecstasy, sex with the corpse
Devilish pleasure of sin
My dick is ready to enter the cold cunt
Lifeless bitch can not refuse
Smell of decay driving me insane
Revulsion - the infernal delight
Rising madness charming my mind
A malicious rite now begins

Dead flesh around my dick - unholy coitus
Disrespect to her body - no adoration, just fuck!
Emptiness in her eyes, no pleasure or pain on her face
She will accept all I give

Hankering for the dead
Hankering for the dead
Hankering for the dead
Hankering for the dead

Necrotic orgasm, my semen is spilled
It will not give any life
Drunk and thrilled I'm getting out from the coffin
The sacrilegious rite is now done

I am obsessed with morbid hunger
To penetrate the rotting flesh
The flesh that once was full of life
But now it's just some bitter meat
Silent cemetary night
Here my lust was pleased
Another slut has taken
My seed in the rotten womb
