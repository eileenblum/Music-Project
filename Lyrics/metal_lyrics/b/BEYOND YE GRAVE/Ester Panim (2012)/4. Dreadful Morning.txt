Ruined inside, cannot remember my name
Cannot remember what happened last night
Morning distress - unthinkable damage
I just want to find some fucking rest

Pain all over my body
Cannot walk or even speak
Everything makes me sick
Fuck life, I want to die!

Dehumanized! The swine in mud
My body is completely poisoned
I damn the day I was born
And wait for the end

Tremors in my hands
Burning in my brain
Venom in my blood
Terror in my mind

I wish to close my eyes forever!
I want to be far away from this filthy life
Let my flesh give food to worms
Let my soul dissolve in the void

Tremors in my hands
Burning in my brain
Venom in my blood
Terror in my mind

Silence is all I want to hear
Void is all I want to see
No joy no sorrow I will feel
In the place where no life dwells
