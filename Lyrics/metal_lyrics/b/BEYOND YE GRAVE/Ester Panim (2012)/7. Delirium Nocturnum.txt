In the black dungeon I am one with my lunacy
My blood is poisoned as well as my mind
Walls are starting to move, the shadows now alive
Voices call my name, I hear them clearly

I am falling deeper into dementia!
Frightful phantoms of the dark world around me
My tortured mind is trying to deny this
But all I see is so real

Place of grotesque and insanity
Decadence and delirium
Degradation and obscurity
Shaking frenzy in hell

Gruesome visions from the darkside
Daemons of hell are cheering my name
Serpents and maggots are under my skin
Fits of mad laughter, and blasphemy

My body is scared but my soul is prepared
To take part in an insane ceremony
Unholy debauchery with the creatures from the dark side
I see the whole hell before my eyes

In the black dungeon I am surrounded by the purest madness
I am standing in the middle of hell
Daemonic howling and smell of death
Satan calls my neme, I hear him clearly
