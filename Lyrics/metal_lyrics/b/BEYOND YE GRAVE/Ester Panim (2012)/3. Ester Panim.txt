Dreadful dawn of non-existence
Where death replaces life
The reaper's scythe is cutting the skies
This is the funeral of paradise
Daemons ride the wings of wrath
Across the darkened landscapes
Eclipse is hiding the face of your god
For the last time
Evil came to take your lives
Invasion from the other side
Ceremony of destruction
The world now goes to termination
The light of God is no longer bright
Straight from God came the weakness
Demolition and conclusion
The edge of darkness is in sight
Ester Panim - world demise
Ester Panim - fall of the goodness
Ester Panim - death of all life forms
He who dwelt in the land of nowhere
Now arising for revenge
Merciless and sinister
The end of the world he brings
Evil prophecies made flesh
Your worst nightmares became true
This is the end of your fucking race
And there's nothing your god can do
Blackest dawn - the sun shines no more
Total death - assault of evil
Angels are dying, Satan laughs
God is hiding his face in fear
The final battle - supreme warfare
Ancient evil came to reign
Hope are buried in ashes
The endless night at last is here
