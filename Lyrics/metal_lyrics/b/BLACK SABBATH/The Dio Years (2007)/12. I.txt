I am anger under pressure
Lost in cages, a prisoner
The first to escape
I am wicked, I am legion
Strength in numbers, a lie
The number is one

I - I - I
Everything that I see is for me

Yes, I am giant, I'm a monster
Breaking windows in houses
Buildings of glass
Rebel, rebel, holy outlaw
Ride together
Don't try it, the power's in one

I - I - I
I am standing alone but I can rock you
I - I - I
On the edge of the blade
But the knife can't cut the hero down

I am virgin, I'm a whore
Giving nothing, the taker
The maker of war
I'll smash your face in
But with a smile
All together
You'll never be stronger than me

I - I - I
Right here on my own but I still rock you
I - I - I
Don't follow behind just leave me on the outside
I - I - I
I am standing alone but I can shock you
I - I - I
On the edge of the blade
But no one makes the hero bleed
( No, no , no )

I am hunger
Feed my head
All together
You'll never, never make the hero bleed
( No, no, no)
