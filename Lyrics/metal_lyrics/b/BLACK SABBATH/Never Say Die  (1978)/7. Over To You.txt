Born in a window
Nobody's fool
Raised in a prison you called the school

Taught your religion
Told what to do
I handed my childhood over to you

Travelling endlessly,
I'm searching my mind
I'm almost afraid of what I will find

Wandering aimlessly,
Oh, what can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

Working for freedom
Fighting your wars
Feeding your children, keeping your laws

Someday you'll suffer
Then what I'll do
I'll hand all your promises over to you

Standing inside myself,
I'm losing control
You made me believe in the stories you told

Waiting impatiently,
What else can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

Sisters of sadness
Sealed in their cell
Whispering secrets
What do they tell?

Mad politicians
Can't tell it true
I handed my children over to you

All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you...
