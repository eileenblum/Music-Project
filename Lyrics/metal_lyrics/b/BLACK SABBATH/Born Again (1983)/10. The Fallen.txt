[Deluxe Expanded Edition Bonus Track][Previously unreleased album session outtake]I'm turning around and around
I'm falling down and there is no sound
I said fear grips my mind tears will make me blind
I'm trapped in a falling dream alone with a silent scream
Tumbling through dead of night I'm falling right out of sight

I'm flying in water it's all around
I'm falling slowly through the ground
Eagles nest nearby deep in my sky
I'm trapped in a falling dream alone with a silent scream
Tumbling through dead of night I'm falling right out of sight

I'm reaching out in the darkness I'm trying to reach for your hand
But every time I get near you you're gone and I don't understand
You know I'm falling, I'm falling it's dark and I'm blind I'm falling, I'm falling
It's night time, the night time, the day life goes on in this rain
It keeps me from flying it leads me to die
I'm trapped in a falling dream alone with a silent scream
Tumbling through dead of night I'm falling right out of sight
I'm dead if I hit the ground
