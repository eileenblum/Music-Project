Well, I'm sick and tired of hearing
'bout the world and hang ups
Gonna get myself together
Take a ride down town
Gotta see my rock'n'roll doctor [3]
I gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away
He makes me happy when
I'm feeling down, yeah
Takes away my worry
Takes away my frown
Gotta see my rock'n'roll doctor [3]
I gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away
If you wanna feel groovy
Give the doctor a call
Yeah!
Doctor rock will help you any time at all
Gotta see my rock'n'roll doctor [3]
I gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away
