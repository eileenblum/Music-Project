I'm just another back street kid
Rock'n'roll music is the only thing
I really dig
Can't stop the music going 'round
Inside my head
I'm a rock'n'roll soldier
Gonna play it until I'm dead
Nobody I know will ever take
My rock'n'roll away from me
Sitting in a back seat
Of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi
Can't remember where I've been playin' my music
Sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars
And thinking 'bout the hand of doom
Nobody I know will ever take
My rock'n'roll away from me
Living life comes easy
If you know which way you're going
Got see yourself in other's eyes surprised
Living like I want to
Don't come easy,but I'm trying
Sorting out what's true
And what are lies, it's wise
Brought up in a back street
Living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my music's
Playing of my tax demands
So listen to the music
Want to see you getting so high
'cause I'm a back street rocker
And I will be till the day
Nobody I know will ever take
My rock'n'roll away from me
