I've been a long,long time
Waiting for you
I didn't want to see you gone, oh, no, no!
And now it's hurting so much
What can I do?
I wanted you to be my wife.
The days are passing slowly
Since you've gone
Your memories are all I have
Yes, I have
I sit here waiting but
You'll never show
Without you I can't carry on
Ooh, my baby!
You said you'd always loved me
All of my life!
And then you said your last 'good-bye',
Yes, 'good-bye'
Why the sudden changes,
Why all of the lies
I should have seen it in your eyes?
The endless hours of heartache
Waiting for you
My summer love has turned to rain
Oh, the pain
The silent emptiness
Of one-sided love
My life means nothing now you're gone!
Ooh, my baby!
