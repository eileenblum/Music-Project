Phantom soldiers marching off to war
Never knowing what they're fighting for
Tell me what decides who has God on their side?
There's no reason, it's the season
Is there any war that is worth dying for?
There's no reason, it's the season of the dead

Death and glory, same old storyline
Children of the future lost in time
Deadly choice of war that kill more than before
There's no reason, it's the season
Dead men don't come back when they're under attack
There's no reason, in the season of the dead

Is this the end of relived glory
Living in this purgatory
King and country, call for sacrifice
Shame or honor is the only choice

Mystic forces on pale horses ride
Bearing hunger, plague and genocide
Senators of state with their prophets of hate
There's no reason, it's like treason
As they light the fuse no one can refuse
There's no reason, it's the season of the dead
