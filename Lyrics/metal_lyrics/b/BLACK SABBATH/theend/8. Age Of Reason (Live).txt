Do you hear the thunder raging in the sky?
Premonition of a shattered world that's gonna die

In the age of reason, how do we survive?
The protocols of evil ravaging so many lives?

Mystifying silence talking peace on Earth
We should judge each other for ourselves
not what we're worth.

Sustainable extinction, a fractured human race.
A jaded revolution disappears without a trace

Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don't bear fruit

These times are heavy and you're all alone
The battle's over but the war goes on

Politics, religion, love of money too.
It's what the world was built for but not for me and you
