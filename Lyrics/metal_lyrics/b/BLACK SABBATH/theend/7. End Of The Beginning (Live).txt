Is this the end of the beginning? 
Or the beginning of the end? 
Losing control or are you winning? 
Is your life real or just pretend? 

Reanimation of the sequence 
Rewinds the future to the past. 
To find the source of the solution; 
The system has to be recast. 

Release your mind. 
Fast forward to the secrets of your code. 
Your life's on overload. 
Delete or save the units
That make you an entity
That's your identity

If you don't know
Which way to go
You may feel lost and confused
A second chance
Your time to lose

Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul. 
Transforming in time and space beyond control; 
Rise up resist and be the master of your fate. 
Don't look back, live for today- tomorrow is too late. 

You don't want to be a robot ghost
Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free

Alright, okay, alright till they set you free
Alright, okay till they set you free

Free, free, I'm free, be free

I don't wanna see you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna see you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
