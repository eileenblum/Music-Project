He's just a loner.
He never says hello.
A friend to no one.
He's got no place to go.

He don't look happy.
He looks through furtive eyes.
He ain't got nothing.
No one to sympathize.

Alright now

He hides himself away.
His secret's not revealed.
As life just passes by
He keeps himself concealed.

A solitary man.
An enigmatic child.
A riddle never solved.
A prisoner exiled.

Alright now

I wonder if the loner can assimilate.
A lifeless lived alone plays devil's advocate.

Come on now

Has he ever tried to be happy?
Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend.

It's getting too late to recover.
He won't stand a chance
And into his own hell he'll descend.

Don't descend. [4x]

No understanding of things we already know.
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go.

Alright, yeah

Communication's an impossibility.
His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy.
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head.
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead.

Come on in
