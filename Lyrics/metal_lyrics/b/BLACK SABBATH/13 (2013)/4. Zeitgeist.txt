Astral engines in reverse
I'm falling through the universe again
Down among a dead man's vision
Faded dreams and nuclear fissions spent

The strings of theory are holding up the race
The puppets falling to the ground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found

On this sinking ship I travel faster than the speed of life
Not so super nova burns
The black holes turn and fade from sight

The strings of theory hide in the human race
The answers buried underground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found

And very soon
The boundless moon
Will show us light
And as we crash
We'll pray and kiss
And say goodnight
Goodnight
