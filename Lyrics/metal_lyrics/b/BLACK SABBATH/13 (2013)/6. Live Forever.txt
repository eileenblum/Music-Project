Just before you die
They say you see your life go flashing by
Cold, dark endless nights
To burn in Hell or bathe in Heaven's light

Well, I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die.
I may be dreaming but whatever.
I live inside a lie!

Days pass by too soon
Waiting for the rising of the moon
No escape from here,
Facing death but is your conscience clear?

I may be dreaming or whatever
Watching my life go by
And I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die!

[Solo]

Well, I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
I may be dreaming, but whatever,
I live inside a lie.

Don't wanna live forever but I don't wanna die [2x]
