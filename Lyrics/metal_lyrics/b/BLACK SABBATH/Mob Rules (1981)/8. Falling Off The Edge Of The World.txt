I think about closing the door
and lately I think of it more
I'm living well out of my time
I feel like i'm losing my mind

I should be at the table round
a servant of the crown
the keeper of the sign
to sparkle and to shine

Never, no never again!
listen to me and believe what I say if you can
Never, this is the end
you know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man
Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain
Save me, take me away
you know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!

I've got to be strong
oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
think you're safe, but you're wrong!
We are falling off the edge of the world!

Look out! there's danger! no where to run!
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done
Over, it's over at last
There's a message inside as we build a new life from the past

We're falling off the edge of the world!
Yes, the edge of the world!
It's the end of the world!
