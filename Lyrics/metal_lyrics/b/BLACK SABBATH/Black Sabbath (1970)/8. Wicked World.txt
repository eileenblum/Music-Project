The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People got to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea
Are counting their dead

A politician's job they say is very high
'Cos he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
While people here on earth are dying of old diseases

A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
He doesn't even know who is his father
