[Spirit:]
Dont you know its a world of wonders
That you live
Theres a strength that can pull you under
And forgive
And it lives in a sky of thunder
And it breathes light in your soul

And the trees and the wind are stroking
And they scream
And beneath you the earth is soaking
Of this dream
Every raindrop is telling stories
And they whisper words in your ear

Hey, donât you see the light?
Donât you feel its might?
Tell me, donÊ¼t you see?
Donât you feel it?
Theres a strength in your veins of glory
And it breathes light in your soul

[Act I ends]
