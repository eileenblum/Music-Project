[Old Man:]
At the break of dawn
She knocked on my door
I was shocked she seemed
So tired and sore

And she said
Itâs been time
For a change for so long
All I know
I have to
I have to move on

And I stood on the porch
Where we used to dance
And the world, somehow,
DidnÊ¼t make any sense.

And so I
Tried to smile
Though I didnât know why
Watched her go
And waved her,
And waved her goodbye

Someday IÊ¼ll meet you,
Someplace Iâll greet you,
Somehow itâll lead you back to me
It may take a lifetime
And be where the stars shine
It may be the place
Where the earth and sky meet

And the years went by
But I did not forget
Her touch, her lips
The words that she said
Suddenly
Just a glimpse
And a warm well known smile
Clear to see
What kept her
What kept her alive

Someday Iâll meet youâ¦

[Choir:]
Someday Iâll meet you
Someplace IÊ¼ll greet you
Somehow itÊ¼ll lead you
Lead back to me

[Old Man:]
Why should I seek
Why should I ask
What should I strive for
If not you

Why should I seek
Why should I ask
Why should I strive
I am a Man

I am the word
I am the deed
I am the heart
Thank God IÊ¼m a Man

I felt the cold
I felt the heat
I felt the love
Thank God IÊ¼m a Man

[Choir:]
Why should I strive
What should I seek if not you
Why should I ask
What should I seek if not you
Why, what should I strive for if not you
