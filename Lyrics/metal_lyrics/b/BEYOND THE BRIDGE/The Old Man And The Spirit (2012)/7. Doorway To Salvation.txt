[Spirit:]
Your sad lit candle
Is guttering
But still wont seize to burn
Enough to seethe
Enough to cry
The cause to breathe
The cause to die

If I should handle
Your muttering
IÊ¼ll call for in return:
Enough to seethe
Enough to cry
The cause to breathe
The cause to die

[Old Man:]
A child
A dream
A womenÊ¼s embrace

A thought
A scream
A comforting face

Two blinks
Three steps
Four words of a phrase
One reason to go on remembering

[Spirit:]
It might seem much
(it might seem much)
But donât condemn me
Just break the crutch
(just break the crutch)
That you call memory

[Old Man:]
Finally! Thereâs a doorway to salvation
Should I trust and yield to this temptation
If I lost my memory
All of my life
Will I still be human:
Curious and free

[Spirit:]
Doubts are shading
As the lights are fading
Go lift the curtain
Now be certain
And see

[Spirit:]
I will be righteous
And measure
The price you have to pay
Enough to seethe
Enough to cry
The cause to breathe
The cause to die

So I am claiming
Your treasure
Of fortune and dismay:
Enough to seethe
Enough to cry
The cause to breathe
The cause to die

[Old Man:]
A kiss
A smile
A cold chill inside

A song
A dance
A word and a ï¬ght

Two hearts
Three lies
Four eyes how they cried
One reason to wipe out and wash away

[Spirit:]
It might seem much
(it might seem much)
But dont condemn me
Just break the crutch
(just break the crutch)
That you call memory

[Old Man:]
Doubts are shading
As the lights are fading
Go lift the curtain
To be certain
And see

[Spirit:]
Finally! Thereâs a doorway to salvation
Let him trust and yield to this temptation
If I will have gained what
Once was his life
I will be like mankind
Curious and free

[Old Man:]
A tear
A touch
A black tie and shirt

A book
A speech
A shovel of dirt

Two stones
Three names
Four cries of a bird
One reason to live and to die at last

[Old Man:]

Finally! Thereâs a doorway to salvation
Its the trust we take from contemplation
Its the strength of memory
And of wondering
Finally theres a doorway
Curious and free

[Spirit:]
Doubts are shading
As the lights are fading
Go lift the curtain
Now be certain
And consign your life to me!
