[Old Man:]
How can a single drop perceive
The whole surrounding sea?
For being part it will receive
A higher cause to be
How can a simple man reveal
The world before he dies?
True spirits, come, hear my appeal
Sever the bonds of lies!

[Spirit:]
I heard your call
IÊ¼m a spirit of ancient days
I know you crawl
In the dust on your hopeless ways
I am your guide
And the answer to your demand
I see the light
See the reasons you know you

[Spirit:]

Canât ï¬nd awareness then
Why dont you
Speak up and ask?

[Old Man:]
I- I want to know
Where I come from, where I go
What I will be able to know

[Choir:]
Hail to thee!
Certainty
Thou art crystal
Tyranny!
Raise thy hands
Esperance
Thou hast shown
We shall crush down
Chance

[Old Man:]
Open my eyes
And let gnosis arise and then
Show me the lines
In the sand

What walks away and leaves
Signs at the bay of faith
Show me the moment when
Light ï¬lled the night
Took on its might
Chased off the fright

Give me a sign
Is there good or divine or is
Random creation
The cause

And say, are we fooled
By religion and ruled by fate
Show me the moment when
Light won the strife
Nurtured to thrive
Breathed and it was life

[Choir:]
Come and dance
Ignorance
Show thy ugly
Countenance!
Be my guest and
Dance!

[Old Man:]
Why donât you speak and respond?

[Choir:]
How can you be sure
That there is
More than you know?
What if you had lost
Lost your way?

[Old Man:]
Reveal it, unseal it
Untie the bonds!
Come show me and take me there!

[Spirit:]
Trust me, I will show
That there is more than you know
Trust me, I will teach you how!

[Choir:]
Hail to thee!
Thou art cruelest uncertainty!
Not to be
Pain and grief begone
Relief me!

[Spirit:]
Leave your eyes and leave your ears
(My reason)
All your senses leave them shut
(My feelings)
Trust your ever faithful fears
(My voices)
And dont yield to reasons smut
(My heartbeat)

[Spirit:]
If you want to face it
You must know
I will be your eyes
And if you trace it
You wonÊ¼t go
Before I advise

[Old Man:]
No! I want to be where
I can feel
The truth on my own
So let me ï¬ee there
And reveal
The answers alone

[Old Man:]
If thereÊ¼s a place
Where I will be aware
Lead me
There is a place
Where I will be aware
Lead me

[Spirit:]
Where do you believe
Will you be able to perceive?
Dare how could it be
In this reality how?

[Old Man:]
I keep on yearning
For mysteries of this world
But hands are turning
As the ages decay
Existence crashes
And everything that Iâve changed
Is dust to ashes

[Old Man:]
I keep on yearning
For mysteries of this world
But hands are turning
As the ages decay
Existence crashes
And everything that IÊ¼ve changed
Is dust to ashes
As it passes by
Show me the place
And I triumph for irreality

[Spirit:]
Trust me, you will see
If you blindly follow me
Trust me, you will feel
What your senses conceal
Trust me, I will show
Where you come from, where you go
What you will be able to knowâ¦

[Choir:]
I, I keep on yearning
But, but hands are turning
Life is ashes to dust,
Is ashes to dust

â¦ and who you are
