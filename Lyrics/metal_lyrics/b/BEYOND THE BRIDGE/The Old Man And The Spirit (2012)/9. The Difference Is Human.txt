[Old Man:]
My heart is a ponderer
My soul is a wanderer
To touch, to be
To feel, to see
The edge of the knife
The difference is human
Is life

[Spirit:]
Now that yourâe close to the key, tell me
Would you halt and send the called away?

[Old Man:]
All my memories of life canÊ¼t die
All my memories of truth canât lie
And my memories of trust deny
That to know is to see

Hear the pulse of my veins at night
Let my will and my thoughts ignite
Why should I seek the truth in light
When the truth is in me

[Choir:]
Tide is turning
No more yearning!

[Old Man:]
All my memories of hope
All my memories of youth
All my memories of cheer
All my memories of truth
All my memories of fear
All my memories of trust
All my memories of lust

[Spirit:]
Never, ever will you see
I will know what you will be

It is all a matter of knowing
When the wind is sprung up and blowing
When the sky is gleaming
Rivers streaming
ItÊ¼s a matter of knowing

There is so much reason to wonder
So much reason to wonder
There is so much reason to wonder
So much reason to ask

[Old Man:]
Stop your fraud! Let it be
Stop your lies!
Your deceit! Let it be
Your disguise
And I thank God I ripped off your mask!

[Spirit:]
Then, pitiful human
You wonât spy the forces inside
And, thank your acumen
You will die, as many have died
Now, pitiful human
Say goodbye

Never, ever will you see
I will know what you will be

You will weep, you will cry
You will be, you will stay
Ever blinded
You will weep, you will cry
You will be, you will stay
Just a Man

You will turn into dust
And so it ends
You will turn into dust
And so it ends

[Old Man:]
All my memories of faith
All my memories of strife
All my memories of hope
All my memories of life
Show itÊ¼s true
What I always knew:

My heart is a ponderer
My soul is a wanderer
My heart is a ponderer
Its the edge of the knife
The difference is life

My heart is a ponderer
My soul is a wanderer
Its the edge of the knife
The difference is life

All my memory of joy is her
All my memory of sense is her
All my memory of life is her
So Im wondering
How could I trade
Whom I loveâ¦?
