[Old Man:]
Tinker tailorâ¦
Hush cant you hear
Words of judgement
Wise and sincere

Every single winter has its spring
I donât care
Everlasting continual ring
I donât care

IÊ¼m so grateful I
Fell and rose and tried
Won and laughed and cried
Lost and swore and lied
Now I have to conï¬de:
I loved
I lived

[Choir:]
â¦ that is all a man can do

[Old Man:]
Soldier, sailorâ¦
Hush canât you hear
Words of wisdom
As it draws near
Have you seen the truth a man can see
I donât care
Have you been the best a Man could be
I donât care

IÊ¼m so grateful I
Fell and rose and tried
Won and laughed and cried
Lost and swore and lied
Now I have to conï¬de:
I lived
It was me

[Choir:]
â¦ that is all a Man can do

[Old Man:]
Those dire grins of mere cognition
I gave my tears to superstition
Those higher spheres, I canât adore them
I save my sins, I canât abhor them

Fell and rose and tried
Won and laughed and cried
Lost and swore and lied
Last eternal pride
To love
To live

[Choir:]
Show me pain that is not true
Show me a sense thatÊ¼s not in you
Show me joy that is not true
Show me a sense thatÊ¼s not in you
Show me pain that is not true
Show me a sense thatÊ¼s not in you
Show me life that is not true
Show me a sense to love to live

[Old Man:]
Hear the voice
TheyÊ¼re haunting me
Never heard
WonÊ¼t let me free
Never felt
So insecure
Hear that voice
Stop and let me breathe!

Finally peace and silence
All around me
Made them hush and killed the
Source inside me
Drowned in madness by the
Force inside me
Finally peace and silence
All around my
Graveâ¦

[Act II ends]
