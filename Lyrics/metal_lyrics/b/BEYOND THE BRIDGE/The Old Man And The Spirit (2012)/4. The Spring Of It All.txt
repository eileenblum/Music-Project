[Spirit:]
There is no place
Where Men could trace
The spring of it all

All you could ï¬nd
Lies here
The world combined
In a grain

It is all a matter of knowing
When the wind is sprung up and blowing
When the sky is gleaming
Rivers streaming
ItÊ¼s a matter of knowing

[Old Man:]
There is no chance
No single glance
At the spring of it all

This paradise
Be it!
All men could rise
But they fall

[Spirit &amp; Old Man:]
It is all a matter of knowing
When the wind is sprung up and blowing
When the sky is gleaming
Rivers streaming
ItÊ¼s a matter of knowing

[Old Man:]
When the sky is gleaming
Rivers streaming
Its a reason to wonderâ¦
