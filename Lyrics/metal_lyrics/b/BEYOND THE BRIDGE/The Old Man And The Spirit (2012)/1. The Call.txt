[Act I begins]

[Old Man:]
Hear the voice
Theyâre calling
And haunting me
Never Heard
Such Questions
WonÊ¼t let me free
IÊ¼ve never felt
So insecure
My peace of mind
Disturbed by the urge to know

I try to see
But I am blind
I try to see
The truth behind
Please come to me
Awareness

I keep on yearning
For mysteries of this world
But hands are turning
As the ages decay
Existence crashes
And everything that Iâve changed
Is dust to ashes
As it passes away

I can feel
My duty
To ï¬nd the key
Missing rules
No order
No sanity
Ive never heard
About this before
My peace of mind
Disturbed by the urge to know

I try to see
But I am blind
I try to see
The truth behind
Please come to me
Awareness

I keep on yearning â¦

I wish my life would disappear
Or merge within a dream
No questions, suffering or fear
A clear, indifferent stream
I wish my light would cease to burn
But yet, my soul is torn
And lets me face my last concern
Why I was even born
