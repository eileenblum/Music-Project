[Old Man:]
Do you really want me to loseâ¦
â¦my Virtues
â¦my Faults and
â¦my Weakness
â¦my Strength and
â¦my Sorrow
â¦my Joy and
â¦my Falsehood
â¦my Truth and

Do you really want me to loseâ¦
â¦my Fears and
â¦my Hopes
â¦my Faith and
â¦my Soul
â¦my Honor
â¦my Shame
â¦my Freedom
Everything you strife for is me

[Spirit:]
Open up your weary eyes
Halt your never-ending and sigh-swollÊ¼n cries
All youÊ¼ve never ï¬outed
You wont owe
All youÊ¼ve never doubted
You wonÊ¼t know

Yourâe crying out in deep despair
As the fair is foul and the foul is fair
You will drown in madness
Once again
And roll up in sadness
Tug you in

Always yearning
Never earning
Always trying
Never ï¬ying

[Choir:]
See the light
Feel its might

[Spirit:]
Youâd leave this sorrow
If you would follow

[Old Man:]
Do you really want me to tradeâ¦
â¦my heart and
â¦my soul and
â¦in life for light?

[Spirit:]
Do you really think that your life is worth it?

[Old Man:]
Beauty and bliss
In the grace of a kiss
And love
Lie in the transience of life

Memories retain
All the moments remain
With me
Why should I trade tell me

Do you really want me to lose my memory?

[Spirit:]
Death comes fast and breaks apart
All the words and pictures in your heart
You will ï¬nd your pain in once shed tears
For what is a grain in endless spheres

[Choir:]
Always yearning
Never earning
Always trying
Never ï¬ying

[Old Man:]
Do you really want me to loseâ¦
â¦my Virtues
â¦my Faults and
â¦my Weakness
â¦my Strength and
â¦my Sorrow
â¦my Joy and
â¦my Falsehood
â¦my Truth and

Do you really want me to loseâ¦
â¦my Fears and
â¦my Hopes
â¦my Faith and
â¦my Soul
â¦my Heart and
â¦my Deeds
â¦my Life and
â¦my Memory

[Spirit:]
Endless spheres
You will ï¬nd your pain in once shed tears
DonÊ¼t turn your back on your

Human destiny
You will die and face eternity
DonÊ¼t turn your back on your

All wrong divine conception
As your striving for perfection
Wonât you feel just like a traitor
Who has tricked his own Creator
Strong with words you draw a curtain
Keeping early scenes uncertain
Now itÊ¼s time to take my guidance
I will show the primal silence

Consign your life to me!
Take my gift and
Rule your destiny
DonÊ¼t turn your back on your
Worthless entity
Donât you see your
Useless way to be
Now take my hand and

Consign your life to meâ¦

[Old Man:]
Life

[Spirit:]
Light!
