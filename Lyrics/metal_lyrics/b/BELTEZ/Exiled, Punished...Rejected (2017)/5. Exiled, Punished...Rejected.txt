Punished in lies - Rebellious Heaven's race
Shame changed into hatred - Awaking
The glory of new dawn - Serves the demon major
Unnamed hordes will follow - The regent prince of Hell

Seas of endless fire - Insane eternal fall
Ignominiousness - The new dawn
Hands upon the fallen - Lords deep into caves
Forced abyssal breeding - The damned ones

Following his fall - From grace upon Acheron

We are Exiled - Punished - Rejected from Heaven
Enthroned age and impale
Thrown down in the abyss - Helos filled with dead gods
And so begins the war

Breading in the past - Towards the winds of future
Regorn reveleation - Holy thorns of fate
Following his fall - From grace upon Acheron
Encompasses the infernal - Outside the walls

Exiled - Punished - Rejected - Heaven's race
Shame changed into hatred - Awaking
The glory of new dawn - Serves the demon major
Unnamed hordes will follow - The regent prince of Hell

Following his fall - From grace upon Acheron

We are Exiled - Punished - Rejected from Heaven
Enthroned age and impale
Thrown down in the abyss - Helos filled with dead gods
And so begins the war
