Hear the - Jarring - Din of - Thousand drums that fill the air
Old as - Hell itself - Pulling - Strings connected to above
Lifetime - Mankind - Design - Physical and spiritual kind
Plain of - Nagrasgritl - Home of - Soul puppeteers sag hrim

Weaving thy souls - Glowing tracery - Alter the psyche
Temptation their way

Ruler of the - Abyss lands - Tinkered with them
And adjusted their minds
Influence - On the weak - Push them on the -
Path that leads them to their fate

Weaving thy souls - Glowing tracery - Alter the psyche
Temptation their way

Under the watcher in the sky
In the vast and empty plains
The torment of the fallen
And the terror of the damned

The scattered fallen ones
Deformed and broken
Their home lost and without reach
No salvation and rest

Deep under a shallow sphere
Where the screams are all and one
Abused and deformed
Punished mortal sins

No hope and no way back
All is gone and further away
No oblivion, no remembrance
Here, where the forsaken dwell
