My body is flesh built with soul-bricks of pain
I've fed it long with a vast line of moaning
Guided through stone halls I fall into dreams of my dusk

My fortress is captured and fate is decided at last
A fire grows hotter but no mouth to cry
As souls flew from their cells
This purgatory shall cleanse my marrow with flames
A fire grows hotter but no mouth to cry
As souls flew from their cells

No gold to pay Charon but only his sins
To enter the 7th circle of fire
He moans as the needle spit outs her load

Baneful - Ships Sail - Towards - Adamantinarx

Canvas in the fog
Red glowing spume
Fires in the night
Bells chime abyssal bright
Shadows watch
The arrival of one soul
Longing of the revenge for sins

My body is flesh built with soul-bricks of pain
Vision gets blur as the flowing grows on
A passageway to the ninth
A fire grows hotter but no mouth to cry
As souls flew from their cells

My fortress is captured and fate is decided at last
A fire grows hotter but no mouth to cry
As souls flew from their cells
This purgatory shall cleanse my marrow with flames
A fire grows hotter but no mouth to cry
As souls flew from their cells

No gold to pay Charon but only his sins
To enter the 7th circle of fire
He moans as the needle spit outs her load

Baneful - Ships Sail - Towards - Adamantinarx
