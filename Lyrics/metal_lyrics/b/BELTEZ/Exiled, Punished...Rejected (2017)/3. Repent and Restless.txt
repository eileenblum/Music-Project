An ancient and bitter memory
Surrounded in the smoke
Nightmares rear out of scale
In this sulfurous landscape

Against the hideous figure
Composed of thousands of flies

Glorious battle
Final March
To the war gate of Dis
Demon major - Sargatanas
The repent and restless
He has not forgotten
Where he came from
Never accepted his lot
Legion of damned souls
Hand in hand
With the banished and fallen ones

Reign over their freedoms - Tormenting the damned
Become the ruling class - Adding to their wealth

Heaven's former warriors - After the war
Reign over their freedoms - Tormenting the damned

Against the hideous figure
Composed of thousands of flies

Glorious battle
Final March
To the war gate of Dis
Demon major - Sargatanas
The repent and restless
He has not forgotten
Where he came from
Never accepted his lot
Legion of damned souls
Hand in hand
With the banished and fallen ones
