Take a look at my life
Tell me I'm alright
You know not of this war that I fight in my head
The world would be better off if i were dead

Fuck the world

It all ends the same

I've become the man I fucking hate
I don't know how much more I can fucking take
I'm all alone in this world
I need to end this fucking quarrel

I fucking hate myself
I fucking hate this world
Fuck the world
We are all worthless pieces of fucking shit

Fuck the world

Gun to my head,
I'm no longer my friend,
just watch me end this fucking war in my head

Fuck the world
We are all worthless pieces of fucking shit
