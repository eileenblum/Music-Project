[feat. Nick Of Molotov Solution]You're illusions of a deity are so fake
I can not comprehend with all this shame
I'm not seeking an outlet
I don't need rebirth
I'm fine way I am
I don't need your faith

It's all in your head
When you die, you're dead
It's all in your head
[2x]

The world was a shitty place from the start
We don't need your plague running through our hearts
[2x]

(Nick)
Injected with the filth that flows from you mouth
Repetitive, plagiarized man in the clouds
There will be no savior
Condemn the pope
You speak no truth
There is no hope

Death smiles at all of us
But we won't live our lives in fear
Though your prophecies say the end is near
Death smiles at all of us
&amp; we're the ones who fucking smile back

It's all in your head
When you die, you're dead
It's all in your head
[2x]

Line them up, one by one
Feed them your book of lies
Tell these children there's a life waiting when they die
[2x]

The world was a shitty place from the start
We don't need your plague running through our hearts
[4x]
