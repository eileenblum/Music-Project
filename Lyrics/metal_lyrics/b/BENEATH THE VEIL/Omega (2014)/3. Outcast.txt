[feat. Riggs Of Kingmaker]Battles rage on, the war in my head.
These contemplations, never end.
Soldiers line up, one by one.
I just want it to be done.

This life was not made for me
Dead by 25 is all I'll ever be
I can't see myself alive for more
And watch the world thirst for gore

No one will help me in this fucked up world

I mean nothing and I'm not worth saving

Tell me things that will rot in my brain
Keep me thinking, keep myself sane
My disease will spread to those around me
Poison their minds with irrational thinking

This life was not made for me
Dead by 25 is all I'll ever be
I can't see myself alive much longer
As I kill all those around me with disease and hunger

All my life I've been treated like the outcast
Never had any friends, no one had my back
But now I'm older and I truly have seen
The knife in my back is all you will mean

Everyone is gone
No one lasts forever
Things are so fucked up
In this plague I call my life
I'm all alone
Im all by myself

Outcast
I will never be anything
Outcast
This is my ending
