You are an immoral human being
Spitting me out like you know everything

Telling me to quit these things like you are all seeing
How can I feel sorry for you if you weren't there for me?
Leaving me and my family like it's a welcoming feeling?

And yet you sit there lonely and repressed
I'm not the one that's stressing
I'm not the one that's depressed

This is the choice you made, it's time to celebrate your life in failure

Clenching my teeth to hold myself back, you put me down like a hound when it was me who kept you in tact

Kept you in tact

This is the choice you've made, it's time to celebrate your life in failure

Clenching my teeth to hold myself back, you put me down like a hound, when it was me who kept you in tact

Kept you in tact

Your Father Figure has failed
it's time for you to realize what I sincerely call rage
