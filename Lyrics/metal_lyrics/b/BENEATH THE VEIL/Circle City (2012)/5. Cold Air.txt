You have lost us all
take a step back and check yourself
we trusted in you and you broke our pact

I hope you rethink your lies
Before they snap and turn on you.
I hope you rethink your lies
We wont condone anything you do
We now know that you were never true
We wont condone anything you do
Anything you do

You have forsaken yourself, you have betrayed me.
if I known this would happen
Wed knock you off your God damn feet

You have lost us all
take a step back and check yourself
we trusted in you and you broke our pact
things will never be the same

Capture the pain you caused them including me
you will always be the chip on my knuckle

Dear world, I apologize for the cold air we breathe
Never stab a throned back, never spit on a cold heart

Cold Air

Just know were right 'round the corner.
