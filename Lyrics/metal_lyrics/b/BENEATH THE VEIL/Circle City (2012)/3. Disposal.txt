How many times will this happen to me?
How many times will I burn?
Thrown away and washed down like a leaf in the gutter stream

We were supposed to sail away
Go beyond all wonders
But thatâs just the lie you swore to
The lie you swore to

Your dreams canât bring me back
Donât bother me
Iâm no longer in your wasted life
[2x]

You have no idea how much pain you caused me, we will never be okay

I considered you family, we will never be okay

And to Hell with you
