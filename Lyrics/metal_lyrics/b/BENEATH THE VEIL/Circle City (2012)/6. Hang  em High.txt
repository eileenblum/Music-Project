Time spent, dreams crushed these walls you built to guide my way have only set me up for failure
Mind bent, Fists clenched, no respect nor equality has ever come from you
Mind bent, Fists clenched, no respect nor equality has ever come from what you tell me time and time again
How can I move on? You framed and you mocked me
Tell me to step back
Tell me I'm wrong like you always do

You all act the same, you think you're everything, though I see no crowns [2x]

All I see is the start of a hopeless generation.
You stand for everything I stand tall against
You despise what I love, I adore what you hate
Your arrogance is what sets us apart
You are the reason there are people like me
You despise what I love, I adore what you hate
You are the reason there are people like me
Your arrogance is what sets us apart
You are the reason there are people like me [2x]
