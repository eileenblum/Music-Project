Mankind can not bear much more of this reality.
Beyond the dead sits an empire thriving upon internal reign.
You wear no crown of power.
No one claims you to be king.
So why must I listen to your every word?
I'm not listening to anything or anyone.
All of my actions go against your every word and I believe it's time for you to sit back and listen.
You reign sickened with eternal rage.
We as a broken nations youth will no longer stand for it's oppressors, it's unjust law, and unfair rule.
Words that are put into our mouths will be spat out and seen as blasphemy.
For we are not blind. We are not deaf. We are not sick. And we surely are not weak.
For here tonight, we are a family.
And here tonight,
WE WILL SHOW YOU THE TRUTH!
Don't you close my eyes.
Don't you shut my lips.
Don't you break me down.
Don't you dare.
We the people will rise up as one.
You will see what this world hides from you.
