I am not ashamed of you.
Broken, I then saw a light brighter than an darkness.
We are the giants of the sky and we've come here tonight to gain some ground.
I'm not ashamed of you.

Lend me your ears, we live in desperation and misery for all to see.
But we push on for the truth in this world.

Lost in your mind. Your morals mix with your intuition.
Lost in the skies. The constellations begin to fall.
And so steadfast and become something that will never change, immovable.

It is sown within our dishonor and it is raised in our glory.
By these words I love.

We will bring forth the end of this world for an eternal weight to be lifted from our shoulders.
Every single word that has ever been said will be taken from the lips of the man who decided that enough was enough.

This is my life. My glory. My one chance at freedom.
This is my life. My glory. Don't try and take that away.

Oceans are only numbers.
Once you've been carried away, I'll send my regards.

So they say that one day the skies will fall.
I take heed to your persecution.
However, the rubies of your broken world will come to an end before you.

This is a declaration.
These are words of hope.

I swear to you I'll never sleep!
With these words I declare, stand your ground.
