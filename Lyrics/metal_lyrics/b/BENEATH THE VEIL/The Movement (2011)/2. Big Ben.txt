Imma keep hitting you where it hurts.
I think I've found your weakness.
Just keep running your mouth old friend.
I'll keep you on your toes.

Shut your mouth or I'll give you something to say.
You're a liar. You're a fake. But I'll never let you stay in my way.
This is the path I'll take and these are the choices I'll make.

And to those who have doubted me, look who's laughing now.
I come to you with these broken bones ready to feel the pain.

I've come to win 'cause I refuse to lose.
I'm taking the crown without regards towards you.
I'm not sorry for the things I've done so stop asking for apologies.

Now let's take two steps back and watch this unfold, it's the end of everything that you know.
My time's well spent if you're put back into your place and your feet are rooted deep within the ground your meant to be.

I don't want to rest and take it slow.
I will not sit this out and breathe.
I want it all [2x]

Stay away from me.
You're not worth my breath so I won't say a word.
You're not worth my time so I won't waste another day.
I try take life as it passes me by.
I'll take a tooth for a tooth.
I'll take an eye for an eye.
But now I know you're not worth it to me.
But now I know that it's your time to leave.
No one ever said living would be easy but I'll make your life a living hell if you mess with me.

Now there's no need for disrespect.
I've come to win 'cause I refuse to lose.
I'm taking the crown without regards for you.
You want me to respect your words? Well stop there 'cause you've stepped out of line. Now we'll watch you fall.

Now you better hope that I don't find you out at night because
I'll replace your teeth with the curb of the sidewalk.
You and me, one on one.
I'll drop you right here, right now
