Forgotten structure
Of concrete and steel
Around an industrial chimney
Of concrete and steel

Rusted architecture
Of iron and dust
Around an acid pit
Of iron and dust

I feel His presence

Two Columns - One Gate
Two Towers - One Way
One NeXus - One Gate
To the Other Side

Where they see a ruin
I see a Temple,
Where they see dust and rust
I see dark beams of Satanic gold

I feel His presence

Two Columns - One Gate
Two Towers - One Way
One NeXus - One Gate
To the Other Side

In the arkness
I walk slowly
And feels demons around me

In the industrial fog
I breathe carefully
And feels demons around me

Industry is your Temple !

Oh SataN, there is
Your real Temple
Enslaving humans
For your coronation
There you are, churches are empty
Here I feel you
I watch the industrial land
And obviously...
There is no God... but you !

Forgotten structure
Of concrete and steel
Around an industrial chimney
Of concrete and steel

I feel His presence

Two Columns - One Gate
Two Towers - One Way
One NeXus - One Gate
To the Other Side
