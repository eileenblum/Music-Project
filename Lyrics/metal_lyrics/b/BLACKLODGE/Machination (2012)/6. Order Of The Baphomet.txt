Weaving spiders come not here
Kidnapping their breed
Sexual flesh toys to abuse
Under the bloody eyes of...
...Moloch
The owls are not what they seem
Cremation of care
Hermes trismegistus networking
In the orgy of the Bacchus feast
Kidnapping the bloody eyes of...
...Moloch

Make it secret
Make it dark
The Master's triumph to spark
Conspirate in the lodge
Colored black
Trick and deal for the sake
Of the snake and fake
To feel to rake and seal
The Master's throne to rise

Order of the Baphomet

Make them believe
That the Devil does not exist

All religions
All kingdoms
Pledge allegiance
To the Temple of Solomn
Black magic
Reptile blood
Pledge allegiance
To the Temple of Salomon

G.O.D.Guns.Oil.Drugs.

A poisonous TridenT
Offered to humans
So the order reigns

Divide and conquer

Order of the Baphomet
Under the bloody eyes of...
...Moloch

Make it secret
Make it dark
The Master's triumph to spark
Conspirate in the lodge
Colored black
Trick and deal for the sake
Of the snake and fake
To feel to rake and seal
The Master's throne to rise
