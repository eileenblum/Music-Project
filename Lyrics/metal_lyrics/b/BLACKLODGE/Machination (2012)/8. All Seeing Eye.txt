Facing the Isis priestess,
At the heart of the pyramid
Facing fire,
I pledge my allegiance to LucifeR
Let me burn
In the Mysterious Grail
To unveil with the chosen ones
The secret of the SphinX

Challenge yourself
And pass the Pearly Gates,
Under the control
Of the All Seeing Eye
Stream of counsciousness
To cross, to be initiated
Into the Divine
Under the control
Of the All Seeing Eye

Pledge allegiance
To the light above the Triangle,
The Only Real God

I deny God
I reject the religions
Of the Book
I want knowledge and power
Take my soul

Within the fear
He's watching you
Fear to keep you under control
Fear is the key to all powers

Challenge yourself
And pass the Pearly Gates,
Under the control
Of the All Seeing Eye
Stream of counsciousness
To cross, to be initiated
Into the Divine
Under the control
Of the All Seeing Eye

For knowledge and power
I give my soul
To the All Seeing Eye
For knowledge and power
I give my soul
To the All Seeing Eye
