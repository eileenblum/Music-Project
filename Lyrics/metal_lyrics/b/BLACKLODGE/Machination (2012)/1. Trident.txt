Abyss of Hell, black storms,
Primeval deity
Boundless chaos of darkness
And a thousand serpents
Medusa, hail MedusA,
Hypnotizing void
Primordial ocean,
From where its shadow rise
I see it, terrifying dissolvent

Defying towers of metal
And a thousand slaves
Caesar, hail CaesaR
Violent and merciless
Prince of this world
I see it, cruel and arrogant

Psilocybin unveiling
The terrifying gates
To the Other Side
Borderline between worlds,
Facing the void of darkness
I open my eyes, ecstatic but vigilant
I see it, raised and silent
I see a Trident !

Three faces of Satan
Three sides of the prism
The letter shin, pointing
To the Temple of Solomon
The glorious key
To the All Seeing Eye

Morning star of fire
And a thousand secrets
LuficeR, hail LucifeR
The greatest of All Angels, shining
I see it, charming, incandescent

Medusa.Caesar.Lucifer
H.I.M.
