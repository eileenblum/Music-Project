First, spilling blood on your door
Then giving unbearable
Pictures to your children
Fear is the door to Evil intents
Even your shadow
Will feel insecure

Let the fear grow in you
Take risks, I'm watching you

Second, bring in your house
Dead animals
Give candies
To your mesmerized children

Let the anger rise in you
Drink alcohol, I'm watching you

Black demons are called
Slithering into your soul
Under my will
Tasting like arsenic
You'll dig your own grave
Through my command

Neo black magic
Evoke, the Fallen One
Neo black magic
Invoke, and He has won
Praise, die &amp; erase !

You are a prey
For SataN's dagger

I'll cut your cocaine
With strychnine
So much chemicals
To take your life away
Blowing up your veins
With special junk
You'll kill yourself
To satisfy my anger

Let despair flow in you
Take drugs, I'm watching you

I'm always behind you

Black demons are called
Slithering into your soul
As SataN shades
The colour of my will
You'll dig your own grave
Through my command

Neo black magic
Evoke, the Fallen One
Neo black magic
Invoke, and He has won
Praise, die &amp; erase!
