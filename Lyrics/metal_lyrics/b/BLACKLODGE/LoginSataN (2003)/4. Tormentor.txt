Black leather bastard walks the Jacky ride
Drunk up to the score, toxic daemons aside
Grey dull town, bitches around,
Drugs for the entertainment ground
Fucked up brain of the grinning dirt face
Bithes around, grey dull town,
Just wanting to shut up this grinding sound...
shinning black tonight, Sathanas kicks your ass

Hard to breath, heart is pulsing dark,
May the white devil trippin' back his path
White powder to sniffheads, sick, high
Satan rocks the nose plug trainroads !!!
Straw-ways to heaven ...Facing him again in the mirror...
Here is He, Heresy Whippin' the junk a slave to be
Rockin' to the Death Pulse
Satan's Poison
Here is the great Tormentor!!!

Hard to see, nerves are pulsing black,
May the corridor leads the fog back its path
Toxic mist necrosis the lug suffers
Bang the brain, open the gates Funeral fog...
the dragonized worm ...Facing him again in the mirror...
Here is He, Heresy Whippin' the junk a slave to be
Rockin' to the Death Pulse
Satan's Poison
Here is the great Tormentor!!!

Oh Feelin' Dizzy?????
Loaded on LSD.... Ecstasy Ecstasy
Sniff the vermin Worm cocaine
OD got your soul
Sold out for Rock'n' Roll!!!!!!
TORMENTOR?????????????????????
