Fill my heart with pain, I'm falling down
Rest and weak
In the depths of night

Lost in the universe, I'm despiseful dust
Shame and suffering
In the breath of God

Absurd existence, an error in absolute darkness

Feel my heart in pain, I'm rising sun
A will in steal
In the depths of might

Host for the hatred, I'm crawling lust
Dream and conspiracy
In the Death of God

Absurd existence, an error in absolute darkness

Maze of infinity, I want out
Death to humanity, I will shout
Nothing is sacred except my deepest will
I'll give a name to SataN in steal

Obedience

SataN, reflects and mirrors
Hellish room with no door
I'll be the blade in the flesh of society

Leviathan, vomit and blood
Oceans of pain flood
I'll be curse for humanity
