Can you dare her breath
Bow to the Empress
Can you taste her death
Bow to the Empress
Immortality!

Feel her voracious kiss
Raining in our throat
Erasing the pain
Lusting the colors

Sinless is my Empress
Nevertheless Satan's Ace
Her kiss of death
White faith, above the human mess
Snow dress, Angel case

Oh magic mirror
Tell me who is the one
Straws are stairways to heaven
Stairways to heaven
Majestic doors
Stonedust is the key to...Fire!

No more regrets, no more pain
In the dust is my crown
In your shadow daemons grown

Dead.
