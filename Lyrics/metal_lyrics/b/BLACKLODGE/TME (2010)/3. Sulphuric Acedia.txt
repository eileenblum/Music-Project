Blackening, obviously there to fall
Into The Dark Night of the Soul
Descent into Saturnine melancholia
Tragic echoes from Inanna

The terror of the night
The arrow that flies by day
The pestilence that stalks in darkness
The destruction that wastes at noonday
[Psalm 91:5,6]

As a dark depression
Falling into a sea of poison
Sadaverine from Capricorn
A descent into Chaos Aeon
Black, is the gate to Perfection
A temple for destruction
A coffin prepared by Typhon
Black is the gate called Putrefaction

Blacker than the blackest black
Caput Corvi, Vision from schizophrenia
Dissolving, sulphuric Acedia
Confrontation with the Prima Materia
In search for the jewel hidden in the Toad's head
Leading to the secret of V.I.T.R.I.O.L.

My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto Death [Matt 26:38]
Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities! All is vanity [Eccl 1:2]
What does man gain by all toil at which he toils under the sun [Eccl 1:3]

My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto Death [Matt 26:38]
All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing [Eccl 1:8]
What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; and there is nothing new under the sun [Eccl 1:9]
