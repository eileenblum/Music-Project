And on the seventh day there went forth from the presence of God a mighty angel, full of wrath and consuming, and God gave unto him the dominion of the outermost sphere.
Eternity brought forth time; the boundless gave birth to limit; being descended into generation.
As lightning I beheld SataN fall from heaven, splendid in strength and fury.
Among the Gods is none like unto Him, into whose hand are committed the kingdoms, the power and the glory of the worlds;
Thrones and empires, the dynasties of kings, the fall of nations, the birth of churches, the triumphs of time.
They arise and pass, they were and are not; the sea and the dust and the immense mystery of space devour them.
Many names hath God given him, names of mystery, secret and terrible.
God called him SataN the Adversary, because matter opposeth spirit, and time accuseth even the saints of the Lord.
And the Destroyer, for his arm breaketh and grindeth to pieces; wherefore the fear and the dread of him are upon all flesh.
And The Avenger, for he his arm breaketh and grindeth to pieces; wherefore the fear and the dread of him are open all flesh.
And the Avenger, for he is the anger of God; his breath shall burn up all the souls of the wicked.
And the Sifter, for he straineth all things through his sieve, dividing the husk from the grain; discovering the thoughts of the heart; proving and purifying the spirit of man.
And the Deceiver, for he maketh the false appear true, and concealeth the real under the mask of illusion.
And the Tempter, for he setteth snares before the feet of the elect: he beguileth with vain shows, and shall enter in at the beautiful gates.
For SataN is the doorkeeper of the temple of the King:
He standeth in Solomon's porch; he holdeth the keys of the sanctuary;
That no man may enter therein save the Anointed, having the arcanum of Hermes.
[Anna Kingsford "Clothed with the Sun"]
