Demonic black pulse of negativity
As an electric shock, back from forbidden arts
My eyes fall in my soul
Can't breath, can't fell, can't live, can't be
All colors turn to terror
A silent scream that would... rumble... the world
Skies strangling, trapped in time loops
Humans turning to incoherent robots
My eyes fall in my soul
Darkness, possessed, obsessed, excess stress
Anguish, paranoia, terror, schizophrenia
The city is a mechanical trap... ruled by howling machines
(As the King, thunderstruck, is the Tower
It's Sinking under, stuck by g power)

Rebel Angels
Cast down into matter unfold
Depraved
Living cells
In flesh mantle, damnation enfolds
The Ones that dare the Sun are meant to...
...Fall
Humiliated in human form
Weight, pain, pressure and friction
Time, limit and constraint, decay and frustration
Reality, Imagination, Others, Nightmares
Don't remember much how the differ
Daily bad trip
Flashbacks, suicide is written everywhere
Their eyes can swallow me, their mouth can swallow me
Their teeth threaten,
Their faces are... skulls
Nowhere to run
Can't escape the room, the outside world is a flesh mixer

For to Him are committed weight and measure and number.
Evils is the result of limitation, and SataN is the Lord of limit.
He is the father of lies, because matter is the cause of illusion.
For the kingdom of SataN is the house of matter
[Anna Kingsford, "Clothed with the sun"]

Rebel Angels
Cast down into matter unfold
Depraved to
Living cells
In flesh mantle, damnation enfolds
Just fool's can't see that plannet Earth is...
...Hell
Humiliated in human form
Weight, pain, pressure and friction
Time, limit and constraint, decay and frustration
