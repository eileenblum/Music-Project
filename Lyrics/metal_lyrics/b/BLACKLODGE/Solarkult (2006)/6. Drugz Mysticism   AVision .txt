Shaking in puke and rejections
Almost dead
Pale skin  Bloody fixed eyes
Staring mad
Grasping at emptiness and dust

Despised
And mocked by the men
Cherished by the Gods
Loading fast a high fix of Meaning
As a
Vision
Absorb. Ingest. Transmit. Revelations
Flooding in blood
Accept. To see. Translate
See through the shape of Worms

Ecstatic trance
Orgasm codes
Schizoid symptoms
Psychosis reflexes
Instinctive extrapolation of Signs
As a
Vision
Leave the fools. These are not
Hallucinations
But pure reality
Flesh in decay
Corrupted blood
Life sweeps away
But your eyes are opened

Don't breath
But listen
Don't explain
But understand
Don't exist
Just see

Absorb. Ingest. Transmit
Revelations
Flooding in blood
Accept. To see. Translate
See through the shape of Worms
