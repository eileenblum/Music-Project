"From within, out of the heart of men,
proceed evil thoughts, adulteries,
fornications, murder, thefts, covetousness,
wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness,
an Evil Eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
All these evil things come from within, and
defile the man."
[Mark,7:21-23]

Satanic principles of Prometheus archetype
Denying sins and forgiveness
Serpent gave humans entheogens
None realm will be ignored
From the experience of Heaven
To the experience of Hell
Catalysed to Ecstasy

"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you mad" [Aldous Huxley]

"For God knows that the day you eat of it
your eyes will be opened, and you will be
like God, knowing good and evil."
[Gen 3:5]

Good and Evil
"For a seer, the truth is that all living
beings are struggling to die. What stops
death is awareness."
[Carlos Castaneda]

Wandering orthogonally to reality
Nomad beyond common perception
Painting the Earth with so called insanity
Breeding new worlds through neurosis
Destruction
Where the fools are blindly crawling lost
To open the gates with lysergic raindrops
Crossing the Styx to defeat the Holy Ghost
To face Satan's throne with an acid heart
Transposed to Divinity
Third Eye Chemistry
Travelling far beyond me
Third Eye Chemistry
