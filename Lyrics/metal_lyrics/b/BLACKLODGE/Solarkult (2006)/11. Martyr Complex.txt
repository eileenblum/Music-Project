Assuming the choice of superior entities
Clear path on the golden ring of tragedy
Pain as a way to experience divinity
Punish the flesh
Name the life guilty

Thy name of persecution calls for fatality
Revolution of the souls for destiny
A Mission overcomes the flesh to be
My voice is theirs so listen to me

Totem my pain

Assuming the choice of superior entities
Divine echoes to rumble next centuries
Accepting the pain to forge ideas
Swallowing all their tragedies

Coincidences as a proof of synchronicity
Details hide the mark of deities
A living book where I read my prophecy
My voice is theirs so listen to me

Totem my pain
Do complain
Convert to my Aim

Recognize
My Godsize
Idealize
My sacrifice
When I bleed for their divine will
Oversized
Ego to rise
Traumatized
Ego from lies
Their prophecy is now fulfilled

Pain Idol for men
Flesh doll for them
NeXus between
Mass faith and
Astral greedy pulse

Martyr Complex

Punishment recognition
Dedicated scarifications
Rapture induction
Metal under flesh = Oblivion
