I don't know why you believe in me
I can't understand it at all
I hope that you'll be there for me
If we should happen to fall

[Chorus:]
Forever you're on our minds
Together we'll spread our wings and fly

The elements can't stop you
You never fail to show
No one goes unnoticed
We never fail to know

[Chorus]

I don't know why you believe in me
I can't understand it at all
We're there to hold each other
And we're not about to fall

[Chorus:]
Forever you're on our minds
Together we'll spread our wings and fly
Far away
From the heart
