The clock strikes the midnight hour
I walk alone in pouring rain
A sudden glance, a brief encounter
I'm not alone for long

[Chorus:]
I see you, you hide behind hypnotic eyes
First glance beyond description
I'm mesmerized
I hear you, you're calling somewhere
in the night
A silent obsession, hiding out of sight

Body heat and eyes of fire
Not being one to look away
Mystique will bring us close together
Bring us together as one

[Chorus]

She holds the key to all unanswered
As in a myth from long ago
You beg release, her eyes say never
It's time that you should go

In deep silence, pressure's mounting
It's not a dream, you scream until
Your fantasy won't last forever.
But no one guarantees it will
