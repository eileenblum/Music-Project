Unholy fighter summoned up for the cause
"Better never expire", he addresses his claws
Slide down real slow, they can be so vain
One less lonely night, you'll get the chance again

All the love and all the glory will be
gone with the dawn

[Chorus:]
Feels alright, wait for the night
Wait for the night to fall
Feels alright, wait for the night
Wait for the night to fall

In touch with reality but it isn't the same
All thoughts run free when they're in
the right frame
Such a worldly nature, see what money can buy
Feel so eccentric, never knew life could
be so kind

[Chorus]

You can have all you want,  you can have
all you need
Never need to explain your reason for greed

[Chorus x2]

Unholy fighter summoned up for the cause
"Better never expire", he addresses his claws
Slide down real slow, they can be so vain
One less lonely night, you'll get the chance again

[Chorus x2]

Wait for the night
Wait for the night
Wait for the night
Wait for the night to fall
