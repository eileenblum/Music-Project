Hard to live
Hard to dream
Always turning
In circles it seems

Victimize
By outside force
You've got nothing
And nothing is yours

You're not blind
Easy to see
You're going nowhere
There's nowhere to be

You can change
Break the ice
I'm no genius
But I may have some advice

[Chorus:]
Listen to me
You're only Black and White
You've gotta try a little harder
You're only Black and White
You've gotta try a little

Harder to live
Harder to dream
Things are never
As bad as they seem

Make mistakes
Take a fall
Better wrong than to be
Nowhere at all

[Chorus x2]

Harder to live
Harder to dream
Gotta go and throw
A wrench in the scheme

Learn to live
Learn to die
You'll never have it
If you don't even try

[Chorus]
