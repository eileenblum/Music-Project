I didn't have to play detective with your words
I didn't have to look for clues
Your big mistake was that you chose
to speak at all
Now we'll play the game
And now you'll lose

[Chorus:]
Go on and tell me
What you feel
Make me believe
In what you see
Go on now, go on
Lie to me

It's gettin' hard to keep a smile from my face
It's gettin' hard to look at you
You've pushed your point until your
story's full of holes
It's one more turn
Of one more screw

[Chorus]

It seems your plans and schemes are
always falling through
Cause I hear everything
You never say

[Chorus]
