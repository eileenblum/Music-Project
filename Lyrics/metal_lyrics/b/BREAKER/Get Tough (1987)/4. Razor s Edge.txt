Gamblin' with my coastal love
But still I'm insincere
Entering the danger zone
To reach new heights of fear

[Chorus:]
You want it, go get it
Yes indeed
Livin' life on borrowed time
So live life dangerously
Catch me if you can
Livin' on the Razor's Edge
Stop me, if you can
I'm livin' on the Razor's Edge

Fast lane isn't fast enough
Don't cross that center line
They'll have to catch me if I'll hang
For steppin' out of line

[Chorus]

Playin' by the rules
Will never get you anywhere
When everything you've worked for
Has vanished in thin air

[Chorus]
