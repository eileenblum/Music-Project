Walk the streets and take a test
Walk alone and place a bet
All these jackals cannot be friends
Those cries for help you'll never send

Slicing through you're so refined
Save your virtues and draw the line
They'll tell you stories of the wealth of crime
Resist temptation and pass em by

Are you rough enough
Are you rough enough

[Chorus:]
You better Get Tough
You better Get Tough
You better Get Tough
You better Get Tough

Through the flames you will arise
A vigilante through civilian eyes
Always there to save the race
Till someone stronger takes your place

Are you rough enough
Are you rough enough

[Chorus]
