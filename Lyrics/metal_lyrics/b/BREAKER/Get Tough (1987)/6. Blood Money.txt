Set sail to the Carribean
Lounging in the South of France
I hold you in such high esteem
When you provide the high finance

[Chorus:]
Don't give me dirty talk
Cause I don't want your love
I want your money . . . Blood Money

In your eyes I see a tear
The cold sweat if I break the bank
The borderline is growing near
With no one but myself to thank

[Chorus]

Investments made, I must insist
To call your bluff, tho' you resist
I live your world, invade your home
Then rob you blind and leave you cold

What was yours is mine
There's a name for this crime
Blood Money

If I want it, I'll just take it
I ain't beggin' for Blood Money
Take it away

Tension as the plot unfolds
I'm hanging by a thread again
Double-crossed by love gone cold
I've left your future in the red

[Chorus]

Investments made, I must insist
To call your bluff, though you resist
I'll live your world, invade your home
Then rob you blind and leave you cold

I'll take what I want
I'll take what I want
What was yours is mine
There's a name for this crime
Blood Money
