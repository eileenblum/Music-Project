Choose your mark among believers weak in spirit
Tear their lives apart there's no limits
Make them fail in all forever
Die wanting it
torture slow and drain them of hope

Full force rage

No heaven is waiting on the other side
Your only chance here is to stay alive
Fail to win in battle and you will 
Never see the light

Full force rage

Choose your mark among believers in weak spirit
Tear their lives apart there is no limits
No one comes to free you or get you
Your alone in the night
Eat the flesh and feel their might

Full force rage
