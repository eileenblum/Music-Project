No matter what you do
You will feel the pain through your eyes
No need for the eyes to see
No need for the eyes to see

No matter what you do
You will feel the pain through your eyes
Claw them out
No need for you eyes to see here

No need
For eyes
To see

Night is clear as day
Feel the seanons decay into one
The sun rises no more
No need for eyes to see here

No need
For eyes
To see

The slaves choose between life
Or being buried alive
Chorus of death
The dead need no eyes to see you

Save me please, I hear them calling
Bloodthirst is all around
And just before you die
They eat all you alive

Feel flesh torn from bone
Strengthened by lack of sight
Kill the pain
The dead need no eyes to see you

Save me please, I hear them calling
Bloodthirst is all around
And just before you die
They eat you alive

The dead need no eyes to see you
