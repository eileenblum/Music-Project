Revolution time to fight
Endless wars are now in sight
Hellish fires smell of death
The taste of blood no time to rest / we are
Riders / riders of hate
We hunt you down because of your faith
Raise your swords and win the army
Time to destroy and cause agony
It's an eye for an eye
Look towards the sky
It's your time to die
It's an eye for an eye

Fueled by evil on sacred land
Courts of hell condemned all you men
When you die you will live again
We take your souls / unleash the beast within man
Dark skies cover the sun
Fires light up the dark
Raise your swords and win the army
Time to destroy and cause agony
An eye for an eye / look towards the sky
