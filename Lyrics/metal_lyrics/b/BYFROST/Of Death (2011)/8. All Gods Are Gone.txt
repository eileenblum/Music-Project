The travel the fields full of bloodfilled graves
The deathsmelling air of rotting slaves
Souls are still screaming they know they are damned
To live in another dimension of man

All the gods are gone
All the gods are gone

Give us your soul give us your faith
There's no one here only great hate
Echoes of pain growing stronger
The goodness in you is no longer

All the gods are gone
All the gods are gone

Inside your mind of darkness and hate
We're still fighting, we're raping their faith
Into the graves they will fall one by one
Swinging out are all gods are gone
