Beneath the northern lights we ride
The dark lord will guide us
Torches held high
We will kill everything living
There's nowhere to run
The smell of death filling the air harvest begun

Legions
Of death
On a quest
We are obsessed
Legions
Of death
We are
Obsessed with death

Blood is raining from the skies
Red painted corpses the dead will arise
Infected with hatred and strength: some in denial
The smell of death fills the air: slay your ritual

Legions
Of death
On a quest
We are obsessed
Legions
Of death
We are
Obsessed with death

Beneath the northern lights we ride
The oceans have frozen, nothing alive
We will forever patrol, we won't rest
We are the legions of death on our quest

Legions
Of death
On a quest
We are obsessed
Legions
Of death
We are
Obsessed with death
