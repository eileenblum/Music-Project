Regulators call to arms
The saints have started their march
Choose your alliance live or die
Moon rising beware the shadow of fear

So regretful please let me live
Blood spilled in the fields
Show no mercy for the faint hearted
Light in the night beware the shadow of fear

Shadow of fear

regulators cease fire
the night has come to an end
All that is left is emptiness
Show no mercy beware the shadow of fear

Shadow of fear
