This is Walpurgis night
They dance in circle
All around the fire
But they're not alone

There are the demons
They wanna call the devil
With sex and blood
They do all they want

Witches are here, demons are here
Ivol is here, the ritual begins!
In Walpurgis night black witches arrive
I want to survive, the ritual begins!

I see the devil
Into the fire
I feel the evil
Over the circle

I wanna run away
I'm not one of them
Devil wants my soul
But there's no way, no more!
