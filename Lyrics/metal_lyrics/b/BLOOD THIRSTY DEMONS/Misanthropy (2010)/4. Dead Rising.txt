Finally I can see the light again
I can leave my old cold grave
I would like to see your face
I am rising from the heII

I'm returning back
I'm coming from the grave
I want my place to stay
You try to kill again
You try to take my place
But I'm returning back...
...the dead rising yeah!

You that live and insult my name
Don't forget all that I said:
"if you kill me I leave my grave
I return and I find you again!"
