The dark is coming from the sky
The dark is coming in our minds
Every man become crazy
The ancient god returns to take his throne

Cthulhu, come and take your world
Rise from the abyss, from your tomb
Cthulhu, come and take your throne
Destroy the people of this world

The ancient god walks on the Earth
His tentacles destroy the states of world
Someone try to call his name
And then they die in the flames

Destroy all the states
They burn in the flames
The dark is everywhere
We all die today!

He returns back to take again all his lands
The gate of abyss is open
Madness, sufferings... you lose your mind
Cthulhu is here again
