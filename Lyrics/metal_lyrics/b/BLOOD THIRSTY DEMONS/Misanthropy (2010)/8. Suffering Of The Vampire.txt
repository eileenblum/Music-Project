I'm looking for blood
I'm looking for souls
I'm looking for love

I'm always alone
I fly in the dark
And I look for someone

I would like to die
But I'm damned and I cry
You know, you are mine!
You know the vampire!

I hate human race
In these centuries
I've seen the disgrace

I suffer for you
I suffer for me
I suffer for world
