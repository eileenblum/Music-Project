False friends, false musicians
False people and bitches
I thirst for blood,
the blood of you all!

I'm a mad ripper
And you can see my hatred
look at my eyes...
...and say goodbye!

Now you know all I need
Now you know all I feel
All I have inside of me
Is called misanthropy

I don't see the values
And I would like to kill
You think only to yourself
And I slash your flesh
