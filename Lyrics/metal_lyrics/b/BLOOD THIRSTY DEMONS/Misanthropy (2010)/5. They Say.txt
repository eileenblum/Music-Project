We are tonight all around the table
We wanna call the spirits and the demons
We wanna know something from the other side
Is there a better place to stay after we die?

They say: "We don't want you!
We hate human race!
But maybe someone wants your souls
So burn in hell...BURN!"

We are looking for a place where there's no sufferings
We wanna come to you, we wanna be free
Can you show us here tonight what is the light?
Is there a better place to stay after we die?
