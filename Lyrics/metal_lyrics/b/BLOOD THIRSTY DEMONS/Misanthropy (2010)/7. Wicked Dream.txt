There is something in my house tonight
Some shadows formed by the moonlight
I'm very tired and I go to sleep
And in a moment starts my wicked dream

I'm burning in the flames of hell
I see the demons and the unholy dead

My wicked dream
Burns into me
My wicked dream
The end of human being.........yeah!

Here people pay for their sins
Pay for their hatred and hypocrisy
The flames give us all the sufferings
The flames of hell that bring us to ruin

I see the old friends
I see the false people
They die around me
This is my wicked dream

I like this wicked dream,
The dream inside of me
The end of human being,
The end of blasphemy
But this is not real
And I can't wait for this
I must live here, into my agony
