It walks behind me
And it wants my soul
It says: "It's your time...
...it's your time to go!

I try to run away
This is my last day
But I would like to live again
I run away and pray

Death is calling my name
Death is taking my soul
Death is calling my name
My last day in this world.

It wants to see my blood
And I don't want
But maybe in the other side
There is a perfect world.

Here I see hypocrisy
Too much suffering
So death, take my soul
This is my will!
