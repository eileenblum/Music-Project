In the grave I stay, in the grave
I feel no more pain, but I live
Welcome to my world, dark and black
Now I know my death, itÂ´s sweet for me

In the grave...

Now that IÂ´m dead, my life starts
ThereÂ´s no religions here, I believe in
IÂ´m waiting for you, come with me
Welcome to my doom: In the grave
