Welcome to my personal church
Tonight, for your spirit i call
Prepare your body for the rites oÂ´ mine
IÂ´ll change your life, IÂ´ll change your mind

Initiation, your initiation!

Tonight you will see my black book
Tonight you will meet the light
This is your holy initiation
Give me your body, then your soul will be mine!

Now you feel the ecstasy
Dring from my cup of poison
With my blood, you will be mine
Drink in peace, slave of my mind!
