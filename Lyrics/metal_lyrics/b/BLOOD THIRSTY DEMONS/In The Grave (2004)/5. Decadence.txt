Today I think my world is not yours
Where are ideals? where are values?
Where are those who believe in something?
ItÂ´s impossible to live in this world

Evil rules in your mind, evil rules and you die
Pray, pray, pray! but use your mind
Raise your head and stop crying

This is the decadence of humanity
So prepare to rest in peace

DonÂ´t ask yourself god is
He canÂ´t help you, your life needs no one
You are here to do what you want
But be responsible for your actions
