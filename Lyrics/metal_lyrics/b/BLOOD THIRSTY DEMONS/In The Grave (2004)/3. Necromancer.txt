Sit down at the table
I invoke the dead, I invoke the devil
Listen to the voice from the other side
I see fear in your eyes

Necromancer, I donÂ´t want to lose my mind
Necromancer, donÂ´t call the other side

Look at the light of my candles
Leave behind your emotions
Why donÂ´t you pay your necromancer?
I canÂ´t give you every fortune
