All 57: "Invoke me under my stars!
Love is the law, love under will.
Nor let the fools mistake love
For there are love and love
There is the dove, and there is the serpent
Choose ye well!
He, my prophet, hath chosen
Knowing the law of the fortress
And the great mystery of the house of god..."

This is the law of the prince-priest
This is the law but donÂ´t believe in the beast

I was wrong
I was slave of satan
But I opened my eyes
I opened my mind

Now that I know
WhatÂ´s the meaning of my life
I would like to help you
To understand your mistakes
