[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

The sky is red, like blood
I see the angels, and I see the demons
They are ready, they wanna fight
Satan wants the God's throne!

So now! Let the war begin...

Poeple look, at the red sky
I see their fear, they wanna cry
They don't know, what they see
The end of world, let the war begin
