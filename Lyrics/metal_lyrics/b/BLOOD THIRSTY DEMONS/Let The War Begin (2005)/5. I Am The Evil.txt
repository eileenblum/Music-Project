[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

I was born in the fire of hell
And I don't know what I am
Around me there was a black, black sky
And I don't know why I cried

I don't know why,
I don't know why
The devil want my soul,
But this soul is mine
But now I don't cry because the devil
Doesn't know,
I am the evil and this is all

Fire in the sky, here I am
See this evil come, on this earth
The end is near, and death is here
This world is in my hands

I am the evil!

I cannot die, I survive
I rule the world and your mind
