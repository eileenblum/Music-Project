[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

In paradise he cannot live, there's no place
For the beastr
He wants the abyss, he ants the men
He wants to change the laws of God

So, Lucifer falls - Into the dark
Lucifer falls - Into the flames

He wants to command all the demons
The falen angels and witches,
The stupid men who believe
In the prince of hell
