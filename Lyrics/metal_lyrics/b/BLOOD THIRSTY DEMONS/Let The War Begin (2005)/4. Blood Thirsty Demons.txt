[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

You listen to the song of demons
Tonight you can see the edge of evil
When the fire burns and the virgins cry
We can say: "It's time to die!"

We are, the Blood Thirsty Demons
We are, the death for evil
We are, the Blood Thirsty Demons
We burn, your soul in hell!

When the sky is black and the moon is full
The Blood Thirsty Demons come to you
Without satanic rites, without brutality
We kill you now, without your will!

Your soul is burning
Your body is gone
Tonight you are becoming
A blood thirsty demons
