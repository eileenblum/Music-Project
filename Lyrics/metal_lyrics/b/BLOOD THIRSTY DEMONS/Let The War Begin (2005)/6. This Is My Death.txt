[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

I cannot see the light,
I can't feel my body
I can't hear the voice
Of poeple around my bed
I don't know why, my firends cry
My body is gone, but I live above them

This is my death, and I do what I want
This is my death, my body is gone

This is trye life
My soul is ready
Here you cannot die
Here there is no living
