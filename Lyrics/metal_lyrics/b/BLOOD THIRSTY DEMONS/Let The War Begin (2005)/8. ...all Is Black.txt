[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

Blacj candles and sacrifices
Satanic rites in Walpurgis night
I'll never understand
What you think to be, my friend

You say: "Lucifer bring the light'
I say: "Lucifer bring you to death!"
I know the devil and his tentations
Why don't you pray in some other way?

Remember that I said: "one day you'll walk alone"
And don't ask me again to help you with your soul
Remember that I said: "one day you'll walk alone"
And understand, around you all is black

Black masses, blood and drugs
Fire, corsses and profanations
I'll never understand if you feel good with yourself
