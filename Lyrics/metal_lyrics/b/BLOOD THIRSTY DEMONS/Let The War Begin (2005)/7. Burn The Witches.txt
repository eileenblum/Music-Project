[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

Like witches inside your head
They disturbed your life, they let you cry
Leave behind your memories
Leave behind your pain
Now depression arrives, but you run away

You butn the witches, to stop your mind
Free your soul from memories
And live your life

But this is the evil, that lives through man
I know the devil, he plays with your head
You must burn the witches, inside your head
They disturb your life, they let you cry

Bur the witches!...
Leave behind your memories,
Leave behind your pain
