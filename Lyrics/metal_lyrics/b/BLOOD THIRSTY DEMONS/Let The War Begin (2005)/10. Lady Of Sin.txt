[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

You who control all the minds
Give me your ecstasy
By your love I am blind
Help me to see the light
I don't know if I believe in you
I don't know if I wat your love
I don't know who you are
But I know you're the lady of sin

I don't want to drink your cup
I don't want to drink your blood

Lady of sin, don't come to me...

Mother of all sins, of Earth
Mother of all sins of men

"...No more things to do, I look for the black solitude" (C. Mustaine)
