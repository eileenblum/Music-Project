[Music &amp; lyrics by C. Mustaine]

Everything I see is black
Everything I love is dead
No more friends, no more hate
No more things to do
I look for the black solitude...

Everyday I live is black
Everyday I lose my head
No more magic, no more mistakes
No more things to do,
I look for the black soilitude...
