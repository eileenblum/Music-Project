Today is the day of its return
Who lives in this world will burn
From the abyss you can see the smoke
The smoke of evil that comes in your homes

I see the ocean that runs with the wind
ThereÂ´s a hole in the water, I canÂ´t believe
I see something in the hole, itÂ´s horrible
Now I understand, the beast wants to rule

This is the ancient beast
It wants to command over its earth
This is the ancient beast
ThereÂ´s no survivor, donÂ´t fight with the beast

Help me god, I will give my soul for heaven
I havenÂ´t fear, I will fight forever
I will close the door of the abyss of evil
I will close the door of the blood thirsty demons...
...in Hell!
