In the darkness we are
With our souls we see you
You must donÂ´t care of us
Or tonight we take you
We are the ghosts of ourselves
We are the shadows of our minds
You donÂ´t know who we are
Because you are so blind

Sons of darkness, save this world
Sons of darkness, this is my soul
Sons of darkness, you must judge me
Sons of darkness, donÂ´t leave me alone

We are your masters now!
We prepare you to magick
We are sons and you are sons
Of darkness! we rule the world!

This is not black magic
This is not religion
This is only the great law:
Respect yourself and save this world!
