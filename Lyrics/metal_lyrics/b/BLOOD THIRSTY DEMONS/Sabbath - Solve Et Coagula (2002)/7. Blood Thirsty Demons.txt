You listen the song of the demon
Tonight you can see the edge of evil
When the fire burns and the virgins cry
We can say "itÂ´s time to die!"

We are the blood thirsty demons
We are the death of evil
We are the blood thirsty demons
We burn your soul in hell

When the sky is black and the moon is full
The blood thirsty demons come to you
Without satanic rites, without brutality
We kill you now, without your will

Your soul is burning
Your body is gone
Tonight you are becoming
A blood thirsty demon
