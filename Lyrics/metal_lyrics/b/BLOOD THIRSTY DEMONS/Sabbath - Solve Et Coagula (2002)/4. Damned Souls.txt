IÂ´m lonely in the darkness
I was dead to the world
Now my soul travels in the hell
But here there is none
I try to fly, but I canÂ´t
So I try to run away
But thereÂ´s the devil inside of me
Ye, ye, yea!

No IÂ´m outside the hell
And I travel in the world
ThereÂ´s no darkness and no shadows
And I can see the sky
But the devil is alway inside of me
IÂ´m a damned soul
I must kill someone
Ye, ye, yea!

I see a young virgin
I want her blood to drink
Now IÂ´m a slave of satan
I canÂ´t believe it
In my life I killed two men
I did the game of the beast
Now my eyes are red
Like the blood and the flame
IÂ´m a damned soul
I cannot live no more

Come on little child
look at my eyes
IÂ´m a damned soul
I must kill someone

Now my friend!
DonÂ´t destroy your life!
DonÂ´t do the evil!
Or you will be of the devil!
