They return back with the ancient spirits
They return back to kill the living
They return back to take this Earth
They return back to take their own world

Now you can see the ancient magick
Now you can see the ancient gods
Now you can see the ancient spirits
Now you can see the ancient gods

When we closed them in the abyss
They said: "We'll return back!"
And now they are in front of men
Now they want to take their land
