I don't know where is the knowledge
I want to know where's my conscience
So I look at my heart
And I find all the answers

It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul

I want to know the mean of life
I want to know where's the light
So I look at my soul
And I understand what I am

It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul... occultum lapidem

I'm not blind and I can see
The great light of my will
I look for peace for my mind
I look for pleasures, that I've inside
