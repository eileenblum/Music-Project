Do you believe in a living dead?
Do you believe in the other side?
Do you believe that we return back?
Do you believe that we cannot die?

So look at the cemetery
And tell me what you see
In the graves there is nobody
But believe me, this is real

The graves are open
The graves are open, now!

And now we are returning back
To show you what's the life
There is no end with the death
The beginning is in the other side
