Rituals, magick
I enjoy me with every excess
To free my soul, to free my heart
To free my mind of shit!

And I know, that I will die
I'm waiting to see the end
If you know what is the light
You have no fear of death

I enjoy my life
Yes, I know that I will die!
And I never cry
But I know that I will die!
Die! die!
Yes, I know that I will die!!!

Rituals, magick
I prepare me to my return
I prepare my soul, I prepare my heart
I prepare me to cry no more.
