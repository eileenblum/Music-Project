I that live my spiritual tale
I don't want toopen your eyes
I just want to show you these lies
They try to use your faith and your mind

Stolen faith, stolen faith...

They say: "Give us your money and pray"
They say: "You must believe in our faith"
I say: "Give us a reason to pray!"
You say: "Give me back my stolen faith!".
