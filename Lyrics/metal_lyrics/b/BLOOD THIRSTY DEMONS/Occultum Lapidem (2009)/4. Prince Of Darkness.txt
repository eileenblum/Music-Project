You that try to take
All the stupid men
You would like to put
Your hatred in myself

You don't need a God
You don't need a men
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else

Prince of darkness
You're nothing in my life

Hey prince! I know your name
I don't fear all that you say

You like to see the death
You like to see all black
You like to see
The decline of men

You think that I don't know
That you rule this world
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
