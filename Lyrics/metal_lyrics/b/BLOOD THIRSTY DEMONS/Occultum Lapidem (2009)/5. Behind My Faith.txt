I would like to know,
What reality is
I would like to know,
What life is for me
'cause I spent all my life,
Running behind my dreams
And every time,
I ran behind my faith
...I ran behind my faith...

Sometimes you need someone near of you
Sometimes you need solitude
You can find yourself, and you don't need no one
You can find your faith, and you can walk alone

I try to know myself
I try with every excess
I try to fall into a trance
I invoke the spirits of dead

When I invoke, my spirit guide
I feel his power inside my veins
I feel his knowledge into my brain
And I keep it inside of me, behind my faith
