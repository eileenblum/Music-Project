When I look around my life
I see damned souls, they don't survive
I see young people, they always cry
They have no values, don't know the light

In your eyes
Tears of lies
You cry and die
Tears of lies

When I look into your face
I see depression, I see no faith
I see young people, they always cry
They have no values, don't know the light.
