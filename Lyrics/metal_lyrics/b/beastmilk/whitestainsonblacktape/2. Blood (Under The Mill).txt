Tender white corpse
Corrupted bodies gleam
Inside your heartache
The devil kissed you clean

Warring severed heads
Sew deep connections
Wear your collapse
With invocations

It's all blood . . .blood under the mill . . .

Governmental agents appear in the fog
Morse-code static erupts
Feeding the fear with a contradiction
Like snow in a black oil flood

There is no way out
They will find you now

Red morning star
On the balcony
This mouth now
Organ of the beast

Opposing forces
feed each other
Who drives the Hydra
snakes asunder

It's all blood . . .blood under the mill . . .

Governmental agents appear in the fog
Morse-code static erupts
Feeding the fear with a contradiction
Like snow in a black oil flood

There is no way out
They will find you now
