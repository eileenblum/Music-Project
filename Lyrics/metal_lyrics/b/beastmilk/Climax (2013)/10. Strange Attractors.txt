This terrible world
you unfasten in my mind
each ancient minute
rewires my heart
held in a kiss-spell
of electric blood
and the night comes undone
and the night comes undone

Strange attractors
lost in the opium
of desire...desire...desire...
desire...desire
holding hands full of fire

The stillnes of now
charged atoms collide
a new hip moon
in our eyes rise
sleeping with frictions
glued to our mind

a fatal distraction
a fatal distraction

Feels so strange
it canÂ´t be wrong
feels so strange
it canÂ´t be wrong

Strange attractors
lost in the opium
of desire...desire...desire...
desire...desire
holding hands full of fire
