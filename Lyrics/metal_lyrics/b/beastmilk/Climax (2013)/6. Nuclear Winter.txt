Tank up with fumes, let the dial hit the red
fires at the dawn of the cityÂ´s edge
ripping up roads, making like the dead
long lost friendships hanging in the wind
rag-tag scarecrows blown in the snow
abandoned buildings row by row
all the colours of grey in a fall- out fog
the human country lit up like a cross

Oh what the future holds
thereÂ´s no future
oh whta the future hides
thereÂ´s no future
Oh what the future holds
thereÂ´s no future
oh whta the future hides
thereÂ´s no future

We could be an army, we could dig a grave
weÂ´re hot on heels of an atomic wave
kickking up dust on bright dead sun
you light a cigarette, IÂ´ll bring the guns
nowhere to go to, waiting to come
itching as the cold pressure turns us on
a fugitive-hunger clatter of bones
bringing the sound of the bomb-blast home

Into the Nuclear Winter
Nuclear
Nuclear Winter!
into the Nuclear Winter
Nuclear
Nuclear Winter!

Frost cloaks the backs of the shuffling souls
as they moan through the smog
with an eerie drawl
palace of pale white ancient scars
entombed glacial quilted cars
the cold desert drift, diamond flesh
youÂ´ll only see as far as your hand will stretch
limbs shake with fear of the nuclear blues her a man has no learn how to lose
