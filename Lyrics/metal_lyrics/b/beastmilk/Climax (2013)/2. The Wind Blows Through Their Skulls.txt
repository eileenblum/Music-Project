Short circuit signals
crawl the pavements of my mind
intermittent voices call of the atomic kind

I canÂ´t sleep through dead dreams
as blood buildings boil
contimanet flesh machines
black clouds from furnace coil

The wind blows through their skulls
as the night begins to shine
with tongues that whip the tombs
the air will set their bones on fire

Radiation hunger
cold war a secret sign
my ghost whisper to my ghost
"am I nuclear genocide?"

I canÂ´t sleep through dead dreams
as blood buildings boil
contimanet flesh machines
black clouds from furnace coil

The wind blows through their skulls
as the night begins to shine
with tongues that whip the tombs
the air will set their bones on fire
