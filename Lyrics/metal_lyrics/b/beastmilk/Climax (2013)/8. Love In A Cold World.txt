Heart-break, behind your eyes
and crooked corners of a smile
mysteries of distance
rootles
grown apart
fresh meat for vulture mobs
two headlights in parking lot
pulling away...

Holding on to love in a cold world
IÂ´m holding on to love
Crying out in a dead universe
IÂ´m holding on to love

Holding on to love in a cold world
IÂ´m holding on to love
Crying out in a dead universe
IÂ´m holding on to love

Holding on to love in a cold world
IÂ´m holding on to love
Crying out in a dead universe
IÂ´m holding on to love

Caught in lonely orbit
of SaturnÂ´s shattered arms
tumble horse and rider
into shipwrecked beds
as if one fearless kiss could crush
this joy-burnerÂ´s gasp
compressing into dust

Holding on to love in a cold world
IÂ´m holding on to love
Crying out in a dead universe
IÂ´m holding on to love

Holding on to love in a cold world
IÂ´m holding on to love
Crying out in a dead universe
IÂ´m holding on to love

Holding on to love in a cold world
IÂ´m holding on to love
Crying out in a dead universe
IÂ´m holding on to love
