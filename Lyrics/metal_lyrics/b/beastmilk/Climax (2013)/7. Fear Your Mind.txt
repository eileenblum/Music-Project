Charley MansonÂ´s Blue and Red
goona shoot the president dead
give in to the voices in your head

I would be your cult
I would be your trigger
Let me be your mind fucker

November 7Â´07
Pekka-Eric Auvinen
forget your fantasies of heaven

Colorado movie heights
dark night in his sights
this curtain fall will be your last

Fight the struggle to outrun
walking up to all thatÂ´s lost
scared to close your eyes

What man am I
to wash these stains
where monsters are replaced
and scattered pawns fall away?

Mind on mind
we search for signs
fists of fears that teeth will grind
and worry our bones into the grave

Better mind your thoughts
and fear your mind
Better mind your thoughts
and fear your mind
