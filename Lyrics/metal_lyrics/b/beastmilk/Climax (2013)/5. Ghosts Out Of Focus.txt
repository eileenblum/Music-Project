Bronze my bones with black howls
turn my body into dreams
spectral spools of movie stills
blank shadows in the seats
as my mind spills like milk
drip across the screen
reach down into the black
kiss deathÂ´s soft underbelly
where we met...

WeÂ´re two ghosts out of focus
a smear on the projector
weÂ´re two ghosts out of focus
what the lens couldnÂ´t capture

Our secrets in celluloid
our smoke-rise souls snake into ghosts

Where a hundred haunts hawk
we found our pleasures
drawn in underwater chalk
like silent traces
a crevice full of crack-ups
home to captured vapours
slip down into the black
trace the scriptless pages
where we met...

WeÂ´re two ghosts out of focus
a smear on the projector
weÂ´re two ghosts out of focus
what the lens couldnÂ´t capture

Our secrets in celluloid
our smoke-rise souls snake into ghosts

WeÂ´re two ghosts out of focus
a smear on the projector
weÂ´re two ghosts out of focus
what the lens couldnÂ´t capture

Our secrets in celluloid
our smoke-rise souls snake into ghosts
