Every thought is abducted
in locker room brawls
your body boils in the mind yard
in an image of your fall
psychosexual severance
no skin swap escape
while I game for your reality
you will abide and obey and obey and obey

You are now under our control
you are now under our control
Your future is fiction
your inner self is cruel hoax

You are now under our control
you are now under our control
no fire from any other lips
will mouth the words
to free your soul

Overmind godforms
gargoylian law
your only comfort
is a clenched fist
head against the wall

You are now under our control
you are now under our control
Your future is fiction
your inner self is cruel hoax

You are now under our control
you are now under our control
no fire from any other lips
will mouth the words
to free your soul

We conspired against you
you pulled short straws
one dimensional hologram
out demon out
two-headed thightrope
recoils and reboots
a little side show brainwash
like snakes in the skull of a child

You are now under our control
you are now under our control
Your future is fiction
your inner self is cruel hoax

You are now under our control
you are now under our control
no fire from any other lips
will mouth the words
to free your soul
