Feel the bends
Charge the lens
of Doomsday Tension
I feel the End is nigh

When weÂ´re sleeping
When weÂ´re dreaming
I pick the Bones clean with the light
I pick the Bones clean with the light

Death reflect us in itÂ´s mirror
reaching out to us
and weÂ´re transformed into burning stars
Death reflect us in itÂ´s mirror
Lights the private dark
Breaking out through mind and skull

Feel the strains
See the stains
of ruination
I feel the End is nigh

When weÂ´re sleeping
When weÂ´re dreaming
I pick the Bones clean with the light
I pick the Bones clean with the light

Death reflect us in itÂ´s mirror
reaching out to us
and weÂ´re transformed into burning stars
Death reflect us in itÂ´s mirror
Lights the private dark
Breaking out through mind and skull
