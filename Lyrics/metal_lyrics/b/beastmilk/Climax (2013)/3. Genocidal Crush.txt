Kiss slit throaths, mute limbs grope
the wicks of an eye, a hangmanÂ´s rope
drug-white night, a supper of knives
spittle in hair, claw the air
IÂ´ll bring the devil and you read the details

Shock takes hold, a gentle choke
bones grind bone, wet skinÂ´s cold
meat rubbed wih salt,suck suck suck
broken necks neck, lick the stroke

Out of the sighs, come sweet ills tonight

An innocent kiss turns to lust
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush
when it all gets too much
I feel genocidal crush
when we touch touch touch touch
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush
when the blood starts to rush
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush

Gaggle of wounds, lunatic swoon
a moments ache, cancerous shake
burning lust, filling the cup
beating back tears, tearing up
our visions come to life,
the world deserves to die

Shock takes hold, a gentle choke
bones grind bone, wet skinÂ´s cold
meat rubbed wih salt,suck suck suck
broken necks neck, lick the stroke

Out of the sighs, come sweet ills tonight

An innocent kiss turns to lust
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush
when it all gets too much
I feel genocidal crush
when we touch touch touch touch
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush
when the blood starts to rush
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush

Out of the sighs, come sweet ills tonight

Out of the sighs, come sweet ills tonight

Out of the sighs, come sweet ills tonight

An innocent kiss turns to lust
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush
when it all gets too much
I feel genocidal crush
when we touch touch touch touch
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush
when the blood starts to rush
IÂ´ve got genocidal crush
