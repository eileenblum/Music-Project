My spiral eyes mirror yours when you peer inside the earth
A softly spoken grave that grows with a worm of thought
You're paralysed!

Void mother
and the elaborate worship of her
Abyss sister
Her name =Â  a conscription to the rituals of deep faith
Milking a calf of gold
and yearning to be believed

Void mother!
Void mother!

My pious hands cover your mouth when you speak with words of doubt
A sanctimonious church that sucks you in and spits you out
You're paralysed!

Void mother
and the elaborate worship of her
Abyss sister
Her name =Â  a conscription to the rituals of deep faith
Milking a calf of gold
and yearning to be believed

Void mother!
Void mother!
And yearning to be believed
