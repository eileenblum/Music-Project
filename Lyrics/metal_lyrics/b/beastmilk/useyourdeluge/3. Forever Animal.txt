I can't conceive, I can't conceive, I can't conceive . . .

If you are superman
Let me be forever animal
If you are avalanche
Let me be forever carnal
Â 
Self-love without congregation
Unmask your morbid fantasy
Breathe deep your chainsaw revolution
From emptiness into ecstasy

If you are superman
Let me be forever animal
If you are avalanche
Let me be forever carnal
If you are superman
Let me be forever animal

There's no courage
to conceive your aspirations
servile to the laws of belief
Breathe deep your gas-chamber celebration
From ugliness into beauty

If you are superman
Let me be forever animal
If you are avalanche
Let me be forever carnal
If you are superman
Let me be forever animal
