Children of the atom bomb
Children of the atom bomb
lit by the fires of the coming dawn
and brighter than the sun

Children of the atom bomb
Children of the atom bomb
In irradiated coma-zones
of projected holy-smoke

Old wars within
the men inside
boiled in their tears

Children of the mushroom cloud
children of the mushroom cloud
Blessed fall-out, phantom crowds
that learned to love the gun

Children of the atom bomb
Children of the atom bomb
lit by the fires of the coming dawn
and brighter than the sun

Children of the atom bomb
Children of the atom bomb
In irradiated coma-zones
of projected holy-smoke

Old wars within
the men inside
boiled in their tears
