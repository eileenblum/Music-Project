Typewriters click in the dark
Like morse-code dead dialing tones
Resonant messages spark
A psychosis that spreads to the bones

Your red majesty
They're calling from the Kremlin
to summon you home

Your red majesty
All coded symbols signal
it's the end of the road

Frantic documents disposed
Traces of movements are erased
As avenues of escape close
All numbers can be replaced

Your red majesty
They're calling from the Kremlin
to summon you home

Your red majesty
All coded symbols signal
it's the end of the road
