As the brightness got dark
And the righteous got wrong
The evil seized power betrayed even strong

The god of confusion entered this scene
Created a mountain to enslave all the free

Blinded men's eyes and blinded their minds
Took their respect - broke reckless their spine
The evil has risen - masked with the good
From the altar blood flowed - put in his foot
The evil has risen - masked with the good
Put in his foot

Ill reputed the ancient values
Derided the inviolability
Irrevocable mankind's fate
Perpetual the torment they suffer

A sacrifice for the fear of god
A throat for his unspeakable hunger
Innocent blood for his enormous thirst
And a mountain for mankind's failure

Innocent blood for his enormous thirst
Mankind's failure

Take the dagger to sign the testimony
Your son's body should be the parchment
Darkened his look, as he finished the irony
Alone, the enemy redeemed
The son from punishment

Inexorable wrath broke loose
As God saw his work obliterated
"Cursed be the hill - your head in my nose"
Atheists must conquer Moriha, so you're liberated

While the time flowed, the hill saw too much blood
A dome made of skulls covered the rock
As long as God's conceptions exist
The enemy won't rule, but we will resist
