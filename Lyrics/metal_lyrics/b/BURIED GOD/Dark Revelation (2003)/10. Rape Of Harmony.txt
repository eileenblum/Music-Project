(Elegy for a bitch)

Now you're gone
But forever with me
Finally you lie at my feet
And beg to serve
Oh sweet silence, empty screams
Eternal sigh, constant mocking
It's all over
Do you feel my smooth hand
Too long you raped the harmony
But now your voice sounds sweet
Oh, tasty your body, so spicy your kiss
Let me eat your tongue
Don't weir, no woeful cries
I'm your master
No one will rape the harmony again
Death becomes you!
