You will regret, I know it hurts
Those badly chosen ugly words
Imagine, I am not the one
Can't pretend whatever you want

The velvet cave between your thighs
But you want me to see your boring eyes
Silly things you want me to do
Let me dive in your crimson pool

I don't care
What your breed's doing
I won't share
My valuable life
Just cry
I pierce your face
You're mine
I want your ass

I am bad, I am a killer
Be glad, so taste my pillar
Hot, my acid burns your skin
I am the one, I live for the sin

You want warmth, but I am cold
Want my riches, but I am poor
Don't come closer, leave me alone
Eat my fist, I kick you home

Can't you see, hell's in my eyes
Shut your trap, you make me cry
Just lay down, I break your chest
I am the devil, I let you rest... (in pieces)

I am bad, I am a killer
Be glad, so taste my pillar
Hot, my acid burns your skin
I am the one, I live for the sin

I am bad, I am a killer
Be glad, so taste my pillar
Hot, my acid burns your skin
I am the one, you're just a piece of flesh!
