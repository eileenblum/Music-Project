Born into a world of hatred
Maltreated by demons of wrath
Stheno's eating your guts
Euryale's drinking your blood

Abused by a living nightmare
Took away your innocence
Taken by a trusted illusion
Reality is no heaven

Escape into sleepless nights
Purgatory's burning
Evil's face's shining
Staring into the Gorgon's eyes

Fate has spoken
Damaged your brain
You're good forsaken
Just getting insane

Don't look in the mirror
Perversion hits you twice
Satisfaction's an error
But deliverance's the price

Sell your ground body
Just for silly luck
Loathing's what you feel
Incites your boiling blood

One beast dies, another is born
The eyes of the Gorgon they lived on
As a gift of monstrosity
Transmitted from father to son

One thought in the predators mind
Revenge for all he had to suffer
All subhuman shall sigh
He was tough, but the world was tougher

The victim can't see
The snakes on his head
His eyes start to bleed
While he's feeding the mad

No place in hell, less on earth
Buried alive is more than forlorn
Crying one tear, it is not worth
So take this farewell, Robert John!

[Epilogue:]
They have a mouth, but cannot speak
Eyes, but they don't see
They have ears, but they don't hear
A nose and they cannot smell
Unable to touch with their hands
Cannot walk with their feet
No tone leaves their throat
