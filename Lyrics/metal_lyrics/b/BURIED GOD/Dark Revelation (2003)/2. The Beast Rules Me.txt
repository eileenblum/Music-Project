Disastrous the end of your life's mission
Changin' their minds but no one listened
Depressions pulled you to the bottom
You're frozen like the salt pile in Sodom

You'd better look back on your success
A failure couldn't bring you down
The challenge's the least and the best
The honour to fight's the crown

A new knight hit you from behind
Nothing remained but surrender
Jealous deceivers in your own lines
No saviour helped - no defenders.

You're dreaming of glory and mighty days
Surrounded by violence and power
Tasting the sweet blood as you open your eyes
Kissin' the witch and lost in the tower

She's disguised as a fairy,
Wearing diamonds and gold
But in the mirror of truth she's dreadful and old
Temptation is stronger than the will to survive
Down by drugs you can't see her actually...
Greatness!

Is she in league with the devil,
Are you obsessed by this witch
She rules your mind, recognize, that she's a bitch
Tries to seduce you, convicted to destroy your will

If you wanna live as a man, stop fucking
And start up the kill

Let her perish in flames
Just knock off her head
Cut her into pieces
Now watch out, I am back
