Six men in a cave
Six men that nobody knows
Six men greydressed
Six men holding the world's destiny

Kingdown built and born
And then collapse without any reason
Governments are created
And then disappear

[Chorus:]
But this underworld
Where all decisions that are taken
Concern the destiny of mankind
There's no hope anymore
Time goes by, it's close to death
Curse is approaching
They are crawling in the dark
Their sharped mandibules

But six men know
But six men lead
But six men decide
But six men command

Six men in a cave
Six men that nobody knows
Six men grey dressed
Six men holding the world's destiny

Seize this so short moment
There won't be another one anymore
A new neutral world
A scrap of mankind

[Chorus]
