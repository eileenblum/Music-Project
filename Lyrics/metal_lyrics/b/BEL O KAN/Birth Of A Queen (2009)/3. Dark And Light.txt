[Chorus:]
Open the door of my heaven
Cure the pain of my life
Find the key to my soul
Erase the dark with your light

I remember
The storms and the waves that strikes
I remember
Darkness of the abyssal zones
You can hear over the sea
All the tears drowning my dreams

I remember
The big-bang strikes in my heart
I remember
That death tightened my arms
You can find beyond the stars
All the time to relieve my heart

You can see over the mountains
You and me caught in my brain
You can fly over the rainbow
Watch the sky now and tomorrow, tomorrow

If all is written
If all is finished
How can you choose your destiny?
Nothing is very black
Nothing is very white
It remains for you always a chance

No suicide, no madness
I can't live in the dark
No more pain, no more tears
Let the fire burn all my heart

I rememberAll the hard cold ice of winter
I remember
All the snow to the top and over
But you can see over the mountains
You and me caught in my brain

I remember
Storm and black rain follow me
I remember
Lightning strikes in the middle of fear
But you can fly over the rainbow
Watch the sky now and tomorrow
