Behind the mask, a bead of sweat
Runs over my face I am ready to jump
If it approaches me. It is arriving
And I must stop it, one need,
It all depends on me
I cannot fail my mission

[Chorus:]
The eagle locates its prey
And does not lose it
The blades cut asplit
And the fire attacks the ice all around
The eagle locates its prey
And does not lose it
The blades cut asplit
And the fire attacks the ice all around
Fire on ice

Taken in my claws I am now his master
I keep it close to me I will not let is escape
Taken in my glove, it was written, I must win
It's my reason to live, I am the eagle goalkeeper

[Chorus]
Goalkeeper, goalkeeper, let the fire in your eyes
And the ice, and the ice, imprison your heart
Oh my boys, oh my boys, defend your territory
Raise your head, raise your head, proud as an eagle
Sharpen your stick, sharpen your stick, and seek the right target
Hit and run, hit and run, take the legendary cup
Icesknights, icesknights, we must fight until the end
And tonight, and tonight, we will be victorious
We must fight until the end, and we'll be victorious
