After a long wait
This day arrive finally
A holy day for me
This dawn is so nice
And this morning so still
I close my eyes and listen to my breath

You were not prepared for this
Nobody can believe in
Now you know the truth
You cannot avoid it anymore

[Chorus:]
When my children call my name
And all jump my arms
What's the matter in my brain
Where one thousand suns shine
Like the lights of the city
That switch on in my heart
My eyes light up
To the point of running
