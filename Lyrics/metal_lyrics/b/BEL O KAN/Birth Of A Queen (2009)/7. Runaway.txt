The face of an angel
But you have a heart of stone
They don't see who you are,
They're not here when you cry
Never someone to rescue you
When you're falling in the dark
Alone in misery,
No one can live without a dream

No one to see what's going on
No one to heal your wounds so deep
You are at the morning of your life

[Chorus:]
Breakin' the chains and runnin' away
It's not a game you're too desperate
Breakin' the chains and runnin' away
It's time to take the way to freedom

They need to change your minds
To put out the fire in your eyes
But you are so strong
And they never can break your soul
'Cause you know you can find
Everyone is just like you
Too young and too wild but
Without lie and without sin

No one to see what's going on
No one to heal your wounds so deep
Time is here so take your chance

Breakin' the chains and runnin' away
It's time to take the way to freedom

Run, run, runaway
Run, run, runaway
Run, run, runaway
