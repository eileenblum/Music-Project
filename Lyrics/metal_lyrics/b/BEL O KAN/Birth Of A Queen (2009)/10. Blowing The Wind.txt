The sea is too quiet, under the morning light
And the sailors are sleeping
An' dreaming before the day begin
Get up my brothers, my friends!
It's time to hoist the Black Flag
A white skull on black bottom
The mark of all free ones

[Chorus:]
Blowing the wind in our sails
Travelling from the East to West
Blowing the wind in our sails
Across all the seven seas
Blowing the wind in our sails
Travelling from the North to South
Blowing the wind in our sails
And lead us to the end of sea

Today is a day for us
A day for the guns
A day to live a day to kill
To be rich or to be dead!
Now it's time for blades my friends!
So com'on Wolves of the seas
It's time for the carnage!
Forever free over the seas!
