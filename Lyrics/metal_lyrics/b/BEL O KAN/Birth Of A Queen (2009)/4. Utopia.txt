Celts, Scandinavians, Egyptians
Have looked for it
For a long time
When will it be found
And could the gods help us?
Or is it only a game?
The rules are bypassed
Mankind cheated
So many of us have tried
The dream never comes true
Only death will come

Over the river
Our souls will be judged
Shall a land be withot men
Only fauna and flora
A supreme nature
Without evil to gnaw at it
Only the goods will die
Justice doesn't exist
Neither human nor divine

[Chorus:]
Where is this utopian land?
Where is this such ancient land?
A land of nature and beauty
A land where life is wisdom

My anger is strong, my fury is suffering
So many questions without answer
May the force of the wind guides us
May the brightness of the sun in our heart
Give us the force to carry out our destiny
Death laughs about us
Where is this utopian land?
Where is this such ancient land?
