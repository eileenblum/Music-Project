As they came all they brought was ruin
they banished our gods and gave us a new believe
the false believe into a false god
they gave us weakness and stole our honour, our pride

for all those who burned in the fires of the holy inquisition
for all those murdered in the name of the christian god
all that sorrows wonÂ´t be ever forgotten
and your revenge is near

They tormented and they slaughtered in the name of their god they killed our people and stole our believe
2000 years that christ has ruled
soon this time will only be history

For all those who never betrayed their pagan believe
for all those who still stayed true when they had to die
for all those burned in the fires of the holy inquisition you will see, your revenge is near
