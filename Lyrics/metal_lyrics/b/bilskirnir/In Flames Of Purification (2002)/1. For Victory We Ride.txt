Brothers! let's raise our weapons!
To defend our land
to slay the enemy
united to an unbeatable might
we ride into the battle by the dawn

The battle has begun...
...for victory we ride

The enemy is lying on the battlefield
pierced by our steel
the winterly ground has turned red
from their blood
our vengeance was so cruel

The battle has begun...
...for victory we ride

By the dawn we ride
to take revenge
for our forefathers death
fighting with ancient pride
fighting to the last breath

Hail Victory!

The battle has begun...
...for victory we ride

Brothers! Let's raise our weapons!
To defend our land
to slay the enemy
united to an unbeatable might
we ride into the battle by the dawn

The battle has begun...
...for victory we ride

The victory is ours!
