[originally by Graveland]Living, dead and dying 
We stand covered by Black shroud 
We await the moon and wind 
Fire burning on the altar 
Burnt the incautious spirits 
By it's red glare, awoke the magic stones 
We've united good and evil 
We've created the highest power 
Magic and might of dark blood 
Blood from the scars of wounded Gods 
Runes engraved by Devils 
Besmeared by the Black Blood 
In the Glare of furious lightning's 
Spell of the damned runic words 
Altar of uncoagulated blood 
Altar surrounded by the women-wolves 
The words pledged to moon 
We repeat incantations written in blood 
Spirits come and walk among us 
We curse their fear and awe 
We curse our mercy 
May my soul burn in the fore of purity 
Evil wind tears the trees 
Moon hidden over the clouds 
Black smoke teases our eyes 
Burnt blood charms by it's smell 
Night of the ultimate darkness 
Elected it's sacrifice, it's tribute 
Feeding by our fear and our pain
