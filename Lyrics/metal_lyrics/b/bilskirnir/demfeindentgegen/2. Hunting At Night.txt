Obsessed by moon's bright gleam
bearer of lycantrhropic spell
gruesome, cold and majestic
forred to leave his human shell

In forests, deep and hidden
embraced by cruel coldness
inviking sinister reality
as he takes away your breath

Hunting at night

Cruel bitternes is in his heart
damned to walk at night
forever, he hunts alone
wanderer of twilight

Breed of immortality
spawn of the shadowside
following fullmoons call
no mercy left inside

Hunting at night

Fiery rage burning in his eyes
craving for blood and flesh
a nightmare to the mortals
helpless screams of death

Unleashed the wolf inside
beast of prey within
werewolf, ruler of the night
descendand of ancient kin

Hunting at night
