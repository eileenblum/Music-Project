Could be lost forever
What lies buried beneath
The pillars of a modern world?

Could be lost forever
What made us noble
And forced us to greatness?

The way of the world unalterable
Our fate, heading toward the deepest abyss?

No tears to be shed for a dying organism
Taking it's last breath

No tears to be shed for this world
Tumbling and fading into oblivion

With joy in our hearts
We celebrate it's decay
The fading age of spiritual decline

Like the leaves in spring and the rising summer sun
From the smouldering remains of ashes decay
A news sun will arise
Our sun will arise!
