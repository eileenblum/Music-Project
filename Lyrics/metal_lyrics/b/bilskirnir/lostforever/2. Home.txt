Like a restless wanderer
On his (long) way back home
I seek for what seems lost
Since the ages have turned

Like a beast of prey,
A relic from elder times
With a hard heart plant in my breast
And a solitary mind (inside)

I don't belong to this world
A world that I left behind so long ago
All your joys and your desires
Are the seed for my wrath

Will the mourning of my soul
Come to an end
As I watch your world
Going up in flames?

Then I'll find rest
And I'll be home
