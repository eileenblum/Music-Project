Our hordes gather in the forests
we strengthen our spirits in scared ritual
anewing the ancient oath of blood
as our father did before

Through cold Nordic winds
with fire and with steel
with no fear inside
and no mercy left to spare

We are riding onwards
into glorious victory or death
wolfish warriors raging
to strike with no remorse

Blood and Spirit

On the wings of death we ride
blessed by the gods of war
we bring forward
the end of this world

Their temples laid in ruins
their order turned to dust
fulfilling our destiny
we lay waste the world of god

Blood and Spirit
