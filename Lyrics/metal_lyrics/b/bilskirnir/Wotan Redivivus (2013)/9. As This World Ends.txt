When this world has come to an end
and all life faded away
when all the gods have died
and only chaos remains

When the sun sank below into the sea
what will be left
when the final battle has been fought?

Will there be new life
born into a new world?
Will there be new light
born out of darkness?

What life will have meant
if we ceased to exist?
Is there a second spring
for our kind in sight?

As this world ends
the cycle will be closed
the dawning of a new golden age
born from Ragnaroks flames
