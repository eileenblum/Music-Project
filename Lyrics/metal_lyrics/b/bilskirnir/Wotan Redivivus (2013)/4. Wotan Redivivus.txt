Howling winds in lonely nights
when the forest begins to speak
telling of ancient battles and victories
that took place long ago

The whispering of the wind
brings voices from ancient times long gone
speaking of what once was
again it shall be once more

The one-eyed master of life and death
lord of the runes, the highest one
sorcerer king of supernatural force
sleeping yet, but for how long?

Hail our gods, still alive in our blood
in times of greatest unrest
theyâll come to life again
Wotan shall rise once more
and nature will reign again
