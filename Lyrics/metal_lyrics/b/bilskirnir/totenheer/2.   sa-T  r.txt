Power of the order in multiversum 
Progenitor of mankind 
you gave your hand 
So Fenris trusted 

The ordered society succeeded 
And twins became from the duality... 

On the firmament the brightest star, 
My path is clear 
No development without war 

The false ego is our enemy 
A look into the foundations of life 
See truth and justice 
Bravery and honour 

I distinguish
