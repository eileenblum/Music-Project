[originally by Burzum]Tears from the eyes so cold, tears from the eyes, in the grass so green. 
As I lie here, the burden is being lifted once and for all, once and for all. 
Beware of the light, it may take you away, to where no evil dwells. 
It will take you away, for all eternity. 
Night is so beautiful (we need her as much as we need Day).
