To reach for the ancient land in the ultimate of north
Where pride and purity led to nobility
Idealism as the highest order
In accordance to natures eternal law of life
All falsehood unable to conquer our minds
Omnipresent was the god within ourselves

Suddenly... materialism became part of our lives
So the unity was disbanded
Soon we forgot about our inner voice
Man's instinct overcome by superiosity

Violation of the immortal soul
By deafening the voice of blood
Mental enslavement of the mind
So the highest principles faded into unconsciousness
What once was pure and noble turned into mediocrity
From the pillars of civilization to spiritual decay

No blazing shine left in the eyes
Seemingly awake, yet already asleep
Will that slumber lead to everlasting death
or is fate going to be changed before?

If the divine spark in our soul
Is to become a rising flame once again
A new aristocracy, not of gold
But of spirit will rise again!

From the ashes of decay
A new union will evolve
The highest principle back in full-force
And idealism will lead us again to nobility...
