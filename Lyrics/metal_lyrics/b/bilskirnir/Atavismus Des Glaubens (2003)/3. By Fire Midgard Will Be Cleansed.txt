Raise your flaming sword from the abyssic south
To bring forth world's downfall
Chaos, destruction, extinction, rebirth
By fire, midgard shall be cleansed

The old earth has to fade away
To give place for the new creation
In the glowing splendour of muspels fire
The essence of the cosmic order is revealed

Order emerging from chaos
Life from death
Extinction leads to resurrection
Out of ruins the new world shall arise
