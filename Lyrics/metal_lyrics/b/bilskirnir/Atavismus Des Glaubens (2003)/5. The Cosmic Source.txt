Above the sky stars dance when I gaze
into the bright sculpture of my spirits shadowside
she, the shining lady is a part of me
like I'm an element of the glowing lord;
ruler of the days

In the cosmic deeps I see the shape of a human
see a reflection of my truest inside

I'm united with the wisdom
the only wisdom wich exists...
Forever!
I'm this water, eternal life
I'm this fire, will!

I'm this earth, awareness!
I'm this air, omniscience!
Eather

Time and room as fiction only
purest substance
where there's no beginning and no end
the source of wich I drink,
source of all life and existence...
