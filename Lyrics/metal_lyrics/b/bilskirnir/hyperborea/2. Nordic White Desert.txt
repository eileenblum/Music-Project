Crystal clear, white and pure
Too thick to see soil
Eternal shining majesty
The weakness shall recoil

Mother northland, icelike entity
Your children will prevail
Predictor of the rising age
Your order shall unveil

Unvaried since a thousand years
Unvarnished shining entity
Unvanguished is your seed
Unvanguished is your purity
And unvanguished is your folk

If one day your end will come
We shall die by your side
While others die by decrepitness
We will die in fight

WeÂ´ll cure the world or die of it
The fate will guide the aim
But when we drown, before the silence comes
The world will tremble, quake and cry
But when we drown, before the silence comes
The world will know itÂ´s blame

Unvarnished shining entity
Your landscapes so supernal
Even if they murder us all
Your spirit lives eternal!

The flesh may die
The ice may melt
The spirit lives eternal
