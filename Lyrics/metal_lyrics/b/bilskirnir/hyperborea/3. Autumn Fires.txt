Opened the portals to the worlld beyond
Emerging from the shadows
The wind carries their whispering
Echoes from days of old

As the summer leaves
And life fades away
The spirit of the dead
Awaits to return

Autumn fires are burning
To light their ways
Sacred this night is
When boundaries of life and death disappear

When the dead leave their realm
To touch the world of mortals
For some of us to hear

When the dead leave their realm
To touch the world of mortals
For some of us to see

When the dead leave their realm
To touch the world of mortals
Just a few will understand

Let the fires burn bright
To guard their ways
Closing the circle of life and death
This night belongs to the dead...
