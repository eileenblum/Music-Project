I know a land
Deep in the north
A place for men of iron

Darkness and light
Power and might
The inner conflict solved as a circle
An ancient rice of supernatural sight
Into a spiritual worlds disguising miracle
Of death and of life
Of eternal strife
For strength and wisdom
And for to survive

And trough fire and ice they were formed,
Through a life that was a struggle...

Supernal
Infernal
Internal arising
While the south is disguising
The nordic titans stood strong and proud

The voice of winter
The voice of woods
The voice of a land,
Where snow and ice are never gone

In ancient times
In the ancient empire
In the time as snow covered the hyperboream soil
