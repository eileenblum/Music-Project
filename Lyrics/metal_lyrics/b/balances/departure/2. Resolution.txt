Thousands of lives
passing before my throne
Marching to the sound of my voice
Thousands of lives
Muted by my fury
Who will survive?

Their fates in the palm of my hand
I'll make a fist
I'll strike them down
None will survive

Admit your defeat
and show us your heart,
The heart of a coward

And the insight surfaced,
The truth revealed
You realize,
You can't stand your own ground

Among the raging chaos
Only one soul succeeds
Among his dying comrades
Only one man still stands

Only he stands

The lifelong strife, his only teacher
The bitterness of solitude,
his greatest strength

This nightmare is his life

Thousands of lives
passing before my throne
Marching to the sound of my voice

Can you see it in his eyes?
He has the strength to carry on
