I broke through
Wave after wave
The tide won't take me in tonight
Here amongst grief stricken ghosts
The perpetual motion of the ocean
Soothing the bitter taste of decisions made

Look at what we have become
A sad parade with nothing
Left to lose or gain anymore

Never forget
I am the one
Who had the choice to make
Who carries the weight

My song has long been sung
but you can make yours count
Don't make the same mistakes
Don't make my mistakes

Whatever wave may come
I will not be washed away
On the shore I reside
An unceasing monument of sin

These words repeating endlessly

I realize
That you will never understand
But all i did,
All the sacrifice
Was for you

Our choices became
The oceans between us
Drifting further away
