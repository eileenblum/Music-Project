Here I stand
Severed from the strings
on which you used to play
You brought out the worst in me
I rose from the depths
As a tower above you
No other way out
I can't hold back anymore
Abandon all hope

My eyes radiate with the fury of the sun
You grew a plague in my heart

No escape, no shelter
I am the fear
No safety, no rest
I am the retribution
There is no hope for you

No more chances
I won't rest until
I hold you lifeless
in my arms

I am the architect to your ruin
the witness of your fall
I am your creation
Nothing more but what you've made of me

This cannot be undone
This cannot be undone
this will not be undone

No escape, no shelter
I am the fear
No safety, no rest
I am the retribution
There is no hope for you

face the threatening sky
I bring nothing but your end
face the threatening sky
I am nothing but your end
