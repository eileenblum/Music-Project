More and more
I am growing to hate
these decisive moments
I remember how you used to be
But look at you now, (look at you now)
An empty husk with no sense of identity

A choice has to be made
Will I turn away or
reach out..?

Remember those who lost it all
Or will you let them fade away
forever!?
But now..You've become..You've become faceless!

These vacant eyes tell the bitter story of change
Fear what you have become

I thought your image was burned in my eye
Seems like time disintegrates all

I believed that I would never forget you
Memories never persist

Fear what you have become

I hate these decisive moments
But my choice is made
The faintest of memories reignites

My choice is made
I will set you free
Follow me in to the..
the horizon

Remember those who lost it all
Or will you let them fade away
forever
