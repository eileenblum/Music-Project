You find yourself on your knees again
Withered hands lifted to the sky
Begging for a sign 
Sheltered in the wreckage that is your life

Wrapped in misery, the spirit is broken.
Drowning in defeat
Warmth is only a distant memory

Weighted down and burned out
Your aspirations, 
all ground to dust
Hidden behind a mask of circumstance

Passion will stir again,
In blood that flows slowly
These paths you have tread in vain,
Are lessons well learnt
Your youth may have flown,
But there is more to you than you know
Restore what you have lost
Believe me when I say,
We have all been there,
We are seeking

We are searching
We are seeking

Your life is neither empty nor worthless
Even though Fate has again and again, trodden over your existence
What matters is to accept the inevitable 
Take in all the sweetness and the bitterness
and accept full responsibility for it all

Life is a long, endless night
Unbearable 
If not for the occasional sparkle of light,
the glimmer of hope
The Sudden brightness and warmth
Comforting and wonderful
Justifying the years of darkness

Are you ready to live again?
Climb from this wreckage
to meet the rising sun

The night stretches out before us

Endlessly
