Burn my eyes,
Exhausted by senseless motions.
The fires all died out
Left to here to witness
Inert
I can only look upon
these husks bleeding in desolation

Animosity has become the air that we breathe
Every notion of sanity is laid to rest

Gather around the pyre
Cast aside the world with me,
I have seen humanity
The true face of man

I have seen the faces of demons and fiends
Man has bled dry the sky

And listen to the tale of a shattered son
Found crawling through a distant semblance of life
A man, a shade
Lost all he held dear

Staring through the eyes of a bitter soul
They took away my hopes, my dreams, my ghost and my words
Driven into madness, I have lost all control
Memories etched into my skin, steel married to my flesh

I breath bitter air
Contempt is born,
Hatred forms purpose
This is what I had to become

Can you see the misery lingering in the empty shell
The twisted pain of living
Anger, unwilling to subside
Forgive me for what I have become
Can you see the heartbreak written in that wretched face
Love torn violently from his life
From this life
