This structure is a misconception
With origins rooted so deep,
we lost sight of the point of inception
Your life becomes another lie

Architects behind hidden walls 
define every step between earth and sky

Your reality
is tearing at its seams

Break the chains that bind you to this cage 
Sever lifelines and feel What it means to be free
Every choice and consequence will belong to you (to you)
You will become the master of your fate

Listen, you who sit nearest to the thrones of creators and liars,
weaving,Â 
inescapable devices for every kind beyond counting.
We sever the strings
We will no longer be bound
The scales have tipped
The Moirai have fallen
Iâll bring you their heads
And theyâll call me the sistersâÂ 

SLAUGTHER
(My Life will be my own)
Pass the torch onâ¦
(My Path will be my own)
Pass the torch onâ¦
(My Truth will be my own)
Pass the torch onâ¦
(My end will be my own)

Atrophos
I will not be subdued
