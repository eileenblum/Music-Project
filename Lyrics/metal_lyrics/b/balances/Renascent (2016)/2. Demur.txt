Each spoken word, embellished over time
You were not meant to be what you are now
Each told lie becomes another truth
You realize that the pressure is building up

A carefully constructed myth, rupturing
Without foundations, destined to cave in
I incite the fire in the hearts of the masses
I bestow upon them sight
So that they may finally see

Your cracked mask locked on festering thoughts
A voice so loud
To drown the silence in your chest
I only hear your faint whisper
A soft hush of admittance 

The whole world will finally see
You are just another deceiver with the face of a leader
The whole world will finally see
The wretched hands that guided them

The manufactured truth, withered over time
You were not meant to be what you are now
Built on delusions, destined to cave in
The walls are coming down
Brace yourself
You have lost your hold
The masses answered the call
Empty  words wonât save you now

Iâll stare into your false eyes
And watch how the life in them dies
