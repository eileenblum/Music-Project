Another failed attempt, 
to understand the gravity of this situation
My mind is lost on complexity beyond grasp
Untangle knots, retrace steps and dissect the dialogue

Breathe in every disappointment

You reached out to me
The sun behind grey sky
Warmth in a winter night
The trails still linger in the room
Echoes softly resonate
What remains?
A lost soul yearning for an end

This cannot be what was meant for us
The trails still linger
And you have made your final attempt

The shards of a broken bond grace the barren floor
An urge to be complete takes over
Deep wounds grace open hands
A shattered mirror,
Reflecting back at me
A broken man

This was always meant for me 
This is destiny
Miles down this beaten path
Staring down a bottomless abyss
Gaze fixed,
At peace with my disbelief
Render me to the void
The one place I belong

Liberated of all hindrances
Separated from this world
No one can save me now

I am too far gone
I am too far gone
