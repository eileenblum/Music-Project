Time is coming to an end
I witness another new beginning 
The cycle never ends

I am the one,
who perceives beyond the veil of time and space
Reaching in to the void, where all threads unfold
Behold the pattern, the perfect symmetry
Walking the fault line between possibility and reality

Under a scorching desert sun,
The pattern unravels before me
I witness how all things move 
Dancing to the cadence of time

The spectral lines align
The truth you know is a lie
I am less than a god
More than a man
I am renascent

Can I change the outcome?
Can I alter this state?
I am more than a man
Can I change the outcome?
Which path to take?
It all unravels in my wake

You will bleed
Efforts to change the way are broken
You will suffer
Cannot stop what you have started

It is like I lived a billion lives, all at once
An experience that is tearing me apart
Nothing you can comprehend
(youâll never understand)
Raging in denial against my inner self
Amidst infinity, endless movement 
Aware of the universe,
It takes everything to remain whole

I am the first, the last
I am everything

Only I will remain
