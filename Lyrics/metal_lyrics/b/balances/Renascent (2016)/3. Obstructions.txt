You can never be on the top of the world
its weight is holding you down

Disregard everything, time to push forward
(Cast aside all these obstructions and sever the ties
You will have to give meaning to your own life)

You will never scale these walls with all of these burdens chained to your neck

Disregard everything and everyone
Or I swear Iâll break your fucking neck
