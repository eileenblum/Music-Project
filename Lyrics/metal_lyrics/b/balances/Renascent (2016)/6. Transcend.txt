Life is cruel
I have seen how you were torn apart by circumstance
There is no reason in nature
Donât tremble nor cower
We all have the potential to 
Ascend beyond this helpless state
Let fortune play its ruthless game

if only for a moment
We can be stronger than nature and fate,
if only for a moment
We can conquer our innate fear

And when the black depths are silent, 
And the grey skies are still.
We can rise to meet the odds
We can be gods

Stretch out a commanding hand and create 
Leave this material plane

But It hurts, to walk this road alone
Death and fortune have taken their heavy toll
And when the black depths are silent,
And the grey skies are still
I swear I will sing this song
This melody you have become

Without fear
But with determination
We live

(We cannot evade life's course,
but we can strengthen ourselves
to be superior to fortune
to look unflinchingly upon the most painful things
Out of sounds, words, 
we construct purpose,
songs full of meaning, consolation and goodness,
more beautiful and enduring than the grim sport of fortune and destiny )
