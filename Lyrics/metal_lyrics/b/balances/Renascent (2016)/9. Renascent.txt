At last I have reached my journeyâs end
This is where my dearest dreams have ranged
The solace my restless soul has yearned 
to hear the universe and all of existence in its innate harmony.
In this vastness, enveloped
How could I have been left unchanged?
Renewed my vision, Revived my senses
I have been reborn

I finally see, 
there is no one to save us from ourselves
