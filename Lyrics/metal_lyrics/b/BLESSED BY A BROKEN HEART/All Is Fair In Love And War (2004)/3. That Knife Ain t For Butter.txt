I know it's hard to go against the current
I know it's hard to fight these moments
And I know what it's like
I've let my guard down so many times before

Giving into temptation with no second thoughts
Keep saying how this will never hurt you in the long run
But know it only takes a few moments to kill yourself
Now stand back from his murder suicide pact

Still you'll fall to the comfort of a murderer a victim to your own desires
Let him tell you how beautiful you are and that you mean everything to him

Until all of his sweetness turns to rage and his smile starts to decay
Rest assured you're still beautiful to him
butyou were just another peice of meat
For him to sink his teeth in your pure blood
So, make your bed, lie in it
or dig your grave and die in it

As the tension builds the air is dry
and a spark could light us up
So as you ride the lightning 
Know that you'll get shocked
By the fact this this was a lie
And nothing more then a one night stand
That you'll leave in this body bag.
