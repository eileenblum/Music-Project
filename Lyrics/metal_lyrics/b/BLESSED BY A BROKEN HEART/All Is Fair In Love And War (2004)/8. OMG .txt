Honestly, what sense does it make
to defame a thing you won't acknowledge
When all is good and well,
you'll shower yourself with pride
When all is good and well, you'll still deny him

When tragedy strikes
you're so quick to point the finger
And you'll blame it all on my God
The blame game has gone on too long
does it make you feel like a winner
And you'll blame it all on my God

Honestly, what sense does it make
to defame a thing you won't acknowledge
Still you curse his name and use it in vain
Still you curse his name and use it in vain

When tragedy strikes 
you're so quick to point the finger
And you'll blame it all on my God
The blame game has gone on too long
does it make you feel like a winner
And you'll blame it all on my God

Say your prayers
When the end comes will you put your faith in man?
The end is drawing near

As you watch with grinding teeth and witness the end of man
Know it,s not too late to fall to your knees and ask for mercy
As you cry out OH MY GOD
