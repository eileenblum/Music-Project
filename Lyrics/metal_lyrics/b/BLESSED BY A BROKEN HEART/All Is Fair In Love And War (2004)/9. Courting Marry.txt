Why must you reduce yourself to this
Aren't you tired of coming back for more
Can't you see that comfort is just a prayer away
So let your feet shatter the pavement
As you run from this pain

Racing your pulse beats faster
Don't look down you're almost there
Searching but always finding
vacant eys and shallow graves

A soul of lust controlled by flesh
An urge to be nothing more is sickening
They want to rape your sanctity and it's sickening

Shallow shallow moods to suit you, 
deadly deadly looks to move you
Using a killer time with a touch of indescretion
