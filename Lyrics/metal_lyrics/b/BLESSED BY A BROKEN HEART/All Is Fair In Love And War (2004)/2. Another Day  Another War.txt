Again I try to reach a mile on broken legs
How many times, must you watch me as I fall
I guess until I can't get up on my own anymore

Another day
Another war
Another battle
I've been let down
I've been beat down

And all I get from my peers is a blank stare
Empty words and a cold shoulder
But silence would say so much more
I can't make it on my own
Not by myself
I'll suffer no more

Another day
Another war
Another battle
I've been let down
I've been beat down
I'll walk to the battleground
And wage war on this world
