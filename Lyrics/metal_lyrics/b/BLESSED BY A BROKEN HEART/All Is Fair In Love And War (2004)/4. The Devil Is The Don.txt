For far too long I have sailed
through the oceans of sorrow
Uknowing of where I would fail next
Uknowing of my failures to come

Come in different shaped
Come in different shades
But through the fog that blinded me
I saw a light shine so bright

And I promised myself to follow it's path
And now I am led by the light
The waves may crash, trying to mislead me
The whirlpool will try to swallow me whole

I might let myself get carried away
But my faith in anchored to my soul
I can go so fast with cement shoes
But as I clench to the rock

No ocean will overcome me
Nothing will stand in my way,
For through this storm I see the light
It's only a matter of a lifetime before I'm home
