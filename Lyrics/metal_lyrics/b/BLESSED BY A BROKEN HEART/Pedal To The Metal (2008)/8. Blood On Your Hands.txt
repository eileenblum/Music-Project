[guitar solo]

I'm waiting for the day this finds you
They'll give a piece so heavy you wont know what to do
What comes around, Comes around and it's coming your way
I know it's coming, you'll hear the victims say

Please tell me, how could you?
Please tell me, 'cause I'm dying to know!
Please tell me, how could you?
Please tell me, how could you take it away?

And go with your life
How can you live with the blood on your hands?
I'm waiting for the day when you open your eyes
And see the blood is on your hands

Can't get the blood off your hands [x2]

You left your hustle far behind you
Run with the devil till your life was almost through
You thought you could get away get away with it all
Who's gonna catch you? Who's gonna catch you?

Please tell me, how could you?
Please tell me, 'cause I'm dying to know!
Please tell me, how could you?
Please tell me, how could you take it all away?

And go with your life
How can you live with the blood on your hands?
I'm waiting for the day when you open your eyes
And see the blood is on your hands

Can't get the blood off your hands

All day this this blood could take your guilt away, guilt away
All day this this blood could take your pain away, can't get the blood off your hands
All day this this blood could take your guilt away, guilt away
All day this this blood could take your fears away, can't get the blood off your hands

Please tell me!
How could you?
Please tell me, how could you take it away?

And go with your life
How can you live with that blood on your hands?
I'm waiting for the day when you open your eyes
And see the blood that's on your hands [x2]

Can't get the blood off your hands [x6]
