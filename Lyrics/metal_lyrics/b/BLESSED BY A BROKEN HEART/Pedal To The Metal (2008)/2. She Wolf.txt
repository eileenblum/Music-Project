Eyes of fire
Voice like thunder
Teeth like a knife
That will tear at your skin

Sheâs a hunter
And sheâs hungry
For the guilty
And the innocent

Like a demon
Like the angel of light
She wants to take your soul
And watch it ignite

They want her dead
Or they want her alive
But sheâs a wolf that just doesnât die

Sheâll bring you to your knees
Down to your knees
No one will hear you scream

She wolf
Into the night she roams
She wolf
Donât walk the streets alone
Into the night she roams
She wolf
Donât walk the streets alone

Got a shiver down my spine
And a thought running through my mind
Know who it is, wonât turn around
Run for my life but sheâs gaining ground

Eyes of fire
Voice like thunder
I keep on running
Till I canât hear the sound

Sheâs out to kill
Set to destroy
I donât want to be
Her chewing toy

Take her back
Where she belongs

Itâs a vicious attack
So watch your back
And donât stop running
