Don't stand still
Or life will pass you by
You're getting weaker
You're getting weaker
And I

won't wait for tomorrow
I made up my mind
We're running out
We're running out
Of time

Together
We will conquer
The impossible baby

Don't stop
Baby don't stop
Till you feel the burn
Baby don't stop
Just don't stop

Nothing
Will stand in our way
If our hearts are aflame

On the move
Pushing it to overdrive
I'm getting stronger
I'm getting stronger
And I

Won't forget
The reason for my life
I won't wither away
I won't wither away
And die

Push it
To the limit
