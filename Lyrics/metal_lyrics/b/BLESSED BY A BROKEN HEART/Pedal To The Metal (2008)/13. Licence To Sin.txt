Rolling the red dice

This is your final score
Walking on thin ice
Away from the shore

He paid a high price
Gave you an open door
Offered a new life
One worth dying for

This is your Final score
This is your license to sin
This is your Open door
And I wonât let you
Fall away from Him

Calling you out
But you ignore
Rolling the red dice
Is that worth dying for

Crossing the red line
Into the dangerzone
Grieving the divine
Denying your savior

Come on and roll the dice
Or youâll pay the price

This is your final score
This is your open door
This is your license to sin

Donât roll the red dice
The odds are against you when the world is on your side

This is your Final score
This is your license to sin
This is your Open door
And I wonât let you
Fall away from Him
