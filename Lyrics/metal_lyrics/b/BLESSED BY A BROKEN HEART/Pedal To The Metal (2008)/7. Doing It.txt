Itâs not about
About the money
Itâs not about
About the fame

Itâs not about
About the honeys
Itâs not about
About the game

Doing it for the rock

Pushing it
To the limit
Giving it
All weâve got

This is how we do it
How we do it
For the rock

So youâll know
When everything is said and done
Weâll be doing it for the rock
So youâll know
When the world is dead and gone
Weâll be doing it
For the rock

This is how we do it
This is how we do
