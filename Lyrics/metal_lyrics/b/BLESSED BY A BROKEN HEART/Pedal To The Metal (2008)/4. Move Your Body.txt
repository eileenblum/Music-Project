Let's go
We came to rock your town
To show you what itâs like to get down
So turn it up, step it up, move your body right
Show us what you got, before we ride into the night

Rocking this hard never felt so good
So move your body right, like you know you should
Throw your hands up, into the air
And wave them all around like you just donât care

Keep your bodies moving to the rhythm of the beat
Keep your bodies moving, keep your bodies grooving

Move your body, move, move your body
Schools out and itâs time to party
Move your body, move, move your body
Weâve got rock, we donât need your money

Throw your hands up
And wave them like you just donât care
Do the robot
Like you were made with syllon hardware
Throw your hands up
And wave them like you just donât are
Do the robot
Come on let me see you through your hands up in the air

Move to the music
Groove you can do it
