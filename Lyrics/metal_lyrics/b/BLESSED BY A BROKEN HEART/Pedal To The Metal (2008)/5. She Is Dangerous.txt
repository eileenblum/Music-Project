Danger is her middle name
Murder is her favorite game
She's the devil in disguise

The first time we kissed
I knew she was dangerous
don't believe her lies

Gotta escape
From this place
Before it's too late

She is dangerous
Oh so dangerous
She is dangerous

She is dangerous
Oh so dangerous
She's out of control
And her hearts on a one way road
So where's she gonna go

Danger is running through her veins
Murder is her claim to fame
And she's out to be a star

She is dangerous
Just remember this
Don't let her get very far

Gotta escape
From this place
Before it's too late

She is dangerous
Oh so dangerous
She is dangerous

She is dangerous
Oh so dangerous
She's out of control
And her hearts on a one way road
So where's she gonna go

She is nothing but danger
