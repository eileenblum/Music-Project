Crash into reality
The truth is that we'll always suffer
This is our reality
And know that we will always suffer
We'll overcome this world
And pray for better days
If you feel like giving up baby well don' t turn around
Be strong , hold on
we will carry on

I'll take your burdens upon my shoulders
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for every breath you take
I'll be there through every move you make

We'll overcome this world
And pray for better days
Facing this reality
We always look for something better
Forget this reality
For we were meant for something greater
If you feel like giving up baby well don' t turn around

Be strong, hold on
we will carry on
I'll take your burdens upon my shoulders
By the grace of God we will carry on
