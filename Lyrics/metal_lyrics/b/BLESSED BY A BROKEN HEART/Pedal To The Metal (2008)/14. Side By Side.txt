Under fire
Lead by our hearts desire
To make it out of this hell alive

We won't give in
We won't back down
We won't give up
We'll stand our ground
I know well make it out of here
Side by

Side by side
So take my hand
Take my hand
Side by side
And never look back

I'm not leaving you behind baby
Take my hand
We'll make it out alive
I'm not leaving you behind baby
Take my hand
Were going side by side

Under fire
The need for rescue is dire
They say our savior is not alive

We won't give in
We won't back down
We won't give up
We'll stand our ground
Don't worry girl I know our savior is
By our

Side by side
So take my hand
Take my hand
Side by side
And never look back

I'm not leaving you behind baby
Take my hand
We'll make it out alive
I'm not leaving you behind baby
Take my hand
We're going side by side

They will drown in the blood
Of their final solution
As it fills their lungs
They will hear exaltations
To the king of kings
