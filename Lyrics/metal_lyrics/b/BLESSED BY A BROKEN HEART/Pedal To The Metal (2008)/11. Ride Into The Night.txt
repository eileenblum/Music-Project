Our engines roar
As we soar right out of sight
Ride into the night

This speed could kill us
But it makes us feel alive
Ride with all our might

Weâve done this wrong for so long
We need to make things right
Our shoulders this will lay on
Donât stop until its light

Ride into the night
Tomorrow might be to late
Ride into the night
To fight for love to reign
We ride

There is no turning back
We need to win this fight
Ride into the night

Weâll do whatever it takes
Weâll take this to the sky
Ride with us tonight

If we ride into the night
We can make it right
We can win this fight

If we ride till the morning light
With all our might
We can win this fight
