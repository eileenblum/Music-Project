Iâm torn between two loves
By one and want whatâs mine
Too serious up until I lied
Iâll never let it go
They all do
So youâre so beautiful
But you never understand
Iâll never let it go
Never let it go

Do I give end?
To this formality
Or do I chase whatâs in my heart?
You cannot escape this
Love nightmare
Is what we share
Love nightmare
But you donât care
Love nightmare

This crazy girl wants motivation
I gazed her â¦
What you say why now?
And I do â¦
You should have never slipped on snakes
And now youâre saying with regret
While I sing this song
Iâm going to go for broke

Do I give end?
To this formality
Or do I chase whatâs in my heart?
You cannot escape this
Love nightmare
Is what we share
Love nightmare
But you donât care
Love nightmare

â¦

Love nightmare
Is what we share
Love nightmare
But you donât care
Love nightmare
Is what we share
Love nightmare
But you donât care
Love nightmare
Love nightmare
Love nightmare
Love nightmare
