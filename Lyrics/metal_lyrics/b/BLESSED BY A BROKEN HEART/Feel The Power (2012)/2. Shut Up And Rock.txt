Things are finally going my way
Iâm feeling great today
I can sense a crazy night
Can you feel it?
I can feel it
Friday night is just going to break
Just trying to wreck my â¦
Not listening to any rules
Itâs been great for days

Is that what you want?
Nobodyâs going to listen
You talk too much
Donât ever make her do it
Give me a break
Loosen up
Get out of my face
Burning shock and her body just donât stop
No way
Shut up and rock
Hey, hey, hey turn it up louder
Feed that track till you feel the power
Hey, hey you know we ainât going to stop
So make your head
Shut up and rock yea

Consider yourselves to be so not
The world raise
Weâll rob you back
But things are going to change tonight
Can you feel it?
I can feel it
Feel the music as it runs in your veins
One beast I canât became
So show you donât ever change
Need to lose and youâll never be the same

Is that what you want?
Nobody going to listen
Is that what you want?
Nobodyâs going to listen
You talk too much
Donât ever make her do it
Give me a break
Loosen up
Get out of my face
Burning shock and her body just donât stop
No way
Shut up and rock
Hey, hey, hey turn it up louder
Feed that track till you feel the power
Hey, hey, you know we ainât going to stop
So make your head
Shut up and rock

Give me a break
Loosen up
Get out of my face
Give me a break
Loosen up
Get out of my face
Shut up and rock
Hey, hey, hey turn it up louder
Feed that track till you feel the power
Hey, hey you know we ainât going to stop
So make your head
Shut up and rock
Hey, hey, hey turn it up louder
Feed that track till you feel the power
You got to feel the power
You know we ainât going to stop
So make your head
Shut up and rock
Shut up and rock
Shut up and rock
