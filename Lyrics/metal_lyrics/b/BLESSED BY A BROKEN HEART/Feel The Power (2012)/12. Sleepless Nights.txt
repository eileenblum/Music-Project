I got a secret to tell
Iâm sick and tired of these conflicts and lies
And these sleepless nights
Got to freak out of this cell
Got to astray it from hell
I see the fire burning in her eyes
Mom crash and dies inside
Iâm hypnotized
Can you close my eyes?
Staring at the ceiling
I lie away and I canât escape the way Iâm feeling

There will be no more
No more sleepless nights
Takes more than a lot to make this right
There will be no more
Sleepless nights
Sleepless nights no more
Iâm only known without you in my life

Iâm toss and turning my bed
Youâre even holy in my wildest dreams
Just like a horror scene
That I can never forget
Canât get you out of my head
Open your eyes baby canât you see?
Youâre not the one for me
This hereâs a â¦
Drip in regret
Wish I never met her
I made up my mind
And now itâs time to say itâs over

There will be no more
Sleepless nights
No more sleepless nights
Takes more than a lot to make this right
There will be no more
Sleepless nights
Sleepless nights no more
Iâm only known without you in my life

There will be no more
Sleepless nights
No more sleepless nights
Takes more than a lot to make this right
There will be no more
Sleepless nights
Sleepless nights no more
Iâm only known without you in my life

Yea Iâm moving on
Say your goodbyes cause now Iâm gone
