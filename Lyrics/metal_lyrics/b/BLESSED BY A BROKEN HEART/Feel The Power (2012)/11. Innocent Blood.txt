Take my reflection
And bury it away
I walk the road to fire
Accountable for the mistakes you made
Itâs just deception
In everything you say
You got a way weâre used to prove
Let me the first to pay

This blood was mine
Iâve lived a longer time
It takes a stronger man to do this
Baby you should be
In the fire next to me
I can see the truth inside your eyes

Thereâs no redemption
There is no other way
The sound of grinding teeth
And screaming getting louder every day
You got my attention
What was I thinking of?
Thereâs no way back for me
Thatâs the one thing Iâm afraid of
What it takes to walk the land?
What it takes to walk the land?
Iâm a stronger man
You will doâ¦
Iâm a stronger man
You donât stand a chance
Iâm a stronger man
You donât stand a chance

Baby you should be
Baby you should be
In the fire next to me
In the fire next to me
Baby you should be
Baby you should be
In the fire next to me
In the fire next to me

This blood was mine
Iâve lived a longer time
It takes a stronger man to do this
Baby you should be
In the fire next to me
I can see the truth inside your eyes

This blood was mine
Iâve lived a longer time
And it takes a stronger man to do this
Baby you should be
Baby you should be
In the fire next to me
In the fire next to me
I can see the truth inside your eyes
I can see the truth inside your eyes
