I found the one thing
That opens up my mind
Itâs stealing all the noise inside
Shot and bring my world to life

If itâs all this right
Then maybe you should know
If itâs in my reach
Iâll never let it go
Walk the right road
Never leave you down
Iâll take you to the place â¦
Scream it like you mean it
Baby one more time
My ambition
To follow my own vision
Something I could never do without

Iâll go the distance
Iâll give all Iâve got to give
Find the words that you will fit
So my soul becomes a port of it

If itâs all this right
Then maybe you should know
If itâs in my reach
Iâll never let it go
Walk the right road
Never leave you down
Iâll take you to the place â¦
Scream it like you mean it
Baby one more time
My ambition
To follow my own vision
Something I could never do without

Walk the right road
Never leave you down
Iâll take you to the place â¦
Scream it like you mean it
Baby one more time
My ambition
To follow my own vision
Something I could never do without

Walk the right road
Never leave you down
Iâll take you to the place â¦
Scream it like you mean it
Baby one more time
My ambition
To follow my own vision
Something I could never do without
