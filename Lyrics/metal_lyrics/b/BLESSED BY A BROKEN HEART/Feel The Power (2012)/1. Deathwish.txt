Burn down the track
She's like a psycho and she's ready to snap
Out for the trill, shoot to kill
She's goin' down and there's no turning back
And now she's runnin', but you know she won't get too far
And now she's gunnin', just a matter of time before she loses it all

You know your walls are closing in
Your shining light is growing dim

Mama sold her soul to the Devil
Traded a kiss for a birthday deathwish
Mama sold her soul to the Devil
Traded her pain for the love of cocaine
Mama sold her soul to the Devil
Traded a kiss for a birthday deathwish
Mama sold her soul
She sold her soul to the Devil

Back for the attack
She's goin' hard and she's ready to crack
You roll the dice, pay the price
She's hit the bottom and there's no tuning back
And now she's stumbin', but you know she's too far gone
And now she's crumblin', Death is callin',
Mama please hold on!

I knew it was a problem, but not to this extent
I closed my eyes and mouth for way too long
I remember when you held me, and told me everything would be okay
Now all I have are these memories and hopes for better days

Mama sold her soul, yeah she sold her soul
Sold her soul, sold her soul
Mama sold her soul to the Devil
