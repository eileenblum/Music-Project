Seventy-five down to one on one
Got the soft tail out in this midnight sun
With my knees to the breeze
And the party thatâs always on my mind
Cause there ainât no party alive anymore
Iâm a side to arrive
And youâre begging for more
And Iâm rolling into me
Right now itâs time

Cause you know
That where I go
The party is my show
Rockinâ all night
Party to the day light
Having the time of our lives
Rockinâ all night
Yea weâre rockinâ baby
Party to the day light
Yea weâre going crazy
Having the time of our lives

Wearing our hearts on these cut out sleeves
And weâre dancing like weâre thick as thieves
If thereâs ever been a moment that should be suspended in time
Got my girl, my guitar, everything I need
And the sunrise waving back at me
And weâre leaving cares and worries all behind

Cause you know
That where I go
The party is my show
Rockinâ all night
Party to the day light
Having the time of our lives
Rockinâ all night
Come on and move your body
Party to the day light
Yea weâre going to dis on the party
Having the time of our lives

Everybody sing along
Party to the break of dawn
Everybody sing my song
Weâre going to be rockinâ all night long
Everybody sing along
Party to the break of dawn
Everybody sing my song
Weâre going to be rockinâ all night long

Rockinâ all night
Party to the day light
Having the time of our lives
Yea having the time of our lives
Rockinâ all night
Party to the day light
Party to the day light
Having the time of our lives
Itâs about time I found life
Having the time of our lives
