In my life I've had things that couldn't last forever.

I always lived so fast, you wanted to move on
'Til I looked round and all my closest friends were gone
Time can strip you of your feelings if you let it
If I get back on that bus then baby, I'll regret it.

Could it be 
That you were everything I wanted
You helped keep my feet on the ground
I never felt this way 'til now

In my life I've had things that couldn't last forever.
Forever
In my dreams
You and me were meant to be together
And last forever
Yeah!

I threw myself under the gears of my routine
Did what I could to try to make it in this scene
I sometimes ask to much of myself to be content with
You singing back to me was my only real incentive

Could it be 
That you were everything I wanted
You helped keep my feet on the ground
I never felt this way 'til, felt this way 'til now

(I never felt this way 'til now)

In my life I've had things that couldn't last forever.
Forever
In my dreams
You and me were meant to be together
And last forever

In my life I've had things that couldn't last forever.
Forever
In my dreams
You and me were meant to be together
And last forever

In my life I've had things that couldn't last forever.
Forever
In my dreams
You and me were meant to be together
And last forever!

Be together
And last forever!
