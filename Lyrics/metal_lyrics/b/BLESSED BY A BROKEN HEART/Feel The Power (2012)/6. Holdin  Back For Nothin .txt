They want to see inside my head
But the truth is, it's empty
I poured out my soul,
Now there's nothing left
Just uninspired roads instead
The sign on the wall tells me
It's all for show
(it's all for show)
Just say the word,
I'm ready to go
I think there's one thing you should know

[Chorus:]
I want it all
You see me comin'
Move outta my way
I'm Holdin' back for nothin'
I'm right here
Better late then never
The time of our lives
Won't wait around forever

Street gangs take the law
Into their own hands
Seeking out one another
Right now, life's cheap
So we gotta keep lookin'
Out for each other
The sign on the wall tells me
It's all for show
(it's all for show)
Just say the word,
I'm ready to go
I think there's one thing you should know

[Chorus:]
I want it all
You see me comin'
Move outta my way
I'm Holdin' back for nothin'
I'm right here
Better late then never
The time of our lives
Won't wait around forever

I'm Right Here!
Move outta my way
I'm Holdin' back for nothin'[x2]

[Chorus:]
I want it all
You see me comin'
Move outta my way
I'm Holdin' back for nothin'
I'm right here
Better late then never
The time of our lives
Won't wait around forever [x2]

I'm Right Here!
Move outta my way
I'm Holdin' back for nothin'[x2]
