Shutting down sea captains
On a Sunday afternoon
No care in the world
Thereâs no way that Iâll be home soon
I have my socks pulled up
And my hat flipped back
Iâm a heat seeking missile
On a one way track
This day means so much to me

I canât stop now
No Iâll never slow down
Iâm going to ride till my body turns to fire
God bless
You and your home
But Iâve got to do this one on my own
Live to ride
Skate or die

Leaning back and power-sliding
With one thing on my mind
Going to live my life and skate will the end of time

I canât stop now
No Iâll never slow down
Iâm going to ride till my body turns to fire
God bless
You and your home
But Iâve got to do this one on my own
Live to ride
Skate or die
Every day I live to ride
So Iâm going to skate or die

This open road is my ticket to freedom
Walk out my back as I seek your kingdom
This open road is my ticket to freedom
Walk out my back as I seek your kingdom

Live to ride
Skate or die
Every day I live to ride
So Iâm going to skate or die
And every day I live to ride
So Iâm going to skate or die
