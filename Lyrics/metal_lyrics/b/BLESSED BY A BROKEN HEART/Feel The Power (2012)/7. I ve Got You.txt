So if you wanna take my hand
This world may never understand
We'll go through thick and thin
Don't let them get you down
We'll face whatever life has planned

We've got each other here, this far...
We've gone through the fire and here we are,
There ain't nothing we can't do 'cause you've got me
and I've got you...

I've got you...

So lets make the most of this time
I can't spend years waiting for a sign...No-oh
No matter where you are I'll get to you somehow
If you let me in, I'll never let you down...Ye-ah
We've come to far to turn back now

We've got each other here, this far...
We've gone through the fire and here we are,
There ain't nothing we can't do 'cause you've got me
and I've got you...
