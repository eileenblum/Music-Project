We pray to the man made god
Our identity all but lost
Ever searching to find yourself
Through this maelstrom of corporate hell
The bending sea attacks the weak
Engulfing the heartfelt world
The waves come crashing down
With arms of bitter savage beasts

Yet we swim this race
Always hampered by the loss of sight
The threat of drowning not enough to quell the sacrifice

But who can recount it all
The high daring in the will
Conscience lost in a tranquil sleep
Drowning yourself in the bending sea
The bending sea attacks the weak
Engulfing the heartfelt world
The waves come crashing down
With arms of bitter savage beasts

Lost as one...
Within the storm and wrath of whirlwind
Mankind lost as one
