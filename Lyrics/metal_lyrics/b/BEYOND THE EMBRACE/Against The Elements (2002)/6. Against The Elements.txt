We're all born with a terminal chip installed
And a noose wrapped around your neck
Now's the time,Fall in line
As you join the world on a steel coffin ride

MY heart burns as I feel my pulse quicken
My only thought is to be erased
To be dissolved like a sunstruck shadow
Across the winds with a serpent smile

One by one we'll be erased
'Til our circuitry gets rearranged
We embrace the sky...why do we fail to fly?

One day,When its time
To bring up forth
And take a loss in your mind
Take it back,Let it go
When it burns red the ashes show

One by one we'll be erased
'Til our circuitry gets rearranged
We embrace the sky...why do we fail to fly?
Yet in awe we try again
We embrace the sky,Why do we fail to fly?
The elements we're up against

Alright!!

One by one we'll be erased
'Til our circuitry gets rearranged
We embrace the sky...why do we fail to fly?
Yet in awe we try again
We embrace the sky...why do we fail to fly?
The elements we're up against
