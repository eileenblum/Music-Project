Chewing on razorblades again
Suckling wounds that forever unend
These bastard screams in whirlwind screams
Spoken tragedy of blackened dreams
Poison words fill the air again
With the strength to tear my skin
As the damned engulf our lives
Following the sea of unlit eyes

Retaliation burns a desperate flame around my throat
The pressure's building up, I want to make my tongue explode

The bastard screams, they keep calling me
Spoken tragedy of blackened dreams
The bastard screams, they keep calling me
Why won't they just let me die?
Won't they let me dye?

Ablaze my soul, feel the blow as I fool and take the delta pain
What I say is that we feed the deltas to the dogs
What I feel, what I know is that I'd find a better life below
Somewhere in the earth, where I won't hear the sound

Retaliation burns a desperate flame around my throat
The pressure's building up, I want to make my tongue explode
If I let go I might have found the way to go
At least I get to feel my nerve

The bastard screams, they keep calling me
Spoken tragedy of blackened dreams
The bastard screams, they keep calling me
Why won't they just let me die?

A bullet doesn't fly a thousand miles away
Just like I couldn't die a thousand deaths
But if I keep this flame of bitterness and hate
It will keep me warm until my dying day

I hear them
I feel them
I loathe them
These words become my world
