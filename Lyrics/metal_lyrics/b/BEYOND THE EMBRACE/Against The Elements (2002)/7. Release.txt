Why am I trapped in these things I feel
An existence so surreal
These fabricated walls that hold me inside
Unjustly charged with my greatest fears
That this existence is a part of it
Every time I try to starve this frenzy, it swallows me

A tortured mind embraced upon sorrow
Holding myself in contempt
The bittersweet emptiness of a man possessed

But I know it won't be long until I let it go
This spirit that resists a world of what is gone
Are we blind too weak to fight
The bending sea, this plague of life
And we compose our lot in life
Blindly searching for ways to go

I've seen the world...can I take the fall?
Should I set resistance free
And let the current carry me
Through this pale glass river to a hollow sea

As I stand upon the shore, I always wanted more
But what I found is that this shit's worth dying for

I've seen the world...can I take the fall?
Should I set resistance free
And let the current carry me
Through this pale glass river to a hollow sea
