Living in a word of what's been said
What I know is I feel dead
Alone and in this world so cold
Emptying the urn of all that'[s left
Burning the candle at both ends
One less flame awaits the dawn

Would I walk right down to the end
And then push my soul right in
As I watch the remains of my soul
Lost in a crimson flow

Seated on the edge of all that's left
An empty shell full of regret
And the burden of life goes on
Praying for the shining light beyond your life
To put an end to your forever lnight
Embraced upon the sorrow razorborn smile

So I walk right down to the end
And I push my soul right in
As I watch the remains of my soul
Lost in a crimson flow

And I watch the remains of my soul

My soul is shut
My soul is shut
My soul is shut
My soul is shut

So I walk right down to the end
And I push my soul right in
As I watch the remains of my soul
Lost in a crimson flow

And I feel that I might be dead
And I know it might be said
Free from this world so dark and cold
