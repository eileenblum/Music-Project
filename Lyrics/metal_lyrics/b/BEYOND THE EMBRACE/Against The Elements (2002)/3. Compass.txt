Leeches behold you bleed our daylight faces
Bastard screams puncture my thundernight
A sickle smile crafting words with a firetongue
My sanity is cast to the worms

And it's over before it's under (The creation of nothingness)
They beckon you with a siren's call
Hedon heralds of the downward spiral

Point me to the sky, let me know
Directions in which I should go
Now's the time, read the signs, follow and prepare new adventures for the 
mind
Until the echoes of the stormbreed have gone

You know your time is wasted, be honest with me
I'll take what's mine, give it back to me
Piece of mind, tranquility
My ears don't listen, they're so full of soil
In this peaceful prison, what's become of my life

(Point me to the sky,) let me know
Directions in which I should go
Now's the time, read the signs, follow and prepare new adventures for the mind
Until the echoes of the stormbreed have gone
