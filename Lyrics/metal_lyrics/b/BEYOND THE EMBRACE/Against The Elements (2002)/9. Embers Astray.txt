Moving out from the inside, we breed our extinction
An approaching era of unlight beyond comprehension
What is what was what went wrong, the screams of the ageless
Brought down by the disease installed in the formula for our creation

We hear the final call
Echoing rage through the blood stained walls
Mother nature can feel the end
The coming face of season hell

When the last rain of judgement washes away
Traces of our existence, burnt embers astray

Encrypted fossils of insight (Explore the enigma)
The tragedies on the human show
Our trusted leaders sell humanity by the pound
For reasons we'll never know

We hear the final call
Echoing rage through the blood stained walls
Mother nature can feel the end
The coming face of season hell

This ship has sailed with ever decreasing profits
While we see the end we refuse to stop it

Why can't we see, until a change is made
Evernight sweeps the other side
Unmask the earth charade
What is me? A smile upon the end
Faithless, soulless, shameless man
Somewhere lost his way

When the last rain of judgement washes away
Traces of our existence, burnt embers astray
