Why is it always so damn hard
When your walls of reason fall apart
Don't know what's right or wrong
Been drinkin' all night long, guess I was doomed right from the start, yeah!

Utopia is what I crave
But every day just stays the same
In this world I've walked alone, now it's time to sell my soul
And sleepwalk to an early grave

Fleshengine breakdown
Fleshengine breakdown give me what I need

Will I see the light and spot the error of my ways
Will I see the light and purify my poison veins
Not tonight that's for god damn sure

Now that all is said and done
I'm burnin' bridges one by one
Ironically brought to an end at the hand of my one true friend
That sorry bastard never sleeps

Fleshengine breakdown
Fleshengine breakdown

Will I see the light and spot the error of my ways
Will I see the light and purify my poison veins
Will I see the light and spot the error of my ways
Will I see the light and do it all just one more time?
