I reflect the light, I'm that god damn noose so warm and tight
I'm buried in a gallery of failures
I'm the fluid in your veins
The black star in your blood red sky
And I'm stricken with a mouthful of poison

I am one with misery
Is someone out there 'cause this life is killing me

So I try to see the light
With my demons begging me to die
How can I trust the light?

Come take all this hate, come and burn it away
Be the one that I crave, redeemer, be the one that could save

I'm the bastard in your cries, the one who's always crucified
All alone, so self destructive
An appetite that won't subside
Tragedies that multiply
And still feeding that goddamn addiction

I am one with misery
Someone be there, life is killing me

How can I be bound to this pain
How can I be bound to this fate
God damn you!! God damn you all!!!

Come take all this hate, come and burn it away
Be the one that I crave, redeemer, be the one that could save.
