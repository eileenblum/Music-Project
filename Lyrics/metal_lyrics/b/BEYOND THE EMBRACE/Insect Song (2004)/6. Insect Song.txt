Can you taste it on your lips
The sweet mutation overflows
Ever wanting to be like them

Can you hear it in the air
The sound of progress and its whore
Infiltrating all we know
All we know...

The ants go marching one by one
To a grave as yet undug
A poison mind begets its host

Now he stands unbroken
The traveler sees his fate
And still he wants to be like them
...be like them

Waiting in line for the vaccination
Destination, annihilation
Foreclosure by the fever that brings
The truth behind the lyrics they sing

You're forced to be like them?!

Reencoding the DNA
A new species still unnamed
Distorted past gave birth to them

From here on out it's in our blood
And you know it won't be long
Before you hear the insect song!
...before you hear the insect song!

Waiting in line for the vaccination
Destination, annihilation
Foreclosure by the fever that brings
The truth behind the lyrics they sing.
