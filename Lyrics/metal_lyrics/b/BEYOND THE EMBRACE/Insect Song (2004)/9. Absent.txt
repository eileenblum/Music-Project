I breathe the absence of life, in a part of every breath I take
Inhaling afterthoughts of ruin...and regret
So no hope remains as I take another glass of pain
And I swallow knowing things will stay the same
I see that everything has gone so wrong for me
And I wait and see if I can welcome back the light
I'm following the suffering
And the ones that never heal
They're a part of me and I can't just leave them behind

So I cry these acid tears, as I weep for those like me
The ones whose apathy, ahderes them to this fate
So I lie awake and the bottle always calls my name
With an offering that I cannot refuse
Who will come to taste the quality of despair
It's so sweet that I enjoy it time and time again
is it charity that calls to me selling fragments of her soul
Is a part of me foolish enough to indulge

When the time comes let the blow come quickly and the blood run red
I worry not 'cause I'm already dead

So I'll not speak my last words
For I've already said enough
Their painted on the walls
So will you bleed for me
And together we will cross the sea
Two for the ferryman to take our souls across
I see that everything has gone so wrong for me
And I wait to see if I can welcome back the light
Following the suffering for the best parts of my life
Now your rid of me
But I'm not the only one.
