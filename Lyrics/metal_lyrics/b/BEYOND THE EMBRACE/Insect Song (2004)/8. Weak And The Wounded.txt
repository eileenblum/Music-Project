Closed eyes that walk among us, building castles in the air
Lost in degeneration, absence in all you know
Shed skin to hide reflection leaving no trail behind
Neck deep in contradiction
Forked tongue behind the smile

Making its way in the dark
About to decide which way to go
A life of disdain, a world left unchanged
Condemned to swim against the grain
The sun sets on existence, as one drowns in the flow
The bending sea forever circles around us all

We've built a culture where ignorance is bliss
Brought unto this world human inflicted

Why should we fall to the masses each day?
Why did we come this far to just turn back anyway?
We're auditioning for our own demise, and immune to the screaming

So tie me up alone, far from the system hold
I feel no patience, I see no cure
Evolved in reverse
Rise, fall...it's your choice

How did it all come to this???
I want to know why...
