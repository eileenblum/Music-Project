Have you ever stopped to think
About these moments in between
Concerned not with life
While existence stands at the edge of a knife
We eat the lies, then drink and dance to the insect song
No promise of a better day as empty words get washed away

Can't stop the bleeding in my head
Can't stop the pain
Can't stop this world that we've deranged
Can't stop the burning from within

Ever stopped to think
Our one guarantee in life is death
Man made end in sight
Bite down, go without regrets

Can't stop the bleeding in my head
Can't stop the pain
Can't stop this world that we've deranged
Can't stop the burning from within

In a final moment, when a restless tide begins to turn
The ones will realize that the final lesson...can't be learned

Ever stopped to think
About these moments in between
Could you only make for one more
What the fuck would it be???

Can't stop the bleeding in my head
Can't stop the pain
Can't stop this world that we've deranged!!!
