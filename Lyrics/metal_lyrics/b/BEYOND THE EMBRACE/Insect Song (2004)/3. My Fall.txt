So I travel on this road of emptiness another day
As I hold these dust cloud dreams an instant fore they're blown away
Could it be all this life's for is suffering?
'Cause the sea is deep and I'm drowning in all the tragedies

So I bleed maybe once or twice to rid the seeds from my veins
The seeds that harvest the pain, all the pain of my darkest days
And I've waited long enough for these things to change
So I'll have no regrets before I take the blade

As I lay down for the last time and leave all emotions behind
Thinking not of the ones I'm leaving
Just the hurt and the pain inside

Oh the wait is over, letting go tonight
The end of life is calling, echoing my fall from grace
But I fear what lies ahead as my heart stops beating
The change of life after death.
