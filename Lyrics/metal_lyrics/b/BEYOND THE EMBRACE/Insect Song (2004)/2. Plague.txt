Arise, arise and face the day head on, these shattered wings still trying to heal
So I slip into another skin, erasing forward progression, and stumbling 
across these boundaries again
Am I me or has he been dissolved?
Infected with the world's disease still singing to the insect song
So I endure at what a cost, put a price on my sanity, so hard to find body 
and mind, both of which consumed by slow decay

What I need is so elusive
Antidote for the incurable
Living in fear of what the future brings

Inject it into my life--the cure for this heartache
Inject it into my life--a moment of clarity
Inject it into my life--the reason to live one more day, 'cause my will is 
fading

Can you feel it?
As the day now turns to night, I can feel my wounds begin to mend
I must preserve my strength, 'cause with the dawn they come again

So I slip into another skin, erasing forward progression, and stumbling on 
these boundaries again
Am I me or has he been dissolved like the sun in my night, vicious circles 
burning up inside
Feel the pressure of falling apart

What I need is so elusive
Antidote for the incurable
Living in fear of what the future brings

Inject it into my life--the cure for this heartache
Inject it into my life--a moment of clarity
Inject it into my life--the reason to live one more day, 'cause my will is 
fading.
