A darkened soul captive of the spell 
Bloody seizures festering in pain 
Bombing angels the reign of blood 'til death 
Camoflauged in the stench of human misery 
Chanting the prayer of no return 
Called by a whisper soon shrouded in blood 
Obdurate feelings a black heart will thrive 
Fumigated in a war for one's lust 
Not just bathing, but weltering in blood 
Obeisance to the majesty of sin 
A forewarning of the ritual of blood 
Evolving from deliverance of the womb 
Chanting the prayer of no return 
Called by a whisper soon shrouded in blood 
Obdurate feelings a black heart will thrive 
Fumigated in a war for one's lust 
Changing of the tide Black moon will rise 
A loss of all control And weltering in blood 
Morbid fear of long forgotten panic 
Eroding into the eternity of sin 
Breaking the echo of silence like death 
A scripture of the blood written chapter 
Religious hate Death destruction 
Annihilation Weltering in blood
