Terminate, desecrate
Evolving from despair and desolation
Desires to desolate away from the xtian souls and desecrate
Expectations of annihilation followed through in full jet black
Indestructible the detonator lays this soul to desolate

Bleeding souls
From desolation
Weakened impurities
Are left to rot
