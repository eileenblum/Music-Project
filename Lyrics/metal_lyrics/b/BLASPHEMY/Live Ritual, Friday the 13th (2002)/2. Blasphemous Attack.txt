Chiming of the three bells call
Hear my cries for Satan I live in sin War I ride
Oh lord hear my bestial cries
Sacrificing of the lamb blood from the priest
Seven crowns of hell prevail

Hail now, black moon rise
Colding vengeance, devotion rise

Hailing to all evil desires
Pray now for destruction and hate
Satan now rising in fires Torment by all my hate
Hooded demons in black Chanting around the fires
Now the time has changed to light the candles

Hail now, black moon rise
Colding vengeance, devotion rise
