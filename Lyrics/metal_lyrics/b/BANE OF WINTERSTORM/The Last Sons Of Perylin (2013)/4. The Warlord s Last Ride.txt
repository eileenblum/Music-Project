[Aranon:]
âI now ride to victory In the Shadow of War,
Divine gods and angels; the tyrant will fall!
Iâll face my destiny; The Black Crown of Ohr,
Their legions of terror shall haunt us no more.

Hail.
Master of Night.

Across the great mountains our warriors ride,
For glory and honor, The kingdoms last cry.
Beneath the northern skies, Our swords in the wind,
One last ray will shine on our King!

I WILL CLAIM THE HELM OF THE ORDER,
RIDER OF DRAKIR,
LORD OF THE NIGHT,
I WILL STAND BEFORE THE LEGION,

HUNTER OF EVIL,

THE WARLORDâS LAST RIDE.

Nightfall and agony, The traitorâs return,
His gods blood within him, the whole world will burn.
The night is upon us, Our Kingdom still stands,
The rage of the Dragon will march through these lands.

The armies of the Shadowlands crawling like death,
The black wind will choke us and devour whatâs left.
The Black gate is open and they enter these lands.
I will have vengeance, he will fall by my hand,

I WILL CLAIM THE HELM OF THE ORDER,
RIDER OF DRAKIR,
LORD OF THE NIGHT,
I WILL STAND BEFORE THE LEGION,

HUNTER OF EVIL,

THE WARLORDS LAST RIDE.
