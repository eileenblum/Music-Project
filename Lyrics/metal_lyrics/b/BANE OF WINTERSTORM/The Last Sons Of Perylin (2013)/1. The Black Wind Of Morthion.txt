[Morthion:]
âI have come for your kingdom,
You will fall to your knees in agony
as your sons are crushed before youâ

[Aranon:]
âA war has come to claim our land,
From Ravenhall their legions came.
Take your blade, we will stand,
My brother; Haldir of the North.

[Haldir:]
âGrant power to me and your servant I will beâ

[Morthion:]
âThe great winds of Death shall devour these lands.
I will meet you again in the Netherealmsâ

[Aranon:]
âYou have betrayed me, my brother no moreâ

[Morthion:]
âI will drink from the chalice of gold as I sit upon your throne,
I shall feast upon your women âtil the end of time.â

[Aranon:]
âThe Darkness has come, and stripped these lands of light.

GODS OF WAR HEAR MY WORDS; I WILL RETURN.
AERION GRANT ME STRENGTH TO FACE HIS BLACK WIND.
THE BLACK WIND OF DEATH.

[Morthion:]
âForever have I awaited to invade these golden lands.
My wind shall blow stale and pestilent and bring only death.â

[Aranon:]
âThe dawn star lights my way across the land of death.

[Morthion:]
âIâll return beneath the silver moon and leave this land as ashâ

[Aranon:]
âI pledge myself to Ardor the mighty king of warâ

[Morthion:]
âYou shall feel Othorionâs might.

[Aranon:]
âAnd you shall feel my bladeâ

[Morthion:]
âForever in darkness;
shall these lands fear my name.

[Haldir:]
âI will kneel before you and serve your mighty will.
I will crush the golden army, Falanor shall burn.

[Morthion:]
âYou now serve the darkness,
A dark knight youâve becomeâ

[Haldir:]
âI feel your power inside Dark master of the night,
Lead me into battle for the Shadowlands.

[Morthion:]
âMy darkness has come, and stripped these lands of light.

[Aranon:]
GODS OF WAR HEAR MY WORDS; I WILL RETURN.
AERION GRANT ME STRENGTH TO FACE HIS BLACK WIND.
THE BLACK WIND OF DEATH.

[Lothriel:]
âSpirits of the lost,
Reaching out to me,
The Rivers of Aerith,
Will flow into the seaâ

[Mithren:]
âThe spirits of these lands,
Fading within meâ

[Mithren and Lothriel:]
âI will find the path
I will find my wayâ

[Aranon:]
âOver distant lands,
My journey calls to meâ

[Mithren and Lothriel:]
âI now leave this worldâ
âI will be set freeâ

[Morthion:]
âThe smoke of death chokes the sky,
The ashes of their kingdom will forever
meet the stale, pestilent windâ

[Aranon:]
âSo they came,
And burned our walls,
The Dark Knight crushed our force,
They took our crown,
And defiled the throne,
Perylin will never rise again.

[Haldir:]
âYou will join us now or forever youâll know deathâ

[Morthion:]
âYouâll burn beneath the soil. An eternity in the Netherealms,
Forever youâll know pain lest you heed your brothers wordsâ

[Haldir:]
âThis is your only chance, your blood is my rewardâ

[Morthion:]
âIn three months Iâll return with the force of one thousand suns,
Should Perylin still stand you will pay the priceâ

[Aranon:]
âThe Darkness has come, and stripped these lands of light.

GODS OF WAR HEAR MY WORDS; I WILL RETURN.
AERION GRANT ME STRENGTH TO FACE HIS BLACK WIND.
THE BLACK WIND OF DEATH.
