[Aranon:]
The icy north winds blow,
Announcing their return from the gate,
Beyond the realm of light.
My brother has come back,
Leading horse and man against these lands,
With eternal night.

Great winds blowing,
From the iron throne,
To end the fall of this world.

[Haldir:]
My brother waits for me,
His foolish pride splits our blood apart,
It shall be his end.
We claim these ruined walls,
Burn their holy crown with blackened flame,
And leave none alive.

Black winds blowing,
From the Shadowlands,
To watch the fall of their lands.

[Aranon:]
GREAT WAR HAS COME,

GODS HEAR OUR CALL,
WE WILL STAND FOR THE LIGHT OF OUR HOME,
SO WE MARCH ON AS ONE,
STAND PROUD AND STRONG,
FOR THE WILL OF THE LAST SONS OF LIGHT.

OF LIGHT.

[Haldir:]
His horse now rides to mine,
A final journey lost somewhere in time,
His final hour dawns,
I will spill his blood,
He will scream in agony,
As I force his hand to me.

War of Shadows,
Mighty rage of Lords,
You will fall Aranon.

[Aranon:]
Falanor will call our names,
The mighty sons of light forever more,
Our tales told in lore,
Haldir screams my name,
He will know the force of my blade,
One will stand and one will fall.

Dark Knights marching,
Against screaming wind,
To the great Northern lands

[Aranon:]
GREAT WAR HAS COME,

GODS HEAR OUR CALL,
WE WILL STAND FOR THE LIGHT OF OUR HOME,
SO WE MARCH ON AS ONE,
STAND PROUD AND STRONG,
FOR THE WILL OF THE LAST SONS OF LIGHT.

OF LIGHT.

[Morthion:]
âI am the dragon, my dominion now spreads through these lands like a plague.
I shall burn the hordes of knights before me,
Your blood will stain the soil of this kingdom,
And its name forgotten.

[Aranon:]
Heed my words,
You will feel the rage of my sword,
Bastard son of night.
Never shall we fall.
We will crush the order now,
And drive them from our home.

[Morthion:]
You will feel the flame,
Of a thousand hells,
Youâll beg for mercy,
As I crush your skulls.

[Haldir:]
âYou will never win.

[Aranon:]
âAs brothers we stand.

[Both:]
âReunited in battle!

[Morthion:]
âAnd bound in death eternal.

[Aranon:]
âNow the final bell will toll,
On our journey home.

[Haldir:]
âThe final ray of light is gone,
Now a new day dawns.

[Haldir:]
âThe Last Sons of Perylin,

[Aranon:]
âWarriors of steel,

[Both:]
âWe stood as one for our kingdom,
And died as the sons of light.
Thorin;
âAnd so the mighty Shadowking Morthion struck the final blow.
The last sons of Perylin perished at his cruel blade.
But one last ray of hope rode on beyond the walls of the fallen city;
The mighty king of war.â

[Ardor:]
âI will now ride through the gates of hell,
With the great knights of steel by my side.
You will fall to your knees before my blade,
And kneel to the iron throne.
You will now pay for your crimes Shadowlord,
As you hang from your neck in my halls.
Iâll crush the force of the dark order,
And bring light to these lands.

[Ardor:]
âI will claim your life,
Leave you to die upon the ground,
Your blood upon the soil.

Iâll avenge his death,
A fallen son of light Iâll cut you down,
The rage of eternal light.

Great winds blowing,
From the iron throne,
To end the War of Shadows.

[Morthion:]
âYou will not take me,
Iâll cast you to a sea of flames,
King of Northern lands.
I am the Dragon,
I hold your fate within my hands,
And I will watch you burn.

Stale wind blowing,
On to Ravenwind,
We will rise once again.

GREAT WAR HAS COME,

GODS HEAR OUR CALL,
WE WILL STAND FOR THE LIGHT OF OUR HOME,
SO WE MARCH ON AS ONE,
STAND PROUD AND STRONG,
FOR THE WILL OF THE LAST SONS OF LIGHT,

OF LIGHT
