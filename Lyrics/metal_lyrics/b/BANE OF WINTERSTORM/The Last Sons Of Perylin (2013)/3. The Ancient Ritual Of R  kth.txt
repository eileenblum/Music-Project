[Haldir:]
âMaster, Grant me power beyond this realm.
Eternal, The twisted forms of the damned call to me.

[Agathion:]
âServant; You will kneel before your lord.
Devour, The blood of the dragon now flows through your veins.

[Agathion:]
âAncient secrets unfurl before his crown,
A thousand have passed years since the ritual of death.

âAwaken, Born again into darkness and hate.
[Both:]
Immortal, The Reign of the Dragon will soon begin.â

[Haldir:]
âAncient power flows within my core.
A thousand years have passed since the ritual of death.
The Ancient rites of Rakth.

âDEMON OF STONE,

BORN OF NO LIGHT,
MYSTICAL FLAME,
WILL RAGE AGAIN.
HEAVEN WILL BURN,
PILLARS SHALL FALL
THE BLOOD OF THE LAST ANGELS

SHALL DROWN THIS WORLD.â

[Morthion:]
âFear me now,
Bearer of the Falconâs crest.
A forgotten prophecy,
Of primordial tongue;
Written in gods blood;
âThe rise of sins and shadow,
Endless fall of god and man
