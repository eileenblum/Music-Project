[Aranon:]
âFind the ancient ring,
The damned souls shall speak once more,
Guide me to his cell,
Free him from their blackened flame.

[Agathion:]
âMithren is now mine,
Bound in chains of forgotten tongue.
Force his hand to me,
He shall kneel before the throne.

[Authion:]
âI will taste his ancient power,
Drink the blood of kings,
So it begins.

[Aranon:]
âFROM NORTHERN ICE LANDS
THROUGH ANCIENT TREES
THE RAGE OF THE KINGS WITHIN ME.
OVER GREAT MOUNTAINS
AND THE BLACK SEA
THE EMERALD STONE IS SET FREEâ

[Morthion:]
âBring forth the wretched souls,
The twisted forms of the damned.
Bound in chains of forgotten tongue,
Beneath my power forever more.

[Authion:]
âSeeker;
You will die now, as the last of your name,
I am the eternal.
You will become a part of me.

[Aranon:]
âI see him unleash his unholy light,
A stone now of four.
Drinking from eternal life,
This world now will fall.

âHis force within, A thousand years of life.
My curse forever binds, The stone leads me on.

[Authion:]
âDevour flesh and blood,
His ancient soul inside of mine,
His power flows through me,
A seekers mind within my own.

[Aranon:]
âHear his final rhyme,
Cast within an ancient stone,
Death now calls to me,
Iron walls will guide me home,
âI will cast my vengeance on thee,
Crush your distant lands.
Gods heed my words.

FROM NORTHERN ICE LANDS
THROUGH ANCIENT TREES
THE RAGE OF THE KINGS WITHIN ME
OVER GREAT MOUNTAINS
AND THE BLACK SEA
THE EMERALD STONE IS SET FREE
IS SET FREE
