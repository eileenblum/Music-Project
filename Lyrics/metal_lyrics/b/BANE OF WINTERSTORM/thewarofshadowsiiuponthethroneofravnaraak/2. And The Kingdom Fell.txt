[Erudan:]
I witnessed the fall of a kingdom,
Cloth of SVLFYR arise,
I have seen six thousand men torn apart.
Dark Horde will claim us all.

Grip the dagger, Lord of Xythos

[Arthos:]
The seekers stone hidden deep within the Earth,
The wolves have come for you

[Both:]
Walls of Taeltharn slowly burning,
Searching for the holy shattered stone.

[Morthion:]
Sound the horn and step through the arc

[Erudan:]
We have come for the star.

[Morthion:]
Pray at the fallen altar in ruin and break the final seal

Throat of Winter bathed in shadow,
Cross the frozen fields of Hathir,
Lo! Your wolves have come.

[Erudan:]
War of shadows,
Alas darkness has come
Seeking the stone,
Ancient spell now undone,
So all will fall
'Neath the wrath of thrones
The last seal still stands

[Morthion:]
Sacrificed upon the slab of Urth,
Bound forever to the key,
Life ripped from within the wizards throat.
Let thy blood fill your mouth
Devour.

[Erudan:]
His power still grows

[Erudan:]
War of shadows,
Alas darkness has come
Seeking the stone,
Ancient spell now undone,
So all will fall
'Neath the wrath of thrones
The last seal still stands
Claim orath's star
Ascend from hell.
