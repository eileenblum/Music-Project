[Erudan:]
Lord of Svlfyr,
Bearing the stone of Orath's Star,
Hidden deep within.
Injecting venom on the blade,
Beneath the sister moons shall I feast upon your death.

[Morthion:]
Crawl forth now son of Ethoras,
The brittle bones of death now coil at my touch,
Your wolves will all fall before me.
And you will mark their pyre,
Consumed within the flame.

[Erudan:]
Drown within the light.
Ash and dust upon the throne.
Ghosts of the Earth
Beckon for your crown.

Kingdom of fate,
Lies beyond the Fjorid's gate,
Bound forever you will be.
Within my hands,
Forget not the blood of man,
Soon, Morthion, you will bleed.

[Morthion:]
Spewed forth from wretched hives

[Erudan:]
This is where all come to die!

[Morthion:]
I cast thee into boundless nothing

[Arthos:]
This Labyrinth is now your tomb!

[Erudan:]
You fool it will be here soon

[Morthion:]
Turning wolves bones into dust

You will never leave this place!

All hope is gone.

[Morthion:]
Inhale the putrid rotting soil of your faith

[Arthos:]
Buried beneath the ancient frozen lakes

[Erudan:]
Bring down the stone,
Seal your fucking fate.

[Morthion:]
Collapse, and enslave us all

[Erudan:]
I will see you die.

War of shadows,
Alas darkness has come

[Erudan:]
Step inside the circle; within five points of truth.
Within stone you shall be for all time.

[Morthion:]
Pour salt into thy open wounds

[Erudan:]
Bound now in stone, the seekers star shall bind,
And so you choke until the end of time

[Morthion:]
Feast on silence until I return
