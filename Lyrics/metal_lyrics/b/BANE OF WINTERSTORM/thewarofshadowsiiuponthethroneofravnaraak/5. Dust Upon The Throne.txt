[Erudan:]
Rise from the gaping maw of death,
As the dark horns herald the end.
The cruel hands of fate now beckon a blackened sun.

[Morthion:]
Foul Swarth! You will kneel to ruination,
Beg for passage through the gate.
From your bones shall I tear your skin,
Mortal coil within my mouth.

[Erudan:]
Defiler, The true kingdom fell,
In the shadow aflame.
Spilling blood across the snow,
One throne shall rule the north.

[Morthion:]
Enshrine your sun and succumb to Levitation,
I will cave in the North.
Your weak heavens would tremble 'neath my weight,
Cast aside like flies.

[Erudan:]
Feeling no light on the Earth,
O, behold a pale winter hath come to bring our end.

[Authion:]
Silent, I dirge through the night,
In my reach at last,
So the third stone sings her words to me,

Winter has come,
Veiling our kingdom,
Gods now are gone,
Their hands will guide me
Down into death,
Taken by his pale black wind,
Breathe in the air of the fate of us all

From atop the peak I cry;
Wretched servant of death,
Fall beneath my feet,
Left to die upon the earth.

[Erudan:]
Ruins of this kingdom,
Were forgotten long ago.
Now his power taken from him,
In his shadow we stand tall.
Hear the wolves call; beckon for me,
Strike the hammer to save us all.

Hear the mooncarver's chant.
Long pale fingers reach for my neck.
Grip the frail link and chain.
Enslaved now within his hand.

[Arthos:]
The North will rise and claim the Devourer's helm.
No longer free of death.

[Morthion:]
Now you die in the shadow of the mountain.

[Erudan:]
Claim thy vengeance and kill the fucking beast.
Winter has come,
Veiling our kingdom,
Gods now are gone,
Their hands will guide me
Down into death,
Taken by his pale black wind,
Breathe in the air and the fate of us all
Winter has come
In the shadow of the fall
