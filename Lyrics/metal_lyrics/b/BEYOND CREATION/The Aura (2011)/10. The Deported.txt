Standing all alone in a deserted place, I wondered where the clouds were
As wind became stronger, I closed my eyes to what was coming there

Pushed and Tossed by an invisible force
Pitch black all around us

Something was falling from the sky

[Solo: Kevin/ Simon]

Crystal eyed flakes were floundering around
I don't know what they want, but I fear what they might find. In this world of misery
Crystal eyed flakes were floundering around
It is time to act in another direction, In this world of misery

[Solo: Simon]

Are we the chosen ones?
If so, did we respect life itself?
Are we the chosen ones?
Weâll be deported to another world, where creatures like us are toys for them.

Standing in a humid place, where sorrows will surround us
My mates are crying their souls, cursing their brains.
Pushed and Tossed by visible corpses
A bright light is all around us.
