[Solo: Kevin]

Worthless for some and prominent for those
Memories are now the only chance to progress
Surrounded one foot in the abattoir
Another bastard will govern us
Giving the script for the next game

Regression of existence will start

Fought to be the one
The one who showed from human misery
Pieces of reality
When lifetime seems to decelerate
And extinction appears to them, In the gray sky
To be the ultimate fee!!!!!!!

A vision for liberty will take us to divinity
Leaving them in a painful sentence

From chaos to their last breath
Injustice will be revealed!
