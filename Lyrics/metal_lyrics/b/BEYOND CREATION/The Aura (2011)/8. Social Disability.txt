Is it the end, or is it just me?
Will it happen that weâll be set free?
Chaos is near: the fear of all fears

Shall we continue to hope when faith starts to bleed?

When truth isnât told and still controls a foldâ¦I feel blind
Iâm questioning myself but I canât findâ¦

I try to dream but sleep took off.
I felt not sure and went for a walk.

It is the end and we are not to blame.
Weâll feel free at last and the game will end
This game will endâ¦

I feel like Iâve been told lies from the day I was born
Enacting a story that is not mine, is it enough of a burden?

I try to climb between the doubts that are surrounding my mind
I don't feel free and guess what; I donât feel that Iâm being me.
