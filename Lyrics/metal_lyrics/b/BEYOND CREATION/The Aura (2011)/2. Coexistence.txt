When the universal darkness is covering the earth, and hold us tight
Some spying eyes are drawn to the sky stuck upon it,

Filled with interrogations
They are questioning about life:
What is the reason for our presence here?
And what can we do to prevent human mistakes?

When the first minute of the day arrives with this total silence
Some light crystal beams are penetrating the room
Delivering this darkness that doesn't show me
In which world of trouble we are living

Pressure, slaughtery, crime and monetary shitâ¦

My eyes are opening to a totally different world!!
A cepage of flesh that awaits to be hacked up

Feeding your deadliest thoughts
Human of century
No more can I accept these lies

They are all standing there, without anyone talking and no reason to be heard.
But life is so important! This life is yours
When someone chooses to take or give life
Many lives are resting on their shoulders

[Solo: Kevin]

It's a choice to make, the way of life you'll take
So I wish you to take the good path!

If society can't accept itself, how could it deal with each individuality
This nightmare must be overcome
This truth is for us!!
It's a scar that cannot be healed but it could be known
At this point, coexistence could be a scheme.
