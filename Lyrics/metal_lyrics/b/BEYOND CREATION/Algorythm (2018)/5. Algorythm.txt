Tic Toc we heard the clock regain
The pendulum has finally moved again
Inactive for so long
Dreams were confined to a generic delusion
Sinking into obsolescence
There was nothing left to inspire our subsistence

As the Algorithm transcended
We can now redefine our progression
Embracing the uncharted
Abstracting the relics into oblivion

Everlasting minds
Please liberate the hidden light
And shine upon us
As we reinvent our contrivance
And fix this miscalculation

As the Algorithm transcended
We can now redefine our progression
Embracing the uncharted
Abstracting the relics into oblivion

Gradually reconstructing our future
Weâll seek for new elements
To ascend the enigma of life
And unify our existence through earth and universe
