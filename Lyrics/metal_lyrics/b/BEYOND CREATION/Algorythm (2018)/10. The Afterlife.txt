The symbiosis of genetic molecules that transcends
Revealing memories of a previous life
I'm questioning myself about the secrets of an unknown theory
Towards a temporal spiritual displacement

[Solo: Simon]

Genetically modified organism
Brought to life by our own creations
Is a connection by science into time

Guided by the fear of extinction
To achieve an improbable prophecy
We are ready to sacrifice anything
In search of a place of survival for the human race

[Solo: Simon]

Biodiversity leads me to believe in an afterlife
That will eternally renew

[Solo: Hugo / Kevin / Simon]

As human to our change
Through time we'll remain
