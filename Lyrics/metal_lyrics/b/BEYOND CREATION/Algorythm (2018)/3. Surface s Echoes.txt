Made from the most highly complex matter
We've grown through time
Colliding progress with creation
Pushing boundaries of minds and physics

Impacting on each other's life
On each other's destiny
We all imply our own ideology
Leaving behind us the aura of a man who once lived

Every decision we take
Every step we make
Every word we use and every rule we choose

Impacting on each other's life
On each other's destiny
We all imply our own ideology
Leaving behind us the aura of a man who once lived

[Solo: Kevin]

All our actions are impacting multiple dimensions
Which makes everyone unique

Even when our world explodes from the inside
We dream to believe
We work to achieve
We are the braves that stand and behave
Conquering our fears
Triumphing over tears
Overcome the obstacles and perceive our future

Perseverance is the key
Once you reach the summit you'll finally hear
Surface's echoes
