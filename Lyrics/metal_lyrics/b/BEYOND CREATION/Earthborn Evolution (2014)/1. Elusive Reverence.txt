We, the world, exhausted souls, slaves from those paths
We've grown to become reflections of our souls
Physionomical creations

Philosophical imitations, we learn, we trust but we'll never know, we'll never really know

Man behaves, in ecliptic situations
Forgetting this mind's progression we all worked for

Philosophical imitations, we learn, we trust but we'll never know, we'll never really know

Human decline, universe phenomena
Protection of his own is pure evidence of inequality

[Solo: Kevin]

Face yourself, regarding this above criticalism perspective
These energizim vibrations are powerful evolutions of itselfâ¦.pure power
Involving with this emerging perseverance, you've created an objective realization of your mind.
