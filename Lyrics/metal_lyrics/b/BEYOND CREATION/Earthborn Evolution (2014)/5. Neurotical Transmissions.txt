From those regenerated particles, anatomic molecules absorb this shell shock you've felt

Foreseen ending, affliction of elusive perspective is just an illusion built from fear and emotional momentum
Fragmental pieces of timeline are now operating your mental consciousness

From those regenerated particles, anatomic molecules absorb this shell shock you've felt
Foreseen ending, affliction of elusive perspective

Fight to waive life's collapse, you choose direction to oppose chaos creation

[Solo: Simon / Kevin]

Brain's connections, in transportation through heart perseverance solutions appear to be recognition in self re-establishment

Resumption of a new breath, a new life.
