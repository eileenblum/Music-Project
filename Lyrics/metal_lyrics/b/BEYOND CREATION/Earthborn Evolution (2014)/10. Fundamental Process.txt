Quantum hypothesis leading those mystical superpositions to man's contemplation.
We afford deviation and elevate ourselves for science and progress
Unresolved quests,
Wisdom is waiting amongst us for conceptual diagrams to be revealed

As concrete designs, we push harder, search deeper and fear of never to find an answer

Quantum hypothesis leading those mystical superpositions to man's contemplation.
We afford deviation and elevate ourselves for science and progress
This is the endless vortex called "life"

[Solo: Kevin / Simon]

Man has infused for centuries it's chronicle invasions with monuments
Advocating divinity and immortality for the ancients
Spectral forces will remain from the dead and lost souls

As concrete designs, we push harder, search deeper and fear of never to find an answer

But as far as weâre alive, we're all part of this experimentation for discovery
Searching the cure and key to the unknown
Waiting for this frightening light to scan all forethoughts
The weakness is about to emerge

You may be the one chosen to disavow the inhuman non-presenceâ¦
