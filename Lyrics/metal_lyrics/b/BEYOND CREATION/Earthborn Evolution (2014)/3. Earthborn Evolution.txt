Earthborn evolution has shocked equilibrium of biological species
As we create, we confine ourselves to mechanical torture
Deeper than imagination, mankind has drowned in a profound comatum
That will separate us from spiritual connectors

[Solo: Kevin]

By avoiding gravity that trapped us in atrocity
We'll find our way through the elevation path.

[Solo: Simon / Dominic]
