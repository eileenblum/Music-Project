Primitive expansion, lead by repulsion and obsession
Where the almighty comprehension is hidden by abstraction, secrecy and illusion
Trading life and existence, we're born and die running trough time
Hypnotized by synthetic realms, desires and addictions
They told us we are a freedom society, but are we psychologically free?

Taking souls to absolutions and expulsing all judgments from logical solutions
Human has grown and served, controlled by the heart, directed by brain
Filling all these years within momentum spheres,
Perspectives have been floating in
For which cause we fought, at which price we won?
