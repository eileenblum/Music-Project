To the legion of man,
Your story draws to an end.

Witness

Collapse of society, in a state of tribal warfare
Astronomical destruction  nothing in sight

Degradation of order, anarchy alive
Once again begin the cyclic ending of human life

Follow me through destiny

Witness humanity's collision with the blades of fate

Crushing of the weakened soul, in a state of constant battle
Disintegration of the mind, nothing is real

Degradation of order, anarchy alive
Once again begin the cyclic ending of every life

Follow me through destiny

Witness depravity, Dominion of mankind erased

Kneel before me as I
Rebuild this world in my image

For too long you've defied
And now you suffer eternally

Upon the precipice of restoration
Upon the dawn of Armageddon
While you are gasping for air I will say
To the legion of man,
Your story draws to an end.

Witness humanity's collision with the blades of fate
Witness depravity. Dominion of mankind erased
