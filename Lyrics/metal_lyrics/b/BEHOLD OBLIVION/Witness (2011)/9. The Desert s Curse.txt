In the distance, across this lifeless expanse
Buried deep beneath the sands
For centuries asleep, until the final call
To bring death to their lands

Hear the cries of the damned beckoning your demise
Feel the warmth of the sun against your dying skin

The silence of the sands is deafening.
I hold your life in my hands
Feel the desert's caress
The desert's curse

In this, your darkest hour
In the moment before ascent
I am here by your side
Trust in me to extinguish your life
As swiftly as I have arrived

The silence of the sands is deafening.
I hold your life in my hands
Feel the desert's caress
The desert's curse

No corner of earth too far,
No ocean floor too deep,
No desert too vast,
To keep you from me.

Deserted amongst the ghosts
Of the ones devoured before you
Alone in desolation
With only the shifting sands to keep you company
Alone in desolation

The twisted crown adorning
A Visage most unholy
Time will only last you so long
Hope will only take you so far

You will become the dust in my wake
You will become the focus of my hate
You will become the dust in my wake
I will become the seal upon your fate.
