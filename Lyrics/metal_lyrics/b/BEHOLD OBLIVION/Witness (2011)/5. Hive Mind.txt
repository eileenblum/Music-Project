Growing in the darkness, festering beneath the skin
Forming the first cells of corruption
Multiplying infestation reaches the apex of decay
The onset of neural mutilation

I am the voice inside
Relinquish all control
It flows through your mind
My will takes hold

The eyes roll back, possession is complete
You become the spectator inside
Your limbs no longer obey, your words are not your own,
And the urge to struggle will slowly subside

I am the voice inside
Relinquish all control
It flows through your mind
My will takes hold

Divination awaits you
Disconnecting from time
Realize your purpose
Become one with the hive

I am the collective consciousness
The billions without form
You are the manifestation of my desires
The bio-weaponized swarm.

If your flesh should fail, that flesh will be made anew.
That is my covenant with the eternal brood

Without number
(Heart of the swarm)
With no end in sight
(Living ocean of chaos)
Flowing sea of flesh
(Become my will)
The accursed blight
(Purification of life)

I am the collective consciousness
The billions without form
You are the manifestation of my desires
The bio-weaponized swarm.
