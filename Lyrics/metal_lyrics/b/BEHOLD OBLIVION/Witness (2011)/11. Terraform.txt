Arrival of the end
(Collapsing atmosphere)
The failure of a race, driven towards extinction.

Forced into the void
(The exodus of mankind)
We looked into the cold unforgiving.

We extend our reach
(To distant stars)
In hope of survival
In hope of a new homeworld

Death came without warning, the burning of our system.
Unforeseen epoch of fire, celestial cycle complete.
The massive cannibalistic devouring of our sun
Rebuild.

Beyond the edge of perception, we came upon a new star
Here, in an unfamiliar world, will begin the next era of man

From nothing, We will create life
From nothing, Forge the air of existence
From nothing, We will escape
To self-determination

Forced into the void
(The exodus of mankind)
We looked into the cold unforgiving.

We extend our reach
(To distant stars)
In hope of survival
In hope of a new homeworld

In order for us to survive, we must rebuild
A world without pride
In order for us to survive, we must rebuild
With only perfection in mind

Or face our demise.
(Behold the new era of man. Survival in defiance of fate)
Demise
(Rebuild in knowledge, or we will face the true end)

Witness the end of all
We'll witness the end of all.

I have borne witness. I have seen the way.

Follow me through destiny.
