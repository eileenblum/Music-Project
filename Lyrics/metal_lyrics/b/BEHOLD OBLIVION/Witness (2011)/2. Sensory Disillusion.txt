My children, be still in ignorance.

Keep your eyes forward, leave my ways unquestioned.
Stay asleep, believe in the illusion.
Find your satisfaction in the insignificant,
And never hesitate to ask why.

Idolize the weak
Worship the vain
Value the worthless
Enthralled by disgrace

Awakened
Sensory Disillusion

I have enslaved you to preoccupation,
Bound by your own sensory shackles.
You have found peace in self-destruction,
And have never once sought escape.

My children, be still and know...

I have journeyed through the darkness

Between the most distant stars
The eternal witness

I have beheld the birth of suns
And the entropy of entire realities
The eternal witness

Yet in my knowledge, I have yet to see
A species so blind,
Begging to be freed.

All that you've built here is nothing but a fading dream.
A dream from which you will awake,
Drowned, in a greater nightmare.

You have made an enemy of time
(His hourglass empties. His grip, it tightens)
And in a blink of his eye, your people will fade
(A memory better kept forgotten)

Idolize the weak
Worship the vain
Value the worthless
Enthralled by disgrace.
