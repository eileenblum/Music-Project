What have you come here trying to find?
What is that you are looking for?
Within this realm of unconscious thought
What you seek is nothing but a fleeting lie

How times have you tried to dig
Into the furthest reaches of your dreams
Only to awake
To a place where all you long for is sleep

Oh but the sweet release never comes
For you are already beneath
Looking up through the surface of reality

Upon the shores of the dreaming mind
Lies the edge of all manifestation

What have you come here trying to find?
What is that you are looking for?
Within this realm of unconscious thought
What you seek is nothing but a fleeting lie

Why have you done this?
Everything that I lived for is gone
Now come and join me
we will lie forever in sleep

Why have you done this?
Everything is gone.

You will be locked beneath
I am the warden of your mind
And there is no escape

Here you must now wait
The sentencing has just begun
Behold your fate
From this you will never wake.

Why have you done this?
Everything is gone.
