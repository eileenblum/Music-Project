The death of a sun
Imploding mass of cosmic energy
A system devoid of light
The macropyre to end all life

The planetary gears of my design begin to turn

Celestial plan put in place
Their fates woven at the dawn of time

The infinite being
Empyrean hunger for life
The mortal misunderstanding
Galactic culling for all of time

Written in the stars, the story of my conquest
Astral forces bend the fabric of time
As the feeble ones reach out into the dark
My hand will guide them to their final place

The planetary gears of my design begin to turn

Countless lifeforms assimilated to feed my insatiable lust
With each genocide my power grows
The memory of your race is forever lost

One by one you will soon become
Part of me, undone to the chains of time.
