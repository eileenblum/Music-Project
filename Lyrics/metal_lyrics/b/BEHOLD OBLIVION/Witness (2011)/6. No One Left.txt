Veiled in the guise of justice,
You claim yours is the voice of the weak.

But how clearly your intentions are revealed,
As viciousness glazes over your eyes.

Serpent tongue hidden behind a crooked smile;
Grotesque mouth disgorging lies.

They are not the victims playing your force-fed role.
Armed with stones to throw, scapegoats to blame,
Never able to reap what they sow.
You give them strength in hatred,
Synthesize destruction.
Sitting on your throne built on broken backs
Now our calloused hands reach for your throat.

Veiled in the guise of justice,
You claim yours is the voice of the weak.

May you choke on your own deceit
When finally the people see,
The enemies you fabricate
Are mere puppets upon your strings;
Dancing to your ever-twisted song.
And when the curtain falls,
They all have lost their way.

Veiled in the guise of justice

As they watch this illusionary show
Your selfish hands reach into our purse unknown.

But how clearly your intentions have been revealed.
And now your viciousness will destroy you from within.
