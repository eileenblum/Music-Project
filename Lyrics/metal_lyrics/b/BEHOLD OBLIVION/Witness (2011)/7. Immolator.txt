I am the hatred for your fellow man
The embodiment of greed and pride
I am your burning malevolence
Unending disdain for your own kind
I am the hidden one disguised in fear
The guilt that engulfs your mind

Immolator
The catalyst of war
History written by hand
(I will always be)

Immolator
The harbinger abhorred
Destiny destroyed by my hand
(You will bow at my feet)

I have dwelled within your soul
Four countless centuries untold
The searing agony awaits
Your flesh will scorch

Your flesh will scorch, bathed in fire.
Death will be your sweet release.
Still you remain blind to truth.
You are a pawn, the casualty of your people's doom.

Immolator
The catalyst of war
History written by hand
(I will always be)

Immolator
The harbinger abhorred
Destiny destroyed by my hand
(You will bow at my feet).
