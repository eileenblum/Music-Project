From the frozen dream awake, from the grayscale sleep arise.
Your vision blurring, painstaking sight.
Now as the first tendrils of sunlight are drawn across the sky
Your gaze turns inward, Your thoughts become clear

To see with the eyes within
Is to see for the first time.
The parallax of thought, abstract sight,
Soul control of the mind.

Know my child that the infinite cannot be held
Your true center will remain unseen.
Release control, transformation begins.
Giving of the soul unto the darkness within.

See dimensions of existence, inconceivable.
See the embodiment of malevolence
Know that omniscience is within your grasp
Know, Your power overwhelming

To see with the eyes within
Is to see for the first time.
The parallax of thought, abstract sight,
Soul control of the mind.

Tear apart the shell of flesh
Expose the eternal essence
Open the gateway to your inner thoughts
And gain complete control

Open your eyes to the invisible spectrum
Synthetic perception.
