(Death)
Your whole life is leading up to this
No place to hide
There's no escaping this
Go bury yourself into your Holy Book
Admiring a God for which you desperately seek

What the hell have we done to deserve this?!
Living with a fear of not knowing what happens next.
I don't want your apostle. I've had enough of the martyr.
Its either die or pay the fine.

In God we trust.
Fuck that and fuck you.
You stand there with pointed fingers.
Preaching for me to be open to your fake beliefs.
Don't you realize that life isn't based on 'make believe'

I know you try to play God, if that's the case, I will be your devil.

I don't want your apostle.
I've had enough of the martyr.
Its either die or pay the fine.
I don't want your approval.
I don't want to be saved.
And this judgement is the crime.

In the name of the Father, the son, and Holy Spirit.
In the world of 'organized religion'... Your God is dead!!
