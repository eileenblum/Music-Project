What is the fucking point in all of this?
All I ever have are questions with no goddamn answers.

Its boring to live, sad to laugh, and difficult to love.

Disappointment has always been there for me.
I have never held my breath for something good to come around.
Let's just face it.. it doesn't matter how hard I try.

Its never gonna end up the way I pictured it.

Now you ask me..
What was my fucking point in all of this?

I am just sick of it all.
Goddamn me.
For everything dies.

All that we know, all that we see, all of those we love, all of its gone.
