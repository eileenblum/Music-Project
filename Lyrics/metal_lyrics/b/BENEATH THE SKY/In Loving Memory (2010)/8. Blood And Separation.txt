Why must I keep everything on the inside?
It leaves me nothing but a paralyzed heart.
I don't know where to begin and
I don't if there ever will be an end?
I just wish to break free.
I want to break free.

From long nights of trying to be strong.
Hoping that you'd be dead by dawn.
Blinded by false emotions.
True feelings will they ever show?!

So I close my eyes and
Finally understand you've been poison all along.
So now I've got to leave you broken in the dust.
'Cause you're nothing that I want,
and nothing that I need.

Breathe in these lifeless days.
Hatred is nothing but a memory.
What is it that I feel today?
Isn't it beautiful,
I never thought that love would leave these scars.

Just fuck off and die slow...

Why must you try to tempt me?
Would it be more easier for you
To see my name carved into stone?

Never again.
