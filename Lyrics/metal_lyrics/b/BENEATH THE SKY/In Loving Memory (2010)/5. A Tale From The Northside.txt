Once upon a time down in Northside
I was being held at gunpoint
By a couple of young low lives
Feeling like they were some badass street soldiers.
As they pointed their weapon at me and my friends.

They told us to give them the cash.
Or kiss our asses goodbye with just one gun blast.
I have never in my life been so terrified.
I have never felt this alive.

What was their motive?
What was their need?
To be willing to take a life for the fuckin' green.
Feeling like they were some badass street soldiers.
As they pointed their weapon at me and my friends.

They told us to give them the cash.
Or kiss our asses goodbye with just one gun blast.
I have never in my life been so terrified.
I have never felt this alive.

Staring down the barrel of a gun
My life could of been done.

What was their motive?
What was their need?
To be willing to take a life for the fuckin' green.
Never did I think this could happen to me.
To be a dead motherfucker in the 5-1-3!!!
