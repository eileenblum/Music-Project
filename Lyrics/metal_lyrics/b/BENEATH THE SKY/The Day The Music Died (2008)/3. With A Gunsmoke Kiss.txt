Heartbreak feels like a one way road
Wheres the pain lies in one direction
For I have nowhere to turn to

Count the days of those several sleepless nights
Worrying all about what you're doing
Are you doing better than me?

It hurts for me to hurt you, girl (it hurts to bite my tongue) [2x]

Her name sends out a message
"Don't fall for it"
Don't feel for her,
She has no one to turn to

Count the days of those several restful nights
Not worrying all about who you're doing
You will never be better than me

(I can no longer bite my tongue)

It hurts for me to hurt you, girl (it hurts to bite my tongue) [2x]

It puts a smile on my face
Knowing that your memory is six feet in the dirt
I did this out of love, never out of hatred
Oh why and how did you ever get the best of me?
Satisfied on know that the last thing you tasted was our gunsmoke kiss

You taste better dead than when you were alive [2x]
