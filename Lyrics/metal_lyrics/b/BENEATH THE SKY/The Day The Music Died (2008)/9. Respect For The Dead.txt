They're coming to get you Barbara!!!
Como esta, Bitches!!!
We're here to spread disease,
Get you in our grasp,
And fuck your shit up.

Run,run,run, as fast as you can.
Do not look back,
They march in numbers,
As they hunger for the living.
Through these lifeless eyes,
You're just another dead fuck.

Through these lifeless eyes,
You're just another dead fuck.

The hour of judgment is upon you.
I am the one that kills.
No motives, just for pleasure
No remorse from this motherfucker.

Run,run,run, as fast as you can.
Do not look back,
They march in numbers,
As they hunger for the living.
Through these lifeless eyes,
You're just another dead fuck.

Through these lifeless eyes,
You're just another dead fuck.

When these is no more room in hell,
The dead will walk the Earth

Another Day
I can't be without you,
Though I'm learning that I have to,
And it hurts my heart.
I stare at our picture.
There's no warmth in this frame.
I missed your call another day,

And though the years will pass you so quickly
(I hope you know) that I'll be here
If ever you need me, but...
It's all my fault for bringing on this pain
I locked my vaults and threw away the keys
So kill it out of me, so quickly I need you to know
I didn't plan for this and while you grow
I want to be there for it
Please promise me I'll get the chance another day.
Well I've been without you,
And each night it keeps me up wide awake,
A different place I'm only doing what I know how to do.
To best provide for you.
Though I can't spend my time with you
