Here we are again.
Time to make changes and you know damn well...
Why we did what we did.
Quit acting like you're the fucking victim.
When you played a better role of being the coward.

You keep telling yourself we did you wrong.
Motherfucker.
You need to learn to accept your mistakes.
You are not as perfect as you think you are.

Why must you think it's the other way around?
Doesn't make any sense when most of us
Are still in this together.

Some option suited you more.

But lets face it...
You did this to yourself!

You keep telling yourself we did you wrong.
Motherfucker.
You need to learn to accept your mistakes.
You are not as perfect as you think you are.

Why must you think it's the other way around?
Doesn't make any sense when most of us
Are still in this together.

You thought we'd never make it out alive,
Guess what?
We are still breathing...

You said we stabbed you in the back,
True friends stab you in the front...
