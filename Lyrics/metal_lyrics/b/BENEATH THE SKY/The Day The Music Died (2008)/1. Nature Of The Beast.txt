I just want to break the chains
That keep you held down
I believe in you, do you believe in me?
I know that you never meant any harm.

No matter what you do,
I'll always be on your side.
Divide this wall that keeps us apart.
With all the things you have ever said.
For all the words you have ever written.
With all the things you have ever done.
For all of those who never cared.

Is this really worth it?
To be what you want me to be.
All this will start a war.
Destroy this wall that keeps us apart.
I know that you are better than that.
I know that you are better than this...

Drown yourself inside the waterfall,
Suffocated by the sun.
They know what they do...
Forgive them!
