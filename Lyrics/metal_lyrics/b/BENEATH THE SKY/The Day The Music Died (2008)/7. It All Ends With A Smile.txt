Let's watch it burn! [x4]

Why must you feel the need to question anything and everything?
I will tell you not to have the answers and so I'd rather keep my mouth shut.

Fuck you!
I've had enough of this.
No one to blame but myself.

Liars. Hypocrites. Cowards. Bastards.

Why must you destroy everything that's fucking good? I accept the face that my murderer will come with the sound.
The sound (the sound) is in this.
Cut through so deep.

Why must you feel the need to judge everything and everyone?
Why do you think you're so different? I can always smell shit a mile away.

Just because you come to Jesus doesn't mean inebriation.

Liars. Hypocrites. Cowards. Bastards.

I no longer pride myself on the everyday world.
Sometimes I feel damn good just to watch the world fucking burn.

The sound (the sound) is in this.
Cut through so deep.(so deep)
The world (the world) is hurting.
Our hearts go to sleep. (to sleep)

The voice it speaks to me. (speaks to me)
It whispers inside of me. (whispers)
The voice says come to me. (come to me)
Falling so long. (so long)

Some to break the sound
The sound (the sound) is in this
Cut through so deep (so deep)
The world (the world) is hurting (is hurting)
Our hearts go to sleep (go to sleep)
