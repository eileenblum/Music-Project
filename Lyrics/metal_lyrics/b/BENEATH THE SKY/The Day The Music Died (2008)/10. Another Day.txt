I can't be without you, though I'm learning that i have to, and it hurts my heart.
I stare at a picture, there's no warmth in this frame, and it's still called another day.

And though the years, will pass you so quickly (i hope you know)
I'll be here if ever you may need me.
But it's all my fault for bringing on this pain.
I locked my vaults and threw away the keys
So dwell it out of me so quickly
I need you to know i didn't plan for this.
And while you grow i wanna be there for it.
Please promise I'll get that chance another day

Well I've been without you each night, it keeps me up wide awake, a different place.
I'm only doing what i know how to do.
To best provide for you.
Though i can't spend my time with you.

And though the years, will pass you so quickly (i hope you know)
I'll be here if ever you may need me.
But it's all my fault for bringing on this pain.
I locked my vaults and threw away the keys
So kill it out of me so quickly
I need you to know i didn't plan for this.
And while you grow, i wanna see all of it.
Please promise me I'll get the chance another day.

Its all my fault for bringing on this pain.
I locked my vaults and threw away the keys
I need you to know i didn't plan for this.
And while you grow i wanna be there for it.
(I don't wanna wait)
Please promise I'll get that chance another day
Please promise me I'll get another chance to prove to her another day
Another day
