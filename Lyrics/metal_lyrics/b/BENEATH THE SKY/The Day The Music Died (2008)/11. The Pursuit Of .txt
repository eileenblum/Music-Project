Say goodbye to the resurrection,
For here comes the apocalypse.
Why must we constantly live in fear?
Breathe in the greed and filth
Of our everyday society.
Breathe out the religions and politics.
These laws no longer apply to us.
Was it supposed to be so simple?
Shining a light to see the darkness filled
With blood and greed, so hollow.
Fighting desperately against my shadow.
They tell us we can be whatever we want to be.
It's called "The Pursuit of Happiness."
But do we really ever find it?
Sure we might have our moments of bliss.
It's just a shame that it doesn't last forever,
Brings us back to the old saying,
"Easy Come, Easy Go."
Right now, I stand for the truth.
Right now, I see the worlds for what it is.
Are we afraid to die?
Are we afraid to live?
