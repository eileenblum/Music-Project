From all the promises I've made.
I never learned to keep shit.
It's not my fault you fell in love,
With a thief and a liar.

You've burned all of the pages.
That brings back the man of your dreams,
A world for you and I.
And everybody else.

Funny,
How I use to think that dreams come true,
Somebody please tell me that I'm still asleep.
And this will go away.

Let's raise our glasses and drink ourselves away,
This is just another picture perfect romance.
Being set up for the kill.

Chop up three lines of snow,
Shoot it up,
Get your fix and let yourself go.
She feels real good tonight.
All dressed up for the ball.

Funny,

Let's raise our glasses and drink ourselves away.
This is just another picture perfect romance.
Being set up for the kill.

Shoot it up,
Get your fix, and let yourself go....
From all the promises you've made.
You never learned to keep shit.
It's not my fault I fell in love with a slut and a whore.

Trapped in this lonely cage.
Crawling to find a way,
Out of here, will you help me escape?
Don't attack me while I'm barley breathing.

It will, hit so hard
Keep coming with,
All of your projects
It wont, take so long
To tell you, its all over
Feels like home.
Feels like home.
Feels like home.
Feels like home.

Wash the dirt out from my veins
Sweating till there's no love in here.
It's tougher than you thought it would be.
Tonight's the night,
Will you take the beating?

It will, hit so hard
Keep coming with,
All of your projects
It wont, take so long
To tell you, its all over
Feels like home.
Feels like home.
Feels like home.
Feels like home.

Why don't you stay away
From what will hurt you?
Why won't you break away
From things that hurt you?
Feels like home.
Feels like home.
Feels like home.
Feels like home.

Drifting away.

Take everything we are
