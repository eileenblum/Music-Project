Some say that the world is falling apart.
Wouldn't you agree with that?
Baby, we already know, that the world is dead to us.
Let us return the favor.
By putting an end to all of this.

Living a lie is more painful than the truth.
There are more things worse than death,
And one of them is you.

My mistake for carving,
My name inside your head.
You're the only person,
The only one I regret.

This is not what I promised to myself.
Death seemed like the only option.
I have fallen for this many times before.
You tell me its one thing and now its another.
Thanks to you, I'll never be the man I once was.
Do I dare ask,
"How does that make you feel?"

Living a lie is more painful than the truth.
There are more things worse than death,
And one of them is you.

My mistake for carving,
My name inside your head.
You're the only person,
The only one I regret.

Yours truly,
"I'm the one who got away."
My heart turns to ashes...
I am burned with her taste.

My mistake for carving,
My name inside your head.
You're the only person,
The only one I regret
