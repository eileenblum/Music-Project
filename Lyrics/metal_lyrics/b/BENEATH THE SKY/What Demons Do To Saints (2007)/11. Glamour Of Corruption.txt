What will they bring to our attention today?
They only feed you with what you want to hear.

I'm so sick of turning it on, I just wish I could turn it off.
I'm so sick of turning it on, I just wish I could turn it off.

My eyes are blinded by this glamour of corruption.
My ears are deafened by this voice of depression.
Is this something you need just to make you feel alive?

Is this your cry for help? (cry for help)
Nobody's listening but yourself.
[Repeat]

[Chorus:]
I heard it all, I hate it all, why still complain?
In our eyes we have seen what needs changed.

You should have seen this coming, âcause it already has.
Is this something you want just to make you feel alive?

[Chorus]

Most of the time I realize that we are better off dead!
Most of the time I realize that we are, that we are better off dead!

Better off dead.
[8x]
