7861 Blackthorne.
[Repeat]

They found the body hanging from the ceiling.
Once again staring down at a casket.
Run far away from the casket.
And don't let me go back inside.
Now are you set free?

Now are you set free?
That you left us in your cage.
Now once again something apart of my life dies again and lives again.

What made you decide that the only way, is the wrong way?
Was it the thought of failure?
Or was it the girl?
Or was it the drugs that became your friends that night?

Look at you now!
Look what you've done!
I can't promise you a rose garden.

Can you see her? (this vision with closed eyes)
Watching you (I'm not ready for this)
Through her eyes (it's time for the final act)
Can you see?
Do you believe? (as the curtains close)
Will you save me? (as the curtains closed, as the curtains closed)

Now don't ever hear me wrong.
These years have passed me by, and I'm still wondering why?
Why a man would take his life?
(Take his life)
I still love you my friend.

They look at me now!
They know what I've done!
They can't promise me a rose garden.

Can you see her? (this vision with closed eyes)
Watching you (I'm not ready for this)
Through her eyes (it's time for the final act)
Can you see?
Do you believe? (as the curtains close)
Will you save me? (as the curtains closed, as the curtains closed)

As you struggle within your noose, what was your last thought?
Just cut your rope!
You could've been saved
Just cut your rope!
