As I walk in a room filled with gloom. I don't know what to do.

[Chorus:]
(Suddenly) Suddenly, my life has changed
As another one's been taken (is it so?)
I find myself in a daze as the sorrow grows (sorrow grows)
Tomorrow I lay alone wandering, wondering.
(I lay alone) Wondering how come? What if? And why?
Suddenly, is it so? (is it so?)
Sorrow grows, I lay alone (I lay alone.)

Please give them words of comfort so they may rest in peace.
Please give them words of comfort so they may rest in peace.

[Chorus]

(I lay alone.)
And I can't stand this bad feeling,
Looking at you across the room today, today.
The sun is shining bright outside,
And I can't stand to fight.
Walking away, walking away todayâ¦

Blood in hands, my eyes are shut.
[8x]

Tomorrow I lay alone!

Me! Me! Me! Just let it be!
[4x]
