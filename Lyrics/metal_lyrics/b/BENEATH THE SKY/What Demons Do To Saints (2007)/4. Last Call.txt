She dances around with a drink in hand,
He walks around with a smoke in hand.
She dances around to find the right man,
He walks around to find a one night stand.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'll save this last dance just to be with you.
Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'll save this last dance just to be with you.
I am the man she's looking for,
I am her man tonight.

It's 2 a.m. and it's time to go,
Let me guess you need a ride home.
It's 2:01 and it's time to go,
Hop in my car and let's hit the road to play.

We're finally here
Your room is upstairs
It's just a one night stand
Who really cares?
We're finally here
Your room is upstairs
She leads the way
It's time to play

Gimme some of that sugar (Baby!)
[8x]

I feel so good,
I feel so bad.
I feel so right,
I feel so wrong.
(Repeat)

Good morning, what's her face?
[4x]
We ended a night (We can't replace)
[4x]

Gimme some of that sugar (Baby!)
[3x]
Gimme some of that sugar (Oh yeah!)
