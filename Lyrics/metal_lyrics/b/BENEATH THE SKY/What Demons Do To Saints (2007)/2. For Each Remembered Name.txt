There is a list of names
All written in a book.
I know that every year I take a look.
These names are a part
Not of the book they're written in
But in my very heart

My life is so much better
Than it was before you came.
My life is so much better
Than it was before you came.

Once you've known someone the years cannot erase
The memory of a pleasant word
Or of a friendly face.
When I send out my love,
That's addressed to you,
âCause you're on the list of names
I am indebted to
When I send out my love,
That's addressed to you,
âCause I have a list of names
And I included you.

It's only the thought that counts
(The thought that counts)
It's only the thought that counts
(The thought that counts)
Every year I realize
The biggest gift that God can give
Is knowing people just like you.
I feel composed of each remembered name.
You may not be aware
Of feeling quite the same
[Repeat]

Whether I've known you many years or few
You will always have a part
In shaping the things I do

It's only the thought that counts
(The thought that counts)
It's only the thought that counts
(The thought that counts)
It's all for you, it's all for you.
