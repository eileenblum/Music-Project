My love will rise!

This was a story that was foretold by a man, a prophecy.
He gave his son to us, gave his son.
He died for our sins to be forgiven.

This trust I adore,
This trust I need some more (All forget this day)
Today I realize I take everything for granted,
I take everything for granted.
Today I realize I take everything for gra... I adore
This trust I need some more (Punished by destiny)
Today I realize I take everything for granted,
I take everything for granted.
Today I realize I take everything for granted,
I take everything for granted.

You're the reason I feel in love with yesterday,
You're the reason I dream tomorrow,
You're the reason I live today.
Youâre the reason;
I'll always think of you!
Iâll alwaysâ¦
