God gave birth to mankind,
Mankind gave birth to war.
God gave birth to mankind,
Mankind gave birth to war.
These consequences only helps to make a change.
These consequences only helps to make a change.
Our weight of existence is growing smaller with every grave mistake.

I stay awake, I stay awakeâ¦
Now I stay awake, now I stay awake.
Now I stay awake, now I stay awake.
Nowâ¦ this was our only fate.
This was our last, last road.

One nation, under God
Nation undone... Nation undone...
Nation undone, done, done.
We become undone!
UN-DONE, UN-DONE.

This is my only way to get through,
This is my only way to get through,
This is my only way to get through,
This is my only way.
