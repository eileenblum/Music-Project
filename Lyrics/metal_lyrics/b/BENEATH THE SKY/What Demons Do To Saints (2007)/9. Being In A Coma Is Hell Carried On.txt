A restless beauty riddled with some bruises and broken bones,
A mother can't recognize her only daughterâ¦

Was it really worth it?!
Was it really worth it?!

[Chorus:]
So you had these dreams?
Just look at what you've done!
Just look at what you've done!

Don't ever put the key in the ignition,
One is too many, and a thousand is never enough.

Metal against metal, misfortunate death
Inflicted by consumption of your poison.

[Chorus]

Floating away from meâ¦
I can see myself, I can see myselfâ¦
Reflection in a mirror, I've tried to run but you're so far away
Hold your hands closer to feel my heart beating,
Hold your hands closer to feel me.
Hold your hands closer to feel my heart beating,
Hold your hands closer to feel me.
One day you'll see me in the clouds watching over you.
