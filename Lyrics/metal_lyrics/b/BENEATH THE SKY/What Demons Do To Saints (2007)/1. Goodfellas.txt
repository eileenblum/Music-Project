Every day is a nightmare;
With every night there lies a dream.
[4x]

These faces are fading away with every word,
Every word you say.
Now what is it that you really want?
That you're looking for?
Bow down and pray,
Never to obey.
What's the question?
What's the answer?
It can't save you.
It can't save you.
It can't save you.

They want power, we want respect.
They want power, we want respect.

Live by your own words and your own dreams,
Never break this oath.
Don't let them tell you what to do,
Never how to think.
Now what is it that you really want?
That you're looking for?
Now you know the question and you know the answer
You get what you fucking deserve.

They want power, we want respect.
They want power, we want respect.

Make the best of what you've got.
Make the best of what you are.
[4x]
