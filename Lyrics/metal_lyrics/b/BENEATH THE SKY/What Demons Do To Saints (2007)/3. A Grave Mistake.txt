She says I wouldn't understand.
She screams "You don't know what it's like!
To cut yourself to live again, to pop some pills to love again.
To cut yourself to live again, to pop some pills to love again.â

Sure, I've tried. But now.

[Chorus:]
She wakes up crying in her bed all alone.
She wakes to find herself.
She wakes up crying in her bed all alone.
She wakes to find herself to be... all alone.

I'll take your fucking name all the way to the goddamn grave.
I'll take your fucking name all the way to the goddamn GRAVE!
âTil death do we part, âtil death do we part.

Sometimes we've got to fall,
Learn to stand.
Sometimes we've got to fall
Just to learn to love ourselves again.

There's more to life than just this.
There's more to life than just this.
There's more to life than just this.

[Chorus]

It was never supposed to be this way, but I still fall for you.
It was never supposed to be this way, how I still fall for youâ¦

How I still fall for youâ¦
Bury the past, there's more to life than just this.
[Repeat]
