Through the dark I'm running pout to find my destination
The myth is real I met her name, she invited me to stay
Don't you know the evil one?
And far away, behind the hell another world is rising
A new domain will reign the earth full of rage and pain
Don't you know the evil one?

[Chorus1:]
Daughter of the Minotaur
We have spent our lives searching for the light of will
But I don't wanna die without knowing her out of the dark

[Solo1: Atxondo]

And now I see she came to me crying out for freedom
She stole the sphere from the evil one
The Minotaur has been defeated for its own blood

[Chorus1]

[Chorus2:]
Daughter of the Minotaur
You have saved our lives
Fighting for the precious sphere now you'll become fire
Against the evil, save our souls
