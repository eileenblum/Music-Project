Pain inside is growing slowly
While silence remains that you have gone
Alone and desperate, full of rage
Wondering again if that's the price I have to pay
I pray to the skies for the time will no longer back

[Chorus1:]
I Still believe, time stand still. I still believe in your eyes

My memories will never fade, will always be with me
Whispering the wind all my love
I've tried, yes I've tried, to live without your love
But all my strenghs have gone
I swear to the skies that my heart will always be yours

[Chorus2:]
I still believe in you and me
I still believe in your eyes
I still believe that we're meant to be
I still believe in your eyes

Promises we made long time ago
I swear for my life that you'll never be alone

[Solo1: Ebelman]
[Solo2: Atxondo]

I swear to the skies that my heart will always be yours

[Chorus2]

[Solo3: Atxondo]

I still believe
I still believe
