Right here and now, release from your pain
And all your tears will be washed away
The time beliving will give you the strength
To carry on fighting day by day
And now, I feel the steel running through my veins

Fight for your freedom, and fight till the end
And from the ashes you'll born again
Like the Fenix from death I will back
To guide our people straight out the dark
And now I'll take the way leading us to sunrise

[Chorus:]
Firebird - leave my sins behind and take my dreams
Away, release them from the chains, forever free

[Solo1: Ebelman]
[Solo2: Atxondo]

And now I feel the steel running through my veins
All those years I've been waiting the time to fly high

[Chorus:]
