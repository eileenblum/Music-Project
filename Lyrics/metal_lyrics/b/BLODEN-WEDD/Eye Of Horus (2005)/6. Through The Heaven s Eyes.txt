Face up a new world and take a look at yourself
You're so lonely, but still you carry on
There's nothing to fear, your life will start here
You're a warrior of the night you'll always fly away

Through the darkest nights your light will always bright
Life will go on, and we made the storm
From now you will fell that

[Chorus1:]
Through the Heaven's eyes
You're a star, you're a guiding light
In yourself trust
Trust in a world full of life and love
And then so many things shall change

Don't care of what they say, the truth is in your hands
'cause deep inside you know real times began
Now you will find a future without past
Have no fear

[Chorus1]

[Melody1: Ebelman]
[Melody2: Atxondo]
[Solo: Ebelman-Atxondo]

[Chorus1:]
Through the Heaven's eyes
You're a star, you're a guiding light
In yourself trust
Trust in a world full of life and love
And then so many things...

Through the Heaven's eyes
You're a star, you're a guiding light
In yourself trust
Trust in a world full of life and love
Then so many things shall change
