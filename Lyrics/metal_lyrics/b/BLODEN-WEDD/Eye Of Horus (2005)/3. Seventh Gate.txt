I'm watching you and I see the truth
In the morning rising spread my forces
In the skies I'll watch you die
When the illuminated find the alliance
And now is time to power of mankind
Prove yourself that you can make a change
Have in mind the secret never told
Is the path to the dark

[Chorus1:]
In your dreams, in yourself find the light and feel alive
And when the comet ride the sky
We will never forget the past we have left behind

[Solo1: Ebelman]
[Solo2: Atxondo]

[Chorus2:]
In your dreams, in yourself is the key to open the seventh gate
To release all your powers and be the guide of the change
And when the comet ride the sky
We will never forget the past we have left behind

The seventh gate is open to your heart
