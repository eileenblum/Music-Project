In the field of rage and fear battle has begun
For thousand years metal forces always have survivied
But now I'm seeing extermination

[Chorus 1:]
Power metal pride! Power metal pride!
Was sent from the universe, metal never dies
Power metal pride! Power metal pride!
I stan with the flame not alone

Through the time, against the wind, we climb up to the skies
Forever free, without a guide, a chosen way of life
Shout your mouth, my destination is

[Chorus2:]
Power metal pride! Power metal pride!
Was sent from the universe, metal never dies
Power metal pride! Power metal pride!
I'll fight till' the kingdom returns

[Solo1: Atxondo]
[Solo2: Ebelman]

[Chorus1]
[Chorus2]

Power metal... power metal... power metal pride
Power metal pride!
