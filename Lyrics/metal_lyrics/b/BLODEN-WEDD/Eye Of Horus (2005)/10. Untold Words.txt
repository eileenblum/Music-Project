Far away from here
Buried in a eternal dream you are
The light of illusion seems dead wings
My soul is wounded
Waiting for some blow of hope
And through the rainbow's colors will

[Chorus:]
Try to fly, from distant skies
To find those untold words
Try to fly, and reach the stars
Time has distanced us

With a scream of desperation
I will break the ice, where you're trapped
By the fault of that sea of lies
Your sweet voice is gone
And now I can smell your solitude
But the wonderful horizon told me about you

[Chorus]

When the absence is the worst pain
More I want to find those untold words...
