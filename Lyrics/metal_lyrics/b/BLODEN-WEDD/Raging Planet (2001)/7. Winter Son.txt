Under the sun they control our wishes guiding our lives to the end
Walking away, down the streets I'm feeling
The power of life all around my growing world

[bridge]

And I want to live my life ok, I want to stay out of worries

[chorus]

And all I want it's just to carry on, spread my wings and fly again
Sometimes I feel it's nothing I can win but it's time to break the ice
I'm a winter son

Take me away, I wanna be the sinner to follow the light of my heart
I scream the winds, clouds will send the message
And it will be heard in every corner of the world

[bridge]

[chorus]

We are the ones that never will fall
We are the ones, look in the future calming down the pressure inside
We must realize until the end of times
End of time
