Seven nations fighting for the dream of power lost control
Now the sun is gone away, the darkness hour fills the earth

[bridge]

But when you don't know what is the reason
when you will raise up your head
Are the angels from future, They come down from space
To save all the young ones who trust in their fates

Armageddon has began, the sounds of trumpets are the sign
The seven raiders state the end, the final Omen is here to reign

[bridge]

[chorus]

Faith is the only way to survive finding a reason to stay

[solo 1(Atxondo)]
[solo 2(Elbelman)]
[solo 3(Elbelman)]
[solo 4(Atxondo)]

[chorus]

No one can take me away
