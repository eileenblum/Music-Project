From the skies, someone is criying the pain of our mother earth
Day after day, mankind is killing our grounds, an nobody cares

[bridge]

But in so many times we didn't anything, and now is too late I see

[chorus]

To reverse the things, there are so many extinted
And if we wait some more, we will loose it all
our earth, and thats forever, it's the end

Right here and now, too many species have left thier world for our guilt
And I wonder why what are we waiting to stop and give us a chance

[bridge]

[chorus 2]

To reverse the things, there are so many extinted
And if we wait some more, we will loose it all
our earth, and thats forever
Again we will fight, we must realize
In your hands is the key to save all our dreams
In a land full of empties and sins

[solo 1(Elbelman)]
[solo 2(Atxondo)]

[chorus 3]

To reverse the things, there are so many extinted
And if we wait some more, we will loose it all
our earth, and thats forever
Again we will fight, we must realize
In your hands is the key to save all our dreams
And a sky to fly together in a world full of life, again we'll see.
