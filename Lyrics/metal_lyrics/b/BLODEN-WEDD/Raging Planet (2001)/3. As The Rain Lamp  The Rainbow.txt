Far away, thousands of miles from you
climbing up the skies to find my way home
deep inside I keep yout memories alive
From the growing pain my soul will fly again

[bridge]

It's time for all that I've been criying
The dream of my childhood turns in reality
I wish to return where my heart always belonged

Close your eyes, will be no more wasted time
with the morning light I'll return
I trust myself, a new horizon is coming near
the rain will fade, and the sun will shine again

[bridge]

[chorus]

As the rain and the rainbow, we'll stay togheter, live forever
As the rain and the rainbow, you and me, till the end of centuries

[solo 1(Elbelman)]
[solo 2(Atxondo)]

[chorus]

...we'll stay together.
