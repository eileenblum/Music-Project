I'm all alone, I hear your voice from far beyond, the stars
Tears in my eyes, the winter is fall, I'm waitng for the angels call
I'm fading away, through the rain I walk without a guiding light
Remeber my life, I can't feel anymore, it's time to say goodbye

[chorus]

By my side, always you will fly
By my side, times for glory rides
By my side, you will be tonight
By my side, hope will never die

From deep inside my heart is crying your leaving from this world
And see your smile once again it's all I want to do, all I want to do

[chorus]

By my side, always you will fly
By my side, times for glory rides
By my side, you will be tonight
By my side, hope will never die

How long it's the pain for love?
The rain will stop some day
Because I need you again with me.
