The sun is extinguished, a sign for the demons to attack the pearly gates.
Rebirth of darkness, totalitarian reign, elimination of all holy light.
Flood the fields in filth and fire.
Behold the temples turn to butcheries.
Usurper, thy name is Satan.
Slayer, thy name is Satan.
Conqueror, thy name is Satan.
Tormentor, thy name is Satan.
Universal king, thy name is Satan.
The only god, thy name is Satan.
Prepare!
Without mercy victory shall prevail.
Paradise lost in blood and fog.
This is the fall of the impotent god.
Crucified angels descended to hell.
The Nazarene enslaved by thorns.
Jehovah drowned in the lake of fire.
Fire!
Usurper, thy name is Satan.
Slayer, thy name is Satan.
Conqueror, thy name is Satan.
Tormentor, thy name is Satan.
Thy name is Satan.
Satan!
Thy name is Satan.
Thy name is Satan.
Thy name is Satan.
