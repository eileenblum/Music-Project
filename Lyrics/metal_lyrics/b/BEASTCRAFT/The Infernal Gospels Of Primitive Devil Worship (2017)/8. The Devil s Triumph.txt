Abyssic storms ravage the lands and seas, for these are the trumpets of the demons.
Behold the darkness rising.
Behold Jehovah's death.
Behold the endless night.
Behold the Devil's triumph.
The bestial cacophony of the legion from hell (is) sounding the coming of master Satan.
Behold hell's fiery pit.
Behold the serpent's dawn.
Behold the blood of the goat.
Behold the Devil's triumph.
A manifestation of the unwritten revelation (is) finally brought forth through sacrificial rites.
All that once was shall perish in brimstone (and) a new existence shall rise from the embers.
Realms and race created in His image.
Pure, flawless supremacy unfolds.
One true elite to rule as one entity.
Legion, tyrants, crowned, now and forever.
All that once was shall perish in brimstone (and) a new existence shall rise from the embers.
Abyssic storms ravage the lands and seas, for these are the trumpets of the demons.
Behold the darkness rising.
Behold Jehovah's death.
Behold the endless night.
Behold the Devil's triumph.
The bestial cacophony of the legion from hell (is) sounding the coming of master Satan.
Behold the resurrection.
Behold the burning temples.
Behold the craft of the beast.
Behold the Devil's triumph.
Behold Satan.
