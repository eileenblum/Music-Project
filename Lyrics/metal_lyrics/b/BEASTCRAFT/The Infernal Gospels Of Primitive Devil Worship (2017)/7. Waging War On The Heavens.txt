I have risen up, waging war on the heavens.
By stealth I have conquered the realm of God.
I sit upon the throne of all creations, as lord of heaven and earth and hell.
I force all angels to kneel before me.
I crucify Jesus upon his cross.
I rape the Virgin Mary and make her my concubine and I speak the word of the new aeon.
I speak the word "Sathanas".
By the power of the word "Sathanas", the universe will be destroyed and a new universe is created.
Xem Sathanas!
Xem Sathanas!
Lucifer has risen.
The dragon has awakened.
The gates have been opened.
The heavens have been conquered.
The aeon of the beast has begun.
From the east the dragon shall rise from the sea.
From the north the beast shall descend from the sky.
From the west the serpent shall crawl across the lands.
From the south the horned god shall bathe the ground in the fires of hell.
All hail the new universe!
Xem Sathanas!
Xem Sathanas!
Xem Sathanas!
Xem Sathanas!
