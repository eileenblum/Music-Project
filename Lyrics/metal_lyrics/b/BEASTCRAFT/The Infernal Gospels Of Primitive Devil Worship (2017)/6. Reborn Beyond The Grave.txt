Their feeble souls reek of death, yet the stillborn walks the earth.
Still preaching for Armageddon, their illusions lives on.
Disciples of the king of the dead, the thorncrowned, crucified.
The mausoleum, gathering of the herd, forever chained to his gates.
When life is trapped within ones funeral march, all hope is forever lost.
Dim the lights of the dying race.
Entering total darkness.
Nothing is left to create a future, but a knife for your veins.
Their souls reek of death, yet the stillborn walks the earth.
Still preaching for Armageddon, their illusions must die!
The cross has fallen.
Only shadows remains.
Kill yourself to become the demon of wrath.
Reborn beyond the grave.
An entity of hellish might forever to rule the ground.
Nefas reborn.
