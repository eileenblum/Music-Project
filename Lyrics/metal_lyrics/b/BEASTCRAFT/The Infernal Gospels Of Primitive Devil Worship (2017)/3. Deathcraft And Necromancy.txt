Into the fire from relentless darkness.
Lost in the void far beyond time.
Lightless and still, lifeless and cold.
Into the fire beneath the shadows with a broken halo twisted into horns.
Onwards downwards to abyssic upheaval.
Born on deathrow, decades in wait.
Ready for the reaping.
Hell awaits.
Into the fire beyond the gates where carnal flesh perish in flames.
Demonic rebirth through deathcraft and necromancy.
Ungraceful infernity in godless fields.
A welcomed doom for misanthropic souls.
For misanthropic souls.
For misanthropic souls.
