Demonic perversion.
Azazel, guardian of the goat.
The demon of the second order, king of the Seirim.
The ancient goatlike spirits denied to worship Adam and the word of God:
"Why should the son of fire fall down before a son of day?"
Demonic perversion.
Azazel, unbound archdemon, cast from heavens above (and) imprisoned in the desert.
Escaped from the Dudael to fuck the mortal maidens and spread the seeds of evil.
Vengeance upon the angels, drowned in fire.
Demonic perversions.
The demon walks the earth.
Driven by centuries lust for the women of the cloak (and) rape and fornication.
Azazel, father of bastards, the ungodly breed that shall inherit the earth through demonic perversion.
