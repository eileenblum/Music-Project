The second coming of jehovah's son
With his army of angels
Bearing the sacred light

Up from the ashes, rises the fallen
With his armies of demons
Bearing unholy might

The king of the jews
Down on his knees
Crawling through the mud
Wounded and humiliated
A crown of barbed wire
Cutting through his skull
A second hanging on the cross
Nails through open sores

Armageddon
The final battle
Obliteration
Satanic victory

Avengers from heaven
Failing their quest
Prophetic lies from the holy book

Wingeless angels fell
Blood upon the land
A feast for the worms from beyond the grave

Armageddon
The final battle
Obliteration
Satanic victory
Armageddon
The final battle
Obliteration
Satanic victory
