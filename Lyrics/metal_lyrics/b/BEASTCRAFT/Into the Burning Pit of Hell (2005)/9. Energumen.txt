Eaten from inside
Soul devoured by evil
Possessed by the unholy ghost
The spirit of Satan
Driven to murder
Forced to desecration

Raping his own flesh
With the same knife
That his kin felt
In the witching hour
The bloodflow creates
A gateway to Hell

Open veins... deathlust
At one with Hell... energumen
