Hear my prayer, master
In my final hour
Your will has been done
All the prophecies fulfilled
All these lives I have taken
Sacrificed and desecrated
In your honour and glory
At your majesty's command
I summon you, my body is your key
I worship you, possess me
I summon you, my soul is your gate
I worship you, take me

Step forth, master
From my human shell
Out from the deepest abyss
To kill the race of man

I am your humble disciple
A number in your legion
An executioner on earth
A tormentor in Hell

I summon you, my body is your key
I worship you, possess me
I summon you, my soul is your gate
I worship you, transform me
