Enter the chasm
Bring your offering
Into nothingness
The court of gods
Slaughtered lambs
Images of jehovah
Scattered remains
Disciples twelve

Your lord is dead
Deceased divinity
Satanic eternity
All hail Satan
The lord of lords

Rejoice in blood
The sacred flesh
Reborn to slay
The chosen few
Seal the casket
Of human kind
Spill its blood
Upon the stones

The bloodline is drawn
Demonspawned sacrifice
Lifeless hellwhore of the black mass
Stigmata of christ
The sore of god
Rain of blood unlock the gates

Your god is dead
Deceased divinity
Satanic eternity
All hail Satan
The lord of lords

From beyond the reign of Hell
Rose the serpent
The threeheaded king
Up from the sea to claim its ground
Elimination of man
The age of darkness
