Children burnt on the altar
By the worshippers in sepharvaim
All in the honour of Adrammelech
The lord chancellor in Hell
Keeper of the wardrobe of the demon king
A president in Satan's private council
The high council of the devils

Adrammelech, Adramelechk
The gods of sepharvaim
We worship thee
Take this burnt offering

A child burnt as a sacrifice
Children burnt on his altar
