Enter the catacombs
Into the chambers
The unholy regions
Where demons reign
Prowling darkness
Ripping evil
Stench of death
The realm I seek

Born to descend
Like the angels that fell
Never to die
Like the slaves in Hell

Into the burning pit of Hell

Ancient caves
That no man has walked
Perpetual night
Where all life dies
My demonic spirit
Strangle my shell
Shreds my skin
No longer a human

Born to descend
Like the angels that fell
Never to die
Like the slaves in Hell

Into the burning pit I fall
Into the burning pit of Hell
