6 bodies in a candlelit cellar
6 female virgins chained to the walls
6 priests around a pentagram in blood
Upon the spread ashes of dead martyrs

Dry blood unites the circle
Spread legs upon each points
The sixth body in the middle
Covered in faeces and goatsemen
Pentagram
Sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice
Pentagram
Sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice
(devil's meat)

6 bodies in the pentagram
6 daggers penetrating human flesh
6 stabbed cunts bleeding a doorway to Hell

The rites has been chanted
The sacrifice has been done
The demon will appear
To feast upon flesh

Pentagram
Sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice
Pentagram
Sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice
(demon's feast)
