This is the night for profanation,
Devil-worship under the sign of Hell.
Bloodstained altar of stone,
Surrounded by the flames of Satan.

Kiss the goat,
Osculum obscenum.
Praise darkness,
Walpurgis night.

This is the night for sacrifice,
Devil-worship under the sign of Hell.
Bloodstained altar of stone,
Surrounded by the flames of Satan.

Kiss the goat,
Osculum obscenum.
Praise darkness,
Walpurgis night.

Remorseless... hopeless...
Bestial... chaotic storms.

Desecrated monuments
of holiness in fire.
Satanic feast
of the blasphemous legion.
Behold the skull throne
of the disciples twelve.
Rejoice in the infernal,
Unholy fields.
Eternal darkness,
Satanic black.

This is the night for murder.
Devil-worship under the sign
Of Hell.
Bloodstained altar of stone,
Surrounded by the flames
Of Satan.
