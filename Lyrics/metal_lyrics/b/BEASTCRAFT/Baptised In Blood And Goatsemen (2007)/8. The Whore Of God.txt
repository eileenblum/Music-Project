Evil, Darkness, Hunger
fall from grace.
Virginity torn asunder.
Angel, fornicator, whore
brought to Hell
by the deserters of war.

Chained to the brothel of Satan,
by the tail of the serpent.
The whore of god, demon-raped.
Darkness, hunger, evil
No escape from the diabolic tormentors.
Fornicator, whore, angel
fed with the remains of her abortions.

Chained to the bordello of Satan
by the tail of the serpent.
The whore of god, demon-raped.
Hunger, evil, darkness
Perverted orgies before the dark throne.

Whore, angel, fornicator
violated by claws
and horns of devils.

Funeral winds
over mud-whore earth.
Merciless genocide
of nations.
The fallen one rose
with flames.
Hellfire floods the lands.

Demons conquer the sky,
Angels fall like rain.
Endless nights of terror,
Endless streams
of holy blood.
