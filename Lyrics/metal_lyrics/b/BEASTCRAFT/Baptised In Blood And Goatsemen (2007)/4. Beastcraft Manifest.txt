I place myself before all men and women.
I refuse to take the name of god in my mouth.
I deny the power of the holy trinity.
I believe Satan to be the true god of the earth.
I have given my soul to the infernal hordes of Hell.
I declare myself as a soldier of Satan
And I will fight by his side once Armageddon comes.
The crucifix is a symbol of weakness.
The right-hand path shall perish, mankind is just flesh.
Hell is the true paradise,
Darkness is my light,
Hate is power,
Power is everything.
