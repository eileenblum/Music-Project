Bring forth the true whore of Babylon.

Liber vaticinationem,
Monarchy infernal,
Hell-spawned millennium,
Darkness through fire,
Skies of funeral black,
6 decades before the war,
Death conquers the cross,
Aries commands all.

The new dawn
Of total satanic dominion
Shall bear the number 3797.
Buried in the deceitful
Lights of the shepherd,
Until the gates of Hell
Falls with Jehovah.

The darkest eclipse since the birth of time... obscure, nocturnal
Endless darkness rises,
Behold his coming.
A decade from the century
Through the dead shell,
My flaming soul bursts.

Liber vaticinationem,
Monarchy infernal,
Hell-spawned millennium,
Darkness through fire,
Skies of funeral black,
6 decades before the war,
Death conquers the cross,
Aries commands all.

The new dawn
Of total satanic dominion
Shall bear the number 3797.
Buried in the deceitful
Lights of the shepherd,
Until the gates of Hell
Falls with Jehovah.

The prophetic code of the apocalypse
Shall bear the number 3797.
Buried in the deceitful lights of their god,
Until the sun dies and
The Antichrist's enthroned.
