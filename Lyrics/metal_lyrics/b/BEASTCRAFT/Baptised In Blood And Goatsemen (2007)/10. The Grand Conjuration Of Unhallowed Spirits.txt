Emperor Lucifer, Master of all the revolted Spirits.
I entreat thee to favour me in the adjuration which I
Address to thee mighty minister Lucifuge Rofocale.
Being desirous to make a pact with him.

I beg thee also, O' prince Beelzebub to protect me,
in my undertaking.

O' count Astaroth, be propitious to me and grant
that tonight, the great Lucifuge may appear to me
Under a human form and that he may accord me in
virtue of the pact which I propose to enter into.
O' grand Lucifuge, I pray thee to quit thy dwelling
wheresoever it may be and come hither to speak to me.
