Satanic armies of immortals,
Burning the soil of terra mater,
The last planet untouched
By the soldiers of Hell.
Demons and gouls attack,
Raping holy ground.
Walking serpents spitting venom,
Beast on wings brings death from above.
Rats and vermins spreading disease,
Undead spirits reaping souls.
Your earth is wrapped in cemetery fog,
The only light is hellfire,
Another planet strangled by darkness.
Spinning dead around its core,
Satanic armies of immortals
Burned the soil of terra mater.
The last planet touched,
By the soldiers of Hell.
Demons and gouls attacked,
A now deceased planet.
