When I lay back and rest my eyes i can't help but notice 
And it really blows my mind sometimes it's hard to focus 
it's their pulpit and they worship 
it's really funny how they be talking down on the religious a hypocrite when they run their mouth
The one they worship is far more dangerous with a bigger body count and it's far more famous

Go to the altar to your vote
There's no moral ground
Beg to your masters to your gods
They won't hear you

A similar level and you are not special 'cause you don't believe in Christ
May not be Muslim or Buddhist or Hindu or Jewish those just aren't the ones you like
I don't mean no disrespect
You love the law books and yes you cling to text
Just not the Bible and it's obvious that hypocritical is what you get man walking contradiction

Go to the altar to your vote
There's no moral ground
Beg to your masters to your gods
They won't hear you

I know some of you probably mad at me you try to legislate morality but you are a fraud
Stop acting like you don't believe in God
Say it we know the truth
Saying hail Mary's at the voter booth
You are a fraud 
Stop acting like you don't believe in God
Acting like they made us 
Politicians are your saviors
You are a fraud
Stop acting like you don't believe in God

Go to the altar to your vote
There's no moral ground
Beg to your masters to your gods
They won't hear you
