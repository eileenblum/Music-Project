You think you know the ones you should be avoiding
Meanwhile one of your boys injecting the poison
You got folks next to you faking galore and he giving you money but you're making him more
A couple false promises it's obvious that you ain't getting nothing out of the deal but you back him for real
And they've been running your cities for about 70 years and you keep on supporting 'cause what he says appeals

You've gotta be out your mind
You're falling for the okie dokie and that's every time
They got a hold on you and it's one of a kind
What will it take to realize that they ain't on your side

You ignore the truth that's right in front of you
You still believe what you wanna believe
What's it gonna take for you to realize that everything is lost and you're to blame

I used to be under the spell
I was a dummy could tell now I just know you too well
Now I sit back and look at the fact that you have never been what you claim to be
You're a fake that's been snaking me
So while you guilt trip me to death
I got you out of the picture and I ain't missed a step
Kind of like you never left so you been feeding lies but my folks still treat you like the god that you're not

But I'll give you props on that
You got us by the gonads you're a snake in the grass
Blindly follow you and I can't be mad
'Cause that's on us though that's really sad

You ignore the truth that's right in front of you
You still believe what you wanna believe
What's it gonna take for you to realize that everything is lost and you're to blame

We're lost and you're to blame
We're lost and you're to blame

Social justice is what they're calling it now
it's more like masked racism I'm calling it out
Act superior but the empirical evidence shows that you think every other race is inferior though
So let's go ahead and get to the real
Decipher through all of the bull and I'll tell you the deal 
And I don't give a crap how that makes you feel
Because the one you need to watch is the white liberal

He's a fox indeed
Showing all of his teeth but he's smiling cheek to cheek when will you see
Don't look to him to succeed 'cause it ain't what it seems and it's him that's pulling the string

You've gotta be out your mind
You're falling for the okie dokie and that's every time
They got a hold on you and it's one of a kind
What will it take to realize that they ain't on your side

You ignore the truth that's right in front of you
You still believe what you wanna believe
What's it gonna take for you to realize that everything is lost and you're to blame

Sing it

We're lost and you're to blame
We're lost and you're to blame
We're lost and you're to blame
We're lost and you're to blame
