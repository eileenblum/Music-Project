[feat. Lauren Babic of Red Handed Denial]Loyalty is conditional 
You're misinformed
So they tug at your heartstrings to mask what's underneath

Emotions are running high so it's like nobody notice a lie
Using false security as a bribe but have you ever thought as to why
These people will go around hoping that you frown at the idea like the sky's falling down
Wow
They use it to control you like they package up and own you
Tap your fears and act like this but ask yourself is this really a path you feel
Selling your soul cheaper than a happy meal
it's sad to hear when you cling to a bad idea

Speak in lies 
Deny and imply that we could not get by without you
Rule through fear 
it's clear that you're here to lead sheep to shear their lives away

Entrust our faith to those who bend the knee to the underlying hate that you helped create
So step back the picture is bigger than you think 
How can you open your eyes when you're blinded by a catch phrase

Worth the time or worth the fine I work to find solutions but it hurts when my family falls for the okie doke
Kind of like Obama we saw and we know he choked 
Know what he wrote bro 
Said he was gonna bring the troops home
Got in and started singing a new song but he's cool so they thinking he can't do wrong
Bomb more countries than Bush but I got a new phone

Speak in lies 
Deny and imply that we could not get by without you
Rule through fear 
it's clear that you're here to lead sheep to shear their lives away

Speak in lies 
Deny and imply that we could not get by without you
Rule through fear 
it's clear that you're here to lead sheep to shear their lives away

We know what it is giving you the biz I'm saying you ain't gotta lie to me
We know you got it wrong but you're not alone I'm not asking for apologies
I'd much rather you in a battle mood waking up smelling the coffee
I'm just stressing to spread the message before they turn around and just off me

Speak in lies 
Deny and imply that we could not get by without you
Rule through fear 
it's clear that you're here to lead sheep to shear their lives away

Speak in lies 
Deny and imply that we could not get by without you
Rule through fear 
it's clear that you're here to lead sheep to shear their lives away
