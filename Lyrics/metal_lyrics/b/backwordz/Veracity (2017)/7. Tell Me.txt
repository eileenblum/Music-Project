I be YG Rippa used to be the moniker
An honorable mention it was but now I seem to sign up for other things
Eric Rippa you get either one of em
When I say I'm not longer playing I don't mean the carnival
Y'all softer than gotten candy sweeter than funnel cake
I'm knowing that you're gonna hate but tell your dad his son's a fake
I steady grind from sun to eight I'm talking eight the next day that's why you getting lapped and I'm already on my next pace
Gone and I'm shot calling alone like Jerry Jones or Jerry Sloan
I've never feared for a scary moment
And I'm up on it this opportunity is golden but you should hold up if you're thinking I'd fold up, dawg
Metaphorically my balls bigger than the Trump Tower or the Eiffel one you ain't gotta like it once I'm itching success like a head that got the lice in them
And this is elementary since 10 I've been ciphering

I ain't never had nobody tell me that I would fall and they were right
And I ain't never had nobody tell me that I ain't never put up a fight

This track is aimed at the lame cats that can't rap but want to claim that the kangs back
Come on all I see is clones homes I'm saying that you drones can't rap spitting whack singing the same crap
I'm not liking you 
It the truth that I might be rude
Dang quit biting dude swipe or no swiping dude
And I mean right now as weak as you might sound but like an underground water tunnel you need to pipe down
And it's so retarded
It's like y'all together in booths just to see who be spitting the most garbage
And after that y'all pick the ones that speak the most trash cosign him and sack-ride him until his nuts crash
What's that who gave these people a bus pass
I'm pissed I'm aged plus mad
Somebody put a muzzle on him need to shush that hush that
People don't know what's good or what's bad
Y'all done confused somebody making the latest moves for somebody that's actually spitting and has paid his dues
I'm aching to move steady slaying these faking fools not debating to dumb my raps down for the sake of you
Nowadays since rap is no longer talent based that'll make people completely forget the database and it baffles me
So I'm here ridding the rapping game with insecticides like is Rapper Raid

I ain't never had nobody tell me that I would fall and they were right
And I ain't never had nobody tell me that I ain't never put up a fight
