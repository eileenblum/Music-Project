Sometimes it's difficult to put yourself out there for the criticism but it is what it is

Struggle comes with a lesson I can't be the only one
Questioning my heart and what the times will say about it
Carry on 
The Word is in us if we'll just speak as though we have what we cannot reach keep your heart on it

It seems like more than ever when I say man's not who I serve 
A target's put on my back but what You've endured has got nothing on that
My life is steady on the line for that I will not apologize
I still stand in defeat when it's all said and done I can't take those with me

If no one had faith in me
I'd still believe in You
The world can't set us free
(Set us free)
They'll chain us hands and feet
(The world can set us free)
Take all that I am 
(The world can't set us free)
Consume me renew me
