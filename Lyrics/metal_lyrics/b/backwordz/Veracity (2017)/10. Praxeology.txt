Y'all wanna learn something today?

The debt is at 20 trillion
Why bro? Fundamental econ economic calculation trying to predict a market full of millions
No must be slower than a snails nest that crap don't even pass the small test
Needs less Keynes and Mises then you'll understand why we're in a recess

You're inviting in the poorest men but follow logic to its end
Production seized drives us into poverty
Greed doesn't end with loss of liberty

This ain't just Republican or Democrats this is about a handful of bureaucrats
Know the exact cost of a spending act how in the world can they dictate that
It doesn't make a lick of sense Keynesianism might be the death of us all
The most tanked economies were centrally planned
You get sadness you get famine you get poverty you get everybody just starving

You're inviting in the poorest men but follow logic to its end
Production seized drives us into poverty 
Greed doesn't end with loss of liberty

Should read the Road To Serfdom 
Claim they love the poor but their policies hurt them
Giving them power but is it really worth the trouble when you're productive and your means get needed
Free enterprises seems to rise living standards but man will politic if he ain't got the answers and damage up an economy of he is envious immediately run the other way if he is leading you

You're inviting in the poorest men but follow logic to its end
Production seized drives us into poverty
Greed doesn't end with loss of liberty

Loss of liberty
