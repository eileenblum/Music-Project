Fake fraud I see it in your eyes
Keep putting up that facade and it's probably gon' be your surprise
Acting tough until the wheels fall off and you can protest
Yet ignore the heart of the issue and you know this
I done seen so many folks call themselves pro black ready to March at the drop of a hat but they won't dare criticize the folks in their own town running their city into the ground 'cause they terrorize too
The only difference is they look just like you
They're your uncle they're your brother they're your cousin but you sit back and say nothing 
What you're scared how many more kiss gotta get filled with lead
The killer was the same color but he offed somebody's baby brother

What stares back at you when you look into the mirror
Do you recognize the person you've become

We represent the 13% of the U.S. population but we represent like half the homicides since like '75
Killing our own kind at a faster rate than every other race and that's a disgrace
We can stop police brutality but these problems ain't going away
A gangster and you boast and brag
Killing people over territory and flags you're sad
Robbing grandmommas you're a bonified dimwit
it's like you're on a mission to be another statistic

What stares back at you when you look in the mirror
Do you recognize the person you've become
This doesn't have to be your destiny you can find your way out
Find your way out
What stares back at you when you look into the mirror

You are not real you're a coward
Most of our problems are in house but you're silent like a mouse and you want to cry yet pout
It is too easy to point the finger it's convenient to point the blame but it takes courage to realize what you ain't about
Unfortunately that's something that you ain't got

You're fake 
Your activism is not the truth
it's nothing more than an ego boost
You're fake
So you can shoot and pout
So you go ahead take the easy route

What stares back at you when you look into the mirror
Do you recognize the person you've become
The person you've become
This doesn't have to be your destiny you can find your way out
Find your way out
What stares back at you when you look into the mirror
