The man that you see before you
May not be the one that you knew
Freed from the weight of his youth
Should worry if I chose to stay confused

Take it from me
Change is on the move and it ain't free
You take whatever life gives and hit the streets
Grinding day by day just to compete
Take it from me
May not desire everything I see
Impossible to predict to a T
My expectations change from week to week

The man that you see before you
Free from his old world view
Embraced change and let it renew
Even when he couldn't face the truth
I'm been working on it
I've been bad I've been wrong I've been a freaking addict
Not to drugs but to the wrong habits I've talked about it
I've been lost I've been gone no more trust it's too long
Since I loved or been home yeah

Take it from me
Change is on the move and it ain't free
You take whatever life gives and hit the streets
Grinding day by day just to compete
Take it from me
May not desire everything I see
Impossible to predict to a T
My expectations change from week to week

I try 
I try
I try
I try

Take it from me
Change is on the move and it ain't free
You take whatever life gives and hit the streets
Grinding day by day just to compete
Take it from me
May not desire everything I see
Impossible to predict to a T
My expectations change from week to week
