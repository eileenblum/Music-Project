Tapping out or giving in is not an option for me
People yap run their trap as haters try to torch me
But I still keep it real and own up to my L's
So you'll be waiting forever if you're hoping I fail

What you know about looking opposition in their face
Wishing you'd collapse but you just put them in their place
But holy crap just let me live 
But if you block my path you know what time it is

Never holding back on my way to the top 
No
Nothing's gonna stand in my path
Stand in my path
The grind don't end when the goal is in sight
My minds made up and I'm ready to fight

What's the point of going out your way just so you can snake me
I've done nothing to you but you make efforts just to play me
But lately I've been thinking what the hell have you been drinking
If you're nagging on me expect a reaction from me

Let me live
Is that too much to ask just let me live
Come on and let me live
I'm just saying dog just let me live

Never holding back on my way to the top 
No
Nothing's gonna stand in my path
The grind don't end when the goal is in sight
My minds made up and I'm ready to fight

I'm no longer violent but I'll take it to fists and cuffs
So think it over if you decide to hit me up
I may be peaceful but I don't need a pick me up
So use aggression on me boss you may just get your block knocked off

I'm telling you that this ain't for fun
Why the heck would you hate on him understand that I ain't the one
I'm not saying this to be cynical
Just saying you can get it fool if it happens to get physical

What's the point of going out your way just so you can snake me
I've done nothing to you but you make efforts just to play me
But lately I've been thinking what the hell have you been drinking
If you're nagging on me expect a reaction from me

Let me live
Is that too much to ask just let me live
Come on and let me live
I'm just saying dog just let me live

Never holding back on my way to the top 
No
Nothing's gonna stand in my path
The grind don't end when the goal is in sight
My minds made up and I'm ready to fight
