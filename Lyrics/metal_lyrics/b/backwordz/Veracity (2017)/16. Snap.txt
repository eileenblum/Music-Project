A little crazy and I must face it
I'm on the brink of insanity 
And I'm in neck deep they tried to tell me 
But they're just wasting their breath 'cause I know what I felt 
And I'm thinking that if you're not you're not living 
No need for saving him because we all got a little craziness and you may not want to admit any of it
But I wouldn't want to be around me if I so happen to snap

I'm not in a fragile state of mind
I just don't run away 'cause it's a waste of my time
I'm not in a fragile state of mind
And I might get a bad rap if I so happen to snap

With all that is happens around me idiocy surrounds me
And I don't need no consultation I just don't shy away from confrontation

You came at me with unwarranted nonsense what am I to do
If one of us has to leave tonight with an L bro then it might be you
I think I've possibly already told you that I'm not the one
So back back give me fifty feet if you think conflicts not fun

I'm not in a fragile state of mind
I just don't run away 'cause it's a waste of my time
I'm not in a fragile state of mind
And I might get a bad rap if I so happen to snap

I'm not in a fragile state of mind
I just don't run away 'cause it's a waste of my time
I'm not in a fragile state of mind
And I might get a bad rap if I so happen to snap

If you could see into my mind 
You would know what I've endured
From the brink of my demise 
I have come from further shores

I'm not in a fragile state of mind
I just don't run away 'cause it's a waste of my time
I'm not in a fragile state of mind
And I might get a bad rap if I so happen to snap

I'm not in a fragile state of mind
I just don't run away 'cause it's a waste of my time
I'm not in a fragile state of mind
And I might get a bad rap if I so happen to snap
