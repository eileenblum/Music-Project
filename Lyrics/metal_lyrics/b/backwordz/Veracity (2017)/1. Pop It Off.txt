2015 was the year that we made it happen and we were born
And since then people been arguing about what genre we perform
Nu-Metal Rapcore we are none of those so stop acting stupid
I got an idea so shut the hell up sit back and enjoy the music

Backwordz in the building like we're the ceiling
We're Illin no matter who find it appealing
I'm here and I got a feeling that we'll be dealing a lot of pain wheres the penicillin
Get drilled in your head that we are monsters and yeah we come from slums and for some months we've been pumped but for once I am comfortable 
I want to grow
I want some more success and I'm one to know that greatness can't be rushed
It can't be lust so we face the fuss and feel free to hate on us
We lace them up dues we done paid them up
Keep snakes away from us and safe from us you might wanna be
I remember when clowns used to make fun of me and now they want to be me
See me and they run to me I'm gonna be the greatest yeah I want to be
But I am not the one to be the fakest for the sake of being played
I am here like I had never left
Settle? Hell no 'cause I just can't fail
So just prepare your ears it'll get for real
A test from here we will never take the sell
it's grind time my mind and my thoughts my highs and my faults
My wins and my loss when will I fall off
it's a task for me you are now listening to "Veracity"
