Rise up!
I ain't saying I got the answers but too much collectivism is cancer
Kidnapping you with a ransom saying they gone save you like you're a damsel
But you're not in distress you're just stressed but partially causing it
Yes individuality the only way to succeed is secede

The government is full of dopes bro
You and I both know they broker than a joke though
You might as well run it back they drop the ball like running backs
We got robbed that's a funny fact and you're not getting the enemy back
But I'm okay with that if that means my kids kids kids kids aren't sold through slavery
A state is not saving me and I done went from A to Z
I know the ins and outs so please keep that stuff away from me

I'm not talking about reform
I'm saying stop selling assets of the unborn

Pushing forward
Realizing that we are the marked ones fighting for the freedom of the individual
Rise up own yourself and take back what you've made

We don't really need a revolution
Nah what we need is an evolution
Sort of a reach yeah it might be
But to win this war we gotta tap into the psyche
I'm saying you gotta look at it like this
This ain't a battle of might bro this is a battle of wits
This ain't all about the fighting this ain't a battle of fists
That's why I jump on the mic like education is bliss

Pushing forward
Realizing that we are the marked ones fighting for the freedom of the individual
Rise up own yourself and take back what you've made

Our best efforts is for a free society I'm probably gonna need to be put in succession efforts because once people see that as a perfect example
And the world just doesn't blow up then we can take succession all the way down to the individual

Frustrated as me why can't they see you wanna be free
We may disagree if you're not forcing it don't matter to me
Don't be a sheep just earn your keep until you're deceased
So I say succeed I say secede I say secede

Pushing forward
Realizing that we are the marked ones fighting for the freedom of the individual
Rise up own yourself and take back what you've made
Pushing forward
Realizing that we are the marked ones fighting for the freedom of the individual
Rise up own yourself and take back what you've made
