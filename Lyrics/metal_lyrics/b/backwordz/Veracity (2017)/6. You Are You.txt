I won't be held accountable for the hell of the past
I don't owe a penny or dime to amend for their crimes
Don't you see 
You're illusioned and apologizing for events you had no part in
It's a mass delusion

Just due to my skin tone they applied a path for me
No matter what my ancestry was I was never a slave
I must find that it's asinine that you really think that the path of mine is determined by another mastermind like it's your life and that's out of line

We can't take the credit for what we did not endure
We can't pay for the mistakes that man has made before

Apply this to now 
We can't take credit for our father's successes
This crown is not my own 
Let me earn my keep let me pave my own way

Foolish when you sit and think about it 
It is stupid that you would take credit for our history that you had nothing to do with
Acting bold and proud or acting like you're hurt
But you are owed nothing just because you stood on the same dirt
You are owed nothing

We can't take the credit for what we did not endure
We can't pay for the mistakes that man has made before

Go take what's yours 
Pave your path and find it go decide it
Go take control
You're not obligated to not make it out
Go take what's yours
Pave your path and find it go decide it
Go take control
You're not obligated to not make it out

Just due to my skin tone they applied a path for me
No matter what my ancestry was I was never a slave
I must find that it's asinine that you really think that the path of mine is determined by another mastermind like it's your life and that's out of line

We can't take the credit for what we did not endure
We can't pay for the mistakes that man has made before

We can't take the credit for what we did not endure
(Go take what's yours
Pave your path and find it go decide it)
We can't pay for the mistakes that man has made before
(Go take control 
You're not obligated to not make it out)
