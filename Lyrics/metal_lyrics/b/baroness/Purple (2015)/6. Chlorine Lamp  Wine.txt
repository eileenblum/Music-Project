When I called on my nursemaid
Come sit by my side
But she cuts through my ribcage
And pushes the pills deep in my eyes

The taste was much sweeter
Than chlorine and wine
And my doctorâs unable
To cut through cable that leads to my mind

In spite of the winter
Thereâs ways to keep warm
Whatever you give me
Please know that Iâll ask you for more

The day I stopped swimming
And came out of the tide
Iâd never felt so uncomfortably dumb
Here by your side

Black rose on the bed
Turn me to fire
Black rose in the vein
Shine in your eye

Please
Donât lay me down
Under the rocks where I found
My place in the ground
A home for the fathers and sons

Black rose on the bed
Turn me to fire
Black rose in the vein
Shine in your eye

Please
Donât lay me down
