All fall, as one, as none
Tooth and skin collide
Tide will bury
Buried, buried

Build broken into new

All fall, we've been here for days stuck on shipless sea,
We've got nothing left we raise our eyes to see end of endless fleet,
Tide will bury, we sleep for now

Build broken into new

Blood will turn slave sin to stone,
And stone will carry us back to solid shore
