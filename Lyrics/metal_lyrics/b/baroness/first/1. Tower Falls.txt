Burn
Lest ye be bold
Until the quickening
Unlearned and sill untold
Praise not this dawn
(That will become tomorrow today)
The soil pressed into dust by the heel
Below nothing can ever return
Tower falls
Read
Reprise and reconvene
Take heed an emperor
Does not an empire make
Taste of this wine
(That has become tomorrow today)
Stolen limb from cast
Nothing will ever return
Ever
As we lie
Tower Falls
Search eye and you will find
Not idly they fly
