Rise
Circle
Greet the Sun
Serpent coils unwind
Pressure blood from stone
Now do valleys open wide
Now like rust do we reach out
Now do clouds burst forth under weight
Rise
Rest your shield
Lay down you plow
Wake Inhale Listen Rise
Have you ever seen the scarlet day
Or felt the calloused hand of age
You till the ground and bring to home
Muscle flesh and blood to bone
Taste this oaken grain 
Grab its horns and not the reins
