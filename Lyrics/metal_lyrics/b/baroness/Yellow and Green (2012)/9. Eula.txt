Settle down 
This wonât last long 
Iâve been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away 

When my bones begin to break 
And my head begins to shake 
Itâs my own blood 

When my house becomes a cage 
And the neighbours turn away 
Itâs my own blood 

Settle down 
This wonât last long 
Iâve been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away 

âWhere the butcherâs hand is homeâ 
Laughs the blade above the throne 
âItâs my own bloodâ 

âOh, this apple makes me sickâ 
Cries the pig upon his stick 
âItâs my own bloodâ 

And I canât forget the taste 
Canât forget the taste of my own tongue 
And I canât forget the taste 
Canât forget the taste of my own tongue 

And If I had a heart 
Iâd waste it on you 
But itâs all together far too long 
Since I took you down 

Settle down 
This wonât last long 
Iâve been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away 

When weâve licked all of the lips 
And the salt-stained fingertips 
Itâs our own blood 

When our lambs and lions made 
Debts no righteous man can pay 
Itâs our own blood 

And I canât forget the taste 
Canât forget the taste of my own tongue 
And I canât forget the taste 
Canât forget the taste of my own tongue
