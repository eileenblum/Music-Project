Take me away from the ocean, I've already gone away
I'm already gone

Take me up north to the blue grass, horse meat and pharmacies
I'm already gone

Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls
Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls

We wanted the best for our sweet little September castaway
I'm already gone

She's floating in acetone, covered in bruises and common colds
I'm already gone

Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls
Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls

Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up

Hide your boys...
Hide your girls...
Hide your..
