There was an anchor 
There was a silver-sweet refrain 
You tucked your fingers in between my troubled bones 
And what you did next was second-to-none 
You really let us down 
You tied yourself up 
And jumped in the sea 
Never to come home 

Valium 
You left me all alone 
Tell me when 
I will be whole again 

There was a whisper 
Once there were heralds and parades 
You sang your secrets through the tolling of the tide 
The fugitive rooms, the amateur tombs 
The silence and cries 
The quickening beat 
Your march to the sea 
Never to return 

Sweet morphine 
Youâve taken all of me 
Let me know 
When you will let me go 

Heroin 
Where did you take my friend? 
Tell me why 
Those ropes are hanging high 

Valium 
You left me all alone
