World of hatred
Terror flows within

What is left is wilting
And decaying, hope is dying
Left for some
But the reality is nothing more than demise
What has come
Is lost...

The day of dying grows nearer
By the day hope is dying
Human race blames everything... But itself
But the consequences will show the reason
As they created this destruction
No more shall remain...

World of Demise
Terror flows within
World of Demise
Hatred flows within

What is left is wilting
And decaying hope is dying
Left for some
But the reality is nothing more than demise
What has come
Is lost...

The day of dying grows nearer
By the day hope is dying
Human race blames everything... But itself
But the consequences will show the reason
As they were created for destruction
No more shall remain...

The day of dying grows nearer
By the day hope is dying
Human race blames everything but itself...
