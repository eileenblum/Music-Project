The Scyth takes his foes scalp as a trophy
Adorns them on his horse
Delivers the skull forth to his warlord
Claims his rightful pillage
The skulls are then crafted into proud goblets
To partake of the fallens blood
Adorned in cloaks made from the defeated
He moves proud through their ranks

The hundredth captured by Scyth in battle
Sacrificed to their hungry gods
Slaughtered blood captured in a vessel
Then drained upon the scimitar

Scalps of Scythia...

The Scyth takes his foes scalp as a trophy
Adorns them on his horse
Delivers the skull forth to his warlord
Claims his rightful pillage
The skulls are then crafted into proud goblets
To partake of the fallens blood
Adorned in cloaks made from the defeated
He moves proud through their ranks
