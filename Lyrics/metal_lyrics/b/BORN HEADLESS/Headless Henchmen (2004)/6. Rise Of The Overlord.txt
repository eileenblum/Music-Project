Once known
Once was
Upon this we shall rise
Forth to a greater tier
Upon this a chilling fate

Within the realms...
For it is the way of all warriors
For it is the way of all kings
For it is the way of all warriors
To follow into death those they revere

Seek vengeance seek the strength
Malevolence for the weak
Seek the vessel of power
The blood to guide the land
Seek vengeance seek the strength
Malevolence for the weak
Seek the vessel of power
The blood to guide the land

Blood of the king to guide the land
Blood of the king to guide your hand

To kill...
Souls leave...
To kill...
Pain is to be, it was to be

Within the realms...
For it is the way of all warriors
For it is the way of all kings
For it is the way of all warriors
To follow into death those they revere

Seek vengeance seek the strength
Malevolence for the weak
Seek the vessel of power
The blood to guide the land
Seek vengeance seek the strength
Malevolence for the weak
