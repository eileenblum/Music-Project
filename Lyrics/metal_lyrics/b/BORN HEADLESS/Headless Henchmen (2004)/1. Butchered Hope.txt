Laid open wide
To the marauder
Defenceless weakling
Hiding quivering
Painful bleeding ears
Faith has failed again
Belief is not truth
Mortal hope is slain-and-butchered

Butchered faith - In ignorance
Butchered hope - Of martyrdom
Butchered faith - Realisation
Butchered hope - The fall of man

Now you see the truth
Lids torn from your eyes
Blood runs warm and free
Washing over lies

Now you see
The truth the blade carves into your side
Now you see truth
The blade carves deeper inside

No matter what you say your hope in still falling
No matter what you do your faith is still dying
No matter what you say your hope is still falling
No matter what you do your faith is still dying

Die!!!
Watch your friends dismember each other in jealous
Rage!!!
Observe them fall over as they stumble for the - pain - of - salvation...

Butchered faith - In ignorance
Butchered hope - Of martyrdom
Butchered faith - Realisation
Butchered hope - The fall of man

The fall of man
The fall of god

Butchered hope - In ignorance
Butchered hope - Of martyrdom
Butchered hope - Realisation
Butchered hope - The fall of man

And then you die
The blade
Lets its tongue carve into your soft side

No matter what you say your hope in still falling
No matter what you do your faith is still dying
No matter what you say your hope is still falling
No matter what you do your faith is still dying

Die!!!
Watch your friends dismember each other in jealous
Rage!!!
Observe them fall over as they fall into darkness

The fall of man
The fall of god
Will kill you all...
