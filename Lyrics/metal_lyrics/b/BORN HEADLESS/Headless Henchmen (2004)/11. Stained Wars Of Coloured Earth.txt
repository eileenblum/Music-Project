Bodies lay empty on the ground
Can you taste it?
Heroes once were they
Thou has seen their last day

Clouds
Water-ridden skies
Can you feel it?
Stained wars of coloured earth
Evening dwells as daylight births

Ride through forests of fog
Can you see them?
Heroes once were they
Heroes they have maimed
Heroes they've became

Seek thy men who fled your side when death stared them straight in the eye
Hunt them down and take their life for they are cowards in disguise
Hunt them down and take their life for they are cowards in disguise

Hunt them down and take their life for they are cowards in disguise
Swing the axe and hear the cries
Stained Wars and coloured skies

Stained wars of coloured earth

Swing the axe and hear the cries
Stained Wars and coloured skies

Ride through forests of fog
Can you see them?
Heroes once were they
Heroes they have maimed
Heroes they've became

Seek thy men who fled your side when death stared them straight in the eye
Swing the axe and hear the cries
Stained Wars and coloured skies

Stained wars of coloured earth
