Volatile are the ways of the desperate,
those whose pride drowns their wit
Easy are the unbalanced to strike down,
but hard to predict
A blade easily passes through the flesh and bone,
but more resilient is conviction
If one is set to an action their will

Lets loose the beast
Flesh to feast
A life to cease
The beast is pleased

Bleed...
Die...

The drawn beast
Must taste the blood
Must wet its lips
To sate its lust
Must part the flesh
And drain its fill
The beast of fate
The thrilling kill

Guiding the beast with vision
Volatile are the ways of the desperate,
those whose pride drowns their wit
Easy are the unbalanced to strike down,
but hard to predict
Guide its maw onto the flesh
Let it open it fresh
A blade easily passes through the flesh and bone,
but more resilient is conviction
If one is set to an action their will
Let's loose the beast
On flesh to feast
A life to cease
Guiding the beast with vision

The drawn beast must taste the blood
Must wet its lips to sate its lust...
Must part the flesh and drain its fill
The beast of fate's thrilling kill
The drawn beast must taste the blood
