See thine men who bare cloaks of darkness
Don't fuck with them or they'll kill you
They'll chop your head off with swords of sharpness
Or axes
Or cleavers
CHOP - CHOP

Headless Henchmen
They won't hesitate to kill you
Before thy throne they'll execute you
All the fables you hear are true

Headless Henchmen

Tales once foretold
They all will lose their souls
Chilling cries of noumenon
Nourishment from what has gone

Headless Henchmen
They won't hesitate to kill you
Before thy throne they'll execute you
All the fables you hear are true
Headless Henchmen

Headless Henchmen

See thine men who bare cloaks of darkness
Don't fuck with them or they'll kill you
They'll chop your head off with swords of sharpness
Or axes
Or cleavers
CHOP
