He created a material race
Which would exist on a physical plain
They would be different from the dogs
They would make their own fate

He would not force them to follow him
Though he'd attempt to guide them
To his worship
Hailing him mighty powerful god

To give this independence
From himself to his new subjects
He weaved into their essence
A fragment of his soul

Jealousy burned through their minds
Consuming the dogs' dull ways of before
And they rose up against their master
Attacked and wrought havoc on their lord
