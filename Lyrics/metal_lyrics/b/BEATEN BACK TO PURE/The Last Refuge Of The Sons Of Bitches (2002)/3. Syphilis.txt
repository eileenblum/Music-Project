Shell of a man twisted
Let's go

3rd stage graveyard fodder
Blinded to the light of day
Life's lesions kindred spirits sore
Ascent to sod

Please don't keep me wasting
On a bedpost masturbating

Cunt taste burns my skin
It spreads to Jesus' eyes

Grim baptism in my precum
Seething is believing
Heart aches and my cock is numb

Owe this shit to the hootch, blinded
Better days lay beyond this filth
My life sucks a sin soaked truth
Leave behind but my hands are fuckin tied

Choking up grog and lung
Pain on end [x2]

Insane at death is the best that I can hope for
