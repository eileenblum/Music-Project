Reach out my hands
Feel my cold pulse
I bit more than I could chew this time
Sinking slowly down to china
Wish you could help but your hands were tied.

I'm fucked again

Fuck me again, this time more slowly
I dont ever get to cum
Bleed me freedom, I don't want it
Staring at a glass of jagged rocks

Shellshocked vision, time spent poorly
Raining chum on my parade [x2]
Mother fortune going down for the rent
My end time message, my time has been well spent [x2]

Mother fortune
Bleed me freedom
Staring at my glass of jagged rocks and jagged ice
Oh no, oh no, I'm fucked again, goddamn

To thine ownself be true
And you can find me
Underneath the bottom of your hopes and dreams

Leave me here
I can find my way
Choosers can't be beggars too
