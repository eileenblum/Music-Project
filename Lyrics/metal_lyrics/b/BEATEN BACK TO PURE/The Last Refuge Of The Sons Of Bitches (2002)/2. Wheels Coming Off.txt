Eyes are burning
Motherfucking mouth is drier
Goddamn wheels are turning
Medication kicking in now I know that I'll live on

Head spinning round and round
Get down, face down
Watch my hands shake when I'm speaking
Everyone knows I'm drinking again
Wheels on the wagon coming loose
Looking at the bright side
It aint' nothing new

Retard, well hung jury
I speak the truth

Goddamn, wheels coming off again
Driving off a bridge screaming and numb

Reaching my peak in time
Pour on the holocaust
Come on fools

I swear, I failed, I swear
Incoming
I swear, lord I failed
Wheels coming off one more time
