Jesus touched my shoulder
Stay away from me
Grenade in my glovebox
I'm gagging on your bullshit

Hive of scum and villiany
Touch of lice from touching kids
Horsewhipped

Brought up in West Carolina
Next stop, Tennessee
Harkened back to Hell, stigmata
Only in America does Jesus Save..
Marlboro miles

God loves a working man
But he kills children too

Dreaming in black and white
You only get to die one time
Revel in semen stained sheets
Pelted by my memories

Your winning wet t-shirt dripping rich read
I thought I noticed some labored breathing
Your youth died in the closet that day
When you forgot to say your prayers
Now you know that shame starts somewhere
I think you're too dumb to be this proud
