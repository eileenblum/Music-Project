Road winds through veins like legs
Godspeed to find the dregs
Full speed and hammer down
Ain't no bodies ever found

Be careful what you wish
You don't want none of this
At the deep south end of town
You're hanging dog bound

I see the tracks and the other side
I know that's where I should have died
On Big Yank's famous deathride
Eyeslammed once again

Nothing shines where sunshine shuns
Which came first, crazy or mountain?
Distant cry of someone's young
Hell is where you're home..

Hell is our home...

Blood flows from veins like wine
God fearing and just in time
They are waiting for you in Telheo Plains
Join 'em, you'll never be seen again
Trees keep blowing, never miss a beat
They aren't missing you and you aren't missing me
