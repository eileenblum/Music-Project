I can see the forest in spite of trees
Barrel of a shotgun tastes so cheap
Fall into my arms

Too many times my designs on you, girl
Were better left alone
When you ignored the ringing
I was checking to see if you was home

I don't live in the world as it should be
I deal with the world as it is
I won't join you in your ivory tower
Now you're smothered in sundress
Lying in a rivers bed

Unfinished portions
My love is timeless
Never growing old together

I will promise you this, the hardest time of your life
You've never looked at me this way
With your blood vessel painted eyes
And your skin turning gray
