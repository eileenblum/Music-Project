Trading your years for obedience
Haven't seen the Sun
For days on fucking end

My eyes they drip tomorrows lies
My skin helps me with fornication
Staring dead on jagged rocks
That fill my glass with jagged ice
Cancer rider comin' through
Full on clemency
Another day to be..all you can fuckin' be

Any days a good day to fuckin' die
Full blown tragedy of life
Singularity of an embalmbed embrace
