I know where you drink and you sleep
Renaissance abnormality
Wretching and reeling hogtied
Rolling down filthy, stinking filthy way to be

Trials led untrue baby
Dirtied iconoclast
Bloodshed competition

Useless woebegotten
Itching surfacing
Abcess..mindless...Too far gone

Circling the wagons
Hippie clinic of yesteryear
Isaac Almighty
Say it ain't so

My dreams and life's in shambles
Been down this road before
I fear my life will be over the endline
Or human torch

Desperation has set in
Always planned to get back on my feet
Falling down on failure wine
Pissing out napalm
