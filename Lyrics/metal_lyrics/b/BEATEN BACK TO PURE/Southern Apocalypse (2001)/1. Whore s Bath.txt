Claw out my eyes and I'm singin'
Raped and raped and raped again
Where you been your ol' lady disrespects you
Hold it in

Filthy yet somewhat offputting
Bat your eyes and I roll mine
Held down on a hellbound omnibus
Take a hit from this behind

On the cross
Damnation by design

Revel in my goddamn heart and soul
Rhyme or reason are on my side
