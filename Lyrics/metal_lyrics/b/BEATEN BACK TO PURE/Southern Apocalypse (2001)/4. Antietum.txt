Stars and bars

Don't look into my eyes
You won't see the answer
The problem eats me alive
The inevitable day of judgement
Is coming soon

Mongrel class
Shot dead in their tracks
Fifth of Jack
Keeps me goin' on and on

Pissing on my neck
I seem to realize
It's burning my eyes
Burning all the way
I'm sorry but that's a brutal sign

My eyes..I know from breaking
Rollover somebody else
Holy Mother will soon hold human life
