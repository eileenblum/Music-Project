My words fall deaf on ears one hundred years and damned
Wavering in my own fucking dread
We've all made out by knife and ambience
Something for my head

Sheep shank for two

Repay, race towards the inner filth
Crossing over the line, bromide
Begone afterglow

Retard yet blazing towards the Sun
You know me, I still have to shine
Semirigid and thankless
Rot overnight
Myself force me tomorrow life
Now rest assured

Too good for me was it the other way
Ride on, ride on
My ol' lady gives me doom by night
I am thinkin'

I'm the King of Kings

Cripple june at night I lay down below
Full of lesions but I am the only way
Take it or leave it

Rebel flags razor blades
My soul swarn enemy
Rising ignore my eyes

Raging calamity lane
