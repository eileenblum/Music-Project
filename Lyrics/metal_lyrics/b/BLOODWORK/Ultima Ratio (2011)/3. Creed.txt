Inflict the world, the summoned joined
A pyre of lies in flames
Centuries are crumbling
In preservation's name

Newfound power, their solemn task
To save the weak in vain
Obedience and ignorance
Shall guide the future's way

So will you fall
Or will you follow?
The order of decline
Burn with us or burn in flesh
Burn within the sacred fire

Cause and effect
A crown of thorns within our hands
Apply the grand design
And no one shall suspect

Cause and effect
The dye is cast make no amends
Infectious deeds
Creed of murder from our hands

Dissection of society, all sentiments in vain
Rectified and bound in spite, a nation made of false disdain

Creed - will you follow?
Seed - of tears and sorrow
