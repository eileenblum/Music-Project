It takes a stillborn heart to be
What we have become
Solitary souls

It takes a closer look to see
Everything we've done
To break out of here

Left to ourselves, in a world of devolution
We'll never find absolution

As we run with the wolves tonight
In the sweetest of illusions
For all the things unsaid
Our soundless retribution

The world shall fall
All life cease to exist
A fading star
Shall light a tragedy to rest
In the night

In silent dreams, in deepest of illusions
We'll never find absolution

As we run with the wolves tonight
In the sweetest of illusions
For all the things unsaid
Our soundless retribution
