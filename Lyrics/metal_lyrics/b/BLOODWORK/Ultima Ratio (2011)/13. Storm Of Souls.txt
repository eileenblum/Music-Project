Sear life
Burning to set an example of faith
In death is bliss
In death lives revelation

Eyes turning black
Shriveled skin escaping the flesh
The cleansing flame
Torment is purification

A final gaze and its over
Another minute is all there's left
For the praise of the elder
A flaming symbol

Burn the lie
And wash away the sins
Steady as she goes
in a storm of souls

Light the fire
Turn the world to embers
Steady as she goes
In a storm of souls

Sear life
Vengeance in mercy
Existence forfeit
In death is bliss
In death naught's unforgiven

The sacrifice is due
Order come rise from the ashen remains
The fist will open
Peace shall reign again
