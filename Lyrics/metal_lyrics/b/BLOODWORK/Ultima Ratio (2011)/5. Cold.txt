What's left within ourselves
What have we become?
Sworn to an empty chest
Sworn to a blackened sun

Center of the west
To find the final solution
The triumph of the will

They control the mind
They control the masses
Purity to find
In blood and soil

What have we done
How could we fail to see the fading?
All of them gone
Now that we face the truth
We're cold inside

Come, come
and see the worth of wrath
All enemies shall fall
On our holy path

We are the chosen kind
We are the force of fate
Wipe out the weak of mind
Come and praise your hate

What's left within ourselves
What have we become?
Born in the serpent's nest
Born in the blackened sun

Center of the west
To find the final solution
The victory of faith

We became the wave
As we became the tide
No life unworth to save
In our endless pride
