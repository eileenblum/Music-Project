Divided and ever striving for new deception
United in common cause to spread the infection
Objects in motion in the waning tide
A new age a new flaw to seek and hide

As the moment fades to shadow
Our destiny's obscure

In fire burn out to the excess
Another night, another show
Another soil to bless
The winding path
Leading on throughout the night
A life in the shades
A life in constant fight

As the moment fades to shadow
As our desitny's in vain
And we keep on striving

Until we'll be leaving nowhere
Vanished in the shores of time
And we'll be leaving nowhere
Never to return
