Ever, everchanging tides of time
Running all around me
And still my wounds are bleeding

Ever, everlasting night divine
Can't believe the time gone by
Years have passed and
Still the wounds are bleeding

The moment ended too soon
The precious minutes
All wasted away
Forgotten and lost
As the path that lead astray

Again and again and again
The stories end remains the same
The cycle of ages
Keeps spinning endlessly

Again and again and again
The story's end remains the same
We suffer
The eternity syndrome
