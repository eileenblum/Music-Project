Eyes shut wide, and minds caught in oblivion
The vision is the surrogate of life

Dead inside
Senseless yet with hollow pride
Marching for mortality, into the void

The words to which we're tied
On bloodstained banners held in pride
As we march to the abyss
We see, ignorance is bliss

I reject the words being spoken
Refuse the deeds called for by the masses

Times divide, the final chapter opens
Drawn inside the stream, I march into the void
