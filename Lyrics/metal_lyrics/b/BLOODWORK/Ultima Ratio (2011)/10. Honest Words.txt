So there's no way avoiding war
Ensnared in void affection
No future anymore
We shut the doors of perception

Repaid with a motherfucking knife in the back
Degrade to take the last means
As we fade to black

Everything we built shall fall in ruin
As a matter of fact
No other way to react
As no return the favor

Everything we built shall fall

All the things that came to pass
Withered memories from the past
Don't you see our falling star
Take these words for what they are

And we failed to find
The thorns within our eyes
Better living blind
Than surrender to our lies

We won't hesitate
To find and desecrate
Everything to bar our way
Reroute to decay

Everything we built shall fall in ruin
