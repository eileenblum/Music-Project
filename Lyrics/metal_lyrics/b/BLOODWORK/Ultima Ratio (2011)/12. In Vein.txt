Injected
All cunning schemes devised
Now terminate in liquid
A fragile peace collapsing
In self-disdain

Infected
With thoughts the mind detests
Purpose without reason
Sanity's come to an end
A lesser self arising

Aspiration changed to flawed intention
Become addicted to a lethal attraction
Cannot live on with a life in dissection

Left my life all stained to seek detention
No reason, no affection
Shatter glass to escape the reflection

And the walls closing in on me
My innermost turned inside out
All I ever was
Became in vein

Hallucinations be me guide
To the world below
Excess and lunacy
The last threats to life
