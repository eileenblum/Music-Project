Join the ritual
Join the willing masses
Rise from what you are
Blood be thy benediction

Saints of flesh and bone
Saints of resurrection
Praise the chaos throne
Praise our imperfection

Worlds fade to nothing
In thy multitude

Ages - in the void
Pain - of dissolution
Eternity - in dark desire
Penance, for our sins

Frozen grace
Convey a new evolution
From time and space
Come retribution

And we hear
The prelude to a silent symphony
Rage and fear
Give in to the common enemy

See the sky divide, ancient gods arise
Serpent of rebirth, devour this twilight Earth

Worlds fade to nothing
In thy multitude

Join the ritual, join the willing masses
receive a deadly blessing, from the blackened sky

Saints of living stone, saints of resurrection
Praise the chaos throne, praise our imperfection
