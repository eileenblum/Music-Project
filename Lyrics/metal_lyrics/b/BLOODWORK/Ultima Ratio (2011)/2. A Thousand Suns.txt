"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"

As we struggle with our nightmares
And fail to calm the indignant mind
A hidden force born in despair
Shall change the fate of all our kind

Let the end justify the means, let the battle begin
With insentient will, we wield the hands of God

Revelation unsettles the Earth
The time of lordship is at hand
Repent, atone and perish in flames
Obey the nuclear command

We'll never find a way to turn the tide
The challenge of ages
As long as we won't realize the time has come
Transcend through gates of Hell
Cast open wide-inferno calling
In silent splendour a thousand suns shall rise
