Crave for chaos, crave for the undefined
The path leading nowhere, none else to find

No return, no one step back
The course is set, the rising sails in black

The call of the wild, deep inside
Our hearts
Belongs to no one

The gates of surrender, open wide
Within the shades of what remains

To the master of all designs, no one shall bow before thy throne of lies
Crave for chaos, crave for the undefined
We're bound to rule what we divide

Everything I'll ever own
I should have known
Never stills my heart, never stills my hunger

Nothing I had to atone
I should have known
And it leads my life through the lights and thunder

Life is but a chain of regress, a tumbling on the precipice
A test of resolve, to find the illusion
And take down these walls of pain
