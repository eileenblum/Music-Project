[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

A DEAD MANâS DAY IN A DEAD MANâS LIFE
EYES, STARING FROM A HOLLOW MIND
EMOTIONAL FLATLINE, THE END OF THE STRIFE
ALL CAUSE IS LOST
NO MORE, OUR HEARTS ARE BLACK
OUR SOULS CUT FROM THE FLESH
CONSUMED BY HATE
WEâRE FALLING IN DEMISE
DIVIDER,
COME TO SPLIT THIS WORLD APART
COME TO SEPERATE, ERRADICATE
ALL WHAT IS ONE
LORD OF LIES
THE SPEAKER IN THE VOID
IS CHANTING WORDS OF SPITE
ANGELS IN RAGE
AS FIRE FROM THE SKY
BURNING, IN FLAMING ANGUISH
FEEDING FROM OUR HATE
WE BECOME
COMATIC CHAOS UNLEASHED
AS THE ROAD KEEPS WINDING EVERMORE
WE LIVED A LIE
WAITING FOR THE TAKING UNDER
FALLING FROM AN UNFORGIVING SKY
INTO THE VOID
WITH OUR WINGS ALL TORN ASUNDER
WEâRE HELLBOUND
WE ARE HELLBOUND
