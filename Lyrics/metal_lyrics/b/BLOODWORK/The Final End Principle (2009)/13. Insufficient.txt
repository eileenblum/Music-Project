[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

BETRAYED, FALLEN FROM GRACE
AND CAST INTO THE SHADE
DENIED DELIVERANCE
DENIED THE RESTING GRAVE
BOUND TO AN UNSEEN FORCE
ALIFE WITHOUT A CAUSE
UNFORGIVEN, DIM AND BLEAK
THE INSUFFICIENT SHALL SLEEP
AND IâM FADING INTO GREY
IâM FADING INTO NOTHINGNESS
CANâT I GIVE IT ALL AWAY?
THIS WORTHLESS EXCUSE FOR EXISTENCE
BLIND, EYES OPEN WIDE
A GAZE SO BROKEN FROM INSIDE
ENCASED IN ROTTING FLESH
LOST IN MORPHEUS MIND
SHATTERED THOUGHTS PASSING BY
FRAGMENTS OF A SHATTERED LIFE
NO DIGNITY IN HERE
INSIDE MY SILENT SPHERE
THE FINAL MEMORIES DRIFTING AWAY
INTO THE VOID TO RISE WITHIN
WITH NO HOPE LEFT
AND NOTHING TO SAY AGAIN
