[music: Nikko, lyrics: David]

NO TIME TO WASTE JUST FACTS TO FACE.
IâLL NEVER GET YOUR POINT OF VIEW!
YOUR EYES BEEN CLOSED BY YOUR RAGE.
DONâT TRUST THE VOICE WITHOUT A FACE.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO CURB YOUR NEEDS?
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE DEVILâS BREED?
BURIED IN THOUGHTS AND LOST IN GREED.
YOU FOLLOW A LEADER CANâT RESIST.
DISAPPEAR! WITHOUT A TRACE.
YOUR SOUL DESCENTS INTO DARKEST SHADOW.
UPGRADE YOUR LIFE SURROUNDED BY DEATH.
PASSED BY THE BURDEN WHICH A BLOODLINE CONTAINS.
SET BACK TO RESURRECT COME BACK TO GET RESPECT!
COLLAPSED BELOW THIS PRESSURE.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO CURB YOUR NEEDS?
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE DEVILâS BREED?
CROSSING THE DEADLINE TASTED THE BLOODWINE!
ANOTHER TIME!
SET BACK TO RESURRECT COME BACK TO GET RESPECT!
COLLAPSED BELOW THIS PRESSURE.
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO CURB YOUR NEEDS?
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE THE DEVILâS BREED?
CROSSING THE DEADLINE TASTED THE BLOODWINE!
ANOTHER TIME! HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE ALIVE?
