[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

SO WEâVE COME TO THE DIVIDING LINE
AS THE UNWANTED GUEST
DISORDER RISING IN THE GRAND DESIGN
WITH SHEER LIFE PUT TO THE TEST
IF WE COULD BE
THE WAY WE WERE
IN OUR OWN CREATION
SO MANY TIMES
ITâS OURSELVES THAT WE SURRENDER
IF WE COULD BE
THE WAY WE WERE
BEFORE THE GREAT STAGNATION
AS DESPERATE FOOLS
WE WATCH THE SILENT REVOLUTION
SO WEâVE COME TO THE DIVIDING LINE
CONDEMMNED TO RUST AND CORRODE
SWORN TO THE BREAKING OF THE PARADIGM
A SIDEWAY LEFT ON THE ROAD
IF WE COULD BE
THE WAY WE WERE
BEYOND OUR SELF DAMNATION
AS DESPERATE FOOLS
WE WATCH THE SILENT REVOLUTION
