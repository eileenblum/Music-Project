[music: Nikko, lyrics: David, Nikko]

ANOTHER STEPâS DONE TO YOUR DESCENT
ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE END
YOU FIND YOURSELF IN ANOTHER MANâS HAND
NO RIGHT TO RULE, CONTROL AND TO COMMAND
FROM THE SILENT HALLS OF RUST
TO THE IDOLS TURNED TO DUST
LEAVE YOUR REASON TO YOUR RAGE
FREE THE MONSTER FROM THE CAGE
GONE DEMONIC â STAINED UPON THE SOUL
EMBRACED BY DARKNESS CLOSING IN
LET YOUR WEAKNESS DROWN IN SIN
AND RAISE YOUR HATE
THE LOSS OF MEMORY, THIS UNUSUAL THOUGHTS
A RAGING MINDWAR SHOWS, THAT YOU NEED ME
THIS COEXISTENCE IS NOT MEANT TO BE
BUT AS I SEE, WE SHARE THE SAME TIME
FROM THE SILENT HALLS OF RUST
TO THE IDOLS TURNED TO DUST
LEAVE YOUR REASON TO YOUR RAGE
FREE THE MONSTER FROM THE CAGE
GONE DEMONIC â STAINED UPON THE SOUL
A RESTLESS LIFE YOU CANâT PRETEND
A HOLLOWED ENEMY, YOU CANâT DEFEND
THIS FIGHT YOU CANNOT WIN,
CAUSE NO ONE KNOWS THE MISERY YOUâRE IN
FROM THE SILENT HALLS OF RUST
TO THE IDOLS TURNED TO DUST
LEAVE YOUR REASON TO YOUR RAGE
FREE THE MONSTER FROM THE CAGE
FROM THE SILENT CALL WITHIN
TO SALVATION FOUND IN SIN
LEAVE YOUR REASON TO YOUR RAGE
FREE THE MONSTER FROM THE CAGE
