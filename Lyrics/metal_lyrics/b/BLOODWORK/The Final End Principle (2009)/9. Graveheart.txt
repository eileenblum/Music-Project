[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

AS NATIONS FORM THE GREAT DISASTER
AS CHAOS FLOODS THE MIND
ASHES ON THE MORNING AFTER
THE EYELESS GUIDES THE BLIND
TORN BEYOND RECOGNITION
THE BLOODY HAMMER REIGNS
DEATH SQUAD ON THE DAILY MISSION
EVER STRIVE TO FILL THE TRAINS
AND WE
SEE HOW THEY TREAD THEIR WAY
MASSES COME TO RAISE THE MASTER
BLACK SUN IS BURNING ME
ASHES ON THE MORNING AFTER
CAST BODIES DOWN THE GRAVE
MASSES COME TO RAISE THE MASTER
NOT NEW, NOT BRAVE
ASHES ON THE MORNING AFTER
REAP THE ROTTEN SEED NOW
FROM THE FLAMING GROUND
DEEP WITHIN THE BLOODLINE
LET TRUE STRENGTH BE FOUND
INNOCENCE IS NO EXCEPTION
BEING BORN IS NO EXCUSE
RISE FROM IMPERFECTION
CASKET HEARTS
AS NATIONS FORM THE GREAT DISASTER
AS CHAOS FLOODS THE MIND
BURN THE LIVING CARCASS FASTER
VICTIM TO THE GRAVEHEART KIND
TORN BEYOND RECOGNITION
THE BLOODY HAMMER REIGNS
DEATH SQUAD ON THE DAILY MISSION
EVER STRIVE TO FILL THE TRAINS
