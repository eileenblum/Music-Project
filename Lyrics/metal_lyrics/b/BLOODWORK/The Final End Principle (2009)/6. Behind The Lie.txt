[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

WRAPPED IN SOLEMN, RECKLESS PRIDE
STUCK IN THE NATION OF SUICIDE
CONSUMED AND HOLLOWED FROM INSIDE
TORN APART AT THE GREAT DIVIDE
STRAIGHT TO THE ABYSS OF DUSK
TO FIND RESEMBLANCE
WITH NOTHING LEFT TO TRUST, BUT ISOLATION
WILL YOU SACRIFICE YOURSELF TO SAVE ME
WILL YOU LET IT GO TO GET BACK
SO MUCH SUBDUED BEHIND THE LIE
WILL YOU SACRIFICE YOURSELF TO SAVE ME
WILL YOU FOLLOW ME THROUGH FIRE
TO NOTHINGNESS BEHIND THE LIE
CONSUME, OBEY AND PROCREATE
A MASS INCLINED TO DEGENERATE
SENSES CEASE TO COMPREHEND
THE INEVITABLE SOUL-DESCEND
STRAIGHT TO THE ABYSS OF DUSK
WITHOUT RESILIENCE
FIND NOTHING LEFT TO TRUST, BUT ISOLATION
