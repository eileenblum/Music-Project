[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

WAKE UP, ANOTHER DAY IN EXILE
ANOTHER DAY IN HELL
SUFFOCATING IN SOMATIC DISTRESS
STAND UP, AND BE PUSHED DOWN TO GET UP
TO CRAWL UPON YOUR KNEES
THROUGH A SEA OF BLOODY KNIFES
THE LAST CONNECTION FAILED
SENTENCED TO SELFCONFINEMENT
DONE A BITTER TRADE, EMOTIONS FADE
IN DARKEST SHADOW
LIVING LIKE AN OUTCAST DRIFTING IN TIME
STANDING AS LAST WITHIN THE LINE
GRASP THE ONE THING TO BE TRUE
THE STONE THAT DROWNS THE LAST OF YOU
LIVING LIKE AN OUTCAST DRIFTING IN TIME
STANDING AS LAST WITHIN THE LINE
FORGET, WHAT YOU WAS TOLD BE TRUE
LET THIS STONE DROWN THE LAST OF YOU
FEEL THE BURDEN IN YOUR CHEST
CEASE DEFENSE NOW BE AT REST
DARK AND DEEP SHALL BE THY FALL
IN HOPLESS WATERS SILENT CALL
