[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

EVERY DAY IS BUT A STRIFE IN THE WEST
AS YET ANOTHER MAN IS VICTIM
TO THE CAUSE OF THE QUEST
NO NEED FOR REASON, NO NEED FOR PROOF
GULTY, CASE CLOSED
IN A SELFMADE-TRUTH
THEYâVE TAKEN MY LIFE
AND TORN IT INSIDE OUT
THEYâVE TAKEN MY LIFE
AND LEFT ME HERE TO ROT
LOCKED UP AND STORED AWAY
ANOTHER NICE DAY
DOWN IN CAMP X-RAY
CAUGHT INSIDE WALLS OF GREY
ANOTHER NICE DAY
DOWN IN CAMP X-RAY
AGAIN THE DRUG IS TAKING SIDE-EFFECTS
FEELS LIKE LOOSING CONTROL
AS THEIR GOD WEEPING ON THE CRUCIFIX
I BEG TO SAVE OUR SOULS
SAVE OUR SOULS
EVERY DAY NOW IS A REPEAT OF THE LAST
AS THEY RAISE THE VERY DOUBTS RISEN IN THE PAST
SO STAND DOWN AND LET THE FORCES OF SPITE
PROTECT YOUR KIN
AND PRACTICE WHAT THEY FIGHT
