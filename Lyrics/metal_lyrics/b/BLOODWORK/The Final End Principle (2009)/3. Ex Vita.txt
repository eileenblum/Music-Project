[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

CHANGE, THE ULTIMATE CHANGE COMES
IN TERROR FROM BEHIND THE FACE
ALL BRIDGES BURNED
JOIN IN ON THE PATH OF THE LOST
ONE LIFE. ONE HEART, ONE SOUL
VERGING ON THE EDGE OF VOID
AS SHADES WE TREAD
OM THE PATH OF THE LOST
AND THEY FADE
TO THE UNFORGIVING ABYSS OF THE NETHERWORLD
AND THEY DEGRADE
FROM DUST TO DUST
WITH THE ASHEN AVALANCHE
TO FALL
NEVERMORE
THEY LEFT SO LONG AGO
IN SWEET SUBSIDENCE
CHANGE, THE ULTIMATE CHANGE COMES
AS BITTER RAIN TO SACRED SOIL
ALL GROUND SHALL BURN
WITH THE PATH OF THE LOST
SO SHALT THOU FEED ON DEATH
THAT FEEDS ON MAN
WITH DEATH ONCE DEAD
THEREâS NO MORE DYING THEN
