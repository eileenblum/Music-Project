[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

TIME IS RUNNING OUT NOW
THE ALTERATION HAS BEGUN
NO CHANCE TO STEM THE TIDE
FAR TOO LATE, THE DAMAGE IS DONE
BETRAYED BY FLESH AND BLOOD
REBELLION AT GROUND ZERO
DRAGGED UNWILLINGLY
INTO A WAR WITHOUT A HERO
ITS STARTING TO REACH OUT NOW
A DEADLY GRASP FROM THE INSIDE
STANDING ON THE EDGE
GOT THE RIGHT TO LIVE DENIED
FADING INTO TWILIGHT
BOUND TO WATCH THE OWN DECAY
CAST DOWN FROM THE LIVING THRONE
AND CAST ALL LIFE AWAY
WAITING FOR THE CERTAIN END TO COME
UNTIL THE COMBATS DONE
ALL THATâS LEFT TO DO IS TO GIVE IN
TO THE ENEMY (WITHIN)
