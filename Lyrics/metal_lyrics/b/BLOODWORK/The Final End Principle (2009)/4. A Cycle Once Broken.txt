[music &amp; lyrics: Nikko]

REBORN AGAIN IN AFFLICTION
SO MUCH LEFT BACK IN ANOTHER LIFE
CAUGHT IN THE FANGS OF ADDICITON
WE FIND OURSELVES TO INCINERATE IN FIRE,
WIDE AWAKE IN FIRE
BURNING FROM WITHIN
ITâS SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL
AN EIGHTFOLD PRICE TO PAY
THE LEGACY OF THE ULTIMATE SOUL
IN SILENCE UNSPOKEN
DOWN THE ROAD, IF WE DONâT DIGRESS
A CYCLE ONCE BROKEN
DISCOVERING THE FORM OF EMPTINESS
DOMINATION OF THE BLIND
LOCKED UP AND LEFT IN A FORTRESS OF FLESH
THE ASCENDING MIND
CONDEMNED BY FATE INTO UNACCOUNTED LIES,
WIDE AWAKE IN A SEA OF LIES
AWAKE TO SEE A WORLD IN PAIN
AWAKE, YET STILL ASLEEP AND
DREAMING ENDLESSLY
