In light unapproachable
In the darkness of mystery sits enthroned
The greatest KING - Lord of order and chaos
Who can know Him?
Who can perceive His thoughts?
For He sees all and all He sees is His domain

Forged He His kingdom
From His thought came all that is
Shaped on the anvil of His will
His hammer was His simple outspoken word

Out of the completeness of solitude
Came the desire for something beyond
The longing for communion with others
And with the desire so came the will

So He made the stars flames to light the night
And chose one out of billions to call the sun

Fashioned a world of splendour
For His new begotten kin
Thus purpose is seen in every
Known and unknown thing
For perfection of joy for His people

The desire to grow beyond
The confines of mere mortality
Is created henceforth by His will

To commune with the source of creation
Is to create a thing of utter beauty
A simple moment in a finite span of time
Yet within is contained all the weight of eternity

Forged He His kingdom...

And to be one in the everflowing
Stream of His SPIRIT
Beyond the seas of infinity
