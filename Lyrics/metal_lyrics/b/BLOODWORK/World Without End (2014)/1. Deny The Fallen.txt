Cast down in utter defeat
He fell to this earth
Weakened but not destroyed
For his doom would come...
After his use had reached and end

A choice was he
To be rejected or embraced
To be offered to the sons of men
To illustrate their freedom

Through cunning lies
He deceived human kind
Believing his lies as they chose
They freely gave him dominion
Which we in our folly continue to do!

Does this show great power
That he deceived us?
Does this act command respect?
You blind fools!
It only shows our grasping ambition
Futile, since God already gave man dominion
We barter it all away
At the cost of our souls!

The oppressor is none but the deceiver:
Never our ally, always scheming vilest treachery
Thus I deny his filthy, disgusting, damnable name:
"Defeated art thou by the great LIBERATOR!"
No more shalt thou rise!

No more shall you twist our faith into chains
For the great GOD of old spilled His blood
To free us from your domination
Mercy: since it was we who
Surrendered to you at the start!

In His strength shall we reign with Him
While you burn, burn forever, reviled one!
