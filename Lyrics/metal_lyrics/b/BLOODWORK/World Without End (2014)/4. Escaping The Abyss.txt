A cold sharp blade
Warm candle light flickers
Lost in the caverns of depression
I drift into spiritual realms
Demons screaming for pain
Unending voices pounding
Weak and despairing
I offer my flesh

Burning metal one with my cold skin
Rushing pain sears my senses
Deep release
Loyalty pledged through sacrifice
Invasion of body, mind and soul
Awaking to life, departing this world
I join them and pass into the void

Relentless cycle, wounding deeper
Addicted to damage
Self revulsion
I cry to my LORD to break the chains

Powerless to resist when evil calls
Surveying my scarred flesh
Praying to CHRIST
To release me
I cannot overcome the demons I have called
I have called...

Love answers with liberation
Soft light dispersing darkness
My flesh restored
A sacrifice to the LAMB
Peace envelopes within
Sheltering in brilliant light
Demons denied
Their voices silenced
My torment over, I walk in freedom
My life regained as I pass
Through the darkness
