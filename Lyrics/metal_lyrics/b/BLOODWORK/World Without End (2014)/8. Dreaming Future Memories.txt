By lust ensnared, by innocent blood extricated
I am welcomed into the hall of murderers

Dreaming future memories
So shocking: covered with blood and dirt
My dead children in my arms
Amongst the graves embracing those
Too late to protect

Her deceit - my selfishness
Combine to spawn a torment that lingers
A brutal reality created in
The most intimate of moments

Making divine decisions but
Unable to deal with the consequences
Crushed by my will, beaten by my own weakness

The passage of time cannot replace what's lost
Aeons could not erase the shame
Guilt washed away by the blood of GOD
The weight of memory remains
But as these years pass
Wounds opened by my own hand
Are healed by undeserved forgiveness

Though some may condemn
The blood on my hands
Their pride shall be their undoing
For I answer to Him above
Aware of my wrong

Souls can never be destroyed
A distant celestial reunion
To heal completely the sins of my past
To cleanse all the filth of my deeds

By lust ensnared
By holy blood extricated
I am welcomed into the new city of GOD
