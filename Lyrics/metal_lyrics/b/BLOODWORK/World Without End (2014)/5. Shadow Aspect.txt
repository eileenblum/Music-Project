Cursed and bound to this earth defiled
In chains of animal instinct
Vision focused by force on the present moment
These chains forged by hell
Each moment a link

Repeating animal acts until the moments end
When worms of mercy devour
The carcass that's imprisoned
A slave race, neither name nor face
Potential left to rot
In the filth of the slave pits

Yet in the darkest corner of the mind

The master lurks, proud and evil
Urging us to a promise of freedom untamed
Grand vistas of sated lusts and of desires
Beyond existence
The lie of life unrestrained

Flattering ourselves that we are in control
The master steers us towards
The death we abhor
Aspect of shadows deep within the mind:
The dark side of our nature we try to ignore

Behold the cycle repeat itself
A sentence of self-worship punctuated by death
Am I the hero or the villain
In this tale of my own emptiness?

But the lure of shadow aspects call
Is the proof of its bane
The need for life beyond this corrupted view
Exists because it is there to
Be found beyond the chains

A glimpse of a SAVIOUR and a life
With no chains
