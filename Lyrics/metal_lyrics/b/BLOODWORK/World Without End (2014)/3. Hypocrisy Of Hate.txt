Who are we to you?
What do lives mean to you?
The stench of humanity
Assaulting your senses

People are worthless filth
Drowning in the misery
Of our own making
What possible hope is there for us?

If we are as pointless as you say
And not worth saving
What does your misanthropic
Thinking matter?

Hypocrisy of hate

If all humanity
Is doomed to destruction
Are you not part of the problem?
If all humanity is doomed...

You should hate your own life...
Lead the way!!!
