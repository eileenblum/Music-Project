Gaze long into my eyes
The serpent forever banished
Light shines forth
Life from the blood of the covenant
Light shines forth

Hollowness dwells in my spirit
Demons circle my sphere

Negative colours paint across my mind

Staring across wastelands of decay
The end in sight
My strength is gone
Sobbing racks my body
Amongst chaos I cling to hope
The end in sight

The light burns in my mind
Immortal life - the Healer

In the distance the exit
Carry me through death

Anoint me
Cover me with the oil of life
My spirit aches to be with You

I will burn bright for You
Bear your light in blackest darkness
Keeper and SAVIOUR
Lover of my soul

Nothing can separate us...
Faces to the sky
Coming on the clouds of heaven
Final victory is ours
