A world shared, but worlds apart
Standing in divided unity
One purpose and goal
Life and that in abundance

In JESUS a path to freedom
Found by some
The church a symbol of tyranny
For others

This is what divides
Engulfed by chaos
But the truth will set free
Embraced by light

An eternity divides
The chasm yawns wide

The CHRIST of history
Brought every mountain low
The CHRIST of history
Raised every valley

A voice to expose tyranny
To raise the oppressed
He lives to draw you to hope
He died to bridge the great divide

There is no difference between us
Of our own making
His blood will unite
Those who hunger
For freedom and life

We seem the same
But blood has cleansed us
We can share eternity
His blood unites us in strength

Now and forever
