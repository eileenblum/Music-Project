Spirit of cleansing, wash my soul
Spirit of life, you bring tranquility, you are joy
From the well of everlasting pour out your peace
Completeness is found in you
With you I am one with creation
With you all my desires are met
With you I fly to the throne of the King of kings
Burn in me, consuming me, overflow in me
Carry me away to the highest heavens,
be my guide and protector

In you I live,
In you I will die
In you I will exist for all eternity

By your blood, we have life
In your wounds we are healed
In your death we are clean
Nothing more for us to do

Bloodshed, divine gift to us
Oh bloodshed

Oh my master,
wash me in your,
in your precious blood
in your precious blood

Divine bloodshed
Divine bloodshed
Divine bloodshed
