What makes love so powerful,
that you might mind me
even to give your, life to love as you do?
Man to man is so difficult
My mind cannot fathom the depth of your compassion...

Yet I walk and still live
You are so wondrous to me
But temporal is my mind
And this is almost blinding
Your word is all I need
Still I stand and look to see
And yet I walk and still live
And yet I walk and still live

In your appointed time revelation unfolds
Its your love that's the key,
can this love belong to me?
Faith knows it dwells in me
Father why are you so gracious
That you Almighty love me

Yet I walk and I live
You are so
wondrous to me
But temporal is my mind
And this is almost blinding
Your word is all I need
Still I stand
and look to see
And yet I walk and still live
And yet I walk and still live
