Feel the howling wind
Ignore the screams of the evening
Exhale and then swallow the caps within
The path has been well marked
Into the hills you are stumbling
The mountain occupies new residents

Under starlight they emerge visible
Stay and catch a glimpse of the Moon-Eyed People

They're resurrecting a wall
And glow their skin like magic
They know you're watching and now invite you in

Their wall echoes coming battle cries
Their faces reflect doom
They push you up to the southern sky
To the clouds and break you through
I fly, I fly
