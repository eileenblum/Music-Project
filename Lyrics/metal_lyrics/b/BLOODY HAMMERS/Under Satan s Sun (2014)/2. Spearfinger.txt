Hunter born
Pursue the weak
No remorse to be gave
Face adorned with stains of blood
From the lives she's claimed
Crows departing frantically
Don't make the slightest sound
Take your cover she's drawing near
As thunder shakes the ground

Turn and forsake
Save every soul Spearfinger takes
Hide in dismay
Save every soul Spearfinger takes now

Shroud of fog
Flesh of stone
Master of disguise
Piercing flesh
Velocity
Her feast is your demise
Hounds are howling frantically
Don't make the slightest sound
Take your cover she's drawing near
As thunder shakes the ground
