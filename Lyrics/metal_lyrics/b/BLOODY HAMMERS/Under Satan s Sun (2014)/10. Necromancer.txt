She'll take away all of your will to live
Establish madness nothing left to give
Drinking venom from your reservoir
Now you're bitten by the ailing whore

Hallucinations haunting every turn
Twisted keys playing through your nocturne
The flickering combustible gaslight
The necromancer breaks your will tonight

Feel the presence of impending doom
All the ones you trampled now exhumed
The undead bringing an appetite
The Necromancer breaks your will tonight
