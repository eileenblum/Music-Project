Leave no example unseen
Did you not fantasize on what you're supposed to be
The end is coming down
The end is crashing down with paralyzed emergency

If you never scream like you did before and if you never heard the screeching last alarm
If you never cry like you did before and if you never heard the screeching last alarm

The wind returns all remains
The living dead are all that's left for you to entertain
The fires are scorching you dear
The letter disembowelled but it's all that's left for you here

It follows behind you
In the corridor black
It wants you the real you
In the corridor black
It cuts you it tears you
In the corridor black
It heals you it breathes you
In the corridor black
