The manic priest is waiting but my head is saying it's alright, it's ok
Everything is wrong so why behave
The manic priest is waiting but inside you
It's alright it's ok
Shock and shame is so far out of date

Blame is left on all of you to load your guns and tell the truth
Leave me here
Burning with you
Blame is left on all of you to load your guns and tell the truth
Leave me here
Burning with you

Welcome to the horror show
Once you're in you cannot be let go
And if you ever try again just so you know
I'll be here
I'll be watching you
Inside your horror show

The frantic saint is pacing while your heart is racing
For the end of the strange conversations with a dying age
The frantic saint is pacing but inside you
It's alright it's ok
Shock and shame is so far out of range

Answer me I need to know
Who's the one that you will love 
Who's the one who'll see you're never left alone
