Destruction comes at the end
There's a southern place we can descend
A stomping ground that cannot be out shined

No threat of an oncoming wrath
When you're traveling the left hand path
Detestable over all mankind

I don't wanna let anyone stop you here
I just want you to perish and disappear

Under Satan's sun
Poisoning you like a venom
Let's make this memory sublime
Under Satan's sun
And burning for you like a demon
Into the land of the divine

The best time you'll have being scared
All the gratification of a nightmare
Designed to never let you down

You're never satisfied anyhow
Here's all the madness that you will allow
Petrified and furthermore spellbound
