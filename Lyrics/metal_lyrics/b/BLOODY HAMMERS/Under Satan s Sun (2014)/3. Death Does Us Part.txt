It's our last stand together
All of our crimes have run us down
Justice shall be found
There is no chance between
This cliff and all those loaded guns
Nowhere left to run

With one step it ends here
This mortal coil we'll depart
Together
Death does us part

For years one breath one voice
Two spirits indivisible
Grim but beautiful
It's one last trip together
A kiss before our final plunge
Blissfully succumb

With one step it ends here
This mortal coil we'll depart
Our earthly work fulfilled
I'll see you in hell for a new start
Together
Death does us part
