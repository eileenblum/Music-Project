He said as they held his trial
All that they're speaking are lies
I never murdered that child
But they still hung him high

He vowed they would pay the devil each day for the words testified
The soul of an innocent man doesn't rest as tears flowed from his eyes

Vengeance is mine all your days you will see
I will return for you all
But until then I will curse upon the
That dead man's shadow on the wall

Crowds came from miles around
To see the shame of the town
The citizens braced for the spirits advance
And Satan's wrath as he planned
