There's an escalation in your world gone black
There's a numbing inside you and now there is no turning back
In your isolation your fear is wearing thin
There's a prayer that's suspended in air for your final repent

But when you close your eyes you send your thoughts away
You have taken your daydreams and traded for years of decay
And a chill of a frightening memory kept calls your name and runs you through
But like all other martyrs that come before you
You need for the blood that you see
In your catastrophe

There's a mutilation that can circumvent
In the morgue for emotions your pain sets your rigor mortis
While the hearts are breaking in the heaven sent
You have given up on your conclusion of what it all meant
