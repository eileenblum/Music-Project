Lead me to our only place
Dressed for opening time
Show me bleeding where my love
Burns you breathing fire
The funeral is waking now from the summer's kiss
Damn the heavens for your roses are growing wilder now

Empty all your pockets now the show is opening soon
The crowd is roaring and their fists are thrown up in the air
Lay down woman don't be scared
The murderer you face is tired of living but only kills the living that time hates

Bloodletting on the naked kiss
Bloodletting on the kiss

Credits speak a thousands words but are rarely read
Your dress flows black velvet when it's
It's dropping to its death
Your head speaks vulgarities on your dying breath
Left your tranquillity for those who know you best

Bloodletting on the naked kiss
Bloodletting on the kiss
