At your inquisition you were starting to show
All your menacing ambitions conceived not very long ago
On this day of judgment we will evaluate your crimes
Your heresy has brought you to this jury of the noble and sublime

You curse the light of day to never return
It's clear to see your indifference and you never will learn
Your trial is over and your rights are really none of my concern
So stoke the fire and let her burn

As we melt away immoral skin
The path of evil trampled by the angry gods within
Let this execution show the children of the damned
The crowd behold the rest of the wicked and another moral stand

No remorse for the wicked
