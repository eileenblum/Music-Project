Inside the stressed photograph
Then captured my fall into you
One million treads trampled and torn apart
Affinity discontinued

One last crash is imminent
A rage in the clouds as we all sink
When faced with the world the whole thing just seems like a wreck
I turn my back now return to the walking extinct

I will watch all the lights come alive
Discover me breathless and dropped to the ground with all the dead stars
A run to a crawl channelling the lost and found
Here comes the light
I'm dreaming as fast as I can
