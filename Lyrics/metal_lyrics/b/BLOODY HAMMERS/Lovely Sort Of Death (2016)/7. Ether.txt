Arriving in this haze
Set the mind ablaze
All the hatred obscured by the numbing
Words can't leave the tongue escape what I've become
Hanging down where the gods are slumming

Now I've disappeared
With nothing left to feel
Skilled amnesiac
The real world fades to black

Wonder who can see or even what that means
Through the turnstiles and turned loose inside
Proposition death with foaming bated breath
The mirror shows someone unoccupied

Now I've disappeared
With nothing left to feel
Skilled amnesiac
The real world fades to black

Chemical euphoria
Fatal anaesthesia
Repercussions are the same
Finally going down in flames
