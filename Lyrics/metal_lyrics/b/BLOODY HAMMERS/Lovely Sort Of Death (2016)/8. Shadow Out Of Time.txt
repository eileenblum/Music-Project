In the stillness of a day dreaming to the blazing sun
Unbeknownst I soon will be deep in the cosmic cauldron
Evil incoming now I will be their window to Earth
Without warning now should I begin to fear the worst

Now the host has settled in I'm full controlled and occupied
Hearing voices see strange worlds flickering all through my mind
All while the citizens beware my seemingly madness
They convince the clergyman that I'm clearly possessed

Shadow out of time
