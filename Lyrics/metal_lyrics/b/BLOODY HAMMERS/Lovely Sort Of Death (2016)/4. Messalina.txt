An execution is looming
The empire lives and breathes control
Your scandals stand disappointing
Legend will tell the heads you've rolled

For all the villainous cruelty
Stained by a river of blood
Depravity leads you guilty
Fall on the sword Messalina

The empress of the harlots
A malicious object of desire
In the palace of the flawless
Promiscuity ruled by iron

For all the villainous cruelty
Stained by a river of blood
Depravity leads you guilty
Fall on the sword Messalina
