In this coffin armor I await my game of fate
The noise from all the bloodthirsty spectators irate
Just ahead my adversary aggressing rapidly toward me
In the collision there's a victor that arises from the debris

On a cloudy autumn afternoon I'm taking an infinite gaze to the sun
Back against the ground the crowd erupts but I'm taking
An infinite gaze to the sun

My slayer soaks the praises
From the legally enslaved
As they prepare my couch of libitina and a grave
The roaring fades to silence
The shock subsides to tranquilness
They rake the sand and disregard my final request

If anyone out there can read my mind
Please ask your god to favor my soul as I leave all you behind
I'll request amnesty for all my crimes and beg to be
The chosen to oversee your earthly decline

On a cloudy autumn afternoon I'm taking an infinite gaze to the sun
Back against the ground the crowd erupts but I'm taking
An infinite gaze to the sun
