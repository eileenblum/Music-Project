You're carrying all the oppression hollow and vain
Deep in the wound of the massacre | cut the pain away
You're lonely in heaven but welcomed in hell
Will tears deepen rivers | you never can tell
I live to see your sorrow disappear

Clip your wings and watch them burn
Eliminate that misery
Enemies at every turn
Let all their blood wash over me

Into the great depths you fall in solace to flames
High on the throne of invincible | no regrets remain
As proud as deceit on your face you adorn
Your halo's becoming a tight crown of thorns
We'll never see them overcome your fear

Clip your wings and watch them burn
Eliminate that misery
Enemies at every turn
Let all their blood wash over me
