The Peace of Mind You Find Comes with a price to pay sometimes as every moment is a strange one 

Live fast and make it clear, expect your final chime to hear as every promise becomes broken 

The choir in your head are singing to exalt the dead that have become exaggeration 

Transit Begins 
Contempt within 
Until the end 

Each manic passing day keeps the creator far away as every picture tells repulsion 

Transit Begins 
Contempt within 
Until the end 

Iâve told you far too late 
Malignant spirits plan your fate 
Now every moment becomes stranger 

Envision the light through the clouds as you follow your rapture 
Recite the new scripture aloud as the transit begins 

This setting is hard to tell but by the sulfur that you smell this must be your new tragic home ground 

Envision the light through the clouds as you follow your rapture 
Recite the new scripture aloud as the transit begins
