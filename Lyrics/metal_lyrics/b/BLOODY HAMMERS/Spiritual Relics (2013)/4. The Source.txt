Blood on the walls and a furious fire 
Itâs been a competitive love and desire 
Iâm sitting still but Iâm just getting colder 
Ice in my veins and a lump in my throat 

Iâve been invited by the light of the moon 

Time and time I gave in and all you want is more thatâs not what I came here for 

But this time I didnât give in and I feel no remorse now that iâve cut off the source 

Ecstasy comes like a worm through the brain 
Slightly surcums to the fist and the pain 
Not breaking silence but i destroyed the order 
Sweat pores and blood fills the void of the rain 

I feel like iâve left you silent 
Iâve already lived and died once for you
