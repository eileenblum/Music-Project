There's no escaping the apprehension
In the meantime you can try
To accept the ones who follow
Make a common sacrifice

On the seasonal Sabbath day
You parted with the worries you couldn't hide
Every telling star to follow
Destiny set aside

Fear no evil
Fear no evil

Circle the flames in vespers
Higher and higher they go
Forever to the ritual
Spirits here bestowed

Fear no evil
Fear no evil

Follow the path to find
The deadly life you want
Your final breath has been exhaled
But eternally you haunt

Recognizing constantly
Exactly what you are
Fear no evil
As you fly into the stars
