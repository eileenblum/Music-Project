In daylight we prepare
Check all the locks leave no windows bare
Cause you know we must absolutely sure

All the lights go down
In this petrified and forsaken town
We side with caution from the impure

It's the time of much dismay
Stay very still as you kneel and pray
The witching hour is upon you

And if you really stay
Take warning and don't lose your way
The witching hour is upon you

The night is growing long
But we keep our faith and we're staying strong
We'll wait until we're saved by the sun

The evil that became
Never look their way never speak their name
A whisper is as loud as a drum

It's the time of much dismay
Stay very still as you kneel and pray
The witching hour is upon you

And if you really stay
Take warning and don't lose your way
The witching hour is upon you
