In the dark you can see
There's a close entity
Feels any moment you could be
Meeting your destiny

You're frozen so still and all you can feel
Is a presence that's aware
All so unreal it sends a chill
To yourself you say a prayer

It's been living in the darkest corner of your mind but it
Don't breathe a word
All the fears that bind you it surely will find but it
Don't breathe a word

Anders Manga: everything
