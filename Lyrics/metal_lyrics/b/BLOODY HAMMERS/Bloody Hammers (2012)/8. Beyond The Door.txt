When evil speaks not everyone listens
The opportunity slips by the deaf blind and dumb
Been falling deep in fear with a pure addictive drug
And it pulls me under seeps into my blood

Evil waits beyond the door
And a poisoned soul I've waited for
Evil waits beyond the door
I know I can't be coming here no more

It shadows me under its demon wings
Resurrecting reckless abandon everything
Crashing accelerating bleeds into a dream
Terrorizing gratifying all through the screams

Evil waits beyond the door
And a poisoned soul I've waited for
Evil waits beyond the door
I know I can't be coming here no more
