When the painful hunger returns abruptly
Tears right through you and makes you numb
Choose a victim but very wisely
Take a note on what you've become

When the wind is freezing but doesn't phase you
Frost your veins like it did before
When the mirror doesn't recognize you
When you can't walk through any door

How's it feel to know you're going to live forever
How's it feel to know you won't grow one day older

When the lost ones find you and try to follow
Ask to find all your truths untold
Turn away as they know the evil
They're all broken and their souls are sold

How's it feel to know you're going to live forever
How's it feel to know you won't grow one day older

Please understand and say goodbye to the sun
Please understand and say goodbye to the sun
Please understand and say goodbye to the sun
Please understand and say goodbye to the sun
