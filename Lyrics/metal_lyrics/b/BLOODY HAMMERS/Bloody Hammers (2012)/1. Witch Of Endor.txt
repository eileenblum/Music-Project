In this chamber flooded silence
Just my thoughts left to echo
Looking toward a bringer of war
Clearly intending my overthrow

Ignoring divine instructions
Souls being released by my sword
Guidance from above departed
All my questions returning ignored

Yeah solution is raise the dead
Find the conjuring witch of Endor
Reigning in hell
Solution is find the conjuring witch of Endor

Pushing onward through the hail storm
There will be no turning back
Seek the eyes of the fallen prophet
My only chance in this attack

Ignoring divine instructions
Souls being released by my sword
Guidance from above departed
All my questions returning ignored

Yeah solution is raise the dead
Find the conjuring witch of Endor
Reigning in hell
Solution is find the conjuring witch of Endor

In the wake of this injustice
A beaten path to the unknown
Awaiting holy apparition
And my guidance to be shown
