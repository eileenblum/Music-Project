Charging at full speed through the terrain
Leaving not a trace of life remains

The lords of the earth
The axe of the unremorseful
Is rising above
The vengeful blade is coming down

Feel the crimson mask build on my face
From those collapsed who fall for our disgrace

The lords of the earth
The axe of the unremorseful
Is rising above
The vengeful blade is coming down

The last legion of sorrow
The scorching of the earth
