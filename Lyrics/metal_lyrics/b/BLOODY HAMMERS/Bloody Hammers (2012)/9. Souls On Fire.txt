I believe my aura is dimming out a little each time
And my head is taken over by its now common decline
A steady breakdown with total destruction ahead
I can't absorb anything constructive you've said

It's easy for the world to leave you behind
When you walk the earth silent and blind
My cerebral reaper is coming for me everyday
My darkest daydreams are feeling just a little betrayed

It's easy for the world to leave you behind
When you walk the earth silent and blind

When angels spread their wings
And every word that they sing
Is in a language I can't follow
But when the witches say
They'll never lead me astray
I'll lay again with them tomorrow

Souls on fire
Our blood will flow
