Walk out in the night to the point that can't get any higher
Look down at the overlook can you see where it conspires
The old house glowing bright as day move close and discover
Could be where the congregation is to be uncovered

Black magic is in the air
They burn the candles so bright
Black magic is going on tonight
Black magic is in the air
They burn the candles so bright
Black magic is going on tonight

Remember don't get too close or look in their eyes
Don't listen to any story they speak only lies
We must end all this here tonight or god help us all
They'll walk to the gallows by morning we'll watch all them fall

Black magic is in the air
They burn the candles so bright
Black magic is going on tonight
Black magic is in the air
They burn the candles so bright
Black magic is going on tonight
