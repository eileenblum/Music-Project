There's a disturbance in this one horse town that's shaken every soul
All the dogs run loose and every man is on patrol
There is a killer among us all
A phantom that has come to see your fall
While the deacons keep us calm
With a sermon and a worship song

There's an evil that walks these moral grounds
In the Town that dreaded sundown

Careful where you park and just avoid those lonely roads
A savage strike may come again but now let's just lay low
There is a killer among us all
A phantom that has come to see your fall
Any day the hunt will end
Until then we can't let down our defense

Hot on the heels of death to take his final breath
Release all the blood hounds but he is never found
The legend does live on but those days are far long gone
The memory is always near
A subconscious repressed fear
