Dusk is gone and I still wonder,
When the wings of the night spread
The curtain of the starlit darkness
Is falling on my stage of dreams

Is it real or it's a wonder
How many times do we live?
Don't condemn our lives in vain
Through our passions we can thrive

Use it well, spend it wise
Time's a gift that's not given twice
Life is yours, don't compromise
Otherwise, you'll pay the price

Forget the past, forget the faces
Present is what leads to future
Love, forgive, remember well
7 sins' not what you live for

Regret those things you haven't done
In your life
You'll never see the truth
Unless you've heard a lie

Life is yours and believe it
Take your chance and shoot straight for the stars
Don't waste your time, no more grieving
'Cause the hourglass empties of sand

Through big lies and through sorrow
There's the hardest path to follow
But in the end you will discover
The brightest truth, like no other

Sit no more on your throne of vanity
Fight for the life you were born to live
Exorcise all the insanity
Look at the mirror, tell me what you see

Regret those things you haven't done
In your life
You'll never see the truth
Unless you've heard a lie

Life is yours and believe it
Take your chance and shoot straight for the stars
Don't waste your time, no more grieving
'Cause the hourglass empties of sand

Life is yours and believe it
Take your chance and shoot straight for the stars
Don't waste your time, no more grieving
'Cause you hold the power in your hands
