So far away, our thoughts can make us travel
But so far away, is still the key to unlock the door
So far away, there's a shelter to find cover
Where my soul can find salvation from the darkness of this world

Everybody, everyone
Needs somebody to be one
To fight for, to believe and to call on
Don't get lost in your mind's thoughts
It's a trap common to fall
Be aware of the dangers that follow

In my mind, it's so easy to despair
But her words and a whisper
Make me hope and prepare
For my final wish, I may have in this world
Dare to dream, dare to live
And travel...

Far away, take me far away
Break the chains that bind my heart
Give me your hand and let's run in the night
Under the moon, we are the damned

Trapped in a prison of emotions
In my realm of false devotions
You could heal my soul, set me free
But this freedom feels so strange
I'm imprisoned in a fear, that
Without your glance, my soul's hollow

In my mind, it's so easy to despair
But her words and a whisper
Make me hope and prepare
For my final wish, I may have in this world
Dare to dream, dare to live
And travel...

Far away, take me far away
Break the chains that bind my heart
Give me your hand and let's run in the night
Under the moon, we are the damned

"Mistress Of The Damned"

Far away, take me far away
Break the chains that bind my heart
Your eyes blaze like golden rays of the sun
Of a dawn that's yet to come

Far away, take me far away
Break the chains that bind my heart
Give me your hand and let's run in the night
Just take me far away...
