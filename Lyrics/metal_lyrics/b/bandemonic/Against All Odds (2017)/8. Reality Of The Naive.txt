Our lives
So priceless and sacred
Worthless and profane
In a wondrous nothingness we reign

Roaming in this barren wasteland
Fleeting and eternal
We submit our will
To the gods we vowed to kill

Baptized in freedom
But our choices are imprisoned
Enslaved beyond any reason

Killing our rights,
The greatest wrong they ever did
Corralled into this neatly safe reality
Deluded thoughts of immortality

A magnificent liberal kingdom
Of eternal darkness rises
Clocks are running backwards
Our downfall has begun

Baptized in freedom
But our choices are imprisoned
Enslaved beyond any reason
