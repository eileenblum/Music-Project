If one wishes to gain
I want something in exchange
Something of equal value
One must present
An offer I can not refuse

All those things
You want to achieve,
Power beyond your control
Just sign here, son
And all you've hoped will be done

Through the gates of Hell
A spirit is marching
Towards dead-end
To sacrifice my moral integrity
And fulfill my last will

This pact is sealed
With your soul as a price
This pact's in vigour
Now and 'til the day of your demise

My lustful with badly needs
From your inchor just one slip
To fuel my everlasting fire
If you insist
Upon my soul you can feast

Drunk from ambition
I find my evil made mind
Here I shall sign
And all I've craved will be mine

Through the gates of Hell
A spirit is marching
Towards dead-end
To sacrifice my moral integrity
And fulfill my last will

This pact is sealed
With your soul as a price
This pact's in vigour
Now and 'til the day of your demise
