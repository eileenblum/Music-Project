Countless night lost in agony

Sweat and tears still falling
Dreams to live turn to nightmares
Fading in the shadows

Barren land is what left behind
Our World's haunted by fears

Promises turn to broken-hopes

Fading in the shadows

What's the purpose of the things?
You've been searching in your life

It may be destiny's twist
It's a game of traps that's unfolding

Fight! WE FIGHT!

Against all odds,

We are prepared to compete

Fight! WE FIGHT!
Endless dreams
That we're heading their calling

Corruption and sciolism
Lead us to the lip of faith

Narrow minds still prosper

Vanished are all the sages

What's the purpose of the things?
You've been searching in your life

It may be destiny's twist
It's a game of traps that's unfolding

Fight! WE FIGHT!

Against all odds,

We are prepared to compete

Fight! WE FIGHT!
Endless dreams
That we're heading their calling

Nomatter where it may lead
Don't ever lose your pride
Stay strong on your feet again
Under the starlit skies

Then, stare with eyes blazing fire
Live for what you desire
Passion is the motivation
That sets our world on fire

Fight! WE FIGHT!
Against all odds,

We're condemned to succeed

Fight! WE FIGHT!
Endless dreams
That we're heading their calling
