Traitors of our kind, ruthless killers
Hold the scepters of this world
The most 'convincing' liars,
Dictators, smugglers rule us all

Preachers teach the love for gold
Evil savants out of control,
Hideous priests declaring
Who dies on the cross

In the pit of hell
Saints and sinners linger
Deified sacred rites
Won't save them anymore

The hopeless sun of our times is rising
Truth's replaced by slyness
The end seems not so far
We kneel before decay

There's no divine and no evil
Only a war and we're in the middle
It's a caste of conspirators
Whose thirst is quenched by pain

In the pit of hell
Saints and sinners linger
Deified sacred rites
Won't save them anymore

"Brothers and sisters,
Let us all unite
We'll rise above the cursed
In holy wars we march,
Don't be blind"

"Don't believe the words
Of the so-called divine
It's the anguished hunger for corruption
That will destroy your mind,
Don't be blind"

In the pit of hell
Saints and sinners linger
Deified sacred rites
Won't save them anymore
