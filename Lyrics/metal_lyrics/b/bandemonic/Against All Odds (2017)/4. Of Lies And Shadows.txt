Never just confess your feelings
Where hate is disguised in laughter
Evil minds and souls
Lurk in lies and shadows

They'll drain out all your joy
Then spit venom in your wounds
Seed the fear in your mind
You must fight 'em, you can't lose

Tied into a circle,
An aimless vicious roam
Get lost in a fantasy, to take control

Gaze in the heart of the truth
And see the essence of reality
The meaning of existence,
Who you really want to be

Words of wisdom are the
Guilt their lives are filled with
It's a never-ending struggle
In a falsely defined myth

See through your consciousness
Stop hanging on to faith
You're alone in this world
Where everyone believes in wraith

Tied into a circle,
An aimless vicious roam
Get lost in a fantasy, to take control

Gaze in the heart of the truth
And see the essence of reality
The meaning of existence,
Who you really want to be
