Living in a vain world
Exiled on the margin
Banned from seeing day's light
We still believe in dreams

In this world of idols
Leaded by the blind
In this world of patterns
We still believe in dreams

We like the way we're living
We like to be the 'damned'

Through agony and pain
We're confronting all this madness,
Harvesting every single seed
Planted by misbelief

Countless are the questions
Yet, scarce are the answers
Trapped inside society's wall
Made of prejudice

We dream, we fight, we die!
Let the fires burn!

One for all an' all for one
We're united, we're still strong
One for all an' all for one
In chase of our fate
One for all an' all for one
Signs of hope will never fade
One for all an' all for one
Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken
