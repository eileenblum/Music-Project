Time runs faster than what you thought
Dreams seem not to last long
Innocent days aren't so close as we've hoped

World's turning upside down
Feeling lonely in a hostile crowd
Lock all these memories in a cage of dreams

Take hide in the fortress of the sins
Eternal battle, you'll never ever win
Consequence's the aftermath of acts,
It's destiny's calling

Marching to oblivion, to heal the wounds on
The skin of your life, in an ocean of tears
Let the 'Waters of Regret' just wash away
The ghosts of the past in this ocean of tears

Memories keep on haunting you
Past-demons surrounding you
This feeling of hate
It's not easy to fake

Madness is compassing you
Fear of loss's terrorizing you
You thought you could hide
From the angels of fate

Take hide in the fortress of the sins
Eternal battle, you'll never ever win
Consequence's the aftermath of acts,
It's destiny's calling

Marching to oblivion, to heal the wounds on
The skin of your life, in an ocean of tears
Let the 'Waters of Regret' just wash away
The ghosts of the past in this ocean of tears
