The countdown has begun
Zero hour is at the doorstep
Our world seems like a bomb
And all the innocent seem hopeless

Traitors, murderers, thieves
Your actions brought to us grief
Never forget, that justice remembers
When it strikes, it'll be relentless

Feel your power, take command
Don't hide behind the lies
Everyone has to believe
The force is in our hands

Lives lost aimlessly
In this one well-set play
Part of this uncertainty
In the hands of the God we pray to

Feel your power, take command
Don't hide behind the lies
Everyone has to believe
The force is in our hands

Against all those vultures
That feast on our lives
We stand full of wrath
It's time to attack!

Long time abandoned
In the mercy of God
No more time to lose
We will strike back!

Feel your power, take command
Don't hide behind the lies
Everyone has to believe
The force is in our hands
