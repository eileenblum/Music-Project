The clock strikes midnight
And the wolves start to howl
It's the time when the dead
Rise from hell to our world
Beware
This silence
Just don't shout
Hear your heart beating
As you come close to (the) devil's mouth
Awaken the
Legions of the damned
Darkness's been reborn
No God nor demon will show grace
Awakening
Hell is now on earth
Mankind lost its faith
No one 'll see the light again
The tombs are all shattered
The flames of hell unleashed
Inferno's Gates are open
The tormented walk the earth, again
Beware
Your end
May be closer than you thought
In this realm of terror
The Evil has the driver's spot
