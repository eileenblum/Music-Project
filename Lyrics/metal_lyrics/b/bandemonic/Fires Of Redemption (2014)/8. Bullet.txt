Let me tell to you a story
Of a life I almost lived
How the dreams can be dust
How true love is just lust
How my mistress was vanished in grief
Long ago I've seen her face
A reflection, though, in tide lakes
Had a long way to go, an endless fight
But now I still fall
Broken dreams and dust
Are all parts of my own past
But I willâ¦
Keep living my own youth
Till the day this bullet
Strikes me down, AGAIN
How ironic just pretending
In the nights you've been yearning
All what I had
More than I could
To satisfy this insatiable soul
Keep accusing me of gamble
But my life is an endless ramble
Put the blame on me again,
I'll risk to play this Russian roulette
Utmost sins and lies
Are all now reflected
In your eyes, LIES
Arm your hidden gun
So this day a bullet
'll strike me down, AGAIN
I just don't know how to live
If I've never ever died
Better live in an evil world
Than enjoying a fake life
I just don't know how it feels
Losin' my soul, losin' my mind
With a bullet made of love
You shot a hole through our own time
I was searching for an answer
Your dismay seeds a cancer
In my bleeding old soul
You unsay what you've told
You denied to heed my last call
Now, it'll never be the same
You ain't leave your self to change its mind
You've decided where to go,
May not your choice turn out to be wrong
You said me goodbye
With a mourning black bird's
Cry, WHY?
Arm your hidden gun
And shoot me now
Right between the eyes, LIES
You just don't know how to live
If you never ever died
Better live in an evil world
Than enjoying a fake life
You just don't know how it feels
Losin' your soul, losin' your mind
With a bullet made of 'love'
I'll shoot a hole through your own time
