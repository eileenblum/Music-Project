One night
I heard a thundering scream
A murder on the corner
My sin

My vengeance
is ordered by hate
Relentless
I'll Face my fate

I'll introduce myself
A way you can't ignore
I'll punish your duplicity
Redemption's what I seek for

My heart beats fast
And my mind spins faster
No one can save you
From this total disaster

Rain falls washing
The blood from my hands
I feel I've followed
Devil's commands

My vow can only be abrogated
By death
I'll hunt you till
My very last breath

I'll beat you down to the dirt
Torment
You'll taste all the blood from your face
And I'll smash the past that's not true
Torment
I'll Take back what doesn't belong to you

I'll haunt your every
Little step
No rest for you
You're caught in my web

Your nightmare
Is what feeds my lust
You're nothing but
A grain of dust

I see your face
And my eyes burn with fire
Can not control
My rage and desire

In darkness
You can't hide your face
I'll find you
Start counting your last days
