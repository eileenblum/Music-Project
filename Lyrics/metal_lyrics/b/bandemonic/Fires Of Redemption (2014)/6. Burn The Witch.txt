Back in the medieval age
Rumors 've been spreading like disease
Ignorance was controllin' the minds
The trodden was the way of peace
No progression, just salvation
What the holy fathers preached
"God will judge upon your sins
if you're spoiled, you're in the pit"
Scientists and savants sentenced,
Members of an evil breed
Illuminate with their pyre
What's unholy, set to extinct
They abuse the words He preached,
Ordered by the evil creed
In disguise, Devil's rites,
Invoked God's truest lies
Writings of our ancestors
Burned to placate Creator's wrath
Thought this way we could avoid
To swerve to that dark path
For almost 500 years
This persistence was reaping souls
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons
Victims of a holy war
Burned in fires of redemption
harvested the sinner-souls
All these crimes had been done
in the name of Father, God!
They abuse the words He preached,
ordered by the evil creed
Inquisition, Holy Mission
fight the heretic's beliefs
BURN
BURN
BURN
BURN THE WITCH
Burned in fires of redemption
harvested the sinner-souls
All these crimes had been done
in the name of Father, God!
They abuse the words He preached,
ordered by the evil creed
In disguise, Devil's rites,
Invoked God's truest lies
They abuse the words He preached,
ordered by the evil creed
Inquisition, Holy Mission
fight the heretic's beliefs
