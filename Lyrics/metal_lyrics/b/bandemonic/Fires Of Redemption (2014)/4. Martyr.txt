Thunder strikes
Cracks the sky
Hunted Martyr's
Persecution
In God's eyes
Guilty one
The Justice orders
Execution
"You have locked me
In a cage
In a cold, dark,
Silent hill
Now, my eyes burn
With fire
As my will grows
Strong in me"
Infernal Incursion, diabolical sect
Cursed demon and legions of the damned
The plot is set, accusation's made
Martyr is a slave of the fallen one
"Paying for the Sins I've not committed
I've seen my life ending, fading black
Rotting in my cold cell
What have I done?
I'm the Martyr, I'm the chosen one"
Phantom, playing
In the game of shadows
As it rises in the
Moonlight
Vengeance,
The power is at hand
No time to waste
There's need to strike back
Remember,
There's accusation, no proof
One day I may deliver
The truth
"One day you'll die
by the hands of deceiver"
And then you'll realize
What have you done
Dark powers
Can't devastate my force
I'll fight
The evil from its source
