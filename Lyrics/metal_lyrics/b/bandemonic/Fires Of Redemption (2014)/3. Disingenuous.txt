Anger and rage in my eyes
Everything fades, everything ends
With the taste of tears and pain
Disgraced my self
Ashamed my pride, I seek vengeance
Through a path of lies, my heart's cold as ice
(My heart's cold as ice)
Am I a saint of God
Devil's sinner, left hand
Am I a creature of guile
I'm disingenuous
Flagellated my self
Walked in earth that was burning on fire
Everywhere dust, everywhere blood
I'm disingenuous
I've been judged by my fate
Now I just stand and wait
For my soul be redeemed
I'm the father of sin
Selfish and cunning deceiver
I am the dark, I am the light
(I am the light)
