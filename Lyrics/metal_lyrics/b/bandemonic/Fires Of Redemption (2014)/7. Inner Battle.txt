Hell, my eyes can see
Our world on fire
But what can we do
Deception is killing our souls
Turning the fathers against
Their own sons
Escape, this hellish realm you live,
And find the truth, which path to choose
Life is an inner battle
An endless quest to the unknown
Life's like the light of a candle
But, in the end it's only smoke
Gluttony, devours our souls
Greed marks the way
To sell out our world
Dignity, you can't find in faces
Fake deliverance
There's no salvation, in words
Life is an inner battle
An endless quest to the unknown
Life's like the light of a candle
But, in the end it's only smoke
There're two ways in your life
Either yours, or what luck commands
A crossroad where you decide
Are you a fighter or are you lost?
