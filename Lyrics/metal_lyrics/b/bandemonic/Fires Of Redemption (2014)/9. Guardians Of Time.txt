Have you ever felt alone
Although, you weren't lonely
The cold embrace of your fears
Approaching in the night
Did you ever feel
That someone is so near
That you could see his face through the dark
However it's not so clear
As you're walkin' on the streets
The wind blows on your face
Memories of a life that's gone
You've been mourning these last days
But the time will surely come
To live again those moments
An angel far beyond our world
Is guarding us through time
And you know that you'll never be alone in time
Cause you always will have those who you loved, those who you cried for,
By your side.They're shapes in the night, our hope through hard times
They became our Guardians of Time
Have you ever felt the darkness
Growing all around you
Surrounding all the joys of life
Discouraging your will
Did you ever feel
The emptiness grow inside you
The stories of an ending life
Narrated by a tear
And through the time they'll always guard you
On your side they will always be
Raise your eyes in the sky
It's your fate what you can see
And the time will surely come
To live again those moments
An angel far beyond our world
Is guarding us through time
In the night, when the silence's so loud
Hear their voices, whisper in your ear
See their shape by your side
They'll never be dead
In your heart
And you know that you'll never be alone in time
They will guard us from above every day, every night
Every moment they trace all the dangers we may face
Our Guardians (the guardians) of Time
