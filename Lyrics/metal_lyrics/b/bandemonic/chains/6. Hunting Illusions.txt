Through the mist
I saw your figure
Realised that it's you
And from that time and forever
I'll be coming after you

No idea of what I had
In my hands so long ago
Sweety games that would hurt me
The only way was let you go

Tried to erase you from my memory
it was, in fact, too difficult
your whisper echoes in my ears
come on and love me, give more

Once I had the chance to love you
but I wasted like a scrap
Now I'm standing at the corner
And I just offend my luck

Neverending daydreaming
Your illusion in the sky
I will leave my heart to follow
navigate me through the night

Slightly light I see through darkness
I hear your heartbeat near me
Made my mind came to find you
And restore my memory
