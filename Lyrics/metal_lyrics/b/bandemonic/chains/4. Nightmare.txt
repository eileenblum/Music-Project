In your sleep
you see dark visions
strong emotion
with no reason

In the night
fear of the light
discomfort
you can not hide

Usually woken in a state of distress
Brain activity over the edge
In cold sweat you hear footsteps
towards you
insomnia
it can't be true

How can I exorcise the spell that I'm cursed
The evil nightmare that consumes all the hate
When lightning strikes, when the world explodes
I hear your laughter when I am alone

Nightmare
I'm here to make you remember
Nightmare
I'm here to enjoy your pain
Nightmare
I'm here to taste your tears
Nightmare
I'm here to let you lonely in fears

Mental game
you're trapped within
causes nightmares for your sin

Mental game
you're set to play
roll the dice, don't be afraid
