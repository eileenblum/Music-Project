Night,always seems so bright
When all these forsaken lights
dance in my mind

Go,try to find more
try to find the sacred ones
through mirrors of the past

I'll hunt your ghosts through the night
deceiving my fate 'till it dies

Blight,tired of this light
I wanna keep it deep inside
in a corner of my mind

Faith,i don't need this wraith
That tries to eat my soul
i can feel it every day

I'll hunt your angels through the dawn
trying to find a shelter in hope 'till it's
gone!

I WILL NOT DIE
MY THOUGHTS ERASED BY YOUR DISEASE
I WILL NOT FALL
I WON'T STOP TILL IM ALONE

In time,as i'm reaching for a sign
i'm wandering the streets of doom
defying the divine

Night,always seems so bright
When all these forsaken lights
dance in my mind

I'll hunt your ghosts through the night
deceiving my fate 'till it dies

I'll hunt your angels through the dawn
trying to find a shelter in hope 'till it's
gone!
