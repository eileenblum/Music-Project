Whispers everywhere
Fire surounds me
and I'm crawling alone

Twisting my mind
crushing me down
smashing my dreams
no hope at all

Once I was caught
in the middle of nowhere
trapped in my fears all alone

My blackened thoughts
winding (in) my mind
hunting me down, taking my soul

(Run, fight, try find the light)

When all is lost
when all is gone 
I need a light
to guide me home

When light fades
when (the) moon has set
show me the way 
to return

Now as I run
to escape this nightmare
I need forgiveness to go on

It's hard to say
what I escaped from
It's hard to tell 
how I won
