Raindrops fall
and hit the window
shadows move away from me
from dusk to dawn
it is my freedom
a wall of thoughts surrounds me

Carved in stone
it is the call
that I surely have to heed
but the broken words of sorrow
hunt me down, they're after me

They're after me...

Travel through your dreams
roam through forever
past's and present's ships
leave the docks of never

Travel through their lies
Hypocrisy and hatred
Swim in seas of cries
Set Sail To Heaven

Watching the clock ticking away
the sands of time are running low
my mind is scared, my heart is broken
and I can hear your voice no more

The window is closed, the door is shut
I can feel my soul numb with fear
All I felt and all I've known
all shrinked inside a tear

Inside a tear...

Travel through your dreams
roam through forever
past's and present's ships
leave the docks of never

Travel through their lies
Hypocrisy and hatred
Swim in seas of cries
Set Sail To Heaven
