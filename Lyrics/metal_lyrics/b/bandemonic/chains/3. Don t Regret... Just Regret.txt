Many times
I had doubts
About how 
I will go on

Day by day
Night by night
the pain I felt
was much too strong

I asked for a gift
you filled me with pain
I asked for your smile
but you walked away

Don't regret for the decisions (that) you've taken
Don't regret for the way you've walked
Just regret cause life was mistaken
Cause it lead you to a path far from love

Life had taught me
to avoid reacting in rush
cause it seems that sometimes
your actions are locked in the past

I'm not so weak
as you believed
I trust my own decisions
I won't deny my past, I won't forget my visions

But I wonder
why you hurt me so much
was I bad, was I cruel, was I fool
for you
and you hated to be treated like that

Don't regret for the decisions (that) you've taken
Don't regret for the way you've walked
Just regret cause life was mistaken
Cause it lead you to a path far from love

What I wish for
Is to find your way
Be in love
and I swear I will pray
for your good
in exchange for my pain
for my dreams that you smashed
and you left me in rain

Don't regret for the decisions (that) you've taken
Don't regret for the way you've walked
Just regret cause life was mistaken
Cause it lead you to a path far from love
