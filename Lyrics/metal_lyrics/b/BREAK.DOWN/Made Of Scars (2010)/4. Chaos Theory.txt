DARK SMOKE BLIND MY EYES
WONÂ´T LET ME SEE IF ITS HARD TO FIND
ALL THE SECRETS IN MY HEAD
TO SAVE MY SELF AN HELP ME TO DESPAIR
FULL OF PAIN FULL OF GRACE , SHES IN THE AIR
DOWN IN A HOLE ,ILL BE WAITING THERE FOR YOU
LOOKING ON MY CHILDHOOD BOOKS
TO BURN THE PAST AN GET ME THROUGH
PLEASE COME ON AND TAKE ME NOW!!!!
BEFORE I LOSE MYSELF ANDÂ BREAK ME DOWN
SOME SECRETS TOLD , CAN YOU TELL ME IF I'M WRONG
IS DARK AND SLOW , THE KIND OF PLACE WHERE I BELONG

[CHORUS:]
RACKED MY HEAD , NOT MY DAY , CANNOT SEE IT WAS OUT THERE,
HARD TO KNOW ,HARD TO CRAWL , OR SHE MAKES ME DISAPPEARÂ 

SOME SECRETS TOLD , WILL SHOW YOU IF AM I WRONG
IS DARK AND SLOW , THE KIND OF DEATH WHERE I BELONGÂ 

[CHORUS:]
RACKED MY HEAD , NOT MY DAY , CANNOT SEE IT WAS OUT THERE,
HARD TO KNOW ,HARDÂ  TO CRAWL , OR SHE MAKES ME DISAPPEAR
