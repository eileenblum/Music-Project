WHAT YOU HEARD AND WHAT YOU SEE,
AND NO ONE TOLD YOU WHAT TO BELIEVE,
ITS MAKE ME TURN AND BACK IN TIME,
ITS MAKES ME FUCKED AND BREAK DOWN!

AM I WRONG , AM I RIGHT
THIS ISNÂ´T FINE
KAYLEIH CAME TAKE MY HAND ONCE AGAIN

[CHORUS:]
NOW, I'M THE MAN IN THE DIRT (CAN YOU HELP ME!!!)
EVEN TOLD BY ONE MORE (LOOK AT ME)

NOW I'M OLD WISE ENOUGH THAN THE PAST
SO , WHAT SHIT , IS GOING WRONG WITH MY LIFE?

[CHORUS:]
HAPPINESS ISNÂ´T HERE (CAN YOU HELP ME!!!)
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BEFORE (LOOK AT ME)
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BEFORE!!!

HAPPINESSÂ  ISNÂ´T HERE (CAN YOU HELP ME!!!)
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BEFORE(LOOK AT ME)
NOW ,I'M THE MAN IN THE DIRT
NOT EVEN TOLD â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ONE MORE
