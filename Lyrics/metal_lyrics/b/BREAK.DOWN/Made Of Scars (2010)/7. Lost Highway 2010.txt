IN MY WAY HES COMING BEFORE BLIND EYES
ITS HARD THIS ROAD AND THERE'S A DEVIL THAT WAITS INSIDE
DEAD MAN!! HE SHOUT TO ME ONCE AGAIN
BUT NOW I'M READY TO FIND , THE WAY OUT OF HERE

[PRE CHORUS:]
WHAT, THIS WORLD
TAKE MY OUT
BRING ME HOME!

[CHORUS:]
NOW THAT I,NOW I'M PART OF IT
I'M SICK AND TIRED TRYING TO FIND THE WAY
NOW THAT I SEE , I CANT GET OUT OF HERE
I REALIZE THAT I'M IN THE LOST HIGHWAY.

WHATS THE PLAN ,THE BLOOD COVER ON MY EYES ,
ITS HARD TO KNOW AND SEE IT IF I'M THAT BLIND
SADNESS ...A SCROUBLE INSIDE MY HEAD, DRIVE TO GET MY SWEETEST HELL OR I SHOULD KILL MYSELF

[PRE CHORUS:]
WHAT, THIS WORLD
TAKE MY OUT
BRING ME HOME!

[CHORUS:]
NOW THAT I,NOW I'M PART OF IT
I'M SICK AND TIRED TRYING TO FIND THE WAY
NOW THAT I SEE , I CANT GET OUT OF HERE
I REALIZE THAT I'M IN THE LOST HIGHWAY.
