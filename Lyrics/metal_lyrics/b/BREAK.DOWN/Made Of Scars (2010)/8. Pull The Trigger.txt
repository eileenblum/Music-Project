COME ON YOU TURN AROUND MOTHER FUCKER
YOU ROUND TO GET TO YOU
REMEMBER ME YOU CUNT? THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
ALL BE WAITING ALONEÂ  TIME FOR THIS
TO PUT YOUR SELF IN KNEES
SO WHY YOU CRY ...YOU FAGOT!Â 
COME ON!

WE FEEL SO GREAT
TO GREP YOUR NECK
AND PUT YOUR DOWN
LIKEÂ CHICKEN SHIT
ANOTHER CHANCE TO KILL YOUR STRAIGHT
ANOTHER CHANCE TO SHOUT YOU

[CHORUS:]
HOLD ON YOU THERE
ORÂ YOUÂ´LL BE DEAD
PULL THE TRIGGER!Â 

NOBODY CAN STOP THIS NOW
NOW NOT EVEN YOUR BEGGING EYES
I WILL COME TO YOU
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW TOO
ALL BE WAITING ALONEÂ  TIME FOR THIS
TO PUT YOUR SELF IN KNEES
SO WHY YOU CRY ...YOU FAGOT!Â 
COME ON!
WE FEEL SO GREAT
TO GREP YOUR NECK
AND PUT YOUR DOWN
LIKEÂ CHICKEN SHIT
ANOTHER CHANCE TO KILL YOUR STRAIGHT
ANOTHER CHANCE TO SHOUT YOU

[CHORUS]
HOLD ON YOU THERE
ORÂ YOUÂ´LL BE DEAD
