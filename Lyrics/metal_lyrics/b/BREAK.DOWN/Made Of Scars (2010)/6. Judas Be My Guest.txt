LOOKING SINCE THE DAWN OF LIFEÂ 
ALL THAT HAPPENED NEW MY PASTÂ 
LOT OF FACES DOWN WITH BLOODÂ 
TEAR ME UP AND CRUSH MY SOULÂ 
Â 
[PRE CHORUS:]
PEOPLE TOLD ME HE IS A TRAITOR .Â 
ONE OF THOSE THAT YOU DON'T WANT,Â 
BUT LET ME TELL YOU HE IS MY MENTORÂ 
Â 
[CHORUS:]
I KNOW THAT TRUE,JUDAS IS MY LAWÂ 
Â 
NOW ITS TIME DON'T COWARD UPÂ 
TAKE THIS GUN AND BE A MANÂ 
WE DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO LOSEÂ 
OUR TIME WILL COME ITS TRUEÂ 
Â 
[PRE CHORUS:]
I'M NOT AFRAID OF TAKING CHANCESÂ 
I DON'T CARE IF WE BOTH DIEÂ 
SO GET YOUR GUN AND BE MY PARTNERÂ 
Â 
[CHORUS:]
I KNOW ITS TRUE,JUDAS IS MY LAWÂ 
Â 
[PRE CHORUS:]
PEOPLE TOLD ME HE IS A TRAITOR Â 
ONE OF THOSE THATÂ I DON'T WANT,Â 
BUT I GOT AWAY WITH MY LAW
[CHORUS:Â ]
I KNOW ITS TRUE,JUDAS IS MY LAWÂ Â
