BRINGING DOWN MY HOPE ,
I CANT FEEL MORE STRONG,
IT COULDN'T TAKE ANOTHER DAY,
LOOKING FOR THE STRAW,
ALL MY DREAMS HAVE GONE,
IT SEEMS TO EXPLODE ALL OF MY VEINS

[CHORUS:]
I FEELING SO SMALL.
I CANT TAKE THIS NO MORE ,
THE END IS ABOUT TO COME...YEAH
ONLY 50 BUCKS AND SOLUTION IS ON,  ITS JUST AN EASY WAY TO ESCAPE,
BLOOD GETS COLDER NOW ,  MAKES ME WANNA SHOUT ,  MY ARMS ARE SHAKING ONCE AGAIN

[CHORUS:]
I FEELING SO SMALL .
I CANT TAKE THIS NO MORE ,
THE END IS ABOUT TO COME...YEAH
COME ON TOUGH GUY AND STANDING RIGHT HERE
COME ON HIT ME ONCE AGAIN COME ON SHINY LITTLE FUCKER, FUCKER , FUCK YOU!
SHOUT OUT ! LET IT OUT!
