LIFE LOOKS SO TOUGH
I'M FEELING SO DOWN
TO FIGHT ALL THIS CONFUSION IN MY MIND
THAT IS KILLING ME

[EDDIE:]  THERE'S NO FAITH JUST SET YOURSELF FREE
[JANINE:] I'M LOST GOT NOWHERE TO GO
[EDDIE:]  YOUÂ´LL MAKE YOUR WAY
[JANINE:] I'M LOST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO...WITH MY SELF
[EDDIE:]  DARKNESS WILL PREVAIL

GIVE ME ALL YOUR REASONS
WHILE I CAN BE PREPARE
I NEED TO FIND THE ANSWERS
SHOW ME THE WAY

[EDDIE:] THERE'S NO FAITH JUST SET YOURSELF FREE
[JANINE:] I'M LOST GOT NOWHERE TO GO
[EDDIE:] YOUÂ´LL MAKE YOUR WAY
[JANINE:]  I'M LOST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO....WITH MY SELF
[EDDIE:] DARKNESS WILL PREVAIL
[EDDIE:] FOLLOW THE DARK GRAIL
[JANINE:] I'M LOST GOT NOWHERE TO GO
[EDDIE:] OPEN YOUR MIND
[JANINE:] I'M LOST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO...WITH MYSELF
[EDDIE:] THERE IS NO GOD.

[JANINE:] I'M LOST GOT NOWHERE TO GO
[EDDIE:] YOUÂ´LL MAKE YOUR WAY
[EDDIE:] THERE IS NO GOD
[JANINE:] TAKE ME AWAY!!!!!
