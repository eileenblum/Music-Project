NOW THAT I SEE YOU ONCE AGAIN , LAY DOWN BY MY SIDE
I REALIZE DE BITCH YOU ARE ,TO MAKE FELL DOWN ONE MORE TIME
FEEL YOUR SKIN RIGHT NEXT TO ME ,ITÂ´S MAKES WANNA BRING YOU DOWN
I'M READY IT RUMBLE ,I'M THE KING OF THE JUNGLE ,I'M READY TO ROAR!!

[CHORUS:]
COME ON FEEL MY BREATH
TASTE THE, WHO I AM!
ALL I WANT GIRL
IS TASTE YOUR SOUR LIPS!

HEY! GIRL EAR ME WAKE UP NOW ,IS TIME FOR YOU TO GO
I REALLY HAVE NICE WILD NIGHT ,LIKE I NEVER GOT BEFORE
THERE'S A CAB WAITING FOR YOU , JUST IN FRONT OF MY DOOR
SO GOOD BYE BABE, CALL ME FOR A NEXT TIME ,BUT NOW IS TIME TO GO!

[CHORUS:]
NOW I LEARN TO PLAY
YOUR FUCKING NASTY GAME
NOW WAS MY TIME TO WIN
I DONÂ´T MIND THOSE SOUR LIPS!
