I am the way...

I challenge your sacred beliefs
I slaughter the flock of sheep
I am your redeeming device
Look into the eyes of your bitter demise
Habitual
Ritualistic
Eventually becoming sadistic
Human herd failing to grasp
Fall to reality
Time to tread a new path
Follow the Iconoclast
You see through holy tinted eyes
You are the one your maker despises
You and your dogma condemned are fought to death with every dying breath
You put your trust in your "savior"
Has he ever returned the favor?
If your feeble minds can grasp... the answer is no
Follow the Iconoclast when your beliefs are fading fast
After all is gone and it's useless to pray don't look to your God for he has lost His way
Crossing the span of space and time, beliefs converge, controlling the mind
Hearing the toll of sanity's bell while catching a glimpse of your religion's true hell
"Bow to me," sayeth the Lord
You are abhorred
Hallowed be My name
My kingdom come
Thy kingdom undone
On earth as well as in heaven
Follow my way to salvation this day
I lead you all into temptation and deliver you to evil
Jump into the abyss never expecting to be engulfed by darkness
I'll witness your end... your final collapse
Losing your souls in one fleeting gasp
When all that is left is a burning desire I will set heaven on fire
When it is useless to pray and your beliefs are fading fast... Follow the Iconoclast
