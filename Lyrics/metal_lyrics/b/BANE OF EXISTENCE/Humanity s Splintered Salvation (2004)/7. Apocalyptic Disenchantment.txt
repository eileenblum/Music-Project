The sky becomes blanketed smothered in black
Falling hopelessly, the angels burning to ash
Blocking the sun, no light to be shone Heaven and Earth now fused into one
The heavens dissected crumbling under the weight
Too many souls passing through the gate
Plummeting fast, the fate of the dead
Pity for those left better unsaid
Mighty dethronement
Failed savior and all
Catastrophic enchant to break the fall
Two worlds colliding, the unseen and the known a thunderous crash to the world down below
The scriptures foretold of a coming Apocalypse but nothing will survive neither Mortal nor Divine
Blood now rains upwards to the nothingness
The bodies smoldering from the cataclysm
Heaven's gates now transmogrified into ruins
The holy throne shattered into reality scattered in the bloody depths of boiling seas
The scriptures foretold of a coming Apocalypse but nothing will survive neither Mortal nor Divine
Saintly blood mixes with that of Mortal Man
With a deafening sound Heaven crashes Earthbound
