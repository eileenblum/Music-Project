Lost spoken hymns from mouth Divine
Spoiled words from your heart to mine
Bittersweet blood of the cancerous kind
Spilled ever flowing from my lips to thine
Unforgotten lies acknowledged with a glance like love and hate locked in eternal dance
Eye for an eye, hand in hand
Lost in the meaning of our own circumstance
Backwards thought from a blackened abyss
Evolved from ages devoid of bliss
Searching for meaning of why we exist
Holy arrogance brought the final death kiss
Succumbing to the notion of being led like a slave
But believing in this ideology has led us to the grave
Witness the coming of Judgement Day
Wallowing in ignorance... we will not be saved
From soiled heart to infected tongue, detrimental catechises has now begun
From infected tongue forsaken ears, lies to be believed for years
From soiled heart to infected tongue, Heaven's long told fable is now being sung
From infected tongue to corrupted mind, a dark empty shell is all we'll find
Centuries of morbid loyalty
Millions of unburied dead
Killed by the self-righteous, in the name of God
Spilling the blood of man...
Why must we be forced this inheritance?
Why must we be choked by insignificance?
Our right to think was stolen right from birth
Left to follow aimlessly about this earth
Why must we swallow all these lies?
Why must we watch as loved ones slowly die?
There is no proof that God truly does exist
Drenched in blood of Divine bliss
Forsaken are the endless cries
No purgatory behind these eyes
