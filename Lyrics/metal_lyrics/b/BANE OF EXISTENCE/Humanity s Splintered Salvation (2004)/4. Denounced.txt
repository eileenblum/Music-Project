The vulgar resentment I feel for you
And all you have put me through.
The pain you have caused cannot compare.
So called lord, why don't you care?
I denounce you
And all you stand for.
I despise your kingdom in heaven.
Life of lies.
I can't take any more.
Blasphemous rage fills my eyes.
This world of shit has been forced on me.
Nothing I do will set me free.
I break the ties that will cause me pain.
Your precious faith is all in vain.
Invert the rites and Catholic verse.
Bastardized religions now rehearsed.
Break the oath; curse the path.
Blind followers led to death.
Plague of His Creation ... Blasphemy
Die Christ ... Unbelief
I live to not believe.
But as I look around my world,
I know you must be true.
Killing and murdering without a sound.
Millions dead ... burial ground.
All in praise of your name ...
More dead bodies all because of you.
Judged and cursed by the laws you made.
Bleeding, dying slowly raped.
Existence based on a book of lies.
Heaven is Hell when we die.
If you truly do exist,
Then it only stands to reason,
That to you we're just a game.
A schizophrenic entity.
God and Satan are one in the same.
I deplore you
And laugh in your face.
The hypocrisy of belief.
Endless hate
Symbolize your ways.
Denounce you in blasphemy.
Father of worthlessness ... The plague of His own creation.
A schizophrenic entity ... God and Satan are one in the same.
Bitter hatred I cast on you
And all you have put me through.
The pain I now realize,
You'll still be there even when I die.
