[Part I: the Sleepers Beneath (the Prophecy)]

As clouds descend from evening skies
and the day entwines with night
The wind whispers a lullaby
once forgotten in time

The song of this timeless wind
was once buried deep
But now it has risen from beneath
from where Twilight's Angels sleep

The Abominations of Evenfall
lie awaiting the sign;
A prophetic son, yet not born,
in the womb awaiting his time

The child he shall be born tonight,
unaware of his might divine
For he may be a guide to light
or call the beasts beyond night

It is said that if the child's alive
there will be no night
No disease shall steal a life
and grief turns to delight

It is said that if the child's alive,
There will be no nightmares
The horrors of the evenfall
shall burn away like flares &lt;-- tasta alempana asiaa

But if the child is dead,
never there will be a dawn
The Twilight's Angels shall arise
by the stillborn one's call

If Twilight's Angels will be released,
It will be the end of all
The pain, the plague, the death unleashed
From heavens they fall

[Part II: the Birth]

A silent await for the child to born,
the time is at hand
A woman gives birth to son
while mist veils the land

An eerie whisper, almost like a ghost,
roars upon her bed
She gave a birth to son..
Yet the child is dead.

[Part III: the Abomination Unveiled]

Winds gather to unite deep within the woods
The Twilight's Angels arise hungering for souls
The mist is swept by the risen storm,
and clouds above turn red;
The spell is cast from the land forlorn
where abominations slept
The Twilight's Angels depart
under the bleeding skies
Dancing to eternities, praising the endless night
The storm screams a serenade,
as the Twilight's Angels dance
All life is swept by the raging plague,
and waters turn to sand

[Part IV: the Dance of Twilight's Angels]

And the Angels of Twilight danced...
