Godless and eyeless
With a pristine word
and a charcoal heart.
Staring down from someplace else

We speak like snakes
We live like leaves
We take like men
We touch like thieves

Standing under the oak,
Under cloak and hood

Down by the sea
and under the waves
it was whispered to me
that nought was saved

Over the Plains
deep under the ground
the night sung in my ear
that all will be found

Scaling the wall
that hid all from sight
our bodies grew weak
our skin seared by the light

So why is it now
that all is undone
in the age when the moon
makes pale the sun
