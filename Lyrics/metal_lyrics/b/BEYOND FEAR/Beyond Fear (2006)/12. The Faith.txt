[Owens]

I hope you have belief in me my brother
What I believe is like no other
I want to live for you, not just for me
The music is the thing that sets me free

[Chorus:]
I believe in what I do, You'll see it in my face
I believe in what I do because I have the faith

I'll never turn my back and run away
I know others have but i'm here to stay
I see you standing there, fists in the air
The crowd it comes alive, what's there to fear

[Repeat chorus 2x]

I heard the rumors and I don't care if they're true
I'm sick of all the lies, don't you have something to do
I said I won't turn my back and run away
I won't look to the past, I'm here to stay

I have the faith
