[Owens]

My vision is hazy, there's clouds all around
I'm writing these last words for death is abound
Now I'm high in the sky, My last trip I'll take
I'm sorry my family, for all my mistakes

[Chorus:]
As I look around at the fear in their eyes
All are praying 'cause they're gonna die

With all this chaos, it's getting harder to breathe
I'm trying to write this for something to leave
Now my family and friends, you knew me so well
I hope there's a story for someone to tell

[Repeat chorus]

To my wife and my kids, I will be in your sight
When you see a star, it's me shining bright
I see the end is near, the grounds coming fast
So just keep my memories, our love will last

[Repeat chorus 2x]
