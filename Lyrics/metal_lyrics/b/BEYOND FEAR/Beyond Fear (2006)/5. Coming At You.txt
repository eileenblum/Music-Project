[Owens]

Do you see it, do you see it
Do you see it, it's coming at you
Do you see it, do you see it
Can if feel it, it's coming at you

Do you see it, can you feel it
Coming at you, making you sick
Look around, what do you see
A world of lies and misery

It knows what's in your head
All your thoughts that's never said
A disease, it's all around
Just a shadow without a doubt

You've seen my people around you die
No rhyme or reason to say good bye

On the ground or in the air
Maybe cancer to spread fear
It's own god, it's own religion
Taking life, it's addiction

It's in church, it's in your schools
Teaching something you can't learn
You're not safe, young or old
for death's coming, so I've been told

Do you see it, do you see it
Do you see it now, It's coming at you
