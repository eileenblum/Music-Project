[Owens]

Why do you look at me
And haunt me in my dreams
I don't need this anymore
The things you've done to me
Let's keep them in the past

[Chorus:]
I don't (I said I don't)
I don't need this anymore
Yea, Yea, Yea

Some say I'm crazy
Some say I was a fool
I don't need this anymore
The way you used me
Nothing but your tool

[Repeat chorus]

I've always listened
And it's always about you
I don't need this anymore
The door is open
And it's time for you to finally leave

I don't (We don't, I said)
I don't need this anymore
Yea, Yea, Yea
Yea, Yea, Yea
