[Comprix / Owens]

With giant claws of steel, it has arrived
The metal monster, it's now alive
It came to take our world, and steal your soul
It will find you, and take control

[Chorus:]
Scream machine - it will bore inside your head
Scream machine - you will feel it's power

Don't look into it's eyes, or you will die
You know it's on the prowl, it's getting closer
I see your fear, you should beware
The metal giant, it will rip your heart out

[Repeat chorus]

Can you feel it, it's getting closer
It's taking over your world

[Repeat chorus]
