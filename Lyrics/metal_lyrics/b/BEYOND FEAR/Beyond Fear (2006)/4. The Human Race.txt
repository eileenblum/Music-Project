[Comprix / Owens]

Can you help me, I'm drowning slowly
This world that I see, It's not the same

I look around me, and I see pain
Do I feel sorry, the answer, no I don't

[Chorus:]
What have you done, look at this place
Who is to blame, the human race

My mind it wonders, what's in the future
This place we live in, It's not the same

All of these changes, who is to blame
Do I feel sorry, the answer, no I don't

[Repeat chorus]
