[Comprix / Owens]

They talk about you and you don't care
The things they tell us, We must beware

Out in the darkness you take your prey
You rape and kill them, That's what they say

[Chorus:]
Just who are you, You cannot hide
They will get you and you will die

Why do you do this, You're just insane
You have no feelings, You feel no pain
