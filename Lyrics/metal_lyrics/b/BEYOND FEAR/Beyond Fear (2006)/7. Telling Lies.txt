[Comprix / Owens]

What have you done to this place
You are destroying our race
They think it's time you leave
And time that something's done

Can you tell them that you are the one
Can you tell them that you think we've won

Let's go finish someone's war
They can't take anymore

You just sit there and you tell your lies
You just sit there as our children die

Liar (Liar), Truthless (Truthless)
Coward, Breathing, You're heartless

Look around and you can help us please
Can you hear our pool, they're suffering
You just sit there as out children die
And you sit there and you tell your lies
