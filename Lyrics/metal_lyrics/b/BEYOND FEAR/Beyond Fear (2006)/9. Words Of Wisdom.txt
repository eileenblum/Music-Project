[Comprix / Owens]

Can you tell me what this thing is
That you've written about me
That causes people so much pain
Why do you do this

[Chorus:]
I know you can't be trusted
I just don't give a damn
Why do you cause such heartache
I read your words of wisdom

You just care about yourself
Not my life and no one else
You just sit there in the dark
You're just a liar

[Repeat chorus]

You won't say it to our face
We will put you in your place
You just smile and walk away
'Cause you're a liar

[Repeat chorus]
