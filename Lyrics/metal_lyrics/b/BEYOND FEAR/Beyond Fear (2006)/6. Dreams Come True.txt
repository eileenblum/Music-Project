[Comprix / Owens]

Out in the darkness, far away
There lies a place that beckons me to stay
Where dreams come true, no need to pray
And love is something that never goes away

[Chorus:]
Close your eyes for something new
For when you sleep, Your dreams come true

The trees so green and the waters blue
You never get sick and you're never told what to do
Your family's there, you never say good bye
And the ones that you've lost are right there by your side

[Repeat chorus]

I see myself, flying high in the sky
I'm in the clouds, way up so high...so high

Look at me, I'm a child again
I'm in the yard playing with my old friends
I see my parents, they're as young as me
They're at the ball field looking so healthy

[Repeat chorus]

Close your eyes (Close your eyes)
Your dreams come true (Close your eyes)
They come true...
