[Comprix / Owens]

Powerless you will be
There is no one to set you free
Falling in, bleeding through
Living inside of your prison

[Chorus:]
Your time has come
you cannot run

In your mind you are right
And yet you stand there with no fight
Verdicts read on this day
For it's your life you must pay

[Repeat chorus]

Why did you do this
You do not know
Fall on your knees
And pray to god

Is there justice in this world
Just look around, you tell me
What do you see
Out there, all around
There seems to be a problem
The world it's not what it used to be
Please, tell me, tell me
Please, I just want to know the answer
