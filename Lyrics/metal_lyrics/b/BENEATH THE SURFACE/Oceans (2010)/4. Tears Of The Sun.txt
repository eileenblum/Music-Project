So this is how it feels to know your life's not real.
I guess it's not so bad to lose what you never had.
I've been waiting for this for so long.
I've been waiting for you for so long.

I can't tell if I've gotten used to this or just given up.
And now I'm killing in my sleep.
Sleep.

Are you ready to taste the sun?
You better fucking run. [x2]

Am I just a dream to you now?
Maybe I'll survive this somehow.
Suddenly your face is empty.
You kill me like you don't even know me.
Bury me where I can see you.
Bury me where I can be you.
Thoughts wash away into a sea of me.
Thoughts wash away into a sea that's never full.
Thoughts wash away into a sea of me.
Bury me where I can see you.
Bury me where I can be you.
If I left you alone today.
I'd always be just a fucking whisper away.
