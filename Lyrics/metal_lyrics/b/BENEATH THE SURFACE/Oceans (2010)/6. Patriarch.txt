I know what you did.

I can barely remember.
You're not going to tell me what I want to hear.
Did you think I would believe you? [x2]
Every time you look at me, I see what I need to see.
You are not better than me. I guess it's not meant to be.
Every time you look at me, I see what I need to see.
You are not better than me. I guess it's not meant to be.
Fuck!
