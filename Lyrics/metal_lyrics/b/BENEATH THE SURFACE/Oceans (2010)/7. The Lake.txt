I thought about what you said the whole fucking day.
It's like washing blood down the sink, it never really goes away.
Sometimes life spits in your face, without ever leaving a trace. [x4]
Look alive, I know you've tried hard to have a spine. But you were born ugly.
Looks aside, I think it's time you were shown that sometimes it's actually your fault.
Lessons not learned in blood are soon forgotten and I have a feeling that this will end badly. [x4]
Just like today, life was here to stay.
I'm not so sure.
It seems like such a waste.
But not today.
I gave my life away.
And I can't keep these thoughts at bay. [x2]
We all will fall into the lake and we all will become architecture. [x4]
I've fallen into the lake. [x2]
Drowning with broken necks.
The head falls below the chest.
Drowning with broken necks.
The head falls below the chest.
