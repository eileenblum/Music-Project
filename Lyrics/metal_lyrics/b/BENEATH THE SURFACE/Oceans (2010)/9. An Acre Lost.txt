Now I'm insane.
There's not a chance in hell that I would stay.

I used to feel so alive.
Now I feel as if, I feel as if I have died.
Isn't that tragic?
Now I feel as if, I feel as if I have died.
Isn't that tragic?

I'm sorry it had to be, had to be this way.
Now maybe you understand just what you sound like.
I'm sorry it had to be, had to be this way.
Sinking.
Why am I always sinking?
I feel like I'm sinking.
Why am I always sinking?
I feel like I'm sinking.
Why am I always sinking?
I feel like I'm sinking.
Why am I always sinking?
I feel like I'm sinking.
Sinking.
