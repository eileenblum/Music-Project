Needing to get my feet onto solid ground or needing my ears to hear that fucking sound.
Falling away from every trace of sanity, I can't believe it got this bad in the first place.
If I really meant half the things I said, you would be dead.
You should have learned to swim before you jumped into the sea. Now you're just as good as dead. [x2]
I know one day I'm gonna regret it all.
But at least I know what I'm getting myself into.
I don't care who you are.
I don't care who you've been.
I'd sleep better at night knowing the world was fake.
But it doesn't matter because I can't sleep and my head is pounding.
When it rains it pours.
Its the only thing that makes me feel alive, and I intend to keep doing it.
Frozen to the bone and I can't fucking move.
I can't feel my face.
Burning to feel the sun one last time before I'm too old to even care anymore.
There will be a day when you are engulfed in flames.
