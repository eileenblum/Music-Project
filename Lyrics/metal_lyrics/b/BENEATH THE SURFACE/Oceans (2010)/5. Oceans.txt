Taken back before the situation I have laid out in front of me. I never thought that it would come to this.
The color of my dreams helps me to see.
Helps me to see.
You wanna feel like you used to feel.
I wanna be who I used to be, but I can't connect with reality anymore.
I've been losing touch since I learned how to feel anything. [x2]
I'm so far away from where I should be.
I'm so far away from where I was.
I'm so far away from where I should be.
I'm so far away from where I was.
Where are my eyes?
I can't see the sunset.
I'm so far away from where I was.
I don't even recognize you. What is your name? [x2]
Where have you gone? What have I done?
I don't even recognize you. What is your name?
