On the ground beneath my feet lies a current that takes me away and now that ive looked back on my life so far and taken in thoughts that remind how you could feel so alone in such a place where you cant even see ten feet in front of you but then again nothings what it seems.
These skies that were once filled with the hopes of millions are now weighing down on my Shoulders.
As the sun sets my last hope dies ive been betrayed by the sun.
Ive been betrayed by the sun once again my hopes die with it, it kills me that i didnt see this before You took me down it kills me that i didnt see this.
