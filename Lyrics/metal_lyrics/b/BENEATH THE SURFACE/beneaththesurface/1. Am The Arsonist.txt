If this is coming as a shock to you its my own fault because my lips were sealed.
I feel like i cant, cant say the things i need to say.
I guess i never really said the things i needed to say. 
deny these lies that youve been fed, they still run through my head.
I know youve built this bridge brick by brick but now this bridge needs to BURN!
Burn this fucking bridge, i am the arsonist.
The ash from the fire will touch the sky.
The ash from this fire will set ablaze.
There is just one more thing that i need to get off my chest.
There is just one more thing that need to say.
There is just one more thing that i have to say.
Clearly you dont know me.
