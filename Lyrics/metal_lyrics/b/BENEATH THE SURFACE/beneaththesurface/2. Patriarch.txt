My words will never convey thoughts you need to hear me say.
I was so much better off without you.
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID!
Look at me, let me see (your face).
What was I trying to say? I cant even remember.
Who are you anyways?
I can barely remember.
You're not going to tell me what i want to hear.
Did you think I would believe you?
EVERYTIME YOU LOOK AT ME, I SEE WHAT I NEED TO SEE. YOU ARE NOT BETTER THAN ME, I GUESS ITS NOT MEANT TO BE.
