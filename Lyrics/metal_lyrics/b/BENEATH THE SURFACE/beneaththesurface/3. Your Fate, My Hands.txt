You act like this has just begun but we know youve been at this game for much too long, you sacrificed your name.
This ends here and now cause im fucking done.
I see through your lies like the moon through the sun. I found myself with my finger on the trigger.
I wont stray from this path, your fate is in my hands.
I wont stray from this path that ive been on for so long.
I wont stray from this path.
When did failure become the norm?
Its everywhere regardless of shape or form.
This ends here and now cause im fucking done.
I see through your lies like the moon through the sun.
Stop crying your eyes out if you want to keep them.
