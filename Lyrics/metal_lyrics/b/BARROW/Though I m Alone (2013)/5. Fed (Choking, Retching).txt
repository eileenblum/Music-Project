Feast your eyes, this is the breadth of life. When we canât feed ourselves we eat each other alive. Weâre all guilty of waiting and wanting; burning alive, destined for nothing. I feel the flames beneath my feet as I take steps away. Weâre all guilty of waiting and
wanting; burning alive, destined for nothing, but weeping, gnashing of teeth. Believe. Repent. Evolve. Regret. If my shame didnât fit, now Iâve grown into it; threads sewn together by years of nescience. Negligent philistine, son of tradition, child of pages, raised for
contrition. You just keep draining my blood. Every one of you, draining my blood.
