How many years will I miss? Will the days miss me, too, as I pass them by? Am I you to your father now? Itâs the most I could ask for. Iâm grateful, even in leaving. Iâm not alone any more. I promise. I try to stay happy, but the future fights back. Am I you to your
father now? Itâs the most I could ask for. Iâm grateful, even in leaving, but I donât want to be the one to brush the dust from your hands, hoping that one day I can be a better man.
