âCertainty,â we are told, âis a luxury granted to few through instruction.â Nothing has ever been sacred, holy, set apart. Never. Spoon-fed, force-fed watered down âwisdomâ espousing the status quo. I only exist as I am rendered; apostate, shaped in the eyes of tradition
as little more than the yield of misgivings. This system: âblessed,â âedifying,â mocking the worth in words. Is there a shape of failure fitting perfectly to form? This soil is cursed, we continue to sow it. Our bodies have withered in time for the harvest. Is there a
shape of failure fitting perfectly to form? Will I mold to your ideals or do I get to keep my own? Why should I gather everything to fill a box of empty space? Iâm collapsing as you fill me with your bastard sense of grace. Every fleeting notion is a burden left to bear,
an educated filter for breathing stagnant air. Weâre forgotten, abstraction, novelty, worthless, always imperfect. The death of purpose.
