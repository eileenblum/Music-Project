Thereâs a smile that I wish I could find; just a whisper in the current left listless and undefined. Youâre still the apparition on the backs of my eyes; an uncertain dissonance humming onward as I seek sleep. Sleep for myself, itâs yours if you need it, but the dawn
wonât allow us to keep it. Iâll keep talking until you finish my sentences; you always do. I keep finding myself floating on waves of silent disagreement, illustrating my own insensitivities. Iâll swallow my pride if my stomach can hold it. You can cut me back open. Is
it wrong to say that Iâve been praying softly Iâll go first? Iâm still coping with where love goes when weâre sleeping in the dirt. Iâll bury you in orchids hoping heartlessly to bloom. Iâll dread the hours left as sunlight sneaks into our room. Iâll pack our lives in
paper, tell my friends that Iâll be fine. Iâll burn our memories in silence just so nothingâs left behind. Iâll keep your image in my eyelids and your voice inside my head. Iâm still sorry for the things Iâve never done and never said. The ground is littered with the
remnants of remembrance. There will be no memorial; no monument made. We will only receive but passing glances. Our fingers, intertwined, breaking away, we are painfully aware that there is nothing left.
