Where can I find a shred of light throughout this desolation? It all ends the same. I donât know if I can be there to lead the procession home. Not me. Not anyone. Not me. How many years will I miss? Days? Weeks? Nothing youâve said is forgotten, tainted, rusted away.
Iâll carry you with me. Iâm not alone any more. I promise. Itâs just sometimes I canât stay happy, though I swear Iâm still the same. Am I you to your father now? Do we smother the ash in your hair? Itâs just worry, weary and weathered, bent through my heart like a
stake. Am I you to your father now? Iâm anxious, unraveled. Iâll take your words to heart before I carve them into a stone. And what of my children? How well will they know you? I hope that they can see even half of what I do. Time always proves toxic; weâre resilient in
youth, but now Iâm left praying that age will wait for you. I donât want to be the one to brush the dust from your hands, hoping that one day I can be a better man.
