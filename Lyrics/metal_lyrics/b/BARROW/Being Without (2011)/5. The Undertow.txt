I called upon my demons and this is what they said: âHeed the words that we bring forth, do your worst until youâre dead. Write their names upon your hands and fill their lungs and hearts with lead. Youth is teeming with its offers, guide its body to your bed. Adopt the
dreadful ways of others and the hatred they have bred. Cleanse your weary head of innocence while their integrity is bled. Gently pulsing on with anger, leaving every mouth unfed. Cut the hand from either arm before its acts can reach your head.â
I subsided on skin and smoke, attaching my attention to a false and fleeting feeling, seeking anything appealing for a momentâs time. And I keep slipping through every phrase, tearing through page after page, the structure has amended, but the cadence hasnât changed. I
was guilty, envious and venomous. My body was amphibious, my mind was feigning innocence. I was swept under the current of my own naivetÃ©, taken aback by crimes against conscience unconsciously.
