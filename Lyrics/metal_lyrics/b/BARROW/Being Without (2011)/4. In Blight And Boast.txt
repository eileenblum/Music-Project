With our bodies broken to the bone, buried from death, fossilized into stone -- and these stones that we use to build our homes, we all seek it, oh, we all know that we reap what we sow. And with our hearts altered by decay from the weight of our love deviating to shame,
every anoxic thought bleating to disdain, carbonized coal to fuel our necrotic state. As we survey along each surface and shovel through all the grime and the dirt, excavating every notion to understand that we threw out the gems with all of the pain and the hurt. Every
feeling suppressed came seeping through our skin and our teeth and at the washing of the tide we are preserved by replacing cognition with a sense of vacuity. Should I prepare my fragments and polished cases? Should I burn the coal I've made? Broken down. The choices
that we've made in the past will show themselves as our bodies and feelings erode away with time. Our many transgressions will come to light as we reinterpret our lives. I don't want to feel this way any more, collapsing night after night, pressing my face to the floor.
I've been a mess since the moment you left, leaving my heart in shambles, I'm emotion bereft. Refining the ruin that we've made, proclaiming innocence with ill intent. Still hiding from errors all the same, we should know we'll reap what we sow. We all know we'll reap
what we sow.
