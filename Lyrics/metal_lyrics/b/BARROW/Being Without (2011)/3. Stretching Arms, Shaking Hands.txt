Returning glances to black-patterned eyelids. Demeaning slowly with self-centered silence. Lead me into my own abyss. [...] I can feel the shadow of your hand creeping up every single inch of my body. You have nothing to offer. You are nothing to me. Nothing remains, but
a matter of duplicity. How long do I have to wander? I've felt the fear and cold, but you still have your hold. An apparition to ponder; your form, it breathes deceit. Your touch has branded me. You have led me through night after night of misguided thoughts and lack of
direction. I have become yours, you have become mine. Intervention. Failure. Remorse. Your foundation is shaken with every laugh, every smile, every institution of confidence. You will be evicted from a home that was never your own. Each one of these eyes seeks out a
different conclusion.
