I couldn't feel it building up beneath me. There you were with that look upon your face and that gasp upon your breath. These hands weren't meant to hurt. This is a testament to loathing all of the things that I have said, that I have done, that I have made. I couldn't
hold it in. I can't take it back. Bursting, vulgar, ruminate the aftermath.
