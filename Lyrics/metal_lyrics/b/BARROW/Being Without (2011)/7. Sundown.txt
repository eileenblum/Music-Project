Crowded and white, avoiding all intrusion. Hiding at night, lights in the walls and noise under blankets. I couldn't bear to believe this moral self-abandonment, crushing inclinations and the things we once held fast. Loyalties are on a steady decline, plummeting below
the most animalistic nature. These ever-swirling signals are still a sign of distress. I saw myself last night, discontented with unfamiliarity and the people we've become. I'm tired of hiding in a place where I should be comfortable. I've been sinking for too long,
burdened with disdain. I'm at the bottom. I've traded my will for this shell of a body.
