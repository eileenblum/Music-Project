You've always said that this should be a sanctuary and I know you've kept your word. As I find my actions falling short, I'll keep the lessons I have learned. These streets remain so familiar, memories lingering in their quiet, bewildering nature. Beneath my feet are the
crumbled remains of fall growing colder. These ambitions are keeping me young, evoking childlike wonder. Where has the time gone? Where do the days go when they leave us? I've left so much behind, but home is where my heart is.
