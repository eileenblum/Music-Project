Further, you only wish to sway and pull and harm. Further, for I will keep her safe within my arms. Lover, could you not keep to the love you swore? I have made your face into something that I can't stand to see. Pacing from the side vinyl to the door, across your
ash-stained balcony. And the same way I had let this birth I will let this die, and you will become just another body I will use to waste my time. You are just a body that I will use to waste my time. You are just a plague. [...] If truth is found in innocence then words
are meant to keep, but the weight of comfort is too much and I am just too weak to hold to the love you swore. The weight of truth, the love you brought wasn't love enough for me to hold to the love you swore to me. I have seen a greater light than a body within my bed,
naked from the warmth of a love within my head.
