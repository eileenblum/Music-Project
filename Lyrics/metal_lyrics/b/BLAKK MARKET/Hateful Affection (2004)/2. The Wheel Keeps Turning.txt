[F. Melleu / F. Chiella]

Twisted world insane
As rotten as it gets
You shouldn't play the game
If you can't afford the bet

Better not to be the king
Keep yourself small
Strike them suddenly
Wait to see them fall

So as the winter came we thought (of) someone to blame
Autumn starts to rise - Perennial meets demise
You better know our name - We're different yet the same
We'll remain strong no matter if right or wrong
Time does not heal those things that are concealed
From ash we rise again - it wasn't all in vain
In time you'll realize - We're part of the same crime
Don't think that we are gone... Existence isn't done... yet

[Chorus:]
One World, Four Seasons
And this must be the reason
Why things change
But somehow they remain
Our spring just passed
But it will return at last
The wheel keeps turning!
Someday you'll end up learning this

You don't have the right to be
You are just trash to me
And still you think you are better than us
In the end we'll throw your name in the dust
I will not let you live!

Don't fool yourself cause you're not fooling me
Your world will soon cease to be... (cease to be!)
True kings are made by the strength in their blood
Pawns left adrift in the flood

Winners of pain - When loss is gain
The Wheel Keeps Turning...

Now you dwell in sorrow
Only grief and pain!
But all could change tomorrow!
Back to yesterday!

Once they close the curtains
The show comes to an end
Only death is certain
You better make your stand
