[F. Melleu]

When there's no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth
Seeking for more victims and waiting their rebirth
As the night is falling and the moon is burning red
Await for the Aurora of the End - The dawn of the Dead!

Silent like the wind they came
The ones that cannot die!
Suddenly they kill and maim
Is "it" Dead or is alive?

More and more, the lifeless Zombies
Are rising from their graves
I Can't believe in such unreal sight
Death's triumph over Life!

When there's no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth
Seeking for more victims and waiting their rebirth
As the night is falling the moon is burning red
Await for the Aurora of the End - The dawn of the Dead!

Try to run or hide from an almost certain fate
The living dead arise maybe it's too late...

Hordes of monsters flood the streets
Spreading panic and fear
Authorities are broken and hopeless
As chaos reigns the world!

As the Undead Legions grow
Society seems condemned
The end is near to all humanity
That walks towards insanity

[SOLO Rocha]

[LEAD Schneider]

Take a Look at the rotten carcass
Arising from the ground!
Faces that once you knew
And now they Hunt you down!

I don t know about life
And it's twisted meaning
I only know for sure
That death is just the beginning!

When there's no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth
Seeking for more victims!
