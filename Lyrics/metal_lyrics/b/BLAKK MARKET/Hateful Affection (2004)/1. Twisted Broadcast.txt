[T. Rocha / F. Melleu / A. Schneider]

There seems to be
A great thing in the media nowadays
A thirst for the wicked
A hunger for decay

Pre-manufactured instant success - I want more!
Dirt is everywhere around
Closer than you ever thought

Build our ratings into lies
"What's wrong with these artificial lives?"
A distorted copycat
Of the world's demise

A circus of forged realities - selling pain!
We keep the royalties
Of human disdain

[Chorus:]
Shut up! We're running out of time
Freak shows on channels 1 through 9

People are attuned to the morbid and bizarre
When you watch our twisted broadcast you become part of this!
Do you feel pity for that sorrowed lad?
So be aware he is part of an act... (Like You)
Just part of an act... FUCK HIM!

"I'll pay you if you tell my tale and nobody needs to know..."
It's pretty easy if you think like that
Sit tight and join the show!
The show is over - get out and take your cash
You are no more than trash!

I'll pull the strings
And manipulate them through the screen
Who controls the prime time hour
Knows their thoughts and dreams

[Solos: Rocha / Schneider]

[Chorus:]
Shut up! We're running out of time
Freak shows on channels 1 through 9

People are attuned to the morbid and bizarre
When you watch our twisted broadcast you become part of this!
Do you feel pity for that sorrowed lad?
Do you grieve for that sorrowed lad?

NO!
