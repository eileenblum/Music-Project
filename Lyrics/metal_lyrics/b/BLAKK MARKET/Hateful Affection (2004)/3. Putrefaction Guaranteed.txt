[F. Melleu]

Do you believe that the day will come
When your soul will be gone?
Up to heaven or down to hell...
Who are them to tell?

Afterlife!
Standardized!
Just more lies!
To blind your eyes!

You have the right to remain in silence
You have the right to rot
Life is a trial, you'll be judged with violence
And now your hope is lost!

As the Maggots eat your flesh
your body's under nature's lash
Like all the things that grow and breed
The only sureness you'll ever need
Putrefaction Guaranteed!

Belief
It's just a waste of time
Don't think you're safe
By "Holy" bread and wine

Your destiny
It's sealed by nature's law
What's meant to be
At the crow's final caw

As the reaper comes, at your final hour
The certainty in life lies on the day you meet your death!
When he calls your name you soul will not remain!
Eternity inside the grave you slowly rot away!

Rot Away!

You have the right to remain in silence
You have the right to rot
Life is a trial. you'll be judged with violence
And now your hope is lost!

Trapped inside the coffin your body lies alone
The life you led meant nothing... this can not be undone!

[LEAD Rocha / Schneider]

Belief
It's just a waste of time
Don't think you're safe
By "Holy" bread and wine

Believe in what they say
And wait for "Judgment Day"
But you rot away!

You have the right to remain in silence
You have the right to rot
Life is a trial, you'll be judged with violence
And now your hope is lost!

As the Maggots eat your flesh
Your body's under nature's lash
Like all the things that grow and breed
The only sureness you'll ever need
Putrefaction Guaranteed!
