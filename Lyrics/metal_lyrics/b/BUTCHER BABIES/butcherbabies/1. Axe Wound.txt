I am not your savior
Get off your bended knee
You've fallen out of favor
Turned your back on what you believe

Yeah, you'll fall into a curse [2x]

[2x]
I am not your savior
I'm your Anti-Christ
Taking from your insides
To fall into a curse

I fell into your life
Like I fell into your lie
Yeah, you'll fall into a curse [2x]

Bow like a martyr
Sick off your own disease
Ask yourself what's this bed for
You dug your grave
It's 6 foot deep

You'll suffer with
All your kind
This nightmare
Is now your life
What's a girl
To do when
She's had enough of you
You'll suffer
With all your kind

[2x]
I am not your savior
I'm your Anti-Christ
Taking from your insides
To fall into a curse

Yeah, you'll fall into a curse [2x]

And now you're gonna run

[2x]
I fell into your life
Like I fell into your lies
You're running for your life

I fell into your lie [2x]

Yeah, you'll fall into a curse [2x]
