We tunnel
Just beneath the skin
White men in black suits
They say that its a sin
Your god inside me makes me your whore

Use your flesh as a weapon
Split at the seam
Make me your carrier for
Your American dream

Use your flesh as a weapon
Split at the seam
I'm not your carrier for
Your American dream

1.2.3.4

Jesus needs more babies for his little war machine [4x]

You show allegiance
Told we are free
Stripped of the law of choice its all just make believe

Bow to your savior
Pray for him to give
Ask him what he thinks
That wanted me to live

Use you flesh as a weapon
Split at the seam
Make me your carrier for
Your American dream

Jesus needs more babies for his little war machine [4x]

War machine [3x]

Have you seen my boy jack
I don't think hes coming back

Have you seen my boy jack
I don't think he'll ever come back (THEY WANT MORE!)

Have you seen my boy jack
I don't think hes coming back [2x]

LET'S GO!

Fight for your fathers
Fight for your sins
White men in black suits are clawing at your skin
'Cause they know

Flesh is a weapon
Split at the seam
Make me your carrier for
Your American dream

1.2.3.4

Jesus needs more babies for his little war machine [4x]

War machine! [3x]
