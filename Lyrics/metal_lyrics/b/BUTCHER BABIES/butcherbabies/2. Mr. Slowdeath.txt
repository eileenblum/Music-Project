All that gitters
Is Not, Was Not
But now lies face down in a street paved in gold
Different names and different games but the same old soul
Once, Twice, Three times sold.

Three times sold!

All that mattered
Is Not, Was Not
Steel toes crush dreams in a street paved in gold
You can cover your face but you cant erase all the lies you told
When you were Once, Twice, Three times sold.

Needle in my arm
Finger in my vein
Give me something to kill the pain
Needle in my arm
Finger in my vein
Give me something to kill the pain

Hey Mr. Slowdeath you're not coming back for me
Take it or leave it you're not coming back for me
Hey Mr. Slowdeath you're not coming back for me
Take it or leave it, you're not coming back for...

Take it or leave it, you're not coming back.. back.. back..
For me!

Needle in my arm
Finger in my vein
Give me something to kill the pain
Needle in my arm
Finger in my vein
Give me something to kill the pain
