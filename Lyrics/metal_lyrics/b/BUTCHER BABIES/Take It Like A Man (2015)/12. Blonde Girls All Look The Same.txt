[Rerecorded from Blonde Girls All Look The Same Single]Sheâs such a slut
Sheâll get more round to the face
Donât think that you can take my place
Iâd consider killing
Iâd consider killing you, if I thought you were alive
On Fanuel Street
So you see, yeah I wanna kill you
So you see, yeah Iâm gonna kill
Youâre such a cunt, you took a fucking wrong turn
Thereâll be a lesson to learn

Lie again, I dare you to
Open your mouth and tell the truth
Whatâs gonna be your famous last words
Iâll give you that but, you donât fucking deserve Me Me
You donât deserve me

Show off you little bitch
Itâs just a circle of friends
Show off you little bitch
As I watch your pedestal burn

All dressed in white you turned it red
Piece by piece your clothes hit the floor
You make me sick
Did she like it rough? Did you fill it in her mouth?
From behind did her fucking five head shine?
Take it. Take it all you fucking slut

Lie again, I dare you to
Open up your mouth and tell the truth
Whatâs gonna be your famous last words
Iâll give you that but, you donât fucking deserve Me Me Me

Youâre such a mother fucker, everybodyâs gonna learn
Your god dam piece of shit cover is blown
Youâre such a mother fucker, everybodyâs gonna learn
Your god damn piece of shit cover is blown
