Ladies and Gentlemen, children of all ages
Step right up and get your tickets to the greatest show on earth
Where you'll witness death defying feats and acts of whisky Guzzling debauchery
I wanna see you

So get the fuck up!

Itâs high noon when you step into the pit
Itâs a monster's ball and their digging a ditch
For the sunburnt the weary, the ones who won't last
In this cyclone of flesh with this cathartic mix

When the broken limbs are leading the match
Itâs the ring masters itch weâre amassed to scratch
With the crack of the whip the carnies rush in to devour
The beast that beats on drums of flesh

Blistered embattled
You fall to submission
To complete the mission
You rally and rise
2-3-4

Slack-jawed and entranced your torched by the sun
You've caught the fever
The day's just begun to burn. Ya!

No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop
This monster's ball
Can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop
This monster's ball

Hey you there in the neo-thrash prog math whatever metal shirt
And cut off jeans trying to sneak away don't leave yet
The best part of the show is just about to begin
Itâs not over till the pretty ladies scream!

So get the fuck up!

Brothers in arms we shake our devil sticks
Together as we climb walls of jagged bones together
As you float away on a bed a callused hands
With the crest in sight now itâs time to go

Over the edge, you take a decadent fall
Behind the velvet rope you join the men on stilts
The juggler winks and throws you a ball
Before you know it you're part of it all

No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop
This monster's ball
Can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop
This monster's ball

Ladies and Gentlemen
Step right up and get your tickets
To the greatest show on earth

We've never felt this free
When Iâm stepping blindly
Cause weâve never been so free
My Acrobatic Army

Ladies and Gentlemen

Can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop
Can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop

Can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop

Can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop

No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop
This monster's ball
Can't stop moving
No you can't stop moving
No you can't stop
This monster's ball
