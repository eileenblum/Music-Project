Sorry to disappoint you
But you canât even grasp what Iâve been through
In the end, youâve engraved this in my head
You taught me to be dead
Do you even know what you said
Remember when I closed my eyes and took my last breath
By the grasp of your hand clinched right around my neck
So you made me this will, you created this mistake
You tried to put me away with every blow I would take
But I grew up now and Iâm sorry to say
Iâm exactly like you
A fucking mistake

Sorry to humiliate you
But they have never felt dead like I do
Tore out my insides, left me to die
I crawled like a dog to save my own life
Sorry to disappoint you
But you canât even grasp what Iâve been through
They are me alive they ate me alive
I curled up and died because they ate me alive

Where were you when I learned to take it like a man
Where were you when I learned to stand
Where were you when I learned to take it like a man

Dead man walking
Chipping at my soul and taking it in slow
Heâs dead man walking
Circles in my head I swear
Now I can say that I know what itâs like to play dead
And I still see your twitching ghost
When Iâm looking in the mirror
Do you see mine
We are one in the same, I swear
Now I can say that I know what itâs like to play
Dead man walking

Sorry to repulse you
But you have never fought like I do
Forgot how to cry, learned how lie
I put you away to the back of my mind
Sorry to disgust you
But you canât even taste what Iâve been through
They are me alive they ate me alive
I curled up and died cause they ate me alive
