Can you taste it, the sweat and suffering
We salivate for the kill
We will not ever quit, 10,000 marching boots in the pit
Itâs time to take off the masks
Remove the knives from our back

We fight
They try to hold us down
They try to push us down
We wonât let them
Fight
Rise from the underground
We wonât be pushed around
We wonât let them
Break us
We wonât let them
Break us

Can you feel the ground pulsing under you
Now weâve unsettled the dust
We will not take your shit
10,000 marching boots in the pit
Itâs time to take a stand cause they canât break us

We wonât let them
We wonât let them
We wonât let them
Break us

Weâre taking control
And the only thing we know is that it isnât going to be pretty
Weâre taking control
And the only thing we know is we wonât stop
They canât take us, break us, stand in our way
Weâre taking control
And the only thing we know is we wonât stop
