I pull my hair at night, motherfucker
My dreams they swallow me whole
And take me to faraway places, places that Iâll never go
Where gangs of this faceless cry, so bloody eyeless red
Theyâre chasing after me
And Iâm swimming in a poll of the blood they shed

Itâs a fucked up time to be alive

Itâs a fucked up way to get clean
And the bloods not stopping
Itâs a fucked up thing to believe
But you better believe me

Shadows juxtaposed and raw
Paradox has become the law
Destruction comes our way
Everyone is lost not a one can be saved
Donât mourn the quiet ones as they die
Laugh at the silencers
What will we learn when every human scream is heard?

Now Iâm tasting every drop of blood that they bled for me
Iâll be burning every inch of skin that they gave to me
Now Iâm consuming every twisted truth that they fed to me
Iâll be purging every fallacy theyâve injected into me

By the book of the butcher
I was meant to bring it to her
With the knife held strong and steady
The silence was so deafening
I could only hear Ed singing his praises
Of what he made me

This violence is golden a calming breath pre kill
Exhale as the knife cuts through the skin
Ed came to me to satisfy his dying wish
