(For the love of it) Give it up
(For the love of it) Just stop
Would you say that we are even now
I won't save you, like you want me too
You won't break me, like I need you too
And for the love of it, let's give it up

You bring me down so low, I think I'm dying (I'll never go back)
You lift me up so high, I can't survive it

I swear I'll never go back, I'll never go back
But I always go back to you
You are the one, your my only weakness
The wrong that I keep repeating
(I tell myself I'm through) 
But I always go back to you
(I'll never go back, I'll never go back)
(So were through)
I am never free from you
(I'll never go back, I'll never go back)

Your always my mistake (I'm hopeless)
Just one big mistake (I make)
This is where I'll sake my final battle
I can't fake this, like you want me too
You can't me fix me, I'm broken in two
Just one big mistake, I'm giving up

You bring me down so low, I think I'm dying (I'll never go back)
You lift me up so high, I can't survive it

I swear I'll never go back, I'll never go back
But I always go back to you
You are the one, your my only weakness
The wrong that I keep repeating
(I tell myself I'm through) 
But I always go back to you
(I'll never go back, I'll never go back)
(So were through)
I am never free from you
(I'll never go back, I'll never go back)

I'll never go back, I'll never go
Twisted and deeper
You're the only ones in my head
The world is my witness
I swear I'll never do it again, never do it again
I always go back to you

I swear I'll never go back, I'll never go back
But I always go back to you
You are the one, your my only weakness
The wrong that I keep repeating
(I tell myself I'm through) 
But I always go back to you
(I'll never go back, I'll never go back)
(So were through)
I am never free from you
(I'll never go back, I'll never go back)
