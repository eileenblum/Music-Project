Some days I bite my tongue right off
This rage is all I know
Saves me from being alone
I am an animal wounded by life
You want me to calm down but you gave me this knife

Now Iâm at odds with myself and war with the rest and
Now it rips me it fucks me it tears me apart
Just one push and I will ignite
This coiled up anger on you
So be my guest

Stand down, itâs my game and I say youâll burn out
Your time is on loan
Silence your bullshit, your voice I despise
Donât say another word, you hemorrhage lies

It rips me
Iâm at odds with myself and at war with the rest
It fucks me
Iâm at odds with myself and at war with the rest
It tears me apart
Iâm at odds with myself and at war

Iâm an apathetic monster controlled by my TV
With an itchy trigger finger
Cause this violence consumes me
Iâm an apathetic monster controlled by my TV
With an itchy trigger finger
Cause this violence consumes me
