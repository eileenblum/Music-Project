I am a grave maker you are all bleeding together
Your eyes, limbs, words
I canât be, I wonât be your
A twisted pile of metal in my head
Iâm tied to your fascist mold
I canât be, wonât be your god
You wanted a god? Well, hereâs your god
You wanted a god? Well, hereâs your god

Bent over bleeding
And my skin is crawling with leeches
From slumming theyâre feeding off my name
Exiled from my mind to hide the faces inside

Iâll drag you to hell with me
Iâll drag you to hell
Iâll drag you to hell
To hell with me

I am a casualty stripped of my cage
Extracting each vein to fit in
I canât be, I wonât be your
Scratched from behind your pulling my nerves
From inside to cover your sins
Tear off my skin, make me bleed
I canât be, I wonât be your god
You wanted a god? Well, hereâs your god
You wanted a god? Well, hereâs your god

âTherefore, brethren, I call upon you, through the
Compassions and mercies of God, to present your bodies
A sacrifice â living, sanctified, acceptable to God
-- your intelligent, spiritual serviceâ

I canât fix your human tragedy as Iâm your victim
I canât be the leash you want me to be when Iâm constricted
I wonât be your god! I canât be your god! I wonât be your god!
Iâm not your fucking god!
