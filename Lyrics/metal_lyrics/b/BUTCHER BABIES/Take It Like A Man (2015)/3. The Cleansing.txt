Weâre slowly twitching to the fire that burns but plays dead
Stand aside and watch us burn
Break down the walls weâve made
Oh! Break! Down the walls weâve made
Break!
Donât say anything cause anything could burn the flame out cold
The screaming voices in your head, just silent sounds ignored

And Iâm telling you that this will be the last time

And Iâll wash my hands of this
We built these walls
We built them for protection
Just to crumble to my feet
We built these walls
We built them for protection
In the end Iâll be the one whoâs killing me
Itâs killing me! Itâs killing me! Itâs killing me!

Forget about that fire we lit, unmask that lifeless face
Weâve cooked and burned from limb to limb
Trapped in this iron cage
A game for the fallen
A song for the sullen
Stand aside and watch us burn
Break all the walls weâve made
Oh! Break! Down the walls weâve made
Break down
