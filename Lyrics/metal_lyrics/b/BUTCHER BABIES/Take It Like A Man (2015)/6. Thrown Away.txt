Somewhere out in space Iâve lost myself, Iâve been misplaced
Somehow thrown away
Iâve grown allergic to an image, fractured by an idea
Iâve been thrown away

Letâs make believe that these walls could sing
Theyâd open up and theyâd welcome me in
But in the end Iâd know itâs been a dream
Letâs make believe that these shadows screamed
Theyâd reach out theyâd hold on to me
But in the end Iâd know itâs been a dream

I walk these streets like a phantom limb
I should belong but I donât fit in
I feel Iâve been thrown away
Iâve tried to make myself better, tried every pill
I will burn everything when I feel threatened
I fear in empty space

Slow down, please donât throw me away
With each step towards regret I know Iâve done it to myself
Slow down, donât forget me
Iâve tried to push the blame but Iâve done it to myself
