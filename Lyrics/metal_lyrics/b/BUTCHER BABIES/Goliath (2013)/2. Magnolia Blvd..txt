This city creeps
In it's disease
Hung by a thread
And no one can hear you scream

Woke up on the south side of nowhere
All I am is a foreign face
Tortured ripped out at the core
Caught up in Hell's revolving door
Stumble around with eyes glazed over
Prize was lost
Nothing left to show for
Too close caught up in the flame
Reaching out for the slaved and maimed

Gone away
The dreams you breed have just decayed
Strayed away
You came here looking for a name

No place, like home

[2x]
This city creeps down the alleys of disease
When you're hanging by a thread 
And no one can hear you scream

Beneath the cloud of dust they
Surface with deep defacing cuts
Time rips by when you're sick
Wanna make it last well take your pick
Shattered dreams is all that remains
All those things that you can't regain
Last chance you're caught up in the scene
Ingest and gorge this empty city

Gone away
The dreams you breed have just decayed
Strayed away
You came here looking for a name

No place, like home

[2x]
This city creeps down the alleys of disease
When you're hanging by a thread 
And no one can hear you scream

Scream, Scream, Scream

These streets are devastated
Your path has lead you astray
Stomped and battered
The legacy is fading
Left to the vagrants in your wake
Stomped and Battered

[2x]
No one can hear you scream

[2x]
This city creeps down the alleys of disease
When you're hanging by a thread 
And no one can hear you scream
No one can hear you scream
