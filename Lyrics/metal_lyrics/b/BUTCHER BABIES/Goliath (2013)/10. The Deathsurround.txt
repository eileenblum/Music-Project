Squeeze and hold
With my hands
Gripped tight
Around your neck
You breathe to me
But I'm born
And bled to feed this hit

Two left dead and I'm king
This monster preys on the weak

Trying to live but to win
Is to die here alone
The Deathsurround
proving your place
In the filth
To be cast from
Your thrown
The Deathsurround
I am the air that you breathe
The idol you see
Trying to live but to win
Is to die here alone
The Deathsurround

In this skin I've been
Playing the
Roll of the shape shifter
These walls cave in
Having to sleep with
Both eyes open

Forced my self extraction
This monster's coming undone

Trying to live but to win
Is to die here alone
The Deathsurround
proving your place
In the filth
To be cast from
Your thrown
The Deathsurround
I am the air that you breathe
The idol you see
Trying to live but to win
Is to die here alone
The Deathsurround

Oh God
Where did this monster come from
God did you think it would break me
Don't come any closer
I'll have my closure
I'll decide when you go

The deathsurround
Unchain the monster
Unchain!

Trying to live but to win
Is to die here alone
The Deathsurround
proving your place
In the filth
To be cast from
Your thrown
The Deathsurround
I am the air that you breathe
The idol you see
Trying to live but to win
Is to die here alone
The Deathsurround
