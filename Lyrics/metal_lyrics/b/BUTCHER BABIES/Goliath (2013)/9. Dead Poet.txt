She likens herself as
To one of the greats
But if you look in her eyes
All you see is hate
She screams her insecurities and
The foolish things she thinks
She's just a broken toy in
A land of make believe

You're dead inside
With no regret
When the lights go down
You're standing alone
Your dead inside
And there's no end
Left with nothing here
But your crown of thorns

Your fear is what I've suffocated
Your lie is what was fornicated
Your fear is what I've suffocated
Your lie is what was fornicated

Mother playing the game
Father playing the game
My lover always the same
But when you stand back and look
You are the only one to blame
Mother playing the game
Father playing the game
My lover always the same
But take a good hard look
You are the only one to blame

You're dead inside
With no regret
When the lights go down
You're standing alone
Your dead inside
And there's no end
Left with nothing here
But your crown of thorns

Each scar has a story where
They came from no one knows
Fabricating the past
Blow by blow
Where's the sense of reason
When does her run end
Cause when the lights go down
She's cold and dead

Your fear is what I've suffocated
Your lie is what was fornicated
Your fear is what I've suffocated
Your lie is what was fornicated

Mother playing the game
Father playing the game
My lover always the same
But when you stand back and look
You are the only one to blame
Mother playing the game
Father playing the game
My lover always the same
But take a good hard look
You are the only one to blame

You're living in fear
I'm living right here
You're living in fear
I'm living right here

[2x]
You smile at me like
A long lost friend
Extend your hand to mine
As if we could amend

Your fear is what I've suffocated
Your lie is what was fornicated

Mother playing the game
Father playing the game
My lover always the same
But when you stand back and look
You are the only one to blame
Mother playing the game
Father playing the game
My lover always the same
But take a good hard look
You are the only one to blame
