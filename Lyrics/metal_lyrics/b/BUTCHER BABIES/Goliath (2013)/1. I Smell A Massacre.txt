Hate me
I pull my hair by the fistful
Hate me
Spinning scissors like a pistol

You dare to say
That I'm forcefully insane
The truth remains
That you've kept me in a cage

[2x]
Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin

Save
Save yourself
This is straight war
The writing's on the wall

Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
Run
Run and hide
They're keeping score
They're never coming home now

Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
No one's safe here
Run for cover, go!

Love me
They talk in pointed whispers
Love me
While my fingers on a trigger

You gave away
All the things that kept you vain
Your progeny
It becomes your enemy

[2x]
Can't stop the beast in me
It's underneath my skin

Save
Save yourself
This is straight war
The writing's on the wall

Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
Run
Run and hide
They're keeping score
They're never coming home now

Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
No one's safe here
Run for cover, go!

[8x]
Run for cover!

Save
Save yourself
This is straight war
The writing's on the wall

Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
Run
Run and hide
They're keeping score
They're never coming home now

Here comes a massacre now
Brace for the massacre
No one's safe here
Run for cover!
No one's safe here
Run for cover, go!
