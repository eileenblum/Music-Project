Can I tell you what
I feel inside
Is it a place you
Feel you can hide
And every time that
I asked you what to say
You fucking lied to me
You know it's gonna
Be a long ride home
Forgetting the promise you made
Fuck the life you saved
You fucking cursed my name

We were gods 'till you forgot
Found someone else to take my spot
We were gods 'till you forgot
'Till you destroyed us
Behind your mask you had a plot
All your dreams I fucking bought
Somewhere in this web I'm caught
But you destroyed me

You know it's gonna be a long ride
And I'm telling you to stay inside
You know it's gonna be a long ride
And I'm telling you to stay inside

Take a look
What do you see
This mirror lies
It's killing me
Filled with what will never be
'Till you destroyed us
My reflection laughs at me
And all the things
I thought we'd be
This broken glass
Will make us bleed
But you destroyed me

You know it's gonna be a long ride
And I'm telling you to stay inside
You know it's gonna be a long ride
And I'm telling you to stay inside

[2x]
And if these feelings of remorse
Won't cut you I will

We were gods 'till you forgot
Found someone else to take my spot
We were gods 'till you forgot
'Till you destroyed me

You mean nothing to me

You know it's gonna be a long ride
And I'm telling you to stay inside
You know it's gonna be a long ride
And I'm telling you to stay inside

[4x]
If these feelings of remorse
Won't cut you I will

We were Gods
But you destroyed us
It's gonna be
It's gonna be a long ride
But you destroyed us
