Death creeps through the door
No one knows I'm here
I'm nameless and faceless as fear

13 Years it's been since
I buried this sin
Monkey on my back
Don't look you can't see
Through back alleys I creep
Where no mothers will weep
Hunting on the track
Don't look now you can't see

Who brought a knife to
To the gun fight

She screamed in bloody murder
Her limbs all turning numb
So numb

It's closing in
It's closing in

I know death is lurking
I feel it near
Through the screams
I can taste the fear
Calling out no one
Knows I'm here
I'm nameless faceless victim

Created Obsession
Studied torture and pain
Gathering what he'd need
To stalk the innocent prey

With his box of death he's
stealing her last breath
It's a heart attack
He's out to taste blood again

It's closing in
It's closing in

I know death is lurking
I feel it near
Through the screams
I can taste the fear
Calling out no one
Knows I'm here
I'm nameless faceless victim

[2x]
Death creeps through the door
No one knows I'm here
I'm nameless and faceless as fear

This sweat this fear
I know it's real
Close my eyes so I can't see
The last night of my life
I'm nameless
I'm faceless as fear
As fear

I know death is lurking
I feel it near
Through the screams
I can taste the fear
Calling out no one
Knows I'm here
I'm nameless faceless victim
