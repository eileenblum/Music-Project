Your smile is porcelain
And I wanna break
It with my fist
Dug this chain around my throat
I smell this place
And I'm back to being your dog

I'm fashioning the end
These thoughts of violence
This rope around your neck
These thoughts of violence
My knife stuck in your back
These thoughts of violence

Just one inch away
From murder
Your talk is cheap
Better heed to the warning
I've done it once
Trust I'll do it twice
Now recognize the warning

You're breeding
Scars with the
Same knife that started
This whole fight
Your proverbial
Finger in my face
To pull the trigger to my rage
To my rage
Pull the trigger to my rage
To my rage

I'm fashioning the end
These thoughts of violence
This rope around your neck
These thoughts of violence
My knife stuck in your back
These thoughts of violence

Just one inch away
From murder
Your talk is cheap
Better heed to the warning
I've done it once
Trust I'll do it twice
Now recognize the warning

Your palms are sweating
The knot is tightening
You're at the end of the
Rope about to sway
Pull the trigger to my rage
About to sway
Pull the trigger to my rage

I'm fashioning the end
These thoughts of violence
This rope around your neck
These thoughts of violence
My knife stuck in your back
These thoughts of violence

Just one inch away
From murder
Your talk is cheap
Better heed to the warning
I've done it once
Trust I'll do it twice
Now recognize the warning
