One change
One kill
These things you've
Lost all your sight
Night of regress
Your promise lost
Here tonight
Empty love lost
In one sweet moment of pride
One chance one kill
Six years forgotten in life

Goodbye my love these
Signs are strong
All bets are off
Let's call it a day
One chance
One kill
You gave it away

Hard to swallow
All these years
They meant nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
All these scars you gave to me
They meant nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
You're in denial [3x]

One fault
One slip
Regret is drawn on your face
No turning back
What was is now such a waste
Hardened by spite
The trust snuffed out by a lie
One fault one slip
Here's to the final goodbye

Goodbye my love these
Signs are strong
All bets are off
Let's call it a day
Last chance
Last stand
You gave it away

Hard to swallow
All these years
They meant nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
All these scars you gave to me
They meant nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
You're in denial [3x]

Denial!

Hard to swallow
All these years
They meant nothing
All these scars you gave to me
They meant nothing, nothing

Now let me tell you
That my giving
In return has been reserved
Just for you
And let me tell you when you
Watch me rise I did it all
In spite of you

Hard to swallow
All these years
They meant nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
All these scars you gave to me
They meant nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
You're in denial [6x]

Denial!
