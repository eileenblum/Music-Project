Give me reason
Give me reason
Give me reason
Reason!
Reason!

Too fast to kill
Moves against my will
Don't you ask for more
It'll come in full
Deadly sins have
Looked my way
One by one they're killing me
Always wanting
More and more
Give me reason
The strong will win
It's the number one sin
Your hate has
Judged the weak
To break them in

The spider in your vein
Controls the cancer in your brain

We were born to die
And this is how I try

It's my way to say goodbye

Give me reason
Give me reason
Give me reason
Crossed this path
I'm not looking back
Looking back

I have a death pact
With myself
Single barrel on the shelf
So let's make it real
Spin the fucking wheel

The spider in your vein
Controls the cancer in your brain

[4x]
Fantasy dreams
Forced down my throat
Hear me scream
Break the chains of this hold

[3x]
I have a death pact
With myself
Single barrel on the shelf
So let's make it real
Spin the fucking wheel

It's my way to say goodbye

Give me reason
Give me reason
Give me reason
Crossed this path
I'm not looking back
Looking back

Give me reason
Give me reason
Give me reason
