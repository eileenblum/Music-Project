Fuck fuck fuck fuck

Woke up in my car
Don't know where the fuck we are
What does that sing say? Fucking Pomona? Again?
Let's shake it off, let's get some coffee
A quad espresso, easy vanilla, extra ice, no cream, NO FUCKING CREAM!

Oh shit, look at my best friend, it's happening again
The fucking car won't start
What do I even have a corvette for?
I don't fucking know
Call a cab all the way back to LA
My phone is dead
FUCK! So is mine
Fuck it let's walk anyway...
Good 'cause we all know you need those extra steps

What in the world happened last night?

We drank it all
We smoked it all
We danced it off till the boys went home
We lost the keys
We found the cops
Got summer jobs
At least I think so

Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck fuck fuck fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck fuck fuck fuck
Shit
Shit
Shit
Shit shit shit shit
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck fuck fuck fuck

Please tell me you remember something
I upgraded my neuro-processor and checked my penile gland
I got myself some ass implants and even got a tan (It's Friday again)
Here comes that dipshit Jimmy in his stupid fucking Jeep
"Hey bitches, what a ride?"
Not if we have to do what we did last time (I hate Monopoly)

Oh my god dude, you got a tattoo?
Wait dude, so did you?
What? What is it?
It says "Jimmy!"
What does mine say?
It says "Jimmy!"
No not Jimmy!!!!
No
Fuck
Fuck
Not Jimmy
Fuck

Why does this always happen to us?

We drank it all
We smoked it all
We danced it off 'til the boys went home
We lost the keys
We found the cops
Got summer jobs
At least I think so

Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck you Jimmy
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck you Jimmy
Shit
Shit
Shit
Shit on Jimmy
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck you Jimmy

Pomona
Fucking Pomona
Always Pomona
Fucking Pomona

Can somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?
Dude, fuck if I know
