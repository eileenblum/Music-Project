What big eyes
I know he's watching
What sharp teeth
I know he's hungry
I can taste him smell him on my skin

He hunts me down
Down on my knees
He wants me now
Now that I bleed for him
We'll drown
Forcing me
He wants me down
Down on my knees
He hunts me

What strong hands
It's how he binds me
What tight reigns
His word controls me
He can chase, but two can play this game

He hunts me down
Down on my knees
He wants me now
Now that I bleed for him
We'll drown
Forcing me
He wants me down
Down on my knees
He hunts me
He hunts me
He hunts me

He hunts me

Go on and taste me
Taste me
As we slowly waste away
I'll waste you
As we slowly fade away
This is my game
Go on and chase me
I'll chase you
I'll erase you from my mind
Erase you
This is my game now

He hunts me down
Down on my knees
He wants me now
Now that I bleed for him
We'll drown
Forcing me
He wants me down
Down on my knees
He hunts me
He hunts me
