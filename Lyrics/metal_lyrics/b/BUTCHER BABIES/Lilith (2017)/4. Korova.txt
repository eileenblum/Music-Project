Seems like forever you've been feeding me these nightmares, dearest friend
Just to be the one that saves when I scream 'cause you're my only friend
No I'm a hollow man

Run the night past the dogs that snarl and bight
My cow, korova, come with me
Guns are drawn bright against the snow they shine
My cow, korova, come with me

We can live forever
But if we die, we die together
Run with me
Run with me

Look me in the eyes
Tell me, who is your friend who is your enemy
You have no friends among the capitalists
You have no enemies among the workers
Friend? Now I'm your enemy
Simple hearted trusting man, hold my hand
Now liberate me

Now it's clear you were never human at all
My cow, korova, come with me
My salvation brought with me to take the fall
My cow, korova, come with me

We can live forever
But if we die, we die together
Run with me
Run with me
Set it all on fire
If we burn, we burn together
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me

I won't forget the night you arrived
Swollen with fear
I had to have you
My korova
Korova
My korova

Run through the night
Run to the light
Run through the night
Run like it's the last night of your life

If you really love me give me what I crave, my dearest friend
You never really knew me as the real me 'til the bitter end

We can live forever
But if we die, we die together
Run with me
Run with me
Set it all on fire
If we burn, we burn together
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
