Burn the straw man
Burn the straw man
Burn the straw man
Light a match and watch it burn
Burn the fucking straw man down

Now who is the victim and what is the charge
We've been stuck in the system for years
There's a human being wanted at large
He's a status code, a shit stain, a fucking disease
Let's go

We're just legal friction
They make you up and take a name
A piece of paper gave you a life but they treat you like a thing
They have ways of distraction
They keep you entertained
Keep watching don't ask questions
Reinforce the make believe

They're watching me, they're watching you
They're watching me, they're watching you
They're watching me and they're watching you

Be afraid
Be very afraid
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn
Understand
Do you stand under me
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn

I'm sick of following the leader
I'm sick of the shame
I've been sick from the cloud of smoke blinding this gaze
So put your left foot in and your right foot out and charge that mother fucker
Knock the straw man down
He has a million voices telling us lies
Describing your fate to your face while scripting your demise
He uses fear as his favorite play while hiding his eyes
For the calm and innocent who wreak of surprise

They're watching me, they're watching you
They're watching me, they're watching you
They're watching me and they're watching you

Be afraid
Be very afraid
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn
Understand
Do you stand under me
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn

I'm afraid
I'm very afraid
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn
Understand
Do you stand under me
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn

The straw man
He falls over
Burn the straw man
He burns so fucking hot

Light a match, watch it burn
Put your hand up, take a turn
Light a match, watch it burn
Put your hand up, take a turn

Be afraid
Be very afraid
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn
Understand
Do you stand under me
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn

I'm afraid
I'm very afraid
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn
Understand
Do you stand under me
Burn like a straw man
Burn like a straw man
Burn
