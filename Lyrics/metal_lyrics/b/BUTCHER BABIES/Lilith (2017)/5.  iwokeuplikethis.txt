Woke up
I woke up in a plastic bubble
Breathing this plastic air but you weren't there to calm, calm my nerves
For the first time didn't even care
I got up walked around these cold dark places on my own

All, all while tripping
While tripping on my toe tag
Choking on my consciousness 'cause now I know I've died the most
All, all while tripping
While tripping on my toe tag
Confusion came to check my pulse 'cause now they know I've died the most

Toe tag
Toe tag

Sign and date my toe tag
Stamp and tie my toe tag
Lace it up
To tag
Bag me up
My toe tag

Woke up
See bags of blood they're all my type
Breathe in the putrid smell of my own skin
It rots off my bones
Looking at the others rotting too
I got up touched the ground felt the cold concrete below my feet

All, all while tripping
While tripping on my toe tag
Choking on my consciousness 'cause now I know I've died the most

Toe tag
Toe tag

Sign and date my toe tag
Stamp and tie my toe tag
Lace it up
To tag
Bag me up
My toe tag

I never should have unzipped myself
I could've continued to see through the eyes
The eyes, the eyes of my body double
I don't want to touch feel taste
I don't want to breath in this waste
Let me rot in peace

Toe tag
Toe tag

Sign and date my toe tag
Stamp and tie my toe tag
Lace it up
To tag
Bag me up
My toe tag

This should have been my end
Until we meet again
But I'm all, all while tripping
While tripping on my toe tag
Confusion came to check my pulse 'cause now they know I've died the most
