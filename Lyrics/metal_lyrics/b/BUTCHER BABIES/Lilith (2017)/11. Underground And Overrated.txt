Can't call my family, I don't have one
The sickest kid on earth
I'm the science project you've been hiding and I'm out to get revenge
You think you kinda know me not the other way around
'Cause I've changed the story from the four horsemen to the boy who cries wolf

I can't live by the same rules as you
The message
The reason
There's no need to believe it
Because we'll all end up underground and overrated

Preacher's got the bible-thumpers circling me
I'm their drug filter human
I trained the parasites to talk outta your mouth and now you sing just like a bird
That is the thing about filthy cannibals they're all infected with disease
I was born to rule but you changed the game to the boy who cries wolf

I can't live by the same rules as you
'Cause your bullshit restrictions won't break me in two
No your bullshit restrictions won't break me in two
I can't live by the same rules as you
The message
The reason
There's no need to believe it
Because we'll all end up underground and overrated

Circles in circles
The dot in the middle
You fucked with the balance this time
You can't get rid of me, you're surrounded on all sides
You can't get rid of me, I'm even under your feet

You think you kinda know me not the other way around
'Cause I've changed it from the four horsemen to the boy who cries wolf

I can't live by the same rules as you
'Cause your bullshit restrictions won't break me in two
No your bullshit restrictions won't break me in two
I can't live by the same rules as you
The message
The reason
There's no need to believe it
Because we'll all end up underground and overrated
