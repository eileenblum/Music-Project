Oh, I can see what you see
It's all in front of me
I can only feel what you feel
It's deep inside of me

I can walk the way you walk
I can talk the way you talk
I've given every inch of me

How could I have been so lost

We held so strong as we built a path so wrong
We felt so in control as we were spiraling
Look what we've done
Bloody and damned
I can't wash this off my hands
We felt so beautiful as we were spiraling
Look what we've done

You can only breathe what I breathe
It's all I give of you
You can only hate what I hate
You're driven by my rule

You're not real unless I give you the chance to truly live
Exhausting all your love and trust

How could I have been so lost

We held so strong as we built a path so wrong
We felt so in control as we were spiraling
Look what we've done
Bloody and damned
I can't wash this off my hands
We felt so beautiful as we were spiraling
Look what we've done

Who am I
Who am I
Am I dead, am I alive
A skeleton with soulless eyes
Does this end with truth or lies

Will I remain this way
Does this ever change
Do I take the blame
Or simply run away

How could I have been so lost

We held so strong as we built a path so wrong
We felt so in control as we were spiraling
Look what we've done
Bloody and damned
I can't wash this off my hands
We felt so beautiful as we were spiraling
Look what we've done
Look what we've done
