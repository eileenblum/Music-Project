This time I'm deep in the water
The murky water, it pulls me under
I feel it cover me
A whirlpool in my lungs now I feel it at one
I get the sudden itch and I'm gone
See you later!

Deeper to the deepest
Always sinking eye to eye with the fathers of the sea
We're fearless

Following the undertow
Sink to the lowest low

And now I know I'm swimming always swimming deeper
I always seem to find myself swimming with the sharks
In a fight I can't win but I always seem to start
Swimming always swimming
'Cause the bait of a chase pulls me from the cage
I'm a beast for defeat so let it swallow me
Swimming god damn swimming deeper down

Senses touch all my senses with the lashing of the tide seducing all my pride defenseless

Try to keep a grip on your rubbery skin
But I am no match
Sink your jagged teeth in
It's never enough for me
It's never enough for me
Sharing my blood with the sea
And I'm gone

Following the undertow
Sink to the lowest low
And now I know I'm swimming always swimming deeper
Swimming always swimming deeper down

Down we go to the bottom of the undertow
Down we go I try so hard to follow the glow
'Cause I always seem to find myself washed up with the tide
Strangled by the sea engulfing all my sight
Drowning always drowning deeper down
The roar of the waves pushes me back to shore
With my tail between my legs but I'll come back for more
Drowning always drowning deeper down

I always seem to find myself swimming with the sharks [6x]
Swimming with the sharks
Swimming with the sharks
With the sharks
With the sharks

And now I know I'm swimming always swimming deeper
I always seem to find myself swimming with the sharks
In a fight I can't win but I always seem to start
Swimming always swimming
'Cause the bait of a chase pulls me from the cage
I'm a beast for defeat so let it swallow me
Swimming god damn swimming deeper down
