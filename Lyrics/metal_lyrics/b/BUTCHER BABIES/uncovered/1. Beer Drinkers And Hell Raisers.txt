If you see me walkin' down the line
with my fav'rite honky tonk in mind,
well, I'll be here around suppertime
with my can of dinner and a bunch of fine.

Yeah 
Oh, yeah

Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yeah.
Don't you wanna come with me?

The crowd gets loud when the band gets right,
steel guitar cryin' through the night.
Yeah, try'n to cover up the corner fight
but ev'rything cool 'cause they's just tight.

Yeah

Beer drinkers and hell raisers, yeah.
