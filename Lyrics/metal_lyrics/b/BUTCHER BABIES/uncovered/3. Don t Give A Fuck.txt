I don't give a shit
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a shit
We don't give a fuck

Your opinion don't mean shit to me
And your shit is about to fall
Your rationale isn't rational
Like bungie jumping off a 6 foot wall
I don't give a shit

Your right and wrong to me is all wrong
And you'll pay if you do me wrong
Politically correct means tag along stupid
And I don't ever tag along
We don't give a fuck

What I am is who I am and I'm proud of who I am
C'est la vie cause to me comes naturally
I don't give a shit

I ain't afraid of the present
I ain't ashamed of my past
And my future's locked in real tight
I don't give a shit

The guns aren't loaded and the fists aren't clenched
But I've taken up a brand new fight
I don't give a fuck

Hip ain't hip and cool ain't cool
But a fool is definitely a fool
New ain't new it is just new to you
But the truth is sad that's true

I don't give a shit
I don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck, no!
