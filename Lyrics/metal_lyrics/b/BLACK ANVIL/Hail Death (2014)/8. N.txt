We are the night we are His Light
Bring on our tragedy
This beast has Quadrahorned
Itâs shifting shape grows endlessly
We search the sky We live to lie
Deny Our travesty
In Our bleak december through the embers
Guide Us willfuly
In sight in body in mind insanity
A force beyond what man can see
The second it takes to breathe
Do you believe
We are all We are nothing We are one We are all
Until you take Me uphold Our fall
As I beseech thee as We are all
Until you take Me uphold our fall
As I beseech thee as We are all
As We are nothing as We are for/four
As We are all We all shall fall
We are the night His only light
Unlike christ fantasy
Thunder clouds announce His storm
&amp; all reborn die endlessly
And you have kept Me
This is My home
Amidst your chaos never alone
As We are all as We are nothing
As We are one as We areâ¦
