Fuck your second coming our trinity is here
I as the father you as
My son I spit on the spirit of fear
Unholy terror around Us We welcome
Our chaos as one
With hate pour the lead till thousands are dead
Endlessly seeking the darkness then We becomeâ¦
Larger than lifeâ¦ closer to death
Sever the ties I am your breath
Stronger than lifeâ¦ longer than death
Spirit suffice all that is left
No constant limitation freedom from the skin
Exposing the face newly embraced
Peeling the layers within
A metamorphosis a true hypothesis
We are
Larger than lifeâ¦ closer to death
Sever the ties I am your breath
Stronger than lifeâ¦ longer than death
New is the dawn right as the left
Reign in the senses heighten Our sight
Demented invent as the day becomes night
Dethroned &amp; uprooted Iâm staking My claim
In you they will lose any hope to remain
A victim Iâll make you &amp; take you with Me
Reliving your failures I share tragedy
One thing is certain We all live the lie
In Death may We relish no future denied!
There is no future until I have died
There is no future until We have died
Black as the past black out the present
Blacken the future no future denied!
There is no future until I have died
