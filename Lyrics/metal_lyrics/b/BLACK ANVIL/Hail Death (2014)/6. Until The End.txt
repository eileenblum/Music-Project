I am finished so close your open door
Never shall I return
Look forward to the drowning shores
Until the end forevermore
This theme requires final lasting pilgrimage
The old has become York
Total graven war
This odyssey fulfilled
Whatâs left to owe?
Empty hollow misery
Keep warm this leather flesh
I near the rusted industries
The steel corroded Death
These motors silent
I leave as when they left
Halfway to oblivion
Towards desert stinking breath
Total graven war
This prophecy fulfilled
Whatâs left to owe?
Until the end until the final score
Total fucking war
Across the thinnest air
Almost to oblivion
Will you meet Me there?
Over crimson mountain blasphemy
Sunshine states an empty place
Yet to the edge I am
We areCome aleap My destiny/
Will you meet Me there?
Total fucking war!
This prophecy fulfilled
Whatâs left to owe?
Dead again
Total fucking war!
Dead again
Oblivion!
