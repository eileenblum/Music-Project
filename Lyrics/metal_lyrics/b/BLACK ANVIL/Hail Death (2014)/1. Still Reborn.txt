So now I see it's clear to Me
Like a mongrel discarded
Destined to freeze
A winter unknown like no other
A cold never felt
A new dominion upon Me
Commanding itself!
The fall has surpassed us My winter is here
(Can you hear?)
The shaking and trembling without any fear
Alone yet undaunted the time is at hand
Regret never noticed it is they who will stand
A trial of errors but who is to blame
The liar the silent the violence of shame
Reap the bounty of loss!
I will feed on His blood in His name
Drink in His name!
Who bringeth torture who brings Me strength
The One who leads through darkness.. Unending pain
The One who brings us darkness who lights the way
A solitary figure from two no gain
It slips away as night eats day
You can call this a life as you're living a dream
A winter discovered among Us
A cold in a heart
An old dominion has fallen now always apart
Separation. Liberation. Elevation.
Destined to be vigilant
And with intent this regiment
You will feel His wrath
But still I am reborn
Sacrifice this soul
Heat then stir My blood
Initiate His fire
They rule not My desires
I call Your name endlessly
Who bringeth torture
Who brings me strength
The One who leads through darkness
The One who makes Us stronger
Drink in His name
I am still
I am still reborn!
Separation. Liberation. Elevation.
You're fucking done..
Heâs fucking done!
