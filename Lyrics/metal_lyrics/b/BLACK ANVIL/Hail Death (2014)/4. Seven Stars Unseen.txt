Raven sight through the wolven eyes
One purpose redeemed as the fires feed the night
Nocturnal eternal
Left alone are you worthy of the sacrifice
Take My hand may your burning flesh envelope Me
Stench of Death this caress develope entropy
It may take another hundred years until you seeâ¦
That on this path in Death may I be free!
We have stood on the edges of existence
We have drawn back
The curtain stained with time
In the end We have become
As the serpent spit the tongue
On this path unholy liberty
Setting sun what has become
Now vanquish end of days
I Quaerere Ut Mortem Non Vitare Me
Some things are better left unchanged
Intrinsic engaged
Only a moment then the second stageâ¦
Seven stars await your majesty
Climbing towards the precipice
A glimpse away eternity after you and Me
