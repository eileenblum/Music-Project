Dark and unseen taking the time
It has taken these years to admonish the dream
A life taking test as an order behest
This has brought Us
And brought forth the darkness
And now We infest
And like the conquerors before Us
We shall seek beyond the night
Allow the fear allow these fixtures
Permeate beyond the light
What was once lost cannot be conjured
We shall write the following chapters
This redemption through
Blood the ink of the scribe
These eyes finally opened
The unending dawning of time
The senses threaten as the fences entwine
A life taking test We envelope unrest
We are Chaos untowing your line
And like the victims soon to flourish
We shall reach beyond the night
Within the past a future litmus
Permeate within the light
And in despair You will adjoin Me
We shall write the following volumes
This redemtion through blood!
At once mistrust and dully blessed
Thee sanctified unholy dressed
Beneath Her earth, among Her dirt
We rectify to reach our worth
And rise to greet the Nameless one
Beseech the gaze I call to Thee
Never shall I falter! Never shall it be Me!
At once mistrust and dully blessed
Thee sanctified My blood immersed
In you for whom I concede!
Redemption through blood of yours of Mine
Redemption (Salvation)
Redemption through
His blood of yours of Mine
Rising rising the soul never rests
Clamps on this coffin no longer prevent
Ten thousand journeys nine hundred lives
And so it be written and finally We die
If next may be the present
The future needs to speak
The past has been forgotten
Itâs burning at Our feetâ¦
