I demand an answer for
I am the all knowing truth
Why do you think you areâ¦?!
I will ascend even faster
Will you as soon follow suit?
Gorge on the blood of disaster
Iâll burn the world before
Iâm through
Six million will seem trivial
Can you abide by your answer
Will you not drink in his youth
Together We walk to death
Fear no longer an issue embracing
His warmth eventide
Drown in the flood alabaster
Iâll leave your world and be the truth
Nothingness is possible!
Ficticious race imposter god
Cinders reduce you to nothing
And nothing is allâ¦
Nothing is everything follow
Me into the allâ¦
Another night has fed us stolen from the vine
Orgy of inception the gift of eventide
Rays of light ignite the sky in living in dying
We end while you repriseâ¦
Gratified vilified
Read through the pages of ancients
Given to ritual feast
Selfish serving I as Wolf and Beast
Will you join Me?! We own the night!!!
Together We run to Death!
