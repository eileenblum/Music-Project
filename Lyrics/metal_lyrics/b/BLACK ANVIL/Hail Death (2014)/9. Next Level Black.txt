Initiations:
Which of thee will rest as sacred
Which of thee hast become born
And round through seven circles
And scorch the feet amongst the morn
Desperate enlightenment â I insist
Take Us through haze till We form
I swear the oath Our document
Again Our flesh has torn
A stage amongst the heavens
A shape no skin can take
A realm beyond the seven
A state above the norm
I am just dirt and feces
A species nevermore
We are whatâs left no more
And for this wish forgive Me
I tread beneath your storm
In debted to the chance
We dance on tight ropes ever worn
Desolate among the burning garden
Admit this servant to take
Your flesh is Mine to take
Enraptured ensnared in your trap
Yet Iâd tear off all these limbs and join You
Forever this is My quest
Raping the denizens sacrificial limbs
And for this wish anoint Me
Bathe Me in His light â as bright as night
For now accepted the trial in My sight
Spiritus nostro tuus ignis:
Pledge of the spirit hedge every bet
Darkness engorging silver intent
Blade ever red
Discourse amended needs never met
Chosen from roots in this earth planting death
Flame ever red
And for this wish accept Me
I swim between Your storm
And to this wish enlightenment
Fuck you you did not see this coming
Break the clasp We never last
Yet ask to generate no more
We are whatâs left no more
Sinistra manus:
So here We are together at last
Enjoy the fruits of Our labors
Half way to six
In stature
The road is dark â yes!
Less We cannot judge nor prepare
Nor set these tables
May you have the honor
See the tapestry
Your majesty of thorns
I have made this in humble bliss
Your halls My walls adorned
Recklessly reborn
Grando mortem:
