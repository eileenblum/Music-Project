When the fence corrodes
Which fate will you decide
Graveyards now are temples
To those who wish to die
Ever changing currents everlasting in Our eyes
My will unbroken never changing in these eyes
We will not break the circle
Burn bright the flame arise
Intact a severed head still
Bonded in ghastly symmetry
We are sinew and bone and man
Creates this test
Whats dead shall never rest
In this temple with no name
With chisel and stone fury your coffin made....
Armed in stark conviction clothed
In black and shades of grey
Draped in bloodâ¦ Ceremonium
Simplify this life while reaching only Death
Youâve been relinquished
Extinguished as your breath
No more mass restriction no more faith submit to pain
Open up My sacrament I reek of days of punishment
Revel in My darkness drink the wine of terror
Insulate We must intimidate your loss becomes My gain
A manifest ordained allegiance without question
Upon your fleshen cross the crimson stain
No war without allegiance
No faith to conquer pain
Bow down Iâll urinate and wash away your name
Into the fire We rise the children of ashes
Burnt by the bond of existence and resistance
Extracting the deathgivers force
Mine eyes a blur with blinding sight
We shall urge you towards His light
Benevolence
Unholiness
Rapture is your song
Ceremonium
The unexplained
My clarity
A given name of nothing...
