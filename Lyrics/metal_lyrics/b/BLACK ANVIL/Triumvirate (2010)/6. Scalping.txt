And there are still disbelievers
Those abyss in limbo
In glorious waste
Here lie the unworthy
Stricken to fear
What they cannot taste

And there is still
This mountain to climb
Grip tight tread blood
In hellacious storm
Those unattended
Must fend for themselves
In darkness may you find your way

Weâve escaped unscathed
Embedded displaced

And there are still souls to save
Seeds to be planted bricks to be lain
Though course and defined
A testament ambivalent to pain

Weâve escaped uscathed
Embedded displaced
Vehement in recompense
In shame thee bathe
Weâve set aside your past implied
Burned black we reign
To be reborn one must suffer life
Through deaths acclaim

Speak to me
Your faith bequeath to memory
Speak of me
Your dreams beset to sleep
Speak with me
Triumvirate infinity
Scream with me
