Condolences we offer none
The time it takes to grieve
Has long since come undone

And as the hearse descended tragically
In line for what was yet to come
Most mourners lost belief

But just when things appeared most bleak
Their dreams were damaged mortally
As voices never speak

Invested beyond their reach
You cannot fathom how
The students learned to teach

Only the truth buried and hidden
Kept them thirsting for this life
While the years kept sifting by
Fuck father time!
Their cup was full yet seeped the risen
Bonding iron like inside

The choice is yours
We own you
You have free will
We own you
You can decide
We own you
Your life your own
We own you

Only the truth has finally shown them
From this burial new life
As on this day death will arrive
To hell I rise!
And rise we achieve
And rise legend be

We own you
