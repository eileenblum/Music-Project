I grow where there is no soil
Yet supplanted amenable in root
In total disregard intransigent
We adhere obfuscate
We appeared from the gone

And when youâre gone youâre forgotten
A distant glare dissolving in shape
And when youâre gone peace lay rotten

We grow where there is no water
Inviolable protected replete
In total disregard we attach parasitic
We adhere masticate disappear
And youâre gone

And when youâre gone youâre forgotten
A rotting shell dissolving in faith
And if Iâm wrong youâre still forgotten

We thirst where there is no water
We prey when the slaughter is done
Satiate in gluttony
The evil of all roots

And still they seek disarmingly
He dangles at my feet
For neither cross you bear
No eulogy to speak
And while they satisfy
The rest have died discreet

Why do we weep
Entrust a past worth nothing in defeat
For neither death or life
No heaven without hell light
