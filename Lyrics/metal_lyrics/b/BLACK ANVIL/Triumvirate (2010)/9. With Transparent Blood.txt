Engage deceit
Witness discord in its final retreat
A warning to heed
Behind the flesh mask lurks
The spectre at ease

They bleed transparent

In none we trust
In all mislead
You breed disgust
As the lecherous need

They bleed transparent
Attach in selfish drain

These chains to break
Distance yourself from
The tremors at quake
No mourning they see
Scatter like rats while
The piper recedes

They bleed transparent
Attach in selfish drain
They feed apparent
In poison acclaim

Not of us not one of us
A leper by choice
Youâve made silence a voice

You reek of the flesh
Burn the branding marks
Across your head
Itâs easy to achieve
A status of false hierarchy
But when the grain
Inside the glass drains
Youâve become antiquity

They bleed transparent
Attach in selfish drain
They bleed apparent
In nominas name

Severed no longer visibly
A scab of memory
Not even scarred
