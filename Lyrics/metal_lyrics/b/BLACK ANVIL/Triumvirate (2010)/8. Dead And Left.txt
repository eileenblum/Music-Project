How many do protect you
Why have they hid their shame
Their sustenance beneath you
Yet do you know the pain?

How many will regret you
How many will you blame
What was once lost
Cannot be conjured
Let it be remain

We have spoken
We have rust this chain

These wounds forever open
These wounds for all to see
The snake he seeps of poison
Let him be remain

How does the past reflect you
Do shattered pains infect
No angels yet have saved you
And thus no retrospect

We have spoken
We have rust this chain

These wounds forever open
These wounds for all to see
The snake he seeps of poison
Let him be remain

I rise above the heavens
I dig below the runes
I bear the torch beside you
Iâll walk you to your grave

I cannot relive your anguish
We will not grant reprieve
What was once lost
Cannot be conjured
Let it be remain

Never left for dead
Forever dead and left

This union never thrives
For one be cast aside

No mass be written
No tomb be sacred

Forever
Dead and left
