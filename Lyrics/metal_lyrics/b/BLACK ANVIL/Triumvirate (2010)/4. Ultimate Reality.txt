Behold this chalice
Come forth partake my veins
Beneath the malice
I offer purity

Imbued with arrogance
These sands survive the rain

Through deserts malcontent
Atop this black domain
Ignite hell flame
I offer purity

Hawk high and rising
Mutinous staking claim
Inspired lies thin veiled disguise
Have been restrained
Always despising
This hornetâs nest awakes
Send out the hive run for your life

Ultimate reality

Hawk high and rising
Mutinous staking claim
Inspired lies have been restrained
Always despising
This hornetâs nest awakes
Send out the hive run for your lives

Your body soon to be my vessel
Through ocean bloody reign
Ingest whatâs left breathe fleeting breath
I will sustain
Capsize your eyes as death denies
I will remain
