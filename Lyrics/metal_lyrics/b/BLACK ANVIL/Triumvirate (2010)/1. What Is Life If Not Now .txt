What is life if not now
When the question never answers
The truth lies underground

Let go no longer in my grasp
Withdraw from life support
Fornevermore!
We tread among the skin
And from within we penetrate our core

True blood anointed in our quest

From ninety nine degrees
To subhuman depths
Canine no nine disease
Alone we wept

From beyond the beyonds
Eternal may you rest
From cycles blackest suns
Alone we weptâ¦
Alone we weptâ¦
Alone we weptâ¦
Alone we weptâ¦

Make way for the procession
Stand back!
Admittance through election
Stand back!

Fornever resurrection

What is life if not now!
What is life if not now!
