Here we go again
Can this happen twice?
This cancer can be permanent
Alieve me of this plight
At once I thought benign
It grows at virus speed
The end at hand my firmament
Will justify my means
Everlasting glory
Everlasting dream
All will hear my story
Receive
Fuck what youâve been told
You are not welcome here
Forgotten ghost inferior
Dispelled as once foretold
This is no resting place
I welcome your eternity
The shame upon your face
Everlasting glory
Bestowing your wisdom to me
Everlasting dream
Dream every dream till it be
All shall hear our story
We will be forever
Forever will you be
We can taste the never
I will honor thee
Can you hear me
At all
