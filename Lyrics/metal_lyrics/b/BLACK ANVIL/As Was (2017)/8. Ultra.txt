This isn't me
This is beyond our wildest dreams
Admit to me
Submit and rest eternally
Easy
In him we trust truly with us
Escort me
This isn't me
This is beyond my wildest dreams
For me
He is the light uphold thee
Guide me
You are my name
I'll never shelter from your rain/reign
There is no shame
Submit and free thyself no pain
Easy
Washing away there is no day
Before me
This isn't me
This is beyond my wildest dreams
For me
He is the light uphold thee
He is he is
Part of me
He is he is
None to see
He is he is
Clear to me
He is he is
All of me
He is he is
Part of me
