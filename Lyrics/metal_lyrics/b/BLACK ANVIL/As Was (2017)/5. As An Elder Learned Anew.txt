Let's ride the sky infinite we rise
Fear no longer endless dreams
Patterns soaked within its seams
Twisted eyes yet gentle flesh
Breathe a dream unfettered breath
Let's go inside deeper deeper
Deeper you may find
The layers fade away
Curse the dying day
Let's get inside deeper deeper
Deeper you may find
Let's say goodbye yet scream hello
They asked how high we said we'd go
In his essence we are less than amen
Forever cold yet feel my heat
And to my bone thee be my meat
If not alone thee be my fix
Leave us stay among us
We are alone just you and me
For a short time so shall we see
Leave us stay among us
Let's say goodbye yet scream hello
They asked how high we said we'd go
In his essence we are less than amen
Tempt us we invest thus
Assure us bring us words to sing
Lend us please accept thus
There's more to me
Will you set me free
We've reached our goal
So hold on tight
Into his fold inhale the night
In his lessons breathe
His essence amen
