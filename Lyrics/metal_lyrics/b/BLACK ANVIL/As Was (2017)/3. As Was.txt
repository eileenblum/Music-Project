Time declines
Decadent
Replenishment
Inside
Ingested for all time
Parasite parasite
Gesticulate the tensions
In your mind
I'll guide you through
The once observed
To twice aligned
And if you trust me you will find
And if you trust him you will find
You may learn to unlearn
Time declines
Decadent
Inside
I'll guide you through
The once observed
To twice aligned
Parasite parasite
And if you trust him you will find
Ever knowing never blind
Ever growing you are mine
You are mine you are mine
All this will fade
As was our day
For always for always
As was our day
As is our night aflame
Days do not approach me
Weeks do not appear
Months turn into months
Another year has disappeared
Once has turned to none
Nothing will suffice
Many are the few intended
Mended by the glory of his light
Mended by the glory of his light
Glory of his light
And if you trust him you will find
Ever growing never blind
Ever growing you are mine
