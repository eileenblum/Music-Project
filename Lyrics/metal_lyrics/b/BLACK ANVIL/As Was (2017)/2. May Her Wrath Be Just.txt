She speaks to me
I can hear her faintly
She whispers she screams
A name unspoken

She reaches through me
Yet this is no warm embrace
She whispers I scream
Unlearn their name

O mother
Die for your dignity 
We listen we listen
They scream your name

And while your children live
They take what's ours
As thine would give
At last we can ask no more
She's given all she can no more

I can feel her heartbeat
She suffers unworthy
Oour fall from grace
She teacheth me
We can never learn the ways
We suffer unworthy
We own our blame

O father
Die for her dignity
We Listen we listen
They scream your name

And while your children live
They take what's mine
As thine would give
At last we can ask no more
She's given all she can no more

May he wrath be just
May her just be us
