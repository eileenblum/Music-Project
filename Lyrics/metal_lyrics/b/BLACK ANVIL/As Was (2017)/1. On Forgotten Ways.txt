One the only number
To nothing will this come
Three defeats our purpose
(Take me please)
For everythingâs undone
I the earth beneath you
Still higher than the tree
Do wooden lies bequeath you
With sullen eyes they seek

The beast he writhes in agony
Beside me within me
A part of me

We must feel unworthy
Yet trust the hand that feeds
Terminate this hunger
And solve this lifeâs disease
He makes it easy to attain

We can be the journey
Higher can we reach

Exist in dual autonomy
Plant my dirt plant my seed

And though I dream
Whatâs left to see
On forgotten ways are we
And though I tread

With eyes unseen
On forgotten ways are we
There is no furtherance
No need to reminisce
On forgotten ways are we
We are endlessly

Itâs harder to remember
What never was

Comforting the cold and damp
We can be the journey
Higher can we reach

All is lost less your furtherance
Begone all shred
Of second chance
No longer faith per chance
Love is no more

I will be your opium
Higher can we reach
I will be your overdose
Higher will we reach

The beast he dies with dignity
Surround me amend me
Discover me

Kiss the hand that bleeds

And though I dream
Whatâs left to see
On forgotten ways are we
And though I tread
With eyes unseen
On forgotten ways are we
There is no furtherance
No need to reminisce
On forgotten ways are we
