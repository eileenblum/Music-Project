We are infinity divine insanity
Entrusted till the end
Ignore the fate of men
I am with you and now we are
Tempted in his quest
Another visionary guest
We are his mystery
Beyond his gift to thee
Hallow rise the fallen
Hear beyond his calling we can be
Fire lights our darkness
Fire in me
Higher may your fire burn in me
Never question this direction
All your world to see
He will grant thee
I'll take a lesser path
Where chosen few begat
Entrusted till the end
Incite the hate of them
They are not you and i we are
Vested in our hearts
A dying breath commits our start
We are no mystery
For him i give you selflessly
Two keys
Here beneath we sleep
Fire lights our darkness
Fire in me
Higher may your fire burn in me
Never question this direction
All your world to see
Our time no time
Desire all you seek
Lasting and lasting
Listen as he speaks
My sheol my limbo
Is waiting there for we
Revel in his glory
Stricken to my knees
Revel in his glory
We are his ministry
Divine so define me
I praise you share the wine
My bread is yours and yours divine
The more you live the more i die
All your world diseased
I will die for thee
We are his ministry
Divine so define me
