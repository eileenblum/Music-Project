Agree to disagree, resolute, calm at sea
Prevailing winds will alter course
Shift 3 degrees
Relate to vindicate, camouflage, understate
The monster rears his ugly head
In spite of me

Full speed ahead
All systems overload
Next stop dissent
All systems overthrow

New chapters different books
All you took, erodes in days
This tattered rope holds stronger fast
Through lifeâs charades
Agree to disagree, resolute, war at sea
This monster rears his ugly head
In spite of me

Full speed ahead
All systems overload
Next stop dissent
All systems overthrow
Full speed ahead
All systems will explode
Bring out your dead
All systems overload

Release the Kraken

Outstretched, with tentacle reach
I plunge fathoms
Sinking deep
