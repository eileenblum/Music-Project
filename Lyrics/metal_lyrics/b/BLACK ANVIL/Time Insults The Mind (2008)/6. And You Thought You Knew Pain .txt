Reverse direction, in all humility, Iâve become extinct
And only now, with grave allegiance
Do I suffer, indifferent, insistent, and prolific?
Thrown forward in time
Itâs taken years to compile enough memories to die!

And you thought you knew pain!

Commence distinction
In all things lie a will to fade
Thrust backward in time, forsaken
Any hope worth saving has passed me by

And you thought you knew pain!
Whatâs put to rest,
Infest, Insane

I will rot, but it's not
Like I wasnât already achieving decay

Letâs end today
Forever enrage

I am molting, no longer set apart
Flesh and wood, the dirt feels good
Against my heart
