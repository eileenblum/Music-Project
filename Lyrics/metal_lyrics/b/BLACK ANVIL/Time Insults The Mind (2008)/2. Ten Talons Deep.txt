Wasting away in your kingdom of spoils
Your banner unfurled
(Announcing the loyal)
With venomous treachery released is the snake
Constricting its coils and collapsing our fate

This dream is dying
Your cancer is spreading
(He sees)
Your world is lying
At my feet I denounce your disease

I dismiss your relation
Thereâs no reason for 1 breath of life
As you belittle creation
Your death my only fight

Through the trenches of glory I ride
We ride!

Across black rivers
Submerged awaiting prey
Evil from us deliver
Ten talons deep
The wound ingrained

This tree of life
Youâve turned to ash
Leaves him decayed
I stand
Unmoved
Unbroken
Consumed
Twenty years [2x]
We stand
Unmoved
Heâs broken
Consumed
Twenty years
