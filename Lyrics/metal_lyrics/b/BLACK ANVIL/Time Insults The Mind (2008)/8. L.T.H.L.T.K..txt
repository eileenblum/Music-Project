The stronger the hate
The longer the wonder

Riding this wave of hatred and anger
Peeling the skin off this cruel dark world

And Iâm tired of playing along
And weâre tired of the same old song

Stood up and discounted

Fighting this urge
The pain overtakes me
Rolling the bones off this cruel dark world

And Iâm tired of playing along
And weâre tired of the same old song

Stood up and discounted

The stronger the hate
The longer the knife
Instead of death youâve given breathâ¦to life

And Iâm tired of playing along
And weâre tired of the same old song

Stood up and discounted!
