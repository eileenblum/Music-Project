Morning light penetrates
This grizzly future, why did I wake?
Blackest white, infiltrate
These years asleep, just hibernate
I refuse today

So cold embalming
Death hand disarming
So I drop, to my knees

Thereâs no use resisting
Please make it stop
Thereâs no use existing
I accept, I regret this dissent make it stop!

Deathsomnia, penetrates
Sleep everlasting, time dissipates
I refuse today

So cold embalming
These frigid screams
Thereâs no use existing
Please make it stop
Thereâs no use resisting
I accept, I regret this dissent make it stop!

Optimist lies, feed on the weak
Deceived
And suffer, to release
Dream in disguise, faith in retreat
My own dying hand, I relinquish my grip
Thereâs just loss to gain
Enamored, welcome defeat
Enamored, into defeat
