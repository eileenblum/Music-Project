Into the cave
These walls breathe fire
Give life and taketh away
A new beast rising entire

Unleash depraved
Enlarge aspire
At odds an even exchange
Like ivy on graves reaching higher and higher

On this day death
Engraved

No fool awakened from slumber
Uncover the dirt and disdain

On this day death
Engraved

Time insults the mind
Whatâs left is left behind
Iâve forgiven the future for presenting the past
Iâve forgiven the past for presenting the future
