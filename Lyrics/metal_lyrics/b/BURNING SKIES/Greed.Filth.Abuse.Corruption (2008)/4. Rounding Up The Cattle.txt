What the hell is happening
The shit surrounds the fucked up things
The scum that lay just scattering like landfill sites
They're festering
Stinking out the possibilities of ever listening
Things cant always be the same and yes
there's always room for change
But don't follow some shitty craze
That may seem cool because it pays
You will look back and regret
The fact you look so fucking wet
I refuse to accept the way this shit has gone
they seem to be breeding daily
These scenes are all so wrong
Its all about money gained
Money spent on some pathetic products
To try to be as fake as possible
Please just die and get out of my way
Get out of my way you stupid pansies
And never return
I hope you all get slaughtered and never reborn
Rounding up the cattle
Die you wastes of space and leave things the way they were
You're all as camp as a row of pink tents
And will get what you deserve
