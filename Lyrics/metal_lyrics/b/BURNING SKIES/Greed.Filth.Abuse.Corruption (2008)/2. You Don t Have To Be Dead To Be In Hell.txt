Stop one second and maybe we can think things through
For a moment and do what we're supposed to do
Everything will be OK
Get up off your ass and kill all the scummy fuckers
That are wandering like corpses
Living out their day to day, doing what they do
Stealing, mugging, anything that's wrong
Lets rape these mother fuckers of all they have left
Scumbag Annihilation
Castrate these fuckers right
Put their necks in the noose
Hang the scum out to dry
Take a moment, and picture and keep for memories
Store in your mind
These death scenes are fucking bliss
I can't think of anything greater than watching scum die
You don't have to die to be in hell
All i think of is murder
Murdering people who can't seem to learn
To respect what they've been born into
I just want to watch these people suffer for the shit they cause
You don't have to die to be in hell
Hell is what we live in
