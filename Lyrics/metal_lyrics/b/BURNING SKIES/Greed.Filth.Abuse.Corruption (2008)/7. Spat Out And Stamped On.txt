Spat out and stamped on
Always out there preaching shit
Let these thoughts rule your lives
Change your minds
Get some common sense you retards
Ill always disagree with everything you spill from your mouths
Get some fucking sense you retards
Keep it to yourselves
Its fun to wind all of you pricks up and see you pissed off
I'm fuelled by the fact that you cunts can be like this
I once thought that things would change
But I'm glad you stayed the same
Self righteous arrogance
I bet you were all raped at birth by the ones that so say loved you
I laugh in your face
Preaching shit all the time
Let these thoughts rule your lives
Change your minds all the time
Expect me to change mine
Spat out and stamped on
The words you fucking spit are worthless
I'll smash your face and gut you retards
