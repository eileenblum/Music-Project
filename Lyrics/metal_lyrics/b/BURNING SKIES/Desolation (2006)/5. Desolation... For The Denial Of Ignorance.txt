Born into this decaying world
Selfish minds we think alike
Walk this earth like dogs on leashes being led by the blind
So imagine if the blind led all the selfish to their death
And drove some sense through the heart of humanity
Before it passes on
We cleanse the streets of all the scum and filth that still remains
Human disgrace, you've made your mark, now we start to rebuild
Killing our own is what we do, so let's feel no pity in the new world that we'll grow
Raping our way through demise
So here's a plan that will cut you down to size
Desolation for the denial of ignorance
And making sure the shit that we hurt is fucking dead
I want to see them dead
Being sure the ones that we have killed deteriorate into nothing
But still suffer
Desolation
For the denial of ignorance
Your life capsized in the eyes of your dead friends
All your dead friends lay scattered all around this glen of anguish
And bitterness reigns over what was once bled dry
Pissing on your ignorance
Your fire fades out
Conforming back to innocence
No better time than now
