[originally by War From A Harlots Mouth]Morbid Engel overlord, bringer of disease, he'll crush your skull, destroy your soul and bring you to your knees,
Beg for death, he feeds off your fear, your eyes will melt and your blood runs dry, kneel before Morbid Engel.
He is death, your worst fear, he is death, feel the metal fists of hate.
Your eyes will melt and your skin rots off, you can't escape Morbid Engel, feel the pain and the wrath and the hate of Morbid Engel,
Crush your skull, your soul, get on your knees.
