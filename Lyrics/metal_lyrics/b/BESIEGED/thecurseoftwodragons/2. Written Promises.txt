Lying before me
the pages I read
death in a book, so clear
life in love, for ears

I taste the blood
for my hearts one true love
I taste the blood, and eat the bread
for the love lost,
for the love brought.

in my heart I will bleed for your love,
your love
your blood
my eyes breath
my heart sings
