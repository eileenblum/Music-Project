She lies in my heart
with her beauty I am shamed
captivating the veins
a figment distorted in my brain

with a cold winter kiss
she offers me this,
this spiritual mess
in my heart

her beauty preys on my soul
my cravings she fulfills
her image she must boast

parading in my mind
