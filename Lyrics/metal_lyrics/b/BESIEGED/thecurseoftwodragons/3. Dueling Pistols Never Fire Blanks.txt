the color of amber blankets the sky
as clouds of fire form two eyes
an ox and a lion chase your fear away
then lightning came to break the gaze
of aw and wonder as the angels parade
lightning came to brake the gaze

with four faces of men
and four wings of eagles

fear no scorpions
sounding swift judgment

considering not wreath
but the weakness of flesh
in heart remember
burning clouds of fire
in mind embrace the color of the sky
and angels seeking the resurrection of
a leader to restore eyes of fire faces of men
wings of eagles

burning clouds of fire
in mind embrace the colors of the sky
