a war of ages
she is forever blessed
asked for live, sweetness, and hope
they run to her
in search of amenity
cursed by two dragons,
beseeched the evil spirits
she answers the request

hope in me
embrace my image
seven sorrows
experience the grave

the advocate spirits cry
she came, corruption.
