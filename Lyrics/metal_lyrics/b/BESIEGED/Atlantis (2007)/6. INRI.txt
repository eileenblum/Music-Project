The stripes on Your back, 
the blood on Your face, 
the holes in Your hands, 
the love in Your eyes;
this was for me 
the undeserving. 
And with a new found fire 
I will shine.
SHIIIINE!
My God, My God, 
why have I forsaken you? 
I owe You my life in exchange for Your death. 
A sentence, marked for me, 
bound Your hands and sealed Your fate. 
The shackles, The shackles, The shackles, 
The shackles, The shackles, The shackles,
meant for me, hung from Your feet.
Burn this wall down 
OH!
burn it to the ground. 
Burn this wall down 
OH!
burn it to the ground. 
Bring me to my knees.
My God, My God, 
why have I forsaken You? 
Take this from me. 
Your blood is enough to cover my hands.
Your blood is enough to cover my hands.
Your blood is enough to cover my hands.
Your blood is enough to cover my hands.
Your blood is enough to cover my hands.
Your blood is enough to cover my hands.
