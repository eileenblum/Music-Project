Rrrraaaaaaahhhhh
She lies in my heart
with her beauty I am shamed
captivating the veins a figment 
distorted in my brain
captivating the veins a figment 
distorted in my brain
Distorted in my brain!
with a cold winter kiss
she offers me this,
this spiritual mess
in my heart
with a cold winter kiss
she offers me this,
this spiritual mess
in my heart
parading in my heart
in my heart
parading in my mind
Oooohhh!
her beauty preys on my soul
my cravings she fulfills
her image she must boast
her beauty preys on my soul
