I came with hope that you would let me love you.
I came with love that you would find hope in me.
I came with you in mind. 
I died for you to find me.
My child, come to me 
and I will give you shelter in my arms.
My child, come to me 
and I will wipe the tears from your face.
It was my love 
that brought me here: 
it was your nails that kept me here.
I would do it all again 
to have you by my side.
When i speak, wright this down
When i speak, wright this down
When i speak, wright this down
Rrrrrraaaaaaaooooooohhhhhh!
It was love that brought me to this cross.
My child, my blood was shed for you.
It was love that brought me to this cross.
My child, my blood was shed for you.
It was looooooooooooooove!!!!
