Black eyes, 
black hearts, 
black mouths, 
black clouds
Black eyes, 
black hearts, 
black mouths, 
black clouds
I saw the black hearts 
consume a world I know and love.
They were relentless 
in their destruction.
They changed the hearts 
of those that used to care, 
and they brought death with their words.
They changed the hearts 
of those that used to care, 
and they brought death with their words.
I saw the black hearts summon a plague, 
perpetuated by all those it took hold of.
On swift wings the blackest clouds rolled in to block out the sun.
And with all hope gone, man sighed his final breth, 
for he had turned against himself.
The sequence I observed that day unfolded in this fashion
Black eyes, 
black hearts, 
black mouths, 
black clouds.
