Yyyyaaaaaawww!
I've found this world crooked and depraved.
My hands have been washed in the blue ocean waves.
This is a battleground. 
This is my song.
I will sing a song of hope. 
I will sing a song of passion.
I will sing a song of love. 
I will sing of Salvation.
And, with these feeble hands, 
I will life You up 
as a burning candle 
to light the darkened path.
In turn, 
make me the voice 
that will bring the world back.
And we will shine like starts 
And we will shine like starts
in the heavens  
And we will shine like starts 
like the light in Your eyes. [x3]
