the balkanization of my heart 
has been resurrected
with an affection that always inspires
and never grows tired 
of my dark and deadly valleys
is this the end of me? I swore to never go back.
in this the finest hour a last breath of life awaits me
in this the finest hour a last breath of life awaits me
anticipation with 
vomiting, 
you are something I dream
you are the something that I must have
truly this is the finale of my suffering
and the beginning of perpetual peace
truly this is the end, 
the departure I have waited for
my last chance to see, 
this perpetual peace
on this day I will learn to love again
on this day I will learn to love again
and so I am waiting to die...[x3]
