the journey begins, a black suit parade
a secret society, offers life death protection to families
stability bleed paid with our Father s lives
the Savior s ultimate sacrifice
vendettas to right your wrongs
kill with vengeance in the Name of your Father
the vow- a Bride- the church- your blaspheme
conspiracy and truth drowned in silence
death breeds life and praise to your name
I know You will not walk away
betray, 
morality, 
silence
shots are fired, 
heads are turned,
redemption brings
disaster to the heads of your family
henchmen martyr 
your Fathers Only Son
the vow of silence is broken, 
is broken, 
Omert 
the code of silence is forfeit, 
is forfeit, 
Omert 
the reign of terror is over, 
it's over, 
Omert 
your death destroys the curse, 
your curse, 
Omert
