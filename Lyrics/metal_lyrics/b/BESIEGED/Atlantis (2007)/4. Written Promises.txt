Lying before me
The pages I read
Death in a book, so clear
Life in love, for ears
Lying before me
The pages I read
Death in a book, so clear
Life in love, for ears
I taste the blood
for my heart's one true love
I taste the blood
for my heart's one true love
I taste the blood, and eat the bread
For the love lost,
For the love brought.
I taste the blood, and eat the bread
For the love lost,
For the love brought.
In my heart I will bleed for Your love,
Your love
Your blood
My eyes breath
My heart sings
My eyes breath
My heart sings
My eyes breath
My heart sings
My eyes breath
My heart sings
