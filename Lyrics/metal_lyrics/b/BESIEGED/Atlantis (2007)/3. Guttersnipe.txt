The absence of your aspiration finds my blighted situation 
bleeding, grieving, self-reproaching,
Through narrow bars, a hand outreaching. 
The absence of your aspiration finds my blighted situation 
bleeding, grieving, self-reproaching,
Through narrow bars, a hand outreaching. 
A brilliant flame 
at the witching hour.
A familiar name, 
wooden visage, 
cadaverous gaze. 
Abandoned guttersnipe?

Expose the vile, 
exhume the pased, 
an unmediatated affidavit.
This is your call, 
will you bring me along? 
This is your call, 
(This is your call)
will you bring me along?
(will you bring me along?)
Turning your back to the fear in my eye, 
(we're going nowhere.)

Turning your back to the fear in my eye,

One heartfelt converstation brought me liberation and release from 
bleeding, grieving, self-reproaching.
Bemusic cage, a lock now broken.
