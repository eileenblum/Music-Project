Your love lasts
for thousands of generations
with open hands and hearts, 
we stand alone
and follow Your words with 
our last breath
we honor You 
with blood sweat and tears
we hope You will meet us in the end
will You carry us home 
as we take cover 
as we take cover 
under Your wings
blessings, maturity, 
our souls finally meet virtue
in the place where three worlds collide
we arrive at the threshold
standing at the gates
Your presence is blissful beauty
as we enter Your Kingdom 
with hearts full of grace, 
Your love lasts
for thousands of generations
with open hands and hearts, 
we stand alone
and follow Your words 
with our last breath
Your Love Lasts...
