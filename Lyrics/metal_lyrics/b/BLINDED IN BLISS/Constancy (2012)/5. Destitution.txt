Robbed of your will to live
your life has fallen so far
you lie in disrepair
never questioning why

Hopeless
no salvation
tormented
the pain you must endure
relentless
defeated
no prayer can save you now

Malevolence
oligarchy
profit interest
before humanity

Deprived
your ambitions lie in ruin
natural law revokes
clenching onto faith
for the hope of a brighter day, but NO
your hopes they fade through loss
existence takes its toll
you've fallen far from grace
IN DESTITUTION

How could this be real
how did it come to this
the suffering continues
supermacism still persists
for all the pain we've seen
the tears in tragedy
we fail to see
all around the world we fail to see
the pain and and suffering
despite the good intentions
ignoring the root cause

Hopeless
no salvation
tormented
the pain you must endure
relentless
defeated
no prayer can save you now

Robbed of your will to live
your life has fallen so far
you lie in disrepair
never questioning why

Deprived
your ambitions lie in ruin
natural law revokes
clenching onto faith
for the hope of a brighter day, but NO
your hopes they fade through loss
existence takes its toll
you've fallen far from grace
IN DESTITUTION

How could this be real
how did it come to this
the suffering continues
supermacism still persists
for all the pain we've seen
the tears in tragedy
