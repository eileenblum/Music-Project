Expectations
the voice inside my head won't rest
i'm my own worst enemy
paralyzing
I approach the crossroads of my life
the decision must be made

I'm seeking answers deep within
reflecting upon my failures
for al the pain i'm learning more and more
about who i am, and who you are

Mesmerizing
the duality exists within
torn between two paths
perseverance
you've always known where your heart lies
moving past the inner conflict

In my weakest moments
your words were there, to carry me
the pillar of strength the held me up
when the force of my doubt emerged
when i look in your eyes
like looking into a mirror
my one desire is to save myself like you

I shall deliver with the pressure weighing down on me
i invoke the strength within
i'll see this to its end
i will always remember
never ever forget
that in my greatest time of need
your sacrifces set me free

Full force
as i approach the final stretch
reach out
take this leap of faith
no fear
break the boundaries of your doubt
if you never try
you'll never know
you'll always wonder

Don't lose your focus
you're running out of time
you've built this for yourself
only you can break it down

In my weakest moments
your words were there, to carry me
the pillar of strength the held me up
when the force of my doubt emerged
when i look in your eyes
like looking into a mirror
my one desire is to see myself like you

I shall deliver with the pressure weighing down on me
i invoke the strength within
i'll see this to its end
i will always remember
never ever forget
that in my greatest time of need
your sacrifces set me free
