Searching for a sign
the pulse within my life
a desperate attempt to feel like i belong
loneliness in my heart
longing for release
screaming from within
the harder i searched it seemed
you eluded me
time is so unforgiving
lead me to the truth
life found a way and i found you
and you found me

Througout the course of out lives
always searching for the moments that define who we are
you cannot capture the moment alone
you find the meaning through people you love

I believe
now i see
that i found my place in you
be with me
set me free
shape my memories with you

You lit my world
you fulfilled my dreams
we became one both you and me
this love i have, i give to you

Like a bridge to something special
your eyes are the bridge for my love
when i had you in my sight
the pain was washed away

Like a bridge to something special
your eyes are the bridge for my love
when i had you in my sight
the pain was washed away

Fo you i'd lay my head down
in sacrifice
i'd lay my life on the line
for you

Faith will find you tomorow
stay true to who you are
i could never replace
what you meant to me because

Everything i desire in life
all my thoughts keep leading me back to you
i was yours untill the end
when your thoughts lead you back to me
a chapter in your life
remember what we shared

I believed
i was free
now i bid farewell to you
i my dreams
memories
i will save a place for you

when your thoughts lead you back tome
remember heart and soul
remember the love we shared was kind, pure and true
