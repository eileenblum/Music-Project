Those eyes are the gateway for deception
lack of perception
this physical world hides a truth
the symbiotic connection

Dependence, on everything
for survival
awareness is required, for the future
to survive to live on for understanding
realize

There is a fragile balance in life
despite our ties to this world
it existed before we were here
and will remain when we come to pass

there are things you cannot
touch or see
affinity
like the bond that join
you to me
affinity

We're united through the sounds you hear
and through the love we share

Reality, is emergent

There is a fragile balance in life
despite our ties to this world
it existed before we were here
and will remain when we come to pass

The stars and the sky
and the universe too

The sun and its planets connected to you

The clouds up above
and the wind in your face
your family and friends
and the oceans and lakes

we are connected to everything
we all share this affinity
for if we didnt exist as a whole
we wouldn't even exist at all

Everything we thought we knew
can change
new understandings are emerging
every day

Forsake these ancient traditions
There must be another way
place your faith in a new horizon
search for another way
