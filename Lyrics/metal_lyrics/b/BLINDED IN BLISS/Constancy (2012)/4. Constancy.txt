Never followed
always led myself through life
never deceived
never faltered
never blinded in the darkest nights
learned long ago, to trust myself

Your thoughts, your own
your fate, you make
just trust in who you are
your dreams aren't very far

When you're faced with doubt
entangled in your fear
you break the binds that hold you back
embrace your fate
your dreams you make
through constancy, constantly

Stumbled upon a river of trust
watched the weak, drown before me
victims to forsaken lies, overcome by desperate times
and we all go down that road
where we find ourselves
it's who you choose to be that defines you
trust in no one else

Your thoughts, your own
your fate, you make
just trust in who you are
your dreams aren't very far

When you're faced with doubt
entangled in your fear
you break the binds that hold you back
embrace your fate
your dreams you make
through constancy, constantly

Realize, even as time goes by
we remain the same
despite, the transformations
we'll find, we will find
i trust our values are embedded deep inside
your hopes your dreams
are never out of reach

Stumbled upon a river of trust
watched the weak, drown before me
victims to forsaken lies, overcome by desperate times
all, all my life
i've waited for, one touch, one tase,
a glimpse, my right

Our constancy remains strong
our constancy will go on
