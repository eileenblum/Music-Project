So pure
so precious
so rare, the bond that we share
true friends, you'll fight for
you'll bleed for again and again

Have you ever taken a turn for the worst
never really knowing why
have you felt the weight of the world
held back as it passed you by
but no matter how hard it gets
it doesnt matter how far you fall
when your world comes crashing down
you can always rely on

Good times
old faithful
living life one day at a time
united, eternal
we will never forget
where we're from

And who we are
and what we've been through
brothers to arms

We will never forget
the ones we lost
together we stand
we will never fall

This world is cruel
but we're in it together
i got your back and you got mine
living life one day at a time
just live in the moment reach out and own it

Remember
who we are
and where we came from
and what we've been through
forget the noise
for the will teach us
to have faith in who
in who we are

When i was down and out,
you believed in me
when darkness shrouded my path,
your faith it compelled me
to push as hard as i could
to work as hard as i should
for all the people i love and care for
this is for you

Have you ever taken a turn for the worst
never really knowing why
have you felt the weight of the world
held back as it passed you by
but no matter how hard it gets
it doesnt matter how far you fall
when your world comes crashing down
you can always rely on

All the memories and all that's still to come
and everything we stand for
moving forth as one
