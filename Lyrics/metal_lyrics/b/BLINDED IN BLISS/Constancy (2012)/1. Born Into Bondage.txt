Born into this world
Not knowing who we are
Given this identity
Forced fed reality
Hurtling through space
With limited perception of who we are
And why we're here

All we know is we are capable of love
Like the love we show for our music
And it feels like the love we show for the young
Shining light into the darkest places

Into the world at large not just your one perspective
Keep in mind that this world is divided amongst itself
The blind lead the blind
The sheeple herd themselves
Propaganda working on our minds
Shaping our world views

You were born into bondage
Isolated from what we could be
The truth
Sacrifice yourself
We were born into bondage
Forced to live this lie
Confined within society
Sacrifice

Your world view for an open mind
Seek the truth, seek it all the time
Place the blame on our ignorance
Take control of its governance

All we know is we are capable of love
Like the love we show for our music
And it feels like the love we show for the young
Shining light into the darkest places

You were born into this world
Bound by rule and law
For the purpose to benefit the state
Fight for everything you love
Hold dearly to your rights

And rights of everyone upon this world

We can make this change today
All that we are is the result of what we have thought
We can learn to live another way
Forget these broken promises
Cast out the veil
Your life's before you
No country, no rule, no law defines you
We are all the same expressed in different ways
