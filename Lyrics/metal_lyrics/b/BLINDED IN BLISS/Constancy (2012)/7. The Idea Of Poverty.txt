The whole weight of this world
it bears down unto you
manipulation of our governments
profit preaching providence

The cost for you to live
a price you can't afford
the body bags they fill each day
they were forced to live this way

Covet resources
profit of out need
the disregard for life
spreading the disease

Privatize your social systems
buying your rights
modern day slavery
a product of poverty

Like time controls the things we've done
it will never let us back
like time controls the things we've done
we will never come again
it's what we do right here and right now
that sets us on ourt path
the choise is ours to take this leap
to shape this world for harmony

Covet resources
profit of out need
the disregard for life
spreading the disease

The pyramid, that represents
the pain and misery
the ones who sit upon its top
their hearts are filled with greed
there is no room for you and me
its only give or take
in a world where children starve at night
the idea of poverty

This global conspiracy
expose their treachery
light will prevail, here
awaken your mind's eye
this world is ours
seek to expose the truth
the power of thought
it holds weight over you
like the wieght that they held over us
this world is awakening
sick of the suffering
change is calling for you
for you
for you
