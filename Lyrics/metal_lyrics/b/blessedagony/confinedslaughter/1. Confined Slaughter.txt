Welcome to the opposite of all your opposites
No matter where you go you will always be dead
I bring you to the slaughtering of life
I focused on confinement to trade for your time, you scream
This world will pay for your death and we all will laugh when your losing your final breath I don't care
How much of yourself I wanting the freedom you will not and will never taste it
All this time all this time all this time traded for nothing
All this time has given my hurt with the blood that is on my hands

To a spiteful god, confined slaughtering of my internal pride damn this life a broken deal of time
Bring you to your grave, your name has been erased
Your name has been erased confined slaughtering of me

Wait for your blood why I burn innocence can not be alive
We pay for your time for time burn for your life, you will learn
All the confined slaughter of me I don't see through the bars of this disease
I live it without a life without a life a better life 
I scream goodbye, love to a dead world, goodbye
