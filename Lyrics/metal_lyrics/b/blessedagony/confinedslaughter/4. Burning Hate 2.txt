Instant change from sane to rage unlocked my kindred evil
Fortunate to know the passage I crawled through pins and needles
Enough of this unmeasurable pain all this anger too much too sustain in my veins
Blood boils at a different degree this is the true honesty of what I need
Unknown follow the path I have shown
Capable spite can only be my real label
Face down smell the entrance to my grave
Unrestrained focused to make life my slave

It goes into my wretched core same forced feeling as before not anymore
I will not put up with this shit this burning hate my life has accept
Does anyone understand what pressure weighs this man
Does he have a plan does he have to live
Are you able to hear subliminal welcoming to fear
Why be afraid to be near what is left to give
Does he have to live what is left to give
My beautiful burning hate

Decadence the way I feel about my inner self
Pestilence a sickness I cannot rid of
A hatred that I fell in love a weakness within the system
A saviour has made me a victim a coward that has lived his day
A murderer who escaped his ways a survivor I have not fell apart
At peace with the hate in my heart
