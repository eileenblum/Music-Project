Does it matter, all the pieces of your life you have lost
My presence is shattered, open to you for all it cost
It is an honest opinion, an ignorant decision, a life ending incision
This is what always burned, this your messiah will have to learn

Inside this lonely mind hides another danger you cannot deny
All this is, another focus, on my madness
Explain it, attempted misery, addicted sadness
All my torment can it be described all my torment will it leave from inside
All this is, another focus on my madness
Explain it, attempted misery, addicted sadness
All my struggle can it be justified all my struggle amplified why
Every day another struggle every day lived in fucking torment

All these fears made up of nothing all my life tricked into killing myself and the shit about me
Fuck this world and all around me for being in my life and wasting my time
I bury the remains, I end it with my own life I end it with my own life
Failure incompetence rejection resistance this is my natural torment
