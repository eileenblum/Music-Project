I do not want to know anybody's fucking name
I do not want to hear about anyone else's pain
I cannot sustain much of society's ways
I cannot believe unless it is right in front of me
Cannot stop,cannot trust, cannot back away
Keep quiet do not speak, only I can say
You cannot have a word in this your sorrow becomes my bliss
I witnessed a mass destruction a fatal war fought for society's construction
You have no better direction this will be your fucking lesson
It is all about you, you know it's a fact
It is all about you, why is that

Only the enemies know about my revenge
Only few have told the story and lived
Only the ones like this have blood to shed
Only to this world, will you always be dead
Fuck you all it all comes down to you what is named to be true

I have found a separate fixation I have stomped the ground's impression
All focused upon bettering one's self all your turmoil brought upon by guilt
It slowly changes by hope of life fucked yourself by wasting time
Cannot escape your own labyrinth of strain
Feeble-minded you cannot have what you may
I have realized it was all about you I comply to trying to fuck you
It is all about you, you know that's a fact
It is about you, why is that
