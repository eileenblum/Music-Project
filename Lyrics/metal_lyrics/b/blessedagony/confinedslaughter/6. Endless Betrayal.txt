End time witness end time never alive
Ever find calming all that is forming time no time for lies again
Endless at fault betrayal cause I try to find a better place
Writhe, forever, always held together
All I am wanting never mine it is still longing inside
All the pain's pride, dies crucified unless I find life
Access to life all found inside the veins where blood flows

Don't you ever see forbidden agony alive
All I am forming ties all before me don't you lie
Inside my head you must see endless betrayal for nothing in me
Awful love come to me break the rules bend the bones revenge with shame
Love for me died long ago everywhere I look
Another reason to show why I hate found in everyone the damage of a god
Only believe in shit He does not fucking exist why I burn alive burn
