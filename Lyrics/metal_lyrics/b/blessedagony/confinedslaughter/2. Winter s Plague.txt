I have to be your wrong answer we loathe this night
It is not what it is supposed to be a better tie to burn
The cold is in my heart created a better me will you accept despise
You why you loathe me I have become regrets
Why you loathe me I focus on all the pain
I cannot begin to feed endlessly

I have got a better dream without you being apart of me
I force a broken reclaim upon my hands, the blood of a saint
I set myself free from this and all disease the winter will take you away
Low below the ground you will find me
Under grave snow, on my head stone
Low below the ground you will find me
