[K. Bachman / J. Daub / J. Winters / D. Mann]

Theoretical physics
Mathematical speculation
Scientifically seduced
By abstract calculation

Gravitational waves
Energy-extraction
Astrophysical
Sci-fi investigation

Singularity
Infinity

All hope abandon
Those who enter here
Region of infinite density
End of time, realistic fear

Singularity
Infinity

Beware of what you ask for
For you might get it
The Darwinist, the humanist
The hedonist, the legalist

Singularity
Infinity
