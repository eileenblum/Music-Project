[K. Bachman / J. Daub / J. Winters / D. Mann / D. Baddorf]

No more will I regress backward
From what which I believe
I owe no man an explanation
Expect no apology

Logic defends age old prophecies
Christ's life, death and resurrection
Proof of absolute deity
Expect no apology

Not one regret
Impenitent

No more will I regress backward
From that which I believe
I owe no man an explanation
Expect no apology

Not one regret
Impenitent
