[K. Bachman / J. Daub / J. Winters]

Living proof of what can be
Escaping from life's tragedy
Learning through another's mind
To catch a glimpse beyond the skies

Mental rush of abstract pain
Never asking what's to gain
Never lost in splintered eyes
Focused on what inward lies

Return to me, I'll return to you
I will not change, to justify you

Living proof of what must be
Broken from the misery
Never lost in present time
Always seeking future mind

Return to me, I'll return to you
I will not change, to justify you

[Mat. 7:3; Malachi 3:6-7]
