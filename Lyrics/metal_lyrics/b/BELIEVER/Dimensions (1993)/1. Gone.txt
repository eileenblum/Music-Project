[K. Bachman / J. Daub / J. Winters]

I feel fine now, the past is gone
The book reads my name, I've been issued a new life

Stupidity flows, the more you speak
Insanity grows, the more I think
Religious ideals, cross parallels

Static thoughts, swallowing me
Crippled mind, all I am is gone

Reality fades, time rules my life
Kaleidoscopic days, lost within cries
Confusion consumes, broken, I bleed

Static thoughts, swallowing me
Broken wing, horrific dream
Crippled mind, all I am is gone

[Rev. 20:12]
