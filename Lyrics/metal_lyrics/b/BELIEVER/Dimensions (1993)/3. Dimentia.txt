[K. Bachman / J. Daub / J. Winters / D. Mann]

Reason argues the existence of God
If the incarnate was crucified
The dialectical paradox concludes
That God has already died [1]

The very nature of man's independence
Implies accountability for one's actions [2]
My decision to be free or not to be
Reveals the magnitude of my freedom [3]

Where is the wise man
Scholar of this age?
Their dementia calls
From their dimension

Freud argued that God is but mere illusion
Our need for some cosmic comforter
To resolve our deepest childhood neurosis
A belief based wholly on an unfulfilled wish [4]

Or is this world a random occurrence
A change reshuffling of matter?
Particles in motion in a corner of the universe
The origin of life and evolution an accident? [5]

Where is the wise man
Scholar of this age?
Their dementia calls
Leading men to the grave
Where is the wise man
Scholar of this age?
Their dementia calls
From their dimension
