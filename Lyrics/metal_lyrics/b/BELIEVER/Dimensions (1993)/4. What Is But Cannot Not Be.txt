[K. Bachman / J. Daub / J. Winters / D. Mann]

Possibility cannot
Account for actuality
Whatever can come to be
Is caused in order to be

Nothing cannot be something
I am but can not be
My existence depends on
What is but cannot not be

Every effect has a cause
Principle of causality
The existence of God is
Theistic relativity

The God the heart needs
The mind only frieves
