[K. Bachman, J. Daub, D. Baddorf, H. Kraft]

When evil men advance to devour my flesh
When enemies attack, their will to oppress
When bloody wars break loose and armies draw near
In the day of distress my heart will not fear

PAIN, MENTAL torment
SAVED from DEATH

Trapped in mental pain, agony within
Life consumed by anguish, endurance wearing thin
Tormented by misery, struggling to stand
Growing weak with sorrow, my grief is in your hands

Struck down but not destroyed, you lift me from the depths
You brought me from the grave, redemption from death
Hard pressed on every side but not in despair
Never on my own, your presence everywhere

[Psalms 30, 31; 2 Corinthians 4:8]
