[K. Bachman, J. Daub, D. Baddorf, H. Kraft]

What's the use of worrying
What good does it do?
Will it add a single day
To your life?

PANIC - no more
WORRY - about what?
STRESSING - no need
When you HAVE THE LORD

Constant troubles of your mind
Past, present, future time
Problems building up inside
Leave it all behind

Rid yourself of needless tension
Lay your burdens on the Lord
He will give you strength you need
If you'll believe His Word

[Luke 12:22-31]
