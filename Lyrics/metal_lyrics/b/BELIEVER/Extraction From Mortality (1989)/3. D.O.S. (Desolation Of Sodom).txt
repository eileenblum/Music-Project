[K. Bachman, J. Daub, D. Baddorf, H. Kraft]

All the men of Sodom
Sin had infested
Rampant wickedness
Perverse mortal race
Evil running loose
Misleading minds and souls
Vile unrestraint
Malignant disgrace

DESOLATION OF SODOM
The heavens poured forth fire
GOMORRAH'S DESTRUCTION
Repentance the Lord does require

Lifeless without breath
Wood and rock were hewn
Men did idolize
These pagan gods of stone
Heathens disobeyed
Defying God's commands
But Lot was undefiled
Mercy was his alone

Devastation of life
Brought by God's own might
Eternal punishment
For all with corrupt desires
God despises sin
For the blood shed on the cross
Refines us within
And spares eternal fire

[Genesis 19; 2 Peter 2:6]
