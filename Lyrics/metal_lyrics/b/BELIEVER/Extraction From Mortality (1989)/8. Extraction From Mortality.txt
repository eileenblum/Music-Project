[K. Bachman, J. Daub, D. Baddorf, H. Kraft]

What good would result for a man
By gaining the world but losing his soul?
Love not the world
Or the wrath of the Father you will behold

Do not conform to evil
The desires conceived in ignorance
Choosing to befriend the world
Brings hatred from God as a consequence

DEATH, SIN
Extraction From Mortality
WORDLY REJECTION
Deliverance from agony

Men would love you as their own
If you belonged to this earthly realm
Mankind hates the ones
Who do not conform but rebel

Everyone born of God
Will not face eternal decay
Death they will overcome
The ways of man will pass away

Be transformed by renewing
The intentions and thoughts of your mind
Your life must be hidden in Christ
Leaving the corrupted flesh behind

[Colossians 3:23; 1 Corinthians 7:31; Hebrews 11:25]
