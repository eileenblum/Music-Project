[K. Bachman, J. Daub, D. Baddorf, H. Kraft]

Obeying worthless idols
The prophets prophesied
Manifesting omens
Delusions of their minds
Claiming total wisdom
Knowledge from above
Ordained not from the Father
Ignorance of love

Woe to you o'teachers
Instructors of the law
You who play religion
Impelling men to fall
Legalistic actions
Neglecting man's distress
Outer shells of virtue
Inner wickedness

You blind the eyes that seek to see
Deceiving humanity
Denying God by deeds
Yet claiming intimacy

Drawing lambs to slaughter
Victims of deceit
Unaware they follow
Minds becoming weak
Vile hypocrisy
Method of defense
For rejection of Christ
Eternal consequence

Heed the written warnings
Of deceptive lies
Neglect deceitful guidance
Apostasy defy
There is nothing concealed
That won't be made known
Sifting inner motives
Judgement for what's shown

[Matthew 7:15, 13:22, 23:25; Mark 13:22; Titus 1:16; Jeremiah 2:6, 5:31, 14:14]
