Love and hate
Imprisoned fate
No soul to take

Win or lose
No will to choose
Dimensions fuse

I
Stare thru unconscious eyes
Create this world of mine
Blind
Is my whole life a lie
I fear this future mind

Plug me in
Let this begin
I freeze within

Thinking fades
Death delayed
The womb remade

Dreamless sleep
Into deep
No longer me

Why
Are all my lives a lie
I canât believe my eyes
Die
Trying to win this fight
To free my future mind
