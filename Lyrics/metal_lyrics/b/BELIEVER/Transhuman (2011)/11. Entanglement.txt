Finding my way through this maze
Itâs all about time, all about pain
Thereâs light but no warmth
A face with no name
Awake to find itâs all the same

Perceptions blur
Iâve made it rain again

Staring at the wall
Itâs 4:44
Focused as the water falls
The voices come and voices go
The puppets laugh, as madness grows

Perceptions blur
Iâve made it rain again
Emotions burn
Distorting truth within
