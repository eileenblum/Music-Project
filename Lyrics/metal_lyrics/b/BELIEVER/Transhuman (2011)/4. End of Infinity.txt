Take a look behind the mask
Reveal the wounds from shattered past
Break my silence

I will reap what I have sown
Static thoughts become my home
Dig my grave as memories fade

Dig my grave

Blind my eyes

Visions burning thoughts of time
Reckless ways destroy my mind
Must let go so I can fall

Watch me fall
