Brave this world
Toss and turn
The skin that burns
Curse the ones that save us

Welcome to my world
Itâs 3 oâclock AM

Truth in lies
Cryptic eyes
Unconscious cries
You have to trust me, Iâm you

Welcome to my mind
Iâm blacking out again

Invaded years
Blood-soaked ears
Betrayed by fears of breaking

Welcome to my world
Itâs 3 oâclock AM
Welcome to my mind
Iâm blacking out again
