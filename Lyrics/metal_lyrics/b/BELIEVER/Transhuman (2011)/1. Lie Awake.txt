This realized fear and stalled time
Chasing dreams, I canât find
I hear your screams, feel your breath
As daylight fades, Iâm looking back

Lie Awake
I stand before you
Lie Awake
Wipe the tears and close your eyes

Remembering this past life
Sadness grows with each night
Time will heal, remains untrue
How my strength could save you

You look for me, through red eyes
Increasing fears and dark skies
Concentrate to pull through
Dim the light, Iâm with you

Lie Awake
A choice before me
Lie Awake
Wipe the tears and say goodbye
