Reduce myself
Into the nothing

This place of things
Is always changing
Becoming lost
With night approaching

Zero me
Into oblivion
Erase me
Embrace my illusion

Reduce myself
Into the nothing
Spiral down
And bleed the knowing

Zero me
Into oblivion
Erase me
Embrace my delusion
