Infinite worlds
Parallel lives
The past returns
To late to change my mind

Motion in space
Closed time-like curves
Accelerate
And leave behind this curse

Somewhere in time
Quantum recall
I have arrived
The shadows fall

I canât build this machine
To give me what I need

Exotic state
Traverse inside
Back calculate
To help me synchronize
