Weak and cold
Forseen tragedy
Rest in pain
As we say goodbye

Needle in vein
Internalize this strife
What are the reasons
For this draining life

Brave in brave out
Readied for true reality
Broken I must grieve

In line in light
I am the new design
And tell me the lie that
It will be all right
It will be all right

Over and over again
The rhythm to pave my way
It will be all right

Brave in brave out
Readied for true reality
Broken I must grieve

Brave in brave out
Ready and willing

Brave in brave out
Readied for true reality
Broken I must grieve
Brave in brave out
Embracing this harsh reality
Broken I proceed
