Sleep has evaded night
No sense of dark or cold
It must be a nightmare
Or vampires thirsting

Only distance is a curse to me
For what is has always been
Keep the light on and wait
Smile at the fear
That has crept inside of you

Oxidize and fragment
Devour and absorb
Rule the dirt and blood
King among the poor

Zeros eating ones
Promise made to dream
Head down and heart heavy bleed

Run through my mind
Regression and theory design
How much for love
In this fools game

Oxidize and fragment
Devour and absorb
Rule the dirt and blood
King among the poor

Given choices
You cannot get
Riches earned
Not to expect

Sleep has evaded night
No sense of dark or cold
It must be a nightmare
Or vampires thirsting

Oxidize and fragment
Devour and absorb
Rule the dirt and blood
King among the poor
