You world
You can't hurt me
I wont feel a thing
You world
Whatever your want
Master bows to the slave

Fly high and grind away
Light dies and they invade

There's a time and place
To possess your fate
Whispers in your mind
Your will is theirs to take

Fly high and grind away
Light dies and they invade

When you choose to wake
Fear is all you see
Dreams will come to pass
Hell nightmares and screams

Fly high and grind away
Light dies and they invade
Fly high and burn away
Black eyes they invade
