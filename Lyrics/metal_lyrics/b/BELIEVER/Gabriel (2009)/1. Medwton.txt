Cipher and play
For all that will be
Pour from this bowl
To set death free

Is it worth fighting for
Is this worth dying for
Clouded with uncertainty
This calculation is killing me

Hidden from view
Mind to find doom
Are you there
I am coming soon

Is it worth fighting for
Is this worth dying for
Clouded with uncertainty
This calculation is killing me

Days and nights are gone
Seven years of shame
Melted tongues appear
What's there to fear

Is it worth fighting for
Is this worth dying for
Clouded with uncertainty
This calculation is killing me
