In this time of sorrow
Where will I turn
Every road leads away
I cannot stay

The time to mourn is now
Before the hatred heals
And time conceals
What lies have revealed

Shut out the sun
Embrace your pain
And leave your fears with me

Leave the peace
Though it bleeds
Bring the child to me
It is time to feed

Shut out the sun
Embrace your pain
And leave your fears with me

Shut out the sun
Embrace my pain
And tear my fears from me
