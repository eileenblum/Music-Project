You have your pen
And a rodent leash
Numbing the pain
Is within your reach

Journey through time
Rapture divine
Are you on-line
Believe your mind

Push the button
Retrieve your high
Just hit send
And await your reply

Inside your cage
On a monkey high
Nothing excites
But more monkey lies

Journey through time
Rapture divine
Are you on-line
Believe your mind

Devolve
Your freedom dies
Your happiness
Lies outside your mind

Journey through time
Rapture divine
Are you on-line
Believe your mind

Journey through time
Rapture on-line
Are you divine
Believe your mind
