Distance and time unite
Like acid and rain
To reveal creative stress
Of universal pain

My eyes are sewn shut
All brilliance unseen
With evidence so clear
Believe

Light decoding past
Elemental chaos reigns
Matter and force collide
Pulsing radio waves

My eyes are sewn shut
All brilliance unseen
With evidence so clear
Believe

Electromagnetic effect
Collapse and feed
Expand to contrast
Fulfill the blackest need

Data lost eternal
Savage lust for mass
Prepare for violent birth
The first becomes last

My eyes are sewn shut
All brilliance unseen
With evidence so clear
Believe
