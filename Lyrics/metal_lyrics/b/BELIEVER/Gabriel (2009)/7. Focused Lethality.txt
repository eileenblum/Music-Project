We are the crazy ones
Hated are we
Crush the false strength
Only we will see

Blood filled eyes
Horror flows with ease
Shut up you fools
Bow on bloodied knee

Increase the pain
Endgame release

Reveal the power now
Crown of life engaged
We have the force
Indulge in our rage

Increase the pain
Endgame release

We are the crazy ones
Hated are we
Crush the false strength
Only we will see
Horror flows with ease

Increase the pain
Endgame release
