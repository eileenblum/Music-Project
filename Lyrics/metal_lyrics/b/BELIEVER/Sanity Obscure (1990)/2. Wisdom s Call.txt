How long, will you, simple ones, love your, simple ways
And continue to reject the calling of wisdom?
Fools mock, at making, amends, for sin
You fools detest turning from evil

Does not, wisdom, cry out, aloud, does not
Understanding raise her voice?
The wise, attaining, wisdom, and discipline
Listen and add to their learning

Worth more, than silver, yields more, than gold
Nothing you desire can compare with her
Those who, find her, through Christ, find life
All those who hate her love death

Why don't you open up your mind
Can't you hear wisdom's cry?

[Proverbs 1:2, 5, 20-22; 3:13, 14; 8:1, 9, 35-36; 13:19; 14:9]
