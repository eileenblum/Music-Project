Just an ignorant child
Brainwashed by this decaying world
Always searching to belong
Endless fear of being alone

Line by line
I watch you die
Too blind to see
Your shattered dreams

Weary from the boring routine
The dependency grows
Taught to listen to the wise
But only heard the fools

Body once unscarred
Now being murdered by stupidity
Realization of the truth
Brings freedom in captivity

[John 14:6; John 8:32]
