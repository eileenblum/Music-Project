Toxic waste corrupts the air
Adulteration of man's breath
The sky pours forth rains of acid
Waters of life now bring death

Clear cuts espose the land
Forest ravaged by greed
Corporate lies being bought
Destruction for profit their creed

Surrounded by nonpoint filth
Pollution's silent killer
Ignoring our earth's decline
Out of sight, out of mind

Established upon the deep
Founded upon the seas
The earth became infected
From the fall came its disease

Pollution corrupts your soul
Wake up from your careless sleep
Open your eyes to see
What you sow you'll surely reap

[Psalm 24:2; Revelation 16:15; Galatians 6:7]
