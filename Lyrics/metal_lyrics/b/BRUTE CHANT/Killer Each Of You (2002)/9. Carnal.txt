It was so dark around that
I couldn't see a thing
Try to switch the light on
Illuminate the mark inside
Doubts' wall close to each other
Inner voices speak to one another
Counter-attack and turning back
Illuminate the chaos inside

A tired staff of a body
Disabled to serve
Brakes further development
The pay-back for false knowledge
Inside the carnal labyrinth
The sweetest dead end
Awaits cold moveless senses
A law court of wrong feeling

As a disharmonic temple
Every exchange to accept
Until unpunished I go
Towards all doomed failures

There isn't any unnecessary matter
Everything seems good and worthy
The more you get the better you feel
Even some voice says - no
Respecting, slaving completely
In disability to refuse
For I need more - much more
The temple is almost fallen.
