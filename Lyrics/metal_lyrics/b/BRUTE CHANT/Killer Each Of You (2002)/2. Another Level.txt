Turning
Get the pain deserved
Blinding
Always lurking to be seen
Cheap joint is only fun
Never the kind,
never the polite way
Turning
Blinding

The joint gives all the fun
Enjoying to be disliked
Is there another level
to be thrown off?

Another shit to dive in
Another pleasant dive in

A deeper pit
Another level
to be thrown off...

Rising to the madness
Life told to be fine
I'm hiding my real pleasure
You are hiding yours
