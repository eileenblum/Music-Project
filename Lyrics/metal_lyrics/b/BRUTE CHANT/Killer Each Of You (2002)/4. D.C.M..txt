[Dead Cows Milk]

Shit falls down, down
The time is now...
We should beware the dead cow

She brought us disease
Brought pain, collapse
But the kick we are getting
Comes from the dead cows milk

In a perfect suit
Ties tied, shoes shine
Making war each day
We march with a stoner smile

"Bring the poison!"
our soundless roar
We made it we use it
Let the shit go down!

Perfectly sickened world
And we are fed with its juice
Blindly stomped through
Made the cow more dead.
