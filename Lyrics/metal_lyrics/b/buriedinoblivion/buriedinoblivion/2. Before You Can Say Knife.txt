The clock of life turned fifteen
That was the day of my destiny
A twist of fate in the story of our protagonist
Whom the gods love die young

(IN THIS CASE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK)

And stand strong
Cause you were picked to bleed to give up
And miss the target

And so 
(You're live trapped)
In this bed

Was it worth it?
Don't you repent it?
With deep 
With deep regret
I have 
I have to announce that you're dead

I wrote a poem (BREE BREE BREE)
'Bout your misery (bree)

One (for sorrow)
Two (for joy)
Three (for a girl)
Four (for a boy) 
Five for silver
Six for gold
Seven for a secret never to be told [2x] 

Before you can say knife [3x]
