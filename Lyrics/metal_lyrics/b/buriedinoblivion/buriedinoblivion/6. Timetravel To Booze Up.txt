This is my time travel 
To booze-up 
From Monday to Friday 

Now!

Eight hours a day
No seeing sunlight
Five days left until it shines bright

Eight hours a day
No seeing sunlight
Five days left until it shines bright

Lightning victory as we reach the end

A sense of delight that I keep forever

(No holding back for me) 

A sense of delight that I keep forever 

(No holding back for me) 

Eight hours a day 
No seeing sunlight
Five days left until it shines bright

Don't tell me how to party

Let's break out
Like it's our last day
And break it all away 
Let's speed this shit up
It's my last trip 

No time to waste 
I'm restless
To bring out the best 
And keep with the pace

(The ultimate ambition)
My View of life
(The ultimate ambition) 
My view of life

No time to waste 
I'm restless
To bring out the best
And keep with the pace
The ultimate ambition
My view of life
The ultimate ambition
My view of life

There is no time to waste [2x]

Let's break out
Like it's our last
Like our...our last day...
