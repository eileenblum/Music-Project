Once upon a time
All you did was to retrieve 
Now you are a killer
All you did was to believe 
That the life you're livin' is your personal relief

But you know the truth
Pigs might fly

Take the chance you're givin'
Instead of blaming your misery
To the species you don't know

Guess who is judging everything you do [2x]

Once upon a time
All you did was to retrieve 
Now you are a killer
All you did was to believe 
(That the life you're livin' is your personal relief)

Rot down in earth

Your life is unworth [2x]

Goodbye! 

You pay it now... your penalty

[3x]
Break you down to the core of your existence 
Receive your fucking deserts 

Guess who is judging everything you do [3x]
