I don't fuckin' care

Screm dreaming
I am waking up now and forever
Raising a smile to your well-deserved death
Hells claws reaching out

I would've done everything
Even tie this fucking rope for you 
And kick this fucking chair
For every fucking second I've wasted 

On you

Yeah okay you've had your reasons 
Wait you couldn't name me even one

What the fuck did you 
What the fuck did you 
What the fuck did you 
What the fuck did you expect?

I'm on my last legs
Maybe I won't even see the light before I go

But my last breath
I'll waste once more for you
An exclaim in delight
To your bloody downfall

The murder is out
A murder of crows
Covering the skies
As I raise my axe
To spill your guts
To decapitate you

"PERISH THE THOUGHT" 

They scream....
