I woke up in a new world six months ago
A new life has just begun 
Where nothing matters to me now 
Where emptiness became a whole new expression 
Where everything is turned upside down
Where drugs help to suffer the shit you put me through
Where thinking is mental torture 
Where living means to be dead

I'm laying here in my deathbed at night
Your scythes still reach my fucked up mind 
Sucking the blood out of my corpse

All hell is let loose
All hell is let loose

This must be a nightmare 
It was the night of the murder
It couldn't hit me harder
You stabbed me in the back
You took my life once
And broke my heart twice

I cant explain how much you meant to me
An overwhelming desire to keep you forever

But you... 
You left me here for dead

What did you do to me?
You resurrected me 
You released me 
And with one bloody smash 
You took my life away 

Put me out of this misery.. 
May god rest my soul...
