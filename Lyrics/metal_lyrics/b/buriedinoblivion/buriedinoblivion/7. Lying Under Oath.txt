GO!

[2x]
All those who trick me
Will dine in hell
Wrong thoughts live in me
Abusing well

Liars around me 
The black of the past is still here

[2x]
I will remember what you said
Staying right with me
And now you're dead

You...
You...

Hell!

You're like a skull to me 
You're smiling on the outside
But you are so dead inside
You're drowning in
Mythomania 

[2x]
You need help
To be
Something more
Than this

[2x]
All those who trick me
Will dine in hell
Wrong thoughts live in me
Abusing well

You were heading to an awesome future 
Now you're heading to an awful torture

Lying under oath

Hell!

You're like a skull to me
You're smiling on the outside
But you are so dead inside
You're drowning 
Mythomania

You're like a skull to me
You're smiling on the outside
But you are so dead inside
You're drowning
Mythomania
