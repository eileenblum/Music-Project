[3x]
Our desires 
Our entire
Life was meant to
Stand for something

And there is nothing 
That stomps in my way
To break my effort
To become what I want
I want to break my effort
To become...

And there is times when the light give out
And the darkness flows
When every hope is gone and I'm on my own

Worlds collapse as I transform my rage and sorrow to

Decibel [2x]

All my rage to decibel

Breakdown!

[2x]
Chasing all my fears
Drive for something more

Scream until your lungs give out
Our rage turns to...

Decibel

Our rage turns to...

Decibel

Chasing all my fears
Driving for something more
Want it more than anybody else...

Our life stands for something
Our life stands for something

[2x]
Chasing all my fears 
Driving for something more
Want it more than anybody else

(Ouh a piece of candy)

[2x]
Chasing all my fears 
Driving for something more
