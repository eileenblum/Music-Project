[Lyrics - Strokirk, Music - Strokirk]

The Day I Didnât See Your Eyes
Like A Stranger
I Wasnât There

Felt Like The Unwanted Child
Surrounded By Hate
You Used To Be Here
But Now Youâre There
No Good Or Bad
Justifies Your Departure
All Thatâs Left Is Regret
For The Unspoken Words

Your Words I Tried To Grasp
But They Meant Nothing
You Pushed Away
I Wanted To Touch You
But Didnât Dare
Now I Have Lost You
Can Only Touch You In My Dreams

Lost To Eternity
Got No One At All To Blame
Lost To Eternity
As I Fall Into Deadness
