[Lyrics - Strokirk, Music - Strokirk, Stabel]

They Say The Beast Is Down Below
I Think Heâs Near Heâs Right Up Here

Down Below Or
Right Up Here

You Draw The Straw
Than Walk The Path

See The Madness
Open Your Eyes
Amputation Of Our Beliefs
I Was Raised To Believe In The Better
Now I See All This Dreams Canât  Be Real

I Canât Deny Some Certain Things
Do Clear The Weather But Just For A While

The Foolish Dream Lives On And On
Until We See The Beast Within
