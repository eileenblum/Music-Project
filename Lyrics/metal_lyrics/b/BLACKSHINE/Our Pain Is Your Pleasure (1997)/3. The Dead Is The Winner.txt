[Lyrics - Strokirk, Music - Strokirk]

As I Die Canât You See Iâm Laughing In Your Face
As I Die Canât You See That Iâm The One Who Won
Now Iâm Free So Far Away From You
My Final Prize Is The Pain That You Soon Will Feel

Now Hear My Laugh Cut Through The Air
Straight Through Your Bones Leave Scars Till Death
Now Feel The Pain That I Used To Feel

Love Will Kill Everybody Knows Iâm Right
To Forget Is To Survive Another Day
Until You See That It Always The Same
The Pain Is There Where Your Heart Is Always Been

Sometimes It Feels That Iâm Learning To Lose
To Be A Broken Man Forever
Until You See You Canât Do More Than Laugh Right At It
And To Be Sure That You Soon Will Feel The Same
