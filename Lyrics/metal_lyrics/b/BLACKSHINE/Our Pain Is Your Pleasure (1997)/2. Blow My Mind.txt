[Lyrics - Stabel, Music - Strokirk, Stabel]

Iâm Angry,
Iâm Drinking
It Doesnât Matter
What No Other Say
When Life Seems Way To Tough
I Cork Up The Bottle
And Just Canât Get Enough

I Donât Misuse Alcohol
I Abuse Alcohol
When The Pain Doesnât End
It Seems Like My Only Friend

Iâm Angry,
Iâm Drinking
When It Feels Like Iâm Locked In A Cage
Doesnât Help  But For The Moment It Seems
That Alcohol Is The Way To Unlock Me
From My Rage

It Doesnât Solve Anything
But It Helps Me To Think
Maybe I Donât Want To Think
Anyway Give Me A Drink

Yeah Iâve Got To Blow My Mind
Give Me A Drink Of Any Kind
Yeah Iâve Got To Blow My Mind
Too Many Sorrows Just Canât Leave Behind

Iâm Angry,
Iâm Drinking
Sometimes Life Gets So Fucking Hard
Doesnât Matter What No Others Say
I Relieve The Pain In A Very Wet Way

Yeah Iâve Got To Blow My Mind
Give Me A Drink Of Any Kind
Yeah Iâve Got To Blow My Mind
Too Many Sorrows Just Canât Leave Behind
Yeah Iâve Got To Blow My Mind
So Fucking Angry And It Just Wonât Go Away
Yeah Iâve Got To Blow My Mind
Iâll Take Care Of Reality Another Day
