[Lyrics - Stabel, Strokirk, Music - Stabel]

I Woke Up An Early Morning
My Head Was Full Of Why
I Knew That This Is It
It Was A Nice Day To Die
I Looked Out Through My Window
Pain Was All I Could See
I Knew Nothing Could Stop Me Now
For Me Tomorrow Would Never Be

As I Stood In Front Of The Mirror
My Decision Was Made
I Realized This World Wasnât Meant For Me
I Knew The Time Was Coming Closer
So I Loaded My Gun
I Shot Myself In The Head
Now Iâm Dead
Iâm Glad Itâs Done

I Never Thought I Would Ever
Gonna End Up This Way
I Never Thought Iâd Forbid
Myself Another Day
I Never Thought Iâd Would Ever
Make Myself Die
Now Anyway It Is
Forever Goodbye
