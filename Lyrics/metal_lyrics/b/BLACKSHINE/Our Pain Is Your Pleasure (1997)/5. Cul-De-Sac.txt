[Lyrics - Strokirk, Music - Stabel, Strokirk]

Feel The Pain
As Your Time Passes By
Your Life
Seems Soon To End
As You Spill Your Life Away

Break The Chains
Free Yourself
Break Away
From The Narrow -Minded Way

No Regrets
Your Choice Has Been Made
As You Turned Away
Away From Yourself

You Narrow-Minded Breed
You Cannot Win
