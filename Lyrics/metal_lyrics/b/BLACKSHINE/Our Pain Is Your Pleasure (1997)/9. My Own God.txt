[Lyrics - Stabel, Music - Stabel, Strokirk]

I Canât Stand It
You Know Hate It
When They Point Their Fingers At Me
And Say âI Know What The Best For You. Copy Me. I Know The Wayâ

Iâll Be Here When You Die

Itâs Seems So Hopeless
But It Needs To Be Said
Iâm My Own God
Until The Day Iâm Dead
But They Donât Seem To Understand
Canât Get It Into Their Heads

Iâll Be Here When You Die

Theyâre So Blind
Yet I Hope They See
I Do It This Way
To Keep On Being Me
Upstream Is The Way I Go
The Only Way To Be Free

Iâll Be Here When You Die
