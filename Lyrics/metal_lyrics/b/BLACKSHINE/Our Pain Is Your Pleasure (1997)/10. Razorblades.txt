[Lyrics - Stabel, Music - Stabel, Strokirk, Holmberg]

Afraid Of What Will Come
We Always Choose The Easy Way
Trying Not To Offer Others
We Just Fit In And Do As They Say
Weâre So Afraid To Differ From The Masses
We Try To Belong
One Day Weâll Realize That We Are Copies
But Then Youth Will Be Gone

Your Way Is The Way
Do As You Please
Razorblades Might Cut Deep
If You Let Regret Into Your Mind

Now IS When We Choose To Live
The Future Is Only A Fantasy
Today Is Real
Who Knows About Tomorrow
As Far As I Know It Might Never Be
So Do As You Feel Now
No Matter What All Other Say
One Day It Will Be Too Late
And Razorblades Will Seem The Only Way

Your Way Is The Way
Do As You Please
Razorblades Might Cut Deep
If You Let Regret Into Your Mind
