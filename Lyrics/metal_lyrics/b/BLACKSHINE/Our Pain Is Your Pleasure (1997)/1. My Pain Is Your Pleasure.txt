[Lyrics - Strokirk, Music - Strokirk, Holmberg]

I Should Not Trust You
You Should Me Why
It Seems To Amuse You
By That Smile On Your Face
I Know By Now That You Ainât The One
The One To Trust And Who Never Betrays

My Pain Is Your Pleasure
Raised Through Hate To Another

In Search For Human Sense
I See Them All
Betrayed By Other
They Do The Same
Like A Disease
To Which Thereâs No Cure Now
No One To Trust
Thereâs Only Yourself

I Asked You Why
You Couldnât Tell
Thereâs A Reason In Your Past
That Can Tell
You Betrayed Me
I Turned Away Now You See Youâre Betrayed
By Yourself
