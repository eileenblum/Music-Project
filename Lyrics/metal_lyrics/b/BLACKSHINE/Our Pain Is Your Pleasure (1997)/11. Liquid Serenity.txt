[Lyrics - Strokirk, Music - Stabel, Strokirk]

Share The Black Of A Fallen Dream
Share The Calm Of A Quiet Stream

My Spirit Is Free
No More Fight For A Wish To Be
My Spirit Is Free
As I Rest Myself From Greed

For The Hope Of A Better Life
We Keep Pushing Our Limits To High
But It Seems So Wasted And Dumb
âCause We Know Forever Is A Lie

For The Fame And So Called Glory
We Struggle On But We Know Itâs Not Gonna Last
So I Raise The Glass To My Lips
âCause I Know Itâs  Time To Rest
No Further Competition
Just Me Wasting Myself

So Let It Be And Break The Surface
Donât Let Them Tell How Live And How To Be
Iâve Had Enough Set Me Free
Leave Me Be
All My Dreams To Fulfill Myself
I Now Do Ignore
