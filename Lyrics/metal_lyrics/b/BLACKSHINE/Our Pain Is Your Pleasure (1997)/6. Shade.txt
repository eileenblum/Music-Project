[Lyrics - Strokirk, Music - Strokirk, Stabel]

I Saw A Rainbow In The Dark
That Almost Made Me Blind
Lovely Colours From Above
All Messing With My Mind
A Taste So Sweet
I Felt So Good
All I Could Do Was Sigh
Frigid Fucking Bitch From Hell
Who Wanted Me to Die

Take A Piece Of Me
I Promise Not To Leave You Alone
Take A Piece Of Me
Tomorrow I Might Be Gone

I Felt So Sad
She Drove Me Mad
But I Wanted To Go Back
I Never Met A Girl Like Her
Now The Rainbow Was All Black
Bitterness Has Filled My Soul
All She Could Do Was Lie
Horny Fucking Bitch From Hell
Who Wanted Me To Die

Take A Piece Of Me
I Promise Not To Leave You Alone
Take A Piece Of Me
Tomorrow I Might Be Gone

These Things Can Really Hurt
When Youâre In The Middle Of It All
Soon Or Late You Realize
Itâs No Else's Goddamn Fault
For Being So Damn Naive
But Get Stronger When You See
That Love And Hate Go Hand in Hand
And With Time You Learn Your Lesson
That With Hate Follows Goodbye
And You Realize You Shouldnât
Trust Or Believe
Few Are Worth To Trust Or Believe
