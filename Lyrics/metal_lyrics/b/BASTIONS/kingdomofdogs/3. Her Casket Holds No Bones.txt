Are our lives, our biggest disguise - masked in deceit, just to repeat..
Well planes will fall out of the sky, these snakes will take back what is theirs
A knife in the chest is far too easy to repair

We are a generation that will feed itself
We are a generation that will need itself
We are a generation that will eat itself
We are a generation that fucked itself

I just performed surgery on myself, I shattered a thousand promises
I cut away my pleasantries, and slept off most the pain

I will talk a thousand words
I will barter a thousand hurts
I will suffice in this
I will fail in what I give

We are a generation that will feed itself
We are a generation that will eat itself
