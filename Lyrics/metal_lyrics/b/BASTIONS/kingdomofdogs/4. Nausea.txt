Im sleepless... too far gone tonight, it crawls up inside of me
Were just coping, not commanding - just like the way of my life
Hope stains these walls - pollinate spores - the skylines arenât for us

In mires, in dirge, Im sick, so sick

I will catch alight, over the flames, in the sky

Hear my words break
Show you this frame
Structure our sense
Fight off sickness
In scars I sit
The hope, war in our blood

Blood shot eyes
-with-
I'm failing to try

And as I sat staring at you, I could (see)feel the fear trembling in your legs

I opulate, you ovulate
