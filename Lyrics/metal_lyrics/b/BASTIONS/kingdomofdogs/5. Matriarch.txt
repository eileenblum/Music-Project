Jester in the court of fools you hunted me dry
Set me on your mantle and bled me dry
Flavour of the month, in the corpse of divinity
Champions of lust, you sidelined the sin in me

Of everything you were meant to be, meant nothing to me
Your lips parted so partially in disbelief

We have sown the seeds of sin, wash me in your guilt
Use this for personal gain, the king must die
My white goddess, Im covered in truth and bile
From the womb spew forth the dogs of war and kill the king
