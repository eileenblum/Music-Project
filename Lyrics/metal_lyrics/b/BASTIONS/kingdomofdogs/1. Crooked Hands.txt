Business is slow when you're on your knees
You embrace the fear of God
True foundations stand stronger weather
Will not disregard or let it rest

Even if my chest seized up, Iâd make it to the end
As my lungs, fill with tar, Il never make amends

Dear sender, I didn't know you, our time is precious, it's torn between us
Preserve the old, abort the new, no elegies, taken with you
When all is said, when all is done, I'l hold myself in humility -
When vultures come, to pick your bones, what is said for worth?

Legible to play the priest
With his wealth of lies
Slight of hand, so slight of hand..
Guilty to be judged

Business is slow when you're on your knees
You embrace the fear of God
True foundations stand stronger weather
Will not disregard or let it rest

Will not let it rest

I have lost the words to say ânothing leftâ
Stay true to what you are in the end 
Everything ends..
