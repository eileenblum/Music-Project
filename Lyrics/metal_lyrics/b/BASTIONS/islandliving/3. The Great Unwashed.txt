Crawling further in marrows of the sea
Bandaged this stump, I tore myself free
If I donât get out Il end up as you
The great unwashed I refuse to live a life through

Iâll writhe at your feet for attention

I can see myself in you and thatâs what scares me the most
Wherever I am dreams become wasted hopes
