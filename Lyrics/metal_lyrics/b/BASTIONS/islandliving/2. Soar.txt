I drink so deep, row after row
A spineless waste I reap what Iâve sown
With given time I deceive myself for free
By preaching words death walks with me

So I drink deeper until my bellies fed
This well runs dry, in ignorance Iâm bred

The sun dies a death, I shun this world, I bide my time
The sun dies a death, I shun this world, deluded minds

Soar on

The sun dies a death, I shun this world, I bide my time
The sun dies a death, I shun this world, deluded minds

I am nothing

My head is in the clouds, donât want to face the truth

Drink deep, bellies fed
Wells run dry, ignorance breeds
