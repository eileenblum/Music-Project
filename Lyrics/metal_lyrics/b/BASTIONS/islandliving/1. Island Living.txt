Trudging through the murk and mire
Canât find my way, canât reach the end
Island decay and how it gets inside
My hands still shake from restless nights

Giving time not worth, withdraw from this world 
I grit my teeth because of you

Consumed, hopeless, gutless, heartless pigs

Youâd think these roads were paved in gold
But I stand alone with my back turned 
Towards the sea, the salt corrodes my mind
Not gaining ground, thereâs nothing left

Giving time not worth, withdraw from this world 
I grit my teeth because of you

You drag me down (I canât see you alive)
