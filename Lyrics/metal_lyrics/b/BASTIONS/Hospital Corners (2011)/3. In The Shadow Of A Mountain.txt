We are beggars of the murdered, where nothing matters anymore
As I'm surrounded by friends with false faces 
All the reasons are here, but less is more, more or less
So I'm sustained in fluids and bloods and I'm cupped to this poisoned breast
In your shadow, you doctored every part of me
In your shadow, partially patient I dislocate my arm free 
The truth in your frightened eyes
Throws a shadow over all that aches inside
Sheltered and weak, temporary peace
We float in perfect failure
Staring into the abyss, such a shame to find me staring back  
As I'm cast away, on that river of sadness
With two hands and a bucket of pain
I eat your gospel, it tastes like rumors to me
In your shadow, you doctored every part of me
In your shadow, partially patient I dislocate my arm free 
In your shadow, my worth was no cost
In your shadow, I traded time with loss
"I am forever"
Forever is all I have
