I've seen white walls waste away 
And I am sickened and awake for hours, for days
Broken down, I am caustic inside, outside calcified
This never stops 
I re-read every word you said
Spat it out on script
And bandaged what was left
Oh Holy Island I carry the sick down to the shore
Oh Holy Island I carry the sick, the son you betrayed has finally passed away 
Sunken eyes and bruised wrists, the journals of one so cold
Those below, so unclean, I've come to collect you all
An eye for an eye in good time, honest men left us blind
For all I consumed, I'm buried here with you 
She lay there, naked and innocent wrapped in these bed sheets 
My father, forgive me, I never had a choice
The beast died a thousand times in me
I wait so patiently
