I have nourished my demons and this fire
I am lost love, like water filling lungs
Colours on her skin are bruising black and blue  
The shoreline grew foul and drowned in the dreams of the young 
She is so flawless, her mouth barely moves
There are no words for these truths
If only you knew, the lengths I go to make you mine, by drowning your horsesIn this dank town, and in my putrid house 
These bowels of failure, the worst part of being alone 
Wishing for my constant piece of home
Something wicked this way comes of swill and pills and gutter rot 
I'm choking on grief, you're begging for sleep 
When men are monsters, they pray for times like these
Tore your name from my veins
I give you one word, forgiveness
