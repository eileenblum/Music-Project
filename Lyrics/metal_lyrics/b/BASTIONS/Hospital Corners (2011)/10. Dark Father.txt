The years perform their terrible dance
I was glad enough to have you  
The loneliest walk the longest miles
You' ll never know the pain of wanting this 
I'm turning out like you wanted 
Burning in my wrists
I'm turning out like you wanted 
Stitched at the lips
I hold no hope for humanity, you will find none here 
So let the dreamer wake to see the psychosis
Pieces of you are growing in here
I suffocate in your love  
You crawl in closer with broken hips 
I'm lifted to the hollow behind your ribs 
I'm turning out like you wanted 
Burning in my wrists
I'm turning out like you wanted 
Stitched at the lips
Dark Father reigns 
I'll eat my eyes because my mind is crying
Keep bitter pills for glad tidings
I held you here for too long, who could ever take my place? 
Why should I care about a world that chooses to save face?
You're taking the best of me
I'll eat my eyes because my mind is crying 
Everything I've ever known is dying
