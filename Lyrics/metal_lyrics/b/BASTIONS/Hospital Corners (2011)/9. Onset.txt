The passing of the seasons give us casualties
Sitting in this ward on New Year's Eve
I hoped and prayed he would pull through
That winter was the coldest too 
Where the pavement ends, anguish governs the heart
White eyes in the house of the sick
I'm broken, remorseful and cruel
I can't get past these bleak white lights
I can't get past these countless nights  
Hold on 
I can't get past these bleak white lights
Hold on
I can't get past these countless nights
Merciful Lord tear down this house I dream for peaceful respite hours

Please keep him on this I.V drip 
His words in my head said stay with me, oh stay with me, pray sweet release 
I'm crushed under the weight of my regret
White eyes in the house of the sick
I'm broken, remorseful and cruel
