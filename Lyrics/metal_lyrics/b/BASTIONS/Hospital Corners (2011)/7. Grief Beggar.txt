My love you've spoilt my needs
I've been stepping on these egg shells, you've been stepping on my throat
I left myself open to these wolves, organs exposed 
My tendons kept us sewn as one
I hold her one last time before I leave this place
With the knowledge that she is unaware of what's happened
It's a pity to see you leave, but I'm keeping the best of me
The fearful always talk, always talk
You're a layer of sadness that won't go away
You're a half hidden home of death and I won't come up alive 
Your passage was a lung
Knowing it will never last
Crossing out your name 
Just moments of joy
God I hate the way I am around you
With bitter words I plead, hold me 
We had our time together
Missed you more than I could bear
With a glad heart I had to let you go 
Closing off the past, dreaming as I go
These things that unified us, caused us so much pain
