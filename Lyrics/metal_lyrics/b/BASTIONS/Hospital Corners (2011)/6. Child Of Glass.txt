It's quarter past life and I am soaked in vile ideas 
Grasping, squeezing, clutching, its grinding me down 
We bruise before we tear
Like ether in the air
With murderous intent the mourners flock together
A fog of sickness, jesus so wide-eyed and innocent
We bruise until we tear 
Like ether in the air
What have you done? 
What have you ruined? 
Turn the lights down
Consumed by veins, I caught the winds of failure
Consumed by veins, holding a child of glass 
My arms outstretched, why are you trying to hurt me? 
By your bedside I remained for days and days and days and...
I fold for you, you are forgiven
My heart was put on the line
We bruise until we tear
Like ether in the air
