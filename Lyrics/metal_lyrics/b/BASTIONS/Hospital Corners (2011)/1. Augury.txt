I am shelved and segregated, struggling to control what I've created
You think the war is out there? It starts in here between the panic and fear
In the midst of life I am dead, lay me down by the riverbed
I let the water heal my wounds, the mist falls and I am consumed
Anxiety has me this pale, hanging on by my fingernails
When sorrow knocked at my door, I was too afraid to answer anymore
In the midst of life I am dead, lay me down by the riverbed
I let the water heal my wounds, the mist falls and I am consumed
Anxiety has me this pale, hanging on by my fingernails
Bound and tied I could not stay, open corridors in empty space
Lead me to the river, I will follow
Lead me to the river, I will fall
