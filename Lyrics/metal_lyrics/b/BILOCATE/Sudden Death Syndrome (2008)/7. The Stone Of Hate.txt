In Silence

"The burning flames...behind this cold black stone
A scared child ... dropped his rage on them
A desperate Need...Hate is screaming inside
What else to come?... A divined Promise...
Words that have been written in blood

A Black misty vision...The description of life
Truth, it's clear as the sky filled with dying souls..."
