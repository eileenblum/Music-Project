A Dark Raining Dream, Alone a soul is crying to her beloved god
Before the sight of dawn, screaming the holy words will curse the darker ones
And take out the cancer inside her heart.

The pure heart screams to god,
Please god hear me now
Please god with your holy words
Please god you are my only salvation
To free what's left of my soul

Please god you know the truth
Please god end my misery
Am dying from what's inside me
Oh lord please forgive me
My long last escape from the world I live within.

A new born has touched the earth
He cried from what he had seen
A land filled with darkness, filthy blood spread on his hands
You took his soul from me, an angle he better be
To serve you lord forever and watch my land to burn...

Raised from dust i felt him, burned to ashes i saw him
As clear as your sun...dear lord i need my son
The light of day is near and my words will reach the sky...
The day ill rest in peace with my only wish to have
My life again together with my beloved ones

"Rest in peace my child...and close your tearful eyes...a new day has begun"
