Humans falling into the cursed land
The Blood running in me won't be disgraced
I can see the blackness taking Place
But the time of my skin is near the end

Now this is what I will need
In this salvation that I should bleed
We walk into the silent lake
To end the way in a dying sea
Start a life where the ship gives birth
And then drowning Deep in the Dead Sea
And this is what I will need
Only from your skin I shall feed

Salvation
No more pains from abhorrence
Damnation
For the rules of humanity
Creation
Souls were sold, to their life divine
Depression
The forbidden reasons that must be said

The place was damned upon Thee
A life time curse Blasphemy
Through ages the stories were declared
More tails I'll say on that sea

Dignity
Days Proved the No exist
Endlessly
Plague had come with no mercy
Denied

Am a Dying Sea
