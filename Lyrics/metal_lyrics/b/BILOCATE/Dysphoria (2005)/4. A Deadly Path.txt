I Am Standing Alone Screaming Today
To Hear the Wind, the Breath I'm Gonna Take
Screaming Silence with No Words to Say
Just a Meaning of This Empty Way The Words Came Out In Non Spoken Way
Embracing the Silence and Last Over Days
No One Is Hearing What I Have To Say
I'm With Myself and My Soul in My Way We Are Fighting Together
For Right and Wrong,
My Soul Is Dying
And Death Will Take Her

After She's Gone All What I Had Said
"Nothing Will Stop Us from Ending Our Way"
Now Me And Myself Are Trying To End This Misery We Live
Seeing The Dark Path Life Has Given
Myself Is Too Weak To Fight And Live The Light We Are Waiting For Has Gone
There's Only One Way
To Die While We Can Take This Exit
Myself Is Gone Now
What Could I Say
It's Just Me Now
With No One To Share

A Deadly Path I'm Taking
To The End

In This Moment I'll Say :
Nothing Will Stop Me From Ending This Way I'm Meeting My Lost Ones At The End...
My Soul And Myself
They Are Waiting For Me And That's Where I'll Be
At The End Of Today
At My Deadly Path
