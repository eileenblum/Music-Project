And there were angels
Who could not accept the lifting of man
Above them
And like Lucifer, rebuild against the armies
Of the loyal archangel
And there rose
A second war in heaven
And there shall be a dark soul
That will lead other souls
And become the inheritor
This soul will not rest in an angel, but a man
And there I'll make my second war in heaven.
Above
These words
I say
Over my (dead) body
Of Clay
Touching my dying hands I'm close to
My war (in heaven) to revile the truth of which we'll follow...
And like the first time with fear
Our souls drowned for many years
And Then
This War Shall End.
