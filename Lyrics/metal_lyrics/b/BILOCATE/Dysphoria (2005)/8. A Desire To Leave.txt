I Wander Through This Existence
Like A Thought Lost In A Dream
And In Every Moment I Can Feel This Pretence
Of A Joyous Life As It Seems I Wish I Could Escape This Insanity
And With An Everlasting Light Live Through Eternity But I Know The Sun Will Leave The Earth
Swallowed By Darkness And No Rebirth
Despite The Weakness I Survive
I Just Hope I Could Stop Being Alive He Knew This Day Will Pass
And The Night Will Fall Bringing
All The Darkness Into His Mind
And As The Suffering Begins
He Enters His Nightmares
And Wonders If He Could Ever Leave
Why Should I Endure This Cruelty
And This Cursed Darkness Of Monstrosity
In Your Hatred My Dreams Are All Buried
And The Taste Of Death Revives In Slavery
The Breath Inside My Chest Screams For Purity
And Now The Flesh Is Left In Obscurity
Alone Crying With A Shameful Poverty Release Your Helpless Soul Into My Demise
And Feel The Sweetness Of Your Painful Cries
In This Path I Deliver The Demons
To Guide You Towards The Restless Regret
Of Surrendering Your Life To The Darkened One
The Discouraged Have Lost
With Emptiness They'll Rust
With Ego I Shall Rule You
And Leave You To Sink In This Surrounding Hell
At The Moment He Thought He'd Lost It
It Decided Not To Lose Him
And As the New Dawn Approaches
He Could See The Bottom Of His Grave
All Lightened With Fires And Darkened By Shadows
But Then He Could Feel The Heat In His Veins
And hear The Wet Leaves Whispering
For The Merciful Gods To Light His Inner Darkness
