Days of Joyous Pain... Passing
Alone with the Mist Ahead in my sight
She's trying to understand... our life
She looks with her eyes. An Innocent Smile
Captures our souls... I can hear the wind in her breath
I can see the look in her eyes
She doesn't know,
She will never know
Still I am by your side That hollow love I'll give for u
I'll stay with u for awhile... then I'll go in my way
You'll reach under my skin and hide from your fears
Alone in the dark awaiting the sunrise to end our journey And many moons of sorrow are passing
Fixation upon this everlasting nation
Towards This dark side of living
Days of joy Ended This Time am searching For my Life
These Days Will Come... to remember
Upon the Forever Land
Days Of Joy Days of Joyous Pain... Passing
Alone with the Mist Ahead Of me
