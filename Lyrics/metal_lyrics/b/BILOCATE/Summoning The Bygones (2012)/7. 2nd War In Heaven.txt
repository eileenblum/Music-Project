And there were angels
Who could not accept the lifting of man above them
And like Lucifer, rebelled against the armies
Of the loyal archangel...

And there rose a second war in heaven
My war in my heaven

And there shall be a dark soul...
That will lead other souls...
And become the inheritor
This soul will not rest in an angel, but a man....

And there I'll make my second war in heaven

Above these words... I say
Over my body of clay
Touching my dying hands I'm close to my war to reveal the
Truth of which
We'll follow...

And like the first time with fear...
Our souls drowned for many years...
And then, this war shall end
In heaven
