[originally by Paradise Lost]Struggle with emotion
Feel the pain burn deep
Within our nerves
The mourning of lost life
Commands our actions night and day

The foul realism is unleashed
Upon the earth we'll bleed

Banish all fond memories
As the lord beckons us to judgement
Degeneration is close at hand
The mortality coil is weaker
The pain is close to heart
Now leave the ruined world to your god

The kindness of deaths grasp
Relieves us from the pain
