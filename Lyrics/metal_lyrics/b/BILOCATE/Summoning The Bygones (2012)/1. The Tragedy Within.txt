1. THE TRAGEDY WITHIN

All the mornings that passed
Gathering a grief to last
A new pain is born
A misery with no demise
Just a tragedy within

Many years of my life
Moaning to their divine
And the mourners i've seen
Are struggling in between
Their forgotten days... and the days to come

No words that I have
About the unknown of life
Nothing can take me (out) of
My blasphemous life

Another day had come

God is waiting... We are bearing
A day will come when no one is wrong
And a life had passed
With no one to regret the cries we lived
And the times we've lost

And I know a life will be reborn
A young sky will witness
All what I've said and more
Will be repeated on thy soul
Until the end of time... Farewell
