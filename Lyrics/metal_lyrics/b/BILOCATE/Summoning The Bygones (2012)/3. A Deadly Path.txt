I'm standing alone screaming today
To hear the wind, the breath I'm gonna take
Screaming silence with no words to say
Just a meaning of this empty way

The words came out in a non-spoken way
Embracing the silence and last over days
No one is hearing what I have to say
I'm with my soul and myself in my way

We are fighting together
For right and wrong
My soul is dying
And death will take her

After she's gone all what I have said
"Nothing will stop us from ending our way"

Now me and myself are trying to end this misery we live
Seeing the dark path life is giving
Myself is too weak to fight and live

The light we are waiting for has gone
There's only one way...
To die while we can take this exit
Myself had gone now
What could I say?
It's just me now...
With no one to share

A deadly path I'm taking to the end

In this moment I'll say:
Nothing will stop me from ending this way

I'm meeting my lost ones at the end
My soul and myself
They are waiting for me and that's where I'll be
At the end of today
On my deadly path
