It began, as these things do,
From clouds in the aether
With untold time, they coalesced,
Their will apart grew weaker

This cascade of embers,
Fused into a star's ignition
A crucible for their collapse,
Seething crux of its ambition

The axiom of this expanse,
Unrelenting pressure
Every moment, in each place,
Collisions beyond measure

An ordinary pair that met,
Whilst merging into one,
Heaved and spat a mote of light,
Adrift within the Sun

Without a bind, it cut away,
Against all else it stood
As swift as anything that was,
And had, or could, that would

The axiom when it began,
Unable to elude
Every moment, in each place,
Destroyed, exchanged, renewed

At the surface once emerged,
Radiant in birth
Free at last, its final form,
The photon dashed for Earth
