A time when the light falls clearly
A place where the struggle began
She awoke to take back her realm
And expunge the virus infecting man

A natural apostasy
Burn away the creed of frail minds

The liars sins we now embrace
Synthetic moralities will lapse
No longer to revere the feeble
Their walls of protection have collapsed

A natural apostasy
tearing down the dogma of weakness
An unnatural mentality
Will be struck from this earth

The seeds of a natural chaos will devour
The artificial values which enslave us
The wrath of the restitution will devour
the blinkered cowards who constrain us

A silence so clear
The asinine are left behind 'ere the dusk fall so near
A scene of tranquil delight
She is restored, a nuance torn
And the truth shall burn into the night
