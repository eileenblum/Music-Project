At beginning of light
Where the energy gathered
Grew a sentience that was the prime
Laced with flickers of madness

As these forces drove out into dark
And the fires began to form
Each holding a mind of its own
From whence the star gods were born

The sleeping giants have awoken
Our feeble devices have broken their slumber

I begin to see
My mind grows clear
Long I lay dormant
Yet my thoughts are keen
I bathe in power
We are the Tre'aste
And I will feast upon these wretches in their ignorance

Out of the sky fire, into the darkness
We are the star gods, I will consume thee

Our imprudence
Is now all too clear
What we have stirred
Is vengeance incarnate
The fuel of the stars
Is no satiety
They will pursue us to the ends of the universe

We are but mortals, our fate is sealed

As we now accede eternity
Having stripped this plane of mortal flesh
We return once more to our dormancy
And await the renewal of life force

The Tre'aste sleep once more in the fire
Until the cycle can begin again
