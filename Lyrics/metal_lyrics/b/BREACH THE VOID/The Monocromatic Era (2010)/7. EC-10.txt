Chained in my cynical redemption
Toxins in my brain, drive me insane
Adrenaline pumped, lose of control
Absolute domination of nothingness

Re-doing a world, just for one fuckinâ moment
My sensitivity goes numb
A sacred feeling of euphoria runs in me
Damnation of all our weaknesses

I cannot see my own fuckinâ immorality
Frustration of something I cannot change
I canât even see myself arriving nowhere
Frustration of something Iâll always be

All of your tears are in my mind
Emotion sustained breaking me inside
Past is haunting me in redemption

I pull the strings of my own god damn misery
Thereâs no ending in this for me and you
No second chance to fuckinâ prove
Thereâs no right from wrong
In this void of pain and torment,
Why live if I donât believe?

Remaking new paths, a life of negligence
An anger disorder
All turns to grey and dust
Your fading emotions, dried out
In a false serenity as we unlock this door
