Rise out of ignorance
You seem to lose yourself
The blindfold will collapse
Everything will turn to ruins
The masquerade is over
Fragrance of death initialized

Cause Iâm running out of my self
Cause you make my sink
Cause I close the door
Repentless and used up

You cannot see your arrogance,
Your ruthless ego
How can life be so empty, in chaos
Indifference is just a state of mind
To your secluded souls, being free

Thereâs no hope only shame and fear
Those empty words were always feign
No more tomorrow left in ruins

Words without no fuckinâ meaning
I try and face an unsolved truth, useless
Thereâs no better blind man than the one
Who denies his own fuckinâ purity
Your lies revealed

I feel your contagious denial of inequity
Disturbed, I am of those living through my sins

You cannot see your arrogance in chaos
How can life be so empty, so vile
You will not change me

Never will I take your fucking bullshit now
Everything seems to be revelations
I canât stop myself from enduring all this shit
Destroying all the confused ones in eternity

I am the pain struggling through your head
Drained onto you
Destructing your souls, living through my sins
