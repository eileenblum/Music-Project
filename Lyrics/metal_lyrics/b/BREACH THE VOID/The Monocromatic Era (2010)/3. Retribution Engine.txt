After those years of betrayal,
I emerged from the sleep
Breaking all sentiment of sympathy,
Youâll pay the fucking price
Your only option is to run and hide
Iâm now coming for you,
So pull the fuckinâ trigger on yourself

Youâll only get what you deserve,
Youâll feel my deepest hate
Youâll feel my pain deep down inside,
Deep down inside your core

Iâll bury you down, bury you down, still alive
Iâll never let you, never let you,
Bring me down again

Fuck those lies Iâve submitted to,
Those false promises youâve shown
To be the core of your rusted soul,
I know my eyes say more than just words,
Machine guns steady to blast in your
God damn face

And now you see, what Iâve been through,
All those god damn fuckinâ years
Desperation and aggression,
Is what you made of me

No more masks, no more shells,
To hide yourself with, youâre now naked
I now see, your truest face
