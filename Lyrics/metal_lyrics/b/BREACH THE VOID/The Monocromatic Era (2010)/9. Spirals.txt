Blocks of time filed up an endless course in vain
Self confused, lost striving
Through dead ends, I plead

Breakdown this fucking static flow
We suffocate, we drown under the weight
Of those minds
No more control, pressure, suffering
Endless routines to delusions

Who carries you from now
These chains wonât be broken
Through empty days Iâm seeking an answer
To all my prayers
In spite of grief, in spite of all mis-belief

Self programmed beings prostrated irrational pain
A cause in vain

My thoughts supplanted
You feel the razors in me
Iâm failing to reach the final step
Of a life of negations
Void and emptiness, I cannot maintain
