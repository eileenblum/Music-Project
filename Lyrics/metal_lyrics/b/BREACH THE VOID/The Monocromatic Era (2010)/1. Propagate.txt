Propagate, an empty lie
A cause, a threat, shattered prophecies
Masses hypnotized, hope and despair
In a pitch black design sinking us below

Trapped within my rage,
I realized this nightmare will be the same
Forever, caged in fear,
Your endless reason of lies

I seek mutilation,
For something Iâll always live in
You will not eradicate my thoughts
To emptiness in a false embrace

Circled by fucking hypocrites,
Walk this path amongst dead souls, brain washed
Paralyze my inner perception of an integrity soon to fall

Dredged into hostile greed,
Youâll never see the right from wrong in this society
Sense of hope, frustration,
To reign over a void of inner pain, locked inside me

Looking back at me,
Breaking the system we feared
No more remorse in dying freely
