Aggression is taking over our captivated bodies
Iâll fuck your system,
Neglected your thoughts to dominate my own
Panicked of all this shit, paralyzed by anger
Into the depths Iâm trying to sell my life away to vanity

We are descending, disturbing
A life of innocence,
Reaching for a way to bind ourselves into one
We all look the same, we pretend, we fake
The lies of sorrow strained
Mesmerized the grief to fade away
Into a locked up era

Reality seems binding
The truth of all this seems deafening
Fading away, a prophecy that will not stay

Caged inside
The way you see I used to be
No way this life of vile will damn me here
Iâll find the truth in loneliness,
Iâll breach the void of silence
Uncovered vastness to free us all

Time passes by, nothing is changing,
A frustrating mind kind
My life is torn apart in a digital structure
