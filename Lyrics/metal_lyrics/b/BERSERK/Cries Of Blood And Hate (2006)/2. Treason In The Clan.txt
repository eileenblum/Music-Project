EACH BRANCH IS PART OF THE TRUNK OF A TREE.
NO DROP BY ITSELF CAN FORM THE RAIN.
I HAVE SEEN FIELDS GROW AND VILLAGES BURN.
I HAVE SEEN CHILDRENÂ´S BIRTHS
...AND MOTHERS CRY.
SEASONS HAVE PASSED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
AND I GREW OLDER WITH THEM.
BUT THE BROKEN EQUILIBRIUM
IS THE MAJOR DANGER FOR THE CLAN.
A NEW RITE OF VISION, MEDITATION.
PERHAPS THE SPILLED BLOOD NEXT TO THE RIVER HELPS ME.
MEDITATE, MEDITATE, CLOSE THE CIRCLE AND NARROW IT.
MEDITATE, MEDITATE, FOLLOW THE WAY OF THE RUNES.
TO SEE THE RAVENS FLY IN THE DISTANCE,
KNOWING THEY WILL NEVER RETURN.
TO BREAK THE WORD OF HONOUR AND THE OATH.
THE TREASON IS THE GREATEST OFFENSE
AND MOST PUNISHED IN MY CODE.
THE DANCE OF THE RUNES OVER A HUMAN
BY A TREASON IN THE CLAN.
A FIRE CROSSES MY INTERIOR,
THE SAME THAT ELDERS TOLD.
MY FACE CHANGES ITS EXPRESSION,
THE WIND SPREADS THE SCENT.
BROKEN SWORDS AT A BONFIRE'S LIGHT.
THE SCENT IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
LIKE THE WET WOOD WAS.
SING TO THE EARTH, TRAITOR!
PLEA TO IT BEFORE THIS STONE
WHAT TOOK YOU TO COMMIT THIS?
WAS IT GREED AND EGOISM?
TO SEE THE RAVENS FLY IN THE DISTANCE,
KNOWING THEY WILL NEVER RETURN.
BROKEN SWORDS AT A BONFIRE'S LIGHT.
THE SCENT IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
LIKE THE WET WOOD WAS.
