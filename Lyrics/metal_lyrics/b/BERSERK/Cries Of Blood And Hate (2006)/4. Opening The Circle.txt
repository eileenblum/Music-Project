BROKEN, THE FLAME IN THE SKY 
SEA AND RIVER ARE BLOOD.
NOW THE CLAN IS UNITED 
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER, AND OTHER.
THE GUIDE RAISES HIS HAND AND HIS CANE,
HIS FACE REFLECTS THE WISDOM OF YEARS.
THE WIND BLOWS AND HE COMMANDS TO BEGIN THE SACRIFICE,
AND THE STONES GET ILLUMINATED IN THAT MOMENT.
ALL MEN UNITE THEIR HANDS, ELDERS AND YOUTH.
IT IS THE SAME BLOOD WHICH RUNS IN THEIR VEINS.
"I DO IT FOR THE EARTH, FOR THE SUN AND THE MOON,
FOR THE FIRE, AND THE RAIN THAT HAS TO COME".
EACH FATHER AND SON, FEEL THE EVENT.
RESPECT AND PRIDE, WHILE HE SINGS.
OAKEN SHIELDS DEFEND, EVEN THE MOUNTAINS.
IN EACH SEASON, THEIR ROOTS GET STRONGER.
MANY GUIDES WILL SEE BIRTH AND DEATH,
ONLY THE FIRE OF THE GODS WILL ENDURE IN TIME.
