I CAME FROM FAR AWAY TO TALK TO YOU, MONOLITH,
TO PRAY AND TELL YOU A STORY OF YEARS AGO.
I HAVE CROSSED RIVERS, RAIN AND COLD.
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, ALL WAS DIFFERENT IN MY VILLAGE,
A LITTLE COMMUNITY WITH ITS AUTONOMY.
ONE DAY, A MAN CAME FROM OTHER VILLAGE.
TOLD US ABOUT INVASION OF OTHER PEOPLE
WITH BREASTPLATES AND SHORT HAIR.
UNDER THEIR BANNERS, AN EAGLE, ROME.
ALL PEOPLE WAS PREPARING, MAKING WEAPONS AND SWORDS,
THIS WAS THE PATH OF REAL ESSENCE. 
RAISING PALISADES AND DEFENCES.
EVEN US, THE CHILDREN, WERE READY.
SOME MOONS LATER,
WE DISCRIED A LARGE ARMY,
WELL STRUCTURED, 
WHICH ADVANCED SLOWLY.
ALARM WAS GIVEN, 
AND ALL GOT PREPARED.
THE ARMY STOPPED AND FORMED
A STRANGE GROUP.
MEN ENTERED AT WAR, 
PROTECTED BY SOME SPEARS.
THE REST RESISTED INSIDE THE VILLAGE.
ALL WHO I EVER MET FOUGHT FOR THEIR LIVES
WHOLE FAMILIES SCREAMED IN SWEAT AND BLOOD.
IT WAS THE END, 
WE WERE THE SLAVES OF AN EMPIRE.
THE LEADER WAS KILLED
AND THE WISE ELDERS TOO.
THOSE WHO WERE CHILDREN, WE KEPT GROWING,
ITÂ´S SAD TO SEE THE MISERY WHERE IT DIDNÂ´T EXIST BEFORE.
OLD PEOPLE DIED BY SORROW,
THEIR GRIEF TEARS FALL FROM SKY.
BE A MERCENARY AT THE ORDER OF INVADER
OR TO DIE LIKE A STRANGER IN YOUR OWN LAND.
ONE DAY, I ESCAPED RUNNING.
I RUN AND RUN, ALL AS I WAS ABLE.
AND I BECAME AN EXILED
TO TELL YOU A STORY, MONOLITH.
