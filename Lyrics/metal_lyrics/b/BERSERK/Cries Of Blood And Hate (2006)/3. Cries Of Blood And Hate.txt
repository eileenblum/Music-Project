THE LAND THAT SAW OUR BIRTH
CRIES WITH BLOOD AND HATE
WHILE ITS SONS SWEAR REVENGE.
BROTHERS, WHO BETRAYED THEIR PROMISE.
(NOW LOOK WITH FEAR, THE SWORD THAT WAS OF THEIRS).
TAKE THE GROUND THAT SPAWNED YOU
SALUTES TO THE NORTH, THE SOUTH ,
TO THE EAST AND THE WEST, TO THE SUN
AND THE STARS, AND OPEN THE CIRCLE
WHILE YOU LIVE.
MY SIGN REMAINS UNTIL THE END OF TIMES,
LINEAGE OF THE FORGOTTEN
IN BALANCE WITH THE INFINITE COSMOS,
TAKING THE WORD OF THE GODS.
THE PAST REGAINS LIFE
IN EACH ORATION AND RITE
AND IN EACH DROP OF BLOOD.
A SKY FULL OF STARS
THAT DOESNÂ´T FORGET.
A RIVER OF ETERNAL SAP
THAT HATES THE HUMAN RACE.
CENTURIES AFTER CENTURIES THE BELIEF HAS VANISHED.
THE FIRE THAT LEAD MANY OTHERS HAS WEAKENED.
I ONLY SEE DESTRUCTION AND DESOLATION IN THE PATH OF MAN.
TAKE THE GROUND THAT SAW OUR BIRTH,
CRY WITH HATE AND RAGE
WHILE WE SWEAR REVENGE
AGAINST BROTHERS WHO BROKE THEIR PROMISE
(AND WHO LOOK AT OUR SWORD WITH FEAR)
A DOWN MIST
BUT NOT AS IN TIMES OF PLENTY.
