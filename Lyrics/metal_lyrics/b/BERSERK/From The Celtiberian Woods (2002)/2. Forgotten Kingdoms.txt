Under the ashes of a kingdom
The Antichristian flame borns

We are the knights of darkness
The hate that we keep in our hearts...
Will be the sign of our retaliation

My soul remembers
The pain of those warriors
That died fighting for their gods
Against the false christian faith

The moon is dark
And the forest, our hut,
Where the elements and darkness join up
(Remains those Forgotten Kingdoms)

The large branches of the Great Holy Tree
Sieve over us

Now we are united,
We will hear the antichristian call,
Resounding as the song of the night spirits,
Now we keep together: Arm with arm, fire with fire
