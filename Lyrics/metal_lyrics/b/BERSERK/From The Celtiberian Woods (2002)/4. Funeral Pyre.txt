The forest reveals before my eyes.
The pain invades my body.
I feel the fire signs.
Mother Earth! My blood was offered to you.
And now I come to the forest
To offer the life who gave it me.
We were the elected
To guide our kingdom
Carrying to the new lands
The Pagan Fire
Shadows in the forest... are the ravens
Fire in the sky... is the sign
I feel the silent death
But it doesn't humiliate me
And full of pride...
I fall exhausted.
The pagan fire carries my soul and my possessions.
My sword and shield carry me to the eternity.
My body is offered in this funeral pyre.
The gods are with me in this funeral pyre.
