This is the land.
The land of our ancestors.
The fire of our hearts...
The great Celtiberia
Another were the glorious times of the pagan splendour.
Two great villages: The mighty Celtics and the sage Iberians
Swords and shields united with the same finality...
To defend the territory of the invader.
At the heart of the forest
The pagan men congregate.
The union of clans will be the sign of fraternity
Reverence and union of the clans
A great kingdom is born of Celtics and Iberians
The great Celtiberia is borned of two great villages
We'll guard from our fortified castors
In the high up of the watch tower.
The concord will prevail,
The accord will determine at the Holy Teseras.
We'll guide us under the sky and stars
Preserving the cult to the millenary idols.
Woods and mountains will be our hut,
none culture will be stronger than ours.
We are La Tene?s sons
When the new race forged.
We are in carry of the banner of hate
Which will endure for ever and ever
Our race doesn't set back.
Death better to fall in the invader's presence.
This is the land.
The land of our ancestors.
The fire of our hearts...
The great Celtiberia
