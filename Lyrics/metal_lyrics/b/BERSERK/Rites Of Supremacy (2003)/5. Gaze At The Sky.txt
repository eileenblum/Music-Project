You who saw how our ancestors fought for their lands,
Faithful witness of battles full of honour.
You who saw how our parents died for their believes,
And how oppression took form.

You will now see the new pagan dawn,
The new dawn of our land.

Fountain of life, you who embrace Iberia.
You who fertilize our mother earth with your hair.
You saw the cruel history of our race,
The vain attempt of destroying our blood.

The wolf cries your absence,
As your hundred brothers watch us from above.

Brave warrior, gaze at the sky,
And offer your weapons to his blinding brilliance.
Brave warrior, gaze at the sky,
And dazzle with his majesty.

Your trip marks days and nights.
Forever eternal ray of light.
Never stopped, always moving
