Today my hour has arrived.
Many of us were who fall in this lengthy war.
I honoured to my deceased,
I gave thanks to the elements
And fought by my gods.

I saw to fall friends
And I splitted the abdomen of my enemies.
I showed respect for the stages and rites
Which were showed me,
And a great tree was borning
At the long of time.
I opened the circle time and time again
And it will follow opened in the eternity this way
