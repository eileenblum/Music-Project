Born in the mountain, among oaks and birches.
Bred by the violence, grown by the sword.
Fury possesses my body, awaiting the great day.

Lord and owner of the astuteness, I wear wolf's skin,
Because through my veins runs berserker's blood.

With my brothers I advance through the enemies lines,
Colouring in red the invader's chest.
Marked by the sword's law,
Under the protector glance of the gods.

Born in plenitude with nature, between rivers and hills.
Signed by destiny, bred amongst weapons.
Revenge fills my being, awaiting the great day.

Lord and owner of strength, I wear bear's skin,
Because through my veins runs berserker's blood.
Lord and owner of destiny, I wear deer's horns,
Because through my veins runs berserker's blood.

Born in harmony with nature, among bears and wolves.
Marked by their claws, grown by the animal instinct.
Vengeance fills my being, awaiting the great day.

With my brothers I give our justice,
Colouring in red the enemy's land.
Spotting with blood the sword's edge,
Under the protective glance of the gods
