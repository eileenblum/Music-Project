Alone on a bench of the playground
Iâm watching their little games
No one to look at my misery
But the ones who like to jeer

Did you know I was weak
When you stabbed me in the back?
Did you know that I was in pain?
Did you know I could fall
From the edge of these depths
That I was disturbed?
No no no no!

You canât ignore the threat
Whispering in your head
It will burn your kindness
To drown you into madness
Will you blame it on me?
The things that should not be
Theyâre not here cosâ of me
Youâre the one who screwed up

Your teases like a little pretty spark
That bursts into fireâ¦
Did you know that your words
Woke something up in me?
Did you know I could be insane?
Did you know that I would
Lose my mind and revenge
Standing on the edge of insanity!

Feel the anger growing inside
It destroys my sanity
See all the strength itâs giving me
To forget all the rules

Tonight I feel like Iâm on edge
On the edge of dementia!

So ladies &amp; gentlemen
Welcome to the theater of fools.
Time to hear the lament of a psycho
Hear the story of a fragile heart
Who was just like you but
Too sensitive, too frail
For this world of yours.
It could have been your face
In the paper this morningâ¦

Here I am
Standing in front of you
Begging for mercy!
Look what youâve done to me
And remember
Weâre all on the edge of insanity!
