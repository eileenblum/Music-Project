Sometimes, itâs just a single word that is uncalled-for
Sometimes, itâs just a little sign that you dare ignore.

I can barely talk to you,
I can barely hold your gaze,
I can barely understand your thoughts!
I hate these moments when youâre a stranger to me,
When youâre so far, so far away from what Iâm feeling now!

I canât play the part that you cast me for, Iâm sorry
I canât face this version of me you reflect like a broken mirror

Always, a little risky when you bring me there
It always starts from nothing and it leads nowhere.

You keep pushing me away,
Am I supposed to suffer it?
Am I supposed to feel guilty about it?

What was unfair,
In my despair?
Why arenât you listening to me?
What wasnât told
Behind our lies?
Why do we have to fight?
