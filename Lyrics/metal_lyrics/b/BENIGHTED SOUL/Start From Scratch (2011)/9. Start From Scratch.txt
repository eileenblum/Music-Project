It's not what you are
It's not who you are
Itâs all about the one they want you to be
Itâs all about the one youâre supposed to be

I'm sick of all your judgments
How I wish I could start from scratch
You can't run back the tape
You cannot start from scratch

I just wanna take a little time out
I just wanna kill this fake myself
I just have to die to be another me

All you can do
Never enough
Hard to get through
Better be tough

I'm sick of all your judgments
How I wish I could start from scratch
You can't run back the tape
You cannot start from scratch
I'm sick of all your comments
How I wish I could start from scratch
You cannot start your life from scratch

Let me be
And break the chains that strangle me.
Let me breathe, let me struggle!
I have enough of acting all the roles of this play
When will the curtain finally fall?

I can't remember when all went wrong
But on this very day:
I colored the angels gray,
On the book that taught how to pray
I colored the angels gray
On the paintings that showed the way
They told me to build this wall,
A fortress against the world
But I couldn't lift the stones,
Much too heavy for a little girl

So I colored the angels gray,
On the book that taught how to pray
I colored the angels gray
On the paintings that showed the way
Now they besiege the soul
That was left defenseless
Years ago by a child
Who could not know the consequences.
