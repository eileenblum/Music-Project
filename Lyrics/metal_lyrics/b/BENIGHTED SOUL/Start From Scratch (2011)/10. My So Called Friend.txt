This little something in your eyes
Still makes me feel alive
Canât believe youâre still inside (my head, my heart)
This furtive word you let escape
Shows that you still care
It isnât so easy to fakeâ¦

You called me âfriendâ
Is it the way you see me?
Or is it just a comfortable lie?
Cosâ Iâm not buying  it

Iâm afraid weâve lost
All the things we got
Itâs not love, itâs not hate, itâs not us anymore
Iâm afraid youâve lost
And became a ghost
Itâs not us, itâs not our time anymore

Itâs time now to turn the page
Time to erase all the rage
May you rest among my forgotten regrets
And become the best of them all

You didnât say a word
Thereâs nothing left to share
Friends are not supposed to be
Strangers to each others.

Much more and much less than a friend to me
But I canât tell what is worseâ¦
We canât be friends without reservation, without a slice of desire.
