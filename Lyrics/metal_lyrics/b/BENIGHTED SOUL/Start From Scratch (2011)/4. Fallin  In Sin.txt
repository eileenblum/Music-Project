An angel fell,
And lost her innocence
Dirtied by the hands of Beast,
Canât find why,
This sin is out of sense,
How have I turned to the darkest side?

Forgive me Lord,
Forgive me my loveâ¦.

I confess my Lord,
A sin of flesh and blood,
Prisoner in the kingdom of Evil
Couldnât find the way to escapeâ¦.
Shame on your face petrifies your skin,
You are the one who fell in sin
Itâs time for you to serve your sentence in hell!
Youâve been given to temptation,
Now celebrate your damnation,
Here comes the time to serve your sentence in hell!

Steal my life, release me from my pain,
How could I forgive myself?
Better die than meet your eyes again,
Crucified by the memories of my faultâ¦
