The girl theyâre talking about
She canât be me, sheâs someone else
And the distance between me and her
It hurts me so bad
Straight through my heart, straight to the core
As if I were never prepared for it

Deep inside you know it is true
Some have to live, some have to die.
Deep inside a voice reminds you
That youâre not part of the chosen ones.
Will you give up for a few ones?
They donât know what theyâre talking about
Will you stand up when it gets rough
And take the chance to be someone else?

Look at this child in the picture
Iâve never fit within the frame
Cosâ this place has become too vast too soon
For the soul that still belongs to the little girl
And that is not strong enough to fill this body.

How can I be the one Iâve seen in your eyes
I hate the way she is, sheâs a stranger to me
I cannot recognize this face full of lies
How can I bring myself to tame this stranger me?
