To what ends we justify. One word tells all that can be said. Feed the fire of aggression. charred skeleton of a past remain. Silent. relinquish the thoughts to dust. Red as the blood that flows from our wrists. Insatiable. red as the blood that flows from our throats. Our legacy remains. arid dependence. Dehumanization. the machine runs on. Silent scarification. look twice at what remains. Fractured earth bleeds black.
