Burn with the rest. all innocence lost. regret my love. I starve for your dagger. put to rest this warm sadness frame by frame into the fire. I starve for your flame. I have seen better days. So take this last one with you. And fly the colors of your heart at half mast. Standing at the brink is never as clear. Don't say one more word. Like a disease you infect. So let the angels weep in all there bloodied glory. Burn with the rest never turning away.
