Take me bound and gagged. These moments never seemed so clear. Vivid memories. I awake. Whispers shatter the silence. buried in this womb. we stay lost. Buried in this womb. Shelter from the rain. still we are left searching for someone to mend these wounds. we stay under shelter from the rain. searching for something that was never there. I open my self. I awake. your whispers have shattered me. left to die. You bring me to this as I break. words speak through scars. As this hailstorm presides. I feel everything.
