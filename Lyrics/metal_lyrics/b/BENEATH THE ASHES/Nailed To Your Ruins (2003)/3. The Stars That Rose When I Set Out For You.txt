grey skies turn red. choking on the bitterness it brings. the autumn winds blow right through me. so when you shoot, aim straight for the heart of October. I hold my chest as tomorrow bleeds away. such beautiful words you fed me. I see now that I was choking on each line. so turn your back on me. forget. seasons change just as the swollen tears burst and run down your cheeks. you have so carefully burnt these bridges. where do you run to now. I hold my chest. I hold my chest as tomorrow bleeds away.
