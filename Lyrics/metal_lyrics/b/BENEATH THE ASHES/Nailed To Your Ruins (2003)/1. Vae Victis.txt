Drown. Swallowed by these tides that cry. Not one moment too soon. Regret. Close your eyes, let them pull you away. In this bleeding dawn. wake for the first time. in your eyes a light shines so bright it blinds me. under a sky of rust. raining down on me. walls of red close in. so cold. always one step behind. Broken like so many times before. Vanquished. shards of your shattered self slice even deeper. Wash it down. a bitter world. wash it away. Regret. Yet it won't let you forget. so take one last breath and swallow your grave.
