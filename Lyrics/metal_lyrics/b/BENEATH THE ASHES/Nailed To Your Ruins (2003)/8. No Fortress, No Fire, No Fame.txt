The sadness locked inside of you. The beauty of nothing. The absence of sacrifice, of pain. Fortress of solitude. burn it down. buried by arrogance. stones crumble. walls fallen from clenched fists that feel no pain. the fists that built them. Shadows of a scarred and skeleton world remain. You are still alone. nothing can protect you now. fortress of solitude. burn it down. no fortress. no fire. no flame. Birth takes a new meaning when it's into death. reinforced misconceptions. the plague of apathy that threatens to consume us all. fortress of solitude around this cold heart. burnt to the ground. afraid to face another day. still afraid to die. the fear remains.
