I will never take the life of innocence. This world's malevolence will be its demise. Compassion is not something that I am willing to compromise. For once mankind must open its eyes to the world around. Realize a change must take place. How long must we live on the death of the world. A sterile world. No respect for life. Antiquated notions of survival. the world's demise. How can we be so selfish. so short sighted. to those who look away. and to those who make excuses know that the blood is on your hands. and know that you hold the blade that kills the soul of life. To those who make excuses, the blood is on your hands.
