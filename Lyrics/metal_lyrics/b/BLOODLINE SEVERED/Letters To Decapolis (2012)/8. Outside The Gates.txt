standing alone
outside the gate
this gate i must go through
beyond this gate is something beautiful
alone i stand
crying out to you
i have made so many mistakes
time and time again
i'm begging for you
giving up all
that's true

i will stand here waiting for you
i have nothing left to lose
your breath passes my existence
softly you say
son walk through

holding steadfast to you
when all i have is nothing
in my most desperate place
is where i find you
you are by my side
saying get up and walk

this is where my life begins
when my flesh ends
every man has a gate to cross
a burden and a trial to bear
holy spirit
give me the strange
to put my past behind me

i will stand here waiting for you
i have nothing left to lose

this is my test to endure
the he's already walked
the other side is freedom
from all that i've lost

holding steadfast to you
when all i have is nothing
in my most desperate place
is where i find you
you were by my side
you are by my side
saying get up and walk
saying get up and walk
