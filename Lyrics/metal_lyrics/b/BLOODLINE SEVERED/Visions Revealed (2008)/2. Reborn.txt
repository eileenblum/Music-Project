Clawing at the walls
Alone with my sinful nature
Left to die
No hope for me, my soul lies bleeding

Clawing at the walls
Reaching out, it's like nobody's there
Left to die
Choked on the lies, I spit in the air
Clawing at the walls
The pain I have given is now plain to see
Left to die
The life I have chosen has walked out on me

I've heard it all before
It never meant that much to me
How a Man I didn't know
Could suffer and die in humility
For a soul as lost as mine
And actions undeserving of a Savior's love
I felt just like the prodigal son
Crying out, I reached for God above

I believed
You came and took my hand
You set me free
In victory I stand
I'm relieved
No longer insecure
I received
A perfect love from a heart so pure
