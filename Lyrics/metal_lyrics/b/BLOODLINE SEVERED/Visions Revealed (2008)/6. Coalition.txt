Fight, fight, this was has just begun
Persecution, retribution, lashing of the tongue
We will not back down and we will not go astray
Vengeance is ours on the holiest of days

Standing in Your light
For the whole world to see
We will stand our grand
In the enemy's face
Keep your confidence

There is a call, a call to perseverance
No need to hide
No need to fear
He's by our side, so wipe your tears

He Who is coming back will not be delayed
By His righteousness, we walk by faith
We will stand arm in arm till the very end
The serpent's tongue lashing out, against it we defend
Stand, fight till your last breath
