I am not alone
Darkness found me here
Tragedies enter my mind
Consuming me with fear
A shadow's silhouette
On a wall of doubt
I want to believe You
Left wondering if You're real
Reach Your hand for me
Take me back to normalcy
Or I'll drown in a sea of my own fallacies

(I am drowning here)
I am drowning here
Slipping deep beneath
(I have shed my tears)
I have shed my tears
My life filled with fear

Locked in this prison of my mind
I wanted to be free
Acts of mercy still reside
Faith will set me free

In freedom I stand
Where's the path that I must follow
I want to be led by You
Have no clue where to begin
Please show me the right way
The way to Your heart
You've broken me away
From this death I shall depart
I give myself to You
You're the only thing that's true
I give myself to You

I am drowning here
Sleeping deep beneath
I have shed my tears
My life filled with fear
Locked in this prison
In my own mind
I wanted to be free
Acts of mercy
They still reside for me
Faith will set me free

Faith will set you free
