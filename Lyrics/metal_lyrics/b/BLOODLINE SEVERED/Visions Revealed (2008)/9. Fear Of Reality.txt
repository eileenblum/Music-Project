We see shades of contortion
Raining down on us
We have fear of reality
Lifelong dreams aborted
There's never been a resolution
For this man made revolution
We have fear of reality
Lifelong dreams aborted

I don't know what we're waiting for
How long will it last, when will it corrupt?
Can we continue to ignore?
I think it's my time to say it's enough

The truth has been scarred
Wounds filled with infection
We have fear of reality
Lifelong dreams aborted
The smell of society
Like soured milk, it stinks
We have fear of reality
Lifelong dreams aborted

This is not my life
No fear of my reality
This is not my life
No fear of what life may bring
