Standing on the edge of eternity
It's Your face I see
In my thoughts
I still remember Your face
Why did You go away
Why did You leave me
I've waited so long
Just to feel Your loving embrace

I'll see You tomorrow
On the other side of today
I'll see You tomorrow
Where my love will never fade

It's You on the throne
I can see You clearly
You went away
Blood bought destiny
I miss You so much
You did this for me
There's no amount or fee
Price You paid set captives free

It's been so long
Let me see Your face
I want to see Your face
