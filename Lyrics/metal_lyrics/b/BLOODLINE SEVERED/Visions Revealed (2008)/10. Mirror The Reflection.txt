Who is this in the mirror
Staring back at me?
Cold, bleak, dead eyes
Image I never want to see
Where did I go wrong
Dark path's not right for me
This mirror called redemption
Saving me from me

I want to be what You've called me to be
I'm tired of this draining, wasting away

Let Your light shine through me
Cast away all my shame Tear down my life
Revive me to love what I see
Tear it down, tear it down
Mirror the reflection

You've brought me here
To show the world
You through me
No time for fun and games
Let them see this
Mirror You through me
We will take this world by storm

Cast away shame
Tear down my life
Revive me to
Love what I see
Tear it down
Mirror the reflection
