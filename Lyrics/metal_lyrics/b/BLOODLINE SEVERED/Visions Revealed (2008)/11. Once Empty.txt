All alone, seems it's been this way for so long, forever
Left behind, why is there no one by my side?
Dying for life, can someone redeem my tortured soul?
I'd like to end this lifeless battle

I sit in the doorway all alone
Wondering why I've failed you for so long
I wish I were dead
They claim to be His, but there's death on their lips
I want no part in this
I'm so alone as I clench the steel in my hands

I'm here for you when all else has faded
My love formed your existence in the womb
You're My child, I will never forsake you
You've finally seen how empty you are without Me

Return to me
Revive new life
I'm Your salvation

I receive new life
Look beyond what my eyes see
I choose to open my heart to trust
Come and release me
My salvation lies on You
