This constant struggle of spirit &amp; flesh
Each direction comes certain consequence
Survive by following fire by day
When night falls, will it be washed away?

I want to see you face
For this battle I cannot overtake

In my faith
In my heart
I want You next to me
In my mind
My human thoughts
Cries insanity

Do not struggle with thoughts and blindness
This battle is over, the blood has been taken
Disbelief in now your only weakness
Kill humanity, rise over this

No way I'll let you in
No way that you can win
Chapter is written
His sacrifice, your end

Faith
I want to see your face
Thoughts
I don't want to see  you at all
