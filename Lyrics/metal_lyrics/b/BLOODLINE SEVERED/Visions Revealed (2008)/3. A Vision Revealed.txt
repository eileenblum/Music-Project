Now that My time is here
I'm not living in history
I need to see Your purpose
Father, I'm filled with fear
They need a Savior
But is there another way
Father, show Me favor
I will die for them today

When I close My eyes
There revealed a newfound vision
And the vision is with you
With open eyes
There revealed a new chapter written
And the ending is with you

Hanging on the cross of freedom
Death, torment, and agony
Heaven's most costly fee
Suffered thought of you and me
Nearing death's door
Almost in the arms of God
He thought of you and me
As He said "I am through"
