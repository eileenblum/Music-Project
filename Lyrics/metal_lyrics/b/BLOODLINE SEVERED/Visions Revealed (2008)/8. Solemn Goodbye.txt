Don't fool yourself
This time it hasn't changed
Yet you begin to feel so proud
You let it break you
And now it has left you discontent
Only you can help your self torment

Breathe into me, make me renewed
I kiss my life goodbye

And to the life
I swear goodbye
Only to become refined
Welcome to the changing of times

Beneath a pale twilight
Upon this suffering sight
A strong occurrence played here
Making itself so clear
And tell me
Did it change you for the best?
It was there He saved you
There you lay to rest

You say your life is alright
You've been compromised
Flesh is your only fight
A kiss of goodbye
Lay your life to rest
Kiss it, a solemn goodbye

Let God breathe in new life
So you won't be compromised

I swear I'll kiss my life goodbye
