AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Way down in New Orleans, yeah.
I met this old lady,
she said she'd teach me 'bout Voodoo
she said she knew about Voodoo (Voodoo)
she said she'd teach me 'bout Voodoo
she said she knew about Voodoo (Voodoo)

She had an old doll,
she had a long shiny needle (Voodoo)
she held the doll in the air
it looked kinda like me
she took the needle,
stuck it in its eye!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
My eye, bitch!

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

Now I'm still in the room with this crazy bitch,
and she still had the doll.
She said I'll teach you 'bout Voodoo, (Voodoo)
you wanna learn about Voodoo (Voodoo)
She said I'll teach you 'bout Voodoo. (Voodoo)
she said she knew about Voodoo

She held the doll in her hand (Voodoo)
she had some long shiny scissors,
she said some magic words (Voodoo)
the doll looked more and more like me
she held the doll in the air (Voodoo)
she took the scissors,
cut off all its fingers!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
My fingers, bitch!

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
Voodoo, Voodoo
Voodoo, Voodoo

So if you're ever down in New Orleans, yeah.
You might meet an old lady
she might have a doll
it might look like you.
Don't ask about the Voodoo (Voodoo)
stay away from Voodoo (Voodoo)
leave alone the Voodoo, (Voodoo)
motherfuck the Voodoo.
