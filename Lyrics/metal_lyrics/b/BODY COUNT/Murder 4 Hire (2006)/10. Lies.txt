I don't want you anymore and you don't love me...
I can see in your eyes when you talk to me,
You don't fool me...
We had our time but it's over girl,
Now it's deceit...
I know your sleeping around on me,
I know you creep...
Your knives are stuck in my back so deep,
The pain is killing me...

[Chorus:]
Lies, lies, lies, lies
A goddam discrace!
Lies, lies, lies, lies
Straight to my fucking face!
I hate you with all my heart right now,
The simple sight of makes me sick.
What kind of fucking fool do you take me for,
I'm done with your shit.
I gotta follow my soul right now,
I gotta move to my evil side.
No longer can I handle your torture,
Tonight may be your last night.

[Chorus]

"You know the sex didn't bother me..
The fact you may have been with other men..
It was your ability to lie to me.
Look me dead in the eye and tell the lie.
I should, kill you for that.
I've killed many men for less."
Lies, lies
I don't want you anymore and you don't love me...
I can see in your eyes when you talk to me,
You don't fool me...
