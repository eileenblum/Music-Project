"I watch you everyday when you leave your building...
I love the little outfits you wear.
I know you wear em for me.
God I want you."
Since the day you first laid eyes on me,
There was no doubt you would be mine.
You don't know me but I know you want me badly.
Can't control your feelings, it hurts you so you shy away,
You'll love me sooner or later, that's our destiny.

[Chorus (x2):]
In my head...
You are my wife!
In my head...
You only want me!
In my head...
God has a plan!
In my head...
I am your man!
I watch you from my window,
I see you when you sleep each night,
I know you dream of me in your arms,
I'll be there soon my love.
You go to work,
You pass me and you smile at me.
That's just the way you choose to tease me and play...

[Chorus x2]

I call you on the phone at night but never speak,
I love to hear your breath.
It gives me chills, your body seems so close to me.
The other day I saw you with some guy, yo who is he?
He needs to understand that you're my girl and he could die!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will!
You love me!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will!
He's not right for you!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will!
Don't do this to me!
Bitch!

[Chorus]

I've Pictures of you pasted on my wall that I have taken of you.
You walk your dog, I watch you in the shower.
I bought a camera, binoculars and video,
Your with me always, I love you more each hour.
That you don't know me, that turns me on that much more.
I know you know I watch you,
You little teasing whore.
One night soon, I'll introduce you to my flesh,
You are the one God chose, though you don't know me yet!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will!
I love you!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will!
You love me!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will!
He's not right for you!
If I can't have you as mine then no one will!
Don't do this to me!
