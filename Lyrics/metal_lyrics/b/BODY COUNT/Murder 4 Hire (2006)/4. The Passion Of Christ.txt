Ever since I was a baby,
I never knew, if there was any superior power.
I'm a grown man, and I still don't know.
I will be the only one you'll ever trust you'll ever need,
the only truth, the born again, the son of one, the Devils pain.
You all I need, your faiths my life, beliefs my blood,
I feed your hope, my book is law, to challenge me is blasphemy
My wrath is hell.
I have dies a thousand deaths, my pains been felt two thousand years,
And to my soul I've lead my peers, salvation is their only hope.
To save them from their evil ways, their sinning lives, their evil paths,
But you must trust give me your soul, then you must read and then believe!
For your sins I...
For your love I...
For your souls I...
Feel my Passion!
Is there a God? Is there a God?
Is there a God? Is there a God?
Is there a God? Is there a God?
Is there a God? Is there a God?
For your sins I...
For your love I...
For your souls I...
Feel my Passion!
For your sins I...
For your love I...
For your souls I...
Feel my Passion!
I am one the only one, the son of God, If you believe,
The fear of me is taught to those in need of hope,
The sick and broke,
The book of me, written by men,
Considered truth, and by the rules,
All that believe, controls the lives,
It's holly words bought in through church.
It's nemesis is Lucifer, the fallen angel second son,
If you believe his power matches mine with evil, hate and pain!
A war is battled every day, every second so they say.
We are ghosts but still alive but all this requires faith!
Is there a God? Is there a God?
Is there a God? Is there a God?
Is there a God? Is there a God?
Is there a God? Is there a God?
