Drugs, liquor, drugs

I love to smoke crack
I love to shoot smack
I love to fuckin' drink
I love my smoke when it stinks
I need it in my veins
I need it in my brain
What has it done to me,
Street lobotomy

[Chorus]
My brain - melted - down
Brain - melted - down - lobotomy

Need some more dope man
Yeah got
Any acid dude
Got any ludes

[Chorus]

Drugs, liquor, drugs ?

I love to do blow
That's the way to go
You got some PCP ?
How 'bout some LSD ?
I'm havin' lots of fun
I might as well use a gun
Don't even ask my why
Maybe I wanna die

[Chorus]
