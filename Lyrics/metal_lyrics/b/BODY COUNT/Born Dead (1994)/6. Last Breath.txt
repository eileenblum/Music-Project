Oooooohhh am I dreamin' ?
Oooooohhh am I dreamin' ?
Am I alone ?
Oooooohhh am I dreamin' ?
Am I alone ?
Yeah

I like to wait 'til late nite, 'til you
Muthafuckas sleep
I crawl in through your window and I
Muthafuckin' creep
I catch you little punk ass kids asleep in your beds,
And I take out my knife and I cut off your
Muthafuckin' heads
I want your last breath
I want your last breath

[Chorus]
You're not dreamin'
You're not alone

Oh I want your last breath, your
Last breath, your last breath
I want your last breath

So you go downstairs to see if everything is alright
You're afraid you're alone and it's late on a rainy night
Are you asleep or awake you don't know
As you turn around,
And my rusty blade cuts you open and you hit the ground
I want your last breath
I want your last breath

[Chorus]

You're no dreamin'
