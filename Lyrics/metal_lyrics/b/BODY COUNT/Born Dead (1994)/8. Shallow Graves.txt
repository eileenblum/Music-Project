[Chorus:]
You give me for honor (graves)
Where your soldeirs lay (graves)
They're so far away (graves)
The home of the brave (graves)

I won't die in your bullshit wars no more
I won't fight to my death for you
I won't watch my poor mama cry no more
Muthafuck your red, white and blue

[Chorus]

Thousands of men go to war to fight for
Politics which they don't understand
Murder people who they never met
When they make it home they're
Considered a vet
Fire drops from the sky as the young boys die

Far from home, all alone, it's a sin
All you get in return in a shit shallow grave
Cause in war there's no way you can win

Mia, yeah right, you think they give a fuck,
You're just pawns in the game off the board
Brainwashed to the point where you kill at
The drop of a dime
But it's not called a crime
Vietnam, persian gulf, did we win ?  Did we lose ?
Thousands die, human beings you choose
Once in you're owned by the man,
Uncle sam is his name, you're his slave,
Shallow graves

[Chorus]

You give me for honor
