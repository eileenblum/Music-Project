Yeah Yeah

Murder, death

As I search to analyze reality, the true
Meaning of life,
Out simple existence means nothing
God has a gun, the truth, life is a slow noose
He's invincible
Better watch his knife,
There is no escape from the slow kill
When it's time to go god serves a death blow,
You have no choice, don't even try
The only choice is suicide

Surviving the game

No escape

No one's ever escaped

Die
