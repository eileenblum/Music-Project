People say, âIce, you got moneyâ
I say, âMan, I just got some money
And I know how easy it is to lose itâ
You know what Iâm saying?
I know how one mistake can cost you it all
I didnât come from money
I came from the dark side
And I never wanna go back there

The ghetto is not black, the ghetto is poor
You donât know me, you ainât never met me before

You pre-judge my life and you donât know my pain
You feel youâre so much better when weâre all the same
Because you have money you feel youâre above us all
So fucking self-righteous until you take that fall
And then youâre flat broke and you need food to eat
Once behind guarded gates and now you walk the streets
Police are different now, they get fucked with every day
You walk my people now, they move the other way
You never gave a fuck, just lived your selfish life
You never broke a law, hungry and fucking might

Welcome to the dark side
Survival makes you blood thirsty
Into the dark side
Survival makes you blood thirsty
Welcome to the dark side
Survival makes you blood thirsty

Donât ever judge a man till you lived his life
The tables could turn in the blink of an eye
Talking shit from that high horse you ride
One mistake for you, into the dark side

Into the dark side
Survival makes you blood thirsty
Welcome to the dark side
Survival makes you blood thirsty
Into the dark side
Survival makes you blood thirsty
