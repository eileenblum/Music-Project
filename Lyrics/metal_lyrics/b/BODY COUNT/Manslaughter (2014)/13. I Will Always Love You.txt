This song is dedicated to the heroes, the real heroes!
Young men and women that have given their life and risked their life for this country!

Thought you knew everything, dropped out of school at 17
Trying to get a job at an early age,
But no diploma means minimum wage.
Bumped into a military recruiter,
Said this ain't no game, no first person shooter.
With high-school you missed it,
So that day you enlisted.

First day off the cattle truck
Basic training, scared as fuck,
Drill instructors, demons from hell
You never forget once you hear them yell
Six weeks of torture drives you insane
March, run, march, train!
You're asking yourself why the fuck you came,
Lock and load 30 rounds, watch your lane!

I, I always will love you
I, I always will love you
I, I always will love you
We, we always will love you
We, we always will love you
We always will love you
Always will love you!
Always will love you!

Basic moves you to AIT,
Then to your unit, company, squad
You finally get a break cause the training's hard.
You meet your new family, a platoon men
You bond with them, they become your boys
Two months later you're all deployed.
Now down range, shit gets real
Enemies shoot back, confirm your kills
You learn firsthand, PTSD,
Your best friend's killed by an IED
You watch your whole team get blown apart
You catch a frag and a purple heart.
You're right back home, you've lost your pride
You struggle with thoughts of suicide
To this country you gave your life,
And we must respect your sacrifice!

I, I always will love you
I, I always will love you
I, I always will love you
We, we always will love you
We, we always will love you
We always will love you
Always will love you!
Always will love you!
Always will love you!
Always will love you!

This goes out to my fellow vets
Sometimes you come home, you don't get the respect you deserve
You don't get the love and the praise that you should
Well, I'm here to give it to you right now!
A lot of times people don't realize
That the freedoms we have here
People have fought and died for...
Given their lives!
Come on, man!
I love you!

I, I always will love you
I, I always will love you
I, I always will love you
We, we always will love you
We, we always will love you
We always will love you
Always will love you!
Always will love you!
Always will love you!
Always will love you!
