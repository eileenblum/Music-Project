Flesh on flesh, full contact
Risk your life in a blink of an eye!
Man on man, mortal combat
Don't fall, you could lose it all!

The more brutal the better,
The harder to rest,
Body clash at the edge of the stage
I've seen it all, every show
One thing never cease to amaze!

There's a bitch in the pit
A fucking pit in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit

Keep it moving, this ain't no fucking joke
One slip, you could get your neck broke.
This is the killing floor where the weak lose
All the fuck I command you to do is move your ass!
Move your ass!

She don't give a fuck
She's harder than men,
In the chaos, song after song
She's not afraid to bleed,
She begs for more speed
In the mosh pit all night long.

She's in the heart of the action,
She knows what she's doing
Her Doc Marten's stomp the floor
Every night, every show
There's a bitch in the pit!

There's a bitch in the pit
A fucking pit in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit
There's a bitch in the pit

She came here to party,
She's ready to rock
She said, let's ride or die!

She ain't scared of nothing,
She's ready to fight,
She said she'll die tonight!

She came here to party,
She's ready to rock
She said, let's ride or die!

She ain't scared of nothing,
She's ready to fight,
She said she'll die tonight!

She came here to party,
She's ready to rock
She said, let's ride or die!

She ain't scared of nothing,
She's ready to fight,
She said she'll die tonight!

There's a bitch in the pit!
Who the fuck is that bitch?
