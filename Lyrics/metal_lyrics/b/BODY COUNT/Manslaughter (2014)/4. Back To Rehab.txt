You say you took your last drink, bullshit
Youâre checkinâ in next week, bullshit
You say youâre finished with drugs, bullshit
Do I look like a fool to you?
You said you had your last trip
Tell this to somebody else
Youâre checkinâ in next week
How do you expect me to believe that?

Go, bak, back, back, back to rehab
Go back, back, back, back to rehab
Go, bak, back, back, back to rehab
Go back, back, back, back to rehab
Go, go, go

You say youâre aiming high
Do I look like a fool to you?
You said you had your last drink
Tell that to somebody else
Youâre checkinâ in next week
How do you expect me to believe that?
Iâm sick and fucking tired
Of hearing your fucking excuses

Go, bak, back, back, back to rehab
Go back, back, back, back to rehab
Go, bak, back, back, back to rehab
Go back, back, back, back to rehab
Go, go, go

We sing this song or all of us
That have people who struggle with addictions
We sing this song cause we want you all to live
And donât waste your life, man
Go, go, go, go

Why I it always anyone else instead of you?
Youâre gonna wake up dead in this game you play
You got one chance
Iâm just checkinâ you in
The sad thing is we donât wanna see you die

You say youâre aiming high
Do I look like a fool to you?
You said you had your last drink
Tell that to somebody else
Youâre checkinâ in next week
How do you expect me to believe that?
You think all of your friends turned on you?

Go, bak, back, back, back to rehab
Go back, back, back, back to rehab
Go, bak, back, back, back to rehab
Go back, back, back, back to rehab
Go, go, go, go back
