I got a hoe from the East, I got a hoe from the West
Got a hoe who likes to jerk it off and rob it in a chest

I got a bitch from the North, I got a bitch from the South
I got a bitch who like to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with air, a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife, a bitch with a gun
A bitch with an ass big as a TV set
And thereâs a bitch over there,
Hey, the one Iâm gonna get or maybe not!
She might not like me, though
No sweat to a vet, I rock her sister, though.
Or I rock the whole damn heard

Fuck them all and leave them on a curb.
I got a bitch with a mink, who likes a fat gold ling,
Who likes to fuck me with an ass upon the kitchen sink.
I got a bitch with tits, a bitch with ass
A bitch with none, but hey, I give her a pass, and I love them all!
I love them crazily, and they love me back
Thatâs why they stay with me!

I got a bitch, this old, a bitch, this new
A bitch who loves velvet and the colours blue.
I got a bitch this fat, a bitch this built
A bitch who all the titties give powder milk.
I got a bitch whoâs funny, a bitch who ainât
A bitch who can sing, a bitch who canât
I got a bitch who loves fucking on airplane
I even got a bitch who have soul train.
I got a bitch who owns rock top bands, long ends!
I got a bitch whoâs broke as a plum
But sheâs the most fun!
I got a bitch who plays piano, a bitch who donât
A bitch who dances naked, a bitch who wonât
A bitch whoâs short, a bitch whoâs tall
A bitch who burns my phone and probably calls
And I love them all, I love them crazily
And they love me back, thatâs why they stay with me
