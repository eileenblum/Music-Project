Pray for death
Pray

You crossed your last motherfucker
Itâs time to pay your dues
Itâs time to make you suffer
Itâs time to turn the screws
Your pain will be my pleasure
Your screams will make me come
Your useless pleads for mercy
Iâm having too much fun
My only plan is to keep you alive
So you feel every burn, every cut of my knife
As I break through your skin and your flesh hits the ground
I dismember you slowly and feel your heart pound
You just crossed the wrong person, torture is my biz
Your fatal mistake, tonightâs my revenge
Once you bleed at my feet you thought you got away
Now you beg for your life, I suggest you should pray

Pray
Pray for death
Pray

Iâm barely getting started, this might go on for days
Transfuse you with new blood so you donât fade away
Maybe Iâll pull your teeth out, maybe Iâll split your nuts
Maybe just hit your chakra, maybe just spill your guts

Haha, you didnât think Iâd found you, huh?
Now I got you here
Tied down in a motherfucking chair
Oh, look at you, youâre crying now, youâre sorry now
What should I do? Let me look at my utensils
Oh, yeah, I got this record death chill right here
Maybe these pliers, maybe this blowtorch
Oh, look at you, youâre crying now

Pray
Pray for death
Pray

My only plan is to keep you alive
So you feel every burn, every cut of my knife
As I break through your skin and your flesh hits the ground
I dismember you slowly and feel your heart pound
You just crossed the wrong person, torture is my biz
Your fatal mistake, tonightâs my revenge
Once you bleed at my feet you thought you got away
Now you beg for your life, I suggest you should pray
