The stress is killing me
The pressure is agony
Most people work till they break
While others just take
Stop begging, get a job
Get a gun, motherfucker, go out and rob

Iâm up at 5 AM, gettinâ my work in
You sleep all day wondering why youâre broke
Then you get on the phone and sweat your friends
Sob stories, sob stories never end
You claim youâre fly but always need
Youâre always broke but got money for weed

I got a problem, too
I keep feeding you
I got a problem, too
I keep helping you
I got a problem, too
I keep feeding you
I got a problem, too
I keep helping you
Get a job, motherfucker
Learn to rob, motherfucker
Get a job, motherfucker
Learn to rob, motherfucker

So you donât carry a gun, You still steal
You never pay people back and never will
And we keep handinâ out, youâre breaking my balls
Till I give the fuck up and block your calls
Now Iâm the bad guy with a bank account
You just move to your next friend and burn him out
Everyone knows this guy, this shitâs true
Or maybe this songâs about you

I got a problem, too
I keep feeding you
I got a problem, too
I keep helping you
I got a problem, too
I keep feeding you
I got a problem, too
I keep helping you

Get a job, motherfucker
Learn to rob, motherfucker
Get a job, motherfucker
Learn to rob, motherfucker

Get a job!
