Yo I came home from work the other day
I was tired
I just wanted to sit back in my big chair
And play a little Xbox
You know
Relax a little
Then my wife comes in
She starts telling me
I play too much Xbox
I said what the fuck do you mean
This is just how I relax
Can I just play a little Xbox
Then she says
I saw on Oprah today
That guys who play video games
Don't love their wives
I'm like motherfucking bitch
Fuck Oprah
I don't give a fuck
I wanna play my video games
I don't give a fuck about Oprah
Oprah ain't got no man
You better worry about your motherfucking self
I just wanna kill some motherfuckers on Xbox
She said
You seem like you have a anger problem
Maybe you need some help
I'm like
Bitch call the police now
Gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see they way
I'm not crazy - institution
You're the one that's crazy -institution
You're driving me crazy - institution
They put me in a institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the professional help
To save from the enemy myself
The other day I go on the internet
I'm just trying to check my email
So put in my password
It says I have an invalid password
I know my fuckin' password
So then it says go to customer service
So I get on customer service
I start talking to this dude
This motherfucker sounds like he's from India or some shit
He says to me
Whats your first dogs name
I don't know what my fuckin' first dogs name was
What the fucks the matter wit you
I just want my password
Gimme my fuckin' password
So then he ends up giving me my password
And he says
Your password has been sent to your email address
I'm like I cant get in my email address
What about cant get in my email address do you not understand motherfucker
He says oh my god
It seems like you have an anger problem
You should have that checked out
I'm not crazy - institution
You're the one that's crazy -institution
You're driving me crazy - institution
They put me in a institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the professional help
To save from the enemy myself
The other day I'm just sittin' alone
On lunch break at my job
Trying to eat a ham sandwich
Got little potato chips on the side
Little koo-aid
This motherfucker walks up to me and says
Are you gonna eat that
Like yeah I'm gonna eat that
What the fuck you think I'm gonna do
Shove it up your ass
Do you understand that that pork can kill you
Look motherfucker
Pork is not gonna kill me
Unless they figure a way
To shoot it out of a fucking gun
But I might kill you
If you keep fuckin' with me
He says hey calm down
I'm a vegan
Fuck a vegan
I could give a fuck if you eat sawdust motherfucker
Just step away from my fucking sandwich
He said do you realize how much sugar is in that kool-aid
I said do you realize how much blood is in a human body
Do you wanna see it motherfucker
Oh my god
You need therapy
You have an anger problem
Ahhhhhhh
I'm not crazy - institution
You're the one that's crazy -institution
You're driving me crazy - institution
They put me in a institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the professional help
To save from the enemy myself
Suicidal
