Police are hunting for two suspects in a violent home invasion, they are worried that these men may strike again...

I've got no plans for getting loot legal,
All black gear on twelve inch suppressor
44 Desert Eagle
Layin' in your parking lot,
Creeping in your lobby,
Resist,
No problem pushing holes through your fuckin' body,
You can't escape me if I want what you got,
You can't evade me no chance to call the cops,
I'm doing my job this is just what I do,
You makin' money
I come and visit you...

[2x]
I gotta get paid,
I gotta get paid,
I gotta get paid
The ski mask way

I'm in your rear view
When you leave the club,
How cold could I be,
You look like food to me,
All on Instagram,
Showin' that cash off,
What you really hope,
I don't take this mask off,
Don't make me punish you,
Don't wanna hurt your wife,
Come up off that watch,
It ain't worth your life,
I have a cool wool,
Life has no meaning,
We roll late night and
Hunt human beings...

[2x]
I gotta get paid,
I gotta get paid,
I gotta get paid,
The ski mask way

OK, you know what the fuck this is
Pay attention,
Everybody move against that wall,
Get down on your knees,
Lock your fingers behind your motherfuckin' head,
Now I didn't come here for no bullshit,
We want what's in that motherfuckin' safe,
You, you know the combination,
Bring your punk ass over here,
I will blow your motherfucking brains out,
You're gonna open that safe right now,
That's your bitch, grab his bitch, bring her over here,
No, I will not shoot you,
I'm gonna shoot the bitch,
Open the motherfuckin' safe now motherfucker,
This is business, nigga...
New car, we might come to visit you,
Big jewels, we might come to visit you,
Flash cash, we might come to visit you,
Post pictures, we might come to visit you,
Bring spurs, we might come to visit you,
Sell drugs, we might come to visit you,
Brag a lot, we might come to visit you,
Pray to God, we don't come to visit you...

[2x]
I gotta get paid,
I gotta get paid,
I gotta get paid,
The ski mask way
