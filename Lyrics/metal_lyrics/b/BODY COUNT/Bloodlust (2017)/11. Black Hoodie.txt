All these people out here,
Trippin' off of police brutality,
Like this shit is something new.
Gimme a fucking break,
I been talking about this shit for over twenty years,
And now you can kill a motherfucker,
Just because of how he's dressed,
Are you fucking serious?

Got on my black hoodie,
It pulled up on my head,
I didn't have a gun,
So why am I dead?
You didn't have to shoot me,
And that's a known fact,
And now I'm laying face down,
With bullets in my back
[2x]

This is how it happened...
Out late night just chilling with my clique,
No one had a gun,
Everyone's legit,
One of my boys is drunk,
I'm talking toed back,
He could barely talk,
Off that cognac,
Then the cops rolled up,
I don't know why he ran,
Maybe traffic warrants,
I still don't understand,
The motherfucker's crazy,
The homies laugh,
He might have got a block,
And then we heard shots,
The fucking cop shot him,
Yo my niggas dead,
They hit him twice in the back,
Once in the head and leg,
We all went crazy on that pig shit,
They aimed at us,
They meant business,
They didn't have to shoot him,
He didn't have a gun,
What they're gonna say is,
Why the fuck he run?
We can't be seeing this,
I'm like what the fuck,
My mans laying dead,
They're still covering him up...
You motherfuckers,
Call the fucking paramedics man,
My man's not breathing man,
The fuck's the matter with you,
Ah
Shit...

Got on my black hoodie,
It pulled up on my head,
I didn't have a gun,
So why am I dead?
You didn't have to shoot
Me,
And that's a known fact,
And now I'm laying face down with bullets in my back.

...woop woop,
That's the sound of the police,
That's the sound on the streets,
Woop woop,
That's the sound on the streets,
That's the sound of the police

Now it's your day in court,
We gotta have hope,
Maybe some justice,
Someone got it on video,
They say blue something,
He used to gang bang,
They made my homie look like fucking shit on everything,
Had on a black hoodie,
That's all it took,
D.a. portrayed as a dirty fucking street crook,
They let the cops off,
Nobody fucking marched,
Nobody had a clue,
This never made the news

Got on my black hoodie [3x]
