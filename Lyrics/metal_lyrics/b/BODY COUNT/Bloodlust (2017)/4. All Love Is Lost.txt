[feat. Max Cavalera]I thought you were my friend,
I gave you my trust,
I would've died for you,
Then the second I turn my back,
You fuck me over,
All love is lost,
Now you have the nerve to tell me you're sorry,
All love is lost,
You gotta be outta your motherfuckin' mind,

All love is lost,
You never loved me, you never fuckin' did,
All love is lost,
Once you betray me,
That is the fuckin' end,
All love is lost...

I don't give a fuck 'bout what you do with your life [4x]

I don't give a fuck about you,
You can fuckin' die,
I could fuckin' care less,
When you fuckin' cry,
My heart is stone cold,
You left a broken soul,
You destroyed everything I thought was true,
And now you talk shit,
'cause I don't give a fuck,
And now I'm long gone
Joke is on you,
I don't care where you are,
Don't care what you do,
You say you hate me
Cool
I fuckin' hate you, hate you,

All love is lost, all love is lost,
You never loved me, you never fuckin' did,
All love is lost,
Once you betray me,
That is the fuckin' end,
All love is is lost...

See, you the kind of motherfucker with no honor,
The kind of motherfucker with no loyalty,
Motherfucker you can't trust,
Cross me, and then you want another chance...
One strike and I don't care about your fuckin' life,
You're not no friend to me
You're fucking dead to me,
Don't give a fuck about the shit that that you was goin' through,
You did some shit to me, I could never do to you,
'cause I'm not no fake drunk,
I'm not no punk bitch,
You're lucky I ain't put your ass in a dark ditabbed on the floorch,
And now you want some type of sympathy from me now,
If you were stabbed on the floor, I'd watch you bleed out....

[Max vocals:]
H, is for your hell I unleash,
A, I arise to crush talents,
T, I am your terror,
E, destroy the enemy...

[Ice-t vocals:]
People say I'm cold-hearted, why,
'cause you fucked over me,
'cause you broke every promise you made to me,
Because you said you were my friend
And then you stabbed me in my motherfucking back,

All love is lost, all love is lost, all love is lost,
You never loved me, you never fucking did,
Once you betray me,
That is the fucking end,
All love is lost.
