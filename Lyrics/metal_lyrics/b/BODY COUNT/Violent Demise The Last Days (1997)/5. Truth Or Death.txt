Lies, betrayal, lies
truth or death.
Lies, betrayal, lies.

Who the fuck can I trust
the whole fuckin' world is built on deception,
false perception, look you dead in the eye and lie,
your best friend'll stab you in the back
yo, what the fuck is that.

Politicians lie,
what the fuck is that
your lover lies,
what the fuck is that.
The police lies,
what the fuck is that
the church fuckin' lies,
what the fuck is that.

Somebody tell me where's the truth
every holy book is written by man probably by a liar's hand
and if you feel that public schools are teachin'
truth to the youth, motherfucka you livin' a lie too.

Lawyers lie, what the fuckis that
doctorslie, what the fuck is that
doctors lie, what the fuck is that
your mother and father lie,
what the fuck is that
You lie to yourself
yo, what the fuck is that

There is no truth only varaiations of lies.
Don't try to figure it out honesty is extinct and if
it ever did exist the human race took it out.
