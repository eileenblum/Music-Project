I loved her with my heart and soul,
gave her everything diamonds and gold.
She stabbed me in the back, fucked my friends,
partied in my house, bitch wrecked my benz.

I used to love her
she did me wrong, now she's gone.

I trusted her with cash and jewels,
she laughed in my face, called me a fool.
The love I gave to her was in vain.
Now I think it's time to return the pain.
I came home one night, she was in my bed
with my best friend giving him head.
What really pissed me off about this shit,
the bitch had never even sucked my dick.
