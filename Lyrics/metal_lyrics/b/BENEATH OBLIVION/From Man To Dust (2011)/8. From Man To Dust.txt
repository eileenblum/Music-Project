We are all slaves, to this decline
And all we gave, meant nothing
To stand with pride, the defiant ones
Lost at the end, hope fades last of all
No more tomorrows, just this waking contempt
For the art of the dying and the depraved
The white light
The condemned
Cold humming souls that linger on
Alone in shame wanting to dieâ¦
With no God, with no cry
Only the shadows, of divided sons
The riot remained
A spirit survived
Now time will take us home
Away from the pale horizon
âNow I have become Death, the destroyer of worlds.â
All of our life
All of our pain
Failed some dream
Deliver us from ourselves
Give nothing to the illusion, of new dawn
Of dead religions, false idols and corruption
Before the storm, there was silence
The child must turn away, away from the sun.
The blistered truth, go forth free from guilt
There is absolution in your death-
None of your sadness can save the doomed
We were once kings, of brave words
A war of common rebellions, attrition and spite
Before this tragedy, there was mansâ hatred-
So save nothing of man, let go of the past
The year is now zero, the mark of madmen
Forever cast down, the end of all time-
Destroy me, Mother
Take this life, spare me
Murder, is redemption
Release me, to mercy
The bastards come home, with the sunrise
Filth and survival, desperate hours
Not the burning eyes of the forgotten
From failure to perdition
Manâs betrayal is our trust
And so now the fate is sealed of a planet that loathes
and burns, and spreads itsâ diseaseâ¦
Given up without ability to forgive
Infecting the world, itsâ womb, and itsâ consciousness.
Inner and outer conflicts have grown, mental, global, crumbling and too far gone.
