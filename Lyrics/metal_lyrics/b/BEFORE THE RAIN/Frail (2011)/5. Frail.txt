Still is the time
Like i won't remember this day
Cleansed is my mind
All seems null inside
I want them to...
Forgive me, for not knowing
Bestow me safe shelter
Before me there was nothing
This skin underneath my nails
I've always wondered where it came from
But my memory... it's not what it used to be
I can only gather small pieces
Like clouds of black fumes
Cutting through me, piercing deep
Like obsidian blades, soft and dense
A drowning stasis, which i hold so dear
It's a waking dream, unlikely plausible
But at this moment it's all i can grasp
Still, something feels shattered
Consuming itself to a point of irreversible fragility
My skin, my bones, my nerves and my soul...
So frail
A mountain made of glass
And overlaying curtains
From this cathartic slumber
I will never wake
So frail
In a seismic rapture
Now motionless
In the rest of my dreams
I was betrayed
There is dust in my eyes
And it lingers still
While my body turns to sand
It's a moment of clarity
When all comes together
Making perfect sense
That couldn't be me... i was never there
I was never here
