At the edge of the sea
A glimpse towards the sun
I embrace the warmth
And all is revealed
But i forgot my name
A memory, that it's not there
A sun, i would not dare. to touch
Coming closer, onto you
Crossing storms and clouds for you
Towards the sun
All we be forgiven, all will be lost
This stream of bleak emotions
Pours weakness within my blood
I crave for the grandeur
For the shining beauty
Fury, consuming fury
Fire, cleansing fire
Take me astray
Away from the earth
Free from the chains of flesh
Made of stars and light
In the wings
Of prosper and shine...
Of nothing
I will prosper and shine...
I am the breath of life
I am the bringer of joy
I am the sun
