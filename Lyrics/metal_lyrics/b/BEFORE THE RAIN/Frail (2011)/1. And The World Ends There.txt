Horizon is dyed in red
And the world ends there
In the void ghosts swarm by
And we utter them goodbye
Thunders in the twilight, bring forth despair
In turbulent spirals, birds will fly astray
At the end of the day, life will cease to be
Grief turns hollow, over the blooded sea
I will pass unknown, in the white foamed shoals
I crave for the thunderous glow
For the mist and the falling snow
Bring forth the fiery streams
A spectrum of lightshed gleams
Find me in the depths of woe
Grief turns to hollow
Taken far on black wings
They will pass alone
Vagrantly migrating
A ghost-like wandering
On to sunken shores
Do you reckon this
As the end of all things?
When seamless fading weaves
And fractured pieces sway
Do you reckon this
As the closure of days?
The world is reshaping
Reshaping, and coming to an end
Bring forth the fiery streams
A spectrum of lightshed gleams
And find me... find me
In a fire of endless grow
And sear me with frostbite breeze
In the throes of artemis
The world is re-shaping and coming to an end
The world is coming to an end
