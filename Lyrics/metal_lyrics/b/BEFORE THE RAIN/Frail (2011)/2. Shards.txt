My light is pale... devoid of color
Shards trespass, my heart
Reason abandons all
And i'm anchored, beneath this sea of regret
Your never ending sea
No radiance, nor the blossom of nature
My dead desert, my heart
I have gathered winds
I have yearned for despair
But i am nothing
Nothing but flesh
Landscapes burn, where rain falls not
Frail, so frail
Let us linger
Where ashes fade away
Come on, in here, and see me turn to stone
I have gathered winds
I have yearned for despair
I am nothing... nothing but shards
Shards of stone
Let me lay alone, in my desert abode
Alone...
My heart has turned to stone
Let us linger, where ashes fade
Com on in here, and see me turn to stone
I have gathered winds
I yearn for despair
I am nothing... nothing but shards
Shards of stone
Let me lay alone, in my desert abode
Alone
My heart turned to stone
Alone
My breath is stale, devoid of life
Shards trespass my heart
Reason forsakes us all, and i am anchored
Beneath this sea of regret
Your never-ending sea...
