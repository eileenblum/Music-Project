Take me down, with your sorrow.
Make me smile, with your joy.
Let me cross, your river,
Let me burn, in your flames.

The ease of calm streams
Are the remnants of distress.
Bathed with golden beams...
In the ease of calm streams.

When all I needed was someone to hold.
Where did you stand?
Where were you?
When I needed...
Was someone to hold...
Loneliness Hurts.

Dreaming with the lines of your face
With your smile (and) With your hair
Imagining a paradise of roses
But far away from touching you.
