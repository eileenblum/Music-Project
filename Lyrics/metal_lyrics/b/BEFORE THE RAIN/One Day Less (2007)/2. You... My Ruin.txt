Your silver tears fall
On a garden at your feet
Giving to the withered flowers
A taste of your eyes so sweet.

My flesh beneath the trees
In a coil of shadows.
Under grasp of aged stones nourished

Do you remember,
My heart turned to dust?
I still remember before the rain,
You left I still remember

Mountains collapse silent and absent.
As ephemeral years go by
I've stayed beside you
My ruin.

At your feet, these ruins decay
For your sake
My ruin.
