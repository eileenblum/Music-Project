If I fall, will you follow?
For I am down
If you fall, I will follow,
Cause I am a part of you

My wounds will bleed,
From your cutting words.
Your skin is the void a sanctum of wreckage

My wounds still bleed,
From your cutting words.
Your skin is the void a sanctum, for my wreckage.

Enlightenment is for martyrs
And you've built me a monument of light
A false beacon, where I ll wreak my ship.

The wise sometimes from wisdom ways depart
Rejection regains its wounds
