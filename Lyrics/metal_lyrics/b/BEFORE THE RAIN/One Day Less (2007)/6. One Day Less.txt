Dusted paintings.
Sombre images of yesterday
These memories, chased by winds and clouds
Take me to consider, all left undone.

Can you recall our last sunset
A day close to eternity...

Hours rushing to end,
Uttering promises never made.
Afar the wind will take them,
Astray and strange.

Shadows rush to blend,
Years are are made of sand
I'll watch your hair grow,
While I hold your hand.

Maybe each day should be our last
And each hour devours the past.
Bring us, a feast of gods
Before the closing choir echos.

Can you recall our last entwine
A moment close to divinity...

I crave, for the evening...
In a garment of stars everlasting,
Fragile radiance...
If the dawn never rises.

I crave, for a new beginning,
And write this history over...
To sculpt a flawless tale,
In my imaginary world.

One day less, I have...
To feel your skin.
One day less, I have...
To see your smile.
One day less, I have...
To taste your lips.
One day less, I have...
To see your eyes.

One day less, I have...
To see you fade.
One day less...
One dream less I have today...
