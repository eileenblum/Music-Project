hereby,
everything turns elemental,
particles of dust become...
colossal.
departing
from the uniform threads
opiate cognition weaves
fills the void, like a chorus/
and stranded nebulas
are consumed in a grasp for air
like a famine...
everything, devoured and renewed
in a wondrous concussion...
somewhere not there
the dissolving landscape
blends into obsidian shapes
to an absence of matter and light.
like one thousand suns
on the bring of self-consupption
only to ascent again
in igneous dioramas
a one time spectacle
for fragile mortal.
"i cast the stars unto the sky ornamenting the heavens in shimmering blue splendor
with promise they would forever burn, intertwined by the love of you and i.
i was rejected... rejected when she cast herself into the sea
it's black waves smothering and locking her throat forever.
cursed am i... a child of the calm divine
i scream to the heavens and cursed each fading star by name."
