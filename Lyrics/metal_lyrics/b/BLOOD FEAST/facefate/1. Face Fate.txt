Lunar eclipse of the night
Soundless lure of the wind
Something hiding out of sight
The screams sound deafening
It comes from the earth's core
Infestation from below
Threat increasing stronger
It pounces on top, blood starts to flow

It goes from town to town
Unchanging by the days
Indecisive of their numbers
Not caring of the prey

Lives revolving
Around eternal light
Encircled inside of
Great magical shape
You can't see
Trapped in time
No way you'll be
Ever again fine

Not too many light years
Yet to come, soon to pass
Trudging through the darkness
Winding down the final mass
Eternal fall of mankind
Winding paths, no place to turn
Shadows growing stronger
Dimming as candles burn

Famished of our light years
They have gone, none to pass
Pleading with the darkness
Closing in on final mass
Blink, but not to quickly
Close your eyes, hold your breath
For this will be your last you know
You have passed, face your death

Screams
Eternal blackness
Falling
The sounds of death

Have you liked what you've seen?
For you'll not see again
Come the final eclipse
Brings the birth of the end

Lives revolving
Around eternal light
Encircled inside of
Great magical shape
You can't see
Trapped in past
Hold your breath
This is your last
