Tasting flesh wounds that bleed
Born from the fire of ecstasy
In this life that we lead
I only want to see you bleed
Screaming vengeance blood of the lamb
Taken heed to this hellish command
Forged in fire the devilish wrath
Submerge yourself in a blood bath

Icy sensations up your spine
The sound perilous through your veins
The anger and its fucking plight
You must feel the might
Of Blood Lust

In the eyes of my pagan god
Cast no shadow in the fog
Dead of night the legions come
Drink the blood as Satan runs
Jesus Christ burns in hell
Burned at the cross to rot and smell
Kill for pleasure all who remain
Maniac killer cannot be tamed

Icy sensations up your spine
The sound perilous through your veins
The anger and its fucking plight
You must feel the might
Of Blood Lust

Invaders from the earth and sky
Bring devastation to the land
Killing all in their way
Death from hell by their hand
Spoils of victory in front of them
Rivers of fire run their course
All the slain are the prize
Drink the blood of every corpse

Icy sensations up your spine
The sound perilous through your veins
The anger and its fucking plight
You must feel the might
Of Blood Lust
