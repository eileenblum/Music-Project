With the destruction of the land
Death will be close at hand
A mishap long, long ago
Who taught us to fight, no one knows
Terrorism a thing of the past
The power in the wrong hands kills at last
Survivors are few and scattered
Their remains are torn and tattered

Get your guns! Get your weapons!
We're going out for the killing
Don't get in our way we'll stomp you
If you live we take no prisoners

Sick! Disgust! Eternal! Rest!
They come from all sides
Better make sure you put out your best
Sick! Disgust! Eternal! Rest!
AAARRRGGGHHH!

The ultimate sacrifice has come to us
Worse than exploding a school bus
The time to regroup and strengthen
To the earth's end will make us legends
Kill all mutated and birth-defected children
Leaving no sight for anyone to catch them
The endless winter is cold and harsch
Remembering when you thought it was a farce

Sick! Disgust! Eternal! Rest!
AAARRRGGGHHH!

The world as we know it never regains
It all changes in time, not quite the same
The marauders reap, havoc in time
But they all run around the world more or less blind
In all the confusion no one knows
The evil one plans for everything to blow
One last bomb was left for some strange reason
Ot goes off now there will be
No more seasons
