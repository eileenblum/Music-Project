The eventual day
Of your passing will come
Leaving you stiff and lifeless
Just your soul to descend
Resisting deaths' struggle
Making efforts in vain
You know soon your welfare will perish

Perpetual rejection, mortal dissection
You soon will pass - succeeding none
Terminating physically
Promoting eternal suffrage

A vast reduction, life destruction
Deterioration - been overcome
Before you came, now you've come, soon to
Pass, now you're gone

Lifebloods been drained
Only extinction remains
Cancellations of life
Rebirth is denied

Death is now drawing much closer
And soon you will snap from within
No reward for this merit through passing
Meet your end as death sucks you in
The blanket of blackness will soon cover
Cancelling the earth, sun and sky
Life has run out and your cause is no more
Are you ready to die?

Perpetual rejection, mortal dissection
You soon will pass - succeeding none
Terminating physically
Promoting eternal suffrage
A vast reduction, life destruction
Deterioration - been overcome
Before you came, now you've come, soon to
Pass, now you're gone

Lifebloods been drained
Only extinction remains
Cancellations of life
Rebirth is denied

A vast reduction, life destruction
Deterioration, and so it is done
