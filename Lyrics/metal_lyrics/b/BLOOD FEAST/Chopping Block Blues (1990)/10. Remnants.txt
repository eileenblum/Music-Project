I have no fear as I walk through the valley of death
For I am the meanest motherfucker in the valley

As I walk through the valley of death
This massive extinction that lingers before me
Saturates me with most immense pleasure, like no other
If only I could bring each one of you back and hand your severed heads
To your uselesness personally, unfortunately, that option does not exist

This is history, dust, nothing more than dust
I am your keeper
The one is charge, big fuckin' daddy, in complete control of all things
As I walk, I walk alone, but I have no fear as I walk through the valley of death
For I am the meanest motherfucker in the valley, the only motherfucker
I have no fear
Nothing!
