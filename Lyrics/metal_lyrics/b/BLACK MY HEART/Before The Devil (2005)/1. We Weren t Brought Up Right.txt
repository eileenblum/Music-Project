Kill or be killed life or death
Don't hesitate don't ever fucking regret
Kill or be killed I learned from the best
Then I burned the bridge and sweared yo all sweet revenge
So rain on me let it pour in my whole life I've never felt so warm
Todays the day I free myself so black your fucking heart
Devils they grow inside us and burn away our fear
As you can see we're already dead
So rain on me let it pour in my whole life I've never felt so warm
We're all already dead this is our family no one get left behind
This is our family you cant kill us all.
