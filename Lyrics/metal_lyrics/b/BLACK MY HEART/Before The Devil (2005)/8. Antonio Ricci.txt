I fire at will I'm taking everything I'll bring this city to it's knees
I'm sick and tired of being hungry I've spend my last fucking breath
Passed out and my nightmare doesn't end everyone of you gets a bullet in the head
FUCK. it doesn't end passed out on the floor and my nightmare doesn't end
I have to wake up and do it all again passed out on the floor and my nightmare doesn't end
I have to wake up and do it all again WHERE THE FUCK are my friends?
We're going out tonight we'll bring this city to its knees
You wont make it out alive its time to get mine
Now we're laughing at you you think you have it all
Well now its mine I take it all.
