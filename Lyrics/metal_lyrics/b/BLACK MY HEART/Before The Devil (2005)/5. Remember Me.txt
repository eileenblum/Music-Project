You cant take it back for all the days I spent on the cold cold street
And the pinch that took your mind from me its fucking pay back
Broken I'm at a loss for words for what I could say
Spoken for every person I couldn't be when it al comes down
It's just a broken home a broken family
Tonights the night you go down (reckless) you made the choice of your life
(you'll fucking pay) the terrors of a new life
(in this world) will never know wont never know what its like
So think back you missed the world of compensation
Broken down clouds will ever understand
When I look back, I cant take away the pain so sit back
Hear what I have to say I didn't want this
You dug your grave and I just buried you broken I loss for words
For what you couldn't say spoken for every person you couldn't be
When it al comes down its just a broken home a broken family
Tonights the night you go down (reckless) you made the choice of your life
(you'll fucking pay) the terrors of a new life
(in this world) will never know wont never know what its like
To live if.
