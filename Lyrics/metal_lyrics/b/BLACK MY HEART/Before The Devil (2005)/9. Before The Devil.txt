Alive in my grave been thrown out by my life.
Been left behind by everything I love rot out my insides
And let the maggots eat away at everything I ever could had been
When we're all together it all goes away it feels so good
To have a home in you hey hey hey we don't have anything
Hey hey hey we live for memories hey hey hey so we'll live
The life we live and you cant stop me before the devil
Takes us from this place from my heart and everything I have
To die today with you would be such an honor
Every fight we made it through every time I needed you.
