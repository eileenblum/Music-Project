I ripped through the pages of your life and saw your face
Witting between the lines I watched you cry and saw your tears
Seep and hide behind the story of your life
You said you'd "die for me" the only words you ever really meant
Cuz now your dead (dead) to us dead to me. you knew who you were
From the start and time don't change with me your clock keeps ticking
Better hope your heart don't stop so lock your windows
Lock your doors, I'm coming to destroy YOUR everything YOUR FUCKED!
