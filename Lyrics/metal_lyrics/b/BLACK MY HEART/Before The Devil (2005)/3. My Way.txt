I think I might be beat I watch my blood hit the ground
It's only been one round beat down broken
You can break my bones but you'll never get a word outta me
My life my way this is me fight for your life
I am who I am and that all I can be
So don't fucking tell me I do what I do your not my judge
Fight for your life I am who I am and that all that I am
