Family means more to us we give it all to protect the ones we love
Loyalty means more to us we give our lives to protect
The ones we love as we right thick as blood
We did what we had to when we were starving we paid our dues
But we're still starving don't hesitate to count on me
You know I'm down for anything cuz we protect the ones we love.
I will stand beside you we'll always defend you in any situation
Your put in I will stand beside you we'll always defend you no matter what I wont give up
I have seen other people come and go all the same
Say that they are down for anything at anytime
But when the threat is in their face their ture colors always seem to show
These are my friends I have there their backs they are the
Closest thing to blood that I have
