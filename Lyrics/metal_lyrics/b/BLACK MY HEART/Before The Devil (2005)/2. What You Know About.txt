Take away everything I never had we'd all be the same
You live for lust, lust for greed to die in vain
Just like they did what you know about life anyway
Have you ever seen the hunger feed away
All I have its all I care its all I need
The world would take a life for a dime it didn't need
I'll never give up on you and everything we've been through
Our heart cold and left for dead your death wont be so fucking slow
I've tried to find a better way outta this life no going back
Your death wont be so fucking slow see the world through our eyes
As we do you'd hate you to so what's it gonna be
No, this is how its gonna be you better run 3 seconds till blood
3 2 1 none you had your chance and now your done
Take away everything I never had we'd all be the same
What you know about life anyway have you ever seen the hunger feed away
All I have its all I care its all I need
The world would take a life for a dime it didn't need
I'll never give up on you and everything we've been through
Our heart cold and left for dead your death wont be so fucking slow
I've tried to find a better way outta this life no going back
Your death wont be so fucking slow.
