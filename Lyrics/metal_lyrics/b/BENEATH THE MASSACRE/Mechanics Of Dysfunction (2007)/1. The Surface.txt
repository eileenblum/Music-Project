This is the sound of human waste. Worshipping the new leaders of destruction.
Spilling blood... No more: Pain nor hope. We don't care, the end is near.
It's falling down. This is life, this is pain. This is real, this is hell.
This path leads us nowhere yet we keep following.
This path leads us to what we always have feared.
This path leads us to this world's fatal destiny.
This is the path that'll end it all by tomorrow. The sound of human waste.
Can't you hear the voices of a thousand victim: The new world order makes no compromise.
Spilling blood... No more: Pain nor hope.
We don't care. The end is near. It's falling down. Breeding murder.
