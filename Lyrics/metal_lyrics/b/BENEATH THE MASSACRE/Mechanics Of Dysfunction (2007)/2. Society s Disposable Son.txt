The air is humid and the floorâs cold. Prisoner. Crime unknown. Prisoner.
Awaiting my sentence. Societyâs disposable son. Outcast. Grown apart.
Institutionalized since day one. Societyâs unwanted son.
Raised by emotionless TV screen, this is everyoneâs crime.
Go ahead pull the trigger if this is how you want it.
Anywhere but here is where I want to be right now.
I am the reflection of your mad world and system.
Anywhere but here is where I want to be right now.
Go ahead pull the trigger on your own creation.
When Iâll leave, Iâll watch you right in the eyes.
Societyâs disposable son. Outcast. Grown apart. The air is humid and the floor is cold.
Prisoner. Crime unknown. Sentenced, leaving with my eyes wide open
