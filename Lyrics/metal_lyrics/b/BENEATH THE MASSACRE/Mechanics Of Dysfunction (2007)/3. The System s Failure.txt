Wasting our lives digging our own grave. Greed lustâ¦
The plot is simple and we shall be ending it. You find your power in our weaknesses.
Essential just as pigs for butchers. Wasting our lives digging our own graves.
The system failed and weâre here to prove it now. We are the failure.
The systemâs failure. Donât try to save us. Weâll do this by our own.
This is our legacy, unachieved destiny.
