One more sleepless night. Cold sweat and nightmares waking me up.
Canât close my eyes on this. One more sleepless night. Cold sweat and nightmares waking me up.
Canât close my eyes on this world. Canât close my eyes.
Staying focused. Eyes open in a synthetic world. Sleepless. The everyday torment.
Eyes open in a synthetic world. Sleepless. The absence of meaning.
In a world that wonât see the error of our way. I canât help it: feeling empty.
One more sleepless night. Cold sweat and nightmares waking me up.
Canât close my eyes on this. One more sleepless night.
Cold sweat and nightmares waking me up. Canât close my eyes on this world. Wonât close my eyes.
