Honour is at stake. Slave is my name. Honour at stake. Modern age slavery.
Living each day as the last of an existence deprived of meaning. Forced fed mentality.
Imposed value system. To accept our condition is to perpetuate the crime.
Make my word. I shall be free. Breaking my chain with the strength of despair.
Hate is at a stage that words can no longer express and only violence seems to satisfy me.
Modern age slavery. Living each day as the last of an existence deprived of meaning.
Deprived of passion that we could have lived. We are dead inside.
A death dressed like life. We are dead inside. Honour is at stake. Slave is my name.
Honour at stake. Modern age slavery.
