Profit has no limits. The invisible hand, the icon, we now can put a face on it.
One day youâll feel the pain you perpetuated all your life.
Business based on sufferance. The blood, the blood, the tears the torture.
Your words can not be trusted anymore. The blood, the blood the tears the torture.
How do you manage to sleep at night? The stain of blood on your hands: you canât hide it all your life.
Your crime wonât go unpunished. Business based n sufferance.
The blood, the blood, the tears the torture. Your words can not be trusted anymore.
The blood, the blood, the tears the torture. Vengeance.
Payback. Your time will come. You canât run all your life. Smashing the invisible hand.
