Setting standards just to hear the sound of annihilation.
And I partake to this act of global suicide. Setting standards just to feel life collapse by itself.
And I take a last look at this land burned to the point of no return.
Standing aside all my life, silent witness of this world that I hate so much.
Dehumanised once for all. Apathy rules my life. Not much can touch me now.
Apathy rules my life. This world is what weâve made it:
This life is not worth the pain we must face everyday.
Wasting what is left, spiting my blood to the face of humanity.
Wasting what is left. I chose peace.
I chose my own death. Burning what is left. Spitting my blood at the face of humanity.
Burning what is left. I chose peace. I chose my own death.
This life has brought us pain. Pain has brought us hate. Hate led us to fear.
Fear has brought us death. This agony called life is coming to an end.
Stoicism in my veins. I embrace the end. This time thereâs no turning back.
Standing aside all my life, silent witness of this world that I hate so much.
Dehumanised once for all. Apathy rules my life, not much can touch me now.
Apathy rules my life. This world is what weâve made it: This means war.
