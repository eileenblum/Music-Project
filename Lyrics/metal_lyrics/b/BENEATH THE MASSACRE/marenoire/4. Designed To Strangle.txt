Morbid globetrotters
With invisible hands designed to strangle
Invisible hands designed to strangle
This is my fatalist vision
I hate to admit
Let it die.
Let it blow up in our face
We failed to prevail and now all there is...
Let it die.
The stench of death, across the earth
Global standardization of our ways to suffer
Breeding a new kind of soldier and consumer
"This is not enslavement, it's a great opportunity"
And human misery is not an obstacle
A profit at what cost?
Another death, another kill
The stench of death, across the earth
The stench of death, across the earth
Another death, another kill
"You were predisposed to accept this gift we're offering,
now don't pass up on this offer cause the market won't give you any second
chances."
This is my fatalist vision
I hate to admit
Let it die.
Let it blow up in our face
We failed to prevail and now all there is...
Let it die.
The stench of death, across the earth
We failed to prevail...
The stench of death, across the earth
Another death, another kill
