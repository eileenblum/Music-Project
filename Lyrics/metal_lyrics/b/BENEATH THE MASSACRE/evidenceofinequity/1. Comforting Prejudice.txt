Xenophobe visionary,
Spare me from your missionary speech.
Nothing but hate for your kind.
Your life spent on converting the flock.
Why should I have tolerance
When this word means nothing to you
And your books, holy books?
"Love and compassion" seems long forgotten
When it comes to your missionary act.
Fatal anachronism that will tear your all down.
Does rotting scare you that much?
Comforting thought of thinking all the same.
Is it going to make this all real?
Comforting thought of thinking all the same.
Live for yourself your spiritual life.
Does rotting scare you that much?
Imposing your reflection.
So narrow understanding.
Your beliefs are yours to keep.
Does rotting scare you that much?
