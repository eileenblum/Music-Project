Blinded by the shining light of the screen
This fake reality will soon be mine
As I look I just become more obedient to my master's will

Punctilious work has been done to win our attention

Dictatorship of thought through the media

The first class controlling the center of attention
Concentration of the sources is the key for a forces fed mentality
A pipeline crushed in you is slowly flooding your mind with this reality
At their convenience. Not only have I turned my back on the sheepherder
That once conditioned me but I as well left him to died and rot. Rot.
