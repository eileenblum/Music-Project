Dying on your pedestal, alone, aside from the rest of the world. A pedestal
they built for you. Your intentions remained intentions...
Your art is a product of mass consumption benefiting some through the sale of
plastic. Manufacturing a sound they can dance to.
The illusion of a rebellion and you play along. For the record; you're
useless. For the record; insignificant. Â For the record; you're futile.
For the record; you think you're special; you're not. you're nothing but a
commodity. Nothing. Â You think you wrote a page of history; it's false.
Your actions are based on selfishness. For the record you're useless. Â For the
record; you're insignificant. For the record, you're futile. Â For the
record; you think you're special; you're not. There is a thousand just like
you out there dying on your pedestal, alone, aside from the rest of the world.
A pedestal they built for you. Your intentions remained intentions and nothing
else. Nothing.
