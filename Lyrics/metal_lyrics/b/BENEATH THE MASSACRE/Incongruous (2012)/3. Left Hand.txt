It's a self-portrait
Painted with your blood
Revealing your darkest thoughts

Claiming yourselves to be the victims,
Victims that you are not

Empty feelings filling your empty shell
Of a self-centered existence
A distorted vision of your reality
A reality you deny
And each sunset brings a darker day
And people are all the same

Claiming yourselves to be the victims,
Victims that you are not

Erase all the lust
Break down all will
Glorified defeatist
Amputated left hand

Scared of what you might find?
Dig out what's deep inside
Sermons and false sympathy
This life suits you well

Empty feelings filling your empty shell
Of a self-centered existence
A distorted vision of your reality
A reality you deny
And each sunset brings a darker day
And people are all the same

Claiming yourselves to be the victims,
Victims that you are not

Scared of what you might find?
Dig out what's deep inside
Sterile and virgin
This death suits you well
