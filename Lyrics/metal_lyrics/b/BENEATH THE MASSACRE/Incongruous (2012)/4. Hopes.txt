And your hope will lead you nowhere. Cause your hope is an act of faith.
A faith in a fairy tale. A faith that serves them well.Â Primitive,
living under the fear of the unholy and demons. Human monstrosity.
From sheep. Righteous man, spreading fear among the herd of lose sheep
with mercantile interests. To Wolf. A romantic vision of your own demise.
From sheep to wolf. Selling a romantic vision of our own death.
Selling a false prophecy. And so we create this monster to our image. We can relate.
In order to forgive the unforgivable and perpetuate. Living under fear of
Armageddon. Bring ourselves to the limits.Â From sheep to wolf.
