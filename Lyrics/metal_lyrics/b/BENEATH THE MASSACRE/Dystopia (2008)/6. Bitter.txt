As failure becomes so imminent, broken, I walk away;
Was this all in vain?

We once had a dream... it's now dying
Helpless I assist, I assist to our utopia's end

All these years spent building this foundation...
Now trading hope for sorrow
What have we done?
All these years spend building...
Was this all in vain?

Never felt as lonely as in this crowd
All these empty eyes staring at me...
I won't make it through the night...
Won't make it without you...

Reach out for my hand and help me chase the taste of bitterness that fills my mouth
Let me hear your voice just like you used to...
I can take the pain when you're by my side
Don't let lust and greed have the best of you
Beaten, vanquished; is this how it ends? How it ends?

We once had a dream... it's now dying
Helpless I assist, I assist to our utopia's end
Helpless I assist, I assist to our utopia's end

As failure becomes so imminent, broken, I walk away;
Was this all in vain?
