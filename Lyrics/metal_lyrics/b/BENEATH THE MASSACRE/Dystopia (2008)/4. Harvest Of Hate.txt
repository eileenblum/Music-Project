And still, you venerate what has brought you down; kneeling for salvation
Still waiting for someone to save yourself from Hell

Still waiting for holy answers from a human mouth
And only pain you harvest
You harvest pain

Don't turn the other cheek to the man dressed in the white and covered in the people's blood

Still waiting for holy answers from a human mouth
And only pain you harvest
You harvest fears and hate, your daily prayer, your daily sin
Now you can die free of guilt, free of guilt...
