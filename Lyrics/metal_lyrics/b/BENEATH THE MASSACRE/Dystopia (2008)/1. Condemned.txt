Can you feel the anguish, the anguish taking over?
Thrown into this world with no essence
We are what we asked for;
Rapists and architects of decay and destruction

We claim our innocence...
We claim our innocence...

Can you feel the anguish?
Condemned to vile existence:
We have failed to make sense of all this
Struck down by the weight of the world
We now turn to an empty sky
Condemned to vile existence:
We have failed to make sense of all this
The irrelevance of life:
The anguish of our existence

The anguish is taking over
Thrown into this world with no essence;
Just an orphan creature in search of guidance
Guidance and acquittal

We claim our innocence...
We claim our innocence when we're the ones to blame
Just look deep inside: there is no will to change
We claim our innocence when we're the ones to blame

Thrown into this world with no essence
We are what we asked for;
Rapists and architects of decay and destruction

Condemned to vile existence:
We have failed to make sense of all this
Struck down by the weight of the world
We now turn to an empty sky
Condemned to vile existence:
We have failed to make sense of all this
The irrelevance of life:
The anguish of our existence
