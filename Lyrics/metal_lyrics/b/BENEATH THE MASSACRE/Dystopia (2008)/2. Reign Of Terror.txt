Witness my empowerment
Witness my rise and your fall; your fall

I can now hope for a tomorrow
A new horizon is opening before my eyes
Personal emancipation
Now free of past alienation
I can now hope for a tomorrow
A new horizon is opening before my eyes
Personal emancipation
Now free
Ending my suffering

Ending my suffering

These chains that held me back for years are now tight around your neck
And I laugh at your pain
As your face is turning blue
All these years I've been waiting for this moment to arrive and it feels better than I expected
I'm finally breaking free
These chains that held me back for years are now tight around your neck
And I laugh at your pain
As your face is turning blue
All these years I've been waiting for this moment to arrive and it feels better than I expected
I'm finally breaking free

Witness my rise and your fall

I can now hope for a tomorrow
A new horizon is opening before my eyes
Personal emancipation
Now free of past alienation
I can now hope for a tomorrow
A new horizon is opening before my eyes
Personal emancipation
Now free
Ending my suffering

Your reign of terror ends as mine begins
Your reign of terror ends as mine begins
Your reign of terror ends as mine begins
Your reign of terror ends as mine begins
