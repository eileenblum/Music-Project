When it's all been said and done
Our actions will speak for themselves

Industrial madness;
Apocalyptic vision created by men
This is the end, nothing is worthy to be saved
Mankind has finally reached the bottom
This is the end
Nothing is worth to be saved
Mankind washed away from the face of the earth
All these years ignoring the symptoms of our imminent extinction
We realized too late

We've been told, we've been warned yet we didn't listen
Now we must face the terrible consequences

Centuries of exploitation will take their toll on the earth
Centuries of exploitation will make it uninhabitable

Our actions will speak for themselves, when it's all been said and done
We created this living hell and now we must pay the price

Centuries of exploitation will take their toll on the earth
Centuries of exploitation will make it uninhabitable

All these years ignoring the symptoms of our imminent extinction
We realized too late

We've been told, we've been warned yet we didn't listen
Now we must face the terrible consequences

Our actions will speak for themselves, when it's all been said and done
We created this living hell and now we must pay the price

Light is now shutting for good
We crossed the point of no return
There's no more hope

Our actions will speak for themselves, when it's all been said and done
