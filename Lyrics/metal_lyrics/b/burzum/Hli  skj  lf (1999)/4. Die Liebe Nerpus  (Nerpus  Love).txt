Happy men and women follow a trail in the woods. The follow a
wagon led by a priest, towards a holy lake. Wonderful colours,
dancing happy people, the scene is nature's love. Dancing along
are the thralls, the sacrifice to Mother Earth, this sunny day,
dancing along towards a holy lake. Hail to Mother Earth, the
thralls are shouting. Hail and joy, before they are strangled and
lowered into the lake, happy and smiling, willingly giving their
lives to strengthen nature. Such is true love, and it's strength!
