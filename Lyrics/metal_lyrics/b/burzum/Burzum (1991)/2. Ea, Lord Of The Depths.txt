[November '91]

The Head is a Head of a Serpent
From its Nostrils Mucus Trickles...
The Ears Are those of a Basilisk
The Body is a Sun Fish, Full of Stars

AHHHHHHHH EA, LORD OF THE DEPTHS!

His Horns Are Twisted into three Curls
The Base of His Feet Are Claws
His Name Is Sassu Wunnu
A Sea Monster. A Form of Ea

AHHHHHHH EA, LORD OF THE.....DEPTHS!!!!!!
