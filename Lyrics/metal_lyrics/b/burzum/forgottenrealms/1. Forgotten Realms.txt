Dreams have swept me away.
Into a long forgotten realm.
Down into the depths of the Earth.
Into a hidden cavern.

Into the world below.
I walk into the forgotten past.
Â« Do not turn around ! Â»
Â« Never look back ! Â»

Fathers and mothers from ancient times.
Ghosts from a forgotten world.
With wonder they look upon me;
Â« What took you so long ? Â»

I wander not in darkness.
I am not lost, nor bewildered.
The path is not hidden.
The tracks are not old.

I was here a moment ago.
I am home.
I am home.
I am home.
