Numbered, once human
This is the downfall of a kind
Of followers
Perfused with programmed minds

And yet they are
Sharp-minded, no confusion
Struggling for resolution
Longing for retribution

No more belief in the
Stories they are told
Repeaters littered up their minds
Now clearing
The hypnosis exposed

And they will be
The force to detonate
The ones to liberate
The fall of your world state

They are the Nameless
Prepared to the utmost
Forced to the edge
To face you
Death squad, terror

Faceless, chainless, fearless
Nameless

Bare the teeth and fight
Those once in power
Payback for their acts so vile
Subdue the ones still hostile

And, yes, we are
The âterroristsâ you charmed
To the core we will be armed
Stout to get you harmed

They are the Nameless
Prepared to the utmost
Forced to the edge
To face you
Death squad, terror

Faceless, chainless, fearless
Nameless

"The atom bombs are piling up in the factories
The police are prowling through the cities
The lies are streaming from the loudspeakers
But the earth is still going round the sun."

They are the Nameless
Prepared to the utmost
Forced to the edge
Forced to overturn

The death squad
The terror
The faceless
The chainless
The fearless

Nameless
