Waking up to the dark
Don't know where the fuck you are
Or how you fucking got there

Try to turn the page
Find out what is next
When the curtain falls

You!
Did you ever feel so much fear,
Feel so much dread?
I'm the voice in your ear
âI want you dead!â

Do you know me? I don't know
Can you tell me before you go?
Just whisper into my ear
For your end is near

Wasted screams
Piercing through the night
Breaking down the silence
Can they be heard?
Forever remain unheard

Waking up to this dark
Don't know where the fuck I am
How did I fucking get here?

Tryin' to turn the page
Gonna read on what is next
When the curtain falls

No!
I never felt so much fear
Felt so much dread
I'm the voice in your ear
"I want you dead!"

Do you know me? I don't know
Can you tell me before you go?
Just whisper into my ear
For your end is near

Wasted screams
Piercing through the night
Breaking down the silence
Can they be heard?
Forever remain unheard

Wasted screams

Breaking down in agony
The pain has just begun
Try, my friend, not to resist
And soon you shall be gone

Voiced crying out in sorrow
Eyes will not face tomorrow

Do you know me? I don't know
Can you tell me before you go?
Just whisper into my ear
For your end is a wasted scream
Piercing through the night
Breaking down the silence
Can they be heard?
Forever remain unheard
