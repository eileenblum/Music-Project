Imprisoned crumbling humanity
Laments in every breath emerge
Death is certain, heretic
Demons invoked as night awakened

Forcedly registered biological
Property long sold to the bloodline gods
Genetically reversed mentally disturbed
Economic slaves â cradle to grave

Manufactured fear pushed insanity
Manifest and feed the reptilian breed
Rape and dominate the entire earth
Gracelessly involved â genetic war

Tritoxine â venom pumped into the skies
Tritoxine â through our bodies in disguise
Tritoxine â crush our brains and kill our nerves
Tritoxine â poisoning the earth

Imprisoned crumbling humanity
Laments in every breath emerge
Death is certain, heretic
Demons invoked and night... awake!

Hear the tortured ground's devastating mourn
Planet breaking free masters on their knees
Feel her blood arise for our last demise
Down the parasite plague â erased

Tritoxine â venom pumped into the skies
Tritoxine â through our bodies in disguise
Tritoxine â crush our brains and kill our nerves
Tritoxine â poisoning the earth
