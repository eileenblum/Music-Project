Feeding, treading
This path of destiny
Consciousness creating shifts

Masterplan initiated
Possibilities created

But knowledge erased

Through chaos and confusion
The systems will break down
Allowing rebirth
Of evolutionâs crown

Receiving new dimensions
Connecting vortexes
To be the universe
And all realities

Exploring dark realms
As part of wisdom
Not fearing the face of death

Communication with your past
Invigoration will last

The knowledge erased
And forced into sleep
Suppressing the keys

Through chaos and confusion
The systems will break down
Allowing rebirth
Of evolutionâs crown

Receiving new dimensions
Connected vortexes
To be the universe and all realities

(Open the gates) To new frequencies
(Open the gates) To level sustained
(Open the gates) The one key inside

Open the gate

The knowledge is there
Now awaken from sleep
Remember the key

Through chaos and confusion
The systems will break down
Allowing rebirth
Of evolutionâs crown

Receiving new dimensions
Connected vortexes
To be the universe
And all realities
