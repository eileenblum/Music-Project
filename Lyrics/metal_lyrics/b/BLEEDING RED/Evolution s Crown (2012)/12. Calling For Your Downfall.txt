Find myself in a world
That I could not hate more
See you all from the outside, watching
Feel how much I despise
And I'll make you feel
What I feel for you senseless beings

Calling for your downfall
Calling...

Now is the time for suffering
Now is the time for pain
As you fall into the abyss
Pushed by a soul fucking insane

Now is the time for payback
Ice running through my veins
As I scream even louder
Calling for your Downfall

I will not accept the lives that they live
Caught as slaves in a hopeless system
Liar! Betrayer! Victim!
Drowning in the sulphur of my demon call

Now is the time for suffering
Now is the time for pain
As you fall into the abyss
Pushed by a soul fucking insane
Now is the time for payback
Ice running through my veins
As I scream even louder
Calling for your Downfall

Find yourself in my world, could you hate me more?
See them all from the outside, watching
Feel how much I despise and make them feel
What we've got for them, senseless beings

Never we will accept the empty lives that they live
Caught as slaves in their hopeless system
They're liars, betrayers, victims
Drown them in the sulphur of our demon call
Liar! Betrayer! Victim!
Drown them in the sulphur of our demon call
- Fall!

Now feel this hell of suffering
Now feel this hell of pain
As you burn in the abyss
In the fire that I made
Unite the blood that's running
So cold through our veins
As we scream even louder
Calling for their Down-Fucking-Fall

Calling for your Downfall!

As their worst of demons
We will never be left behind
Or do you want to be drowned
And be deaf, and be blind?
For they are the mindless legion
As no spirit ever reaches their heads
They're deafened, they are blinded
They are dead!
