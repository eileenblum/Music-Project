So empty this path I walk
So lonely I'm wandering through the dark
Uncertain what's guiding me

Betrayed and left behind
No more deception I will find
Beyond these walls
Beyond the walls that I created

Beyond the mist I feel the light
Of black it is shining, shining bright
And I see without my eyes

Falling â losing control
Now moving further, reaching on
Will I find myself and be cured?
What will I find in you?

Goddess of Black
Captured my soul
For tonight I'm dying
Mistress of night
Pierced by the moon
A cold wind inside

Heavenly eyes
Blackened within
Your claws of the night
Tearing me apart
I've longed for your sin

Burning flesh
Showing me that I'm still alive
Your flames have kissed me â will I die?

Will we find this truth in horror
Like a thousand nights before

Goddess of Black
Captured my soul
For tonight I'm dying
Mistress of night
Pierced by the moon
A cold wind inside
