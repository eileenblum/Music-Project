Thoughtcrime

Measured by the system every detail on your face
You must fear the thought police
They're watching every place
Invisible chains unbreakable in my control
Now feel them break your body
Break your soul

Thoughtcrime

Absolute surveillance, I am everywhere
Total supervision, never know if I am there
Mental strays of opposition put violently back in line
Till each and everyone of you is mine

Tell me your deepest nightmares
Your inner struggles
I can make them reappear
Torture and isolation
Mind devastation
Until you're breaking down in fear

Thoughtcrime â a prison for your mind
Thoughtcrime â manifested by the blind
Thoughtcrime â real they'll never be
Thoughtcrime â all your thoughts belong to me

A prison for your mind
Manifested by the blind
Real they'll never be
All your thoughts belong to me

Tell me your deepest nightmares
Your inner struggles
I can make them reappear
Torture and isolation
Mind devastation
Until you're breaking down in fear

Thoughtcrime â a prison for your mind
Thoughtcrime â manifested by the blind
Thoughtcrime â real they'll never be
Thoughtcrime is Death
