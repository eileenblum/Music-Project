Mind Warfare â Thought Battle
The fight is on for your head
Dictators sold on my stage

Offering the puppets that receive all of your hate
I'm Terror, I'm safety
In the end, I'm the one to blame

Acting in secrecy
Revealed in tyranny
Behold the final step
For eternal slavery

I'm leading, intriguing
To make you fight each other
Dividing to make you hate
Keep you from uniting forces
Raging against my plague
World Savior, World Cancer
In the end everythingâs the same

Acting in secrecy
Revealed in tyranny
Behold the final step
For eternal slavery

Extinction, my secret is never to be revealed
Kneeling to the tyranny, the right to be killed
Last chance to free your mind as I am rising
Last step for domination because I'm dying

Enslaving, aeons prevailed
Invisible, unharmed
Your resistance failed

I'm the cancer in your head
I'm the poison in your flesh
Weakening deep inside, the
UNMASTER

I'm the cancer in your head
I'm the poison in your flesh
Burning deep inside me
UNMASTER

Acting in secrecy
Revealed in tyranny
Behold the final step
For eternal slavery
