Something's wrong in this fucked up world
It's a world built upon lies
With the truth staying in the shadows
For your ratings they're the price

Without reflection people believe
Just what they see
It's the end of knowledge, no more arts
In their minds nothing but TV

Sadistic killers hunting you down
Hypnotizing society
Your blood will keep them watching
As worth of life finally deceased

Information, a thing of the past
Valuable tonight's your death
You're the Running Man
Time for your last breath

Come On!
Yeah, you're the Running Man â prepare!

âShowtime!â
Prepare to be sent deep down below
For they can't wait to see you running
Now it's the time to start the show

There is no choice
Now you're running for your life
You're the Running Man
Kill them in the final strive

Subzero, Buzzsaw
Assassins for their god

Fireball, Dynamo
Servants to your law

Watching the fight go down in fire
Struggling for air as the flames grow higher

Something's wrong in your fucked up life
An existence built on lies
With the truth staying in the shadows
For your ratings I am the price

Without reflection people believe
Just what they see
It's the end of my life? Want my death?
Time for your last breath!

You're the Running Man â prepare!

âShowtime!â
Prepare to be sent deep down below
For they can't wait to see you running
Now it's the time to start the show

This is my choice
Now fighting for my life
I'm the Running Man
Kill you in my final strive
