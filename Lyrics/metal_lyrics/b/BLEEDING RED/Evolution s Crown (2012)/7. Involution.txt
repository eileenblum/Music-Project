Chained and tightly fixed
Into the cave that builds our world
For our life our view has been directed
Gazing at shadows unquestioned

Turn my back to the shadows
Bursting fires blinding me
Feel the source of the shadows
That have been my reality

From all that we perceived
We've formed reality
Wisdom, ethos, honors and success
Listening to echoes distorted

Turn my back to the shadows
Bursting fires blinding me
Feel the source of the shadows
That have been my reality

Rid myself from the shades so I can see

And driven by my longings
I crawl outside to see
My senses still avoiding
What was awaiting me
For by the truth my eyes are blinded
As I struggle on my knees

But I decide to take the path
And change my point of view
Train my perception
By creating something new
And sleep no more

Back into the cave, setting of past life
Wise with open eyes, used to light

To the captured ones, extended views absurd
âBaiter, paranoid, who came back blindâ

Turn my back to the shadows
Bursting fires blinding me
Feel the source of the shadows
That have been my reality

Rid myself from the shades so I can see
Rid myself of the chains inside me
