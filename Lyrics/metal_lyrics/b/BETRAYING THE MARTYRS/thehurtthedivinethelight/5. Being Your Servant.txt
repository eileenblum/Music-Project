The Lord said to Abram
Leave your country, your people
Your fatherâs household
And go to the land I will show you

He will make you into a great nation
He will bless you and make your name so great
How your hands can make a sign
And wash the sins off your message ?
People follow the laws and curses of believer
Being your servant is an honor my God but can your hear ?

The screams of our heart
Just let them follow their way

Travelling through the land
As far as the site of that great Tree
I built an altar there
To the Lord who appeared to me

And I say : I will follow your way
Leave them to go away
I promise to stay, my Lord
And I say : I will follow your way
Leave them to go away
I promise to stay, my Lord

I say : I will follow your way
Leave them to go away
I promise to stay, my Lord

My Lord

Travelling to this land so far
What have you done to me
