Out of Egypt !

To the Negev with his wife and everything he had
People destroyed by their past had first built an altar
Moving for your dreams and went straight to that place
Where the Voice appeared to him
There Abram called on the name of Lord

Now Lot who was moving about with Abram
Also became wealthy and waited for more

And now you run away (you run away)
Avoid our face to face (our face to...)
Youâll go right, I will go left
To earn my land

Lift up your eyes from where you are and look around you
That land you see I will give to you
I pledge a tide of smiles forever

And now, that land you see
You walk across the eyes of God (the eyes of God)

And now...

Now Lot who was moving about with Abram
Also became wealthy and waited for more

And now you run away (you run away)
Avoid our face to face (our face to...)
Youâll go right, I will go left
To earn my land

Lift up your eyes from where you are and look around you
That land you see I will give to you
I pledge a tide of smiles forever

Abram moved his heart and went to live near the tree
Where he built an altar to praise the love of God

He walked across the eyes of Lord where the Voice appeared to him :
God !
