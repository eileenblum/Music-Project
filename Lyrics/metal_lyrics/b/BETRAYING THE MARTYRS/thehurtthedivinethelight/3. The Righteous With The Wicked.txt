When the men stood up and left
The lloked down toward Sodom
Abraham walked among them to see them in their way
Shall I hide from him ?
What am I supposed to do ?
I pray / Become the father of all nations

This is my way, God
All nations on earth will be blessed through Him
Be this way, for Him, be right and just
And the Lord will bring all the light on their way

Then the Lord said "son"
Will kill the righteous with the wicked ?
Then the Lord screamed "son"
And tell me why would you do such a thing ?

Abraham,
All nations on earth will be blessed through you
Abraham,
With you hand you'll bless a new land

If not, I will know
Can't you hear the voice of my Lord
When He swears to give us a chance ?
Can't you hear the voice from the sinner
When he asks to be blessed through the sky ?

What if there were fifty righteous people in this city ?
Would You sweep them away and didn't spare this place for sake ?

Show me what is right and just, show me peace through your eyes
Could I pray for them and forgive all their sins ?

Then the Lord said "son"
Will kill the righteous with the wicked ?
Then the Lord screamed "son"
And tell me why would you do such a thing ?

This is my way, God
All nations on earth will be blessed through Him
Be this way, for Him, be right and just
And the Lord will bring all the light on their way

God walk through the land
Go breath of the land
This promised earth
I will give it to you

And God has said :
"If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom
I will spare the whole place for their sake"
