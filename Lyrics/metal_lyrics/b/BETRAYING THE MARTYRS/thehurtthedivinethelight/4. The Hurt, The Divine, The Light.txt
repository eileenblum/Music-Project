Abraham ! Here I am
Take your son Isaac to the mountain
Abraham ! Here I am
Bring the sacrifice asked in Moriah

He had cut enough wood for the sacrifice
On the third day Abraham looked up and saw
Where Isaac was supposed to die

Speak up and say where are the offering
He listened up and asked for : is it for love or a sacrifice
God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering
Then he reached out his hand and took a knife to slay his son

On the Lordâs mountain it will be provided
I wear by myself declared the Lord
Through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed
And I will surely bless your son

Abraham ! Here I am
Take your son Isaac to the mountain
Abraham ! Here I am
Bring the sacrifice asked in Moriah

Then Abraham returned to his servants
Then set off together for Beersheba

Youâve obeyed me
You offered me your son
And now I swear I will surely bless you
You have not withheld your son
I will surely bless you
