The Lord appeared to Abram
Under the tree of Mamree
Do not be afraid, I'm your shield

"O sovereign Lord"
You have given me no children
Until my corpse and my name will be forgotten

Lord, my reward is just my estate
If indeed you, you can count them and my son will be the servant from my household
Beneath the sky through the eyes of the slaves

When no one cared for us, only your hands could protect our dreams
My descendants will be enslaved by your fault
As the light fades, darkness comes over him
However let your father go in peace
Near the river God protects your offspring
There are no tears in this nation

When the sun has set and my prayers are burning
A smoking and blazing torch appears, passed between the pieces

As the lights burn in the sky,
A star, a child
When the sun had set and died,
You prayed for this night

The Lord appeared to Abram,
Under the tree of Mamree
Do not be afraid I'm your shield

"O sovereign Lord",
You have given me no children
"O sovereign Lord"
Until my name be forgotten
Beneath the sky
There are no tears in this nation
