Constructing a picture with both eyes shut blind
Working for an imagery, my mind hasn't found
Please help me fix this

Piece by piece by piece
Help me cover this
I cannot paint this alone...alone

Piece by piece by...

A piece to fill 
What's just now came to exist
I'm building with no blueprint
Please help me to cover this

We lay the pieces our own way
We sail with wind behind us and chase the sun away
We lay the pieces our own way
We sail with wind behind us...behind us.

This world will never be enough

I crave for something more
Something to overcome

As I try 
To build my home
I'm too blind to see
A vision of my destiny

Odd pieces of a story
And unpredictable game with a beautiful end
This life may drive you crazy
Put out a piece and hope that it's right

We lay the pieces our own way
We sail with wind behind us and chase the sun away
We lay the pieces our own way
We sail with wind behind us...behind us.

I have a box in my hand
No instructions
I'm just doing the best I can

I have a box in my hand
We hold this life in our hands

I have a box in my hand
This life has no instructions
We hold this life in our hands

I have a box in my hand
We hold this life in our hands
