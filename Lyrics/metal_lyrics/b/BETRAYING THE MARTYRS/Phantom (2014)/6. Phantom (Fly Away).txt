[feat. Gus Farias]Are you watching the rain pound
On a road you where you don't want to be ?
Are you walking a path that leads to a dead life ?
Are you staring out the window
Onto a town that broke you down ?
Killing every minute with a blunt edged knife ?!

My foot follows the other - it feels just like I'm walking
My mouth moves up and down, no one hears me talking
Birth brought me to this wasted place
One day I will fly away

I will fly away

I'm not looking back
I'll never ever, ever see this place again

Pick me up and carry me away
I'll never look back - won't waste another of my days here 
So carry me away

I'll never see this place again

My foot follows the other - it feels just like I'm walking
My mouth moves up and down, no one hears me talking
Birth brought me to this wasted place

Birth brought me to this waste place
One day I'll escape this place

Pick me up and carry me away
I'll never look back - won't waste another of my days here
So carry me away
