He holds his heart on his sleeve, so take it
He holds a power that you wouldn't believe
You see a smile 'cause he fakes it
You're bind, but he'll open your eyes !

One day they will pay ! 
One day they will break !

Now he's had enough
He's not walking away

That's it, just turn your back, 'cause I'm not scared anymore
I'll watch you walk away

Walk away, just turn your back ; walk away
I will be smiling when (I watch you) walk away
I'm never coming back

You'll never see me again - never again

He wears a bag on his shoulders
Accompanied by the weight of the world
He screams out, "Please come take my hand"

One day they will pay !
One day they will break ! 
Nothing will save you

That's it, just turn your back, 'cause I'm not scared anymore
I'll watch you walk away

Walk away, just turn your back, walk away
I will be smiling when (I watch you) walk away
You'll never seen me again
