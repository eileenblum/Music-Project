You screamed inspiration into my lungs
Whilst I dreamed to do what you had done
A shadow beneath you, just hopeful son

Hopeful son, just a shadow beneath you

Every dream I had dreamt, every step I will take,
For you I'll keep on screaming, 'til your cold hearts wake
For now it's you, the one who's dreaming
And we scream along with you

Those who truly live will never die
The memories you left us will keep you alive

In peace but still dreaming, in silence yet still screaming
Laid to rest in your eternal nest, just dreaming

Eternal flames burn bright tonight, the brightest was a part of you
A broken heart built by the hands of her hero, the hands of her hero

Hopeful son, just a shadow beneath you

Every dream I had dreamt, every step I will take,
For you I'll keep on screaming, 'til your cold hearts wake
For now it's you, the one who's dreaming
And we scream along with you

Those who truly live will never die
The memories you left us will keep you alive

You once said, "You only live once,"
But you will live forever
Yes you will live forever
Because legends never die
