We will reach the edge as one
Our eyes are closed shut tight
Tell me what could this become
We search until we find the light

We will reach the edge as one
Our eyes are closed shut tight
Tell me what could this become
We search until we find the light

My eyes are throwing out reaching for the edge
Never have they laid amongst such death
I feel the death within this passage it runs
Burning my senses overwhelming my heart
We search for where the world ends
What could this become
What could this become

We will reach the edge as one
Our eyes are closed shut tight
Tell me what could this become
We search until we find the light

I'll keep on dreaming
In this world even if I'm alone
Even if I'm alone
I'll keep on dreaming even if I am alone

My reflection is vivid in the haze of a ghost
The edge is unreachable

But we will get there as one
We can get there as one
We can reach it all

I gotta open my mind
Pull and push at the sides
How can I take this in
Un-comprehensible life

I gotta open these eyes
Stretch them out from the inside
Un-comprehensible life!

We will reach the edge as one
Our eyes are closed shut tight
Tell me what could this become
We search until we find the light

We search for where the world ends
What could this become
What could this become

I'll keep living my life
And you keep killing your dreams

Go paint your dreams one by one
Go paint them black
Go paint your dreams black
