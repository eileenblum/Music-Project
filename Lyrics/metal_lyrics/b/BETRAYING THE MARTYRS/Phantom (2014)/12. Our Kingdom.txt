Hold my hand !
We will get through this, you can't do this alone
This road for us is getting longer and longer
The stars of which we dreamed burn bright above our heads
I know you're hurting now, I know you're hurting
So hold my hand

I will put you back down, where you belong
We started this together and we'll finish as one

Empty worthless I stood alone

As a family we all stand
Look into my eyes give me your hand
I'll pick you up whenever you're down
When you're down

Watch as I stand proud, because I do this for you

You feel from the skies, washed the alt from my brow
You nourished the ground now a foundation
For my home

As a family we all stand
Look into my eyes give me your hand
I'll pick you up whenever you're down
When you're down
