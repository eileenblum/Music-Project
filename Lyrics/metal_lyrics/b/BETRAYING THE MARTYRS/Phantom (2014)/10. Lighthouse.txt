My life was falling through the holes I'd cut behind me
You caught it fall, you love me despite me
Falling through the holes I'd cut behind me
You caught it all, you love me despite me

Touch the surface, open me up

It's an ugly truth that I keep inside
Skeletons and demons I have struggled to hide
Now there's a mirror that I hold with me, that I hold close
My reflections, a portrayal - the only beauty I have inside

You lit me up, stood me me tall
I'll be your lighthouse and shine for you
I'll stand tall, eyes open wide
I'll be your lighthouse - watch out for you

When I'm falling down and I'm falling apart
It's you that picks me up and pumps blood to my heart
You sew the patches that keep me together !

My life was falling, falling apart
Falling, falling apart

You lit me up, stood me me tall
I'll be your lighthouse and shine for you
I'll stand tall, eyes open wide
I'll be your lighthouse - watch out for you
