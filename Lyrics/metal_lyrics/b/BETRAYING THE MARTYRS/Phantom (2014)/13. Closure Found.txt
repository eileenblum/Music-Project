We could have swam to the shore with you clung tight
You could be dry whilst I drowned in my lies
Yet you're drowning all alone right beneath me
I'm dancing circles round and round in the skies !

I'm wasting away in this fire of what it
Love is a word, love is a myth
Crossed out in the sand by your vain and faithless hands !

Vain and faithless hands

So I'll watch you run away, search for what you think is life
Closing your eyes, and rolling the dice
Digging up bodies of what we once lived
You bathed in my shadow
Now this is your gift

I love to watch you throw your morals down the drain
Life's game is beautiful, and I know just how to play

Which brings me to you ! How can I even begin ?!
You want what's mine, and you crave what I've got
Friendship is a word that you must have forgot
But now the line's been crossed and the knife's in my back
And my life's getting lived
And you're just making me laugh

I love to watch you throw your morals down the drain
Life's game is beautiful, and I know just how to play

I will watch you fall ! I'll watch you fall !

I'm climbing higher than you can see, I feel your breath on my neck
I feel you pulling at knees
But my head don't look down - my brows don't frown
My mind sees sunshine above these clouds
I'm on the other side, I'm laughing at you
From the other side, I'm living my life
I'm laughing at you !
