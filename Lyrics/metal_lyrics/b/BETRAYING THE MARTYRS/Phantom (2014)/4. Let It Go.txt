[originally by Idina Menzel]The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like Iâm the king
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldnât keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Donât let them in, donât let them see
Be the good boy you always have to be
Conceal, donât feel, donât let them know
Well now they know

Let it go, let it go
Canât hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I donât care what theyâre going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway.

Itâs funny how some distance
Makes everything seems small
And the fears that once controlled me
Canât get to me at all

Up here in the cold thin air I finally can breathe
I know Iâve left a life behind but Iâm too relieved to grieve!

Itâs time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me,
Iâm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go,
Youâll never see me cry
Here I stand and here Iâll stay
Let the storm rage onâ¦

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Iâm never going back
The past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
And Iâll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect boy is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway!
