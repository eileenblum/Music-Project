For the unspoken, those without a name, living as links in a broken chain, we all die but some
Will go forgotten, and we're all to blame
Colours in a black and white system, fighting for the right to exist, just numbers with a price
On their heads, living on society's blacklist

Block out the sun, sweep the dirt under the rug, throwing shadows burning bridges between us

There's a fire in the earth that we need to cross
But they're burning down the bridges between us
Lock your fingers with mine, let our hearts beat in time
Build bridges within us

Colours in a white system, ticks just shy of the box
Falling short of criteria, and left to rot on the rocks
You only listen when money's involved
Bottom feeder
Who the fuck are you? To put a life in your dirty hands
Dirty bastards! What?!

Block out the sun, sweep the dirt under the rug, throwing shadows burning bridges between us

There's a fire in the earth that we need to cross
But they're burning down the bridges between us
Lock your fingers with mine, let our hearts beat in time
Build bridges within us

You're a thief I can see it in your eyes, you're the vultures that circle the skies
With a pocket full of money and a mouth full of shit, your hands are full of dirt and our
People's blood drips. Could you look them in their eyes? Measure their worth?
It's you, the fucking parasite of this earth!
You're just an animal
Insects!
Pest control!

For the unspoken, those without a name, living as links in a broken chain, we all die but some
Will go forgotten, and we're all to blame
Colours in a black and white system, fighting for the right to exist, just numbers with a price
On their heads, living on society's blacklist

There's a fire in the earth that we need to cross
But they're burning down the bridges between us
Lock your fingers with mine, let our hearts beat in time
Build bridges within us
