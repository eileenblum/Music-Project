Behind the glass
Hiding from our transparent pasts
It's time to shatter this pane

It's time to walk together
Greedy
Selfish human nature
Killing our brothers
We're fucking killing ourselves
Our burning brothers
How can you live with yourselves?

If we can't see them, they can't see us
If we don't save them, then who will save us?

We all know that blood is on the horizon
The sun burns red tonight
We all crawl, we duck and hide
From the blood and the lies
Time to shatter this glass

We're all covered from the flames of this world
But we're buried in smoke
Choke

Keep your fucking hands over your eyes and your ears
Just know that nothing disappears

Killing our brothers
We're fucking killing ourselves
Our burning brothers
How can you live with yourselves?

If we can't see them, they can't see us
If we don't save them, then who will save us?

We all know that blood is on the horizon
The sun burns red tonight
We all crawl, we duck and hide
From the blood and the lies
Time to shatter this glass

We're all covered from the flames of this world
But we're buried in smoke
Choke
