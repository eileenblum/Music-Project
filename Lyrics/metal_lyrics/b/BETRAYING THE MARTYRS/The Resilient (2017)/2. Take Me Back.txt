Take me back to when I still felt young
Take me back to when this all begun

No I never ever understood and I never ever even tried
I've always felt so far from all that shit
Always been blinded by my precious pride
Crawling, falling

On my hands and knees at the feet of the death gods
Never thought it would be me to trip and fall â never felt like I was falling at all
Never thought it would happen to me â never thought this would happen to me
Until I ate the floor at the rock bottom looked up to see them laughing
At the scratches that I'd left on the wall

Take me back to when I still felt young
When I still had light in my eyes and a sweetness on my tongue
Take me back to when this all begun
When the fire still burned in my eyes, before it all went wrong

I never knew
Never thought this would ever be me â but then I pulled my head out the sand
Never thought I would ever be free â saw in the mirror an excuse of a man
Never thought this would ever be me â accepted help and accepted myself
Never thought I would ever be free
Put my feet on the ground and took my heart off the shelf

I needed help
Running circles in my mind
Tossing and turning in my bed
I've lost my fucking hair and I'm losing my head

Take me back to when I still felt young
When I still had light in my eyes and a sweetness on my tongue
Take me back to when this all begun
When the fire still burned in my eyes, before it all went wrong

Crawling, falling
Just when I thought my life had fallen through the cracks
I saw the light, now I'm alive
No longer screaming

Take me back to before this all went wrong
See the fire in my eyes â a reflection of the sun
Now I'm back before this all went wrong
See the fire in my eyes â a reflection of the sun
