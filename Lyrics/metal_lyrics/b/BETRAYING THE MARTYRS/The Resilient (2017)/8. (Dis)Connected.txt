I can't hear you when you speak with your fingers and thumbs
You're dying to show us just how fake you have become
So let me ask you kid, are you feeling alive?
This is the end so come with me
Come with me â let's pretend

We've bred a bent-backed race bent on hiding the truth
Degenerated, separated, brain-dead youth
So let me ask you â who are you â do you feel alive
Tell me do you feel alive

We've never been so connected â never felt so alone
So many friends yet we stand on our own
Never felt so neglected
How can we speak at all with our mouths sewn shut?

We are the walking fucking dead

Let's look at life through real eyes
Let's look at what we've become
Brain-dead army of robotical sons
Now a brain-dead army of robotic sons

Are you worthless â are you dead or alive?
Put it online, let the numbers decide
Your heart beats â you're walking
Talking and breathing
But you're dead inside

So let me ask you again, are you feeling alive?
Generation of the walking dead
Dead inside

I can't hear you when you speak with your fingers and thumbs
You're dying to show us just how fake you have become
Do you feel alive?

We've never been so connected â never felt so alone
So many friends yet we stand on our own
Never felt so neglected
How can we speak at all with our mouths sewn shut?

We have all become a brain-dead army of robotical sons
