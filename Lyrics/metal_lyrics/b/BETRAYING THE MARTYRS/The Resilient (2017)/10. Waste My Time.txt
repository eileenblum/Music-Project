What do you love? What are you fighting for?
What makes you stand out?
Be a wolf in a pack and not a sheep dressed in black
Step up out of the comfort zone before your time runs out
Better open your mouth and let the world know you're ready
So buckle up
'Cause shit's about to go down

Full speed ahead â no chance â you ain't stopping me
Full speed ahead â just watch â I'll get where I want to be

Your life is slowly leaking out through the cracks
I won't be left to die by the sides of the deaf and blind
I won't be another waste of space
So please don't waste my time

You're going nowhere
So point your finger in another direction
I'm going one way
Straight to my goals
Straight for the action

You're going nowhere

You're going nowhere fast
So get the fuck off my back with all your questions
You're a waste of space
Your body's a deadweight
Won't be me stuck at the gates

Full speed ahead â no chance â you ain't stopping me
Full speed ahead â just watch â I'll get where I want to be

Your life is slowly leaking out through the cracks
I won't be left to die by the sides of the deaf and blind
I won't be another waste of space
So please don't waste my time

Don't waste my time!
