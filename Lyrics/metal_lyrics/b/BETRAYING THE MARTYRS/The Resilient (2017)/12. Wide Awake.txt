Go harder

Can't stop, won't stop

We have felt the coldness
Felt the aches deep down in our bones
The highest wall couldn't hold us
Time to let them all know

We go harder, ain't no stopping us now
Forever grinding, burning wheels to the ground

We have had our souls laid out on the line
Been at the bottom now we climb, 'cause it's our time
It's not over yet as long as blood is in our veins
It's not over yet

The road will never end
We chase the sun, so it never sets
Neither one of us is getting younger
So we ride it out, never felt any stronger

Forty days, forty nights for the good and the grey
This is what we live for, what we live for
Won't eat, can't sleep, we live our dreams wide awake
And hope it never ends
We chase the sun
This is what we live for, what we live for
Forty days, forty nights we live our dreams wide awake

We go harder

Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop

We've had our souls laid out on the line
Been at the bottom now we climb, 'cause it's our time
It's not over yet as long as blood is in our veins
It's not over yet, no it's not over yet

I do this to lose my mind
I do this to lose my mind
Like I do this to lose my mind
And leave my dark past behind

Forty days, forty nights for the good and the grey
This is what we live for, what we live for
Won't eat, can't sleep, we live our dreams wide awake
And hope it never ends
We chase the sun
This is what we live for, what we live for
Forty days, forty nights we live our dreams wide awake

We go harder

Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
