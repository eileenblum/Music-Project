Push right back against the weight of this world
No kneeling down, no bending backwards
Only standing to fight
Been told we're wrong for way too long
The storm is coming but we're strong enough to hold on

Should we feel scared by all of this
Or feel prtoected, not neglected and cold
Should we be sitting with our mouths shut
Or be screaming as we stand up

Won't back down
We won't back down
We stay united as one and forever
No we won't back down
We won't back down
You ain't so clever when we stand together

You'll fall into the landfill
No one left to throw the rope
You'll be burning in the flames of your selfish hatred
As the innocent burn

Won't be scared by any of this
We're united and our tower stands tall
Won't be sitting with our mouths shut
Hear us screaming as we stand up singing

Won't back down
We won't back down
We stay united as one and forever
No we won't back down
We won't back down
You ain't so clever when we stand together

The world sings loud by our side
We stand taller than ever now
The colours that make us who we are
No one can wash them away

United as a force holding hands with no remorse
As our hearts grow stronger we'll be victims no longer
Have your voice heard
Stand up tall, spit fire on their empire
Hear us scream these words

Won't back down
We won't back down
We stay united as one and forever
No we won't back down
We won't back down
You ain't so clever when we stand together
