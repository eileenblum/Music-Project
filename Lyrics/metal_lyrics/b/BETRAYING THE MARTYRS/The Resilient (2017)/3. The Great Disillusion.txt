How could I have been so fucking blind?!

Look out, look out, look by your side - sometimes the devil wears a pretty disguise
So reach out, cry out, open my eyes - show me my future before I kiss it goodbye

[Chorus:]
And you told me we could fly (so I hold on)
And once again, once again I leave it all behind
You told me we could swim (so I climbed so high)
Up to a mountain for you, I closed my eyes, and I took the dive

How can I make up for all this lost time?!

The scent of home sweet home now bears the bitterest smell
And the land I was meant to love feels like a short stay in hell, feels like a short stay in hell
Itâs time to let go

[Chorus:]
You told me we could fly (so I hold on)
And once again, once again I leave it all behind
You told me we could swim (so I climbed so high)
Up to a mountain for you, I closed my eyes, and I took the dive

How can I make up for all this fucking lost time?
That Iâll never ever get back 25 to life
I thank you for, thanks for wasting my time, time Iâll never ever, ever ever get back!

How could I have been so fucking blind?!

[Chorus:]
You told me we could fly (so I hold on)
And once again, once again I leave it all behind
You told me we could swim (so I climbed so high)
Up to a mountain for you, I closed my eyes, and I took the dive

â¦and I took the dive

[Chorus:]
You told me we could fly (so I hold on)
And once again, once again I leave it all behind
You told me we could swim (so I climbed so high)
Up to a mountain for you, I closed my eyes

I been so fucking blind!
