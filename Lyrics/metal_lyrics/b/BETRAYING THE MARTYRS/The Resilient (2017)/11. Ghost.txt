Your silhouette is fading from this portrait
Your branch has fallen from the family tree
So I wish you the loneliest of funerals
I'll hace mt back turned
Since you turned your back on me

Burn

It's time for me to lay this out for all to see
To lift the blinds you hide behind
Strip your body of your disguise
It's your turn to bleed
Like a pig hanging from your feet
I've heard your lies
You've seen me cry
I'll move on and you'll be left behind

You'll always be a ghost to me
I swear we'll be even one day
You'll be nothing but a ghost to me
Won't see no pain in my eyes
To me you're dead inside
Now I see you'll never mean anything to me
I've got just one thing to say
I swear we'll be even one day

I'm cutting the chord
Pulling the leeches from my skin
I'm wiping myself of all the shit you left me in
When you're hanging from my heels
When you're running out of breath
I'll kick your fucking fingers
And watch you falling to your death

Bloodsucker

You'll always be a ghost to me
I swear we'll be even one day
You'll be nothing but a ghost to me
Won't see no pain in my eyes
To me you're dead inside
Now I see you'll never mean anything to me
I've got just one thing to say
I swear we'll be even one day
