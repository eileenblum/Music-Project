I hear a voice that calls my name over the hills â drives me insane
The world is yours to see, so come discover me

There are people amongst us who are dying inside
Gliding with a smile without reason to stay alive
Without reason to stay alive

Now searching for death â that they've already found
They're all dying to live, but just not knowing how
Suited up, walking to their own deathbeds
Seas of empty souls, seas of hanging heads
I wish I could wake them up

I hear a voice that calls my name over the hills â drives me insane
The world is yours to see, so come discover me

They are others who need to feel this hole inside
Searching for a purpose and reason to stay alive
Just one reason to stay alive

I feel pain in my heart
I wish I could wake them up

Please wake up

I hear a voice that calls my name over the hills â drives me insane
The world is yours to see, so come discover me

It hurts to watch them bleed
As they drain themselves for what they don't need

Murder
Mother

Happiness is not found on your doorstep
Prosperity don't live down the street
You weren't born with coordinates on your face
Nor with ten ton weights on your feet
