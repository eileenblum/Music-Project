When youâre alone!
Are you scared!

When youâre alone, scared, screaming for help
At your end we know just where you will turn?
To whom does your mind try to speak?

What do you do when you feel all alone?
To whom does your mind try to speak?
There is nowhere to turn no help to be found
Youâll believe and youâll believe it believes in you

Your life flows on by
Ridding you with guilt for your sins
But for who?
Who are you afraid?

You say thereâs nothing as you cower with remorse
You say thereâs nothing as you whisper amongst your 
walls

Apologize for the theft of life
If you really didnât care we would all run amok
Apologize for the theft of life
If you didnât care we would all run amok

Tearing building, tearing lives, tearing ourselves 
apart
But you, you are petrified!

If itâs only you in this world in which you see
Then believe in yourself be your own guide in life
We are the puppeteers of our own existence
No excuses for the things weâve done in vain

To whom does your mind try to speak?

Step by step, left, right, left
Treasure this life with every breath, you only get one
Step by step, left, right, left
Treasure this life with every breath
So come on, deserve it!

No excuse for the things youâve done
Others they wonât accept your lies
We can be guided but the paths
We choose are made by us all

No excuse, for the things, we have done
Others they wonât accept your lies

Youâre petrified!
