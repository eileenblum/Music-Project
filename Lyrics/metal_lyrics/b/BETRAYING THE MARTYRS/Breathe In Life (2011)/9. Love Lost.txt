Wash this blood from my hands
Today was the day that i slain a man, his name was love and i loved him more
than anything.
Forgive me father for i have sinned, forgive me my lost love, for i will never
forgive myself.

My mind is both plagued and blessed by thoughts of your death, I rid myself of
this possession my selfish sword of which i cut you with cut you deep cut you
down

Love Lost, you find that one, and you'll lose it all not for a night of fun,
but a night of regret now watch her run, watch her run

I KNOW I WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF,MY LOVE,MY LIFE,IS LOST FOREVER.

I constructed a path for you to walk away, built by hands of a lie with bricks
of shame,since the first one was laid there was no turning back, a
construction of destruction, i am my own demise.

I AM MY OWN DEMISE .

Today was the day that i slain a man, he was my heart, i have killed myself.Wash this
blood from my hands.There was never an option, i received what i deserved !
