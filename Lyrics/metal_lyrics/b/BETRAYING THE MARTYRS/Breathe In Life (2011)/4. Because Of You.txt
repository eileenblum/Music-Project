I'm in a world of pain, (a wold of pain)
Laying in a dark cold cell (a dark cold cell)
I am crying, begging for more, (I want more)
More than nothing

You said you were such a good friend,
So get this pain out of my head
You said me that you would help me
And I did what you said

You said that we were friends
So get this pain (out of my head)
There is no escape
I know that I can change
Take it away
Turning it all grey

Please, no more pain, please, no more pain
All my blood is boiling
Please, no more pain, please, no more pain
My body is burning

I feel like every bones I own are going to break
I'd do, whatever it takes
I feel like my bones are going to break
I would do whatever it takes
Please help me

Definitely want it more than anything
Definitely want it more than anything

You said that we were friends
So get this pain (out of my head)
There is no escape
I know that I can change
Take it away
Turning it all grey

But now it's done
I may lie, I may cry
It doesn't matter, I'm free now
I'm free to smile, I'm free now
I'm free for once, I'm free now

We scream loud, we pray hard
Because it's done now
