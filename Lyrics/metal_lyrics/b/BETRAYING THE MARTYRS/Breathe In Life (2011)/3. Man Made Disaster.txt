I can't fight, you just made me what I am. The Fate made you my cure as
Much as you are my poison. I will live but only if you save yourself so
Please don't run a way from me

My name is life, I have ran across unimaginable vasts of land, I have lived
Too long for you to comprehend, I will never remember the names of all
Those that have held my hand, that have held my hand, I have cried in the
Faces, in the faces of a million corpses, though I will not live forever,
No I have a parasite, he who has the power to aid me to cleanse me of
Disease. Before you can save me, you must save yourselves

Don't try to kill me for I will kill muself, so please don't run a way from
Me, see that I'm worth, my name is life, my body is earth, so please don't
Run a way from me.

I have a body, it's name, the earth, the power I bear will soon be apparant
To you, I will shake down in a cold suffocation spit a firey death,
Consuming unbearable hate. I will digest all traitors with a gut of
Concreate mass. I'll blow you a way!
A wave I send to wash humanity clean with the soap of the martyrs tears,
It's been seen before, and will be seen once more, revival will be no
Option.

Don't try to kill me for I will kill myself, so please don't run a way from
Me, see that I'm worth, my name is life, my body is earth, so please don't
Run a way from me.
I can't fight, you just made me what I am. The fate made you my cure as
Much as you are my poison. I will live but only if you save yourself so
Please don't run a way from me!
