Skies open Azalee was on her back
Watching lying in a sea of glass
She'll never be an adult not even a teen
And she knew it

It took all her will to face it
Your words will never mend
After all that she needed was a simple shield?

And you fought yourself all life long
But what can be done while I've beat you with cruelty 
violence
And you are just a child and you are all alone
When you are all alone

All she needed was a simple shield? 
I heard that she'll walk with angels
As she became as one with the sky
Until the blackness over came

She is earning her back way
the little smile on her face
Her eyes forever open to the sun and sky

And you fought yourself all life long
But what can be done while I've beat you with cruelty 
violence
And you are just a child and you are all alone
When you are all alone

Azalee what have you done
Azalee what have you done
Cruelty violence and you are just a child
Azalee what have you done
