Angel!
Very light of my life!
I cannot comprehend life without you
And now that no substance remains
Reminiscence of you departure ensures
No clocks will turn with haste!

I can taste you near
In my heart you re never wasteful
This earth s not finished with you yet
You re part of my fabrication

Sewn patches of my existence
Prints left for generations to see
You re part of my fabrication
Structure of human tapestry to me

Don t leave me!
Please don t leave me!
Your time will come &amp; so will mine!
Just don t make this the end!

I ll grab hold
Of your wings enclosed within your path
I m attached as ever honey
I won t let you go!

I m not letting go
I m grabbing your beating heart
And putting it back!

Procreate the life that
That harbored on this earth
Walk with now your head
Shall hold high again

Walk with me, walk with me
Look out up into the sky!

I cannot comprehend life without you!

Pray as you re scared but don t run away
I will show you the way
Never give up keep all your faith
This is not your last day

I m far away
I m far away now!
I can t let you go!
My death grips on you!

I can taste you near
In my heart you re never wasteful
This earth s not finished with you yet
You re part of my fabrication

Sewn patches of my existence
Prints left for generations to see
You re part of my fabrication
Structure of human tapestry to me

I m sorry reaper!
I m sorry reaper this time!
I m sorry reaper, sorry she s mine!

Pray as you re scared but don t run away
I will show you the way
Never give up keep all your faith
This is not your last day

Passeth by this nightmare
This is only your beginning

Hells gates, weld them shut
Now iron clad for all eternity
Remove the coals, apart the furnace
Drain the styx, head my call!

My light burns brighter than your flames
My heart larger than your depths
My grip tighter than yours of death

I m taking her back
Taking her back!

Come live this life!
