What the F#$%!
Could you possibly be certain but
Searching why you walked this earth
No remorse, Your Eyes Closed!

What the F#$%!
Will you do looking back on regret?
This life you wasted all!

What did you do when he was so messed up?
What did you do when your friend was so lost?
Put the blame on you put the blame on me?

It doesn't mean anything!
Life was a gift, life I gave and life I received!
He needed me!
He was asking for my presence!
I know it now!

He was scared so afraid, and he lost all his dreams
But don't run away I was blind, I regret, I didn't 
realize
I feel so guilty! And now the lights are fading out
Turning bliss into darkest fear!

I've seen so many things; I've seen the creation of 
suns
I've seen so many things; I've seen the creation of 
light
I've seen so many things; I've seen the creation of 
suns
I've seen so many things; I've seen the creation of 

He said, he said, he saw the light away but tonight 
it's over!
He said, he said, he saw the light but tonight its 
over!

Life was a gift, given again and again!
Birth of a son, of a child! 
All those lights shine in our skies and hearts!
Life is my greatest gift, life I gave and I received!
Life is my dusk!

Even in the dead cold heart of darkness 
A light can shine shine like the sun!

Make it shine till it can't be undone
You can be a sun, light in the dark
You got to shine!
Make it shine till it can't be undone
You can be a sun!

He said, he said, he saw the light away but tonight 
it's over!
He said, he said, he saw the light away but tonight 
it's over!

What are you waiting for? Wake up now!
What are you waiting for? Wake up now!
What are you waiting for? Wake up now!
What are you waiting for? Wake up now!
