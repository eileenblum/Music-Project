Leave it all behind!
Now can be your time,
Leave it all behind
Everyway they molded you,
Everything they told you that
You have to be!

How their words cut through
How their fists broke your mind
If they could see you now!
Human life, you re wasting it all away!

Break through these invisible walls
Those who we have grown up around
Have grown roots to the place
Where they think they need to exist

Never leave, never speak, never open your eyes
To a world with open arms!

You are the weak!

You are the weak, you are the wasteful
Don t scream my name from the depths of hell
Your cries shall be ignored!

Never leave, never speak, never open your eyes to this 
world
Never leave, never speak, to this world with open arms
Just live your own way, your own life, and never open 
your eyes
Never leave, never speak, leave it all behind!

What will you do?
At the end of your day, if presented with a tapestry of 
your life
The very fabric consisting of nothingness, you ve 
wasted it all away!
We re all given one chance, one chance to make a chance
One chance to make a footprint!

Sit back, eat away your days!

Never leave, never speak, never open your eyes to this 
world
Never leave, never speak, to this world with open arms
Just live your own way, your own life, and never open 
your eyes
Never leave, never speak. . .

You are the weak the wasteful
Just don t scream my name, from the depths of hell
As your idol hands reach for help!

I am the walker!
We re the example we are the ones that carve with grace
When you look back be it not my face
You will see but blackness, nothing to show
Nothing to show!

We are the roads, you are the broken bridge
We ll be the hunter, you ll be the sacrilege
We are the sun, you are the stormy skies
We are the beauty, and you are sand in your own eyes!

You are the weak the wasteful
Just don t scream my name, from the depths of hell
As your idol hands reach for help!
