(They'll lead us blinded to the) slaughter
Egh! (Egh, â¦)

Social stature, a constant decline
They march us to the bottom here we're butchered like swine

How can we live like this, as nothing but pawns?
In their hunger games, shotgun blasts to the swarm
Hunger games - prepare for the storm

We choke to stay alive,
Gasping for air just to survive
On the edge of our extinction
When will they open their eyes?
They starve, they crawl, they beg for mercy,
Gasping for air just to survive
We choke to stay alive
When will they see we're all gonna
Die?

Leaders, resource-eating swine
Silver spoons and their fucked-up minds
(Stop) read the warning signs
We're out of time, out of time, out of time

[Guitar solo]

We choke to stay alive,
Gasping for air just to survive
On the edge of our extinction
When will they open their eyes?
They starve, they crawl, they beg for mercy,
Gasping for air just to survive
We choke to stay alive
When will they see we're all gonna die?

Stop, read the warning signs
Stop â this cannot go on forever
