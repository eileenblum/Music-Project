It tears me deep when I close my eyes
To think that you're no longer here
Can't you tell I'm no longer breathing?
Can't you tell? Can't you see I'm drowning in fear?
I'm in the deep, deep in denial
Don't tell me you're no longer here
I know your flame was no longer burning,
But it always burns for me

This is the sound of letting you go
Your final days just stole

They took your life too soon
They took the brightest soul
Those breaths you should have took
Those words you could have spoken
INJUSTICE

The impact broke our hearts,
Leaving us all so speechless
(How could this fucking be?)
A night so long and sleepless
INJUSTICE â oh!

I'm left with no goodbye
I guess we're letting you go

It tears me deep when I close my eyes
To think that you're no longer here
Can't you tell I'm no longer breathing?
Can't you tell? Can't you see I'm drowning in fear?
I'm in the deep, deep in denial
Don't tell me you're no longer here
I know your flame was no longer burning,
But it always burns for me

When the lights went out
And your heartbeat stopped,
We've never felt such pain; only memories remain
But we will never ever forget

No (no, â¦)

This is the sound of letting you go (go, â¦)

When the wheels overturned,
My God, how it hurts
So long

[Guitar solo]

It tears me deep when I close my eyes
To think that you're no longer here
Can't you tell I'm no longer breathing?
Can't you tell? Can't you see I'm drowning in fear?
I'm in the deep, deep in denial
Don't tell me you're no longer here
I know your flame was no longer burning,
But it always burns for me

It tears me deep when I close my eyes
I realize you are not here
It still hurts when I try to breathe
Some things will never disappear
I'll always be deep in denial
I'll always feel like you're still here
Your flame won't stop burning;
It burns forever in our (dreams)
