If this day was your last,
Would you blame the present or past?
Or would you refuse to admit we're all the accused?
And when that day comes, tell me who, who will stand up?

Fading lights - the call of the hounds
Resounds in the distance as forest burn into the ground
No one makes a sound
The winds blow, the crows come to feed,
To feed on the carcasses butchered by artillery
We've lowered this earth to its knees
Eeyah!

HIDE THE TRUTH; the future's bleak
I REFUSE; do you believe?
Are we capable?
S-O-S, save our souls

Save our souls

Rising heat - volcanoes explode
Eroding the sea line as rivers and lakes overflow,
Thawing the snow
The winds blow, the crows come to feed,
To feed on the carcasses butchered by artillery
We've lowered this earth to its knees

If this day was your last,
Would you blame the present or the past?
Crying for mercy
If this day was your last,
Would you blame the present or the past?
This day could be your last

HIDE THE TRUTH; the future's bleak
I REFUSE; do you believe?
Are we capable?
S-O-S, save our souls
