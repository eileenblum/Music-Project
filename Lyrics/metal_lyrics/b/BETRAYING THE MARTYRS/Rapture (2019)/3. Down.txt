The story goes:
A million miles and a thousand shows
Pure hearts of gold
Singing it back to the microphone

Singing it back to the microphone, yeah! (yeah, â¦)

Breathe in,
Suck it in, and spit it back, back
We ain't backing down
Live and die for the wolf pack

DOWN, DOWN
Raise your fists, let's bring this place
DOWN (down), DOWN (down)
Hand in hand, we fight together
When you scream with me,
We tear this roof
DOWN, DOWN
We shall raise this flag together â ah! (ah, â¦)

Set in stone
Forged by fire - iron bones
In the zone
Lights go out and we lose control

Lights go out and we lose control, yeah!

Unstoppable
Feel the heat, push it back, back
Keep it coming now
Scream until your lungs collapse

DOWN, DOWN
Raise your fists, let's bring this place
DOWN (down), DOWN (down)
Hand in hand, we fight together
When you scream with me,
We tear this roof
DOWN, DOWN
We shall raise this flag together â ah!

Rghh!

We're a fucking tidal wave of destruction
It's redemption time
Fucking wave of destruction,
Destruction

DOWN, DOWN
Raise your fists, let's bring this place
DOWN (down), DOWN (down)
Hand in hand, we fight together
When you scream with me,
We tear this roof
DOWN, DOWN
We shall raise this flag together

Thunder,
Hear our call
Make the
Mountains fall - bleghh!
