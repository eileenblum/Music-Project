Reflections,
Tell me who you really see
It's not perfection,
But who are they to tell you what that means?

Don't fool yourself (fool yourself, â¦)

Life without a filter
They're nothing more than what you have inside
Sitting on your highest horse
Clouded eyes and narrow minds

Searching
Look inside yourself somehow
Imagine (imagine),
Imagine that you're good enough now

Imagine
Imagine
Imagine feeling bold, imagine loving yourself
Imagine confidence deep within your soul

Focus
It's time to close your eyes, look behind the lies, and
Focus

(Reflections,
Tell me who you really see
It's not perfection,
But who are they to tell you what that means?)

(Searching
Look inside yourself somehow)
Imagine (imagine),
Imagine that you're good enough now
Searching
Look inside yourself somehow
Imagine (imagine),
Imagine that you're good enough now

(Imagine)
(Imagine)
(Imagine)
(Imagine)

(Imagine) Imagine,
Imagine now
(Imagine) Imagine,
Imagine now

Life without a filter
They're nothing more than what you have inside
Sitting on their highest horse
Clouded eyes and narrow minds

Why look to fiction to compare yourself?
Stop and think: is your heart still beating?
If you just stopped and took a second glance,
You'd see their selfish bones, so stop competing â oh!

Imagine
Compassion
Imagine
