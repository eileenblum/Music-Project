So, tell me WHY would you let me in,
Just to go and fucking let me down?
WHY would you push me in,
Just to stand there and watch me drown?

Just like you were buried alive
Left a carcass with no feeling inside
I mourn your death with pride
Lifeless and pathetic - empty bottles, suicide
I was your savior,
And you, my queen,
But now you're dead and gone,
And the blame is on me

And now, take me there;
Take me to the iron gates again
Fade to black, erase it all
The curtains draw
I feel so alone
Since you left us all
Take me there;
Take me to the iron gates again
Your body, still and cold
Your body, still and cold
I feel so alone

Before you die, spread those wings
Bid the child farewell for me
Say goodbye, say goodnight
Dark, become my life

Ooah!

Now tell me: WHY would you pick me up,
Just to go and fucking let me down?
WHY would you open the door,
Just to turn around and shut me out?

Black eyes, black funeral
Black hole, wasted past
Give me life, give me a home,
Then take it back
Black eyes, black funeral
Black lungs, wasted past
I'm left with nothing,
Nothing but pain and this whiskey glass (Ah!)

I was your savior (I was your savior, â¦),
And you, my queen (and you, my queen, â¦)

I was your savior (I was your savior, â¦),
And you, my queen (and you, my queen, â¦)

I was your savior (I was your savior, â¦),
And you, my queen (and you, my queen, â¦)
