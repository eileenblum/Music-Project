Ugh! (Ugh!)

The cogs keep turning
The earth keeps burning down
They gotta fuel the war machine
Crude oil and kerosene

A constant need, a hate to feed
In a world that's bleeding out
Catastrophe, epanastrophe
A never-ending cycle
An enterprise built on lies
An eternal industry
For the wheels to turn, the world must burn;
Burn it to the ground

Always wanting more and more
Living the nightmare just to feed the dream
Spoiling the wealthy, depriving the poor
Make war to fuel the machine

Filthy production line
Twisted, destructive minds
Does it get you off?
Arm the troops - it's feeding time

Devour
Errah!

Supply to demand, create to destroy
Feed the fucking machine
Go!

Devour

For the wheels to turn, the world must burn;
Burn it to the ground

Always wanting more and more
Living the nightmare just to feed the dream
Spoiling the wealthy, depriving the poor
Make war to fuel the machine

[Guitar solo]

A thirst for bloodshed, the hungry man
Ever-eternal war machine

Unstoppable

Stop this train; let's derail the monster
The iron prince cannot cease to breathe
Only flames can ignite the fire
Annihilating the war machine
