Alone, you lose control
Between these walls that you've built in your head
And you can't look forward with your head hanging down
Hanging around in this cell of regret
BUT YOU, you just don't get it; you let it get in the way
You stay chained, locked up in your brain
NO, NO, you just don't get, so keep on hiding your face
Go build those walls; that'll drive you insane

(I watched you forge them bars
You locked them up and then you swallowed the key
Time flies - open your eyes
To stop from drowning in agony)

I hate to watch you suffer
I hate to watch you suffocate

Out of your mind, locked inside
A self-inflicted penitentiary
Look at me
Answer me, answer me - please don't go
Out of your mind
This ain't how living is supposed to be
Look at me
Break these chains, get up, and go

Locked inside, doing time
You went and sentenced yourself to life
In your mind, incarcerated
Intoxicating

What's in your mind?
I hate to watch you suffer

Don't say you're lonely
You're not alone - misery loves company

(Alone, alone)
Anxious, swimming in sadness
(Alone, alone)
Thick-skulled, living in the past
You're cold
Shiver, shiver, shiver
(Cold)
Uh! Shiver, shiver, shiver

Out of your mind, locked inside
A self-inflicted penitentiary
Look at me
Answer me, answer me - please don't go
Out of your mind
This ain't how living is supposed to be
Look at me
Break these chains, get up, and go

Shiver, shiver, shiver
Shiver, shiver, shiver
