I'm a fucking monster
Errah!

My blood is boiling, but I'm loving the pain,
Bathing in the hatred with a grin on my face
This is WHO I AM; don't ever ask me to change
I couldn't if I tried, so let me be, let me be me

Mrghh!
I can't fake it
This is who I've always been
I'll never, ever change,

'Cause I'm a fucking monster
Egh! Egh!

As it rises, I embrace the chills
From my spine into my fingertips
The voices start running through my head;
They're telling me to let out the monster

Back up â temperature is rising and my teeth start to grind
SOMEONE, STOP ME
Embrace the hate

I'm over trying to hide;
This is who I am
I'm over trying to hide; this is who I am,
This is who I am

Just a fucking monster

I'm not afraid to embrace the pain nor the hate
This is who I am â it's who I am
Please, don't try to save me
Let me slip, slip away

[Piano solo]

Uh!
I can't fake it
This is who I've always been
I'm never, ever, ever gonna
Change

VOICES, they're in my head
VOICES, they live and breathe

Don't you try to save me; this is me
