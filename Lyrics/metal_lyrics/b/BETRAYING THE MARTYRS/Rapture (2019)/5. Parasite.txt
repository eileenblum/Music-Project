It's like we're trapped inside an empty room
No light of day - a single ray could break this feeling of doom
I look across; who do I see? It's you and only you
But I ain't taking this; no, not this time
You turn my mind into an ugly sight
You better run and fucking hide

Let's settle the score
We're going to war
I'm over falling for your fucking traps
It's taking control,
Destroying my soul
I'll feel better once these walls collapse

I'll give the devil my taunted soul
Before I let you take control
(No more begging on my knees
It's time you slipped into eternal sleep)
I'd rather burn in a sea of flames
Than be pulled into your twisted games
(Close your eyes and go to sleep
Close your eyes and go to sleep)

You're nothing but a parasite (parasite)
It's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Let's settle the score
We're going to war
I'm over falling for your fucking traps
It's taking control,
Destroying my soul
I'll feel better once these walls collapse

I am the boss,
And it's time to cut you off
Life must go on, but
I will never forget

(Ohohohohhohh)
(Ohohohohhohh)

Back when we were young,
When you didn't have much to say,
When we were young
You'll pull me under, but not today

Let's settle the score
We're going to war
I'm over falling for your fucking traps
It's taking control,
Destroying my soul
You took my life, now I'm taking it back (back, â¦)

Now I'm taking it back
Yeah! I'm taking it
