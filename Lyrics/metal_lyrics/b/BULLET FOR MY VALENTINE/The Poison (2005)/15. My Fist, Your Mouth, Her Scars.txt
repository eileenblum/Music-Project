Bleed, when you thought you knew
Do you hear me shout?!
Bleeding through my head, my heart, my eyes!
To come home

What I'm thinking now
When I take you out
We can hold these thoughts I have of you till it comes!

There's no more ways to tell you
I want to fuck you now.
With every ounce of anger
In turn we know you're going down.

[x2]
now it's over, I'm calmer
her crimson flowing down like water,
I saw her when she hit the ground

Bruise, when I tear you up
Have I gone too far?
What about my fist, your mouth, her scars!
(To Come Home)

What I'm thinking now
When I stumble down
We can never say that you are gone till it comes!

There's no more ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick, you're going down!

[X2]
Now, It's over, I'm calmer
Her crimson flowing down, like water
I saw her as she hit the ground!

[Guitar Solo]

Hate, when you thought you knew
Do you hear me shout!?
Bleeding through my head, my heart, my eyes!
To come home

What I'm thinking now
When I take you out
We can hold these thoughts I have of you till it comes!

There's no more ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick you're going down.

There's no more ways to show you
I wanna fuck you now.
With every ounce of anger
In turn we know you're going down!
