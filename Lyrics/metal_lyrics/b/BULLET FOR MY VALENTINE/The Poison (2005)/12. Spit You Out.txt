I am what I am, so I...
Spit you out!

Do I, cut the ties? or do I, hold on tight?!

Time has come for me to realize
All those things I loved I now despise

But it's, my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
(To rise above!)
It's, my, life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!

Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over

I am what I am, so I...
Spit you out!
Can you justify how I...

Time has come for me to realize
All those things I loved I now despise

But it's, my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
(To rise above!)
It's, my, life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!

Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over now!

The end!

I know you're faking!
You try to get me back!
I know you're faking it!

The end!

(..feel it's over..)
(..feel it's over..)

(Bullet for my Valentine! *crowd cheering*)

(How ya doin' everyone?! *crowd cheers again*)

But it's, my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
(To rise above!)
It's, my, life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's, our, time!
To rise above!
