[Featuring Benji Webbe of Skindred]

(OH YEAH!)

[Tuck]
I'm always thinking of you
And all the things that you do!
Self-centred satisfaction
No more will I run from you!

Dysfunction, family values
I'll die but I will not fear!
Stop talking words of wisdom!
You fool, I'm standing right here!

[Pre-chorus:]
The world is on your shoulders!
The weight is crushing me!
Now we're all getting older!
TAKE IT OUT! [x4]

[Chorus:]
Take it out on me [x4]
Vent your frustration on me!

[Benji]
I feel so much destruction
In everything that you do!
Anger is creeping in me!
Watch I don't explode on you!

My rage, it comes so quickly!
One spark and I will ignite!
Self harm and mutilation
Cuts deep but the pain feels so right!

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo - Jay (Bass)]

[Breakdown:]
This fire burns inside...
(This fire burns inside...)

There's nowhere left to hide...
This fire burns inside...
(This fire burns inside...)

[Solo - Tuck]

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Take it out!
