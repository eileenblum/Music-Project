Oh!

[Tuck:] 2, 3, 4!

Helpless!
My eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside!
You sealed your demise when you
Took what was mine

Don't try to stop me from avenging this world!
No voice to be heard

[Chorus:]
Waking the demon!
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows!
Watch the blood flow!

[Bridge:]
There's not much longer, so don't try and hide,
Your body's weakening, walk to the light!
Those painful times so alone, so ashamed!
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain!

Caution!
There's just no limit to the boundaries you push!
I've warned you but still you just fuck with my mind!
There's no escape from this rage that I feel!
Nothing is real!

[Chorus]
[Bridge]

[Interlude (x2):]
Breathe for me!
Don't wake me from this slumber!
Stay with me!
Possession taking over!

[Breakdown:] Whoa! Tread!

[Guitar solo - Padget]
[Duet - Padget/Tuck]

[Interlude x2]

Waking the Demon!
