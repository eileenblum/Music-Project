[Metallica Cover]

Slaves!
Hebrews born to serve!
To the Pharaoh!

Heed!
To his every word!
Live in fear!

Faith!
Of the unknown one!
The deliverer!

Wait!
Something must be done!
Four hundred years!

[Chorus]
So Let it be written!
So let it be done!
I'm sent here by the chosen one!

So let it be written!
So let it be done!
To kill the first born Pharaoh's son!

I'm creeping death!

Now!
Let my people go!
Land of Goshen!

Go!
I will be with thee!
Bush of fire!

Blood!
Running red and strong!
Down the Nile!

Plague!
Darkness three days long!
Hail to fire!

[Chorus Variation]
So let it be written!
So let it be done!
I'm sent here by the chosen one!

So let it be written!
Let it be FUCKING DONE!
To kill the first born Pharaoh's son!

I'm creeping death!

[Breakdown]
Die! [X17]
Die!
By My Hand!
I creep across the land!
Killing first born man![X2]

YEAH!

I!
Rule the midnight air!
The destroyer!

Born!
I shall soon be there!
Killing mass!

I!
Creep the steps and flood!
Final darkness!

Blood!
Lambs blood painted door!
I shall pass!

[Chorus]
