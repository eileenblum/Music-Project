[Solo - Tuck]

Heaven's waiting for you
Just close your eyes and say goodbye
Hearing your pulse go on and on and on...

[Pre-chorus:]
I live my life in misery
I'd sacrifice this world to hold you
No breath left inside of me
Shattered glass keeps falling

[Chorus:]
Say goodnight
Just sleep tight
Say goodnight...

[Solo - Padget]

Flowers laid out for you
So many colours leave me blind
Seeing your face reflect from our baby's eyes

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Mosh (x2)]
SO HERE I AM! YOU'RE INSIDE OF ME!
SO HERE I AM! OUR WORLD IS OVER!

[Bridge]
Here I am with you!
I'm there till the end!
Memories are calling!
So farewell, my friend
(FAREWELL, MY FRIEND!)

[Duet - Padget / Tuck]

[Bridge]

My Friend! [x3]
