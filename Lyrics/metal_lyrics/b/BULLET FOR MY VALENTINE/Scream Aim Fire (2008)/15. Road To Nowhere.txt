[Australian Deluxe Edition bonus track]

Tired and lonely still we stand
On a road to nowhere
Trapped in a world of endless days,
My engine's stalling (Road to nowhere)
Body and mind are breaking down
On a road to nowhere
Destiny silent, hear no sound
As I wait forever.

Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these good byes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you

Feelings have failed me
Left me cold
On this road to nowhere
(Road to Nowhere)
Dreams are my saviors,
Save me now,
'Cause I know I'm fallin' (Oh yes)

Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these good byes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you

Candles burn slowly,
Flames shine so brightly
Light in the darkness,
Save me from madness again

Only the lonely,
could possibly know me
Heat keeps on rising,
Fire engulfs me again

KEEPS ON RISING

Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these good byes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you

Farewell, I'll miss you
I'm sick of these good byes
'Cause it tore us apart right from the start
I miss you
