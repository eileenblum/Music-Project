Once again the same thing on your mind!
Increasing pulse for what goes on inside!
Will you pay for what you've done?!
Hatred!
Payback's such a bitch, and vengeance haunts you!

[Pre-chorus:]
So what's wrong tough guy, why the tears?
You drove me to this, now disappear!

[Chorus (x2):]
Now all those acts repaid!
Your turn to be afraid!
Not longer, almost done,
Oh god, just what have I become?

Try to fight, it only makes things worse!
Screams of agony upon a verse!
Now you're begging for your life!
BREATHLESS!
All the times I've bled, my vengeance takes you!

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus x2]

Your sweetest dreams into fears!
It's almost done, they're almost gone
Our darkest days, they fade away!
It's almost done, they're almost gone!

[Solo - Tuck]

[Breakdown (x4):] Hey

So what's wrong tough guy, why the tears?
You drove me to this now you!
Disappear!
So what's wrong tough guy, why the tears?
You drove me to this now you disappear!

[Chorus x2]

(Now!)
Yeah!
