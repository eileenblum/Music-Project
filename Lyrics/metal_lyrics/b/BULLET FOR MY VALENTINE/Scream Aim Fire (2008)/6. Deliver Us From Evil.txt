What's happening to me!?
I'm dying from the inside!
Body hurts too much to feel!
Pressure adds to pain!
Deliver us from evil!
Straying out of sanity!

Why can't you let me be!?
Is nothing else important?
Does my mind mean more to you!?
'cause if I carry on!
Deliver us from evil!
Screaming for your vanity!

[Pre-chorus:]
Will darkness turn to light!?
(WILL DARKNESS TURN TO LIGHT?!)
Can someone wake me from this nightmare?

Here we go, here we go

[Chorus:]
The tank is empty, let it dry
I'm suffering!
A passion ending, so the world ceases turning
The tank is empty, let it dry!

So now I hope you see!
I'm nothing more than human!
Making plans for enemies!
But here we go again!
Deliver us from evil!
Crawling back to insanity!

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus x2]

I'm suffering

[Breakdown:]
What's happening to me?
I'm dying from the inside...
Body hurts to much to feel...
Pressure adds to pain..
Deliver us from evil...
(Through evil..)

Pressure adds to pain...
You're evil, we're evil, I'm evil!

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus till fade]
