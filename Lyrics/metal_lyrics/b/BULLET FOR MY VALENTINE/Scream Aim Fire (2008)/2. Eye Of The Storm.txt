[Verse 1:]
Can you hear the thunder?
Can you feel the rain it pours?
Nail down all your windows
Then barricade the doors!

Mother nature's fury
Takes you by the hand!
Showing all but mercy!
Wrecking death upon the land!

[Chorus:]
Go!
Caught in the eye of the storm!
Did the heaven just open and fall?
We are
Caught in the eye of the storm!
All that's left are just bodies to mourn!

Can you see the lightning?
Can you feel the wind it soars?
Pack up your belongings
Let chaos take control!

(Takes control!)

Mother nature's fury
Takes you by the hand!
Rip this world to pieces!
Bid farewell to all you know

[Chorus]

Yeah!

[Breakdown (x3):] Caught in the eye of the storm!

[Solo - Padget]
[Repeat verse 1 (duet Padget / Tuck)]

Mother nature's fury
Takes you by the hand!
Showing all but mercy!
Wrecking death upon the land!

[Chorus]

To mourn!
