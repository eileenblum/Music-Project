[American Deluxe Edition bonus track]

(One, two, three, four...)

Ashes of the innocent
The end for you and me
Darkness, screams of agony are begging set me free
Come set me free!

Mourning all your loved ones,
As their bodies turn to stone
Violence, hate and agony
Are what we've grown to know!

[Chorus:]
Hold me, show me, bring me to my knees

So as the fire burns
And the tables turn,
We'll never rest in peace (rest in peace)

(Oh! Yeah!)
(Fuck You, Push it!)

Ashes of the innocent
Remind me of the past
Taking scars of victory,
The time has passed too fast
(It's passed too fast!)

Singing broken melodies
Like shards of broken glass
Ripping through my memory!
These scars won't ever last!

[Chorus 2 (x2):]
Hold me!
Show me!
Bring me to my knees!
(To my knees!)

So as the fire burns
And the tables turn,
We'll never rest in peace

[Solo - Tuck]
[Duet - Tuck / Padget]
[Solo - Padget]

Ashes of the innocent
The end for you and me
Darkness, screams of agony
Are begging set me free...
Come set me free!

[Chorus 2 (x2)]

Rest In Peace!
