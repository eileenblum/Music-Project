We're wasting precious time!
The clock is ticking;
Can you hear the countdown?

With every hour!
Give me the power!
I need the strength to carry on!
On and on!

[Pre-chorus (x2):]
No more I care to live!
When I'm just born to die!
(WE'RE ALL BORN TO DIE! BORN TO DIE!)

[Chorus (x2):]
(NEVER BEFORE! NEVER AGAIN!)
Behold this travesty!
(NEVER BEFORE! NEVER AGAIN!)
Behold adversary!

Befriend my enemies!
My pulse is racing;
I can hear my heart beat!

Is this the last time
You get to be mine!?
I lack the will to carry on!
On and on!

[Pre-chorus x2]
[Chorus x2]

NO MORE SORROW!
NO TOMORROW!
I NEVER FELT ALIVE BEFORE!
YEAH!

[Solo - Tuck]
[Duet - Padget / Tuck]

[Breakdown:]
With every hour...
Give me the power...
I need the strength to carry on...
ON AND ON!

[Pre-Chorus x4]

To Die! [x2]
To DIE!
