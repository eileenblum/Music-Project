[Australian Deluxe Edition bonus track]

Back against the wall
What the fuck just happened?
(Don't you cry)
We've been here before
Bring it on, taking action
(No more lies)

I'm not gonna blame this on you,
I know I gave it all I got,
No, I'm not gonna blame this on you,
I'll tell you that its not your fault.

But honestly, you're killing me,
I'm sick of us wasting time,
I took your heart, tore it apart,
Watching us die tonight.

Take me for a fool,
What the hell were you thinking?
(All this time)
Now I have to choose,
'Cause I'm done, no more faking.
(Let me out)

I'm not gonna blame this on you,
I know I gave it all I got.
No, I'm not gonna blame this on you,
I'll tell you that it's not your fault.

But honestly, you're killing me,
I'm sick of us wasting time.
I took your heart, tore it apart,
Watching us die tonight.

Everything will be alright,
I'm watching us die tonight.
Everything will be alright,
I'm watching us die tonight.

I'm not gonna blame this on you,
I know I gave it all I got.
No, I'm not gonna blame this on you,
I'll tell you that it's not your fault.

But honestly, you're killing me,
I'm sick of us wasting time.
I took your heart, tore it apart,
Watching us die tonight.
