You're the reason I feel so alive (I feel so alive)
You're the craving that tears me apart from the inside
You're my downfall, the one I obey (The one I obey)
I'm a monster, the freak that you needed and it's okay
Is this sick and depraved?
I see hell is defined
Is this twisted and crazed?
Or a brilliant disguise
It starts out a fantasy
Then turns into misery
I'll be your pariah
Take it out on me
Eyes shut, no reality
A sucker for your vanity
I'll be your pariah
Take it out on me
I came to you like a moth to a flame
I was the piece of the puzzle you played in your own game
I should have known by the look in your eyes
But now we've gone too far
Now I'm holding on tight
Trying hard just to survive
Is this sick and depraved?
I see hell is defined
Is this twisted and crazed?
Or a brilliant disguise
It starts out a fantasy
Then turns into misery
I'll be your pariah
Take it out on me
Eyes shut, no reality
A sucker for your vanity
I'll be your pariah
Take it out on me
You know it's what I hate
So come and take it out on me
Is this sick and depraved?
I see hell is defined
Is this twisted and crazed?
Or a brilliant disguise
It starts out a fantasy
Then turns into misery
I'll be your pariah
Take it out on me
Eyes shut, no reality
A sucker for your vanity
I'll be your pariah
Take it out on me
