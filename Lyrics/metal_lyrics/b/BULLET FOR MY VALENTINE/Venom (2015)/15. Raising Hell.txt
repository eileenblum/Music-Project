[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]I feel the fire
Can't touch the flames
This is reality, an infamous game
I taste the blood
Can't seem to cave
The deed is done, but the dead deserves pain

Everyday seems like I'm running from the reaper
Kicking and screaming and going to swinging.
Without my soul your as dumb without a trigger.
Vengeance is burning, who made you the king of the dead?

This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall.
I'm raising hell!

This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall.
I'm raising hell!

Raising Hell!
Your just choice, are you impress of your master?!
No mistakes your in force
Are you hearing this?
You want to test me?
I know, I'll Destroy you!
Save your breath, there's nothing here left
I'm telling You!

Everyday seems like I'm running from the reaper
Kicking and screaming, the demons are singing
It's to late as the break is getting deeper, weightless
I'll make you a Slave Of The Dead

This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall.
I'm raising hell!

This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall.
I'm raising hell!

Raising Hell!

This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall.
I'm raising hell!

This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall.
I'm raising hell!

This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall.
I'm raising hell!

This is a war
That can never be won
Let me go!
I'll fight forever as the heavens fall.
I'm raising hell!
