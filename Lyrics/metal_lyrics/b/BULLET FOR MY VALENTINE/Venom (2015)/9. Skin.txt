Another wasted breath
Trying to prove my innocence
I know I've seen my fate
Another lie that brings grace

I know you wanna see
See me hurt, make me suffer
But all that's left are all the
Broken shattered pieces of our lives

I wish that I could tell you so you know
There's things I'm having deep beneath my skin, beneath my skin
I wanna tell you so you know
There's things I'm having deep beneath my skin, beneath my skin

So come and take my life
Let me feel your wickedness
I know I make mistakes
So come and watch me fall from grace

I know you wanna see
See me hurt, make me suffer
I'm nothing left so I'll just
Sacrifice myself to make it right

I wish that I could tell you so you know
There's things I'm having deep beneath my skin, beneath my skin
I wanna tell you so you know
There's things I'm having deep beneath my skin, beneath my skin

I wanna tell you so you know
I wanna tell you

I guess Iâve fucked things up, I know it's all my fault
I'm pretty sure that this will be the death of me
I guess Iâve fucked things up, I know it's all my fault
I'm pretty sure that this will be the death of me

I wish that I could tell you so you know
The things I'm having deep beneath my skin, beneath my skin
I wanna tell you so you know
There's things I'm having deep beneath my skin, beneath my skin

I wish that I could tell you so you know
There's things I'm having deep beneath my skin, beneath my skin
I wanna tell you so you know
There's things I'm having deep beneath my skin, beneath my skin
