You're nowhere even near me
But everywhere I go i feel you
Can you feel me?
Why can't I just forget you
I wanna shred my skin to love you
Can you heal me?
Now I'm giving up
I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste
Of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste
Of your venom
How dare you play the victim
This told you lies
They see I throat you
Oh, I throat you
But still you keep me capped up
And make me feel like I deserve you
But I
Hate you!
Hate you!
Now I'm giving up
I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste
Of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste
Of your venom
I feel asphyxiated
It's more then I can take
But nothing ever changes in the end
No more I'm suffocating
You've gonna lost your grip
But nothing ever changes in the end
Here we go again
But I
Hate you!
Hate you!
Now I'm giving up
I'm never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste
Of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste
Of your venom
Giving up, never looking back
Here we go again
You keep giving me a taste
Of your venom
You know I'm never looking back
Here we go again
I don't want another taste
Of your venom
