[Crowd]
We will not take this anymore,
These words will never be ignored.
You want a battle?
Here's a war

YEAH!

Down eyes of shame
Made to feel dead again
Your words, cut deep
Your lies are fueled by your need for deceit
Too scared to speak,
You're only alive when you torture the weak.
Now hear me roar

I will not take this anymore,
These words will never be ignored.
You want a battle?
Here's a war.

I will not take this anymore,
These words will never be ignored.
You want a battle?
HERE'S A WAR!

Don't be afraid
No remorse, no restraint
These scars won't heal
Now you're the victim I'm making you feel
Like you, are me
I need you to know what youâve done
Can you hear?
Can you hear me roar?

I will not take this anymore,
These words will never be ignored.
You want a battle?
Here's a war.

I will not take this anymore,
These words will never be ignored.
You want a battle?
Here's a war.
You want a battle?
Here's a war.
You want a battle?
!HERE'S a WAR!

Don't suffer in your silence
Know you are never alone
Don't suffer in your silence
Know you are never alone

We will not take this anymore,
These words will never be ignored.
