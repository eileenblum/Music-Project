You're worthless to me!

Have you nothing to say?
Can't you see what you doing to me?
You keep breaking me down
But I won't let you get the better of me
I can't take anymore

Look at me
Is this what you want?
Look at me
Am I what you need?

One more word and I'm taking this over the way
I won't take anymore

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

Has this open your eyes?
It was only a matter of time
I can tell by the look on your face
On your face
Let you know, the devil's in turn
No one's fall but your own

Look at me
Tell me what you see
Look at me
Am I what you need?

One more word and I'm taking this over the way
I won't take anymore

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

No, I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words are worthless to me

You can keep all your apologies
Nothing to me!

You can keep all your apologies
Those words are worthless to me
And I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words mean nothing to me

No, I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words mean nothing to me
And I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words are worthless to me!
They mean nothing!
