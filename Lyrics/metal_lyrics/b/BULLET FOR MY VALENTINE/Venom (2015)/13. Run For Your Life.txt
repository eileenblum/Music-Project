[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]You need to know
what it's like to be left and crucified
to be stripped and torn to pieces.
You just left me there to die, tell me why
do you weep. All this hate and misery.
Is this of your insecurity.
But now's your chance
you better run for your life.
You won't get my sympathy.
Now is your chance
you better run for your life.
You won't get my sympathy.
And I won't let you get away.
Intoxicated by the smell of your fear.
So tell me why do you need all this animosity.
Is this of your insecurity.
But now's your chance you
you better run for your life.
You won't get my sympathy.
Now is your chance
you better run for your life.
You wont get my sympathy
And I won't let you get away.
You better run for your life.
Now I'm taking you out.
You're fucking making me sick.
Now I'm taking you out
so run for your life.
You won't get my sympathy.
Now is your chance
you better run for your life.
You won't get my sympathy.
And I won't let you get away.
I won't let you get away.
