I'm not the reason you're empty
I'm not your scapegoat or shoulder to cry on
I'm just the person you needed
But you've gone to let your demons tear us apart
Can't you see that you need a little moment clarity
Why can't you see, can't believe
That you are your own worst enemy

No, I'm not ready to let you go
No, you need to hear this all you know

These are our times, never forget
No looking back, no more regrets
One thing we've learned from our mistakes
The harder the heart, the harder it breaks

Now you can never be trusted
You're not the person I once could rely
You've gone and burnt all your bridges
Do I have to sit and watch til nothing remains

No, I'm not ready to let you go
No, you need to hear this all you know

These are our times, never forget
No looking back, no more regrets
One thing we've learned from our mistakes
The harder the heart, the harder it breaks

I'm not ready to let you
You need to hear this all you know

Change
All the mistakes you made

These are our times, never forget
No looking back, no more regrets
One thing we've learned from our mistakes
The harder the heart, the harder it breaks

These are our times, never forget
No looking back, no more regrets
One thing we've learned from our mistakes
The harder the heart, the harder it breaks

The harder it breaks
The harder it breaks
