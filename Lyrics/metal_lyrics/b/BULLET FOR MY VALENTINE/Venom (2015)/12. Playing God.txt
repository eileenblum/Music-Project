[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]What are we waiting for
This time we must be sure
No going back, no bow to take, can't even hesitate
We've nothing left to lose
There's no one here but fools
A rush of blood
A bitter taste this world has sealed our fate

No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control

Now we're playing God
Playing God
Playing God
No one will stop us if we're playing God

Thrown out, cast aside
Rejection won't subside
Don't turn the cheek, don't walk away, it's time to decimate
Let's make them hurt and pray
Their turn to run away
Tonight we fight
We make a stand
And dance on shallow graves

No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control

Now we're playing God
Playing God
Playing God
No one will stop us if we're playing God

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Oh

Now hear our noise, hear us coming so loud and so clear
This is our call to arms, and confrontation is near

No one can stop us now
We're taking back control
Good riddance to one and to all
No one can stop us now
We're taking back control

Now we're playing God
Playing God
Playing God
No one will stop us if we're playing God

We're playing God
