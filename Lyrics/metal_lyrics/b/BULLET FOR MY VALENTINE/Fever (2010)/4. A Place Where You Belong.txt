Your body's cold
Hope is lost I can't let go
Can I die with you so we can never grow old?
Count the times
With this note you left behind
As I read the words I hear you telling me why

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away in my own misery
I hope you've finally gone to a place where you belong

My sadness shows
As your name is carved in stone
Can't erase the words, the reality grows
I wish I died
On that night right by your side
So just kill me now, let the good times roll
Too late, too late

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away in my own misery
I hope you've finally gone to a place where you belong

Will you wait for me?
When I see you on the other side
You won't have to wait too long
Yeah, yeah
Will you come to me?
When you're safely to the other side
'cause here I don't belong

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away in my own misery
I hope you've finally gone to a place where you belong

I never said goodbye
Can't even ask you why (I've wasted)
Away in my own misery
I hope you've finally gone to a place where you belong
