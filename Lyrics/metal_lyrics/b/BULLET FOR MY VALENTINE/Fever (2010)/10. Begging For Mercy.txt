Yeah! Oh!

Waking up with just one thing in mind,
Eyes sewn shut so tear them open wide.
I'm on the hunt, I'm on the prowl, I can almost taste you now.
I'm on your scent, I'll track you down. I'm on you now.

Drain your blood, watch it pour.
Drain your blood, plead no more.

Please forgive me, I don't know what I'm doing.
Someone help me. Stop begging for your mercy.
Please forgive me, I don't know what I'm doing.
Someone help me. Stop begging for your mercy.

Can you feel the pain, the smell of fear's around you.
Do you wanna scream, let it out just know I can hear you.
I'm on the hunt, I'm on the prowl. I can almost taste you now.
I'm on your scent, I'll track you down. I'm on you now.

Drain your blood, watch it pour.
Drain your blood, plead no more.

Please forgive me, I don't know what I'm doing.
Someone help me. Stop begging for your mercy.
Please forgive me, I don't know what I'm doing.
Someone help me. Stop begging for your mercy.

Drain your blood, watch it pour.
Drain your blood, plead no more.

[Guitar solo]

Please forgive me, I don't know what I'm doing.
Someone help me. Stop begging for your mercy.
Please forgive me, I don't know what I'm doing.
Someone help me. Stop begging for your mercy.

Oh!
