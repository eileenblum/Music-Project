So society just can't let us be
Please don't be ashamed
We are not to blame
The future's ours to take
We will make mistakes
Scream is loud and proud
We will not back down

So let's go we'll release the pressure
And a kick can only make it better
We can't we won't surrender
We can't we won't surrender!

We're not scared 'cause our life in danger
We add the heat will only make it stronger
We can't we won't surrender
We can't we won't surrender!

Don't tell me where are we laying your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me 'cause I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignity

Woman put us down
Hope we're not around
They pray we go away
But we're here to stay

Time is on our side
Our two worlds collide
These four words might help
Just go fuck yourself!

So let's go we'll release the pressure
And a kick can only make it better
We can't we won't surrender
We can't we won't surrender!

We're not scared 'cause our life in danger
We add the heat will only make it stronger
We can't we won't surrender
We can't we won't surrender!

Don't tell me where are we laying your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me 'cause I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignity

Dignity!

[Solo]

Don't tell me where are we laying your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me 'cause I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignity

Tell me where are we laying your cemetery
Don't try to silence and bury me
Don't push me 'cause I won't go quietly
I'd rather die with dignity
