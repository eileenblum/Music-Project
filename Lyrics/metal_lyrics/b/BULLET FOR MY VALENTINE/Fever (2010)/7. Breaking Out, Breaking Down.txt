We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out, or are we breaking down
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever)

The end will never come
There's still a mountain left to climb
But we will overcome the hurdles placed inside our minds
(so close, but still so far)
Each day will bring us brand new scars
(What are we fighting for)
We cannot live like this no more
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, we know

Just need some clarity, can't seem to open up these eyes
For what your sympathy it took me time to realize
(This is not what I want)
Or how I thought this life would be
(This is not what we wanted)
So take this shit away from me
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, we know

We could blame, the world forever
We could trust, escape together
So are we breaking out (breaking out)
Or are we breaking down (breaking down)
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever)

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
So are we breaking out
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Or are we breaking down

(We could blame this world forever)
We could blame, the world forever
We could trust, escape together
So are we breaking out (breaking out)
Or are we breaking down (breaking down)
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever)

'Cause in the thick of darkened days, we know
