I scream into your face, I scream into your face until,
My veins are bursting through, prisoners that live under my skin,
They call out my name and anger takes its hold
It's hold, but it won't stop 'cause I have no control,
I have no control.

[chorus:]
It calls, calls out my name,
It holds, it holds, it holds me down.

I stare into your eyes, I stare into your eyes until,
The tears start to pour rivers down your face I can't ignore,
It calls, out my name and anger takes its hold,
It's hold, but it won't stop 'cause I have no control,
I have no control

[chorus x2]

[x2]
You say, your way
Was the only way to be.

The only way to be [x2]

[chorus x2]

I have no control [x2]

[scream]
