There goes my valentine again,
Soaked in red for what she said,
And now she's gone.

Oh my god have I done it again,
There's a pulse and it's deafening.
I can't help what I hear in my head,
It's the switch that I flick they said.

Hand of blood, I don't wanna feel like my heart is breaking.
Hand of blood, I don't wanna see that my life is burning.

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take, or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run) I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take or are you scared of being nothing?

There's a stain on my hand and it's red
Oh my god, am I losing it?
I can't help what I've done or I've said
It's the button I push

Hand of blood, I don't wanna feel like my heart is breaking
Hand of blood, I don't wanna see that my life is burning

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take, or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run) I saw you run away,
Is what I've done too much to take or are you scared of being nothing?

[Solo]

No!

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run away) I saw you run away,
Is what I've done too much to take or are you scared of being nothing?
