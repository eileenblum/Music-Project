Too many cuts and too many broken bones
Draining the life, burying skeletons
Do or die, this is the feeling I'm craving
Waiting for life to live (lie)
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith, I'll

Jump into the fire, now free
I'll take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!

The ring of the bells, feeling you resonate
Into the night, hearing you fade away
Do or die, this is a choice that I'm making
And it feels like I'm living a lie
This is the moment for taking
A leap of faith, I'll

Jump into the fire, now free
I'll take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!

So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out
Release the pressure!

So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out
Release the pressure!
So fill your lungs, inhale the future
That's screaming out

Jump into the fire, now free
I'll take you the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
Nothing's gonna kill me, come take me
Closer to the edge but it still can't break me
I'm not caving in!
I'm not caving in!

Too many cuts and too many broken bones
