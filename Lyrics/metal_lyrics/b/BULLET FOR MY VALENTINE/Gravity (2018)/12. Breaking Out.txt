[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]We're breaking out!
We're breaking out!
These streets became our prison cells
Trapped inside this living hell
We're breaking out
Breaking out

Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh
Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh

Stop crawling on a broken road
No signs of liberty
Hope fading as these streets corrode
Into anonymity

We gotta run or we'll decay
This can't wait so fuck tomorrow
We'll never quit, never walk away
Don't wanna be here, ain't gonna take it

So we're breaking out
Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh
We're breaking out
Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh

Again we're told to bite our tongues
Like no one's listening
They turn their backs, they shut us down
With their negativity

We gotta run or we'll decay
This can't wait so fuck tomorrow
We'll never quit, never walk away
We stand for something, we stand for nothing

So we're breaking out
Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh
We're breaking out
Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh
These streets became our prison cells
Trapped inside this living hell
So we're breaking out
Breaking out

We need to be the renegades (or we'll suffocate)
We can't get back and we can't stand and hesitate
Left drowning in the acid rain (or this hurricane)
Let's find a place with no more, no more barricades

Break it, break it, break it
Don't wanna be here
Break it, break it, break it

So we're breaking out
Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh
We're breaking out
Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh
These streets became our prison cells
Trapped inside this living hell
So we're breaking out
Breaking out

Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh
We're breaking out
Whoah-oh, whoah-oh, whoah-oh
Breaking out
We're breaking out
