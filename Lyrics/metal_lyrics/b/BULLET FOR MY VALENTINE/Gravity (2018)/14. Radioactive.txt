[UK/Target Bonus Track][originally by Imagine Dragons]I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse â whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa â I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa â I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in, whoa

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse â whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa â I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa â I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa â I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa â I'm radioactive, radioactive
