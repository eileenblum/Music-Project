Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

We're all alive, let's build the future
Let's drain the bad blood from one another
We got a pulse, don't be a victim
Another chance to not be the afflicted
I know we're cynical, a little critical
We're not the ones that seem to wanna make life difficult
We're all alive, let's build the future
Let's drain the bad blood from one another
We're all alive, let's build the future, build the future

Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

No killing time, we gotta use it
Can't turn it back around so don't abuse it
We've got a voice, let's break the silence
Another chance to live and show defiance
Look at our history, don't put it on repeat
Let's make a stand and drag ourselves out of this misery
No killing time, we gotta use it
Can't turn it back around so don't abuse it
Are you alive?

Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Don't need a miracle, this isn't clinical
Don't need to be revived
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Don't need a miracle, this isn't clinical
Don't need to be revived
Don't need a miracle, this isn't clinical
Don't need to be revived
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Start living 'cause we're not dead yet
Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

(Not dead yet)
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Start living 'cause we're not dead yet)
(Whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
