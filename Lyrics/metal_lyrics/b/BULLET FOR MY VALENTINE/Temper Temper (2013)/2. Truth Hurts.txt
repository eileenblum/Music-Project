One more drink, one more pill
Just one more lie to make me feel
Like I have something left to give
âCause without it I'm just giving in

Itâs just a circle thatâs going
It spirals down and it sends you to hell
Thereâs nothing here that can save me now
I'm coming up just to come back down

[Chorus]
Truth hurts and I'm in pain
Truth hurts like a bed of nails
Letting denial eat me up inside
The truth hurts, and it bleeds me dry

No more lies, no more games
Is it too late to make a change?
If hope is gone then whatâs the point
Just pass my knife and it cuts my throat

A downward spiral takes control
Another chance to sell my soul
Thereâs no one here that can save me now
I'm coming up just to come back down

[Chorus X4]
