This is a fucked up world
Driven hard by greed and lust
Insanity is taking over
Let us all into self-destruct

Lock, load, fire away
Let it burn or let it smolder away
Keep on digging your grave
Refuse? Timeâs ticking away
When the walls come crashing down
Though weâll wear the crown

[Chorus]
Saints! Donât be afraid
Let it out, I wanna hear your thunder
Sinners! Are you ready to race?
Loud and proud, I wanna hear your thunder
Saints! Donât be afraid
The land of fire want to feel your thunder
Sinners! Are you ready to race?
The beast below wants to feel your thunder

Our hope just fades away
Thank God weâre supposed to trust
Insanity is taking over
Let the fires of hell rise up

Lock, load, fire away
Let it burn or let it smolder away
Keep on digging your grave
Refuse? Timeâs ticking away
When the walls come crashing down
Though weâll wear the crown

[Chorus]

Feel your thunder

Lock, load, fire away
Lock, load, fire away
Lock, load, fire away
Time is tick tick ticking away

[Chorus]
