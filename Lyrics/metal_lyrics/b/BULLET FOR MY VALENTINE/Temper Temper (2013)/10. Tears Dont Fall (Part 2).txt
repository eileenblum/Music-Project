Letâs go again!

Ten thousand times
Iâve tried, Iâve tried to call you
I know you wanna talk
I need you to show you how I heard

So answer me, 
Talk to me
So answer me,
Whereâs your sympathy?

You pour your salt into my wounds
You make me feel like Iâm to blame
You pour your salt into my wounds
I wonât play your game

[Chorus]
Obsession, rejection
Your final breath is my possession 
Obsession, rejection
Your final breath is now my possession 

Ten thousand times
Iâve tried, Iâve tried to hate you
Forget your pretty little lies
Itâs time for me to make you heard

So answer me, 
Talk to me
So answer me,
Whereâs your empathy?

You pour your salt into my wounds
You make me feel like Iâm to blame
You pour your salt into my wounds
I wonât play your game

[Chorus]

You pour your salt into my wounds
You make me feel like Iâm to blame
You pour your salt into my wounds
You make me feel like Iâm to blame
You pour your salt into my wounds
I wonât play your game

Woa
Woa
Woa
Woa
Woa
You!

So answer me, 
Talk to me
So answer me,
Whereâs your sympathy?

You pour your salt into my wounds
You make me feel like Iâm to blame
You pour your salt into my wounds
I wonât play your game

[Chorus]

(Obsession) Iâve told you before
(Rejection) Your tears donât fall
(Obsession) Iâve been here before
(Rejection) They crash around me
