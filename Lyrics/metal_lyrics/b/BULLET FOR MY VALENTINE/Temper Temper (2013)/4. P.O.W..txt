In my darkest hour
A place where thereâs no light
Iâm trapped here in this nightmare
And thereâs no end in sight

My body lies here frozen
No voice to scream or shout
Escaping feels untouchable
I know I must get out

[Chorus]
Wake myâ¦
Wake myself from all this danger
Claw myâ¦
Claw myself from six feet under
No, no, no
Am I stuck here like a prisoner of war
I will breathe once more
I will breathe once more

These feelingâs overwhelming
It just wonât go away
Iâm captive in this nightmare
And this is where Iâll stay

[Chorus]

My anxiety is rising
It just wonât go away
Why does this issue keeps building?
You just leave me to die

Make, make, make it go away
All I wanna do is live another day
Make, make, make it go away
All I wanna do is live another day

[Chorus]
