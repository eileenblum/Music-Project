I have died a hundred times before
Your words have ripped out my insides
I find revenge within my soul
Iâve tried a thousand times before
To leave my demons behind me for good
Iâm trapped with no escape to find

[Chorus]
Lost without hope
Hope is now lost
As I hang on for one more tomorrow
Heart turn to black
Iâm not coming back
I know I canât last
âCause I feel like Iâm dead to the world

I feel like Iâm dead to the world

Iâve craved the feel of your caress
No chance to hold you or hurt you again
Iâve gone way too far this time
Too far this time
I craved the sound of your distress
I loved to take out my failures on you
Iâm not the old forgiving kind

[Chorus]

I feel like Iâm dead to the world
I feel like Iâm dead to the world

Iâm dead to you and youâre dead to me

Seems like the gods are punishing me
Shackled in chains I just canât break free
Hands around my throat tighten the grip
Bound by my sins so my wings have been clipped
Iâm paying the price, Iâm doing the time
Serving my sentence for doing the crime.
So show me the heavens or drag me to hell
This story is over, I bid you farewell
I bid you farewell, now drag me to hell
