There once was a time
Where everything was so perfect
Now everything has changed
And youâve become a total stranger
I see another side to you
I never even knew existed

[Chorus]
Dirty little secrets, dirty little secrets
Giving in to your primal instincts
Another taste is what youâre looking for
Thereâs nothing left so you canât take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat youâre like an ANIMAL!!!
Before the kill, like youâre an ANIMAL!!
Straight for the throat youâre an ANIMAL!!

There once was a time
When anything I do is for you
But everything has changed
And Iâve become a lonely prisoner
Id kill, even die for you
You never even tried resisting

Dirty little secrets, Dirty little secrets
Giving in to your primal instincts
Another taste is what youâre looking for
Thereâs nothing left so you canât take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat youâre like an ANIMAL!!!
Before the kill, like youâre an ANIMAL!!
Straight for the throat youâre an ANIMAL!!
(Youâre an animal)

[Guitar Solo]

[x4]
Dirty little secrets, Dirty little secrets

Another taste is what youâre looking for
Thereâs nothing left so you canât take any more
You chewed me up and spat me on the floor
Straight for the throat youâre like an ANIMAL!!!
Before the kill I run an ANIMAL!!
Straight for the throat youâre an ANIMAL!!
