Are you ready itâs time for war
Break down these fucking doors
Smash the windows, tear down the walls
We wonât stop till itâs all destroyed

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let it out, just let it show
Weâll burn it down, weâll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat
Tonight weâre alive, thereâs no time to sleep

[Chorus:]
Wo-oo riot!
Wo-oo riot!
Whoa here come the sirens, here comes the law
Whoa run from the sirens, run from the law
Whoa!

Round two, are you feeling alive?
Weâll overcome, weâll fucking survive
Smash the boundaries, breaking the law
Canât stop till itâs all destroyed

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let it out, just let it show
Weâll burn it down, weâll lose control
Set the fires, can you feel the heat
Tonight weâre alive, thereâs no time to sleep

[Chorus:]
Wo-oo riot!
Wo-oo riot!
Wo-oo here come the sirens, here comes the law
Wo-oo run from the sirens, run from the law
Wo-oo
Itâs time to tear it all

Wo-oo riot!
Wo-oo riot!
Wo-oo here come the sirens, here comes the law
Wo-oo run from the sirens, run from the law
Wo-oo wo-oo riot!
