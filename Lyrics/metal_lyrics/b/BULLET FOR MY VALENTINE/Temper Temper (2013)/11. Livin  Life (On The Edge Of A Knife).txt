I donât know where to start
Too many issues on my mind
This is straight from the heart
You need to take or reconcile

You wanna push me away
You wanna sacrifice what we have
I will not beg you to stay
And it hurts me to say

[Chorus x2]
Youâre not alive 
Youâre dead inside!
Living your life on the edge of a knife
Living your life on the edge of a knife

Donât know youâre alive
Why donât you try and make things right
âCause if you want to survive
Youâll have to take a look inside

Poison â it runs through your veins
You wanna sacrifice what we made
And then is all that remains
And it hurts me to say

[Chorus x2]

Hey! Youâre dead inside!
You never knew you were fuckin alive
Hey! Youâre dead inside!
Youâre too weak, you will never survive

Poison â it runs through your veins
You wanna sacrifice what we made
And then is all that remains
And it hurts me to say

[Chorus x2]
