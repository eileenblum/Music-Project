Hey, leech
No longer will you suck my blood
You canât keep away, you need another taste
Hey, leech
You think that you are here to stay
You canât keep away, you need another taste

Seems to me insanity
Has lived upon an alternate reality
Youâre so delusional, yea
Go and feed your appetite
And gorge on the weak to relieve your lies
Youâre so delusional yea

Nobodyâs listening, nobody cares
Nobodyâs listening, nobody,
Nobody cares

[Chorus]
Your invitation, it doesnât exist
So tell me why you keep crashing the party
No invitation but you canât resist
So tell me why you keep crashing the party

Hey, leech
Youâre living in a world of lies
Your life is fictional, so unpredictable
Hey, leech
Please tell me how your story ends
Your life is fictional, so unpredictable

Run motherfucker, itâs time to hide
You will bury yourself in a grave of lies
Youâre so delusional, yea
Festering your only hope 
And watch from below as the truth unfolds
Youâre so delusional, yea

Nobodyâs listening, nobody cares
Nobodyâs listening, nobody,
Nobody cares

[Chorus]

Nobodyâs listening, nobody cares
Nobodyâs listening, âcause nobody cares

[Chorus x2]
