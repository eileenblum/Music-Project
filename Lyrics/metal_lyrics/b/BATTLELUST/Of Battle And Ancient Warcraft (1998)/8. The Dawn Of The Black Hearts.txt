The war against god has now begun
swords slashing throats is heard all around
feeble white armies crushed and destroyed
heavenly palaces burned to the ground
angels of death come ride with me
come see my sword make christians bleed
blackstorms of hate comes tumbling down
this is the twilight of your precious god

Kneel before my throne you fools
I am the god almighty now
your holy god, his head removed
the dawn of the black hearts has arrived

Holy churches burned by hellish flames
the blackest light shall burn again
my heart is cold and filled with hate
my eyes sees red on holy life
I've raised a fortress coloured black
I've gained the powers of ancient might
embraced by the black flames of eternity
this is the dawn of the black hearts

With powers over the storms
and the beasts of the earth
I am the one who shall walk in darkness......
Forever!
