Ahh! the smell of morning! the break of day,
the peaceful silence brought dreams to my sleep
a distance cry awakens me
I realize this is the last I'll hear
an respectful warlord I have become
put fear in heart in every man
people used to call my name with joy
now they just freeze in panic or run away

it has come to my knowledge
that some people wants to see me dead
what is that sound I hear?
Someone's coming I can hear the steps
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
I feel a knife slice through my flesh
my mortal life have come to it's very end
now starts my journey on the path straight down to hell

HAHA! Do you think you can kill me?
I shall return and with me the powers of darkness
where only creatures of the night exists
shall never be taken away by the hands of light
but live on forever into the infinity
