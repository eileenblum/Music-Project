These fields have become my legacy
by ancient gods been given chains
free me now or fear forever
Dissemblers! These bonds of temperance soon unsealed

I greet thee masters of distopia
enchant me with your immortal grace
I bid you welcome to this gathering
who knows what the night brings?
Thunder lightning strike the earth
frost and blizzards come for me
storms of hatred tear the skies apart
fire clench both land and sea
limbs and coprses scattered everywhere
the smell of death lies in the air
this is my birthplace, this will be my grave
who ever enters shall by my sword be slain
