The blizzard roars into the night
the howling wolves cry to the moon
the dawn will never shine again
the northlands is where I shall reign

The war against god is close to it's end
the blackest of lights shall win again
the armies of god will lie dead on the ground
all that is missing is the head of jesus christ

Dark as black and black as night
far away form holy light
snow and ice and demonmight
blackened creatures, gorgeous site

The war against god is close to it's end
the blackest of lights shall win again
the armies of god will lie dead on the ground
all that is missing is the head of jesus christ

Swear allegiance to me your lord
and I will grant you might forlorn
fly with the winds and run with the wolves
this is a place where evil rules

The war against god is close to it's end
the blackest of lights shall win again
the armies of god will lie dead on the ground
all that is missing is the head of jesus christ
