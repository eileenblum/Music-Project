Rise
On my fate

Hey! Name of DOUSAGE MASQUERADE
(that) you can't hide enough
-the wad under mask-
will face your note on purpose

I never believe
your formal looks, your smiley eyes, your honesty mouth..
you play the kindley man!

We need to gaze the order
-your exploit-
I know it's seed of fire
and seems wicked flover
I ask...how to go...
Whereabouts does people turn?
Back the warth!
(a) matter leaves it into chaos

What is right? What is wrong?
I own my fate
no more pride..no more lie..justice,paradise..
silverline leads me to the neverland
one side of mind (and) one side of mind
blast and wag the sides

The bridge is the sign of lit getup till the taint wake
--wail to violence--
manipulater (and) agetation make money and take power
don (of) fiction teaches from malrips
"Cordinaters hide in mask"
turn back the warth
(my) eyes set for overflash

Continue the sail of disorder
we'll see the bleeding sky
no one find way for this world
oh, mother cry...
