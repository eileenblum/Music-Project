--Someday..someway...--
somebody crying
--sometime..someday..--
call my woe..

Why do you smite your grief?
Are you all right?
--damned toll's tone--
your smile is despoiled as you fail make-up
--is your all birthday--
why do you prime your fleece?
are you all right?
--can fights count down (for) sail?--
your smile despoiled as you feel seasick

"can't stop a stained crime"
no way..we're killing each other...
your conjurer dispraises the summer (of) real ice
realize! before the end of breakdown

--we lost a dilemma--
you bet! a spaceship has a shaver!
--a forward lady and spirit--
it's time for sailing away!

why do you slide my dream?
are you all right?
--no waited sunrise--
you waited (for) sailing weather as i'm still waiting

"can't stop a stained rime"
realize! before the end of breakdown

--we lost a defence--
watching! a spaceship in the corner!
--you liked to preach in the sin..damn..--
no way! the big wave is coming!
--your darling covered your soul--
you bet! a spaceship has a shaver!
--you liked a mother wild oat--
it's time for sailing away!

"can't stop a dawn to gray"
we search halo

we're killing each other

"can't stop a night storm"
we search halo
don't worry...
far away..
