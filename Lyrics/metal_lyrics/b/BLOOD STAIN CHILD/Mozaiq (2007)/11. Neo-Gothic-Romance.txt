My sense in your mind
All of my heart
My life is streaming in your memories
I live in your dream

I am here
My home
Wonderful starry sky
True blue Mother Earth
I am floating

Here is a pitch-dark space
Nothing..
Still...Still...I'm alive
Life=Hope
I find the possibility
Time is eternal
Life is a moment
Light passes in the space
