When a lump of sugar melted
consciousness was regained
resting was hard work..

coz here was the only whereabouts
a pitch black room
it satisfied me
i was on a high like gettings cracks

it was scared to strain my eyes
all smeed to loathe me
there was no change
the sky had no change

i was falling on my head
i've sustained it anytime
i couldnt take it anymore

you got that right
the hole in my mind is not buried indefinitely
wasted life
i regret it like fury
still I wish...

what have you done!
nobody else had words to chasten
nobody listened my heart
nobody else had words to chasten my mind

everyday...anytime..
i'm walking in desire
i'm walking a cry..

still I wish
(in) a pitch black room..
