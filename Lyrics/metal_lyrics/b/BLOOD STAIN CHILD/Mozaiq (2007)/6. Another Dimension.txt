You're ready to break up the zone

dawn--isolation
pain--contradiction
lag--run away from world of reality

whine--whited went to war
cry--never hope
prey--preys start new generation

earth--tie up for the man
time--wail to revenge

high tech--plastic future
passing-super ancient
sky--bug scribes project the sky

the sky lost silence

the voice's arousing noize
--shining lighted night--
it makes black deep shadow at the corner

a glow of the heart
forgot that story of guilty site
system is the slave of desire
drive and run in the air of the wall of beyond

running! everybody goes a promiseland
in the darkness, call a name guided by my sounds
running! everybody goes a promiseland
with sliding this storm
running! everybody goes a promiseland
remember memories sealed in the piece of mind

beyond the wall!

do not take us a fall into the pit!
