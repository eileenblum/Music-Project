Into the wave
We are the one
Sail to the light
Beyond the tear of time

Over the space
Look at the star
Until the end
Seeking new ground

Life it is only one
You only live once
In this world
Time
It is endless place
Are we humans alone in this space?

Fly high
It is destiny
Wake up dream
In the boring my day
To the unexplored sky
For the Earth

Into the wave
We are the one
Sail to the light
Beyond the tear of time

I do not know when people will die
And go for it
Keep going
Under dark
Believe in yourself
Wake up mind
Open you eyes

Into the wave
We are the one
Sail to the light
Beyond the tear of time

Wake up the time is right
