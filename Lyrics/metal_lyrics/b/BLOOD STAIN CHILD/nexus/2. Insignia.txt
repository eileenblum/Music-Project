Rise above

We must notice it
å´©ããã life
We don't know the future
We don't know history
Re back ä¸å¯ rade
Waste time go around

Twilight of planet fade away
Gate of the destruction
Before you see nothing
This is your life

Before the fall
Wake up
To the paradise
é²åã®calling

Behind the cloud
Find out
To the advance

Ever light

We must reconsider
for é¸ãã§æªæ¥
We have no time
We can't stop in our life
ãããµãã rail
Fly high for yourself

Time waits for no one
Don't stop
Forsake your bad addiction
Before you feel nothing
This is your life

Beyond the fate
Fly high
To the universe

Rise run for the bright victory
Fly high
The sunrise come again
Find out the destination
No more wastin' time

Before the fall
Wake up
To the paradise

Behind the cloud
Find out
To the advance
