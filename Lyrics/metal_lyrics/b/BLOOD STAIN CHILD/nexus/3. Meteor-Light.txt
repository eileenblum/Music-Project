Ever blue light
We find the light
Gazing the starry sky
Life
We cry out in this broken world
Calling the your true mind
Wowow in deep
Across the many time
Give it some brave

Break up the wall of everything
With us ever more
If you open your mind
Space answer tomorrow
Over the shinning star
Ever more and ever more
To the light
Just keep on going now

Blind days
Wake up your mind
Night silence
We must stand on the here
Break 
Cry out in this deep world
Just believe
Fly to the holy sky
Wowow in life

Across the many time
Give it some rave
Ride on your true mind
Overflow spark emotion
Shooting the sadness
And nightmare ever more

Walk on the road of wasteland
To find the light
It maybe take long time
However we'll fight
Over the rising sun
Ever more and ever more
To the light
Just keep on going now

è¦ up to æ°¸ä¹ã® scale
å£ã don't lie ææ¥ rise

Break up the wall of everything
With us ever more
If you open your mind
Space answer tomorrow
Over the shinning star
Ever more and ever more
To the light
Just keep on going now

Walk on the road of wasteland
To find the light
It maybe take long time
However we'll fight
Over the rising sun
Ever more and ever more
To the light
Just keep on going now
