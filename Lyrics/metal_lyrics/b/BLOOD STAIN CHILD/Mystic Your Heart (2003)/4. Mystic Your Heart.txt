I will stay here forever
You are always by my side
Whenever I casually see you
I always peep into the depth of your eyes

What are you thinking now baby?
Encuragement of you supports me
With shinings in your pure eyes

YouÂ´ll remain as you are now
I hold you in my arms all the time
With shinings in your pure heart

Mystic your heart

You arent perfect
But your honesty and purity enamor me
Although we run up against walls
I can go over them with you together

I cant leave you baby

Mystic your heart

You arent perfect
But your honesty and purity enamor me
Although we run up against walls
I can go over them with you together

I cant leave you baby...
