I see your face from this lake
IÂ´m dweller in the other world

Have you still remembered me?
If my whereabouts arenÂ´t in your memory

I perish entirely
Wait a few minutes!
I canÂ´t go to your side

Untill my heart is absolute and vice vanishes

Does parting alienate our heart?
Do you know the promise at that time?

I perish entirely
Wait a few minutes!
I canÂ´t go to your side

Although we where ignorant
Our heart should be seen through

I want to hear your voice everyday...
