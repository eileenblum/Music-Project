As usual mornings lead me
IÂ´m born into the white light
With the same light flowing and aroma full
I go on a trip to the Everlasting

People show the same look
It keeps up
The fear to things varied from the world

The present condition will be unchanged
Even if I cause something alone
I donÂ´t care a hang about silly looks flowing into me
IÂ´m just myself whatever people may say

ItÂ´s not too late now to reflect on ourselfs again

People show the same look
It keeps up
The fear to things varied from the world

The present condition will be unchanged
Even if I cause something alone
I donÂ´t care a hang about silly looks flowing into me
IÂ´m just myself whatever people may say
