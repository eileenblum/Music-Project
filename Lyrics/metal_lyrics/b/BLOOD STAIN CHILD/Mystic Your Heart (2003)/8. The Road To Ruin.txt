In the apparently peaceful world
Towns are crowded with people and cars everywhere
No one notice and see that saftey always doesnÂ´t assure

Murders are everyday occurrance
Now they go on...
Crimes and disputes never die out

The world that perfect peace is not
Turns the desire of people into chaos

We and wars live side by side
We donÂ´t know when to die
The reliance of the world in nuclear warhead
ItÂ´s symbol of military strength
Humans beings voluntarly choose the road to ruin

Murders are everyday occurrance
Now they go on...
Crimes and disputes never die out

We and wars live side by side
We donÂ´t know when to die
The reliance of the world in nuclear warhead
ItÂ´s symbol of military strength
