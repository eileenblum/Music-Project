With half conscius
Solitude call again
Usual morning that light doesnÂ´t come

You wanna die
In the world wrapped in madness
Life is cut off against the will
Do you face the condition?

Death is freedom
ItÂ´s dream of vacancy
Death has just extinguish you from the world
You will drop out in remembrance

You that donÂ´t have confidence in yourself
Think you are needless and such is you

Till your dying day, thereâs any likelihood
Have the courage to change your self

With half conscius
Solitude call again
Usual morning that light doesnÂ´t come

You wanna die
In the world wrapped in madness
Life is cut off against the will
Do you face the condition?

You that donÂ´t have confidence in yourself
Think you are needless and such is you
