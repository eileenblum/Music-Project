Madness rules
The shape folded by the fall
He emerges in the silent dark

Cut your hope, rob your dream and devour you all
You have been erouded body, thought and so on

It has advanced to the end without your conscious
Everyone loses his control

You calm if everything is the same with the other
It just clone
The life that you lose yourself goes on...

It has advanced to the end without your conscious
Everyone loses his control

Filthy people created this unclean society
The world that false leaders weave

You calm if everything is the same with the other
It just clone
The life that you lose yourself goes on...
