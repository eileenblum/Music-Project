Until when will technological progression continue?
Cars, planes, handyphone and sone where developed
Now the convinient period of web comes!

Shopping, encounter and
everything under the sun are on it
We canÂ´t obtain much information
about the world without web

Now the crimes using web increase
The development of technology
is propotional to the increase of the crimes

ItÂ´s unchangeable at every age
That crime shall never vanish
Thought of degenerated person
Humankind toward a downfall

Now the crimes using web increase
The development of technology
is propotional to the increase of the crimes
