Do you believe in God?
The end of hounded people is in dependence on God
The symbol of cowards and the weak

Suicide, drug addiction
How many people rely on them now?
They are no more than a loop hole

God doesnÂ´t give anything and save
The saving grace of God
ItÂ´s just wish in your side
Find your true way that you must go on
Open up a new vista of your life

Dont nestle to and rely on others!
Own everything means much to man
In your hour of need, yourself is one

God doesnÂ´t give anything and save
The saving grace of God
ItÂ´s just wish in your side
Find your true way that you must go on
Open up a new vista of your life
