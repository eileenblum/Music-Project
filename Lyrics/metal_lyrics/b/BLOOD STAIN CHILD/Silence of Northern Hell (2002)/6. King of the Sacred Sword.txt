I have seen all the wars since ancient
Corrupted, foolish wars
War of honor
War of glory
But nobody can get mighty sword
IÂ´m legend sword of God

I control holy mountain
Far beyond dash rancorous ancient sword
Weak, impure creature can not hold me
Under bleeding sky
Oh, last sun in ark

Worrior will visit for you someday
And hold you
Then your and fear s will win darkness on earth

Sacred warrior flourishes me
Legend of fight
Rise the wind
Burn your soul
(With) rage of ancient sword
