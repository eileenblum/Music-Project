Washed land, Cold blue wind
I feel flame of bloody rage
Deadly world, Darkest sky
My soul is burning in the silence

When I hold a sword of soul
Land, Ocean, Sky will be follow me
Kill this worldÂ´s evil hate
Take back holy light here again

When I get a mighty knowledge
The light comes in here
I fight bravely against the dark
and bring, Glory, Victory, Future

When I hold a sword of soul
Land, Ocean, Sky will be follow me
Kill this worldÂ´s evil hate
Take back holy light here again
