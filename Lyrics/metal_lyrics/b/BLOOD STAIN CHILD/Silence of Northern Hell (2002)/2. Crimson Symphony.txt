Status, humor and pride
How do you think of them
Insane persons chase them and die

Corruption grange spell binding
I rule all of them
I still your fall in soul
and cursed black blood(I call you)

Evil in pure and pride
ItÂ´s already what for you
donÂ´t be raped, dont be invade
Here crimson symphony

War if twilight
Cursed of hell unholy night
Run after you
War of darkness
I play the crimson symphony

What do you find in the madness
What do you find in the madness
Choose road to the advance
LightÂ´s donÂ´t exist on earth

War if twilight
Cursed of hell unholy night
Run after you
War of madness
I play the crimson, crimson symphony
