Strings of ice pierce me and
my body is stained red
IÂ´m exposed in dark sea and crucified
Now I can only play blind symphony
Nobody knows we on open my mind

I stand the hill of despair everyday
ThatÂ´s the place of sorrow
ThatÂ´s the place of grief
Angel of salvation doesnÂ´t sweep down
Unopened gates of Heaven
I can only pray

Rolling thunder rage of the wind
Greif is always by my side
I wish I could change the destiny
Give me mercy, give me mercy

IÂ´ll take back my wings sometime and
I want you call you I want you call you
