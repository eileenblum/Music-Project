To the isle of deadly shore
Shightless Countless Ageless
Torture to see a darkness kingdom
Storm and thunder and flame

Cursed concerto, immortal minuet
Faith and mercy gone astray
Rising death, rising blood
Kill with death scythe

To the land of last sun
Shightless Countless Ageless
Torture to rule holy kingdom
Call of fury and hate

I am God, I am king of the land
Charging steed through lands unkind
Legend forever
