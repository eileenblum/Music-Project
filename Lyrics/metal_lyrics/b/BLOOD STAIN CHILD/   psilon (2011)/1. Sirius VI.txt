Fly me to the rebirth

Riding the wind everlasting time
Stumbe upon a hidden sight
Unraveling mystery
Lighting up the core of your existence

Life
Do you know everything return to twilight
Time
Can I fly away from this world?

Shadows we bear nothing we breathe
Organized, chaotic history
Resonance of momentary life
In the course of evolution

Life
What do you pray for in the disintegration
Time
Can I find you in the new life?

Fly me to the end
Bring me your planet sign
Faster than the seventh sound
Lead me to your side

Balancing between unending time
And the biting irony of the universe
Existence beckons from behind the clouds
New star is born on a glimmer of hope

I wanna break this black spiral
This is the end. No own knows the spiral
How many stars in the distorted sky
Where is the new world?

Fly me to the end
Bring me your planet sign
Faster than the seventh sound
Love me
Sing this song

Riding the wind everlasting time
Stumble upon a hidden sight
Unraveling mystery
Lighting up the core of your existence

I wanna break this black spiral
This is the end. No own knows the spiral
How many stars in the distorted sky
Where is the new world?

Fly me to the end
Bring me your planet sign
Faster than the seventh sound
Lead me to your side
