Over the clouds
New world and blue silence
Spread before me
All the possibilities are there

So far away
Eternal spring over Elysium
Even if your surroundings are dark

You may open your eyes and breathe
I'm free and your free
The blue sky spreads out infinitely
Eternal light

So far away
Eternal spring over Elysium
Even if your surroundings are dark

Now rise and take my hand
As Lethe beckons, ending your torment
This sky accepts everything

Solitary love letters to an uncertain future
Colored by a cosmic joker's sense of reason
Life is not without hope, but each one of us is hopelessly human

Your just a shapeless, human mass
Crawling blind in empty space
Confront yourself your darkened face
Eternal light

Beyond the clouds
Harmonic space towards infinity
I may die so that you may live

Arise and breathe again
The sun in my eyes
Drying your rain away
Your heart shines surely sometimes

Spread your wings, fly away
Blissful light drawing, calling

Heaven in this sky

So far away
Eternal spring over Elysium
Even if your surroundings are dark

Now rise and take my hand
As Lethe beckons, ending your torment
This sky accepts everything

Beyond the clouds
Harmonic space towards infinity
I may die so that you may live

Arise and breathe again
The sun in my eyes
Drying your rain away
Your heart shines surely sometimes
