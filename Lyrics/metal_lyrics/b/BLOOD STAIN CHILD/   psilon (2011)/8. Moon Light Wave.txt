I cannot face this fallen world
Shall we all burn eternally?
I forsake the emptiness now
And throw myself in the air

What is your dream?
Your whisper and...

Everything will fade away
My heart unwise dryin' tears astray
In the light-wave
Every night I gaze at the silence in the sky

A virus called humanity
Shadows all reality
And in our weakness we drown
Tonight
Transparent blue and lines unplanned
You're like a girl in the wonderland

Where is your dream?
You asked me and...

Everything will fade away
My heart unwise dryin' tears astray
In the light-wave
Every night I gaze at the silence in the sky

Love is crawling, find a way
Your heart like this moon light wave
In the Rave day
Every time I feel that moonlight fade away

Everything will fade away
My heart unwise dryin' tears astray
In the light-wave
Every night I gaze at the silence in the sky

Love is crawling, find a way
Your heart like this moon light wave
In the Rave day
Every time I feel that moonlight fade away
