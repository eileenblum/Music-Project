We ran to the place of our dreams
Grasping the meaning of life
As we breathed
And the times that we shared
Linger on now and forever

We ran after glorious dreams
Following your steady sound
Powerfully
And the melody carved
In our hearts now and forever

We ran after glorious dreams
Following your steady sound
Powerfully
And the melody carved
In our hearts now and forever

Heavy rain and sunshine we walked through
We cherish your dream and make it true
Although time is not going back...
