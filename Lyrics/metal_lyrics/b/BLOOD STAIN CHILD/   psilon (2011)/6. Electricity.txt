Run away fly away
Dream away slip away
Weep away sweep away
Reaching out for the stars

All your love All your hate
All your sickness your fake
Tiny minds I devour
Dyin' a little inside

My ambition decisions
Illusions my arrows
Go high in the sky
Challenging Destiny
I'm a voice in the desert
Do you here me now?

Crawling shadows
Haunting my sleep
Keep on breathing
Wake up

Run away fly away
Dream away slip away
Weep away sweep away
Reaching out for the stars

My ambition decisions
Illusions my arrows
Go high in the sky
Challenging Destiny

Crawling shadows
Haunting my sleep
Keep on breathing
Wake up

Sudden acceleration
Fading gravity
Radiant transmissions
Electricity
Rising up from beyond
I can feel your heartbeat
Stretching out your hand
I knew you'd try to find me

Crawling shadows
Haunting my sleep
Keep on breathing
Wake up

Run away fly away
Dream away slip away
Weep away sweep away
Reaching out for the stars

All your love All your hate
All your sickness your fake
Tiny minds I devour
Dyin' a little inside

My ambition decisions
Illusions my arrows
Go high in the sky
Challenging Destiny
I'm a voice in the desert
Do you here me now?
