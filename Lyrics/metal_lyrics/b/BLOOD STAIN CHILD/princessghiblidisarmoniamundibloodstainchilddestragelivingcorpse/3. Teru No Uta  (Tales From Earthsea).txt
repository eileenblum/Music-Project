[feat. Blood Stain Child &amp; Ettore Rigotti]Yuuyami semaru kumo no ue
Itsumo ichiwa de tondeiru
Taka wa kitto kanashikarou
Oto mo todaeta kaze no naka
Sora o tsukanda sono tsubasa
Yasumeru koto wa dekinakute

Kokoro o nani ni tatoeyou
Taka no youna kono kokoro
Kokoro o nani ni tatoeyou
Sora o mau yona samishisa o

Ame no sobofuru iwakage ni
Itsumo chiisaku saiteiru
Hana wa kitto setsunakarou
Iro mo kasunda ame no naka
Usu momoiro no hanabira o
Medetekureru te mo nakute

Kokoro o nani ni tatoeyou
Hana no youna kono kokoro
Kokoro o nani ni tatoeyou
Ame ni utareru setsunasa o

Hitokage taeta no no michi o
Watashi to tomo ni ayunderu
Anata mo kitto samishikarou
Mushi no sasayaku kusahara o 
Tomo ni michiyuku hito dakedo
Taete monoiu koto mo naku

Hitokage taeta no no michi o
Watashi to tomo ni ayunderu
Anata mo kitto samishikarou
Mushi no sasayaku kusahara o 
Tomo ni michiyuku hito dakedo
Taete monoiu koto mo naku

Kokoro o nani ni tatoeyou
Hitori michiyuku kono kokoro
Kokoro o nani ni tatoeyou
Hitoribocchi no samishisa o

[English translation:]

Above the clouds where dusk comes
Always flying by itself
The hawk is probably grieving is it not
In the wind's midst even sound stops
The wings that grasp the sky
Resting is a thing they cannot do

To what compares the heart?
This heart that is like a hawk
To what compares the heart?
Of grief that seems to circle the sky

In boulder's shadow near falling rain
Always blossoming small
The flower is probably sad is it not
In the rain's midst even colour finishes
Of lightly peach-coloured petals
Without a hand to love them

To what compares the heart?
This heart that is like a flower
To what compares the heart?
Of sadness struck by rain

Hitokage taeta no no michi o
Watashi to tomo ni ayunderu
Anata mo kitto samishikarou
Mushi no sasayaku kusahara o 
Tomo ni michiyuku hito dakedo
Taete monoiu koto mo naku

On a rustic road shadows disappear
With me together you walk
You are probably lonely too are you not
Of grassy plains where insects cry
I go the road with you human though I am
You that disappears without a word

To what compares the heart?
This heart that goes the road alone
To what compares the heart?
Of the loneliness of being all alone
