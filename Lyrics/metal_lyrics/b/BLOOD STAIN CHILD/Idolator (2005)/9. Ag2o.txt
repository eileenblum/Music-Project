Why does human race
Keep fighting?
Arrogance, desire, status
It hates each other

And one another
Is killed each other
What on earth
Remain afterwards?

No war
Sadness on killed side
Sadness on killed side
No war
Sadness on killed side
Sadness on killed side
Space is wide
Endless space
No war
(yeah, oh, yeah)
Yeah

Though it is same man
Commander say "we"
Do you kill only by the command?
You kill because friends were killed

Then it doesn't
Chance whenever it
Becomes it, how does it
Come to fight only for myself?

Space is wide
Endless space
No war
(no war, no war)
The spiral staircase
The spiral staircase
The spiral staircase
The spiral staircase
This world
This world

Space is wide
Endless space
No war
(no war, no war)
The spiral staircase
The spiral staircase
The spiral staircase
The spiral staircase
This world
This world
