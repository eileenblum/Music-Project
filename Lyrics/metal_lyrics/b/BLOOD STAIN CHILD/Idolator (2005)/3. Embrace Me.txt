I donÂ´t know how to touch you in the voicless , sensless , blind world
The whole place is black and white landscape
I live the same world as you do in the eternal time
I wish for the end of time I wish for the end...
IÂ´ll sing for you...
Love me.. Save me... Hold me... I donÂ´t leave leave your side
Lead me... Bring me... Take me... Close to your heart
The same sky , earth , air , I feel them as
Still , IÂ´m apt to be controlled by loneliness I try to break a wall
There isnÂ´t what we must not break It is created thing all what we can see
Love me.. Save me... Hold me... I donÂ´t leave leave your side
Lead me... Bring me... Take me... Close to your heart
Love me.. Save me... Hold me... I donÂ´t leave leave your side
Lead me... Bring me... Take me... Close to your heart
I wish for the end of time Fallen love...
