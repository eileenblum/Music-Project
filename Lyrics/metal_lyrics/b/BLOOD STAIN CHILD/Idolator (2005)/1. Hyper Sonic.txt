...from nothing soul; nothing core; nothing place.
...from nothing word; nothing light; nothing.
I'm crushing wall; crushing vice; crushing crime.
I'm crushing madness; crushing jade; crushing fate.

So never lie; never lost; never end.
So never does and I'm flying through the space.
Never fall; never stop; never down.
Never burst; I'm flying just like... wind.

I'm waiting for a breakup.
Where is my sight? I kick this realize.
I can get feeling now. Cry no more.

I want live; I want breathe; I want feel your heart.
Where is my mind? Life is empty.
I try to find out. To your side.
I want live; I want breathe; I want feel your heart.

No more lie down; no more kill.
I stand not crawling not falling down.
No more pain; no more decrease.
I'll just be living my own life.

I'm waiting for a breakup.
Where is my sight? I kick this realize.
I can get feeling now. Cry no more.

I want live; I want breathe; I want feel your heart.
Where is my mind? Life is empty.
I try to find out. To your side.
I want live; I want breathe; I want feel your heart.
