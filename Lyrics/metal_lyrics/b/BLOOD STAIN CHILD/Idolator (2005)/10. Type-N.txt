You have confidence in your it
Awaking of man
Heroic existence
Special ability in the space

People envy your it
Disgraceful sight
Innumerable thousands desires
Flow into you

You go on suffer from it
Ace is solitude
You can run away from reality
But the time needs you

Still, you can't die
Only you can do
Only you can do
Only you can do
Only you can do
Fate

We must trust and face each other
You have nothing to worry about
You have to do
Only you can do
You have to do
Only you can do

(break) (the hateful world)
(hateful world) (hateful world)

Breaking the hateful world
Breaking the hateful world

You have the place
To which it should still return
There are those who are waiting for you
Still, you can die

(break) (the hateful world)
(hateful world) (hateful world)

Breaking the hateful
Breaking the hateful world
Break
