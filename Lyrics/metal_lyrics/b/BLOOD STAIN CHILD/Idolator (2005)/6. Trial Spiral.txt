Yeah

I access your circuit
It's the world only of you
Light and shadow that lurks in the inner core

By yourself of your definition
You whom other stare defining
It greatly passes each other at time

You produce your many pseudo-bodies
And conceal yourself
The world and the mind aren't necessarily the same

What's truth and what's truth in the lie?
Same face in this world
It's world you think, draw imagination

(You may not think about anything)
You conceal the lie
You conceal the truth
In yourself

In the silence field, my life
In the silence field, my hollow heart
In the silence field, my life
(My life, my breath, my sight)
I'm so blind

(You may not think about anything)
You conceal the lie
You conceal the truth
In yourself

In the silence field, my life
In the silence field, my hollow heart
In the silence field, my life
(My life, my breath, my sight)
I'm so blind

In the silence field, my life
In the silence field, my hollow heart
In the silence field, my life
(My life, my breath, my sight)
I'm so blind
Sight, I'm so blind
