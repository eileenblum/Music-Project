You control your body
Mechanized system
Brain in the shell
Soul and spirit is there

World ruled by electron
The desire is made an
Embodiment and material
The android has the world

The truth is projected
And reality is created
You fly away again
A new gate is opened

Gravity of scenario
Various visions flow
Into inside

Light you inside
You fly away into inside
Faith you inside
Trusting your soul
Beyond deep your sight
Stand alone, you dive to inside
Cyber your thought
Justice you trust

The temptation runs
View is narrowed at the time
And it invites you
Brain in the shell
Souls and spirit is there
You believe the soul
Into inside
Faith

You fly away into inside
Lasting, you fly again
You fly away into inside
You believe the soul

Light you inside
You fly away into inside
Faith you inside
Trusting your soul
Beyond deep your sight
Stand alone, you dive to inside
Cyber your thought
Justice you trust

Go

Faith you inside
Faith you inside

Light you inside
You fly away into inside
Faith you inside
Trusting your soul
Beyond deep your sight
Stand alone, you dive to inside
Cyber your though
Justice you trust

Light you inside
You fly away into inside
Faith you inside
Faith you inside
Light you inside
Light you inside
Light you inside
Faith
