Dear bad feelings, I'd say I'm through with you
Leave this body, go and find someone new,
Or retire, you've got no practical use,
We show up flawed at the perfection assembly,
Free handouts for the student bodies trembling
You can't teach a lesson on a subject that you've never experienced
And you can't just write off these nightmares likes it's a coincidence, it is not
With high fives, and back slaps, the stories they reenact,
Now tell me, and be exact, how bad you want your virginity back,
Disappointed treasure seekers dig a hold in your face,
You can live with my strangers and the gallery opening is never
Sure as the sun rises at dawn I thought that bird would always sing to me,
But this morning was a silent brick to the face dose of reality,
Not another album soaked with liquor and gimmicks
You see it streams from my grey matter and I just spit it
Like broken knuckles courtesy bar fight
Another souvenir of the New York night life
