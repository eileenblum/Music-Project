This lethal spacecraft makes crash landings on the beach,
And our bodies dehydrate like earthworms in the summer heat,
Articulate reptilians pull the bodies from eroding shores,
Articulate reptilians won't wallow in the mud anymore,
Vanish we will, notice you won't, we'll pioneer the atmosphere,
Ambitious thoughts get put aside,
Street urchins with nowhere to hide,
Like arbitrary stimulation matters anyway,
When they're onto you, they're onto you,
They nursed us back to health with help from public slaves,
We danced all night and feasted on invertebrates,
So we'll remain here and blame it on the intense gravitational pull
