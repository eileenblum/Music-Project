Here is an inside joke but you're all on the outs,
And that's what we're about so don't try to get in,
All fresh at the controls, stretching out these bars,
So all your hips can move and shake with the dance part,
The quickest of fixes to nurse my needs, lets survey the options,
We all know opinions are like addictions, everyone's got one,
See me you just might go home and pick a fight
Then we can rack and write without any backlash,
Another inside joke and your still on the outs,
That's what we're about so don't try to get in,
Don't push me because I'm close to self destructing,
Lets hope all these come ups don't end too abruptly,
Getting over is a nightly ritual
So keep those late nights coming with photo albums full
