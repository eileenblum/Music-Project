Old west, couch bound and reaching for the reset,
Sure bet, ten to win on "sorry's not an option",
We get paychecks to help support the habit,
In debt, it's all part of the process,
We hate when conversation gets the back seat
To the cold cold coldest shoulder and you're left in full retreat,
Hey room, I think we ought to separate pretty soon,
I've been stuck, it's like the way the waves depend upon the moon,
Shit luck, that's an excuse that we've been known to use,
Enough, this botched rhyme scheme has seen enough abuse
