Droves of civilians play into the plan,
It's a shame mediocrity is in demand,
With short-dime demeanor so clumsy my hands,
Hold on for one more phrase,
Lets be honest, be honest, this has got to stay off limits,
If we can't take these headaches that are bound to come with it,
Just say the word and I'll come to your coast,
I'll be the virus if you'll be the host,
Bore dumb defense for the absentee ghost,
Just slightly out of range,
It comes and goes but for the most part it's just not as bad as you once thought,
It starts to show, it feels like all of these braves thoughts are so fucking store bought
