I have to be careful with what I say
I'm feeling dreadfully honest and I might give too much away
The truth is best kept secret when the secret will cause you pain
To confess it with some clichÃ© lyric, well wouldn't that be such a waste
Show me something that is free from traps and drawbacks,
They've all got the sense of confusion,
But some more pronounced than they'd like to let known,
And the problem with living in general
You can make the effort and find your own direction
But if you lose anymore weight they are going to start asking questions
Maybe they're a shortage of ways to pass the time
You keep washing down those P.M.s with the blood of the vine
Now I've seen the logic behind your decision
It makes me feel remorseful like a born-again in prison
With a quick confession you start with a clean slate
If your gods that much of a push over then I guess you'll be OK
Show me something permanent and I will show you dissolution
I know that's sounding miserable but
That's just the impression I've got
