It went like this, pistol Pete packed his bag and he split
He said "It's so hot and we might cave in"
So thanks for letting me crash back jump Justin
We struck again
And I'll be waiting up for no show Joe
Hanging with the smoked out savior
Seven taught me how to flow, we're on ill behavior,
You try to play it casual, let me know how far that gets you,
The bad seed Danny joins the navy eight,
And the workers always roll too late
You know that we'll be gone without a trace, not guilty
You try to play it casual, let me know how far that gets you,
You try to play it casual, I'm talking about the favoritism
It happens when you're in the loop,
And you'll be dancing to disintegration
And if the dean says that you're expelled
You know that I'll be voting reinstatement
