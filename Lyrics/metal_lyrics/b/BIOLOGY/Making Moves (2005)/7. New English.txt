I'd have to say we came a long way from the island,
It was a scene it was a drunken mess,
Now do you really miss what we left,
It may seem scripted like a movie,
How they pay me to sing about what moves me,
So we act the part and wait,
We wait for our big break,
A nervous gent abusive gem another trip to the Jave.,
The lines are hot exhale your lung with something we call the fresh new English tongue,
It may seem scripted like a movie,
But it drains me, the inconsistent jewel thief,
So we act the part and wait,
We wait for our big break,
You stepped on my tiny lines but I'll let it slide,
And their sorrows on display,
Is it such a shock when you see it's all been fake
