Will this discontent breed progression or insanity,
At least I'll have something to outlive my body,
Through the city we wonder like a dog without a collar,
I'm the same sword swallower, not much has changed,
Takers that vomits lines from dead philosophers,
But your vocab doesn't quite match your posture,
Through the city we wonder like dogs without collars,
I'm the same sword swallower, not much has changed,
And we won't be impressed by pseudo intellect,
We won't fall for that,
We won't carry paperbacks as props and never crack the cover,
We won't fall for that,
Contrived sophistication is a parasitic invasion,
When you've got no imagination, prosthetic humans,
Through the city we wonder like dogs without collars,
I'm the same sword swallower, I just keep on moving
