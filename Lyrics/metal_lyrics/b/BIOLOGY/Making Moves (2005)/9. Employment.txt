Please check your ego at the door
We gather to embrace our flaws, no corrections,
See I can write romantic songs,
But one on one I get it wrong, every time
Youth is a waste and wisdom comes too late,
An ambulance lights up the street,
So much for keeping it discreet, just deny
While spectators line the block
Now might be the best time to stop, and start over
