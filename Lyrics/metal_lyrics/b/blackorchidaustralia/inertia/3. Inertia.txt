Inertia - Your great illusion
Inertia - Do you deny?

Here I stand on my own - Defeated?
Alone in my pain my remorse - Conceited?
Disowned from a world of dispassion

Incomplete in disbelief...

Do you feel the need to betray all
With your pathetic display?
No need to defend your disdain

Incomplete in disbelief...
In-between a bitter lie...

In defeat you relish the lie you conceived in time
Do you perceive everything you create will be believed?

Through it all you portray 
A bittersweet display
Hidden from this world 
You deny those beside you

Blinded by your pride you forget who held you so high    
Years between - For what was it worth, if nothing else?  
Do you feel the right to deprive those who carried you?
Never forget all that was given - Selflessly driven         

Stay through pain your agony 
Intoxicate the fear
Withstanding all between
Cut loose the ties in betrayal

Will you awake from your lies?
Decided by those you despise
Detest this grim reprise 
Wipe clean your conscience - Fate will decide...

Fade - Memories fade in time, nothing but time
Fade - Memories cascade through it all the downfall, you deny your greatest flaw! 

Who are you to use, to consume and abuse?
Censor and confuse, conceit and delude
Hidden from the truth you obsess and pursue 
Nothing left to prove, everything to lose

Never to comply you confess your desire
Resist and deny, never to confide 
Distort every lie to pervert and defile 
Nothing left to lose, everything to prove

Silence bleeding fate deceiving
Lost belief in a world of delusion
Silence bleeding fate deceiving
Lost belief - This time you will see...

Inertia - Your great illusion
Inertia - Do you deny?
Inertia - Your great illusion
Inertia - Can you deny?
Inertia - This grand illusion
Inertia - This time your lies denied
