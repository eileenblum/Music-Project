âThe years teach much which the days never knowâ*

Tempus Aeturnus

Time is like a lit fuse
It burns it sears eludes
Deprive and consume
To feel its grasp clench like a vice

Time and time I feel denied
Of all that was and is yet to be
The Ebb and flow of all bestowed
Will time align this fragile design?

Do you feel times flow, its energy - Endlessly?
Do we know the bane of mortality?

Time eternal - Time is ever beside you
Time eternal - Time in time will reveal all
Time eternal - Time is ever beside you
Time eternal - Time in time does deceive all

Tempus Aeturnus

Time is life's greatest lie
It takes forgets defies
All memories transpire
In time forgive and learn to grieve

To live to die conceive desire to love for all eternity
The heart and soul of all betrothed to freely dream incessantly
To feel to breath the air the sea to live this life in harmony
The pendulum will swing again and time moves forward endlessly

Do you feel times flow, its energy - Endlessly?
Do we know the bane of mortality?

Time eternal - Time is ever beside you
Time eternal - Time in time will reveal all
Time eternal - Time is ever beside you
Time eternal - Time in time does deceive all (in time)

Time and time I feel denied
Of all that was and is yet to be
The Ebb and flow of all bestowed
Will time align this fragile design?

Do you feel times flow, its energy - Endlessly?
Do we know the bane of mortality?

Time eternal - Time is ever beside you
Time eternal - Time in time will reveal all
Time eternal - Time is ever beside you
Time eternal - Time in time does deceive all
