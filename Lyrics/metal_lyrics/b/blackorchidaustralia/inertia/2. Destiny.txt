[Music &amp; Lyrics by Justin Hartwig]

"I feel, therefore I am"*

Oceans apart endless dreaming
A freedom alas do I yearn
This journey my soul does believe in

My soul yearns until the end...

Led by desire drawn by passion
A fire alight yet no flame
Illusions of grandeur behind me

I hold this fate in my hand...

I feel, therefore I am - Of mortal existence
I feel, therefore I am - A soul to be free

Fearlessly driven conviction
To stumble would be but a crime
Infinite vigor does guide me

Fearless, I follow benign...

Life my eternal companion
This journey I traverse afar
I will follow this path to determine

Destiny's twilight aligned...

I feel, therefore I am - Of mortal existence
I feel, therefore I am - My soul to be free

Depart from all you feel and time will surely yield
The canvas of your soul - All that is bestowed
Life's greatest mystery this time shall unveil
Destiny's grand illusion

[Chorus]

All that I want is my heart to be free...
Carry my soul through this night until the end
All that I need is this heart to believe...
A new day will dawn and my heart will be freed
Destiny - Is it all in vain?

[Solos]

I feel, therefore I am - Of mortal existence
I feel, therefore I am - Onward the struggle in time we discover a life filled with hope and despair...

All that I want is my heart to be free...
Carry my soul through this night until the end
All that I need is this heart to believe...
A new day will dawn and our hearts will be freed
Destiny - Is it all in vain?

[Quote: Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)*]
