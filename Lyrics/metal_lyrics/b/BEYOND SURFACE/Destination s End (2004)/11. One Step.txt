Returning home
And no one's there
I didn't realize you've left
All the things that we'd been through
I'm helpless, what can I do?

Waving goodbye the dreams I had
What stays is just regret
No one can take all the blame

And every step I take
Is one step too far away
This is the final word
It can't get any worse
Oh darling, if I knew
Your heart was torn in two
There's nothing I can do
To make you stay

There are secrets in the past
It all went out too fast
To find someone like you
Seemed to be against all odds

I hope we'll find someday
A place for us to stay
No one can take all my fears

And every step I take
Is one step too far away
This is the final word
It can't get any worse
Oh darling, if I knew
Your heart was torn in two
There's nothing I can do
To make you stay
