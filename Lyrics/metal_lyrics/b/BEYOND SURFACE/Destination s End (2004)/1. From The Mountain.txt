Trying to find a way to you
Trying to walk it without you
Weren't you the one who set me free?

Holding the silence in my arms
Keeping the sadness in my heart
In this far landscape I see no harm

That's from the mountain
Into the sea
That's just the distance
Between you and me

That's from the mountain
Into the sea
That's just the distance
Between you and me

Falling into the black unknown
Falling into this life so cold
Where there's no more time for dying for

Breaking the circles I've been through
I see the places we've been to
And remember all things with a smile
But it got so hollow

That's from the mountain
Into the sea
That's just the distance
Between you and me

That's from the mountain
Into the sea
That's just the distance
Between you and me

That's from the mountain
Into the sea
That's just the distance
Between you and me

That's from the mountain
Into the sea
That's just the distance
Between you and me

That's from the mountain
Into the sea
That's just the distance
Between you and me

From the mountain
You and me
