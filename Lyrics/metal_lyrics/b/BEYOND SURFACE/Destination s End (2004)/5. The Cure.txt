It's a frightening lonely time
No lonely heart to find
Where I scare myself in vain again

So I tried and I tried and I tried
But I'm wasting all my time
I know that I have failed
Sometimes

There were times when all was fine
But you can't be here tonight
Broken pieces of my heart
Now they're calling and calling

This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely

When you left my world to find
Some better lovely times
You put me in this pain again

Then I started to realize
Those funny ways of life
Where I wonder what mankind can do

There were times when all was fine
But you can't be here tonight
Broken pieces of my heart
Now they're calling and calling

This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely

This is the cure

This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
This is the cure
And I won't get lonely
