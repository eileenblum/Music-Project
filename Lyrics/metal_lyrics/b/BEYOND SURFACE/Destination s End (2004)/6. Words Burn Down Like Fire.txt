You say you're needing time
Just let the time pass by
I can't stand waiting for you so long

To hold you by my side
Is like thousand torches light
I can't stand seeing you in pain

Forgive the things I said
And I won't be far away
The words burn down like fire
And I won't be far away

The clouds are coming down
To fill my heart with hate
I'm just an empty soul
Who begs for more

And now you're far away
The wind has taken you there
I can't reach you, I'm trapped
Under the sea

Forgive the things I said
And I won't be far away
The words burn down like fire
And I won't be far
(Won't be)
Forgive the things I said
(Won't be)
And I won't be far away
(Won't be)
The words burn down like
(Won't be)

(Won't be)
Forgive the things I said
(Won't be)
And I won't be far away
(Won't be)
The words burn down like fire
(Won't be)
And I wont be far
(Won't be)
Forgive the things I said
(Won't be)
And I won't be far away
(Won't be)
The words burn down like fire
(Won't be)
