Since you've been gone
I shut my eyes and I fantasize
That you're here with me
Will you ever return?
I won't be satisfied
'til you're by my side
Don't wait any longer

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry

Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time

When you said good bye
I was tryin' to hide
But I felt inside
'til you passed me by
You said you'd return

You said you'll be mine
'til the end of time
But don't wait any longer

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry

Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry

Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time
Come back and
Stay for good this time
