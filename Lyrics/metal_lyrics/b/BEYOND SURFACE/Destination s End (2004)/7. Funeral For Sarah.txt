There's a whisper in the wind
She calls my name
I follow the voices in my head
She must be here

Walking where the shadows dance
But there's still no light that shines
And I feel it's just a dream

I cannot run
I cannot hide
She sang that song
Without a smile
Always a place inside my heart
I follow endless cold black nights
No turning back
No time to die
She made it all go away

Blackened is this soul and I was
Torn in the dark
Every time I speak her name
Her name
Sarah

As the clouds roll by outside
I fall asleep
Grinning faces stare at me
But they can't speak

Walking where the shadows dance
But there's still no light that shines
And I feel it's just a dream
Yeah

I cannot run
I cannot hide
She sang that song
Without a smile
Always a place inside my heart
I follow endless cold black nights
No turning back
No time to die
She made it all go away

Blackened is this soul and I was
Torn in the dark
Every time I speak her name
Her name
Sarah

Blackened is this soul and I was
Torn in the dark
Every time I speak her name
Her name
Sarah

Blackened is this soul and I was
Torn in the dark
Every time I speak her name
Her name
Sarah

Blackened is this soul and I was
Torn in the dark
Every time I speak her name
Her name
Sarah
Sarah
Sarah
