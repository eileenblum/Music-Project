Seems like yesterday
The world has lost its innocence
It feels like all is gone
And I am fallin' away

The old man turns away
I guess he thinks
There's no more time
The young one takes it all
And will be cheated again

No one's there to tell me why
And no one lives without a lie
In fear
Just feel
Why we're here
No one can understand
We're far away from fall in grace
Time to

The struggle in my mind
Will last for all eternity
Being someone else
Would be a pleasure for me

How can I decide
To find the right track in my life?
Depression takes a ride
My final sacrifice

No more dreams to dream
No more feelings to feel
No more love to give
Destination's end

No one's there to tell me why
And no one lives without a lie
In fear
Just feel
Why we're here
No one can understand
We're far away from fall in grace
Time to

Destination's end
Destination's end
Destination's end
Destination's end
Destination's end
Destination's end
