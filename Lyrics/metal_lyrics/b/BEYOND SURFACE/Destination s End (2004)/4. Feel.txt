Welcome to my darkest lie
Where I used to feel all fine
Take a seat
Enjoy this poem I play for you

You can take all you want to
Even then when I don't know you
Just like everybody does

Yeah
To feel
To be
Is all

My own sickness
Makes me blind
Leave my feelings all behind
Just look what you have done to me

I will take all I want to
Even then when you don't want to
The best things in my life

Always burnin'
Always turnin'
Away

To feel
To be
Is all

Yeah
To feel
To be
Is all

To feel
To be
Is all
