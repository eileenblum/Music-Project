The stage is empty now
From here I can see eternity
All the friends I know
Have gone and left me alone

Trying to forget
Strange things come to my mind
All my memories fade away

Crawling to myself
Gods please
Have some mercy, yeah
This time I cry for more
And I wonder what it feels to me

The final step is done
The words have no more sense for me
I have gone too far
I know
But I don't care

Feeding the machine
The hate I breed inside for you
All the tears dry up someday

Crawling to myself
Gods please
Have some mercy, yeah
This time I cry for more
And I wonder what it feels to me

Crawling to myself
Gods please
Have some mercy, yeah
This time I cry for more
And I wonder what it feels to me

This time I
Time I
Time I

This time I cry for more
