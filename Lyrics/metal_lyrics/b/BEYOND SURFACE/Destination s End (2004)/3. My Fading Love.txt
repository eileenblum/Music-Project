As darkness falls on me
A prayer is lost in vain
Sweet sickness is my self-destruction

God damn it, I was wrong
For disturbing the peace we won
This bittersweet taste I had lost

Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?
Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?
Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?
Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here?

My time is closing in
I'm on my way to dawn
Beyond the point of no return

God damn it, I was wrong
For disturbing the peace we won
This bittersweet taste I had lost

Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?
Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?

Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?
Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me?

Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?
Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?
Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here alone?
Oh Lord, why did she go?
Why did she leave me here?
