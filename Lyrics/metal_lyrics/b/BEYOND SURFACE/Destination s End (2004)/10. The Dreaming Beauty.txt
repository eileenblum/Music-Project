Can you hear?
Her heart is running
Running away from the love
She shared
And she's always taking
Too much time
Thinking 'bout herself

As her heart began to cry
She was in need to realize
That there's something
On her mind

And she's dreaming on and on
The dreaming beauty comes undone
She will never be alone
And she's dreaming on and on
The dreaming beauty comes undone
She will never be alone
As long she's dreaming

She's a working tiny girl
Saving money to buy her love
I hope she never forgets to put on
Her lovely shoes made of glass

And her best friend, cold mirror
Is the ecstasy for life
I bet she's always Mrs. Princess
Waiting for Mr. Right

And she's dreaming on and on
The dreaming beauty comes undone
She will never be alone
And she's dreaming on and on
The dreaming beauty comes undone
She will never be alone
As long she's dreaming

Always dreaming
Always dream
Always dreaming
Always dream

Always dreaming
Never forget the day
Where we had shared our love

Always dreaming
Always dream
Always dreaming
Always dream
Always dreaming
Yesterday

And she's dreaming on and on
The dreaming beauty comes undone
She will never be alone
And she's dreaming on and on
The dreaming beauty comes undone
She will never be alone
As long she's dreaming

And she's dreaming
And she's dreaming
And she's dreaming
On and on and on and on
And she's dreaming
And she's dreaming
And she's dreaming
On and on and on and on
