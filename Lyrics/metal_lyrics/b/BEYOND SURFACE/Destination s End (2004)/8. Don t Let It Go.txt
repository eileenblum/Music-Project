I know nothing is endless
So please my love, don't let it go
Time is fading away
And I atone for what I've done

So give it a try
And we'll be together maybe
Give it a try
And this pain will have to end
Don't let it go

Lady love, where did you go?
My heart is turning black
I divert myself with nothing
Forsaking the things we shared

So give it a try
And we'll be together maybe
Give it a try
And this pain will have to end
Don't let it go
I don't let it go

You will always be so far away
Too far away to stay
I remember all the things we said
There's no more meaning

Find a way, find a sense to be
To feel I'm worthy
Day to day I live
And all remains the same

Give it a try
And we'll be together maybe
Give it a try
And this pain will have to end
Give it a try
And we'll be together maybe
Give it a try
And this pain will have to end
Don't let it go
I know
I know
I know
I don't let it go
