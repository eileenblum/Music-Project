I'm going alone the way of darkness
I throw glows in sand
It's my challenge to heavens

For enemy year of slanders
For burning piles of rebels
For night Sabbath's in hiding places

My black banner above
My weapon ready to kill
So proud of the eye of fight

I inflame the fire of hate
I slowly sharpen my sword
In stillness waiting for dusk

Kill- the only vision of victory
Destroy- don't save anything today
Burn- fire burns the rest of our enemies
Victory- screaming all of us

The clink of crushed steel
Hallow target's sound
The last deadly screams

Bodies in the puddle of blood
The victorious banner is blowing
Pentagram triumphs in glory

Victory, victory, victory
And death
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria
Satanas
