Imminent vision of death
The end at once beginning
Existence is die
Gate of gloom has opened

The lack of bodily touch
The deeper spiritual's eufory
The pain of existence in abyss
I'm just waiting to go in

Come
I hear

All life alone
I had seen the aim in spite of others hypocrisy
Deluded by lies
I floundered obstinate to the truth
In soulless word
Magic escape in the underworld
I open gates
Hellish abbeys calling me

Come
I hear

The river of lava
Like blood in my veins
Painful moans
It's nice music for me
Bloodthirsty hell
It's time for sweet revenge
I wasn't wrong
I'm following you my master

Come
I hear
