Nights and days
You build hellish kingdom
Night and days
You look for gloomy souls

Fire and sword
That's what your enemies feel
Fire and sword
In gloomy hands

The bloody moon is rising
In the destination's nights
The rides are coming
On the black horses

You are standing
In the chariot of fire
And we are
Apocalyptic army of hell

Pure soul
Is sacrifice for Satan
Let them burn
Christian churches

So feel
Mighty of Satan
Let be
Darkness

Evil and hatred
It's destiny of your life
Evil and hatred
It's your power

Fall and pain
Is waiting for Christian god
Fall and pain
Angels deserve for death

Time for revenge
Sacrifice for Satan
Hell's master
Hail Satan
