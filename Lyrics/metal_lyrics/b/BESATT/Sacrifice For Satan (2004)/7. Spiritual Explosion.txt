The Satan overfill my soul
I'm feeling the transforming
I'm changing
I'm feeling spiritual explosion

I feel the hell behind the wall
What should I tell people
I'm so close
Still hearing nothing

Open the wisdom's gates
To understand who I'm
I want to spread my wings
To rise over doubts
Passing the failure I don't loose the trace
I want to stride this way
Follow you and trust you

Life and die
Create and destroy
