We are the sword of hatred
In the hands of great demon

We are the sons of darkness
Giving honor to the devil

We are the blade in the heart of
Jesus hanging on the cross

We are the thorn an the head
To make the pain harder

We are the evil
We are making own world
We are the blasphemer
Covered by cloth of disdain

We go by our ways
After own rules
Closed in own circle
We are making own world
Don't care about strange ideals
Unimportant strange cult
Closed in own circle
Covered by cloth of disdain

We are candles of truth
Overthrowing old deceit

We are revenge's whip
Leaving bloody trade

We are harbinger of death
In apocalyptic battle

We are evil's spectrum
To destroy the world
