In the seat of free people
Who believe in various gods
The blood and fire
The altars in black blood
Sacrificed in the time of fullmoon
It's burning now

The sky is black
The sky went into mourning
There is fullmoon
Knights ride their horses
With banners of relics

Smell of holy incense
Means ritual of blood came
Their whispers
Call the power
He raises up sacrifical knife
It's coming death
DEATH!!

On the hell holy army stands
They wartch on pagan tribe
Papal's sword is flashing
Choral psalm sounds in silence
It dispels blood - thirsty lust
The ritual of blood has been done
By the blood
BLOOD!!

Hard sacred steel
In the name of love god
Kill the unknown cult
Logged dead bodys
For holy father
And his son
And white dove!
