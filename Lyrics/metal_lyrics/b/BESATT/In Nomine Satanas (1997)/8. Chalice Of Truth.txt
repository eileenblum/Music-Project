The master of all evil
That hey call him
The throne in colour of night
Insignia of skulls at the foot of throne
So open gates of the hell
The land of bestial lust
I cross threshold of madness
I am comind my master

Death hugs me
I cast away her cold hand
This is time of mastery
I am the god - now and here
I drink up liquid of wisdom
They called me the evil
I am the evil
And so what of it!!
