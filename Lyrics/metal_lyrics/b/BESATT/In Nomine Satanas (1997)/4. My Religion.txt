In the south SATAN on the throne, surrounded the fire from everywhere
In the east LUCIFER proud, his power is the air
In the north great BELIAL, will rule over the world
In the west LEVIATAN, displaces a water abysses

I am standing alone like a exile, condemn but proud
I am not blind men ,like you - erring sheeps
My body hurts, but my soul fells full of delight
I hold u my hands high, and call the power of dark

The four sides of the world , I bow low my head
The greatest four sides of the world, I bow low my head
The four mighty gods, I go down on my knees
The time of truth will become, the time of left path!!
