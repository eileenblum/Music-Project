And after a thousand years
Satan freed himself from the abyss
Nations from all over the world
Were united under pentagram

Demons
Hungry for revenge
Demons
Thirsty of God's blood

As many as grains of sand
They came to surround their enemy
In city loved by the God
They are ready to fight

Attack
Legions are screaming
Attack
Carnage have started

Demons
Hungry for revenge
Demons
Thirsty of God's blood

Final battle has finished
White horse rides bleads, his eyes fades
Sword drowns in God's heart, heaven in flames

Victory
Triumph of demons
Victory
Triumph of the Beast

666 Forever!!!
