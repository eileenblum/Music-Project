They knell by the sea of glass
And play on the harp of God
Hosts of opponents of the beast
666 is its name
And when the sun rised, there was a mark in heaven
The temple of tabernacle and certificate has opened
Seven angels with plagues came from the gate
They were dressed with linen and gold

One of the wild animals brought the charms
Seven charms full of anger
The temple filled with dense smoke
And the voice said: pour the anger from charms on earth

Seven angels left the plagues
People of beast got a malignant ulcer
Seas and rivers became purple
From the blood of animals living there
There was a heat and sun burned with fiery touch
And then came a sinister, impenetrable darkness
Demons came from the mouth of dragon and Beast
Cities were destroyed by storms and earthquakes

Seven great plagues - the anger of God
Seven great plagues - thrown on earth
Seven great plagues â blowâs been given
