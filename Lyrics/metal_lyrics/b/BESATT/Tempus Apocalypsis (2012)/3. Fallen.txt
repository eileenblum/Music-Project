I saw a wonder in heaven
Pregnant woman came
With wreath of stars
There appeared another wonder
Seven-head dragon
The fiery red one

And woman brought forth a man child who was cought up unto God
And she fled into the wilderness from the tyranny

There was great war in heaven
Michael proved the angels
Inflicted a blow
Dragon with his legions
Prevailed not
And was fallen

Rebellious, cast out
United another legions
Rebellious, cast out
Stranded by the edge

And the beast came from the depths
Dragon gave her a power
Mankind gave her a bow
Its name was 666

Rebellious, cast out
United another legions
Rebellious, cast out
Descended to Hell
