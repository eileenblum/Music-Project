Thick ichor flows from the walls
Choking vapor makes misty dusk
Freezing moisture every stone
You're standing at the gates with the golden pentagram

Blood and ashes
Fire and evil
Come in!!!

In the middle an altar spattered with fresh blood
In the distance a black velvet throne
Stench of burned bodies and bones
Stacks of skulls are laying by your feet

Blood and ashes
Fire and evil
Stay here!!!

Can you hear?
It's not a wind
Can you hear?
They're carrying flagellas
It's time for gathering
It's time for war!!!
