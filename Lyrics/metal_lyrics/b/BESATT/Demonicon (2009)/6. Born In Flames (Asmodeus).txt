Lilithâs first-born son
Samael was his father
Born in flames

With a crown on human head
He mounts his dragon
Spitting fire

Three mighty heads
Of a bull, sheep and man
Holding in his hands
Infernal banner and spear

72 Legions
Furious ghosts of hell
Under his command

72 Legions
Demons of devastation
Ready to obey

A lover of vain amusement
Music, dance and art

An expert in arithmetic and astrology
Knows the place of hidden treasures

Three mighty heads
Of a bull, sheep and man
Holding in his hands
Infernal banner and spear

Centuries ago, after every wedding he was killing successive husbands of Sarah
He banished king Salomon from kingdoms ascending his throne
