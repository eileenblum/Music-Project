Once a cherub and the leader of angels in the seventh circle
Created in abyss from smokeless fire in the beyond
As son of fire he refused to kneel before son of the earth, Adam
For doing this he was cast out of heaven into the depths

Rider mounting a snake
Son of fire
Leader of fallen angels
With many faces

The last ceremony of Reconciliation day after purification
In a temple high priest sheds goatâs blood for Azazel
He spawned giants by sleeping with daughters of men
And they were drowned in deluge that covered the earth

He taught men to make weapons
Battle swords and shields
He taught women to beautify their eyes
And to dress seductively

Rider mounting a snake
Son of fire
Leader of fallen angels
With many faces
