When the infantry is marching on the earth begins to quake
Above the army black standards with pentagrammatic shapes
The beasts from Hell need to satisfy their lust for blood
It is the time of Armageddon, no mercy for votaries of god

The sky is flooded with clouds
Bloody rain drips the ground
There is only hatred in our eyes
Hear a powerful ominous roar
Satan!!!

Black armours shine
Swords ready to kill
Strength and blasphemy
The mighty sinister scream
Revenge!!!

Tight armies clash in battle
Heads fall off, dead bodies drop
Mercy failed, crucifix covers by blood    x2
Infernal victors uplift a black flag

War
War

The era of Antichrist has finally come
