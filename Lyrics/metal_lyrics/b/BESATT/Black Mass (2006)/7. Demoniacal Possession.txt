A prophetic dream
Awakens evil
My thoughts
All around you
I feel power
Blood imprint
I will give vent
To my hatred

The symbols of cross go up in flames
Christian churches collapse

Infernal truth

Always loyal
To the pentagram
I follow you
My Lord Satan
The symbol of Hell
Engraved in my heart
Possessed soul
Unbounded abyss
