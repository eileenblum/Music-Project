Like a river
Unceasingly
From the source
Reaches destination
Like a (burning) flame
Restlessly
From a spark
Devours all

In the recesses of my soul
Vengeance is born

Like a wind
Rapidly
From a breeze
Tears everything out
Like a storm
Slowly
From a drop
Floods everything

In the recesses of my soul
Vengeance is born

In my soul - revolt
Against nonsensical dogmata
In my heart - hatred
Of the Christian god
In my hand - a sword
Aimed at the symbol of cross
In my mind - revenge
In the name of Satan

My vengeance
Like an element
Slowly sprouts
In my sick mind
A vision of the end
Of my sweet revenge
Is the heaven ablaze
Flooded with angel blood
