I lie on the cemetary
Sacrificial blond,
Unholy water
For my funeral
Body- alive yet
But skon to be dead
Soul remains alive
But stall be sacrificed

Final hour,
Final night
Take me
Father

Bless my ceremony of migot
I hail my funeral
I satisfied my Hunter
For my blond
Red stream stains my hand
Flesh is thirst for sand
Jezus come and taste
My knife of death
