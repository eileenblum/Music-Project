I am mad
As madly are my visions
When I see jesus
In the puddle of the blood

I am mad
As madly are my minds
When I feel hate
To the god

I am mad
As madly are my deeds
When I spit disdainful
Into the crucifix

Am I mad?
And maybe whole world
Is so lied

SATAN
They call you father of lie
And maybe you are
Father of insolent truth

SATAN
They call you father of treason
And maybe you are
Father of rebellion

SATAN
They call you father of debauchery
And maybe you are
Father of delight

SATAN
They call you master of evil
So you are master of world
Cause the evil is inside us
