I am the created by god
To thanks him on my knees
What is so tricky lies

They killed my instincts
They told me their truth
But I still feel like an animal
What is godlike prohibitions?
Pronounced by heretics
It is funny bullshit

I am black buck
In lost ships herd
We won't go behind your shepherd

I break tortures chains
And I scream
I am free
My eyes can see the truth
And I know
I am free

Let naive believe
In their end happiness
What it will be so disappointment
Your fear about pain
What will be abbeys
Your hell is my paradise!!!!
