I gall my mind
Thinking about the nazarene
I bless to someone
Who put on the thorn
The hails droved into the palm
Let burns like a fire
Due pain and suffering

The blood drips slowly
From wounds dealt a blow right
Head fell down
In deadly paralysis
Meager picture of god
Deserves for disdain
That's why I loudly scream

Jesus I hate you!!!!!!!!
Hail LUCIFER
HAIL LUCIFER
HAIL LUCIFER, forever!!!!!!!
