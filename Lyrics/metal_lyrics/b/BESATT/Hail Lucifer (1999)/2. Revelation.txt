When the great sky
Black coat puts on
I felt the power
Which calls me

Instinctive like an animal
I am running forward
When deepness of forest
Draws me in

Old mighty boughs
Under cover of the night
It swing ominous
With the wind

Whine of the wolf from afar
Reminds me now
That world of an animals
Is so close to me

Flash appeared in the sky
Light up darkness of wood
Into wilderness solitude
Mighty thunder

My face with a delight
Received rainfalls
I shown my power
Round about storm

My body twines
Master of gloomy throne
You've chosen me
This night I feel
Your nearness'
From face strakes wisdom
I drink it
Great SATAN!!

The first glare of the dawn
Hurts my eyes
I stand powerless in the forest
Awaked from the torpor

Now I know
Where my soul
This night I saw
The truth and the power
