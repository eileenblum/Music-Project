The old crosses on the crossroads
Decayed and bitten by the time
Symbols of eternal ignorance
Which is blind to the free world
Lie the relics of the past
Written in different dimension
Spit with venom of hypocrisy
And cast a dark shadow

Let's stand at the crossroads
And wake our wrath
Let it burn the crosses
We will burn the rests of ignorance

Let you take the possession of wrath
Pure wrath in its essence
Let the wrath be your guide
And cut the embarrassing ties

Gazing at the cross
You can see the pain
Your hands are tied
Without the line of defense
Like a sheep in the herd
You have a shepherd in cassock
And at the end of the way
You have nothing

Let's stand on the crossroads
And excite our wrath
Let it burn the crosses
Symbols of pride and yoke
Let's throw away our fear
And let grow our new strength
Rise up our new banners
Banners with the image of the Devil
