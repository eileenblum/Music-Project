Burning crosses give pleasure
Broken dogmas give relief

The stench of human meat
The crash of broken bones
Derisive laugh of inquisitor
Carry echoes of the past

Sweet vengeance, there will be blood again
Righteous vengeance, it's time to send the messages

For the witches on pyres
Christian crosses will burn
For the years of oppression
The crown of thorns will fall

It's not a time for forgiveness
There is no mercy
It's not a time for another cheek
It's time to die

Sweet vengeance, there will be blood again
Righteous vengeance, it's time to send the messages
