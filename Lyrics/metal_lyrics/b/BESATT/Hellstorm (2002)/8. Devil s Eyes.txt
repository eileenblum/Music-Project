Under the black banner
I lead my life
I'm looking from above on disease
Christian world
I'm enlighten between sick people
They pass on their constrain
By generation
In present empty, dirty world
I'm watching by devil's eyes
On unsuccessful prophecy
Desperate ship's Evangels
Left for devour
By wolfs from the darkness

Lucifer is the way
To self-perfection
Lucifer is teacher
Of dignity and pride
Lucifer is conqueror
Against unnatural rules
Lucifer is the guide
For enlighten legions
Master help me to wake up people
Chosen to command
Under your majesty
Burn by lightning's fire
My life line
Or cut my earthy existent
