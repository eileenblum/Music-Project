On the glade between the trees
Full moon shines in the darkness
I hear louder and louder sing
I scream laudatory sing
AVE MASTER LUCIFER
Fire is burning with shadows around
Mad dance has begun
This night is magic
I still hear laudatory scream
AVE MASTER LUCIFER
I feel heat on my body
Fire
Sweet sticky taste on my mouth
Blood
Known smell I recognize
Opium
Echo repeats again
Choral wild scream
AVE MASTER LUCIFER
