I'm dead
Wretched body breaks dawn
In the darkness I feel pain and death

Graveland's silence
Breaks damned's groan
Human blood again flows dawn
On the death throne

I'm dead
Like a bad dreams remain
From the thick fog
I show my pale face

From the seven gates of hell
Blaspheme scream I arise
revenge by destiny
Till to the end

In darkness I wake up
Astral whirl floats me
Minds like a frosty wind
Breaks the cross with fury

I'm evil ghost
I return like wind
To put fear to your mind
You see me in the beauty of the night

From a seven gates of hell
Blaspheme scream I raise
Revenge by destiny
Till to the end
