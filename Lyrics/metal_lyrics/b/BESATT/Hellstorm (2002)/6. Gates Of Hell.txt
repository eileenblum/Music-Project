Lucifer
I cut away torturing rope
Of lies and hypocrisy
So that I may look at your throne

Open the gates
Lucifer
Take my soul
Satan master

Lucifer
Let me climb over the schemes
To understand
The pentagram's Mystic power

I pass my path for long time
Path without any forbid
Path without any mercy
My path leads me straight to the hell

Lucifer
Give my your truth of wisdom
So that I may mock
at christian's rules

Open the gates
Lucifer
Take my soul
Satan master
