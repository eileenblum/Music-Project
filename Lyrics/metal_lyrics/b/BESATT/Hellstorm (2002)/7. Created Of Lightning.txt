Signs on the sky and earth announce
Disorder, blood and fire
Fury of hurricanes destroy all
Carry the devil's seeds

There's a war around
And disease kills men
Like a bridge between life and death
Lighting flash the mighty night
Thunder end winds stun the blessed candle prayers

In lighting the birth and scream
The devil's word has been released
Approach the earth, carries by echo
Between forests, mountains and caves
Till to each creature

Makes hearts full of darkness
And predicts hard times for
christian's world
I'm created of lighting
And I declare the war against old orders
I will forward run to the future
I bring to the gathering
Of enlightens Men!
