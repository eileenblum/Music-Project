Baphomet
His left hand

White moon
Hessed

Baphomet
His right hand
Shows below
Black moon
Geburaha

Baphomet
On his brow drew
Light symbol
Might sign
Pentagram

Baphomet
Between horns
Beaming flames
Magic light
Intelligence
We are goat believers
Let our enemy shiver
Cause will be for him
Death

Baphomet
His animal head
Spreads fear
In their eyes
Faithful sinners

Baphomet
Between legs
There's cane
Hellish symbol
Eternal life

Baphomet
From many centuries
Is solution
Darkness and light
Hellish and holiness

Baphomet
Magic of mighty evil
Sin goat
Black church
Spectrum of death
Become time
Our fight
Time of sword and target
Let's union
Like a wolfs
Under hellish evil banner
We will wash
Our hands
In warm blood of our enemy
Let them feel
Fear and humility
To believers of black goat

Baphomet !!!
