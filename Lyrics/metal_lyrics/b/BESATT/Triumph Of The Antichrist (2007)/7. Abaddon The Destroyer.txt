Dark angel of death with clawed wings
High up in the hierarchy of demons
Holding a key to the wells of depths
A fallen angel who rules the underworld

Abaddon â the king of perdition
Abaddon â who sows destruction
Abaddon â the lord the of locusts
Abaddon â in the deepest abyss

Guarding the sixth gate
Where the wicked souls
Atone and suffer in hell
For things they did or wished to do
Angel of destruction challenges god
On the day of the apocalypse
Enjoying respect of the legions
Destroyer of morbid egotism

Abaddon â the king of perdition
Abaddon â who sows destruction
Abaddon â the lord the of locusts
Abaddon â in the deepest abyss

When the fifth angel sounded his trumpet
He opened the wells of depths with his key
A large swarm of wild locusts eclipsed the sun
And they were given the power of earthâs scorpions
