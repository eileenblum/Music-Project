When the moon is full
And the night is so bright+
The glade gets crowded
On the top of a nearby hill

Beams of fire - cast long shadows
Harp and flute - make gloomy sounds
Music plays - hypnotic dance goes on
Subtle chants - made of many whispers

Rege Satanas
Gloria Satanas
Gratins Satanas
Vobisciu Satanas

Long hair weaving on the wind
Naked breasts so lasciuious
Enchanting twilight in the mist
Witches worship the devil at night

For these nocturnal pleasures
A stake awaits in the town square
Licked by the tongues of flame
They are uniting with the demons
