Black Lion, demon of the Sun
Unchained from this causal world
Hear my song of murderer
And keep my course along
The vale of death

Formless Chaos gave birth
To Archangel over all the hosts
Men speak Your name with fear
You are darkness in the eyes of the blind

I have slept death's dream
for ages unnumbered

And learnt magic through astral spheres
What is absolute wisdom If liberty is a dream

I`m discreated but reborn
Standing with chains like a wounded wolf
Lend me Your wings of divinity
My soul shall rest into the dust of Venus

I have slept death's dream
for ages unnumbered

And learnt magic through astral spheres
What is absolute wisdom If liberty is a dream
