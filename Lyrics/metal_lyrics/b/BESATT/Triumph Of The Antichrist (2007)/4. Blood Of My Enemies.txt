Time of fucking chaos
Antichrist raised his sword
Mercy and frailty disdained
For they offend the strong

Peace is unattainable
Let's celebrate out triumph
Let's build a pyramid of skulls
To see the farthest

Our conquest is everlasting
We will not retreat
For us death is art
And we are the artists

We destroy the past and dogmas
And create our new world
Our enemies' crimson blood
I swallow with delight

We build the Lucifer's altar
And set it for eternity
Because it is cut
In a solid rock

We destroy the past and dogmas
And create our new world
Our enemies' crimson blood
I swallow with delight

I drink the blood!!!

The blood of bastards and whores
Ant the priests of all my enemies
I drink the blood of the old world
A toast to the Devil
