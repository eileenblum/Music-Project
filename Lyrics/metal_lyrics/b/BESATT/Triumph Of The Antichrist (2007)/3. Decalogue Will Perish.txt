The ancient runes
Engraved centuries ago
Ten simple principles
To enslave the believers

Hypocrisy full of victims
Religious indoctrination
Spread for millenia
Human instincts put to death

Decalogue is chains
Put by the popes
Decalogue is a covenant
To seize power

Why follow the herd
Without any prerogative
Trapped in the world of illusion
Time to open the gates of life

Decalogue is duplicity
You're condemned to sin
Decalogue is in opposition
To the laws of nature

Revolt is the only salvation
Reject all pangs of conscience
The Devil reveals a new era
Life tastes of all pleasures now

I despise the poisoned principles
Preached by Christian priests
They are good for those
Terrified by the sole vision of hell

Naivety is weakness
That will not remain
Decalogue will perish
In flames of oblivion
