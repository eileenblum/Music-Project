Unchallenged ruler of all demons and fallen angels
Your name evokes fear and terror among the mob
You are an inspiration for a number of poets and sages
Your countenance outshines everything with its majesty

Hell â your kingdom covered with burning lava
Pentagram â your emblem of power and might
Death â your ally in conscripting new legions
War â your existence and eternal fascination

Proud archangels under the banner of infernal emblems
Demons suited in shining armours of black gold
Hordes equipped with battle axes and hungry for blood
Under your command we shall fight in the final battle

You were the first to show what rebellion really was
You are the one for whom altars of human skulls are set
You are the one against whom seraphs wage unholy war
You are the one admired and followed by a million souls

Proud archangels under the banner of infernal emblems
Demons suited in shining armours of black gold
Hordes equipped with battle axes and hungry for blood
Under your command we shall fight in the final battle
