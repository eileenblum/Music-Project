Satan â in the south sits on a throne of human heads
Lucifer â in the east gives a speech on eternal verities
Belial â in the north commands an army of demons
Leviathan â in the west mediates revenge in the abyss

Fire â the flames of delight which caress your body
Air â the space where your thoughts roam free
Earth â the place where you create your works
Water â the abyss where you drown your sorrows

A deceased path
Infinity on the horizon
There is only one way to salvation
Head towards the eternal shadows
Let the pentagram lead you to the place
Where the four gods rule the elements
