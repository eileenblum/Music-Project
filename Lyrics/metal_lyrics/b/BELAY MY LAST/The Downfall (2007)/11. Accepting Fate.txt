There's no future for you
You've secured your place in nothingness
And our hate for as long as you exist

We've worked hard for what is ours
We've payed with blood and sweat

The tears were all yours
We won't give up on this
Your new life is cold and hollow

I won't stop till blood fills your eyes
You'll beg to crawl away from this one
This is your downfall, your demise

Not only didn't you hurt us
We grew up stronger in your passing
You can run your mouth about us
But we'll just keep fucking laughing

Turn your fucking back
Talk your fucking shit
But I will not give up what I have built

We said we'd set the world ablaze
We said we'd set the world ablaze

We tried and we tried, but you gave up on us
We tried and we tried, and you gave up on us
We tried and tried, but you gave up on us
Fuck trust!
We tried and tried, but you fucked our trust
Fuck trust!
We tried and tried, but you gave up on us
Fuck trust!
We tried and tried, but you fucked our trust
Fuck Trust!
