Fuck your plastic
Fuck your green eyed stares

There's nothing genuine about you
I haven't heard one shred of truth
Are your dreams as empty as your laugh?
Another thing you think you're supposed to
Another programmed attribute?

I want to beat you senseless
So I can finally see what you really feel
I want to beat you breathless
So I can finally hear one thing that's real

Your life is
Your life is
Bullshit!

One day to be true to yourself
Your life has become bullshit
Smile and nod, You cannot win
Run the race, Grin and bear it
Another fallen victim in the money pit
Money pit!

Your cries do not haunt me
Remorse is not within me
Your cries do not haunt me
Remorse is not within me

Fuck your plastic
Fuck your green eyed stares

There's nothing genuine about you
I haven't heard one shred of truth

You'll never know
What your life could have been
What you've lost
While struggling for "happiness"
But what dd you have in the first place?

Just a face, A name
Now you've lost it all
Too late to save face
You're just a number now
Just a number now!

Programmed grace and civility
You're so far from decency
