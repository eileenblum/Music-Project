I gave you love.
We gave you love.
I don't think I'm worth it.
I'm through with you.

Wake up! Wake up!
Why arent you moving?
Stay down! Stay down!
Or you'll keep bleeding.

I don't have the strength to forgive you this time.
Forgive you.

Look what you've done to yourself.
Look what you've done to your son.

His entire world (look what you've fucking done!)
Destroyed by lack of love.

Wake up! Wake up!
Why arent you moving?
Stay down! Stay down!
Or you'll keep bleeding.
I don't have the strength to forgive you this time.

Another needle. Another bottle.
One more foot in the grave.
One more step away from me.
You destroyed the life you gave.

I bet you miss him now,
But it's too fucking late.
It's too late
