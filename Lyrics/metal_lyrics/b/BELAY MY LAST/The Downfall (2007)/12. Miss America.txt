I will remember the pain
Remember the deceit

And I will construct your fate
And I will construct your fate
And I will construct your fate

I know the truth
And I know what's right for me

I know the way
Way of your lies
I know the way
Way of your lies
I know the truth
And you can't lie this time

Fuck forgive and forget

This is the end for you and I
This is the end for you and I

You lead the life you wanted
And now it's time for your sacrifice
You chose the life you wanted
And now it's time for your sacrifice

Sacrifice!
Sacrifice!

It amazes me
That you could lie to my face
To my face!

I won't miss you this time
I won't miss you!

And I can't be lied to
One more time
Lied to one more time
One more time
Lied to!
