In your eyes
I see the fake that you are
I see the fake that you are

In your heart
Burns the hate that fuels you
Burns the hate that fuels you

The human mind wasn't built to suffer
But now you will, now you will
I can't take it any longer

Look at what you've done
Look at what you've done
Look at what you've done

How could you say you want to try?
How could I think it's been alright?
Must your mistakes end your life?

Oh, now you've done it
Oh, now you've done it
Oh, now you've done it
Oh, now you've done it

You won't be my burden any longer
It's only a matter of time
Your number is up
You're on your way out

Not coming back for you
I've seen your "love"
The tell tale signs you couldn't hide

But tried to
I live without you working on
What you can't shove away this time

Bleeding for what
You couldn't be without
What you couldn't wait to be without
Without!

I'm coming back for the blood
I shed in your name
Your name!

I'm back for blood
I shed in your name
I'm back for blood
I shed in your name.
