Your eyes widen with fear.
Realize who I am and why I'm here.
I'll make it right.
Your lust has ended his life.

All I know is how he's gonna die.
Won't be your fucking joke any longer.
I will cry for the last time.
It ends now.

You'll pay in full for the life that you destroyed.
Life for a life. Blood for a fuck.
I wish that I could feel joy.
No pleasure. No satisfaction.
I can't bring back what we once had.
I know one thing, he can't bleed fast enough for me.

Now here I stand un-fucking-broken.
I was right, he couldn't bleed fast enough.
He couldn't bleed fast enough.

Just give me another reason
To despise every ounce of your being.
You try to replace me.

Another life strangled by your grasp.
You dug your claws in long enough.

If you wanted to destroy me you should've made it quick.
I'm coming back for you.
This was your first mistake.

You'll pay in full for the life that you destroyed.
Life for a life. Blood for a fuck.
You'll pay in full for the life that you destroyed.
Life for a life. Blood for a fuck.
I wish that I could feel joy.

Your eyes widen with fear.
Realize who I am and why I'm here.
I'll make it right.
Your lust has ended your life.

All I know is how he's gonna die
I won't be your fucking joke any longer.
I will cry for the last time.
It ends now
