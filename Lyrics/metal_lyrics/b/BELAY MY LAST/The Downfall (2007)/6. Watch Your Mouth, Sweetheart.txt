Black bagged and taken in the night
No chance to flee or fight
The wrong words just too your life away
No chance of seeing another day

We have you now
You'll think what we say
When we are through
A new meaning of pain

You can't imagine what
We'll do to you
Strapped to this chair
You'll die in this room

You can't imagine
What we'll do to you
Strapped in this chair
You'll die in this room
But it won't be soon
But it won't be soon

Don't beg for mercy
You'll need to save your breath
You'll be the example
Justified in your death
Justified in your death!

Was the truth
Worth the final cost?

You spoke your mind
And you rolled the dice
You spoke your mind
And you rolled the dice
You spoke your mind
And you rolled the dice
You spoke your mind
And you rolled the dice
Rolled the dice!

You will give into the pain
You will see things our way
You will give into the pain
You will see things our way
Or you will see nothing at all
You fucking pussy
