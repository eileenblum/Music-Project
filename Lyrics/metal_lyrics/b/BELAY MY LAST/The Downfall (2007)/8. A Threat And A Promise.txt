I have a new purpose in life
To disgrace your name
Every fucking step of the way.

You abandon me?
I'll crush your fucking knees.
You won't walk away from us again.
You won't walk again.

You think you're better than us?
We'll play with your fucking guts.

I won't forgive. I won't forget.
So tonight my actions are merciless.
Years of hate have all boiled down to this.
You're the one thing I'll never fucking miss.
It's your last night. Say 'goodbye'.

I've got you right where I want you.
You've got nowhere to go.
You can scream all that you want to,
And still no one will know.

I want your face.
I'll wear it proudly.

I fulfilled my purpose in life;
You'll never walk again.
Years of hate have reached their end.
I fulfilled my purpose in life;
Your screams won't ever haunt me again.
Years of hate have reached their end
