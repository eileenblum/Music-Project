I hold no sympathy
It's your decision
You made the choice
The choice!

I'll show you no mercy
It's not my fault
You silenced your voice
Your voice!

Too weak to live life
You deserve to die
Eternally you'll burn
Damnation, no return

Too weak to live life
You deserve to die
Eternally you'll burn
Damnation, no return

You don'ot deserve the tears
They cry for you
Prepare for hell
Think of the pain of your family
Think of the smile she'll never see again
Eternal damnation (again)
You deserve so much worse
Your suffering only makes me smile

Spit on your grave
Laugh at the damned
Nail your coffin shut
Nail your coffin shut!

No escape
I hold no sympathy
It's your decision, you made the choice
The choice!

I'll show you no mercy
It's not my fault
You silenced your voice
Your voice!
