Curves lure sight and flesh
Desires dictate slavery's path
Lips full of sin
Sense of passion trapped within

Alas! Embrace sharp and fatal..
Downfall is led be deep oath...

Succumbed, cast in her flames
Blinded by beauty, I bow in awe

The game of affection 
Is death negotiation 
Lost in pleasure's bliss 
Slave, you'll face your murderess
Doomed forever, meant to be alone...

Enchantress...
Lady with no master and no god.
Her temple shall not fall
Lethal mistress

Violence flows in blood 
Knifes caress her smooth hands
Little did he know
Demise his destiny

Lilith, Clytemnestra... Carmilla, Delilah 
Nobles of seduction

The game of affection 
Is death negotiation 
Lost in pleasure's bliss 
Slave, you'll face your murderess
Doomed forever, meant to be alone...

Poisonous enchantress!
Your myth is my bitter end...

The game of affection 
Is death negotiation 
Lost in pleasure's bliss 
Slave, you'll face your murderess
Doomed forever, meant to be alone...

Meant to be alone...

Doomed forever, meant to be...
She's doomed forever, meant to be alone...
