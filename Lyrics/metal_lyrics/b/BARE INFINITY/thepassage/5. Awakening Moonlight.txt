Deep in the night, on the island of my sea
Seen in the dark a last angel's tear
Running, searching for the world
One that's lost
The world I've known so long ago
Haunting vision of the past 
One that's lost
In the world I've known so long ago

The smile and the starlight
Vast fields of dreaming mist
Forty days and forty nights
The struggling with myself

Here you stand to find the light
Feast on the silver from the sky
Stand and face the moonlight
New dream awakened in the night

In the times of our lives,
When we forget to live
In those times, when the moment flies
Just a wish to return back to the past
And all we find, is dark remains of rust

The grief and the moonlight
Vast Hells I kept inside 
Bury me beneath the blue
The olden timeless sea...

Here you stand to find the light
Feast on the silver from the sky
Stand and face the moonlight
New dream awakened in the night
