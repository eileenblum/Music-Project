Burning eyes in wilderness 
Distant insufficient sunlight
Not enough 
To redeem his fading existence 
Longing sweet demise to come
Atonement there shall it be
Desire death
The catharsis he craves for

Release
Thy soul's salvation
Resurrection, come!

Brief shall not be the light
Rebirth in lunar shine
Existential zenith
You will culminate forever

Driven by the silver boats
He will drink from the river-head
Meet the fountain
Be surrounded by the sparkling sun

The road shall arise lightened
And so shall be his figure
Painful child, 
Welcome to the heavenly palace

Eternal balance
Your awakening

Brief shall not be the light
Rebirth in lunar shine
Existential zenith
You will culminate forever

Evergreen the passage
Ethereal ascendance

Brief shall not be the light
Rebirth in lunar shine
Existential zenith
You will culminate forever

Evergreen the passage
Ethereal ascendance
