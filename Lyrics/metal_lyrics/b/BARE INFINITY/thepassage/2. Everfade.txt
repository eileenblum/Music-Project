Looking for the way to set you free
So you can meet your own misery
Those lies you always hide,
Your hide from our own sight
The only thing in your mind
Is to please your worthless time
Never thought that you have been
A prey to your own disease

Now look up... your future seems so blank
Your time has come to face your sins

Seems you've found which way to run
Ashamed from what you've done 
Those lies you couldn't hide,
Revealed your dark desires 
The souls that you betrayed,
They're feeding from your shame
So don't turn back to change the time
The crime is paid with crime

Everfading hopes and promises you kept in
Tell me we're ending 
See us coming up and face your own fall
