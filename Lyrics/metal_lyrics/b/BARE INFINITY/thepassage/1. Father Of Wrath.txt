Blood and mourning sweep the earth
Woe and lament 
Execration from the one
Who dwells in smother empires
Red and darkened blade of wrath
Crushing down the heavens 
Phobos and Deimos, battle-born
Descend from the mountains so high

Kneel, before your god
Serve, let the fight now commence 
Obey, for you lives are mine to destroy

Father of sadistic kings
Spread the ashes, force the land to weep
Trade souls for the battle storm
From your blood let the dragon be born
Unleashing torments in the night
Pour down fire from the sky
Free the Furies, daughters of the dark
The spell of divine war is cast

War! ...You'll be perished
Blood! ...You'll spill and offer
Fight! ...I command you
Die! ...I shall have you

No death for me me, just pride
Faith is fallen down on deceptive soil
Condemned you arisen,
Condemned you shall fall
Keeo on bleeding till light exists no more

Promised to sacrifice myself 
To hate and despair 
No world to turn to,
Only ashen graves to hide
Hidden now I draw my line
To escape our Father's wrath
Shadows now caress me 
And I slowly chant a song

Father of sadistic kings
From your blood let the dragon be born
Unleashing torments in the night
Pour down fire from the sky
Free the Furies, daughters of the dark
The spell of divine war is cast

Father of sadistic kings
Spread the ashes, force the land to weep
Trade souls for the battle storm
From your blood let the dragon be born
