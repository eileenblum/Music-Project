A life on the edge, 
The laughter of the people as soundtrack was more (that) I could stand, 
Thatâs how you met me, a girl dressed in black 
With a sorrowful story to tell. 

You told me how to act, 
you told me how to talk, 
You told me the way how to make people love me. 

A puppet in your hands, as I swallow my pride, 
But my voiceâs burning in my throat 
And I must tell you: 

âIâm not what you want me to be 
And I wonât be what you force me to beâ. 

So hear me out, hear me out, 
You gotta hear my shout, 
Hear me out, hear me out, 
I wonât let you bring me down. 
Hear me out, hear me out, 
Youâll watch me take the door, 
So hear me out, hear me out, 
You canât control me anymore. 

Remember those days, 
Remember the tears that I shed and the hatred I felt, 
I canât live like that, 
I simply donât care, you must like me the way that I am! 

âIâm not what you want me to be 
And I wonât be what you force me to beâ. 

So hear me out, hear me out, 
You gotta hear my shout, 
Hear me out, hear me out, 
I wonât let you bring me down. 
Hear me out, hear me out, 
Youâll watch me take the door, 
So hear me out, hear me out, 
You canât control me anymore.
