Starting from scratch I walked a thousand miles 
And lived a thousand lives. 
There was a time I felt about to fall, 
I left those days behind. 

When life puts you on you knees, stand up 
And show her that youâre tough, 
No matter how long the night is because 
The morning always comes. 

I, Iâm reaching for the sun 
I want to have its warmth upon my skin, 
Donât want my life to be in shadows anymore. 

Never played safe, Iâd rather play with fire 
And sometimes I got burnt 
But if you want to sit among the gods, 
Thereâs something you must learn: 

When life puts you on your knees stand up, 
And show youâre not afraid, 
Always look ahead, keep your head up, 
your destinyâll be made. 
Iâm reaching for the sun 
I want to have its warmth upon my skin, 
Donât want my life to be in shadows anymore. 

Ancient spirits come and save me from myself, 
Coz I donât want to return to hell again 
Iâm reaching for the sun 
I want to have its warmth upon my skin, 
Donât want my life to be in shadows anymore.
