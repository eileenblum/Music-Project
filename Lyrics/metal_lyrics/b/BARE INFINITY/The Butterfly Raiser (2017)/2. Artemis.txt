Prayer: antichi elementi, guardiani del tempo, 
invoco voi tutti con questo mio canto. 
Nella notte piÃ¹ nera, nella sera piÃ¹ oscura, 
Pronuncio il tuo nome, Oh argentea dea Luna. 

I saw you in the woods, you were chasing a prey, 
The clouds enclosed the moon and the dear ran away. 
So beautiful and sad, so full of anger and disdain. 
Committed in a fight, you have to choose between dark and light. 

They told you youâre the one who guards the weakest ones, 
How can you take bow and be an evil one? 
Two faces that you wear, two souls inside you, joy and despair. 

Canât you see? Only you can choose what to be. 
The moon smiles at you if you choose the light. 

Choose the light, let your soul be bright, 
Even in a fight, always choose the light, 
You know that itâs right, keep on choose the light, 
Shine into the nightâ¦ the night. 

I saw you in the woods, the arrow in your hand, 
You took a young deerâs life and put it to an end, 
How can you live with this? You should consider him as a friend
Canât you see? Only you can choose what to be. 
The moon smiles at you if you choose the light. 

Choose the light, let your soul be bright, 
Even in a fight, always choose the light, 
You know that itâs right, shine into the night! 

Go into the lightâ¦ always choose the light, 
Even in a fight, always choose the light, 
You know that itâs right, 
Shine into the night.
