Where the history of my land 
Meets a spot of green surrounded by a shade of hazel 
There, a faun plays with the air, 
The magic of the mountain, 

He told me that he tastes 
The sweet and sour taste 
Of the rainy clouds a-coming 
And he told me not to be too sad when the storm comes. 

Life is frail, itâs a creature to protect, he said, 
In your hands, 
Like a pair of wings made out of dreams. 

He, he was a butterfly raiser, 
And heâs running with his hair in the wings 
To finally be back home, 
Yeah he, he was a butterfly raiser, 

And weâre running through the fields, 
Through the centuries and the years. 

No, no matter all the pain, 
The struggle deep inside 
And people saying you canât make it coz, 
One day youâll spread your wings 
And then youâll fly away. 

Life is frail, itâs a creature to protect, he said, 
In your hands, 
Like a pair of wings made out of dreams. 

He, he was a butterfly raiser, 
And heâs running with his hair in the wings 
To finally be back home, 
Yeah he, he was a butterfly raiser, 

And weâre running through the fields, 
Through the centuries and the years.
