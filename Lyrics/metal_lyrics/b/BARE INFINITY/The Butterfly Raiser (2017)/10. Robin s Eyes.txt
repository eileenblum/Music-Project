Your bodyâs still but your brain is running 
Everything seems to be so far away, 
Away from this room 
And you cannot reach it. 

When the world keeps spinning and spinning 
And you just want to leave this sick bed of tears 
And broken dreams 
And the ceiling is your soul companion 

Youâre not alone, 
Iâm holding your hand, 
Itâs not the end, 
Iâll never let go. 

Life goes on, or so they say, 
Donât lose heart, itâs easy to say, 
When the weight is not on your back, 
How can you know about seeing all black? 

You wanna get up but you keep going down, 
You want to escape but youâre stuck in the ground 
And thereâs no, no goddamn way 
For you to react, for you to step out. 

Youâre not alone, 
Iâm holding your hand, 
Itâs not the end, 
Iâll never let go. 

Youâre not alone, 
Iâm holding your hand, 
Itâs not the end, 
Iâll never let go. 

Life goes on as Iâm getting older, 
Lifeâs a breath, a snap and itâs over, 
I will try to get up from this goddamn bed. 
Iâll get up from this goddamn bed. 

Iâm not alone if youâre holding my hand, 
Iâm not alone I know itâs not the end, 
Iâll never let go!
