Breathe, close your eyes
And you're part of the universe
The stars know, and they all
Witnessed the centuries

Seas, rivers, and trees
They are all gathered in a drop
We're not what we seem
Not only matter, we're one with them

One teardrop falling from the eye
Of a pure hearted child
One day he'll save our lives

We came from the seas
We sailed through the skies
To find out the truth
And the secrets of life
The universe knows
The truth is sublime
It's written in the stars
And the sands of time

You think you are
All alone in the universe
But you're wrong
You're a grain in a sea of sand

Seas, rivers, and trees
They are all gathered in a drop

One teardrop falling from the eye
Of a pure hearted child
One day he'll save our lives

We came from the seas
We sailed through the skies
To find out the truth
And the secrets of life
The universe knows
The truth is sublime
It's written in the stars
And the sands of time

We came from the seas
We sailed through the skies
To find out the truth
And the secrets of life
The universe knows
The truth is sublime
It's written in the stars
And the sands of time

Breathe, close your eyes
And you're part of the universe
The stars know, and they all
Witnessed the centuries
