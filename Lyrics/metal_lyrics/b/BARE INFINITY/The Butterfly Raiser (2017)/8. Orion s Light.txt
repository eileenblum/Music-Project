The winters come Its cold outside 
the centuries pass with no end in sight 
the light of the stars is fading from your eyes 
and now 
the path back to Ithacaâsâ gone 
the gods have left him all alone 
cursed to remain in oblivion for all time 
for his crime 

thinking that he was divine 

Lost in a dream of an endless story 
cursed with ship on an windless sea 
searching for stars that will end his journey 
when will I be free 

look to the sky for the winters comet 
follow the stars and the moon to free 
the sails of night 
and sail on orions light 

The sun has set upon the sea 
his eyes are now old he can barely see 
The light that once guided him fades upon 
the waves of time 

the strength that once drove him has gone 
the dark is reclaiming its throne 
and all that is left is the memory of her 

take my life he screams 
without my eyes im just a memory 
a soul lost at sea for eternity 
Lost for all time 

Lost in a dream of an endless story 
cursed with ship on an windless sea 
searching for stars that will end his journey 
when will I be free 

look to the sky for the winters comet 
follow the stars and the moon to free 
the sails of night 
and sail on orions light 

âCurse you all, what is my crime?
I've done your biding 
I've done your will, why have you forsaken me? 
It was glory I sought 
-âIt's glory we wantâ 
glory I delivered 
-âGlory not for youâ 
release me to my fate 
-ânever, no more, never / no moreâ 

âLost in a dreams neverending story 
on a ship on an windless sea 
without stars an endless journey 
how can I be free 

look to the sky for the winters comet 
lighting the path bright for you to see 
hold the memory of her smile 
for love will set you freeâ 

it will set you free 
your journeys over 
Sail on the light from the winters comet 
burn bright in the sky for all to see 
Her destiny and love will set you free
