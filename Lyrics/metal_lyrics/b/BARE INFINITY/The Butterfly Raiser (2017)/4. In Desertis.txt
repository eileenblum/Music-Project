Surrounded by the darkness and by the sands, 
Iâm watching a flower growing amongst the filth. 

Even in dark times a light can be stronger 
And even if raped I know beauty will finally survive. 

Here in my shell I spied the world through a glass, 
But now I feel a voice calling me right here inside my head. 

Even in dark times a light can be stronger 
And even if raped I know beauty will finally survive. 

Even if youâll have to strive through blood and pain, 
Itâll be dark and painful but please never let beauty die. 

Even if youâll have to strive through blood and pain, 
Itâll be dark and painful but please never let beauty die.
