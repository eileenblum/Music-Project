He stares upon the sky
A wish he makes to the stars above
No friend or foe his journey deny him

And the stars, they replied
But his wish could not be answered
So they sent him a warning
To keep him from trying

A sword and a stone
And a wolf as black as the night
No sun or moon could manage to brighten
But the sword made of wood
And the stone made of mud
And the wolf would never stand beside him

They walked the path less travelled
And lived from day to day
He gave the wolf his wings and his armour
And for ten thousand nights
At the edge of the storm
He fought for dreams, he fought for love
He battled on and on until he was old
Old enough to realise
That the wolf was no friend of his
And fed him just lies
Maybe he knew all along
That the way to escape was one

If the sword cuts your hand
And the stone turns to sand
And the wolf keeps howling for you
There's no need to be afraid
You can't start it all again
Don't look back, they can't follow you

Betrayed by the sword in his hand
His childhood fantasies lay on the ground
Waiting for her to pick up
Where he remained
But the stars, they remembered his wish
And granted him wisdom and this
"They can't fool you no more"

If the sword cuts your hand
And the stone turns to sand
And the wolf keeps howling for you
There's no need to be afraid
You can't start it all again
Don't look back, they can't follow you

Don't let them pull you down
They are nothing but stones
That forever will be on the ground
They still envy you
They can't follow you
They are nothing without you

Take my hand
Forever, we will rise again
