Time, running up time, 
wrapped inside mystery, the mystery of life, 
Life, running life, 
life running through my veins, 
with blood and with fire, 

Deep inside myself, there's a light 
that's fighting hard against, 
the evil side of me... 

There comes a day when you're awake 
and you feel that it's time to go, 
there comes a time you wanna fight, 
fight them all, 

all of your fears and all the 
monsters in your head, 
never let 'em go, 
and that's when you'll understand 
that your fate is in your hands. 

Here's my battlefield, 
bravery is my sword, 
my will is my shield 

Deep inside myself, there's a light 
that's fighting hard against, 
the evil side of me... 

There comes a day when you're awake 
and you feel that it's time to go, 
there comes a time you wanna fight, 
fight them all, 
all of your fears and all the 
monsters in your head, 
never let 'em go, 
and that's when you'll understand 
that your fate is in your hands. 

There comes a day when you're awake 
and you feel that it's time to go, 
there comes a time you wanna fight, 
fight them all, 
all of your fears and all 
the monsters in your head, 
never let 'em go...
