Your blood is freezing
Your breath tells me
The earth is trembling
And your eyes, they long to see us

I want to take you to a journey
Discovering what's in yourself
Don't waste your time
In holding your beliefs
You'll lose them along the way

Won't you come with me?
I'll lead you to your darkest dreams
I feel your passion while your heart screams
So won't you come with me?
Won't you come with me
And see what's really inside yourself?
Will it be Heaven or will it be Hell?
So won't you come with me?

You can't resist me, you're at my feet
I'm like a snake in you
And the truth is that you love it

I want to take you to a journey
Discovering what's in yourself
Don't waste your time
In holding your beliefs
You'll lose them along the way

Won't you come with me?
I'll lead you to your darkest dreams
I feel your passion while your heart screams
So won't you come with me?
Won't you come with me
And see what's really inside yourself?
Will it be Heaven or will it be Hell?
So won't you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Won't you come with me?

Won't you come with me?
I'll lead you to your darkest dreams
I feel your passion while your heart screams
Won't you come with me
And see inside the crystal ball?
Your soul's on fire, can you hear its call?
Come with me

Won't you come with me?
I'll lead you to your darkest dreams
I feel your passion while your heart screams
So won't you come with me?
Won't you come with me
And see inside the crystal ball?
Your soul's on fire, can you hear its call?
So won't you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
