No matter how deep
You try to bury me
No matter how deep

Humanity is a word with no meaning
Lost, and walking the path to extinction
Burying the future, day after day
Living reckless in a world that won't last
It's time to stir up the waters
Break all the chains
Before we end up with nothing to reclaim

Resistance defines our lives
Changes the future we're burning
A new disorder can change the tide

It's time to reclaim what was taken
What was taken from me
The ashes fall like snow on the ground
Dirt and decay
Burying the future, there's no other way
Stand up and face them
Their masks will disolve like sands
On the winds of despair

No matter how deep
You try to bury me
I'll fight 'til I can't breathe
And I will rise again
Ashes will cover the fallen

No matter how deep
You try to bury me
I'll fight 'til I can't breathe
And I will rise again

No matter how deep
You try to bury me
I'll fight 'til I can't breathe
And I will rise again

No matter how deep
You try to bury me
No matter how deep
