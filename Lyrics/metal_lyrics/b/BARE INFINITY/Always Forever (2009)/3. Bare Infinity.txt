[Music: Tomas, Lyrics: Christianna]

Darkness reigns around
A phantom breeze caresses me
Crawls into my skin
Makes me shiver cold
At last my purpose found
Life no longer impresses me
My soul I'm giving in
In mercy of any god

Lay your healing breath for me to rest upon
Death I fear not, I fear living alone

My guardian angel please come on
I've been bleeding down to earth too long
Carry me through the rain, throughout the pain
If I'm not to live beside you, take me, save me
'Cause I don't want to bare infinity without you

Heartbeats slowing down
Next to my wounds I'm small
Blooddrops of my heart
Rivers are by now
In my own blood I'll drown
I'm not sad after all
I'm only wishing now
That you will hear me out

Lay your healing breath for me to rest upon
Death I fear not, I fear living alone

My guardian angel please come on
I've been bleeding down to earth too long
Carry me through the rain, throughout the pain
If I'm not to live beside you, take me, save me
'Cause I don't want to bare infinity without you

Welcome me to the sky, way up high
Infinite tears I've cried for all my life

Lay your healing breath for me to rest upon
Death I fear not, I fear living alone

If I'm not to live beside you, take me, save me
'Cause I don't want to bare infinity without you
