You sayâ¦That Iâm not brave enough to stay
You sayâ¦That weakness makes me go away

Canât you see the emptiness inside me
Makes me bleed, itâs tearing me to pieces
So just let me say goodbye

Blame me not for leaving now,
For nothingâs worth without you
Realityâs a nightmare
That I wish to pass me by
If you canât forgive me now
The songs I wrote about you
Iâll sing for all eternity
Someway up from the sky

You sayâ¦My heart is bound to heal someway
It mayâ¦But I wonât be around that day

Canât you see the emptiness inside me
Makes me bleed, itâs tearing me to pieces
So just let me say goodbye

My time runs out today
Think itâs gonna be too late
Guess itâs time for my escape

Blame me not for leaving now,
For nothingâs worth without you
Realityâs a nightmare
That I wish to pass me by
If you canât forgive me now
The songs I wrote about you
Iâll sing for all eternity
Someway up from the sky
