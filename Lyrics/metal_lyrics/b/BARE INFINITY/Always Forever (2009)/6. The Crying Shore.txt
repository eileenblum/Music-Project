The moaning of the heathen trees
Through the pathways of the forest deep
As she's walking by the flowing stream
Like the spirits there she wants to creep

Listening to the wind that's calling
Coming from the caves
Rising from the earth
Offering her soul
Her soul is floating
Slowing as the river,
As the dying breath

Sail away beyond the weeping clouds
Filling with rain your journey home
The end lying ahead,
Far from the sounds
Close your eyes and bleed no more

Her life in wisdom's crystal
Like the wine which made me drunk
Leave now, meet your fate
Chase the stars, the wildest hunt

Sinful ghost in beauty adored
Wiping from the memories and lore
Welcome home to those who crawl
The faithful to the crying shore

Sail away beyond the weeping clouds
Filling with rain your journey home
The end lying ahead,
Far from the sounds
Close your eyes and bleed no more

Offering her soul
Her soul is floating
Slowly as the river
As the dying breath

Sail away beyond the weeping clouds
Filling with rain your journey home
The end lying ahead,
Far from the sounds
Close your eyes and bleed no more
