[Music: Tomas, Lyrics: Bare Infinity]

Behind your smile, under your confidence I'll crawl
Despite denial, know you'll resist but you will fall
Fight me all you want, I'll sit back and enjoy their view
When you're bred out, that's when I'll come and plunder you

Bet you can run, but bet yourself that you can't hide
So fucking fun to slowly fill you up inside
Filling your dreams, I know I'm messing with your head
So pray, my prey or better yet give it instead

Open up your soul, I'm coming deep and open up your mind
I'm coming hard with all your fears I'm gonna meet
I'm tearing all your past apart
Your darkest hideouts I will enter
I hope you're ready to surrender
Cause here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come

Now let me see, do you look desperate enough?
Set yourself free, admitting that you ain't that tough
I want to hear you say it, that you submit to my desire
Get on your knees and beg for it, and throw yourself into my fire

Are you ready for me? Get ready to bleed

Open up your soul, I'm coming deep and open up your mind
I'm coming hard with all your fears I'm gonna meet
I'm tearing all your past apart
Your darkest hideouts I will enter
I hope you're ready to surrender
Cause here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come

Here I fucking come.
