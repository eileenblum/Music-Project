[Music: Tomas, Lyrics: Bare Infinity]

Years have gone, they all passed me by
I'm still here, I'm standing nearby
All your fears and tears you're crying
Tide, it came, it tore us apart
I'm still here I'm blind in the dark
No strength left, you left me dying

Give yourself to me
Some little spark is burning still
All that I can feel this thrill is neverending

Through the dark clouds I can feel the sun glow
It will never go, never set, never fade
Come join this thrill, it's neverending

Give yourself to me

Now that all between us is dead
I remember all that you said
Word by word you kept on lying
Follow me, follow me to a place
Where you can rediscover me
Cover me in your grace
Will I ever live to take you there?
I don't care, hell I keep on trying

Give yourself to me
Some little spark is burning still
All that I can feel this thrill is neverending

Through the dark clouds I can feel the sun glow
It will never go, never set, never fade
Come join this thrill, it's neverending.
