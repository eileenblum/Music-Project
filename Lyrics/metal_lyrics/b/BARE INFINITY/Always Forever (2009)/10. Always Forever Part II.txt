Alwaysâ¦Foreverâ¦Iâll haunt youâ¦

No heart can take so much heartache
There comes a time when itâs too late
No lovinâ no promises
No fallinâ for what he says
No cryinââ¦No dyinââ¦No life for youâ¦

And as I carry my wounded soul in hands that tremble
A voice within alone in darkness cries:
ââ¦Falling for your deceiving wordsâ¦Never againâ¦â

Always, forever, Iâll haunt you, Iâll hate you
The day will come Iâll make you bleed for me
Always, forever, Iâll never forget you
Iâll make you pay, Iâll never leave you beâ¦

Befallen with anger, what has pulled me under.
Nay 'tis not my lover, 'tis something that tears asunder.
I reign these halls, salvation is not to come.
Vide! flowers have withered in thy hands.
Bore her God into my arms
Bore her God into demise!

I know thereâs a hell beneath me
But Iâm gonna drag you with me

Always, forever, Iâll haunt you, Iâll hate you
The day will come Iâll make you bleed for me
Always, forever, Iâll never forget you
Iâll make you pay, Iâll never leave you beâ¦

No lovinâ no promisesâ¦No fallinâ for what he says

I know thereâs a hell beneath me
But Iâm gonna drag you with me

No matter what we have become
Always, forever, as one we shall be
Always, forever, with meâ¦

I know thereâs a hell beneath me
But you will be rottinâ with me...!
