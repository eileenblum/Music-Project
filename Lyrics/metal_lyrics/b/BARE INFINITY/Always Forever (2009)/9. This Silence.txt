You hide behind the colors of blackened hearted fears
Put on this mask that get you going through the years
Look now the image in your mirror cracks away
All lies you dressed yourself in now fade
So take one last glance before it breaks

So run away from whispers of your ugliness, run far
Run like the coward little creature that you are
Over and over I have tried to heal your soul
But all is frozen there
I am freezing cold
So give yourself goodbye for he walks away

Dry your crying eyes from all blindness
Let me see you once before it all ends
Leave your shadows help me reach behind all this
Speak some words for I canât stand this silence

â¦End is near...

Dry your crying eyes from all blindness
Let me see you once before it all ends
Leave your shadows help me reach behind all this
Speak some words for I canât stand this silence

Come out of your shadowsâ¦

Come on now speak some wordsâ¦
