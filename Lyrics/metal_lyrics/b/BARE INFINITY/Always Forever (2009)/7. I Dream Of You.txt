[Music &amp; Lyrics: Tomas]

Took the joy out of my eyes
A blinded face with only a heart to feel and see
Tore apart both of our lives
Sank the ship of hope with waves of tears and cries
Tonight, a dream fell from the sky
Goodbye, the stars will shine tonight

If stars fade from you
I'll light one for you
Take your place in a dream so bright
I'll dream of you tonight

Time seems to just stand still
When I see you in the night
I prey this moment never ends
We never have to say goodbye
But you slowly fade away
Like the leaves in autumn breeze
All I have to say is
Why I see no dream tonight
Goodbye, the stars will shine tonight

If stars fade from you
I'll light one for you
Take your place in a dream so bright
I'll dream of you tonight
