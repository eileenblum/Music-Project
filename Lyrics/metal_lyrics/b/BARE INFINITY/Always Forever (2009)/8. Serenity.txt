The grey man cold and weary
Gazing upon the blind eyes
Still searching for the dream
Which was kept within
The boat is approaching from deep silent oceans

Take me away
Beyond the seas
Once more to feel
Once more to be free
Deliver me to fly again

As his embrace is smothering the beauty
I want to feel
The innocent light
The long forgotten spark
The boat is approaching from deep silent oceans

Take me away
Beyond the seas
Once more to feel
Once more to be free
Deliver me to fly again

With the howling of the wolves
The angels fall asleep
Your heart still in my hands
As you're staring back at me

Come I'll make you mine
Come dance with me, serenity

Take me away
Beyond the seas
Once more to feel
Once more to be free
Deliver me to fly again
