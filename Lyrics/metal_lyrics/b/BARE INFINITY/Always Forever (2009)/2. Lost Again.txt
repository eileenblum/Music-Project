[Music: Tomas, Lyrics: Bare Infinity]

In my life there used to be rain
I needed to break the silence
All I ever wanted in vain, I held for so long
There was sunshine after you came
I thought you could end my sadness
Now I'm going under again
I know I was wrong

Now all I can see is sadness dusting my dreams
All fantasies are slowly rotting inside
We could have lived a thousand beautiful dreams
Now everything is gone

When we met all dark I was in
Would suddenly stop to matter
When you kissed me all I could think
Was you are the one
Once again I know I'm deceived
I grow sadder and sadder
Having failed in love once again
Now that you're gone

Now all I can see is sadness dusting my dreams
All fantasies are slowly rotting inside
We could have lived a thousand beautiful dreams
Now everything is gone

All I wished was for you to unbreak
My heart from all solitude
Hoped you'd bring some sense
To my tired existence
Again I'm ripped off by any chance
Of redemption
Lost in my scarred depression once again
Now that you're gone

Now all I can see is sadness dusting my dreams (I'm lost again)
All fantasies are slowly rotting inside (Lost again)
We could have lived a thousand beautiful dreams
Now everything is gone

All that is left is the love that I feel for you
All that I wish is you come back
And reach for me
All that I have is the promise I keep from you
Gone with the same wind
That brought you to me that day
