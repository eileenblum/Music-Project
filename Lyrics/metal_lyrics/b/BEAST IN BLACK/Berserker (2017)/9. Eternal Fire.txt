Gazing far into the unknown
Young eyes glimmering in wonder and awe
How can one resist something so pure and strong

Eternal fire
Rebirth and triumph

Search goes on for this restless soul
Trying to find a peace of mind in the storm
Lost on earth, as if spellbound by some unseen
force

Eternal fire
Rebirth and triumph

Touch the flame and learn

A road may end but the journey does not
Wheel of infinity will never wear rust
Ageless voyager, unfolding the paths yet unwalked

There's no stillness it can not break
Nothing compares to its empyrean blaze
Throw yourself into the everlasting flame

Eternal fire
Rebirth and triumph

Eternal fire
Rebirth and triumph

Eternal fire
