The god we created
Plans our destinies
'Cause life without meaning
Is our sworn enemy
You're lost in the dark now
And you don't know what you do
So be careful what you wish for
It might just come true

God of all desire
Turn the wheel of fate
Seal the gates to heaven
Hell for all eternity
Four unholy angels
Take my offering
I'll redeem my debt now
Hell for all eternity

See the evil rising
It breaches the sky
The Sun has darkened
And the earth drinks blood
The mirror of reality
Is blown to smithereens
Your dream becomes a nightmare
Which you can't sleep away

God of all desire
Turn the wheel of fate
Seal the gates to heaven
Hell for all eternity
Four unholy angels
Take my offering
I'll redeem my debt now
Hell for all eternity

God of all desire
Turn the wheel of fate
Seal the gates to heaven
Hell for all eternity
Four unholy angels
Take my offering
I'll redeem my debt now
Hell for all eternity

God of all desire
Turn the wheel of fate
Seal the gates to heaven
Hell for all eternity
Four unholy angels
Take my offering
I'll redeem my debt now
Hell for all eternity
Hell for all eternity
