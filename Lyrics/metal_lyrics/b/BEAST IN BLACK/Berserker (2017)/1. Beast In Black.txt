Berserker

Betrayal, injustice, beheading of the innocent
The spawn of evil celebrate
Fierce anger, blind madness, invoke the Beast of Darkness
Black roaring death takes over spewing all its rage

Like a hellraiser, monster of rage
Unleash the fury through your sword of hate
Destroy and murder, retaliate
Harness the power of the Beast In Black

Berserker

I seek no salvation, only retaliation
These roots of wrath grow ever deep
Apostles, impostors, foul whores and putrid posers
It's time you greet the Dragonslayer

Like a hellraiser, monster of rage
Unleash the fury through your sword of hate
Destroy and murder, retaliate
Harness the power of the Beast In Black

The Beast is back, the Beast In Black
The Beast is back, the Beast In Black

Tormented and wounded, branded and persecuted
Torn inside out yet here I stand
Fierce anger, blind madness, invoke the Beast of Darkness
No mercy 'cause they all must die

Like a hellraiser, monster of rage
Unleash the fury through your sword of hate
Destroy and murder, retaliate
Harness the power of the Beast In Black

Like a hellraiser, monster of rage
Unleash the fury through your sword of hate
Destroy and murder, retaliate
Harness the power of the Beast In Black
