broken vials shattered glass another failed experiment
burn the pages split the wages leave no witnesses or evidence
vapors seeping higher from the floor of chain reactions
permeating choking at the lungs obscuring vision
feeling every impulse fire burning hotter shining brighter
as the brain accepts the serum feel the anguish do its worst
seal off the corridor decomposing and erased
discarded with the rest
no vitals, no pulse, no interest

exploding from existence leaving just a bodily trace with the scourge of faded memory driving all itâs hate
genetically corrupt toxic fragments laid to waste
pollution being hungers to inflict the wounded race
altered creature out for blood with bitter evil tendencies
all you breathe the terror ripping vengeance dependency
a night inside the mind probing at the depths
countless ages would enslave and never reach the other side
every failed mutation knows that pain is not lost in this hell
the orations and the legends praise the damned animal
dawn brings light that hasnât killed but itâs left you something worse
now I am become death lost between worlds

LOST

Praise the damned animal
Lost between worlds
