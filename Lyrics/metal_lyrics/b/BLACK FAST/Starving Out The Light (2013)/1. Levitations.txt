The first order a call to arms for reason
Treasonous butchers casting their hooks into the wells
Swollen the tides are bulging and calving the capsules
Rising the waters roar with bellowing swells
Do you speak with the trees of the tallest to help remember?
If ashes and embers left records ever to tell?
Age of death without decay and the carcass is rising
Gravity finds the axe true aiming to fell

Cast out of a dream into waking darkness
Crippled frozen and pulsing the nerves convulse
Dusk accelerates fast over the horizon
The edge recedes under feet
We hover above the ravine

Suspended animation
Death spin
Levitation

Death of an epoch an echo across creation
Spilled on the shores the boundaries of extinction
Winterstarved, receive the terms of surrender
From the wasteland barren, returning to its throne
