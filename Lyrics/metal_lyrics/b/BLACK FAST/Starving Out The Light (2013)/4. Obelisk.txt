wired night burning out lamenting the exhaustion
immediate hunt and the imminent slaughter
running blind burning mind overcome and weary
outcome of the endgame is as hollow as the instinct
now against the towering relic
witnessing your fear become your singular possession
legions bred to build and reap and sever off the senses
eradicating flesh and bone immortalized in stone

lashed and whipped with wind and bit by bitter egoâs torment
descending through dimensions darkened by dementia
shrines in caves and lost in forest ruins speaking to their times
but the ceilings will come crashing down and better draw the lines

a warning of wonder and fear to behold
possessed and drunk with lust and power in the light of the ashen glow
a wealth of souls to be bought and sold
their thoughts and minds to own
falling into nothingness
swallowing every throne

piercing at the sky and in itâs shadow a growing fear
visceral and consuming all yet higher as they build
legions bled, never fed, naked to the yield
but the truth is so much more commanding of the weaponry to wield

rising from the wilderness, the will to live
