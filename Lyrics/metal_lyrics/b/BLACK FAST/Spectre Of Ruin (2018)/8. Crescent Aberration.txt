Fall away
Blistered blackened carcass
Peel away - rotting barren husk
Its form unfurls in this neon realm
Radioactive and retching
Pulsing signal - the insect sings
Nightmare life form oscillating

Fear its very presence
Absent of all essence
'Conjured ascension risen to the surface
Marching without any purpose
Growing - appetite for bloodshed
Glowing - drunk on radiation sickness
Roaming old one - live again
Tyrant of the wasteland
Error of the fossil record
Summoned from the abyss

Reclamation - vengeance makes its entrance
Oblivion - mutual assurance
Virulent spore this mote of dust
Bathed in aberration
Nasty and brutish - wolves of war
Another failed mutation

Fall away - amputated existence
Smoldering - embalmed in nuclear twilight
Its form unfurls in this neon realm
Radioactive and breathing
Pulsing signal - the insect sings
Oscillating nightmare being
