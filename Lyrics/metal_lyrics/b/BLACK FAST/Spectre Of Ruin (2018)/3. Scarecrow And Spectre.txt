Chaos splits the sky and unifies all portents
A great otherworldly howl and futile to defend
Chromatic shrieking radiation rings from the feathered vortex
Riotous cacophony from the lacerated winds
We are the seers
The architects of plague
We are the one and the many
A thousand different names

Cower as you call to us
You should never have been freed
Pray you're dead when our comets come
Worthless progenies

The sky is black and blotted with a satiated frenzy
Scarecrow arbitrator between the lying and the others
Never since those windswept plains has come such annihilation
But this one is the shadow that was feared since we were born

Hammers swing to seal the tombs without a good word spoken
Every curse on that vile crypt cast with glorious commotion
Locusts pick the harvests clean begging for atonement
Ground gives way and joins the sky in the shadow of the eclipse

Once more I stand in awe and weep before such visions
What's more I'm looking on your temples as they burn
I've shook the ground before to rid a surface nuisance

But never have I had the pleasure to look upon such works
I've buried all your cities as you've pissed away your lives
I've relished every second of your eventual demise
So fight yourselves and eat your fallen hiding from your truth
I always have and always will be here when you are through
