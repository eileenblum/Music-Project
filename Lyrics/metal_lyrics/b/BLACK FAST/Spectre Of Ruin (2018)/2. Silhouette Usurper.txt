Shape shifting consecration delights in this matrix of blood
Hissing serpents murmuration feasts in the raging flood
Your warden of despair
Prophetic lifeless glare
Foul tempest lurches forth and marches right in league
Spurning out a pact of murder- not before my death's foreseen

Sunken eyes eaten away
Adipocere mocking wraith
Fleshless bones in the pyre's flames
Plume of smoke and none remains

Tortured by this vision - double walking entity
Gas lit premonition - light betraying reveries
Cursed apparition
Scavenger! Harvesting!
Violence! Inquisition
The hoards of omens haunting me

Silhouette usurper - open up your pits of hell
Collector! - say you've come for me
Silhouette usurper - open up your pits of hell
Ride out wretch be free
