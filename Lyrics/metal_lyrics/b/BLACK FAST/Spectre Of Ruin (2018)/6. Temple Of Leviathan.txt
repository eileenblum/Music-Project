Years I've spent in this creature's craw - I am its hostage
Circling devils spiral round and churn the waters surface
Lurking shadow twisting down below into the growing maelstrom
Delirious into its jaws I was taken by a beast

And there are no stars for me to navigate by
And now there is no light for me to see
I am adrift on some creatures whim
Passenger of disease

In these catacombs of madness
Isolated rumination
Temple of leviathan
Symbiote dependency
Catacombs of madness
At the bottom of the world
Bowels of leviathan lumbering monstrosity

And there are still no stars for me to navigate the sky
No more light to be seen
I'm the prisoner of some creatures whim
Passenger of disease

I must have been hunted down
To become another meal
I wish first I would have drowned
This cannot be real

And who will rid this loathsome muse
Crude and only useless
I'm the titan of the seas this virus merely hubris
Still I shudder sick inside and set out for the answer
Cetus I with man inside and sinking down with cancer

And so I will dissolve
And now I do dissolve
