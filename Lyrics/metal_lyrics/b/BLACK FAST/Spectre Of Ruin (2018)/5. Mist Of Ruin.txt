Stalemate - all is quiet
Pummeled by bombardment
Splintered forests
Shattered trunks
Vultures gather to the drone of war drums
As the toolmakers take the stage - the valves are opened
On tens of thousands downwind
Soon to drown on dry land

Those who once would dwell in darkness and dream of the augur's visions
More still who in spilling blood would read the sprawling entrails
Care the tongue out - seize the lungs - silencing the sages
Severed link to knowing when and how we meet our end

Throw the curtain open!
Hail the rolling sky!
Breathe the corrupted ether!
Bleeding from the eyes!

Spellbound by the churning cloud as it writhes into the ages
The heavens shed like leprous skin
Rife with the disease of life
Death march of green and yellow turns the ground before it silver
Soul sucking mist of horror raining death across its pages

Now you meet your end
Drowning in your skin
