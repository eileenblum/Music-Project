Flies have taken this perverse asylum
Disease has hold where others would not dare
Forced confessions - colony of lepers
Deathly stench is clinging to the air
Footsteps where there should not be a presence
Starving voices groaning in despair
Sadistic maestro wields the scalpel like a bull whip
Erratic technique sprays the wall with blood

Cold horizon of unmarked graves
Ledger entry - numbered days
Laughing shadows - labyrinth eyes
Bandaged in a cloak of lies

Unwanted visitor, levitates, comes to taunt me
Tormented prisoner, no escape, from this haunting

Sideshow in this carnival of nightmares
Perspiration frozen to my brow
Altered with a steady-handed ice pick
Fragments of me dripping to the floor

Down that corridor to the furnace and beyond
Ingested by the smokestack and ejected further on
Random rearranging in that crucible of death
The shadow of that silo is my final chariot
