So long I have waited for this moment
This toxic malignant breed
Forged in acidic boiling oceans
Hatching brood take wing

Phantom I am - creator
Sneer of cold command - no master
Anthropocene event
Polluted to your end
Contusion of the land
Thy name be sapien

Now suffer - cry out - sing for me
Mother - into extinction - on your knees

Anthropocene event - pollution to you end
Contusion of this land - thy name be sapien

Like a weed growing into the sun
Cut you down when my work is done

Spreading - across the cradle the pregnant fertile crescent
Bleeding - blinking moon draws wolves in to the excrement
Bloated - distended womb the stillborn starts to ferment
Bloom! Descend one flowering experiment

Phantom I am- creator
Sneer of cold command - no master
Anthropocene event - pollution to your end
Contrusion of this land - thy name be sapien
Licking clean my carapace drawn out from hibernation
Fpollinating virus - spread your wings - abomination
Like a weed growing into the sun
Cut you down when my work is done

I will cut you down
