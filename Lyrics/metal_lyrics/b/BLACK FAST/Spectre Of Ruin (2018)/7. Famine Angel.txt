Many names I have known
In countless ages conjured
Of foreign tongues and darkened times
Invoked but never pardoned
Vain attempts on famished lips
And shadowed whips bartered
In dire dealings at the fire's hearth
Vanished sons and daughters

Of the mist - spectre rides
Famine angel - treason bride
Hunting seraphs rule the night
Mounting heads of regicide

Taking forms, of severed horns, written of in threes
Invading kingdom, of the living
Bring to its knees
Augur evil, vilified, in tattered rags they see
I'm the mistress of the moon, corrupted blasphemy
Possessions at aix, I'm to credit
Told them I was he
Watched the sentence from on high
Laughing on the wing

I've boarded ships and brought pestilence
Damning all to death
Inspired servant of the insect
The mare upon your breath
I'm the empress of the moon, your kingdom is my fodder
Lustful convents bear my mark vanished sons and daughters
