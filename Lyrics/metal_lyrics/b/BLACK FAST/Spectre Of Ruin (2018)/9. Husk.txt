There's a rumor that you're speaking in tongues
And you've lost all control
Motor functions not a power you hold
Least not a power of yours

O queen of mischief - mysterious one
I want your beautiful soul
Your tales are legend
The things that you've done
They say you're not of this world

Contorted angel - they sent you a priest
But you were busy in told
You're a weapon of the darkest design
You claim you're centuries old

Now come with me
Suffer as my fugitive
Sliding in between
Other worlds
Into dreams
You and I infiltrate - horror
Manifesting scream take them down

Unholy spectre
Can this be the end
Am I finally free
Transmission in the marks on my skin
You know I've tried to come clean
You know I've tried to come clean
O let this be a dream
