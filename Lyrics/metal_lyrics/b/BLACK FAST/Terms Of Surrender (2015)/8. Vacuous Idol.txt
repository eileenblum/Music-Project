MY WORLD'S CONSUMED, UNVEILED AS I LEAVE RETREATING THROUGH SPACE, WEAVING THROUGH DREAMS ENVELOPING FEAR, COLLAPSING IN ON ME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE HERE, AND NOTHING FOR ME NOTHING! NO! SILENCE IN DEATH, VIOLENT REPRIEVE EMPTY YOUR LUNGS, NO AIR TO BREATHE OH, RETURNING,
WADING THROUGH DISEASE APERTURE! OPEN! REVEAL ALL TO ME! WEAKENING PLEAS, VANISHING WORDS VACUOUS FORM, TO WHICH I CONVERSE CONFINED TO TRAVERSE A DREAM, UNRAVELING MY MIND AT THE SEAMS OF SICKNESS, DESPAIR, I GLEAM OH ISOLATION! REPRIEVE! THIS CRUCIBLE HOLLOW, MIGRATION
GROWS IN ME NONE HAVE SURVIVED, ALL ARE EXTINCT OH, RETURNING, WADING THROUGH DISEASE APERTURE! OPEN! REVEAL ALL TO ME! WEAKENING PLEAS, VANISHING WORDS VACUOUS IDOL, THE WITCH, THE CURSE
