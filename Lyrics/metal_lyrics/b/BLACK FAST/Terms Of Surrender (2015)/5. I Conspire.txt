CONCUSSIVE BLAST, CASCADING FREEZING FAST, SELF-DEFLATING BROODING WASTE, FED TO THE PYRE STATIC TIRADE, UNINSPIRED MOCKING EVERY MOVE, QUESTION EVERY STEP WASTING FLEETING MOMENTS WITH EVERY BREATH FALLING FASTER INTO LESSER LIGHT AS I COME SCREAMING IN ON CERTAIN DEATH
EXISTENCE GRANTED, DAMNATION EARNED INFESTED SEED, THE INFECTION WORSE RELENT IN SILENCE, EVERY HOUR DIRE YOU FOOL! YOU WRETCH! YOU FOUL CONSPIRER! WHITHER IN WAITING, REJECTING THE HOST CONVERSE IN SILENCE, ALWAYS ALONE I TIRE IN THIS TORMENT, I LANGUISH ALL IN STRIDE
TRY TO CLING TO EVERY MOMENT AND IT WASHES WITH THE TIDE I CONVERSE WITH THIS CONSPIRER, MORE SO THAN ALL THE REST IT ASSURES ME I AM EMPTY, NEVER TO CONFESS NO SIGIL ON MY BANNER, WASTE EVERY FLEETING BREATH ENTRUSTED WITH A LANGUAGE, BUT DARE NOT SPEAK OF DEATH ALONE
WITH THIS CONSPIRER, REFRAIN FROM ALL THE REST OUR VIGIL KEEPS THE MOON LIT, FORGIVE LESS THAN WE FORGET I TIRE IN THIS TORMENT, I LANGUISH ALL IN STRIDE TRY TO CLING TO EVERY MOMENT AND IT WASHES WITH THE TIDE I CONVERSE WITH THIS CONSPIRER, MORE THAN ALL THE REST IT
ASSURES ME I AM EMPTY, NEVER TO FORGET EXPIRE IN WAITING! CONVERSE IN SILENCE! DIE ALONE I TIRE IN THIS TORMENT, I LANGUISH ALL IN STRIDE TRY TO CLING TO EVERY MOMENT AND IT WASHES WITH THE TIDE I CONVERSE WITH THIS CONSPIRER, MORE THAN ALL THE REST IT ASSURES ME I AM
EMPTY, NEVER TO FORGET!
