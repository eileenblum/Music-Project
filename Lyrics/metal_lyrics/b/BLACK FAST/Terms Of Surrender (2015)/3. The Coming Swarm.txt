OF GRANDER VISIONS, DELUSIONS ABOUND STARK CONJURATIONS, AND THE MEANS UNSOUND IN THE COMING SWARM OF MY THOUGHTS I'M FOUND UPON BROKEN PILLARS OF DOUBT AND DOWN ON FRACTURED LIMBS WOUNDED LEFT TO CRAWL THROUGH THE WASH AND TIDE, ENGULFED AND SPRAWLED OUT BARREN,
BLEEDING, RIPPED OPEN, ALL TO THE ENDLESS OCEAN, ON MY BACK I CALL TOSSING IN ITS THROES AGAIN TRANSPOSING PROSE TO VERSE PREPARING FOR THE WORST AGAIN SO DO YOUR WORST NO BORROWED TENETS OF CORRODING FAITH JUST CONTRADICTIONS AND ERODING SHAME IN OF WHAT WAS NOTHING,
NOW IS EVEN LESS IT'S MY DYING HOUR, NOTHING TO CONFESS BORN ADRIFT IN A FLOODING PLANE, ROTTING STENCH IN A FORGOTTEN WRECK RECEDING WATERS, FERMENTING FLESH OPPRESSIVE SICKLE NOW REAPING DEATH LITTERED CARCASS, BONE AND DUST WOUNDED SKY RAINING WILL TO RUST IRON CORE
STRUCK AGAINST THE STONE TATTERED, BROKEN, STREWN! DARKENED SKIES, FIXED TO PEN LAMENT HAUNTED VIGIL, NO RELENT SEEDING VENGEANCE, BLEEDING WRATH FIXED UPON THEIR BATTLEMENTS! NOW THE DROUGHT HANGS HIGH AND FREE IN THE SEARING SUN, SUPREMACY NO MERCY, SANCTUM, NO RETREAT
JUST MY ISOLATION AND THIS DECREE OH BIRDS OF PENANCE, CRASHING DOWN ON ME STRIKE AT MIDNIGHT, SET ME FREE INTERNAL BLEEDING FASTER DROWNING ME DESPERATE MOON RETURN TO ME TOSSED IN ITS THROES AGAIN TRANSPOSING PROSE TO VERSE PREPARING FOR THE WORST AGAIN SO DO YOUR
WORST
