LAPSE AGAIN INTO LESSENING LIGHT AILING SPIRIT, FAILING MIND DOWNWARDS, MIRED, ENDING LIFE STEEPED IN PITCH, BLACK AS NIGHT CLOSING IN AND PRESSING ON NEVER ENDING, NO BOTTOM SWALLOWED IN DARKNESS, IMPLORING CRIES MOUTHLESS WONDER, YOU DRIFT AND DIE AND CLIMB, UP THROUGH
THE SUBSTRATE, YOU RISE DEVOLVING AND BLIND CONSUMING THEIR EYES BUT THE SKY HAS OTHER PLANS TODAY NO NEED FOR WORDS, NOTHING TO SAY CORNERED TYRANTS LEFT BETRAYED COWER, CONQUERED, ALL ERASED DEVOLVING AND BLIND CONSUMING THEIR EYES AND FOR THE SERVANT, THE SONG IS
ABSENT THE VERDICT IS JUST STRUNG UP HIGH TO HANG DEFIANT UNTIL THE DUST BECOMES OF US SWALLOWED IN DARKNESS, IMPLORING CRIES MOUTHLESS WONDER, YOU DRIFT AND DIE UNTIL THE DUST BECOMES OF US
