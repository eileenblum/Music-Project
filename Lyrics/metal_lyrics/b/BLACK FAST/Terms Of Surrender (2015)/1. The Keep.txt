THROWN OPEN OUT INTO THE NIGHT NOW SET IN MOTION, NO END IN SIGHT BITTERLY THE SEASON CHARGES ON NO SURRENDER, JUST A POISON TASTE FREEZING ME IN TIME AND SPACE OF INDECISION, INFINITE WASTE OF TIME AS ONE BY ONE WITH MY FEARS I FALL ALWAYS CONQUERED AS MY DREAMS
DISSOLVE WAVE AFTER WAVE MY CURTAIN CALLS, CALL TO ME! IN THE COLD OF MORNING, AFTER THE BLAST WITH THE FALLOUT RINGING, THAT THIS WILL PASS DORMANT SPELL CAST, IN OF DARKNESS DRAWS, SCOURGE OF MADNESS, HERE TO REAP THE COST IN THE COMING WINTER, THE STORM OF OUR ENDING
IN THE TWILIGHT AGES OF NIGHT DESCENDING HERE I'M FOUND, IN THE FRENZY, LOST THIS TOMB MY PALACE, OF FORGOTTEN FROST INTO DARKNESS SCOURGE OF MADNESS DRAWS AS ONE BY ONE WITH MY FEARS I FALL CONQUERED ALWAYS WATCHING DREAMS DISSOLVE, WAVE AFTER WAVE THIS CURTAIN CALLS!
CALLING ME! WHAT A WASTE
