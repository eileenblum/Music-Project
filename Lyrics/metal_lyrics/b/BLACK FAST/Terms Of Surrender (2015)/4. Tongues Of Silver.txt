ALTARS HAVE BURNED IN WAKELESS STATES I'VE LAPSED SPIRES I'VE SEEN, CRASHING DREAMS OF VAPORS AND VISIONS ESCAPING, ENTRANCED! COMING TO AND THROUGH POSSESSION OTHER FORMS AND SHATTERED WORLDS OUT OF THE WRECKAGE, IN THE COMING SWARM BEYOND DEPRIVATION ERADICATION, OF
LIGHT INTERRED SILENCED GHOSTS, SING UNHEARD DYING LANGUAGE, SILVER TONGUES CONQUERED ANCIENTS SPILLING BLOOD COME TO ORDER, COME THE PAIN COME NEGLECT, INTO THE FRAY COME THE RECKONING, COME THE SUFFERING SUBJUGATION, ALL ENSLAVED FROTHING MOUTH, THE RIVER WRITHES
CLOTTING, THE HORROR, SWARMING FLIES SILVER TONGUES, DROWNING FLOODS CLAIMING VICTIMS, PUTREFIED SEAL IT OFF, DEALING DEATH RUNNING OUT, SEWING MOUTHS STARVING LUNGS, DEPRIVING, EXPLODE AND DROWN THE SILVER TONGUED ANCIENTS MEETING REPRISE OF SILENCED GHOSTS RECLAIM
DEMISE
