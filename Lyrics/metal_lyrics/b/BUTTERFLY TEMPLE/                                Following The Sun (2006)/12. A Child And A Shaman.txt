I gaze with amazement
At a world without name
Beneath cloudy raiment
From whence now I came

I hear as the grass grows
At spring's tender hand.
My heart pumps green billows
To every stem

[Both:]
A trouvere of a new May
In butterfly's fane
I'm a note of the great lay
Composed by the main

Song of a Shaman:
A theme that is profound
I play at my ease
When wandering spellbound
In ecstatic bliss

I dance like a moth with my senses numb
As did my feet in ancient times
To a million souls primeval rhymes
That from the inside beat my drum

They see just a shape caught in fire-lit spree
A wondrous image in essence nude
And envy this godlike solitude
(They, who) endowed with gift of saying "we"

[Both:]
Of nature unspoken we share different shapes
Of stellar sonata, of nightingale's staves
Yet face of each other we cannot descry
This "Mirour de l'Omme" lies before our eyes!

[Song of a Shaman:]
A paradox's door-man
A shepherd of dawn
With my hands I'm warming
The fiery glow

They attribute me wonders
Of ignorance's van
Forsaking The Marvel
The one that is Man
