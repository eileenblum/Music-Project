I am not of Jesus Christ I'm not
and I am not a Satanic Child I'm not
and I know not no property of high or low
and I know where I come from and whereto I will go

Rat race and symbols. Crucifix and flesh.
Politics and fashion. Religion and death.

I am just a human being I am
and I am a eat-sleep-f*cking-machine I am
and I am another mortal piece of meat.
Yet I am too fast and alive for you to hand no sign on me.

Holy writings. Tax and Law. Angel wings or frying.
Suicides no use at all. We're all born to die.

I am not no more a sinner or saint than f*cking all of you.
I am no more close or far away from the truth.
I am no believer or receiver of holy or unholiness.
I am I'm f*cking no more or less.
