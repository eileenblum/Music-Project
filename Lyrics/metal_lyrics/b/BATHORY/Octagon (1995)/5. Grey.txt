They say we're free to speak to speak whatever we may have
to say and that we're free to wear it all in every f*cking way.
It's up to f*cking you to fulfill your damned f*cking life
with ease and to carry any symbol, view or dream that
you may f*cking please.

But hairstyles never cease to stir their f*cking minds
en masse. Your clothes will always bite big chumps
right out of their concrete ass. You'll be corrected.
censored and asked to appear in a milder way.
And in the end eventually if you're weak you'll
fade in grey.

Authority. Society. Parents. Teachers. Employees and God.
Authority. Society. Parents. Teachers. Employees and God.
Fade into grey. Fade into grey. Fade into grey.

For every punch you'll take in life, learn to always at least
give two. Don't ever let somebody get away shitting on you.
There may be laws to follow. Drugs to stay away from in
your life. But never live it feeling your damned hands and
feets always being tied.

But hairstyles never cease to stir their fucking minds
en masse. Your clothes will always bite big chumps
right out of their concrete ass. You'll be corrected.
censored and asked to appear in a milder way.
And in the end eventually if you're weak you'll
fade in grey.
