Blind fools who see only what they tell you to
Open up your eyes you might see it too
See there is a lot to see within you too
Don't be like the rest and let them take it from you

Dumb fools who say only what they tell you to
Speak up and find that there is more truth within you than you knew
Somewhere someday you will stand before it too
Trust me there is a never ending mountainside to climb for you too

To enter your mountain
Go into your mountainside
To enter one's mountainside
Will take its man

Who enters his mountain
With or without sword in hand
Who enters his mountainside
He will learn

Deaf fools who hear only what they tell you to
Open up your ears you might hear it too
Listen there is a wild storm within you too
Burst out use its powers don't be a

Damn fool how can you follow paths not made by nor for you
The only way you will ever need to walk is right there for you
Somewhere someday you will stand before it too
Trust me there is a never ending mountainside to climb for you too

To enter your mountain
Go into your mountainside
To enter one's mountainside
Will take its man

Who enters his mountain
With or without sword in hand
Who enters his mountainside
He will learn

(He who enter...)
He who enters his mountain
He who enters his mountain
He who enters his mountain
He who enters his mountain
(He who enters his mountain
He who enters his mountain
He who enters his mountain
Into one's mountainside)
