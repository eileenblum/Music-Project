God of Thunder
Who crack the sky
Swing your Hammer
Way up high

In chariot of gold
Ride across the clouds
The black storm is unfold
Burning mist is but a shroud

Seeds and honey
Milk and blood
A Sacrifice
To Thunder God

Laid in ship of Oak
On final sail to fate
Steel is at side
Drifting to the open Gates of

Valhalla
Shields of gold
Valhalla
Great warriors hall

I swing my sword in the wind
I feel the powers all within

Valhalla
Valhalla

God of Thunder
Lightning rain
The Winds of Glory
Whispers your name

Pounding pounding
Of hooves and wheels
Forks of lightning
At your heels

Sword of steel
Held up high
Lightning strikes
From blackened skies

Fallen heroes
In Battle slain
Awaits my arrival
At the gates of

Valhalla
Shields of gold
Valhalla
Great warriors hall

I raise my fist to the Air
In the creed of powers and glory swear

[Repeat chorus]

(I swing my sword in the wind
I feel the powers all within)

[Repeat chorus]

(I raise my fist to the Air
In the creed of powers and glory swear)

(Valhalla...)
