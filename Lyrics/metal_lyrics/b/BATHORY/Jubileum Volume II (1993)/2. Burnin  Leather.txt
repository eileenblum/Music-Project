[Recorded October 1987. Never before released]

It's something you can't fake it's all within
Seek for the truth deep inside
Let it open your heart let in the flame
Receive it with mind open wide

Shake those bonds loose of religion and gospel
But remain a diehard believer
Never let your dreams die the power is all within
Ands let the flame become your redeemer

Climb the mountainside of your own soul
You'll get so much in return
Ands once you are master in control of within
Then your leather is ready to burn

Burnin' leather Burnin' leather
Burnin' leather Burnin' leather

A coward is no warrior with a heart full of pain
To wield your sword loose lead your fear astray
Open your heart and it'll all comes clear
If your heart is true you've got nothing to fear

Climb the mountainside of your own soul
You'll get so much in return
Ands once you are master in control of within
Then your leather is ready to burn

Burnin' leather Burnin' leather
Burnin' leather Burnin' leather

A coward is no warrior with a heart full of pain
To wield your sword loose lead your fear astray
Open your heart and it'll all comes clear
If your heart is true you've got nothing to fear

[repeat verse 1 and 2]
[chorus]
