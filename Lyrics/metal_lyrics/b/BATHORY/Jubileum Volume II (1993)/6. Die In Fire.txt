[Recorded June 1983. 4-track demo, never before released]

When horny flames begins to rise
To burn your flesh and bone
That's when you realize you've never
Been so scared and alone

You start to cry you're gonna die
So pray for all your sins
The flames begins to reach too high
The fire burns and wins

Die in fire. Die in fire
Die in fire. Die in fire

You can't take the heat much longer
You can't stand the burning pain
The night is far too dark for angels
So light up the night with flames

Nothing really turns me on
Like seeing you burn to dust
But you are not alone to feel the heat
My body burns with lust

Die in fire. Die in fire
Die in fire. Die in fire

Now when your body burned to dust
Is spread by the midnight breeze
I gotta find another girl
To satisfy my needs

I'll tie her up and then once more
The all caressing flames
Shall rise again to light the night
And she will scream of pain

Die in fire. Die in fire
Die in fire. Die in fire
