A sorcery written in blood
Summoned by a witch in the dawn
Give all the Hell cause youâve still got the strength
To start up the Black Metal storm

The darkness possessing - you thought that you could
The blood starts to freeze in your veins
Your mindset is high and itâs all to be real
Youâre feeling thereâs no longer strength

I ride the flame
You take the pain
Iâll raise the dead
Black Metal night is here again
I ride the flame
You take the pain
Iâll raise the dead
Black Metal night is here again

It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame
It's the RETURN of my master Satan
It's the RETURN of soul burning pain

Sacrifice a virgin to the princess blood of Hell
Sacrifice the children to the queen of magic spell
Gather masses run in circles scream for mercy burning flame
Living hard this is the master let them feel the blood and pain

Theyâre superior and soldiers of one
His angels of goodness have lied
The demonâs despising the virginâs cries
To the Heavenâs of dust in the night

I ride the flame
You take the pain
Iâll raise the dead
Black Metal night is here again
I ride the flame
You take the pain
Iâll raise the dead
Black Metal night is here again

It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame
It's the RETURN of my master Satan
It's the RETURN of soul burning pain
