[KISS Cover]

Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun, whoo-ooo-ooooooh
Got you under their thumb

Hit it!

Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

[Chorus:]
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond

Darkness will fall on the city
It seems to follow you too, whoo-ooo-ooooooh
And though you don't ask for pity
There's nothin' that you can do, no, no

[Chorus:]
Whoo, black diamond
Whoo, black diamond

[Solo]

Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun, whoo-ooo-ooooooh
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

[Chorus:]
Whoo, black diamond, yeah
Whoo, black diamond
