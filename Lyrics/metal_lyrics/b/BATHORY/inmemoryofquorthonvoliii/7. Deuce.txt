[KISS Cover]

Get up
And get your grandma outta here
Pick up
Old Jim is working hard this year
And baby
Do the things he says to do
Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
Hes worth a deuce

Honey
Don't put your man behind his years
And baby
Stop crying all your tears
Baby
Do the things he says to do
Do it

Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
Hes worth a deuce

And baby, if you're feeling good
Yes baby if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
Yeah
