Silverwing see the moon is rising
way up high in the night
it's time to spread your wings
and to fly across the sky
the sun is set and it's fire resting
safe your wings from it's golden glow
so spread your wings to greet the midnight sky

You've been waiting for the sun
to set behind the mountains high so...

Silverwing - spread your wings and fly
Silverwings across the midnight sky
Silverwing - spread your wings and fly
Silverwings across the midnight sky

Fly until the morning when anew the day
will bring the golden fire...

Clouds ablaze the horizon glowing
soon the hour of twilight here
the stars awaiting the end of light and day
soon up high the moon is risen
clear the sky the dark is near
so stand to spread your silverwings again

Silverchild of the moon your time is here
to stand and to spread your wings so...

Silverwing - spread your wings and fly
Silverwings across the midnight sky
Silverwing - spread your wings and fly
Silverwings across the midnight sky

Fly until the morning when anew the day
will bring the golden fire...

Silverwing - spread your wings and fly
Silverwings across the midnight sky
Silverwing - spread your wings and fly
Silverwings across the midnight sky
