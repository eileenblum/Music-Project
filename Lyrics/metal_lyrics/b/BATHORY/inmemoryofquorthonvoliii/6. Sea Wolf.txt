Into the granite
Stave by stave
Carved ploughwise
Now read my tale
The raging ocean I have sailed
Many a man I have maimed

Shields I have crushed with my sword
Women have I pleased endless nights
On foreign coast my brother did fall
He now dines in hall up high

Erected the stone against a twilight sky
Read Sea Wolf's tale

From the coasts of the west to sarkland
To the marshlands and the forests of the east
High adventures
Great riches and wine
Blood shed
Great battles and feasts

My stone firm in mother earth through rain and time
read Sea Wolf's tale
