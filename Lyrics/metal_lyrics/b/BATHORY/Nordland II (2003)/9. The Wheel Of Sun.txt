As the night divides the day : the dark will come to everyone
fear will strike the hearts of all : the hearts of all both old and young
the fool may be carefree : unknown to him the troubles upon his masters brow
but death us all will grasp with hand so cold to pull us down

And so the sun is low again : along horizon a crimson blaze
soon the dusk us all embrace : the shadows long as life itself
but in the light of moon and stars above be sure yee everyone
tomorrow new a day will dawn : none stay can the course of the wheel of sun

As sure as it is true once we all shall die : true it is not all men lives
a king shall fall : a child be born : the Gods will take and Gods will give
before your time has come : do climb your mountainside on a morning fair
and smell the fragrance carried by the wind : let it blow freely through your hair

damned he who sits still and curse woe the dark but will do not a thing
to light the torch : to shed the light : for him the dark is all within
slowly across the sky the golden disc of life it tumbles on
the wheel of life and light : rebirth : the seasons : behold the wheel of sun
