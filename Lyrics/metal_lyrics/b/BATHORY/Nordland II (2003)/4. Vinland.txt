Forward : ride the ocean's waves
be bold : glory to the brave

Deep the sea : above me eternal sky
freezing winds : cold to the limbs : the waves are high
sleepless nights : the bleak moonlight : the chill and damp
by morning light : a strip of land we see

Vinland : crossing the endless raging ocean
Vinland : follow the stars and the flight of the raven
Vinland : watch the horizon for the strip of the western land
Vinland : plough through the waves white wolfs at a raging sea

The wind : mighty : fills your sail
onward : to the land in your fathers' tale

Forward brothers : reward awaits the bold and brave
white sons of north : through hail and storms : we rode the waves
we beach the ship upon the coast of western land
and rest our tired limbs among the reed and sand

Vinland : crossing the endless raging ocean
Vinland : follow the stars and the flight of the raven
Vinland : watch the horizon for the strip of the western land
Vinland : plough through the waves white wolfs at a raging sea
