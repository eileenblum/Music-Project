The lies of Christ will lose
the ways of hell I chose
I drink the floating blood
defy the fury of God

I have turned my back on Christ
to hell I have sacrificed
I have made love to the Pagan Queen
the gates of hell I have seen

I heard the angels cry
I watched the witches fly
I saw the clouds of death
Slowly blackening the sky

I read the book of spell
I chimed death's ancient bell
and when I die I have a place
reserved in hell

In conspiracy with Satan

I ride the bloodstained goat
I let the brewage float
I have seen the reaper's face
and walked through eternal haze

I have kissed my master's hand
I have seen the children of the damned
I heard the demons call
and seen a thousand virgins fall

[repeat verse 3]

[repeat verse 4]

[repeat chorus]
