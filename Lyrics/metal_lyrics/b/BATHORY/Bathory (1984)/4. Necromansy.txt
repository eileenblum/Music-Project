Heil satanic majesty
tonight we sacrifice
We drink our own blood
and blasphemy while
the moon is our only light

We whisper our sorcery
the acid takes us high
We sing the songs of Mayhem
Wingless angel
in soundless flight

Our bodies completes the circle
with blood we draw the signs of hell
Chant the force of Pandemonium
and recite the words of spell

Necromancy

I gather up the force of darkness
to bring damnation lust and war
Demand all heaven's virgins
to bend before our horny lord

Tonight nothing is too sacred
we desecrate and live in sin
Inhaling the stench of rotten flesh
and of burning winds

Descend from blackened skies
on soundless magic wings
To spread the words of Satan
and live in eternal sin
