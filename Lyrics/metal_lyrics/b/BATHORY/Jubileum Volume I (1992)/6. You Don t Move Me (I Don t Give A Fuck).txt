[Recorded June 1983. 4-track demo, never before released]

Break my heart tear it apart
And spit me in my eye
Confuse my head treat me for dead
And fill me your lies

You don't have to know your lines very well
You don't have to lie the best
Just act at your class just be an ass
A c*nt among the rest

I couldn't care less
You don't move me
If you wanna roll around in shit
Just like the rest

I don't give a damn
I don't even give a f*ck

(You don't move me
I don't give a f*ck
You don't move me
I don't give a f*ck)

One is stronger I've read somewhere
You bet your ass it's true
Make sure to love yourself
'Cause no one will ever love you

You've got to treat yourself
Like the number one just to survive
Or else you'll go a sorry one
While choking on their lies

Take my advice
It's better than their lies
Man's best friend is still a greasy hand

You don't give a f*ck
You don't even give a damn

I don't give a f*ck [x 4]
