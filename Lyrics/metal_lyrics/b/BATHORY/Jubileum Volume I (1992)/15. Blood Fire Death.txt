[Recorded February 1988. Released on album "Blood Fire Death", October 1988]

Death's star on horizon
Lightning and rain
Black winds and thunder
The skyline is in flames

Written in the red mist
The sign of the one
Who rides death's cold wind
And walk disguised among

All you vagrant souls
Of profane disbelieves
False prophets and deceivers
Shall swing from the trees

Soon the dawn shall arise
For all the oppressed to arm
A chariot of thunder shall be seen
And bronze horns shall sound the alarm

Fist will raise like hammers
To a cloudless black sky
Bonds and chains
Fall to the ground

Children of all slaves
Stand united and proud
All people of bondage shall triumph

And live by the sign of...

Blood Fire Death

The moment is chosen
The battlefield is bare
Take now thy stand people
The true ones don't fear

Now choose your weapons
And fall in the line
Choose well your colours
And follow your sign

Blood for all tears shed
And fire for hate
Death for what shall become
All false ones' fate

The standard bearer is chosen
And the day has just begun
Shadows growing long by the rising
Of the awakening sun

Fists raise like hammers
To a clear sunny sky
Bonds and chains fallen to the ground

Children of all slaves
Now united and proud
All people of bondage now triumph

Under the sign of...

Blood Fire Death

Children of all slaves
Unite be proud
Rise out of darkness and pain

A chariot of thunder and gold will come loud
And a warrior of thunder and rain

With hair as white as snow, hammer of steel
To set you free of your chains

And to lead you all where horses run free
And the souls of your ancient ones reign
