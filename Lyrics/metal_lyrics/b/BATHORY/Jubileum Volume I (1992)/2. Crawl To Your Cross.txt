[Recorded June 1989. Never before released]

Born by womb untouched by man
Or a horny mortal man's error
Flower power prophet of one
Spelled dog in the mirror

You hide behind stained glass windows
In fear of real world outside
Kneeling prostitute your souls
To reach his kingdom way up high

And then you castrate your pride in search
Of answers to your prayers
Well they may be reaching the heavens
But they unanswered remain

If so let his anger strike me down
Like lightning from clear sky
For I'm questioning your lord
His almightyness I defy

Sons of bitches whores of Christ
Your f*cking prayers won't do
When it comes closer to deadline
You still don't have no f*cking clue

How one in heaven can sit patiently
And watch the masses starve
On empty stomachs they may go
And to this kingdom it is far

In writtings you read and believe
In seven days the hog
Created light and what the f*ck else
But then who created God

You think the death of one man
Selfproclaimed the son of God a lost
But raise Hell and high water coz I rock and roll
Well, be my guest and crawl to your cross

The bigger cross the better Christian
Says the book of God's commands
But when you reach out you'll find
No one to grab thy f*cking hand

And finally when truth comes clear
About death then what will you do
Y'see there's nowhere left to hide
From the grave waiting for you too

I have the knowledge guts and need
To questioning anything behind
Those pretty promises of heaven
Can't you see that you are blind

Because of one whose words you preach
And fall onto your knees before
Do not exist in fact I doubt
He'll knock your fu*king doors

Sons of bitches whores of Christ
Your prayers never could
What I think faith in yourself and
Sane minds and hard work really could

Because to put all hope in one uphigh
Is sheer insanity
It will show fatal to us all
Yes, even f*cking dangerously

You call yourselves the chosen ones
Because you've "seen" his light and soul
Well I've got news for you I'm stronger
Because I've got rock and roll

You think just coz you pray
Your souls'll be saved at any cost
While I'll burn coz I rock and roll
Well, go one make my day crawl to your cross
