["CHRIST THE BASTARD SON OF HEAVEN]

Creed of eternal life I swore
Held my candle of light into the void
Risen from the dead I death's powers wed
In the name of the one with horns on head
Sleep of eternity withdrawn as dark upon
The life of mine drew the very end so near

The price another life
The gospel of the horned one to spread
Shore to shore eternally his words let hear

Be silent listen to the wind
Crying out the answer to all mankind
Call from other side speech of horned divine
To end your search in hope to find
As sure night divides the day and as sure day divides the night
Raging flames is all that awaits us all on the other side
Doomed the very moment
The calls

Oh, see his star
Ablaze his children
(On the night the flames reach for the sky
Now it's come to enter
The neverending burning flame
Onto you all his word is given)
Fear not reach to take his hand

Hear our master calling us his children
Eternal life is given death withdrawn
As wolves among sheep we have wandered
Victory lies beyond their spite and scorn
Even the heavens shall burn when we are gathered
Now when the flames reach for the sky

Dies Irae
