I summoned up the living dead
and demons in the sky
I drank from chalice warm and red
and watched the virgin die

Present at ungodly births in holy paradise
I spread eternal dark on earth
And raped mother of Christ
Oh, the mother of Christ

C'mon baby
Raise your knife
Welcome darling
To my sacrifice
(Oh, sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice)

Tie the angel to the altar
sacrifice to lord in Hell
Let the warm blood torrent baby
moonlight set the night on spell

I saw the lightning strike in the skies
and heard you roar in pain
I lifted the knife and stroke once more
your blood was mixed with rain

C'mon baby
Raise your knife
Welcome darling
To my sacrifice
(Oh, sacrifice
Sacrifice)

(I summoned up the living dead
And demons in the sky
I drank from chalice warm and red
And watched the virgin die
Oh, die

Present at ungodly births in holy paradise
I spread eternal dark on earth
And raped mother of Christ
Oh, the mother of Christ

C'mon baby
Raise your knife
Welcome darling
To my sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice
Oh, sacrifice)
