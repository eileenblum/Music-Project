[Recorded February 1988. Released on album "Blood Fire Death", October 1988]

Orgy of silence
Conspiracy of peace
Only the master
Of the cold northern breeze

Twinsun sink fading
Behind the black lake
Asleep is the mountains
Yet the night is awake

Strange is the night
Now black stars rise
And many moons circle
Through silent the night

Along the black mountainside
Scattered
By the campfires
Awaiting the dawn

Two times a hundred men
In battles
Tried by the steel in the arrow
Axe and the sword

By battle worn hunger torn awaitening
For the sun to break through the cold haze
And for the banners of Ebal to appear
On the hill in the sun's first warm rays

The elder among the men
Looked deep into
The fire and spoke loud with pride
Tomorrow is a fine day to die

Now the morning advance from far east
Now the sun breaks through dustclouds and haze
Now a forest of spears appears on the hill
And the steel shines bright in the sun's first rays

Die
Die
Die
