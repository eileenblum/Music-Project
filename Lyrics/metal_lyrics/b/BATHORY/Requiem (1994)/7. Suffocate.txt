Kill me!
I am but a fuckin' livin' dead
Help me!
I am goin' outta this damn head

Crazy!
I can't stand the agony and aich
A helpless fuckin' vegetable
I feel I suffocate

Suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate

By and by I tighten the loop
laid around my neck
stretching that damn rope some more
like some damn fuckin' pet

I am like a book
that never will be read
this damn body's outside live
but inside I am dead

Karma!
I don't give a fuck for what will be
I shit upon what will come
when the lights gone out for me

Suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate
Suffocate

I chew my fuckin' limbs
frustration fills all cavitys
living brings me closer
to hardcore insanity

Just one fuckin' step
all'll be fuckin' over and done
I've been taking this one step
since my damn life fuckin' begun

Seeing this whole fuckin' life
like some damn fuckin' trap
I'll be laughin' 'till I hear
that final fuckin' snap
