Now that the virgin bitch
breastfeads death
and the winds smell strong
of the dragons breath

And all the stars fall down
like fuckin' rain of fire
there will be souls for sale
but only one damned buyer

Hey, is this the planet of apes?
Endless chewing on sour grapes
Or the age of eclipse?
The coming of the Apocalypse?

Drugs and pills
there's no oil in Vucovar
when a one night stand kill's
no matter who you are

When the Earth cries loud
but not a damn thing is heard
and a pussy is an asset
in this fuckin' world

When the blood runs down
mother Nature's thighs
and the TV-preacher is caught
while jerking off before Christ

And an audience pay's
just to fuckin' gloat
how the bitch is cut wide open
from her cunt to her throat

Hey, is this the planet of apes?
Endless chewing on sour grapes
Or the age of eclipse?
The coming of the Apocalypse?

Hey, is this the planet of apes?
Endless chewing on sour grapes
Or the age of eclipse?
The coming of the Apocalypse?
