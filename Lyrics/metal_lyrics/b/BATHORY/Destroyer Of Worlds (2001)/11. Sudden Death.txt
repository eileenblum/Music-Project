[1st period]

Shiny ice intensive eyes it's play-off time again
Chew that gum and clutch that stick it's done to one last game
Three times twenty minutes full of blood and sweat and pain
Two teams left to battle and only one cup to claim

Wrestling in the crease score denied the period is coming to an end
Touch our goalie one more time and I swear you'll never rise again

First intermission

[2nd period]

Highstick you right between the eyes you yank me in the face
It's kill or be killed them or us keep up the pace
Your legs all numb you gasp for air and still the game is tied
Get those laced up stinkfeet movin' you're sure you're gonna die

If so far you think this was as close you've been to hell
I suggest you better wait 'til the third period to tell

Second intermission

[3rd period]

Pass you 'long the boards 667 on my back
Better close those pads or I will rearrange your crack
Loose puck in the mid zone and I'm crossing the red line
Shot deflected and it looks like overtime

I'll mish you 'gainst the plexi the end zone will be your grave
Try now to rise you bastard your blood warm on my blades

Third intermission

OT

Hammered to the ice
Defeat is in your eyes
Out of blood and no more breath
This is sudden death
