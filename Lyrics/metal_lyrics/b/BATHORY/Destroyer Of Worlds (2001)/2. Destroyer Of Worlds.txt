A flash like the birth of a sun
A pillar of virgin fire
Now glowing a ruby cloud
The finger of death reaching higher

Radiant dust a chimney rise
Desert floor dissolved wide ablaze
Golden plum against the midnight sky
Burning eyes in death clouds ashgrey face

I have harnessed the stars
Now unleashed upon the earth
I am become death
The Destroyer Of Worlds

Encased in lead and steel
The end and infinity
The eight moon the sixth day the year death
The heatwave to grasp and consume your last breath

Brought high on R marked silver wing
Afar in cold thin morning air
Below as the day begins
The burning eyes in deaths face greedily stares

I have harnessed the stars
Now unleashed upon the earth
I am become death
The Destroyer Of Worlds
