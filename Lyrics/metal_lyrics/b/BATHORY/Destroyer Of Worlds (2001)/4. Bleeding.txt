Blood Blood Blood

Voltures soaring high above me waiting to descend
To sink their claws into my fucking flesh and to rip myself apart
Leeches slimy creatures drain me bone dry and leave me to die
On my knees and sliced to pieces badly beaten cut and bleeding

It's not for you that I'm bleeding
It's not for you that I'm bleeding
It's not for you that I'm bleeding
It's not for you it's not for you that I bleed

Swollen the vein your pleasure my pain
The blade to the skin and the sapping begins
So powerful red and soon I'll be dead
The smell makes you high and blood is life

Bleedin' Bleedin' Bleedin' Bleedin'

Break my fucking bones and squeeze my head you want me dead
Crush my fingers tear my flesh leave me laying waiting for death
Parasiting vermin biting ugly features faceless creatures
Rob me of my very soul and try to push me down your hole

It's not for you that I'm bleeding
It's not for you that I'm bleeding
It's not for you that I'm bleeding
It's not for you it's not for you that I bleed

Swollen the vein your pleasure my pain
The blade to the skin and the sapping begins
So powerful red and soon I'll be dead
The smell makes you high and blood is life

Bleedin' Bleedin' Bleedin' Bleedin'
