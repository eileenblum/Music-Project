Youngsters prostitute themselves
It's all part of the game
Walking up and down the pavements
That bears both stars and names

Automatic fire
Sacred amendment guarantees
To kill or be killed is your own business
So fire as you please

Liberty &amp; Justice

Crack the substitute for new highs
The hooker and the gunman
Barely more than a fucking child

And up the fucking hills
Silicon mummies by their pools
Sips their fucking drinks
And smile over their preserved youths

Liberty &amp; Justice

I pledge allegiance in God we trust
Down the hood and up Wall Street
From the church and trough the school rooms
The deceive is but complete

Mr. Smith and family sits still
And pray over their fucking apple pie
And down the ghetto the law enforcement
Accidentally guns down another child

Liberty &amp; Justice
