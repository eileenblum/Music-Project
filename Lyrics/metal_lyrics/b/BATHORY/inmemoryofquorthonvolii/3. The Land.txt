This land is mine to the end of time
none it shall claim or conquer
the mountains high : the endless sky
the forests and the sea

Oh land rejoice : your son has sailed
beyond the seas : adventurous trail
now heading north : to Asa Bay
my place of birth : home of the brave

A man he may wither away
or die in battle with sword in hand
but the river will flow and the wind will blow
forever across my northern land

This land is mine to the end of time
none it shall claim or conquer
the mountains high : the endless sky
the forests and the sea

Oh fatherland : oh Northstar high
two hundred days and night have I
been away from you my hearts most dear
returning home : great wealth to share

Work those oars : the wind is still
no southern breeze our sail to fill
the dusk is here and our bay is far
the Dragon soon to sweep the night
so work these oars an Sorsemen : brother's row

The land where deep in heavyturf the bones and crushed skulls testify
the violent times and troubled days when land was claimed
and paid for in blood and human lives

The land where gold of star will glow in silvery water
and on black wings high the ravens soar above
the glade where as child I was baptised in fire and ice
