The bells of war doth chime tonight
and the heavens shake with fear
The earth commot the sky is in flames
the battle is ever near

(Troops of Hell tonight they storm
The walls they so despise
Heaven's gates are closing in
The night is filled with cries)

WAR, WAR, WAR

A crack of thunder, a smell of death
the wind of mayhem blows
Heaven in its final breath
and God lose all control

Prayers for mercy cries for help
won't stop the blasphemy
Our troops emerge the sacred throne
and the victory is complete

WAR, WAR, WAR

(WAR, WAR, WAR)
