The damned earth commot under starspangled sky
As the sound of destruction increase
Tongues of red fire snatch black clouds above and unite with the cold Northern
breeze
A massive veil of flames raise high over the mountains and burning clouds fill
up the sky
Along vast hills liquid fire brim over
Tonight Hell's jaws open wide

Over the skyline
Approaching at high speed
Objects of flames reaching higher
Crossing the sky at Hell's pace comes a thousand Chariots of Fire......

Chariots of fire emerge
Spreading pure hell on earth as they pass over water and land
All living to ashes turn
All creatures alive they burn
They die as they lay and stand
Vast hills on fire
Thick smoke dark sight
Ashes and death everywhere
Covered with ashes the bleak world lies dead as the chariots emerge the
poisoned air

Over the skyline
Approaching at high speed
Objects of flames reaching higher
Crossing the sky at Hell's pace comes a thousand Chariots of Fire......

[Repeat first verse]

[Repeat Chorus]
