Ride the Dragon's breath, mist of poison green
Come yee flemes, a burning death, face the unseen
Deep within the cave, lit p by the torch, a plae gleam
As told of in the ancient tales, the Sword of gold and steel

Eyes of ember, fangs and claws
Creature of fire
Jaws of death, walk through the haze
Crimson and dire

Engulfed in mist, the Sword of Gods
Onwards son and ride the Dragon's breath

Struch from mountain are, chilled in morning dew
Forged by hand of Gods, when the world was young, this land anew
Blade of shining steel, grip covered in gold
Carved into its blade, the legend unfold

Eyes of ember, fangs and claws
Creature of fire
Jaws of death, walk through the haze
Crimson and dire

Gods in the shy, the Sword is mine
Untouched I am by the mist of the Dragon's breath
