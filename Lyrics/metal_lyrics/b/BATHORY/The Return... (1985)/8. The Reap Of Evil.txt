(Time for peace, time for war
Time for life and death
Time for (me?), time to (saw???))

Hear the calls for your blood and flesh
Bells tolls it's time for your last breath
Writhe your body death is cold
Jaws claws sink their talons deep into your soul

The Wind squall through the vale of tears
Bring the smell of decayed flesh
Infernal lightning strikes the sky
Burn the bodies and poison your last breath

Hells wrath spawn this night of judgement
Flames of evil snatch the skies
From pits of pure damnation
Satan rise...

For all of you the bells toll...
Take heed...
THE REAP OF EVIL...
