A sorcery written in blood
Whispered by a Witch in the dawn
Summon the darkness pure evil and death
And gather the legions of scorn

The darkness possesses you your soul scream in vain
Tonight the Hellfire shall burn
Thunder and lightning the ancient prediction
The bells chime for Satan's Return...

(Blasphemy
Sorcery)

It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame
It's the RETURN of my master Satan
It's the RETURN of desire and pain

Sacrifice a virgin to the flames of burning Hell
Black Witch of beauty recite the words of spell
Gather masses run in circles scream for mercy cry of pain
No mercy for the blessed in Hell you all will burn in lord Satan's name

Now descend from the burning blasting sky
Holding the reigns ride the night
Satan appear in full glory and pride
The raped souls of Heaven cries

Blasphemy
Victory
Desecration
Hell and damnation

It's the RETURN of the darkness and evil
It's the RETURN of the fire and flame
It's the RETURN of my master Satan
It's the RETURN of desire and pain

All music and lyrics by Quorthon.

"When the sacred oath is broken
and the lie is spoken out loud
when the angel is POSSESSED
and the virgin is stolen her pride

When the flame of love and pureness
have turned to BESTIAL LUST
when the walls of gold in heaven
close in and turn to dust

When THE WIND OF MAYHEM whispers
through the vale of tears and death
when the gold river is empty
and the SADIST tear the angels flesh

When the SON OF THE DAMNED strides the earth
and THE RITE OF DARKNESS is done
when the REVELATION OF DOOM comes closer
and the battle just begun

When the beauty is BORN FOR BURNING
and the TOTAL DESTRUCTION draws near
when the disciples under the sign of the black mark gathers
and the REAP OF EVIL is here

Then the clouds of death shall gather
then the night shall always burn
then the ancient prediction comes true
and the bells of fate chaime
THE RETURN..."
