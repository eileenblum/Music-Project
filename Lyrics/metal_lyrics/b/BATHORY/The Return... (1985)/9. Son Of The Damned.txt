I was born in the light of a fullmoon
And baptised in the sacred blood of an angel
Raped the holy deity and slayed a new born child
I ride the wings of darkness and evil

I am the SON OF THE DAMNED and the wild

I lacerate your body I slit and tear your flesh
I got you in my vicious circle and poison your last breath
I make the damned earth quiver I make the heaven burn
I live in sin and lust and await lord Satan's Return...

In the blackened sky of twilight the Wind of Mayhem blow
Infernal lightning the sound of thunder roll
Endless nights on fire the Holocaust is near
Mist surround your destiny and the mortals runs with fear
