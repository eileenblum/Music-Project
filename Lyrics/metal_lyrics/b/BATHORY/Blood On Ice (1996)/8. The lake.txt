The one eyed old man told me that the face that I will see
Has paralysed a thousand brave men sure of victory
I cannot fight blindfolded and I'd freeze if I should see.
So I need to sacrifice my eyes to see all from within.

The one eyed old man told me of a lake that no-one knows of.
where the end of the sky unites with the bottom countless feet down deep
And he told me when this world was young into it's depths his eye he had thrown
So that though one eyed, he could see more than can be seen.

I'll throw my eyes into the lake.
So that I will see from within
I'll throw my eyes into the lake
And when blind I will still see.

At the bottom of the lake.
My two eyes will shine like the stars
At the bottom of the lake
I will see no matter how near or far
Regardless at which speed my horse
takes me through the night
No matter how sharp the blade of my sword seems to be.
Even with the aid of two pair of eyes way up high
In the end before the Beast, it's face I would have had to see.

But with my two eyes in the depths my vision is supreme
I see all things that can't be seen
but not my hand that is held out in front of me.
The face that makes me freeze
I now need not see at all.
I'll feel the presence of the Beast.
but will not need stare him down no more.

I've thrown my eyes into the lake.
So that I will see from within
I've throw my eyes into the lake
And now when blind I still see.

At the bottom of the lake.
My two eyes are shining like the stars
At the bottom of the lake
I now see no matter how near or far

[The Highlands...]
[Early morning hours...]
["Heading north. Sitting upon his majestic eight-legged white stallion. His]
[sword slung on his back. Sensing his feathered friends way up high. Seeing]
[all they see. Feeling all they feel. Though the sun has just cut the]
[horizon in the east to bring a new day, the shadows now seem to grow]
[mightier for each passage in these mountains. Riding into a thick mist, his]
[senses alert. Distorted voices in the shadows whispering to him. Taunting]
[him. He knows his mission. He knows the powers and the magic he birngs with]
[him as he rides trough the valley of death, where time and space have]
[ceased to exist. The eyes of the unseen are upon him. The spirits of his]
[fathers long time gone riding next to him.]
[And the hearts of the Gods of Thunder of Wind and of Rain..."]
