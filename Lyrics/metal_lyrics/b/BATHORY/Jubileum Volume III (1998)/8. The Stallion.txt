"Tendons and muscles of steel.
And the blaze of lightning in its eyes.
White as the snow on the hills.
And its reins, that I hold, they are mine.

This stallion and sword in exchange
For my heart and both of my eyes.
The ravens of swift wings my sight.
Surely now victory must be mine.

Eight legged stallion of mine.
Run with the speed of the winds..
Eight legged stallion I stride.
Run as if you carried wings.

I paint thee with blood from my veins.
Images of origin long lost.
I adorn your white mane and tail.
With the stars that fell from the sky."
