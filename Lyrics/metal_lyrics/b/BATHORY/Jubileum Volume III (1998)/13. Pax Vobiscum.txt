Holy Jesus, fuckin' Christ
Forgive my fuckin' head
It's full of doubts and questions
Did you really raise the dead?

Are you really so pathetic
That you can't be critisised?
Is it so hard to accept
That I may wonder why?

Out of nothing, born by no one
Wonders you create
Almighty fuckin' God
You super bluff, you mega-fake

They say you've said for you only
We all shall live and die
Tell me who needs Stalin
With a fascist in the sky?

Conquering the western hemisphere
With threats and lies
Spreading its holy terror
As another culture dies

It baptised and it burned and tortured
Its way through my land
And wielded above all
The crucifix by God's command

Pax Vobiscum
Pax Vobiscum
Pax Vobiscum
Pax Vobiscum

Imposing on the tribes of Europe
One faith built on lies and dreams
One religion so false
Always loose at every seam

Through wars and emigration
Soon a world faith took its form
As world saviour and almighty
The cross all world adorned

Computerised confessions
TV-preachers and very soon
The Christian man stood firm
And in '69 prayed on the moon
