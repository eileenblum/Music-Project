Ink the pen with blood
Now sign your destiny to me

Now in my hands your fate is given
My claim thee to join me
In death when the life you're living
Near the end is coming and to
Enter my realms come and grab my hand

Sign my claim with the blood of your veins
And my obligation will for as long
Thee live be to forfill thy obsecrations
A life full of success and riches
Now your wish is my command but
As soon as life is coming to its end
See me wave you on to grab my hand

I ink the pen with blood
Now I sign my destiny to thee

Now in my hands my fate
On to thee my soul is given
My soul will join thee
In death when the life I am living
Near the end is coming and to
Enter your realms to reach for thy hand

Signed is your claim with blood of mine
And thy obligation
The life of mine glows be to forfill my obsecration
A life full of success and riches
Now my wish is your command
And as soon as life is coming to its end
See me reach out to grab thy hand

Into my realms...
Now I see the light The light

Now in my kingdom comed the claim
Of bond of blood commend thee
Master I thee call heed here
I am now take my soul
Now the dawn of the age of flames begins
Enter the jaws of my hellhole

Sacred flames embrace me
And consume my lustful soul
Take the step into infinity
And recieve eternal bliss
Now I burn a child of sin
Among souls burning in this hole
Slaves all to the bond of blood
