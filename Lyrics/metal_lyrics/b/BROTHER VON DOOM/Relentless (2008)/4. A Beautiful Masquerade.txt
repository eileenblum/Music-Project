You will not make it out alive
When you feign a memory
Just you wait and see
When every bridge is burned

And when you burned every bridge
You will lie there crying
On your bathroom floor cold and alone

The only memory of you is this
Serrated blade you left twisted
In my back left me for dead

I never saw this coming
But now I'm lost for words loss of life

And my mind is plaqued
With the thought that one
Day you'll come to your senses

And that we can be
So beautiful again and nothing else

So for now I'll watch this mascarade
With a sadistic sense of joy

So for now I'll watch this mascarade
With a sadistic sense of joy

And that we can be
So beautiful again and nothing else

The only memory of you is this
Serrated blade you left twisted
In my back left me for dead

I never saw this coming
But now I'm lost for words loss of life

Tore out my heart
Leave me for dead
No need to take yours
Your already dead inside

I'd tear out your heart
But it's obvious
There's nothing there
Your already dead inside

Tore out my heart
Leave me for dead
No need to take yours
Your already dead

You've burned every bridge
But to me your already dead inside

You'll stand all alone
But to me your already dead inside

You've burned every bridge
But to me your already dead.
