The fear will fill the eyes of our
Enemies as we charge fourth with vengeance
Waging war on the vile
We will rise together
Our enemies will watch the horror

As their souls escape their battered corpses
Death will repem your sins forever
My hand will be your death as you
Fall to your knees

And the light escapes your eyes
This is the never ending
Suffering you brought on

Blood will fill your last breath
As you cling to life
I will watch you slip away
This day is over

My revenge will be your demise
My hand will choke your throat
When the day turns black
We will ride off into the night

Hands raised high
And on this night
We spill the blood
Of the betrayer

When you're at the throne of judgment
He who shall not be judged
Will be sentenced to persecution
And fall at the feet of ones
You once loved

You're at the throne of judgment
As their souls escape their battered corpses
Death will repem your sins forever
My hand will be your death as you
Fall to your knees.
