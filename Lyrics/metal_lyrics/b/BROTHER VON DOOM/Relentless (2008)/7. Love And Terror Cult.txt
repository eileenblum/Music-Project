Oh I never said this was all to be for nothing
Now I think you are putting words in my mouth
But it's all to familiar

Isn't it sweetheart if I may speak so freely
I'm only going to say this half of million
All eyes and ears to front please

This part you've taken away
I hope time heals whats missing
It's not gaping its just an affliction
Wasn't very subtle

I supposed walked right into that one
I hope you feel weightless
Because it feels like a ton of bricks
Crashing down on my chest

As long as you're happy being miserable
I'll watch spill your guts
You told me the heart was in the middle
Slightly to the left
You sure your anatomy

Now I think you are putting words in my mouth
But it's all to familiar

Isn't it sweetheart if I may speak so freely
I'm only going to say this half of million
All eyes and ears to front please
This is only an affliction.
