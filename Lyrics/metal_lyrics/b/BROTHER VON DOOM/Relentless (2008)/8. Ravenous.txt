We're riding out
To victory with vengeance in our sites
Our steel thirsts for the taste of evil's blood
Carving the eyes of cursed souls
Their doomed hand attempt to cling to life

Their bones are forever bound
Within the clutches of the damned
Praying for the sweet release of death
Pummeled by the hammers light

And from the bowels from which they came
They shall return incased in flames
Incased in flames of their godless fiend

Mountains of corpses deserving to rise
Mountains of traitors deserving to die

Spewing the ashes from their mouths
Breathing the fire from my lungs
Snatching the life from their hands
Leaving nothing but an empty shell

The rotting smell of the doom
Staggering in the air
Falling angels turn to beasts
Destroy the most purest beings
How we long to destroy them all
Leaving nothing left of the plaques and vile memories

As a blood red moon fills the sky
The cold kiss of steel is the taste of their demise
Smashing the faces of the beast
Severe the heads of the snakes
We'll leave a trail of dead in our wake

Kingdoms of heroes together shall rise
Vile destroyers with malice shall die
Kingdoms of heroes together shall rise
Vile destroyers with malice shall die

As overfiends glare the darkest stares
We shall ride on leave them to rest
Choking on frantic flame forever consumed

By my own hand we will steal their every breath
Weaken the vile beast
Severing the throats of infernal armies

Vile destroyers with malice shall die.
