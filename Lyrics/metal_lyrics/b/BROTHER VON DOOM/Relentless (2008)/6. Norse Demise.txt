This land is cursed Barron and death
The winds of plague have swept away

The purest of souls to suffer in this blackened waste
The purest of souls to suffer in this blackened waste

They've taken everything
Left nothing but decay
Fight four our homes
Fight for this land once ours
Rise from the slumber of ages
Rewaken this crusade of vengeance

The flames of revenge carry us on
The flames of revenge carry us on

Awake the souls of all who could not stand before
As they fight this infernal tyranny

We hail this battle with deafening cries
But it is our blades that speak
The just we desire the justice desired

The purest of souls to suffer in this blackened waste
The purest of souls to suffer in this blackened waste

All hail the dead for they did not die in vein
All hail the dead for they did not die in vein

All hail the dead for they did not die in vein
Tired and weak we must continue
Tired and weak we must continue
We will not rest until the throne is reclaimed

Thousands now join
Our quest is laid before us
Thousands now join

The flames of revenge carry on
The flames of revenge carry on.
