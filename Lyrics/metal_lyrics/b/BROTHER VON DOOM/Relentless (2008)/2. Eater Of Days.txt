The smell of death surrounds me
The light of day is swallowed whole

Their horrid screams their shrieks of madness
As I decend through these piles of bones

I hear the beast, now you
Will suffer and you will beg to die

Echoes of the damned destroy my head
They thirst to drain my blood

Eternal pain the struggle
To stay alive eternal pain I want to die

Commanded by the lord of the dead
And as I continue up this path

I'm greeted by the lord of the pit
Three headed monstrosity he spoke in demons toungesas
Fire spewed from his eyes

His master the keeper of the dead
But with hellbrand by my side

The lord of the damned will feel the bite
NOW
The lord of the damned will feel my wrath

The smell of death surrounds me
The light of day is swallowed whole

Their horrid screams their shrieks of madness
As I decend through these piles of bones

I hear the beast
Now you will suffer and you will beg to die

Echoes of the dead destroy my head
They thirst to drain my blood

The eater of days.
