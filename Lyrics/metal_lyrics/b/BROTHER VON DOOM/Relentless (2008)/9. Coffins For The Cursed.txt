Shred the terror I have nothing left to fear
Scatter remains of all appalling fiends
Leave them to choke on the blood
That they so carelessly spilled in vein

And its coffins for the cursed
Bury them all alive
Ride the earth of the plague
Of the unhallowed undead

And we shall hunt with each battle cry
Melting their eyes sendinf them to their graves
Silence their blasphemy and their filthy lies
Sever their callous tongues for it's their demise

Cast back into the shadows and flames
Breath in the ashes of your pain

And we wathc the ground swallow up the swine
Leaving nothing but bones sinew and the smell of rotting flesh
And they shall never kiss these golden skies
For they will choke on the fires that arise

Cursed by the vile undead your life has come to an end
Cursed by the vile undead your life has come to an end
Cursed by the vile undead your life has come to an end

And at the end bodies will burn for they believed
And at the end bodies will burn for they believed

Cursed by everything you know long live your life of agony
Cursed by everything you know long live your life of agony
Cursed by everything you know long live your life of agony.
