The rapture the culmination of dreams
Barraged by nefarious schemes
We shall spill their blood in effigy

Vanquish the night with the blood of the fiends
Trying to severe the ties between you and me

And with a judas kiss your fate is entombed
Forever laid to rest

And we are a thousand battles strong
We are led to victory against these vile souls
They will burn in effigy

Vanquish the night with the blood of the fiends
Trying to severe the ties between you and me

It's a mark, a scar, a murder
This is utter blasphemy

Lies upon lies upon lies upon
Smoke and mirrors
Upon lies upon lies upon

It's a mark, a scar, a murder
(Blasphemy)
A mark, a scar, a murder
It's a mark, a scar, a murder
(Blasphemy)
A mark, a scar, a murder

The rapture the culmination of dreams
Barraged by nefarious schemes
We shall spill their blood in effigy

And a thousand battles strong
We are led to victory against these vile souls
They will burn in effigy

There is not not one day
They don't fight for your souls.
