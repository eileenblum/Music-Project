We are the canal desire
The weakness of the damned
A triumph that blows in your ear

The reason for your rotten steps
A lasting shadow that attacks
A punch in the face

We are a life in the end
The hand of a murderer
The wish for revenge
The fragility of the "innocent"
We are a life in the end
The hand of a murderer

We are the punishment, the death
Your reality, your nightmare
We came to take life
To exalt your fears
We came to take life
To exalt your fears

We are the suicide the pain
The suffering of the victim
The deadly cut in your wrist
The praise of the life's end
The deadly cut in your wrist
The praise of the life's end

We are a life in the end
The hand of a murderer
The wish for revenge
The fragility of the "innocent"
We are a life in the end
The hand of a murderer
