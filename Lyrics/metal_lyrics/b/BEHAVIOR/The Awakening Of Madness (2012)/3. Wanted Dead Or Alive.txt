In the rottenness born a worm
Feeded with evil hate
Voracious animal
He wonât stop âtil kill them all
When the bullets are the law
World is infested of misery
Thousand vultures fly low
For a upcoming meal
I was born in a violent place
Where the sun doesnât reach
Learn to survive and kill
He knows about fear

When the night falls on day
The hunter watches in the dark
He feels the smell of despair
To satisfy your cruel thirst

The razor runs slowly on flesh
To rape and the torture of the soul

The symphony of the screams the art
Of blood and guts stained with the
Blood of dead no emotion in
Your eyes following your unholy way

Wanted dead or alive

On the blade of knife
On the shine of a bullet
On the blade of a knife
Is time to kill
Time to kill
To kill
