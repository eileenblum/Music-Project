I was sleeping and i woke up
I found myself in a strange land
And when I began to understand it
Came time to sleep again

Saints, angels and holy spirits
Weakness that impair the man
Your true essence now is destroyed
All thatâs left is rotting dead

He calls for your drugs in you prayers
He calls the heart of divine

Wander in desert search in the truth
The emptiness of life he confront
Mirages that movering over the hot sand
Guide to a labyrinth of madness
We see think that do not
Want to see terror
Of a painful days and a wakeful madness
That ravaging at night, make in time, moving backwards

Lunatic, what he says makes no sense
Preacher, living in unreal world

The evil seeds grow in the heart of mankind
The mooring that holds the silence in our soul
Images succumb about our vision vile
Thousand ways for those to nowhere

Lunatic, what he says makes no sense
Preacher, living in unreal world

Saints, angels and holy spirits
Weakness that impair the man
Your true essence now is destroyed
All thatâs left is rotting dead
