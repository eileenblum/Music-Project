I feel much pain the pain
The pain of the world
I know you feel pain
And bring the other's ones

People come and go
Bringing taking their pain
Physical, mental spiritual
You will turn to whom?

Can you measure your pain?
Good or evil embraces you?
You will turn to whom?
You have to deicide now, now, now

Pain â [5x]

The eyes approach
The time gets short
The blood rotten
And the pain is still alive

People make mistakes
And suffer handle and worship
Forgetting the poison
That your body needs

Can you measure your pain?
Good or evil embraces you?
You will turn to whom?
You have to deicide now

Don't make the wrong decision
A mistake would be your end
Be right and decided
There will be no return
There will be no return
