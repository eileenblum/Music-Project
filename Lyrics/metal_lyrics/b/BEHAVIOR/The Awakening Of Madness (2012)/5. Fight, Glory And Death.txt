Look around you, they try to kill you, the must kill you
Look around you, they try to kill you, fight, glory and death

Awaiting for a great return
We fight to unveil mysteries
Every fight has its end
That liar, burning, glorious
The capacity makes us strong
The wisdom step to the conquer
The rebellion is your learning
And the end shows despair

[2x]
Fight, glory and death
Look around you
They try to kill you

Expect no mercy
Life is your only triumph
The death you only certainty
And the pain your only company

They thrown our dreams in the trash
We know there Will be conquering

Fight, glory and death â [5x]

We fight with hatred in our eyes, ready to attack and kill
One Knife on your brains, says that your glory ends
We fight with hatred in our eyes, ready to attack and kill

Survive to the call of death
Wake up from a nightmare
One Knife on your brains
Says that your glory ends
Donât forget the enemy
Betrayal always will be your
Footsteps watched
âTills no way out to seek
