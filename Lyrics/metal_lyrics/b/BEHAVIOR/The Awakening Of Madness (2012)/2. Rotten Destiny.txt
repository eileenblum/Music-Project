The feeling raises desire
Destroying the dreams
I see the fire in your eyes
Death coming to you

When you tried to fight
Did you really try?
Did you really try?
Do you deserve respect?

Rotten destiny
Weâre walking to the bottom
Without looking down
Drowning everyday

When you tried to fight
Did you really try?
Do you deserve respect?
I think thatâs all lies

You canât breath
Your freedom was hanged
The guilty is always you
And you never questions
Your way is traced
When you beg for mercy

I donât see you fight
And no one screaming
The world collapses
As you cum in a bitch
Your attitude fascinates me
Your tears make me strong
As you sleep
The world chokes awake

Sick mind
The future is an illusion
Donât look back
The truth is cruel

Rotten destiny
Weâre walking to the bottom
Without looking down
Drowning everyday
