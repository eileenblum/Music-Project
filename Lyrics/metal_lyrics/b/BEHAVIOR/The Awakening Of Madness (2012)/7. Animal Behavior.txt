I feel the smell of rotten flesh
The soft scent of a breath
In your eyes, a weakness
The sick desire of death
In your eyes
A weakness the sick
Desire of death

I see you trying to kill
I see you trying to destroy
A natural behavior
To kill, stack eliminate

I feel the fear in your empty words
The fear of failing and losing
The certainty of death by blood

Only death is real
You kill and pray
Fail and beg forgiveness
Animal behavior

I see you managed to build
New walls of dead bodies
A book of faded dogmas
A world full o vile...animals

I see you trying to kill
I see you trying to destroy
A natural behavior
To kill, stack eliminate

Animal behavior â [4x]
