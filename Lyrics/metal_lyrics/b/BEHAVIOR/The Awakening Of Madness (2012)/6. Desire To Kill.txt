I feel the pain in my bones
Predicting the ending and the extermination
I feel the blood in my eyes
The Will to kill to kill and escape, and escape

Itâs not enough only to live
Because suffering is a pleasure
Hate is the only expression
My desire is Just for death

My body freezes my hands shake
I want your head rotten on a tray
My body freezes my hands shake
I want your head rotten on a tray

I feel the will to kill
Death desire, Death desire
Death desire, Death desire
I feel Will to kill, Death desire

Your breath suffocates me
Nothing will make you win
Donât know where you comefrom
Neither where you are going

I feel the pain in my bones
Predicting the ending and the extermination
I feel the blood in my eyes
The Will to kill to kill and escape, and escape

Donât feel cold in the winter
Nor Love in my heart
Donât feel cold in the winter
Nor Love in my heart
Donât feel hot in hell
Nor fear of the life

Only desire to kill
Only desire to kill
