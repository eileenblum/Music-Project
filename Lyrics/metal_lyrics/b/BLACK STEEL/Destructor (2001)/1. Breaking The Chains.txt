Bite the hand that feeds me, break the power which enslaves
Ignite the fires of destiny and strengthen freedom's reign
Defy the executioner, usurp the overlords
Breaking loose and running wild; I'm gonna take it all

[Pre-chorus:]
TAKE - take control
LET - let it loose

Breaking the chains
Breaking the chains
Breaking the chains
Breaking the chains - I will burst from this hell

Rip away the nails that crucify me to this pain
Expel the evil poison from my veins
Kick the dirt that buries me inside this living hell
Break the Chains I'm bursting from my cell

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Chorus x2]
