We walk alone, harder than stone
Outcast lean hungry machines
Create the will mind set to kill
Empower our spirit to fight

[Pre-chorus:]
We are masters of our destiny
Embodied raw power set free
We are the strong fight to carry on
Baptised in fire eternal desire
We must believe.. We must believe..
Our time will come again

[Chorus:]
We're all the same too wild to tame
We stand together now and forever
A burning flame too wild to tame
We are together now and forever

We see the signs, it's our time to shine
Exploding with fury we rise
We walk the line this is our time
Banish all fear from our minds

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
