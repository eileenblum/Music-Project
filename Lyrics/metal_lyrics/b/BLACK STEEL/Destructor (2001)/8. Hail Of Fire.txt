Try us in a court of fire
Dig your claws into our heart
Throw us to the starving wolves
Tear us apart
Face us up against the wind
Make us pay forgotten sins
Lies and broken promises burning within

[Chorus:]
Standing in a hail of fire
They'll never take our soul
Standing in a hail of fire
We'll take control

Torture us with burning iron
Run our bodies through with steel
Tear our flesh all from our bones
Nail us to the wheel
Chain us to eternal pain
We'll not spend our life in vain
Glory is for evermore, vindicate the slain

[Chorus]
[Repeat 1st verse]
[Chorus x2]
