We see his lethal power shattering the night
Come many light years to our skies
This cyborg predator unleashed on all mankind
Programmed for destruction eliminate all life
Is there somewhere to run a place where we can hide
Cling to survival taking flight

[Pre-chorus:]
Power of the Gods
Defender of the lost
We see his lethal power shattering the night
Come many light years to our skies

[Chorus:]
Destructor - faster than light he will fly
With fury he'll tear up the night
Pounding the world with his might
Destructor, Destructor.

We must do battle with this cold killing machine
Somehow we know we must survive
We will command our human forces to attack
From now on no turning back
Gather battalions in the skies &amp; on the ground
The fight for our future is right now

[Pre-chorus:]
We must do battle with this cold killing machine
Somehow we know we must survive

[Chorus]

Power of the gods
Defender of the lost

We must do battle with this cold killing machine
Somehow we know we must survive

[Chorus]
