You feel the power in your heart &amp; soul
You've got the fire in your eyes
No-one can fill you with their foolish lies
Onward to victory you will go

[Pre-chorus:]
Is there a patron saint for my steel quest
To keep me from falling into the abyss
Eternal fires of destiny burn
True victory we'll learn

[Chorus:]
Endless battles we will fight as one
To glory we will ride
United see us fight the holy war
Our standards they will rise up

Don't let them rule you with their prophecies
They deal in fear for their control
Stand tall &amp; fight for what you know is true
Conquer injustice with your heart

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus x2]

[Chorus x2]
