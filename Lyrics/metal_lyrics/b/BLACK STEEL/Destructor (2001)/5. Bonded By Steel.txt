Searching for light when all else is black
Cut through the ice in which you freeze
Looking for soul when life feels cold
So much inside you must believe

[Pre-chorus:]
Metal forces raise your voices will to carry on
Metal forces raise your voices will to carry on

[Chorus x 1/2:]
Chained to the heart we are never apart
Brave to the last one and all

Where will it end to this prison we are sent
Go forth and fly into the night
Life can be tough and you've taken enough
So go on and fight - fight for your life

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus:]
Chained to the heart
We are never apart
Brave to the last one and all
Bonded by steel we are in for the kill
Fight to the last one and all

We stand on top of the world
A force in space and time
We take out place in line
There is no good reason
For why we don't belong
Ship of fools

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
