Standing at the gates of hell no sanctuary below
The final date with destiny awaits the mortal blow
Iron men of flesh and blood all those about to die
We crush our fear don't hesitate we look death in the eye

[Chorus:]
When all is lost we fight to win
Always strong the might within

Disciples will desert you and more fools will come and go
The light is gone off can't you see
Demons would destroy them and the fools would never know
When night is gone and you know you're free
What you see is what you get oh
What you see is what you get yeah
What you see is what you get oh
What you see is what you get yeah

Glorious in victory in death we stand as one
Against all odds we reign in blood survivors on the run
Damnation of our souls the curse we dare not reason why
They punish us against our sins condemned about to die

[Chorus]
