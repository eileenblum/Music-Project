I shout but no-one can hear me
I feel only pain in my heart
I love but my love lies bleeding
Burning inside every day we're apart

[Pre-chorus:]
We walk the highest mountains
We blaze across the sky

[Chorus:]
Time, time marches on
Strangers to love, tear us apart
Facing adversity, where will we be
Where will we go, time marches on

By your eyes I am blessed as I'm kneeling
Swept away like a light in the black
By your life I am flamed but not healing
Swept away when there's no turning back

We sail the seas of thunder
To cross the great divide

[Chorus:]
Time, time marches on
Strangers to love, tear us apart
Facing uncertainty, where will we be
Where will we go, time marches on

Facing uncertainty
