We start our journey on the wings of a storm
Now were relearning what we've always known
Echoes of the past, strengthening our task
Those who stand before us come undone
Open up the knight, we're ready for the fight
We have the power - We are one.

[Solo - Jamie]

Echoes of the past, strengthening our task
Those who stand before us come undone
Open up the night, we're ready for the fight
We have the power - We are one
