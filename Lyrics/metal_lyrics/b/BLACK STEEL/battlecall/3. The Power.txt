We shall destroy this land
And oppose the rule of law
It is our master plan
To drive the false ones from our shore

[Pre Chorus:]
Feel the power - Heavy Metal
Join as one the battle has begun
Live the power - Heavy Metal
We'll fly blazing through the sky

We'll fight until the end
Victory is our destiny
Ruling through eternity

[Pre Chorus]
[Chorus x2]
[Solo - Jamie]
[Chorus]

Feel the power - Heavy metal
Join as one the battle has begun
Live the power - heavy Metal
Well fly...
Heavy Metal!
