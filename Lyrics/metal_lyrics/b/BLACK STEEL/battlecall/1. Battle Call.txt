Like a shattered knight I walk this barren land
Waiting for the metal fall
Destiny will take us where we want to go
Do you here the battle call

[Chorus:]
I feel like I fall of the edge of the world
Wings of the stars are our banner unfurled
Fight for you life till the battle is won
Believe in your heart that the kingdom has come

Fools they wonder why we walk this hallowed ground
And defend it with our lives
Would you be a warrior fierce, strong &amp; proud
Or do you sit alone &amp; cry

[Chorus]
[Solo - Jamie]
[Solo - Andy]

Like a shattered knight I walk this barren land
Waiting for the metal call
Would you be a warrior fierce &amp; strong &amp; proud
Do you here the battle call

[Chorus x2]
