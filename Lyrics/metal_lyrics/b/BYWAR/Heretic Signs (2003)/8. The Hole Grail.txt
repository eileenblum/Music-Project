Three missions around the chosen one
The breath, the word and the faith
Just with your persistence you gonna pass
The way of the hill is closing near

Christian people killing to protect it
Giving their lives to posses
The cross on their chest, the sign of God
Maybe they were the ones

Angels of death passing like fire
Showing the persistence signs
Taking from your last passage
Saying that no one can save it

Recover is the wish, but wish is for what?
There's nothing that lord have not done
Just holding in hands? The way to meet God?
Posses the grail it's a wish in vain
