You close your eyes and you're so far away
Walking and scared with this new place
Tying to remember what war happened
The final line! You are! And rise the question

In endless line?
You're dead or alive
Confused mind
Hear choirs of souls
They're driving you mad
You cannot die twice in this hell

Hear now! Feel the strike
Of your last life
Human demise
Someone! Froze your soul
You got no choice
Have no rebirth

All your life you seek the death in vein
Understanding the guilty of your way
The rope in your neck with life again
And this piece of hell you gonna stay!!!
