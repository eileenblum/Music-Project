Restore your life and relax in your bed
Think! In your day and senses
Reduce all your endless thoughts

Conclusion of pain! Pain of heart
Death no!!! Sadness!!! That's strange
This fucking life, my inner self wants live

Simple glance, a movie in your brain
Vicious mind, bath in blood
Inner rot... Explode in a scream
Run and don't look behind!!! The cruel fate

Now it's time I see a smashed face
Deformed, in darkness all proclaim
No one! Save their rotting mind

The time goes on... It seems bought life
I feel... Included the real pain
But now... Isn't time to open my eyes
