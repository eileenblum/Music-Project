I was in places that I've never saw before
Hidden among these walls
Talking with the wind around
I kissed someone that I've never met in life
I've never dreamed or thought
Know this place so cold and frightening

I felt there was some in my body
I don't know but was so good
I was totally out of dimension
In this place so cold of intention
Suddenly everything disappeared
Silence aways live at my side
Felt a strongest void too deep
I heard the death so close to me

Lost in this world
See some things and it's so strange
Far, I hear a choir, pure and beauty clear my mind
World shuts in V and feel my senses alive
Maybe can be right the end of my empty life
