Future reserve us a blind horror's trap
We're feeling the smell of death
The guillotine will cut our heads

Science and Church united their stand
Possessed by evil want
Resurrection of the icon one. No...

Evil tests
Can raise the dead
Who can be the next?
Maybe your endless breath

They want a new kind of Christ
Science and Church gonna smile
The twin of God without sins
Madness guiding monstrosity

Prophecies foresee a new Antichrist
This icon can be a lie
Or perhaps now it's time

And the child will born and soon will roam
Masked and helpful will lie
On his head 666

Bow to him
Don't know what is
But soon you'll see
And finally the world goes bleed
