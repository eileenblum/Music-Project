3050... Aliens attack a spellbound is ripping the sky
The war force explode, the death hit is cold
A time machine brings the war from some past
The frost cut our souls, moon against earth
The soldiers prepare now their sword
Anybody knows!!! Who did this war back
Can hurt and meltdown mankind's rest

Dimensional gate can take our life to there
Thunder is our sign, a call will announce your time
Genghis Kan lives the ultimate warrior you'll see

Frozen... Deadly... War
Screaming... Blood and gore

Radiation and disease, the black mass will cry
In a time that machine govern
The space burns so hot. The star wars is true
As we all see in past times
The future is uncertain. As we see the present
And we all shall pay by last nights
The science create and involve us in war
Nothing can help us in fight
