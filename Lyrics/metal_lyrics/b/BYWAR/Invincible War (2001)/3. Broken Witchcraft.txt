[Perfetto, Regep]

Innocent an unhappy child
Born to live and grow so weak
Frightened to posses strange signs
Afraid to know her death she foresee
Bewitched and scared by evil force
Witchery now her evolutions way
Threated now bursting with fear
'Cause is coming soon her final day

[Chorus]
Full moon will arrive
Bless the witch in this time
Now it's time to free the witch
Let the fight of evil win

At trance on darkness doing rites
Bestial fire rising from her eyes
Like an evil and wise prophet

She can see the fate of mankind
But this spell can now be threated
By heaven's forces in this endless war
Clain for moon, her strongest allied
Hell's majesty will never die

[Solo: Perfetto]
