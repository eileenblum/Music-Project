[Perfetto, Ozio]

In the shadows of ablazing night
Reborn of the evil eye
Blood flows between the clouds
The saviour have no more powers
Questions born here in this hell
The seven trumpets are ringing again
Don't think of the last survivors
They're riding for all eternity
You'll see the light someday
Now pray! 'Cause short is your way
Don't go! Stay, in the mirror of your mind
She's an angel watching you die

[Solo: Perfetto / Regep]

This is the falling down
Give one chance to act
World is a genuine hell
You will burn and feel
Questions born here in this hell
The seven trumpets are ringing again
Don't think of the last survivors
They're riding for all eternity
