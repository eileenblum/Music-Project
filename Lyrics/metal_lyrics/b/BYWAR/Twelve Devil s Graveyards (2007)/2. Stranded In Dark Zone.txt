[Music &amp; Lyrics: Perfetto]

Fourth Dimension
Request Of Evil's Empire
Devastation
The graveyard of reckless crimes
Void and despair
Captive in madness of your brain
Time is unreal
Invisible world in darkness reign

[Chorus]
Now we're crumbling in devil's way
Stranded in darkzone there's no escape
The gates of hell in twilight float
Around us just see dust and bones
Time and space are crossing our lives
Fear and terror burning like fire
Stranded in Darkzone we all shall die!!!

There's no perception
Feelings of agony rise
Are we lost forever?
Never-ending maze or never-land?
Beyond this world
The escape of dreams you cannot see
Losing our hope
Delusion of reality

[Chorus]

[Solo: Roveran/Perfetto]
