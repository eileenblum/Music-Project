'The King spent many months in turmoil, his reign was over.
His expectant wife and child murdered in their sleep by shadowy figures.
And his people, abandoned.
He spent his days in the company of his Canon, fractured old men, whose complex talk of revenge and distasteful obsession with the dark, left stains on his mind.
Stains, he could not remove.
Months went by and the King, full of contempt for anyone living outside of Sarums walls, had a plan.
He motioned to an adviser to come closer, the gaunt old man slowly drifted forwards and pressed his ear close to the King.
The King whispered his final instructions and sat back in his chair.
His Canon conferred and turned to thank their king.
This would be the last time they would meet his gaze.
From this moment on, their King refused all food and water.
And waited. And waited.'
