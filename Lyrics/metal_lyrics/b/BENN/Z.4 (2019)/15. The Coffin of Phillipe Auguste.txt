Bring your dead and parade, parade,
Murder and offer the kinship,
Bring out your offer, parade, parade.
Sacrificially consistent.
I punish myself until I travel down,
Nothing has ever felt real.
I ruin the world until I travel down,
Know that I'll bring a parade.
I'm killing to see you, oh I travel down,
All that I could have stained.

How does it feel to see me again?
Have and to hold the withered hand.
Can you begin to hear me again?
Killing the boy and murder the man.
I let go of the world I witnessed.
(I don't believe anything that you're telling me)

And I would hold myself to ransom,
But I don't think you'd pay to set me free.
Plaguing, plaguing.
From this broken heart I leak.
And I would hold myself to ransom,
But I don't think you'd pay to set me free.
Plaguing, plaguing.
All these future memories.
