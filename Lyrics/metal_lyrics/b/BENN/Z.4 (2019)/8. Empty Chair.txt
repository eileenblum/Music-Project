Hold, holding yourself, oh for a while,
I'm longing to die like this.
Don't look for the end, before your time,
I long just to die like this.
I, I push a pin into your lungs.
I'm willing to die like this.
I, I'll be alone, oh when I'm done.
I'll willingly die like this.

I, I was alone until you shone your light and,
Covered my empty soul,
I, I was alone until you pulled me down and,
Showed me the world I own.

Hold me tightly,
Make this right.
Say you love me,
Cease your cry.
I will hold you down.

Bury the light and I'll see you again,
Smother your mouth as you signal for air.
Bury the light and I'll see you again while you,
Smother your mouth as you signal for air.

Hold me tightly,
Cease your crying.
Say you fell in love with me and save yourself.

How did I know?

Bury the light and I'll see you again,
Smother your mouth as you struggle for air.
Bury the light and I'll see you again,
Burying, and burying, and burying, and bury the end.
