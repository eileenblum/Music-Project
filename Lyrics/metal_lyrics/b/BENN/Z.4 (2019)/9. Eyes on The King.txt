What would he do if he thought you'd abandoned him,
What would he think if he knew?
What would he say if he heard you dishonor him,
What would he say if he knew?

Then what do you do when your life is an alibi,
Which of your paths do you choose?
And what do you do when your world is a fucking lie,
Which of your lives stand to lose?

I'm holding, holding onto everything that hurts me,
Hurts me again,
Drowning, drowning in a sea of angels, knowing the end.

And it's all eyes on the King,
Tell me who's the enemy,
With all eyes on the King.
(No I am not the me I am)
All eyes on the King,
Tell me who's the enemy,
With all eyes on the King.
(King, King)

What will he do, when he hears of your insolence,
What do you think he would do?
What will he do when he feels you cut into him?
One to de-throne him in two.

What do you do when your life is an alibi,
Which of your paths do you choose?
And what do you do when your world is a fucking lie,
Which of your lives stands to lose?

I'm holding, holding onto everything that hurts me,
Hurts me again,
Drowning, drowning in a sea of angels, knowing the end.

And it's all eyes on the King,
Tell me who's the enemy,
With all eyes on the King.
(No I am not the me I am)
All eyes on the King,
Tell me who's the enemy,
With all eyes on the King.
(King, King)

(Holding)
Holding on to everything that (hurts me) hurts me again,
Drowning, drowning in a sea of angels, knowing the end.
The end.
