'The Canon had been busy, their chambers were dank, dark, and inches of sandy dust covered the floor.
In front of them laid their work; piles and piles of heavy circular stones,
Coated with an unknown blue liquid.
Over the next few weeks, they slowly rolled the stones to the entrance,
And loaded them onto a wagon.
From here, they rode through the night, to the neighboring settlements, passing the decaying remains of the settlers, that had naively accepted their poisoned gifts.
When they arrived, they laid stones around the perimeter, and carefully poured a dark liquid on top of each, before scurrying away to lay the next.
In a matter of minutes, they could hear the coughs begin.
The wind direction was not an issue, now that the towns and settlements were surrounded.
As they rode their wagon away, they stopped to listen.
The screams of men, women and children alike, helped crack smiles on the weary faces of the Canon.
They rode on.'
