And I would hold myself to ransom,
But I don't think you'd pay to set me free.
Plaguing, plaguing.
All these future memories.
And I would hold myself to ransom,
But I don't think you'd pay to set me free.
Plaguing, plaguing.
From this broken heart I leak.

I made up this story to ruin your life,
Nothing could feel quite so sweet.
I'm broken and buried now under the lake,
Everything, lies in deceit.
