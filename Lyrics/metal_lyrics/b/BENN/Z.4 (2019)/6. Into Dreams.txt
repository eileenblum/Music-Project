Bring me your light and I'll trade you my dark,
Secrets and lies; fabrications of heart.
We feel so small when we look to the stars.
We pick out stars that we'd like to die on.

Hoping, praying to the stars,
Can't you see how wondrous we are?
And you're somewhere down there,
Can't climb up.

And you were my King and I was your Queen,
And we ruled a world; poorer than poorer can be.
But I smiled when I died.
Safe in the knowledge the life that I left was a lie.

Oh it's not fair we allow them to live,
They never once thought of us as their kin.
All of them wait on the edge of the hill,
Poisonous statues, succumb to the winds.

Hoping, praying to the stars,
Can't you see how wondrous we are?
And you're somewhere down there,
Can't climb up.

And you were my King and I was your Queen,
And we ruled a world; poorer than poorer can be.
But I smiled when I died.
Safe in the knowledge the life that I left was a lie.

It's only a dream.

And I am your King,
And I am your King, and you were my Queen,
And we ruled the world; darker than darker could be.
(Is this just a dream?)
