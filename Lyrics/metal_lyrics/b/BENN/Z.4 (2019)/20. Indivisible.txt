And there is nothing left to hear except the silence.
The birds refuse to sing but stand here in defiance.
And I can see my actions burned this world, it's pious.
And I'm divisible, I'm divisible.
And there is nothing left for me to say but sorry,
Believing everything that's spoken of so blindly.
And I have found the man I've come to fear inside me,
And I'm divisible, I'm divisible.
And I.

I have drawn a line in sands I'll never need.
A broken heart has led to hope, loss and defeat.
And I'm divisible, I'm divisible.

And I can see the world is fading now it's dying.
A lone example of a total lack of trying.
And there is nothing left for me to say but sorry.
And I'm divisible, I'm divisible.
And I have broken myself into two, I'm trying,
A door without a key and I am locked inside it.
A tiny opening above my head is closing now,
And I'm divisible, I'm divisible.
And I.

I can see the light of day again it's blinding.
A world of flame will soon return to ash, it's trying.
And I'm divisible, I'm divisible.
(And I am holding on)
And I am holding on,
And I am holding on,
And there is nothing I won't do.

And we are witness to the sun as it is rising,
The lows, the highs, the keys, the doors, the grand designing.
We're indivisible, indivisible and I,
I have lost myself in waves and rays so silent,
My heart is beating twice as fast and this makes no sense.
We're indivisible, indivisible and I.
