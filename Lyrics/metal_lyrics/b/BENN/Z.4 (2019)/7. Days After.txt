'Days after the attack, the remnants of his subjects, who had fled to hide in the forest, returned to Sarum, to see what remained.
When they realized that all was gone, they collected their families and belongings to leave, so that they may beg entry to neighboring settlements.
When the King received word, that his subjects were leaving, he asked his Canon to meet them at the entrance, where they were passed food for the journey as an offering of peace.
The subjects took the offerings and left.
No words were spoken.'
