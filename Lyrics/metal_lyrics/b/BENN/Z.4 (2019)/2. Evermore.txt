I'm here by your side, as you stare at the fire.
Listen, to my voice, you are fed, by the liars.
Searching, through the ruins of the life we aspired.

I'll, never let go, now I see who controls you.
They, murder the world, and obey only fortune.
Searching, through the ruins of the life we abandoned.

I can see, the worst you'll be,
I'm haunting you, evermore.
Poisoned to the core.
I can't leave, lest pull the need,
I'll out the men we abhor.

They'll never leave you alone,
They'll never leave you alone (never leave)
They'll never leave you alone.
They will not rest until they have found power in everything
They'll never leave you alone (never leave)
They'll never leave you alone (never leave)
They'll never leave you alone.
They will not rest until they have found power in everything

I can see, the worst you'll be,
I'm haunting you, evermore.
Poisoned to the core.
I can't leave, lest pull the need,
I'll out the men we abhor.
Searching through the ruins of,
Through the ruins of our love.
Searching through the ruins of,
Through the ruins of our love.
Poisoning the core.
