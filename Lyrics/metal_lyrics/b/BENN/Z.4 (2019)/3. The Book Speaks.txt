'The book speaks of a man, who called himself king.
Although even from my initial research it appears as though he had no right to carry the title.
You see, when we pick up the writings in the book, his subjects are already totally disillusioned by his rule.
Their king had not only failed them, he had betrayed them.
Even before the attack, his people were starving.
On the day of the attack, he barricaded himself in the main hall and waited for the cries of his people to cease before sending his Canon to witness the results of the carnage.
It appears as though Sarum isn't what we thought it was.
It's far older. And its shape and purpose are only now coming to light.
This is where they began, Henry. It all started here.'
