Bury me, far away.
Oh in the ground now I'm save.
Take me there,
Take my soul,
Oh in the ground now I'm home.

Silence, silence,
Oh please be quiet,
'Cause they split my head open and then they,
They filled it with lies,
No I won't, no I can't,
Choose between, the dark and the darkness in me.

So bury me, take my soul,
Oh in the ground now I'm home.
Take me there,
Far away.
In the ground now I'm afraid.

Silence, silence,
Oh please be quiet,
'Cause they split my head open and then they,
They filled it with lies,
No I won't, no I can't,
Choose between, the dark and the darkness in me.
