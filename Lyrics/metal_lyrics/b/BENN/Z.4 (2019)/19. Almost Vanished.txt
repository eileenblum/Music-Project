But what if we're wrong?
And we didn't understand, that everything we are is somewhat planned.
This hallway feels so long, now that you are gone.
The miracles have stopped, no furthering the soul.
But was I good enough for this to be real?
Because I can't understand these things I feel.
And I was better then, left with nothing now,
Yet underneath the lake, your light is pouring out.

And if only I could recognise your face.
Because without you by my side it's not the same.
And I'm almost vanished now.

You take all that I know, and took away the ends; I feel so cold.
And there is nothing left, for you to feed upon, so fly back to your nests and leave this ghost alone,
Because I have seen some things that I don't understand,
And I believe the future now is planned.
But the lake has frozen o'er.
And the trees are bending down, the clouds are burning up;
And the water's calling out. And I should say that;

There are things I should have seen,
But I was blinded by the light,
And I was only looking forwards,
But I never looked to my side,
I with I could trade our places,
I was meant for hell,
And I have never felt as though
I understand a single piece of this world.
Before you left me, I was proud,
And I was angry, I was whole,
I wasn't able to protect the only ones that I love,
How am I supposed to try and rectify the damage, as I suffocate,
My lungs they're slowly failing as they run out of air.
