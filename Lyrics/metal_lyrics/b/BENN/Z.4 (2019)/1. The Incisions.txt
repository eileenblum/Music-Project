'Are you listening?'

Pray to me, pray to me.
Pray for me, everything I am is just a fantasy.
You and I both know that this is all I need.
Time is drawing closer to the day we meet.
Day we meet.

And I'm cutting deep,
I, I, I, I, I know we're cutting through the enemies.
I, I, I, I, I fear they'll come until the end of days,
I, I, I, I, I hear them dying through the arrow waves, arrow waves.

Pray for me, unable to stem the sounds surrounding me,
Nothing like the ending you expect to see,
Your lack of imagination; comforts me, comforts me.

And I'm cutting deep,
I, I, I, I, I know we're cutting through the enemies.
I, I, I, I, I fear they'll come until the end of days,
I, I, I, I, I hear them dying through the arrow waves, arrow waves.

Cutting deep,
Painfully,
Cutting deep,
Plain to see.

Pray for me, as I sit here lonelily,
As I hold your majesty,
As I sit here lonelily,
As I hold the only.
