There is nothing left for us to say,
In-comprehensively we change.
Can you remember?
Rapidly the hope-loss it takes control,
And colour runs out and leaves us cold.
Can you remember?

Can you remember me my love?
Can you forget what you've become?
Can you remember me my love?
Can you forget what you've become?

I have tried so hard just to signal,
You can't see or hear me it's painful.
Can you remember?
In this moment I am a lost soul,
I wish you could join me in this cold.
Can you remember?
