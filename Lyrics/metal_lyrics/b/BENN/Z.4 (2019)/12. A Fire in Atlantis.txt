Let go of everything, everything,
Let go of everything, everything, let go of sin.

When we ask for sun, he gives us rain,
(Let go of everything and I, let go of everything, everything.)
And we ask for guidance now and he refrains.
(Let go of everything and I, let go of everything, everything.)
But we see him when we close our eyes and he knows what's at stake.
We can't help but feel the future is to blame.

I'm drowning. And we only serve the withered man.
Drowning, for his silence and his callous hand.
Drowning, Choking, Almost, Breathing.
While I'm setting stones.
I'm drowning, and we only serve the withered man.
I die alone in the end.

And he asks for love and he teaches us with pain.
(Let go of everything and I, let go of everything, everything.)
I could say the prayers, but they don't feel the same
(Let go of everything and I, let go of everything, everything.)
And I know this man, he looks like me but he knows things I don't.
I'm afraid this man was sent to cast the stones.
I die alone in the end.

I'm drowning. And we only serve the withered man.
Drowning. He will lead us from this hellish land.
Drowning, Choking, Almost, Breathing. While I'm setting stones.

(I'm drowning, I'm drowning, oh I drown. I drown.)

And we only serve the witheredâ¦
All the chains in hell couldn't hold me down,
Yeah as they try to hold my fucking crown.
And we only serve the withered man.
All the chains in hell couldn't hold me down,
Yeah as they try to hold my fucking crown.
(Drowning.)
He will lead us from this hellish land.
Drowning, Choking, Almost, Breathing.
Drowning. And we only serve the withered man.
I die alone in the end.
