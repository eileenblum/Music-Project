I'm not alone now, I'm not alone, alone.
I've been so helpless, can't even breathe now, buried alive, by light.
And I can't even help myself, can't even right my wrongs, all I've done, everything's false.
So help me, I need your help to see.
And I know everything.
Comes and pulls me; down the grave.
Your hands they guide me to my rest.
And your eyes, are blinding I cannot see.
And your light is blinding I won't concede.
And I know your light is fictional.
It's alright, your secret's safe tonight,
And we survive by candlelight.
