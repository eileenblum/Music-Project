I fear no man, cause I'm already dead
I fear no fucking man, cause I'm already dead

This place wasn't meant for the sempiternal
Everything here has been left to die

You're not in a land of mercy
These are graves of savages
[2x]

Your friends are crooks
We're fucking fiend
[2x]

This world is full of denial
I'm full of hate
Fuck this world
I want to watch it burn [2x]
[2x]

So dependent on false Gods, when they should be depending on themselves
[2x]

How does it feel, bitch?
