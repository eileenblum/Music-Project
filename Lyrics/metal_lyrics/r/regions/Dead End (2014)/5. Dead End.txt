I found my fucking comfort in being brought so low
So this is my claim, I have no fucking soul
I can't fucking stand you
So what the fuck are you doing here?
I hope you get fucked dead

I owe you torment
I will make this clear
I will make you suffer
I will show you fear

Sit back &amp; look at yourself
So pathetic, looking down on everyone else
Maybe I'm fucking insane
I've lost my mind [2x]
[2x]

Where were you when we were down &amp; out?
You fucked the whole world &amp; now I'm calling you out
You claimed your edge, your pride, but now you've sold out
You don't know who you are or what your about

Am I going insane for fucking feeling this way?
I've gone insane [2x]
Am I going insane for fucking feeling this way?
I hope my honesty [2x]
Brings dismay
