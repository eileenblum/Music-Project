There is no wrong or right, good or bad
Only those who can manage, &amp; those who can't

There is no wrong or right, good or bad
Only those who manage, &amp; those who can't
We all have our methods, we all have our vices
How we survive is what makes us who we are
I have foreseen that this world will fail
Don't hold back from your desires
The afterlife will not hold it against you

Indulge, there will not be a judgement cast
I have foreseen

I have foreseen countless bodies endure the suffering
Endure the suffering

Do this for yourself
These ill-minded fools feed on lies &amp; deception
Pray to your God in the T.V.
Consuming all that the sheep are taught to buy into
You're all fucking sheep [2x]

There is no wrong or right, good or bad
Only those who manage, &amp; those who can't
We all have our methods, we all have our vices
How we survive is what makes us who we are
I have foreseen that this world will fail
Don't hold back from your desires
The afterlife will not hold it against you

Pray to your God in the T.V., consuming all
You're all fucking sheep [2x]
