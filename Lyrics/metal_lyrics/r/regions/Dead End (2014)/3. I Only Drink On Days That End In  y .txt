[feat. Landis Pearce of Syopsis]You're crucifying this world with every judgement you make
Having one mindset will be your final mistake
[2x]

I won't stand aside &amp; watch my kind get put behind for your corruption &amp; false accusations [2x]
Fuck

You're turning this world to shit, &amp; I can't fucking face it
These lies you tell can't save you from Hell [3x]

Everything I've seen, I can't fucking believe
That no one made the effort to think
That this could all be for nothing
I won't live for a God, but I'll fucking live for me

Your faith is meaningless to me

Get out of my face
So fuck your faith
[2x]
Get out of my fucking face
