Don't let your temper crack, my fire burns
I see the weakness in your eyes
You're much too young to learn
I am the demon &amp; I will bring my own Hell

Let your past make you better not bitter
Try every day not to lose my mind
Life gets tough, but you better not quit her
Selfish scum try to ruin mankind
[2x]

This is my life
I won't be pushed around by ill-minded pretenders
I won't be pushed around

Your false idols have fallen
What do you do?
[2x]
