Asses to ashes
Sluts to dust [2x]
You are the reason behind my disgust

You fucking think that you've got it made, but all you've done is burn down bridges for the people that you've betrayed
[2x]

I'll sit back &amp; watch it all come together
I'll sit back &amp; watch it all fall apart
You've got your friends, but never say never, bitch
This was over before it got a start

We are the feared, the lost, &amp; the broken
Hell is my home. it's arms are wide open
We don't care if you scream &amp; crawl
Obliterate the masses
Fuck them all

Hail Satan

Hell is here, the strength I embrace
Claim my soul, become the demon's face
[2x]

I won't waste away
You can watch in shame
I won't waste away [2x]

You can call it foolish, I call you blind
I have sworn my life to this
[2x]
Fuck
