I'm shutting you out this time, burning the fucking bridge
I watched this city fall into the hands of a martyr [2x]

Count the crows
May the seasons change with plagues

Perched among their liars chairs
Consumed with minds of gluttony

The serpent whore who we once called our mother
I'll see this through, we will become her destroyer

Fuck forgiveness &amp; never forget
I won't be content until you breathe your final breath

You took all I had until there was nothing left [4x]

Debase the profits for their minor worth
Body bags filled with souls lower than dirt
[2x]

We are the wasted youth lost in existence
