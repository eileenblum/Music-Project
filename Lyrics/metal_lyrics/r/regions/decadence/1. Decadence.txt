[feat. Kyle of Bodysnatcher]Open up your eyes to see
You're no different than me
We are all slaves to this
Flesh eating disease
[2x]

A walking corpse with my head hung low

Lost in the here &amp; now
Our souls have disappeared &amp; they will never be found
[2x]

We devour all that brings light &amp; force feed shit to the mechanical minds [2x]

[Kyle]
Corruption is at work
Reaching climax on the highest peaks
Your leaders are swine, spewing falsifications
Through their crooked teeth on every scripted line

Open up your eyes to see
You're no different than me
We are all slaves to this
Flesh eating disease
[2x]

I am a walking corpse with my head hung low, six feet above the dirt

Born in a world of filth &amp; fucking greed
There's no hope for youth
No God damn room to breathe
[2x]
