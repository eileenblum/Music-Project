AinÂ´t no time to clean the webs,
Green InsomniaÂ´ll never go,
If I could only clear my mindâ¦
DonÂ´t blame me please Iâm sinkingâ¦

This boat is drifting.
Hell on earth, IÂ´d not expected such a trip.
This soul is drowningâ¦
What I have touched, spoiled
I donÂ´t have time to clean them up.

This boat is drifting.
Hell on earth, IÂ´d not expected such a trip.
This soul is drowningâ¦
What I have touched, spoiled
I donÂ´t have time to clean them up

Green Insomnia
AinÂ´t no time to clean the websâ¦

This boat is drifting.
Hell on earth, IÂ´d not expected such a trip.
This soul is drowningâ¦
Hell on earth, IÂ´d not expected such a trip.
The waterÂ´s reachingâ¦
The waterÂ´s clawing my neck
The secretÂ´s â¦
