Sometimes I can guess whatÂ´s on your mind-
Your eyes can tell me so muchâ¦
I wonder why I didnÂ´t pay attention
If you donÂ´t look into my eyes
And donÂ´t let me see into yours
The air is charged with so many questions,
Now I think it was only good impressionsâ¦

I could have sensed your madness
But didnÂ´t ask, didnÂ´t see, couldnÂ´t hide
Convinced you maybe like the distance
I had hoped two, three days
Might have been enoughâ¦

LetÂ´s have few minutes
Of friendly talk
Inside the van,
You canÂ´t mask all your thoughts-
I could ease the tension,
Not just have good intentions.

If you donÂ´t look into my eyes
And donÂ´t let me see into yours
The air is changed with so many questions
I thought everything was going well
Between you and I
But now I think it was only good impressionsâ¦

You should pay attention
When Iâm about to lose my patience-
Sometimes I can help youâ¦
When boring life has invaded your being,
I could also give you hellish tensionâ¦
Even have really bad intentions-
Bad moments by the hundreds-
Could answer all your questions.
