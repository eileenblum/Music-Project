Walking in circles around this room
IÂ´ve decided to leave everything.
The land that watched us grow is full of mud,
So many memories in this blue room.

Hypnotized by the ashes that covered the floor,
IÂ´d considered bringing some pieces of the life IÂ´d had before,
But It wasnÂ´t possibleâ¦
They all melted in my hands the moment I touched them.

There is a river swirling around-
Wrenching away my long-gone moments-
Throwing the door wide open to finally make me leave.
