On one side of this window
I lay down, waiting to see a bird
Carrying your soul,
Lift my arms,
Trying to reach the clouds
IÂ´m not afraid.

Somewhere in this city you might be
IÂ´d go outside running
Weakness or love?
Who the hell knows?
Weakness or love?
Who the hell knows?

If itÂ´s raining,
Where shall we go?
Whose funeral is it?
Yours or mine?
Who was chosen to die? Ah?
Who was chosen to die?

On one side of this window
I lay down, waiting to see a bird
Carrying your soul
Lift my arms
Trying to reach the clouds
IÂ´m not afraid
