ThereÂ´s nothing I can say
That you donÂ´t knowâ¦
Walking all the wayâ¦
DonÂ´t know where to goâ¦

Once someone told me,
Told me thereÂ´s a door
Walking all along the wayâ¦
DonÂ´t know where to goâ¦

I have broken the compass, I have lost my way
We killed dreams we had both made, we have lost our way
Wandering, wanderingâ¦

I have broken the compass, I have lost my way
We killed dreams we had both made, we have lost our way
Wandering, wanderingâ¦

I have broken the compass, I have lost my way
We killed dreams we had both made, we have lost our way
Wandering, wandering, wandering, wandering

Every door I knock is home, is home-aloneâ¦
Every door I knock is home, is home-aloneâ¦
Every door I knock is home, is home-alone.
