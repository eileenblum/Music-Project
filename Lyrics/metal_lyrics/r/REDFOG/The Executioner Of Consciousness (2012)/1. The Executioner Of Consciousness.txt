There are things in life
That come and go
Memories once came,
Forever couldÂ´ve stayed
I listen to the voices within,
Though my common sense tells me Iâm wrong.

I canÂ´t waste my life
Looking at myself in a mirrorâ¦
Watching how life goes
Behind me like a film.
Some things need time,
But not a lifetime to be solved.
MemoriesÂ´ll find their way to come,
Sooner or later they will, I know.

Now that they seem to be swimming in tears,
I want to recall how was that childrenÂ´s dance.
Now that they seem to be swimming in tears,
I want to recall how was that childrenÂ´s dance.

If memories find their way back to my mind,
Am I too late, late to change the past?

Does it matter how many times Iâve forgiven?
Does it matter that I looked around and found nobody?

Now that they seem to be swimming in tears,
I want to recall how was that childrenÂ´s dance.
Now that they seem to be swimming in tears,
I want to recall how was that childrenÂ´s dance.
