A dull and lifeless silhouette
Has fallen into a pool of dead roses
The battle of knives has finally made a huge wound
And a smell of pain has robbed its breath.

Naked words have shown their real power,
The light of the candle is dying-
While this soul is fainting.

CanÂ´t see the colors of the walls anymore
Â´cos they all keep falling down.
Rescue the shadow of this soul,
Revive the red petals that covered this heart.

Rescue the shadow of this soul,
Revive the red petals that covered this heart
Awake it with a kiss if there still be love-
Or let it fly to another paradise.
