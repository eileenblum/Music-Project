Capitols of homicide
Way too much to mention
Warfare claims a million lives
Bloodshed for redemption

Cities scarred by violence
Terror zones grow fast
Gunned down as you walk home
Justice and right comes last

War on drugs and supremacy
Warmongers gain their greed
Innocent victims pave their way
Power struggle now succeeds

Gone without a trace
Men has fallen from grace
Haunting warfare strikes
Unstoppable idle strife

Gone without a trace
Men has fallen from grace

Gang violence spreads the earth
Expanding destructive urge

Gang violence spreads the earth
Expanding destructive urge

Haunting warfareâ¦
Haunting warfareâ¦
Haunting warfareâ¦

Authorities stand powerless
Paralyzed by juvenile threats
System failed to avoid the killing
Another 187 is on their billing

Haunting warfareâ¦
Haunting warfareâ¦

Missed to hold their rivalry
All ends up in killing spree
Urban spots now killing ground
Coroner service increasing count
Hard times are coming through
Never know when it gets to you
Never know when it gets to you

Gone without a trace
Men has fallen from grace
Haunting warfare strikes
Unstoppable idle strife
