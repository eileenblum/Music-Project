Blowing up their houses
Undermine the streets
Ambush guerilla strikes
Crossfire still repeats
Hiding in the boondocks
Buried deep in mud
Entrenched bodies
Last blow is coming fast

The last campaign
Let freedom blast
With firing rain
Against the oppressor
Suicide commands
For your confessor

A haunting symphony
Of deafening battle cries
Leaving dead cold flesh
Uncertain who survives
Gathering the last strength
Mobilize partisan power
Unleash last hope glory
No time to pray and cower

United hordes - the last campaign
Abandoned lands in firing rain
Shell shock advance final fail
Divided troops scattered and maimed

The last campaign
Let freedom blast
With firing rain
Against the oppressor
Suicide commands
For your confessor

United hordes - the last campaign
Abandoned lands in firing rain
Shell shock advance final fail
Divided troops scattered and maimed

Clouds of dust, caustic eyes
Arrival of supplies
Warâ¦

Clouds of dust, caustic eyes
Arrival of supplies
Final strike with bombing hails
Freedom has prevailed
