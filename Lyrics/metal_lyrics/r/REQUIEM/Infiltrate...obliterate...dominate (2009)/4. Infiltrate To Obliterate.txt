Infiltrationâ¦
Assimilationâ¦
Obliterationâ¦
Dominationâ¦

Holding the power to change the mind
Until retaliation, the final time
Sneaking into the common rules
Mutate to collapse restrained fools

Becoming the wolf inside the flock
Gain their trust and take the cloth
Speaking into the weak ones souls
Exhaust their will to drop them cold

Infiltrate to obliterate
Obliterate to dominate
Erase the enemy of the ground
First intent the killing sounds

When the final day has come
No shelter left for anyone
Unleash the beasts deep inside
Establish the parasite in their minds

Infiltrate to obliterate
Obliterate to dominate
Erase the enemy of the ground
First intent the killing sounds

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Final power spreading wide

Install my will onto the weak
Infiltrate and slide in deep

Using their weapons against themselves
Control and reign what they once held
Show no mercy for my foes
Obliterate and leave no hope
