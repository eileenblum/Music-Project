Walking the streets of privileged right
Hiding my secrets until the final night
Before my mission is complete
To bring my deadly message to the weak

In this terror world I dwell
Living in my killing cell

Planning the mission for many years
No waste of thoughts about victimâs tears
Obeying the speech of my masters wisdom
To devastate infidel economic kingdoms

Living in my killing cell

Iâm a tool of terror on this world
Bringer of anguish is what Iâm called
Fighting on invincible fronts
Iâm an insane human bomb

Iâm a tool of terror on this world
Bringer of anguish is what Iâm called
Fighting on invincible fronts
Iâm an insane human bomb

When the final day is near
Hate has come and lost my fear
Just about a few hours left
Before I earn my reward for this threat

Killing cellâ¦

I really believe in what I do
Iâm a remote controlled killer too
Obeying the commands of prophets
Deep believe my faithful profit

When the final day is near
Hate has come and lost my fear
Just about a few hours left
Before I earn my reward for this threat

In this terror world I dwell
Living in my killing cell

Iâm a tool of terror on this world
Bringer of anguish is what Iâm called
Fighting on invincible fronts
Iâm an insane human bomb

In this terror world I dwell
Living in my killing cell
Praying for my final mission
Until Iâll become a martyr assassin
