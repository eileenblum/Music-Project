Some things, clear to a blind eye
Others denied by conscious minds
Illusions, never what theyâre used to be
Drawing conclusions trying to foresee

My hate, my life, my forlorn wish
I never forget and never forgive
My empty words act like lashes
I will rise, rise from the ashes

Now awaken to my goddamn given rights
Better should have let sleeping dogs lie
Finalizing my bound path that lies ahead
Never retreat; never regret my words of shred

Always have been down, now the die is cast
No more meeting demands leaving behind in dust

Denying control from your malfunction
Let freedom ring with extreme unction
Denying control from your malfunction
Let freedom ring with extreme unction
Denying control from your malfunction
Let freedom ring with extreme unction

No more obeying to this vile reign
Burning the bridges, storm of my bane
Storm of my bane

My hate, my life, my forlorn wish
I never forget and never forgive
My empty words act like lashes
I will rise, rise from the ashes

From the hidden soil into the tunnels end
This is my time there is no mercy to grant
Finalizing my bound path that lies ahead
Never retreat; never regret my words of shred
