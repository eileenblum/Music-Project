I saw the lamb opened one of the seals
Noise of thunder says come and sees
And behold I saw a white horse
The crown rider went forth his course
Opening the second seal
Beasts saying come and see

Second rider took peace from earth
Killing one another 10000 days worth

And when he had opened the third seal
I heard the beast say come and see
And behold I saw a black horse
Riderâs holding the balance forth

The great day of wrath has come
No surviving for anyone
King or beggar no one shall stand
Until the killing is fulfilled

Opening the fourth seal
And I looked a pale horse
His name is death to kill with the sword
And hunger and beasts of hellâs court

The great day of wrath has come
No surviving for anyone
King or beggar no one shall stand
Until the killing is fulfilled

After opening the fifth seal
The altar of slain souls I see
On them that dwell on earth
Thou not judge and avenge the blood

Final conflict, final conflict, final conflict
Final conflict, final conflict, final conflict

And when he had opened the third seal
I heard the beast say come and see
And behold I saw a black horse
Riderâs holding the balance forth

Final conflict, final conflict, final conflict
Final conflict, final conflict, final conflict

On them that dwell on earth
Thou not judge and avenge the blood
And behold opening the sixth seal
Stars are falling from the sky
Heaven departed, four horseman rides
The sun went black and blood moon shines
