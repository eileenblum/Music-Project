Unleashed with sacred rites
Last redemption, the final time
Doomed through this deception
Building a new conception

Feed my hate with a great plague
And let them all perish in flames
Separate their faith from flesh
Bodies descend in skies of death

Unborn wish, demise of peace
Prophecies, all cast in flame
Hate driven heretic deceit
Now the truth has made its claim

Spreading this disease of hate
Archetype for my heretic raid
Dark procession of cold blood
Embrace death for the wrong god

Hate driven heretic deceitâ¦
Hate driven heretic deceitâ¦
Hate driven heretic deceitâ¦

Spreading this disease of hate
Archetype for my heretic raid
Dark procession of cold blood
Embrace death for the wrong god...
God... god... god... god... god...

Unborn wish, demise of peace
Prophecies, all cast in flame
Hate driven heretic deceit
Now the truth has made its claim

Born disorder, born by flood
Burial of saints by war and blood
Sinister horns lead to temptation
Legions of hate, the annihilation
