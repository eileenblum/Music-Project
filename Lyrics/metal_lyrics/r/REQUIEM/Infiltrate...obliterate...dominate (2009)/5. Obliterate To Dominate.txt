Drinking your hope through infiltration
No chance given, no separation
Choose your weapon, Iâll hunt you down
For what is mine Iâll receive the crown

Dominationâ¦
Infiltrationâ¦
Assimilationâ¦
Obliterationâ¦

Enemies, foes you are warned
Extend my power to a final score
Crushing your will with slavery
Dominate your world eternally

Bloodstained ground
Broken will is bound
Victory is mine to take
Obliterate and dominate

Choose your place between the sides
With or against me you decide
Your downfall will come by time
Black dominion marks the sign

Relentless is my greed to kill
Call me sick, insane or ill
No matter whatâs the actual cause
I will sent you to the morgue

Am I human or natureâs beast
The truth, you are about to see
You are condemned to underlie
And Iâll dominate âtil the end of time
