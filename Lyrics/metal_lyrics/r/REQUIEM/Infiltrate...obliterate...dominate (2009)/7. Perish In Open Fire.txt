Lurking beyond the shadows
Of my inner hidden lair
Reborn of forgotten evil
I once used to care

Exploring the depths
Of what was lost and denied
Never reckoned that I shouldnât
Have tried to defy

All whatâs left behind
All whatâs been denied
Now is the time to reprise
Spilling out of the mind

Seductive art of human root
Breaking loose immense and new
Deformed into unknown art
Envenomed on homicidal chart

All whatâs left behind
All whatâs been denied
Now is the time to reprise
Spilling out of the mind

Thou shall not defy
Never forever in time
What was not known?

Hour of reprisal
Left behind
No change in sight
Been denied

Burning in the open flames
For victory and endless reign
Forgotten souls forever lost
Mutilated bodies pay the cost

Thou shall not defy
The hour to reprise
Despised and denied
Desperate change in sight

Forward to the fields of fate
No more hope opens the final gate
Forever marching on and on
No hope, no glory, humanityâs gone

Thou shall not defy
The hour to reprise
Despised and denied
Desperate change in sight

Everybody has gone insane
My mind bleeds in terror, in vain
Pulling the trigger a final blast
Unleashed my eternal wrath

Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth
Let them bleed with violent boost
Advancing battle million times
Bells of funeral, final chimes

Perish in the open fire
Mouth of war, the blood desires
