Desire for blood and insane lust
Obsessed by sounds of a final gasp
Driven through a malicious intent
Unreal wishes for a final end

Havoc
Mayhem
The signs of chaos
Curse of the Zodiac rites
At dawn a silent cry

Hunting is the game to play
Trapping a victim, a perfect day
Never resist this inner temptation
Cease them lifeâs the domination

Developing the rules that count
Bound by impulse digging the ground
Disposal of the evident remains
Under the soil a common grave

Havoc
Mayhem
The signs of chaos
Curse of the Zodiac rites
At dawn a silent cry

Malicious intent
Final end
Curse of the Zodiac rites

Wear these scars of my tradition
Obsessed by the insane ambition
Haunting curse of the Zodiac rites
Amongst dusk and dawn a silent cry

Malicious intent
Final end
Curse of the Zodiac rites

Havoc
Mayhem
The signs of chaos
Curse of the Zodiac rites
At dawn a silent cry

Wear these scars of my tradition
Obsessed by the insane ambition
Haunting curse of the Zodiac rites
Amongst dusk and dawn a silent cry

Slash the limbs, symbols of ambition
Hidden in the family tradition
Proper and in tearing hurry
Systematic psychic scary
