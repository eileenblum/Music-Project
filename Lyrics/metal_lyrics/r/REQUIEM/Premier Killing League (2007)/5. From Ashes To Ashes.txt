Travelling the road of time
Existence the meaning of life
From ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Resting in peace, eternal and just

Born with nothing and nothing we'll be
Simple creatures - so called human breed
From birth to death our path is short
Unfulfilled hopes in the last resort

Travelling the road of time
Existence the meaning of life
From ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Resting in peace, eternal and just

From nothing to nothing
From dust to dust
From ashes to ashes
Eternal and just

From nothing we came - naked and poor
The end predicted and assured
Using time in senseless ways
What's right or wrong - only shades of grey...
Shades of grey...

Travelling the road of time
Existence the meaning of life
From ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Resting in peace, eternal and just

Cultures, creations come and go
Ain't built to last for those who know
Dust to dust, eternal and just
Dust to dust, eternal and just

Final remains - just an illusion
Mankinds dreams vanish in conclusion

Do we ever seize what it means
Living on the edge catching for dreams
A short vacation existing with
Until receiving the reapers kiss
