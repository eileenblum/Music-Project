You always play the victim
Now I see behind your lies
I'd rather turn around
Cause you're wasting my time

Declining relation
Contorted perception
Low life person
With manic delusions

I can't accept your lies
No longer stand by your side
You drained life out of me
Live in your own misery

Declining relation
Contorted perception
Low life person
With manic delusions

No means nothing...
No means nothing for you - face the facts we're through
No means nothing...
No means nothing for you - face the facts we're through
No means nothing...
No means nothing for you - face the facts we're through
No means nothing...

Who do you think you are
With your low self-esteem
No is not an option
Repressing your chasing dreams
Who do you think you are
With your low self-esteem
No is not an option
Repressing your chasing dreams

Who do you think you are
With your low self-esteem
No is not an option
Repressing your chasing dreams
Who do you think you are
With your low self-esteem
No is not an option
Repressing your chasing dreams

Escaping psychic deconstruction
Ceasing talking interruption
Declining relation
Intended desolation

You drained life out of me
Live in your own misery
I was too blind to see
That you're only using me

No means nothing...
No means nothing for you - face the facts we're through
No means nothing...
No means nothing for you - face the facts we're through
No means nothing...
No means nothing for you - face the facts we're through
No means nothing...
No means nothing for you - face the facts we're through
