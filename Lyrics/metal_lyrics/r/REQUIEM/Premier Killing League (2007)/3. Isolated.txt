Isolated through my own will
Silence finally fulfilled
Isolated through my own will
Silence finally fulfilled
Isolated through my own will
Silence finally fulfilled
Isolated through my own will
Silence finally fulfilled

Isolated through my own will
Silence finally fulfilled
Isolated through my own will
Silence finally fulfilled
Isolated through my own will
Silence finally fulfilled
Isolated through my own will
Silence finally fulfilled

I feel the weight of the world on my back
Present, past and future - I only see red
Without rest my final conclusion
To vanish from this real illusion

Dreams of hope attending my life
Freedom of mind rush now declines
Objecting the question for my situation
Respecting the answer, my final destination

Leave me alone - stop expecting
Leave me alone - emotions rejecting

Isolation - determination...

Leave me alone - stop expecting
Leave me alone - emotions rejecting

Isolation - determination...
Isolation - determination...

Leave me alone - stop expecting
Leave me alone - emotions rejecting
