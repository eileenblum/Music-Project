Started with nothing and much we have seen
Simple music for this so called scene
Ten years of trying to go forward
No big push and none of reward

Ten fast years - here to stay
Music business
Times have changed
Rules are set
Cash whores - pledge
Ten long years - we have played
Music business
Times have changed
Played for free
Or let it be

Promoters complaining about cash
Filling pockets, bands earn less
Meaning of music has gone lost
How should ya know whom you can trust

Ten fast years - here to stay
Music business
Times have changed
Rules are set
Cash whores - pledge
Ten long years - we have played
Music business
Times have changed
Played for free
Or let it be

Can't afford to go forward
...to go forward
...to go forward
...to go forward
Can't afford to go forward

Bands are being used
Only few getting boost
Labels don't care
Unloyal - unfair

Fans blinded by media hype
Led like sheep (to) assorted kinds
Open your minds and care
Stay loyal and fair

Underground - we still pay
United - we will stay
Industry - still gets rich
Enemies - we're not finished
