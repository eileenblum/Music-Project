The great masquerade, the great masquerade...

2000 years of lies and misery
In the name of god and Christianity
Exploiting people's blind faith
Using their trust for worldly aims

Invading countries in the name of Christ
Innocent people - heathen victims died
Centuries of wars to make them pliable
Faithless acts through history undeniable

Denying the deeds of the holy church
Hatred and pain hundreds of years worth
Where's their so called honesty
Most of times - warmongers insanity

The great masquerade, the great masquerade...

Admit, all of what you have done
In the name of your holy son
Stop preaching about new born trust
Institutional faith never will be just

Admit, all of what you have done
In the name of your holy son
Stop preaching about new born trust
Institutional faith never will be just
Admit, all of what you have done
In the name of your holy son
Stop preaching about new born trust
Institutional faith never will be just

Denying - inquisition
Denying - oppression
Denying - forced conversion
Denying - facts emerging

Behind their holy bureaucracy
Never admitting their insane deeds
Believing in greed - deep faith trance
Acting against the ten commandments
