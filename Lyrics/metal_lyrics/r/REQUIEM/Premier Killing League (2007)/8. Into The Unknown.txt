Into the unknown
Through mist and rain they roam
Surrending leads to certain death
Onwards into unknown threat

The sound of tank tracks cut the silence
Enemy forces under hidden surveillance
Obeying commands from dusk 'til dawn
Faithless expectations, this mission is forlorn

Into the unknown
Through mist and rain they roam
Surrending leads to certain death
Onwards into unknown threat

Seconds seem like minutes
Minutes feel like days
Paralyzed through bombing rain
Massive force prevails
Dreams have gone away
Nightmares everyday
Face to face with destiny
To be next in killing spree

To be next in killing spree
Killing Spree...
Killing Spree...

Scattered remains cover the ground
Attended by human screaming sounds
All thoughts of hope no final chance
There's no mercy by the enemy advance

When will it end, where is silence
There's no light no thought of defiance
This battle is longtime history
Only remembrance eternally

Into the unknown
Through mist and rain they roam
Surrending leads to certain death
Onwards into unknown threat
