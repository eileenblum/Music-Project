Terrorist...

Terror, terror everywhere
The world has gone insane
Terror, terror is all I see
Who's the one to blame
Wolves in sheep's clothing
Living door to door
Media makes us believe
To distrust your neighbours anymore

Who's the terror, who's the hate
Where's justice, where's faith

Terror, terror everywhere
The world has gone insane
Terror, terror is all I see
Who's the one to blame
Wolves in sheep's clothing
Living door to door
Media makes us believe
To distrust your neighbours anymore

Who's the terror, who's the hate
Where's justice, where's faith
Who's the terror, who's the hate
Where's justice, where's faith

Airport security pushed to the max
Dangers and threats are now known facts

Am I terror - I, terrorist
Am I terror - I, terrorist
Am I terror - I, terrorist
Am I terror - I, terrorist
Terror, terror...

Am I terror or am I peace
Can't believe in what I see
Can't believe in what I hear
All around me they're speaking of fear
Am I terror or am I peace
Can't believe in what I see
Can't believe in what I hear
All around me they're speaking of fear

Eyes gone blind by TV raid
Who tells the truth
Or who's speaking with
Unreflected hate
War on terror everywhere
Who's the one to blame
And where's the real evil
Knowing their names

Eyes gone blind by TV raid
Who tells the truth
Or who's speaking with
Unreflected hate
War on terror everywhere
Who's the one to blame
And where's the real evil
Knowing their names

Who's the terror, who's the hate
Where's justice, where's faith

Terror, hate, justice, faith...
