Hiding inside, hiding outside
Who am I and of what kind
Questions, answers surely locked
Keeping secrets my inner god

Within I hide - no one to defy
Within I hide - no one to defy... trapped inside

Tried to run, tried to walk
Who is the, one who talks
Answers, questions thinking for
Hidden secrets forever more

Within I hide - no one to defy
Within I hide - no one to defy... trapped inside

Flooding emotions
Can't shut them out
Inside struggle
Will bring me down

Based on data
Weird cerebral code
Flickering life signs
Current stand by mode

Trapped inside...

Based on data
Weird cerebral code
Flickering life signs
Current stand by mode

Trapped inside...

Alone with me, reflecting spree
Thoughts turn to anguish
Flattering cerebral language

Within I hide - no one to defy
Within I hide - no one to defy... trapped inside

All that remains
Within I hide
Physical decay
Trapped inside
