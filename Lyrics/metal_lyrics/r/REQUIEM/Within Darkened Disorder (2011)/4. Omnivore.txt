Blood...

Hunting the prey, tried to possess
There's no way out, killing by time
Stop hunting me - I stop hunting them
Desire collides, creating the grief
Redeeming pain, final relief - final relief

Before you die, your life passes before your eyes
Spread my bloodshed, my ambition, true love runs red

Predator - your trail of pain
Omnivore by nature - I follow my plan
Omnivore - public display
Predator chasing homicidal ways

Before you die, your life passes before your eyes
Spread my bloodshed, my ambition, true love runs red

Predator - your trail of pain
Omnivore by nature - I follow my plan
Omnivore - public display
Predator chasing homicidal ways

Life's dropping out, blood trickling through the sky
Cold steel entering lifeless tissue remaining vanishing cries

Final thoughts - emotional appeal

My will - I kill - kill for pleasure
My will - I kill - kill for pleasure

My true nature is now revealed

Hunting the prey, tried to possess
There's no way out, killing by time
Stop hunting me - I stop hunting them
Desire collides, creating the grief
Redeeming pain, final relief - final relief

Before you die, your life passes before your eyes
Spread my bloodshed, my ambition, true love runs red

Predator - your trail of pain
Omnivore by nature - I follow my plan
Omnivore - public display
Predator chasing homicidal ways
Marked by the signs of chaos
Diary damaged brains came across

Predator - your trail of pain
Omnivore by nature - I follow my plan
