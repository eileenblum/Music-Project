Writhe in the torment as the weak flesh starts to fall
Devouring greed calls - judgment for all
Expels from utopia as the hunger advanced
Exploited wasteland for this ambitious demand

Feed... the greed

Burning souls sweeping down - virgin lands underground
Covering souls with cold - system's whores to behold
Sin - sin - greed spreads disease
Sin - sin - greed demands to bleed
Punished for the lust of need - lust for excess
Spawn the sin - impurity has progressed
Sin - sin - demons in disguise
Sin - sin - thousand ways to demise

Filthy and substantial - the lust craves for the needs
Hoarding the possessions - avaricious and miserly
Sin - sin - demons in disguise
Sin - sin - thousand ways to demise
Vanishing fragments - nothing's left within
Changing inner conflicts infesting in my skin

Greed - deadly sin
Selfishness - inordinate love of things

Greed - lust denies the need
Punishment in hell shale be

Possession - ultimate obsession
Take more than you can ever use

Always take and never give
Prolific cause of all what's evil... evil

Feed... the greed

Sin - sin - greed spreads disease
Sin - sin - greed demands to bleed
Writhe in the torment as the weak flesh starts to fall
Devouring greed calls - judgment for all
Punished for the lust of need - lust for excess
Spawn the sin - impurity has progressed
Sin - sin - demons in disguise
Sin - sin - thousand ways to demise

Greed - deadly sin
Inordinate... inordinate love of things
Suffer - suffer for what you have become
Eternal punishment shall be done... shall be done
