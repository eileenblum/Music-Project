Too late...

There is no shelter - from the beginning storm

As we've entered this dark path of disorder
Cataclysmic impurity
The time is short - all attempts were in vain
Follow this trail - let the darkness reign

Let the darkness reign...

Purification revolves - possibilities non-existent
There is no shelter - no resistance

Beyond the unknown - seminal start of a new order
Dawn turns to dusk - all hope's lost
Every incident has its source - the gale of judgment is enforced
In this times of regret with wilted beliefs obsessed

Transition - resurrection of the dead
Genocide purified
Transition - resurrection of the dead
Damnation - ending of all times

Watching ourselves die - foretold in a black sky
Water turns to blood - all hope is lost
Stabbing wounds in twisted minds - inmates of our design
Chaos reigns upon mankind - our bloodline declines

Transition - resurrection of the dead
Genocide purified
Transition - resurrection of the dead
Damnation - ending of all times

Too late... hell awaits...

The slaughter of the lamb
Heralds the rising of the damned
Earth AD rest in pain
Disorder and darkness reigns

A crown of thorns - no more divine
Blood grace the air - days turn to night
Earth AD rest in pain
Disorder and darkness reigns

Underneath the blood red sky
Land of chaos marked by the signs
Within disorder - darkness rise

Within disorder darkness shall rise

On these ruins - the final gate
Dark realm dominion awaits
Damnation - the end of our age

Within disorder darkness shall rise
