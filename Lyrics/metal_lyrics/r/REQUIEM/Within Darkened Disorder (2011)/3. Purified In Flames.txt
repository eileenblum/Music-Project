The night is black without a moon
The holy hunters gather on... burn...

The air is thick - the air is still
Looming torches herald the kill
The righteous rise with burning eyes
Inquisition fed by fear and lies

Trials - In the name of the church grotesque
Torture - Vigilante hate possessed
Sentenced - Disciples of the sacred snake
Burning - Upon the fiery stake... burn...

Trials - Tortute - Sentenced - Burning

Questions - Confession - Purified in flames
Councils - Conviction - Purified in flames

Trials - the church grotesque
Torture - by hate possessed

As they burn in these flames
The saints of hellfire awake
Lambent fire lightens the sky
Behold the preachers' evil eye
The convent conjures the Lamb of God
Against heresy, apostasy and witchcraft

Trials - the church grotesque
Torture - by hate possessed
Sentenced - the sacred snake
Burning - upon the stake
