Life means to suffer
Never getting along
Before it charges you for all inner fear
This time all hope is gone - all is wrong

Solemn sacrifice - mankind's primal fire
Far too late there's no escape

Condemned to suffer
Everything is out of control
This world is soulless - we're forced to dread
This defective earth is soon to be dead

A world of sacrifice - fall in line
Devoured in sublime dark times

This sacrifice is solemn
Anguish - distress
This sacrifice is solemn
Anguish - distress

Fall in line - sacrifice
Global - lunacy
Fall in line - sacrifice
Global - lunacy

No more lies
No more noise

The opposite of life is indifference
Pray to a brand new religion

This sacrifice is solemn
Anguish - distress
This sacrifice is solemn
Anguish - distress

No more lies
No more noise

Safe the world is a fiction
Never to be achieved
Can't change tomorrow - can't change today
What was once right went astray

Solemn sacrifice - mankind's primal fire
Far too late there's no escape
A world of sacrifice - fall in line
Devoured in sublime dark times

Promised to live in eternal bliss
The old world order won't be missed

This is a solemn sacrifice
