Favoring the acorn in a herd of swine
Compelled to enslave these virgin minds
Dwelling in the hidden cryptic tombs
Expelled from the infernal womb

I am, I am...

My name is Legion
Beneath the flesh I am
For we are many
Inside this mortal man

Legion

My name is Legion
Beneath the flesh I am
For we are many
Inside this mortal man
In legions I am the words of hate
In legion I am the one the pain creates

Angel's blood is flowing through my veins
Thousand-year exile inside this filthy cage
I am the sum of all demons that infest
Possessed by six thousand with sulphur you will be blessed

...with sulphur you will be blessed

A festering cesspool of all things sick and vile
Sadistic guardian of a dark defile
Rising from the tomb - Creeping inside
That no mortal man shall pass by

No one shall pass by

Spinning webs up to the steps of insurrection
Incantations of this heretic infection

I am blasphemy into the skin of faith
As weakness devours this broken trace

Seven serpents, seven seas, seven walls imprison me
Seven serpents, seven seas, seven walls imprison me

I am, I am...

My name is Legion
DIscharged from the light
Six Thousand Creatures
Locked in this burial site

In Legions I am the scorn of light
In rage I am the words of spite
Abandon all hope - into the abyss
Embrace death from the sepents kiss
