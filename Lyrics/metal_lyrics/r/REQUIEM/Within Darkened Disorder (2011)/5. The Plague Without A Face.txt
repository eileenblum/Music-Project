Increasing pandemic diseases
Increase occurred in recent years

Venomed waters

Disease will spread
The end is near
Human research
No hope - only fear

Unknown virus
Can't be controlled
Pandemic plague
Extinction unfolds

The plague without a face

This is the point of no return
Extinction shall be done
Disappearance can't be undone

Refused to repent
What they have done
Tongues in agony
Cursed the god of heaven - heaven

Throne of the beast
Kingdom into darkness
The human race
Has fallen from grace

Plague...

Ravaged soil
Venomed waters
Outbreak of sickness - weakened creature
Poisoned sea - dying world

The plague without a face
We have fallen from grace
Plague has taken control
We have lost it all

Plague...

Death has come to take my last breath

Our fate is sealed today
Our seed will be slayed
Disease will spread
Imminent death

Plague taking control
Too late to hear the call
Point of no return
Becoming creatures nocturne

No hope for cure
Non-existing saviour
Deterioration grows

Decay of society comes fast
Bearing this grim charge
Immune system restrained
Severe defect sustained
