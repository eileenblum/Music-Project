Strike - kill

This is the the will to kill

Initial - assessing factors in pain
The outcome now becomes clear
The challenge - limiting the cost
Calculating the loss
Offensive - plan of attack
Defines the source not the size
Positioning - tactics are set
Until we advance... for the strife

Strike first kill fast reclaim the throne
Ahead into the killing zone
Mission complete for victory
Fulfilling our destiny

Vicious deception at hand
No mercy will be grant

Strike first kill fast reclaim the throne

Mission complete for victory
Fulfilling our destiny

The art of war
Enemies are outscored
Vicious deception at hand
No mercy will be grant

Onwards - Attack

Directing - controlling the force
Achieving the goals once more
Illusions - hiding orders beneath
Overrun and strike at the weak

Engaging the force - endangered by direct conflict
Defeat the opponent and the loss will inflict

Mocking - observing the rival
No chance for their survival
Conjuncture - accessible ground
Invading onward inbound

Variation of tactics trussing all energy
Expecting the onslaught use all your abilities

Fight fire with fire - force of the flame
Cultivating advantage - trophy obtained

One last advance
Vicious deception at hand
Union prevails
The defeat is unveiled
