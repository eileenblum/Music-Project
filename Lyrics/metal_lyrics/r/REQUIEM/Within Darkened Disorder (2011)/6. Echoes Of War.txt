Forced to suicide mission
Chosen for sacrifice
Expendable human resource
Food for powder all these lives
Collateral mortal waste
On altars of greed
Apathy pervades our culture
Devoting our own seed... strike...

Mental wrecks thrown to the fire
Spreading madness internally
Families condemned to suffer
No cure can be achieved
Coming home with addiction issues
There is more than meets the eye
Refused to regain their lives
Upon their return from strife

Echoes of war - cannons fall silent
Souls lost into nevermore

Going off to foreign countries
At the behest of others that decide
Among these returning veterans
Instances of suicide
Overrun by mauling tank tracks
Oncoming storm
Roaring cannons now fall silent
Remembrance our ultimate downfall

Post-traumatic stress disorder
Aftermath of battlefield horrors
Bringing along multiple issues
No more chance to subdue

Echoes of war - cannons fall silent
Souls lost into nevermore
Echoes of war - cannons fall silent
Souls lost into nevermore

Post-traumatic stress disorder
Aftermath of battlefield horrors... retreat...

Suicide and collective killing
Implied by twisted minds
Murder, rape and assault
Are just the prevalent crimes
Flaps of skin in barbwire
Forever burned in memories
Suffering screams - chased by nightmares
Seeds of hate in their bloodstreams

Front line trauma - Burning from inside
Front line trauma - Burning from inside

Echoes - battle - machine gun fire
Attack - retreat - inside the wire
Front line trauma - Burials on battlegrounds
Burning from inside - -Still the lament sounds
