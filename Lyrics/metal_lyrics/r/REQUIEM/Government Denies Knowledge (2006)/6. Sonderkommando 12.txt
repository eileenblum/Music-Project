They lead them into certain death
Selling their people to the SS
Hired by the masters in black
Cleansing with gas to the last breath

They lead them into certain death
Selling their people to the SS
Hired by the masters in black
Cleansing with gas to the last breath

Dragging their corpses to a pile
Burning their bodies increases lifetime
A little more food is what they earned
Before themselves got killed and burned

Dragging their corpses to a pile
Burning their bodies increases lifetime
A little more food is what they earned
Before themselves got killed and burned

Revolution was one final chance
Killing their masters the last advance
They couldn't stop the black machine
Freedom only remained a bloody dream
