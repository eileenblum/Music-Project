My bodies full of testosterone
Hormones reign over my will
This is the genetic overkill
Men lead by DNA structure
No own will just chemical facts
Effect the mind
Our short life is out of control
Hormone supremacy creates our role

My will, my thrill â control, my role
My will, my thrill â control, my role

Relations, sex, love and hate
Controlled by tiny atoms
Invisible for human eyes
untrue that humans are wise
We all know the facts
but believe in our own control
Face the facts and realize
the atomic hormone power rise

My will, my thrill â control, my role
My will, my thrill â control, my role

Chemics, physics and sciences
Explore the body for several years
Facts and structure seems so weird
The answer lies within ourselves
Not in books on some fucking shelf
Hormones decide the ways of ripe
No escape, just human life
No escape, just human life
No escape... just human life... no escape

Trying, trying to control my self
Planning my life with a new born faith
No chance to command my ways
Science facts I believe in now

How could I be a damn fool
Hormone supremacy made me a tool
Closing my eyes for reality
No own will, no mystery

My will, my thrill â control, my role
My will, my thrill â control, my role
Control...
