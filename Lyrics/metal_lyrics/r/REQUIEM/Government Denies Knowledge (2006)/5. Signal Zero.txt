3.20 powder fills the air
4.30 the last bullets we shared
5.10 the order comes again
6.40 the end is near for whom for when

7.00 the enemy gets nearer
8.42 this is hell this is true
9.14 no real chance to win
10.13 hearing their screams

Signal Zero â The final chance
Signal Zero â One last advance
Signal Zero â Death Enhancer
Signal Zero â No one answers

Signal Zero â The final chance
Signal Zero â One last advance
Signal Zero â Death enhancer
Signal Zero â No one answers

The final mission, it should be
No thoughts of death, no conscious reality
The bleeding world, is all that's left
Our cheap lives, pushed to the edge
Signal Zero â Final chance

3.20 powder fills the air
4.30 the last bullets we shared
5.10 the order comes again
6.40 the end is near for whom for when

7.00 the enemy gets nearer
8.42 this is hell this is true
9.14 no real chance to win
10.13 hearing their screams

Signal Zero â The final chance
Signal Zero â One last advance
Signal Zero â Death enhancer
Signal Zero â No one answers

Signal Zero...

Signal Zero â final chance...
