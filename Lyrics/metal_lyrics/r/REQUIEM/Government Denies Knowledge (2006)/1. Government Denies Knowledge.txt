On the road paved with lies
Rest the goals we'll never reach
Stupid rules we have to live by
Deception is all they (really) preach

Never hearing what really happens
Led to believe we're doing right
Their decisions leave strange patterns
Not our business, but we're left to fight

We're doing right, but we're left to fight
Government denies knowledge...

They tell us stories hard to believe
Winning our trust by selling us dreams
(At) the point with nothing to achieve
Except to pay for someone's extremes

Nothing heard
Nothing seen
Nothing done
Government denies knowledge

Picked by a few to speak for all
Ensuring us nothing can go wrong
Only building towers destined to fall
Seems there's none that's really strong

No one to blame, we choose to be prey
The are the vultures, we the mice
But for those lives served on a tray
Get the fuck up!!! Think you live twice?!?

Nothing heard... seen... done
Nothing heard... seen... done
Nothing heard... seen... done
Government denies knowledge

We're doing right, but we're left to fight...
But we're left to fight...
