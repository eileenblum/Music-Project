Damned to hide, doomed to creep
Close your eyes, I'll let you sleep
Could be a dream, just a nightmere
The less you know, the more you fear

Death for you is a gift from me
I decide on when to set you free
You will learn to love what I offer
Loving me to make you suffer

For help you'll plea, to no avail
Your blood I'll drink, eat your entrails
You surrender life to let me live
Most precious gift you have to give

As you move on, one thing you'll learn
I'm damned to rot, in hell I'll burn
The pain you feel, compared to mine
Is just a grain in the sand of time

Bloodcult, bloodcult
Bloodcult, bloodcult

Let it flow...

Precious juice, nectar for me
I must prey upon, never free
The day will come, I too shall die
For your redemption my soul will fry

Suffer...

Blood - bloodcult, bloodcult, bloodcult...
Blood - bloodcult, bloodcult, bloodcult...
Blood - bloodcult, bloodcult, bloodcult...
Blood - bloodcult, bloodcult, bloodcult...
