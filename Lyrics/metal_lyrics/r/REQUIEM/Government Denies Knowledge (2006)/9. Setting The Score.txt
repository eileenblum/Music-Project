Weapons, armours, bringers of death
Awaiting the final command
Roaming, searching the fields of blood
Fortune lies in everyones hand
Fighting, dying, on roads of war
Blood and Iron that settles the score
Surviving and telling a bloody story
Paying your price, no guts, no glory

No glory...

Vikings, berserkers from the north
Romans, huns murdered for sports
Spartans, indians weapons now rust
Right or wrong no one judges
Honour, pride, death and glory
Airraid, groundforce roars and fury
Marching the fields on and on
Men never learns til mankinds gone

When ashes rain, power men gain
Death in our hand, innocent lands
Tanks, killing tech, to rape mankind
Only death we'll find

When ashes rain, glory troops gain
Life in your hand, to battle they went
Killed in field without firing a shot
Only death we'll find

When ashes rain, power men gain
Death in our hand, innocent lands
Tanks, killing tech, to rape mankind
Only death we'll find

When ashes rain, glory troops gain
Life in your hand, to battle they went
Killed in field without firing a shot
Only death we'll find

War for mercenaries
Score the bodies buried
Coffins sealed with blood
Afterworld filled with guts

Setting the score...
