Two sides, one heart, one soul
Fighting to keep control
Observing the beasts within
Transforming to something

Seductive liquids running down
Beasts and demons all around
For so long I followed this trail
My own downfall it will prevail

Destiny lies within the mind
No change (what's to) come for future time
Glance at visions of my past
The weak of mind will never last

Two sides within, what have I become
What have I done, out of control
Lost my heart, my mind, my soul
Within, within, within... two sides within

What have I become
What have I done, out of control
Lost my heart, my mind, my soul
Within, within, within... two sides within

Catched within what I'm used
Missed to learn the right to choose
No decisions by what I feel
Look through my lie deny what's real

Seductive liquids running down
Beasts and demons all around
For so long I followed this trail
My own downfall it will prevail

Destiny lies within the mind
No change (what's to) come for future time
Glance at visions of my past
The weak of mind will never last

Two sides within, what have I become
What have I done, out of control
Lost my heart, my mind, my soul
Within, within, within... two sides within

What have I become
What have I done, out of control
Lost my heart, my mind, my soul
Within, within, within... two sides within

Lost my heart, my mind, my soul...
