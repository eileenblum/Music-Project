Please don't take it any further, right now
I can't see anything clearly anymore, heads down
Now love it how could I have thought of
You and I here in the same space
Shame on you we're full of hatred
I cannot, I can't remember

THOSE THINGS ARE NOT OVER JUST YET,
Right now
Just hope you're right, just to prove me, prove me

IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY
I can see the future
I CAN FEEL THE SCISSORS
You can see the future
You can taste the freedom.
