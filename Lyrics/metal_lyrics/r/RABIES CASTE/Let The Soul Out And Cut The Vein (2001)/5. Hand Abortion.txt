Into the void people are born
With no feelings starting their lives

Now I change that
UNDER THE SKIN INJECTING THE NEEDLE
What has been pure now just needless

Now I change that
And you stay dead
Only just few will not survive

Keeping down my head
Whenever it falls
Looking back at the times
When it was all fine
Keeping down my head
Whenever IT FALLS
Looking back at the times
When it ALL WENT WRONG

Now I change that
And YOU STAY DEAD
Now I change you
And I am still there.
