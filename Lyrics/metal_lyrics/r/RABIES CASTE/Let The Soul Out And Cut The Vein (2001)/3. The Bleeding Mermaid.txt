I abused you when had the time
Never saw it on your face
Reconstruction in your own words
I didn't mind losing you

YOU KNOW YOU NEVER COULD BE MINE
Such good times looking into your eyes
As you died in my arms

Becoming sober and it's clear that
There's nothing left for me here
Reconstruction in your own words
Never dreamt of anything less

I FEEL I FOUND IT
I TRUST I HATE IT
I long to hear you kill your lies
Now I feel so haunted as I search for
Any excuse that will ease my mind.
