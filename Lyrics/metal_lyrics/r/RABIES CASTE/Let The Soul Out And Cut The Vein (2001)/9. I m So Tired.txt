Watch out, now you better take it
I saved your life when it was shit
Against me there's no one standing
I saved you when you were not here

I AM SO TIRED NOW

Watch me, now you'll never make it
I saw when you were my enemy
Against me there's no one standing
I saved you when you were not here

What do you know, I've been fallen slow
Smelled like shit cannot stand it
YOU KNOW I WON'T FEEL THAT AGAIN
YOU KNOW I WON'T FALL DOWN AGAIN

What do you know I've been fallen slow
Smelled like shit I cannot stand it
I can't stand my own breed
And I can't stand my own blood.
