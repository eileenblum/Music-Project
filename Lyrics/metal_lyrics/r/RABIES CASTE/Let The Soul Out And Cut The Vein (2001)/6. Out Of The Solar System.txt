I said NOT NOW so that's over
In your black eyes I see sorrow
Not that I don't respect your choice
Just mine has been so damn different

I see that you could but not too high
Instead of me you chase to die
I can't tell you how sorry I am
Unable to talk between you and I

So deep diving so hard trying
To get back home in time for you
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE REALISTIC
Just too much of pleasure in life

I won't call anytime
RIGHT BELOW WITH THE KNIFE
I won't call anytime
Right below I want you to leave
Now you're gone.
