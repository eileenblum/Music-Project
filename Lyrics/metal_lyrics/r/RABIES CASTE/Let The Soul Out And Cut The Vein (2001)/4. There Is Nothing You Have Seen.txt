Your soul you showed me now
Against my will to break my pride
To pay the price

I do not like it when everything is crushing under the PRESSURE of it
When we are talking about or lives
It makes me wanna START THE ENGINE AND DRIVE

Do not like it when everything's
Falling apart under my feet
Really nothing you've seen so far
IN THE FUTURE WORSE THINGS TO COME.
