Everyone's opinion affects me
Listen to all the people who try to be
Closer to what I am
Where the hell were they when I needed them

NEVER COMING BACK FROM THIS PLACE
Never coming back here again
Trying so hard to understand
What I've been through all those years

Then everyone will say I don't support you
The possibilities are not expanded
HOW MUCH LONGER WILL IT LAST
You and I and them it's so good to be half dead

When everything has fallen apart
Broken pieces in the mud.
