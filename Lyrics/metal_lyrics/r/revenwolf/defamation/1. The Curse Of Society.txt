Son of bitch...

When the system start to beginning
Can you feel the disaster will start
Look at them...who makes some parties
And fight each other

When we remember that
We know their fucking word,
We can't stand anymore
Fight....!!

Everything we'll do more than this

Opportunities arrange for you to take
But how can we do that cause
Some rich men fight by their money
How can societies can live freely

Fuck them all....

How can we fight
We fight them now
Without we fighting
(We remember that we don't need you)

Nothing left
So far away
(Go....)

When we remember that
We know their fucking word,
We can't stand anymore
Fight....!!

Everything we'll do more than this

Opportunities arrange for you to take
But how can we do that cause
Some rich men fight by their money
How can societies can live freely

Fuck them all....

How can we fight
We fight them now
Without we fighting
(We remember that we don't need you)

Nothing left
So far away
(Go....)

The curse of socity
The curse of socity
The curse of socity
The curse of socity

When the system start to beginning

Son of bitch....
