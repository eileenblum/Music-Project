Leaves fall again, carrying remembrance of a lost season,
of summertime, when leaving was easy...
Back then, when my orchard was in bloom,
I had a time of my life.
Those times when we walked together made sense of us all.
We were walking towards trees,
with those same fears that we have today.
We forget that time shall pass, and leaves shall rot,
and our hearts shall yearn.
In my dreams the enamoured ones shall forever beseech for solace like underwood after summer aroused and yearning for its leaves.
Sarah, my orchard withers while beauty of yours blossom even in fall.
