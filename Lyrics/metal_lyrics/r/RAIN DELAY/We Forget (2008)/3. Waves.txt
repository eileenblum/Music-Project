Rain...Innocent smiles of a life, a ghost waved a melted eyes,
Inner voices turned to roaring, lengthening the railway of pain,
Like a flower in a trodden sand,
ripped by ash coloured waves and smashed over the stones of human emptiness.
I couldn't give you life, so i gave mine.
Rain fell within a moment, each drop i have felt.
we are drinking rainwater, together again.
