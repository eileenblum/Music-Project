Bridges smiled at their innocence, the night whispers to
the river painting it lively.
Resounding water under
stopped me from breathing frailness.
Holding the amulet,
grace found in warmth within.
I heard a hiss from a fissure,
an exhalation from a hazy ingress.
It was my hidden heart.
Where is the entrance of emotion's realm?
Down the river it flows.
