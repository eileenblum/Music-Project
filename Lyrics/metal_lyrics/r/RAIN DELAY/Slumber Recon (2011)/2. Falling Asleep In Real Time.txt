Severely sleep deprived I wandered out,
already infamous like Caravaggio.
Entire city of vermin is beneath us.
No night out!
There are just too many people I donât want to see.
How badly depraved these nights can be?
With just too many people, I donât talk anymore.
I would rather fall asleep behind the steering wheel,
but I wonât let it go.
