Youâre the sight for my soar eyes.
A thousand words gathered,
but none of them right when it gets spoken.
Words empty like an office,
the same one where Iâve been
judging your flawless rÃ©sumÃ©.
Don't just pass me by.
It wouldn't kill you to try.
Selena, I demand your answer.
What separates us is only one wall, but
even that white wall is the world in whole.

Samo jedan zid nas deli,
ali i taj zid beli, svet je celi.
