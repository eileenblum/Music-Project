Kevlar helmet barely holding,
flattened tires keep on rolling.
Airport City / Delta City / Inner City
Inner city, afternoon, assault on the vehicle
that only one man could bear.
Hummer pierced through the Central Square.
Father, do you remember the poem that I wrote
the day you thought that I went mad?
Time to remove the catheter, time to live again.
âCause morrow, it will be one on one,
and morrow, it will end up on the ground,
with a flawless submission.
