I thought they wouldnât shoot you if we were together.
We ignored the curfew, ran through ruined buildings,
something has passed me by, before my hungry eyes.
They are getting closer. I wonât deny
that the bridge is falling, as hope dies for us now.
As much as we cherish each otherâs poems
the orbital path was just too vast.
Now, together, we are running for something second best.
She took a headshot. My heartbeat, a blast beat,
was strong enough to assassinate.
