[originally by Mourning Beloveth]A figure of despair staring into the nothingness, lost among life suckers. So
Small standing by the ocean sensing the rain, worn out from grieving through
a storm of rage. I have succumbed to sorrow, the hoary darkness and the
all-consuming silence, for I had such hopes and dreams, dreams that fell like
vapours throug the summer air. I had such thoughts, thoughts that would crush
mountains and blunt the very daggers to my heart and yet the mere sliver of
hope sent to the corner to be lost among life's pain.... immortal. My bones
are weary; weary from this malignant mortality we hold on to with such grim
despair that it becomes all-consuming.
