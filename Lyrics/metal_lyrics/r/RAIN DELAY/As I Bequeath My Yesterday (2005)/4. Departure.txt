Time is irrelevant when the weather is changing,
As my erst beloveth tears this soft and blackened haze.
My olde swan waits, circling on his runway,
Loch is reflecting my tear and his readiness for flight.
Come, embrace me, and give me a last kiss.
Forever remain here, I shalt never forget thee.
As the first snow is falling, I bewail our first acquanitance.
Thus thy eyes art so tearful of care my fears art still there.
As the first snow is falling, we art hiding each other's tears.
Those tears art reflected no more,
The loch is now painted in white.
My empress, I was thy raven
Above the chateau, under thy own burthen.
Under thy burthen of insignificance I flee.
I flew, and I carried it away.
I might be late for the wake. I might be late for the burial as well.
Come, embrace my desire to depart.
Oh beloveth, wither thy forecast.
Morning, hearken to my dirge. Yester eve was mournful enow.
Bon soir tristesse, je me suis rtourne. La silense, la nuit.
Un jeun artyr, un belle fille et le seraphin de desire
Attendent la permission pour voyage.
Scorn breaks through tears and sorrow.
Spleen in me takes bitterness through the storm,
Into the waves of cold bitterness,
Into th enorthern fields of winter.
Cold swarm is flying over mountains.
Towards north I depart, swarming with birds.
The weather is changing.
