Embraced by dark, in the night-sky, thou fade.
Influenced by loss, I am falling into agony.
Black swan shivers on the verge of this black lake,
Infinite burthen broke his wings. Imo pectore. incantesimo.
Influenced by clarity of the sky.
A seraph died away from my eyes.
Autumn, the season of melancholy...
While leaves and rain art falling, I am falling into thee.
Autunno, stagione di malinconia...
Come le foglie et le pioggie cadono, anch'io cado per te.
Imo pectore. Voglio mio angelo.
Now I can remember, that dawn after.
Swans wing is healed, but where is that last rain?
It's not even there.
Memories passing by, and through this void called life,
Now I am desperate, I need thy love.
