Before diluvium, in this season frostbitten,
North wind caresses a dead willow.
Glacial period reigns, overtakes my heart
With miserable whiteness ad scornful cry.
I met the Empress Judith one day;
She seemed so flawless in my sffection.
But as the seasons changed, I accepted her imperfections.
Enthroned by emptiness, frozen tears she cried.
Nevertheless our enchantment never died.
This path is cold. I falleth with envy and bitter lust...
My encounter with an angel
Engaged thousands of crows and ravens.
Constructing a circle around me and cleansing the sky.
Thou art a widow. thy cry is scornful and dead.
Empress of emptiness, thou art dethroned. Farewell...
Eternal winter, intercept our arrival,
Arrival of a hearse into thy renaissance.
As I thou could, as if I care.
