In your life was no tenderness, oh no
Never a sunrise without fear
Nasty violence is your breakfast
And death will be your holy communion
You learned to fight, you learned to kill
But no one showed you how to cry

[Chorus:]
Taste the bread of charity
Between hell and poverty
Which he's fighting through

Where did you come from, where do you wanna go?
You brought diaster wherever you went

Now you're gambling with the law
But you don't care anymore
Where have you hidden your soul?
Cause no one can help you anymore
