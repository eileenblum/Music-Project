I saw strange friends dying in vain
Dressed in blood red robes
Only id-tags will remain
Nobody asks why they fought

Now I'm standing here not alone
In the middle of the battlefeild
The smell of blood still in my nose
But my eyes can't see enemies

It's hard to understand
Why do we kill each other, friend
When I look into your eyes I see myself and cry

[Chorus:]
Why do our children cry for us
When we children kill
And women rape, without any hate
Cause they tell us: "Dig your grave"
He softly whispers

They tells us this war is right
We must kill each other on this night
Slaughter friends like animals
There is no way back from hell

It still angers me when they tell us
We're the only who have that right
Is it luck, a chance or fate
That we stand here still alive

It's hard to understand
Why should I shoot you, friend
When I look into your eyes I see myself and cry
