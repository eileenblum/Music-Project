I know the future will become past
But I will give my very best
To make my life really strong
Ain't no doubt tomorrow has come

[Chorus:]
Lord, tell me how
Which way I have to go
An answer to my prayers
Before I come home to you

Who knows what tomorrow will bring
Maybe some answers, it's all in the asking
Which path the right one's to go
