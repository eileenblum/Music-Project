We won't see horizons
Behind the wall of doom
Won't find any guidance
Much too late for illusions

Everything we did with carelessness
Pollution is what we pass on

[Chorus:]
Don't lay your heads deep down in the ashes
Or float in the stream of vagueness
Cause we can't hold on, hold on any longer
Or else mankind must die, there'll be no goodbyes

Searching for solutions
See the visions clear
Disaster is heading our way
Oh we just don't really care

Let stare problems right in the eyes
Our globe needs more than help

We're all guilty: Because of pollusion
Acid rain, green-house effect, atomic-tests
We're not immortal
We don't need the lies of politicansh
