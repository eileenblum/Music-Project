[Japanese bonus track]

I wanna feel when your time is over
I won't see tears in your soul
You can't accept there are different ways
You're too proud to cry

Yeah, he thinks he's so clever
But I know he's a mean guy
Words of wisdom but nothing said
Stay on your soil!

[Chorus:]
All I want, let it go
Or you'll be stricken bound
You can run and you can hide
Break away

Surrender your ego, release your mask
Don't tell me lies when the truth is clear
You'd better watch you don't loose face
Hold it right there

Break away

You've been spinning lies too many times
Why don't you give it a rest
You don't have to find another reason
Your lies I see in your eyes

You close the door and keep the world outside
You don't mind at all
If there's a God or any kind of justice
Just turn yourself and drop your blinder
