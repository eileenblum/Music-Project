They tell me what's wrong and what's right
They tell me to stop and to hide
They know everything better than me
Even much better than me

They think they're so clever and smart
They don't care to break my heart
They'd better take one last look before I disappear

[Chorus:]
I like to fly, higher and higher
No more disguise, escape from hellfire
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
I'll never forget what you've done (to me)

They injure my passion and pride
Which passes on painful delight
The trail I tread left or right
Too faraway from their own way

Why can't you give me a chance?
No reason to misjudge my competence
The goal which I personally strive for
Wouldn't impress you at all
