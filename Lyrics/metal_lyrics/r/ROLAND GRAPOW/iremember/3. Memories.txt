[Grapow]

When I grew up, long long time ago
All the music sound about peace and love
Everybody seemed so groovy and high
But behind the curtain they couldn`t realy fly

What I needed in all those young years
To make up my mind and from up my ears
Was this music which helped a lot
I have these tunes still in my head

[Chorus:]
Release all your feelings
When you hear these old songs
Now it's time for memories
I like to hold on, on my dreams, my old dreams

A joint in my left, flowers in my head
Send a time- machine to bring back these fine times
A guy with afro-look played this axe like hell
Influenced me really so much and he burned them 
As well

Now I'm here, without fear
I don't wanna listen to that grunge crap here
If you're a kid make me up your mind
Open your eyes don't be blind

[Chorus]

Now I'm here, without fear
I don't wanna listen that grunge crap here
If you're a kid make me up your mind
Open your eyes don't be blind

[Chorus]
