[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Roland Grapow]

Hear that thunder die away
I wouldn't wonder if somebody screamed
Nice and slowly 'till the end
Crashing bones and a smell of burning skin 

Open your heart for a holy land
Mankind will lose control
If you just hide under government
Nobody will reach for more
'Till the end 

Creating creatures manipulate DNA
Nothing natural, that's what the future will be
Silicon standard for synthetic girls
That's what we need like our atomic world 

Open your heart for a holy land
Mankind will lose control
If you just hide under government
Nobody will reach for more
'Till the end
'Till the end 

[SOLO]

Open your heart for a holy land
Mankind will lose control
If you just hide under government
Nobody will reach for more 

Open your heart for a holy land
Mankind will lose control
If you just hide under government
Nobody will reach for more
'Till the end
'Till the end
