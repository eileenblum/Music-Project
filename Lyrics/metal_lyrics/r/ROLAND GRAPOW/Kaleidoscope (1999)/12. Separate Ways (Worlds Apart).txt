[Music: Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain]
[Lyrics: Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain]

Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground I'm reaching for you, you, you 

Feelin' that it's gone can change your mind
If we can't go on to survive the tide
Love divides 

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways 

Troubled times
Caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain 

If you must go I wish you love
You'll never walk alone, take care my love
Miss you love 

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways 

[SOLO]

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you 

I still love you girl
I really love you girl
And if he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
No, no
