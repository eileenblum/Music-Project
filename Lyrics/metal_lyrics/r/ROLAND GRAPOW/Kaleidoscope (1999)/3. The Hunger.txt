[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Michael Vescera, Roland Grapow]

Come on everybody, can you feel the fire
Burning up inside your soul, feeding your desire
Oh, you've got to understand everything we need
A rhythm of your heart and the hunger for the beat 

Feel the heat, can't you see
Every note you much higher
Feel it creep, it's so deep
Only you can raise it higher 

Taken no prisioners giving a way
Feeling the strength as your fears slip away
Paying the price of the power that fills you inside
Loneliness crying from deep in your soul
It's giving you hope while you're losing control
No chance in fighting, you must let this feeling go 

Come on everybody, I hope you wanna hear
If you do you've got to let my feelings touch your ear
Don't run away from this tune, you ain't hypnotised
But I hope you have some fun without a compromise 

Feel the heat, can't you see
Every note you much higher
Feel it creep, it's so deep
Only you can raise it higher 

Taken no prisioners giving a way
Feeling the strength as your fears slip away
Paying the price of the power that fills you inside
Loneliness crying from deep in your soul
It's giving you hope while you're losing control
No chance in fighting, you must let this feeling go 

[SOLO]

When I see you standing there in the dark
You're wearing my soul in your eyes and your heart
Beware, feel me crawl under your skin
Beware, now the fantasy can begin 

Taken no prisioners giving a way
Feeling the strength as your fears slip away
Paying the price of the power that fills you inside
Loneliness crying from deep in your soul
It's giving you hope while you're losing control
No chance in fighting, you must let this feeling go
Let it go
