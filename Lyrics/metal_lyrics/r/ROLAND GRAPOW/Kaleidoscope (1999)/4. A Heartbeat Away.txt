[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Roland Grapow]

Just turn around, look what you see
So many memories
You lived your life as sun melts the ice 

Live for yourself if you believe
You can do what do you want, don't get lost in a dream 

We're never falling apart
Won't see tears dry in the wind
I'll show you things that you never really knew 

Heaven is just a heartbeat away
Every day, every night, every moment
We all need friends just let people see
Open your hands, open your heart, open your feelings 

Self confidence is the key to choose
Don't be proud make up your mind
Flying in the stray of an ocean wind 

Clouds are stalking, don't hesitate
Troubles seem like they never will end 

Anytime you need a friend
Even if you are miles away
Remember, I'll be there to guide you home 

Heaven is just a heartbeat away
Every day, every night, every moment
We all need friends just let people see
Open your hands, open your heart, open your feelings 

[SOLO]

Remember, I'll be there to guide you home 

Heaven is just a heartbeat away
Every day, every night, every moment
We all need friends just let people see
Open your hands, open your heart, open your feelings
