[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Roland Grapow]

I don't need a helping hand from some like you
Even if I slip away and tumble
All the lies you told me on and on
Behind your mask is really something wrong 

Now I believe in my own way
Please let me go, why should I stay?
You should see my sign which is your desire
If not you must walk on fire 

Please don't tell me your view 'bout what's wrong or right
Do you really know what's going on?
Rest in peace and walk away from my side
If you need a real friend buy a dog 

Now I believe in my own way
Please let me go, why should I stay?
You should see my sign which is your desire
If not you must walk on fire 

Walk on
Walk on fire
Walk on
Walk on fire 

[SOLO]

Now I believe in my own way
Please let me go, why should I stay?
You should see my sign which is your desire
If not you must walk on fire 

Walk on
Walk on fire
Walk on
Walk on fire
Fire, fire
