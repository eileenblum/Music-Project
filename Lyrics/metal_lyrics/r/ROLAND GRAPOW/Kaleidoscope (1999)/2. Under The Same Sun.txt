[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Roland Grapow]

Lost horizon, the sunlight is rising
Souls are lifting only dreams
Wake up to our painful reality
Don't go closing up your mind 

I don't care if you are black, red, white or brown
We reach for a better world to become
Feels like balancing on the edge of a knife
So start to give in, don't discard your life 

Go ahead with your dream for what it's worth
We all living together under the same sun
Fading shadows one by one like a wheel of fortune
Yes, we're all living together under the same sun 

When a child is born into this world
It has no care which colour to wear
I assume the reason that pushed us to change
No big difference we're all the same 

Be honest today, believe in yourself
Raise your head, don't give up, you'll find the way
There's some kind of madness still in your eyes
If you don't let it go it should be your demise 

Go ahead with your dream for what it's worth
We all living together under the same sun
Fading shadows one by one like a wheel of fortune
Yes, we're all living together under the same sun 

[SOLO]

Go ahead with your dream for what it's worth
We all living together under the same sun
Fading shadows one by one like a wheel of fortune
Yes, we're all living together under the same sun 

Go ahead with your dream for what it's worth
We all living together under the same sun
Fading shadows one by one like a wheel of fortune
Yes, we're all living together under the same sun
Yes, we're all living together under the same sun
Yes, we're all living together under the same sun
