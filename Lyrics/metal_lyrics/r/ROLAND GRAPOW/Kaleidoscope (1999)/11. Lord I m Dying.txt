[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Michael Vescera, Roland Grapow]

Since I've been gone
I haven't seen you far too long
I'm missing so much, missing your touch
Take me back to your lovin' 

I waited for so long
Now I can't remember
Bad memories are gone 

Take me home back where I belong
I've been dreaming 'bout it much too long
I can't wait no more not another day
Lord I'm dyin' 

Time's healing all the wounds
The scares you left can't be gone too soon
Leaving behind, tryin' to find
The one and only way back to you 

We've wasted so much time
We shouldn't wait forever
Our love is on the line 

Take me home back where I belong
I've been dreaming 'bout it much too long
I can't wait no more not another day
Lord I'm dyin' 

[SOLO]

Take me home back where I belong
I've been dreaming 'bout it much too long
I can't wait no more not another day
Lord I'm dyin' 

Take me home back where I belong
I've been dreaming 'bout it much too long
I can't wait no more not another day
Lord I'm dyin' 

Oh, Lord I'm dyin'
