[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Roland Grapow]

In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your schemes
You might need something better that you can hold on to 

We're all riders of this train
You can't shut off risk and pain
Look where we stand, it slips away 

If this world is wearing thin and you're thinking of escape
You always think you can't win but it will never be too late 

Reach for something higher
Don't follow your desire
Don't waste your time for another goal
You wouldn't sell your soul 

When your pride is on the floor
I'll leave you begging for more
You'd better hope that you'll be safe 

Don't think you will understand
'Bout the lies you are dreaming
You'd better hope that you're gonna wake 

You will find uncertain signs, please don't wait holding on too long
Why should you waste another time 'cause you're gonna rise so strong 

Reach for something higher
Don't follow your desire
Don't waste your time for another goal
You wouldn't sell your soul 

[SOLO]

You will find uncertain signs, please don't wait holding on too long
Why should you waste another time 'cause you're gonna rise so strong 

Reach for something higher
Don't follow your desire
Don't waste your time for another goal
You wouldn't sell your soul 

Reach for something higher
Don't follow your desire
Don't waste your time for another goal
You wouldn't sell your soul
You wouldn't sell your soul
You wouldn't sell your soul
