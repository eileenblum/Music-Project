[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Roland Grapow]

When I saw you the very first time
I couldn't take my stare away from you
The eyes of a cat, lips of seduction
Wind blows your hair, like gloomy haze 

Feeling of immunity in a web of emotions
Was our philosophy, you know what I mean
Pictures of the glory days I haven't seen in a long time
Time locked the door and stole the key 

Angel face, my angel face
Please tell me where's the answer, I'll hold a sign, it says
Angel face, no more faith
'Cause without any answer is our love like a flower on grave 

You won't find an open sealing
Your love is a barricade of steel
My heart is filled with daydreams
To return to our love battlefield 

Tears won't dry, hate won't deny, this might be the ending
Deception spins around, you know what I mean
No more trust and no more pain in this hopeless circle
I will rise and you will fall 

Angel face, my angel face
Please tell me where's the answer, I'll hold a sign, it says
Angel face, no more faith
'Cause without any answer is our love like a flower on grave 

[SOLO]

I never will forget the end
I'll never say good bye
Destiny set us free, oh 

Angel face, my angel face
Why don't we hear the answer before emotions fade away
Angel face, my angel face
Please tell me where's the answer, I'll hold a sign, it says
Angel face, no more faith
'Cause without any answer is our love like a flower on grave
