[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Roland Grapow]

Like a little child in a sand box
We're all diggin' much too low
Next millennium will pay the price
We found disaster already now 

Count every minute before time is over now
Hear every second like a heartbeat of your soul 

Wrath of the night hear that crying
Nobody cares, we live in a kaleidoscope
Too many times we missed the warning
We need a chance or this human race won't have a hope 

The chance we had won't come back once more
Lord, tell me why we choose this way
'Cause the end is ready to go
No way out and no control 

Count every minute before time is over now
Hear every answer before we have to go 

Wrath of the night hear that crying
Nobody cares, we live in a kaleidoscope
Too many times we missed the warning
We need a chance or this human race won't have a hope 

[SOLO]

Count every minute before time is over now
Hear every answer before we have to go 

Wrath of the night hear that crying
Nobody cares, we live in a kaleidoscope
Too many times we missed the warning
We need a chance or this human race won't have a hope 

Wrath of the night hear that crying
Nobody cares, we live in a kaleidoscope
Too many times we missed the warning
We need a chance or this human race won't have a hope
