[Music: Roland Grapow]
[Lyrics: Michael Vescera, Roland Grapow]

You've been caught in time
In a haze of shattered dreams
So lost and paralysed
You can't shake off this disease 

You don't know, you won't show any kind of true emotions
Why should we waste our time you throw away 

What a fool, you're too cruel
I'm mesmerised, you're such a tool
What twisted lies that you are living in
Just wake up, are you blind
Try to be a little kind
You might just find it's in you're hands the hidden answer too 

Now take one good luck
At yourself and you might see or you'll see
What are you waiting for
Oh, now it just may set you free 

We don't know how to show you this kind of true emotions
How could you waste our time another day 

What a fool, you're too cruel
I'm mesmerised, you're such a tool
What twisted lies that you are living in
Just wake up, are you blind
Try to be a little kind
You might just find it's in you're hands the hidden answer too 

[SOLO]

We don't know how to show you this kind of true emotions
Why should we waste our time you throw away 

What a fool, you're too cruel
I'm mesmerised, you're such a tool
What twisted lies that you are living in
Just wake up, are you blind
Try to be a little kind
You might just find it's in you're hands the hidden answer
Just try and find it's in you're hands the hidden answer
If you just find it's in you're hands the hidden answer too
