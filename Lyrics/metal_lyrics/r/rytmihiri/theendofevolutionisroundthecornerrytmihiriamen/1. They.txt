They try to put their norms into my head
Fill my mind with their traditions and rules

I'm not so blind
I can make up my own mind

They expect everyone lives and acts the same
From the cradle to the grave

I'm not so blind
I can make up my own mind

They try to impose me shit called fatherland
Saying it's honour to die for your land
They are blinded by the lies
