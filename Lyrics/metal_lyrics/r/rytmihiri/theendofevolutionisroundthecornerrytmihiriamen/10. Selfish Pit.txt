Rumours are waving
Through your mental void

Falling in your selfish pit
Drowning in senseless shit

You talk shit about everybody
And wonder why you're alone

Falling in your selfish pit
Drowning in senseless shit

Selfish pit - Rumours fly
Selfish pit - No one cares
Selfish pit - You're alone
Selfish pit - Friends are gone

No one cares about you
And you're makin' yourself a fool

Falling in your selfish pit
Drowning in senseless shit

The problem is inside of your head
Face yourself and let it end
