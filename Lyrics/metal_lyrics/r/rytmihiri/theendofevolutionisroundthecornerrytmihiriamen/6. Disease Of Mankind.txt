Religion is the disease of mankind
Destroys the difference and makes you blind
Jesus, Muhammed they're all the same
Just want to make people their slaves
Religion is the disease of mankind
Destroys the difference and makes you blind

I don't need some ghost to rule my life
I don't need their saving lies

God's weapon in your hand
You got right to conquer another land

I don't need some ghost to rule my life
I don't need their saving lies

If you will die in the holy war
In paradise you rest in peace forevermore

I don't need some ghost to rule my life
I don't need their saving lies

Fuck your Jesus can't you see it through
All the want is just to fool you
Take away your money and waste your life
They won't give up until the day you die
