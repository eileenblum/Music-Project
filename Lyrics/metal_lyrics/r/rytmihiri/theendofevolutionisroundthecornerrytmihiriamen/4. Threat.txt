Do we still have to tolerate
This all the time growing fascist threat

Resist fascism 'til it destroys you

Are we blindly going to accept
Propaganda they make and try to brainwash our heads

Resist fascism 'til it destroys you

Remember what happened 50 years ago
This time the whole world will blow
Are we going to let 'em ruin our world
Never again no more
