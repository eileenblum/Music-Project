I can see mankind
Leading earth to destruction

How much longer
Can we rape mother nature

Polluting the air by chemicals
Poisoning the waters by toxic waste

How much longer
Can we rape mother nature

How much more do we need
This standard of living, welfare energy

How much longer
Can we rape mother nature

Is it too hard to remember
What happened in Tshernobyl
