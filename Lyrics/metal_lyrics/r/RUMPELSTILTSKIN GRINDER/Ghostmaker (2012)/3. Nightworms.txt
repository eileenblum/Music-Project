Worms shall spread
Making everyone rad
Possess their souls
Out of control!
Making them rock
Making nerds cool
Giving them tattoos
Of upside down crosses
Out of the tombs

Come the wormspawn
The larvae are hatching
Slimy and thrashing
The worms take you over
And spread our infection
Headbanging rocking
Brutally moshing

Burning their bibles
Smashing their glasses
Read the necronomicon
Other books are for geeks
Replacing your class
With cock rocking sleaze
Weak become strong
With worms in their brains

Who shall become the host
For the next spawning
She needs to be hot
Writhing upon the wretched stone
Impregnate the goddess

Mount her and fill her with satan's spawn
The larvae will fill her womb
And the birth will the fucking gnarly
Nightworms come to me
Nightworms do my bidding
Nightworms fucking rock
Nightworms upside down cross
Black worms of blight

Abominable spawn
Decrepit tunneling parasite
The carriers are fed upon
Black worms of bile
Misery to be known
Festering the viral
Out of the tombs

Come the wormspawn
The larvae are hatching
Slimy and thrashing
The worms take you over
And spread our infection
Headbanging rocking
Hail fucking satan
