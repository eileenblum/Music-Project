Clinging to my life I'm lost in the desert
I'm sore from dehydration
If I don't find water I'll die
I catch a roadrunner and I snap it's neck
I eat it raw, it's blood quenches my thirst and hunger
Days pass I find another but an owl swoops down and grabs it
I needed that you asshole my hunting skills aren't good
Cracking open cacti and drinking their liquid
The only way I've managed to stay alive
What's this oasis I see the distance
Could it be salvation or just a delusion

Flickering light I hear chanting
It sounds like a king of ceremony
As I walk down the hill I see figures
Dancing around a fire
Surely they can't be human
Some sorts of wretched goblins
I see that they are startled
Because of my drab condition

They bring me back to my health
And tell me take time to rest
In order to assimilate
I must commit initiation

The ceremony a hallucination
They tell me to continue my journey
I'll be rewarded if I survive
I eat the cactus and continue on
