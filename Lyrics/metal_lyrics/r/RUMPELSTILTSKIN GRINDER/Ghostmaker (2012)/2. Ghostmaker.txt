Cowering before the gaze of the master
All the faithfull bow to the throne
Sound the call for the next execution
Let the price for defiance we known
Ghostmaker, kneel before the conqueror
Oath taker
Ghostmaker, shadow of the righteous one
Slave breaker
The people starve all the children go hungry
As the livestock are cursed with disease
Beggars will crawl, stripped of freedom and pride
Another nation trampled with ease

Now heed the price they all must pay
Watch them tramble at my name
I'm the one the heathens fear the most
Grant no mercy on this day
Hang all â the wretches from the ropes
Feeble penance as they beg
Silently we herd them to the post
Free the last one who remains
Speak of these horrors wherever you go
Seeds of dissension are nurtured with hate
Their steel becoming weaking as the trembling await
Terror reaching farther, it claws at their hearts
Perhaps they will kneel before the battle even starts

Fealty or death
Let them fall to the ground
To demand and behold
Groveling from the proud
Those who would flee
In their fear will be found
Extreminate
They'll be meat for the hounds
Seeds of dissension are nurtured with hate
Their steel becoming weaking as the trembling await
Terror reaching farther, it claws at their hearts
Perhaps they will kneel before the battle even starts

Now heed the price they all must pay
Watch them tramble at my name
I'm the one the heathens fear the most
Grant no mercy on this day
Hang all â the wretches from the ropes
Feeble penance as they beg
Silently we herd them to the post
Free the last one who remains
Speak of these horrors wherever you go
