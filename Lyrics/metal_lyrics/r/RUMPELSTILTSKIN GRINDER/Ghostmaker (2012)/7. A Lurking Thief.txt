The lament of one who preys on others
Cold emotionless lying to myself
I'm convinced what's yours is mine
All I gotta do is shake you down
I peer down the alleyway
Lurking and waiting for my prey
No mercy for anyone I ambush
Make a move and I strike and leave you dead
One walks by and I jump out
Give me what you have and I'll let you live
But to my surprise
They have a weapon sharper that mine

My heart is cold, my blood is cold
No use for honest gold
In silence, I wield the knife
Take what is due for your worthless life

I think maybe i've met my match
A struggle ensues and I'm cut bad
The overzealous defender leaves are opening
I plunge my dagger into this man

For the first time I relate to my prey
I'll grieve this one because he was my peer
I'll be ready next time I face an adversary
I mend my wounds he left a souvenir

My heart is cold, my blood is cold
No use for honest gold
In silence, I wield the knife
Take what is due for your worthless life
