I bleed from countless wounds but i cannot concede my life
Although they can be healed they are toxic from the cowards knife
I tried to slay their lord be the one to set them free
Unchain them from their god rid of all that is holy

I'm going to drag them to hell
My cohorts came to my aid
Chased the assassins away
Not much time to seek them out
And make the ungrateful pay
I traveled from afar, trying to liberate
The peasants were brainwashed

Rules by the tyranny
Since my daring attempt was dissatisfied
I shall convince another to strike after I die
You're all damned now
Oppressed forever
I embrace the agony
For glory I kill

Hunt them down
Take my steel
Feel it's pain
On my path to glory
Bleeding from the countless wounds
But the bastard would not die
With fear the would be murderers
Run and hide
Dripping the vemon
From the poisoned cowards knives
Drag them into ym grave before I die
