Delivery can be a bitch
Who's holding the cards
Who settles the score

It's payback time
You think you pulled one over
On some conniving jackals
You thought we were so gullible
The thief os fooled by scoundrels
You may think you've lead us astray
We'll you've been had
We planned the whole thing
Didn't you think it was a little too easy
You fucked up
You thought it was us, now you're the unsuspecting prey
Try to take advantage and it backfires in your face

Paying the price to underestimate
Your own poison, now you have a taste
What do you think how do you like the treachery
You may think you've lead us astray
We'll you've been had
We planned the whole thing
Didn't you think it was a little too easy
You fucked up
You thought it was us, now you're the unsuspecting prey
You've been had
