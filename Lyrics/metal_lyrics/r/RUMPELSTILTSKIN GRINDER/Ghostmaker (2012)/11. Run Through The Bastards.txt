Running through fields of these fucks
Slashing everyone I see
Blood is shed, the field turns red
Piling up their heads at my feet
Run through the bastards
Slashing with your swords
Killing for satan. Fighting for your lord
I've set out to conquer everything I see
This be a lesson to anyone that defies me

No life after death dominate the world
Take everything I need, religion crushing blasphemy
Kill and crush opposition with my battle swords
I will serve no master, thy satanic warlord

The devil is calling, commands me to kill
Baphomet adorns my shield
Serpent crested blades cut with hate
Fight aside me or you will be slain
Rush them

Piling up the bastards die
As my soldiers cut through the weak
Their army quivers at my sight because
They've been forewarned that I show no mercy
We fight triumphant aside me my soldiers
Run soulless and heartless
Marching not fast enough
That's why we run relentless

Hack them, slash them
Run through the bastards with your swords
Cut them, kill them
Run through the bastards no remorse
Rush them, crush them
Run through the bastards make them fall
Grab them, stab them
Run through the bastards, slay them all

Triumphant in combat
We battle, we fight
My soldiers no mercy
With valour we ride
In battle, we die
For satan we fight
In battle, we die
For satan we fight
