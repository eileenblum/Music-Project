Iron jaw these wimps are finished
Show these chumps fists of metal
Punch anything I fucking see
Because nothing can break me
Blacken your eyes, smash your teeth
You act hard because you're weak
Getting buck with the wrong dudes
Set you straight for acting rude
You can't break my iron jaw
Weaklings take a fucking seat
You can't break my iron jaw
You had better slow your role
Death to posers, death to lames
Hooks and haymakers rain
Against the wall only one way
Inflicting massive pain
Broken bones blackened eyes
Strikes of lightning crack the skies
Heads with hit the concrete
Body slamming these fucking guys
You can't break my iron jaw

No respect for assholes
You're not my fucking bros
Come at me looking strange
Get your face rearranged
Jaw of lead quicker than snakes
Knocking out all these fakes
Take me down I dare you
Fucking up these glass jaw fools
You can't break my iron jaw
