Welcome to the raveyard. This is where I live
All these wandering souls. Never put to rest
These souls will give me strength. I feed upon the dead
This strength is never ending. Because this place is haunted

Listen to my warning. Get the fuck out. This is not the place to be
I have dined of late. But the time approaches. For my slaves to feed me
Stay if you wish. To become a fiend. And you want to join me
I'll try to ward you away. But you can choose to stay. And suffer for eternity

There's no way out now. Help me steal some souls
You can be reborn. Eternal demon spawn

You will help me, attack all the holy. Torture them to madness
I can promise thee. Immortality, you maniac bastard
Stay if you wish. To become a fiend. And you want to join me
I'll try to ward you away. But you can choose to stay. And suffer for eternity

I tried to warn you
Get out of my grave

Tombs as far as the eye can see
Join my minions, become a demon fiend
Death is better than life
Undead. Death is cold
