This is the cult of demon hell
Oh gracious one, grant me the strength
Hail the supreme lord
God of the roaring storm
Arrows will pierce their souls
With flaming eyes and mane
Devil's horns raised high
The destroyer burns with rage

You misfits, maniacs, vortex of bastards
You rampage and decimate voracious lunatics
Phantoms banshee ghouls, ravenous wickedness
The netherealm, kalyptein everlasting punishment

Drink the poison and come with me now
We will transcend the ordinary
Hail the destroyer you abominations
We will not be contained
The devils creations
We're fucking wild
Our attitude ruthless and proud
Only room for the strong
No wimps allowed

You misfits, maniacs, vortex of bastards
You rampage and decimate voracious lunatics
Phantoms banshee ghouls, ravenous wickedness
The netherealm, kalyptein everlasting punishment
Let's thin the heard merauding creeps
Menacing their mortal souls

Awaken of destroyer kvlt of demon hell
Hail the destroyer you abominations
We will not be contained
The devils creations
