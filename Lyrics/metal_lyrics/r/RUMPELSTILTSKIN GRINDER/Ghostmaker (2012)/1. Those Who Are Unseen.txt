You try to flee and you're swarmed
Eclipsed by the condors. Satan's horn
Wings of triumph cover the land
Master of raptors the conquering hand

Speed from the falcons terrain covered by their vision
Our agents of reconnaisance condors scour our dominion
Vultures clean our mess that we leave with our swords
Heaps of our enemies slaughtered by warlords

Soaring, scavenging the remains
Our dark minions forage the land
The cowardice is offset by the falcons will to strike
The inescapable tormentor's hand
When ninjas don't find you the flock of killers will
All seeing spies with ravenous skill
Telepath connection between thief and raptor
Bandits relentless the deadly birds master

Strike attack no escape
Shouldn't have come here
Make then dead, don't relent
A long way from shelter
We don't miss a thing
We have agents that can see
Spying the skies controlled by sorcery

Night vision, owls fuck up your day and your night
Hunted by avian killers on their slaughtering flight
Peck at you like psychos they don't give a fuck
Traps all around come and test your luck
Now you're in the realm of those who are unseen
Protected by condors falcons everything between
You're so fucked now, wow

Strike attack no escape
Shouldn't have come here
Make then dead, don't relent
A long way from shelter
We don't miss a thing
We have agents that can see
Spying the skies controlled by sorcery

When ninjas don't find you the flock of killers will
All seeing spies with ravenous skill
Telepath connection between thief and raptor
Bandits relentless the deadly birds master
Our dark minions forage the land
The inescapable tormentor's hand
