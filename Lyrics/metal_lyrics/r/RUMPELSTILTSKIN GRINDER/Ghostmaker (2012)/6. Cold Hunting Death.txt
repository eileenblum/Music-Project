Crushed by the cold
Winds pierce your soul
The master of the ice blade
Stops at nothing to find you

No way to feel safe
Death approaches faster
Step into my realm
The legend, the ice master
No escaping my staff
Haunted unholy spear
Try to come within my reach
No mortal can come hear
Impenetrable force field
Protects the ghastly lair
Chainmail woven by a specter
And shiled made by a necromancer
Could haunting death
You should not have come here
Trying to find a hidden treasure
A shocking death is near

Treacherous no honor with my actions
A frozen heart commands to blade
Ice brand wielded by the bastard
The lycan ghost none kills faster

Icicles of blood
Ornament my palace my home
Banshees scream in the wind
The souls I have made my own
Ice spirits dance in the sky
Flickering like flames of ice
All victims of the arctic master
The frozen ghosts none kills faster
The smell of ice warns you of your fate
Could haunting death to any who venture
This land is ruled by ghastly phantom
Impaled by the frozen saber
Could haunting death
Ice cold banshee none kills faster
Halberd blessed by the ice lord
Keeps the trenchant thieves at day
Greedy treasure seekers
Unrelenting I will slay

Treacherous no honor with my actions
A frozen heart commands to blade
Ice brand wielded by the bastard
The lycan ghost none kills faster

Daggers are thrown
Frozen sabers cut through the snow
The smell of ice drives me to kill
Brutality no need for any skill

Treacherous no honor with my actions
A frozen heart commands to blade
Ice brand wielded by the bastard
The lycan ghost none kills faster
In this cold haunting death
