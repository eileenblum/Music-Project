Stolen from me, riches fucking sick
Shadows becoming small, find them...
Destroy them all! Fetch backpacks, your flashlights,
We're gonna hunt those demons. It's my own, It's not theirs,
Those sneaky bastards die! Can't find them, Can't catch them,
Out of breath and of patients. There's no use, return now,
There's only one thing left to do...
Unleash the troll! Attention!

Back away! You don't know what he can do...
Back away! On flesh of thieves it will dine.
Fetch 'em over here, bring 'em to my lair... Feed the troll
Fetch 'em over here, bring 'em to my lair... Feed the troll
Fetch 'em over here, bring 'em to my lair... Feed the troll

Fetch 'em over here, put 'em over there... Feed the troll
Fetch 'em over here, better you beware... Feed the troll
Fetch 'em over here, time is drawing near... Feed the troll

Crush huge, hulking monster, you will die!
Smash, squash, desecrate life!
Now you will know... This is my troll!

Now I have 'em here, better you beware... Feed the troll
Now I have 'em here, time is drawing near... Feed the troll
Now I have 'em here, better you beware... Feed the troll
Now I have 'em here, time is drawing near... Feed the troll
