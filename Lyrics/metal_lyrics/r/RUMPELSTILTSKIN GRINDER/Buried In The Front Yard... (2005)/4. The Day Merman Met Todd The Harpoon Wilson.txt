You hear, the merman swampin' around
Grab your ears, look away, try to block out the sound
Then you smell the sludge, see a lifeless shell
Close your eyes, look away, better get up and...

Want to see our world, want to play our game
Knowing that your life is rotting away
Call anyone, even call collect,
Figure out quick what you're gonna do next!

Only the strong survive when you play our game of hit and run
See all the horrors of life when the snake strikes in your eden
Only the strong survive when you play our game of hit and run
See all the horrors of life when the snake strikes in your eden

Want to see our world, try to play our game
Knowing that your life is rotting away

Call anyone, even call collect
Figure out quick, nothing you can do!

You breathe, the smoke into your lungs now
To see what hides beyond the angel's light

Only the strong survive when you play our game of hit and run
See all the horrors of life when the snake strikes in your eden
He grabs you stab he takes a bite, take his life, take this life
He pulls you grab he tears away take his life, take this life

The waves crash down, his hands become clenched
From the harpoon tainted with Poseidon's stench
The disintegrating deck teeters away
Because now he knows, foul things are at play!
