My M1 Abrams marches to the storm
She's got 1,500 horsepower 4,000 in torque
26 ton turrets lock 'em up.
She's a beast... Yeah. Nothing can stop her!

Slip off your armor now... Only if you don't mind
I want to show you how. I'm kissin' you're killin'
I want to take my time. I'm kissin' you're killin'
I want to feel you right

Your life, your life, I've got you in my sight
Tonight, tonight, tonight I end your life
Your life, your life, I've got you in my sight
Tonight, tonight, tonight I end your life

You bring your tank, and I'll ride mine
She'll waste you, I'll bring the wine.

Her skin is smooth and bullet proof
She makes me tremble to the touch
I've got to show her how I feel
My grip gets tighter on the clutch

Drink some diesel, warm you up. Feel my liquid never stop
... Never stop!

It's the hellish screamframe all for you
Squadrons, emblems, branded on me all for you

Slip off your armor now...

Your life, your life, I've got you in my sight
Tonight, tonight, tonight I end your life
Your life, your life, I've got you in my sight
Tonight, tonight, tonight I end your life
