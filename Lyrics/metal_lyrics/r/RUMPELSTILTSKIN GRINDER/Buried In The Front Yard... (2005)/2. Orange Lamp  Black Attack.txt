You creep down streets so dark,
You duck so they can't see you.
Silence, you're wrong you're judged
Terror! The scent gives you away

But then you hear the steps
Behind! You know, you're doomed now
They find you, no escape, orange and black surround you!

You can't run, you can't hide.
You know you won't survive, not this time, not this time!

Orange and black, those who judge tonight.
They are enforcers. They deal judgement for real.

No, we're not fucking around
No, we're not fucking around

No! We're done fucking around!

Run! You can't run! You won't run! Don't you run!

If you run, you'll die tired and scared
They own the streets, own police they're prepared

No, we're not fucking around!
No, we're not fucking around!

Slow!
