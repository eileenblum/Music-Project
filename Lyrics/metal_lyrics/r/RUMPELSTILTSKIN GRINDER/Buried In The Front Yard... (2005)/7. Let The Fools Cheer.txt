Get set, ready to go (Bet's on!)
Track's fast but your horse is slow (Bet's off)
Last call bet's at the door
You can't win, you'll loose, you'll owe

Dropped pass, right at the goal (Catch that!)
Cheat and win 'cause we got no soul (That's sick)
Got a hand in every game you throw
We call the shots we run the show

Let the fools cheer, rape their wallets as they cry
Every bet becomes a loser, don't ask why
Let the fools think all is wholesome with their game.
Every contest you can think of, it's all the same.

Heavyweight, he's on a roll (He's gotta prove)
Got a chance now to win it all (Take his shot)

They don't know the fix is on
We call the shots and down he falls
Game 6 fan in the front row (That bitch)
Crawfished a bet so we bleed him slow (Guy's fucked)
Let his friend and his family know
There's no escape from us we rule!

Let the fools cheer keep them happy day by day
No distraction means no knowledge... How we play
Let the fools just try and stop us, we don't quit
Kill them all to keep our secret, that's no shit!

We're the bookies, you're the prey
Every league does what we say
In control, you can't forget, we're the gods of every bet

Let the fools cheer, rape their wallets as they cry
Every bet becomes a loser, don't you ask why
