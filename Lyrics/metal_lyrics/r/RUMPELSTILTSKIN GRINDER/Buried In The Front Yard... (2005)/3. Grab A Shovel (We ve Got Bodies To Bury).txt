Wake now... Right now
Wake now... Right now!

Waking to see the mess at hand... Last night
Bodies thrown all across the floor... No life
Hours before the shipment's due... Tonight
Figure out what you're gonna do, or tonight you die!

Grab and cut, grab and cut, grab and cut, cut bone!
Tear and saw, tear and saw, bodies to pieces

There's too much blood now, grab your shovels now!
Dig like it's your job, fast or all is lost!
Dig graves for the dead, or you're a corpse instead.

Boss, I'm running away getting away...
No! Get back to work
They're coming today I'm getting away no!
Get back to work

Expert's here, brings plans inside,
To where the bodies should hide...

Buried in the front yard, not the back yard
Buried in the front yard, not the back yard.
