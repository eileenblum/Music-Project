Whiiiir... Once the grinder goes 'round,
First reel was full
Whiiir, whiiir, two times the grinder goes 'round
Second reel was full. Whiir, whiiir, whiiir, three times
the grinder goes 'round, third reel was full.
Whiiir, whiir, whiir, whiiir, four times the grinder goes
'round forth reel was full

Turning all the straw into gold.
Or you will die (Now you will die)

What's in a name? Scarface? No! Bandylegs? No!
Sparerib? No! Turniphead? No! Sloppy Joe? No!
Starscream!!??

But the weather's fine, for tonight
I'll make her child mine, she'll never guess, I won't confess
Rumpelstiltskin is the magic line, line!
Tell me if you don't guess that line,
No, Rumpelstiltskin means you're mine!

Today bake. Tomorrow glad no one knew
Spinnin' 'till the dawn, you toil oh so long
Fingers to the bone, locked in, you slave alone

Can you guess my name? (The Devil has told you that)
Are you that insane? (The Devil has told you that)
Can you guess my name? (The Devil has told you that)
Are you that insane? (The Devil has told you that)

What's in a name? Scarface? No! Bandylegs? No!
Sparerib? No! Turniphead? No! Sloppy Joe? No!
Starscream!!??

Looking like your game, you guessed my name
Looking like your game, come dance around flames

Heed his legend, Rumpelstiltskin... You guessed my name!
