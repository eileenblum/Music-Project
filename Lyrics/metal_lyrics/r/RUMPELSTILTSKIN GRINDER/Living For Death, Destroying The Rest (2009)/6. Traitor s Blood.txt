[*]
We will not be merciful, in this world there is no mercy,
When you broke the ultimate rule
You should have known where it would lead.
This is not simple revenge,
This is justice to the highest degree,
Now you face the consequence,
You must be a fool tried to steal from a thief,

We'll not be merciful!

When you swore into this clan,
You took an oath, a promise of truth,
And when you broke that sacred bond,
You should have known that you would be fucked,
This is a secret society, The true elite and highest of thieves,
And to think you could infiltrate, You know we Kill for nothing,

The traitor's blood shall spill!

[Repeat *]

You'll think "this can't be happening to me",
You should have thought before you turned your back,
As the boiling oil scathes half the hair off your head,
From each direction ice picks pierce your neck.

You'll want to end yourself, But we'll keep you alive,
And make sure that you don't die.

Tortured, Beaten Traitor!

The frigging torture's just begun,
You thought when we stopped, that was the end
Now we'll start with the dismemberment,
You've never seen so much blood

We'll not be merciful!

You'll think "at least I might bleed to death"
That's why your stumps will be cauterised
And, when you think you'll have to use a bag to shit
You'll want to end your feeble life,
You leaked out our cryptic location,
And you created a dangerous breach,
And when you threaten our security,
Your blood will be shed by the clan of thieves

[Repeat *]

We will spill...
TRAITOR'S BLOOD!
