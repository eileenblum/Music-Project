Poisoning their supply
With dust from ancient times,
We'll wash away their minds,
Prepare the soldiers for military lines,
Bring down the righteous blow,
Faces wrecked, motherfuckers get owned,
Bone will break and blood will splatter,
Time to drop the fucking hammer!

Enraged and bloodshot,
Like a pulsing unit they get madder,
They will hit the bottom of the ladder
And I would say these fiends are bloodthirsty
Brutality, Mayhem, no respect,
Carnage of battle, several faces wrecked
Bludgeoned and stomped like scum
Armed with guns, just ghouls and brutal anarchy

[*]
These soldiers have been poisoned into fiends
Pit them against the ghouls, sent into a killing frenzy
Ripped apart, rip the poison from their veins,
Even though they were your peers
Tear apart their souls and fears

We will rip your face apart,
We will stab and rip out your heart
We've been drugged and thrown into rage
Like dogs in the pit, ripped from the cage

I'm dusted up, released into battle, and I'm ready to kill
I see my targets and I kill and kill and kill and kill!

Refracting through prisms in your mind
One thousand points of vicious light
Devils rock and demons roll
Time to kill these fuckin' assholes!

Uppercut the haymaker,
Rock the roundhouse face scraper
War is such a malicious art
Can't tell my friends and enemies apart

[Repeat *]

You will not die in vain, your fate will be avenged!

As tragedy unfolds,
Power in truth it holds,
An end to needless pain,
You will not die in vain!
