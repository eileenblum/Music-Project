Police patrol the streets, Protect and comfort the weak,
Dependence thrown aside, To leave the weak behind,
But beware, it was only a matter of time,
The creeping tendrils of slime, Calling your innocent mind,
Oozing to purify, Now it's time,

Calling you, Know it's true, Join the few,
Thrashing through, Living for death,
Destroying the rest, Now manifesting,

Calling you, Know it's true, Join the few,
Thrashing through, Living for death,
Destroying the rest, Beware the Thrash Brigade!

Now it's time, Calling you, Know it's true,
Join the few, Thrashing through, Living for death,
Destroying the rest, Beware the Thrash Brigade!

So we bleed because we got stabbed in the face,
Disbelief because got stabbed in the throat,
As our blood because we got stabbed in the gut,
Fills the Streets because we got stabbed in the balls,

So we bleed, disbelief, as our blood, fills the streets

Anywhere that you go, it's evil you will find,
So cast your dying hope aside, and leave the weak behind,

Beware the Thrash Brigade!
We are the Thrash Brigade!
Beware the Thrash Brigade!
And we'll stab your face,
Beware the Thrash Brigade,
Stab you in the balls,
Beware the Thrash Brigade
Fucking stab them all!
