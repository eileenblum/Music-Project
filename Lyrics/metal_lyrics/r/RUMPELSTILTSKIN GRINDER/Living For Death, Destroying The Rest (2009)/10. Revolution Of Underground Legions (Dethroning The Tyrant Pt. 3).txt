The soul of this world is gone,
Just a shell of its former self,
No honour is left in this wasteland,
Just a desolate, barbaric hell,
What have we become...?

Selfish fools, No unity involved,
Being trounced by competition,
Unmerited arrogance,
Feeding massive ignorance.

I plead, join me in revolution,
Against your leader, tyrannical monster,
Overthrow this Kingdom of Weakness,
Plant new seeds and rid us of sickness.

Time has come for a chivalrous act,
Every empire eventually falls,
A universe of simpletons and sheep,
Tails between your legs when duty calls.

There's no Greater Crime,
It's the only way for us to stay alive,
Join the revolt or die,
Overthrow this heinous, wretched slime

There's no Greater Crime,
This tyranny makes us outraged, fucking sick,
Join the revolt or die,
Underground Legions,
Start the counter-strike!

There's no greater crime
For you to blindly accept what you've been told,
Join the revolt or die,
Underground Legions,
Start your revolt!

We live from sunset to sunrise,
We retreat when we sense a ray of light,
I can't believe you'd give up freedom
Instead of putting up a fight,
For comfort in a utopia, accept
What's in the middle path.
And never stick your neck out,
Never take a risk, you're afraid of aftermath.

Do you want others to profit from your fear?
Do you want to retreat and cower
When your freedom is so near?
Do you want to live in a world
Spoon-fed and controlled?
Guaranteed an average life,
Just as long as you follow what you're told.

There's no turning back, Once you've chosen a side,
And it will be as if we'd never met,
If we see each other on the front lines,
Displace the brotherly love with hate,
Better protect your fucking neck,
There will be a bloodbath,
No recollection of respect

Do you want others to profit from your fear?
Do you want to retreat and cower
When your freedom is so near,
Do you want to live in a world
Spoon-fed and controlled?
Guaranteed an average life,
Just as long as you follow what you're told.

Forces, our forces must unite,
We will bring a thunderous counter strike
Now's the time, Revolt or Die,
Overthrow this heinous slime!

[*]
There's no Greater Crime,
It's the only way for us to stay alive,
Join the revolt or die,
Overthrow this heinous, wretched slime,
There's no greater crime,
For you to blindly accept what you've been told,
Join the revolt or die,
Underground legions,
Start your revolt!
