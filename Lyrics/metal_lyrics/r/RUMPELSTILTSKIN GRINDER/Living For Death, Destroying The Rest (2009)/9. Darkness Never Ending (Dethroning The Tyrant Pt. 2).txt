This is a world of treachery,
The underground legions are ours,
We'll never give in, Rise to the surface
Spreading your filth across the land of the weak,

This hero tried to stop us
Thwarted by the tyrant,
Most powerful Cyclops,
He is the master of underground legions,
Ruling the hordes of misshapen minions,

Our tyrant, leader, ruling deceiver,
Has controlled our will for years we have served,
Blaspheme to resurrect, and if we neglect,
Punishment, torture and penalties far worse
Harnessing power of ancient demons,
Belphegor, Astaroth, Beelzebub summoned,
Earth will be ours, spreading our wars,
Evil will triumph and blacken the Earth,

Unholy Alliance of foes of past,
A new treaty of villains is borne,
Set to fight the growing hordes of darkness
Revolt, or stay the minions are torn,
Will they join the opposite side?
It's time to turn your back or die
We must be fast, We must be violent!
Else there's no chance to overthrow the Tyrant!

Our plan is unholy war, Our tyrant pleads,
Our soldiers bleed, Our plan is unholy war,
Conquering all, Hammers will fall,
Bludgeoning fools in our way,
Spreading our scum, It shall we done,
Darkness will have a new birth,
Spreading our seeds, fulfilling our needs
We will take over this Earth,

Earth will be ours, spreading our wars,
Evil with triumph and blacken the earth,
Blaspheme to resurrect, and if we neglect,
Punishment, torture and penalties far worse,
Our tyrant, leader, ruling deceiver,
Has controlled our will for years we have served,
Harnessing power of ancient Demons
Belphegor, Astaroth, Beelzebub summoned.

Sound the horns of Fucking War! March!

I'm hearing eaves of rebellion, I will bring pain to any who defy
You will be hung on the crucifix,
Devoured by the vermin of the sewer 'till you die.

Darkness never ending,
Evil never dies.

I, the tyrant, of the sewer have spoken,
And you will obey my command,
Anyone who joins in the rebellion,
Would be a fool to take a stand,

Darkness never ending,
Evil never dies...
