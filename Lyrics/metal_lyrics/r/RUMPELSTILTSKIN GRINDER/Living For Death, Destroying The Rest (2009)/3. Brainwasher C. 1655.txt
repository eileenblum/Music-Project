Century 17: It was a meek yet morbid scene,
The devil, some ghouls and zombie fiends,
They needed some props in this century,
Let's go!

Set the time for 1655,
It's a dangerous trip, let's hope we survive,
Let's go to a time that needs a Kick in the ass,
And rearrange their minds to make them feel alive,

If they frown upon the devil, we can change their mind,
We can use the brainwash to make them one of our Kind,
Our elixir never fails, and it won't this time,
Brainwash a clean slate for everyone's mind.

[*]
Mind erasing scientist,
We call you Brainwasher
Our master plan is genius,
Helping us to spread Satan's word
[Repeat]

Streets of the Vatican, our target in mind,
Our elixir will be used to sway Jesus' Kind,
We'll take down the Christians in the centre of their heart,
Pull out all their roots and make them come apart.

With Satanic science we meddle and toil,
We can raise some hell and make some turmoil,
Before anyone will realise the gloom,
Christianity's finished and Jesus Christ is doomed,

[Repeat * x2]

This is your message,
So remember it,
Praise and hail Satan,
Get wasted as shit!

Worship yourselves!
Worship yourselves!
Worship yourselves!
