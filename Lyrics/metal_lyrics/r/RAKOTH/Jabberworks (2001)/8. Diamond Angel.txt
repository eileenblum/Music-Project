The solitude falls so heavy on me 
And loneliness leaves no salvation Wonderful face 
I desire to see I cannot resist desperation 
But like spark in the dark there's an image inside 
Diamond Angel is coming again 
The memories strike and nowhere to hide 
I'm screaming in pleasure and pain 
Heart of steel is inside of her beautiful chest 
And no kindness - it's just iron will 
And her soul is a diamond, I fall from the crest 
Realizing that love is unreal 
Seeing light of her eyes I cry out her name 
I'm in fever but light is ice cold 
Feeling warmth of her smile I know false is the flame 
And her feelings can't be unfold 
But someone will come... 
And in pain she will drown... 
And desire for her will be real 
And the diamond will break... 
And the steel will melt down... 
And the suffering of love she will feel
