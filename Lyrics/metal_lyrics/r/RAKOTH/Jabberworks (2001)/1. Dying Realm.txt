Far in mountains lies the realm of sorrow 
A dying realm which fate's forever doomed 
Still live today but maybe dead tomorrow 
On blackened sky the shade of Evil loomed 
Dying rivers - no life in empty waters 
Silent lakes where nothing dwells within 
In the canyons the signs of ancient slaughters 
The remembrance that people couldn't win 
The flowers bleeding, trees are dead 
The landscape painted by the mad 
It's always night, there's no sunrise 
No light in kingdom of demise 
Crying widows, young girl mourns for lover 
Grief and sorrow, death is all around 
Soulless bodies, shroud is down to cover 
And no strength to bury them in ground 
There's no birth, just stillborn 
The heart of mother is torn 
Painful groans fill the sky 
All who live want to die 
The realm is dying 
The deadly curse oppresses, preys the land 
Payment for the sins in past 
The sky is crying 
This terror is released by Evil's hand 
The realm will die, the curse will last 
Far in mountains lies the realm of sorrow 
A dying realm which fate's forever doomed... 
Death has come to the land Brought the realm to the end 
Disappearing in gloom 
Suffering ghastly doom
