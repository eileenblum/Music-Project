One Thou, the Risen One, Insurgent Mage 
Who shook the power of gods 
All that you've done, eternal rage It justifies unholy thoughts 
You fight alone - Young Gods are foes 
Defending their Hallowed Land 
You feel so strong, 
Darkness is yours 
Feel there's no need to defend You do everything 
If they ask you for help you help everyone 
You pity their grief, you will not deny Whether beggar or king 
Liken mortal to god, there's no thing that can't be done 
But see their belief - they worship the Lie 
Raise your sword of black in raging flames 
You challenge gods in Hallowed Land 
No turning back, it's not a game 
The reign of lies must come to end 
Your armies vast devour the worlds 
And conquer lands on their way So strong and fast infinite hordes 
It's time for Young Gods to pay 
And the battle's begun 
At the gate of the Land that is Hallowed for all 
Their armies are great, much stronger than yours 
"Outnumbered you're gone 
So prepare for the end, now you'll suffer your fall 
Sealed is your fate - you're out of your force" 
"How dare you, worthless one encroach on holy things 
Rakoth now you'll be gone or slave to Seven Kings" 
"No way, I'll die but free or crush the tyrants down 
My armies cannot flee - they're led by Darkness Crown" 
The Hallowed is trembling, igneous gales 
Summoned from Chaos, incinerate the worlds Lost... 
The battle's lost, you're chained and bound 
Down to the Bottom of Worlds 
Ruined is your host, no fame you found 
Disincarnated by the Lords 
And all returned - no truth, just lies 
And Young Gods rule the worlds again 
But people learnt on your demise 
And your defeat was not in vain 
Free spirit lives on 
And no power for gods to erase it from mind 
The riot after riot, they know no more rest 
Now you're not alone 
Not the slaves but free men can no longer be blind 
The times won't be quiet - your spirit will last
