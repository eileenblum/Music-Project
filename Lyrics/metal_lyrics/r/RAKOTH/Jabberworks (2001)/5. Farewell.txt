Farewell to all, I'm in arms of eternal sleep 
In mourning hall your sorrow for me is too deep 

No feeble thought, you gaze into the void 
Think what you are before the eternity 
Staring with awe yet unbelieving 
The vision before your eyes - the bloodstained flowers... 
An everlasting torment 

Moaning, crying, in flowers body lying 
Rain of tears is pouring from your mourning eyes 
Depression, sorrow, for me there's no tomorrow 
Now you take all pain and grief for my demise 

My coat is shroud and the coffin is my only home 
Don't moan so loud, let me rest, don't make my soul roam 

Blessed are the strong, the strong with spirit 
And grief is supressed by fierce impact 
The flash of insight reveals desire 
To join me within my grave - the godless craving... 
An act of desperation 

Don't cry for me, can't you see - I feel better now 
My soul is free so get near and kiss my cold brow 

And no tears last - the chalice is empty 
Extict the feelings, fear's gone and forgotten 
And in your dream I beckon to follow Come share my afterlife... 
I'll wait
