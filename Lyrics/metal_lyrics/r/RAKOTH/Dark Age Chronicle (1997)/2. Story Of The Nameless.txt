It was the age of darkness.
And Evil ruled all over the land.
And there was the one - He was Evil itself.
He had no name and they called Him - NAMELESS!

He sat on Throne of Gore in the Castle of Ruin
on the Ebony Hill.
And He reigned in blood and terror...

But artifacts of great power were given to people.
And they rose and overthrew Him.
He was banished from the world
and could not find a way back...

But the servants of Him remained,
so remained the ways for Him
to return and restore
His reign of terror...

Nameless... He shall return...
