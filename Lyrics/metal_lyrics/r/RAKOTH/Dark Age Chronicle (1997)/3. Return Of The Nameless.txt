Night, bloody night, such a sacred night
I came to this night through the rivers of blood
The spells I've cast and people I've killed
Left no return so more blood will be spilled

The legend says that He'll rise tonight
And they will see His power and might
They have forgotten that Master's alive
So He will rise and none will survive

Oh what a land, land of joy and sunlight
Such beautiful beings these elves and unicorns
They will die by my hand, enemies that I fight
All the earthly kings I shall crown by the crown of thorns

The reign of terror will fall on earth again
And they will suffer and none shall kill their pain
There's no salvation - Nameless will rise tonight
And when He comes falls the endless night

Rise... Rise... Rise...
I summon Thee back to the earth
To return and punish the traitors
To rule again all over the land
To reign in blood...

"I'm coming"
