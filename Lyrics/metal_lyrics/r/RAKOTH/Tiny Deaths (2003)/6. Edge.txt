Like serpents entangled in faint starlight black seals entwined in crystal gleam
Dark shapes enframed in a myriad of suns
The infinity ends

The past plains of snow the visions of frozen landscapes flow silent yet charming sights of pale serenity

You've chosen the way
Where patterns of frost lead you astray to the glacial crypt of thoughts
Aside and away from inner space you roam afar from sanctuary of morbid self beyond the reason locked in a rotten shell while lost in everlasting sleep
The path that you walk so gracefully paved with icy thorns led you to the realm forlorn

You've chosen the way
Where patterns of frost lead you astray to the glacial crypt of thoughts

To knowledge that made illusion of your existence fade
Never to return
