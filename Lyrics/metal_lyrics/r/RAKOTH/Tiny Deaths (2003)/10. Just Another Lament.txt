Raven the Wise shed your lore onto me
How can I hold my beloved?
The abyss between us, the bottomless sea too wide to fly over... she is mortal...
Silvery crowns of the frostbitten trees sunlight so bright yet so cold
Ravens above me descend heed my pleas carry my cry to the gods to let her live...
War and disaster they took her away dismal is garden of light chaos and emptiness led me astray helpless emotions yet so strong...
Cursed be the life with a heart fool of gloom cursed be the laws of this world
Cursed be the curse my sinister doom the ages without her...what is it all for
Carry my lament all over the plains over the white sylvan realms useless all magic of elven domains to keep us together in this existence...
Raven the Wise shed your lore onto me
How can I hold my bethrothed?
The abyss between us and so let it be I shall follow her... to the afterrealm
