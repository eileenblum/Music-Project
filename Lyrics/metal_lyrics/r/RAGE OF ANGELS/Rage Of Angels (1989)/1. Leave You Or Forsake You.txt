I know you know everything I do, 
And every move I make. 
I feel you sometimes in my sleep, 
But you're gone when I awake. 
I think of you every night and day, 
You're always on my mind. 
And when it gets too hard to take, 
You let me know that you are mine. 

[Chorus #1] 
I'll never leave you or forsake you, 
The words I always hear. 
I'll never leave you or forsake you, 
What does it take to make that clear. 

I feel you standing by my side, 
When I'm walking all alone. 
I hear you talking through my lips, 
About things I've never known. 
The fear I feel inside for you, 
Sometimes is hard to bear. 
But then your love flows through me, 
Letting me know how much you care. 

[Chorus #2] 
I'll never leave you or forsake you, 
On these words you can depend. 
I'll never leave you or forsake you, 
I'll be with you until the end.
