It's been a hard road to travel, 
You know it takes some time. 
To speak what you believe in, 
And make the words to rhyme. 
So listen close to what we say, 
We feel that God's the living truth. 
So let's shout it with conviction, 
And scream it to our youth. 

[Chorus:] 
Let's rock for the rock, 
The one that gives us life. 
Let's rock for the rock, 
The one who's the light. 
C'mon rock. 

The way has not been easy, 
Many walls we had to face. 
But still we keep on striving, 
Towards the one that grants us grace. 
If only you would just believe, 
And realize he died for you. 
He'd come inside your heart today, 
And show you love you never knew. 

[Chorus]
