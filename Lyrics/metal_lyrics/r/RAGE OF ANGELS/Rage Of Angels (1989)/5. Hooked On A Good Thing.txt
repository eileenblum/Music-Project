I don't know how you found me, 
I must have been asleep. 
I've never felt so on fire for someone, 
I've never loved so deep. 
Since you came and made your injection, 
I haven't been the same. 
Your love is like an obsession, 
A fever I can't tame. 

Somehow you knew I was burning, 
You put me under control. 
You took away all the fear in my heart, 
And love has finally taken it's toll. 
Since you cam and made your connection, 
My life has turned completely around. 
You've filled me with your holy affection, 
In you eternal life can be found...now 

[Chorus:] 
I'm hooked on a good thing, 
I never knew it could be this good. 
Took everything, 
But you gave me your love in return. 
Hooked on a good thing, 
My hunger for you grows stronger each day. 
Look unto the king, 
Hear what to say. 

[Chorus] 

God's a mean addiction!
