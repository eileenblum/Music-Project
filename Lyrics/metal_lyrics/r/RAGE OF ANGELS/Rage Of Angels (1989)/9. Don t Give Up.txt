No chance to see the lights of the city, 
No time just to walk in the sun. 
Don't cry there's a reason for living. 
Take a look in the mirror baby dying's no fun. 

[Chorus:] 
Don't give up, 
When you're down and out, 
Keep on smiling. 
Don't you frown, 
Give it all you've got. 
There's a better way, 
Just beyond the horizon. 

Break out of your state of depression, 
Look at the bright side of life. 
Well, you may not be what they call a socialite, 
But what you you be at the end of a knife. 

[Chorus] 

Out on the streets, you're looking for trouble, 
Laying your life on the line. 
It's time to shut the door to your past, 
Never look back, go to leave it behind. 

[Chorus]
