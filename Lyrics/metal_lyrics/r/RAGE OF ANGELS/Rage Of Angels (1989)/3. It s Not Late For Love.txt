She just started life on her own today, 
Never seen the light of day. 
Prancing around on a darkened street, 
Taking what comes here way. 
Kicked out, running scared, 
Looking for a place to live. 
Hopeless and blind with no state of mind, 
With so much love to give. 

[Chorus:] 
It's not late for love, 
When it comes from above. 
All her life's been misery, 
Broken hearted tragedy. 
It's not late for love. 

Always seems the world's unfair 
No one gets a second chance. 
Spinning around never touching the ground, 
Living in some kind of trance. 
Reach out, grab ahold, 
Time to make your move. 
Open your eyes look up to the skies 
He's waiting there for you. 

[Chorus]
