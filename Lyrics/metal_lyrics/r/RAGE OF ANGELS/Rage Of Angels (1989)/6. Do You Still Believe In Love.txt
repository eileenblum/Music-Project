I'm forever chasing you, 
It seems you're always on the run, 
With nowhere to go and no one to meet. 
Don't you know, sometimes we're too blind to see. 

[Chorus:] 
Do you still believe in love, 
Do you still believe in me. 
Do you still believe in heaven above n' God's holy love, 
The one thing that sets us both free. 
Do you still believe in love. 

I'm gettin' tired of this merry-go-round and around, 
I can't stop this love that I've found. 
The harder I try, the deeper I fall, 
Girl listen to me won't you answer my call. 

[Chorus] 

I'm forever chasing you, 
It seems you're always on the run, 
With nowhere to go and no one to meet. 
Don't you know, sometimes we're too blind to see. 

[Chorus]
