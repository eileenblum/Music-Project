Guitars were smashing when heaven came crashing down, 
A master disaster, the world as we know it crumbled on. 
When the maker was quaking, father we heard not a sound. 

When the fire was burning, desire was turning away, 
There's no way of knowing who's leaving or who's going to stay. 
Prepare your hearts now for the trumpet may sound any day. 

[Chorus #1] 
Are you ready for thunder, 
When the lightning strikes. 
If the lord calls your number, 
Will you be ready tonight. 

Follow the light deny the nocturnal breed, 
You're lost in the dark you know what it is that you need. 
When the fire arises you won't have a moment to bleed. 

[Chorus #2] 
Are you ready for thunder, 
When the lightning strikes. 
Is it taking you under, 
Like a thief in the night. 

Freely surrender you know that there is no other way, 
Put your past far behind you in time it will all fade away. 
Deep in the hour you'll run to the power of day. 

[Chorus #1] 

[Chorus #2]
