I lose my mind everytime you tell me no, 
It's not your kind to show your face to baby just go. 
Well, it seems a shame, such a pretty young thing, 
But you've got such a pretty warped mind. 
When heaven comes down and I'm not around, 
You'll be praying for a little more time. 

[Chorus (x4):] 
Somebody's watching you. 

Your smart remarks keep me hoping you'll walk away, 
And the way you carry your body, just got to say. 
Well, I wish you could see it from another point of view, 
But there's only one way and that's yours. 
There's no kind of changing, no rearranging. 
You're a wicked, wicked woman of the world. 

[Chorus] 

Everybody, me and the boys got something to say, 
So why don't you take a listen: 
Ya know, everyday we take for granted that if we should die, 
That we would go to heaven. 
But what we don't realize is that one day, 
We're gonna have to account for all our doin's. 
So, while you're out partying and living it up, 
Just remember that no matter where you go, 
What you say or what you do, 
Somebody's watching you. 

[Chorus]
