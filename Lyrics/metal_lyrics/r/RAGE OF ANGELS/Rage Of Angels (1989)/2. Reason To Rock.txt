Hey-there standing all alone, 
Won't you listen to me. 
Got message and it's it's coming your way, 
For the whole world to see. 

[Chorus:] 
"Got a reason, 
Got a reason. 
Reason to rock." 

Fallen angel hard to see, 
Laughing in my face. 
You'd better wake up cause in due time, 
I'm gonna leave this place 

[Chorus] 

So, let me tell you for your own good, 
It's gonna leave you in shock. 
Christ is the reason you live, 
And he's the one way to rock. 

[Chorus]
