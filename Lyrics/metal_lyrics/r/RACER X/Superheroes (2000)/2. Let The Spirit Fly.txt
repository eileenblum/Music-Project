God's voice whispers loudly on
Chasin' the dawn till the morning's gone
Pounds of time keep me
Drifting sad sweetly
Falling mad deeply
Into a place where I carry on

And let the spirit fly
Don't give a damn or wonder why
Let the spirit fly
It's time to do or die

Hard times hold the hallowed ground
Survivors feast and the lost die long
Seamless rhymes keep me
Pushing past weeping
Sleepless dreams keeping
An inner voice that is living strong

To let the spirit fly
Don't give a damn or wonder why
Let the spirit fly
It's time to do or die

And let the spirit fly
Don't give a damn or wonder why
Let the spirit fly
Gonna write across the sky

Let the spirit fly
Don't give a damn or wnder why
Let the spirit fly
It's time to do it

Endless times
Seamless rhymes

Give myself to shine
Glows cold crystalline
Blocks of true intent
Holds back malcontent
Tastes of turpentine
Snapping at my spine
Give to wheels of time
A small piece of mind
