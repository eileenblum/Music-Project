Hard whiskey and rum
Feels like I'm living
Under god's thumb
Poeple say it all the time
That my life
It ain't worth a dime

Now I cry
And I try moving to
A land that is new
I been walking the mile
In a dead man's shoes
I dead man's shoes

Got this planet on my back
One foot forward
Fifty steps back
My body holds an empty heart
Looks like an ending
I know it's no start

Will I die
When I try travelin' through
Pass the light that is true
Feel I'm walking god's mile
In a dead man's shoes
In a dead man's shoes

It's not that my soul's fallen down
Encased in a rust growing round
The preacher he won't pray for me
Am I trapped in this life eternally

Now I cry
When I try
Passing through
The light of a new
Going mile after mile
In a dead man's shoes
In a dead man's shoes
In a dead man's shoes
In a dead man's shoes
