She's a dancer, she's a midnight queen
A fast movin' woman
Moves her moter mean
She affects me, with her sex machine
God dammit she's the ultimate dream

What a grinder, she can blow you down
Got me humpin', like a hot runnin' hound
She can glind ya, with her skin-tight sheen
She'll bring it on long as the money is green

My piston's pumpin', can feel her steam
I love the metal inside her machine

One Hot Bitch - Got me begging for more
One Hot Bitch - Got me down on the floor
One Hot Bitch - I gotta get in between
And I know that you know what I mean

Since I found her, got me hypnotized
Eyes are rollin' to her serpentine
Look around her, glowin' in my sight
Like a star burnin' out in the night

I'm in danger, when I place my bet
I lost my mind, and I'll never forget
She's a stranger, but I know her well
I'm in heaven
Cause she's hotter than hell

Swingin' out she is a merry-go-round
I'd love to feel her
When that Mary goes down

One Hot Bitch - She's gonna even the score
One Hot Bitch - She's got pussy galore
One Hot Bitch - Keep you comin' for more
More, More, More, More, More

My piston's pumpin', can feel her steam
I love the metal inside her machine
I been to cheetah's and
I seen what she's done

Been 'round the world
And she's number one

One Hot Bitch - She's gonna even the score
One Hot Bitch - She's got pussy galore
One Hot Bitch - Keep you comin' for more
Owww

One Hot Bitch - Got me begging for more
One Hot Bitch - Got me down on the floor
One Hot Bitch - I gotta get in between
And I know that you know what I mean
She is nothin' like I've ever seen
And I know that you know what I mean
