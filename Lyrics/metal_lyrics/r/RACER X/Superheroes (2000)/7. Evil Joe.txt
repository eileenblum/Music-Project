We populate, contaminate
And suffocate in our own waste
So now kuwait can celebrate
And salivate
While we all eat barbiturates
And asparate in our V-8S
While crashin' on the interstate

What's your fate at the gate
When you lay dead on the slate

Is your heart filled with hate
Down to hell you will skate

Are you evil? EVIL JOE
Are you evil? EVIL JOE

We've colonised and communized
Demoralized and bastardized
Monopolized, terrorized
But who's the wise
When all's vaporized or fossilized
A dug up prize to be analogized
About our lies

What's the size of the prize
When your blood's crystalized

Will it be your demise
When a new sun will rise

Are you evil? EVIL JOE
Are you evil? EVIL JOE
Are you evil? EVIL JOE
Are you evil? EVIL JOE

We crucify then justify
Nullify so cut and dry
Falsify the truth's a lie
Out our lips comes alkali
Modified and sanctified
But all will cry
When we've sanitized
When you stand horrified
And it's your turn to fry

Are you evil? EVIL JOE
Are you evil? EVIL JOE
Are you evil? EVIL JOE
Are you evil? EVIL JOE
