I need you
Most everyday
I want to
In every way
Love that pretty little game you play
Y'all twisted round my DNA
Doing that hormone thing

Your secrets
On every page
My weakness
Victoria's expose
Take and shake me
Gonna make me pay
Got me spun out on your lingerie
Doing that hormone thing

You got me doing it
You got me blue with it
Doing that hormone thing

You got me blue with it
You got me doing it
Doing that hormone thing
Can't have you
There isn't a way
Perefection
Sweet untouchable lay
Feel ya movin' in on my mind
My heart is yours most all the time
Doing that hormone thing

Ya make my cold heart sing
Doing that hormone thing
Crucified on your G-string
Doing that hormone thing
Blowin' out my O-ring
Doing that hormone thing
For you I'd do anything
Doing that hormone thing
Squeakin' on my bedspring
