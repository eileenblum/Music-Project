Things are not going well
I won't lie to you man
Can't forget what's been done
My head's in my hand
I'm so tired
(Tired from the pain)

Frustrations are buildin'
The walls close on in
And the more the world takes
The more that I give
It's a fire
(Burnin' deep down inside)

I don't wanna feel this way
It ain't good for my heart
To be mad at the world
Mad at the world

Seems like day after day
Year upon year
Building up on my back
I look in the mirror
I'm so tired
(Tired of the shame)

Enough is enough
I can't take any more
Gonna shut all the windows
And lock all my doors
Let it spin on by

I don't wanna feel this way
It ain't good for my heart
To be mad at the world
Mad at the world

What I can't figure out
When I'm feelin' so bad
Is why I feel a power
Like I never had
I'm imspired

I don't wanna feel this way
It ain't good for my heart
To be mad at the world
Mad at the world
