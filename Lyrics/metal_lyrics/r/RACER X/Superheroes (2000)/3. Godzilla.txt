With a purposeful grimace
And a terrible scowl
He pulls the spitting
High-tension wires down

Helpless people on subway trains
Scream my god as he looks in on them

He picks up a bus
And he throws in back down
As he wades through the village
Towards the center of town

Oh no, they say he's gotta go
Go, Go, GODZILLA

Yoo ooh oo oo
Oh no, there goes Tokyo
Go, Go, GODZILLA
Yoo ooh oo oo

Oh no, they say he's gotta go
Go, Go, GODZILLA

Yoo ooh oo oo
Oh no, there goes Tokyo
Go, Go, GODZILLA
Yoo ooh oo oo

Oh no, they say he's gotta go
Go, Go, GODZILLA

Yoo ooh oo oo
Oh no, there goes Tokyo
Go, Go, GODZILLA
Yoo ooh oo oo

History shows again and again
How nature points out
The folly of men, GODZILLA!

History shows again and again
How nature points out
The folly of men, GODZILLA!

History shows again and again
How nature points out
The folly of men, GODZILLA!

History shows again and again
How nature points out
The folly of men, GODZILLA!
