There is no sunrise
There has never been a rain
Only an emptiness
No time, No fear, No pain
No bodies crying out
No one has yet to pray
No light has shone on down
There has never been a day

No shadows spreading out
No moon and earth yet spin
Only an entitiy
A god who made nothing
Drowned in his loneliness
Being the only one
Living eternity
In a time before the sun

Form contrast or colors hue
Have yet to meet an eye
The endless pins of light
Not yet to greet the sky
No throughts of seven days
To create everything
A spirit roams the void
A god who rules nothing

Consuming infinite
No end, No beginning
Reins in his vacuous
Has no thoughts of me
Wrapped in his onlyness
Being the lonely one
Being the only thing
In a time before the sun

No tide yet leap onto
A never ending shore
No here after
No beginning , No before
A pitless nothingness
That reaches deep within
Soul serching void extends
Black velvet, Blank abyss

A spirit crying out
For someone to adore
A pounding emptiness
Wants and needs for more
Tired of his loneliness
Being the only one
He sees a coming
In a time before the sun
