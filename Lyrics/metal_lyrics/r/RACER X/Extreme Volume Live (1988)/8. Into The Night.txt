Droppin' in from the skies
Infrared laser eyes
Gulpin' down pounds of fuel

They better not tangle with me
Supersonic can set you free

Into the Night
Into the night
Onward we ride
Into the night

Flying till the twilight rise
Searchin' for midnight spies
Slippin' through the stratosphere

They better not tangle with me
Rockets on I'll keep my home free

Into the night
Into the night
Onward we ride

Heaven bound
With this fire that's strapped to my back
Take me up, up, up, up, up

Now I'm armed to the teeth
Only in the name of peace
Devastation is my rule

Winging up through the clouds
Swoopin' down on the crowds

Into the night
Into the night
Onward we ride
Into the night
Into the night
Onward we ride
Into the night
