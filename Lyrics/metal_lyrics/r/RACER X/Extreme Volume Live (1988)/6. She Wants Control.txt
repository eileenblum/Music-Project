She up and left me
Said I got no heart
Well she outa know
After tearing it apart

She didn't like it
When I said
You will never get through to my head
No way

She wants control
Oh no
Baby wants my soul

She liked to keep me
All tied up
She never knew when enough
Was enough

Came as a sinner
Dressed as a saint
From then I knew
There'd be no restraint

She wants control
Oh no
Baby wants my soul

She wants control
Oh no
Baby wants my soul

She wants control
Oh no
Baby wants my soul

She wants control
Oh no
Baby wants my soul
Oh no
Baby
She wants control
Ba ba ba baby
She wants control
