I'm a hot-blooded high tension
Thermonuclear power pack
Don't mess with me brother
That'll be the straw that
Broke the camel's back

A rip roarin' rowdy
Bulletproof heart attack

I'm gonna set
The world on fire
You better bet
The flames 'll get higher
Higher

(Raise 'em up)

Gotta chip on my shoulder
I dare you to take a crack
Wipin' out the others with a
Snap of my finger
(Just like that)

An iron-hearted lover
Case hardened pyromaniac

I'm gonna set
The world on fire
You better bet
The flames 'll get higher
Higher

(Raise 'em up)

We wanna shake you
And set the world on fire
We're gonna break through
Maybe we'll take you up higher

I'm gonna set
The world on fire
You better bet
The flames 'll get higher
Higher

I'm gonna set
The world on fire
You better bet
The flames 'll get higher
Higher

Whoa
Whoa
