Her skin silken torcher
Eyes sharp and mean

Moves like a cat
Waitin' to sink in her teeth

Glides through nighttime crowds
She's on the midnight prowl
Dangerous Love
Don't touch, she's on your heels
Dangerous Love
What she got, well it ain't real

She lives off emotion
Thrives on defeat

Hungers for passion
Look out it's time she feeds

Cuts you down to size
A walking suicide
Dangerous Love
Don't touch, she's on your heels
Dangerous Love
What she got, well it ain't real

Whispers of light move away
Ties you all up you've nothing to say

Glides through nighttime crowds
She's on a midnight prowl
Dangerous Love
Don't touch, she's on your heels
Dangerous Love
What she got, well it ain't real
Dangerous Love
Look out, she's on your heels
Dangerous Love
Don't you touch, she's not for real
Dangerous Love
Don't touch, she's on your 
Dangerous Love
