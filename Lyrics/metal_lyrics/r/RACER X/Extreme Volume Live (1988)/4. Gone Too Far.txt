You waste all of my time
Ya take my love and throw it away
Aw aw aw
It's got to stop

You've gone too far
Too too far

Ya been pushin' me over the line
How much more will you make me pay
Aw aw aw
It's got to stop

On the street and walkin' so bold
You got a face, a face, that stops men cold

You've gone too far
Too too far

Not even gonna take no more
It's time I finally, even, even the score

You've gone too far
You've gone too far
Too too far
You've gone too far
Too too far
You've gone too far
It's got to stop
