Mirrored reflections in your frames
Your tack is racing
10-40 weight runs in your veins
Your heart is pacing
Pushing to the edge
Cut air like a wedge

Racing the white line
Motorman
Speed is your lifeline
Motorman, man man

In a snap he bolts away
Screamin' steam roller
Mind and machine they're one the same
Throttle rolls over
Roaring pass the crowd
Leaves them in a cloud

Racing the white line
Motorman
Into the nighttime
Motorman, man man
Speed is his lifeline
Motorman
Push pass the redline
Motorman, man man
Hour to hour
He scowers the plains
Split second cruiser
Hydraulics run in his veins
Flesh into fiber
Clipping the air
Gears cam and pistons wind in to a

Race for the white line
Motorman
Into the nighttime
Motorman, man man
Speed is his lifeline
Motorman
Racing the white line
Motorman, man man man man
