Crashing through the city streets
Caught in the glare of the midnight sun
I got wings upon my feet
But locked as I run

I am just a breath away
From knockin' you senseless to the ground
No escape I hear you say
You're never safe
From a

Heart, heart of a lion
My Heart
A heart of a lion

I close my eyes and I see your face
Seems like I'm trapped within your spell
Will I ever win this race
You're moving in

And my needs cry from the sky
Blares through the still as it cuts the air
In your hold I know that I
Will never find a love
Of a

Heart, a heart of a lion
My Heart
A heart of a lion

All around I hear
The sound of your mighty roar
As I give I find that you are calling out for more

All around I hear
The sound of your mighty roar
As I give I find that you are crying

A Heart
Of a lion
My Heart
Of a lion
My heart

Heart, a heart of a lion
My Heart
A heart of a lion

Heart, a heart of a lion
My Heart
A heart of a lion

Heart, a heart of a lion
My Heart
A heart of a lion
