Your light shined out bright
Shined out for all to see
But it really only shines for only me

And when the day runs out of light
We feel each other
Our love is burning bright

Sunlit nights
Your love is burning away
Brighter everyday
Sunlit nights
Feel my love goin' up in flames

Warms with a touch
You know just what to do
Sparks me with a fever
That burns me all night through

Bring on the heat
Turn out the light
We will be melting
Melting down tonight

Sunlit nights
Your love is burning away
Brighter everyday
Sunlit nights
Feel my love goin' up in flames

All through the day
I try and keep it cool
But all my day dreamin'
Brings me back to you
(And our)

Sunlit nights
Your love is burning away
Brighter everyday
Sunlit nights
Feel my love goin' up in flames

Sunlit nights
Your love is burning away
Brighter everyday
Sunlit nights
Feel my love goin' up in flames
