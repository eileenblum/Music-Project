I know it's true
Know what you wanna do
I could see
See what you want from me

'Cause your eyes show it
Yeah, your eyes show it
Your eyes show it to me
(What you need)

Your body talks
It's shoutin' when you walk
That's the language that I read
It screams I've got the need

You know I know it
I know you know it
I know just what you need

(Huh, come on give it to me)
All shaken up in love
Give it to me
You gotta give it to me
I'm hooked, I got the buzz
Give it to me
Can't ya see what you're doin' to me
(Come on give it)

'Cause your eyes show it
Yeah, your eyes show it
Your eyes show it to me

All shaken up in love
Give it to me
You gotta give it to me
I'm hooked, I got the buzz
Give it to me
Can't ya see what you're doin' to me

All shaken up in love
Give it to me
You gotta give it to me
I'm hooked, I got the buzz
Give it to me
Give it to me, me
