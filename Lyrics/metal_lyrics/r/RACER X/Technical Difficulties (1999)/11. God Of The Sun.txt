[Jeff Martin, Russ Parrish]

Pray to the rain
Pray to the god of thunder
We are as one
Through the blood of our brothers
On through the ages
We have lived here free
Spirits from the past remind me
We get our strength from the light up above
God of the sun

We face the east
The smoke is offered upward
(we pray Heammawihio)
To fight this scourge
Who rape this land our mother
The white eyes came across the sea
Bringing pain and misery
Oh five us hope great spirit up above
God of the sun

Great father I pray
With the strength of your light
Help us find a way
We wish only to breath
The dust of our fathers
And to hunt where their spirits lives
Now they bury our pride
And caputure our souls
Leaving us barren
With no place left to go
And with pain in our hearts
And tears in our eyes
We look up and we pray
To the God of the sun

On throught the ages we have lived here free
Spirits from the past remind me
We get our strength from the light up above
God of the sun, God of the sun
They've captured our pride
They've cut us inside
The winds of war are blowing strong
Our trail of tears gets long
God of the sun
