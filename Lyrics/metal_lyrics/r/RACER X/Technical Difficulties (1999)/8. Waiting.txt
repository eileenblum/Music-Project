[Jeff Martin]

You rock my world out of its place
You took my soul out of its space
There's no denying, sad but true
I just can't get over you
I sit alone right by the phone
Waiting
For your love
Waiting

So hard to find, you're so unkind
I feel you near time after time
At the sunrise I'm still awake
I see my hopes a sad and fake
I bid this rhyme just killin' time
And waiting
In the dark
Waiting

From nine to nine your on my mind
Can't seem to shake this time
You and your desappearing game
What I'm left is quite insane
In the park or in the dark
Anytime your on my mind as I'm
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
