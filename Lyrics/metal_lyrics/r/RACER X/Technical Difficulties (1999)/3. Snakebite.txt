[Jeff Martin, Paul Gilbert, Scott Travis]

Comes way after midnight
Slinks around the alleys of your mind
Wakes you and you're breathless
Cannot figure out waht's deep inside you

A strike will come you'll least expect
Aaaw no, there's a snakebite coming
From inside your mind

Wide eyed, left in wonder
In the dark the poison feeds your mind
Praying for an angel
A spirit in your heart you've left enshrined

There's no rescue there's no escape
Awww no, there's a snakebite coming
From inside your mind

How much longer can you stand this
Anxiety, the guilt, the fear, the doubt
A coiling hiss of madness
At its will a tongue that lashes out

Your heart will pound out deep regrets
Awww no, there's a snakebite coming
From inside your mind
There's a snakebite coming from inside
There's a snakebite coming from inside
There's a snakebite coming from inside
Your mind
