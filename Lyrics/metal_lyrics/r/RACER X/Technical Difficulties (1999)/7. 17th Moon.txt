[Jeff Martin, Paul Gilbert, Scott Travis]

Spinning around its master
Its master is setting it free
Hurling into the void now
Between the earth and he

Sea of sulfurid acid
Sky of ammonia and lead
A monteraneous world
Soon to be covered in red
Breath of carbon dioxide
A satellite of the dead

You've just realized
Don't be surprised
A day will come soon of 17th Moon
The 17th Moon comin' soon

Whirling and twirling and spitting out fire
Belching out tons of stream
It was once a small point in the sky
Getting closer or so it seems

Jupiter didn't want it
Venus moved out of its way
A barreling ball of gases
Its evil is coming this day
Crushing down all around us
Now you got the piper to pay

You've just realized
Don't be surprised
A day will come soon of 17th Moon
The 17th Moon comin' soon

Streams of rusty poison
Stripping of its back
Heard for the god of war
Yes, Mars is under attack

Hundreds of millions of whispers
Floating upon the air
Beggars of God's forgiveness
All so unprepared
Churches full of people
Souls so unrepaired
Don't be surprised
You've just realize
A day will come soon of the 17th Moon

Rivers flowing of arsenic
Lakes of Mercury
Come to end your existence
Coming to set you free
A monsteranous world
Comes for you and me

You've just realized
Don't be surprised
A day will come soon of 17th Moon
The 17th Moon comin' soon
