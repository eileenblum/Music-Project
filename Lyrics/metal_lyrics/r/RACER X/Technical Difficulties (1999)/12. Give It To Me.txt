[Bruce Bouillet, Jeff Martin, Paul Gilbert]

I know it's true
Know what you wanna do
I can see
See what you want from me

'Cause your eyes show it
Yeah, Your eyes show it
Your eyes show it to me
(what you need)

Your body talks
Its shoutin' when you walk
That's the language I read
It screams I got the need

You know I know it
I know you know it
I know just want you need
All shaken up in love
Give it to me, gotta give it to me
I'm hooked, I got the buzz
Give it to me
Can't ya see what you're doin' to me

'Cause your eyes show it
Yeah, your eyes show it
Your eyes show it to me

All shaken up in love
Give it to me, gotta give it to me
I'm hooked, I got the buzz
Give it to me
Can't ya see what you're doin' to me
