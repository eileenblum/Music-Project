[Jeff Martin, Paul Gilbert]

Got the gear, got the gas, got compression
She's the one gonna lesson my load
I'll make her shine in a cold pure perfection
Feel the gleam as I'm startin' to roll

Pouring on the speedway heat
She is my concrete connection

I fly wiht a
I ride with a
I glide with a bolt in my heart
I'm alive gonna
Power dive hit my
Overdrive with this bolt in my heart

Ain't no losin'
Got my movin' and
My groovin' all the way now

I ain't lookin' for divine intervention
Turn the key, hit the gas, and I go
My direction is cast to the concrete
I ain't going where the Down Boys go
Moving to the asphalt beat
I am a moter mutation

Run away, run
Run to stay
Gonna make my way with this bolt in my heart
Parallel fire, I'm
Speed for hire, been a
Road vampire
Pablo give me some guitar

Accelerate, accumulate
No time to give to vindicate
Lubricate 'n' desecrate
I'll make the air disintegrate
Aggravate and decimate
A navigatin' heavy weight
Pounding down hard cross the ground

I fly wiht a
I ride with a
I glide with a bolt in my heart
I lean with my
Bad machine
My morphine is this bolt in my heart
Gonna fly
Gonna get real high
Least I'll try with a bolt in my heart
Runaway, run
Run to stay
Gonna make my way with this bolt in my heart

Ain't no losin' got my movin' and my
Groovin all day now
Can't deny it gets me high
When I'm speedin' and I'm
Peelin' down the asphalt way now
With this bolt in my heart
