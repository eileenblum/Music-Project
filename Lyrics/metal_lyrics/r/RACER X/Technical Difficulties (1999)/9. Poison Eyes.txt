[Paul Gilbert, Jeff Martin, Bruce Bouillet]

Kicked in the teeth
I fell down on the floor
Smooth talkin' won't save me now that's for sure
I can't deny the truth
Well I might have tried, but she's got the proof

I thought that I was smooth
She's on to all my moves

You can't desguise poison eyes
She wants my life, I can't hide from
Poison eyes (your eyes)

357 in nylons and rouge
Hunting me down she said she's been used
There's nothing left to say
If she catches up she'll blow me away

She pulled the hammer down
Wants me face on the ground

You can't desguise poison eyes
She wants my life, I can't hide from
Poison eyes

She crashed through the door
She said, "I won't be your fool no more"
Smiles, and pulls the hammer back
Get even or bust, she's on the attack
(shoot me)

You can't desguise poison eyes
She wants my life, I can't hide,
I can't hide, I can't hide from your eyes
You can't desguise poison eyes
It's time to die for my lies
(from your)
Poison, Poison, Poison eyes
