[Paul Gilbert]

We're coming to stay
Can't send us back 'cause we're from the stars
We'll show you the way
Life is forever, and life is hours

The sound gives you vision
My voice lets you hear
Ten thousand watts screamin' clear

Let the music move your soul
Burn the fire of rock and roll

We're calling your name
You can't answer back 'cause you're in a dream
Your body's the same
But nothing around you is what it seems
(it's not what it seems)

Things as they are
Change to how they could be
Transforming the world that you see

Let the music take control
Burn the fire of rock and roll
Let the music move your soul
Burn the fire of rock and roll

We're coming to stay
Can't send us back 'cause we're finally free
Our hearts are the same
We only have time for the ones who dream
(and all of us dream)

The sound gives you vision
My voice lets you hear
Ten thousand watts screamin' clear

Let the music move your soul
Burn the fire of rock and roll
Let the music take control
Burn the fire of rock
Feel the music move your soul
Burn the fire of rock and roll
