You were my everything, till you got around
The love you bright song sings, has been laying on down

And now that everything
Is just like everything
Since I'm down

In blue I thirst for you, a sea that you are
A dream I could touch you, but now you're a star

I'm down with everything
Everything's everything
And now that everything
Is just like everything
Since I'm down

I gave you everything
Everything's everything
And now that everything
Is just like everything
Since I'm down
Since I'm down
Now I'm down
Everything's everything
I feel down
Everything's everything
Now I'm down
Everything's everything
Since I'm down
Everything's everything
I feel down
Everything's everything
