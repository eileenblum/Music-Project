Beyond the pale, beneath the moon
He crawls the walls for you
With teeth like nails that sink to bone
Hard to swallow easy to chew

Cold synthetic human flesh
Eats the mind and leaves the rest
On the night just like a whore
Bagged and tagged and never more

I've been bangin' and hangin' with Dr. X
He's the one that's gonna put you in a hex
Got me bangin' and hangin' with Dr. X
You better hope and pray that you are not his next

A scream from Fay, a Wray of moon
This lunatic is stalking you
At Blackstone shoals the madness grooves
Wicked Wells will make his move

Scalpel shinning in the night
Turned crimson red to his delight
Claws gripping round your breath
The horror dripping down your neck

I've been bangin' and hangin' with Dr. X
He's the one that's gonna put you in a hex
Got me bangin' and hangin' with Dr. X
He's the one that's going to get you maybe next

Red rolling blood shot his eyes seek a victim tonight
Hangs in the shadows your last breath a puff of pure fright
Tear gently falling he leans down death kiss you goodnight

Cold synthetic human flesh
Eats the mind and leaves the rest
On the night just like a whore
Bagged and tagged and never more

I've been bangin' and hangin' with Dr. X
He's the one that's gonna put you in a hex
Got me bangin' and hangin' with Dr. X
Better hope and pray that you are not his next

I've been bangin' and hangin' with Dr. X
He's the one that's gonna put you in a hex
Got me bangin' and hangin' with Dr. X
He's the one that's going to get you maybe next
