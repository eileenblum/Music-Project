Sailing on an endless sea
Places that I've never been before
Cross the world and back for more

Travel to the rising sun
Can't catch up no matter how I run
On a stone that is rolling on

Sometimes I'm drinkin' all alone
Sometimes I feel I can't go home
I feel lost and alone
How my feet want to roam
On a trip that is endless
Endless

Blood and sorrow stain my trail
Ride upon the wind that never fails
I leave nothin' but a tale to tell

Wear the world upon my skin
Ink is deep from places I have been
But I've never got to know you well

Sometimes it's not the way I planned
Sometimes I reach out for your hand
What you don't understand
I'm a ramblin' man
On a trip that is endless
Endless
Endless
Endless

I dream an endless day
Somehow I hear you say
Come back to me someday
Come please
Please

The road wears hard against my skin
Home's a place where I have rarely been
Not to hold you has been such a sin

Sometimes I'm drinkin' all alone
Sometimes I feel I can't go home
I know it's not the way I planned
What you don't understand
I'm a ramblin' man
On a trip that is endless
Endless
Endless
Endless
Endless
