From a far came a star and he traveled from the great unknown
Built a world out of stone rocked us down made it all his own

With one stroke of his hand
He was across the land
Jet-black jive and rockin' beat

He's the one the Golden God
The one the Golden God

Take 'em high to the sky leave 'em lie let 'em scream their peace
On their knees wrapped in tears broken hearts steely knife he'd pierce

The king of rock and roll
Maybe he sold his soul
The devil's sound who could he be

He's the one the Golden God
The one the Golden God

All alone body cold lying on an alabaster stone
He made his final stand image scratched around white bleached bones

The king of rock and roll
Maybe he sold his soul
The devil's sound who could he be

He's the one the Golden God
The one the Golden God

He'll live on the Golden God
The one the Golden God

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

Give it to the Golden God
