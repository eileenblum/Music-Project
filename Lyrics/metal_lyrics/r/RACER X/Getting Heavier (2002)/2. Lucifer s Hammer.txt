It breaks the light, it owns the night, it steals the day
I'm filled with fright I roll it on can't get away

Oh no, oh no scaring the shit out of me
Can't you see
Chasing me

Lucifer's hammer comes rolling down the track
Scorching the road and burning your back
When Lucifer's hammer is pulling up behind
Pull it back, kick it down, move it over, pull a side

Crushing the ground raping the earth tearing up speed
Thrashing down fuel fuming the air on me it feeds

Oh no, oh no thirsts for my need for pure speed
Rolling free
Eating me

Lucifer's hammer comes rolling down the track
Scorching the road and burning your back
Lucifer's hammer comes crawling up your spine
Running you down 'n grinding in your mind
Lucifer's hammer comes rolling down the track
Scorching your soul and burning your back
When Lucifer's hammer is pulling up behind
Pull it back, kick it down, move it over, pull a side

Here it comes!

Lucifer's hammer comes rolling down the track
Scorching the road and burning your back
Lucifer's hammer comes crawling up your spine
Running you down 'n grinding in your mind
Lucifer's hammer comes rolling down the track
Scorching your soul and burning your back
When Lucifer's hammer is pulling up behind
Pull it back, kick it down, move it over, pull a side

Lucifer's Hammer
Lucifer's Hammer
Lucifer's Hammer
Lucifer's Hammer
Lucifer's Hammer
Lucifer's Hammer
