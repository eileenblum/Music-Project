Lost the pieces of my mind
My soul keeps searching for a better place in time
Where should I go?
What should I be?
Seems like the things in life are lost that set me free

Blind man, blue man
Sad man, used man
Blind man, blue man
Empty man

I've joined a group of walking dead
Hard to know what's bad, what's good, what's in my head
Living life in a matchbox
Peeking out it seems the spinning never stops

Blind man, blue man
Sad man, used man
Blind man, blue man
Empty man

Blind man, blue man
Sad man, used man
Blind man, blue man
Empty man

Broken pieces cast in gray
Hallow shell of human clay
A heart that's sewing shut my eyes
Can't see the love that shines before me

I'm such a blind man
I'm more than blue man
A silly sad man
I'm all but used up man

Old reflections of good times
Stare at me blankly like a wristwatch that won't wind
Locked in a mirror with no key
It's hard to see that smiling creature once was me

Blind man, blue man
Sad man, used man
Blind man, blue man
Empty man
Blind man, blue man
Sad man, used man
Blind man, blue man
Empty man
Empty man
Empty man
