You cut me up like a chain saw
You ripped the soul out of me
I gave the stars and I prayed for
Sweet music you sang to me

Turn to stone, turn to stone
A new song you are singing to me

Cold eye drip vengeance so hateful
A glare of daggers that gleam
You robbed it all and I paid for
The seamy chorus you scream

Please let me go, let me go
Cries of love, hope, anger and greed

The Siren's Eye will melt a man to dreams
The Siren's Eye will rip his flesh to screams

Crashed on the rocks and left pounding
Your storm is raging on me
Down to the bottom and drowning
The end of man is your creed

Let me go
Now I know
Let me go
Turn to stone is the song you are singing to me

The siren's eye will melt a man to dreams
The siren's eye will rip his flesh to screams

When I look into your wicked eyes it brings death to me
When I hear your soft your sweet sweet sighs it will set me free

The siren's eye
The siren's eye
The siren's eye
The siren's eye

When I look into your wicked eyes it brings death to me
When I hear your soft your sweet sweet sighs it will set me free
