I'm an alligator
I'm a mama, papa callin' for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rockin' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawkin'
Like a big monkey bird
And I'm bustin' out my brains for the world

Keep your electric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close mine luv

Freak out in a moonage daydream
Ohhh yeah

Don't fake it baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

Whoa oh whoa oh whoa
Keep your electric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close mine luv

Freak out in a moonage daydream

Whoa oh whoa oh whoa
Keep your electric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close mine luv

Freak out to a moonage daydream
Ohh yeah

Whoa oh whoa oh whoa
Keep your electric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close mine luv

Freak out to a moonage daydream
Ohh yeah
