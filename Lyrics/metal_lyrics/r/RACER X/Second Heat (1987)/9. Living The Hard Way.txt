It's over
Your problem won the fight
Forget it
You gotta take it light

It's easy
Just push them all way
Only dreamers
Try to make gold from clay

You keep on taking chances with your back against the wall
Hurdle after hurdle you're still giving it your all

Living the hard way
Put your mind to rest
And forget about living the hard way
Life is not a test
So forget about living the hard way

We'll I know you
You try and do it all
You're blinded
And headed for a fall

Don't worry
Things are on the rise
They must be
Keep aiming for the sky

Go on taking chances till there's no place left to hide
Living in the fast lane no one's stickin' by your side

Living the hard way
Put your mind to rest
And forget about living the hard way
Life is not a test
So forget about living the hard way

Don't sweat it

Go on taking chances with your back against the wall
Hurdle after hurdle you're still giving it your all

Living the hard way
Put your mind to rest
And forget about living the hard way
Life is not a test
So forget about living the hard way
Put your mind to rest
And forget about living the hard way
Life is not a test
So forget about living the hard way
