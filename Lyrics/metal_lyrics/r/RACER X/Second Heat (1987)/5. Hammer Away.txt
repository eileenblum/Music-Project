Don't tell me you know
What it's all about
What it's about
Your thinking makes me scream and shout
I won't give out

You try and change my life
That cuts me like a knife

I'm gonna hammer Away
Won't listen to what you say
I'm gonna hammer away, hammer away
And do it my way

I'd love to tell a thing or two
Right to you
You've gotten under my skin
Well I'm through
Through with you

So I'm lowerin' the boom
Climbing out of this old tomb
And Hammer away

I'm tired of you
Layin' down the law
You make no sense at all
You'll never make me break down
And fall
No not at all

Don't you try and change my life
Cause that cuts me like a knife

I'm gonna hammer away
Won't listen to what you say
I'm gonna hammer away, hammer away
Make it some place

I'm gonna hammer away
Won't listen to what you say
I'm gonna hammer away, hammer away
And do it my way

I'm gonna
I'm gonna hammer away
