Rompin' and roamin' all over town
Pickin' you up and laying you down
Too big for my britches or so I've been told
Going through the emotions
I'll stop your heart cold

To the end
A girl's best friend

When you talk about love
(You need a)
Lady killer
If you're lookin' for a goodtime
(Come on)
Give it away

If you're feelin' lonely
If you feel sad
Just call the rock doctor
If you need it bad

Got prescription that I'd love to fill
Tell me who is your daddy
Who pays the bills

From the start
No one can warm your heart

When you talk about love
(You need a)
Lady killer
If you're lookin' for a goodtime
(Come on)
Give it away

I know you want
I got what you need
Face it babe
You're gonna plead, plead, plead

When you talk about love
(You need a)
Lady killer
If you're lookin' for a goodtime
(Come on)
Give it away
If you need a little love
(You need a)
Lady killer
When you're lookin' for the good life
(Come on)
Give it away
When you talk about love
(You need a)
Lady killer
If you're lookin' for a goodtime
(Come on)
Give it away
