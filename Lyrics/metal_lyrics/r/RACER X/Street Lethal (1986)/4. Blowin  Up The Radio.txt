I recall when the hard stuff ruled the air
Off on a tear it seemed
To be everywhere
Now it's all the same
With just another name
I'll be the one they blame for
Blowin' up the radio

No matter where the dial is it's on every wave
Makes you it's slave you see
You can't get away
To me they are a joke
Their garbage makes me choke
Up in a puff of smoke
Blowin' up the radio

Hang tough I won't give up I got a plan
Across the land you'll be Breakin' away
Then they all will see
How it's supposed to be
I'll set you all free
By blowin' up the radio

Got my explosives wired
They got my engines fired
I'm blowin' up the radio
