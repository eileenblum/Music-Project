Out all over town
The sounds they move like thunder
Move with the crowd
Don't you get held under
Feel it kickin' in
Like nitroglycerin
Maybe it's a sin but rock it

You gotta rock it
Come on rock it
Let's go rock it
When you need it hot
Gotta hit the spot
Get yourself free and rock it

Like a bolt from the blue
The feeling's gonna hit you
You're nobody's fool
Burnin' right on through
Feelin' kinda tough
Sorta in a huff
Don't you stop it, rock it

You gotta rock it
Come on rock it
Let's go rock it
Don't ya miss a trick
Hits you like a brick
Goin' to town step on it

Bouncin' off the walls
When you hear it call
Let it all go, ya rock it
Whippin' up the dust
Feel it to the crust
Pedal to the floor jump on it

You gotta rock it
Come on rock it
Let's go rock it
When you need it hot
Gotta hit the spot
Get yourself free
Let's go

You gotta rock it
Come on rock it
Let's go rock it
Everybody rock it
Don't ya miss a trick
Hits you like a brick
Goin' to the show
Let's go

You gotta rock it
Come on rock it
Let's go rock it
Ohhh...rock it

You gotta rock it
Come on rock it
Let's go rock it
Let's go
Oh
Yeah
