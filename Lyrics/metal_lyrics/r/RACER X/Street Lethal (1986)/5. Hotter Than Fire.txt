Runnin' hot and heavy
Feelin' kinda mean
Getting' down and dirty
No Mr. Clean

Throat like a gun barrel
Shootin' hot laser beams
A real pressure cooker
Blowin' off steam

Hotter than fire
Feelin' kinda mean
Hotter than fire

My frame stiff and sturdy
Legs are long and lean
Move on a side don't get in front of me
On a hot summer night
I'm ready to fight
With a left and right
Don't mess around with me

Hotter than fire
Feelin' kinda mean
Hotter than fire

Out on the streets, I'm all over town
You better pray I leave you be
You can't touch me and I ain't foolin' around
I'm hotter than fire can't you see
I'm hot

Hotter than fire
Feelin' kinda mean
Hotter than fire
I ain't no Mr. Clean
Hotter than fire
Let 'em stay
Hotter than fire
Feelin' kinda mean
Hot, Hot
I'm on fire
Hot, Hot
