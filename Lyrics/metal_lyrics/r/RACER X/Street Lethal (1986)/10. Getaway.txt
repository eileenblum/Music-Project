Get, get away
Get away
Get, get away
Get away

You like 'em long
You like 'em lean
You kiss me once then you're back out on the scene
(Ya know what I mean)

I just found out the other day
Ya like to use and abuse me
(Yes just don't keep it clean)

Maybe someday I can find
A way to keep you and my peace of mind
I need a little release
Gotta get myself free

Get away
Ya get away
I gotta Get away, get away
Get away

I told you once
I told you twice
Your kind of love is a bad roll of the dice
(Snake eyes)

Get me up to let me down
I set things straight you turn them around
I can't take no more of this dear
You get the hell out of here

Get away
Ya get away
Ya better get away, get away
Get away

I think I finally realize
You ain't worth a cold thin dime
No talkin' second chance
You've been a waste of my time

Go on get away
Ya get away
Get out get out
Get away
Get away
Get away
You better get away, get away
Well get away
You better get away, get away
Get away
Get out, get away
Get away
