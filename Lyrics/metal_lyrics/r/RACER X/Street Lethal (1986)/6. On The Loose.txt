I don't want to listen
To what you gotta say
That's how I'm living
I live for today

I've been accused
A real short fuse
Rockin' rage, runnin' away

I'm on the loose
I think I let myself go
I'm on the loose
Outta control
(Hit me)

I don't take no for answer
Won't play your silly games
It really doesn't matter
What you think of me

That's how I'm living
I'll never give in
All the rules I disobey

I'm on the loose
I think I let myself go
I'm on the loose
Outta control
(Mercy)

I've got big ambition
The top is where I'll stay
I'm a poser and a big shot
The city's where I play

I've been accused
A real short fuse
Rockin' rage, runnin' away

I'm on the loose
I think I let myself go
I'm on the loose
Outta control

I'm on the loose
I think I let myself go
I'm on the loose
Outta control

I'm out, out of control
