Taking on a storm
Blast right through with no shape
Or no form
Travels on the waves
On you in mere seconds
You cannot run away

Like guns a blazing
Out of thin air
You'll hear me

Loud and clear
The sound in your head is my voice
Can you hear
Loud and clear
You won't feel my touch
But you'll know
I'm here

Rush out of the way
Molecules of air turned into
Compression waves
Thunder clapping out
Counting down the cycles
Till I reach you with a shout

Like guns a blazing
Out of thin air
You'll hear me

Loud and clear
The sound in your head is my voice
Can you hear
Loud and clear
You won't feel my touch
But you'll know
I'm here

Vibrating granite walls
Roaring down the canyons with
Just a simple call
Valuable as gold
From a whisper to a shout
I'm impossible to hold

Like guns a blazing
Out of thin air
You'll hear me

Loud and clear
The sound in your head is my voice
Can you hear
Loud and clear
You won't feel my touch
But you'll know
I'm...
Loud and clear
You won't see me come
But you'll know that I'm near
Loud and clear
The sound in your head is my voice
Loud and Loud and Loud
Loud and clear
