No one dies alone
you take a piece of me with you
friendships carved in stone; by yourself
but not alone
loyalties forged in fire, will make no sense of this
a lost soul in a funeral pyre
shows me the way to fate's desire
no one dies alone
no one dies alone
and you call death your own?
how can i believe
that this was meant to be?
the only thing i see, a lost love, a painful eulogy
the flame of life that once burned bright
now casting shadows on the memories i've saved
they're buried and resting at last in the grave
but no one dies alone
no one dies alone
can you call death your own? no
flame of life burnt short
no one dies alone
no one dies
alone
