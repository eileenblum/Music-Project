Demons of retribution
beaten, defeated
now is the time that we strike back
you're empty, depleted
WE STAND UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE
WE NEVER WALK A WORN PATH
WE FOLLOW NONE; OUR HEROES ARE GONE
WE ARE PURE FURY AND WRATH
power has gone into your head
you're hollow, selfless
while we carried this cross upon our back
soured, deflowered
WE STAND UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE
WE NEVER WALK A WORN PATH
WE FOLLOW NONE; OUR HEROES ARE GONE
WE ARE PURE FURY AND WRATH
THERE'S NO MORE HEROES LEFT FOR ME
THERE'S NO MORE HEROES LEFT FOR YOU
THERE'S NO MORE HEROES LEFT FOR US
THERE'S NO MORE HEROES LEFT
vengeance is our solution
solid, unbroken
vengeance is absolution
breaking delusions
WE STAND UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE
WE NEVER WALK A WORN PATH
WE FOLLOW NONE; OUR HEROES ARE GONE
WE ARE PURE FURY AND WRATH
