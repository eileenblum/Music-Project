Exploit your weakness, down and useless
love or hate this, sign of the times
we both know this, alone and helpless
when i was like this, where were you?
NOW, YOUR TURN TO DEAL
YOUR TURN TO BE AS USELESS AS I FEEL
TIME WRITHE INSIDE
CLIMB INTO THE HOLE THAT YOU HIDE
LEAVE YOUR DREAMS BEHIND
ENDLESS NIGHTS, AGONIZE
cold, heartless son
being the only one, reprisal so sweet
you can take this sorrow that drains me of my youth
know no one will show you mercy
on this holy day of truth
exploit your weakness, down and useless
love or hate this, sign of the times
we both know this, alone and helpless
when i was like this, where were you?
exploit your weakness, down and useless
love or hate this, sign of the times
remember this day, whatever you say
will always someday, come back to you
NOW, YOUR TURN TO DEAL
YOUR TURN TO BE AS USELESS AS I FEEL
TIME WRITHE INSIDE
CLIMB INTO THE HOLE THAT YOU HIDE
LEAVE YOUR DREAMS BEHIND
ENDLESS NIGHTS, AGONIZE
