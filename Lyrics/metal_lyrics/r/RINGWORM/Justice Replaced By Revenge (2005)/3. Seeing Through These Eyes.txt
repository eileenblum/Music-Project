I see hope die, seeing through these eyes
some would say we lived our lives a lie
another face, another place to hide
empty souls - no truth to set us free
as we reflect on what we'll never be
don't want to believe
there's nothing inside
i find myself - between the lines
it's made of blood
it's made with heart
is all we built falling apart?
never thought of losing all i believed
deep depression taking hold
slowly killing me
i see hope, seeing through these eyes
