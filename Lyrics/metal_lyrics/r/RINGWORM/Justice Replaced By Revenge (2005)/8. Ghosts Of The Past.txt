Devils sing my song - I've been gone so long
dead inside - seeing sights unseen
now no other way - it's life and death
velvet and black - fight my way back
it's all the same - it's just a game
knife in my back - abrasive and red
hear what i said - 'cause I've been alive
and i've been dead
you don't know how far you've gone
until you've left something behind
i've cut my throat - slit my wrists
and sold my soul one thousand times
pointless ambition - no resolution to my severed ties
lost in the madness - and wiped tears of blood
from these crimson eyes
is it my destiny to rot alone with these
GHOSTS OF THE PAST
thoughts locked away - now dull impressions
we've gone so far so fast - the memories outlast
father time, if you can't heal my wounds
please stop the bleeding
