You think that life is easy
i gotta do what i can
broken down, fucking sleazy
I'm taking all i can get
GOING NOWHERE
DISCONNECT
I LIVE IN SHADOWS; OF MYSELF
so you say I'm a product of my environment
there's no big letdown
because I'm not finished yet
BECAUSE DEATH IS NOT AN OPTION
I CAN'T BELIEVE IN YOU
I CAN'T BELIEVE IN ME
DISCONNECT ALL MY FEELINGS
ALL MY SANITY
GOING NOWHERE, DISCONNECT
I LIVE IN SHADOWS, OF MYSELF
you think that life is easy
i gotta do what i can
broken down, fucking sleazy
I'm taking all i can get
BECAUSE DEATH IS NOT AN OPTION
