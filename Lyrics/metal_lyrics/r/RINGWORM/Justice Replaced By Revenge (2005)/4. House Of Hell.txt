Heartless, this well of souls is black and bottomless
i feel my blood boil over
emotionless and cold, it keeps pushing me
seeing red until i finally reach my...
THRESHOLD
i feel nothing, sweet embrace of pain
rites of passage, only scars remain
you own me now, mind a vessel for your will
in this house of hell, inside my mind is screaming
here and there, bought and sold
you left my feelings cold
in this house of hell - the blood is raining down
it's raining down
in this house of hell
