We are the new generation
we don't care how you deceive
an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, we believe
tell us the price of our freedom
you tell us we're all born the same
united fall, injustice
in your name
now we can see, there's one choice
it's justice replaced by revenge
now we can see, there's no choice
it's justice replaced by revenge
our rights have been taken
high cost of our liberty
we are the fruit of a nation that's diseased
one hand the hammer of justice
the other the hammer of truth
who decides on how to retribute?
now we can see, there's one choice
it's justice replaced by revenge
now we can see, there's no choice
it's justice replaced by revenge
