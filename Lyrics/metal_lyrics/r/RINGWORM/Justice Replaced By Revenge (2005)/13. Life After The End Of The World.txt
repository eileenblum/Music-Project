Life after the end of the world is now
for my love, for my hate, for my lies, for my fears
drowning in tears
i don't want to stop it
i won't even try
sit back and watch the world burn
and never wonder why
for all the things we've done
and all the things we've said
if i could change the future
I'd change the past instead
life after the end of the world is now
and it's coming
it's coming down
AS WE LET GO
WE WILL KNOW
THAT IT'S PAIN
AND IT'S FEAR
AND IT'S NOW
AND IT'S NEAR
life after the end of the world is now
for my love, for my hate, for my lies, for my fears
the future is near
life after the end of the world is now
for my love, for my hate, for my lies
confirm my fears, our future is clear...
