Can't stop it, it's already begun
downward spiral, suicidal addiction
never noticed, one track mind
too young to care, just a moment in time
my solution: a loaded gun
second of pain for a life of redemption
because you'll never know the reason why
when the heavens open, there's no tears left to cry
WHEN THERE'S NO WAY OUT
WHEN THERE'S NO WAY OUT
but I'll never give in, I'll never say die
drag me down as i spit at the sky
you can't be scared of what's in store
take your best shot, I'll still ask more
rise above, the only way out
just remember, we all struggle and doubt
one chance is all we get
you can forgive, but you ever forget...
WHEN THERE'S NO WAY OUT
WHEN THERE'S NO WAY OUT
I THRIVE IN HERE
is your life breaking? no longer can you feel
is your pain just too hard to conceal?
is your hate just too hard to disguise?
don't trade it all for one last goodbye
I THRIVE IN HERE
