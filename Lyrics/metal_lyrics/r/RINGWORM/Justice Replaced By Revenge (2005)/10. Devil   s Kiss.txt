Now nothing left to resist
know the bridges are burned
I'll shake your hand with my fist
you - another blood sacrifice
day in and day out, I'm growing colder than ice
INSIDE I CAN'T DESCRIBE
WHY I FEEL SO MUCH HATE
WHY I WISH YOU WOULD DIE
rise - serpent demon abyss
give me strength to move on
a fucking devil's kiss
so I'll bleed - a thousand years or more
than to be like you
society's whore
INSIDE I CAN'T DESCRIBE
WHY I FEEL SO MUCH HATE
WHY I WISH YOU WOULD DIE
CURSED TO BELIEVE IN PROPHECY
POINTLESS TO RESIST
the devil's kiss
BITTER TO THE END
MY OLD FRIEND
IT'S COME DOWN TO THIS
the devil's kiss
