BELIEVE what you believe
in what you see, for eternity
is it a god that makes you strong?
or insanity?
mighty walls crumbling down
and you're trapped inside
killing all except your kind
your faith has made you blind
YOU SAY THAT I'M LOST
SO TELL ME WHAT'S MY COST?
TO WASH AWAY MY SINS
IT'S GOD EAT GOD
now onward soldiers, holy war
it never ends, learn to see the way things are
TORN APART
are you master? are you slave?
to the one who saves
burning sky, bleeding red
in a world of walking dead
SO TELL ME WHO I AM
'CAUSE I KNOW JUST WHAT YOU ARE
JESUS CHRIST, MORNING STAR
IT'S GOD EAT GOD
burning sky, bleeding red, setting sun
IT'S GOD EAT GOD
burning sky, bleeding red
IT'S GOD EAT GOD
burning sky, bleeding red, setting sun
IT'S GOD EAT GOD
burning sky, bleeding red
IT'S GOD EAT GOD
