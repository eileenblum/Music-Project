Life's blood, your holy pride. March on christian soldier, I've already chose my side, under a bleeding sky, a million unheard cries, soulless and empty eyes, search for truth in lies and pray for the their salvation at the gates of annihilation but you're running out of time. Cause we creep and we crawl and we kill in the night hiding in plain sight, drooling for a fight ignite. A view of things of things to be. Violent energy. Sign of things to come. The battle has begun. Under a velvet sky, a million unheard cries. Your saviour suicide. So keep running for salvation in this sick and twisted nation. You aged hypocrite. You live your life down on your knees there for all to see. We crush our enemies, drive them to the sea. Crush your enemies. This is our life's blood
