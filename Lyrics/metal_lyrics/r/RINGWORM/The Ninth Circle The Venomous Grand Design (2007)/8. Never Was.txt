Cold eyes, beyond belief. The blank stare of a common thief. No heart, so don't try. Save your words, they don't apply. You want to be something you're not. It's how you earn, not what you've got I'd rather be hated for what I am, than to be loved for what I'm not for what I'm not. So play dead, bide your time ride the fence or walk your line. A war cry for losing cause has been. Never was. Never say it again cause I won't listen Never a means to an end, I won't listen. Never say it again cause I won't listen. Never a means to an end, I won't listen Cause I don't care anymore, guilt admission cause I don't care anymore, guilt admission cause I don't care anymore
