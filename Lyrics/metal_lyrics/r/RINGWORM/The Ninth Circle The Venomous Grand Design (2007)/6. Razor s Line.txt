You think you know what it's like to be alive? Well, you've never lived a day. Ever been so close to death? Ever feel it coming? The taste of your last breath ever seen the midnight sky? Ever think it'd be your last? Burning fast. Ever roll your eyes at the bells of morning mass? Come with me. Walk the razors line. Wounds look healed, but they're bleeding all the time. Follow me down. All light fades away open your eyes, face yourself. A new world starts today I tell myself that I think I can't go on, so I think I'll temp my fate for so many years, ever pray to a god you swore in blood to hate? If you see me crawling, just walk on by. What a waste. As the morning light burns bright upon my face I carry on cause it just don't mean a thing. A new days dawning life goes by so fast. Feeding desire, ignoring the past. We'll never know. The first might be the last.
