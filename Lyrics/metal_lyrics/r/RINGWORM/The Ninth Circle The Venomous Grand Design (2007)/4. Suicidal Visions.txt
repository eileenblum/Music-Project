Suicidal visions, jagged torn incisions, separate divisions - arise paranoid delusions with violent soulutions and deviant perversions - demise all I see, only for a moment, but it's still haunting me. Broken and battered and bruised to the bone. Ripping and clawing, I travel alone seeing the future, prepare for the end. Unclean in nature, your wounds will never mend. Suicidal visions, jagged torn incisions, seperate divisions arise. Mutinous defiance, treasons alliance. Your hell is my reliance - demise. Just let go, we'll meet again tomorrow, but you will never know. Save all your sorries, they don't mean a thing. To late for redemption or what it will bring. Watch what you say, it's hazardous road. Save. Ammunition, you're a long long way from home. Suicidal visions, jagged torn incisions, a well thought out decision - arise. Mutinous defiance, treasoness alliance. Your hell is my reliance - demise
