Set me free as I rise from ashes, confined in a cell with undead masses escape from my prison six feet beneath. I dug with my hands and cut with my teeth. Life, death. Rise. Again. Resurrection. Shut your mouth. You don't know what this hell is inhaling the filth and poison gases. I lived in these shadows for so many years. Swallowing pride, drinking my tears but now, I've come to see. The evil is finally free. It's killing me, opening up with the key. Opening up with the key. Life. Death. Rise. Again. Resurrect me. The crucifiction has left it's mark running from life, impaled by the dark but now, you know there's things far worse than death
