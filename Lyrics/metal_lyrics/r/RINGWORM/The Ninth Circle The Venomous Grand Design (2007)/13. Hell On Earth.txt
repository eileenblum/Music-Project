Life's slaughter, your last breath. Take all the things that we have left. No honor, fist in the sky. Crumbling down. No wonder why. That father time has abandoned us. Leave behind your incubus. An empty threat, a line in the sand. Your scorched and ugly promised land. It dies, it dies. Nightfall, darkest day. No place to turn, can't run away. God's child, favorite son. Can't undo what has been done. Look within, hate the most. Exorcise this holyghost. Can't escape, this living hell. We go where only spirits dwell. The light, but there's no light. It's hell on earth we no longer thrive. We fight to survive. No path to righteousness. No resist, necropolis calling. It's hell on earth. Crawl, beg for this. Forgivness. As cities are falling. It's hell on earth. Life's slaughter, your last breath. Take all the things that we have left. No honor, fist in the sky. Crumbling down. No wonder why. That father time has abandoned us. Leave behind your incubus an empty threat, a line in the sand. Your scorched and ugly promised land it dies, it dies it's hell on earth
