Apathy will never cease, no return, no release torn apart piece by piece black, your abyss. Let it be your dichotomy turning back the sands of time. Looking back you'll never find void of though, pain of mind. Wait to see who'll be dying at your feet. Who's dying at your feet? Doesn't matter what they do or what they say. Cause you've always find a place to run away. Coagulation, never finish. Never start as you drive another spike in your pretty little heart apathy will never cease, no return, no release torn apart piece by piece
