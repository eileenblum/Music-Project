Duplicate, oblivious, make believe again a transparent shell is all that is left in the end expendable, worthless is all you'll ever be not me - not buying what you sell not - believing what you tell fake, fraud. You never will possess you're empty inside and fake just like all of the rest so take, take, take all you can hold you're left nothing because you are bouth and you're sold shallow, living in a dream. Hallow, with no idea what it means to be alive, to bleed inside. The darkness that we ride. We ride cry, moan. Convince them it's your own Can't think for yourself. I know that you're just a clone illusion, not real. A snake that eats its tail soon it will end, I'll enjoy when you finally fail shallow - living in a dream hallow - with no idea what it means to be alive, to bleed inside
