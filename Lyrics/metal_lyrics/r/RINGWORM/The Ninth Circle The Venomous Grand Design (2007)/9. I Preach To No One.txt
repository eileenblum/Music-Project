It's nothing to watch you rot from within, so let it begin. Feel nothing for you, my brother sin. I'm drinking it in. Gaining distinction by terrible means, or so it seems, that the same tie that binds us, leads us unseen, we're never redeemed. Take me, all this never coexist, remiss. Cold and ravenous scratching the surface so much it bleeds, down on your knees lawless ambition, no gods to appease, do as I please. We do all things that you talk about, without a doubt it's never that easy as you're finding out, cut your own throat take me, all this. Growing impetus remiss, cold and ravenous. Hate me, sweet bliss cold and ravenous I preach to no one that's waiting in line I'm not the voice of the many senseless bovine I carry on as it multiplies lambs to the slaughter, I despise I see the world through the devils eyes the window to my soul, covered with flies so grovel and beg, you weak human being, wiping it clean interchangable parts in a broken machine you're all the fucking same thing
