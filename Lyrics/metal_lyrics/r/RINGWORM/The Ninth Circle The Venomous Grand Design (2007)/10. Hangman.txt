Hangman, why are you so cold? The burning desire to have what we can't hold changing direction, hangman can't you see? We hate for a reason. We sharpen our teeth strength and conviction. Heaven beneath. I've been forced to be. Return what's given to me hangman, they're all dying at your feet in circles of fire. Serpents of deceit no admiration for what I have lost in the absence of reason, I carry this cross carry this cross. In the sky I spit this venom in your path of jaded wisdom now, hangman I see. It's you. It's me the midnight sun. We are legion. We are one hangman, why are you so cold? The burning desire the have what we can't hold hangman, they're all dying at your feet in circles of fire. Serpents of deceit we hate for a reason. We sharpen our teeth strength and conviction. Heaven beneath
