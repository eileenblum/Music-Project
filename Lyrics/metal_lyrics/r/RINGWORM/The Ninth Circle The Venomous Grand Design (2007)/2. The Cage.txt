Dark inside, walls all around me. Trapping the hatred within crumbling flesh gives me power to rise as the weight of the world crushes thin. Choking, paralyzed. Drown in your wages of sin. What was innocent? Corrosion and descent. You borrowed, nothing spent. Illusion, misdirect. You're dying on the vine. You're malice well defined. Nothing left behind. You broke the ties that bind. Burn alive, never forgive. Devil inside make me new. Approaching your fate, condemned to a future. Accept it when it comes to you. To live in this cage. Dark inside, walls around me, trapping the hatred within. Crumbling flesh gives me power to rise as the weight of the world crushes thin. Word as law, callous and empty, corroded and vicious and vain. Insatiable hunger, living a lie. A life in unbreakable chains.
