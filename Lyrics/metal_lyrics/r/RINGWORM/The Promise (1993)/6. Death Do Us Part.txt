Disease
Earthly pleasures tease
Bring you to your knees you're on
Pray to my God
Beg forgiveness
Demon's con
Drink the plague straight from the cup
Baptized sex with demon slut
You
Time forgets
But I will not forgive your ignorance
You'll never see, you're blind
Your God has stole your soul
It's bought and sold
Your lord has lied
Lies, a bunch of fucking lies
Till death do us part
