Scratching
Fingers numb, knuckles raw
Bloated and fattened for the kill
Pounding
In the heart, in the hands
Cesspool of embyronic scum
Holy hands caress and savour you
But I do the things you wish you could do
The witchhunt is on
A sin of loyalty and love
The witchhunt is on
A moral switch to fuck the dove
Severed season, mass decay
It ushers in a new age
The witchhunt is on
A sin of loyalty and love
The witchhunt is on
And I'll kick and scratch and bite my way towards the sun
Scratch, I'm scratching away
And I'm scratching away at the likeness of vanity
