Urine smelling place
I'm coming
Dip for virgin's blood
It's showing
Taste of melted skin and knowing
Take it all and burn your bridges
Cover up your eyes
You can't see that there is no way
Living for tomorrow
But you can't because you fear today
Paranoid time
You're dead
You can't relax
Take your love and stick it in your ass
I've gotta go with what I know
and use my gifts from down below
And what's cold to you is warm to me
And I'll laugh
Disease will only bleed
