Pray for the day of forgiving rain
When my heart opens up in refrain
And I sleep with you in your grave
Because I am a slave to the promise
The promise
Grow, grow at a devil's pace
Oh disease of my disgrace
An empty place that slaps my face
And reminds me of the promise
The promise
Forever
Ripped apart by my spirit
Do you feel insane or is it only tissue?
The first of so many more
Time flies when it's even score
Slash and burn and find another one
I know you belong to me and that's a promise
