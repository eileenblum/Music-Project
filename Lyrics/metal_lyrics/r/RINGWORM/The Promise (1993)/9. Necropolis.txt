Dark side of white face sour
Tetanus branded in my mind
Have taste of your disease
I'm granted power over thee and thine
Execute the one who'd be king
The plague bearer shall bear his throne
I'm sickened by society
Ashamed to call this planet home
Living in the witches season
Close your eyes bow your head
Smell the air and feel the breeze
The cleansing of humanity is the chore
The instrument of destruction is the irony of holy war
Witness the end of our world
Necropolis
