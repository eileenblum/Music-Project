Your brain's a fuckin' thimble with a slow leak
Your thoughts are so fucking shallow
That a mouse couldn't drown
It makes me sick to hear the words you speak
When we both know when you talk
There's nothing underneath
So you look into my face and say
"Why do you act this way?"
You want the truth
It's sad but true
Society screwed me and so did you
Shun me cuz I'm not part of your act
Well you'll never understand what you have done
Time will tell whether you are worthy
I've touched you all in one way or another
I could show you so much more
If you'd open your eyes and your faith
Sideshow in my mind
Twisting and smashing the thorn in my side
Your innocence was lost without a trace
Stolen by a foolish embrace
I'm very good at what I do
Deep inside you know it's true
I can show you so much
Just be a part of my sideshow
