Torn apart and ripped to shreds â¢ Broken down and held by threads â¢ Hit the bottom, nothing left to lose â¢ Haunted by a faded glory â¢ My heart could tell a million stories â¢ Scars become a road map of my pain â¢ And this is the way it has to be my son â¢ Drag the bottom, sufferings not done â¢ Hear the siren, hear the marching drum â¢ The closer you get, the further it becomes â¢ Light the sky; burn the dead â¢ In the graveyard in my head â¢ So take it all, there's nothing left to kill â¢ All the cycles have begun â¢ Time erases everyone â¢ Wash away your memory â¢ With your flood â¢ And this is the way it has to be my son â¢ Drag the bottom, sufferings not done â¢ Hear the siren, hear the marching drum â¢ The closer you get, the further it becomes â¢ Cutting you down: you wrap your arms around my heart â¢ Into the ground and watch it slowly tear apart â¢ It's just the vicious circle of life â¢ There's too much pain to let it show â¢ It's just the vicious circle of life â¢ And it is time to let it go â¢ Let go
All the hate you want to feel; Justice is gone nothing is real â¢ It's gone â¢ Who am I supposed to be? â¢ What do you want from me? â¢ Feeling is absentee â¢ Emotional amputee â¢ Who am I supposed to be? â¢ What do you want from me? â¢ Nothing is ever free â¢ Is this what you paid to see? â¢ The vicious circle of life â¢ The vicious circle of life â¢ The vicious circle of life
