Throw away your life for this, dead and gone and cowardice â¢ My revenge, now it's over â¢ One more time to kill the pain â¢ Everyday I defy you â¢ Everyday it's all the same â¢ What do you do with the hate inside you? â¢ And you feel the pain and strife? â¢ What do you do with the walls around you? â¢ Or when they show the knife? â¢ No blame as I exit life, no shame as I exit life â¢ Not real, as I exit life â¢ Cold steel, as I exit life â¢ Falling down, now it's over â¢ You want to take the blame? â¢ I want to break down the walls around me â¢ You want to feel the same â¢ You tear out the heart that breaks you? â¢ I won't even try â¢ Crucified, endless martyr â¢ I don't have time to die â¢ I don't have time to die â¢ I won't live my life for this, deep inside the cold abyss
