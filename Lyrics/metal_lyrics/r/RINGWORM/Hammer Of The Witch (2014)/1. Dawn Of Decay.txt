Mutation; you bring this scar onto me â¢ Sedation; The death of what I could be â¢ Disintegration; I'm so uncontrolled â¢ We are the devils; our hearts are bought and sold â¢ Wait for the light; Shine ever bright; Fall in-between; Never-ending screams â¢ Stream; it flows like hate eternal â¢ Corrosion; Nothing to brace the fall â¢ Illumination; I'm tearing at the seams â¢ We are the devils; and things aren't what they seem â¢ Wait for so long â¢ Everything's so wrong â¢ Am I led astray? Dawning of decay â¢ I'll see when the truth corrodes; I'll bleed till the sky explodes
