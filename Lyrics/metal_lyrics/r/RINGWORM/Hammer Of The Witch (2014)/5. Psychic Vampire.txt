Give in as they mentally rape you, so what? â¢ They lie and deny, imitate you â¢ Who cares? â¢ Awaken their love, feeding frenzy â¢ Blood lust â¢ Give in and comply and I hate you, in disgust â¢ Psychic vampires suck the life from you â¢ Do as they say â¢ Do as they do â¢ The leeches they writhe as they drain you to the bone â¢ They dig with their teeth and their razors, in your flesh â¢ Inside of the body collecting â¢ Pure greed â¢ You live and you die and upon you, they feed â¢ Psychic vampires suck the life from you â¢ Do as they say â¢ Do as they do â¢ Psychic vampires constantly in pain, all in your head â¢ Crawl in your brain â¢ It's in your head and you've bled Your life goes by in a mindless bliss â¢ Sucking you dry and you can't resist
Never your own are the thoughts in your head. Killing you slow, sleep with the dead
