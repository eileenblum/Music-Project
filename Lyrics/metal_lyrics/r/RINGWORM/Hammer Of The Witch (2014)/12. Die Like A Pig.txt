Glorious the end to be, crucified in lust â¢ Curse of all thatâs left to see, fears that bend your trust â¢ Failing by your loyalty, all your heroes hung â¢ Your world means nothing to me, I don't belong â¢ Haunted by the things we did â¢ I'll never die like a pig â¢ Buried in the graves we dig â¢ I'll never die like a pig â¢ Prophecy â¢ Dystopia â¢ Lifeless we exist â¢ Razor of euphoria running down your wrist â¢ By design you build your shrines, jealousy, distrust â¢ Like a swine we fail in line, corroding into dust â¢ Haunted by the things we did â¢ I'll never die like a pig â¢ Buried in the graves we dig â¢ I'll never die like a pig â¢ Every morning I relive â¢ I'll never die like a pig â¢ Only worth what you can give â¢ I'll never die like a pig â¢ You survive believing you're alive: feeding the rest of the hive â¢ Now betrayed, believing you are saved, living your life from the grave â¢ You, drone â¢ It's not your own â¢ Cutting yourself to the bone â¢ Swine â¢ Pig â¢ You're all alone â¢ Now dig, dying like a pig We're all dying like pigs
