So much for a god in the sky â¢ He never will answer you why â¢ The reaper is coming again, but thank god, we'll always have the end â¢ To late for forgiveness, I try to let things go â¢ No room for a weakness â¢ I'll never let it show â¢ No â¢ Treacherous breaking the womb â¢ Wrapped so tight, the end becomes a tomb â¢ No hell that comes with the flood â¢ Just these words inked in tears and blood â¢ To late for forgiveness, I try to let things mend â¢ Becoming a sickness, that steals my soul again â¢ Looking for a way out â¢ Or just to comprehend â¢ To hate you for so long, that you become my friend â¢ We'll always have, always have the end
We pretend just to see it fall in the end â¢ The life exhumed, the exit wound â¢ There's no resent â¢ We always have the end
