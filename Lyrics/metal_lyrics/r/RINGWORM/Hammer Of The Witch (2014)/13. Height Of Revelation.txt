Carry on my demons â¢ Carry on, on broken wings â¢ And burn alive in heaven burn alive with all your kings â¢ Was it fate that brought you to me? â¢ Feeling is gone â¢ Blinded by the hope that would be â¢ I carry on â¢ Once again I serve two masters, living in hell â¢ Cutting out a vicious cancer â¢ No way to escape â¢ Height of revelation; open wide â¢ I feel your pain; your pain â¢ So let it fall upon me; let it fall like crimson rain Now choking tight â¢ Sacred rite â¢ Feel the anger burning bright â¢ All alone â¢ I disown â¢ And the master takes his throne â¢ Lord of Flies â¢ God of Lies â¢ As the lifeless one Baptize â¢ Prey for this, Devil's kiss â¢ Just to hear the serpents hiss â¢ Feeling is gone: I carry on â¢ Living in hell, No way to escape
