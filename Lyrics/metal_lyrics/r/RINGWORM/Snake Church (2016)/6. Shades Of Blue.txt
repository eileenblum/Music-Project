Blinded by love: the sun eclipse.
Your hair is rolling down your hips.
There on the floor, the candle drips.
I slide my fingers on your lips.
Shades of blue is my love. Shades of blue is my love.
Your kiss of death, my life unfurled.
You take me to the underworld.
And when I hear the song you sung.
I still feel your serpent tongue.
Shades of blue wither to black; a whip across your back.
And all the things I thought were true,
Are only shades of blue.
Shades of blue unworthy of. Shades of blue my true love.
Your kiss of death, your life unfurled.
My goddess of the underworld. I would give my life for you.
The beauty and the shades of blue.
Shades of blue is my love. Shades of blue is my love.
Shades of blue is my love. Shades of blue my true love.
