Help me, mother of mercy
Unleash your dog of war
Walk in the fire
A crumbling beauty no more

My liberation
My own private hell
Awaken the demons again
With your spell

A premeditation
A venomous bite
God of the new borns
The mother of all parasites

No act of defiance
Can hold back the flood
Only the spilling of innocent blood

Suffer alone
I take the pain
Open eyes
Closed fists
Never again I will remain
Open vein
Crimson flood
There's no innocent blood
