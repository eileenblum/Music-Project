obey all the fear, all the hate, all the lies | that pour feeding me | outside i feel no pain as it eats me alive | never looking back, souls of black inside | but behind these bars | eternal scars | stars | i rise to fall | canât believe in life | you show me everyday, thatâs itâs a fucking game | canât believe in always, because weâll never be the same | itâs insane | bless all this pain insane | no breaking the chain | donât believe in merry now | and iâm expecting nothing less | as this goes on forever | praying to a god of nothingness | nothingness | sun rise again is reborn | as morning song | close but so far my morning star | god bless this star | righteous: sinking: forever defeating| in blood they will bury me now | but we keep on living somehow | all i have seen and been told | life is so bitter and cold | but this itâs not so forgiving and iâm tired of living | becoming a cold empty shell; reliving this season in hell | righteous; sinking; forever; defeating | shameless; believing; endless; repeating | in blood they will bury me now | but i keep on living somehow | all i have seen and been told | life is so bitter and cold | these scars are become what i am vile reflection man | these scars eternal and cold; the scars you will never behold | as morning star | close but so far | my morning star | god bless these scars | god bless the prison bars | god bless eternal scars | god bless the death machine | god bless the things iâve seen | god bless the crimson tide | god bless the suicide | god bless the nothingness | god bless eternal bliss | god bless the prison bars | god bless eternal scars | god bless the death machine | god bless the things iâve seen | god bless the endless night | god bless the devils fight | god bless this world of ours | god bless eternal scars
