slowly fading glory; open up the gate | no one alive | to hear the story; cutting off dead weight | burning the hive | to see the ashes lighting up the sky | now that we know | the answers are lies | lies | never ending cycles; writing on the wall | killing the soul | to bring us closer; hearing of death call | bringer of light | to ease the madness or tying of the noose | beautiful sight | to see the endings come loose | angelfuck | this bloodlust | ash to dust | sick of us | no saving you ( solo: comprix ) | cry no more| my sweet whore | thereâs more time | for knowing you (solo: comprix) | scratching at the surface; scared to let me in | let me inside | to see the darkness; where iâve always been | always alone | and now itâs taken; always holding on | youâll never know | a heart so empty; because itâs gone | my precious angelfuck | sweet little angelfuck | my holy angelfuck
