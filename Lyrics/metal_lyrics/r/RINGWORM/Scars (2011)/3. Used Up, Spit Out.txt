my grave is empty now | clawing at the lid, iâm free somehow | resurrected; coffin closed | dead and lifeless; decomposed | i am the one who will see, for i am the end | i am the one that is over and over again | cutting, amputation, cast aside | killing, mutilating, open wide | and iâm ready now | as we live somehow | nothing less devout | used up, spit out | god of the faded | i am just wasting away | iâm never running, i am the one who will stay endless repetition, only friend | zero ammunition, bitter end | and iâm ready now | as we live somehow | nothing less devout | used up, spit out | spit out (solo: sorg) | outstretched hand; reaching up | touching nothing; thoughts corrupt | outstretched hand, reaching up | touching nothing, thoughts corrupt | i am nowhere, writhe in doubt | hell used me up and spit me out | never wanted to be, iâm used up, iâm used up | iâm spit out | never mattered to me, iâm used up, iâm used up | iâm spit out | what itâs like to be free, iâm used up, iâm used up | iâm spit out | now itâs so plain to see, that iâm used up, iâm used up | iâm spit out
