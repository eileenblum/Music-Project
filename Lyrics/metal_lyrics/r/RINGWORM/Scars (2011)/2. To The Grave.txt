i watch it die, i donât know why, i feel no remorse | cut out my eyes, petition the skies, a demonic force | a promise in hell, to keep you alive, to see what iâve done | tormenting me, iâll always be | father like son | another bridge to burn, can you feel it slowly turn | itâs never hard to gauge, when you see me shake rage | fracturing spine, fracturing malign | see what hurts most | my last restraint, my evil saint | this holy ghost | and as i slowly bleed | itâs the only thing need | to weather out the storm | revenge in any form | all of the hate that we carry | i choose the things that i save | drown in the wake of indifference | this is the hate that i take to my grave | this is the hate that i will take unto my grave
