welcome the ending, a victimless crime | as itâs cutting and ripping and tearing inside | how can i see with the blood in my eyes? | there is no love, iâll rejoice when it dies | no blinding light, blinding light; just reaping what you sow | eternal scar; eternal scar; iâll never let it go | iâll burn this place; burn this place; burn it to the ground | spread the ashes; hopelessly hellbound (solo: sorg) | hopelessly hellbound | why should we pay for the sins of the father | washing away with the blood of the martyr we are the bringers of deaths mating call | and itâs hunting and killing and raping us all | forever i carry this curse
