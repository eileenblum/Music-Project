NOW live with this, SWORN malevolence, forged in DOMINANCE | another albatross, another burning cross | iâm following the lost | blind us, for this is how we live, excommunication, when thereâs nothing left to give | weâre driven by our demons and youâre cowering in fear | welcoming the fleeting light | screaming, death is near | no glory, no envy, just this FALLING DOWN | waiting to begin alter built for sins | another scar within | i see all my visions turn to dust, raise my flag of freedom, when thereâs no one left to trust | death by slow attrition, a cleansing of the fall | so send me all your angels | and iâll try to kill them all | albatross | cry out for treason, whatever the reason | taking your turn, excepting your fate | we are now legion, violent season | the future is now, destroy or CREATE ALBATROSS | death by slow attrition | a cleansing of the fall | so send me all your angels | and iâll try to kill them all | KILL THEM ALL | cleansing of the fall
