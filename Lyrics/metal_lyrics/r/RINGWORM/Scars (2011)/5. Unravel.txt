i never realize, what is left inside my head | and burned inside these eyes | never looking back in spite of pride | and suicide is no safe bet | no message from the other side | why whole world starts to unravel;
UNRAVEL | and iâm never going back | as my life unravels: UNRAVELS |itâs never what it seems, anything to kill the pain | by any fucking means | tearing at the flesh, i grind my teeth | pulling back
the shredding skin to see whatâs underneath | my whole world starts to unravel; UNRAVEL | and iâm never going back | as my life unravels; UNRAVELS | broken and left alone, i take what i can and i have no faith at all, in my fellow man | iâve been here a million times, you know thatâs true | so never flatter yourself, itâs not because you | my whole world start to unravel; UNRAVEL | and iâm never going back as my life unravels; UNRAVELS | AS MY LIFE UNRAVELS
