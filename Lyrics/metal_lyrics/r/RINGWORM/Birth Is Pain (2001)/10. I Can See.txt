Illumination, now I can see
God damn these eyes
In isolation, drowning in all the tears you've cried
So what is the difference? So what if this hate is rotting my soul?
I live for the chaos, I live for pain I can't control
Isolate, inside alone
Imitate, I've found my home
I'll fight till the finish
I'll fight till the sun sets on this heart
So what is the difference?
Can you see? It's tearing me apart
Isolate, inside alone
Imitate, I've found my home
Running, burning, lying, dying
Slowly crawling back inside my grave
