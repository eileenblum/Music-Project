Whore, never again like before
Your actions are hard to ignore
Your body was found in a ditch
With maggots and scars on your wrists
Swollen wrists, black and blue
Broken off inside of you
Crumbled dreams, dollar whore
Pressure is making me sick, oh you bitch
Seek any escape you can find
To get away out of your mind
Screaming out of control
You've become just a hole
Swollen wrists, black and blue
Broken off inside of you
Crumbled dreams, dollar whore
You just keep on asking for more
Bitch
Cannot cleanse your soul
Burn with me below
Innocent no more
Just a fucking whore
