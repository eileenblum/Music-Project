The more things change, the more they stay the same
The demons keep calling my name
Again and again and again
Hate's spiraling kiss, destroys sanity's bliss
We'll see who regrets this, when you kneel at the altar
No beginnings, no end
Again and again
It's all the same
Again and again
Eternal flames
Again and again
An icepick in my brain
Rise incubus, scream
Frozen in my dreams
Now on your knees pig and kneel at the altar
No beginning, no end
Again and again
It's all the same
Again and again
Eternal flames
Again and again
An icepick in my brain
