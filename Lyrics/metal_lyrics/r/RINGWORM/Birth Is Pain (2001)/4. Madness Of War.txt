These peaceful times won't last, can't release the past
Carry on a violent trend, pain and suffering of man
Consuming all, war machine, impaled heart of nazarene
Madness of war
Lashing out, shed my skin, waiting for it to begin
Except the fate that we choose realize that we all lose
Writhe in torment from below
Take my hand to hell we go
Carry on a violent trend, pain and suffering of man
Consuming all, war machine, impaled heart of nazarene
By the godly grace of war
Cleanse this world we're dying for
Downward we go, spirals of war
Life in remiss
We've lost the right to exist
