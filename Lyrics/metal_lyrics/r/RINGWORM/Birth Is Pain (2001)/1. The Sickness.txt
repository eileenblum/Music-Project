Give me the keys to this cage, I have been bleeding for days
I feel the end is coming soon and I feel impending sense of doom
Suicide, it's dead in my eyes, bleeding
Open wide, this these gates that hide inside and dominate
Crossover, blind with hate
Left promising, with nothing left as I grind my teeth into fangs
Feel how they bite
Loneliness, my home my sweet caress and down inside
Life over-filled with pride and dominant
Corrosion, de-create
Left promising, with nothing left as I grind my teeth into fangs
Grind my teeth into fangs
And the sickness remains
Grind my teeth into ....
