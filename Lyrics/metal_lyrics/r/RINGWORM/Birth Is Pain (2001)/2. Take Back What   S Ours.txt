Resist; conform, broken down, joining the norm
We're not sheep of the lord, and we must
Rise up and take back what's ours
Writhing, seething, crawling
And for what? Our rights are withheld
We're fuckin' lost, authority kept at all cost
Bitter end, destroy the message they send
Martyrs plea, can't silence me
Held down, sedated
Blood red, coagulated
As your dreams sour,
we'll rise up and take back what's ours
