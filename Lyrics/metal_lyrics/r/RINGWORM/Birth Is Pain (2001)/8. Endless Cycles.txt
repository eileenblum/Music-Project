There's no religion
To explain my lies
There's not one reason
Only desperate times
So the worst is over
Only just begun
My time of suffering
That makes me feel as one
Don't care - too late to cry
Persist - with your alibis
No way - you can leave this time
Captured and still bleeding
Configuration, how the pieces fit
Moral inquisition, inner conflict
Regressing slowly, as I fall between the seems
Scar tissue cannot mend an incurable disease
Endless cycles
