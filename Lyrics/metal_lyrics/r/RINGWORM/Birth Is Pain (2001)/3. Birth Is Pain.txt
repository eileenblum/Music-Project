Birth is pain, hunger's insatiable
Lies, greed, stain. It's unattainable
Blind my eyes, I can't see
Growing slowly inside of me
Total domination
Don't ask how.One more day we're down and out
Spoken words, forgive, forget
Then heal my scars, past regrets
Total domination
Time is now; Armageddon's coming ....
Birth is pain, hunger's insatiable
Lies, greed, stain. It's unattainable
It will never let me be, the seed that grows inside of me
If it is forgive, forget, then heal my scars, my past regrets
Total devastation of the world around
As Armageddon's coming down
Now, release, upon this world, your rage
Rage, rage, rage
They tell us that "jesus saves"
The truth is that we're born unto our graves
Release, upon this world your rage because
Birth is fucking pain
