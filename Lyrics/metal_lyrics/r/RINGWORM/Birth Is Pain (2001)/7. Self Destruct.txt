Self-destruct, watch me self-destruct
Confusing visions are all that last,
Brutal reminders of a jaded past
Steel foundation is crumbling down
Shot in the head, buried underground
Return the love or return the pain
I'll do anything to make me sane
Enclosing darkness is all I see, serving my demons
Do you know what it means?
And I self-destruct, watch me self-destruct
When I awake I relive this day, a contradiction in every way
The combination of sand and time
Minute by minute it's eating my mind
So return the love or return the pain,
Do anything to make me sane
It's so dark now that I can't see
Wheel of emotions is swallowing me as I self ...
Please release me from this hell I'm in
Caustic burning reveling in sin until I
Suffocate
And self-destruct
Finally I've way out
Self-destruct
