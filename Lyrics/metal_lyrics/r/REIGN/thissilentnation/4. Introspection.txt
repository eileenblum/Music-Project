Harken oh father await my death
Caress my mind as you pretend

Afraid of dying look within myself

Harken oh lover leave my dream
Seeing through your vacant stares

Watching myself begin to drift away
Feelings of value lost
Memories of a burning past begin to fade
I try to find myself, my inner core

Express your ideals as cubic you revolve
External life reveals your thoughts to dissolve

Only to approach a goal of years and why..
... to die!!

Bleeding, searching, blinded
Drowning in a sea of tears

Bleeding following a million fears
Searching, drowning in a sea of tears
