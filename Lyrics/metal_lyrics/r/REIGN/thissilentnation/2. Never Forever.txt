Descending a pathway light into deep
I feel emotions rise
Consciousness, a concept entwining
In the abyss, a moment forever

Searing, hearing, feeling, fearing
Derange my mind
Subconsciousness, I am it's slave
I wonder is there any way
Why am I here

Dream in your dream
Pleasure is pain
Condescending emotions
Perspective in decay
Close my eyes, lay to rest
Abstract tales control
Fantasising premonitions
A message to my soul

Blinded by sleep, second sight
Joyous land awaits
No control over circumstance
A chance to love your hate
The things we dream, interpretation
A fortune but surreal
Awaken from this consciousness
To what we believe is real
