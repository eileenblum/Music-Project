No questions why we live a lie
Within the web of false belief
Are we just fools by our own rules
Upon a trail of cold deceit

What words define this state of mind
Where nothing can make total sense
A world insane, it feels no pain
Yet scared to meet it's bitter end

Extraction from reality
Turn to face insanity
Extraction from reality
My longest hour

Where am I now?
My longest hour
Head first into controlled fate
First to go, last to know
And pay the price for being late
Victim of a chase, one sided race

A fight with time, the war of minds
Am I the enemy within

My longest hour
