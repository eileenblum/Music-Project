Anger fills this world do bitterness
Despair is just a factor of life

Remorse for a world devoid of feeling
Cry for a way of change

No conformity
Sick society
No conformity
Forlorn existence

Despondency arising from dependency
Hopelessness is just a symptom of decay

Harmony arising from the anarchy
The seeds of evil must be stopped
Before they can be reaped
