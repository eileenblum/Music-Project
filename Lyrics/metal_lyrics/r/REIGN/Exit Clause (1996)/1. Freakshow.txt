Defenseless to adapt to the unknown
Functions without wires or control

Awaken the senses within
Cycle of life to begin
Born to die young

Absorbing colours, tension and withdrawal
Systematic reflex poised to fall

Awaken the senses within
Cycle of life to begin
Awaken the senses within
Destined to never win
Born to die young

Helpless, helpless
Innocence wonât by sympathy
Face the world alone

Helpless, helpless
Tune away from what you see
Better you donât know

Chastise the freak

Ridicule the weak
Unprotected product of misguided faith
Lives and breaths, a reminder a mistake
Born into suffering
