I, alone, drift lost in time
No words can express this tranquility of mind

Release myself from the human disease

Time to live, not hid behind
A chance to escape the inhibitions of the mind

I, alone, drift lost in time
No words can express this tranquility of mind
Time to live, not hide behind
A chance to escape the inhibitions of the mind

Painted smiles on a painted face
A jesterâs mask to hide your hate
To live like you, within such confines
Just to live by numbers is to waste your life

By your own admission, something is missing
Your time just fading away
Your life, like religion, makes your decisions
Society is fucking your brain

Outside the world keeps turning
No one cries for yesterday
Inside the mind in turmoil
Tomorrow is a year away
Outside the world keeps turning
No more fears within have I
Inside the mind in turmoil
I donât have to reason why
