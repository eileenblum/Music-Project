Subdivide my point of view
Subdivide my understanding
I canât describe the hate I feel

Inside intense frustration
Seal it away

Disconnect, disconnect
Force fed words of intellect
Disconnect, disconnect
From normality
Disconnect, disconnect
Pervade my mind in disrespect
Disconnect, from me

Some things never change
Your concepts of my being
Regression

Disconnected
My frustrations, what am I to you ?
Disconnected
Whereâs the answers ?  No one sees the truth
Disconnected
My frustrations, what am I to you ?
Disconnected
