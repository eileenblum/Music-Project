Look around at the sullen skyline
Forlorn figures, their lives merely enduring pain
Submissive, subversive, meaningless icons of progress
Forever failure, there is nothing, I believe in nothing

We crawl across a bed of nails
Just to prove that we believe
That destiny is somehow intertwined with this reality
Beyond the grave is nothing we can comprehend
I believe in nothing

Searching for my release

As dusks fall upon this transient existence
Fear drives belief
A need for some great cosmic comforter
There is no salvation coming from the sky
We cannot comprehend beyond the immediate
Death is the only conclusion
There is nothing, I believe in nothing
