A plastic man with a plastic mission
To save your wretched soul from sin
Converge upon your weaknesses
A mental crutch to stand against you

To live just to die
In faith bound helpless
In death as in life
Your search is endless

Book of Mormon, the book of shit
The plates of brass are worthless
Forbidding the advancement of science
Advocating the suffering of the blinded
Martyred at the hands of a messiah
A messiah who preaches only death
Logic branded as ignorance
Their mission to cleanse the human race

Selling your god
