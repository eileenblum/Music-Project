Isolate: To place in  a detached position;
To place apart or alone to insulate;
To separate or segregate; To disconnect

Caution tension slow descending
Downward spirals never ending

Isolation, the state of being isolated

Reckless thoughtless condemnation
Hidden guilt in isolation

Nightfall softly to enclose me
In its arms the unknown hold me
Caution tension slow descending
Downward spirals never ending

Lucid, quiet non-believing
Across the miles so slow revealing
Reckless thoughtless condemnation
Hidden guilt in isolation
Warnings: Fears exist without me
Feel the world close in around me
In but out may I transcend
Powerless to the journeys end
