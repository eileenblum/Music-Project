Anger, fills this world of bitterness
Despair is just a factor of life
Remorse, for a world devoid of feeling
Cry, for a way of change

No conformity
Sick society
No conformity
Forlorn existence

Despondency arising from
Dependency
Hopelessness is just a
Symptom of decay

Harmony arising from anarchy
The seeds of evil must be stopped
Before they can be reaped
