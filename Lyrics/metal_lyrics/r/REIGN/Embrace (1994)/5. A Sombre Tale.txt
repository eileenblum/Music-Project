This man a putrid wretch of knots
Whom limps among his fellow trees
He is a lonely of woes and yet
Forgotten, he's trampled: as he pleas

This thing a storm expressed by doubt
He hurts, used by moralities cause
It is a wicked way to learn, and yet
Excused, he's punished: for his flaws
