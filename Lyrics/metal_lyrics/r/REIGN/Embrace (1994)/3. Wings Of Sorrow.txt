I look, and wonder why
This world of ours
Has come so far into the
Clutches of this "progress"
As disease is cured, our race finds another
Through methods known as
Foolish through the years and years
Of past
As criminals are freed to kill

Another individual who then
Becomes statistics on a 
Bureacratic file
As justice cries, it folds
We feel society turn
To ways barbaric from the
Ancient ways of old

We ride upon the wings of sorrow
We sail the stormy sea
We ride upon the wings of sorrow
Into our destiny

See me, I'm a different kind
Outcast of society
Infirm of mind

As I gaze upon society
It fills me with despair
Our leaders worship guns and missiles
Messengers of death
And citizens but pawns in
Politicians' foolish acts
The ones to blame are hidden
Too scared to face the ones
Who gave their life
Who cares? It's time to take a stand
Through peace and love
The world can reach Eden again
it's time to stop the foolish wars
And pray for lasting peace
Pray the world will never
Ride the sullen wings again
