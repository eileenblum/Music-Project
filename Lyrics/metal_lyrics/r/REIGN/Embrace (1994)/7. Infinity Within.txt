No questions why, I live a lie
Within this web of false belief
Am I a fool, by my own rules
Upon a trail of cold deceit?

What words define this state of mind
Where nothing can suppress what's real
A world insane, can't hide my pain
Too weak to say just what I feel

Extraction from reality
Turn to face insanity
Extraction from reality
My longest hour

Where am I now?
My longest hour
Don't know just what's eating me
It hurts to show, I can't let go
The hardest part is breaking free
And for those who care, I'm never there

A fight with time, this war of minds
Am I the enemy within?
