Sucking in obscurity
So real the touch of sound
Fill my lungs with purity
Inhibition breaking down

I control the nevermore
I'm immune, I am free
I control forever more
No matter what they say

I am the drug that's been
Twisting your brain
Sucking the feelings, feeding the flame
Locked inside where the truth is lies
Locked inside I control your mind
Searing fear through it

And on the edge of infinity
Can't make the final choice
Old faces born clean into me
Just names without a voice

Look, changes taking over me
Numbed in the quiet you
Just a face in a dream
Laughing voices cutting
Through the silence
Time, has no meaning for me
Peeling back the colors
Doors, open up my world of sound
Transport me from one life to another
