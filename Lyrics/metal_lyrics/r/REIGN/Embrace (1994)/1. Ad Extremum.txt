Can't decide, for who am I?
Don't penetrate my thinking
All has changed, I've broke the chains
The ship of fools is sinking

And I inside this tortured mind?
A new life is emerging
Seems so unreal, I'll never feel
Normality returning

Time just slips away

Melt away, an unbalanced state
Goodbye to moral living
Frozen time, I walk the line
To reach a new beginning

Land of dreams or so it seems
I love this brain pollution
Just to know I've no control
Amid this much confusion

Open mind sensation
feel it kicking in
Open mind sensation
Feel the madness begin

Beyond the bounds of memory

Se things all my way
Feelings torn away
See things all my way
Nothing stays the same
See things all my way
Feelings torn away
See things all my way
Time to face the change

Take me, alone, these things
I've never known
Take me, alone, through
Doors of fear
Take me, away, new place
Where I can stay
Take me, away, where
Everything is clear
Take me, alone, these things
I've never known
Take me, alone, through
Doors of fear
