Intentional devotion brings
Me to unconsciousness
A love of fear inspires me
Into permanent distress
Dialectics point the finger
Each to choose their cause
A diablerie of influence
And logic is no more

I grasp the tangling threads
That fall before me
I fade away
Striving for what can never be
I fade away

To edify that which lies far ahead
As foolish men believe
But destiny lies deep within ourselves
Confusion is a burden that
We carry to the grave
Effacement of my personality
