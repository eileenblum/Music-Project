[Bonus Track]

You're my gold, you're my queen
The image of all I need
The beginning of my new life
And the blood for my Herat
But you always seem so faraway
Twisted thoughts are getting harder

Free my body from this awful pain
Free my soul from the shame

We should go on, never give up
Follow the road, together we'll be strong

THERE'S A LIGHT
AT THE END O THE PATH
WE'RE WALKING THROUGH
WE'LL REACH IT, UNTIL THEN
JUST KILL ME IN MY DREAMS

Hear me again
I won't betray you, I couldn't do
That's a thing I've got for sure
But I don't kno if I can trust
In your words, in your acts
And you're always sor faraway
And my thoughts tur to mandes
Pleas don't harm me cause I'll never stand
Don't pus me to the edge

I don't forget our destiny
Maybe this is all that ever should be
Pleas don't hurt me,
Cause I wouldn't stand
Be always by my side
Don't let me alone
Only kill me in dreams
