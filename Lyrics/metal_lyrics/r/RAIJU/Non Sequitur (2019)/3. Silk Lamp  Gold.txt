The answers live and die with me.
I found the key to a place kept far from prying eyes.
She emerges and she's beautiful, unknowable.
Liberate and follow where she leads.
Follow where she leads.

Lure me to the waterfall.
Show me things that I cannot unsee.
Letting go is impossible.
By silence of mind and the will to create,
As the goddess reminds that eternity waits

Why doesn't anybody listen,
When we already know.
Like children laughing at the boundaries.
We've got so far to go.

The truth might hurt, but wounds will heal.

Through the pain I heard her say,
Immortality is only fingertips away and I see,
That the stone beneath the waves,
Hides itself in doubt and whispers,
Showing me what hides behind the eye.

Why doesn't anybody listen when we already know.
Like children laughing at the boundaries,
We've got so far to go.

The truth might hurt, but wounds will heal.
The truth might hurt, but wounds will heal.

I follow her road, a path made of silk and gold.
I follow her road, I follow her road.

Stay with me. Stay with me, won't you stay with me?
Stay with me. Stay with me, won't you stay with me?

Showing me what hides behind the eye,
Memory of all my former lives.
Showing me what hides behind the eye,
Deity hiding within mind.
