Just fractured light (spilling off our carousels).
Allows us to trust each others' spines (Animus Divine).
Still bundled up (cutting down through the coats of rust).
Yet lost in the limestone, I silhouetted out these notes.

Descending to these eyes I've known.
As I grow old, asking time what will they show.
This saline has refused to meld with sound.
So when it's safe and sound, I'll see you both in the ground.

Be sure to stoke the flames,
And scribble out their pathetic childish useless names.
