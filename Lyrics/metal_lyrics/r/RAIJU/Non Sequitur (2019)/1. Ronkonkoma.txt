No truth can be lost forever.
Only concealed, one day to be revealed.
The tides of change, they wash away the unexplained
Filling empty hands with what remains.

Feel the weight lift away, as the lies evaporate.
No more pacified by the promised ever after.
We're here and now, the sun shines down
And exhumates, resurrecting from the underground.

Break with outdated tradition,
And reclaim your freedom.
Singing abnegation revelation.
Welcome the light.

Their past becomes their future.
We'll find our own way home,
On the path that knows
No hope in idolizing
Forms misleading in their deaf repose,
So we break away the thorns from rose.

(Rose) We are fed punishment always fearing for the
(End) So our lives, so confined, never speak with the divine.
One day, when their altars will fall and crumble to the
(Earth) a fallacy to burn
Endless returns.

Welcome the light.

No truth can be lost forever.
Only concealed, one day to be revealed.
The tides of change, they wash away
The unexplained, and what remains
Will fill their empty hands with fuller hearts and able brains.

Feel the weight lift away as the lies evaporate.
No more pacified by the promised ever after.
We're here and now, the sun shines down
And exhumates resurrecting from the underground.

Their past becomes their future.
We'll find our own way home,
On the path that knows.
No hope in idolizing.
Forms misleading in their deaf repose,
So we break away the thorns from rose.

Their past becomes their future.
We'll find our own way home.
On the path that knows.
Their past becomes their future.
We'll find our own way home
Find our own way home.
