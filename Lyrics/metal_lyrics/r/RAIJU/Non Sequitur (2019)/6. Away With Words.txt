I have never had my way
Away with words.
Now I remember days where I just felt insane
And loved the pain.
You're wasting eternity believing the worst in me.
While the march of the days takes you farther away.
Listen to me.

Light floods, see again the sun.
Light floods, bitterness undone.
Grand designs release me from the mire.
Let forgiveness guide us to the shore

Away with words.
What we define loses its worth.
Away with words.
Old thoughts confine us.
Away with words.
Death of desire is rebirth.
Away with words.
Make peace with her

Way down. Way down hereâ¦.

The balance can end the tragedy.
The poison will pass without harm
(You'll see).

(Minds to grow)
Grow fallow fields once more.
Grow fallow fields once more.
Let the march of days take you far away,
And the balance restore your harmony.
An eternity spent in tragedy.
Let the balance restore this memory.
