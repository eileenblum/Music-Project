Numb, twilight promenade
Stumble in the rain
Pitying the roll of the die I've thrown.
On my own.
On my own.

This night, so silent, I fill with arias,
To mourn the death of honor and damn the murderers.
I know your bargain
I don't accept the terms.
(Walk away)

Strangle the sacred.
All your crimes have gone unpunished and I am the exile.
Made unclean by what I've seen
Now who can purify me?

Gone - all the innocence I protected.
Mendacious viruses have killed them in their home.
And I chase away the memory
One drink at a time, itâs alright
In righteous rebellion it's always just one drink at a time.

Fight for the futile.
I can't tell myself the lies I'd need to walk a step with you.
I don't need your bribes, I'll just keep what is mine.
Just keep pretending that your choices here will come with no consequence.

I played the fool, obeyed the rules.
The theft of everything ensued.
And once again, see empty hands
The price I pay for following my conscience

Heed the quiet heart,
And refuse to concede
To the den of thieves,
Before they drag me under.

At the bottom of their malice, sunk down by ill-won prize,
I'll become the thing that I despise.
If the odds are stacked against me, and I can only lose.
I'll still play my hand, best I can. My own man.
Head held high and incorruptible.
On my own.
