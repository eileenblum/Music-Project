In doubt, I succumb, failing life
Bound in weathered skin.
All the torment I've known, the crippling cold
To focus on a soon-entombed gaze.
The heart that was shared, was it ever really there?
Grows toxic with time.

I'm colorblind
But does the light truly shine?

Erased from life, it'll be too late to hear my cries
(love us)

Reaching in deeper than I have experienced,
Trying to let love
Forgive myself in all my irreverence
Trying to let love...

Hold on to hope.
It's alright, alone tonight.
Reside by candlelight (love us)

Reaching in deeper than I have experienced,
Trying to let love
Forgive myself in all my irreverence
Trying to let love...

My world's falling down.
Black out the sun.

Soon everyone will know
Welcome to the freak show.
Weighed down by thoughts of fear to fail.
I've been deceased before I let myself breathe.

I know it seems like a pitiful thing,
Still holding on by the skin of my teeth.
As it beckons, I can't deliver myself from my past.
Deliver myself from my past to save my pride
Or what is left.
I keep it all locked up inside.
Locked safely inside.
To save my pride
Or what is left
I keep it all
Locked
Safely inside.
