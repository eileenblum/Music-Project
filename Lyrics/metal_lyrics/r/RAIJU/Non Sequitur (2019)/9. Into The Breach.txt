Just gimme the weapon.
Get out of the way.
I'll do it my-goddamned-self 'cause you're too scared to die today.
Cower in the corner
Your secret's safe with me.
You'll take the accolades when I vanquish the enemy.

I peel back the lines just one blow at a time.
Live the lie, when I die, steal my legacy.
I live on the front lines
Favored by angry gods.
Succeed me on the throne, your crown weighed down by albatross.
I'll face the nightmare.
Stay hid inside your dream.
So useless on the day of wrath and reckoning.

It is beyond comprehension.
Choosing security.
I'll trade my life for eternity

As they fear me, pushing through the pain and misery.
I have learned that outside your cage I'm free.
All you'll see in your reflection isn't true.
For you know that this greatness wasn't you.

Eight times fallen, nine times rise.
False glory fades as your soul begins to retrograde.
And on the deathbed, a spirit cannot rest,
That traded luxury for sins left unconfessed.

In war and peace we die
You chose the coward's life.
A soul dissatisfied
All cowards live this life.

It is beyond comprehension.
Choosing security.
I'll trade my life.
I'll trade my life for eternity

As they fear me, pushing through the pain and misery.
I have learned that outside your cage I'm free.
All you'll see in your reflection isn't true for you know that this greatness it wasn't you.

If you feel fear, then fear will feed
Ascendants arise in bravery.
'Cause if you fight, you'll never die.
I'm still alive.
