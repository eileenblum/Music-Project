Dear love,
There's something too dear for us to sacrifice.
I know the price for such egregious cries,
But my mindset's failed to accept these lies.
We've bowed to unholy men, now they hear me as they kneel.
One hand wondering why, the other one sailing ships to the sky.
Breeding out. God, why even try?
The world is blind to your deafening cries.

Our thoughts were picked from a hive.
Another free thought left out to die.
Rip off the veils and open your eyes.
We've sent our children off to a lie.
Strangers return to see what I've wrote.
I'll plead out with every tear down my throat.
Are we the outcasts of society?
Or are there others who think like me?
Remembering it's only skin...
They break through the clouds
Flee with me, insanity is staying here on your damn knees.
Psycho-cybernetic lies, we're all gonna die!
(I'm down here)
Pay no mind! Not this time.
Your world will now accept the line.
I revoke, through cannon smoke.
The ends are justified.
I'm through giving up, through giving up,
I'll never give up again.
These memories of you die with me.
Impossible is just a word small men throw around.
Who find it easier to live in a world that they've been given,
Than to explore the power they have to change it.
Impossible is not a fact, it's an option.
Look it straight in the eye. Grab it. Now we must decide,
Do we have the strength and the bravery of society to release this demon trapped in me?
We haven't begun to understand.
Like cybernetic beings torn worlds away.
Let's open up design and misery.
Show me what's there to become one.
Illuminate your room just like the sun.
Love, have we forgotten that his eyes are kin?
From nowhere to now here
I am only justifying lies
For I am, that I am.
We have never witnessed my life
Idle hands, devil's land.
Ego so embarrassed by death.
Death and life are undone by tongue.
