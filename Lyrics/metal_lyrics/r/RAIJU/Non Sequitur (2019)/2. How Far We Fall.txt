Heeding what the prodigal son would say.
I take what I want and I lay beyond what you're worth.
Not a man, but a god that's in the palace of satisfaction.
Speaking out from the side of my mouth when I let go, so let go.
I'd rather die than be barely alive.
You're gonna die livin' nine to five.

Feed the innocent to the fire
(one day they'll learn)
In this game where pawns all burn.
Take the birthright of my kin standing on the backs of mortals
(that'll make him proud)
(He returns).
He is silent, downcast, hollow. Not the path I sought to follow.
How far we fall
(Who are you?)

Won't you take it away.
This pride that remains.
I'll tell you everything.
This bridge isn't built to burn.
Every day, these questions evaded tell you everything
The lessons you've yet to learn.

Putting blade to back if I want to
(Et tu, Brute?)
When I see that you do not what you say.
What of your gold?
(I let it go)
What of your lies?
(I let it die)
Your dreams did not survive

Won't you take it away,
This pride that remains
I'll tell you everything
This bridge isn't built to burn
Every day, these questions evaded tell you everything .
I'll tell you, I'll tell you everything.

Heeding what the Prodigal Son would say.
I've run, I've lost, I've lived to pay the cost,
And my past shows me the madness in the future of your thoughts.
And now I see, the only remedy, turning doubt into belief,
To set my brother free
His blood is the key.

He is smiling, high and mighty, hand of iron, I cast to thee.
How far we fall.
(Who are you?)
Et, tu Brute? You are traitor, you are monster, I condemn thee.

(Fray your ties)

Hell awaits you.
Avarice.
Ignorance.
