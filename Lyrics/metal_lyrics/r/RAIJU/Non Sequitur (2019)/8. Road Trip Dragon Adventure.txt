Try to blot it out, in with the crowd,
Ink dry and the money down
But, fuck, what do I know?
Muting out the sound, and now I'm found,
Picked up what you're putting down.
How 'bout you?
Fill the cup when love is gone,
And commitment earns its name.
In the thick of it, and I'm sick of it.
Try to blot it out, I never found, this part of me.
Drowned in water,
Bound in sin.
Doubt he makes it.
Never swims.
On the rocks we
Wait for shore.
Glass half empty,
Drink some more.
Fill me up when love is gone, and commitment earns its name.
Where's the audience for the hobbyists?
Try to blot it out. I never found, this part of me
Drowned in water,
Bound in sin.
Doubt he makes it.
Never swims.
On the rocks we,
Wait for shore.
Glass half empty,
Drink some more.
When the weight of the deafening silence and promises break you in two,
Forward
When the fall guy's the person you need,
I could do great at that too.
Forward
We've been lying here, feeling, dying here.
Conversation is the missing chaser.
Feeling clouds appear
Happens every year
Drunken horses and painted pictures.
Forwardâ¦
We will rise.
With a glass half gone, I'm halfway gone.
Blotting out the sound,
And now I'm found.
Ink dry and the money down.
Blotting out the sound,
And now I'm found
