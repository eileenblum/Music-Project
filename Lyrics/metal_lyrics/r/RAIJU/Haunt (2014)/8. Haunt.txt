If you follow me
To the depths of the sea
Where the light don't shine through,
No, nothing shines through
Except for the light from the white of her belly

I hope you care
All that you can

If you follow me to the dark of this cave
Where the bats are hanging
No one's sleeping
Forever we stay awake
Because

The days are gone when we're just following the haze
No control, no control
We're losing our way
And now I realize just what I misplaced
What I've missed
The days are gone when we're just following our haze

So follow me
I just can't wait to leave you
I just can't wait to leave this all behind

I hope you care ('cause you wanted)
All that you can (So follow)
I hope you care
Follow me, follow me
Into oblivion
Follow me
Follow me

I couldn't, I couldn't breathe

We took the high road to oblivion
Only to suffocate the love we made

I couldn't, I couldn'tâ¦
You thought we'd never know
No one ever knows

Put on a tight dress
Tonight we contest it
I'm so fucking high, it's like I've been resurrected
Tiptoe the waistline, never regret it
Never regret it

And you always said to put the best foot forward
And you always wore the bravest face for me
And you always said to put the best foot forward
And you always wore the bravest face for me
And you always said to put the best foot forward
And you always wore the bravest face for me
