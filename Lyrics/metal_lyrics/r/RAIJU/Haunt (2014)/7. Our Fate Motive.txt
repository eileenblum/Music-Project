Making promises we couldn't, keeping promises we shouldn't
Making promises we couldn't keep
Making promises we couldn't, keeping promises we shouldn't
Making promises we couldn't keep
A thousand times until I realize to appreciate
The beauty of our violence

Once our lives are divided
Beyond this plane
Vessel unseparated, separated, it's not fair
These ends calculated each step we take
It's OK to mistake
As my word is, as my word is mine to break
You're not holding me hostage

Stricken with grief, she's remembering all the good times
Beyond her ebony seat, but was it love that was sacrificed?
And, from the grave, you can hear her calling and calling
There's just no way this is any way to live
Any way to live

A thousand times until I realized to appreciate the beauty
Appreciate the beauty of our violence
Is this any way to live?

Save yourself
The pasture's always greener here on the other side
On the inside
Our padded, windowless walls

You've become too courageous
And this apathy is all I need to keep me from going insane

Waiting for the end, we shouldn't be here
We're all just waiting
For the end
We shouldn't be here

A thousand times until I realize to appreciate

Making promises we couldn't, keeping promises we shouldn't
Making promises we couldn't keep
Making promises we couldn't, keeping promises we shouldn't
Making promises we couldn't keep

If only we appreciated more than our speech
We've been going too far, too fast
We've embraced the times that wouldn't last
And the pasture, it seems, is greener on the other side
There's just no way this is any way to live

The pasture's always greener here on the other side
On the inside
Our padded, windowless walls
And if you've ever seen her, you'll never leave her side
And neither will I
