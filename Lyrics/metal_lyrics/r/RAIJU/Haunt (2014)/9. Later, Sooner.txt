[Bonus Track]Broken again
Can you feel it?
Passion of wanting what you can't have
Caution gets thrown to the wind

Wants on wings take flight
If only for tonight
In these dreams, soliloquy
Deliver the final blow

Sooner or later
You'll find the ones you think you know are not the ones you think you know at all

It's always been a risk, a risk we couldn't take
But our paths never shared the same fate
You seem so surprised
Don't you seem so surprised
As we're watching each sunset from the safety of our home

Dear 2010
Got you just out of my distance
While can't afford letting go of anything that we've suffered for
I've seen this view
Apart from what I knew
In these dreams, soliloquy
Deliver the final blow

In these dreams, soliloquy
Deliver the final blow

Sooner or later
You'll find the ones you think you know are not the ones you think you know at all
At all
Are not the ones you think you know at all
