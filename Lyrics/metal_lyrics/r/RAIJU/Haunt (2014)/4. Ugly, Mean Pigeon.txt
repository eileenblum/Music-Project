Searching for an angel
To spread her wings and douse the flames
It burns, it burns
She caught me on a cloud, dancing
She caught me on a cloudâ¦

Take into frame
Images of evangelical piety
Drink from the wine
To taste the blood
And I think I feel contagious
Now I'm rising from the fire
Ignited, we'll never have to drink again

I'm counting the silver lines

Lost amongst the separation of love
We've castrated our innocence to break the mold, as usual
I feel paranoia seeping through my skin
Confessionals, they have me wondering who's ready to begin

Searching for an angel
To spread her wings and douse the flames
It burns
She's been dancing on a cloud
Basking in her waves of infinite glory
I see you waiting
I see you dancing intoâ¦

We'll be running, dancing into the avenue
We're rejoicing as you're shaking
We'll be running, dancing, devoid of feeling new
And your safety can never be safely assumed

I have tasted her blood, have tasted her eyes
All the he said, the she said, it's killing me
But what the fuck is wrong with me?
Safely assuming the worst with me
Safely assuming the worst
What the fuck is wrong?
Safely assuming the worst

I'm counting silver lines in my mind
I'm counting
I'm counting silver lines in my mind
I'm counting
I'm counting silver lines in my mind
I'm counting

Lost amongst the separation of love
We've castrated our innocence as usual, as usual
I feel paranoia seeping through my skin
Ignite the gasoline, I'm blasting off against the grain
