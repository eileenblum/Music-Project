I hit a wall, I need a fix
I hit a wall, I need a fix

All I want, just desserts
All I want are my just desserts

Misery, my company
Misery enjoys my company

Candy-coat my veins
Wishing this could last forever
Indecision plants the seed
Learn to fall apart
Itâs the nature of my heart
So close to you

Candy-coat my veins
Wishing this could last forever
Plant the seed
Learn to fall apart
Itâs the nature of my heart
Close to you

Iâll take anything that takes the place of this
Iâll take anything that takes the place of this
Iâll take anything that takes me away fromâ¦

Liar, charlatan
All I need is just one more hit
Liar, charlatan
All I need is just one more hit

Fix me, wonât you fix me
Just to fix me, wonât you fix me
Just to get your fix

Iâm drained of all of my integrity
But if I am honest, I donât regret a thing
Iâm drained of all of my ability
But if I am honest, if I am honest, I donât regret a thing
