Chechens, we ride

Graves, dotting the planes, marking the scene of genocide made modern
Mourning the two hundred thousand unnamed
We'll not be poisoned by history
for the blackest of gold
and the blackest of souls

So we fight
Chechens, we ride
To Dagestan tonight

Chechens, we ride

I am free
I am Shiva, destroyer of worlds
Lock in aim, I will bring my vengeance tenfold

I am free
How can you kill a dead man?
Even if my hand falls limp to the ground, others' will find you
Even if my hand falls limp to the ground, others' will find you

Chechens, we ride to Dagestan tonight

Chechens, we ride

We will not be poisoned by history
Two hundred thousand unmarked graves in memory

My love, forgive me for all that I have done
I've turned my back on the garden we grew up in
They forced us to fight
We will not go quietly into the night
I fear the man you knew is gone
I replaced love with charges and bombs
We're holding the lines
They're barely holding on

Yes, yesterday, we were children playing
Forced to fight
Unable to grow, and able to know such violence

Given away everything I could have gained
Away
This time it seems I couldn't find a way
There's nothing left
Except for everyone who has destroyed their lives
We're keeping our promises we shouldn't make
Given away everything I could have gained
Away
This time it seems I couldn't find a way
There's nothing left
Except for everyone who has destroyed their lives
We're keeping our promises we shouldn't make
