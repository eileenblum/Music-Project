I'm out of my head but I ain't looking for no sympathy
Cross path with action moving forward

Intertwining demons are setting the scene, conversations damning
Reluctantly we drown out the feelings of pride
Ripping you apart, eaten alive
Drown out the sorrow again

I've strained to read between the lines
To redefine myself, understand myself
Clawing back to life
Picture me here, patiently waiting
For my chance to shine
Until I get pulled back down
(Picture me here, picture me here)
Always tries to pull me down

Picture me here, picture me waiting

Drown out feelings of pride
Ripping you apart, eaten alive
We drown out the sorrow
Drown out feelings of pride
Ripping you apart, eaten alive
We drown out, drown out the sorrow

Intertwining demons are setting the scene, conversations damning
Reluctantly we drown out the sorrow again
Drown out the sorrow

My curse, to always self-destruct
To never see the sun, never rise above
Constantly loathing
I am hope and hate combined

Drown out feelings of pride
Ripping you apart, eaten alive
We drown out, drown out the sorrow

I'm out of my head
But I ain't looking for no sympathy
Cross path with action moving forward

I keep on struggling to hold my head up
But deep inside, all I want is just to disappear
I know I'll reach the end of the rope soon enough
Until that day, I'll keep on moving
