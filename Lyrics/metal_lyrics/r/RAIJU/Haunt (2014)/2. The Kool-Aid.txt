Uncertainty is the bitterest pill to swallow
Better get you some pain meds at least
The betting man knows where the house is, it seems
Pascal would like to raise you
Still you play your hand and expect us to follow
Sure the payout seems nice
But we just want to come on ye faithful

It's not that we think you drank the Kool-Aid
It's more that we wish you had
It's more we wish you had

Watched you expire
A cosmic hiccup, hiccup
Asphyxiate the willing
Regurgitated
Each stone you threw up, pick up
Foolish complicity

Let the BSD lift the lid, put the bun in the oven
This obsession with hymens is so poorly hiding the high, tiny horses that Mary's not riding
(We need some male enhancement)
So you see that your prophecy foretells of misogyny and sails you
Up a river of bullshit
And somehow you are just not smelling it

It's not that we think you drank the Kool-Aid
It's more that we wish that you had

It's not that we drank the Kool-Aid
So get up off your knees, and do anything
Just be free
You'll find your own way out
You'll find your own way
It's not that we drank the Kool-Aid
So get up off your knees and do anything
Just be free
You'll find your own way out
You'll find your own way out
