You're to live by their rules
Willingly, obey regulations,
No one will or shall defy
They're controlling all lives

Brainwashed are all the minds 
Who live their whole lives by being intimidated 
What will it take to give sight to blind eyes 
For all naive followers who don't realize
Everything 'bout the system is a line of lies

This dominant force is controlled by such few
TÃ® battle its powers no one will do
To begin this harsh war
First victims will be slain
If you don't fight the beast
You'll die slowly in pain

Ways of the system, will remain the same
'Till all the conformists quit playing this game 
And begin to fight the system to make a change
