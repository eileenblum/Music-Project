Descent of doom eternal war 
All is lost and nothing scored 
Dollars signs have filled their heads 
Extincted race when all is dead

They fight and battle for fuel and land 
Leaving us nowhere lo stand 
We're helpless as they ignore our plees 
They just sit by and raise the fees

Crisis lime is here again 
A war to which I here seems no end 
Premonitions of the past 
Prophets saw the die they'll cast
