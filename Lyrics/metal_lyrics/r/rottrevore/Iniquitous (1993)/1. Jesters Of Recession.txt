Liberty and justice for no one
Recession times for everyone
Apathy is getting stronger towards the tax payers
Who the hell are you to judge others

You're just a pawn trying to play king
A jester in puppet masters clothing
Shelf your apathetic dogma
No remorse or salvation
The punishment and losses created
You put yourself above others

In your own mind you're higher than most
Actually your political poison has paralyzed the public trust in the system and diminishing their hope
Forget the laws and jurisdiction
Cut the red tape of bureaucratical pride
Sew a net of honesty and trust and wear it as a symbol of the people
Not your ignorance and greed for your own personal goal
Disposable friends at the expense of their pride
You're also conceited and unaware

[Solo: Weber]

Force into a life of the treachery 
Trapped within your world of anxiety
Damaging, incriminating fleeing from your fate
Sealed within your naive mind

National deficit is growing little by little
Increasing the taxes
Spending money in aiding other lands
Let's settle the problems at hand

Bend the rules to benefit yourself 
Trying to cover up your errors
Jesters of recession
Mockery of the system
