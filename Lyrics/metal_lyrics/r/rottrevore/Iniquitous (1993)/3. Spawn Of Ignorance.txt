They utilize the system, the power of control
Got you all their mercy, obey as you've been told 
White collars doing justice? Criticizing you 
Tearing at your freedom, 
There's nothing you can do

Prisoned in the social dungeon,
caged within their laws
Dispersing off their selfishness,
they toss you to the dogs

Blind to all subconsious cries,
too deaf to even care
Struggle for your blemished rights,
then slapped into the chair

Incubating haired, hatching such a greed
Vending all their lying truth,
just to suit their need
Syndicated governments, ceasing all demise
Spawning off their ignorance,
then impale you down to size
