To divest of normal bodily form
Puntured wound and skin so torn 
Dwelling parasites that rot your flesh
To decompose to great grotesque

Agony and malady, disorders of the brain
Deformity offensity, extensive deal of pain
Amputation, blood cremation
Limbs of rancid waste

Mass distortion, gut abortion
Disgorge the putrid taste

Disembodied souls never rest
Steaming blond gushing from your chest
Putrefaction, mortification
Saprophytic, annihilation
Amputation, blood cremation
