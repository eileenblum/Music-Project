Continual loss of rights increase of restriction 
Majority of nations poor have few exemtions 
Failure to abide resulting lost possession 
No one speaks against them our loss is wage recession

Minor complaints may be heard while others just deliberately 
Ignore but who dares to challenge against their word lo be defeated 
And beaten some more

Increased taxes government defeceit freedom and rights removal
Life's easier for them since all made it possible by showing unanimous approval

With help from our idiocy naiveness, stupidity
it's enabled their powers to grow stronger,
the future has a collapsed economy, if we wait any longer

Increased taxes, government defeceit freedom and rights removal
Life's easier for them, since all made it possible by showing unanimous approval

Political authorities gaining maximum control, distorting laws 
for their own benefit life of pleasure, beyond a maximum 
do without, what they receive from us

Continual loss of rights increase of restriction 
Majority of nations poor have few exemtions 
Failure lo abide resulting lost possession 
No one speaks against them our loss is wage recession

Set the standard for those who are paying 
Set the standard for those who are paying 
till it reaches a point of complete dictatorship
