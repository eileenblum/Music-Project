Denying your future its all a dismal dream
Twisted reality, the most it ever seems 
Unconcious awareness, is the death of all your hopes
Pushing to the limit until the end of the rope

The fate in store is penance convicted for your sins 
Annulment of your actions is battle you'll never win 
Searching for your fortune unlit the day you die
Always seeking to never profit as every day goes by

When you've found your senses....a tunnel of despair 
Severed thoughts of tranquil....will all just rip &amp; tear
Extinction of forgiveness....Ã³our mental scars grow large 
The verdict of your sanity....is guilt your are charged
