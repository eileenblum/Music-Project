The sounds of icepicks shattering skulls
Horrid painful screams echo in the air
As we drop each victim one after another
We don't even think to care

After all we've been put through
Our revenge is yet to come
Powers of the system have been overtaken
Politician elimination has already begun
They must be punished for telling us a lie
As we slowly grow communist
Our limited freedom begins to die

Now's the time for the supreme beings
To step down from their thrones
To feel pantalgia no ones ever known
No form of retaliation will make up for damage done

Innocence wiped out by subliminal command
We shall feel no sorrow as they cry for their life 
We'll stick to our word and never give in
Each will slave to us this force will win
As all happenings take place they're not by our will 
Our subconcious minds have been disturbed 
Therefore we've developed this instinct to kill

As we all perished eternally we've only them to blame
Gluttony and greed totally ruled their mind
Now we all suffer and the past is a thought left behind
