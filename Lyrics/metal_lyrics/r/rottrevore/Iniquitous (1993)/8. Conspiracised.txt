Desperate world of greed and despair, monopolizeâ¦ No lives to spare
So naive conditioned thoughts, programmed minds their souls are bought

Blemished society of chronic ignorance 
Tarnished environment of judicial conspiracy

Middle class aren't given any praise 
Increasing the taxes &amp; voting in their raise 
Impossible in this world to survive 
Stripping all your freedom you're conspiracized

Blemished society of chronic ignorance 
Tarnished environment of judicial conspiracy

Corporate trust blemished plans 
Extreme expenses high demands
Conspiracy most of their lives 
To get ahead through crisis times

Pay offs there's nothing you can do
Powerless against their stereotypical attitudes
Capital is the kindling that feeds their fire
The flames of deceitfulness are soon lo take them higher
