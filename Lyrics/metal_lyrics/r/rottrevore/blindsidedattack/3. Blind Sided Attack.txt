Macho attitude driven ego try hard to Impress. This kind is of majority. What does it prove, what sense does it make, or whatâs the point? Or whatâs the motive when someone who is favored thinks that they have the authority to instigate conflict against one who thinks for themselves and shows noticeable appearance differences.

Easy to get away performing such an action when the rest of this kind displays similar to exact behavior. As member of the outnumbered, hereâs final warning to the favored. Donât dare step in front of me with your hostile attitude.

Cause Iâll terrorize your life to where you feel the blood drip in your soul then Iâll choke you to death.

This practice is repeated so often it seems Itâs done unknowingly. Your money can buy me
a jail sentence my blade can buy you eternity through death. No oneâs making you stand in my intimate zone so you can step back now and if somehow you donât get dropped and if you your kind take advantage of me... This is more than a fair warning especially being you had no reason and antagonizing from the start to a person who keeps to themselves

Just remember to keep looking over your shoulder. Be alert as like having eyes in the back of your head. When least expected an attack from blind side will take you by surprise. Occurrence like such has to be this way cause members of this minority are few and far between. So go ahead and persist. Encourage an altercation.

Cause Iâll terrorize your life to where you feel the blood drip in your soul then Iâll choke you to death.

Just be prepared for a day of reckoning pay for and accept what you really deserve. Cause this is no longer a joke and itâs being more than fair. You have the option. So you make the choice or else you will suffer the consequence and die from being skinned.
