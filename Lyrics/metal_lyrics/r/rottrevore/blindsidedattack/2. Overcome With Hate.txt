Those who are compelled to deal with this and in some cases must defend their perception of it.

You must overcome with hate. Peoples general conception of customary uniform personal appearance.

An all dark attire gives false security to oneâs already spurious thoughts of intimidating fearlessness.

Those susceptible to the rate of pick up to this conformity is like dusk as the night sky grows more black... at dawn and through the day the sky is all grey.

It severs like sharp stainless steel silver drawing the red from the white.

These seemingly related fads had to be created for a purpose. Whatâs the point of being a part of and supporting them when you dont know how they evolved or what they could possibly symbolize.

How can you possibly respect yourself when youâre not beinâ yourself. our unawareness has blatantly backed this.

Is there opposition or do you think itâs right.

We change our nationâs colors to black, silver, grey, red, and white.
