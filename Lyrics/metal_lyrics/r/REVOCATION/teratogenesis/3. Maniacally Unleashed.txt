[Music: Gargiulo, lyrics: Buda]

Vacant inside
Relief I must find
Panicked, desperate, restless, senseless.

I cannot hide
From deep, sunken eyes
Now it's started, starving soulless

[Chorus:]
Gnash
Rend
Feast of rippling flesh drips in piles
Crazed
Slobbering
Maniacally unleashed upon devouring

Possessing desire
For that which has died
Tearing, grasping, ripping, slashing

Exploding throughout
Gore spilling out
Serene, tranquil, sated, thankful

[Chorus]

This fixation
consumes my world
Mastication
of gushing spoils

[Solo: Davidson]
