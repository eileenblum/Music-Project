[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Hunted through the depths of
Innervision,
Spirit blades hack into
My chest.

Consequence comes crashing,
To collision.
Trembling swarm convulsing through my flesh.

[Pre-chorus:]
Servant, the beating drum,
Keeps you pliant, until the dawn,
Minion, your grotesque display,
My tribute, my pawn.

[Chorus:]
Feel the fire,
The cold blue flame.
Bound by desire,
Invoke my name.
Unceasing fire,
Lustful gaze.
Cannot deny me,
Your will I raze.

Surrendering to the need,
Seek stimulation.
Trembling, drooling, shivering,
Sweet titillation.

Dissolve in the slithering,
Poison spills without.
Taken, spent, and withering,
To perversion devout.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
