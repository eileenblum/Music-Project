[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Slowly our rights erode away
We exist only to be slaves
The hidden hand with fingers outstretched
Closes in around our necks

[Pre-chorus:]
Masses refuse to see
Kept in line as we are deceived
Minds start to atrophy
Suppress the will to be

[Chorus:]
The grip tightens around our throats
Gasping for air as we choke
A barren future, we've lost all hope
Slowly the grip tightens around our throats

[Solo: Gargiulo]

Snuffing out the air from our lungs
A horrid realization
Suffocating, as we watch our world come undone
Knowing the worst is yet to come

[Pre-chorus]

Is this our destiny?
To be enslaved endlessly
The notion of our freedom
Is a Fallacy

[Chorus]

Strangulation, we choke out (Strangulation, we choke out)
There's nothing left, there's nothing left! (There's nothing left)
Suffocating, we're breathing (Suffocating, we're breathing)
Our final breath, our final breath! (Our final breath)

[Solo: Davidson]

[Chorus]

Around our throats!
