[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Manipulating the minds of men,
Concealed in darkness I prey.
Twisting the psyches of the weaklings,
Leading them further astray.

[Chorus:]
Come my loyal subjects,
Do my bidding as I direct.
I, creator of atrocities.
The shaper of monstrosities.
Your Majesty, of agony and blasphemy. Blasphemy!

GREED!

Greed, lust, and gluttony,
These are but just a few of my favorite sins.
Forfeit your sanity and surrender to me,
Feel my vile prescience within.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Davidson]
