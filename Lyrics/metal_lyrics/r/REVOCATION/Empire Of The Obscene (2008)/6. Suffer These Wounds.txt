[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

I am imperfect for this world,
And caught up in a fruitless game,
That's never-ending, back and forth,
And once begun, it hasn't changed.

[Chorus:]
It's a world built on lies,
And careless ambiguity.
Now gone inside,
Content... with no security.

It's all less than what I believed.
In stinging submission... acknowledge deceit.
What will I be? I cannot see.
Will I find... peace?

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Blistered, bled, battered, bruised.
Do you have what it takes to suffer these wounds? [2x]

SUFFER. THESE. WOUNDS!

THESE WOUNDS!
