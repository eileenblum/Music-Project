[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Dead city of men
Rises against a blackened sky.
Rancid cancerous flesh,
The scent of decay where afflicted lie.

Radiation; the blaze of sun shears through the clouds.
Ripping torment; in polluted wastes, mutations abound.

[Chorus:]
Soul-sick men, barred from reason,
Perverted... beyond consciousness,
Deranged, no longer rational,
Deluded fools... filled with ignorance.

Animal instincts,
Irreconciled with mental constructs.
Dual existence,
Entangled in self-conflict.
Immersed in sickness,
I scream my disgust in a deafened void.
Overcome with weakness,
Stifled by the poison of corporate lords.

[Chorus]

Driven into deprivation,
Tortured son of a bastard nation.
Unrestrained industrialization,
Self-assures destruction.
Trapped in a colossal labyrinthine citadel,
All else has ceased to exist.
Frenzied, frantic, violent, panicked,
Succumbed to hopelessness.

[Solo]
