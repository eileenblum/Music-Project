[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Righteousness reaching out cunning hands,
Molding minds of the meek.
Mind-fucked by the hope of a promised land,
Unattained; reward not received.

A pious purpose, automated response,
A synthetic, sympathetic reaction.
In sheltered simplicity emotions are lost,
To dispassionate stupefaction.

[Pre-chorus:]
An innocent indoctrination, numbing mind-conversion,
Thoughts beaten down while spirit drowns in ignorance immersion.

[Chorus:]
Abandon all hope, see, feel, hear and taste nothing,
Within and without, surrounded by suffering,
Deliver me from my senses.

Spurn the consolation of religion,
And illusions of immortality.
When your savor eternal suffering,
Purged, purified, you'll be set free.

Desperately I seek truth
From thoughts running through my mind.
Striving forward with baited breath,
I reach for what it hides.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
