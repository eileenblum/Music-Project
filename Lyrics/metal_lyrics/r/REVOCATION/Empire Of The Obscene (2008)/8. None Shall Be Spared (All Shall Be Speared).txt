[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Taste of the poison sword.
Without warning, I will hunt you down; I'll run you through.
Malice is my reward.
My whole existence; violating and tormenting fools.

Worship my hateful idols,
Omnipotence assured.
A victor without rivals; a twisting, swirling chaos lord.

[Chorus:]
Grieve... lamenting fallen brothers.
Retch... the stench of gruesome remains.
My bloodied touch behind all suffering
Ever wreaked upon the plains.

I dwell in devastation,
Carnage declares my name.
Merciless assassination;
Disembody you by axe and shrapnel, blade and flame.
To look at my face is demise.
My eyes blaze with captured souls.
A god of unlimited power,
Beyond all mortal control.

[Chorus]

Decimation, ruination - I bring these plagues upon thee;
Hate! Rape! Carnage massacre!

[Solo]
