[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda, Davidson]

A howling wasteland, all that remains in my mind
Is sacrilegious savagery, I defile all I find.
Within my seclusion, prayers are as worthless as pity,
By rottenness consumed, I spit my bile at sanctity.

[Chorus:]
You look into my eyes, malice is all you'll find,
Devoid of sympathy, exhumed identity.

Jagged mark inscribed in my palms, stigmatized.
I breathe a hollow breath of broken pride.
The pain that I conceal is putrescent;
Rotting me. I'll cut it free. All my sins I now repent.

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2:]
You are powerless - crumble at my feet,
Strike with iron fist - crush mercilessly.
Domination reigns down with every blow,
Viciously I reduce you to nothing.

[Solo]

Shadowed by wraiths of misery,
An inborn infection,
But when I try to bury it and flee,
It's exhumed and resurrected.

[Solo]

[Chorus 2]

GUITAR!

[Solo]

YOWZER!
