[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Rigid, ordered rows of spikes metal and cold,
Extend across the fields,
Creating perfection within grid formation.

Frigid winds blow; exact a bitter toll
On those unfortunates condemned unto the
Steel fields of predation.

[Pre-chorus:]
Savage is the sentencing when destined to be pierced,
For capital offenders this is punishment most fierce.

[Chorus:]
Justice, a relic,
In the new world forgotten.
Reigning malignancy in splattered steel,
The stench arises, rotten.

Even a fearless man will weep and plead
At the calling of his name.
No escape, the time has come
To plummet onto the blades.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo]

Any will to be free is insurgency,
Wretched destiny is impalement.
Industrial wasteland is all you see;
The poor lie diseased on the pavement.
