[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

From humble beginnings, a tyrant arises,
To profit from sinning, can carry harsh prices.
The obstacles of family,
Inhibitions of pride,
A ruthless monopoly,
For wealth, he chose to be despised.

[Chorus:]
Circumstances compel that he hide his face,
As filth satisfies crudest urges.
Raids drive his business from place to place,
Manipulation disguises his earnings.

"You can't convict me for obscenity.
Look at all your failed indictments.
I'll flaunt my ill-gained amenities
In the face of your moral rightness (Fuck!)."

From humble beginnings, a tyrant arises,
To profit from sinning, can carry harsh prices.

[Chorus]

"In arrogance inspiring spite,
Your avarice betrays your might.
The tyrant defiant, disposed and jailed,
Evasive concealment of wealth unveiled."

It's a force-fed falsehood,
When money in itself is a goal.
Corruption, the able tool
To stifle self-control.

Force-fed falsehood,
When money in itself is a goal.
Corruption, the able tool
To stifle self-control.

[Solo 2x]

EMPIRE! EMPIRE!

Empire of the Obscene! [4x]

Crumbling down.
