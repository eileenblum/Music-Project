[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

A morbid minded coroner at the county morgue
Has a twisted fascination with a corpse that he adores.
Waiting for the moment, when no one is around,
Nobody will ever know and she won't make a sound.

Unzippering the body bag, anticipation grows,
There are no more signs of life, her eyes are dead and cold.
His most perverse of fantasies are finally coming true,
He finds himself aroused by the smell of embalming fumes.

[Chorus:]
He has found the corpse of all his dreams,
Achieving orgasm by any means.
Penetrating inside the cadaver,
Alive or dead, to him, it doesn't matter.

Years of pent up sexual frustration
Have led to cadaverous fornication.
The pleasure was growing but he didn't realize
That inside her was a virus that left him zombified.

Transformed, he lusts for human flesh,
Lurking in the neighborhood, the coroner's possessed.
Reborn, a raging psychopath,
The doctor is in, beware of his wrath.

[Chorus]

Romance in the Rue Morgue,
Got an STD from a dead whore.
He fucked some tail from the crypt,
She was so beautiful, he just couldn't resist.

Possessed by the pathogen,
He'll never be the same again.
Dead or alive he just wanted to love her,
I guess he should have worn a rubber.

[Solo]
