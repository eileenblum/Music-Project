[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

What depths will you sink to?
It surprises me every day.
You fit the part so beautifully
And deserve an award for the role you play.
You are sickening.

It's never-ending, the cycle stays the same.
Fractured faÃ§ade.
Why put it on?
We both know exactly what you are.

Saccharine-scented skin.
Rotten from within.
Stench of putrefaction, you reek of vermin.

On your knees,
Queen of Disease.
Enveloped in your misery,
the epitome of disloyalty.
Fill the void with iniquity.

Blacked out, awakened by the shame.
Cast out, defiled and defamed.

You're a cesspool, lowest of the low.
You're the starlet that everybody knows.
What's behind the harlot's smile? Is it denial?

Lights out baby, the show is fucking over!

[Solo: Davidson]

On your knees,
Queen of Disease.
Enveloped in your misery,
the epitome of disloyalty.
Fill the void with iniquity.
