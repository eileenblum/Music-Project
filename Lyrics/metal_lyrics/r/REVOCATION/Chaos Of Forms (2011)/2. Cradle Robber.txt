[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

My name is Death.
You'll come to know me well.
I'll steal your soul.
Then leave a lifeless shell.

I creep into your room.
But your soul's not what I crave.
Tonight, I'll take your only child to an early grave.

[Pre-chorus:]
Your time passes with every falling grain of sand.
The hourglass has emptied, the end is at hand.
By now you know my name, Death is who I am.
So come and follow me into unknown lands.

[Chorus]
Mother, don't you cry to me.
The child is mine, don't try to beg or plead.
Mother, your sorrow is so sweet.
This is your destiny.

You can't bargain with me, my deed here is done.
There'll be no convincing, I have no compassion.
Your cries go unanswered, your sadness matters not.
I will drain all life from you and leave your corpse to rot.

[Pre-chorus]

[Solo: Gargiulo]
[Solo: Davidson]

See the gleam... of my scythe.
Your spirit... is my prize.
Lifeless eyes (lifeless eyes!)... your demise (your demise!)
I laugh at your petty cries.

[Chorus]

Mother, don't you cry to me. Don't you cry to me!
Mother, your sorrow is so sweet!
