[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Incantation.
Welcoming the Watchers.
Astral invasion.
A foulness beyond time.

Their hunger is insatiable.
Slaked only by annihilation.
Unrelenting.
In harvesting life energies.

Writhe and claw!
Dominate.
Ascend to a prominent dominion.
A blaze transforms this tepid kingdom.
Enslaved, encapsulated.

Blackened spires twist.
Against malevolent sky.
Ghastly pyres.
Cleanse this earthly realm.

Insectoid chatter pulsating, churning.
Cleaving continental rifts.
Howling victims.
Silenced amidst cacophony.

Writhe and claw!
Dominate.
Ascend to a prominent dominion.

A blaze transforms this tepid kingdom.
Enslaved, encapsulated.

Linger in the vacancies of time.
No flesh stranger, fungal predator divine.

Servants ancient, their intentions are malign.
Born to suffer the torments of the Watchers.

WATCH OUT!

[Solo: Davidson]
