[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Bring forth the end and awaken the beast.
For years, it has waited to be unleashed.
The hour is nigh, summon it at once.
Mankind's existence will soon be undone.

[Pre-chorus:]
Nuclear winter is on its way.
There's no escape, no one can be saved.

[Chorus]
Witness the destroyer.
Beloved horrifier.
The harbinger of our demise.
Abomination, we adore it.
Beautiful and so abhorrent.
The end has finally arrived.

The fallout from the blast.
Has blackened out the Sun.
The ocean's become a bloodbath.

Cities destroyed in the blink of an eye.
The masses are reduced to ash.

[Pre-chorus]

Extinguish existence.
Distorted deliverance.
Destined for decimation.
Embrace obliteration.

[Solo: Davidson]

[Chorus]
