[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Hail the freak!
The king of the creep show.
Abhorred and adored.
A creature so intriguing.
The crowd keeps wanting more and more.

So, come on, give 'em a show.
Step right up to the pedestal of mockery.
They want to see this miscreant of misery.

Chained and caged.
Never to see the light of day.

Never! No, never!

Driven insane,
Malformed and deranged.

Onlookers gawk and laugh.
They feed him discarded scraps.

Lashed by the master's whip.
Perpetual punishment.

Covered with open sores.
Curse the day that he was born.
No creature's as freakish as he.
His deformity reigns supreme.

[Solo: Davidson]

Tomorrow, the freak awakes
Upon a brand new stage,
He knows there is only one way to escape.

The crowd is horrified
As he takes his own life.
The grand finale ended with a suicide.

Suicide!
