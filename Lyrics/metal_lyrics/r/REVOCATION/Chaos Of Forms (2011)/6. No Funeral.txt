[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Celebrate the intrepid carnivore.
Silent sanguine assassin.
Cornering the meeker, soon to be made prey.
Silver flash of the dagger.

Hail to misery enthroned.
Extol the deceptive, destructive and cold.
Strangled and suffocated.
By subconscious enslavement.

[Chorus:]
Ripping right into you.
Racing through to infinity.
Disassemble the absolute.
Integrate with vacuity.

Instigate a senseless transgression.
Insurrect and implode.
Surrender unto thankless destiny,
Bloated cadaver floats.

Weighted with cement affixed.
Never changing direction.
No liberation for the penniless.
Futile insurrection.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Davidson]

All that I see.
Is nought but a dream.
I no longer know what is real.
Disintegrate and desecrate.
Give me no funeral.

Funeral. Funeral. There'll be no funeral.

No funeral!
