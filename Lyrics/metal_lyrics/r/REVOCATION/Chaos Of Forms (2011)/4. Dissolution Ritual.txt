[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

I speak with corrupted tongue.
Whispered subtle deception.
Slither within and spit.
Verbal manipulation.

I am the one that takes you.
My illicit concubine.
Victimize and incinerate you.
Intoxicant divine.

[Chorus]
It's time to start the show.
Introduce the hidden self.
Stricken to reveal the truth.
That sickens and repels.
Swallowing a sick addiction.
Serenade from a serpent's tongue.
Authoring a fatal fiction.
Symbols dripping with venom.

I am a conflagration.
Cleanse me through ritual burn.
Gradual assassination.
Drains me, squandering rebirth.

Breathe deep the exhalation.
As bitter droplets singe,
Inhalation escalation.
Rapidly to be undone.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Davidson]

I can subvert this prison.
Elevate beyond my flesh.
Reprogram mental systems.
Continuum connect.

Infinite network access.
Invisible spectrums flow.
Throughout my subtle body.
All I am is what I know.

[Chorus]

It's time to start the show. (Rise! Release your mind!)
Introduce the hidden self. (Never satisfied!)
Stricken to reveal the truth.
That sickens and repels.
Swallowing a sick addiction. (Rise! Release your mind!)
Serenade from a serpent's tongue. (Never satisfied!)
Authoring a fatal fiction.
Symbols dripping with venom.
