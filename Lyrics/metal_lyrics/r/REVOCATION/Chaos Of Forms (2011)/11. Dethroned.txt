[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

The liar spoke so sweetly,
I believed every word.
She's the queen of deception.
How I bowed to her.

But now her crown is shattered,
And the pieces fall away.
Your throne's a fabrication,
It's time to fucking abdicate.

It's time to abdicate.

Do you start to believe your lies if you say them a thousand times?
Does it start to eat you alive?
Knowing that you're empty inside.

How do you sleep at night? [3x]

Low life, no loyalty. (No loyalty!)
I never thought I'd see the day that you could delude me.
There will be no forgiveness, no time to make amends.
One thing I can say for certain, I will never kneel before you again.

I'll never kneel again!

Do you start to believe your lies if you say them a thousand times?
Does it start to eat you alive?
Knowing that you're empty inside.

[Solo: Davidson]
