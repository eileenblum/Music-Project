[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

The masses stumble into waking dreams.
Embracing ambrosia, synthetic extremes.
Tethered to immersions that coerce control.
Serrated visions will sever the soul.

Innervating, recreating you!

[Solo: Davidson]

REPROGRAMMED!

The sky is dripping liquid death.
Creating corpses, bleeding black.
Caustic toxins flow into our mouths.
From rampant excesses under attack.

Riddled with corruption, glorified government.
Tricks its constituents, inverts intelligence.
Operant conditioning dictates what we say and think.
Glutted with mind control medicine, daily drink.

[Solo: Davidson]

Invade me, betray me, your lies recreate me.
Transforming and spawning servile replication.
Losing touch with what I've ceased to be.
I am just a servant now.
Inject me with your poison, I want... to be reborn!

I want to be reborn! [repeat until end]
