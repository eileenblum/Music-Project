[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

[Solo: Gargiulo]

Come my children, I beckon unto thee.
I summon you to awaken from your eternal sleep.
Rise from your graves, slumber no more.
The time has come to spread your plague upon this... world.

Awaken, my children!

We spew forth from the spoiled earth.
To heed the master's command.
Our wretched rebirth shall be a curse upon this land.

Through the blackest incantations, we are summoned from our crypts.
We savor the suffering of mortals, their deaths shall not be swift.

[Solo: Davidson]
[Solo: Gargiulo]

Now the spell is complete, I am the ruler of this scourge.
Bow down at my feet, tremble before the necromancer.

Tremble before me!

We are the legion spawned from the darkness. (We all are one)
We obey the master's command. (We are all legion)
We are the legion born of malice. (We are all one)
We are the scourge upon this land. (The bringers of decimation)
