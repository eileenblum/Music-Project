[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Dubois-Coyne]

Content within... your inner prison,
Divisive deadening... of all the senses.

Rank and file,
Marching endlessly.
United in mental helotry.

Solidarity destroyed,
What incentive is left to resist?
Spite will have to suffice,
Your apathy turns my knuckles white.

Starved faculties of imagination,
You gorge on banalities, then ask for seconds.

Rank and file,
Marching endlessly.
United in helotry.

No sight beyond your blinders,
Devoted to this beaten path.

Solidarity destroyed,
What incentive is left to resist?
Spite will have to suffice,
Your apathy turns my knuckles... white!

[Solo: Davidson]

Rank and file,
Marching endlessly,
United in helotry.

MARCH! [2x]
