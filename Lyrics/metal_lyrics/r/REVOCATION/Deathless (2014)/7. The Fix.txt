[Music: Gargiulo, lyrics: Dubois-Coyne]

A staged play years in the making,
Arm your scapegoat, then flip the switch.
Thousands march towards beckoning graves
While profits are harvested hand over fist.

[Chorus:]
A system designed with controlling intent cannot be changed from within.
The illusion of choice, a coin with one side,
The fix is in.

Beholden to their corporate masters, politicians privatizing genocide.
Condolences offered by the same who pulled the trigger with unblinking eyes.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Davidson]

Sociopathic parasites licking their fingers clean.
How many times... must history repeat?

[Solo: Gargiulo]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Davidson]
