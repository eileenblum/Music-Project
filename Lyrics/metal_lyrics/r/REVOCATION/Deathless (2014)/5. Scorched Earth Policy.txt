[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

[Solo: Davidson]

Weaponized to neutralize,
Always on patrol,
Under constant surveillance,
Their need for control.
Automaton gaining sentience,
A glitch in the system,
Raining down hellfire on innocent civilians.

Now we're all just dots on a screen, just blips on a radar.
The human race is obsolete; total extermination.

Cold and calculated,
Prowler of the skies,
Ceaseless in its devotion,
The ever-watchful eye.
All organic life forms will perish in their wake,
There will be no survivors on our judgement day.

Now we're all just dots on a screen, just blips on a radar.
The human race is obsolete; total extermination.

All the fail-safes have failed.
Welcome to the new regime.
The only law of the land;
A scorched earth policy.

Scorched earth policy!

[Solo: Davidson]

All the fail-safes have failed.
Welcome to the new regime!
