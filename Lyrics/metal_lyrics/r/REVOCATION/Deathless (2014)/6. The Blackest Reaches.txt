[Music: Gargiulo, lyrics: Davidson]

Confined in darkness,
Where light dares not tread,
The sphere lies suspended and undisturbed.
I curse that fateful day, within that foul old church,
The day that this curse was first incurred.

What lies inside... the blackest reaches of one's mind?
Primal and divine... an entity unbound by all space and time.

And so the visions came again,
Blackened vortices spiralling with no end.
Staring from the shining trapezohedron,
The three-lobed burning eye.

What lies inside... the blackest reaches of one's mind?
Primal and divine... an entity unbound.

[Solo: Davidson]

I see the darkness in the light,
Now the two become one. [2x]
Enthroned upon the seat of ultimate chaos,
He who cannot be named.

Infinite.
Omnipotent.
