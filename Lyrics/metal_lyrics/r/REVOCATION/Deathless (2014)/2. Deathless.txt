[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Driven off course,
Embrace entropy, a life of chaos,
So many diverging paths with so many dead ends.
An oath of blood,
A pact of the initiated,
For this life we've been condemned.

[Pre-chorus:]
Free from the shackles of conformity,
With reckless abandon we shun stability.
Traversing day and night across expanses vast,
We journey forth with the strength of the wind at our backs.

[Chorus:]
Deathless, the fire burns on and on,
Ceaseless, we ride into the dawn.
No turning back, we're too far gone.
Deathless, the fire burns.

Night after night,
Witness the decibel ritual,
Sacrificing ourselves upon this altar of sin.
Nocturnally devoted to the cause of blasphemy,
Heathens awaiting the black mass to begin.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

It was never a choice,
No glory for madmen,
The blood of the insane boils in our veins.
Through all the trials and tribulations,
Still we remain.

Let's ride!

[Solo: Davidson]

[Chorus]

Deathless, the fire burns on and on,
Ceaseless, we ride into the dawn.
No turning back, we're too far gone.
Deathless, deathless.
