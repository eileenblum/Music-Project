[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Eyes unblinking, affixed on us all,
Feed the data stream.
Glowing pupils like voracious maws,
Stalking hungrily.

Purging us of every intimacy, undying is their vigilance,
Rendition extraordinary, suppressing the dissidents.

[Chorus:]
Followed, by orbs of glass.
Watching our every move.

Trapped within their digital gaze,
Ensnared in a binary web,
Optic fibers growing like tendrils,
Lurking overhead.

A maze of surveillance, with no exit in sight.
Surrounded by sentinels, nowhere to hide.

[Chorus]

Confined, in this labyrinth of eyes.
Hunted and dehumanized.

[Solo: Davidson]

Confined, in this labyrinth of eyes.
Hunted and dehumanized.
