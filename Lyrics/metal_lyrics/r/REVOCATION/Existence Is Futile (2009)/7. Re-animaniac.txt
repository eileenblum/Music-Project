[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Brick by brick the damned dismantle.
Their ancient tomb of imprisonment,
And stride into the waning midnight.
Lusting for blood and dismemberment.
Deranged and driven,
A misguided doctor conducts experiments.
Rejuvenating by injecting foul serums.

The doctor is insane.
Reanimate the dead.
Injection to the brain.
And now it's time to shred-

Trained and adept with a scalpel and tools,
Creating hordes of obedient ghouls.
With a simple incision of inhuman precision,
He slashes all ties to the self.

The results are hideous,
Monsters guilty of cannibal crimes.
No corpse fresh enough,
To prevent precious brain cells from expiring.

In a grisly accident,
A decapitated madman is reanimated.
A ripping shrapnel blast,
And a vicious ghoul is recreated.

HEADLESS, YET LIVING!

[Solo]

Beware the wayward surgeon.
Slicing with dexterous hands,
Inducing catatonia.
To make minions under his command.

Raising an army of corpses and bones.
Writhing and ravenous.
Undead legion, reeking of rot,
Death-march rattles on.
