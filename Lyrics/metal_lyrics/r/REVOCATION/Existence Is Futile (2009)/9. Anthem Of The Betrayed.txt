[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

I take my stand today,
Against the ones in my life who always seek to betray.
This is my final reckoning.
Those who seek to manipulate
Will be cast, only I decide my fate.
The era of lies is at its end.

Your treachery is sickening.
All those words you said to me were nothing more than prepared statements.
Your treachery is sickening.
Now the liars feast on their own fucking tongues.

Choking out the voice of treason.
Silence the serpents, let them drown in their venom.
I purge myself of this poison.
Your web of lies has come undone.

Undone. Your web of lies has come undone.

NEVER! AGAIN! (Never again!)
NEVER! AGAIN! (No!)

[Solo 2x]

Watch how quickly they'll turn upon themselves.
Nowhere to go, there's nothing left, there's no one else.
Their selfish deeds only serve their own agendas.
Isolated, the bridges you've burned are now reduced to embers.

We take our stand today
And scream out loud the anthem of the betrayed.
This is our final reckoning.
Now the cleansing is complete
No longer undermined by those who seek to deceive.
Banished are my enemies.

Your treachery is sickening.
All those words you said to me were nothing more than prepared statements.
Your treachery is sickening.
Now the liars feast on their own fucking tongues.
