[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Arthropod vector
With genetic arranged.
Viral cell culture.
Effects a chromosomal change.
Pathological swarm,
Infestation on a massive scale,
The brain's flesh is torn,
Implantation of the larval cells.

[Chorus:]
Neurotoxin scrambles brains.
Eternal stream of screams deranged.
Driven to a shrieking rage.
Once infected, none shall be saved.

Wriggling pupation.
Writhing spawn are burrowing.
Neural transformation,
Ceaseless shrieks bloodcurdling.
Terrorist conspiracy.
A hideous plot with twisted aims.
An act of insurgency,
A scourge of screaming unrestrained.

[Chorus]

Riots!
Violence!
Chaos!
Toxic torment!

[Solo]
