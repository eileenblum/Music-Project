[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Chaotic dystopia,
A nucleus malign.
Blasting waves of discord,
Warping bounds through space and time.

Seething, grasping primal leech
Seeping throughout existence.
Saps universal energy to fuel maelstrom synthesis.

Hallucinogenic realm of deafening cacophony.
Writhing, shapeless, fearsome, fell: a permanent apocalypse.
Beyond endless wastes, infinite vacant spaces must be crossed.
To enter into territory of eternal holocaust.

Unable to comprehend the nothingness,
As I rise into the unspeakable void.
Absorbed, digested by the chaos realm,
Consciousness implodes as I leave my physical form.

Relinquish all self-importance.
Recognize your pitiful state.
All life meaningless and empty,
Wretched cycle, no escape.
Struggling yet gaining nothing.
As celestial pyres burn.
Existence is futile,
And to nothingness we shall return.

[Solo]
