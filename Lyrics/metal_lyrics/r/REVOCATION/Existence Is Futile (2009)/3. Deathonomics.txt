[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

On the brink of a total collapse
The jackals laughing now.
Civil unrest growing every day,
World governments are crumbling down.
Calculated economic devastation spreads across the globe.
Hidden agendas of voracious corporations have been exposed.

Nations reeling from a crippling blow,
A dying system bleeds.
The ones who bludgeoned feel no remorse,
Overrun by greed.

Disgusting lust for wealth.
Swine revel in their filth.
Pay for your avarice.
In greed they trust.

Where's the fucking outrage?
Our futures vanished overnight,
And the ones on top sit back and watch the world burn from their palaces.
We rested assured, while behind closed doors.
Corruption was running rampant.
Everything we worked for has gone up in flames.
Now it's time to make them pay.

MAKE THEM PAY!

[Solo]

Exile the executives,
Let none escape.
Sentenced to imprisonment,
Their arrogance has sealed their fate.
Calculated economic devastation spreads across the globe.
Hidden agendas of voracious corporations are now exposed.
