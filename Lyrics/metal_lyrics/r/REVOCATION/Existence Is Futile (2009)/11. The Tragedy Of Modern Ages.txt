[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

Silence, the hymn to somber lands,
As nuclear winter descends.
The wraiths of past nations linger and loom
In the shadows of history's death.

An unsustainable standard of affluence
Has decimated the makings of man.
And commodity's gaping influence
Has distorted and defiled all the land.

[Chorus:]
Written in a timeless script,
The tragedy of modern ages.
Cries forth the dismal fate of man.
In bloodied, tear-stained pages. [2x]

Trapped within a fabricated world
Of Gods encased in metal beams.
Subsumed and enveloped,
In synthetic dreams.

Evolution holds a cunning trap,
The misfortunes of the human.
Are his works, though brilliant they may be,
They've led him to his ruin.

[Chorus 2x]

[Solo 2x]
