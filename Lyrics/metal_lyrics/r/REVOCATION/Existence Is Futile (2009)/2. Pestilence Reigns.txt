[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

I can hear the sirens
Screaming from the sky.
What will it take for me to sleep through the fucking night?
For now it is over.
But how long will it last?
A new day reveals the destruction,
The onlookers just gasp.

Mortar rounds and napalm.
A city under siege.
Mothers clutch their dying children.
Don't tell me, this is just another casualty (Fuck no!).

[Chorus:]
Pestilence reigns, bringer of plagues - the end is near.
How can there be a tomorrow? There was no today.
Catastrophic, misanthropic, darkness is now under way.
The light of the future comes only from burning remains.

Another sleepless night,
Another air raid.
I can feel the terror set in, coursing through my veins.
Annihilation, anxiety,
My fearful thoughts drowned out by the deafening artillery.

Mortar rounds and napalm.
A city under siege.
Mothers clutch their dying children.
Carnage in the streets, set this shit up,
One, two, three... go!

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
