[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Buda]

The corpse master presides
Over congregation zombified,
Indoctrinating the populace.
A military nation.
Upon the eve of war.
Inflicts retaliation,
On enemies in distant shores.

Gripped by an iron hand.
Military industrial.
Exterminating the dissident voice.
A military nation.
Upon the eve of war.
Inflicts retaliation.
On enemies in distant shores.

The fog of propaganda.
Instilled across generations.
Inhibits thought, sapping vital motivations.
Proliferation instead of disarmament.
Destined to fail, meltdown is imminent!

Overlord overthrown. [2x]

A challenge to rise from the rhetoric. (Overlord!)
Dismantle dictators and rancorous politics. (Overthrown!)

[Solo]
