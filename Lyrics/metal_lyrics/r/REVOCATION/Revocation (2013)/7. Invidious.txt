[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Roll out the bogus talking heads,
Tell us all how to think.
Bearing the chalice of disinformation,
Which we unwittingly drink.
Fraudulent opinions with zero integrity,
Calculated to foster animosity.

[Chorus:]
Besieged by the media blitzkrieg,
Under attack from hyperbole.
We've seen what cannot be unseen,
Demoralizing our society.

I refuse to swallow the pill,
To choke back their swill any longer.
Pushing the agendas of the hate mongers.
Twenty-four hour news cycle, rinse and repeat.
Tune in for the latest tragedy of the week.

[Chorus]

Besieged by the blitzkrieg. (Besieged!) (Blitzkrieg!)
Overwhelmed by crisis fatigue.
What we've seen cannot be unseen. (What we've seen!) (Cannot be!)
Visions of catastrophe.

Their vile rhetoric is noxious,
So nauseating and toxic.
Spewing their bile, it is sickening to hear
Their backwards logic.

[Solo: Davidson]

Worshipping tragedy,
Profitable calamity,
Ratings go through the roof,
Stay tuned for hyperbolic insanity.

Ratings go through the roof,
Stay tuned for hyperbolic insanity.

Insanity!
