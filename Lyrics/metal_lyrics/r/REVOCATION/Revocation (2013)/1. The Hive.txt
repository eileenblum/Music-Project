[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Signalled by pheromones, the mark of doom's been placed,
Death squad deployed, the colony must be erased.
Ominous droning of wings echoes on the wind,
Swarming elite descend, the slaughter to begin.

A superior genus,
The highest order of hymenoptera,
Horrifying behemoths,
Completely defenseless against the terrors.

Completely defenseless!

Infiltrate the hive,
A massacre of inferior brethren.

Drones rendered helpless in the face of this attack,
Unstoppable voracity, nothing can hold them back.
Moving with one purpose, killing with efficiency,
Winged creatures lay siege,
From this massacre, there will be no reprieve.

A superior genus,
The highest order of hymenoptera,
Horrifying behemoths,
Completely defenseless against the terrors.

Completely defenseless!

[Solo: Davidson]

An orgy of evisceration,
Thoraxes severed by mandibles ravenous.
Thousands lay gutted, from this extirpation so calamitous.

Succulent larvae, the spoils of war.
regurgitating the brood, gorging on gore.
