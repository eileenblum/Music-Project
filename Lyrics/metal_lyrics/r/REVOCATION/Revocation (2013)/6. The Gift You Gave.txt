[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Emptiness in my bones,
The void you left me.
Woe is all I know,
Shackled to melancholy.
Delving deep inside,
Scrape away the crust.
Revealing what I hide,
All that's left is a husk.

Replay it over again.

[Pre-chorus:]
Memories affixed in my mind,
Your remembrance is a bane.
With every stroke of your pen,
Authoring my pain.

[Chorus:]
This is what I've become, what you have made,
I will curse your name till my final day.
Burying love in a frostbitten grave,
Undying hatred, the gift you gave.

Fractured and fragmented,
Forever cold to this world.
Ice coursing through my veins,
Animosity unfurled.

You are the sour taste
That still lingers on my tongue.
I will curse your name
Till the dying breath that leaves my lungs.

Replay it over and over again.

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Solo: Davidson]
