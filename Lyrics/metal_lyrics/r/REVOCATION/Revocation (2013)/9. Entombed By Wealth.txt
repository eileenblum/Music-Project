[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Building up your empire, by any means necessary,
Your only goal was to aspire
To a selfish life devoid of charity.

Never caring for those in need,
Accumulation of assets driven by greed.
Your health has failed you in your later years,
A corpse to be stricken with fear.

[Chorus:]
Your palace is now your tomb,
But no one will mourn at your grave.
Entombed by wealth, by greed consumed,
Death is the debt you must pay.

The shrivelled shells of kings,
Rotting in their crypts.
All your wealth you leave behind,
Your legacy doesn't mean shit.

Clutching your scepter, adorned with jewels,
Here lies the end of a pitiful rule.
A decaying corpse cloaked in excess,
From avaricious affluence to nothingness.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Gargiulo]
[Solo: Davidson]

[Chorus 2x]
