[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Possessed and mindless,
Completely lacking substance,
Worshipping gossip and insipid excess.

Consumed by consumption,
Devoted to dysfunction.
This is what you've become,
Vapid, empty.

[Pre-chorus:]
You cannot help yourself,
Obsessed with nothing else but blather.
Glorified banality,
With no humanity, just chatter.

[Chorus:]
Zombified, the brain-dead now arise.
With desire in their eyes, and nothing on their minds.
Can I defy? Or be commercialized?
We must sever the ties that bind.

What has bred this culture?
Full of distractions,
Caring not for significant issues,
Only for coming attractions.

Programmed by programming,
Stupefaction is what they bring,
Liquefied brains melting,
Cling to nothing.

[Pre-chorus]

[Solo: Davidson]

These numbing agents,
Spreading their contagion,
Infecting our society.
We have fallen into a deep narcosis,
Enslaved, yet thinking we are free.

[Chorus 2x]
