[Music: Gargiulo, lyrics: Davidson]

Spewing bigotry from your pulpit,
I will hear no more.
No respect for any of your beliefs,
Your religion is a bane I abhor.

Always the one to cast the first stone,
Your hypocrisy is legendary.
How much blood must be spilled?
To satisfy a God imaginary.

Throughout the ages
How many were persecuted?
To satisfy your beliefs.

Total refusal of your message,
We don't need to be saved.
Will never be a fucking sheep in your flock,
Indoctrinated and enslaved.

Soldiers of Christ lay down your arms,
How many must fall upon your swords?
Preaching discrimination all in the name of your Lord.

Throughout the ages
How many were persecuted?
To satisfy your beliefs.

Followers following,
Never questioning,
The bullshit you're swallowing.

Shepherd, we have scattered your flock,
Now your congregation has abandoned you.
Inspirer of hate, soon to be defrocked,
How pitifully you cling to your archaic views.

Preacher, we've come for you, to cleanse you of your sins,
Forcing your beliefs upon mankind, a holy war you cannot win.
Preacher, your days are few, the walls are closing in.
We will hear nothing more,
Zero tolerance for your moral corruption.

[Solo: Davidson]

Shepherd, we have scattered your flock,
Now your congregation has abandoned you.
Inspirer of hate, soon to be defrocked,
How pitifully you cling to your archaic views.

Shepherd, we have scattered your flock,
Now your congregation has abandoned you.
Inspirer of hate, soon to be defrocked,
Pay for the sins of your righteous abuse.
