[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

The beast is here with all of us,
Exerting its malign influence.
Warping and twisting our minds,
Molding us to become one with its kind.

Invading our homes, poisoning our families.
Its influence grows,
Slowly becoming one with the beast.
Hear its words, its whispers growing louder still,
Dividing man against his brother bending us to its will.

[Pre-chorus:]
We gaze hypnotically into its single glowing eye,
Mesmerizing the populace so that we may comply.

[Chorus:]
Behold the archfiend,
Harbinger of animosity.
Callous and obscene,
The lord of lies and bigotry.

[Solo: Gargiulo]

The beast is here with all of us,
Exerting its malign influence.
Warping and twisting our minds,
Molding us to become one with its kind.

Indoctrinating our youth, embedding itself within.
Staring into the glare,
Receiving its hidden transmissions.
Bear witness to its corrupting force,
Spreading its influence, with iniquity at its source.

[Pre-chorus]

The demon's power grows.
The longer that we remain in a trance,
Holding dominion over us, fostering ignorance.

[Chorus]

[Solo: Davidson]
