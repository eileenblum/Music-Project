[Music: Davidson, lyrics: Davidson]

Cracking the earth down to the depths below,
Burrowing deeper to where vapors flow,
We descend into the unknown. (To the unknown!)

Laying waste to the forest and plains,
Now a wasteland is all that remains,
Raping Mother Earth for a profitable gain.

Unearthing the crypts,
A foul stench spews forth from the deep.
The plates start to shift,
As open sores from the earth start to weep.

Carcinogenic chemicals injected,
White metal monoliths are quickly erected,
A growing populace becoming more and more dejected.

Flowing rivers of life now bring only death,
Mephitic pools seep and infect,
We continue to destroy at nature's behest.

Unearthing the crypts,
A foul stench spews forth from the deep.
The plates start to shift,
As open sores from the earth start to weep.

Smashing through the hardest of stones,
Thousands of feet below,
Dire consequences soon to be shown,
Unearthing effluvium from long ago.
Water so contaminated that it can burst into flames,
Poisoning the populace with vaporized remains.

[Solo: Davidson]

Smashing through the hardest of stones,
Thousands of feet below,
Dire consequences soon to be shown,
Unearthing effluvium from long ago.
Water so contaminated that it can burst into flames. (That it can burst into flames!)
Poisoning the populace with vaporized remains.
