[Music: Gargiulo, lyrics: Davidson]

Faint sounds coming from my window,
Is someone there?
Mind playing tricks again,
Must be the midnight air.

A foreigner in a far away land,
Growing ill at ease.
Weary from my travels,
Succumbing to fatigue.

[Chorus:]
A visitation, from the spirit realm,
By haunting visions, overwhelmed.

Dreamscape of a memory,
A place so familiar.
Is this reality?
Reflections from the mind's mirror.

Awakened as the drapery falls,
Entangled in the veil.
Confused in a cold sweat,
Lying naked and pale.

[Chorus 2x]

[Solo: Gargiulo]

Tentacled horrors,
Burst forth from below the ground.
A sinister voice echoes,
From the sky with a thunderous sound.

The specter hovers above like a black cloud,
Casting its shadow, an ominous shroud.

[Solo: Davidson]
