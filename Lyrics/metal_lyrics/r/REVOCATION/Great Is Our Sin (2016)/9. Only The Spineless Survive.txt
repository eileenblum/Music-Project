Devolved wriggling monstrosities roam through these halls
Subservient and cowering
Contorted bent backwards remove the spine
See the larvae slithering

Writhe in submission, you sold your souls for gold
Obedient to their overlords, in the grips of their master's control

Serpent's venom has become their wine

Drink deeply from the poison cup
Intoxicated and so easily coerced
Drunk on the power that corrupts

Only the spineless survive in this realm of greed
Only the spineless survive and now the gluttonous worms will feed

[Solo: Davidson]

Bought and sold
Corruption takes hold
Bought and sold
Systematic control
