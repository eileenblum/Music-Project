A heretic on trial for the crime of truth
I stand accused before thee
Orthodox inquisitors demand punishment for this blasphemy

Zealots cry out for blood
Forked tongues decree the holy word
Sentenced to the pyre
Injustice must be served

Suppression of knowledge

Questioning the origins of the cosmos and pondering our place within
Intimidation tactics, recant or face imprisonment

Unrepentant and defiant against this ignorant theocracy
A theorist in search of answers engulfed by the flames of hypocrisy

Abolishment of wisdom

[Solo: Davidson]
