Dragged before the blood court
Soon his fate shall be sealed
Will he be hanged from the gallows or broken upon the wheel?

The white staff of justice breaks before the condemned
And so it has been decreed by the sword he shall meet his end

Marched through the streets in your own funeral procession
The crimson banner, your epitaph
The bloodthirsty mob demands his head

Theatre of horror
A macabre spectacle

The final act in this drama of sin

The executioner awaits the command with sharpened steel in hand
Ready the sword, the time has come to render justice unto the damned
Smite at his neck, sever the head
Arterial spray showers the crowd in a brilliant flash of red
Hands tightly bound behind your back
The crowd awaiting your final gasp
The bloodthirsty mob demands his head

[Solo: Davidson]

[Solo: Gargiulo]

Horrified spectators behold brutality
Grotesque entertainment, morbid curiosity
