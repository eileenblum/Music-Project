Bow before he, worship on bended knee
Consecrated, the host on which you feed
Hungrily awaiting the feast
A congregation of cannibal devotees

Place your lips to the chalice of the divine
Revel in the glory of this turpitude
Eat of my flesh and drink of my blood
These gifts I bear for you

[Solo: Davidson]

Enter into this cannibal covenant
Through this sacrifice we all are one
Receive the human Eucharist
Unholy communion
My body and blood your victuals
Anthropophagus ritual
