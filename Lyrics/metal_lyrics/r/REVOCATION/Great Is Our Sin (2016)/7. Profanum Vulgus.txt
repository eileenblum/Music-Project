Obelisks of avarice, building towers of vanity
Shielded from consequence in opulent majesty

I shall avert my gaze
From the profanum vulgaris
Shunning the needy and the lame
Those fit only to serve us

[Solo: Davidson]

Corpulent gluttons prepare for the feast
Ravenous hunger, the dine on the weak

Egotist your avarice knows no bounds
Still you sit indignant on your throne of greed
Covetous hoarder of wealth, your lust for gold so obscene
Yet emptiness still fills you inside, the blight of the soulless king

[Solo: Davidson]

Vultures circling above the carrion
Corpses picked clean in a lightless dawn

Predators of rapacity
Insatiable voracity

Manipulators expand the divide
Pitiful plebeians, the common herd I decry
