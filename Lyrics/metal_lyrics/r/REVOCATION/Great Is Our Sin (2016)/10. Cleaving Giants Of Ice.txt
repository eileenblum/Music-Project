Mountainous guardians
Sentient beings of the north
Man, the ultimate betrayer
Shattering this crystalline realm

Adversaries of Jotunheim
Strike their spears into hearts of ice

Oh, the folly of man
Forever stained, the blood on our hands

Glacial ablation, calving into the sea
Frostbitten giants drowning amongst the debris

Adversaries of Jotunheim
Strike their spears into hearts of ice
Written in the thaw
The epitaph of all mankind

[Solo: Davidson]

Fractured arctic continent
Extinction imminent
