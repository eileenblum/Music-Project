[Music: Gargiulo]

A doomsday declaration the signs we cannot ignore
The oceans start to boil the dead wash up on our shores
Rivers flow with toxins sickening all in their wake
Swallowing the poison, savour its virulent taste

Foolishly we followed our rulers into the abyss
Critical mass no turning back weâve fallen over the precipice

Monolithic ignorance
Devoid of intelligence
Devolved comprehension
Reversed progression

Extinction rates growing mankind in a pestilent blight
Cancerous, the disease spreads devouring all life
The earth a barren wasteland, sulphurous smoke blacks out the skies
A dead planet now expires before our dying eyes

[Solo: Davidson]

Those who sought to rule this realm have only meddled with it
The errors of their foolish schemes have brought about our ruin
