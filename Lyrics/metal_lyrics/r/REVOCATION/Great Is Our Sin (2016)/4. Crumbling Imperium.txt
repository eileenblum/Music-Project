Dominion spread too thin
Leaders becoming madmen
Means to an end
Pendulum swings again

A certainty 
One day what is will not be
A world of entropy 
Unravelling society

Trepidation fractures the core
Violent upheaval on the brink of a civil war

Crumbling imperium
All Empires fall in time
Crumbling imperium
Advent of our demise

Castles of sand
Scattered to the wind
Empty hourglass
A new age to begin
Foolhardy kings
Drunk with power
Fallen republic
Spiralling downwards

[Solo: Gargiulo]

[Solo: Davidson]

Civilization in ruins
A world left smouldering
Havoc and terror afflicting all
Downward we spiral, bedlam ensues
Flames growing higher
Witness the empires fall
