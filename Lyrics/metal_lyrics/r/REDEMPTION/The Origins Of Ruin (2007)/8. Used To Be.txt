I don't know how to finish what's begun
Or how long I might wonder if it's done
Windows open when the doors are all closed
But if you step through them, you might forget the way back home

I was drawn, I was taken over Rubicons
All the while never realized I was gone
Windows opened when the doors were all closed
I stepped through and now I forget the way back home

Someone introduce me to the man I used to be
I can feel him struggling deep inside of me
I swear if it takes me until my dying day
That somehow I will find my way again

I have faltered, I have sacrificed, everything I once held dear

Windows opened when the doors were all closed
I stepped through them and lost my way
Somehow I know I'll be back again - I know I can save myself

I will find I'm back again
the man I used to be
I will
Find I'm reconciled with what I've hoped to be
I'll build a bridge to what I've lost and I will find my way
Back home again
