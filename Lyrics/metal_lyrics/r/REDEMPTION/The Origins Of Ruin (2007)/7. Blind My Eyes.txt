Can you see past this place
Where our failings took us unaware?
I have dreams of a future brighter than the past

Faith sustain me
Take away my fear
Hope reclaim me
Wipe these sins away
Love renew me
Give me strength to cross the gap between
Denial and the truth that burns so bright
It blinds my eyes

I have been to a darker place
Than I had thought I'd ever go
Your voice calling out to me
And now I know
I can dream of a future brighter than the past
