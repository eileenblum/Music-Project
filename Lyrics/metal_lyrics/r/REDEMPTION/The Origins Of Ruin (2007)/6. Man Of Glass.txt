Look at me - deep into weathered eyes that have
Seen too much of the world and far too many
Failings in myself

Look at me - deep into bones of glass
Shards of mirrors reflecting all the dark events of my life

If something doesn't kill us, it just might make us stronger
But I don't think I can make myself
Hold on for too much longer

Look inside - deep in the heart of one who is close to losing faith
But praying that his faith will see him through
Look inside - deep in a mind reviewing unanswerable questions
About what lies ahead

Am I falling away from what really matters,
And teetering on the brink of disaster
At a moment in time if we turn the other way
A different path would lead us to another fate
