I still remember the sound of your voice calling out my name
And I still remember my face examining itself, knowing things would never be the same
I still remember your smiling face across a crowded room
And I still remember, through the weathering of time, that first embrace that sealed our doom

Your eyes stare at me from every storefront
And your voice calls to me from every restaurant
And your laughter pierces me as I stand beneath the open sky
And your absence murders me as I sleep perchance to die

Seems like to escape is what I ought to do
But every road I take brings me back to you

I am frozen in the moment
Clinging to your memory
And I don't want the ignorance
That a spotless mind would bring
But I'm scared my dying breath may be your name

It's just like I sang to you
Everyone knows that we live in a world
Where people give bad names to beautiful things
And if it's really true
That people should leave once they've got what they came for,
I certainly hope that you're holding it close to you now

I am frozen in the moment
Clinging to your memory
And I don't want the ignorance
That a spotless mind would bring
But I'm scared my dying breath may be your name

I still remember the sunlight on your face that warm November day
And I still remember my heartbeat quickened by desire unaware of prices I would pay
I still remember the closing door, the night we said goodbye,
I still remember losing you for good and knowing that a part of me had died

Seems like to escape is what I ought to do
But every road I take brings me back to you

I am frozen in the moment, please do not forget me
Clinging to your memory 'cause I will not forget you
And I don't want the ignorance
That a spotless mind would bring
But I'm scared my dying breath may be...

Please let me be frozen in the moment
Let me hold on to those memories

And I pray that things will be alright
And I pray you'll think of me tonight
And I know somehow I'll be alright
And I hope that you're the same...
But I'm scared my dying breath may be your name
