Bind to me - keep me in the shadows of your life
Terrified - frightened I might step into the light
Drinking deep from wells of bitterness within your soul
Holding fast to self-deluding visions of control

You're convinced that when you're done and the day is through
The applause was just for you

Paranoid - jealousy is all you've come to know
Pettiness - make a friend into another foe

And now everything is done, and the day is through
Now there's no one left for you

Twist the blade inside of me and bleed me dry
'Cause there's nothing you can say to me to make things how they used to be again
I have built a better life without your lies - and I will not be broken

I don't need your blessing now
I don't need your fantasies
All your fictions don't sustain me anymore
Breaking bonds, I'm setting myself free

Blind to yourself and to see you pushed away
Empty-handed and alone now at the end of the day
All of your misguided claims are dead to me - did you think I'd let
You dictated everything that I could be?
