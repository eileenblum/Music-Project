Love can be beautiful and true, and itâs said it is enduring
After what you have put me through, Iâm not sure that I agree
Put faith in enemies more than in friends â theyâre much less likely to betray
But faith is quick to fade, and when it ends thereâs almost nothing that remains

Faith is quick to die these days, so often misplaced
With emptiness and sorrow, it quietly gives up the ghost
Leaving cynicism grinning in its wake

Love holds on a little longer; its death is more violent
In the end, with choking sobs we pick up the pieces and grow
And in time we just might learn to love again

Hope has no plans of going quiet into the night
Hope dies screaming and fighting with all it has
Hope dies last

Thereâs no dignity or shame when hope is put to death
Thereâs no words to soothe the pain and youâll beg for the end to your breath
And yet hope will have you coming back for more

Hope has no plans of going quiet into the night
Hope dies screaming and fighting with all it has
Hope dies last 

I am hurt but have not fallen
I am wounded but unslain
I will lay me down and bleed for a while
Then Iâll rise and fight again

Is it just being stubborn in the face of futility?
Is it lack of self-respect? Or is it bravery?
Maybe itâs foolish to hold on in vain
But hope is not prepared to lose its fight

Hope has no plans of going quiet into the night
Hope dies screaming and fighting with all it has
Hope dies last 

It fights without concern for vanity
Dignity is sacrificed to desperation
But it might be the finest part of me
And Iâll thank God that hope dies last
Though itâs broken and bleeding
Hope dies last
