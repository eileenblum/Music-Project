Push came to shove
The allegiant trust we built took center stage
Needed a lifeline
But you watched me as my body slipped beneath the waves

Thereâs a special place in hell for the disloyal
Who cut and run when needed most

So much invested
I thought you had my back as I had yours
Now that itâs tested
Your loyalty is just a bunch of empty words

Thereâs a special place in hell for the disloyal
Who cut and run when needed most
Stab the flesh, still it will heal
Time repairs even a broken body
Your betrayal cuts much deeper
Cast your silver in the field
And measure out your noose

We lash our craft to those of others
And place our faith in the rising tide
But in the storm you were revealed
Your humanityâs a lie

Less out of malice
And more just a sin of your omission
Your moral cowardice
Exposes you and all your insecurities

Thereâs a special place in hell for the disloyal
Who cut and run when needed most
Stab the flesh, still it will heal
Time repairs even a broken body
Your betrayal cuts much deeper
Cast your silver in the field
And measure out your noose

Stab the flesh, still it will heal
Time repairs even a broken body
Your betrayal cuts much deeper
Cast your silver in the field
And measure outâ¦
And measure outâ¦
And measure outâ¦
And measure out your noose
