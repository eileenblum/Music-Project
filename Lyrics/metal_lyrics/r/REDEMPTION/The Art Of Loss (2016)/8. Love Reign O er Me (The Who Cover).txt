Only love can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers laying in the fields

Love, reign oâer me
Love, reign oâer me
Rain on me
Rain on me

Only love can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high

Love, reign oâer me
Rain on me
Rain on me
Love, reign oâer me
Rain on me
Rain on me

On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spent apart alone
I need to get back home to cool, cool rain
I canât sleep, and I lay and I think
The night is hot and blank as ink
Ooh God I need a drink of cool, cool rain

Love, reign oâer me
Reign over me, over me, over me
Love, reign oâer me, oâer me
Love
