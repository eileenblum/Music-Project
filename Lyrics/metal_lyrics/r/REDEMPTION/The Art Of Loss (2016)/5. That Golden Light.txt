A random happenstance so much against the odds
But we both know thatâs always how it is
Afraid to open wounds, tentative yet hopeful
We somehow still decide to join the dance again

Broken individuals yearning to be whole

One day Iâll be standing in that light again
One day I will feel the glow
And all the things Iâve struggled with will fade away
And I will feel its warmth heal me

Memories are made, and then reduced to bits
Will I forget our story? Will you remember it?
A part of us dies every time
But without death we never are alive

One day Iâll be standing in that light again
One day I will feel the glow
And all the things Iâve struggled with will fade away
And I will feel its warmth heal me

Each time it feels like weâve given too much
But without risk weâll never know real love

One day Iâll be standing in that light again
One day I will feel the glow
And all the things Iâve struggled with will fade away
And I will feel its warmth heal me

One day Iâll be standing in that light again (I will stand)
One day I will feel the glow (and feel the glow)
And all the things Iâve struggled with will fade away
And everything Iâve ever done that led me to this day
And all that I might do could bring me back to you
And I will feel your warmth heal me
