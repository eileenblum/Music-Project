You have your reasons for waiting for the worst
Our learned behavior is so difficult to break
I have my reasons for clinging to my hope
Chances I have to take

The only conclusion is love over fear
Without it weâll never live

I have my reasons for pushing way too hard
Solving a problem where one may not exist
You have your reasons for wanting your own space
Just donât confuse yourself

The easy solution is letting us grow
So simple but yet so hard

I know youâve been so damaged by the choices you have made
I know you donât believe that you deserve what I would give
Please recognize that love must conquer fear
And that the struggle there is all life is

I understand that I can push things
To a self-defeating point
Itâs hard to make myself let go
In order to hold on

The last resolution is simply to be
Embracing the possible

I know Iâve been transformed by all the choices I have made
I know Iâve been afraid to make the leap of faith I need
One day perhaps weâll recognize that love must conquer fear
Thatâs what life is
