Shaken
Blind to your deceit
But I finally learned
That there wonât be a happy ending
Meeting your stare
Thereâs no answer there
Yet itâs clear on your face
That there isnât a happy ending

Sometimes it pays
Not to give up
But it heightens the pain
When all is lost

Falling
Totally out of reach
And I canât return
So there wonât be a happy ending
Is it my destiny?
A fate thatâs designed for me?
Must I accept
That there isnât a happy ending?

Sometimes it pays
Not to give up
But it heightens the pain
When all is lost

We can try to insulate ourselves
But thereâs a truth that we canât hide
Unless we open up ourselves to pain
We never truly are alive

Choices
All along the way
Shape what will come
So there might be a happy ending
I have my will
And sometimes my way
In control of my view
I will make my own happy ending

We can try to insulate ourselves
But thereâs a truth that we canât hide
Unless we open up ourselves to pain
We never truly are alive
With realization comes empowerment
And the truth will set me free
Iâm an author in my story
And its end depends on me
