I can't believe my ears
I can't believe my eyes
The silent beast within
Is this my time to die?
Was it something that I did?
Or that I left undone?
Did the hand of fate
Just strike me down
There's nowhere I can run
As I'm told what I must do
And what they'll do to me
I'm not sure I can take this
But I have no choice
Sprinting towards the cliff
Closer to the edge
Death itself gives chase
And I can't find my voice
Find my voice
Everything's changed now
No matter the outcome
It can't be the same again
No way to go back
All I ever knew
Laid waste in an instant
In the blink of an eye
Life can pass you by
Oh no, here it comes again
The wheel comes 'round
To crush us underneath
