Push the needle in my arm and give me poison
I can take whatever comes, I will not bow
This is just another battle in the war
And I will scratch and claw with everything I have
And I won't pay the ferryman -- I won't be taken to the other side
And you have to know (your threats have all become so hollow)
I am so much stronger now (like strawmen falling apart)
And I have the will (birth has always been a terminal condition)
To fight until the final beat of blood escapes this heart
(I am steeled, spirit strong with resolve in my heart)
Pull the marrow from my bones and then destroy it
I can will myself to overcome this all
Give me everything you've got, I defy you
I will break you and will laugh as you go down
And I will not gently to the night
Death where is your victory
I've struck you down
The truth for all to see
You tried to kill meâ¦but Iâve killed you
And you have to know
I am so much stronger now
And I have the will
To fight until the final beat of blood
And you have to know
I am so much stronger now
And I have the will
To fight until I've crushed you
I am steeled; spirit strong
And I will crush you
