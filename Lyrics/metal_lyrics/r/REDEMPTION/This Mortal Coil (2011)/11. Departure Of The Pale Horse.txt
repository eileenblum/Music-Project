Emerging into the light
A thousand empty pages
Left to me to write
And I won't subjugate my dreams to mortality
I won't live every day I have as if it is my last
But I'll live each to the full
The poison stops, its work is done
I'm half surprised that I'm still standing
I've returned to the road
That I was on before this happened
Seems so long ago
The pale horse skulks away
Its rider empty-handed
It's not about some act of courage
I only did what I was forced to
My will to live was stronger than
The will to die that I once had
But that I have let go
Never to return
The preciousness of life
The lesson that I've learned
That I've learned, that you've learned
And that we all are learning still
(where is your victory? where is your sting?)
I've looked death in the eye
Turned and walked away
There's nothing left to fear
I have stood in the path of the tornado
Where life goes by in the blink of an eye
And they won't be selling tickets to my funeral, no tickets
I've dreamt them, I've dreamt them, the nightmares from the pit
I have broken the back of the noonday devil
I've crushed the skull of the devil
Let it rain, keep raining now, keep raining now,
Keep raining now, keep raining now
I've have brought my life in focus, I've brought my life in focus
And it's perfect enough for me, it's perfect enough for me,
It's perfect enough me
I will begin again, I will begin again
I'm stronger than death
And the pale horse departs
