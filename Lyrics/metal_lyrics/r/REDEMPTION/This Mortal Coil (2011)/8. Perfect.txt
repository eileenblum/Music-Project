This could be anything
This could be everything
Don't let a fantasy
Keep you from being free
We all dream of how things could be
(dream of how things could be)
But the wise make peace with reality
Girl, we're just wasting time
Come and see what we find
On the other side
We all dream of how things could be
(dream of how things could be)
But the wise make peace with reality
We should devour life
Suck the marrow from each day
But so many times
We stand in our own way
And make the perfect the enemy of the good
Perfect
We all dream of how things could be
(dream of how things could be)
But the wise will embrace the good
We all dream of how things could be
(dream of how things could be)
But the wise make peace with reality
