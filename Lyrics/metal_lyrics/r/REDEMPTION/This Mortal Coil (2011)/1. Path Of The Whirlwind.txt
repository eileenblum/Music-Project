Fear surrounds me
I struggle not to yield
Panic taking hold
Rising in my chest
Desperate, casting around
Searching for a foothold as I'm
Falling away, further each day
Slipping into the black
In the path of the whirlwind
No way back
No way home again
Pain engulfs me
I shut it off and focus but I'm
Helpless and left without an
Option I would choose
Disbelief -- I'd like to fill
Myself up with denial but I
Just have to face, I'm losing the race
Slipping into the black
In the path of the whirlwind
No way back
No way home again
All alone
When the walls come down
See the light
Die without a sound
