Reflection
A mirror held upon a life
As the minutes turn to hours
Hours blurring into days
Attention
To all the things left undone
To the words we were too afraid to say
As each passing second slips away
Let it rain
Wash away the poison
The stains of past misdeeds subside
Let the water bring life
In a world of second chances
No surrender to the plague inside
Asking just to start anew
Contemplating irony
A body fed with venom
Seeking life from death
Searching
Searching for the meaning
Can the lessons learned unburden the struggle
For one fortunate enough to have the chance
Fortunate enough to start again
The road unfolds before us all
But where it leads no one can see
So walk without regret and without fear
But never lose your empathy
I'm seeing what I can only hope
Is light ahead
Iâm standing, with an ever-growing faith
That now is not my time
Oh let it rain
