You and I alone
Standing on shaky ground
Wondering what became of yesterday
Everything seemed simple then
We fit together hand in glove
But now everything has changed
Somewhere in our past we
Strayed and lost our way
Now I search for us
But we're not here
Looking at you now
You're so far away
Our connection's lost
Looking at me now
I can't recognize myself I can't count the cost
Somewhere up ahead perhaps our
Roads will cross again
Somewhere maybe hope is still alive
There's an emptiness within
And an isolation here
That I never thought I'd feel
With you beside me
There's a coldness to your touch
And there's nothing in my heart
And the life we made is hanging by a thread
