[m/l van Dyk]

Hiding in the theater, listening to Tom
Telling whitewashed lies about the China Pit
Whatever has happened, started when they opened it
And brought out the carvings from the deepest part

David leaves the others and falls asleep while praying
A vision of sister then appears to him
Sent by God to show him, the truth of what transpired
And what the few survivors have to do

The Chinese came, and were made slaves
Deep in the mine they broke through, to the
Pirin Moh, the home of Tak
The Heart of the Unformed

The red eye of Ini, where its evil lies
Smoke from it drove the men mad
And they murdered each other, except for two brothers
Who caused the cave-in as they escaped?

Blamed for the cave in, and hung by the town
But Tak is one of them and swears his revenge
A hundred years later, the mine is reopened
And the madness begins again

Bodies wear out, but the souls must survive
Evil and good are eternal
The path of the truth is much crueler than lies
But it sacrifices us in the end

Mary hears a voice, and goes to seek it out
She thinks that she hears Ellen Carver somewhere near
But Ellen's rotting body is the vessel now for Tak
Who captures her and takes her back to the mine
David explains the truth to the others
Tak from the well of souls, another dimension
Took Collie's body, the evil awakened
And now the must destroy this affront to God

Bodies wear out, but the souls must survive
Evil and good are eternal
The path of the truth is much crueler than lies
But it sacrifices us in the end

Johnny now recalls, what really happened in Nam
Tak was in the Vietcong that planned the bomb
Could have warned the others were he less concerned with stealth
But he sprinted from the building and only saved himself

Deep inside the author knows
The boy is right and their path is clear
He finds a God he never knew
Closes his eyes and prays

Bodies wear out, but the souls must survive
Evil and good are eternal
The path of the truth is much crueler than lies
But it sacrifices us in the end

Bodies wear out, but the souls must survive
Evil and good are eternal
The path of the truth is much crueler than lies
But it sacrifices us in the end
