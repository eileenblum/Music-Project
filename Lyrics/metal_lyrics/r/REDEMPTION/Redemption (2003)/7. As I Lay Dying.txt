[m. van Dyk: l. van Dyk/Schooling]

As I lay dying I saw the eyes
The eyes of God.  Thy kingdom come
A force so strong pulled me along
As I lay dying

As I lay dying I laughed as I
Had never laughed before
At circumstance and the evened score
As I lay dying

As I lay dying I touched the air
Felt the chill, the blinding stare
Of my mind's eye, began to cry
As I lay dying

As I lay dying I felt so strange
Although I bleed, I feel no pain
And just like life it seems insane
But now I'm dying

Look at your soul in the mirror
Every choice you've made is etched upon its face
Epitaph carved by your actions
Are we searching for a different state of grace?
No one is sure of the answer
Is this just a waiting room for something else?
How can you measure life?
Is it something we must lose to find ourselves?

Will it just go on
After I am gone?
I saw above my heaven
And beneath as well
The threat of hell
Will my sins be forgiven?
