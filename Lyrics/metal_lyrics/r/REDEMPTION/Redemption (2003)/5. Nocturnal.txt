[m. Versailles/Roy/van Dyk: l. Roy/van Dyk]

When we enter its domain
Will the answers follow
Or will the wind and rain
Predict tomorrow

Or will they combine
And dictate our fears
Feeding our minds
The violence here

We can end the apathy
Nocturnal

When we enter the darkness

Will our heart lead the way
In the land of thoughtless
Or will you just fan the flames

Or will they combine
And dictate our fears
Feeding our minds
The violence here

We can end the apathy
Nocturnal

We can end the apathy
Nocturnal

The blackest night before the dawn
Nocturnal
