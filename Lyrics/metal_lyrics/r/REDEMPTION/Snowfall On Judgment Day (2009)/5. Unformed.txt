You haven't drawn a breath
But I know you
Still unformed, and yet
The flame burns true

And I can't stop what's already begun
Where can I go when nowhere else exists to run

You haven't scarred me yet
But I feel you
Not yet manifest
But the pain burns true

And I can't hide from what's about to come
Inevitably everything will be undone

[Chorus:]
Someday I'll find the life I gave for you
One day in time and I will start anew
One life to live, and now it's up to me
To take back what was lost
When all of this came to be

I've never seen your face
But I know you
A disembodied voice
But the words ring true

Fate doesn't ask permission
But I won't give in

[Chorus]

I'm charging through my weakness
And you can't slow me down
My will is much too strong
For me to fail without a fight

I don't know what to feel
With everything unreal
I won't go quietly
I am resolved

[Chorus]
