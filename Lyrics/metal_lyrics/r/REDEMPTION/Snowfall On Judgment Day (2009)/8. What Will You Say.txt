What will you say about me?
Will you say I was a good man?
That you felt my love and that you loved me too
What will you say about me?
Will you say that it was perfect
Or it wasn't worth the pain I put you through?

Seems so strange
We just let this slip away

One day in the arms of another
When you're close enough to share
The dreams you'd wished would be
What will you say about me?

What will you tell him about me?
Will you say that we were soulmates
And you knew our lives were meant to be as one?
What will you think about
When you've a family all your own?
Will you wonder where your other half has gone?

Happiness
Slips like sand between our fingers
Never to return

One day in the arms of another
When you're close enough to share
The dreams you'd wished would be
What will you say about me?
One day (one day)
Far apart from each other
Will you think about the chance for love you threw away?
What will you say?

We had more than most have dreamed
And I cannot conceive
The reasons that you couldn't let it be
And as the years go by
And we live out our lives
I'll always wonder why
you wouldn't spend yours here with me

One day in the arms of another
When you're close enough to share
The dreams you'd wished would be
What will you say about me?

One day (one day)
Far apart from each other
Will you think about the chance for love you threw away?
Will you think about mistakes you made along the way?
Will you think about the place that we might be today?
What will you say?
