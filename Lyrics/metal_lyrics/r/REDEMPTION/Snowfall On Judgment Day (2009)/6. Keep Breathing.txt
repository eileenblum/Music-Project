Seems only just yesterday
I held you, and sang a song about your eyes
So perfect, and innocent, now failing
My God I'd rather die
Than live with you in pain

Resilient, transcendent, and fearless
I hope you realize just how strong you are
But I'm weak
I just don't know how I'll make it too far
For you I'll have to try
For you I'd give my life

And though it seems I can't go on
For you I'll be strong

Every day
I used to pray
For a miracle
Faith, now giving out
But for you I
Must keep on breathing

Every night
I'll hold you tight
Be sure that you feel me there
Though sometimes I want to give up, for you
I'll keep on breathing

I'll be there at your side
Your strength's my inspiration
For all you'll ever need
I promise I'll be there

Don't you be afraid
You're stronger than you know
You will be all right
You've already won

I'll be there at your side
Your strength's my inspiration
I'll breathe for you
And I love you
I'll always be there
