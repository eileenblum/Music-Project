Thrust your hand into my chest
And pull out a fistful of sand
Cast it down upon the ground
And watch as it blows away

The world keeps spinning ever-on
And dark hair turns to gray
The ticking clock cannot be stopped
And so goes another day

Falling down
Spirit broken
Hollowed out
Never to return

Dig your hand into my eyes
And pull out a fistful of sand
I can only see betrayal now
So I'm better blind

It didn't have to be this way
But I can't reclaim my yesterdays
And so I'll let the string play out
As I lie crushed by my self-doubt

Fallen down
Spirit broken
Hollowed out
Never to return

Words mean nothing
Promises but lies
And my life's hourglass
Empties out before my eyes

One life
One chance
A single invitation to the dance
Choose wise
Choose well
Good intentions pave the road to hell

Words mean nothing
Promises but lies
And my life's hourglass
Empties out before my eyes
