I've been peeling away the layers
Digging to the center
Trying to find some common thread to follow
Turning to face the mirrors
In deepening reflection
But all the answers seem to be so hollow

Face buried
Hands clawing at the sand
I've built myself this fortress
But now the walls are cracking

I've been sifting through the pieces
Searching for a pattern
Trying to find some hidden sense of purpose
Going down blind alleys
Has me putting out my eyes
'cause I don't have the will to see what's there

Face covered
I'm shutting out the world
Retreating in this shell
And waiting for the blackness

[Chorus:]
Would I know peace of mind?
Is it true?
Would you know what you'd find
If you searched for it, too?
What you do depends on you
So explore
What I'll be depends on me
And what's there at the core

I look into my eyes
And nothing gazes back
Shadows without substance
Fading into black

[Chorus]
