Leviathan rises
From the ocean of our fear
Falling to our knees we cower
Bequeathing to this edifice
A monopoly of force
This parasitic beast is drunk with power

We've let our fears destroy
Our dignity and freedom
And turned our backs on all
The principles we once held dear

Behemoth rises
From the soils of jealousy
Equality enforced on pain of death
Mistaking mankind's progress
For a dialectic truth
And smothering the spirit that's behind it

From each according to ability we'll give away
To each according to his need
Until the years grind into dust

Cast off the chains we've made
And refuse to dig our graves
Stand up, the lives we save
Will be our own

Reclaiming liberty
We'll starve the beast

We've let our fears destroy
Our dignity and freedom
And placed ourselves beneath the heel
Of our own entitlement

Cast off the chains we've made
And refuse to dig our graves
Stand up, the lives we save
Will be our own
