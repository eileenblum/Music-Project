[with guest vocalist James LaBrie]

Another day dies in the world I've made
It's a tragic and unsung passing
The zero sum of the time I've left
Claims another victim
Looking at all of the things I broke
Thinking that things could be different
If I'd only tried

Hand trembling
Sweat breaking on this brow
Exhausted now but the
Nightmares just won't let me sleep

Another night falls on the world you've made
And it's as black as a hate-filled heart
Strangle the love and reject the call
To rebuild this place
Encourage the strong to deny the weak
As you callously play your part
Devour the pain of the ones you've hurt
And spit it in their face

Hands shaking
Tears welling in these eyes
I turn away but the
Visions still persist

[Chorus:]
How far we've strayed
From supposed to be
We've chosen black instead of light
There's something else here for you and me
If we're prepared to fight

A new day dawns on the world we've made
And its filled with fear and wonder
The way it plays out will be up to us
And somehow, I'm still hopeful

Still standing
Resolve within my heart
Take these broken arms
And build

[Chorus]

How far we've strayed
How far we've strayed
There's something else
There's something else
