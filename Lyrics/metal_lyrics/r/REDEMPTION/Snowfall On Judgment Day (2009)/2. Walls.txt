Fifteen hours I've been staring at these walls
Waiting for the call that never comes
I thought I had figured it out
Giving you the benefit of doubt

[Chorus:]
Every day you build the wall
And I'm trying to break through
Brick by brick I'll tear it down
Until I reach the other side and you
You've made us prisoners
And I'm trying to set us free
But the final stones between us
Could be the very ones placed there by me

Fifteen months I've been staring at the wall
Waiting for the day that never comes
I placed my faith in someone else
What did you promise to yourself?
It's turned to dust

[Chorus]

Did you build it just to see
Who cared enough to try to tear it down?

Fifteen years I've been trapped behind this wall
Waiting for the change that never comes
Still I try to open up the door
But it's been oh so long
I can't recall the other side anymore

[Chorus]

I'll be waiting
I will wait for you
I'll be waiting
I'll still be waiting
