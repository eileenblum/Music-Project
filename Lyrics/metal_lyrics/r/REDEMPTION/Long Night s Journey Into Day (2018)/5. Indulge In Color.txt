I thought this strand was ours
That one day we would meet along its shore
That future is foreclosed
Denied me like a thousand more

Itâs over, the dream is gone
Out of reach for me after all
Preserved in perfect pain

They must have changed the way the game is played
Or I never knew the rules
I could see the prize within my grasp
And watched it slip away from view
I could try to second-guess myself
Or learn what kept me from the goal
Unless I see the point was not to have
The point was just to grow

What if thereâs no purpose served by blame
By me or someone else?

If I fear a world in black and white
I misunderstood the cause
The problem is the lens
The issue is perspective
Perspective!

And what if thereâs no purpose served by blame
Of me or someone else?

No more blackened window panes
I choose life in color
No excuses, unafraid
I will live in color
I face the light of day anew
Full of possibility
I can choose to change my view
I will live in color
No more need for blame
I will own my choices
I will light the flame
And I will live in color

I can try to take the world
And bend it to my will
But thatâs only a partial answer
Thereâs beauty in the ebb and flow
Grace in our missteps
If we see with open eyes

Realize thereâs no purpose
To be served by blame
Let it go and open wide your eyes
Lean into the ebb and flow
Embrace it when you fall
To rise again

A fuller spectrum lights the day
Strengthens it with color
Riches of a better way
Living life in color
I face the light of day anew
Full of possibility
I can choose to change my view
I will live in color
No more need for blame
I will own my choices
I will light the flame
And I will live in color

Unconfined by darkness
Unlimited by black and white
A world illuminated
I will see the color
In one life or many
Each moment is a masterpiece
I select the view
And I will live in color

Color!
I will live in color!
Color!
