So now I'm standing in the ashes
Remembering your face
If I'm honest and don't think too much about it
There are things that seem a challenge to replace

I know I let myself be played
Trying to fix a broken toy

More than healing, time brings clarity
I think of everything I had to keep suppressed
Perhaps the one you're using now can just ignore it
Or you'll wallow in each other's vapidness

We all bear scars, but some are too far gone
To know when they might be healed

I fought
I tried
But I will bleed for you no more
'Cause you're someone else's problem
I struggled
I cried
But I am paralyzed no more
And you're someone else's problem now

I know I canât expect
That you will count the cost
Youâre too myopic
To know what you have lost

I fought
I tried
But I won't bleed for you no more
'Cause you're someone else's problem
I struggled
I cried
But I am paralyzed no more
And you're someone else's problem now
I begged
You lied
I won't bleed for you again
'Cause you're someone else's problem
I suffered
I cried
But I permit myself a smile
'Cause you're someone else's problem now

I won't bleed
Someone else's problem
I won't bleed
You're someone else's problem now

You're someone else's problem now
