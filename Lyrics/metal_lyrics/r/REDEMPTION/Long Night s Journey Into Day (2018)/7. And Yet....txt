I know that you were bad for me
And you never really cared
Whether shallow or convenient
Your promises were empty air

And yetâ¦
And yetâ¦

I know that you were using me
I know I should move on
You consumed the very best of me
And I was just a pawn
And this wonât be the end of it
Even though itâs gone

Itâs not about intent
But lack of empathy
Youâre heedless and oblivious
Or maybe only cold

And I curse myself for caring
And I hate that I am weak
And I know these woods are beautiful
But Iâve promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep

But Iâm running
Iâm running

I know that it was poison
And yetâ¦
