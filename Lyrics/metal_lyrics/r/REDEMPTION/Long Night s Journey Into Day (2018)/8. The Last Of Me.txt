Last time to see this view
Last memory of you
Last time my tongue will have the taste
The final words I write
The final kiss good night
Given short shrift in my haste

Time moves slowly
Till we have none left

We all reach a point in life
When it takes more than it gives
But the tipping point is lost to most
In an instant it is gone
Though our time may still go on
Every memory becomes a ghost

Was that our last embrace?
Last time to see a face
Hear a voice or write a name
The final bottle bought
The final lesson taught
The final incident of fame

Time moves slowly
Till we have none left

We all reach a point in life
When it takes more than it gives
But the tipping point is lost to most
In an instant it is gone
Though our time may still go on
Every memory becomes a ghost

Time moves slowly
Till we have none left

We all reach a point in life
When it takes more than it gives
But the tipping point is lost to most
In an instant it is gone
Though our time may still go on
Every memory becomes a ghost
