The setting sun rings in shadows
The face of a little man
Consumed by insecurity
The world is such a threat
He tries to quell the voices
But isnât sure he can
So heâll do his best to control
Or pick up his toys and go home

The world must be so frightening
To make him feel so small
A pathetic situation
He doesnât matter at all

The rising sun bathes in light
The face of an arrogant man
Striving in the shadows
Cast by his success
He tries to reinvent himself
But isnât sure he can
So he tries to stand so tall
Because he knows heâs small

This world must be so fragile
To make him feel so weak
Laughable but tragic
Vainglorious but bleak

Shelley wrote the story
Two legs in the sand
Your monument is fleeting
And everything must end
Our legacy is writ by
And relayed by those who knew
Will anyone be left who has
A favorable view of you?

Spare me from your childishness
And petty insecurities
Take your grand illusions
And stay the hell away from me

Shelley wrote the story
Two legs in the sand
Your monument is fleeting
And everything must end
Our legacy is writ by
And relayed by those who knew
Will anyone be left who has
A favorable view of you?

Pride will come before the fall
Two legs in the sand
The rising sun is setting
And everything must end
The mark of what weâve done in life
Is viewed through othersâ eyes
And the truth of all your actions
Will cut you down to size
