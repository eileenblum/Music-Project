Who are you?
Who am I?
Particles of dust floating under threatening skies
Struggling
Foolishly
Doomed to watch inert, knowing that our dreams will die

We sell our hopes for stones to build
Temples of regret
We grow up
We forget
What we lost
Or even that we dreamed at all

How many of my dream
Will I watch die a violent death
While others seem to watch theirs thrive?
Like children let loose in a hostile world
Stumbling blind with grasping hands
That cannot reach the light

We push the boulder up the hill
To watch it crash back down

How have I changed?
Where is the summit?
Iâve been climbing all my life and want to see
And all that I invest in
Does it just wither?
Or is something to be learned eluding me?

Build a castle in the clouds
And watch it fall to earth

Itâs a struggle through the night
To keep our hopes alive
If we make it to the day
Can they still be saved?

Should I dare to dream?
Should anybody dare to dream?

âResilience is its own rewardâ
I can hear the fools all say
Is it better if we have no hopes
Than to watch them turn to ash and blow away?

No disappointment in a life
In a life that does not hope
In a soul that never strives

But how empty is that life?
You can scarcely even call it one
Itâs really just existing

Itâs a lie denying pain
Pain is real without a doubt
But sufferingâs a choice

And if dreams are just our energy
They never really die
We reshape them with another voice

We can choose to die with old dreams
Or live and dream anew
Itâs a long nightâs journey into day
But come what may Iâll make it through
Yeah I will make it through

Itâs a struggle through the night
To keep our hopes alive
If we make it to the day
Can they still be saved?
Itâs a struggle through the night
But the promise of the day
Can sustain us through our pain
We can dream again

Dare to dream
Dare to dream
Keep on dreaming
Keep on dreaming
