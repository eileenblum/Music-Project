Thereâs a storm on the horizon
Thereâs a shadow on your door
Thereâs a sense of dread thatâs rising
And itâs coming back for more

It doesnât matter what you say
Too late to change the damage you have done

Thereâs a feeling you canât run from
Thereâs a gnawing sense of doubt
The wheel has come around and caught you underneath
We all know what youâre about

It doesnât matter what you say
You canât escape, thereâs nowhere left to run

The quiet of the night
Is the hope of empty men
But the eyes you cannot face
And you wonât be rid of them

Thereâs a vision in your nightmares
And eyes you dare not meet
Your soul is dead and hollow
Dehumanized
Dehumanized and incomplete

It doesnât matter what you say
You canât escape, thereâs nowhere left to run
It didnât have to be this way
It didnât have to be

The quiet of the night
Is the hope of empty men
But the eyes you cannot face
The eyes
The quiet of the night
Is the hope of empty men
But the eyes you cannot face
And you wonât be rid of them
