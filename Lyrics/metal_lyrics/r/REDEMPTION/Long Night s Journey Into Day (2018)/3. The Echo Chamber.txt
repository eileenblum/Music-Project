When you hear a voice in marked opposition
You and others like you demonize the speaker in derision
You surround yourself with thinkers of your kind
Never challenging your view or opening your mind

You're polarized and blinded

There was a time when we might speak
And seek the common ground
That dialogue now lost to us
The distance too profound

When your vision is not what I want to see
When the words you speak are challenging or threatening to me
I can close myself away in this cocoon
Reinforced by others not reflecting on our view

We're polarized and blinded

There was a time when we might speak
And seek the common ground
That dialogue now lost to us
The distance too profound

We're polarized
We've deepened this divide
We're out of reach and blinded

There was a time when we'd engage
And seek the common ground
That dialogue now lost to us
The distance too profound

There was a time when we'd engage
And seek the common ground
That dialogue now lost to us
The distance too profound
