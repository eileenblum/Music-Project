Nothing lasts forever
Changelessness is death
Still a part of us will fight it
To our dying breath
Nothing can be permanent
The machines of this place will fail
The illusion of stability
Across our eyes a fragile veil

I am I, the voices cry
Wreaking havoc on the world
Fleeting and impermanent
The tempest ever swirls
Fragile and ephemeral
Summer never lasts
The sting of pain will leave you
All agonies will pass

Change will come
Plans undone
Anticipate it
And then act, don't run
Accept the tide of change
Or it will drag you under
Don't rail against a life of change
Embrace a life of wonder

Change will come
Plans undone
Anticipate it
And then act, don't run
Accept the tide of change
Or it will drag you under
Don't rail against a life of change
Embrace a life of wonder

Change will come
Plans undone
Anticipate it
And then act, don't run
Accept the tide of change
Or it will drag you under
Don't rail against a life of change
Embrace a life of wonder
