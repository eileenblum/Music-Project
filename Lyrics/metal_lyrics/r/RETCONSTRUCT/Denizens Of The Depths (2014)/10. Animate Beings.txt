Whoâs there we call eternally to the stars far out of reach
Spare some solace we beseech we are not alone are we

Every golden age of wisdom veiled by mankind's superstition
The tenets of most religions historyâs own science fiction
That ageÂ­old urge to believe in others like us gods or demons
Our captors or our companions even now we call out to them

Who we are what we know warns us we were never alone
Harbingers and our own ancient ancestors have all shown
From the stars then below we were only wantonly sewn
Evermore left to grow rampant on this world we call home

Whoâs there we call eternally to the stars far out of reach
Spare some solace we beseech we are not alone are we

Somewhere across the vast abyss others like us ask the same things
Staring far out into deep space searching for animate beings
Whoâs there we call eternally we are not alone are we

Who we are what we know warns us we were never alone
Harbingers and our own ancient ancestors have all shown
From the stars then below we were only wantonly sewn
Evermore left to grow rampant on this world we call home

While weâre held in fascination
By our own imaginations
Theyâll continue observation
Mind control and mutilations
Medical examinations
Painful experimentations
Scientific vivisections
Cybernetic augmentations
Reproductive violations
Guided genetic mutations
Hybridized abominations
Meant to lead the next invasion
Should we face annihilation
Or live under subjugation
Our captors are our companions
Even now we call out to them

We are not alone, are we?
