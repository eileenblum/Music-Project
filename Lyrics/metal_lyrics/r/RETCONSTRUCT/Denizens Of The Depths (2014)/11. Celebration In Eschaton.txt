The celebration begins in ancient rite
Passed down through generations by candlelight
A thousand incantations tell of one sight
A doomsday revelation they all recite

The last age of humans apex civilization
Transfixed as one nation in rapt anticipation
Applaud as their world ends with a standing ovation
For that grand old descent Â­ straight down into Eschaton

The wondrous world that once was wants once more
Where weary years rewinding wonât restore

The clock counts backwards tick by tick
The veil unravels stitch by stitch

The celebration goes on in ancient rite
Passed down through generations by candlelight
A thousand incantations tell of one sight
A doomsday revelation they all recite

The lives of many outweigh those of a few
A land of plenty awaits the one who knew
Once laid to waste as the only place that fits
Since our whole race has worshipped apocalypse

The last age of humans apex civilization
Transfixed as one nation in rapt anticipation
Applaud as their world ends with a standing ovation
For that grand old descent Â­ straight down into Eschaton

The celebration now ends in ancient rite
Passed down through generations by candlelight
A thousand incantations tell of one sight
A doomsday revelation they all recite

There will be a celebration straight down into Eschaton
