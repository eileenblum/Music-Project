We weave the web of time and space
Even where stardust dissipates
With an interest in every place
Trusting in us Sisters of Fate
Watch everyone in existence
March oâer the land like pestilence
Once theyâve played their parts in events
Weâll let the Grand Old End commence

Human miseries made from their mistakes and envy
Hatred and disease theyâve been ravaged by all of these
Tragic maladies and we Fates finally agree
End their suffering euthanize their dying species
End all men

Spin from the sins of the divine
Count the span of each lifeline
Cut when the clockâs out of time
Now ends all of damned mankind

Crows fly above their fields of war
Calling accounts of what's in store
Mouths full of filth will dine no more
This world will join the one before
Reapers arise this last harvest
Swinging of scythes shall know no rest
Ripe for demise by hand of Death
Collect the lives of all our pests

The sons of gods have lost their sight so struggle centuries to survive
Theyâve left us Sisters to decide their days are done forfeit the fight
When every fervent battlecry calls for assisted suicide
Weâd be remiss to not oblige letâs cut the ties all men must die

Human miseries made from their mistakes and envy
Hatred and disease theyâve been ravaged by all of these
Tragic maladies and we Fates finally agree
End their suffering euthanize their dying species
End all men

Spin from the sins of the divine
Count the span of each lifeline
Cut when the clockâs out of time
Now ends all of damned mankind
All their clocks are out of time
Now ends all of damned mankind
