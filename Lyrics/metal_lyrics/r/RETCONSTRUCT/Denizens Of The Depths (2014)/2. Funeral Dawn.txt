Awakened by dusk our hunger beckons us to hunt in the dark as cowards without heart
Not for sport or lust only because we must this cycle restarts until we fall apart

Our old heroes rest in the Blessed Isles far from the souls that wander Asphodel
Where down below dark Tartarus awaits a hell for those who dared defy the fates
Yet still for us thereâs no place....

All those golden days are gone the sun for which we long
Will shine its rays upon our funeral at dawn

Awakened by dusk our hunger beckons us to hunt in the dark as cowards without heart
Not for sport or lust only because we must this cycle restarts until we fall apart

Our old heroes rest in the Blessed Isles far from the souls that wander Asphodel
Where down below dark Tartarus awaits a hell for those who dared defy the fates
Yet still for us thereâs no place....

Blood for a while colors our skin even though inside weâre rotten
Why must we suffer this one sin just to crawl back in our coffins
For the night weâre tempted again by a life weâve long forgotten

All those golden days are gone the sun for which we long
Will shine its rays upon our funeral at dawn
Those golden days are gone our funeralâs the dawn
