Time turns round Â­ in the storm
Death drains down Â­ the maelstrom

This present persistence, the future feeds on the past
The victors, the vanquished, vanish into the vortex

Turn back time... Worlds rewind
Turn the tide... Override

Time turns round Â­ in the storm
Death drains down Â­ the maelstrom

Old worlds extend outward, upturning the ocean
Oblivion opens as feverish fathoms

Turn back time... Worlds rewind
Turn the tide... Override

Time turns round worlds drown
Death drains down
The maelstrom

Turn back time... Worlds rewind
Turn the tide... Override

Dark waters drag downward, demanding, descending
Denizens of the depths, devouring, deafening
Wild winds wail, wide waves swell, serpentine swallowing
What once was, wants once more, remorseless rewinding

Death drains down
