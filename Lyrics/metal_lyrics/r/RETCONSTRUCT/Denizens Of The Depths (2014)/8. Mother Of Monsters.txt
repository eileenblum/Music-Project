Her tentacles wrap âround everyone
Her mandibles snap through flesh and bone
She feasts upon us in every form
Sheâs ravenous when the beast is born

Mother of Monsters awaken embrace us in infinite arms
Sever our souls from their prisons replace that which we have outworn

Darker than midnight burning without light
She is the same as she was in the last life
Mother of Monsters the netherworld terror
Goddess of the past sheâs the divine destroyer

Shadows dance with her in secret places
Demons romance her with shifting faces
She is the blank space between bright stars
A thief that steals screams from our nightmares

She serpentine winds round worlds which came first
Under the wondrous surface of old Earth
Writhing restless she still calls out our curse
Death for the masses blessed by her rebirth

Mother of Monsters awaken embrace us in infinite arms
Sever our souls from their prisons replace that which we have outworn

Darker than midnight burning without light
She is the same as she was in the last life
Mother of Monsters the netherworld terror
Goddess of the past sheâs the divine destroyer

Her tentacles wrap around everyone
Mandibles snap through flesh and bone
She feasts on us in every form
Ravenous when the beast is born
