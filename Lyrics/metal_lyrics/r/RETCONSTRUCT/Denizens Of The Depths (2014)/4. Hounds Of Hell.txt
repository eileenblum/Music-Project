Who made a deal at the crossroads
Whose bloody seal marked a soul sold
Who on a bad bet gambled 10 years
Whoâs hounded by Hellâs debt collectors now

Hounds of Hell howling only those damned hear
Their death knell tolling it's been 10 long years
There is no escape or stalling when the devilâs dogs come calling

Hear how the humans beg on their last night
Bartering for a decade of more vice
Fortune and fame or pure carnal delight
Already gained but for one time price
Desperate debtors offer sacrifice
As if weâd claim instead a loved oneâs life
We will not even allow suicide
Drag them to Hell alive by the dogâs bite

Who made a deal at the crossroads
Whose bloody seal marked a soul sold
Who on a bad bet gambled 10 years
Whoâs hounded by Hellâs debt collectors now

Down through those hallowed halls we will leave them doomed to the pitch abyss of our kingdom Roaming
among its throngs of the mislead choking upon the words of the wicked
Calls of the condemned pleading and screaming held in the the jaws of flesh eating demons
Horrible monsters with multiple heads pulling apart the bones of the undead

Hounds of Hell howling only those damned hear
That death knell tolling it's been 10 long years
There is no escape or stalling when the devilâs dogs come calling

Hear how the humans beg on their last night
Bartering for a decade of more vice
Fortune and fame or pure carnal delight
Already gained but for one time price
Desperate debtors offer sacrifice
As if weâd claim instead a loved oneâs life
We will not even allow suicide
Drag them to hell alive by the dogâs bite
