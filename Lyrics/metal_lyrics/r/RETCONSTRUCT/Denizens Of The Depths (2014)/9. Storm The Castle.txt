Coiled like a snake up on top of the mott cold as the lake that encircles the lot
Bled to the fields in the bailey below deathâs in harvest where only graveyards grow

By whose command have we been dying when not a manâs laid eyes on our queen
Some say her cursed castleâs concealing dark sorcery and demonic dealings

Storm the castle Â­ letâs lay sac like those days of old
Hellâs cathedral Â­ calls for the next influx of souls

Sheâs let her monsters feed from the kingdom thatâs why the map says here there be dragons
Should we fight back or wait while weâre eaten better weâre martyrs than be her victims

Stone towers extend into the clouds thrust up like clawed hands trying to catch God
Black tattered pennants dance in the wind bend like the backs of the tenants within

Who if not Godâs men collects our tithings is it the Devilâs coffers weâre lining
What recompense then are we expecting from a fortress which does no protecting

Storm the castle Â­ letâs lay sac like those days of old
Hellâs cathedral Â­ calls for the next influx of souls

Sheâs let her monsters feed from the kingdom thatâs why the map says here there be dragons
Should we fight back or wait while weâre eaten better weâre martyrs than be her victims

Storm the castle Â­ letâs lay sac like those days of old
Hellâs cathedral Â­ calls for the next influx of soul
