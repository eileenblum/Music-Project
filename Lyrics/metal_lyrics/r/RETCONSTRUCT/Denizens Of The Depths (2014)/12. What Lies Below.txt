We are the dead resurrected by rage who in wake of disaster raise the new age
Artificial endangered damned to their fate still they call on us masters open the gate

The body is worn the bond is tight
When the wanton soul in torment makes its sacrifice
For the flesh of their young is a succulent prize
But forbidden fruit is best feasted upon when ripe
When the boughs of vice hang low their delights
Denizens of the depths devour all in sight
Shall we drink our fill from the wellspring of life
Delicious served to us in silver chalices of light

Behold their souls all abandoned adorn the land like rays of sun
Sustained in silent sweet repose possessed of what Hell lies below

We are the dead resurrected by rage who in wake of disaster raise the new age
Artificial endangered damned to their fate still they call on us masters open the gate

On the backs of the broken we climb to the sky
Where the gates of Empyrean open wide
And the frozen tears of all their cries
Rain down from Heaven as its angels die
For their fallen frames and torn off wings
Carve out the catacombs of conquered kings
There the serpent breathes through gnashing teeth
Fire from the furnace of eternity

Behold their souls all abandoned adorn the land like rays of sun
Sustained in silent sweet repose possessed of what Hell lies below

When all mankind is laid to waste
When signs of life have been erased
Weâll find our final resting place
The graveyard of the human race

Behold their souls all abandoned adorn the land like rays of sun
Sustained in silent sweet repose possessed of what Hell lies below
