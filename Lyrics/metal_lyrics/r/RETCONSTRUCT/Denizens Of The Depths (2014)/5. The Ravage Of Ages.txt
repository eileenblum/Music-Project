Even now we hear their screams echo from antiquity

Whatâs left of once inhabited places grand monuments and underground mazes
Last effigies of forgotten faces whose shall survive the ravage of ages

Clouds of smoke roll o'er the sky turning bright day into night
Ashes in silent descent join the Earth with firmament

Not even the gods can save us cries for help unheard are useless
Currency is void gold worthless there is just one price to pay when thereâs no time for escape
When heaven descends upon us and the dark depths rise ravenous
Station name and caste are pointless there are no masters or slaves when all suffer the same fate

Whatâs left of once inhabited places grand monuments and underground mazes
Last effigies of forgotten faces whose shall survive the ravage of ages

Even now we hear their screams echo from antiquity

The sea in its tempest rage sends relentless tidal waves
Walls of black swallow the shore lands of man turn ocean floor

Heaven descends upon us Â­ the dark depths rise ravenous

Stones rain from above savage tremors tear the ground
Hells chamber walls fall while the squalling sea surrounds
Embers burn our eyes and these wicked waters drown
None are left alive when the world turns upside down

Not even the gods can save us cries for help unheard are useless
Currency is void gold worthless there is just one price to pay when thereâs no time for escape
When heaven descends upon us and the dark depths rise ravenous
Station name and caste are pointless there are no masters or slaves when all suffer the same fate

Whatâs left of once inhabited places grand monuments and underground mazes
Last effigies of forgotten faces whose shall survive the ravage of ages

Clouds of smoke roll o'er the sky turning bright day into night
The sea in its tempest rage sends relentless tidal waves
Heaven descends upon us Â­ the dark depths rise ravenous
