Stay forever play while their world wastes away where till this day our bones long submerged lay
And may together our souls never stray from where the water fades into the grey

Down they all fell trapped in time victims of their own nursery rhyme
Theyâll never tell what did they find dancing around the well that night
Letâs never grow up thatâs what the cat said while batting around its own detached head
Weâll stay awake when adults are in bed since weâre pretending why donât we play dead
There'll be no more sick and no more grieving after all arenât we just make believing
At that last question it flashed a wide grin and with a clawed paw it kicked the head in

Stay forever play while their world wastes away where till this day our bones long submerged lay
And may together our souls never stray from where the water fades into the grey

Dolls that we dug up from the damp earth circle the table served ladies first
Dressed in their Sundayâs best and of course rags around sores which no longer hurt
Tipping their tea cups still we suppose itâs not the flavor they would have chose
Nor was the water drawn from our well when the entire township fell ill
And the adults all took to their rooms abandoning their children too soon
We have been waiting all these long years to entertain some new visitors

Down they all fell trapped in time victims of that old nursery rhyme
Theyâll never tell what did they find dancing around the well that night
Letâs never grow up thatâs what the cat said while batting around its own detached head
Weâll stay awake when adults are in bed since weâre pretending why donât we play dead
There'll be no more sick and no more grieving after all arenât we just make believing
At that last question it flashed a wide grin and with a clawed paw it kicked the head in

Stay forever play while their world wastes away where till this day our bones long submerged lay
And may together our souls never stray from where the water fades into the grey
Down they all fell trapped in time victims of that old nursery rhyme
Theyâll never tell what did they find dancing around the well that night
