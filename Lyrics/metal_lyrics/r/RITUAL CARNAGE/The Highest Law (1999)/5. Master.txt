Lord of the flames, lord of the light, I invoke
Give me the power, give me the will, your might
For you are the truth, and you are the way, my life
For we are the evil, we are the path, arise

Satan, master, of hell, you lead, this war
Destroy, those of, the white light

Apostles of hate consuming the weak, we fight
Lord of the arms, lord of all might, exalt
Thrusting the knife, ripping the flesh, death
Burn in the heat, burn in the fire, devour

Lord of the flames, lord of light
Give me the power, give me the will
For you are the truth, and you are the way
For we are the evil, we are the path
Master of light, leading our way
Lord of the arms, lord of all might
Thrusting the knife, ripping the flesh
Burn in the heat, burn in the fire!
