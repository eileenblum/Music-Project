Bound in duty to torment and pain
Inflicting my vengeance on those who deceive
Reaping the lives of my torment
Destined to slay the prophets of lies

Cast down from heaven I lead
Unholy war of evil
I blaspheme the name of white light
And swear my allegiance to the black

For I am the serpent, devourer of light
Loathed and feared by mortals
Stare in the eyes of darkness
And perish in my domain of death
