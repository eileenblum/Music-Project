Leap forth the demon, from teh gates
The lord of sodom, the god of cain
The fatal forces, path of the left
Obey the forces, or viscious death

I will rape your soul, by the rites of Lucifer!
The spawn of Satan, armed with the flame
For he's the terror, of Hades
The hostile servant, creature of hate
The god of darkness, shall rise again

Angel of hell, the lord of light, demon of lust
The souls we reap, upon the throne
Of baphomet, hail to the beast, for eternity!

We raise our swords, and praise the beast
For he's the master, the ancient one
The lord of sodom, the god of cain
Consuming mortals, for evil reign

Damnator
