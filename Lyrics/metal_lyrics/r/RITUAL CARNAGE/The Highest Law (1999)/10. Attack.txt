I summon the legions, to open the gates
Unchain the master from the abyss
Seeking our vengeance, destroying the earth
Total destruction, the kingdom of christ

Rise up mighty father of light
At darkness we attack
Behold the beast, hail to the hordes
The legions of doom and destruction below
For he is the father, the children of hate
For we are the terror, yes we are teh feared

For they are the weak, yes the cursed shall be damned
The rodents of christ they shall perish in flames
Pelt them with fire and bath them in blood
At armageddon the christians will burn
