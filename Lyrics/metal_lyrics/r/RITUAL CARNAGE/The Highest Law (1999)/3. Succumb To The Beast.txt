The abomination, of mankind
Purges all, of carnal desires
Exploitation, of the weak
Lost forever, to the void

2000 years of christ
Succumb to the beast, or be killed
Lucifer!

Fall to your knees, obey my word
I am the best, 6 hundred 66
Scrath out the eyes, ripping the flesh
The witching hours, I will attack

Striking like, the fangs of a snake
Genocide, of all who believe
In the feeble word, of fucking christ
Wave upon wave, the hordes will attack

With the plague as my weapon
With only one goal in mind
Hurl my victim to their death
Behold the beast for he is the way
