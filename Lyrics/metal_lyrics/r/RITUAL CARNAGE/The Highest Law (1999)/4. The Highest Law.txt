I prey upon, inflicting pain, the forces of deceit
Thriving on hypocrisy, your rule I will defeat
Back stabbing bastard, your unrelenting lies
The end is near, the time has come
For you to fuck'n die

Tormenting cancer, I obliterate
Genocide, of your kind, is the only way
Infernal hate, for revenge is mine
In the name of vengeance, I will take your life

With blow to blow, and eye for eye
I will destroy thee, 100 fold
For I'm the terror, the one you will fear
Self preservation, the highest law

No longer living, so rot amongst the dead
Your damned oppression, vengeance my nemesis
Decaying carnage, the maggots will feast
For powers of darkness, will dominate
