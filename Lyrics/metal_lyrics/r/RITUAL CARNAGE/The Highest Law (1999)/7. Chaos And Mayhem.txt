There is no heaven and no hell in which to burn
Don't need your prayers or saving I'll redeem my own
False hope and empty lies they make no sense to me
Your Bible is your brain I'm not an invalid

My conscience is always clear
I'll never confess my sins
The cross no longer gives life
Your reign of power is over

Cast down from heaven I lead the hordes
Unholy war of evil total hate
Sworn to the black the symbol of fear
Chaos and mayhem is the life I live

Torment the holy that is my game
I vomit on the lord the king of kings
Witness of christ yes I despise
Repressed emotions of a psychopath

Repulsive servant of christ will die
For I possess the numbers 666
Impeled by evil my nemesis
Mortally wounded now your reign is dead
