Conflict of perseption, drowning in despair
Hallowed screams behind the lifeless smiles, I know they are there
Look into the mirror, I'm trapped inside a dream
My minds a storm, has lost its time, bordering lunacy
Dillusions, confusion, tearing at the seams
Taken hostage by my mind, think are not as they may seem
Shackled slave and servant, to the voice in my head
They won't stop until they have their fill, ampty fed

10 reasons to life, 100 reasons to die
The world is caving in, this is sanity's this line
Trapped inside these 4 walls, padded cell and cage
They set me free again, sadistic fit, anger and rage
Another cruel day emerges, more time to choose my fate
All warning signs ignored, isolation is my only escape
10 reasons to life, 100 reasons to die
My world is caving in, this is sanity's this line
No hope, no cure, my mental state is in drastic decline
Reality's withdrawl, this is sanity's this line

God has sealed my fate, lucidity awaits, at the pearly gates, they are locked
Serenity nears, salvation is here, razor blade severe self infliction
Pandemonium, time to get my gun, into oblivion, end my pain
Suicidal hold, time for me to fall, farewell to you all, death in calls
They won't rest, until I'm dead
