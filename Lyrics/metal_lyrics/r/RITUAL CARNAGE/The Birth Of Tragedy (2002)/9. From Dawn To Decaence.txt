From the birth of creation, humanity's downward decay
A realm of inconsistency's, if you dare turn the page
Fall to your knees and repent, never question his world
Fallacy lies in the texts of his ancient proverbs
From dawn to decadence, unholy book of lies
Succumb to deception, enlightment fantasized
I'll choose my own path, no need to witness to me
"Your bound for hell" evil is all you see
Inquisition, rivers of blood and wine, nails of rust
Here's your baptism of fire

Follow me or you'll be damned for eternity
Thiers no escaping my wrath, you must worship me
Cricified, died for your sins, the until I'm content
Investment for my love and faith, yes, your money's well spent
