Welcome to life, its your first day on earth, and debt has already incured
The taxman comes knocking, ots old Uncle Sam, his way of life must be procured
Pay or imprisonment, you have no choice, tyranny's supply and demand
Governmental monopolies, Big Brother's robbing me, democracy kills in the end
Gun control measures, our right to bear arms, inalienable rights in decline
Hook, line and sinkered, your fate in our leaders, their false hope and lies stand confined
America's drowning, with lawsuits conspiring, common sense meets its demise
Political overkill, favors left to furfill, rebellions beginning to rise
Life on my knees, they do as they please, in this brave new world
Who can you trust, life is unjust, in this grave new world
Too much control, reality's hold, in this brave new world
Monetary greed, surrounded by thieves, in this grave new world
For life and liberty, you must play their game
Revolution? No point things will stay the same
A no win battle, everyone will lose
No point in voting, no canditate to choose
Indepence from their dependent ways
The I.R.S. and all its red tape
Big government is robbing you and me
Democracy it kills, why can't you see?!

Open your mouth, it may just mean your death
Retaliation is all they know, they'll get you next
Punished for your point of view, free speech a myth
Finger points at you, removal is swift
Guilty of innocence, your life is no more
Judicial intervention, due process is ignored
Stolen identity, your past is erased
All previous signs of life are but a trace

Brave New World, Grave New World
Fuck your Brave New World!
Into the grave, New World!
