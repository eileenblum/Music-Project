A million horrors scream abhorrent, from their shallow graves
Blood frenzied warriors, human slaughter, the weaker foe erased
Imperial oppression, colonial possession, fuels the fire
Divinity's decadence, their world in chaos, divine empire
Bitter sweet victory, no regard for humanity, forgotten history, under a shroud of secrecy
The war machine screams at full throttle, awakening the damned
Steel forget for mass consumption, churning out the dead
The wings of death fly over head, the dragon strikes below
Gleaming swords rip through the wind, Emperor's soldiers of the throne

Brokered conspiracy to cover up the past, fragile history littered with broken glass
Expose the truth, don't hide behind lies, time doesn't heal those hideous crimes

Experimental human testing, Unit 731
Pathogens, bacteria, germs, bodies soon succumb
Limbs are frozen, bones are shattered, the smell of dburning flesh
Reprehensive laboratory, butchers of innocence
Tojo's will, once blessed to conquer, doomed and cursed to fail
Arsenal of divine power, steel showers and lethal hail
Violated, coerced to fight, senseless sacrifice
Souls are buried, stones left unturned, purgatory's cries
Bitter sweet end, displaced souls will never amends, forgotten crimes, a shroud of secrecy of
wartime
