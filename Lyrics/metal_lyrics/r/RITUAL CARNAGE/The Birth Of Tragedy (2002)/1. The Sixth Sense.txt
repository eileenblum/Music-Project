The Reaper's incarnate, cross my path
Malediction, cursed, mortal wrath
Deadly visions surge, subsequent
Whose the next to die, my sixth sense

Wraiths are menacing, tragedy
Every nerve, every, sensory
Forsaken next step, victims death
Suicidal fall, his last breath

Galloping, the 7 horsemen ride, waging their war within my mind
Morbid visions, invade my sleep, for death will follow, yes death it follows me

Pulsating, rapid, eye movement
Whose been choosen to, perish next
Shortest straw you choose, life forfeit
You're the next to die, my sixth sense
