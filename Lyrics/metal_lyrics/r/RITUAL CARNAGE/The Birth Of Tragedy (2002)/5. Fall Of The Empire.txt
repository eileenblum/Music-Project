The war of drugs, the war of terror, total war on all mankind
Deafeatist give in, nationalist will win, the bottomless surplus surge
Oppression, transgression, fall of the empire
Taxation, excessive, abolishment of state
The pupper master, his strings become entangled
Supremacy's fall, relinguishing all control

Cold war, out of date bureaucracies, their stranglehold, suffocates our liberties
The D.E.A. plauged by inabilities, covert operations dissolve

The pupper master, his strings become entangled
Supremacy's fall, relinguishing all control
Corruption ceases, decieptful policies void, imperial end, anarcho-capitalist mode

Horrific tales, have become the inevitable, closets are opened as skeltons are revealed
Innocence, collateral damage, cold steel knows no wrong
