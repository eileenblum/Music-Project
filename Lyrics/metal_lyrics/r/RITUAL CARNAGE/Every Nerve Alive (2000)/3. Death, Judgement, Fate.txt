The final war the final stand, his revelation is at hand
Death is knoking at your door, your worthless soul he's coming for
From the darkness he will rise, bringing fear into their lives
Slaughtering the lambs of christ, the mortal servants sacrifice

Death, Judgement and Fate, at the masters gate
Before the judge you stand, pathetic righteous man
He will fall, from his throne, the blackened servants of the night will take control
A thousand deaths, you deserve, there's no escaping sentence will be served
He starts to sweat, his body aches, the rider of the blackened horse has sealed your fate
On you knees, you will plead, on your day of judgement there is no mercy

Infernal legions storm the earth, their evil prophecy gives birth
A fallen angel leads the way, from the pit he's come toslay
Fires rage the waters rise, christianity's demise
Heed the powers of the black, viciously they will attack

He mounts his famished horse, with hades close behind
His sword in hand he summons beasts, with pestilence he will ride
His triumph is at hand, he leads you into death
There is no place to run or hide, for this your final breath

Born of heaven, riased in hell, burning cross the demon's spell
Angels lying dead, decayed, the prophecy immense dismay
Pandemonium arrives, broken hope and hole lies
The faithful masses gone astray, everlasting suffering
