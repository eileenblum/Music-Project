All is calm as we charge the hill
Situation is volatile
Mortal fire, machine gun burst
Makes me wonder, will I die first

Scars of battle
These horrors rage my soul
Scars of battle
These deadly dreams of war

Orders head for the fighting front
There's no clue, what's ahead of us
Lifeless tanks, death litters this place
Makes me wonder, is this my fate

Raining steel, skies are raining death
Destroying all lying in its path
Mangled armor is burning red
Bodies smolder, will I die next
