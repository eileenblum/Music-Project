I am the serpent that strikes without mercy
Yes I am the fangs piercing your putrid flesh
I am the venom that flows through you veins
I am the constrictor stealing your last breath 

I am the sadist tearing at your limbs
I am your master unleashing my sin
I am your maker and I choose your fate
I am aggressor come back in my hate 

I, infidel, leading your mortal souls into the gates of hell 

I am the soldier marching into war
I am destructor your kingdom will fall
I am the smart bomb, laden with might
I am the sniper my target in sight 

I'm the projectile killing by design
I am assassin your leaders will die
I am the missle pinpoint accuracy
I am the poison on which you will feed 

I, infidel, leading your mortal souls into the gates of hell
I, infidel, leading your feeble god into the gates of hell 

I am the car bomb which blows you to shreds
I am your reaper I'll lead you to death
I am the terror the death toll will rise
I'm the impaler as I crucify 

I am the savage come bathe in my fury
I am your judge stand before your jury
I am the demon I blaspheme your god
I am your satan I spit on allah!!! 

I, infidel, leading your mortal souls into the gates of hell
I, infidel, leading your feeble god into the gates of hell
Crucify your god at the gates of hell
