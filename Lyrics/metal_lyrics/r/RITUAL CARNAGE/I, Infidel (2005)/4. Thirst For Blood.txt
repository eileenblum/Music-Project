Blessed to kill, I'm ready to strike, I walk through the valley of death
I fear no evil, for god is with me prepared for the coming attack
Weapon in hand, my lust to kill, determined to eliminate
Firing pin ignites the fury, cold steel seals their fate
Lock and load, adjust my sight, and squeeze off another round
A raging projectile seeks it's target, moving the enemy down 

I need to quench, my thirst for war, cover in fear, or meet your demise 

Lightning strikes the hammer falls, a baptism of fire
Apocalypse upon the damned, the fall of there empire
Without fear and terminating, he surges in for the kill
To retreat is not an option, his orders he'll fulfill
On fields of flame he will converge, he knows of defeat
A soldier of the highest honor, menacing power, elite 

I need to quench, my thirst for war, cover in fear, or meet your demise
I need to quench, my thirst for blood, cover in fear, or die 

His ever yearning hunger, to spill the blood again
Another forsaken soul to waste, the product of inner violence
Annihilating those who stand, who dare to cross his path
A villent death is subsequent, apocalyptic land 

Tally up the head count, as he slays without mercy
For death knows only company, infernal misery
Bred to fight and trained to kill, unparrled violent force
To resist is all but futal, as fate takes it's course
With glory on the horizon, he will charge right into the light
With valor and his head held high, and victory in sight 

I need to quench, my thirst for war, cover in fear, or meet your demise
I need to quench, my thirst for blood, cover in fear, or die
