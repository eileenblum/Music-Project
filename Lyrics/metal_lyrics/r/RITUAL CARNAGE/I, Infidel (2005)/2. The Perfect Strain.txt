Behind sealed doors the plot is born
Complex pathogen
Modernizing ways to kill
You revenue at work
Chocking clouds of noxious fumes
Hover overhead
Internally feeding on the flesh
Implementing death 

Smothering constricting
Impossible to breath
Plagues and virus seal their fate
Annihilation awaits 

Slipping, the seconds tick away
A vile creation, devestation
No one is spared it's wrath 

Create the perfect strain
Cower in fear the perfect strain 

Blue suited, beauracrats
Funds their silent wars
Ignites and radiates
Demise of their world 

Chocking clouds of noxious fumes
Hover overhead
Internally feeding on the flesh
Implementing death 

Create the perfect strain
Cower in fear the perfect strain 

Slipping, the seconds tick away
A vile creation, devestation
Infects the flesh without mercy
Swift and silent death 

Smothering constricting
Impossible to breath
Plagues and virus seal their fate
Annihilation awaits 

Create the perfect strain
Cower in fear the perfect strain 

Plummet to, a shallow grave
The perfect strain, silent death
