For milleniums I've walked this earth, infinite I reign
On hallowed grounds on fields of fire, civilizations burn in flames
Consecrated, desecrated, leaders fall from grace
Wields a sword he cannot tame, the spiral downward is his fate 

The four horsemen ride, dark angels defy, path of the left, for I am war!! 

The bitter venom of the gods, fear them as they strike
Reaping havoc, reaping death, the evil spirit smites
Await the demons from their slumber, release them from their cage
Invoking souls of soldiers past, a blessed order of rage 

The four horsemen ride, dark angels defy, path of the left, for I am war!!
Fall to your knees, and worship me, damned for eternity, for I am war! 

Under bloody banners thousands charged
As steel meets flesh, warriors fall
Shrapnel tears through the hardened ranks
Bodies lying forlorn, as mother cry out their names 

Lightning strikes the hammer falls, the blood thirst begins
Mechanize and terrorize, cold steel forged for sin
Death doom destruction, mortal man of feeble faith
The final war, the final stand, the bowels of hell await 

The four horsemen ride, dark angels defy, path of the left, for I am war!!
Fall to your knees, and worship me, damned for eternity, for I am war!
