Gods and empire rise, and sooner they will fall
By war, plague and decay, as history has already shown 

In the world of the meek, men choose to crawl on all fours
Beyond good and evil, the all too human choose to decline 

Chaos infinite, a new vision of distant things
Law of the highest, self preservation 

As the faithful masses weep, death's head marches on
Fear runs through their spines, as the blackened horse awaits 

In the world of the meek, men choose to crawl on all fours
Beyond good and evil, the all too human choose to decline 

As moral world orders, form mortal hostilities
Where is your god when you need him, for repetnance and pity
I will decide my fate, I choose not a god
I choose to die, than live by your lies 

Machines make the man, as fools continue to breed
Build you from the ground up, programming your every move 

In the world of the meek, men choose to crawl on all fours
Beyond good and evil, the all too human choose to decline 

Triumphantly, victory is ours
Inexorable, elitist standing tall
Chaos infinite, a new vision of distant things
Law of the highest, self preservation 

March on!
