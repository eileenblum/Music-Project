I can't begin to describe the way I feel inside
Even with it consuming the thoughts in my mind
I've learned to accept the things that are wrong,
And give back to the world what it gave to me

I won't hide
Embracing it every step that I take,
staring him in, in the face

In a strange way I feel so free,
I feel so fucking free
I accept,
I accept my fate

They are always there in the back of my head
They aren't leaving until I have nothing left, this demon is taking control of me
They are always there in the back of my head
They aren't leaving until I have nothing left, this demon takes control of me

I've waited too fucking long to get what I've earned;
I'll accept this evil and take what's fucking mine
