[feat. Devin Stockwell of Feign]I am living proof evil hides behind the eyes,
So sew them shut,
Remove my tongue
I want to make sure there's no way out;
No way out

I've been beating my head until my thoughts regress,
Hearing voices seeing visions of the dead
Can't even sleep without their faces haunting me,
Plaguing my dreams,
Something's inside of me

Dead but alive,
Sent to suffer in time,
I am burning from the inside out

I feel it gripping my soul and he's not letting go.
Suffering is all that I see

[Devin Sockwell]
Grabbing ahold,
I will take complete control
Clutching your fucking soul with last breaths grasped in my hands
Consuming everything,
I will make you,
I will make you mine;
consuming everything gives me, it gives me peace of mind

[Anthony Alexander]
With this evil inside I refuse to hide
I am in control of the demons within,
And when I've slipped into the hell I've made for myself,
I'll take them with me

Face to fucking face,
You're not getting the best of me
You're in my head,
And these are my thoughts,
And I will use them to trap you in

[Anthony Alexander/Devin Sockwell]
We are one

[Anthony Alexander]
No one can stop me

[Devin Sockwell]
I am in control

[Anthony Alexander/Devin Sockwell]
We are one

[Anthony Alexander]
Live through me
