They're reaching out to me,
Telling me they could set me free,
In exchange for just one thing

Enticing me, further within
Promises of power, I am yearning for sin
I let them in

Voices inside my head
Telling me that they'll never leave
Is this all inside my head, or am I just losing it?

Fighting inside trying to find something to hold them back,
I am fighting for my life

You wanted to see a darker side of me

I'll start to dig my own fucking grave
Just to get ahead on rotting away

With every passing day
I tell myself, I tell myself I won't break
But it's only getting worse,
It's only getting worse
[2x]

My innocence is dead
[2x]
