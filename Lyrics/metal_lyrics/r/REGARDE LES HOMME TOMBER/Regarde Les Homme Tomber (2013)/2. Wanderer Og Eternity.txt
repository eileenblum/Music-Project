I swear
I've never ever
Soiled the name of God
And tasted sin
I swear
On the holy writings
My hands are clean
In the name of Lord

Bending the backbone
And hiding the truth

With the dawn comes the guilt
(With the stars leave the dreams)
And with the dawn come the fears
(With the night leaves the heat)

I squeezed the neck
Watching these eyes
Begging me, begging me, begging me
Watching me

Forever lost on Earth
I pay the price of murder
Forever lost on Earth
I'll be the evil martyr
Forever lost on Earth
I'll bring the desolation
Forever lost on Earth
For years of isolation

I squeezed the neck
Watching these eyes
Begging me, begging me, begging me
Tirelessly
Life has left this body
My beloved friend, my brother
I'll be the chosen one

Forever lost on Earth
I pay the price of murder
Forever lost on Earth
I'll be the evil martyr
Forever lost on Earth
I'll bring the desolation
Forever lost on Earth
For years of isolation
