Listen closely and pay attention:

Follow my lead
Throughout this world

I am stronger (than the Lord)
You just ignore my horns

Every man here
Must leave this Hell
Every warrior
Kill an angel

Let's reach the skies
(Let's taste Heaven)

Claiming your rage
Barking your wrath

Obey your sword
(Your souls aren't taken)
Respect your oath
(Hold your weapons)

The pride rush... to vanity
The fervent will of an army reaches
The peak of the ivory tower
Burn the skies with the flames in their eyes
Breaks the woe of the old tired man
The infernal skies reject the blaspheme

There's no male, no female
Just angels, awful and mean
Hiding the moon with their evil scheme

A thousand men, looking for Eden
Failing their holy mission
These falling men, curving the Amen
There are back to submission
In a funeral omen...

Crawl the highness of darkness
Highlight the den of the monstrous master,
Reach the peak of the tower of pride
Burn the skies with the flames of your sins

Ignore the woe of the old tired man...
