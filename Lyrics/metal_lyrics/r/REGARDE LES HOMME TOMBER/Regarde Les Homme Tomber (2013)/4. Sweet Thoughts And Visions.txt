Sweet thoughts
And pretty visions
Soft winds
Are rising
The sun is shining
A prefect body
And a companion
A perfect body
To raise a crown

A perfect world to live the perfect life
A perfect world to feed light

The garden of God
Is a heaven Nature

The heaven of Lord
Is only for the pure

You fool creatures
You Tools made of clay

(Enough with the pleasure
Now you live my way
I want more
A mind of man
Is not enough
Obey the rules
Is not enough)

Leave me alone
And never call me yours again
A world of peace
Is not enough
Leave me alone
And never call me yours again
I'm not a tool

I found the "I"

The garden of God
Is a heaven of Nature
The heaven of Lord
Is only for the pure
