As we have reached
The plain of Shinar
We stopped our hitch
Staring at Nimrod

Build
Rise

We built a tower
Ro rise to Heaven
We raised our hands
To the holy pride of Babel
Yet our Father, disagreed
Then split our tongues and fields

The land of God is the place
Where we belong
We're not afraid
Of the hands of Lord anymore...
For He is the weak
His monstrous reign
Mus take end now
We must bring Him
Down to the Earth
Where He belongs
For salvation
For He is guilty
For we are men
For He is the weak
