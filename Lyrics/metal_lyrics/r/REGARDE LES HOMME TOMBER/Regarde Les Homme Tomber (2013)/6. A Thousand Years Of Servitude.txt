A thousand years
Living for a God
Living as a dog
Running after absolution
Betraying his own flesh

A thousand years
Looking for a world
Waiting for a bird
The flood has murdered
To feed the anger

A thousand years
Living for a God
Living as a dog
Running after absolution
Betraying his own flesh

Shame on the sailor
Death to the saviour

Looking for a world
Living for a God
Running after absolution
Betraying his own flesh

A thousand years
Crushing your bloodBleak as dead wood
Squeezing the neck
As deep as your wreck

Floating on the Earth
With the wind of shame
Crashing on to the skulls of the men
Hiding your sins, bending your knees
Split the world!
