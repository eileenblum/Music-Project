A life of love and obedience
Where the true faith has replaced reason
A spiritual den 
(A religious rain of sadness and moan)

My Father
My Lord
My King
And my God

I devoutly followed
I piously lived
I feel like I dwell in Hell
Just feel like I dwell in Hell

Distress smashed on walls
Crying on the altar
A sheep among the wolves

Bleeding, dazed, yet offered
A bloody knee for a bloody faith

I beg for your mercy
I beg for salvation and redemption

My flesh, my blood are gone
I pray in vain the skies

Drowned in the flood of evils
Merciless for me, pitiless for me
I endure my life, the way I believe
I've lost, I've coughed, I've suffered

My flesh, my blood are gone
I grieve my people, alone
My flesh, my blood are gone
I give my word, my soul

I'm tempted to flee
The vermilion angel
I'm tempted to follow
The vermilion angel

My soul is barely gone
I feel like I dwell in Hell
All the evils belong
To the vermilion angel

The chasm of rest
Of death and silence
Has swallowed my body

Death and silence

The pain, the evils and sorrow
Gone for eternity
A never-ending fall
The quietest trek of existence

(I gaze at the silent sky
This place where only dwells the moon)
