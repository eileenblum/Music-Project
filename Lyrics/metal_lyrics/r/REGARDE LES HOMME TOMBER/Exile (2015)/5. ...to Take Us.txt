A feasting town illuminates the smoky skies above
The sleepless crowd celebrates the life and death of all
The endless flow of blood and wine

Waters sullied the earth of lust and anger
Gluttony corrodes the weakest souls

The hymn of debauchery
The song of the great misery

Can't you see these sins and horror
Can't you feel this unnatural behavior
Canât you hear the cry of Sodom

Who are these strangers who loomed out of the dark
They must return from where they came
This city is a noble one
See this halo, unnaturally bright

They came to take us
They came to kill us

Release them from this den
So they can hear the cry of Sodom

The hymn of debauchery
The song of the great misery
