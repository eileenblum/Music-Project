Sweet and sour
Where all the weak wander
A place of torture
A place of liars

O Lord and Father
Forever after
O Lord and Father
You'll be a sinner

Follow the lead
Whistled the wind
Heavenly sneaking
Slyly preaching

This place is Heaven
This place we call Eden
A land of fairness
A land of blindness

O Father
Forever after
O Father
You'll be a sinner

(I won't surrender
To a foul, to his words
Half god half coward)

I claim and order
This king to behold
The reign of a mother
This curse would be told
I'll never suffer
Anytime, anymore
I'll never suffer anymore

The stance of such a creature
Has no matter for the weaver
I disown you
I disown you, evil daughter

Thou shall lie down
Thou shall crumble
Thou shall lie down
Thou shall submit yourself

I'll set this land on fire
Where Abel lies, murdered
I'll set the earth on fire
Where all the weak wander

(I'll set Eden on fire
To purge this place of liars
I'll set the world on fire
To gaze at the flames of anger)
