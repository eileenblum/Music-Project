When the crows started to gather
And the night has come forever
The poisonous tongue whistled a heartwarming lullaby

The voice among the void
The rank breeze of salvation
The twisted branches sang this sinister lullaby

Stand and start your ascension
You are not alone anymore

The wanderer, exiled for the rest of your existence
Fear the celestial light
Embrace, embrace the black flames
Embrace, embrace the black flames

O son of Adam, be the first man to oppose your fathers
Leave your soul, enter the darkness
You are not alone anymore
Follow me and embrace the world you belong to

Follow me and embrace the world you belong to
Follow me and you will never be alone anymore
