[Wagner, Schmidt/Wagner]

C'mon now, c'mon now
Let's get closer, I'll show you how

Let's get into my car
Noone can see us and we got it warm

Get it out, get it out
No need to worry, everything's allowed

Ain't this good, yes, it's good
I know there's power in your underwood

Wohow, nobody knows

Get on up, get on down
Let's change it over, babe, c'mon sit down

Uh, I like it this way
One foot in the steering wheel that's OK

Wohow, nobody knows
Wohow, nobody knows
