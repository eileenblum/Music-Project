[Wagner/Wagner]

It's been a long night and it's cold there, outside
As I watch the break of day
It's starting to rain like the sky is crying in pain for me

I hear the sound of people running around
Life is there, beyond the door
I was with them, I know, just a few days ago but it's over

Dust in the wind
There is nothing lasting long
One thing must pass, the other's born
Dust in the wind
There is nothing left behind
All that we are's dust in the wind

Many were there, for my wounds they have cared
As I was lying on the ground
I wish I'd have made some friends
but now it's too late, I'm alone

Dust in the wind
There is nothing lasting long
One thing must pass, the other's born
Dust in the wind
There is nothing left behind
All that we are's dust in the wind

This is the end, brother give me your hand
I'm afraid to let it go
Noone's to blame if they forget
who's the name on my gravestone

Dust in the wind
There is nothing lasting long
One thing must pass, the other's born
Dust, only dust
There is nothing left behind
All that we are's dust in the wind

Dust in the wind
There is nothing left behind
All that we are's dust in the wind
