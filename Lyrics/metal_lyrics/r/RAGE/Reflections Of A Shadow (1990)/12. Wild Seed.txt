He grew up in a normal home
Real Typical, we'd say
One sister and two brothers
They were comrades for the play
The video was his best friend,
He watched it day and night
But death and war was alright

Wild seed, wild seed from the start
Wild seed, wild seed, injured heart

He'd seen his daddy drinking
And he learned to asked no whys
When Mom was lying on the floor
With tears in her eyes
He went out with his brothers
And they laughed about the hurt
They felt so good and strong
When someone was aching in the dirt

Wild seed, wild seed from the start
Wild seed, wild seed, injured heart

Oh, that's really wild
Really wild insane
Deep into social hell

He always thought that women
Are the servants of men's greed
And really was, astonished
When she called for the police
So he lived in a normal jail
Real typical, we'd say
And yesterday they killed him
When he tried to break away

Wild seed, wild seed from the start
Wild seed, wild seed, injured heart

Really wild
Really wild insane
Can he take the blame
