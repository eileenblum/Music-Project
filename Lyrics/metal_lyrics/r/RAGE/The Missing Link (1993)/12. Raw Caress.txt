[Music/Lyrics by: P. Wagner]

This time the wind has blown me forwards
from the sick and stinking harvest. I've laid her much too long.
I feel like an old and restless sailor
with visions long forgotten, a free will much to strong.

Raw caress

Right then, when darkness fell around me
and my fruits no longer ripened, and end was coming near.
Returned from a safe self-chosen prison
to a storm that ripped my heart out and took it far from here.

Pain and misery left its marks on me
start again from here
Cold reality needs to be set free
chances now at hand

Life's a raw caress, it's a raw caress, it's a raw caress to me.

And now, as I gather up my back bone
to rebuild it even stronger,
the clouds break up again.
It seems, even if fortune is tragic,
that a sad tale finds an ending that's reconciled again.

Pain and misery...

Reach out - the old eternal timewaves are flowing on and on.
Look up - the dawn is soon awaking, there's land in sight again

Raw caress
