[Music/Lyrics by: P. Wagner]

In her diary's black pages
the stories end in dark sadness
and what she never dared to say
is in her diary's black pages

She's a magician, she's got second sight
sends her mind wandering into the night,
into the future - stories untold
tragedies and accidents - she always knows

In her diary's black pages
the stories end in dark sadness
and what she never dared to say
is in her diary's black pages

Brother kills brother, family fights
Fire burns babies while the mother sleeps tight.
Whatever she's dreaming, it's gonna be real
She couldn't help it when she writes hat she's seen.
