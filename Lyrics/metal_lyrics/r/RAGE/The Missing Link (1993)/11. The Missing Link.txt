[Music by: P. Wagner, C. Efthimiadis, M. Schmidt, Lyrics by: P. Wagner]

Is it right or is it wrong
what Darwin said âbout evolution?
But why the advance in the apeman's brain
amongst the multitude of creatures in life's veins?

Now they found a fossil and they can't explain where it belongs
whoever was this stone remains -
his blood is flowing in my veins

The missing link
the thing that made us think
where we are from
and where our mind belongs
the missing link
from ages when the birth of man began

Now so what if it's as
the prophets said in olden days
an unknown father from the stars
brought words and wisdom to us all

Now the stones have given free a bridge to our unknown past
whoever was this stone remains -
his blood is flowing in my veins

The missing link
the thing that made us think
came far from space
was from an elder race
the missing link
from ages when the birth of man began

Is it right or is it wrong
what Darwin said bout evolution?

Now the stones have given free a bridge to our unknown past
whoever was this stone remains-
his blood is flowing in my veins

The missing link
the thing that made us think
came far from space
was from an elder race
the missing link
the thing that made us think
where we are from
and where our mind belongs
the missing link's remains should make us think!
The missing link
