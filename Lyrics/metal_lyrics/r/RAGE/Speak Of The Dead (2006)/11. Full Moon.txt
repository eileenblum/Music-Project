The sun is going down on a blood red sky
And I feel it coming from real deep inside
Now I gotta hide

Darkness blacker than black is creeping
Down from all of the trees around
Nothing moves, everything is sleeping
All that creatures won't make a sound

Won't you set me free, won't you set me free
When the full moon will rule the night

I need someone to share my silence
Lonely is it, a hunter's night
Can you feel what I feel and can you
Stand the nightmare to live this life

My beast from within companion in sin

Won't you set me free, won't you set me free
When the full moon will rule the night

I'm falling from grace

Won't you set me free, won't you set me free
When the full moon will rule the night
