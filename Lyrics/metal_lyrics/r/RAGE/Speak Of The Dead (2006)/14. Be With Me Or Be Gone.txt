We were the brotherhood
We blindly understood
Were all we needed, it was good
Has been as close, just as we could
But as the years went by
I've seen our friendship die
And when I look into your eyes
It seems you're going separate ways

The inner pressure to hold on tight
Is not a pleasure
Reflect your feelings, do what you want
You better let me know

You should be with me or you should be gone
(Don't waste my time)
You'd be with me or you should be gone
(Don't waste my time)
Be with me or be gone
Be with me or be gone
Stay on my side or leave me be

We went through thick and thin
We made it all begin
And formed a union hard as rock
A grooving machine that was locked
We must have lost this feel
Life's not like stainless steel
Corrosion of integrity
Deceased in our identity

The inner pressure to hold on tight
Is not a pleasure
Reflect your feelings, do what you want
You better let me know

You should be with me or you should be gone
(Don't waste my time)
You'd be with me or you should be gone
(Don't waste my time)
Be with me or be gone
Be with me or be gone
Stay on my side or leave me be
