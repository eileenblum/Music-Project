On a cemetary after midnight
See the dancing spirits in the moonlight
Open your mind, let the world in
You can see it's beauty, there is no sin

Madness - in your brain the quest won't end
Helpless - what is it that never we stop to hurt ourselves, this is
Careless - a force from within will send
Sadness - why don't we try to cut this chains, this chains. I tell ya

If we'd get over and then control our minds
No fear, no fear
No need to look for cover, leave it all behind
No fear, no fear

All that military, every weapon
Only shows how much we are afraid of
Being overrunned, being submitted
Everything we do in absence of love

Madness - we can't share, though all is there
Helpless - we get greedy, we wanna have all for ourselves. This is
Careless - arrogance ignores what is
Sadness - so afraid that it turns around, around. I tell ya

If we'd get over and then control our minds
No fear, no fear
No need to look for cover, leave it all behind
No fear, no fear

No more life to waste and no more tears to taste just
No fear now
Never hide away and always seize the day just
No fear now
No fear now, no fear now, leave it all behind
No fear now, no fear now, open up your mind
