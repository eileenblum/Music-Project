All my life it took me years to find my way
So hard for me to turn around
Ain't no way to dry my tears or ease my pain
I feel like I am burning out

It seems so long ago, it seems so long ago
Like I have been before
You taught me humbleness

You turn my world around
Turn it upside 'n' down
You turn my world around
I cry without a sound

All in vain, no second chance to give it back
You shouldn't have to take it all
All was stained and then this chain around the neck
The picture that had made me fall

It is so hard to say, it is so hard to say
If I can stand this grief
You gave me bitter years

You turn my world around
Turn it upside 'n' down
You turn my world around
I cry without a sound

You came into my life, took away what I've loved the most
You dried my heart and you killed my soul

You turn my world around
Turn it upside 'n' down
You turn my world around
I cry without a sound
