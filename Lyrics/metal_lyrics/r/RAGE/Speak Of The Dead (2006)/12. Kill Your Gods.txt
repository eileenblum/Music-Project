And in the moment of salvation
The only thing he could see was his guilt
He felt his lust was his guilt
And all his life was frustration
'Cause every feeling that he liked, it was killed
Like all his love that was killed

He prays to god to be forgiven for everything he is
A punisher, an angry father, noone needs this

Kill your gods, save your souls
Kill your gods, kill your gods, you'd
Kill your gods, save your souls
Kill your gods, you should kill your gods

To these old men in their robes, they
Are politicians for the sake of their power
It's for the money and the power
Don't tell the world how to live life
We lead our spirits on our own
We'd better kick you from the throne

Dogmatic rules and mighty preachers, the Lord, he sees it well
If he was such a lousy father - I say welcome to hell (Let's go to hell)

Kill your gods, save your souls
Kill your gods, kill your gods, you'd
Kill your gods, save your souls
Kill your gods, kill your gods, don't kill your brothers

Kill your gods, you'd kill your gods
