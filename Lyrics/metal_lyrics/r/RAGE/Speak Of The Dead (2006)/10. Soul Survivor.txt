So many screaming faces
Telling me tales I've heared before
I wanna tear down their masks of fake
And all these smiling dealers
Selling me lies I want no more
The're pretending to give but take

All I knew I gave you
I am a soul survivor
What I do, it is true
I am a soul survivor
A life describer, I'm telling no lies

The sharks have sharpened their teeth
Trying to bite and chew it all
What we fought for since all our lifes
I'ts only for the profit
Never it was for you or me
But so many believe their lies

All I knew I gave you
I am a soul survivor
What I do, it is true
I am a soul survivor
A life describer, I'm telling no lies

Oh, you better believe in yourself
Oh, you better be true to yourself
