So you think this was all for you
Disconnected you feel lonely and blue
You try to find the pieces of your heart
Turn around and look twice my friend
Something's tryin' to find a hold again
It seems that it was lost so long ago
It travels in your mind
Through ages you'll find
Your dark past is alive
Through ages you'll find your love
You have it in your memories
And it's all within your mind
Through ages you'll find your love
