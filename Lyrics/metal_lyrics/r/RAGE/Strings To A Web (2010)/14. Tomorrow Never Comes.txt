Aw no doubt in mind
I'm running wild oh I see the angels fly
All ups and downs let's drink out every cup
Swallow it all I hate the consequences
And I never wanna see
Believe it tomorrow never comes
It's easy when tomorrow never comes
It's only an illusion but it seems to be okay
The hardest part is wakin' up one day yeah
All drowns in pain everything hurts
I've seen my anger die
What used to be is just a memory
Reality has brought me to my knees
And now decay is here to stay
Believe it tomorrow never comes
It's easy when tomorrow never comes
It's only an illusion but it seems to be okay
The hardest part is wakin' up one day yeah
What used to be is just a memory
Reality has brought me to my knees
And now decay is here to stay
Believe it tomorrow never comes
It's easy when tomorrow never comes
Believe it tomorrow never comes
It's only an illusion but it seems to be okay
The hardest part is wakin' up one day yeah
