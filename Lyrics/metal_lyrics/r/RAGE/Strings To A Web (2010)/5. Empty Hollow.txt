And no more tears I cannot cry no more
No fears I just don't care for this life
Oh dark and grey that's how it seems to me
And more what can it mean to me
Oh why tell me why I am I'm passin' by
And my life yeah my life goes on
It goes on without without you and me
I don't live here I'm just like a stranger
And my mind is so full of hate and anger
I can tell you my life is just an empty hollow
I can't stay here I am slowly dyin'
And found nothin' that makes sense to try it
I can tell you my life is just an empty hollow
Aah time to go there's nothing holdin' me
I know that all what is can't go
Away from here it's just a constant flow
It's change so I can find my peace of
Mind it's alright alright and all this time
I've been starvin' starvin' to be
All so free inside for you and me
I don't live here I'm just like a stranger
And my mind is so full of hate and anger
I can tell you my life is just an empty hollow
I can't stay here I am slowly dyin'
And found nothin' that makes sense to try it
I can tell you my life is just
An empty hollow an empty hollow
