Tell the world we'll lose our future any time
This will be a rude awakening if we don't stop now
Everywhere we see the atomic threat will be
Handled by the bad the deceivers that gone mad
Lead us into death to hell and back
We're on the edge of darkness
Never return on the edge of darkness
When the nuclear dictators ride the bomb
Hell is here to stay forever do you want it so
Instability killin' the economy
Continents in war throwin' horror on the poor
Mother nature dies to hell and back
We're on the edge of darkness never return
On the edge of darkness
On the edge of darkness when will we learn
On the edge of darkness
Pull your head out of the sand you need to know
Your ass it will burn red hot right when it all explodes
Everywhere it seems all those people lost their dreams
Everyone's insane all the warning was in vain
Blinded til we're dead to hell and back
We're on the edge of darkness never return
On the edge of darkness
On the edge of darkness when will we learn
On the edge of darkness
When will we learn will we ever learn
