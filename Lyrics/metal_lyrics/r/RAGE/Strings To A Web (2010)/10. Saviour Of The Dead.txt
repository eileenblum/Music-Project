Demons gather in my head take me away lead me astray
Make me suffer in my bed leave me no choice infernal voice
Drag me into black tell me God is dead
Take me away to the end of my life saviour of the dead
Take me away I am starving for light saviour of the dead
Now release me into death saviour of the dead
I have always praised my God
Followed the priest prayed for release
Now they cannot save my soul
I am to blame eternal shame
I am spittin' blood lay my curse on God
Wasted til I'm mad driven into death
Take me away to the end of my life saviour of the dead
Take me away I am starving for light saviour of the dead
Now release me into death saviour of the dead
I am spittin' blood lay my curse on God
Wasted til I'm mad driven into death
Take me away to the end of my life saviour of the dead
Take me away I am starving for light saviour of the dead
Take me away to the end of my life saviour of the dead
Take me away I am starving for light saviour of the dead
Now release me into death saviour of the dead
Saviour of the dead
