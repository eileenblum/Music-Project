When my time to die has come I want no regrets
So I better use the days I have
Then I take a look around there is so much pain
People run in circles and create their prison
Day will turn to night the devil by your side
Steals the dreams away leave me be
'cause I I step into the light
And forever it will be alright
And I I step into the light
Death and life are walkin' side by side yeah eah
Everyone is overwhelmed by their fear for life
Stuck inside a rat race of desires
Lookin' for security that they'll never find
The only certain thing in life is death my dear
Day will turn to night the devil by your side
Steals the dreams away leave me be
'cause I I step into the light
And forever it will be alright
And I I step into the light
Death and life are walkin' side by side
Day will turn to night the devil by your side
Steals the dreams away leave me be
'cause I I step into the light
And forever it will be alright
And I I step into the light
Death and life are walkin' side by side
Because I I step into the light
And forever it will be alright
