Aa all that overwhealmin' beauty knocks me out and takes my breath
In her eyes reflects the new day breaks my walls of bitterness
When I'm near I fear no evil tearing me apart
She's eternal indestructible poundin' in my heart hellgirl
In the lakes of her blue eyes she's bearin' secrets from the night
Like an angel born from darkness she turns everything to light
Finally she found her way a new life to begin
Never guilty not to blame she's rising out of sin
Hellgirl's exploding in my life a superheroine overnight
She's all for me so be my girl forever
Hellgirl is coming down from space to fill my empty life with grace
She's all of me that hellgirl is forever ooh
Like a star she lights my skies and I will care forevermore
As my fear for her won't die I hope she stays fine in her core
Through her eyes I find perception and I understand
I am blessed she's no deception never leave my friend
Hellgirl's exploding in my life a superheroine overnight
She's all for me so be my girl forever
Hellgirl is coming down from space to fill my empty life with grace
She's all of me that hellgirl is forever she's all of me
That hellgirl is forever ooh hellgirl oh baby hellgirl
