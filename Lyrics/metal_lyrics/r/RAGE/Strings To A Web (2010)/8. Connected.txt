Open these soul cages fill my blank pages
Open these soul cages fill my blank pages
So love becomes my saviour
It's creepin' underneath my skin gets me connected
Open these soul cages fill my blank pages
Like notes can turn to music
We spin a web that makes us more
More than we are just let it happen
Open these soul cages fill my blank pages
I try to reach my hand out
And wonder what may come to me I let it happen
Open these soul cages fill my blank pages
Like raindrops in a river we can be part of bigger things
And if we dare we get connected
Open these soul cages fill my blank pages
