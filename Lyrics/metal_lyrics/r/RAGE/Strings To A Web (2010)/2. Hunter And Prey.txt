Hunt you down hunt you down ooh
Ooh I am justified by higher laws
My society gives me right to force
If you put shame on a family for the honour
Your blood sets me free set me free
Try to hide make my day
I'm the hunter and you are my prey
Time to die kneel and pray
I'm the hunter and you'll die today die
Since the stoneage we have lived this way
We ignore what you achieved today
These traditions we will never clear
Men can rule while women live in fear live in fear
Try to hide make my day
I'm the hunter and you are my prey
Man and wife for all your life
I'm the hunter and you are my prey
I'm the hunter and you are my prey
No one else shall see your face now no more
Hunt you down hunt you down
Try to hide make my day
I'm the hunter and you are my prey
Man and wife for all your life
I'm the hunter and you are my prey
Try to hide make my day
I'm the hunter and you are my prey
I'm the hunter and you are my prey uh
Ooh hooh hooh hooh huh huh huh huh huh huh
