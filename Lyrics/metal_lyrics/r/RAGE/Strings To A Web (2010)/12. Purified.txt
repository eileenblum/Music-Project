You are rotten to the core you're an addict that's for sure
All the time there is a choice but you ignore the inner voice
Fight your baser instincts now you should fall on your knees
And pray that there's a second chance
Jump jump jump in the fire burn til you're purified
Down down down to the wires burn my friend burn my friend uh huh
You are such an ignorant self complacent permanent
You will waste all that you had it seems you spoil all that you get
Try to find a hold in life you should fall on your knees
And pray that you can turn around
Jump jump jump in the fire burn til you're purified
Burn burn down to the wires burn my friend til you're purified
You are rotten to the core you're an addict that's for sure
You will waste all that you had it seems you'll spoil all that you get
Try to find a hold in life you should fall on your knees
And pray that you can turn around
Jump jump jump in the fire burn til you're purified
Down down down to the wires burn my friend
And burn my friend huh huh huh huh til you're purified
