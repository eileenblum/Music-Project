We all live with that clichÃ© the underdog the poor
From the void makes it big time a miracle in store
The workin' class true believers of this fairytale
Suffering hard every day to buy their stocks an' rates
Follow them you fools while they're fucing in their pools
Weep and eat their lies follow them you fools
While they're makin' all your rules let them steal your dimes
Forever and ever the rich is gettin' fat
By stealin' the beggar's last dime
Whatever no matter this greed ain't gettin' better
Stealin' the beggar's last dime
The upper class with their millions keepin' all doors locked
And you're not not invited when they live on top
In this game it's decided who will win or lose
When the rich cashes in the poor man sells his shoes
In the yellow press where you follow their excess
Wish to be like them while you dream you've won
They are playin' with your doe oops and now it's gone
Forever and ever the rich is gettin' fat
By stealin' the beggar's last dime
Whatever no matter this greed ain't gettin' better
Stealin' the beggar's last dime
Stealin' the beggar's last dime
Forever and ever the rich is gettin' fat
Whatever no matter the poor is gettin' mad hoo
Forever and ever the rich is gettin' fat
By stealin' the beggar's last dime
Whatever no matter this greed ain't gettin' better
Stealin' the beggar's last dime
Stealin' the beggar's last dime
