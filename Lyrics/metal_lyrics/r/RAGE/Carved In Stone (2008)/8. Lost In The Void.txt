War and murder, starving homeless people
Greed and hate, just take a look around
Dying land, a circle of destruction
Everybody steals from everyone

I am not a fool, what I say is the truth for all
Play against the rule and try to find a way

I don't want to be here
Lost in the void
Condemned and destroyed
I'm lost in the void
I don't want to be here
Lost in the void
Mislead and annoyed
I'm lost in the void
I don't want to be like this

In this world there is a lot confusion
Everybody has a different view
But there is a life beyond illusions
Can you take responsibility

I am not a fool, I know how I can turn around

Play against the rule and try to find a way

I don't want to be here
Lost in the void
Condemned and destroyed
I'm lost in the void
I don't want to be here
Lost in the void
Mislead and annoyed
I'm lost in the void
I don't want to be like this
