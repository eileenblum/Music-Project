Sometimes I'm pretending about being something else
'Cause I cannot stand it anymore
Misanthropy might not work but I can't help myself
Human kind is rotten to the core

Evolution's dead, go back to hell
Demolition man, we're all to blame

Root it out â drop dead
This could be a better world
Go away â drop dead
Root it out â drop dead
May return a better man
Go away â drop dead

Have you ever thought of how good nature runs itself
This world doesn't need one of our rules
Everyone just swallows till a perfect thing is dead
The most stupid's king of all the fools

Evolution's dead, go back to hell
Demolition man, we're all to blame

Root it out â drop dead
This could be a better world
Go away â drop dead
Root it out â drop dead
May return a better man
Go away â drop dead
