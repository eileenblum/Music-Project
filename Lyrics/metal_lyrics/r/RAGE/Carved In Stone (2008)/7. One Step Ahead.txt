I know, some will hate my guts
'Cause I'm telling the truth
They'll deny me 'cause I am exposing their rules, nothing but fools

Scared of possibilities
That life laid down to their knees
Uncontrolled, unguaranteed

Change is now and it is clear
Nature works this way, my dear
Just the moment is for real

Heads up, you fools! Someone controls your head, man
Heads up, you fools! Someone's controlling you

Can you feel it in the air
Life's eternal, everywhere
Free yourself and be one step ahead
I'm confessing to no one
To no father and no son
Free inside we'll be one step ahead

There are those who live in fear
Don't know what else to do
They're unable to believe, going nowhere, never they dare

All these people have their gods
Their religion tells them what
They are not allowed to do

Heads up, you fools! Someone controls your head, man
Heads up, you fools! Someone's controlling you

Can you feel it in the air
Life's eternal, everywhere
Free yourself and be one step ahead
I'm confessing to no one
To no father and no son
Free inside we'll be one step ahead
