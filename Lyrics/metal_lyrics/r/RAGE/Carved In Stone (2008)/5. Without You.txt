Days passing by while you're wasting your time
You're living your life without you
What you protect is what you reject
You're living your life without you

I can see you, I can feel you
But what I learn to know makes me sad

You're so far away, you are lead astray
All that fear made you hard, made you mad

Days passing by,while you're wasting your time
You're living your life without you
What you protect is what you reject
You're living your life without you

I could heal you, I could lead you
From your world that's in darkness and pain

Can you see me, can you hear me
I'm your self that you never have known

Days passing by while you're wasting your time
You're living your life without you
What you protect is what you reject
You're living your life without you

You're living your life without youâ¦
