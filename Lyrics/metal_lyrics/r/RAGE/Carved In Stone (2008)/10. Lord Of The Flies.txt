This world's following to the dark lord of the flies

So lost, set in this world, this island here in space
We've found a way to bring it down
It took us ages to become what we are now
But progress seems to turn around

This world's following to the dark lord of the flies

We're lost, morality's a long forgotten term
Just ego shooters run this place
Where is the glue to hold together what we had
Society does miss a lace

Here comes the lord of flies
That lead the world astray
No more the sun will shine
However you may pray

Here comes the lord of flies
Takes innocence away
We won't find back for sure (no more)
We're going down this way

[Narration:]
The lord of flies speaks in the hearts of those
Who lost all their love and compassion
Shameless in unending greed they rape the land
And steal from the world 'till our last sigh is made

This world's following to the dark lord of the flies

Here comes the lord of flies
That lead the world astray
No more the sun will shine
However you may pray

Here comes the lord of flies
Takes innocence away
We won't find back for sure (no more)
We're going down this way

No more, we wouldn't learn, like actors on a stage
The final curtain's 'bout to fall
Yes, evil's in ourself, our choice is always wrong
'Cause we forgot where we came from
