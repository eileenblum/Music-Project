Hey you, you wanna know what time it is
You could say it's too late for you, that's how it is

It's the time of the superhuman intellectual
And we learn how to switch our hearts off
Get it while we can

Into the mouth of greed
A demon hard to feed
No way to turn away
You're in the mouth of greed

Into the mouth of greed
Just satisfy your needs
Too hard to turn away
You're in the mouth of greed

We know that all we have is more we need
We think success is when we can compete

And we vote for our leaders and we let them rape our land
In the name of our stupid life style
Get it while we can

Into the mouth of greed
A demon hard to feed
No way to turn away
You're in the mouth of greed

Into the mouth of greed
Just satisfy your needs
Too hard to turn away
You're in the mouth of greed

It's the time when the supermodel meets her superman
They will learn how to switch their hearts off
Get it while they can

Into the mouth of greed
A demon hard to feed
No way to turn away
You're in the mouth of greed

Into the mouth of greed
Just satisfy your needs
Too hard to turn away
You're in the mouth of greed
