Dirty is the road to fame
Plastered with unlucky victims
Deadly if you get the blame focused on you
You can play your games with fear
Manipulate all around you
You want all, that's why you're here, so come what may

Win or lose, get rid of those who're in your way
(Make a stone out of your heart)
Win or lose, so stab the knife and fake a smile
(while you sell wrong for right)

Put a foot into that door
Get in charge, start pulling the strings
Show no mercy to the poor that crawl for you
In position you're immune
No one stops you, theres no frontier
Now you're licenced for the kill, smile anyway

Win or lose, get rid of those who're in your way
(Make a stone out of your heart)
Win or lose, so stab the knife and fake a smile
(while you sell wrong for right)

Gentle murders mark your way
Awful and unpunished
Gentle murderers get away
You'd be caught and locked away if you weren't elected
Gentle murders get away
