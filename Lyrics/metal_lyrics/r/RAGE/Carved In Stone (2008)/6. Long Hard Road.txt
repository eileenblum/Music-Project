You better pack your things to go
'Cause when it's time you never know
You better be aware that nothing's gonna last for long
So long

Nobody else can help you out, it's up to you
It won't be easy, don't allow the swamp to swallow you
What once was right can soon be wrong, you got to know
Don't stick too long to yesterday, you can't stay

Where do we go from here
Where do we go
What do we know right here
This is a long hard road

Another day to start and try
Another night to end and die
So many hours in between that come and go, stand by
Goodbye

There is a bridge across the abyss of your fear
A hand that leads you through the dark when it comes over you
Your love inside, the inner flame, that's why you're here
The only thing that will remain forever

Where do we go from here
Where do we go
We gotta go right here
This is a long hard road
