No, this door is not allowed, the pharaoh
Lies beneath these stonewalls
You, get off my pyramid, you gotta go
Don't, don't you disturb me

I used to rule all the land, I was god on earth
Never I'll match in your plan
Go, or you'll be cursed

Death, you'll meet infernal death for a sacrilege
Hey, now let me warn you

Cursed you'll be for all your days
If you open up my grave
Let me sleep beyond decay
Never open up my grave

Wrath will follow you through time, no way to hide
Die by strange diseases
If you step into my world you'll lose your life
Like all other thieves

You're in my pallace of death, from the other side
How can you mess with the dead, this is suicide

Here it's not for mortal men, you gotta know
When it's time to turn back

Cursed you'll be for all your days
If you open up my grave
Let me sleep beyond decay
Never open up my grave

I was once like you before
Never showed respect for no one around
But those days would end and it was too late to learn

Cursed you'll be for all your days
If you open up my grave
Let me sleep beyond decay
Never open up my grave
