If you don't know me: I came from beyond
My name doesn't matter, 'cause that's not the point
This has no meaning where I'll take you now
Open your mind, then we're ready to go
What I will show you is all that you need
That no living man on this earth ever has seen
An answer to all of the questions you had
The only solution you'll never regret...

Hey, this can't be real
This unbelieveable longing I feel
Still it's pushing me on
Pushing me out of my body

The sleep-destination unseen
The sleep-death is not what it seems to be

This is the real world, now you're on my side
The doors of eternity are opened wide
What you see now is what comes after death
If you have wishes, the answer is yes
Without a body we're all energy
And we drown into all things here to be
All of the places you wanted to see
All of your visions - you are into it

Hey, this is so real
Please let me stay here, I love what I feel
But I know I'm not dead
I have to get back to my body
(It's pushing me back to my body)

The sleep-destination unseen
The sleep-death is not what it seems to be
