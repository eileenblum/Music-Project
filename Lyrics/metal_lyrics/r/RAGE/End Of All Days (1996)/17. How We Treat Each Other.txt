[Bonus track]

The fire's burning bloody red
The tide is turning but we don't regret
The devil's demons 're coming in our lifes
All evil dreams, we make 'em here alive

Look into our torture chambers, your life isn't worth a dime
Hating, raping, killing day by day

That's how, how we teat each other
We never learn from history, this world's a big absurdity
That's how, how we treat each other
We seem too blind to see it's us who's wasted in our hands at last...

Dropped bombs are falling, falling to the ground
The politicians, they won't hear a sound

Look into the cities jungle, your life isn't worth a dime
Hating, raping, killing day by day

That's how, how we teat each other
We never learn from history, this world's a big absurdity
That's how, how we treat each other
We seem too blind to see it's us who's wasted in our hands at last...

The kid is killing, doesn't know 'bout life
That he's destroying, too fragile to survive

That's how, how we teat each other
We never learn from history, this world's a big absurdity
That's how, how we treat each other
Humanity is just a word, it echoes on, remains unheard
