I have tried to stay polite and calm
But she never tried to ease
Words won't help me with this drama queen
I don't think she wants some peace 

I won't be second to none
I won't be sorry you're gone
'Cause everything is just wrong

Oh, doctor, doctor, please
It's spreading like disease
Free me from this psycho terror
I'll get me out of this
'Cause you are like disease
I don't need this psycho terror

Why the hell she wants to put me down
Lies and gossip from her mouth
Makes a fool of me while I'm around
Takes my money, gives no thanx

And everywhere it's the same
These girls play such f...g games
I just don't know who's to blame
