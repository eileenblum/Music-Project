Hear the story of a loser
An addicted man
He has spent his whole life gambling
A game called twenty one (ruined by twenty one) 

Now I'm gonna win for sure
Hit me with an eight
All I have I'm bringing in
Everything that's mine

High on emotion

What the world would say
If he'd be number one

And one day he'd win in shining glory
He would be the lucky one
But for real it was a different story
Never he had twenty one

Now a three is tumbling in
Not enough for me
Six is up, the dealer smiles
No, this cannot be

Back in the gutter
There is nothing left and
Once again he's falling from the highest cloud

And one day he'd win in shining glory
He would be the lucky one
But for real it was a different story
Never he had twenty one

Hear the story of a loser
An addicted man
He has spent his whole life gambling
A game called twenty one (ruined by twenty one)
