Hey man, I've heared what happened in the news
You fool, this really was the worst to choose
Now it's too late to find a better way
Solutions are around but you won't see 

You've thrown your life away

This time you know it is eternally too late
You cannot change what is eternally too late

Cool down, you better let your heart decide
Calm down, no reason to make wrong to right
Too bad, what have you done, it's such a shame
Think twice before you act, it's all your blame

You've thrown your life away

This time you know it is eternally too late
You cannot change what is eternally too late
Suffer eternally

You've thrown your life away

This time you know it is eternally too late
You cannot change what is eternally too late
