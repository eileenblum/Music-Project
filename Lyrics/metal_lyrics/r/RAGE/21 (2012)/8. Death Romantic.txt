Hey you, do you feel so lonely and desperate, girl 
I knew it, you've posted your feelings on facebook, yeah
Your friends, they are just the same, they don't have a life
Like you, on deathwish.com they dream of suicide 

And I, I offer you eternal peace
Yes and I, I creep in your brain like disease

Meet me, I'm death romantic
Kiss me, I'm death romantic
Give me your hand and we will sleep forever

Come on, we'll meet in the forest, so far from home
No fear, it is just so easy, you're not alone

Believe, I'll ease all the pain in your mind
Yes it is, naivity will make you blind

Meet me, I'm death romantic
Kiss me, I'm death romantic
Give me your hand and there'll be no tomorrow
