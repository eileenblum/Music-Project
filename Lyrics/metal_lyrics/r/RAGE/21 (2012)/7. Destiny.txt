Some people live their lifes like
They'd be immortal forever
Some people waste their cards like
They'd have a second deck at hand 

But while they start their hassle
And put their energy
In senseless things the clock ticks on

Time flies, 'till you waste away, now
This will be your destiny
The soul cries, when you fade away, now
This will be your destiny

You better find your meaning
And use your days before you die

Why is it that you're running
Just like the hamster in his wheel
You spend your days with things that
You don't like, this is what I see

And all that wasted moments
Fill you with pain and hate
So turn around, it's not too late

Time flies, 'till you waste away, now
This will be your destiny
The soul cries, when you fade away, now
This will be your destiny

You better find your meaning
And use your days before you die
