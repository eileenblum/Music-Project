Now you will suffer, for
My unaccomplished hate
Is coming over you
It is far too late
I am just bursting out
I wouldn't care to kill
Empathy I just don't know
Just frustrated will 

You feel sorry now, that wouldn't help, no
You have put me on a wrong track long ago

Feel my pain
I've been never loved and honoured
Feel my pain, no respect
Feel my pain
Never you have cared for myself
Feel my pain, feel my pain

Whenever I wanted my way
You always said no
Whenever I tried to please you
No, it wasn't good
I only want that you take me
For that what I am
Why can't you accept that I want 
My life, as I should

You feel sorry now, that wouldn't help, no
You have put me on a wrong track long ago

Feel my pain
I've been never loved and honoured
Feel my pain, no respect
Feel my pain
Never you have cared for myself
Feel my pain, feel my pain
