In my life I've seen a lot of things to be
Know 'bout shadows and 'bout light to shine for everyone
We're all  different and we all have a fate
There is no need to fight with others that can't make it right 

But I found a strengths that is better than a thousand words
I'm power supplied from within, yeah

Don't try to hit me, I'm a concrete wall 
You try to bite but I will make you fall 
You'll spit your teeth cause I'm a concrete wall

There are always some that ignore the facts
They are lost in fear and envy you forevermore
It's their arrogance walking hand in hand
With their ignorance, they cannot find a higher sense

But I found a strengths that is better than a thousand words
I'm power supplied from within, yeah

Don't try to hit me, I'm a concrete wall 
You try to bite but I will make you fall 
You'll spit your teeth cause I'm a concrete wall

It is hard to find confidence in mind
You will make your way all through the night and find the light
Don't you lose your path, don't compare yourself
'Cause some other's shoes ain't right you cannot step outside

But I found a strengths that is better than a thousand words
I'm power supplied from within, yeah

Don't try to hit me, I'm a concrete wall 
You try to bite but I will make you fall 
You'll spit your teeth cause I'm a concrete wall
