Life was coming out of water
Reached for land and spread itself around
Verified a million species, so
Our kind found fruitful ground
Thatâs what we found 

Now we ruined all the places
Switched the colours in to grey

See the world turn black and white
Darkness swallows all the light
Wine turns into water and
Our world turns black and white

And then man would start invading
A disease that he called cultured life
Tamed the creatures made all even, put
His force on all alive
Wanted dead or alive

Now we ruined all the places
Switched the colours into grey

See the world turn black and white
And when darkness eats the light
All the colours fade away
The world turns black and white

See the world turn black and white
And the day will turn to night
We have played god and we've lost
Our world turns black and white
