Dead forever
Hate inside my heart, tearing me apart 

Somebody's gonna bleed, I guess it's only me
Somebody's got the pain but tears are all in vain
You don't know what I need and what you never see
The only thing remains is

Hate inside my heart, tearing me apart

I guess you never realised what you have made
So much was broken and the scars still bleed at night
You are dead, you are dead, I'm not sorry you are dead
When you had locked me in the dark I swore to me
You won't control my spirit, one day I'd be free
You are dead, you are dead, I'm not sorry you are dead

You're forever dead
You're forever, dad
But I cannot let you go
You're forever dead
Forgive but never forget, there's no way

Somebody's gonna cry, you wouldn't give a damn
Somebody's gonna die , that was only you
Your life was just a lie, I know the reason why
You couldn't really love, put

Hate inside my heart, tearing me apart

How can you treat that little boy the way you've done
You tried to break me but you never got me down. You are dead
You tried to take control on everything 'bout me
Were you too insecure to let me disagree? You are dead
