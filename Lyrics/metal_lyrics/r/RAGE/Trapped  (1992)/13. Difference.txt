[Music &amp; Lyrics: P. Wagner]

Hey, are you someone who can't help his pain?
Do you feel sad, feel like all was in vain?
Are you controlled by a depressive mind?
Are you the slave of your thoughts, all the time?

Come, let me show you
How they control you
See the difference!

You'll notice the difference
You'll soon make a difference

It's time to learn that it's all in your hand
You're not a victim, you must understand
Better erase what's not worth to be thought
Throw all this ballast you've kept overboard

Come, let me show you
How it controls you
Tell the difference!

You'll notice the difference
You'll soon make a difference
