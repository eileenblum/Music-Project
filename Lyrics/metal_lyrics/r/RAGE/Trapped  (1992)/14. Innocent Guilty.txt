[Bonus track]

Innocent guilty, she did not reply when he called
He didn't know she was innocent guilty
But it'd come to that

Twenty times that day
He tried to call her on the phone
But he did not succeed
And noone answered the door but then he heard her dog
So she must have been at home and he called her name
But it was in vain

Innocent guilty, she did not reply when he called
He didn't knew she was innocent guilty
But it'd come to that

He found the back door open
So he stole into the house
Where he found the body of her father
In the kitchen, blood was all around
On the table a letter that she wrote

Please forgive me
I have killed this man
'Cause he raped me
I can't stand the pain, the shame, my love, this last goodbye...
And he ran up the stairs to her room where she had opened her veins...

Innocent guilty, she did not reply when he called
He didn't knew she was innocent guilty
But as it seemed she was dead

Thanks to tommynokers for sending track #14 lyrics.
