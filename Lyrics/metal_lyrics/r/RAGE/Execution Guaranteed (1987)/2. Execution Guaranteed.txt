There in the subway station, they shot him dead
He had broken the secrecy - Omerta
That's what they all will get,
They've got a job to do
The business is too important to take a risk and so
Please don't get me wrong, if you'd ever say a word
You'll have missed my friend, this is what you'll get

Execution guaranteed

We are an old family, controlling the trade
Gun running for the white house. The CIA works
hand in hand with us. We must feed the flame of
hate and war in the third world, cause if they
kill themselves We deliver all they need for the
fall (it's big money) The all order and this is
what they get

Execution guaranteed

We choose, you loose
You - jeah, I've got a mission for you
Look - here, a list of men to execute
Shoot - you must shoot them, no one will find out
Truth - truth is a daughter of time

Execution guaranteed
