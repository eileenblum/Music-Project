A shadow
One whisper
Nothing to see
There is a pair of glowing eyes, a gruesome call
Streetwolf
Motionless
Just one breath
He demands tribute
An abased one
In restless pain
The grief feels like they'd cut a piece out of his heart
Streetwolf
Whoo - Streetwolf's got you
Whoo - Streetwolf's got you
Look in the mirror, a river of blood - your race is almost run
He's in your back, even there on each side, in front another one
He grabs you at your throat, his jaws will cut you into bits
It's just what he always did, the thunder made his hits
Howling and hunting, a raging revenge - substitutes can't satisfy
The loss of what's too precious to forget has blured his eye
Soon the day will come when they will stand up like a storm
The pain will be too mush to bear, their hearts, they must be torn
Whoo - Streetwolf's got you
Whoo - Streetwolf's got you
