No one knows the natural powers
They're astonished, they're afraid
Pushing forwards technology
They forgot just who they are
Once contented with fulfillment
Now they cannot get enough
The time has come to harvest what they're sown
There's no way forward, progress cannot grow
And they will see that they have failed

Deadly error

They fight against their own achievements
They fear what they once created
Suffocate in poisoned breezes
Once they conquered, now they're slaves
They are running from their own hell
They are running, cause they know
The time has come to harvest what they've sown
There's no way forward, progress cannot grow
And they will se that they have failed

Deadly error

The smell of danger is in the air
A few make the race but we all must pay the fare
We're to sit on a powder barrel
Waiting for the deadly blow
No one asked the silent masses
And I bet they don't know
Don't tell me this stock of arms ain't
There to be used in the end
The time has come to harvest what they've sown
There's no way forward, progress cannot grow
And they will se that they have failed
The time has passed them by, we must all pay
Just one step back could save for us the day
Why can't they see that they have failed

Deadly error
