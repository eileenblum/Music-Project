[Bonus track]

Watch out, they're on the loose
They creep into your privacy, lurk in all corners for you

Justice - that's what they scream
But can they find verdicts on me while they're corrupt like...
Shit, I don't know who or what

They say that they're friends and they fight for your rights
They say that they're helpers
But they only teach you to stand real tight

Out there in the streets: Law and order
In out battlefields: Law and order

No way, you can't escape
You can't make mistakes or have fun or just do what you feel

They'll keep you locked in, you might be a troublemaker
Keep him safe
You bastard, you'd better be dead or something like this...
Now he's safe
