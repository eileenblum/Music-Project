[Music by: P. Wagner]
[Lyrics by: P. Wagner]

You're talkin' 'bout your profits
the one percent to grow
to show the world we're "someone"
as if they do not know

And all that you have gathered what does it mean for you?
A shit, 'cause you destroy it
your policy's not true

for the lost side of the world

Especially the countries that've got only sand and stones
they got the most to feed
but that's not possible at all

on the lost side of the world

When night is gone
a thousand of the poor have died.
Goodbye to the world.
We cannot help them all,
but must we have a pope who damns the pill
for the lost side of the world

We're much too many people
it's becoming more each day
We got to change our habits
Cause the world's collapse won't wait

When night is gone
a thousand of the poor had died.
Goodbye...
