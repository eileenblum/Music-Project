[Bonus track]

Hey you, take a look at me now
Have you ever seen the face of death
Have you noticed me somehow
Not more than rotton flesh and bones...
But there's more than molecules
That make you different from a stone

Mirror, mirror, mirror
Friendly smiles decay
Mirror, mirror, mirror
It's your final day

Hey you, your spirit is more
It turns you into a scientist, an inventor to explore
But look into the mirror of life
You made so many mistakes
Now you get back what you gave

Mirror, mirror, mirror
Friendly smiles decay
Mirror, mirror, mirror
It's your final day

Your face is cold tonight
Your glance is far out of sign
You lay your body for the final rest
Do you think it was good what you've done in the past
You've had your years on earth
Now go back to what you've been...
