[Lyrics by: P. Wagner]

He's a neurotic!

"I cannot stand it anymore!
You slut!  You goddamn filthy whore!"
(This is not a gentleman's style)
He's screaming with a deep-red face
(Oh, you seem a bit angry, don't ya)
This is a choleric attack, he's got it sometimes
(mmmh, my god!)

He's a neurotic, gonna break his neck
I don't wanna get like this

Don't worry about this guy
It's up to you to show him better ways
Don't get to angry if he failed again
His moods hard to control

And when he steps out of the door
The kids, they laugh at him once more
(Motherfucker, motherfucker, bababa!)
If he didn't cry or wish he was dead
(Nobody loves me!)
He would scream out in boiling RAGE
(Fuck you assholes!)

He's a neurotic, gonna break his neck
I don't wanna get like this

Don't worry ï¿½bout this guy
It's up to you to show him better was
Don't get too angry if he failed again
His moods hard to control

He's a neurotic, gonna break his neck
I don't wanna get like this
