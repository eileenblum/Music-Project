[Music &amp; Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

Once, eons back in time from here
Long before man was born
They came from somewhere out of space
Shaped the young planet's face

And more, they made all to be, everything we see is their work
So good, the system and it?s frame played a perfect game
Until the other came...

It was all for the great old ones
Those who created life
And life carried on and on and on
They gave all for the great old ones
Under the new born sun
Where life carried on and on and on...

So everything was good to be
When some would fall from grace
Birth of the evil energy
Fear reaches back in those days

And hell wasted all to be, all the bad we see is it's work
To save the system and it's frame, the Soundchaser came
Some call them Perfect man...

It was all for the great old ones
Those who created life
And life carried on and on and on
They gave all for the great old ones
Under the new born sun
Where life carried on and on and on...

Life carried on for the great old ones

In the planets history there are secrets, you will see
Our nature has a source. Good or evil comes from those...
And all, all their secret deeds never could complete what they need

Cause hell wasted all to be, all the bad we see; 'till the Soundchaser came...

It was all for the great old ones
Those who created life
And life carried on and on and on
They gave all for the great old ones
Under the new born sun
Where life carried on and on and on...

Life carried on for the great old ones
