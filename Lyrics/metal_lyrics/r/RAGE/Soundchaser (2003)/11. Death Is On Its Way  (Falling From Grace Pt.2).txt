[Music &amp; Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

Oh, Angel, come and talk to me
Oh, Angel, have mercy with me
Maybe this is the time for wonders
Maybe it's the time to set me free

When death is on it's way
When death is on it's way

Oh, father, tell me what shall be
Oh, father, what am I to see
Is it now that I have to let go
Is it now the time to set me free

When death is on it's way
When death is on it's way

Oh, mother, I don't want to sigh
Oh, mother, I don't want to die
Tell me why does it have to be so
Hard to let go when it?s your final day

When death is on it's way
When death is on it's way

We talk about so many things, in fact we tell us nothing
We hear about so many stuff that's wasted in our ears
Our days are filled with everything that never brings us futher
But when it comes to say goodbye we're helpless, drowning in tears

If we don't remember this in our lifes we'll forget the day
Then we're not prepared to find the truth that helps us face the final day

When death is on it's way
When death is on it's way

Our time is sometimes not so long, our days, they maybe counted
We often build our castles on the sand of make believe
I've seen it when I sat beside your bed and held your hand, that
Trembled of the pain when you fought your very last fight

If I don't remember this I don't remember anything
Something's there that gave the strengths that's stronger than the threshold of our pain

When death is on it's way
When death is on it's way

Once at the gates of eternity it might be better if the heart is free
I reach out my hands to reality of life and it's far beyond all images

Death is on it's way, death is on it's way
