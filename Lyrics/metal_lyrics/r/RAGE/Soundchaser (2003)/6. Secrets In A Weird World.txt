[Music: Victor Smolski]
[Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

Get deeper underground
The lost is found
Remains are all around, take care
To catch a breath of age
Not from this world
A dinosaur of rage's construction

Take a chance, only you can
Take a chance, make it alive

You're holding in your hands
A construction plan
So do now what you can, take care
To give a breath of life
A human touch
A prehistoric clone, Frankenstein

Take a chance, only you can
Take a chance, make it alive

Secrets in a weird world
Under the arctic shelf
Life, lost in the ice
Back in the new world
Secrets in a weird world
Timeless and undistorted
Life, lost in the ice
Back in the new world
