[Music: Victor Smolski]
[Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

You turned away from me to be with someone else
You turned away but from inside you are here
Still you didn't give me what I need the most
I am half, it feels not right and I fear

Coming back, you started building up myself
Face to face, man and machine come alive
But mortality will be the price to pay
It's a circle with an end to arrive

Can't you see that I'm dead from inside
Won't you help me be alive

You, give me flesh and blood
I wanna know the feeling in my veins
You, give me flesh and blood
I wanna know the feel of flesh and blood

Can't you see I'm burning from inside
I just need to be alive

You, give me flesh and blood
I wanna know the feeling in my veins
You, give me flesh and blood
I wanna know the feel of flesh and blood

You turned away from me to be with someone else
You turned away but from inside you are here
Now you gave me what I need to be alive
On my mission in the night you are here
You are here
