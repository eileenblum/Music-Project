[Music: Victor Smolski]
[Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

This is the time, this is the place for me
They brought me back to life again
It was for seen a long, long time ago
I'm coming back, I shall return

Everything I've seen
All the places I have been
And the secrets of the earth
Have been given at my birth
I withstand all that's worse

I'm human metal, yes, I am real, I'm human metal
I'm human metal and I am made to give you back what you have lost
I'm human metal, yes, I am real, I'm human metal
I'm human metal
And I am made to give you back what you have lost so long ago

Organic life is pumping through my veins
A hard drive's working in my head
My ears are trained to catch the tiniest sound
I'm powered by the notes I get

Made of blood and steel
A machine but I can feel
Activated by the sound
Of the music that's around
A raging metal pound

I'm human metal, yes, I am real, I'm human metal
I'm human metal and I am made to give you back what you have lost
I'm human metal, yes, I am real, I'm human metal
I'm human metal
And I am made to give you back what you have lost so long ago
Made to save your life and make you grow
A majestic symphony is life, so give up misery
Now raise your head and listen what's to come...
