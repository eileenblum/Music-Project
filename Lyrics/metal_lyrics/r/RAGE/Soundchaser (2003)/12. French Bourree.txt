[Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

I wanna go, long time ago
It was the time when all the ladies used to show
They saved a dance for their heart's gentleman
They're waiting for the time and saved the day
For the french bourree

Give me a sign, a single sign
So I'll be waiting here until you will be mine
I wanna know, you let the other go
Then come along and dance with me today
To the french bourree

And if you let me in your heart
I will find a start
Take a chance on me, wait and you will see
You and me, it's gotta be
Let me win your heart with a bourree

I wanna go, long time ago
It was the time when all the ladies used to show
They saved a dance for their heart's gentleman
They're waiting for the time and saved the day
For the french bourree

And if you let me in your heart
I will find a start
Take a chance on me, wait and you will see
You and me, it's gotta be
Let me win your heart with a bourree
