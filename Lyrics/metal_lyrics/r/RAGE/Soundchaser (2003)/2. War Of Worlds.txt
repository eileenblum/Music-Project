[Music: Victor Smolski]
[Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

Hijackers, kidnapers, have a look around
Assassins with blessings from their gods
No mercy, they try to set this world on fire
They think that they have a right to kill

Take good care to be out of here
From the nuclear fire
Separation and growing fear
We forgot we're one, never spoke in one voice
Now we're here

It's the war of worlds
And we're all concerned, right now
Everyone has to learn
It's the war of worlds
And our future burns right now
(It's the war of worlds)

This is the war of the worlds right now

They swallow and follow just the path of greed
Blood dripping, heart ripping, take it all
Confusion, conclusions not in sight, so scary
Not willing to share what all is there

Take good care to be out of here
From the nuclear fire
Separation and growing fear
We forgot we're one, never spoke in one voice
Now we're here

It's the war of worlds
And we're all concerned, right now
Everyone has to learn
It's the war of worlds
And our future burns right now
(It's the war of worlds)

Burn in hell
