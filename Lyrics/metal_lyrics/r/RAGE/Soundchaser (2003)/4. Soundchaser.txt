[Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

"I have heared your voice
Now I have no choice
You must face your fatal end"

What is this? I can't believe my eyes
Is it trying to hunt, it's bringing me down, bringing me down
Why did I come to this hellish vault
I have heared, they warned
It's chasing, raging, killing you

Time stands still
And myself will
Disappear tonight from this world
Soundchaser
Now the beast has come
It's coming out to eat me alive

The Soundchaser
Is soundchasing, raging, killing you

"Eons back in time
This world has been mine
Deadly plage from heaven sent"
Hush, my dear, the silence saved my life
It won't find us if we hide on the ground, without a sound
Hell freeze over! Please, please save my life
Instinctive breed, it is chasing, raging, killing you

Time stands still
And myself will
Disappear tonight from this world
Soundchaser
Now the beast has come
It's coming out to eat me alive

The Soundchaser
Is soundchasing, raging, killing you

Soundchaser, Soundchaser, now the beast has come alive...
