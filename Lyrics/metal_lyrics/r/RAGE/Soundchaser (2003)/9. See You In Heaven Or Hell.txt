[Music &amp; Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

What we feel, it might be so unreal
And what we know, it's under construction
We have learned, the truth, it can be turned
Well, it just depends on what we believe is real

In secrecy our mission will be
Let's create our future aware

I'll see you in heaven one day
Or I'll see you in hell
Yeah, we'll be where we think we will stay
I'll see you in heaven or hell

You and me, we think of what will be
It's so hard to trust in that we'll be given
Fear, so strong, will surely lead us wrong
It's gonna bring us down, we better believe it's real

In secrecy our mission will be
Let's create our future aware

I'll see you in heaven one day
Or I'll see you in hell
Yeah, we'll be where we think we will stay
I'll see you in heaven or hell

No limit, I'm in it, it's all inside my mind
I'll be there where I dare, it's all my choice

In secrecy our mission will be
Let's create our future aware

I'll see you in heaven one day
Or I'll see you in hell
Yeah, we'll be where we think we will stay
I'll see you in heaven or hell
