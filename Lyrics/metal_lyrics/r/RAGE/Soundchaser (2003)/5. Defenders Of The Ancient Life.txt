[Music &amp; Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

Defenders of the ancient life we are
Defenders of the ancient world at war
And if we're gonna die, keep that spark
Defenders of the ancient life we are, yes we are

Hunters came the night before
They brought to our homes their war, bloody war
All the others, just like me
Have to face the enemy, it's gotta be

They have all been innocent of starting all this waste
But the demons ran a deadly race
We were made to force them down and end their killing aims
To save the creator's precious lifes

Defenders of the ancient life we are
Defenders of the ancient world at war
And if we're gonna die, keep that spark
Defenders of the ancient life we are, yes we are

Noone ever gave us names
We were forged in fire and flames, red hot flames
Crafted to protect the ones
Chasing every unknown sound that's around

We were made to force them down and end their deadly games
To save the creator?s precious lifes
They have all been innocent of starting all this waste
But the demons had their killing aims...

Defenders of the ancient life we are
Defenders of the ancient world at war
And if we're gonna die, keep that spark
Defenders of the ancient life we are, yes we are
