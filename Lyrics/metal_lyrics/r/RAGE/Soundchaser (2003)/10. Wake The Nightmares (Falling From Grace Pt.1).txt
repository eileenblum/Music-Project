[Music &amp; Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

The dust that settled in the eyes
Has covered a thousand lies
Like maggots ate the brain
And time is moving rapidly
For those who are to see
A paradigma changed

And the rain's falling like tears you've shed
(keep on falling)
While the spiders crawl out of your bed
(I see them crawling)
And the raven sings songs for the dead
(sing your songs for the dead)
Wake the nightmares in my head

Like me there were more that have tried
To set a few things right
To take the dreamers hand
Their world is falling from the stars
They start a thousand wars
It's coming to an end

And the rain's falling like tears you've shed
(keep on falling)
While the spiders crawl out of your bed
(I see them crawling)
And the raven sings songs for the dead
(sing your songs for the dead)
Wake the nightmares in my head

Never swallow what you've heared before
Don't believe in what you see
It won't stay like it appears no more
If you don't awake in time
You never will again

And the rain's falling like tears you've shed
(keep on falling)
While the spiders crawl out of your bed
(I see them crawling)
And the raven sings songs for the dead
(sing your songs for the dead)
Wake the nightmares in my head
