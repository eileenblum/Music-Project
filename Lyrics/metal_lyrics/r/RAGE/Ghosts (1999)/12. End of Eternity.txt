[bonus track]

There's a new kind of love, you're longing for
And I will be there, waiting at your door
This is all where you want to be, want to be
At the end of eternity

Now the time comes when all connects to one
And a bridge will be built from dark to sun
At the dawn of the century, come with me
It's the end of eternity

And there is so much more to give
And there is so much more to live
Come to me, come to me, set it free

The end of eternity
The end of eternity has begun, has begun

There's a new kind of life on second floor
And you will be there, knocking at my door
This is all where I want to be, want to be
At the end of eternity

And there is so much more to give
And there is so much more to live
Come to me, come to me, set it free

The end of eternity
The end of eternity has begun, has begun
