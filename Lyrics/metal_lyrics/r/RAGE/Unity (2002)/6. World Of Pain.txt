Oh, how good it was a long, long time ago
Life was young and everything was bound to grow
Yes, we've made it, we were fruitful and explored
But now it's overloaded
It might as well explode - anytime

Hear my warning
Death is dawning
This is a world of pain

No tomorrow
Only sorrow
Live in a world of pain

All this time the spiral's turning till we fall
Why, oh why we never tried to take control
Is it that we're egoistic 'till the end
It's "after me the flood"
We blame it all on god, but it's not...

Hear my warning
Death is dawning
This is a world of pain

No tomorrow
Only sorrow
Live in a world of pain

I don't wanna live
In a world of pain...
