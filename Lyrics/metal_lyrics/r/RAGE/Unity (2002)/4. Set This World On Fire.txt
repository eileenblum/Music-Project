I'm the king of the world
All money, all power, all godlike
And everything you rely on
Hey, you think you are safe this way
But now I'm going to change the rules
You gave it all in my hands
Your days, they will be counted soon
What goes around that will come around
You will have to take what's to come

Raise your head, it is time to burn
You'll set this world on fire
All you had's gone with no return
You'll set this world on fire

You - tell me what you've learned
You took all the gifts that I gave you
And turned them into a nightmare
Hey, you've had every chance there was
You fool, you always failed too soon
You should be one step ahead
I'm fear - and I still make the rules
What goes around that will come around
You will have to take what's to come

Raise your head, it is time to burn
You'll set this world on fire
All you had's gone with no return
You'll set this world on fire
Set this world on fire...
