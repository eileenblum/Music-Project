[Bonus track]
[Music &amp; Lyrics: Peavy Wagner]

Wake the morning, time to go
I think I have to leave
In my shady, grey and dusty dress
I'll never make my way

In my darkened hemisphere
The sun refuses to shine
In this chain of doubts and rainy clouds
Where nothing wants to stay

It's a shame, all in vain
It's a game to pretend
In the end it's gonna be okay

The mystery when darkness turns to light
The great release when wrong will turn to right
I want to see when darkness turns to light
When the waking winds will reach my mind
And blow the night away...

Try to keep my head up high
Appear like I'm unscarred
But the mirror tells the bitter truth
You've hit me unprepared

Is it gonna stay like this
Is this my only range
Don't you keep me down, I want to live
I wanna see a change

It's a shame, all in vain
It's a game to pretend
In the end it's gonna be okay

Peter "Peavy" Wagner - vocals, bass
