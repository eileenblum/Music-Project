I'm on the run, but I don't know
What is the scare, so there's no way to go
What do I fear to cross my way
It's gonna come like a kick in the a...

Father you've warned me, so I should have known
Something's not right
Set the alarm now, before it's too late
Make it allright

All I want is my own integrity
All I want is a chance of being free
It could be heaven on earth if we are one
All I want is to end what I've begun
That's all I want

It's getting hard to understand
What is the right thing and what's a dead end
Don't wanna live like in disgrace
'Cause in the end it's a kick in the face

You tread on me and you give me the blame
This is not right
Don't mean to harm you, so treat me the same
Then it's allright

All I want is my own integrity
All I want is a chance of being free
It could be heaven on earth if we are one
All I want is to end what I've begun
That's all I want
