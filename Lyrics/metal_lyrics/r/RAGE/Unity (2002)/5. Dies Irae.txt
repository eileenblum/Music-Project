Dies irae venit
Dies irae venit
Poena dei venit
Amen, amen
Poena dei venit

Time is late, heading into our fate
Nothing to change in the moment before our awakening
Hypnotised, nearly like paralysed
Just like the rabbit that stares in the eyes of the snake

No more tears will help the dying
No more sighing, nothing to wonder
Pride and anger wiped away
Kneel down, the end is near

Dies irae venit
Dies irae venit
Poena dei venit
Amen, amen
Poena dei venit

Darkened skies covering greed and lies
Restless the damned try to save their possessions with bleeding eyes
All in vain 'cause nothing will remain
Like we were told we'll end by extinction, you'll see

All the empires start to crumble
All will tumble, drown in the oceans
Pride and anger wiped away
Kneel down, the end is near

Dies irae venit
Dies irae venit
Poena dei venit
Amen, amen
Poena dei venit
