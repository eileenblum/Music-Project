Who do you think that you are
Don't tell me lies
You know exactly what you've done

You went beyond the limit
Don't close your eyes
The consequences might not be so nice

Life's a cycle, driving all the world
And I will be around

See you going down (down)
I am a real survivor
I'll see you going down
See your ass go down (down)
It's always best to laugh last
I'll see you going down
Well I see you going down

I've got my shit together
It's working well
Don't need permission for my deeds

And all these superheroes
Who know so well
You can go home and this will make my day

Life's a cycle, driving all the world
And I will be around

See you going down (down)
I am a real survivor
I'll see you going down
See your ass go down (down)
It's always best to laugh last (and I will dance on your grave )
And I will wave goodbye
When I see you going down...

All the evil that you're sending out
Is falling back on you

Life's a cycle, driving all the world
And I will be around

See you going down (down)
I am a real survivor
I'll see you going down
See your ass go down (down)
It's always best to laugh last (and I will dance on your grave )
And I will wave goodbye
When I see you going down...
