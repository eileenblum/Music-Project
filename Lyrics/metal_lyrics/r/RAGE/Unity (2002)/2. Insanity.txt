Another day in darkland
He killed his family
Just couldn't see a future
Like he was told to be

And as the great provider
Stopped his source to survive
He found he served the wrong gods
A credit or his life

And then we read the news from all around the world
'Bout all this tragedies we cannot understand
How can you say it's only letters that don't matter much
That you don't care 'bout all this misery in you and me

All this insanity surrounding me
All this insanity is killing me

Another night in dreamworld
She had it up to here
So went up to the rooftop
Got rid of all her fear

Well, as her head was shattered
She made peace with her age
There lying on the pavement
She finally left the stage

And on the television rules an abstract life
Where next to youth and beauty nothing can survive
How can you say it's just a point of view, it's up to you
While in the hidden grows this misery in you and me

All this insanity surrounding me
All this insanity is killing me
