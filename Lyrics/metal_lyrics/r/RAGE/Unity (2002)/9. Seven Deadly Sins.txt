They run the endless debate
Who's right and who is wrong
In their eyes we've all failed in life

Old men in silk and diamonds
Decide who's right to kill
A soldier with god; not so his wife

It's just another way to multiply their power
They need a reason to survive
Seven deadly sins
Just give them fear of hell, obey the ivory tower
If they all want to stay alive
Seven deadly sins - seven deadly sins

Who are they to speak justice
About another man
They've tortured and killed through history

How can you dogmatise it
You cannot shape the truth
There's no way to order belief

It's just another game to multiply their power
They need a reason to survive
Seven deadly sins
If we all fear their hell, obey their ivory tower
They have a chance to stay alive
Seven deadly sins - seven deadly sins
