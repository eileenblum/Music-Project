Now I sit and think
Another lousy drink
There has got to be a better way
They can't pull my chain
I'm the one to blame
It's for sure there always gonna pay

Finder's keepers, losers, weepers, haters, lovers ... a world away

I'm always alone in my dreamland
I'll show them I'm living my dream 'till the end
That's right

Can you feel my pain
Tears that fall like rain
Fall to dry but never leave a stain
People never learn
For every twist a turn
Twisting, burning bridges fall in vain

Finder's keepers, losers, weepers, haters, lovers ... a world away

I'm always alone in my dreamland
I'll show them I'm living my dream 'till the end
I'm always at home in my dreamland
I'll show that I'm living my dream 'till the end

Ideals and options, a cross for all to bear
Only to fall prey to blind eyes and closed ears
Without dreams we serve no purpose
Without dreams we walk among the dead

Finder's keepers, losers, weepers, haters, lovers ... a world away

I'm always alone in my dreamland
I'll show them I'm living my dream 'till the end
I'm always at home in my dreamland
I'll show that I'm living my dream 'till the end
