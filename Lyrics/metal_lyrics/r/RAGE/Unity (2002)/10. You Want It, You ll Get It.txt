Why is it that some people always get what they want
How come they always know the time to choose
And can you make a difference in how your life evolves
If you knew what it is then
You'd never be the one to lose

The intuition to be sure
If something's wasted time or purely what you need
To succeed

You want to understand it, the universal law
So you can send a message to the stars
Just like a silent prayer, an energy exchange
There is an answer for you
It's out there waiting in your heart

If you are open you will hear
You have to be brave, so don't fear and you'll be there
Just beware...

You want it, you'll get it
Try to live so that you won't regret it
You want it, you'll get it
If you only try to live and let it
Find it's way to you

It's out there waiting in your heart...
