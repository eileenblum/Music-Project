[Music &amp; Lyrics: P. Wagner]

All the years we joined our lives
We did never regret
Our decisions and the way
That we kept our heads

When I needed you the most
In my hour of pain
I awoke the rudest way
My belief was in vain

In you, as I tell you weren't there
Didn't catch my fall, oh no
Now you've killed all I had

Wrath is burning in my mind
Why can't you take it back
No excuses, no regrets
You just broke my back

No, you as I tell you weren't there
Didn't catch my fall, oh no
Now you've killed all I had

She killed and smiled
She killed and smiled
What a beautiful death you brought, my child

All the years we joined our lives
We did never regret
Our decisions and the way
That we kept our heads

When I needed you the most
In my hour of pain
I awoke the rudest way
My belief was in vain

Oh, you turned your back, shut your mouth
Didn't had a word of trust
Now you've killed all I had

She killed and smiled
She killed and smiled
What a beautiful death you brought, my child

Oh, you as I tell you weren't there
Didn't catch my fall, oh no
Now you've killed all I had

You turned your back, shut your mouth
Didn't had a word of love
Now you've killed all I had

She killed and smiled
She killed and smiled
What a beautiful death you brought, my child
