[Music: P. Wagner, S. Efthimiadis, C. Efthimiadis / Lyrics: P. Wagner]

A dangerous heritage they've left behind for us
So we meet our death before time
For our children, they can take the rest
But there's not much that we've saved in the past

Take these conditions, the memories fade
Choose a position between love and hate
Alternate lifestyle - A wish to escape
Travel this planet before it's too late

Where do we go? Who want's to know?

Dangerous heritage - Failures strike back
On your deathbed feel the grip 'round your neck
Dangerous heritage - You can't disclaim
Curse it whenever it hammers your brain

A dangerous heritage they've left behind
For us so we'll find no peace for all time
Talking and talking but then speaks the gun
Until the most senseless battle is won

When people's nation counts more than their lives
Then something's wrong in their heads for all time
We transfer our views from father to son
Ain't it our choice to wipe out what is wrong?

Where are we now? Who want's to know?

Dangerous heritage - Failures strike back
On your deathbed feel the grip 'round your neck
Dangerous heritage - You can't disclaim
Curse it whenever it hammers your brain
