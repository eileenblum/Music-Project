[Music &amp; Lyrics: P. Wagner]
[Bonus Track]

They came along last night
I knew again there was no end in sight
We all had too much
We needed a break to let it out our guts

So we turned it on to its highest point
Shot far over the line when it's fun
We dropped out on the edge
Stumbling on the edge

Set the mind afire
Let the engine run overpowered
'N' break the bonds of sleep
Feed the overdose with all to keep

And we turned it on to its highest point
Shot far over the line when it's fun
We dropped out on the edge
Stumbling on the edge

On the edge when there's no point to go further
There's no way to turn the steerwheel 'round
What else left then to take it as a man
Accept the final rest for now
And wait for the return
