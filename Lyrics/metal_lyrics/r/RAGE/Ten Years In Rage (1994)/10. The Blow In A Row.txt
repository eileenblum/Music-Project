[Music &amp; Lyrics: P. Wagner]

No way out - Suicide
No way out - Suicide

Help me, I must reach the border
I run from the keepers of order
They have locked me up just for nothing

Help me I'm down by law
Help me I'm down by law
Watch out, they're at your door
Help me, I'm down by law

Autumn - The time of darkness and decay
Life's running shorter day by day

Winter - Has gripped the land in cold caress
He's all alone and deeply depressed, she's dead

Don't you fear the winter, I will keep you safe
And warm
Don't you fear the winter, nothing's gonna
Do you harm
Don't you fear the winter, I will keep you safe
And warm
Don't you fear the winter, come with me
There'll be no harm

Flying high, setting signs
We got the future in our veins
But still a long way to go

All we know has lost its size
If you're looking down from space
Your problems are unreal at one blow

We are the only truth?
How can we be so smug
Like a child playing God...

I wish I knew
Is it still far to go - Invisible horizons
What is behind
The picture in my mind - Invisible horizons

I'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
And I'm just waiting for moonlight and then my eyes can see
I'm just waiting for the moon to come and set me free
Because the moonlight can release me from my misery

Enough is enough - You can control
Enough is enough - Those who don't know

Faster - This world is heading straight into a big disaster
Tell me, when will it reach its end?
Bigger - When moneymakers stamp our souls with technology
Believe me, this got to reach an end
All this misery in our minds will break free, you will see...

Since a while I thought 'bout leaving here
I can see no way to get it clear
Under you I feel misunderstood
In this respectable neighbourhood

Hey, don't look for me no more
'Cause I won't be coming home

I'm just a solitary man
I'm gonna leave you now alone
Well, I'm a solitary man
I feel so strange here, do you know?

Nevermore - Never evermore...
