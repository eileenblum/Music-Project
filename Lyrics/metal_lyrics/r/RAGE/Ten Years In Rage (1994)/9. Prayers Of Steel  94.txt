[Music &amp; Lyrics: P. Wagner]

Lay me on an anvil, oh Lord
And forge me in a crowbar
Let me pry young virgin souls
Give 'em strength somehow

Lay me on an anvil, oh Lord
And forge me in a spike
Drive me in the wasted hearts
To straighten out their lifes

Let me be your weapon, oh lord
Fight for truth real hard
Let me roar with all your force
Fight for you and guard

Let me be your clearest spirit
Hold your temple high
From the darkest souls, so deep
To the blackest night

All your wisdom give me, oh Lord
Teach me prayers of steel
Give me strength and give me power
Give me prayers of steel
