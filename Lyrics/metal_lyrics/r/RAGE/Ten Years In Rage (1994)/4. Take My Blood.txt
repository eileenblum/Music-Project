[Music: P. Wagner, C. Efthimiadis, S. Efthimiadis / Lyrics: P. Wagner]

People talked about this man
That he could walk on water and
That he would be a healer who could
Make the blind ones see again

He never told 'em lies
Though he took them by surprise
"I'll offer you the truth, so you can
Take my blood, believe or not
And you'll see, the Word is me"
He did the only thing he knew
But what, the fuck, was he supposed to do?

People talked about this man
That he'd be the Messiah and
He told them to feel love but they
Just nailed him the cross instead

He wasn't real surprised
'Cause he unmasked their lies
"I'll offer you the truth, so you can
Take my blood, believe or not
And you'll see, the Blood is me
Take my blood, I'm not a god
And you'll see, it's only me"
He did the only thing he knew
But what, the fuck, was he supposed to do?

He was the very first to prove
This world's too blind to see the truth
He did the only thing he knew
But what, the fuck, was he supposed to do?

People wrote about this man
'Most every single word and then
They founded a church and made their law
In his name they still slay the poor

They only tell you lies
It would take him by surprise
"I'll offer you the truth, so you can
Take my blood, believe or not
And you'll see, the Blood is me
Take my blood, I'm not a god
And you'll see, it's only me"

He was the very first to prove
The world's too blind to see the truth
He did the only thing he knew
You know, the fuck
What you're supposed to do!
