[Music: P. Wagner, M. Schmidt / Lyrics: P. Wagner]
[Bonus Track]

Hey don't walk on by
You, don't stomp on my face
Once I was like you
I didn't care for nothing else
Had no sense for more than money and fame
Power and greed and the so called honour

Now I am gone and my body lies cold
Not much is left, so I pray

From the underworld, oh, listen now!
From the underworld, oh, listen now!
Listen now!

Time - I never had
Rushed through a restless day
You seem to be blind, too
When luck comes your way

You had no patience with people who cared
Until you lost them and when you grow old
You'll be a lonely rich man without hope
There's more to be than we see

From the underworld, oh, listen now!
From the underworld, oh, listen now!
Listen now!
