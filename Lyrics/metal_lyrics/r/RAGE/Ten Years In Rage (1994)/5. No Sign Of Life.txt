[Music &amp; Lyrics: P. Wagner]

Oh Lord Jesus, come down from your cross
See what's going on, see what's going on
And meanwhile your land is getting lost
Take your brother home, he is dead and gone

The house is burning, the man stopped turning
Compromising, paralysing, what a drag

He has held his hand wide open
But his neighbor left it out
Long forgotten wounds break open
I can't help you watching out
I have seen no sign of life

Hey, you soldier, spare your sister's life
Don't turn out the light, don't you be afraid
Don't leave this land mine here in our street
This is not a job, killing people's not a job

Man is burning, the world stopped turning
Terrorizing, compromising not at all

He has held his hand wide open
But his neighbor left it out
Long forgotten scars break open
I can't help you watching out
I have seen no sign of life
