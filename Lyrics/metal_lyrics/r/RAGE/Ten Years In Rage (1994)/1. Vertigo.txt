[Music &amp; Lyrics: P. Wagner]

Look into my eyes and sink deeper
Look into my eyes
Drown into my will like a sleeper
Drown into my eyes
Now you feel as light as a feather
Leave it all behind
Strip your mind of all that encaged you
Forget about the time

And from the first sight to the last
The world is tumbling into vertigo

I can lead you, ways to explore you
Ways you'd never find
I can make you mine if I want to
You'd make up my mind
Feel these healing hands
Eyes of fire, magic pendulum
Makes you dizzy at first sight
Now my time has come

Oh, something touched you deep inside
Oh, take hold of a distant light
Oh, hypnotised, feels like vertigo
