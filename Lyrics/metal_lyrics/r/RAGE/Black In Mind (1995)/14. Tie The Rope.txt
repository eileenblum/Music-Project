[bonus  track]

Some kids of today
Live a boring life, they say
Playing deadly games
Risk their life for just a thrill
No one wants to see how final is eternity
Show me you're alive, I'm waiting for a sign
Frame their gallows, meet their death
They tie the rope they'll hang at last
Open up your eyes
Life means more than being alive
Check out what you've got
The end will be there soon enough
No one wants to see how final is eternity
Show me you're alive, I'm waiting for a sign
Frame their gallows, meet their death
They tie the rope they'll hang at last
