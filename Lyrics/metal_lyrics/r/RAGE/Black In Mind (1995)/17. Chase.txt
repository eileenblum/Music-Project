[Bonus track]

Murder, you've murdered my love
Senseless you wasted her life
Power I need for revenge
My pain you can't comprehend

No! you've turned off the light of my life
I'll wait for my chance

I will hunt you 'till death
Strike you down on the chase
If it takes my last breath
I'll strike you down an the chase
Strike you down

No break 'till I've switched you off
I'll give you what you gave my love
My mind it needs to be cleansed
I'll get you - you know what that means

No! you've turned off the light of my life
I'll wait for my chance

I will hunt you 'till death
Strike you down on the chase
If it takes my last breath
I'll strike you down an the chase
Strike you down
