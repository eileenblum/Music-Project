[bonus track]

It was so disappointing
That all my trust was built on sand
It was against all reason
Although it happened again and again
Eye to eye the innocence died
Forgive but don't forget
Never fail twice
Forgive but don't forget
Straight through the lies
Your speech was full of treason
Although your heart was innocent
I had to pay for your sins
I healed my wounds, now I'm stronger than all
Head to toes experience grows
Forgive but don't forget
Never fail twice
Forgive but don't forget
Straight through the lies
