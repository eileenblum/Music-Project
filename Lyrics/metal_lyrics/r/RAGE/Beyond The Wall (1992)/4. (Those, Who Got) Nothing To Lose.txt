[Music: P. Wagner, M. Schmidt/Lyrics: P. Wagner]

A simple man from a no - wonderland
where you bury your dreams at birth.
He took a heart, cause he couldn't believe
that there's no better place on earth

Eastern man meets western land
holding his life in his hands
it is all over for those, who got nothing to lose

All of his life he had struggled for free
starving the rest of the time
without a dime and with no human rights
in a society built up on crime

and now eastern man meets western land
holding his life in his hands
what can the world do with
those, who got nothing to lose

Here he is, but what now?
Left outside, unwanted
