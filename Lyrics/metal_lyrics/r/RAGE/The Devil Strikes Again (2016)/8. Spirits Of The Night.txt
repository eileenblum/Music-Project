Face of horror, walls of death,
The depths in our mind.
No tomorrow, evil blessing,
The horror of the blind.
I have looked into your eyes,
I didn't recognize.
There only was a blackened shadow
Screaming as it dies.
Waking to the light,
Perception makes me scream,
'Cause reality
Is worse than I could dream.
The spirits of the night live on and on,
The visions of that dream, it won't be gone.
The spirits of the night won't leave me,
The spirits of the night, they live on and on.
Come the morning, help me breathe,
I must escape the night.
Let me just abandon this,
I know it wasn't right.
Like a cancer in the flesh
It's eating up my brain.
Just a spiral downwards bound,
All hatred turns to pain.
