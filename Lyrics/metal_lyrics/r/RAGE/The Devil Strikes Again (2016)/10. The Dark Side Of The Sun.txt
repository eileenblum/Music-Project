[Music: Wagner/Rodriguez; lyrics: Wagner]

In my nightmares, when I die,
I just see my long forgotten, breaking eyes.
I'm afraid I lived a lie,
My life's challenges, I never did reply.
All so many doors I haven't tried,
All those wasted chances, 'cause I was afraid.
All the people that I never reached a hand,
'Til it was too late, I'm on my final stand.
I'm the only one
On a journey to the
Dark side of the sun
I'm almost dead and gone
On my journey to the
Dark side of the sun
Nothing will be won
On my journey to the
Dark side of the sun
I'm eternal gone
On my journey to the
Dark side of the sun
That's just our eternal fear,
To have left out our chances while we're here.
And we find our spirits clear,
But the flesh is weak and rotten, it appears.
