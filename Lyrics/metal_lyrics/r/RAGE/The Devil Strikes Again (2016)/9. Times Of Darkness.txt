See the fires, smoking guns,
Death is all around.
No desires on the run,
Misery we've found.
Everyone we've seen
Has been through hell,
Had that war in their eyes.
Total darkness, no more tears,
End of all we've known.
Reign of madness, reign of fear,
What have we become?
Is there a way back?
Can we forgive?
In these times of darkness
All humanity had died.
Thirty years that war was raging on.
In these times of darkness
When mankind denied itself,
Burned into the memory of all souls.
Empty faces, hollow cheeks,
All the hope is gone.
For survival we're too weak,
This war can't be won.
All this endless death, it was in vain..
