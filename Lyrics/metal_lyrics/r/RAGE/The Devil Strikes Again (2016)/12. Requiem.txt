Dry your tears!
Now is the time for peace
Time to look up and let it go,
Reach out your hand and
You will find what you have lost.
Wake up from all those wasted years,
Think for yourself, forget your fears.
Deep inside there is a flame,
Rising higher every day.
I know I am heading for the end.
Can I turn around? For sure
I don't need it anymore.
Feels like I write my own requiem.
Dare to win!
Trust in the hands of fate.
Open your eyes and you will see,
You will find help where
You will not expect it now.
You have it all in your own hands,
Look at yourself and you will find...
