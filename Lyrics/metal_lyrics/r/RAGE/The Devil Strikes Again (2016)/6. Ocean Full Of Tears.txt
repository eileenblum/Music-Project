When everything in me is dead
There is a void inside my head.
And my direction disappears
To leave me drowning in my fears.
Then from the ashes I will crawl,
Just to find myself in free fall.
It's like the tumbling of the dice,
My life is spinning in your lies.
You've turned my world from upside down,
All I have lost just can't be found,
My inner self's an empty shell,
How can I break free from this hell.
So many dark and lonely nights,
So many cracks I've tried to hide.
You leave me shattered in disgrace,
I'm disappearing in the haze.
I can't get over you,
You're an ocean full of tears.
To free my head from you
Needs an ocean full of tears.
I don't expect you to believe
How much my life's disturbed in grief.
Still I can't tread on safer ground
As all your poison's still around.
Time is a healer, so they say
And I can't wait to see the day
When all the truth will come to light,
When finally wrong turns to right.
