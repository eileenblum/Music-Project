[originally by Skid Row]You got me forced to keep my legs in two
I'm still stuck inside this rubber room
I gotta punch the clock that leads the blind
I'm just another gear in the assembly line, oh no

The noose gets tighter
Around my throat
But I ain't at the end of my rope

'Cause I won't be the one left behind
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind

Tear down the rat racial slime
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind

Get it?

A routine injection, a lethal dose
But my day in the sun ain't even close
There's no need to waste your prayers over here
You better mark my words 'cause I masturbate
Yes, indeed

You might beg for mercy to get by
But I'd rather tear this thorn
From my side

'Cause I won't be the one left behind
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind

Tear down the rat racial slime
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind

They swallowed their daggers by turning their trick
They tore my intention apart brick by brick
I'm sick of the jive, talk verbal insecticide

They swallowed their daggers by turning their trick
They tore my intention apart brick by brick
I'm sick of the jive, talk verbal insecticide

I won't be the one left behind
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind

Tear down the rat racial slime
You can't be king of the world
If you're slave to the grind

Well, I said, slave to the grind
Slave to the grind
Slave to the grind
