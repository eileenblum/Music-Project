[originally by Y&amp;T]So far somehow I've managed to keep control
It's time to get them balls free to roll
I save it all up for the right time to let it go, go, go
Fair warning, be ready, I'm gonna explode

All week long gonna prime up for what we do
And when I get it up, gonna spend some time with you
Have me some fun, gonna shoot my guns in the sky
Now you know but oh, it's easy to fly, I'm flying high

Open fire when I hit the stage
Gonna open fire all over this place
Open fire in a rocking rage
Oh, oh, I'm gonna open fire

Lights go down, you know I'm gonna tear it up
Get real gnarly, we're gonna strut our stuff
Like a short fuse on a stick of dynamite
Full blast, oh, now we're gonna ignite
Blow up the night, do it right, I'm gonna ignite

Open fire when I hit the stage
Gonna open fire all over this place
Open fire in a rocking rage

Oh, oh, I'm gonna open fire

Set me free, light my fuse
Gonna blow up the night, yeah

So far somehow I've managed to keep control
Well, it's time to set them balls free to roll
I save it all up for the right time to let it go, go, go
Fair warning, be ready, I'm gonna explode

You better light my fuse
Get ready, I'm gonna explode

Open fire when I hit the stage
Gonna open fire all over this place
Open fire in a rocking rage
Oh, oh, I'm gonna open fire

Wow, set me free right now
Light my fuse
Gonna blow up the night
