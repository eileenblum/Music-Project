Fear is epidemic, brutality and lust,
Humanity is drowning in the dust.
Disasters of the future â
The heritage of the past.
No one knows how long we're gonna last.
Do you believe me, the times are getting rough,
This will be the end, the final curtain falls.
Would you believe me,
We've had it all too much
This will be the end, the final curtain falls.
Servant finds a master,
The master claims he's god.
Break the circle and trust me, he is not!
Once a stone is rolling
You cannot turn it around.
Unstoppable it's crumbling to the ground.
