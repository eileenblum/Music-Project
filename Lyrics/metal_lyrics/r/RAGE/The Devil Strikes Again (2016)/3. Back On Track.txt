Awoken from a winter's night,
Shake off the dust and wipe my eyes.
The rays of sun in early spring
Melt ice and snow, surround my skin.
I just can't recall the times,
I was unconscious, black in mind.
The demons of the past are dead,
It's about time to lift my head.
In this life we all get our chances,
Just be clear or they will pass you by.
What you send out will be reflected,
What you ask for, there is a reply
Back on track, we're gonna turn it all around,
Heading for eternity, get ready for attack.
Back on track, we're gonna turn it upside down.
We're heading for eternity,
We're gonna get it backâ¦on track.
The lonely years are gone, you see,
I'm stepping out, you're here with me.
I have denied myself too long,
Was present but my mind was gone.
It's my responsibility
For what I started, now I see.
And then the here and now will be
The essence of our history.
