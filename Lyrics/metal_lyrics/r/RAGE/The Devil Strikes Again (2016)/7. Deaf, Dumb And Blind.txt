Have you ever read between the lines,
Can you see, we're heading for decline.
We declare to be the crown of all,
Don't you just forget, all kings must fall.
Don't you think it's funny,
Who do we think that we are.
While we cannot save ourselves at all,
Save us from the fall.
Are we deaf and dumb and blind?
As we mistreat our kind.
Are you deaf and dumb and blind?
You could be the next in line...
Do you ever feel superior
And divide the world in good and bad?
So we wipe away what we don't like,
Who is not our friend, he shall be dead.
Deaf! Dumb! And blind!
