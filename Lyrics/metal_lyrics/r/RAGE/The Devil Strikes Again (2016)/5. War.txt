In the eyes of the big global players everything's alright,
It's their god-given right to abuse us,
So thank you and good night.
In the world's biggest money machine
They're delivering the fuel.
Let there be some collateral damage,
That's their pervert rule,
Yes, that's their perfect rule.
That little girl in ruins
Gets a roaring lullaby.
And we all close our eyes,
'Cause it's our war
Just war, killing everyone
That's war, just war, let 'em jump the gun
War, our profit for their lives
Endless war, can religion justify
Holy war, and we sacrifice the truth
For that war, yes it's cynical but this is our war
In the world of elected deceivers,
The lobbies on their heels,
They will claim that we need the employment
To justify their deals.
And all those with no access to power,
They slay us with their gods
But their hate makes them even worse
Than all what they hate the most,
Now everything is lost.
The little girl in ruins,
She won't wake up to the day.
And now we close our eyes,
'Cause it's our war
Just war, killing everyone
That's war, just war, let 'em jump the gun
War, our profit for their lives
Endless war, can religion justify
Holy war, and we sacrifice the truth
For that war, yes it's cynical,
It's all so cynical,
'Cause this is our war!
