[Music by P. Wagner, S.Fischer, Lyrics by P.Wagner]

See these people like me, living in this dirty place
Feel this depression in these streets that lame the brain

It kills the will that drives me on
'Cause where'a no hope all power's gone
Why Am I here? A senseless birth
I'm not afraid to leave this earth

Heal these hollow eyes that keep on starting at these walls
Fill the empty space that's in these heads where chaos crawls

'Cause from the mud there comes disease
A new born hate disturbs the peace
A fatal end to all my grief
I've lost my pride, my self belief

I get my food from an unknown hand
I did nothing for it, understand

Still I'm waiting for a reason that could make a difference
But this is just another wasted day
Give me something to rely on, I don't know where I'am going
This is just another wasted day

Hear the voiceless calling in a world of noisy gear
Find the answer for a human child why it is here

'Cause from the mud there comes disease
A new born hate disturbs the peace
A fatal end to all my grief
I've lost my pride, my self belief

Not only out of work, we're out of all
it seems this world's for all of us too small
