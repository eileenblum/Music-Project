[Music by P. Wagner, S. Efthimiadis, S.Fischer, Lyrics by P.Wagner]

They lowered my body in a dark hole
the dry ground now covers my remains
I stood at their side and watched them crying
They can't know their tears they are in vain

All four winds together driving me forever
I'm not lost, I'm just alone

I can see, I can hear, I can be, be forevermore...

All four winds together driving me forever
I'm not lost, I'm just alone

Where shall I be in this demension?
Where are the others I await?
is this existence mean forever?
is there a door that leds away?

All four winds together driving me forever
I'm not lost, I'm just alone

Nailed to a cross of isolation
My punishment is I'm all alone
Just alone, alone...
