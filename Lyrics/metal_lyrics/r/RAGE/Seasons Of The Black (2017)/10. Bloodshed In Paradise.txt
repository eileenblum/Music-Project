Civilisation has come a long way
And colonisation has spread like a bad disease
Wherever we go, we leave scorched earth behind us and
We kill every life, we're like death in disguise

Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed and genocide
Mark our way, past and today

Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed and genocide
Mark our way, past and today
Past and today!

Our legitimation, it roots in a lie
We claim we are chosen by a mind construct called god
But where is the proof that our concept to live is right?
We might not be ready, an unevolved mind

Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed and genocide
Mark our way, past and today

Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed and genocide
Mark our way, past and today

Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed and genocide
Mark our way, past and today

Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed in paradise
Bloodshed and genocide
Mark our way, past and today

Bloodshed and genocide
That's our way, past and today

That's our way
