Since the beginning of all time
There is a universal mind
That is the source of all there is
And everything that was will be
Nothing is lost eternally
We're just a tiny part of this

We cannot see
We think we're so much special
Pretend to be
A god like ego maniac

Do we really rule this place?
I don't believe
'Cause all we know is not
Our ambitions locked in time and space, you see
That all we know is not
Not a single stone will stand the test of time
'Cause all we know is not
Not the greatest thought that will survive
All we are is not

We left our footprints everywhere
And changed the face of mother earth
But time will wash it all away

We cannot see
We think we're so much better
Pretend to be
A god like ego maniac

Do we really rule this place?
I don't believe
'Cause all we know is not
Our ambitions locked in time and space, you see
That all we know is not
Not a single stone will stand the test of time
'Cause all we know is not
Not the greatest thought that will survive
All we are is not

We cannot see
We think we're so much better
Pretend to be
A god like ego maniac

Do we really rule this place?
I don't believe
'Cause all we know is not
Our ambitions locked in time and space, you see
That all we know is not
Not a single stone will stand the test of time
'Cause all we know is not
Not the greatest thought that will survive
All we are is not

All we know is not!

A god like ego maniac

Do we really rule this place?
I don't believe
'Cause all we know is not
Our ambitions locked in time and space, you see
That all we know is not
Not a single stone will stand the test of time
'Cause all we know is not
Not the greatest thought that will survive
'Cause all we are is not

All we know is not!
All we know is not!

All we know is not!
