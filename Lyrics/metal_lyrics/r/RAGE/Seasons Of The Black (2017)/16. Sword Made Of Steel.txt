You see the guys in spikes and leather
That's what it means to me
Just we, we rule the night together
That's what is worth to be

When the day is gone
The metal show is going on
It takes your breath away
Can't you see the only way

Together we are like a sword made of steel
No one treats us wrong
Together we are strong

The heat, the sweat stucks all together
But still they battle on
No fear, the power of the masses
Every fight, it will be won

When the day is dawn
The metal show is going on
It takes your breath away
Can't you see the only way

Together we are like a sword made of steel
No one treats us wrong
Together we are strong

Run to the limit
No one can stop you, full speed
Break up the old way
Free will, not force's what you need

Power and loudness
Give you the strength for the day
We blow free your mind now
Arm you to go your own way
