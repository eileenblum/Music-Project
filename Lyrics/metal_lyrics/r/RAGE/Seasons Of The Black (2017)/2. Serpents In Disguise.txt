Won't you take the time, reflect the latest crime
The mob is going mad and all this blood is shed
The haters use religion, claim a nation under god
It all looks fine for simple minds, it's not!

Take a second look, your heroes are just crooks
They'll promise you the moon, but truth will follow soon
And when you're waiting for them to deliver what they said
You'll find you're being used until you're dead

Beware of serpents in disguise
They try to sneak into your mind
Beware of serpents in disguise
They take your will and make you blind
Beware of serpents in disguise

No one wants to see and learn from history
When leaders of a state abuse the speech of hate
The dogs of war are howling, barking down the naive lambs
That still believe in clichÃ©s of the past

Beware of serpents in disguise
They try to sneak into your mind
Beware of serpents in disguise
They take your will and make you blind
Beware of serpents in disguise
