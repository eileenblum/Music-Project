Hey! I see it in your eyes, disturbed and scared
All that is ringing the alarm
Hey, you want security, you want control
It slips away and does us harm

Run and hide, don't leave the house
That's the first impulse
Far beyond reality we believe we're next to die

Will they ruin our world?
Well, time will tell (they ruin our world)
Is our freedom lost?
Well, time will tell (our freedom's lost)
Can we stop this madness?
Time will tell (they ruin our world)
Just a fashion of our time to tell (our time to tell)
We've built this hell
So time will tell!

Now we see what's going on in our backyard
We've let it go and never cared
Those that we have left behind, they see a chance
To bring a sense in their dead lives

Like it was in every age
They raise the flag of hate
Give their lives for land and god
Or a promised paradise

Will they ruin our world?
Well, time will tell (they ruin our world)
Is our freedom lost?
Well, time will tell (our freedom's lost)
Can we stop this madness?
Time will tell (they ruin our world)
Just a fashion of our time to tell (our time to tell)
We've built this hell
So time will tell!

Like it was in every age
They raise the flag of hate
Give their lives for land and god
Or a promised paradise

Will they ruin our world?
Well, time will tell (they ruin our world)
Is our freedom lost?
Well, time will tell (our freedom's lost)
Can we stop this madness?
Time will tell (they ruin our world)
Just a fashion of our time to tell (our time to tell)
We've built this hell
So time will tell!

Well, time will tell!

We've built this hell
Well, time will tell!
