The last petition for clemency
Was turned down yesterday
So now they strap him in that room to die
The I.V.'s are inserted in his veins
One in each arm
The needles that they use are sterilized

And all these efforts for the kill
Annihilate the life
That we all take for granted
Human right

Justify, such a lie
Tell me why, can we justify
That they die, that's a lie
Tell me why, can we justify?
Can we justify?
Can we justify?

The poison runs through the body now
To paralyze his lungs
The cramps will shake him
While his heart stands still
Whatever he had done before
This killing is just the same
This cannot be the answer, nothing's healed

And all these efforts for the kill
Annihilate the life
That we all take for granted
Human right

Justify, such a lie
Tell me why, can we justify
That they die, that's a lie
Tell me why, can we justify?
Can we justify?
Can we justify?

And all these efforts for the kill
Annihilate the life
That we all take for granted
Human right

Justify, such a lie
Tell me why, can we justify
That they die, that's a lie
Tell me why, can we justify?
Can we justify?
Can we justify?

Justify, such a lie
Tell me why, can we justify
That they die, that's a lie
Tell me why, can we justify?
Can we justify?
Can we justify?

Who wants to be the one to throw the stone?
We're choking on revenge, that's all we've known
