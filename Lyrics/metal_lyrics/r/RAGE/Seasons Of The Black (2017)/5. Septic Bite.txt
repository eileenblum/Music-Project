Oh!
I see those giant bones, they take me far away
I pretend that I am back in the cretaceous age
Feel the heat, the sun is burning on Gondwanaland
See the giant Araucaria forests at right hand

Then suddenly I hear a distant roaring from the trees
A giant T. Rex in full size, I guess he's on my trail

His jaws are coming over me
And death is at his side
The poison dripping from his teeth
This is the septic bite
He is the ruler of his age
The killer of his time
His poison kills the wounded prey
This is the septic bite

Oh!
His giant teeth, they have some gaps to gather meat
That is rotting in his mouth for only germs to breed
If he doesn't shatter you in just one single bite
Then you're gonna die of fever from your wounds tonight

'Cause evolution has created most effective ways
To feed it's creatures anyway, at that time and today

His jaws are coming over me
And death is at his side
The poison dripping from his teeth
This is the septic bite
He is the ruler of his age
The killer of his time
His poison kills the wounded prey
This is the septic bite

Then suddenly I hear a distant roaring from the trees
A giant T. Rex in full size, I guess he's on my trail

His jaws are coming over me
And death is at his side
The poison dripping from his teeth
This is the septic bite
He is the ruler of his age
The killer of his time
His poison kills the wounded prey
This is the septic bite

His jaws are coming over me
No, this is a septic bite
