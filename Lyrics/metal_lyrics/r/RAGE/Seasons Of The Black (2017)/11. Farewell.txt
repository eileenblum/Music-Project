Oh so many memories are rushing through my mind
Most feel warm but then they really hurt
'Cause they're gone and won't come back
The loneliness creeps cold in my life to paralyze my world

All those days and nights go by, we're here without love
Lost in time, farewell my friend, goodbye
I can't reach to you no more, a life without love
Lost in time, farewell my friend, goodbye

Sometimes we will get a glimpse how fragile is our lives
Then we might regret the things we've done
How we treat our brother is like how we treat ourselves
We can't take it back, all this is gone

All those days and nights go by, we're here without love
Lost in time, farewell my friend, goodbye
I can't reach to you no more, a life without love
Lost in time, farewell my friend, goodbye

And we have always failed when it comes to the kill
'Cause our aggression always wins
Die and let die, this is the only thing we can
We will connect to our ancestors â in vain

All those days and nights go by, we're here without love
Lost in time, farewell my friend, goodbye
I can't reach to you no more, a life without love
Lost in time, farewell my man, goodbye
