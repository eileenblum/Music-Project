S.O.S., I'm calling you
There's no way to get through
I'm scared to death, afraid it is too late

Where are you, the one I knew?
I look into your face
But all I see is just a mask of hate

When depression drowns your life
Frustration turns to fear
This overwhelming enemy
The final collapse it will be

You cut through my heart
When you say you want to die
How can I go on
When you walk among the dead

I cannot reach you
As you throw it all away
How can I go on
When you walk among the dead

You call me an egoist
I'd force you to live on
'Cause I don't want the pain to see you die

You never asked for being born
You simply have enough
But you're a part of me, I gave you life

When depression drowns your life
Frustration turns to fear
This overwhelming enemy
The final collapse it will be

You cut through my heart
When you say you want to die
How can I go on
When you walk among the dead

I cannot reach you
As you throw it all away
How can I go on
When you walk among the dead

Walk among the dead

When depression drowns your life
Frustration turns to fear
This overwhelming enemy
The final collapse it will be

You cut through my heart
When you say you want to die
How can I go on
When you walk among the dead

I cannot reach you
As you throw it all away
How can I go on
When you walk among the dead
