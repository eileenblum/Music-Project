My heart is deadly broken
I cannot fight no more
How could you do this to me
You've killed me in the core

I just don't know where to go
I'm lost without a home
And with a promise broken
You left me all alone

Now the horizon's blurring
I cannot see the day
Eternal night will be my destiny for evermore

It's the season of the black
No more hope, no turning back
When we bury our last dream
It's the season of the black

I gave it all that I've got
I believed this was my place
It seems you didn't mean it
That we could share our days

Now the horizon's blurring
I cannot see the day
Eternal night will be my destiny for evermore

It's the season of the black
No more hope, no turning back
When we bury our last dream
It's the season of the black

Now the horizon's blurring
I cannot see the day
Eternal night will be my destiny for evermore

It's the season of the black
No more hope, no turning back
When we bury our last dream
It's the season of the black

It's the season of the black
No more hope, no turning backï»¿
