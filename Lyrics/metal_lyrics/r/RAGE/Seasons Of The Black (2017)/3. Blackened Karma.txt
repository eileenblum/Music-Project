In the depths of our mind
Sleeps all that we've left behind,
All we've forgotten.
And all that we've ever made
Left a footprint in the universe,
A certain energy.

We gather what we send out
And we keep it all.

This is what we are,
Darkness lies within.
This is what we get,
That's blackened karma.
Give a little destiny,
Take away the pain.
This is what we've got,
That's blackened karma.

We are stuck to our fate
And however we might try to run away,
To turn around,
We will have to pay the price,
All we took away and all the bills we've left
Unpaid in life.
