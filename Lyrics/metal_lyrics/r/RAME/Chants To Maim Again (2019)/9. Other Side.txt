Spilled mist in the midnight corners.
Draughts are fluttering the curtains
Draughts can talk.
Steps, whispers, clatter and distant growls.
Doppelganger of your mother in the next-door room
Prayers in delirium, but after that
Someone will choke you at night.
The subtle world has opened a portal.
The subtle world will crush the undeserving.

And here is something that never was in flesh.
Sudden smell of a soil and mildew,
And here is something that once had flesh also.

I need no other summoning â
I dwell in the scent of distraction.
The old sickness-ridden and the young rames are my food.
Thickness of ape fear won't allow you to insight into me.

Sudden smell of a soil and mildew,
And here is something that once had flesh also.

The barrier is broken, the portal is open. Witching hour!

O, hear my distant night chants. I have two toys â will and fear.
I portray knot of winds in my fist and vanish in the nothingness.
