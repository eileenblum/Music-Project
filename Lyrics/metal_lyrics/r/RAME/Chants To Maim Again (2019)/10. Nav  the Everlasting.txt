Lunatic eyes of grief will hide where the emptiness
Will make a step into your door, with a weak, but deafening ringing.
The knife of routine will divide your life into before and after.
Neither a treacherous cold of a day,
Nor a warmth of star-smelling night
Can ever stop the annoying swinging of pendulum of desolation.

Rejection. Escape from yourself until in the dreams
You will fully realize that you go round in circles.
Madding maelstrom of emotions
Beats against the poverty of the earth life choice.
Make a step towards me and I will read your mind.

And, maybe, share a part of your anger.
Rose of the Winds of thoughts and thought forms.
Natal chart of billions of crossroads.

Thoughtography of happiness and thoughtography of mourning.
And enshrouds you with aether Nav' the Everlasting.

Unite and fall!
Unite and fall!
Unite and fall!

Did you ever come across the watery lunatic eyes of grief?
Do you still remember the bitter scent of coming loss?
And I would have never opened the cards of this Tarot
If I hadn't been cursed by the in between blessing.

You know my heroine by the name.
You catch the signs from this smithereens of Absolute.
Talking, staring, seeping in the mist,
Omnipresent great everlasting Nav'.
Standing in the mirror, standing in the corner
Hovering in the air, standing on the crossroads, summoning us.
