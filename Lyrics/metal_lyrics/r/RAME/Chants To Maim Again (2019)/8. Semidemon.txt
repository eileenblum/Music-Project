Under, underâ¦

Under the execution of the grey eyes of routine,
I often forgot who I am, forgot my real essence.
But every step of throes of rejection of all inborn anthropic,
By a treacherous impulse of a diseased nerve,

Returned on the road, trodden by the bloody footprints.
I`m observing the evening carnival,
Where every face of falsehood unmasks,
Devitalizing the brain connectivity to the former human senses.
In the restless flashes of fear, dehiscent portals of cold
Entwine and stay as an everlasting sign.

In the insomnia of soul and in the insomnia of flesh,
Vomiting the blood of the last sobs of love.
Mocking at sympathy, which often become rooted to itself.
Stripping off the human skin, unclutching the snake pattern.
I won`t forgive anyone, I won`t forgive myself.
I will only breath with the beating of the below justness.

I offer you ego in a pill, but I, on the contrary, laugh at it .
And spit at its dollish face.
You will never discover me,
My day will never touch your day.

I will obsess your body and slap your earth mother in the face four times.
Feel my alpha and omega if you want to be free.
But remember that an absolute freedom is an absolute solitude in a vacuum.
One day my asexuality will cry oil through a human skin
If there`s no more to wait for, then there I whisper one day.
