The water of enlightenment, tasted by none,
Be dropped on the rames of cold solitariness.
It didn't touch their eyes,
It didn't touch their hands
And even outworn by life, deadish rough feet.
I was cursed by that water through the placenta of the subtle world.
I see straight through your long ago faded words
Behind the masks of the diligent,
Behind the masks of those, who are the best in their regularity.

Now I'm alone and I feel that my kin is closing in on me.
Forty grey shadows behind my back
Look askance at me and continue wandering away farther,
Standing down for still alive prisoners.
After having been separated from my body,
My spirit will walk a lonely path.

Could it be that I'm that first murderer,
For you all have turned your backs upon me,
Leaving my ethereal flesh eternally in solitude?
Still I have to move further, stripping off
The Odal runes from my skin.
Untying the knots of the tight ropes of kin
With my bleeding palms, where the skin is scratched off.

Let you stand by, and watch, and postmortally feel the same
Could it be an another you?
Or just you without the former will
And with the baggage of remained desires.

Karma and Will. Karma and Willâ¦
It's only Karma and Willâ¦
Karma against the Will of human item.
