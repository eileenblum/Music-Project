Wheel of Sansara under the stigma of ape,
Lies of parent love is where I learnt to hate.
Prenatal source of greed of a foetus.
Sweet grimace of love â veiling of evil grin of an ape.
Prenatal origin of kin spirits pressure
Yes, this all is going to be this wayâ¦
The threads of the prison called "earth existence"
Sink deeply into the subtle world,
The threads on long clutches of Elohim.
The threads of an alien double-faced Moloch deity.
Every thought of enlightenment,
Every word of solitary and naked wisdom
Are futile, when being fed to the rotten consciousness of ape human.

For every concept of blessing is deeply besmeared
With the dirty touch of a life cell, eternally feeding the apes.
So searching for the truth is a way to eternal misery.
But did I sign the contract to eternal existence in the subtle world?
So, I have to go, the demons are beside, the candles are in my hand,
The night dale is desolate. There I now go to tear up this contract.

As hundreds of sorcerers ever lived, burnt
Thousands of homeless and nagging ghosts.
So, with the same words and under the same curse I also burn.
Coming through the two deaths at a time.
Salim, El, Sahar, Nav' and Prav' â go to the abyss.
You are all just the two sides of the same coin,
Just the same disguised essence of everlasting prison.
No I shall gain my absolute Nothingness.
