My wishes, they grow stronger
I feel the change inside
Can't hold on much longer
My death will be my pride

I fight for my freedom
A stain of divinity
Controlled by emotions
Roaring and unreal

I'm waiting for a miracle
Not knowing where the road will go
I stand tall

[Chorus]
I am torn in the maze of corruption
I must leave it behind to believe
In a world full of crime and corroded dreams
I'll break the bounds to be free

I aim in one direction
My vision has revealed
Clear is my conception
Guide by faith

No one can touch me
All barriers broke down
I fallow the thread of my fate
My destiny's changing here
Not knowing where the road will go
I stand tall

[Chorus]
I am torn in the maze of corruption
I must leave it behind to believe
In a world full of crime and corroded dreams
I'll break the bounds to be free
