I can't stop running, I know they're coming
I hear the sirens closing in
I can't return and I have no hope
I'm on my own at the end of my rope

[Chorus]
Endless grief torturing me
When all I want is freedom
Instant fear from what I hear
The dogs are on the run

I broke the boundaries, invoked bounties
I know they hunting me, I'm a wanted man

[Chorus]
Endless grief torturing me
When all I want is freedom
Instant fear from what i hear
The dogs are on the run
