I'm the God in the crowd now
It is the Devil's work
I am battered with emotions
I see the scars of life

Light of the dark
Like tiny grains of sand
Eyes in the sky

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows
If the seed of love will grow
A treasure in my mind
A madness so divine
Love is like a star
No matter how distant, how far
If our souls are strong enough
The light will claim our hearts

If you could see my reflection
You would see the truth
Then you could see beyond the madness
I'm in love with you

Light in the dark
A sudden glimpse of hope
A star inside, beings to rise

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows
If the seed of love will grow
A treasure in my mind
A madness so divine
Love is like a star
No matter how distant, how far
If our souls are strong enough
The light will claim our hearts
