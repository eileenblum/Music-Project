We live in a time where we cannot stick together
We're partners in crime
How could we all lit the fire

We see no reason why, why we should pray
We put faith in our credit card
But we all think we'll never pay

[Chorus]
It's on the wall, in aerosol
The judgment day will come to on and all
Preachers shouting it out loud
All we see is one black cloud
The sun shrouded and dark

We cannot ignore the changes in the weather
But we can try to slow the damage
Our selfish errors

[Chorus]
It's on the wall, in aerosol
The judgment day will come to one and all
Preachers shouting it out loud
All we see is one black cloud
The sun is in the dark
