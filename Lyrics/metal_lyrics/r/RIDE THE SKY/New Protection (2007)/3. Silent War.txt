I'm crawling out, out from my shell, into this lonely house
How can I go on?
To watch this charade in front of my eyes
I can taste the smell of fear, hope isn't in the air
I want to know and learn how to cope
Emotions are trapped inside

What have we done?
Are there no regrets?
No Sacrifices?

[Chorus]
A silent war, behind the door
Give me some strength, I'm praying
How can I carry on?
A glaring eye, from a lie
Followed by accusations
Why did you waste my time?

When words run out, I'm speechless and sad
My wounds will all heal in time
I followed a path, a trail in the sand
That the storm swept away

I can hear the wedding bell, the sound is still in my ears
How could I've known, I've been left on my own
I'm sick and tired to waiting
The dumbest thing I've done, is put my trust in you and holding on

[Chorus]
A silent war, behind the door
Give me some strength, I'm praying
How can I Carry on?
A poring eye, from a lie
Followed by accusations
Why did you waste my time?
