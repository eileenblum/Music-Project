Seeing a world cast in shadow
Seeing it all waste away
I am a flower fading
The last and none, none to come

I will live through the cleansing
I will bear witness to all
I'm gonna pray for us
For what's left behind
For our broken hearts

[Chorus]
The end of days is drawing near
So the rain will fall like tears
But the dusk of life will be the dawn
And the circle will be drawn - again

Here is the wind, can you hear it?
Singing the song of rebirth
The song of you and me
The song that marks the new beginning

[Chorus]
The end of days is drawing near
So the rain will fall like tears
But the dusk of life will be the dawn
And the circle will be drawn - again

Yeah, the end of days comes closer
What's left behind for us?
I want to know

[Chorus]
The end of days is finally here
And the rain will fall like tears
So the dusk of life will be the dawn
And the circle will be drawn - again
