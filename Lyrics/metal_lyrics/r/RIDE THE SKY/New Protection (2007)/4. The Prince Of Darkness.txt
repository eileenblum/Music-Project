(mammy, where are you?)

I'm air that you breathe, I'm all of the things that you see
Insatiable need, I crave for the blood that you bleed
I am the disere in you

[Chorus]
I'll give you hope when you dream away
Your life soon enough will fade
See the world through evil eyes
I'm the prince of darkness

So I am the seed, I feed on your fears and need
Go ahead, scream, no one will hear anyway

[Chorus]
I'll give you hope when you dream away
Your life soon enough will fade
See the world through evil eyes
I'm the prince of darkness

Falling down, nothing's going to matter
I will be your pain, desperation
In the stream of souls, in the beauty of dying
You'll be a star in my crown

Conscience recalled, you see I lead the fall
And best of it all light is within you enthralled
Eternity whispers your name

[Chorus]
I'll give you hope when you dream away
Your life soon enough will fade
See the world through evil eyes
I'm the prince of darkness
