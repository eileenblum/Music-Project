My heart is so full of sorrow, so full of revenge
I can't sleep, the night is like horror
Feels like I'm losing my mind
Can't eat, I can't sleep
I feel like a creep, living inside me
I'm fading away

[Chorus]
I'm haunted by dreams of desire
In the night I'm on fire
I am down where it's Hot
My soul is burning
Am I a psychopath or just a normal man?

I'm lost far out on the ocean
Can't find my way to the shore
I look for a sign, I open my mind
Salvation is lost to be found

Hunger and greed, call for its need
Emotions inside me, dragging me down

[Chorus]
I'm haunted by dreams of desire
Give me strength, give me power
At night I am hot, I am burning
I need to break the chains from the darker side
