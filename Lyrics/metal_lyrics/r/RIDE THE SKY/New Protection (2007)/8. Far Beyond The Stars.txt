There are memories deep in the heart of my soul
Feeding my dreams with a fire
We seek what is lost and together at last
We finally find what the pain is inside
Worlds all forgotten and buried in time
A love we can't deny
So let our legends guide us
Safely through the dark All

We see the light
A prophecy unknown
I see it in your eyes
We're reaching paradise

[Chorus]
So far beyond the stars
Is a place we once called home?
And we'll ride the sky of old
As the ancient legend told
We'll ride the skies of old

So we're leaving what's known for our souls silent cries
Will life be better and undisguised?
Will our souls find the hope they once had?
I put my trust in the world

I see the light
My soul is whole at last
I see it in your eyes
We're reaching paradise

[Chorus]
So far beyond the stars
Is a place we once called home
And we'll ride the sky of old
As the ancient legend told
We'll ride the skies of old
