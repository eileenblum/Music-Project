No future, no past
I am trapped in the flow of time
Hopefully wrong
I sense that all colors soon fade and die
Sad sensations, isolation
I'm painting the shadows on the wall

[Chorus]
A storm has begun
A final call
"I want you to know"
I'll show no fear, when I let go
Standing strong, where I belong
Embracing the demons in my mind

A crack in the wall
A glimmer of light from an eerie place
Fading away, but the essence will stay
I'm alive again
Hope is born, I am stronger
Painting the future on the wall

[Chorus]
A storm in my soul
A final call
"I want you to know"
I'll show no fear, when I let go
Standing strong, where I belong
Embracing the demons in my mind

Falling deeper fading
Falling deeper fading

And this storm has just begun

[Chorus]
Survivor of storms
I have my pride
"I want you to know"
Never regret, always believe
Standing strong, I hear the song
Song of all beauty in our world
