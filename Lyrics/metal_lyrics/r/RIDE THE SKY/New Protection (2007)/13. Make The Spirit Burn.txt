[Limited Edition bonus track]

Come to see eternity
See the light within the dark
Hear evil, see evil
I am your dark shadow
I'm your mirror though distorted, shattered sevenfold

[Chorus]
You can't control the fire
I can make your spirit burn

Come, embrace your deepest fears
Find divinity with me, seal your destiny
Go beyond insanity

[Chorus]
You can't control the fire
I can make your Spirit Burn

We can controll the fire
We can reach the spirit world
