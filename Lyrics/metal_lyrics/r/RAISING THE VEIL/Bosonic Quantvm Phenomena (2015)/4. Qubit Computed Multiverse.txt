Relativity of reality
There's no certainty of reality without a reference world
There's no certainty of reality without a reference world

Cognition
A qubit computed state
Simulate
Artificial consciousness
Indicate
Synthetic environments
Just envated
Unreflecting
Benighted
Human brains

All we feel
At times surreal
Yet in our dreams
All seems so real and vivid too

Creation of the hyper computer
Universal quantum qubit
Turing machine
Calculation of hyper computed infinity
And probabilities of the hyper heuristic and infinite

Algorithmic evolution

Collapse of the quantum wave
Function is the solution to the human mind
Body problem
The collapse of the quantum wave
Function is the solution

To this perceived and limited so called human consciousness

At the brink of sleep or the realm of the dead

Entering the realm of shades
Sucked into a calculated death
Computed triggering and processing of the amygdala

Entering the realm of shades
Sucked into a calculated death

Collapse of the quantum wave
Function is the solution to the human mind
Body problem
The collapse of the quantum wave
Function is the solution

To this perceived and limited so called human consciousness

There's no certainty of reality without a reference world
