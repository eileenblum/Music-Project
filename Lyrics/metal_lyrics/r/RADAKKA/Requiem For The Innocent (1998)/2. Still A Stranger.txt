Hauntingly familiar words come to me
It's happend all before
You still kill my soul

The space I hold you in
A secret memory
I'll teach you all my sin
You reach for all and more

Still A Stranger, hidden in the dark
Still A Stranger, a lost and killing soul

It kills my every thought
It sucks the life from me
I wake to only find
I've lost my fucking mind

The space I hold you in
A secret memory
I'll teach you all my sin
You reach for all and more

Still A Stranger, hidden in the dark
Still A Stranger, tearing me apart
Still A Stranger, heart is growing cold
Still A Stranger, a lost and killing soul

I wish to see the sun
To hear I love someone
To feel the love inside
To not have wished to die

The space I hold you in
A secret memory
I'll teach you all my sin
You reach for all and more

Still A Stranger, hidden in the dark
Still A Stranger, tearing me apart
Still A Stranger, heart is growing cold
Still A Stranger, a lost and killing soul
