Blind looking the other way
For something wicked comes
Wicked comes this way

Another dark and lonely night
Fate's grip is setting in
It's over final done

Hey man I'm talkin' to you
You're just a lame bitch motherfucker
bleeding my dreams
So long to a beautiful thing
There's no looking back I gotta bury the sting

So welcome to nowhere
So phantom number nine

Just like a flicker in the dark
A blackened piece of mind
Will slip away for good

Empty bottles on the floor
Last night is washed away
But there's phantoms at the door

Fuck off with your negative views
You're just a laid back motherfucker
singin' the blues
God knows we're turning circles
So light my fuse and blow away

So welcome to nowhere So...
So cold out here in nowhere So...
Phantom number nine
Phantom number nine

And in this blackened pitch that was a home
A sanctuary turning cold
The stinging sweat of misplaced anger
A distant sunset so long ago

So welcome to nowhere So...
So cold out here in nowhere So...
Phantom number nine
Phantom number nine
Phantom number nine
