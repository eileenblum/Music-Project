You think you know me
You think you own me
But I don't really care if you think at all

Young girls abore me
They just want to hold me
And pray that they have enough to give

I am emotion
A step past erosion
As my shore slowly fades and begins to deplete

Never mind the time I've wasted
Until I find myself again
Never mind the lies you're facing

Cult of one I'm a cult of one
And I close I close my eyes close my eyes
Cult of one I'm a cult of one
And I close my eyes
To you

I can't deny it
I won't deny it
I can't seem to slip away from me

Never mind the time I've wasted
Until I find myself again
Never mind the lies you're facing

Cult of one I'm a cult of one
And I close I close my eyes close my eyes
Cult of one I'm a cult of one
And I close my eyes

I don't even know myself
Can't control myself
Anymore
