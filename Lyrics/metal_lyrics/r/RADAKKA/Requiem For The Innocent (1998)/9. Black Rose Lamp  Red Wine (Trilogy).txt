[Gothic Rain]

She sold her soul today
I feil it slip away
I can't believe she's gone
God, how long did it take
It's raining, my lover, in my heart (come home)

My mind starts feeding on itself
As I die awake at night
Her smile, wiped away by suffering
And she knows but now she's finally free
And though she's gone, she still holds,
The black rose

Cat's in the cradle, the dog's on dope
Salvation's burning scream caught in your throat

Please this woman she craves
Jesus love her, forgive her, her pain

I know when you're watching me
I see your face in my dreams
I feel your body on me
I couldn't bring myself to turn away
I taste your sweet dark perfume
How could I help you be free

Set you free you burned for me
Set you free only you can
Set you free set you free you burned
Set you free

Set you free you burned for me
Set you free only you can
Set you free set you free you burned
Set you free

Was all this real or just a wicked dream
You were my only last hope
It wasn't right that I should live forever
Why did you go why did you leave me here
I'm sorry please let me go
Now that you're gone I wish I could be with you
I feel you I need you I love you too

Immortal soldier lost lust for the night
Noctunal queen of blood bow to the light

Please this woman she craves
Jesus love her protect her from pain

I know when you're watching me
I see your face in my dreams
I feel your body on me
I couldn't bring myself to turn away
I taste your sweet dark perfume
How could I help you be free

Set you free you burned for me
Set you free only you can
Set you free set you free you burned
Set you free

It's raining in my heart
It's raining in my soul
It's raining in my heart
It's raining in my soul
It's raining in my heart
It's raining in my soul
It's raining in my heart
It's raining in my soul
It's raining in my heart
It's raining in my soul
It's raining in my heart
It's raining in my soul.................

[Queen Of Autumn]

It happened not so long ago
My invitation to the darkest dance (of them all)

I met her in a smoke-filled room one night
There were colored lights and dancing all around
My heartbeat racing to the frantic sounds

She held a glass of red wine in her hand
Her long black hair brushed gently
on her smooth ivory skin
She looked at me and smiled that's when it began
Beautiful and surreal
So beautiful
She's mine

Sweet woman you were the one
who set my soul afire
You felt so sure that you had known me
for so many years
I fell in love with the idea of her
in my arms in my arms

Autumn my autumn my queen of autumn's gone
She'll spit the rancid taste of life
right from her mouth
Autumn my autumn my queen of autumn's gone
Dance of damnation candlelight burning like stars

Her laughter flowed like wine
Her lust was far beyond crime

How could she love me
How could she see as her saviour bloody saviour
I was her rapture dressed in black
And when I think alone I'm still thinking of her

Autumn my autumn my queen of autumn's gone
She'll spit the rancid taste of life
right from her mouth
Autumn my autumn my queen of autumn's gone
Dance of damnation candlelight burning like stars

The falling leaves spin thru the autumn air
Tell me is something wrong
The moon was full as shadows stood their ground
I cannot go on without you
I watched her crying red liquid tears
She whispered to me soufly in my ear
'Please come with me'
Those pale blue eyes were piercing thru my soul
One kiss and then we'll be forever
I've fallen from her sweet embrace I'm sorry
My dear I'm sorry I cannot go

Autumn my autumn my queen of autumn's gone
She'll spit the rancid taste of blood
right from your throat
Autumn my autumn my queen of autumn's gone
Dance of damnation candlelight burning like stars
Autumn my autumn my queen of autumn's gone
Dance of damnation candlelight burning like stars

You'll find the way that you deserve
Just hope and pray it's who you serve
You'll find the way that you deserve
Just hope and pray it's who you serve
You find the way
Pray it's who you serve............ 

[Sorrow's Thorn]

She wants to be free
Alone she stares out her window
She'll kiss sunrise
Relieved yet torn apart inside
Her teardrops saok
The waning autumn the waning autumn night

Tonight disaster finds a friend
Twilight peaking
The end as it shall be

Rain the rain's gone away
To the shadows of my heart
Rain the rain's gone away
And every where I look I see your face
And it's just not the same without you

A lover to the sun
The burning has been done
The leaves are dead and dry
But the smell of autumn...
...we'll burn the summer sky

Rain the rain's gone away
To the shadows of my heart
Rain the rain's gone away
And every where I look I see your face
And it's just not the same
Rain the rain's gone away
To the shadows of my heart
Rain the rain's gone away
Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Don't take me there with you.....

Rain the rain's gone away
For the morning's sunlit rays
Rain I've prayed for the rain
Since you've been gone I have prayed
Rain the rain's gone away
I've prayed and I've prayed and I've prayed
I've prayed
Rain the rain's gone away
There's nothing left for you
I dream in black and white
So full of emptiness...my world
