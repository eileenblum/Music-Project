All hail the loudest voice
Shouting what he's made of
Shut up and listen to us for once
We've got no time for your simple mind

I know what you want
You want to see us bow to you...
Don't hold your breath

In a crowded room we stand alone
In a world of sin... WE DIE ALONE

Why are the pure of heart left to suffer
While the darkened souls are rewarded
with riches and power
Another day is just another conflict
Right or wrong you embrace the war
You think you're right
'cause there's strength in numbers
Don't even know what you're fighting for

I know what you need
You need to see us die for you

In a darkened room we watch alone
In a world of sin... WE DIE AOLNE

Why do we try to change the world
when no one listen
We'll never save them all... When will we question and reassess
The state of decay we forged for our children
The fools in power we allow to remain
With deceiving smiles they throw ourconcerns away
No more silver linings, another wasted life
Another fire burns inside
They say history is written by the victor
Without a fight they've already won
We'll all sing the Requiem for the innocent
As they fade silently in the eyes of existence

I know what you want
You want to see us, you need to see us bow to you
I know what you need
You need to see us die for you

In a crowded room we stand alone
In a world of sin... WE DIE ALONE
