You and I so tragically
Prove what trust should never be
You and me so beautiful
Express our love so violently

I above you when you're writhing on me
Who came for who I paid for you

If loving you is the end of my world
Then please turn out the lights

A darkened room that velvet touch
Your movement on me becomes too much
This carnal fight I've lost before
Addiction wins when you're back for more
Sweat drips from bodies pour a cup
Of lust for two
I take mine with sugar
Can I pour some for you

I'm using you to let you use me
It's a better way if i'm inside you
If loving you in the end of my world
Then please turn out the lights

See your face I'm losing ground on you
Feel you feel you feel you in my comfort zone
Feel you feel you feel you
Down down down got one foot in the ground
Feel you feel you

If loving you is the end of my world
Then please turn out the lights...

You and I so beautiful
You and me so violently...

See your face I'm losing ground on you
Feel you feel you feel you in my comfort zone
Feel you feel you feel you
Down down down got one foot in the ground
Feel you feel you
