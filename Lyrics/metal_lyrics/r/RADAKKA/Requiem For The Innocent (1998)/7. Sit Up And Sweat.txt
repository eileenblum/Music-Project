I took you for granted
Treated you with no respect
I guess I never knew the face that smiled at me
I fought so hard to believe in you

So here we go with our destruction
The bitter pill I'm forced to swallow

I'm sorry so sorry for what I did to you
I guess I'll never know how shallow you've become
Sit up and sweat

Sharpen the dagger, the one you used on me
Clean off the guilt so you can breathe
You, you cut me so fucking deep
You'll never know how bad you tore me up inside

So here we go with our destruction
The bitter pill I'm forced to swallow

I'm sorry so sorry for what I did to you
I guess I'll never know how shallow you've become
A little piece, piece of me still dying
And when you lie awake with guilt beside
Your bed you'll sit up and sweat

I'm sorry so sorry for what I did to you
I guess I'll never know how shallow you've become
A little piece, piece of me still dying
And when you lie awake with guilt beside
Your bed you'll sit up and sweat

Die young, sit up and sweat
Die young, sit up and sweat
Die young, sit up and sweat
Die young die young die young
We die we die young
