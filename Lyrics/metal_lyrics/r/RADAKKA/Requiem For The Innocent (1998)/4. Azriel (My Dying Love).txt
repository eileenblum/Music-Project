It must be you I'm still thinking of
It's hard for me to understand this hurt I feel

You don't know what it's like
You don't see me
You don't hear me
Cold wind blowing on my back
Icy fingers pulling from my past

Maybe maybe someday you will see

Azriel Azriel Azriel my dying love
Azriel Azriel Azriel my dying my dying love

Behind this mask still I wear a frown
I'm grabbing at hin air but there's nothing there
I still see you I still breathe you
I still taste you god I need you
I'm on my knees heaven help me please
My summer winter spring and fucking fall

You don't know what it's like
You don't see me
You don't hear me
Cold wind blowing on my back
Icy fingers pulling from my past

Maybe maybe someday you will see

Azriel Azriel Azriel my dying love
Azriel Azriel Azriel my dying my dying love

If I had a way, it's not to blame, not to blame
Would it be so wrong
to feel my feel my feel my pain
I love you...

Azriel Azriel Azriel my dying love
Azriel Azriel Azriel my dying my dying
Azriel Azriel Azriel my dying my dying my dying
my dying my dying my
dying love

Azriel
