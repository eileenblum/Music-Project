God damned me God damned me to a life of negativity
Pathetic just how my enemies define me
Victim of my own persuasion addict to confrontation
How did it come to this pinning for the feuds I miss
Defined by enemies

Rolled the dice one too many times
Never thought I would be the one to pay the price
No salvation to keep me sane and nowhere left to shift the blame
Inherent hate I will wear forever a deep resent that cannot be tamed

Lied defied no hope left for divinity
Lied defied my sins laid bare for none to see
God damned me defined by enemies
