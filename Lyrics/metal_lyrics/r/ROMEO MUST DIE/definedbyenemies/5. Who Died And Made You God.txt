Every time you drew for breath felt confident I would make you think you said too much
Each time I saw weakness I would hammer you down nail you to the floor
I hate what I see of myself in you
All things you hide bastard of lies eventually shine through

She pushed me to the brink, I could not think
I beat her black and blue she lied to her friends
Covered for him, said she fell down the stairs
Her desperate cries bastard of lies will come back to haunt you
Who died and made you god?

My lies are your only truth, it is my right to scar to bruise
To mentally and physically abuse you absent your court of conscience
Her desperate cries bastard of lies will come back to haunt you
Who died and made you god?
