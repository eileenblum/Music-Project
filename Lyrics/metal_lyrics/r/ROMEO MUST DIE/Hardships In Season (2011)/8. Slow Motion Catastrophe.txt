IN THESE TIMES OF MEDIOCRITY HIS PURITY OF PURPOSE SHINES LIKE A BEACON
STRIPPED OF ALL BUT SELF BELIEF LOOK TO HIM TO FIND THE KEY
GALVANIZE YOU FROM THIS LETHARGY

EVERY-TIME I HEAR YOU COMPLAIN HOW TIMES ARE HARD AND LIFE AND FAIR
RESENT FOR YOU GROWS HARD TO BARE CRYING OUT FOR SYMPATHY
WHEN YOUR LIPS MOVE EXCUSES FLOW A PARODY, BURDEN, AN IDLE JOKE

SLOW-MOTION CATASTROPHE DONâT HESITATE TO JUMP
PREPARE TO ADAPT OR EXPIRE LET YOUR FEARS DRIVE YOUR DESIRE STAB APATHY IN THE FACE
