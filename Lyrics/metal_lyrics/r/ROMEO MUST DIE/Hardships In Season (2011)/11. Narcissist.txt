THE GLOVES ARE OFF, YOUâRE FIGHTING WHAT YOU ARE
WEARING YOUR ANGER LIKE ARMOUR
COLOURLESS AND ODOURLESS, CONTAMINATING IN SILENCE
THOSE CLOSE TO YOU WALK ON EGGSHELLS

THE SEETHING INNER RAGE, THAT DERAILS LIVES
SIMMERING BENEATH THE SURFACE OF A NARCISSIST
EXPECTATIONS, IN A POOL OF BLOOD
BENEATH MY FEET YOUR DREAMS ARE CRUSHED

EXPECTATIONS, IN A POOL OF BLOOD
SUFFER MY FISTS FEEL MY DISGUST
YOUR DREAMS ARE CRUSHED
LIFE WITH A NARCISSIST

ALL BETS ARE OFF, YOUâRE FIGHTING WHAT YOU ARE
WEARING YOUR ANGER LIKE ARMOUR
COLOURLESS AND ODOURLESS,CONTAMINATING IN SILENCE
THOSE CLOSE TO YOU WALK ON EGGSHELLS

I KNOW YOU THINK YOU CAN CHANGE ME
THINK THAT YOU CAN TALK ME ROUND
BUT YOU JUST STIRRING THE DARKNESS IN ME
