PEEL AWAY MY SKIN TO FIND A CORE DISSECTED, BLEEDING, COMPROMISED
HOME OF ANXIETY AND FEAR THEIR PRESENCE GROWS WITH EVERY PASSING YEAR

WONâT WAIT FOR TIMEâS VIVISECTION OF ME

TEAR MY FLESH AND BEAT ME BLIND WITH THE TRUTH, TIMES VULTURES, CIRCLE MY PRIDE
EXPECTATIONS OF EACH NEW DAY, FREEZE ME RIGID WITH UNTOLD MISERY

LEARN TO COUNT MOMENTS NOT MONTHS COS ITâS THE HERE, THE NOW, I MUST CONFRONT
FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO SLOW TIMEâS HAND, HIGHLIGHT RESPECT THAT IT COMMANDS

THE WEEKS, MONTHS, YEARS BRING CLARITY THAT I WILL NEVER FAIL TO BE
SURPRISED BY HOW FAR I CAN FALL LIFEâS LESSONS WERE NO HELP AT ALL
THE SECONDS DRAIN MY ENERGY FORCE-FEEDING GRIM REALITY
TIMES HANDS SCRAPE AT A BRAZEN SOUL REMINDER OF ITâS SUPREME CONTROL
THE HERE, THE NOW, I MUST CONFRONT
