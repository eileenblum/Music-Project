THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY
IN THE SHADOW OF EVIL, I HAVE NO FEAR

HOPE FADES AWAY, WITH EVERY DYING DAY
FOR THOSE WHOSE WEAKNESSâ I USE TO FAN MY FLAME
ITâS NOT KARMA, ITâS NOT LUCK, MANIPULATE AND BURN THEIR TRUST
THEIR LOYALTY DISPLACED

SO LET THEM HATE

SLAVE TO A FATE THAT YOUR WEAK WILL CREATEâS
WITH EVERY PASSING YEAR YOUR LUST FOR LIFE DEFLATEâS
ONLY A COWARD WOULD COMMIT TO LIVE A LIFE WITHIN LIMITS
INVERTEBRATE MAN

âHATEFUL IS THE POWER AND PITY ON THE LIFE
OF THOSE WHO WISH TO BE FEARED RATHER THAN BE LOVEDâ

SO LET THEM HATE, HATE, AS LONG AS THEY FEARâ

YOU SAY YOU TRIED, THE TRUTH IS THAT YOU HIDE
BEHIND A WEAK FAÃADE OF DECENCY AND PRIDE
COMPLAINING AS U ROT AWAY, TALK OF REGRET, TALK OF MISTAKES
LIMP, GUTLESS, THIN SKINNED MAN

SO LET THEM HATE

YOUR HEAD IN SAND, NO RESPECT YOU COMMAND
WASTE OF A LIFE YOUR SO DEPENDABLE AND BLAND
CONSUMED BY FEAR AND JEALOUSY
DOUBT FOR YOURSELF, ENVY FOR ME YOU FUCKING ALSO RAN
