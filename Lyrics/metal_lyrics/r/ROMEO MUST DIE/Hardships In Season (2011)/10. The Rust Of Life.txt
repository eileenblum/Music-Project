I FEEL THE SQUEEZE OF PANIC IN MY CHEST CRUSHING MY LUNGS 
DOUBT MANIFESTS IN ME CHOKING ON INSECURITIES
THROAT DRIED SHUT AS THE BLEAK BELL CHIMES
TRAUMA CREEPS IN DURING BRITTLE TIMES IT SEEMS CONSUMED BY ANXIETY

NO MORE CAUTIOUS STEPS NOTHING MORE TO LOSE BUT MY APPREHENSIONS
THEY ARE BURIED WITHIN ME HOLES IN MY SELF ESTEEM
BIRTH OF ANXIETY THE RUST OF LIFE
IT IS BURIED WITHIN ME THE TRUTH THAT IS NEVER SEEN
I AM MY ENEMY THE RUST OF LIFE

DROPPED LIKE A STONE INTO A DARK WELL
BEATEN AND CHAINED IN THIS PRIVATE HELL
PESSIMISMSâ CASUALTY I AM THE DEATH OF A HAPPY SOUL
LOSS OF ALL FAITH LOSS OF SELF CONTROL ASPHYXIATING SANITY

NO MORE CAUTIOUS STEPS NOTHING MORE TO LOSE BUT MY FUCKING APPREHENSIONS
THEY ARE BURIED WITHIN ME HOLES IN MY SELF ESTEEM
BIRTH OF ANXIETY THE RUST OF LIFE
IT IS BURIED WITHIN ME THE TRUTH THAT IS NEVER SEEN
I AM MY ENEMY THE RUST OF LIFE
