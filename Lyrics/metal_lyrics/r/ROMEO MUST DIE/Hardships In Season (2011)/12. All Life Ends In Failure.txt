ALL LIFE ENDS IN FAILURE, HEART FAILURE
TIRED ORGANS, LIMBS, SPREADING CANCERS
THE OLD ARE SLOW AND COLD, BRITTLE AND BREATHLESS
YEAH WE CAN RUN BUT, AGEâLL CATCH US

DECAYING, ALL SENSES ERRODING THIS ABANDONMENTâS DEMEANING
(LEFT IN NO DOUBT THEYâVE OUTSTAYED THEIR WELCOME BRIEF)
HOLLOW SOLACE RELATIVES WILL FIND, IN OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND

EXILED BY A DAUGHTER / SON TO A STATE RUN BLACK ABYSS
WHERE NEON-LIT, DISINFECTED ROOMS SMELL OF BLEACH, FEAR AND PISS 
DEATHROW FOR THE BLAMELESS, THE BRITTLE AND THE BREATHLESS
DEMENTIA, THE GREAT TERROR OF OUR AGE IS AGE

ALL LIFE ENDS IN FAILURE, HEART FAILURE
TIRED ORGANS, LIMBS, SPREADING CANCERS
THE OLD ARE SLOW AND COLD, BRITTLE AND BREATHLESS
WE CAN RUN BUT, AGEâLL CATCH US

DECAYING, ALL SENSES ERRODING THIS ABANDONMENTâS DEMEANING
(LEFT IN NO DOUBT THEYâVE OUTSTAYED THEIR WELCOME BRIEF)
HOLLOW SOLACE RELATIVES WILL FIND, IN OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND

CONDEMNED TO LIVE AND BREATH AN INOBLE EXISTENCE
IN A PLACE WHERE FUTURE IS FICTION, EVERY INMATE ON A LIFE SENTENCE
