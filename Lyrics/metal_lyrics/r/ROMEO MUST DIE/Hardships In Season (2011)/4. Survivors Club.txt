HARDSHIPS IN SEASON, BUT DAY BY DAY I WILL GRIND DOWN THE GRIND (LIFEGRINDER)
WONâT WIN ME PRIZES, BUT LIVE IN HOPE TRUE HAPPINESS IâLL FIND (LIFEGRINDER)
FACE MEETING CONCRETE, DISBELIEF AND FEAR ENVELOPE ME (LIFEGRINDER)

SECONDS DISSECTED, CONTENTMENT JUST A FADING MEMORY (LIFEGRINDER)
BLOOD STAINS THE PAVEMENT, DARKNESS AND NAUSIA ENCIRCLE ME (LIFEGRINDER)
FACE SMASHED REFLECTION, SIRENS WAIL, PANIC REIGNS SUPREME

I CANâT GO ON, BELIEVING THAT MY BLOOD WONâT STAIN

SEE, WHAT YOUR MADE OF ,WHEN LIFE TURNS ON YOU

FRIENDS, PARENTS, LOVERS, CANâT MASK THEIR FEAR THAT I WILL NOT PULL THRU (LIFEGRINDER)
BED RIDDEN BREATHER, ALL TRACES OF COMPLACENCY REMOVED

DRUG INDUCED VISIONS, FACE DOWN IN THE DIRT KNAWING ON TEETH (LIFEGRINDER)
ARMS REACHING, CLAWING, BEAMS OF HOPE FOREVER OUT OF REACH (LIFEGRINDER)

I CANâT GO ON, BELIEVING THAT MY BLOOD WONâT STAIN
