AT ONE WITH THE RITUAL THE STRAIN IS PERPETUAL MY FISTS HAVE TURNED TO CLAY
THE WAVES TAKE ME UNDER BUT THE STRUGGLE FUELS HUNGER TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY
WHEN DEALT NEAR DEATH, THERE WAS NO WHITE LIGHT NO EXCUSES, NO COMPROMISE
SENT TO THE DEPTHS BY A FOOL AND A LIAR, EMERGED BREATHING FIRE
FOUR WALLS GETTING HIGHER HOPES AND DREAMS ABLAZE
SOULS UNDER FIRE POTENTIAL INCARCERATE

CANNOT MASK MY RESENT FOR THE DRONES THAT I DEPLORE SO DILUTED AND BLAND
FORCED AND PREDICTABLE SHORT LIVED AND DISPOSABLE ALL FADES AND TRENDS BE DAMNED
CONVICTION IS NOT JUST A WORD, STEADFAST I FIGHT ON UNDETERRED
SENT TO THE DEPTHS BY A FOOL AND A LIAR, EMERGED BREATHING FIRE
FOUR WALLS GETTING HIGHER HOPES AND DREAMS ABLAZE
SOULS UNDER FIRE POTENTIAL INCARCERATE

DEMORALISED, DESPAIR, FRUSTRATION, WORDS IâVE COME TO KNOW WELL.
BUT TO ME CONVICTION IS NOT JUST A WORD
NO EXCUSES, NO COMPROMISES, TILL DEATH BREATHING FIRE
FOUR WALLS GETTING HIGHER HOPES AND DREAMS ABLAZE
SOULS UNDER FIRE POTENTIAL INCARCERATE
