CANâT PINPOINT THE MOMENT RESENT, HATE, JEALOUSY,
SELF DISGUST RESHAPED MY OWN PERSONALITY

CONSISTENCY IN FAILURE, A BADGE I WORE WITH PRIDE
âCOS EVEN THOUGH I GOT NOWHERE AT LEAST IT MEANT I TRIED
BUT NOW IâM MORE PERCEPTIVE, A LITTLE LESS NAÃVE
REALISATION ALL I WON WERE PYRRHIC VICTORIES
THE MAN IâM FAST BECOMING, NOT ONE I WANNA BE
METAMORPHOSIS COMPLETE, IâM BETTER OFF DEAD

DEAD BETTER OFF DEAD

HOW MUCH LONGER WILL I SUFFER
BEFORE YOU RELEASE ME INTO THE COMFORT OF DEATH

ALIENATED, A LOSS OF CONFIDENCE
IMMERSE MYSELF IN DEPRESSIONS USELESS INDULGENCE
ALONE SELF MEDICATING TO DRAG ME FROM THIS HELL
NUMB ALL EXPECTATIONS CRAWL FURTHER INTO MY SHELL
BITTERNESS IN TORMENT, NO RELEASE AS I BLED
SO INGRAINED WITHIN ME THAT I'M BETTER OFF DEAD
