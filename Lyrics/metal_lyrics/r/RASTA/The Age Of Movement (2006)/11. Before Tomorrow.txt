It was the last sunset.
Long ugly shadows were crawling, crossing each other.
It was the first time when the world, tired of insane rush, became silent and quiet.
Everything live became quiet, inhaling the last drops of sunshine before the sunset.
And the life has stopped.
Awaiting the endless night.

Before tomorrow,
Before I die!

The clouds froze in the sky.
The wind stopped blowing.
The sea went speechless.
The surf became quiet.

A strange sign ghosted in the sky.
The last I see before I die.
No hope, no fear, no grief and sorrow
Before I die
Before tomorrow!
