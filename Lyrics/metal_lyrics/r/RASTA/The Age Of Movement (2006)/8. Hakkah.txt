A man had described hollow skies on the wall.
Starlight is bright and the shadows are long.
Than he bring down rusty glass full of blood.
And added picture with the signs of the god.

The tribe fell to knees. Forehead to the Earth.
Nobody knows ï¿½cause they watched it in first.
Mechanical hands put them up to the skies.
Shaman has betrayed all his words full of lies.

A tribute to sun and devotion were less.
Diamonds and gold aliens left in a mess.
Only the strong got to white blazing sphere,
It turned to flat and disappeared to nowhere.

Ages ago and we turning the past,
Trying to know what were there at the last.
This storyï¿½s goes on before some thousands years.
Sun on that wall rushing us to their fears.

Two zero twelve is the time to rebirth?
Knowledge and power are changing my Earth.
So they decided we fallow wrong way
And to come back us the basis again.

Heavens felt crushing steel and concrete.
Nobody knows of unexpected repeat.
Only the strongest rush to white blazing sphere,
Finished their age and disappeared nowhere!
