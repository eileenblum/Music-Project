Iï¿½m one of them who believe in the shine of stars.
I know that knowledge we have is not ours.
Breath of eternity lies not behind of us.
Now we are ready to feel the great power.

I realize how the words of the universe
Had been distorted with a man understanding.
Thoughts of the sun fills my head and I know whoï¿½s first
Manï¿½s equal god thousands years ago landing.

Call me and I rush my way falling lightning voice,
Turn me away from the rules we are under,
Show me the way I must go. But I have no choice,
Let me touch truth with the star storm expanding.

Rage obey me and I bring my soul into
the flame ablaze me. Terminate My strength are growing.
I reject my knowledge, I retreat my future,
Declarate new freedom with the reign of hope.
