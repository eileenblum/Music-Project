I have lost all passions,
I feel like in misery,
I will touch my name
And fallï¿½ into purity.
I know all of master.
I was one of followers.
Obey the disaster
Nowï¿½ be of my proud!

Iï¿½m burning!
Iï¿½m burning black!
Come with me,
Weï¿½ll never back!

Iï¿½ll break all illusions,
I know rules of universe,
I pray only one
And blowï¿½ into rebirth.
I go way of silence,
I fly to the emptiness.
Erase. All the time is
Lostï¿½

The day weï¿½ve never forget
When we rushed to the top
Through the time and eternity...

The day weï¿½ve never forget
When we fell through the grave
And became the infinity...
