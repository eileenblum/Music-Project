[by Infected Mushroom]

I wish to give, to take, to make, to check, I wanna see it happen.
I want to see, to be, the one that plays the game without no fears and regrets.
I want to know you, better than I know myself.
I want to feel the end, and to enjoy the consequence.

I'm playing the game.
The one that will take me to my end.
I'm waiting for the rain...
To wash who I am.

I want to move, to loose, to take the grooves, and to give it all back.
I want to take the time rewind, and to kick it right from the start.
To be unknown and all alone, lose the kind that are behind.
To start a new play by myself and to give the best I have.
