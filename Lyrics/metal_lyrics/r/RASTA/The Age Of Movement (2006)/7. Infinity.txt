I know the sun rise up at the East
And goes through the horizon.
I know the wind blows from the North.
The reality is infinity.

I know that rivers flow to the south
And turn to the ocean.
I know the night begins at the west.
The reality is infinity.

The sky will spill the rain.
The earth will turn raindrops into the dew.
The sun will raise it up.
And wind will drive the clouds away.

Iï¿½m
The light of the sun,
A gulp of the sea,
A blow of the wind.

Iï¿½m
A handful of soil,
A second of life,
A part of the time.

No one can be replaced in this world.
Nothing instead of itself.
Nobodyï¿½s able to break flow of life.
Never the circle will end.

Every momentï¿½s a part of the chain,
Particle of universe.
Everyoneï¿½s life is a part of us all.
THE AGE OF MOVEMENT goes on!
