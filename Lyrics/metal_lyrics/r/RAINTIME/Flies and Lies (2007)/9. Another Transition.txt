Looking out from my isolation
Deep inside from my alienation
The night will heal my morbid fascination
Another day has gone away

My disintegration, it's not just a sensation
But another accusation
After I've been bruised, lost and so confused
I practiced so much violation

Violation that was, always present because
I used to dream blindfold
All the people I've been, all the faces you've seen
Are not what I really am

Running away from another transition
After discovering new points of view
Getting away with another sensation
After discovering that I'm so true

Looking out from my isolation
Deep inside from my alienation
This day will kill my false illumination
Another day has gone away

I decide to light again my own fire
I gonna try to step away from the liars
I understood that I must have been crazy
To waste my time and be so lazy

Mirrors showing a new side of sorrowful revenge
Through the silence of who understands

I know it could be another transition of pain
I know it could be another injection in vein
I'll try not to be bothered by other insanes
I'll go much more further than your dead brains
