Once again I've breathed the fire
Awaking inside those feelings
That won't go!
I've sensed this before

Another weak and cruel desire
Bothering me and it won't leave me alone!
I won't pay this toll

I always felt that this could be
A good chance for me to see
If I could fit into a world
That moves

I fell so strange and so deranged
One other chance flew by
To solve my shit I only need a try
I am so stressed and so depressed
'Cause I keep hiding from
A thing that could be a new dawn

I gonna try to see if I
Can make up my mind and live this crazy show!
I will need it all
All the strength and will that I
Will gather from my trembling little soul!
I will need it all!
