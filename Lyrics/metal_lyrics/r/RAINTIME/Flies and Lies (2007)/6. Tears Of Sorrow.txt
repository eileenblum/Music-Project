Another drop falls from a flower
And it seems it could take an hour
(I'm) drowning I wish I can't breathe
I can't cope with this bleak sensation
I feel killed by anger and frustration
This won't be our last good-bye

Only now I realize how precious is the light
It's so cold without your smile

Hope will suffocate my pain again tomorrow
Though my lonely dreams you'll soon live again
Let my tears create a shadow on your sorrow
(I'll) always fell inside a never-ending stain

A blast of wind has blown out your candle
It's a pain that I couldn't handle
Tears are bursting out of my bleeding eyes
I can't cope with this situation
I am filled with anger and frustration
This can't be our last good-bye
Good-bye!!!

Don't wanna meet the other side
'til I get to find myself
Gonna say it one more time
I must live again!
