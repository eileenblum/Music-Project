Don't want your dirty eyes pointing on me!
Don't wanna see your face tricking me another time!
My life reached it's pinnacle
But your wet touch isn't my goal.
I fly to different skies,
I can't stand no more your lies!

Another stupid soul has fallen into my trick again!
Another pure soul will increase my reign!
I am the rain bringer, the ruler stronger than your god!
And you will drown forever lost!

It once seemed love...
But was all a lie!
Will someone else need a try?
I feel like a dove
So far away
But I forgotten all the rain!

Don't wanna touch your dirty hand
That write false words on the sand!
I am the wind that cleans 'em up!
I will blow until you'll drown in pain!
My life reached it's pinnacle
But your wet touch isn't my goal.
I fly to different skies,
I can't stand no more your lies!

I'll break the glass of pain that you
Make from kidnapped souls!
I'll run for my new life that you
Won't rule or destroy!
