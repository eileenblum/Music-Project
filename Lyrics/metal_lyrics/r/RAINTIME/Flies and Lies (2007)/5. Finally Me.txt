I can feel that thing again
It lurks down in my pain
Every morning it's the same
I can't stand no more

And I've walked and walked alone
Until the smile if who knows
How to put up with my jokes

All the tears that I kept
From falling down
Now I can
Let them shiver away
And leave aside the
Shame

There are stupid little things
Than no one understands
I can sense a new sunrise
That is framed by your eyes

And I walk and walk with you
Slightly embarrassed for my words
That I've never used before

I breathe those whispers that are Guiding me so above
I feel those shivers caressing me like the rain that falls
