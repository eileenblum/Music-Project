Sometimes I can't recognize
My own self defaced by this mask
That kills my image worn out
By the fake and by the mistake
At times I look in the eyes
Of those who want me as a prize!
They ask for another one!
It seems they don't understand!

Debating a frustrating life
I feel that something isn't right
They want another one!
They want to kill my pride!
They want another one!
They want to kill my pride!

Never surrounded by this wall of pride
But I'm living in it
Always avoided by this hall of fame
But it rolls around me

I see people like flies
Landing on shit: "What a surprise!"
They ask me if I wanna be fed
But I'd rather be dead
I've always recognized
That they've only lies
They ask for another one!
It seems they don't understand!
