Son
You say my life is full of shame
Unbalanced child in wasted roads
Please call me son I need you, mum!
Why didnÂ´t you dry my frightened tears!
Mum
I donÂ´t know how you can be here
You canÂ´t be true IÂ´ve burned your soul
I am the prophet of new world
IÂ´ve heard the devil through your voice!
Son
They showed me how you wiped out (my) life
Your hands were cold and full of sweat
You stripped my neck with no regret
My white eyes lit up the hole night!
Shut up, die!
The new fate will rule
Shut up, die!
Idyllic life for all
Curse your name!
I hate your presence
Curse your name!
Destroy all your words!
Son
Repent for all the rest of your life
But this should be not enought
I can forgive but not decide
The price of your mistake!
Mum
I will do things told by the arcane
To bring the spell to life
And so the heaven has been saved
This is reality!
Shut up, die!
The new fate will rule
Shut up, die!
Idyllic life for all
Curse your name!
I hate your presence
Curse your name!
Destroy all your words!
