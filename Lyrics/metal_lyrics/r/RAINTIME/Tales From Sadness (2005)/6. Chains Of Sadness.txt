Laying down in (the) dark cell
Crying bitter tears
Waiting for freedom
TimeÂ´s running out
Sleeping on this cold stone
Ice inside as well
I feel so faithless
GodÂ´s gonna away
Is this bunch of misery
Just all for me?
Should I survive to this hell?
Had pangs of hunger
Are stealing my nerve
Everything around me
Is mudding me up
Father IÂ´ll forgive you
For all your sad crimes
Should I survive to this hell?
Now, now that IÂ´m here
Will I prevail over this fear?
IÂ´m... IÂ´m digging my soul
Â´Cause IÂ´ve seen a sunrise or a sunset
As I was blind
TimeÂ´s running out
TimeÂ´s running out
IÂ´ll die again
IÂ´ll die again
