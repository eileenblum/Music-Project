Black sky trought my closed window
Cryptic sun light
I am waiting for this storm
Left me outside
Fear and tears are hitting my face
Dimming my view
Let them fall down with blind rage
Let me outside!
I still believe my fear will be afraid to
Drown in my soul, I still believe!
Drilling the sky, IÂ´ll use the light forever!
Shaking my head and scraching my thoughts
I will be a new me
Raping my pain and glowing again
IÂ´ll find the key in my pray!
Dancing free on the wet grass
Blinding sun-light
Clouds are rolling away now
Let me outside!
Drying myself IÂ´ll be lighter
Wind is my friend
I am waiting for (the) next storm
Fear is no more!
I still believe my fear will be afraid to
Drown in my soul, I still believe!
Drilling the sky, IÂ´ll use the light forever!
Shaking my head and scraching my thoughts
I will be a new me
Raping my pain and glowing again
IÂ´ll find the key in my pray!
