Howl of trees attracts the enemy
Dumb breathing seems so loud
Then leaves are quivering in the wind
They turn shadows into light
Cursed wood, you trap a lot of lifes
And mine is part of them
Jesus, bless me, IÂ´m afraid to die
Why do you live me alone?
Made up faces next to me
The smell of bloodÂ´s attracted them
You have to face with it!
The story doesnÂ´t change!
The human fault is here!
The justice seems so far!... So far!
All is fair in love in fuckÂ´n war
Remorse gives me no peace
Now I feel like a fearful child
Â´Cause steps are not so far
Land of struggle, land of suffering
YouÂ´re stripping my own faith
The fortunes of the country
Depend on our pride...
Depend on our pride!
I canÂ´t escape, itÂ´s too late
IÂ´m waiting for the sickle, noooo!
You have to face it!
The story doesnÂ´t change!
The human fault is here!
The justice seems so far!... So far!
Howl of trees attracts the enemy
Dumb breathing seems so loud
Then leaves are quivering in the wind
They turn shadows into light
