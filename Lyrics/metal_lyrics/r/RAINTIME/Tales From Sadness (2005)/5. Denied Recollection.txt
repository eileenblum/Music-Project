Inside the wild roar den
Trought twisted roots of black oak
The torn grass forms some long trails
He dragged a man into that gloomy hole
"Believe me! I donÂ´t know why!"
Sometimes he felt so strong
The memories are so weak
A danger steeped in unwittingness
The hell at night but he didnÂ´t know why
"Will my God forgive these crimes?"
IÂ´m afraid to survive
I just tried to live my life
I let you paint my end, good-bye
No replies and regrets
I deny my own other side
Define my final stage tonight!
He bears no grudge for that
He doesnÂ´t know the night
12 hours of light and then emptyness
He dragged a man into that gloomy hole
"Believe me! I donÂ´t know why!"
He lashed out at his pray
His real mindÂ´s covered by
A cruel instinct, he kills!
The hell at night but he didnÂ´t know why
"Will my God forgive these crimes?"
IÂ´m afraid to survive
I just tried to live my life
I let you paint my end, good-bye
No replies and regrets
I deny my own other side
Define my final stage tonight!
