Awaking in the morning late
Sunny day behond the glass
Shadows now are close to shapes
And even closer to myself
The shower seems to cry on me
Mirror spreads an unknown face
Mangry cat is whining on
The backyard looks like scary fog!
My bag is full of hate
IÂ´ve got it for too much time
No one knows whatÂ´s kept inside
And no more fear and lies!
Hate, fear and lies still burning inside
I must kill and I will not deny it
Â´Cause IÂ´m sick, deranged and terrorized
In my mind this murderÂ´s gloryfied!
The door stands out against my eyes
My secret aim on the other side
IÂ´ve got no key but thereÂ´s no lock
(Soon) You know IÂ´ll be within the room
My soul is ice, I rule my life
The devil seems to wait for me
Relentless hands gripping the gun
Now I can see the beast again
My bag is full of hate
IÂ´ve got it for too much time
No one knows whatÂ´s kept inside
And no more fear and lies!
Hate, fear and lies still burning inside
I must kill and I will not deny it
Â´Cause IÂ´m sick, deranged and terrorized
In my mind this murderÂ´s gloryfied!
