Nobody told you what happened in your past
Everyone hid you the truth
YouÂ´re not what you think to be, run away
I saw that, then I cried for you!
Leave the city and never think of revenge!
ItÂ´s what they want from you!
DonÂ´t turn your eyes and donÂ´t you stop for a breath
Â´Cause theyÂ´ll realize
Blood of lies inside your life
It pressed upon your brain
You didnÂ´t know what was the galf
You sometimes felt in mind!
Son of pride and devilÂ´s lies
Your beingÂ´s made up of limph
They pulled it out from their own hands
Sad angel with no God!
Silent fury inside me
Sense of guilt inside you
I must curse my low birth
I want to pray my God!
Hold your remorse!
Shed your load, then growl
Fail of respect!
Let your voice explode!
The 12th of May 1981
A white hand pointed to the crime
A crowded square applaused your pain
I saw that then I cried for you!
Like a child with every toy
TheyÂ´re tired of playing with you, youÂ´re old!
DonÂ´t turn your eyes and donÂ´t you stop for a breathe
Â´Cause they realize!
Blood of lies inside your life
It pressed upon your brain
You didnÂ´t know what was the galf
You sometimes felt in mind!
Son of pride and devilÂ´s lies
Your beingÂ´s made up of limph
They pulled it out from their own hands
Sad angel with no God!
Silent fury inside me
Sense of guilt inside you
I must curse my low birth
I want to pray your God!
Hold your remorse!
Shed your load, then growl
Fail of respect!
Let your voice explode!
