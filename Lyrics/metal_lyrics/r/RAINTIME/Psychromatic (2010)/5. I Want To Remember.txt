Thought to be alone, thought to be free
Thinking of nothing, I just spent all the days
In a dream where the problems don't exist,
Where the sun shines upon me.ÃÂ 

I wanted to catch him,
I followed his light.ÃÂ 
I had never seen the night
She was ready to show me the world I denied,
'Now I thank her!

I want to remember, the sweetest dream I lived
I want to remember, the greatest life I dreamed

Need to prove myself I can be a new me
Thinking of everything, I spend all the days with you,
And the problems so far away, and my spirit will help you

I'll show you the sunrise, I'll show you the life
I will never tell you lies.ÃÂ 
I'm ready to feel the world I denied,ÃÂ 
Now I thank you!

I want to remember, the sweetest dream I lived
I want to remember, the greatest life I dreamed

I want to remember the dream of my life,
I say sorry for all the pain that I felt
I hope you'll forgive me for the bad thoughts I had
I say sorry for all the tears I denied
I was scared! I was blind! I was young! thank you
