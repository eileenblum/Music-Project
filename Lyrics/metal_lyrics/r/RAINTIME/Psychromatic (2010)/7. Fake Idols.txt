Fake idols set the path where minds get lost,
All is faded, no one stands
A bunch of candles makes me see
The shades of a filthy masterpiece!

I lived for, I cried for
The eyes that now I want to blind
Is this shit I deserve? I hate you!
I'm gonna chase out your mistakes and I'll

...sail against the shame,
Heaving high all the courage that remains
Feel so scared, feel so raped
But I'll fight until the end

Sun is burning for nothing,
Spreading light just for stupid
Games you created to dominate
Clocks are ticking loud in the rooms
Giving me a chance to think that
There's no time to waste and I know!

I'll cry for, I'll live for
The eyes that now I want to rise
Is this shit I deserve? I hate you!
I'm gonna chase out your mistakes and I'll...

...sail against the shame,
Heaving high all the courage that remains
Feel so scared, feel so raped
But I'll fight until the end

Shredding my life is nothing, (remember the time)
Nothing besides. (you made it for pride)
Egging for time and laughing. (I won't be a slave)
You are not my kind!

...sail against the shame,
Heaving high all the courage that remains
Feel so scared, feel so raped
But I'll fight until the end
