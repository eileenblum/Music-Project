Blinded by fame
Golden chains
Brand new cars
It means girls
And hard-fought honour

Forsaken by lies only lies
Asking why
You denied
This way of living
I understood

Carry me back, carry me over
I have lost all the hopes in dreams
I need the key to open the old door
I wanna start all over again

Turned up and down
Glorified like a star
Then thrown away
Just for delight

Anger in veins
Gives my hate
A chance to come out again
The legend's fall

Shadows in my head
Hiding lights
And I'm starting
To think
I may lose all my dreams

Anger and pain
Finding place
In my new reality
I have lost all my dreams

Carry me back, carry me over
I have lost all the hopes in dreams
I need the key to open the old door
I wanna start all over again!

Turned up and down
Glorified like a star
Then thrown away
Just for delight

Anger in veins
Gives my hate
A chance to come out again
The legend's fall

And the cold comfort is that I am not the only one
Who's been forsaken by the lies

I've cried and tears will save the ones who understand their fault
Who's been forsaken by their eyes

Turned up and down
Glorified like a star
Then thrown away
Just for delight

Anger in veins
Gives my hate
A chance to come out again
The legend's fall

The legend's fall
