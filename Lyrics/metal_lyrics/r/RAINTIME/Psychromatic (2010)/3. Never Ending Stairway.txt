It's just a matter of time
Dark walls bear upon my mind
It's just the sound of my pride
That makes me feel so alive

I wake up with all my strength
And butterflies inside me
They're turning into black bugs
I let them go astray

Life shows me once again
The greatest sweeping sea of colours
Memories are carrying back
The silent whisper for the last time

That never ending stairway
Is calling me she must wait
It's just the sound of my pride
He's telling me I can fly

I spread my wings I take off
And butterflies around me
They're turning into white snow
I let them falling down

Life shows me once again
The greatest sweeping sea of colours
Memories are carrying back
The silent whisper for the last time

Ascending the sky
I see black clouds rolling by
They're dancing like me
The oceans like drops
I hear the colours calling my name
They're calling me there

I can close my tired wings
My heart will guide me till I'll be there

Life shows me once again
The greatest sweeping sea of colours
Memories are carrying back
The silent whisper for the last time
