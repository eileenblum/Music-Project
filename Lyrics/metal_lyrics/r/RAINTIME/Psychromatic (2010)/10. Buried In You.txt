Cradle of shame
Crawling out of your words,
Voice of cold winds inside me
Temple of love
Has just faded away and now the guardian's praying

Rip out my veins,
Kill what my eyes have seen,
Carry me away, keep my faith, bugs in my head
Getting crazy and
I'm gonna be buried in you!

Somehow, I'll bring you down
Till your blood starts to boil
In your veins
Someday, I'll be your pain
Till your eyes start to cry
For your sins

Daggers and axes
Slashing mud in my soul,
Voice of cold winds inside me.ÃÂ 
Temple of hate
Has just been built in me and now hadrian's scraping

Rip out my soul,
Kill what my heart has felt,
Carry me away, keep my faith.ÃÂ 
Dust in my hands
Tells me I've always dug
To escape from the walls of rage!

Somehow, I'll bring you down
till your blood starts to boil
In your veins
Someday, I'll be your pain
Till your eyes start to cry
For your sins

I'm gonna be buried in you!
I'm gonna be buried in you!
I'm gonna be buried in you!

Somehow, I'll bring you down
till your blood starts to boil
In your veins
Someday, I'll be your pain
Till your eyes start to cry
For your sins
