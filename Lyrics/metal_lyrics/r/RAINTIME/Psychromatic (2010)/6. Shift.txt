Trapped into the bowels of shadows, path is so long
And snags oversee my slow steps

They're ready to catch me
They're ready to wrap me
Feeling that sky
Stares at my eyes

Stars ran away cause they're afraid of my fear
They're waiting till I fall asleep
I'm walking alone and I don't know why
The only thing I can hear is my breath

It's easing in
And scaring me
Rain's falling down

The face is cold
The hands are pale
I'm dying down

There's only one firefly lighting my way
But she's faster than me
She hides with the stars
Maybe someone is calling me
But I pretend not to hear
And I dry my tears

I walk and I walk even without a guide
I understand it's time for me to stop
I raise my eyes and I fell I'm no more
Nobody can see me I changed myself

I'm that firefly
And I spread the light
Drops are my seas
And my breath is wind
Mother's making me free.. free!

I'm the nature
And she's part of me
I am no more

I'm the ground
And he's part of me
I live

I'm the sky
And he's part of me...
And I'll make the stars appear again
