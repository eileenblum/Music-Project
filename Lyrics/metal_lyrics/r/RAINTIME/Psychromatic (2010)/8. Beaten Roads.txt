(Are you ready to have some fun?)

You believe in what you see, is this friend or enemy?
Beaten roads, preacher of nothing
You believe in what you do, do you think I've beaten you?
Killing roads, I'm the agitator

Murdered people on tv, gossip, money and decease
Beaten roads, preacher of nothing,
Every time you feel ashamed or a god without a blame
Killing roads, I'm the agitator

Now that I come so close to you,
Do you feel scared, what can I do?
I am the one who shows you the truth,
So what the fuck are you thinking about?

Is this the fairy tales you know?
Is this the crap they've always told?
Standing on this road
Do you see what lies on the ground?
I see nothing on my way and this is my price to pay,
Dying on this road, do you see the ways that lies sound?

You begin to understand, am I friend or enemy?
Different roads, preacher of nothing
I believe in what you are, so you know what you can do
Killing lies, I'm the agitator

Every time I feel insane with burning blood inside my veins
Now I'm free, don't you see?

Is this the fairy tales you know?
Is this the crap they've always told?
Standing on this road
Do you see what lies on the ground?
I see nothing on my way and this is my price to pay,
Dying on this road, do you see the ways that lies sound?

Now that I come so close to you
Do you feel scared, what can I do?
I am the one wÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ shows you the truth,
so what the fuck are you thinking about?

Is this the fairy tales you know?
Is this the crap they've always told?
Standing on this road
Do you see what lies on the ground?
I see nothing on my way and this is my price to pay,
Dying on this road, do you see the ways that lies sound?

(Did you have fun?)
