Running fast, following nothing, it was the only thing i did
They wanted me to run
I just wanted to stop but your eyes were everywhere
Trying to find a hidden place and my heart was ready to explode
I was losing the real life. you fucked me up and I realized!

There's no reason to escapeÃÂ 
'Cause my ghost is standing here,
You are nothing but a mistake, leave me alone!

Follow my trails, follow my voice, try to knock me down!
I wont let you kill me!
Wipe off my name, wipe off my stare, forget my face now!
I wont let you find me!ÃÂ 

Beg for mercy and I'll forgive!
But I will never forget! take the blame for your disease!
But I will never forget! rape yourself for what you did!
And I'll be so close to you! but I will never forget!

There's no reason to escapeÃÂ 
'Cause my ghost is standing here,
You are nothing but a mistake, leave me alone!

You wanted me to run,
I've found the way to stop myself
Call my name and i'll show you the hell
You tried to fuck me up,
I've found the way to resurrect
I'm the only one who
Can decide if you live or die
You are nothing but a mistake,
Leave me alone!

There's no reason to escapeÃÂ 
'Cause my ghost is standing here,
You are nothing but a mistake, leave me alone!
