My pain is trapped into the lair within my soul,
Feel denied, betrayed by life and all, I don't know if it's my fault
My gain is to try to exorcise allusive calls,
Its absurd to fly if you don't know you'll die, this is my private war

I'll reach out for chances that I feel,
I'll follow only things that heal

Take me away, treat my bother
I don't want to live with fairy echoes I always devise
Show me the way, I feel addicted
To an image of a future where my words obey my will

My kind is answering to the crime of haughtiness
And the time to pay has the right to come, it's just what we deserve
Mankind can't find that inner layer of their soul,
It's absurd to cry when you know your lie, this is my psychic fall

I'll reach out for chances that I feel,
I'll follow only things that heal

Take me away, treat my bother
I don't want to live with fairy echoes I always devise
Show me the way, I feel addicted
To an image of a future where my words obey my will

One day I'll shiver afraid,
I'll walk through the shades of a sun that doesn't burn my new skin
I'll drift off with smile on my face, surrounded by grace,
I'll be safe!

Take me away, treat my bother
I don't want to live with fairy echoes I always devise
Show me the way, I feel addicted
To an image of a future where my words obey my will
