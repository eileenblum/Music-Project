Smell of smoke
Eyes start crying
I can not breath
Can't see
Fire everywhere
I run

Clouds refuse to open up
Birds are flying so high
I wanna be like them
Far away from here
Just looking through the screen
Pointing out a movie
In which I'm only one
Little useless walk on!
And I say stop!

Bombs and shoots bounce in my head
My hands shivering bad
Like trees
Raped by the storm
I see

A child standing there alone
Playing with bullets
Playing with stones
Asking for his mum
Praying for his dad
Bodies surrounds him
Red puppets for his eyes
Crosses are his swords
And I just wanna say stop!
I say stop!

White flags flop down along with me
Black crows will fight beneath the sky
Red leaves will dance along with me
And trees will cry

Sight losing the colors
But red is all around me
Wind raising the dust
And crosses spreading darkness
Waiting for an answer
Waiting for my freedom
Tears in my cold face
And remembrance coming back

I see a child standing there alone
Playing with bullets
Playing with stones
Asking for his mum
Praying for his dad
Bodies surrounds him
Red puppets for his eyes
Crosses are his swords
And I just wanna say stop!
I say stop!

White flags flop down along with me
Black crows will fight beneath the sky
Red leaves will dance along with me
And trees will cry

I'm the blood
And he's part of me
I live again

I'm the nature
And she's part of me
I am no more

Sight has lots the colors
But white is all around me
I have found the answer
And the freedom is near

Tears becoming lakes
And a remembrance coming back
I'll come to life once again..

White flags flop down along with me
Black crows will fight beneath the sky
Red leaves will dance along with me
And trees will cry
