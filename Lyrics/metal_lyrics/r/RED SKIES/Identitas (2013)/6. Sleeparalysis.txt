[Bonus Track]How can there be so many people awake and dreaming? (awake and dreaming)
How can this be?
How long has this been happening?

If the collective claim is that we are free
Why are my choices given to me?
Why are my choices given to me?

I carry my own weight
I will not allow corruption to overtake
To overtake

I do not follow conspiracy
I've adopted appropriate rationality
Rationality

It all started when I woke up
To find myself in shock, I thought:
"I'm twenty years too late
How can I be the change?"

I reside where I survive
But I am conditioned to have people by my side

I do not follow conspiracy
I've adopted appropriate rationality
Rationality

We've made ourselves enemies
Greed's breeding distrust in the streets
So many potential friends shot down at the hands of judgment
Judgment

I am in shock (I am in shock)
I am in fucking shock
I am in shock

When did this happen?
I'm twenty years too late
So much hesitation (so much hesitation)
How long will I wait? (I wait)
Twenty years too late
How long will I wait?
