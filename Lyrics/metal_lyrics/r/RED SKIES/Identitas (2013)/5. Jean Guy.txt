Your back against the wall
It can be hard to see
I know the choice ain't easy
So which one will it be?

We made the wasteland (we made the wasteland)
Distorting sight and sound
This ship's forever sinking, into the fucking ground
Every head we burn, and every bottle downed
This ship's forever sinking, into the fucking ground

I'd rather live like there's no tomorrow
I'll never sleep
How did I get here?
I only wanted to unwind
I'm feeling restless
I think I may have crossed the line

We made the wasteland (we made the wasteland)
Distorting sight and sound
This ship's forever sinking, into the fucking ground
Every head we burn, and every bottle downed
This ship's forever sinking, into the fucking ground

It was over (it was over)
Way too quickly (way too quickly)
We have gone too far this time (we've gone too far)
You will find me (you will find me)
On the pavement (on the pavement)
Where we have come to die

No more words, no excuses
We have come to die
No more words, no excuses
We have come to die
Your back against the wall

Your back against the wall
It can be hard to see
I know the choice ain't easy
So which one will it be?
