[feat. Fred Beaulieu of Beheading of a King]Burn away your ideals of purity
Run away, towards the inevitable abdication
And so, the end begins
Our time has come

We thought we could find the answer
To the questions that make us all wonder
Could this be
Could this be what we deserve?

Can this really be all that there is?
How can you expect me to accept this
When we are the ones held accountable?
When we are the ones on the pedestal
The ones on the pedestal

We sought some form of closure
Could this be what we deserve?

Can this really be all that there is?
How can you expect me to accept this
When we are the ones held accountable?
How can you expect me to simply accept this
When we are the ones held accountable?

As we rise up the tyranny falls
Burn your amendments and tear down your walls
We put ourselves up on the pedestal

The flaws of all, displayed upon the pedestal
The path we have chosen, will forever remain
The flaws of all, displayed upon the pedestal
The path we have chosen, will remain unspoken

And so the end begins
Our time has come
The end begins
The end begins
