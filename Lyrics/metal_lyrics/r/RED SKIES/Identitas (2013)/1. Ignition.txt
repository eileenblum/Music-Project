[Spoken intro:]
"The World is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real, because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round, and it has thrills and chills and is very brightly colored, and it's very loud. And it's fun, for a while.
Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they've begun to question, 'Is this real, or is this just a ride?', and other people have remembered, and they've come back to us and they say 'Hey, don't worry. Don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.' and we KILL THOSE PEOPLE."

I can feel myself (myself) being taken over
Presented as an escape from what is real
Deception (deception) snares even the best of us
I need to run, I need to get out of this skin

I need to run, I need to get out of this skin

And I will walk (and I will walk)
Beside myself again
Desperation makes itself at home

My last chance (my last chance)
Is only getting closer
If I could only count on you to break my fall

You may run (you may run)
And you may hide (you may hide)
We both know how scared scared you are inside
I can't even count how many times I've tried
To break down the walls that close in from behind

And I will walk (and I will walk)
Beside myself again
Desperation makes itself at home

My last chance (my last chance)
Is only getting closer
If I could only count on you to break my fall
Break my fall

Beyond safety and beyond reason
You're not the only one running for your life

I may run (I may run)
And I may hide (I may hide)
We both know how dead I am inside

I will never stop running

I need to run
I need to run
I need to get out
Out of this skin
I need to run
I need to get out, out of this skin
This isn't who I am
I need to run
I need to get out, out of this skin
This isn't who I am
This isn't who I am
Who I am
