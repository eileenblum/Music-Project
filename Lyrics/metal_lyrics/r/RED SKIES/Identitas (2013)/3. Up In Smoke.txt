Repercussions
Nothing we haven't seen before
Repetition
Tripping over the same stepping stones (the same stones)

Where is the light at the end of the tunnel?
It seems like we're slipping away from everything
That we know

I never pictured myself, standing here
Begging for reason, begging for clarity
In this moment, we will no longer be held down
By the weight of this dying world

We will no longer be held down

Which will it be, a place of salvation
Or a place of eternal rest ?
I'm losing my grip
I'm slipping away from reality

I never pictured myself, standing here
Begging for reason, begging for clarity
In this moment, we will no longer be held down
By the weight of this dying world

Which will it be, a place of salvation
Or a place of eternal rest?
I'm losing my grip, losing the fight
Walking towards the blinding light
Where is the light at the end of the tunnel now?

In this moment, we will no longer be held down
By the weight of our own...
Repercussions
It's nothing we haven't seen before
Repetition
Tripping over the same stepping stones

Up in smoke!
