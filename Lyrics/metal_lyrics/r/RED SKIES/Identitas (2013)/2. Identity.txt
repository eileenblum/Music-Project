With bated breath, I have waited for the day
That man shall earn his rightful place
That day has come, that place is here
You can live without the fear
One day you will disappear

For what it's worth
Make due of the time that you have left
You have left

These are deadly waters that we're treading
Unless you keep your head up
You're gonna drown

Pull me up
I've been holding on for so long
(Save me now) Save me now
I'm about to lose myself

With bated breath, I have waited for the day
That man shall earn his rightful place
That day has come, that place is here
You can live without the fear
One day you will disappear

You may not know where you're heading
But you can't stand around
Forever circling down

These are deadly waters that we're treading
Unless you keep your head up
You're gonna drown

Forever circling down

Pull me up
I've been holding on for so long
(Save me now) Save me now
I'm about to lose myself

For what it's worth
Make due of your time
You won't be by yourself
We're in this together
For what it's worth
Make due of your time
You won't be by yourself
We're in this together
No one will be left behind

Forever circling down
Forever circling down

For what it's worth
You cannot drown
