[Music and lyrics by Ademir]

I see in you depression
You are not from this world
I am so close to you
Feel it

All you see is darkness
Always in your mind
(if) you sleep and I'll be there
There's no way to escape

You wanna run but don't forget
I'll be everywhere
I am waiting for a chance
Just to take you
You belong to me

I am here to offer all my power
I have been waiting for this moment
See the future, walking by my side
You will be so stronger if you use
The evil's hand
Evil's hand

I have what you need
You call me, you want me
Shout! Your voice's a song to me
Go on

If you see a picture
It shows my face there
We have the same eyes
Demon's eyes
Cry...
