[Music and lyrics by Ademir]

Thinking about the world
Peace and love without war
But it depends on you
Can't you see your future is there?
Waiting for you

If you could change this place
What would you move at all?
No more regrets, just go
Feel the wind blows into your face
Believe in faith

You won't lose your mind
You'll take your soul
Hope! This is your time
You are not a fool

Unfair world
Where the children are hungry
Try not to cry
There's no justice at all but you
Scream for those days
That they used to make you be happy
Unfair world
Where the children are hungry

Use your free time to live
Picture the scene just here
Forget about mistakes
You're stronger than everyone
Weakness no more
