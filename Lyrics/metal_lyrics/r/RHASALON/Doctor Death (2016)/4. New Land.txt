[Music and lyrics by Ademir]

Look up! A new age has just begun
It's a dream, but it's not
I can feel, I'll understand

Ruins and the damage everywhere
We were warned, now it's time
To reflect about the past

What I could see, it was from hell
Landscapes of fire
Horror filmâ¦ around me

Let's decide what is fair
Take my soul, now I go
A new land, after the end

(lord) you came, I survived
Feel my heart
It's my time
I've decided, there's no return

Hurry up! If there isn't a future here
It's my fault, I don't know
Maybe yes or maybe no

This is the deadline of my life
Face the death, don't be afraid
You are like me, going anywhere

I feel pain in my heart
I can't stand it, visions from my mind
Are clear right now
