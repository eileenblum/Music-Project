[Music and lyrics by Ademir]

When he's got and saw that land
He could see how hard it'd be
The true friends helped him at first
They were brothers

Feeling hungry almost dead
Bad times, anger and starvation
To survive he should be strong
And face his life

He's got foes without a reason
He had been considered a coward
Wisely he's defeated them
He's got the empire
The family was his life
His heart was full of mercy
He believed in his soul
His mind was free of questions

Winner, he's the winner
Got the power through the weak,
He's the winner, winner
With no fear feeling proud,
He's the winner

He's been tested constantly
(he) had to prove his martial skills
An important disciple he's got
(he) took his legacy

(they thought) it should be easy to kill him
The revenge, he's been looking for
But his spirit got so clear
There's no blame

His new life has just begun
Fight! His honor, there's no price
People said that he was dead
But he has got the empire
