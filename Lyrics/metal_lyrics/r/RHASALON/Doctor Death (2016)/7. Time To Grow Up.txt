[Music greison, lyrics Leonardo]

Listen to me my friend
What have you done to your life?
It seems that you are proud and living a life that is full of joy

But look at you my pal
You are only a clownâ¦ you're so fool

You are like a puppet, they're pulling your strings in way that you cannot resist
You can't resist

Now here is the truth
You are so fool
There is no way
You must regret
Life is short
So pick up your best
What's done is done
Try to revert
You must be strong
Look far beyond
And make your stand
Learn to say no
They're not your friends
Don't be a fool
Don't try to be cool
It's time to grow up

Real life, it ain't so bad
Just work hard and do try your best
Celebrate along your friends and you will get the real taste of joy

But look at you my pal
You are only a clownâ¦ you're so fool

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Listen to me my friend
What have you done to your life?

Take a look at you my pal
You are only a clownâ¦ you're so fool

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
