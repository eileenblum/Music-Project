[Music and lyrics by Ademir]

I have fear and the night is coming
I don't want to sleep
I'm afraid
I call you just to stay next to me
Shake me if I can't wake from my dream

Tell me! When you want to go to bed
You predict something will happen
He will be there next to you
Kill me
I hear a noise from you
You wait for the chance
Just to attack me
Please go away from my life
Let me sleep

Why don't you appear to other men?
You are always around here
You frighten me when you come
I close my eyes
I want to flee

Nightmare! You transformed all my dreams
In a nightmare
It seems to be real
But it's nightmare
And I live in a terrible
Nightmare!
They're real!
All my dreams

See it! I can't accept this situation
I wish you were burning in hell
My world is too small for you
Please go!
I try to escape from you
You are so fast
And you almost caught me
I will not look at your face
I wake
