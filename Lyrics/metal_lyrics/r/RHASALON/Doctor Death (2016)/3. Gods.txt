[Music Ademir, lyrics Leonardo]

Watching the news is so weird
It's so nonsense that it makes me hate
And I rather love

Mankind is always so dumb and proud
Looking for something that is deep inside
Looking for a god

I'll kill you if you don't trust
My god is better than yours
Swallow my laws or you die
Only the poor will deserve
No one need this shit

There's no god without love
Intolerance becomes pain
You will find you are blind in the end

Killing in the name of your god
It's so stupid and so mean
It's so mean

Another prophet on every corner
Another child that was abused
You better run

Conflicts that last for ages and ages
You can't refuse it's a holy war
A holy shit

I'll kill you if you don't trust
My god is better than yours
Swallow my laws or you die
Only the poor will deserve
No one need this shit

There's no god without love
Intolerance becomes pain
You will find you are blind in the end
