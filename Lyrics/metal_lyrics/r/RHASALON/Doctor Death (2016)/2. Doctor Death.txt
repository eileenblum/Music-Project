[Music and lyrics by Ademir]

Dark nights at this camp again
They were just experiments, but who believes?
I don't care
I don't know
He gave me the chance to create something bad from the hell

Thousands of lives in my hand
You look at me and you're waiting my call
I fell your hate
You'll obey
Oh! Those I have chosen will be sent just to please my mind

I drive them to my room
You can shout
Hideous sounds for everywhere
It relieves my soul

I have tried to improve your flesh
Some parts I will have to chance
I just do it for the cure
Doctor death is my name

Hey! Doctor death is my name!

I think I'm in the right way
This world must be cleaned
I'll create a new race
And it wasâ¦ a request
I've followed the orders from a.h and I will not forget

I'm proud of those things I've done
You shake your body in front of me
But don't run... away don't try
You are so closeâ¦ to the barbwire
This is the last place you will see in your life
