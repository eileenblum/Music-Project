[Music and lyrics by Leonardo]

Ambition is burning
So deep inside
Life is so short
Open up your mind

Ideas are coming
No one to share
There is no return
Stand up and stare

No one has never
Supported your goals
No one to tell you
It's time to go

It's never too late
Never too late
To change your life
To change your fate

Inside your soul
The light is so bright
There is no excuses
So get up and fight

Take a look around
It's all so insane
They will be prepared
So make your stand
