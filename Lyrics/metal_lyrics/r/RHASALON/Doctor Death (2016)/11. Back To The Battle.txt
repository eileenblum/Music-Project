[Music and lyrics by Ademir]

I have just returned
From my last crusade
I have seen blood, it's enough
Now I am free (just free)

So I can stay
With my brothers again
I have been using my sword
Just for my lord (my lord)

I will live
Just to protect my folk
They have seen sadness, disgrace
I am the brave (the brave)
I will be always here
I won't go far beyond
I've got dreams and I will not regret
My lord! I will stay with you

But I had to change my mind
And my duty is to obey
To the battle I returned
I'm in hell

I am loyal, my lord

Dangerous land
I would see again
Suffering I know that I'll see
There's no return (return)

I lost my mind
And I became a dead man
They couldn't help me, oh no
This is the end (to me)

My last thought, it was staying with you
My children will be alone
I won't be there, with them

Don't cry cause I can't hear you
I'm not afraid, it's so quiet here

But one day
We will meet and we will stay
Together, forever, every dayâ¦
