[Music and lyrics by Ademir]

It's so impressive the meaning of life
Now I have a reason and I'm happy to live
God gave me a gift and I know
It was just to find my way

I was so unhappy, so down, with no fate
Now I have dreams and I need to go on
You have come to fill my life
Now I have to keep you safe

God's with you
And me too

So all those nights when you called me I gave you
All my love and my care

You are so pure, it's a sweet to my eyes
There is an angel inside your mind
Your smile, it shows me
How important is to live

God's with you
And me too

So all those nights when you called me I gave you
All my love and my care
