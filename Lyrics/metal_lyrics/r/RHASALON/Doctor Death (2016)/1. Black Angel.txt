[Music and Lyrics by Ademir]

I see darkness, this is my end
Here in my it is impossible to sleep
Every night you appear in front of me
You want to be my friend

You are watching, observing me
My body is aching, just a pain that I can feel
My time is coming, it's difficult to breathe
The bright light is near now

I see a shadow on the wall
But there is no face
You are waiting for me
You want my soul
I will die

You are not real
I know your name
The black angel
You came from hell

I need to know what do you want from me
If you show up I want you to disappear
Is it my life so important to you
Please just leave me alone

You know that soon I will stay with you
You can be good but this can be bad too
I hope one day I will be like you
I'll have the eternal life
