[Leonardo Visentainer â Greison Schlupp]

Speed is burning in my veins
Adrenaline that feeds my brain
It's just like I'm getting high
Sometimes you should give a try

Hit the gas, change the gear
The sound of metal it's all you hear
The burning tires scream out loud
Feel the chill that makes you proud

The speed of sound
The speed of light
There's no return
The road becomes your bride

Speed up on your metal gear
Hold on tight or face the fear
Listen up! It's the sound of death
Coming out like the devil's breath

The world's just like a racing track
You're driving like a maniac
Inch by inch, side by side
Keep your way, let 'em decide

The speed of sound
The speed of light
There's no return
The road becomes your bride

The sound of thunder in your ear
You know the storm is getting near
Flash and light (all) across the sky
I will laugh and you're gonna cry

Adrenaline that feeds my brain
Speed keeps burning in my veins
Sometimes you should give a try
You know I like, I'm getting high

The speed of sound
The speed of light
There's no return
The road becomes your bride

The speed of sound
The speed of light
There's no return
The road becomesâ¦
