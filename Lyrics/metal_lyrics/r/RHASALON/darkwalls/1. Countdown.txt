[Leonardo Visentainer â Greison Schlupp]

You live and you die
That's the way it is
There's no other way
To get out of this

To live is to die
Since you were born
It's a countdown
To your final day

People you know
People you love
They've left you behind
So live your life

It should be easier
Go on without them
There's always a new day
For you to try

It's so tough
It's so hard
Learning to pretend
Pretending you learned

They all are gone
All of a sudden
I wish I could see'em
I wish I could hold'em

What would I say?
If I could see them
One thing is for sure
I will meet them

You live and you die
That's the way it is
There's no other way
To get out of this

In fact to live is to die
Since you were born
It's a countdown
To meet them again

It's so tough
It's so hard
Learning to pretend
Pretending you learned
