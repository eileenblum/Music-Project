[Ellen S. Visentainer â Vinetou Ferreira]

Walls on the right
Walls on the left
Walls everywhere
Like a bird in a cage

When they set me free
I see no difference
Cause surrounded by walls
Cold and dark
And lifeless I am

Dark walls

The waters I pass through
Dark as oil they are
The sky has no birds
And no longer has life

When I return
To the ground in my thoughts
I see no difference
Only dark walls
Cold and lifeless
