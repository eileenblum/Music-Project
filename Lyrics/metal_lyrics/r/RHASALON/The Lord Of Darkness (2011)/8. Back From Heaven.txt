[Mauro - Ademir]

I had to go away
I had no more reasons to stay
My breath was so hard
My body didnât work anymore

How could Iâve known that Iâd made that big mistake?
How could Iâve known that you would die in that day?

He went so fast
Left me here with the past
In this empty world
Iâm trying so hard
Iâm just praying to the Lord
Bring me back that angel

Where are you now?
Iâm searching your light in the dark
Maybe if you come back from heaven
I will leave again
