[Leonardo â Vinetou]

He is coming back to his land again
After being a long time away
He fought great battles from North to South, East to West
In heat like or frozen cold in (the) highest hills

He won every battle and his enemies are death
Nobody knows if they are in heaven or hell
But one thing is for sure, they all did regret
To have met him

A brave face full of big deep scars
Hard arms like steel
His body and strength were forged
In a lifetime of war

Now he wants to rest his sword, his body and his soul
He has returned to take back the crown of his land

Now he wants to rest his sword, his body and his soul
Finally he has returned to be the king
Be the king of Middle-Earth
