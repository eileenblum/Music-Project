[Leonardo â Vinetou]

They will never understand
I need this to survive
Itâs in my blood
Itâs in my mind
Heavy Metal will never die

The metal gods still reign
Waves that come and go
Only the goods one remain
Heavy Metal will never die

Thatâs the power of metal

Listen to me, I followed my way
Follow me and see how it is
Prejudice, intolerance
Heavy Metal will never die
I'm not alone, we a crowd
Alone will be the false ones
They will burn in the hellâs fire
Heavy Metal will never die

Thatâs the power of metal
Thatâs the power of fucking metal
