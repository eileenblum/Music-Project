[Ademir]

I donât have fear of the pain
I know that Iâm not alone
The other side is dark
And very near of here

My spirit belongs to you
You wait for a long time for that
And now the time has arrived
To happen the sacrifice

I know that in my eyes
A strange fear exists
I'm seeking forces to face
This great dare

But I wonât flee and hide
Cause this moment has arrived
Itâs beginning the sacrifice

I want to offer my blood
And I will show no fear
Oh Lord you deserve the glory
Of having my life after death

My spirit belongs to you
You wait for a long time for that
And now the time has arrived
To happen the sacrifice

I know that in my eyes
A strange fear exists
I'm seeking forces to face
This great dare

But I wonât flee and hide
Cause this moment has arrived
Itâs beginning the sacrifice
