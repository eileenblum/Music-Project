[Ademir]

Youâve just got the map and were felling proud
It had showed to you the road to heaven
It was a great lie and you followed it
The map has made you got to a terrible hell

Escape from hell
Escape from hell now
(If) you believe in the force of God
Then start to fight

You need to repair your big mistake
You must be fast cause you are afraid
You are not alone, this place is full
Now the time is over so escape from there

Escape from hell
Escape from hell now
(If) you believe in the force of God
Then start to fight

He wants to possess your pure soul
The only salvation is out of there

Escape from hell
Escape from hell now
(If) you believe in the force of God
Then start to fight
