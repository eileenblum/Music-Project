[Ademir]

Iâve been screaming for help
Iâve seen a shadow in the sky
It seemed unreal and so strange
Something there was in my eyes

I think itâs the end
But not itâs the start
He promised the eternal life
I think itâs the end
But not itâs the start
He promised the eternal life

Burning in hell and leave my spirit
Look into my eyes, give me the peace
Burning in hell and leave my spirit
Look into my eyes, give me the peace
He was the Lord of Darkness

I walked the valley of demons
The Lord, He came at me
There were so many people in that place
They donât know what there will be

He wanted my soul
Iâve closed my eyes
I was so far from my God
He took my hand
And he told me
Leave this life then come with me

Burning in hell and leave my spirit
Look into my eyes, give me the peace
Burning in hell and leave my spirit
Look into my eyes, give me the peace
He was the Lord of Darkness
