[Leonardo â Vinetou]

Crossing the mist
Searching for the light
The only way out
Was the faith inside

The warrior had walked
The valley of death alone
Where demons fly
Just above his head

The evil lord
Prepared him a lethal trap
That winged unicorn
Was a demon of death

Like an eagle in the sky
He was flying so high
When the white unicorn
A black demon became

The sword of God
Then shone in the air
The black demon
Fell down to death

The King of the kings
Lit the right way
The warrior found out
All his faith

The valley was long
And the troubles remain
The sword of God
Was his last friend

He faced the fear
Like never before
His true inner faith
Guided him through that wat

Fighting with strength
He was the brave
Who had a kingdom
That had to be saved

He knew the journey
Was dangerous (but) he had to try
Cause he was the only one that could cross
The valleys where demons fly
