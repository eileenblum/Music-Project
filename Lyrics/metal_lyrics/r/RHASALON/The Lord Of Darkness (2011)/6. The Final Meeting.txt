[Leonardo]

A gun at my head
The sweat on my brow
Should I pull the trigger?
Just for a second my parents I see
My life passes before me

What have I done???

Once somebody told me
Thereâs a mystery between heaven and earth
The light or the darkness?
Will angels or demons guide me?

What have I done???

Itâs time to meet the lost brothers [2x]
Itâs time to meet the Lord
