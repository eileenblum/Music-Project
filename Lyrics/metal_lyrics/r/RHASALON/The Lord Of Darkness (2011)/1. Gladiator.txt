[Leonardo â Vinetou]

In a land of brave warriors
They learned how to fight
Fight for their country
Fight for their lives

There was a great man
He was the strongest one
Killing the enemies
Leading the troops

Strength and honor
Stay with me
Cause all the rest is dust and air

When the emperor died
His son took the power
(But) he was not like his father
He wasnât that right

General couldnât stand this
Then he dared the son
And he was banished
To desert to death

Strength and honor
Stay with me
Cause all the rest is dust and air

Then he became a gladiator
To survive this world
Defending his life
By killing his foes

Revenge is so sweet
If you have a reason
And they killed his wife
And they killed his son

He became a hero
They called him (The) Spanish
He was invincible
And the best one

The emperor had heard
About this man
He just wanted to know
Who was that manâ¦

And the son got surprised
In front of his eyes
The ghost of the man
That he thought was that

At last the vengeance
For the blood of his wife
For the blood of his son
Then the Elysium arrived

Strength and honor
Stay with me
Cause all the rest is dust and air
