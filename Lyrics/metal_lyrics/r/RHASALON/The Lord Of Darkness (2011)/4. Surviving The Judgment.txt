[Ademir - Vinetou]

I know that someday thereâll be an encounter
Where no more I will have this fear of death

Surviving the judgment I will ask God
The force and the power to have the eternal life

If in your eyes the fear exists
Donât waste your time and start to fight

Surviving this day
Stronger Iâll be
Surviving this day
Then freedom Iâll have

In the force of God who wanders this world
Just gonna survive who doesnât fear the great end

A light from the sky bringing the peace
It will be the end of judging who will go on
