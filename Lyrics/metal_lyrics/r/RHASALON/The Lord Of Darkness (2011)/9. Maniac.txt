[Leonardo]

He knows all your life
He knows what you like
He looks like a friend
You will never understand

Your children like him
Since from the beginning
A person so kind
Thatâd kill you from behind

Heâs spending his time
Just watching you
Alone in the shadows
Waiting a change
He wants to catch you
Heâs the incarnation of devil

He use all his tricks
Hiding his dirty past
Heâs pretending so well
Heâll be rotting in hell

A so perfect plan
That never would fail
A slaughter so cold
And a knife made of gold

Heâs spending his time
Just watching you
Alone in the shadows
Waiting a change
He wants to catch you
Heâs the incarnation of devil

Thirsty for blood
Hungry for flesh
A hammer in his hand
He wants a face to smash

Heâs spending his time
Just watching you
Alone in the shadows
Waiting a change
He wants to catch you
Heâs the incarnation of devil
Heâs the bringer of evil
