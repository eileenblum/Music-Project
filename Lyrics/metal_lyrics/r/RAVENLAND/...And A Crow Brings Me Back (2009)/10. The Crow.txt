[feat. Tommy Lindal]

[Music: AndrÃ© Cardoso and Dewindson, Lyrics: Dewindson]

In the dark cold night
Travels the crow
He fly is over the prairies
Scouting graveyards searching for desperate souls
Divides between the two worlds

The link between
Life and death
The crow will bring back your soul
Spreading his wings carrying the winds
Putting an end to your pain

In that dark cold night
The wind blows in your grave
The crow arrives tonight
To finish his mission

Poor desperate souls rest in peace
The crow will keep your gravestone forever.
