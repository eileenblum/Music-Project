[Music and Lyrics: Camilla Raven]

This cold night took me
to strange ways
Touched by the velvet dreams
that drink my eternal traces

I hear the song of the moon
A melodious voice that enchant sick minds
Untouched moon
And exuberant, virgin and sensual

Your empty womb did
Pour a blood rain
Rude tears I felt
Dropping on my skin

I lose myself in the dreams dance
Dance in the mist cover my eyes
Dance in the mist

I take a bouquet of flowers trod by the time
but I know the time will not let me to wither
