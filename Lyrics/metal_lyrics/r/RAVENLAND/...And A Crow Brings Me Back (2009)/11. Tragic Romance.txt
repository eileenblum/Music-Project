[Music and Lyrics: Camilla Raven]

This sad moonlight stained of rude, scenery painted in blood
I'll bleed forever for you, tell me why

I'm love with my sin, I call the past come to me, beauty come with tragedy
and my pure heart bleeds, everyday caged in darkness.

I gave you all my life, my love tell me
what have you made in my mind? My darling, I believe

I gave you and you took it all (my love)
Tell me why

At start you caged me with your look
And I'll always remember your eyes, I'll never forget it
When you looked me as if you were seeing a god
And I'm alone now
I loved you
