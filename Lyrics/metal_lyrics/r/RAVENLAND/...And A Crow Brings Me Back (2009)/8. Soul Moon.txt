[Music and Lyrics: Camilla Raven]

Song of my soul runs
to infinity
And calls you
Perfect symphony
To the celestial Holocaust
You are an end lover as me

SoulMoon took the reason
The moon took the reason from me

Unvirging the sacred beauty
Nocturnal

That covers us as a mother covering her son
The breeze of my frozen breath cuts the cloths
which cover you for your revelation

Your body moulded by hands undescribed
In your exuberance
Letting Gods and Mortals into madness
Conciliating the divinities precedent from the waters
The mistress of the past

The moon was lost
But she is the witch of the night
Last night she bleeded
Now she's back for more

But I'm sorry
I betray the witch inside me

And she still burns
I got my reason back

Fall asleep in the eternity
Nude moon with its eternal virginity
