[Music: Dewindson and AndrÃ© Cardoso, Lyrics: Dewindson]

Come on...cross the prairies
Come on...have no fear of cold wind
Come on...have no fear of night birds
Come on...have no fear of darkness

I'm waiting for you, I fell you step by step
Open the gates, have no fear of barks
They're my wolves to bark at the mother moon
They will guide you to me

The moon is wonderful tonight
The animals insane out there
Feel something evil

Just few more steps and we will be together
Your smell makes me so...
Your skin so white hides your warm blood

The moon is wonderful tonight
The animals insane out there
Feel something evil

Pour Evelyn! Why did she walk alone?
So late night so close of haunted prairies?
Pour Evelyn, why did you walk alone?
