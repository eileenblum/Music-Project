[Music and Lyrics: Camilla Raven]

Through the night I feel you
I hear your distant call
I hear your voice within me
We are one

Tragedy beats in the night
Sound of your voice protect me
Cry for me, my madman

Fell my ecstasy

Can't you hear my scream? I'm burning
Can't you hear my scream? I'm burning for you

My blood tears write these words
Feel me in silence
I'm waiting for you
I'll find you again, my shadow

And if I touch you
Together our souls will be as one
Come to me, my raven

My madness is you

Burn me what burns on you...
