[Music: Alexandre Brito and Dewindson, Lyrics: Dewindson]

Blood shed under ground, chains imprison the though
Somebody dreaming while beaming
The light penetrate in the glass but this is not wine
Hades keeps your perforate your hands
Opaque visions, angels sing somewhere in this marsh
The Thorns will rise again

Don't Know, the night will fall, soon roses will wither
The last down, this will be the last sunset
this is the last sunset

The poison is black and essence is stronger
Is to late, forget the thorns of pain
The wish fade away, everything is at your place and time
All fight was in vain
And the bell tolls again and the sun hides behind the mountain
Now is your time
