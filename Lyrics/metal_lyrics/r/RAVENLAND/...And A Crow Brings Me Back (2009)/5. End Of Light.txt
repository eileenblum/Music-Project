[Music and Lyrics: Dewindson]

I feel the darkness come in
Like the black wings of a raven flying
And that little girl with her violin
Began to play and took away the pain

All lights can be turned off
But in the end there always be one left
And that same autumn that I found it
The Ravens take my cold heart to Hades

End of light, say good bye
Say no more to pain
Do you want to live forever?

Her voice enchanted the Wolf's heart
Can bleed forever if the spell goes off
When passion takes over the mind
One more feelings is buried alive

I hear the song of my fate
What's written nobody change
I followed that sound through the night
Till I found the beauty in the end of light

A Goth wedding in a cathedral of sin
Dressed in black tonight
By tonight and all forever
