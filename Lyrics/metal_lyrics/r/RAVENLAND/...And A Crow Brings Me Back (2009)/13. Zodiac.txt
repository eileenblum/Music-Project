[Music: Albanes GonÃ§alves, Lyrics: Dewindson Wolfheart / JoÃ£o Cruz / Camilla Raven]

Welcome to new dimension
No walls no fences
A frightened darkness
Deprive your senses
Forsaken souls
Compelled by faith
To join the game of Love and Hate

I'll never understand why people so different
Can love each other so much and hate to hurt themselves

For thousand years in a blink of an eye
They were kept apart that need to die Welcome
Forsaken souls to new dimension
Compelled by faith No walls No fences
To join the game A frightened darkness
of love and hate

Sorrow fills the void

âI'll never forget the sadness in your eyes
When you looked at me and heard what you don't deserve
You always dry my tears
I'm sorry...I'm so sorry
You just want to help me...help my mind...
I love you so much
And where here together to explain the conspiracy of the signs...â
