[Music: Albanes GonÃ§alves, Lyrics: Dewindson Wolfheart]

My voice still echoes
Cause I feel this pain
This place is strange and cold
People don't see it
Lyrics and sounds guide me
And may provide this straight I feel you
A simple melody that I'll never forget would be in my dreams

Alone I miss your embrace and company
All moments that we lived together as one
Your smile and voice are here inside my head
I can't touch you right now someday I'll be with you

...and I'm here again
I feel your presence and light
...and I'm here again
I hear you far away
Maybe someday I'll meet you again
I'm waiting for...
And this time our souls will be as one

Now I know
The reason I'm still here

Love and hate
Keeps me a prisoner

I know and I believe
In an another life we'll meet
Together, we will be
And I'll have your love again

And together till the end of time

One day, we should meet again
