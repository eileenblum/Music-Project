Nothing you can tell me is going to make me change my mind.
Itâs only that your foolishness is so unkind.
Your fingers point, oh, at everyone, iâm left wondering
Who you think you are, who do you think you are?

Give yourself a reason,
Take a good look at yourself.
Give yourself a reason,
And put the blame on someone else.

If you could just take the time,
We could do something better.
If you could sit right down,
We could do it well.
You watch as all the fools rush in,
They donât know but i know
Where youâve been, here it comes again.

Give yourself a reason,
Take a good look at yourself.
Give yourself a reason,
And put the blame on someone else.

Tonight you are leaving, finally you are on your own.
Itâs time to pay for all the bullets by your gun.
I stand and watch the ship go down, moving from the shore,
I will stand my ground, i still stand my ground.

Give yourself a reason, take a good look at yourself.
Give yourself a reason, and put the blame on someone else.
