You step out on the streets and you donât know where you are,
The land of milk and honey is million miles form here.

Here they come, here they go,
You might think theyâre crazy.
Think theyâre crazy.

Working every night and day just struggling to survive,
Drinking now in overtime, youâre more dead than alive.

One more day, one more shot.
Thatâs is brother, thatâs your lot,
Itâs just so crazy...

Look at all the faces of the people that you see,
Donât you steal their problems girl and lay it all on me.
Youâre crying like a school child and i donât want to know,

I donât want you, i donât need you, i just think youâre crazy.

Oh youâre driving me, out of my mind, come on baby,
Letâs have some fun tonight.
