Now you think that everything is going wrong,
Now youâre feeling different from most everyone,
Well you know, thatâs doesnât sound so strange.
Forget about the bullshit that they lay on you,
Hereâs some free advice iâll tell you what to do,
Just turn, smile and walk away.

They turn the radio on and they turn it way up loud,
When you hear the sound of big guitars,
You know itâs rock and roll.

Donât look so surprised i got a story to tell,
Baby i was once like you, i know it well,
So i know just how the story ends.
Getting down and dirty on the weekends here,
You know you want to dance and sing i hear
And the rest of the week donât mean a thing.

You just turn the music on and then turn it way up loud,
When you hear the sound of big guitars,
You know itâs rock and roll.

Do you feel it? do you need it? do you want it?
Do you bleed it? itâs rock and roll...
