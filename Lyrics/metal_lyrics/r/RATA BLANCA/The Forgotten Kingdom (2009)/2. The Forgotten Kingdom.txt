When men are lost in the depth of their dark,
The old ones return whit a powerful song.
Their sorrow will curse the earth, destroy the sea and sky,
Peace for mankind will crumble to hate and pain.

Look to you heart, look to your soul,
Then your spirit can carry you on.
Temples of life, towers of steel,
Forgotten kingdoms are waiting for you.
Never look back, never look down,
There is so much thatâs there to be found,
Forgotten kingdoms waits.
You may be a rich man, a beggar, a thief,
But i see the wounds that bring you to your knees.
Oh, the teardrops will fall away,
Flow to the heart of men,
All that has been will return again.

Look to you heart, look to your soul,
Then your spirit can carry you on.
Temples of life, towers of steel,
Forgotten kingdoms are waiting for you.
Never look back, never look down,
There is so much thatâs there to be found,
Forgotten kingdoms waits.
