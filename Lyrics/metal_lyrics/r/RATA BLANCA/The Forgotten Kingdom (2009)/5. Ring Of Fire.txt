This canât be real, the stars are going out,
The moon has gone, as darkness closes in.
I hear the sound that old familiar sound
That terrifies the heart of every child.
Lord give me strength the voices in my head,
The words from the old prayer are screaming.

We must turn and waste the night,
Call upon the sacred ring of fire,
We see there is not release,
Here in lies your lonely destiny.

Tell me can you see the message
From the shadows lights the way
Whit words that canât be heard.
But in the end even as the darkness
Closes in the smallest star can burn so bright.
As i reach out to kiss the burning sky,
The hate in my heart is growing stronger.

We must turn and waste the night,
Call upon the sacred ring of fire,
We see there is not release,
Here in lies your lonely destiny.

Lord give me strength this voices in my head,
The words from the old prayer are screaming.

We must turn and waste the night,
Call upon the sacred ring of fire,
We see there is not release,
Here in lies your lonely destiny.
