You watch as time steals another day from you now,
Another day passing by and then itâs gone.
Another day and you get nothing done,
Who can save you form your broken heart?
Crying out someone come and save my world.

Well the tears fall like rain,
A distant memory haunts me.
A fading and distant memory, oh no,
What can i do to bring her home to me?

On the streets where we walked till the day was over,
So many there that have lost their faith in love.
No more laughter jus so many tears,
Wash away all of the bitter years,
Who will save you if you canât save yourself?
