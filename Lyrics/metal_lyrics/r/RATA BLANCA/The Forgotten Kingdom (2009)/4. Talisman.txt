When I was just a lost fallen angel
A prisoner of mad broken dreams
Till I saw you there on these streets looking at me
I know because destiny wanted
To find you and gaze in your eyes
I dont know how I go on if you were gone

Girl Im just thankful that I found your lovin
Im so grateful that you healed my wounds
One look in your eyes, you are my talisman.

If the end of our life seems like dreamin
I just know that I want to wake up here next to you
One last time, one last day

Oh let me tell you when I was younger
I could not believe that in love
Could have all the answers to my questions
We dont know if you can be trusted
When I get let down in the end
Im so glad that I have you when the world gets too rough

Girl Im just thankful that I found your lovin
Im so grateful that you healed my wounds
One look in your eyes, you are my talisman.
If the end of our life seems like dreamin
I just know that I want to wake up here next to you
One last time, one last day.

Im so thankful that I found your lovin
Im so grateful that you healed my wounds
One look in your eyes, you are my talisman.
If the end of our life seems like dreamin
I just know that I want to wake up here next to you
One last time, one last day [2x]

Listen girl,
You are my talisman
Reach out.
