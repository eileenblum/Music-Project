Are you racing through your lives?
Do you live for rock and roll?
We donât care what people think, we love the night.
No illusion just the power,
I hear everybody scream,
As the dance upon the dreams that
They were always meant to find.

Can you feel it? can you heart it?
Itâs a word you canât forget.
Feel the changes, let them touch you,
Let the music take control.
Rock and roll, rock and roll...

Youâre not able to disguise,
If youâre faithful to the cause,
You can feel the passion deep down in your soul.
When you hear that raging sound,
Feel the power and the truth,
Tear away the chains that made to hold you down, down, down.

All believers in our doubt,
Trying to rip through inside lies,
But hereâs something theyâll never understand.
Though the message sometimes changes,
Still the passion will remain,
Weâll by here long after all of them are gone.

Nothing killed it, nothing changed it,
Thereâs feeling here in raw.
Can you feel it? can you heart it?
Maybe now youâre standing tall.
Rock and roll, rock and roll,
Rock and roll, all rock and roll...
