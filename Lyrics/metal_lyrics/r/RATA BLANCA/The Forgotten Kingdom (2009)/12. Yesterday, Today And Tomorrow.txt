Where will you go to when the show is done?
Will you walk until the morning sun?
Everything is going to be all right,
But isnât it strange how today feels live tomorrow, yes it does.

Will you haunt the same old tired bars?
Another night singing the same old song?
Even the woman who shares your empty bed,
Canât show you today if you are holding on for yesterday,
Listen to me.

In a dark and smoky room,
Iâll have a drink and tell you many secrets.
While my friends, they wait for me,
At the bar with no solutions,
Solutions to nothing at all.

Where will you go to when the show is done?
Will you walk until the sun comes up?
I know that everything is going to be all right,
But isnât it strange how today feels like tomorrow.
Iâll meet you at the bar of no solutions,
Thatâs where iâll be hanging out.
