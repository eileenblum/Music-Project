Can you hear us? calling from the far off edge of time.
Now we haunt you, watch your cities crumble, then you die.
When your last child is powerless, then our work here is done,
So without hope the heartâs revealed.

We are the guardians, the guardians of light,
Our spirits are waiting on mountains high.
We are the guardians, the guardians of light,
Our spirits are waiting on mountains high.

Soul destroyers, smell the fear thatâs in the hearts of men.
Greed, corruption, now we come to bring you end of days.
This is noting like destiny, this is nothing like fate,
So without hope the heartâs revealed.

We are the guardians, the guardians of light,
Our spirits are waiting on mountains high.
We are the guardians, the guardians of light,
Our spirits are waiting on mountains high.

When your last child is powerless,
Then our work here is done,
So without hope the heartâs revealed.

We are the guardians, the guardians of light,
Our spirits are waiting on mountains high.
We are the guardians, the guardians of light,
Our spirits are waiting on mountains high.
