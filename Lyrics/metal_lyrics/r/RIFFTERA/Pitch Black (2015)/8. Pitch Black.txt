Through the darkness
I learned how to dream
Through the stone
I learned how to bleed
I am an empty shell
Born and raised in living hell
I'm pitch black on the inside

Black rain soaks the ground
Paints the world with death
And sound of a heartbeat fades away
From day to day
I try to cover my footsteps
Leave the past behind
All my life I was turning a blind eye
And now I've lost my sight

How all the dreams seem now so bittersweet
They were buried alive

I would give everything that I hold within for a touch of lost colors
I'm on my knees and the whole world weeps with me
Long gone are memories
All those melodies are starting to fade
No place to run
Under the pitch black sun

Through the pain
I learned how to fear
Slave of the scars
Through all these years
I turned my skin upside down
Spilled my guts all around
I'm pitch black on the inside

Hate - all this hate that I gathered
Mind over matter
I curse you and I curse myself
All the guilty and the innocent
Each day I'm stronger
But each day the weight on my shoulders grows
And I know nothing lasts forever
