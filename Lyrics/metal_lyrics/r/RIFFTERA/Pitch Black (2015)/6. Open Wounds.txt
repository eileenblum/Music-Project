With our own blood we built
The hollow system that enslaves our brothers
Now as the blood runs out
We deny the truth while they
Rape our mother earth
Watch her burn
Our mother

Earth quakes
Earth burns
As the infrastructure gets torn to pieces
Treacherous words spoken by mouths of them
That spread diseases
The sickness spreads
Trail of blood runs

Now - as the society convulses and you poor the salt
Into to the open wounds
Right into the open wounds
Now - you hear the death battle
But you trust that the devil in a suit tells you the truth
The one that you choose

Harder and harder
Each day it gets farther away
We've lost the grip
It's slipping away

The fallen ones repeat the words
Sit tight come hell or high water
As the house of cards collapses
Twisted travesty ends in slaughter

Now - the time is running out while you play dead
And come up with 99 reasons why the sun orbits the earth
You never learn
Now - as the society has deceased
You still poor the salt into the open wounds
Right into the open wounds
