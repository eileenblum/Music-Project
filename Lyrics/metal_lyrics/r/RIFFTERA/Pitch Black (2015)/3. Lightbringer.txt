Each and every day of your life
The same old feeling comes alive
This is it again
This is for the past
This is the one that slips through your grasp
You would tear off the wings of an angel to keep it close
But you would still feel alone

It slips away through your fingers
Throws you down into the void

So it seems that you never learn
To the point of no return
You search for flaws
You search for something
You search for reason
And then there's nothing
You would tear off the heart of an angel to feel the warm
But you would still be in cold

And the pain remains to walk with you forever
In the dark
It hurts your

Eyes - to see the light for the first time of your life
But it's just passing by
Soon it will fade to the night
It hurts your eyes - to see the light for the last time of
Your life
So crawl back to your hide
And let the black arrive

So it seems you never meant to be
You never meant to feel
Farewell to lightbringer
Hope you enjoyed the time
Now it's too late to cry

You lose the battle without a fight
Giving up - too tired to try
Oh, the beautiful light
It hurts your
