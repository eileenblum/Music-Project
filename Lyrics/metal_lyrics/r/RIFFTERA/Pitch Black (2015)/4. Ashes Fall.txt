The weight crushes me
Thousands above
Thousands below
Weak mind repeats
Cant wash away the blood stains

The one true hero
Self-loathing
Shattered soul
Born again below
How it came to this?

The condemned speaks when words help no more
The first one to know the end of it all

So dry your tears my love
With the fire that burns my souls
Float away with the wind
When ashes fall
I let you go

Can't find forgiveness
Lost to the ages of unknown
Once proudly blessed
Now desolated

The fire burns my soul
With the wind I let you go
