Hunger never ending painfully blurs the mind
Drives us into the corner
Far beyond the line
Strangers in the reflection stare back at us
Dead eyes observe herd of the blind

Jigsaw to resolve everything we try
With unrelenting power we make it right
In the search of perfection it's all or nothing
Chains of madness us together binds

One step closer of the peak we are
One step closer
We've come so far
It seems so beautiful as we reach for the stars

One step closer of
The edge we are
One step closer
We've come so far
And then we realise we weren't close after all

One step closer of the edge we are
