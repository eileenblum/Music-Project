Do you still believe in miracles?
Do you still believe that justice
Prevails?
Wake up!
Do you still believe in fairy tales?
No one was innocent
No one can say that they did what they could
They were all just looking the other way

We should've seen it coming
We should've feared the worst
We were brought down burning
Now dust covers the halls of broken dreams

The ruins of the empire

You can't deceive yourself that much
You can't be naive enough to believe that we achieved anything
No one paid attention
Now no one dares to mention:"we should have known"
They were all just looking the other way

Our empire turned to ashes
Our empire turned to dust
Our empire turned to ashes
And dust covers the halls of broken dreams
