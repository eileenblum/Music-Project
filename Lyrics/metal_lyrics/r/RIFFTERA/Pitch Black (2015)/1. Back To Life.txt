Scream inside my head goes unnoticed
But don't you tread on my rights
Despite the lack of vital signs
Dark - too dark to see all around me
They know I'm lost but not alone
Straying in the deep unknown

Is there anyone to save me from what I've become?
And then the silence... silence seems so loud

To fight another day
They say:"wait for the sign - don't worry"
Red swallows the sky
Voice drifting away
In the end
I give all for the glory
Bring me back to life

Beast under your bed breaks the silence
Now who do you pray when
Things go wrong?
When there's a devil at your door
Hard - too hard
To breath - empty infinity
There is no escape
No place to hide
No one
Fighting on your side

Hear me begging for
See me crawling for
And then the silence...
Silence seems so loud

No one hears me
No one sees me
And then the silence... seems so loud
