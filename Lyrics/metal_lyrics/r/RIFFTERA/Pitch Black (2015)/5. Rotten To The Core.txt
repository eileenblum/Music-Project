How would this time be any different?
Haven't we learned before?
How would this one make any difference?
You know one
You know 'em all
Trust when I say they can't be trusted
Same plot repeats time
After time
Image of dreams will start to wither
Word after word
Lie after lie

One hand points to peace
While the other one strangles

Each of them promising the moon and the stars
Telling they're the one
One by one these words are forgotten
And their hearts are rotten to the core

For how long are you gonna keep on pretending
That it doesn't matter?
Just how far does it have to go until heads will roll?
Eventually we reach the breaking point
And one falls
Another one rises

Each of them promising the moon and the stars
Telling they're the one
One by one these words are forgotten and their hearts they're
Rotten to the core
Watch their hearts rot away

I tell you what: they're all rotten to the core
