Immortal life, internal damnation
Rise and reclain you soul
I am your saviour, worship me or doe
Feel immortality, rise
Born in torment, mortal suicide
life of Hell, pray to die
Total darkness, human terror,
Cry of evil, lies
Violent nature, life shattered,
Body changing, fall of time,
Pressure sorrow, mind is aftered,
Mortal suicide, pure be damned
Torrid life, eternal damnation
Rise and reclaim your soul
Born in torment, mortal suicide
Life of Hell, denied
Totel darkness, human terror
Cry of evil, pure be damned
The world is dead, cities die
Feel the fear, through the hands
Of time
Human terror
