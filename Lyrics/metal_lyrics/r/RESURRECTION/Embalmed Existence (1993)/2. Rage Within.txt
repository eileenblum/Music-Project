I rest in my home, eating human waste
and drinking the yearn of my dog.
I feel insane when i do this, but I like it!


I defy indecision
I'll deny your religion
Changing form, incantation
Rage within, mutilation
Return to Hell
Lies in the mind
Crimes of manjind
Denial freed from sin
Rejoice within
Lives pass through time
You lose your mind
Rotting out
Return to Hell
