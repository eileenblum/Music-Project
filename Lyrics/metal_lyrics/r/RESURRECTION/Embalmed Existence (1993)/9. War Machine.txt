[Originally performed by Kiss]


Some came Satan's prositute.
Raping themselves raping daily by doing his bidding.


Wanna bite the hand that feeds me, wanna turn the tides
Set the demons free and watch 'em fly
Strike down the one who leads me, I'm gonna take his place
Gonna vindicate the human race

Better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine
Better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine

Take the reins of power and seize them, draw the battle lines
Armageddon's just a matter of time
Tear down the voice of reason, let the arrows fly
Your freedom's just a state of mind, yeah

Better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine
You better watch out 'cause I'm a war machine


Kill the children
Save the children
We are all children

What is there to do
Money can buy death for pleasure

What did you want to do?
