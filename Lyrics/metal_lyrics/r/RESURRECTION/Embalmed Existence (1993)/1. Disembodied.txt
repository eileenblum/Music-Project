In the beginning of time, there was darkness.
While I lay resting in my mothers womb, I soon became apart of the light world.
Young in body, evil at heart. With little of around, I've became aware of death.
I should have been executed early in life for the crimes my mind commits daily.


Minds die
Dreams denied
Religion's disembody
No way out
Your dreams immortalized
Seal your fate with me
Pray for death
It's time to die
My eyes burn in fear
So cold
What am I doing heree
Is this a dream or will insanity try to destroy my mind?
They drain my life
They yearn for my knowledge
Now it's my turn to die
Minds die
Dreams denied
Freaks sirvive
Religion's disembody
