How can I survive!
Evil speaks to me every waking day!
Realising the monster that I've grown.
I summongly promise to leave evil alone!


Torture chamber, test your wil to live
Die by nature, this time you must give
Take my hand, feel my pain
Torchure chamber, kils again
Your empty soul, fate of time
Torture chamber will survive
Your time has come, you wait for the dawn
You've sealed your fate, defied by human face
Torment, the cry of death
You stand alone, there's nothing left
Your world, is torn apart
Your sordid luife reaches out
Sorrow deastroy the mind
Mourn the sins, feel the cries
Denial, immortal sin
Your mortal heart, explodes within
