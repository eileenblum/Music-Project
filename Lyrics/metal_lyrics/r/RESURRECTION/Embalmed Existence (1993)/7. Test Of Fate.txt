I watch the decaned bodies in minds of the old die slowly.
And i wonder what evil did they inflict on others they once knew.


Black as coal your heart
Dies and rips apart
Kill yourself, your mind
All in vain, mankind
Die, rise, shatter.
Existence denied, test of fate
Take my life, I'd rather die
To live again, free from sin
Stick a knife into my heart
Sacrifice, my new life starts
Burden of evil - lies within the mind
Sorrow, a test of fate
