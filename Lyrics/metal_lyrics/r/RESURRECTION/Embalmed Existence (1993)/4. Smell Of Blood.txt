Some of us become surgeons
and cut flesh to heal the human carcass back to life.


God stands before me
Thorns crown his head
Sinners have witness
Profit will soon to be dead
Crying out god's abandoned son
Stands alone to miss the rising sun
Son of god dies without sins
Reach out, lost call for Hell
Torn flesh see your lord now
Satan yearns the smell of blood
Blood, blood fills the ground
God dies, Satan rules the land
Sinner yearns the smell of blood
