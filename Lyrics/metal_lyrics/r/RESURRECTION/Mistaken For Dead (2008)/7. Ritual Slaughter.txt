You're sick of life
The need to be alone
A seed in your mind
The need for death will grow

Gallows
Where you will spend life
Torture
You will prey to die
Infection
Spreading through the mind
Sinner
Afraid to take your life

Dying
You're spend you're life
Dying
Lying
Your wretched worlds
Lying
Living
You are a slave
Living
Dying
You are a slave
Dying

You're sick of life
The need to be alone
A seed in your mind
The need for death will grow

You
You're the one
You're the seed
You spread your disease
You
Your to blame
Where's the shame
In spreading your violence
Spreading your violence
Your spreading your violence
Spreading your violence

Dying
You're spend you're life
Dying
Lying
Your wretched worlds
Lying
Living
You are a slave
Living
Dying
You are a slave
Dying

You're sick of life
The need to be alone
A seed in your mind
The need for death will grow

You
You're the one
You're the seed
You spread your disease
You
Your to blame
Where's the shame
In spreading your violence
Spreading your violence
Your spreading your violence
Spreading your violence
