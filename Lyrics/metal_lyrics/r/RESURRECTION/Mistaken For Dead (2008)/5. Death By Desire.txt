Death by desire
Born into a world you despise
Fueled by denial
Fear the worlds left you behind
Fall on the alter
Alone
Now it's time to die
Call on your father
Pray
He'll show mercy on your soul

The bodies fall around me
The smell of dead fills the air
Their madness can't control me
Torment
Their destined to fail
Believers try and stop me
The end
Tattered torn you die
Father don't forsake me
Stop the voices in my head
The fallen angel calling
Why must I mourn the dead
Lost and forsaken
Pray for me to repent
Dying

Death by desire
Born into a world you despise
Fueled by denial
Fear the worlds left you behind
Fall on the alter
Alone
Now it's time to die
Call on your father
Pray
He'll show mercy on your soul
