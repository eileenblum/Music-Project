Bastard you want to die
Your contemplating suicide
Coward you can't commit
Take control go through with it
Mother tell you son
He's gone too far what's done is done
It's too late to turn back now
The time has come just do it

Dying
Crucify me
Riding on the edge of sanity
Nothing left inside me
Believing
Death will set my mind at ease
Denying
Then I'm lying
Rotting to the core

Your living on the edge
You've played the game now it's time to end
The suffering
You're so sick inside
No one knows the tears you've cried
Feeling you want to die
The only way out is suicide
If there only was a way
To take your life and fade away
Coward

Dying
Crucify me
Riding on the edge of sanity
Nothing left inside me
Believing
Death will set my mind at ease
Denying
Then I'm lying
Rotting to the core

Dying
Crucify me
Riding on the edge of sanity
Nothing left inside me
Believing
Death will set my mind at ease
Denying
Then I'm lying
Rotting to the core
