Vile thoughts run through my head
Am I alive or am I dead
I can escape the things I've done
And I can't predict what's next to come
I'll stalk the night in search for prey
Down by dawn as I escape the day

My cries
Wasted away
When I find you
Alone in your world
I can't wait until
The day that I find you
Alone again

The search for victims to quench my thirst
So who will it be
Who will die first
I can't control my thirst for flesh
As hunger returns I'll kill again
The monster sleeps inside my mind
Awaking at night it's killing time

Closing
Your eyes to the way
That I'm feeling
Sick in the way
That I'm watching you
It's burning inside me
A thirst for flesh

My mind is twisted
My thoughts are obscene
You can't control me
As I laugh when you scream
I'll cut your eyes out
So you see where I've been
Just when it's over, well, I'll start it again

My cries
Wasted away
When I find you
Alone in your world
I can't wait until
The day that I find you
Alone again

Closing
Your eyes to the way
That I'm feeling
Sick in the way
That I'm watching you
It's burning inside me
A thirst for flesh

My cries
Wasted away
When I find you
Alone in your world
I can't wait until
The day that I find you
Alone again

Closing
Your eyes to the way
That I'm feeling
Sick in the way
That I'm watching you
It's burning inside me
A thirst for flesh

My mind is twisted
My thoughts are obscene
You can't control me
As I laugh when you scream
I'll cut your eyes out
So you see where I've been
Just when it's over, well, I'll start it again

Vile thoughts run through my head
Am I alive or am I dead
I can escape the things I've done
And I can't predict what's next to come
I'll stalk the night in search for prey
Down by dawn as I escape the day

My cries
Wasted away
When I find you
Alone in your world
I can't wait until
The day that I find you
Alone again

Closing
Your eyes to the way
That I'm feeling
Sick in the way
That I'm watching you
It's burning inside me
A thirst for flesh
