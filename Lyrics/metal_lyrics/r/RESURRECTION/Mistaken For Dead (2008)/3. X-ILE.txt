You're out in the world alone
So far away from home
Leaving it all behind
You're a fucking waste of life
They played you for a fool
With nothing left you loose
You've lost your sense of pride
Alone in the minds eye
Now it's up to you
So what else can you do
You're running out of time
Your dreaming of suicide

Minds eye
Controlling me
Suicide
Destroying me
Falling
Into the abyss
Of manipulative
Resentment
Minds eye

Reality grows so cold
There's no where left to go
With no one to hear your cry
You're a slave to the night
The numbling is so surreal
You hate the way you feel
No where to hide
Escaping the minds eye
The dark eclipse by day

You're lost
And so betrayed
Suicide
The only way
Your life
Slowly fades away

Minds eye
Controlling me
Suicide
Destroying me
Falling
Into the abyss
Of manipulative
Resentment
Minds eye

Now you're out of time
Still dreaming of suicide
The demons inside your head
They want you left for dead
So tired you try and fight
From taking your own life
No one can stop you now
This is your way out

You're lost
And so betrayed
The dark
Eclipse by day
Suicide
The only way
