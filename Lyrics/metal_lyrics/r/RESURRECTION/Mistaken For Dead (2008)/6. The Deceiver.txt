Do you think know me
Then what is my name?
Do you think you can trust me
To show you the way?
I've been called a liar
Been call a fool
Now that you've seen me
What will you do
As I walk through the silence
The sound seems so clear
Are you deaf to my message
Or will you run in fear?
Do you want me to save you?
Please let me know
Don't take me for granted
Together we will grow

Come on to me
Take from the tree
Follow my path
And never look back
I'll give you strength
All of my power
This beautiful fruit
It's time to devour

Let me in while you're still sleeping
I promise not to leave you weeping
Close your eyes release the sorrow
Open your mind beyond tomorrow

Come on to me
Take from the tree
Follow my path
And never look back
I'll give you strength
All of my power
This beautiful fruit
It's time to devour

Listen to my music
The sounds ring so clear
My voice is like crystal
My songs you'll revere
I've paid the price now
Or so I've been told
Come take my hand
Its time we must go
By almighty god
You're the chosen one
Will you still trust me
When you time has come?
Con you open your mind to me
And accept my way?
You still think you know me
Then what is my name?

Come on to me
Take from the tree
Follow my path
And never look back
I'll give you strength
All of my power
This beautiful fruit
It's time to devour
