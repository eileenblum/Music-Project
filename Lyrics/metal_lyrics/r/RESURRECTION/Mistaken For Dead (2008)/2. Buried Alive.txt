Buried alive
I can't breath
Hear my cry's
Feel my screams
Where I am
I can't see
Buried alive
Help me
The panic
The fear
What am I doing here
Darkness

The cold
Left here alone
I'm fading away
So afraid
Loosing my mind
Don't let me die
Lost between
Death and reality
Let me die
Take my life
Buried alive
Help me

It covers me
Beneath the ground
Concealing me
Can I be found
Defining
Are the sounds
Dark, cold
Suffocating

Pain it breaks me down
The sound of my heart pounding
Heavy to my core
It breaks me down
The thoughts in my head as I lay here left for dead
Take me now
The panic and fear overcome by sense of calm
Crying out
One last time while I make my peace

It covers me
Beneath the ground
Concealing me
Will I be found
Defining
Are the sounds
Dark, cold
Suffocating

It covers me
Beneath the ground
Concealing me
Can I be found
Defining
Are the sounds
Dark, cold
Suffocating
