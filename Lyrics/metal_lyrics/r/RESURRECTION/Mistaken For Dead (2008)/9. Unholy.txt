Battered
Blinded
Your scorn and denied
Afflicted and tortured
The denial and lies
Wrath
Escaping
Betrayal and cries
The call for alliance
Will return to rise

The call for alliance

You walk through life
Above the one divine
You think you're the one
Chosen to lead mankind
Your falling apart
Blinded by what you see
You feel the desire
As you laugh at their disease
