The innocence lost
Our children at war
The battle line crossed
As you kick down the door
An enemy sighted
Your killing at will
A young man dies
His child unborn
Their sending their letters
All wrapped in the flag
Along with a soldier
In a body bag
A human weapon
You're trained to kill
The challenge of honor
Your glad to fulfill
Accepting the burden
Of saving our race
The government lies
Deciding your fate
Out in the open
Your life's on the line
You're killing the enemy
As you try to survive
A cold heart
For killing
You're torn apart
Unwilling
You don't understand
Why
Believing
Their lie's

Controlling the chaos
With weapons of fear
The mass destruction
As their land is cleared
The enemy concurred
Their cities will fall
The battle continues
Until they are gone
A time of war
A time to kill
An innocent victim
Dying at will

The innocence lost
Our children at war
The battle line crossed
As you kick down the door
An enemy sighted
Your killing at will
A young man dies
His child unborn
Their sending their letters
All wrapped in the flag
Along with a soldier
In a body bag
A human weapon
You're trained to kill
The challenge of honor
Your glad to fulfill
Accepting the burden
Of saving our race
The government lies
Deciding your fate
Out in the open
Your life's on the line
You're killing the enemy
As you try to survive
A cold heart
For killing
You're torn apart
Unwilling
You don't understand
Why
Believing
Their lie's
