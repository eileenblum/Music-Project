[Ross Friedman - Patrick Fuchs]

This vow is all that's left
My faith is the final gift
I promised you guidance for your dying day
And here I am, to guard your last way

I've seen the dying, I've seen the wars
God, give me strength from above, hear my uproar
All these countless years I've crossed the earth
And there's no end in sight, endless dearth
I'm burned and broken, I stand alone
I'm facing infinite loss, all is gone
God, am I damned for all time? A restless soul?
I wanna fade away -- take me home!

God of dying -- take my life
I have no more to give -- end this strife
All the ages -- all this time
It's my final goodbye -- let me die

[Solo: RTB]

A blaze of fire alights my soul
With my body in flames I'm coming home
God of greatness, rescue me
Shelter this restless soul - set me free

God of dying -- take my life
I have no more to give -- end this strife
All the ages -- and all this time
It's my final goodbye -- let me die
