[Bonus track]

[Carsten Kettering - Patrick Fuchs]

I saw the ashes falling
No one seemed alive
The wounded slowly crawling
Starving at our side

I saw the fires
Sunlight in the night
God-defied and paralyzed
Screaming terrified

All the fear and all the blood
Have blinded the sun
Glory, pride and victory
Are falling one by one

Hiding in the shelters
Losing all their pride
The children and the elder
Try to run and hide

I saw the fires
Sunlight in the night
God-defied and paralyzed
Screaming terrified

All the fear and all the blood
Have blinded the sun
Glory, pride and victory
Are falling one by one

[Solo: RTB]

All the fear and all the blood
Have blinded the sun
Glory, pride and victory
Are falling one by one
All the fear and all the blood
Have blinded the sun
Glory, pride and victory
Are falling one by one
