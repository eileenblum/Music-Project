[Ross The Boss - Patrick Fuchs]

Brothers, I'm raging, the waiting is over
Vengeance is calling my name
I follow the trumpet right down to the peer
My readiness to proclaim

Side by side we are gathering
Comrades in blood and in battle
Always aware, never faltering
Always aware -- so alive

Here in the harbour the anchor is patient
The vessel is longing for fame
The bell rings the signal, I'm raising my head
The engines now welcome the flame

I wave goodbye to my fatherland
Facing the final horizon
"Right now you're holding your heart in your hands"
Ready to go -- ready to go

Death and glory on our minds
Fight for victory
Death and glory in our sight
Out in the black -- out on the sea
Death and glory

[Solo: RTB]

Out on the sea where the enemy's patient
Victory is in demand
Sold by the terror of unknown redemption
Enigma is no helping hand

Drop by drop as the vapor appears
Drop by drop do the convoys
The bombing and hunting, the blood and the tears
Battle is on -- Battle is on

Death and glory on our minds
Fight for victory
Death and glory in our sight
Out in the black of the sea
Death and glory on our minds
Fight for victory
Death and glory in our sight
Out in the black -- out on the sea
Death and glory
