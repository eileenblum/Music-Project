[Ross Friedman - Patrick Fuchs]

Souls of the dead gone not forgotten
Now they rise again
Prince of the rock, always the mighty
Now he's back again
He returned for the kill to establish the order
To bring back the glory and might
None shall be blamed, they will die in shame
If they refuse to fight

Spurned by those who pretend
Taking the power of what he'd invent
Saved the realm and all that was found
Now it's time to cry

I got the right -- I got the right
Can't be stopped from the glory
I got the right

There was a time when rock was hot molten
And fire ruled the earth
Right here tonight we are back at the front
The right has been given by birth
We give you our hearts, we've sold our souls
It's time to give them the works
And we stand as one
There's no one above (there is no one above)

Spurned by those who pretend
Taking the power the power of what he'd invent
Saved the realm and all that was found
Now it's time to cry

I got the right -- I got the right
Can't be stopped from the glory
I got the right

[Solo: RTB]

Now it's time to cry

I got the right -- I got the right
Can't be stopped from the glory
I got the right
