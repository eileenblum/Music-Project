[Brain Surgeon cover]

[Ross Friedman - Albert Bouchard - Deborah Frost]

In old time they could device
A decent warning to the wise
Frogs and hailstones
Clouds of locusts death of firstborns

All the truth you disguised
Everything you falsified
Everything you do
Gonna catch up to you
A plague of lies

Your world is littered
With one too many broken lives
Your very existence
Is a sorry compromise

Under oath you testified
Justice was denied
Everything you said
Rain down on your head
A plague of lies

[Solo: RTB, RTB+fux]

You're not cute when you fictionalize
Pull your evil over everybody's eyes
You deserve to be fried
The damage you done is never justified

All the truth you disguised
Everything you falsified
Everything you do
Boomerang back on you
A plague of lies
A plague of lies
Lies -- lies -- lies
