[Ross Friedman - Patrick Fuchs]

Today there is no wake up call
We're on the bus heading for the hall

Another town
And the kids will be around
Together we will rock it to the ground

I see the people from the front to the back
We shut the lights and raise for the attack

Let's play it loud
And knock the neighbours out
That's what Rock'n'Roll is all about

Back in the day
When Chuck told us how to play
Who'd have guessed that it will make it through?
Here's to you: May the gods be with you

Here's one for you who keep the faith
To our friends around the world who share our way

And for those who left too soon
We'll have a drink on you
You'll live on in the memories of the true

Back in the day
When Chuck told us how to play
Who'd have guessed that it will make it through?
Here's to you: May the gods be with you

[Solo: RTB]

Back in the day
When Chuck told us how to play
Who'd have guessed that it will make it through?
Just look around
We all were raised on that sound
It's what we live and feel, we won't withdrew
Here's to you: May the gods be with you
