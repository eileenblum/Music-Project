[Ross Friedman - Patrick Fuchs]

Here I stand
Like dust in (the) fullmoon
No time to hesitate
No place to keep the lies
Make my way
Into the screams, a cleansing fire
Is burning a hole in my back
I feel alive

We Will Kill -- the day has finally come
We Will Kill -- we turn the power on
We Will Kill -- come what may, as it will, now we will
We Will Kill

All alone now
Only the fog of fading memories
Shadows and faces
Are still in my head
I hear your voices
I hear the screams
I still feel the soaring flames
And I still see your eyes

We Will Kill -- the day has finally come
We Will Kill -- we turn the power on
We Will Kill -- come what may, as it will, now we will
We Will Kill

The hero's alive
The hero is here
Awaken my dream
Let me hear you scream!

[Solo: RTB, RTB+Fux]

Those who keep it true
Listen up and receive it
He could play anything
The people just would believe it

We Will Kill -- the day has finally come
We Will Kill -- we turn the power on
We Will Kill -- come what may, as it will, now we will
We Will Kill
