[Friedman - Kettering - Mayer - Fuchs]

And so one day
My life will be gone
Guard my soul
Immortal Son

A life is short so you'd better seize the day
Leave a mark, have an echo remain
Hear my words as I look into your eyes:
When the day has come a soul is said to fly

I've made my way and I tried to take the world
After all I have always kept my word
I bid you: Take my soul and never let it loose
For it will guide your way on any path you'll choose

Rise -- rise -- rise -- rise

And so one day
My life will be gone
Guard my soul
Immortal Son

It may take a lifetime to find out the truth
The eternal wisdom of elder and youth
I might have dreamed for ages but I can clearly see
We're bonded forever by the blood in you and me

[Licks: RTB]
[Solo: RTB+Fux]

Rise -- rise -- rise -- rise

And so one day
My life will be gone
Guard my soul
Immortal Son
