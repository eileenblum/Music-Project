[Brain Surgeon cover]

[Ross Friedman - Albert Bouchard - Deborah Frost]

The state of creation is holy war
Waged on the promise of immortal reward
Petition of prayer and permission of lords
Heavy's the hand that holds Constantine's sword

Onward soldiers -- onward soldiers -- onward
Onward soldiers -- onward soldiers -- onward

Those who don't know history repeat it
Only the winners pretend to defeat it
Those who rewrite history are doomed
Heavy's the heart that bears Constantine's wound

Onward soldiers -- onward soldiers -- onward
Onward soldiers -- onward soldiers -- onward

A healing circle destroyed a temple
With passion play and seamless robe
Blood libel stains the true cross
The heavens cry for the ghetto of Rome

The empire was born of infinite loss
Who can sustain eternal cost
Whose children are saved by suffering tests
Heavy's the soul who'll forgive Constantine's debts

Onward soldiers -- onward soldiers -- onward
Onward soldiers -- onward soldiers -- onward
To oblivion
