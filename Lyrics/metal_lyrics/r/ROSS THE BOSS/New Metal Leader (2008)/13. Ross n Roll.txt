[Bonus track]

[Patrick Fuchs]

Ever since I was a boy
I would have a dream
Playin' in a rockin' band
To rock it is to be -- yeah!

I rocked the mirror
Every day and night -- now I'm right!
Alright

This is my fate
Written on my soul
None can ever hold me down
Born to Ross'n'Roll

I would never give a damn
For what the others say
Then one day the sky would crack
A hero came along and made my day

Just feel the power
The guitar and the screams

This is my fate
Written on my soul
None can ever hold me down
Born to Ross'n'Roll

[Solo: CK, RTB]

This is my fate
Written on my soul
None can ever hold me down
Born to Ross'n'Roll
