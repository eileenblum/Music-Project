Our lives must change
From the cradle to the grave
So turn the page
And glory to the brave

I stand alone
My face turned to the storm
I stand alone

Forever I'm alive among the ruins

A brand new day
In a world so newly born
A brand new day
And a vow so dearly sworn

I stand alone
My face turned to the storm
I stand alone

Forever I'm alive among the ruins
Among the ruins

Belief and faith
A mountain they can move
So come what may
All bare to the view

I stand alone
My face turned to the storm
I stand alone

Forever I'm alive among the ruins

[Solo: Ross]

I stand alone
My face turned to the storm
I stand alone

Forever I'm alive among the ruins
Among the ruins
Among the ruins
Among the ruins
