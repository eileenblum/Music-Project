I have heard the battle cry
Blood is on the wind
The prophecy of fire lies within
Chanting hordes, the restless breed
Coming from the hills
Beyond procrastination is their will

Lord of the fire
Lord of the land
Kingdom arise - kingdom arise
Lord of the water
Lord of the wind
Kingdom arise - kingdom arise

I have heard the barren lands
Cry the soldiers' names
Countless lives are lost without a grave
Destination: We will kill
Spill the blood, now blood shall spill
Power from the earth and below

Lord of the fire
Lord of the land
Kingdom arise - kingdom arise
Lord of the water
Lord of the wind
Kingdom arise - kingdom arise

[Solo: Ross]

I have heard the battle cry
The prophecy is still alive
Spill the blood and count the sands of time
Destination: We will kill
Spill the blood, now blood shall spill
Power from the earth and below

Lord of the fire
Lord of the land
Kingdom arise - kingdom arise
Lord of the water
Lord of the wind
Kingdom arise - kingdom arise
