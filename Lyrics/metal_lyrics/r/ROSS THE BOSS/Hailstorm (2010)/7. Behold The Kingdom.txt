When the sinners left their broken homes
When the land was black and lost
Orphan angels (were) spreading broken wings
And the seas' eternal frost

The kingdom of the world
Is the last one to return

Behold the kingdom
Behold the land
Behold the kingdom
And save the man

When the pilgrims left their burnt-out homes
Facing seas and black horizons
The last supper was a meagre meal
And every footstep is denial

We are the children of the world
Everlasting was our search
The kingdom of the world
Is the last one to return

Behold the kingdom
Behold the land
Behold the kingdom
And save the man

[Solo: Ross]

We are the children of the world
Everlasting was our search
The kingdom of the world
Is the last one to return

Behold the kingdom
Behold the land
Behold the kingdom
And save the man
Behold the kingdom
Behold the land
Just behold the kingdom
Until the ending of the world
Behold the kingdom
