By Crom, the mighty
The power of steel shall rise
To guard the people
To protect the Cimmerian skies

A human sacrifice

Thy power
Thy glory
Shall rule this land
Thy wisdom
Thy secret
We shall be the judged by his hand

By Crom, the mighty
Father of power and steel
His mountain kingdom
Realm of clouds and mist

On death day we shall kneel

[Solo: Ross]

On death day we shall kneel

Thy power
Thy glory
Shall rule this land
Thy wisdom
Thy secret
We shall be the judged by his hand
Thy power
Thy glory
Shall rule this land
Thy wisdom
Thy secret
We shall be the judged by his hand
Thy power
Thy glory
Thy secret
