Here I stand right at the verge again
The road is open, many ways to go
And by my side only the good remained
Leaving all the other ones behind

So as we march the world is in our hands
Forever soldiers under our command
Bonded by faith, we have made our stand
Forever brothers, unity and band

Our way is the shining path
Our way is the shining path

You can see our future is right before our eyes
A blaze of light, a figure in the skies
And one by one the gathering, they're following our way
They share our dreams and our beliefs, they know we've come to stay

So as we march the world is in our hands
Forever soldiers under our command
We've found our way and better songs to sing
Forever brothers, victory to bring

Our way is the shining path
Our way is the shining path
Our way is the shining path
Our way is the shining path

[Solo: Ross]

Bonded by faith, we have made our stand
Forever brothers, unity and band

Our way is the shining path
Our way is the shining path
Our way is the shining path
Our way is the shining path
Our way is the shining path
