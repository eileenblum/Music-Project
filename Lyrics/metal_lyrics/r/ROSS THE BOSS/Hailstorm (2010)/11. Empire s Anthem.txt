We've come from the land where dreams are forgotten
Where tales were to tell the truth
Reflecting the mirror unveiling the rotten
And treacherous image of you
Loss, real loss for eons and ages
A fallible dirge of lies
Sung in the shadows resisting progression
But the empire will finally rise

Won't you come, chant the word
Anthem of the world
Won't you come, praise the word
Anthem of the world

We've come from the land of the unbroken egos
Sophomorically suppressing the truth
Inside these walls attempting the hopeless
Echoes spitting at you
Loss, real loss for eons and ages
But the empire will finally rise

Won't you come, chant the word
Anthem of the world
Won't you come, praise the word
Anthem of the world

We've come from the land where dreams are forgotten
Where tales were to tell the truth unveiling the rotten
Won't you come, chant the word
Anthem of the world

[Solo: Ross]

Won't you come, chant the word
Anthem of the world
Won't you come, praise the word
Anthem of the world
Anthem of the world
Won't you come, chant the word
Anthem of the world
