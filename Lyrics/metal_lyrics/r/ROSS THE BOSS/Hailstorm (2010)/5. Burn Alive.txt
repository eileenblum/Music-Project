Where is the man I knew
Not the filthy wretch that's left of you
These years of living lies
And heresy are dropping like flies

Just take a look inside, behind your public smile
Now tell me what you see, the bonfire of the vanities
The devil and the deep blue sea

Burn alive - in the fires of hell
Burn alive - in the fires, keep burning in the fires of hell

These shards of broken dreams
Must have cut you deeper than it seems
Your boast and ignorance
Will haunt you like an animal on the run

Just take a look inside, behind your public smile
Now tell me what you see, the bonfire of the vanities
The devil and the deep blue sea

Burn alive - in the fires of hell
Burn alive - in the fires, keep burning in the fires of hell
Burn alive - in the fires of hell
Burn alive - in the fires, keep burning in the fires of hell

[Solo: Ross]

Burn alive - in the fires of hell
Burn alive - in the fires, keep burning in the fires of hell
Burn alive - in the fires of hell
Burn alive - in the fires, keep burning in the fires of hell
In the fires of hell
