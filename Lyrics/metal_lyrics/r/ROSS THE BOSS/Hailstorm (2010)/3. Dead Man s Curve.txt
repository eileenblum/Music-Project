I ride the death machine down to dead man's curve
At super overdrive, acceleration force
I am the speed patrol, transcendence on my mind
I take the challenge and I leave the world behind

Run for termination at the speed of sound
Down in Dead Man's Curve
A cry for liberation, a collision course
Down in Dead Man's Curve

I ride the gambling horse at extended trot
Force-fed for overload at once and on the spot
I am the speed patrol, my demons petrified
I take the challenge and I leave the world behind

Run for termination at the speed of sound
Down in Dead Man's Curve
A cry for liberation, a collision course
Down in Dead Man's Curve

[Solo: Ross]

Run for termination at the speed of sound
Down in Dead Man's Curve
A cry for liberation, a collision course
Down in Dead Man's Curve
A cry for liberation, a collision course
Down in Dead Man's Curve
