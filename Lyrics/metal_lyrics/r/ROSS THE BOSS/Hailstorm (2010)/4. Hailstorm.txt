Blackened skies, thermal shock, seas running dry
Cracking ice, barren ground, firebirds they fly

When the sign of the unborn is read
By the sons of redemption we're lead

Cryptic psalms, sceptic rhymes, scrambled are the vows
Echoes of the children's cries silenced by now

When the sign of the unborn is read
By the sons of redemption we're lead

Through raging storms - towering clouds - the aftermath - is born in a

Hailstorm - revelation
Hailstorm - an apocalyptic
Hailstorm - Armageddon
Hailstorm arise

Blackened skies, thermal shock, cities bound to die
Drowning in a poisoned flood historically high

When the sign of the unborn is read
By the sons of redemption we're lead

Through raging storms - towering clouds - the aftermath - is born in a

Hailstorm - revelation
Hailstorm - an apocalyptic
Hailstorm - Armageddon
Hailstorm arise

[Solo: Ross]

Raging storms - towering clouds - the aftermath - is born in a

Hailstorm - revelation
Hailstorm - an apocalyptic
Hailstorm - Armageddon
Hailstorm arise
Hailstorm - revelation
Hailstorm - an apocalyptic
Hailstorm - Armageddon
Hailstorm arise
