After the show
what does remain?
What have you got
To take away?
All is quiet
Nobody's around
Lights are out
and it's late

After the show
what does remain?
You in the night

Pack your stuff and prepare to leave
A place you've never really been
Shaking hands and kissing lips
Of ghosts and fading memories

After the show
what does remain?
You in the night

Temporary is permanent- silence is loud
You stand still - universe rotates around

After the show what does remain?

After the show
what does remain?
You in the night

After the show
what does remain?
You in the night
