The flock was grazing the same old grass in the same old field when I left
The flock was watering the same old mud at the same old dump when I left

Breathing for the first time, I felt I could fly, I also felt so sad
For I felt from this journey I'd never return the same person again

Away from the flock I went

Walking down the road I found out how to tell my friends from my foes
Walking down the road I found out how to tell the bad from the good

Home is wherever I go but I know I can't stay for too long
Nothing's assumed, nothing is safe that's the price that I pay
