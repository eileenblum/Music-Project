There is something
That has always been with me
Giving shape to my dreams
Giving me visions

Now the angry teen
Is also a beautiful child
They made me the adult I am
Created something in me

It keeps evolving in me

Now I wonder
Where the distance's gone?
How long was the road
That brought me here?

Here, what brought me here?
Can all have happened by chance?
Here, what brought me here today?
In retrospective it is clear

It was necessary to me
Looking back it is clear
A lifelong slope took me here
Let me rest while I speak
Stay here with me

There were mountains to climb
And an ocean to sail
But now it seems
That it took only one day

To become myself
To find my way
Through all these years
Through all my mistakes
