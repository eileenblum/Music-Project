I don't blame your ways, your actions, your talks
The nonsense you eat is the same you'll forever shit
I don't think you're bad or trying to do something to me
But this distance exists and you're such a fuck face

Fuck Face

Ten million times was clear this place's yours not mine
insects like me bought or destroyed
Impotent screams sold or forgotten
To a corner I belong away from your fuck face

Fuck Face
