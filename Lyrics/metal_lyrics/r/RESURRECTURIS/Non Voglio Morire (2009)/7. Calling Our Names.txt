Lonely people staring (at) the starlight
lonely people lost in the night time
lonely people staring (at) the starlight
still they ain't nothing and nowhere to hide

zombie people long time dead now
I even wonder if they ever lived
zombie people, who are simply undergoing their life

calling me â calling you â you call my name

there are sometimes I turn 'round my sight
trying to read deep in their minds
then I perceive most of their smiles
like empty masks that won't help them survive

calling me â calling you â you call my name

Then beauty came
She entered my life
Despite my anger
I could recognize
An unchained soul
That was so close to mine
The mirror of all my desires

When beauty came
She filled my eyes
And made me able
to smile on my cries
a different time has come
A time when I
I feel that I won't be alone, anymore alone

Despite the things I've done
For all the things you saw
Because of the promises made
We're gonna call our names

Despite the things I've done
For all the things you saw
Because of the promises made
And for the time that's gone

Despite the things I've done (I call your name)
For all the things you saw (you call my name)
Because of the promises made (I call your name)
We're gonna call our names (keep on calling our names)

I call your name
You call my name
I call your name
We call our names
