I came thru so much hard stuff and roads
being on the path to achieve my goals
walk thru fire
walk thru fire

sacrificed to my art my tomorrow (walk thru fire)
all those years, all those words, all those sounds (walk thru fire)
been betrayed by my friends and my lovers (walk thru fire)
(but) I'm still here going strong all alone (walk thru fire)

I've seen the sun and the sky explode
I've felt the cold breath of death in my bones
walk thru fire
walk thru fire

sacrificed to my art my tomorrow (walk thru fire)
all those years, all those words, all those sounds (walk thru fire)
been betrayed by my friends and my lovers (walk thru fire)
(but) I'm still here going strong all alone (walk thru fire)
