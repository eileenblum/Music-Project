Do you think that this is fun?
A Technicolor paradise?
Do you fail to see what brought me here?
what the Muse has sucked from me?

'cause the artist's life is like no one's
feeding on his own meat
Common mortal forms - they are blind
to the light that burns my eyes

Confined in a desert space
where no one would ever roam
keep on speaking to a world that doesn't care
sit frustrated and alone

'cause the artist's life is like no one's
thirsty of his own blood
Common mortal forms - they are deaf
to the noise that wounds my ears
to the pain that cracks my limbs
to the misery where humans live
