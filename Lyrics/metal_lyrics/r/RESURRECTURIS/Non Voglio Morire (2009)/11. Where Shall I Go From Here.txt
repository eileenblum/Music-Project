Where shall I go from here
Now all roads are known
Where's a new direction
To escape from these old traps

It's always tempting
Play safe and never risk
Only use same old tricks to control the situation
So I ask tell me now what's this worth?

Is this worth any time
Is this worth any effort
Is this worth any respect

Discipline, restraint and motivation
If I follow my inspiration
There's a chance that I get to a place that is unknown
To a time, to a truth that is pure

To a place
To a time
To a truth
That is pure
