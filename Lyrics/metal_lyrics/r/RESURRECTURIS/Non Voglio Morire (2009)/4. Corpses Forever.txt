Forced to be silent
Burning from inside out
Annihilated by reality
Grinding hate rises

Aural ultraviolence
Storming in our brains
Never heard before
The sound of the ripping death

Sounds of death
Possessed our souls
Corpses forever
Screaming their rage

Terror, death, destruction
Sickness ridden thoughts
Rotten noise mayhem
Burning deep below

Aural ultraviolence
Storming in our brains
Never heard before
The sound of the ripping death

Sounds of death
Possessed our souls
Corpses forever
Screaming their rage

Corpsesâ¦corpsesâ¦
Corpsesâ¦corpsesâ¦
