The origin inside me
The origin outside me
The origin everyday
The origin of this fucking mess

For no apparent reason
and no explainable motive
Without an initiation
Growing all the time

A beautiful child became an angry teen
an angry little teen turned into an adult

For no apparent reason
and no explainable motive
Without an initiation
Growing all the time

This demon feeds on everything that I eat, that I see, that I hear, that I smell, that I touch and that touches me.
What I like and I dislike. What I remember and I forget. This demon inhabits every crack of my life where he manifests himself.
