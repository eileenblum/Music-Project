A line â breaking me in two
Pieces â since I was a child

The fracture
Was carved in me
Through teachings
And education

Your love â a double edged sword
Helped me â As much as it crippled me

The fracture
Was carved in me
Through teachings
And religion

Struggling â my own limitations
Through art â I reunite myself

The fracture
Was carved in me
Through teachings
And negation
