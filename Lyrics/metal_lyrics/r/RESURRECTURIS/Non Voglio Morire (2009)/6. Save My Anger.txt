My eyes turn blood red
My mind is blacking out for the stress
Can't almost move, can't almost talk
Paralyzed by the anger that you instil

Can't find a reason
Not to kill you

This is something I must control
Killing you will do no good to me
My shaking body I take command of
And do something no one else has done

Destructive force
A means for creation
Out of the negative
I do something positive
Destructive force
A means for creation
I save my anger
To write these words

Bastards out there, this curse's for you
If we can't share this rotten world
I will create a new universe
Where your shit will find no place - find no place

Destructive force
A means for creation
Out of the negative
I do something positive
Destructive force
A means for creation
I save my anger
To write these words

Now I have a reason
Not to kill you

Destructive force
A means for creation
Out of the negative
I do something positive
Destructive force
A means for creation
I save my anger
To write these words

Save my anger
