I just spent the last hour adding data to the system. Lots of urgent mails to be responded straight away.
Updated drafts have already been solicited twice. Can't cope with my work schedule, it's leaving me behind.
Never happy. Oh. Never happy.
Never happy of me, never happy of you, never happy of me, never happy.
For every goal that I achieve, two more appear and over time I start feeling like a worn out shoe.
Never happy of me, never happy of you - Is this the way it should go?
Never happy of me, never happy of you - Fuck me and fuck you!
Never happy - Oh. Never happy.
Never happy of me, never happy of you, never happy of me, never happy.
Delays, mistakes, defeats I fear.
It's like a prison. [2x]
No one can make it. [2x]
My fails erase my self-image.
It's my damned duty, who did set the goals?
It's like a prison. [2x]
I cannot make it.
No one can make it.
It's a fucking prison.
Never happy. No. We are never happy. Never happy.
Never happy of me, never happy of you, never happy of me.
Fuck me and fuck you!
Delays, mistakes, defeats I fear.
It's like a prison. [2x]
No one can make it. [2x]
It's like a prison. [4x]
I cannot make it. We cannot make it. [3x]
