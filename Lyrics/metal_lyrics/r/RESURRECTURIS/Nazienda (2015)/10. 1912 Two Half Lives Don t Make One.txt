Two half lives don't make one and never will
Live one wishing the other

Two half lives don't make one and never will
You end up with broken pieces

Can't you simply give up? [2x]

Two half lives don't make one and never will
Time always wins

Run, but time runs faster than you do
Chase goals that elude you

Amass books you cannot read
Write songs no one hears
Knowledge you will never use in your condition

Two half lives don't make one and never will
No matter how much you struggle
Two half lives don't make one and never will
Dumb shit
What do I do if one is not enough?
It's not enough

You keep on trying despite the frustration
And guess what?
You will never make it

[5x]
Chi troppo vuole
Nulla stringe
