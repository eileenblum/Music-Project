The very important monthly meeting with the board of directors is about to begin...
Quick! Schnell! Contier Pyle!
You need to gather all the files and information for the presentation, so go!
Check that everybody is there and make shure that the projector is working too.
Bring some bottles of water. The meeting can now begin...
First to speak is the peacock whose flowchart is crammed with funny words.
Rhino makes his first attack. The shark takes over the situation.
Snake spits a bit of poison while the rabbit runs in fear.
The meeting is taking off now - welcome to the meeting room.
Animals in the meeting room.
Animals in the meeting room.
The monkey repeats things that had already been said.
The lion does the lamb and calls it quits.
What was the gist of the meeting nobody can say,
Except the re-affirmation of the rules of the jungle.
In the meeting room...
(Great amazement)
Everybody was minding their own business.
Everybody was having their own thoughts.
The pig was having sexual fantasies.
The dog was thinking of his debts.
And the result is just another pile of work on my desk...
Aaarghhh!
