Ambition, competition, emulation.
Deadlines in front of us from our bosses.
A crazy race leading to isolation and exhaustion.
But we share a fate of toil that's common. Let's not forget!
When we laugh and communicate,
Bridge the distance that seperates.
A defense that's just too weak.
Through our sacrifices.
Through days in our lives.
Through when we cry.
We, we pay our bills.
We save for our dreams.
We support our dears.
Oh we share this boat where we can sink. Let's not forget!
Pride, strength, will.
Pride, strength, will, resistance.
Through these bitter times.
Through undying smiles.
Through when we grow tired.
We, we build our homes.
We send kids to school.
We never let go.
But we share this boat where we can sink. Let's not forget!
Support each other! [2x]
