Grey peripheral roads
They all look the same.
From the seat of my car
They bear no beauty.
It is a mystery to me
How can we drive here
Without losing ourselves?
Forever rolling in circles
In this universe of asphalt.
And then the radio
Cranks up that old song.
A song I used to adore as a teen.
And it shakes me, revives me, elates me.
My heartbeat is still pumping blood in my veins.
Fog's outside the cars
And fog inside the cars.
Blurred minds slowly
Focussing on the tasks of the day.
Then above me
I catch a glimpse of blue.
A sign that life is unbreakable.
It reminds me the mountains, your body.
Inside me I carry the things I love and need.
Forever on the way to work... [4x]
Forever... [2x]
