Another dawn is breaking
Within the four walls of our still bedroom.
Even the mirrors are resting
For they have nothing to portrait, only the silence.
I float in my dreams as you fall me in my sleep
With your breathing.

A little later your red curls on my shoulder
Are ignited by the through the shutter.
Like the rising sun is warming up our house
The heat of your body warms my chest.
Here, in this deep where I fear no fear, where I feal at peace
I don't want to leave, let me lie here, just you and me.
