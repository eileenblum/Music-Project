A haze of trays.
The queue slowly advancing.
The smell of the food.
The hum...
"Where will you go on the day of the Patron?"
"Have you seen my new car? It's in the parking lot..."
"The soup is too cold and the carrots are old."
As I slow down the chewing of my aubergeen
And stare blindly
And melt slowly
"Trying to quit smoking, it will take a lot of time."
"I'm on a diet and it makes me feel so good!"
"That new TV host must be 20 years old."
Then I see another wreck staring back at me.
The more I try to focus
The more I fail to grasp
The meaning of words around me.
Maybe there's more than I perceive
Under the plain surface
But to get it requires too much efford...
I'm exhausted
And we are all exhausted
And all we want is to lie and be cuddled
And rest like dead
And be left alone
And be forgotten [2x]
Four more hours left [4x]
