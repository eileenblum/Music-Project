A piercing headache in the back of my eyes.
The wage for a long day. The price that needs to be paid...
Just lay my head upon her legs
'cause there is nothing more,
There is nothing more of this day.
Just close my eyes.
There is nothing more.
Oh, there is nothing more.
All is through for today - Sleep tight my dear love.
There is no more work to do - Dream of another world.
You have paid all your dues - I will be here with you.
There is nothing more...
Just throw it all behind my back
'cause there is nothing more,
Oh, there is nothing more of this day.
And as I slide away (as the world fades)
She is there with me,
Oh, she is holding me.
All is through for today - All I want is here with me.
There is no more work to do - I can let it all go.
You have paid all your dues - Fall asleep on the couch.
There is nothing more...
All is through for today.
There is no more work to do.
You have paid all your dues.
There is nothing more of you.
