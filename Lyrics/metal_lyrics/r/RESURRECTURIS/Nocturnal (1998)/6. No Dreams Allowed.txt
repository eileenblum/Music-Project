See what the world's all about!
A landscape of despair
Fills our eyes with tears of sorrow while crowds drop dead.

It's always been the same:
Countless deaths, endless pain.
The den of iniquity where we all drown alive.

Hacked and massacred,
Bodies torn apart,
The Helpless are maimed,
Deleted their remains.
No dreams.

We cannot close our eyes
Pretending that everyone
Is sharing our ease:
We all lay on a bed of pain.
No dreams
