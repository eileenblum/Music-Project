What you see is not what I feel
for there's this drape in me woven with dark silk
Turns everything into grey as (it) was made of shades

Things I've done the whole of my life
Have become now empty shells consumed by the waves of time
Now everything is plain grey and my life just fades away and away and away

Silent air, a leaden sky
is reflecting in this motionless lake
Not a whisper nor a sound
Only sorrow and despair
It's been you - you killed me first [2x]

Moods of darkness have encircled my soul
Day by day I feel the foolishness
It is something I cannot explain
But it's eating me from inside
Eating me - from inside
Eating me - you killed me first
