Millions dead - Then the end
Genocide - Then the end
Upset lives - Then the end
Human beings? - Then the end

Internal death - Then the end
Empty bodies - Then the end

Blind hatred - Then the end
Two flashes - Then the end

They brought death from the skies
Nuclear avenging angels, (the) bombs on their wings
Silently they are falling from the skies
Nuclear hell is lit - Then the end

Life was taken away from the ground
Victims reduced to ashes, no trace to be found
Unnatural silence descends over the ground
Nuclear hell is over - This is the end

This is the end
