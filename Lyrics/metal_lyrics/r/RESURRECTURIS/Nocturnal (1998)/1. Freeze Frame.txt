You're marching in the mud - you're like a vulture
now you have smelled your prey - helpless and terrified
you got, you got him - zooming to capture
images of pain - a film is always rolling
freeze the frame of agonizing - freeze it while he's dying
you know it pays so well - sell his death
now cook this meal for - all those perverts who are at home
whose only pleasure is to feed - theis leeched eyes
