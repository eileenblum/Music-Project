There's nothing more to be said
The play is finished
Since the very first moment
With the most brutal loss of style

Hypocrite - Autocrat - Demagogue
An offence to our good taste
Killer, you had to be alone
With the helmet logic / illogic nature

Don't give up

This is the one and only rule
Never close your eyes - the critical shape of hatred
Against the helmet logics

Hypocrite - Autocrate - D?magogue
A disgusting vision
For those who are still able to think
With their pride they still can hate
The lousy commands of a bigot

Tautologies in barrack-room language
It is against the principles of life
So he teaches to refuse
