The light in her eyes - faded away and suddenly we realize
The light in her eyes - faded away and suddenly we realize

We realize that painful sense of mortality - of normality
Now showing art is senseless because it has been mocked

The light in her eyes - faded away
Back among the steer of a thousand faces
Suddenly I saw - another silhouette
Of impersonal bright yellow

That delicate - pale face
Original and primordial
Was lost in the generic
Putting an internal end

The light in her eyes - faded away bringing an hermetic end
Bringing an hermetic end to an open solar poetry
