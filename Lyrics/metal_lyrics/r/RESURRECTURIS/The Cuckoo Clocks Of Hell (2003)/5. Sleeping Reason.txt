So many people ready to die,
So many people waiting to suicide,
No matter what you do or say,
There is no reason, there is no way.
So many people ready to die,
For their cause or to defend their right.

Wake up!

We are on the edge of a new age of darkness.

Well armed soldiers bomb and maim,
Exalted terrorists hijack airplanes,
Terror worldwide has now begun
And we all live under the gun.
So many people ready to die,
for their cause or to defend their right.

Wake up!

Every time I see their eyes they look alright:
happy, hopeful and satisfied
they are ready to fight
To kill, to die, to kill, to die!
