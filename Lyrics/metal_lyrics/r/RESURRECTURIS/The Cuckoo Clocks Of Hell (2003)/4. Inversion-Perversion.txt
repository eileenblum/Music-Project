Go on, go on, go on
I control your face - I enjoy your hate
Freeze me again - lacerate my flesh
Don't you perceive your mediocrity through my indifference?

Go on, go on, go on
In this upset relation - I touch the paradox
You can't tell tears from irony anymore
The joy in my eradicated body inverts your logics

Motherfucker

Have you understood?
The more you suffer, the more you become strong
I am enjoying your questions
Have you understood?
It is my indifference to set the rules

Now your hate has no priorities, priorities....
