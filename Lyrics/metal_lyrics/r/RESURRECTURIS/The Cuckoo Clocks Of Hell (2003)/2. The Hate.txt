That eternally sad people
They make of pain their mask
They don't know what they say
They don't know the game they're playing
If they only knew
They would shut their mouths up

The hate...

Broken lives and destroyed
against distress they have unleashed
a retaliation created by hate
face to face against a wall
detestable for their scorn
against everything that is mediocre

The hate...
