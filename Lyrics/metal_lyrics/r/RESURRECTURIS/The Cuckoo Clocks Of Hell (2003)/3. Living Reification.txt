Idiot motivation without reflection
Abuse by abuse dressed in pride ' oppression
Beyond any reason ' the dark isolation
Where any dignity has no sense ' the absurd
Premature saviour in the reverse
Beings and names are like...reification

You are mine now

You take my existence but not my dignity because it's me!
That is me

Step by step we are our grave
Plastic men without dreams - you are submit!
Lifeless and bare toy you have lost your name
To rise and fall through the nothing

You are mine now

You take my existence but not my dignity because it's me!
That is me

I touch the veil of the abandon
I feel the anguish of everyone
But now I hear my name
Hating reification

Step by step
I tell my true name
And recognize myself
In a place called Utopia
