Slowly you fall into insanity
Where your fears feed all the pain
Crawling with your fear through memories that died

Fall on your knees
While life destroys all you fought for
Times passes by and all you've known will be gone

Haunted you fall into infinity
Where your screams feed all the pain
Wandering through the endless halls of sleep
Only to die

Fall on your knees
While life destroys all you fought for
Time passes by and all you've known will be gone

A step away from finding your fate
Yet the scars will remain to guide the way

Fall on your knees
While life destroys all you fought for
Time passes by and all you've known will be gone
