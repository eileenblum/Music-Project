Every shadow in the night
Every footstep, every sigh was something else
But now I see, now I see you clearly

Deep within every fear, every scream
Hides the one that breathes through me
Destroying every memory till nightmares
Reign my sleep

All the hate I've tried to hide
Every tear I couldn't cry, it was someone else
And now I feel, now I feel you in me

Deep within every fear, every scream
Hides the one that breathes through me
Destroying every memory till nightmares
Reign my sleep

Beyond your gaze lies an awakened,
Unchained evil a soul entwined in flames

Deep within every fear, every scream
Hides the one that breathes through me
Destroying every memory

Deep within every fear, every scream
Hides the one that breathes through me
Destroying every memory till nightmares
Reign my sleep
