Silence, your enemy fills the room again
With all that you've tried to forget
The pain and a thousand regrets

I'll let you fall, I'll let you die
If you decide it's time for you to say goodbye
And leave the scars behind

Darkness, your sanctuary fades away again
When light lets the sorrow back in
Each morning the same curse begins

I'll let you fall, I'll let you die
If you decide it's time for you to say goodbye
And leave the scars behind

Brought to your knees, beaten down to crawl
Praying to be released, just let go
I'll let you go

I'll let you fall, I'll let you die
If you decide it's time for you to say goodbye
And leave the scars behind

If you decide it's time for you to say goodbye
And leave the scars behind
