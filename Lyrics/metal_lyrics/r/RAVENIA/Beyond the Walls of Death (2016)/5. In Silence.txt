Free all your pain
One whisper from life, one whisper from death
No words remain on this starless night
When a tear hits the frozen ground and exists no more

This is where it ends
No more crosses to bear
No more grief to be held
Buried within yourself

As time erase
The whispers of life, only silence remains
All was in vain on that starless night
When a tear hit the frozen ground praying to exist
Once more

This is where it ends
No more lies to repent
No more tears to be shed
Within forlorn farewells

This is where you will stand
Crucified to the past
Left to wander this path to eternity
