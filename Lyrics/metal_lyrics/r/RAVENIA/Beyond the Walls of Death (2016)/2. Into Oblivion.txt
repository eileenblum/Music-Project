Close your eyes and fly away
To the place where all the sorrow will unchain
Where all your fears will be undone
Let your mourning guide you

Lay your faith in the darkness to ease your pain
When it calls your name
Follow the silence where your tears remain
As one with the rain
In the endless

Close your mind and fade away
To the place where all your memories are erased
Where all the screams will be undone
Let the broken guide you

Lay your faith in the darkness to ease your pain
When it calls your name
Follow the silence where your tears remain
As one with the rain
In the endless

I've seen it closing in on your soul
Swim with the darkness where the waves die down

Lay your faith in the darkness to ease your pain
When it calls your name
Follow the silence where your tears remain
As one with the rain
In the endless
