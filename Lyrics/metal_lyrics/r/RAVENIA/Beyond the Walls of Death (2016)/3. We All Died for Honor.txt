I fall tonight beneath the broken memories
Of the one you once were
A fighter, a soldier who lost the war

I hear your cries in everyone you left behind
And we all died when silence won the fight with you

Alone we walk on the path that leads us
To the ones we've become
Forsaken, we're the broken who lost the war

I hear your cries in everyone you left behind
And we all died when silence won the fight with you

There's nothing left to fight for
There's nothing left to lose

I hear your cries in everyone you left behind
And we all died when silence won the fight with you
I hear your cries in everyone you left behind
And we all died when silence won the fight with you
