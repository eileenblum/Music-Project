One last breath that lingers on
In the silence that shades your path
You have followed for far too long

Though there is no light
Follow your path to live again
Through darkness skies
Lest you forget your fate and drift away

Time to leave the past behind
The emptiness in your heart
You have fought for far too long

Though there is no light
Follow your path to live again
Through the darkened skies
Lest you forget your fate and drift away

Though there is no light
Follow your path to live again
Through the darkened skies
Lest you forget your fate and drift away

Never forget your fate...
