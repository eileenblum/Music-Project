Don't be afraid
Rise above your fears and pray
That we're the ones life will embrace
When everyone else drifts away

We will rise and fall as one
Cause we're unending till death us parts
We are standing tall as one
Cause we'll keep fighting till we have won the way

Don't be afraid
Rise above your fears and pray
That we're the ones time won't erase
When everything else fades away

We will rise and fall as one
Cause we're unending till death us parts
We are standing tall as one
Cause we'll keep fighting till we have won the way

We are not afraid
Though our memory will fade
Till nothing remains

We will rise and fall as one
Cause we're unending till death us parts
We are standing tall as one
Cause we'll keep fighting till we have won the way
