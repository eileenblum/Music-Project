Pounding your hands to the wall
i need to kill you
mockering and sodomizing
your existense
black god i become.

Pulverizing, you become ashes without flesh and soul
my torture on you knows no limits
turns you in a slave of this hate
from above all the things, my desire will reign 
conquer your soul, it's what i want.

Slicing your flesh, as i watch your blood in my hands
anal molesting, psycho thoughts
draining your body, it feels so satisfying.

Between this walss, theres no hope, watching your life
passing by, rotted and satbbed by my hate
nailed to the wall, this torment on you is beginning.

Compulsive hate for the normal people
dying by my own terms
sense of evil
lucid dreams of my sickness
