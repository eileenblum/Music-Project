Hand of war, destroyer of worlds, I thirst for more
Abandon these forsaken ways
Blood, sweet blood
Shroud your face from this world

And I behold a sea of dead stars
Fear and pestilence, the vastness in decay
And it became that death was her name

10,000 world's erased from existence
Victims of their mortal ways
At the helm was the matron of the infinite
The decimation of their planets and empires vast
Just to watch their cities burn
And her maker blind by false love
The Secrets of the Demigods

They who are revered as the protectors of the sky
Drink from the chalice of chaos

It's known upon your face, the subject of creation
Beguiles the very fabric of your spirit with sedation
Gather all your kings and bring them to the shrine
To know the stars are forged in blood
The cosmic sea perversed

All that is created is made from dust and fire
Strife evolves the universe

Hand of war, destroyer of worlds, I thirst for more
Abandon these forsaken ways
Blood, sweet blood
Shroud your face from this world
