I enter the chamber unchallenged
Upon the great corridor, was the mother of the fiend
And behold, a child born of perdition
The world eater's apostasy

I manifest
Are you a god, no not of this world
A frail and tattered echo of this verse
Born only to die
You were born to die

Your infinity bleeds, as I rip the threads of creation
I am the scourge of the biomorphic causation
I can feel, taste, and command
The infinite, the dissonance
Of this warped dimension

I am omega
The ender absolute

I can taste the cosmic stream. With every world I eat
The sentient creatures fall beneath the shadow of my feet
I will rip the horizon from the nexus of creation
Then I, I will taste your creator

Mother of darkness
Your child craves blood
The end is conterminous
With the entropic verse

Eishar, strike down your child
As the darkness comes
For you hold the key
To our very existence

No, the night asunder
The dawn comes with eternal sleep
O' close you eyes O lover
Let the night sweep you beyond this dream
O' let me go
Sainath!
Sainath, cast away its head
Pierce the heart of the wicked
Let your soul burn, drunk with cosmic blood
Bleed O world eater
