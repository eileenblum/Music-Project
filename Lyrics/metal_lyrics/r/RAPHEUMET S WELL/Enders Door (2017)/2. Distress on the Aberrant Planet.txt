Behold a pale blue planet
Shrouded in white fog
Towards this celestial body
I've lost my blood to the stars

The aromatic atmosfear
Consternates my spirit here in
Unfamiliar disposition
Of this alabaster terrain

O I know the secret of the stars
Yet I'm lost on this planet afar

The wicked draws upon, this temptress
Her formality reveals the obscure
At last my mind knows something's amidst
Upon her essence nefarious, vampiric

â¦This creature of mysterium
â¦From bliss she seeds infliction and burns
And burns... burns

Seductress of this world enthroned
An endless gaze she holds
She looks upon my face entranced
And peers into my soul burn

The wicked draws upon, this temptress
Her formality reveals the obscure
At last my mind knows something's amidst
Upon her essence nefarious, vampiric
