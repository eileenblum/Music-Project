You're captivated by the emanating pleasure
As you're staring at the goddess of death
My immortality fascinates your senses
O' collector of the wisdom infinite

Teach me, O matron of the sapient
The lore's of the vastness divine
Pure euphoric manifestation
Duality converges entwined

I know the truth, irrefutable
Behind the innocence, a beast for flesh

Gaze upon me now
I can feel your spiritâ¦ burning
Speak my name
And you'll taste the blood of creation

My lechery brought the infernal darkness
I denied the genocide that befell upon her hands
For she knows the art of hiding her transgressions
Enticing beyond temptation

Upon these chambers, welted by her imminence
She poisons my unraveled perception
Seductress supreme, an everlasting seed
To the nature of the dark verse

Blue light of the moon
A dark flame entwines our hands
Like a serpent she moves,
Consuming my mind
O' servant of time
Speak the words to make you mine
In the flesh we merge
And infinity is yours

I can't hold on to the darkness in my soul
I am yours and you are mine
I can't hold on to the darkness in my soul
Open your mind, and the secret's yours

What have you done, you fiend, the worlds you have cursed
I see the planets bleed, countless lost to your thirst for blood

Eishar, the harbinger has come
To stain the worlds with death
