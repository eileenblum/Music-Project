For they who dwell in cosmic pits
Will remain in the hollows forever

The vestige for valiant desertion
From the bowels of the serpent's dominion

Hiding, waiting, for the darkness to
Succumb to our expedition

I striad upon the shadows,
A ghost amongst the beast

Hiding, waiting, for the darkness to
Succumb to our purpose

Fate ordain my soul and burn
Triumph eternal
Fate ordain my soul and burn
Triumph eternal

Fate you've to sought cursed me to hell

Feed, yes feast upon
The flesh of mortal tongues
The art of the snake
Luring the apostles who foul in vain

Upon this path in dread
The fear eater's scorn reigns
From the shadows a beast
A challenger to the serpents domain

Slayer, tear out its eyes
Ripping and tearing the vermin unsparing

Who is this beast of valor
O brother of blood, the guardian of the sun

"Where did you go
That time is gone forever

I was lost in in the rift
You were lost in your endeavors

Where you go I know you'll find your way
Don't forsake me now
