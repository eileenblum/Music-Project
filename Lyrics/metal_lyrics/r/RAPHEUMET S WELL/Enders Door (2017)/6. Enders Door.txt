Deep... in the well of the serpent's chamber
Anticipation it poisons my marrow
For the signal once lost it grows near
The abjuration of my reality

Through the void, beyond the dusk, I have found my redemption
At the precipice of finding truth, beyond satiety

And upon me a door for titans
So obscure, this portal with a face

Behind obsidian eyes
Is a world I have never known
Eclipsing my perception
Of the dark worlds

The door awakens
Before there were stars as you comprehend
I fed upon the waters of verse and the gods that you have come to contend
I am the truth the answer absolute
Give me the key and mastery of verse is yours

Your words are lies, iniquitous, I have found the darkness
At the precipice of finding truth, before me the ender

Beguiled by the ender
Deceived by the ender

Behind obsidian eyes
Is a world I have come to know
Eclipsing my perception
Of the enders door

Deceived am I by the harbinger of sin
The evidence conspires... against all that is
Eishar the acolyte, the creator of the door
She cuts into my spirit as she eats the heart of Xuul
