Astray I walk upon
The tattered scapes of Alal
I can feel the tainted abhorrence
Of this forsaken land

Before me is the relay to bliss
A transdimensional sphere
Yet something stirs from the shadow
The guardian of the abyss

Misfortune spoke in the tongues old
Inciting my soul's death
The serpent coils around my throat
As the watcher takes my breath

The time has finally come
For the ender sings my dirge
I can hear the screams of the hallows
The haunting sounds of the scourge

The colossus stands upon a pit of bones
Remnants of thousands lost
Ripping from their carcass, their face for mar
Yet words still spout from their mouth

Misfortune spoke in the tongues old
Inciting my soul's death
The serpent coils around my throat
As the watcher takes my breath

The time has finally come
For the ender sings my dirge
I can hear the screams of the hallows
The haunting sounds of the scourge

O guardian, keeper of this sanctum
Your very presence poisons creation
For even in death you hold their souls
A warning for those with ambition

Is this the end of my purpose
Was I a pawn of cruel fate
Yet something calls from the shadows
For me to rise

Hold on to solace
For the sky can fold
Let go your convictions
For the watchers come
