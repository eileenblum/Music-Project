I contemplate the answer to escaping this hell
Ascension beyond this dimension
The demons are screaming for the souls of the ark
I dwell in the rift of the ender

Imprisoned, imprisoned
Enslaved

Time has forgot me
My soul festers away
Devise

The method to evade and escape
Conspire
Against the wretched and extricate
Design
The stratagem to reshape
Our sovereignty

A prison made of blood and fear
Hidden in the shadows of a world lost to verse
Creatures who crossed into the cosmic well
Forever they are lost

Devise
The method to evade and escape
Conspire
Against the wretched and extricate
Design
The stratagem to reshape
Our sovereignty

I see the keeper of this pit
Demented by aeons of maleficent
As a shadow we stride
Beyond the enemy lines

Through non existence
The vile manifest
This wrathful dimension
Births death infinite

The stars calls to me
For I'm lost in the sea of sorrow
I will master this path of woe

The darkness it seems
To ride the cosmic sea forever more
As I escape into the void

I am so alone
O' I know you are gone
Yet I try
Lost in obscurity
Yet I try

Time to rise again
Yet I'm all alone
Time to find my way
To overcome

All I am is all I have
Ghost walkers exodus

Vile, wretched shades of nihility
Guardians of that which is lost
Alal, your realm stained with immortals blood
The stench of bane, warps these infinite plains

Forsake all hope who enter
