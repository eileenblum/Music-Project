Navigator of the cosmic
Vagrant of the greater verse
I have walked worlds in decimation
Recovering the ichor of gods for gold

Beneath my hands a rarity
Behold a relic of oddities
The pulsing crimson neolith
Alluring my spirit forthwith

Atramentous sphere of woe
A calamity of from the heart of the void

Cast away, I have fallen too far walk away
I traverse alone

Navigator of the cosmic
Vagrant of the greater verse
Upon this world in decimation
I hold the heart of the the gods
