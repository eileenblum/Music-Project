The sky falls,
Fragments descend upon the horizon
I curse you foolish kings, whom held the keys of calamity
The burning moon heralds our end

The night burns in fire
Our cities burned to the ground

O sovereign cretins, you have damned us to extinction
Your weapons bore to verse, a futile thirst to kill
Superior we are, to traverse the furthest stars
Yet expendable to our creation

Pandemonium
Our planet's a blaze
Time will erase our fragility

The night burns in fire
Our cities burnt to the ground

[Spoken:]
For we are done, victims of our arrogance
Yet we have a plan, to evolve our descendants

Rise, o young and vibrant ones
Time to cast you forth, to the stars furthermore
A secret we have hid from the eyes of the kings
A vessel made to cast away the flaws of our decrees
Fear all we have done
Let awareness triumph and remember to...

Evolve, evolve to set free your mind you need to
Evolve, you need to evolve, and ascend
