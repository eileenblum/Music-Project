Through the door of woe
The enders mystery
Take him into the abyss
Through the forlorned sea

I am blind
Torn from within
This chamber of fear
Soul burn
I, I am alone
Upon the unhallowed throne
The prisoner of the rift

The screams fill the aether
For he has lost his name
Wounded by the ender
A prisoner of the rift

I am blind
Torn from within
This chamber of fear
Soul burn
I, I am alone
Upon the unhallowed throne
The prisoner of the rift

O soul burn
Help for I am nothing
O my soul burns
Tear out my eyes for I nothing
