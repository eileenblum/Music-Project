Betrayal â never forgive
Backstabbing son of a bitch
Salvation is out of question â question your protection!

Broken girls - all in your sight
They cried and cried every night
Salvation is out of question â execute this coward!

Youâve burned all of your bridges
Youâve ripped up all the stitches
Salvation is out of question â I have learned my lesson!

This vermin you call a soul
Your failure turning to black
Salvation is out of question â hereâs the knife you gave me!

âDo you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?â
FUCKING YES!

Just cry wolf like you always do
Iâm the black sheep who has had enough
So help you God
So help youâ¦

Narrow myself â close the boxes
I neglect this fucking hate inside
