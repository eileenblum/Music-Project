Step through â get a piece of our anger
Retreat if you fear our rage
Get back â re-evaluate why youâre here
Your intentions are false but still quite clear
Break down â reveal what youâre hiding
If youâre lucky you might sense the truth
Coward! A mechanical plaything
Shit and glitter weâll pull you right through

Come out â weâll kill your placebo
Instinct is the key to unlock
Youâre ruining your chance to decide
Stop questioning your purpose in this life
Come out â we know that youâre scared
Weâll let you in on a secret thatâs fatal
The truth! Youâre nothing compared
This alliance makes your mind unstable

Come out â weâll kill your placebo
Inflammatory fistfight of the hideous
Come clear â come cry out your love song
Inflammatory fistfight of the hideous
