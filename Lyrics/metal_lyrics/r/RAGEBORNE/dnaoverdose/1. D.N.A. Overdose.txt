Canât remove the scars â wonât remove the scars

âIâll call you soon â Iâll keep my promise
Soon to be together â forget the past
Iâll take you to the circus â Iâll circumcise your criesâ
Of course I inhaled all these beautiful lies!
But why are you haunting me?
Why are you hunting me down?

âIâm sorry I hurt you â Iâm sorry I tried
Soon to be forever â suppress the rest
Iâll listen to your complaints and help you win the fightsâ
Of course I inhaled all these beautiful lies
But why are you haunting me?
Why are you hunting me down?

Canât remove the scars â wonât remove the scars

Soul assassination â the perfect combination
Murder â mutilation â death and devastation
Suffer as I preach â youâre left without your speech
Last sunset â last day â last breath â itâs your decay

Father why?
âYouâre just an opinion from a discussion that never took placeâ

Father â take your knives out!
