In grace of all that is sacred
I assure you; I am the way
In spite of all assassinations
I still stand here today

Don't fucking try and test me, boy
Your fall will be epic
Don't fucking try and test me, boy
Your present is past
I'm here to reclaim
What is and has always been mine
Behold thy new God-King
Don't fucking try and test me, boy
I've only just begun

When your clip is empty
And the smoke gets in your eyes
I will stand stronger
On the other side
Of your lies - I am Fearmonger
And you'll bow your head in awe
For I will reign this wasteland
For as long as I can breathe
For as long as I can breathe

And you have tried to turn the masses
Against what is inevitable
But your treason
Is brought to just with
This lyrical death sentence

Don't fucking try and test me, boy
Your fail is legendary
Don't fucking try and test me, boy
Your past is long forgotten
I'm here to reclaim
What is and has always been mine
You spineless little cunt
Don't fucking try and test me, boy
I'll hang you from your guts

When your clip is empty
And the smoke gets in your eyes
I will stand stronger
On the other side
Of your lies - I am Fearmonger
And you'll bow your head in awe
For I will reign this wasteland
For as long as I can breathe
For as long as I can breathe

Realize, this legion
Will trample through your
Little tea party
Your kind is not kind to me
At all, so I will
Personally cut you a
Life-long smile
Ear to fucking ear
(You worthless little bitch)
Ear to fucking ear
Ear to fucking ear
Ear to fucking ear

Ear to fucking ear
Ear to fucking ear
