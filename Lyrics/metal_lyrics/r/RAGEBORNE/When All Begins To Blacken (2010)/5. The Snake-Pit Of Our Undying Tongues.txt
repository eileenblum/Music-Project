Here they go again
With no bullets in
The six-shooters they carry
Here they go again
Trying to be God
But they will be overthrown

The feathers are soaked in blood
As the wicked of tomorrow
Hiss and sneak upon the throne
The city is in flames
Hear the citizens cry
Watch the burning sky
As it kiss your lips goodbye

The gunslingers are shooting blanks
In this snake pit
Of our undying tongues
Who will bring the ropes
The sticks, the gasoline?
You will never see the light of day

They infest the land
As we watch this nine to five battle
For the last minute of fame
Oh, what a beautiful night
To turn down the lights

The gunslingers are shooting blanks
In this snake pit
Of our undying tongues
Who will bring the ropes
The sticks, the gasoline?
You will never see the light of day

Even if you tried
You could never ever become
The muse you've been searching for
So why even bother
Creating your own art at all?
Because you will never see
The light of day
No, you will never see
The light of day
You will never see
The light of day

The inspiration
Will turn in its grave
Due to your falsehood
It'll be forgotten

Never underestimate the power of
The genocide produced by your sloth
And you will behold the stage
Of all your dreams
Crash and burn along with the remains
Of this fucking masquerade 
You will never be the carrier
Of the flag you hold so dear
Because a bitch like you
Is never wanted here

The gunslingers are shooting blanks
In this snake pit
Of our undying tongues
Who will bring the ropes
The sticks, the gasoline?
You will never see the light of day
