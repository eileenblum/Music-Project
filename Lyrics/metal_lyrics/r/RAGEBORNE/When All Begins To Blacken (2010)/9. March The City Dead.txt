Forever cold and staled
The masses clap their hands
Nostalgic they scream for more
No need for eradication
Simultaneously
They all fall to their knees
Smashing their closed fists
At the concrete

[2x:]
Oh, here they come
Sounding the trumpet of our ignorance
So clap your hands

All their necks laid on their
Back with black-eyed creed
Depraved, still smiling
Ear to ear
Exposing yellow snake tongues
They join hands and
Kiss the sky for countless answers
Silent
Inferior they march the city dead

[2x:]
Oh, here they come
Sounding the trumpet of our ignorance
So clap your hands

[2x:]
If you see the difference
Then you will pay the consequence

Oh, here they come
Sounding the trumpet of our ignorance
So clap your hands

From the ruins a new king will rise
Killing you and your unimportance
