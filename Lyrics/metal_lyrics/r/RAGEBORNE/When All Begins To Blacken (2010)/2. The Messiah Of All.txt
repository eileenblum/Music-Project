The Messiah of all
Speaks six different languages
I pretend I don't feel the coping
As it hits my face
Wondering if Hell is waiting
For my war on God

Are you really justifying
This coward's kiss?
Point the blame
And let your middle finger
Fuck the rest
We will all seize to exist

Are you really justifying
This coward's kiss?
Point the blame
And let your middle finger
Fuck the rest
We will all seize to exist
Taste my coward kiss

Maybe this is the only epiphany
We'll live to see
The truth before us and the shame
That follows it
And it makes me wonder
With the hammer pulled back

Are you really justifying
This coward's kiss?
Point the blame
And let your middle finger
Fuck the rest
We will all seize to exist

Are you really justifying
This coward's kiss?
Point the blame
And let your middle finger
Fuck the rest
We will all seize to exist
Taste my coward kiss

[Solo]

Here's to spontaneous apathy
And restless lack of insight
I'm a cynical waste of time
But this is safe
This is safe and I'll fuck you over
At first given chance

Are you really justifying
This coward's kiss?
Point the blame
And let your middle finger
Fuck the rest
We will all seize to exist

Are you really justifying
This coward's kiss?
Point the blame
And let your middle finger
Fuck the rest
We will all seize to exist
Taste my coward kiss
