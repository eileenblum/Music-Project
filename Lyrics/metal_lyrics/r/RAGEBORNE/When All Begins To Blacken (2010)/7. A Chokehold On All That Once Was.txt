A coma of dying lies through deceit
The ignorance of the fool has appeared

When happiness
Becomes a discrete solitude
The sun will melt and erase all stars
A glimpse of light and what once was
An infinite shadow
This hope will exclude

A book never opened
As the story remains
The dust on its fingers
Is mud in the rain
The dust on its fingers
Is mud in the rain
All hail neglection

A book never opened
As the story remains
The dust on its fingers
Is mud in the rain
The dust on its fingers
Is mud in the rain

Knives in the ribs
And conscience of truth
The sun will eventually glow within
Burn, baby, burn
An infidel dies
Resurrection, no time for prelude

A book never opened
As the story remains
The dust on its fingers
Is mud in the rain
The dust on its fingers
Is mud in the rain
All hail neglection

As the story remains
The dust on its fingers
Is mud, mud in the rain

[Personal hate rant:]
A tide to drown the face
The face of God and his angels
A flood of sin and disbelief
What will become?
What will be unsaid?
Who will return and ring the bell?
What will become?
What will be unsaid?
Who will return and ring the bell?

[2x:]
What will become?
What will be unsaid?
Who will return and ring the bell?

Tight the noose around its neck
Because better safe than sorry
(Hahahaha)
Sorry, fucker
