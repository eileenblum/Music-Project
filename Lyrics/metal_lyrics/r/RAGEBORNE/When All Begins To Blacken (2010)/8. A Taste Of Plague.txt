The living dead
Shall walk the earth again

Stench from the broken graves
A taste of death and hate
With yellow skies and black rain
They enter the world again

Ready to feast and mutilate
They wonder through the night
An unholy army is roaming the earth
And it's breathing disease
Through it's rotten throat

With melted eyes and a taste of plague
They kiss the night of death
At the stroke of midnight
They point their broken fingers
And gaze upon the city of lights

The sound of a distant thunder
Made by this swarm of living dead
Do not disturb the sleeping children
Safe and sound they dream of God
On this night where the angels fled

There will be no tomorrow
There will be no tomorrow
With yellow skies and black rain
They begin to rule again

They are the dead and fallen
Kings of terror
Pray for your own tomorrow for
They surely will turn all of your kind

With melted eyes and a taste of plague
They kiss the night of death
At the stroke of midnight
They point their broken fingers
And gaze upon the city of lights

The sound of a distant thunder
Made by this swarm of living dead
Do not disturb
The motherfucking sleeping children

The screams of a mother
Awakens the city
To join her living hell
Cannibalizing the rattling throats
Of her daughter and son

Whilst their lumpy-fleshed hands
Silence her screams
They corrode the bowels
Of their half-eaten bodies

And leave them dead
For the world to see
Alone and disgraceful
She drowns in the blood
Of her children's torn out hearts
