The love story was
Staled and ugly
And every beauty was a two-faced plague
The velvet gloves got
Torn apart and this Pandora
Could not be closed
With black eyes and a crooked agony
Smile, I gazed unto
What seemed oblivious
I gazed unto what seemed so oblivious

Perceptions and indifference
This scenario is undisputed
uncompromising words
Killed all excuses

Brown eyes and a silver kiss
How the fuck could I be so blind?
The Goddess was right
Behind your smile

Brown eyes and a silver kiss
How the fuck could I be so blind?
The crusade is over
And the crown is mine

Together we can show the rest
That everything will end
Everything will end but this

Mirrors to reflect the burn
Watch it grow on your skin
Through pain redemption will
Save this forever

Brown eyes and a silver kiss
How the fuck could I be so blind?
The Goddess was right
Behind your smile

Brown eyes and a silver kiss
How the fuck could I be so blind?
The crusade is over
And the crown is mine

I will never leave your side, my dear
I will kiss away every tear
And shatter the burdens
You might bear
I promise you, my love:
Your diamonds shall never bleed again
I promise you that your diamonds
Shall never ever bleed again

Never bleed again
Never bleed again

With this song I will tell them all
Just what I see
In your diamond eyes only cut for me

Brown eyes and a silver kiss
How the fuck could I be so blind?
The Goddess was right
Behind your smile

Brown eyes and a silver kiss
How the fuck could I be so blind?
The crusade is over
And the crown is mine
