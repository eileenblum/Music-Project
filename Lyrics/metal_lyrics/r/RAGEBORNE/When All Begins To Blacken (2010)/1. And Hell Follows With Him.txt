[Fire burning, woman screaming:]
No, no

The scent of whiskey pulled my arm
Already drunk on you
I entered the bar
As you turned the key
To room number two
I got liquid eyes
And forgot all about you
And boy, if I only knew

[4x:]
Yeah, you did all that I told you
It's not the fucking same

After fifth bottom of my glass
Raindrops  fell from the ceiling
The taste of salt reminded me
But as I turned I met his eyes
Became death to your cries
I became death to your cries

[4x:]
Yeah, you did all that I told you
It's not the fucking same

Why the fuck
Would I dance with anyone
But the devil, bitch?
Because I...
I'm invited to
Open bar in Hell all night

[4x:]
Yeah, you did all that I told you
It's not the fucking same
