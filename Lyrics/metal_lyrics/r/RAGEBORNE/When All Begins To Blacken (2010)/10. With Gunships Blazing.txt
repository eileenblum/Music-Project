Once again
This ten ton hate machine is
Starting fires with heavy artillery
Once again
This warfare of just is trampling
Through the bones
Of the dead and fallen

A rain of soot
And sulphur is blackening
The face of synchronic idolatry
A stench of
Insubordination is
Hanging over this battlefield

Hypnotized
By the rhythm of the war drum
They count the hellfire rounds
Hypnotized
By the rhythm of the war drum
They count the shells on the ground
Run for cover

Once again
We steal and rape and kill on
This, our crusade for kingdom come
Once again
The sky will bleed with oil
From our black hawk
As it claws grab your throat
And destroy the tunnel
Of which you've paced
Your horrible sell-out through
And perfect the empire
We've created through your death

Hypnotized
By the rhythm of the war drum
They count the hellfire rounds
Hypnotized
By the rhythm of the war drum
They count the shells on the ground

One by one they fall

Gather the turned
Show them the corpse
Let them place the silver coins
Drown the king's horses in the sea
And pray for his journey

This sacrifice will carry your soul
Safe and sound
Amongst the crashing waves
Put to rest in the arms of Poseidon
As we watch you float away
Watch you float away
Watch you float away

[Solo/Outro]
Watch you float away
Watch you float away
Watch you float away
Watch you float away
Watch you float away
