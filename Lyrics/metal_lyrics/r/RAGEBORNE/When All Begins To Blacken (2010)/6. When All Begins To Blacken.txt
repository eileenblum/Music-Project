Even when it all seems to cherish
The Pandora in you knows nothing
But to perish everything
In fucking sight

You've proven no different
To the stage infected fuck-up sluts
You've proven no different
To the fact that I saw you as one
You're nothing
But a fucking waste of time
You're nothing
But a fucking waste of time

Is it possible that your worth
Lies buried
Deep within your plastic smile
As you pose for me
With guilt and grief

You've proven no different
To the stage infected fuck-up sluts
You've proven no different
To the fact that I saw you as one
You're nothing
But a fucking waste of time
You're nothing
But a fucking waste of time

When it all begins to blacken
And of whatever may have been
Know that I have to do this to kill
Off your every fucking impact
And whatever you might think
I'm not your fucking friend
So just do your thing
And fuck everyone
For I will be in the back
Waiting for your fall
And by every God
Every one always will
And by every God
Every one always will
Watch your cunt decompose

When it all begins to blacken
And of whatever may have been
Know that I have to do this to kill
Off your every scent
From your devious body
Before I drown in the poisonous fluids 
From the lower part of you
As I pass your ass back the stage
