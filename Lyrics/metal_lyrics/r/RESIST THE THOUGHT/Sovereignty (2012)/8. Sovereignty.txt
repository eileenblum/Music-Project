how long will they reign supreme
unhallowed rulers of society
faceless fiends 
leading us blindly into slavery    

meticulously manipulating modern man
like drones we march
dehumanised at the wave of a hand

for how long will we be dictated by this monopoly, this hypocrisy?
for how long will we be living in oblivion?
how does it feel to know that we will never know the truth?

a systematic suppression
particularly plotted to ensure that we live in oppression
that we obey
that we conform
malcontent life of default
fuck that I say that we fight 

revolt, remove the shackles that keep us in the shadows
this is a counter-revolution
free those consumed in gallows

revolt, remove the shackles that keep us in the shadows
our extinction is inevitable
until we control the factions 

how long will they reign
you live a life of a lie
if you conceal all this horror
and just let it go by   

distracted by whats portrayed
as normality is in fact
morality defamed     

for how long will we be dictated by this monopoly, this hypocrisy?
meticulously manipulating modern man
for how long will we be living in oblivion? for how long will we wait?
like drones we march
dehumanised at the wave of a hand 

how does it feel to know that we will never know the truth?
how does it feel to know that we have been betrayed?
