spawned from the blackest abyss
a realm that is not of this earth
exist a species consumed with avarice and power
and a motive to enslave mankind

with haste they approach us; earthbound
infinite craving for our souls
a harvest of earth is their objective
impending planetary infiltration is upon us all

we face an ultimatum
unite and fight
or face obliteration
we hold the fate of our species

an Invasion is imminent
the stars have aligned
vicious, vile, hateful beings
starving to drink our blood

we face an ultimatum
Unite and fight
or face obliteration
We hold the fate of our species
And bear the bloodline
Forever doomed to walk the earth alone
