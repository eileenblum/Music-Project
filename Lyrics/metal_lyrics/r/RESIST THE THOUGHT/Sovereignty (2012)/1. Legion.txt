I smell the fear of death lingering in the air tonight
a world we once called home now infected by parasites
we march forward to our mortality one by one

beware the trumpet sounds
this plague has been unleashed upon this bloodshed town
you face extermination, so we prepare for war
if we don't save ourselves we'll perish in the storm

I, I fight for glory
marching the desolate wastelands of earth
I, I fight for grievance
like wolves we hunger for the flesh of mankind

nowhere to run
your demise has begun
the prophets warned that this day would come
where the sky will fall in flames and the demon grows in lust
all things that breath will turn to dust

I've become an abomination
craving the blood of the mutilated
consumed by greed, and I'm fuelled by hatred
I'll take the fate of an entire nation

so save yourself
the prophets warned that this day would come

I smell the fear of death lingering in the air tonight
the dark, the cold, the hollow souls of the darkest lords are bleeding humanity dry

such a desolate wasteland
where the angels reduced to a fiend
a perfect setting for an apocalyptic scene

and I the tyrant would descend upon the earth
to burn the kingdom and release the truth
