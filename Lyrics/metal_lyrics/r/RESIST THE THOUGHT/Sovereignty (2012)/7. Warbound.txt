we are the nation of outcasts
crying out for vengeance
when the clock strikes 12
we strike first; war bound
it's about time that they feel our wrath

we the people possess the power
to dictate the course of our history
the supremacy deemed powerless
as citizens abandon orthodoxy

citizens of humankind unite
together we will prevail
this is not a protest
this is a fucking guarantee
it will end for us with victory

open your eyes
this is not an attempt to reform
when the clock strikes 12
a new chapter is born

warbound

this is a metamorphosis
a new age of liberty
we are the rebellion
set to overthrow the dynasty
we are the generation
to bring upon the change
we are the insurrection
this is the dawn of a new supremacy
