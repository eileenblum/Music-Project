repugnant presence concealed within our immortal monarch
inherit to the throne built of the loathsome truth that we all harbor

our breed will manifest the means to abort any plans of wealth
destructive minds combine to separate us from our own selves

dispose of those
who are entitled to
any means created by man
masquerader with intent to defile our fate

we will ensure your end is a heinous act 
witnessed by the insurrectionists who contend

compassion has no place in this realm
bereavement litters every street
with precedented perception of this world

agonizing sights repel the hope of a new dawn
from the blood of men who've fallen a messianic plague, reborn

undignified promises projected from a past we once called home
reminiscent of a time where the power had a soul

the reality of the un-constituted warfare 
spawns from that of hate

how long will it take to conquer
our fear of our own termination?
manipulating everything in our power to overcome
synthetic entities conflict with those who demand freedom

a plague reborn
