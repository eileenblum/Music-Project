Reflections so clear
So visible in sight
We are hiding in darkness, trying to seek light
For we are the ones who speak in tongues

Casting shadows amongst the fallen, the sacred, the unholy ones
We are the ones that are defiled forever,
We are the ones that fight for fury for your forsaken blood
We battle forward just to see, that we'll unite as one

To conquer what is to become
Bring forth the last battle for redemption
Right from the start, bring back the blood of the most forsaken torturous one
Pray to live forever

Immortality is gained by unholy gods
Pray to be forgotten
Itâs the beginning of a haunted nightmare
Pray to live forever

Immortality is gained by unholy gods
Pray to be forgotten
Itâs the beginning of a haunted nightmare
We are the most vigorous ones

Through all we battle as one
We cast no reflections
For we have lost our souls
Lost!

Wake up!
And you will see, itâs just another nightmare
Watch as we wake up the world [4x]
We are the most vigorous ones

Through all we battle as one
We cast no reflections
For we have lost our souls
This was all a dream

We will never hold the key
This was all a dream
We will never hold the key
To immortality

This is the end of exile
This is the end of existence
This is the end of exile
This is the end of existence
