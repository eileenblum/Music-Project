I watched the world burn before my eyes

As I walk this dreaded blackened path to see
that we have risen, from something more than youâve become.
The devil said, âBe careful what you seek tonight,
one thousand lies will determine if you live or fucking die.â

We will rise, they shall fall, they shall die

We will rise; they shall fall into the darkest depths of hell

Fuck you
We will never be rectified, from your re-incarnated sin

We will watch the tide
It swallows you whole

We fight, we die, we will become immortal
We fight, we die, together as one

As I walk this dreaded blackened path to see
that we have risen, from something more than youâve become.
The devil said, âBe careful what you seek tonight,
one thousand lies will determine if you live or fucking die.â

We fight, we die, we will become immortal
We fight, we die, together as one
