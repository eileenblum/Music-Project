For far too long we have lived the lives of slaves,
tormented and diseased, shackled and chained,
tortured and bound to the brink of our self destruction

Destroying precious life, youâve just started chaos, this isnât the end.
Youâre a plague; youâre a pestilence to the world.
We feel the fear of the enemies that lie ahead.
The stench of death, it fills the air.
Fearless and powerful
WE STAND.

We fight for salvation, we fight.
We fight to free ourselves from damnation
Youâre the oppressors, bleeding us dry, wounding our brothers,
taking our way of life, our way of life.

This unforgettable deed will not go unpunished
Staring into the eyes of a traitor a sea of malice runs through my veins
This unforgettable deed will not go unpunished
Weâll exterminate their kingdom, weâll decimate their throne

Hide in the hills, cover up your eyes
For the reaper awaits you

Running from regrets to see this place battered down
With hatred and self greed
Never to return again for we have found new life,
standing on the edge of a vigorous creation

Remembered not as a god but a slave, a servant, a coward to the world
This will not end on shaking hands

This is damnation, blood will be shed
This is damnation, our revenge will come as planned

I do declare that this is war; this will not end on shaking hands
The battlefield, the life that you always dreamt of wasnât real
I do declare that this is war; this will not end on shaking hands
Blood will be shed, pain will be had, you fight for damnation

This unforgettable deed will not go unpunished
Staring into the eyes of a traitor a sea of malice runs through my veins
This unforgettable deed will not go unpunished
Weâll exterminate their kingdom, weâll decimate their throne
