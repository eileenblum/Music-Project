Held my head high, swore to the sky
That Iâd stand and Iâd fight and Iâd die for my pride
No remorse for the weak, you are all I despise
Held my head high, swore to the sky
That Iâd stand and Iâd fight and Iâd die for my pride
Your legacy will be mine

I would drain myself of all my blood and spew the air from my lungs
Before I die a death of disgrace
Blessed be thy martyr, cursed be the one drenched in blood
Indulged in their own suffering

There is blood on their hands, for they are the ones we will forget.

Before were condemned to the grave, like martyrs we will not be saved
This legacy will be mine, forever you have my pride
Forever you will be mine

Consume me in fire and flames,
My body will burn but my legacy will remain.

Because of you we have suffered, we have sinned
The gates of hell will swing upon the hinge
The distance between you and me will be

Forever we will reign as martyrs
Forever we will remain as martyrs

Before were condemned to the grave, like martyrs we will not be saved
This legacy will be mine, forever you have my pride
Forever you will be mine
