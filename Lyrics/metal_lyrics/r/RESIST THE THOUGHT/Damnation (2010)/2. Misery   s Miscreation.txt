The stench of humankind reeks of hatred, malice, corruption and greed.
Youâre the infection, the plague, the epidemic that poisoned the child, defiled the slaves.

Worthless servant to the coin, polluting all in your path
Wealth is a crude religion condemning you to a life of treachery.

Traitor, you betrayed us all, even the kings will fall.

Donât mistaken what youâve done to me. Youâre all full of lies.

I will be your defeat, will be your demise.

Money hungry swine, how can you put a price on your pride?
Repress your possessions and end this obsession
Few can be praised without falsehood.

Wealth is no measure of man, but a scope into their ability
to corrupt and betray, divulge and decay their souls.

Youâre the miscreated ones and I despise you

Traitor, you betrayed us all, even the kings will fall

Miseryâs Miscreation, you will be our demise

I have lost all faith in humanity, fueled by corruption hate and greed.
Forsaken is the ground we tread, for we are the walking dead.

You are miseryâs miscreation
