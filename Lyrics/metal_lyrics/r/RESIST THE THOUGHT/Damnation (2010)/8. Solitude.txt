Solitude, you are living a lie,
merely existing rather than living your life.
Why would you fight to survive when you have no reason to stay alive?
Solitude.

Watch as you plunge into the depths of your despair
Until your lungs are filled with hatred and you suffocate.
Stare at the walls; they slowly close in around you
confine you to isolation.
This creature that youâve becomeâ¦

You are living a lie

This creature youâve become swallows your entire being
Filled with hate, malice and repugnance

Such an empty life, a hollow existence
Only flesh and bone, youâre purely wretched.
Fight a worthless war abandoned cause
Make a stand for your life

Justify why youâre alive

Solitude, you are living a lie,
merely existing rather than living your life.
Why would you fight to survive when you have no reason to stay alive?
Solitude.

Hold your heart in your hands
Press it tightly against your chest
Protect it with all that you have
