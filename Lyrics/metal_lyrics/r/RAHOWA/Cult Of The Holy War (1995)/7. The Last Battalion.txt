Carpe diem, delenda est judaica ...

Dreadful legions march with doom,
Dark force under winter moon;
Army of the righteous cause,
Legacy written in the stars.

Ashes smolder with untamed fire,
Waiting for ascension;
Onslaught rising from the mire,
Destined for redemption.

Praytell the sacred lore,
The dark side is keeping score,
The battle fought once more,
The cult of the holy war ...

Shrieking winds of forgotten souls,
Born again from unquenched coals;
Death - he rides a furious stallion,
At the fore of the last battalion ...
Winter night of feverish hate,
Epoch of confusion;
Steel crashes chaotic state,
Blood spills life infusion.
