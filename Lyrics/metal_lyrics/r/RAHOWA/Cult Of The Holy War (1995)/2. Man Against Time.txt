In your heart you felt the cause of our age,
In your moment of glory at the crest of the wave,
Like a comet you burned, like a tempest you raged,
As a hero of the people you suffered to save.
As a man against time in a world so bizarre,
In the myst of tomorrow you shine like a star;
In the vision of legends and martyrs afar,
Like a prophet and soldier we know who you are.

Oh, man against time
You lived and then you fought until you died just for your kind,
Oh man against time
Oh man against time
Wherever that I go in life I swear you're on my mind,
Oh man against time, oh man...

Like the soul that cries forth in its hour of pain,
Like the cloud that gives life to the field with its rain;
For the hope and the legacy of a race born again,
Destiny called you to rise above men.
And up did you rise, and a hero was born,
A man that we love, and cherish, and mourn;
A legend in time, a bringer of storm,
A vanguard of promise in a world that we scorn.

Oh, man against time
You lived and then you fought until you died just for your kind,
Oh man against time oh man against time
Wherever that I go in life I swear you're on my mind,
Oh man against time, oh man...

And for every white man in touch with your dream;
As the nightmare unfolds and the white children scream.
You were baptized in flames, you died to defend,
In the fire that claimed you, clutching faith 'till the end.
I will hold your brave memory alive in my soul,
I will teach your proud name to all that I know,
I will live to complete the task you began,
As a worthy and righteous and noble white man.

Oh, man against time
You lived and then you fought until you died just for your kind,
Oh man against time oh man against time -
Wherever that I go in life I swear you're on my mind,
Oh man against time, oh man...

And if the day dawns when our people are free:
Free to rejoice, to be proud and believe;
You will be like a god unto our fair kind,
Robert Mathews: the man against time.
