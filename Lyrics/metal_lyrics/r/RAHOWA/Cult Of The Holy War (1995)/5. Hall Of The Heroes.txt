Our fight was a fight to the death,
We stood as our comrades fell;
Our legacy to the men of the past,
Whose great sacrifice our skalds must now tell ...

Welcome warriors, to the hall of the heroes,
Gather in victory as we stand side by side,
Welcome warriors, to the hall of the heroes,
Gather in unity, and reborn is our pride ...

Our war was a war to claim life,
For our folk we fought and bled,
Our destiny was to stand here today,
To pay tribute to the living and the dead ...

And our names shall be written in the stars,
The brave soldiers who fought in the holy war!
The glorious future shall owe its birth
To those who walked the path of darkness
So the world could be born again ...
