Its been a long time since i spoke of this to you
I kept it all inside denying what you knew
And for a second i thought maybe we could work it out
Your fucking ignorant and vain as you allow
So here's what I'm about to do
To break you of your habit
First ill stop being nice to you
And then let you have it
You fucking waste of life
You have no place (IN MY HEART)
I hope you find some light
Before you fall apart
Your life is exposed
And everyone knows
Your a cheap skank with poor morals
Now I'm ashamed to say that we were a "thing"
and i wish i could've stop it from happening
It makes me want to blow my brains out
GAME OVER
