First they took our freedom
By limiting our rights
We did nothing to them
So why distort our lives?
No one has the answer anymore
No council in the sky
No reason we should die
Was it to herd us to an end?
Trap and extinguish
Destroy me from inside
The master genocide
Wake the fuck up, you don't know a thing
Don't you wonder? Words will be no key
We don't know how we got here and we lost the urge to care
We're fading into the abyss now..
We need to form a plan
We must attack as one - destroy the upper hand
