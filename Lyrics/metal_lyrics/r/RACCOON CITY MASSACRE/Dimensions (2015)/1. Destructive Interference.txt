With my hands held to the sky
I scream like the world is falling apart
For all the times i just let you cry
This is the hell that lives in..
Are you listening
I can feel things too
I am capable of understanding
A trait i cant seem to master
And when that music comes
I will face that noise
I'll decide when to pull that plug
I will tell you when to burn that bridge
Just because its not easy
Don't give up completely
I'm screaming at the mirror
..And all i feel is numb
Are you whispering?
your not cutting through
one day ill be understanding
and we'll avoid disaster
And when i hear those drums
Sanity destroyed
ill tell them all just to pull that plug
the wrath of hell will engulf that bridge
