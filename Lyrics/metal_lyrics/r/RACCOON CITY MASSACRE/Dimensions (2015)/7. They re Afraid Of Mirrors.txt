Come on (LETS GO) What are you waiting for?
there are no invitations, only destruction for the weak
Its been going on for years, like worms coming up beneath our feet
They're coming up from the ground
And moving in from all around
Back when you thought i was crazy, i bet you wish you'd listened to me then
Still i dare not laugh in the state your in, again i let you in
I will be strong for us all
All though the sun will set, It will rise again
Fuck those figures of light
Let the war bird soar
We wont give up on hope
When you ignore our words
Then you will know how we fight
No longer will i float inside the sea of your deception
Just to be drowned by your synthetic waves
We cannot live like drones, slaves in a hopeless world
Is there a window of reality? Only tapped through spirituality
As we open the door, we breath in the air
We find ourselves cornered with no way out
So don't be afraid this is not the end
You remain in my dreams i will see you again
