Such a tragic end to this summer tale
Freezes me within and cause my heart to fail
Is this what they call a heart Attack?
Or is my heart under attack?
Emotional absence is a way to kill
It breaks the weak and destroys the ill
Pray for an end that may never come
Bring back the time when we where one
The further we are the closer we get
I won't let you forget, And if you stay..
So goes on the tale of a broken sun lighting the way
For a thousand stars as it leads our life through the voids
Of endless, undeserved, organic love
I saw the end, I couldn't look away
Nor could i comprehend the beauty of an endless love
Are we not the ones
Who take it all at once
We rape the source and then we leave whats left t those undone
