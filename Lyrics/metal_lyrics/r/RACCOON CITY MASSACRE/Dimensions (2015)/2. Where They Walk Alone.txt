Don't run, don't hide
Because your soul is mine
"I have done nothing wrong"
Is the cry of the guilty one
(Face it) No one's coming to save you now
(Save us) you will Scream
Come one come all, this is the answer
To your pain
I will wait till the clock strikes night for her
I am plagued with the curse you will endure
Because these cant be cured
This scarlet lace will seal our fate tonight
(will seal our fate tonight)
You'll be marked where there is nothing left
I've come too far to loose this,
make them drown, make them drown
No one's coming to save you now
Save us you will scream
Two pits, one curse ; Wallow in sin
Perhaps its time to die
No Ones coming to save us now
Save us you will scream
This scarlet lace will seal our fate tonight
So take my hand, we will walk through
The depth of hell
Where they walk alone
THEY WILL FALL
So take my hand
