[Hidden Track]You think your ready for this life?
Are you prepared for the lies?
You need to break free
From the things that bring you misery
Tonight you need to let the fire burn
And find a better way
You hide behind your eyes
You die inside your mind
Its not all your fault
Things fall apart and the ashes surround you
Take a deep breath an close your eyes
Every exit is an entrance
Into some social sideshow
Of bullshit to extremity
As sons of the light we owe more than we own
Our life is as real as those ones carved into stone
BUILD, RISE, WAR, Lets do it again
