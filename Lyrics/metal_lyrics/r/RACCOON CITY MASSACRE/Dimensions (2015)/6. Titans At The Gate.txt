What a deadly surprise
On the day you arrived
You took the fear from my eyes
Along with innocent lives
This towering flesh with lust for blood
Seeking out my friends with no need to consume
Its just mindless murder i cant let them hurt her
WE WILL UNITE
WE WILL ATTACK (YOU)
I'm closer than you feel, I worse than you think
I let it consume me and then it became me
and changed the fate of our own
I was never alone
Now come along for the ride
Not even shadows could hide
From the horror your eyes will embrace
DEATH COMES AS NO SURPRISE
Its been fed to our eyes, The death of innocent lives
When will you wake up, when will you see?
That your not the only one who wants to be free
