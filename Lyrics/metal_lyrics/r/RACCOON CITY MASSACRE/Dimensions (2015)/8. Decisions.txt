And its true, that only time will tell
Only time will tell..
I cant focus on the prize
My mind is lost somewhere in time
The truth is fading with each blink
I CANT FUCKING FOCUS
When i gave myself to this i knew
That i could take on anything you threw
Sitting silent with an empire of memories
As i walk through hell i face my enemies
I hate to do this on my own
I face it alone
The morning star guides me again
(When will i understand)
I'm Sick of the lies you painted for my eyes
(When will i understand)
I swear
That i gave everything inside me to you
Fucking wasted my time
In the safe-boat of our silence
Our friendship is sinking..
As i fade to the bottom
The story plays again and again
What would i have done different
And what difference would it make
We can change our destiny
In this life, there are no second chances
We are a product of our own decisions
(where are you now,
you got me into this,
please help me escape!)
I swear that i gave everything inside me
To you
Now there is nothing left
