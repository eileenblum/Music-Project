From dark Dunharrow in the dim morning
With thane and captain rode Thengel's son:
To Edoras he came, the ancient halls

Of the Mark-wardens mist-enshrouded;
Golden timbers were in gloom mantled.
Farewell he bade to his free people,
Hearth and high-seat, and the hallowed places,

Fate before him. Fealty kept he;
Oaths he had taken, all fulfilled them.
Forth rode ThÃ©oden. five nights and days
East and onward rode the Eorlingas
Through Folde and Fenmarch and the Firienwood,

Six thousand spears to Sunlending,
Mundburg the mighty under Mindolluin,
Sea-kings; city in the South-kingdom
Foe-beleaguered, fire-encircled.

Doom drove them on. Darkness took them,
Horse and horseman; hoofbeats afar
Sank into silence; so the songs tell us.
