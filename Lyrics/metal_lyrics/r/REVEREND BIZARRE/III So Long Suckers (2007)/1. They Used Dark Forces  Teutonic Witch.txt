You say that I am evil, but you don't know where I have been
If you could see some of those places, I bet you would be worse than me
Oh you can say that I am drowning, but you should have seen me when I was alright
I am done with your pity, so (now) "Thank you and good night"

I still have my wheels rolling, but the engine is old and petrol is low
Don't put your weight on me. This burden of life you wouldn't know
You can keep the distance, baby, I don't need you or those of your kind
I will leave this world alone. I am not able to ease your mind

You say that I am evil, but you don't know where I have been
If you could see some of those places, I bet you would be worse than me
But there is one thing I want you to know: Avoid those who gather at night
The forces they use are dark. They would swallow you without a bite

Caress me now, this last time
As you know I have to go away
I will go to some distant place
I don't want to see you anymore
Because your beauty makes me tremble a new
Woman no more shall I live as your slave

You, you took my heart away
Took it away and left only emptiness
Woman, oh it will never heal again
Sore I am, fallen down on my knees
You want me to bow to you, that I will do but I swear, this is the last time

Witch, that is what you are, making me long for you this way.
I taste your sword of understanding
Mouthful of metal until I bleed. You will let me down.
Tooth and claw, with a razorblade I cut my veins.
With my blood we toast (for) the Iron Law

Bring back my heart. You don't need it now
I've gone so far. I am lost somehow
I've been away so long, hard to find a place
I try to look ahead, but I am lost without a trace

Even when it's gone, hear what I have to say
You can't ignore the past. No use to run away
I clean all my wounds. My will is still of steel
The years that I have lost can't change the way I feel
