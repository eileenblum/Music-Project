Lying on my bed alone in the dead of the night
Torturing myself with thoughts of her
Like a silent breeze of poisonous air, the sorrow comes

All those memories of better times fill my mind
How little I understood back in those days
Now, when all is gone, I see the value of everything that I have lost

Still, her eyes are haunting me when I try to sleep
In the silence of the night, I hear her voice
I know the day won't that I am done with this longing

A night like this, I wish I could find my way out of this world
No matter how hard I try to forget and clear my mind
The sorrow comes

The sorrow of being left behind
The sorrow of the destroyed dream
The sorrow when all trust is gone
The sorrow giving birth to the will to die

Ooh, I know I should move forward and give something new a chance
But I am unable to break these bonds of what once used to be
Sometimes I can't help thinking there is only one way out
Through my own sorry death, in the hands of Azrael
