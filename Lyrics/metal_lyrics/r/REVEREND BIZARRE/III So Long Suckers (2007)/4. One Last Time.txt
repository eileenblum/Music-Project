I have heard the war is coming. I am ready and willing to fight
For one last time I need your lovin'. Won't you warm my lonely night ?
Many good men before me have gone to serve their lands, sacrificing their lives
Years have passed, remembrance lives on, all the tears of mothers and wives

If I die and never return, will you come and seek my grave ?
Maybe one candle there will burn, in memorium of a soldier so brave
If it's the war we are heading towards, all the more I need your love
