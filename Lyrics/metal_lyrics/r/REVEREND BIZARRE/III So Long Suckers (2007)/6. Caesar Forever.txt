Here I wait, in the shadows
Raise my two bloody hands
In the center of a circle, bodies joint in deadly dance
I have killed with my brothers
By my hand the weak must die
We leave a trail of lonely mothers, who mourn their martyrs side by side

The ruler of this holy city, respected till the end of time
Reluctant to show his pity when religion turns to crime
They believed in the virgin mother, for that they must be crucified
They cannot love any other
Elder gods they left behind

Those who are about to die, make sure that you will learn
Trumpets sing and children cry when fires of Mars will burn
Christs may come and Christs may go, but Caesar is forever
Come, my son, and you shall know: Tonight we hunt together !
