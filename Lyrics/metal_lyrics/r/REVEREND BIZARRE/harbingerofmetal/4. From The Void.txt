From the Void I call you
As a master of secret knowledge
Receive my gift of magic
And you see the world through the eyes of a witch
We will walk together
Under the shelter of the secret name of God
Everyone will fear us
For they know we are about to suck their blood
Hear my call
I am coming to you
Spread your wings
Let it be true
