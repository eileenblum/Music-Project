Baby donÂ´t be afraid even though itÂ´s late.
I can lead our path - ThereÂ´s no time to lose!
Hand in hand weÂ´ll go in to the land below
Where we can be free - ThereÂ´s no time to lose!
Run by my side in search of distant light
Pointing our way - Soon the dreams will come!
In the eyes of child fear towards the night.
Long way to the sun - Soon the dreams will come!
Beyond the Strange Horizon!
Walk the road of Death. Try to save your breath
Â´cause soon weÂ´ll face Our Lord - We leave this world behind!
Free among the dead from sins we once plead.
Eternal is our love - We leave this world behind.
Blessed be those within grief.
I invite you to relief.
Leave your pain to the earth.
Under the tombstone is birth.
You just gotta believe!!!
Baby donÂ´t be afraid even though itÂ´s late.
I can lead our path - ThereÂ´s no time to lose.
