In the midst of the woods, strange figures walk in lines.
They are wearing hoods and robes and pendants with mystical signs.

On the road to the Sabbath
Of unholy passion,
To raise the demons
In the old fashion.

Look out!

Yeah!

Fair virgins dancing to the insane beat of the ritual drum.
Naked bodies whirling.
Everyone is waiting for the goat to cum.

Oh, come to the Sabbath
Of unholy passion,
To raise the demons
In the old fashion.

Look out!

In the midst of the woods, strange figures walk in lines.
