Among the trees
In the deepest forest.
We are here alone.
We have a place of our own.

How could I tell you what I feel?
How could I describe
The flame inside me,
My will to life?

Such a moment of pleasure,
To be here with you.
Like a well-hidden treasure.
I hope you feel it too.

How strange it is,
For a while to feel this well.
But what tomorrow brings,
It is hard to tell.

I have to make it clear.
Leave behind all fear.
Three little words
I whisper to your ear.
