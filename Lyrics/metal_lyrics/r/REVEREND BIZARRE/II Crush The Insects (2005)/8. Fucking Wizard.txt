When crimson darkness rules the earth,
And creatures gather behind your window...
How does it feel to be all alone?
How does it feel to hear them roam?
Sleep won't come no matter how hard you try.
At your threshold they are stalking - closer and closer.
When the time has come for you to meet your deepest fear,
Please don't forget that I will be always near.

I'm your saviour, your spark of hope.
Just summon me, and I will be there.
With my magick I expel your demon.
Divining Rod and Blessed Semen, ooh!

I'm the warlock of carnal lust.
In my dominion pleasure will be yours.
All the things immoral I possess.
I shall build my church inside your flesh, ooh!

Darkness falls, penetrating my balls.
Can this be our reality?
Fool in love, Fucking Wizard.
Can hardly wait - let's get laid!

C'mon baby!

C'mon baby, the time is right.
The most secret Hour of Moon.
Try to make it just one night.
Raise heat, until we swoon.

Our bodies are full of desire.
Suck me dry, so I can die.
Your lips applied with fire,
Kissing my ass goodbye!

All right!
