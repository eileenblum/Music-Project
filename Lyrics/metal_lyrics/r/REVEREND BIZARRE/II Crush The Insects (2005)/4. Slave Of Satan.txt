You are playing with evil things,
Pretend to be a magician.
But you know nothing about it.
You are just a sorry fool.

Let me tell you this:
I have seen the Prince of Darkness,
And he is nothing to be messed with.
He is much stronger than you ever thought.

One day you'll understand,
But I'm afraid that it's too late,
'cause he has got your soul,
And there's no way to get it back.

What do you think,
When you lie there on the altar
Waiting for some ugly jerk
To rape you as a sacrificial fuck?

You are Satan's slave.
Just a stupid child.
You say you're in love with Evil.
I say you're out of your mind!
Yes, your fucking mind!

All right!
