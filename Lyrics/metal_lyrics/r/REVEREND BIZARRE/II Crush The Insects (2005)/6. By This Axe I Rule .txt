I rise from slumber one night.
I have this urge to kill.
A ritual blood bath
To fulfil my own true will.

I'll call you to come to my place.
I'll pour you a glass of wine.
I'll tell you that you are beautiful,
And then I know that you are mine.

There you stand at my doorway,
Raindrops dripping from your hair.
You ring the bell and call my name.
You're getting cold, but I don't care.

By this axe I rule,
To serve my own vision and will.
I am no one's fool.
By this axe I rule!

Fully prepared, I open the door.
Sweet is the smile embellishing your face.
You're waiting for me to caress you gently.
I spray your blood all over the place.

By this axe I rule,
To serve my own vision and will.
I am no one's fool.
By this axe I rule!
