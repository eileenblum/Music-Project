There is the one up there.
There is the one down there.
There is the one, who is everywhere.
I believe I was brought here
To spread my Doom in this world of fear.
The one who breathed this life-force into me
Was the Goddess of Doom, Christina Ricci.
Aeons ago, she was born
Into the middle of the endless forlorn.
In silence and space, infinity,
Stood the Goddess of Doom. The supreme entity.
Saint Vitus and Trouble, Witchfinder General,
Count Raven, The Obsessed and Pentagram,
Solitude Aeturnus and Candlemass,
Penance, Revelation, Solstice and Iron Man,
Mirror of Deception and Pagan Altar,
Cirith Ungol, Exitus and Scald,
Internal Void, Paul Chain and Warning,
Unorthodox, Cathedral and Cold Mourning.
While Heaven Wept and Minotauri,
Dawn of Winter, Spiritus Mortis,
Electric Wizard, Confessor, Stillborn,
Solomon Kane, Orodruin and Mourn.
We kneel at your altar, we bless thy holy names.
You gave Doom to men, we try to do the same.
But there is one, who is above you: eternally hailed Goddess of Doom.
Hail to the Goddess, the Goddess of Doom,
Who tunes our instruments with darkness and gloom.
The one who does not offer salvation or peace,
But fulfils our minds with luxurious disease.
Hail to the Goddess, the Goddess of Doom,
Who tunes our instruments with darkness and gloom.
Hail to the Goddess, the Goddess of Doom.
In the depths of darkness evil flowers bloom.
Hail to the Goddess, the Goddess of Doom!
Hail to the Goddess, the Goddess of Doom!
Hail to the Goddess, the Goddess of Doom!
Hail to the Goddess, the Goddess of Doom!
