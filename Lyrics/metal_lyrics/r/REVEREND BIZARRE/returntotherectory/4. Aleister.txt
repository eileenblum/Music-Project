One man came among the men, wisdom within: the truth!
The rituals of the Elder Gods, far before the Christ who failed.
But the common men couldn't understand.
In their eyes he was damned.
He was forced to leave his fatherland,
But the curse was cast upon them all.
This one man changed our world with his new doctrine of Will,
And now we walk at the footsteps of this magnificent man. To Mega Therion!
Oh yeah!
