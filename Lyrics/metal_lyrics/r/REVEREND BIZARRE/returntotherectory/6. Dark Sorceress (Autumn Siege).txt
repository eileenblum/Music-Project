[Barathrum Cover]

Castle stands on the island of stone.
It is surrounded by dark waters.
Centuries on it's place,
For centuries more it shall do the same.
Its history so cruel,
The fort was cursed by eerie doom.
There's a witch enclosed into the wall,
No one knows exact place where.
There's a tree on the wall,
More than thirty feet tall.
It is said its roots
Grew from the heart of sorceress.
Every night she haunts
On the corridors of fort.
Her restless soul
Wanders in those huge halls...
Autumn long time ago,
The colossal stone fort.
Inside that dark walled castle,
Beautiful young female dwelt.
Dark Sorceress, Daughter of the castle lord.
Dark Sorceress, Worshipper of the Ramlord.
Dark Sorceress, Daughter of the castle lord.
Dark Sorceress, Worshipper of the Ramlord.
Dark witch used black magic,
Gestic magic in the war,
In war against warriors,
Wielders of the curved sabres.
Dark Sorceress, Daughter of the castle lord.
Dark Sorceress, Worshipper of the Ramlord.
Dark Sorceress, Daughter of the castle lord.
Dark Sorceress, Worshipper of the Ramlord.
Another stormy night during that autumn of fights
The enemy broke the gates and came with their sharp blades
Sorceress casted the spell to protect the castle
She performed her rite against intruders with sabres
Sky turned to dark.
The sorceress drew the mark,
Mark of the Ramlord in the air.
Strongest thunderstorm was created.
Lightnings everywhere,
Electricity in the air.
Lightning casted the shadow
Of the Ramlord onto the wall.
Enemy saw that shape,
And because of that they escaped
The shadow of the Ramlord
On the wall of black powered fort.
(Behold) Dark Sorceress, Daughter of the castle lord.
(Hark) Dark Sorceress, Worshipper of the Ramlord...!
