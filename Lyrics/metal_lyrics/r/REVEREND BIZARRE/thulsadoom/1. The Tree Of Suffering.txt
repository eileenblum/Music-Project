Here I hang on this tree, feel the pain of the nails
Things that once brought me horror now bring a smile to my face

I feel like I'm drowning in my own bloody sweat
Well, I used to love sunlight, but now it's peeling my head

Contemplate this...on the Tree of Suffering!

Take a look at the sky, see those Demons descending
They want to tear out your eyes, taste sweet man flesh and blood

I am not a weak man, won't die crucified
That which does not kill you will only make you stronger
