The children of doom.
Doom's children.
Ready to die for their master.
The pilgrimage of pain.
The call of death incites them to march faster.

Perplexed servants of the Snake Lord, seeking for the truth of their souls.
Carrying the Fangs of the Serpent, to kill the room of their own.

The only truth they will ever find at the feet of their master is the
message written for the blind: damnation, death and disaster.

Everywhere, the darkness is rising in the form of the evil tower,
and all of them are connected to the horrid Mountain of Power.

The children of doom.
Doom's children.
Ready to die for their master.
The pilgrimage of pain.
The call of death incites them to march faster.
