Walking through this wasteland
Carrying wicked thoughts within my mind
Wwondering what will be
Is there any future for mankind?
War is raging somewhere
Every second someone will die
Evil spirits in towers
Magnifying holes in the sky

I can hear them crying
Starving people who have no face
There's no time to help them
For I'm coming to end of my days

I am falling
But it feels good, yeah
Allright

There is no time to run when it's all over
Respect the clear vision of mighty Doomsower!

People full of hatred
Leading everyone's life to Hell
How long has it been so?
From the dawn of Man I can tell
Angels and Demons
Are fighting for our souls, can'lt you see?
Answer is in your hand just choose the way you wanna be

And live free
By the side of your God
