You're a man with thousand faces
Every day another mask
You creep within dark places
Implementing a dreadful task
You act like a man of mission
But to whom do you believe?
Don't you talk to me about Jesus
'Cause every word is blasphemy

Absorbed in your own mind
This is how you wish to be
Thinking you are one of a kind
An apostle of all misery
You speak in mystic language
Utterly with no meaning
Those who follow you
I guess they must be dreaming

Let them crawl at your feet
You're a king on your Throne of Greed

Just turn your back
To the One who wept
Don't even think about
The promises unkept

I hope you'll burn in Hell
Because you're an evil man
Your heart belongs to the Devil
When will you understand?

You bastard
