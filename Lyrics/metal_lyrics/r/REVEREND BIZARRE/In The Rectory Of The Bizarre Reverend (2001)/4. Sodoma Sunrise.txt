The city of sin is lying in the evening glow
Son of God coming through the gates only one will know
A man named Loot gives him shelter from the crowd outside
They used to rape everyone passing by and do it with pride

Under the Sun this city was ill there was nothing to tell
God himself was summoning all the fires of Hell
So Loot and his family left for good to the halls of Soar
And the city of sin was prepared to meet the fire and roar

Sunrise in Sodoma, people waking with the fear in their eyes
There's no time to run because the Lord is casting fire in the sky
When you make a sin I hope you realize all the sinners gotta die
Sunrise in Sodoma, all the people see the truth and final light

Allright!

Living in a cave won't be so bad if you think about past
Remember the decayed and the burial fires which burned so fast
And if your two daughters wanna fuck their father night and day
It's better to ride than to let your house just fade away
