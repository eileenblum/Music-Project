A long way from our home
Destined to roam
Where the sun won't shine

Under silver moon
Wandering through woods
Where life still exists

Prisoner of Ring
Evil from within
Guiding our way

Like a crawling worm
A slave of Evil Supreme
Again he must obey

Entering a new world
Of the skeletal trees
The valley of the withering flowers

Once a Tower of Moon
Now in a darkened room
The one with poison breath

The King of the City of Death
Carrying his crown of steel
Through thousand years of war

Where the shadows lie
All the beauty must die
Wow long we have to suffer?

The army under the Ring
They rised their banners for Him
A fiery God in sorrow

Haunting blood red eye
Ruling the distant sky
The symbol of our Doom

At the end of the stairs
The Wicked Mother is waiting
There's no way to turn back
We must face what we fear

Stare in the eyes of Terror

Into sunrise it will end
Under the starlight we will sleep eternally
Hearing the whispers from the sea
And now when the new day takes the pain
We are free there is no more to tell

"Ash nazg durbatuluk, ash nazg gimbatul
ash nazg thrakatuluk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul"
