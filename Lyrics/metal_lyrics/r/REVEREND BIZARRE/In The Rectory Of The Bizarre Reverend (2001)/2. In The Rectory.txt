Trough the Circle of Dawn
I shall lead my race
From which I was born
At the hallowed place
Keepers of the Black Steel
Hiders of the Flame
Our time has come
To accomplish the claim
Oh yeah

Climbing on the Mountain
Reaching for the Sun
Searching for the Temple
Where it all begun
Beholding at the cosmos
The Moon is so far
You're about to meet
Reverend Bizarre
Oh Lord have mercy

All right now!

We ride like a patrol of angels within a gloomy black sky
As the course of our path changes there is the Fire where the butterflies
die
Dirty runes glorify grey stones, relics from the ancient times
Earthly worms reaping my bones, raping flesh hiding these crimes

Can I hear the singing of my lover or have I lost my sight?
From this sleep am I able to recover or is it mine, the never-ending night?

Dance begins, won't you join me?
Middle of garden where dreams grow
Nightly forests worship your beauty
Deep inside winds won't blow

This is a journey to better world
By the leaves of these flowers
Sealed gates protecting this garden
Keep on dancing for thousand hours
