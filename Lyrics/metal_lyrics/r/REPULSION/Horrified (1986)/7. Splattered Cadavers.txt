The dead they rot in pungent pools of blood
Corpses mangled - Bones and flesh decayed
Life not real - Tragic accident
Splattered cadavers fill this morbid room

Decomposing rotting flesh
Vomit from the smell of death

Faces of death haunts your mind
You can't leave the morbid gore behind
Corpses recharged from death by your hand
Fear of death turns into sand

Mangled bodies in the morgue
Cold cadavers on the floor
Semi-victims in a bag
Faggot zombies dressed in drag
