Desecration of the earth - Massive death
End of all that breathes new life - Nothing left
A few survivors nearing death - Mutated
Slow decaying of the flesh - Soon they're dead

Eating flesh to stay alive - Cannibals
Decaying bodies everywhere - Smell the stench
Burning bodies lay in mess - Foul gore
Radiation burns your lungs - Rabid death

Bodies burn in massive piles - Bloodbath
Toxic fumes destroy your health and sanity
Death for you is coming soon - Slowly rot
Chemicals destroy the earth - Holocaust
