Horror in the graveyard - An evil hellish sight
Worm eaten corpses rising in the night
They're seeking human flesh, they live for nothing else
Once they come to you - You can't defend yourself

Out of the grave - Death is stalking you
You can't escape - Your eaten alive

They bite into your flesh
But you're still alive
You scream out a cry of agony and death
Your guts are devoured
Your bones are stripped of flesh
Your mangled fucking carcass
Lies in pools of blood
