Tyrants in their corporate throness
Schemes to rule the world
Military mass murder
Charges their advance
Senseless death disturbs the peace
The world is at war
Gods of devastation come
To heed the final score

Dawn of destruction - Pain and death unleashed
Thousands left in famine - Blood runs through the streets
End of humanity, a nunlucky few are left
To see the living horror and walk among the dead

Nuclear solution - End the war at once
Deadly missiles dropped - Burning human flesh
Buildings turn to ash - Life does not exist
Sadists have their victory - Drop the iron fist
