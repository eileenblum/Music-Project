Scorching through your tortured mind
Burning in your eyes
Hideous infection - painful death
Slowly you demise
Now you see your friends all die
Your trying to withstand
But you can't fight this evil foe

Inner organs start to rot
Smell the curdling skin
When it eats into your brain
Is when the pain begins

Lonesome death by festering boils
You're dying all alone
But as you see from beyond the grave
They feed upon your bones

Agony, torture, eternal pain
Festering boils drive you insane
Rabid disease destroys mankind
Festering boils eat your mind
