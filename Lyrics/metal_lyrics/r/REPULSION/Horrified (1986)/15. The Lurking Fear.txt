For many peaceful years their bodies laid in rest
Nuclear disaster from a nill fated test
Bodies start to rise, the holocaust is near
Can't escape the horror

Smell the lurking fear

Zombie eating children - Ripping out their guts
Headless bodies in the playground satisfy their lust
Cities are destroyed as corpses come to life
You can't escape the horror, feel the lurking fear

You know the end is coming, feel the grip of death
Zombies get you cornered and tear apart your flesh
Stick their fingers in your neck
Rip off your fucking head
They need to eat the living
It's the hunger of the dead

Now you're a fucking zombie
Your skin is turning blue
You feed to eat the living
It's hunger of the dead

Now you're a fucking zombie
Your skin is turning blue
You feed upon the living
Hell's awaiting you

Find a helpless vicitm, bite into his flesh
Drained of his life's blood, he feels the lurking fear
