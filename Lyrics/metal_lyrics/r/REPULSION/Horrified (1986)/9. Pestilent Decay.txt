Decadence of your mind
Sanity you can't find
Rotting flesh diseased your brain
Painful death the final reign

Stained with blood the dead now weep
Struck by plague and black disease
Stenching piles of mangled dead
Agony in their heads

Plague has struck the innocent
Virus of contagious death
Death infliction set on course
The earth is piled with rotted corpses

Omen of deadly fate
Sent into a world of hate
No more war only death
The earth becomes a fiery crypt
