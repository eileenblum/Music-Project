The fog is rising of the spiritual rape beneath the black levelling skies I hear the inhuman cries
Tainting the mind corrupting the ways of mankind
Inflicting the wounds the wounds that will never heal
Accepting the first comprehension with iron chains around our souls
Fighting the words of power with the words of wisdom under the veil of false promises

Promises of false truth mother of all lies the Haze of Words
Monsters in human form giving speeches for the dead
Lies crawling from beyond beyond reality for we are all born
With the same rope around our necks free will for us does not exist
May the truth be told even heavens fall
Secrets of the human life starts to unfold
All your dreams will shatter in awake nightmare
Misery speaks in your tongue procreation upon the demon seed
The entity starts to breathe
The fog of its own doing upon mankind
Spreading the plague the plague of lies

For nation shall arise against nation and kingdom against kingdom
And there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquake in diverse places
In history of mankind words were never so empty as they are now
Accepting the first comprehension with iron chains around our souls
Fighting the words of power with the words of wisdom under the veil of false promises
