The Golden Man falls the air falls thick upon us adventuring the blackest of the first wave
With the black death of the wings of disaster under the flag of damnation
Like the thousand plagues of a thousand worlds
Thousand tears of a thousand storms
Eternal curse pulled from heaven

Their Fate falls cursing the life of their children calling the blackest of the first wave
With the Silent death of the wings of disaster under the flag of damnation
Like the thousand plagues of a thousand worlds
Thousand tears of a thousand storms
Eternal curse pulled from heaven

When the White Curtain Falls
It will never rise
Contagion
Crawling under their skins and bones
None shall survive
Death will come Alive
Under The Flag of Damnation

The Lord is a man of war and the Lord is his name
All belivers will be reaped by the voice of death
Thus their fate will die and will swept aside
Like the dead leaves before an angry wind.
The skies turn more darker and red with every step he takes behind
No hope and no salvation for I see death burning the nation of eternity
Divine Guard guarding salvationËs gate
Death Crown crowning every soul in the mark of mortality
