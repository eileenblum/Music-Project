My name is forgotten but still beats in the hearts of the fools with fear
Over-active imagination captive in a sick reality
Out of sanity forget the light
We are all blind of your mislead judgement
Who are you to question my acts who are you to pass judgement on my beliefs?
Who are you to stand in my way?
I always stayed in the shadow far beyond your influences
Yet I bear knowledge beyond understanding view beyond reason

Blind leading the blind in the prison of flesh
Kingdom of brutality failure to the core
Life is no more death in the void
Who are you to question my acts who are you to pass judgement on my beliefs?
Who are you to stand in my way?
My name is forgotten but still beats in the hearts of the fools with fear
I bear the soul of infinity sum of immortality I am the Eternal Spirit
