[performed by Reinkaos]Fright in their fragile minds
Simple, decayed
Guilt is nowhere
Only ashes of man

Fetus god, blinded
Raped by man
Prayer on deaf ears
Pearls before the swine
Rotten from inside
From the ancient times
From the ravenous whores of faith
To break the spine of mankind
Shatter the will
Of a failed creation
Reap what you sow
Wrath of an angry god
as nature watches the day
reign of man fades away
forgotten
no chosen few, all of them.

Decived by your own creation
Forever faliure
Blood on your hands, greed in your hearts
None divine
Give us an eternal punishemt of your absence
Silence eternal
Continuation of decay

There is nothing that keeps you in hell but mere pleasure of mine.

Decived by your own creation
Forever faliure
Blood on your hands, greed in your hearts
None divine
Give us an eternal punishemt of your absence
Silence eternal
Continuation of decay

And in those days
Shall man seek death
And shall not find it
And shall desire to die
And death shall flee from them
To The Atheist God
