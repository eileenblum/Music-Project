[performed by Reinkaos]In moral's dust lies a corruption of thought
Where death is certain, life is not
In this shallow earth
To rape the future

I feel a 1000 lies
Spawnig a new world
Drowning in demise
The truth is gone, dead.

As you will stare in the eyes of this blind man
And fall into the red sea of deception
Remeber the author of all lies written
Human vomit
Forever rotten

Stay ignorant
Stay foolish
In your tragedy of birth
Reason abandon
The Curse of Ignorance

In this human dust free will dies
Where death is certain, life is not
In this shallow earth
To rape us all

I feel a 1000 lies
Spawnig a new world
Drowning in demise
The truth is gone, dead.

For their lies we fall.
