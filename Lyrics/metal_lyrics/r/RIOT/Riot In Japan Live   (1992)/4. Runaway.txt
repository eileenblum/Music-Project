Runaway, all alone, on these streets you call your home
Fade to black, painted smile
On these streets there cries a wounded child
On the run, shadows always falling
It's a high price that you pay

Runaway
This life that you choose
Leaves a burning in my heart
Runaway
It's a game that you lose
It can tear my soul apart
You're a Runaway,
You're a Runaway

Runaway, all alone, turns the corner toward a telephone
Pik it up, then call my name
Tell me when you want to end this game
On the run, shadows always falling
It's a high price that you pay
Runaway
This life that you choose
Leaves a burning in my heart
Runaway
It's a game that you lose
It can tear my soul apart
You're a Runaway,
You're a Runaway

You're a runaway, and you're harder than stone
You're a runaway
But are you woman enough not to be alone ?
You're a runaway, you gotta an angry heart
You're a runaway, and when you're ready baby
I'll let you finish what you start

Runaway
This life that you choose
Leaves a burning in my heart
Runaway
It's a game that you lose
It can tear my soul apart
You're a Runaway,
You're a Runaway
