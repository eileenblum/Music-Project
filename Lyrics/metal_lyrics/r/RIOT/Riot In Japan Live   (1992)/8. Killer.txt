I am the living end, i have the touch, the last man on earth
I am your only friend, that ain't saying much
I think you know what it's worth

I've got things to do, people to be, i'm a man on the make
You want to stick around, that dont bother me
Long as you got what it takes

You know my name, you've seen the writing on the barrom
wall
I'm still the same
A little stronger, a little faster
Half demon, half disaster
He's a killer

When i walk in the door the men drop their drinks
And the woman drop their pants
Ooh man don't get up; what are you thinking ?
We didn't come to dance.

You see the boys and me don't need company
Whatever we want we'll take
We're just looking for thrills, boredom kills
Just want to see you shake

You know my name, you've seen me coming in the mirror
I'm still the same
A little older, a little wiser, a solitary surpriser
He's/I'm the killer

Here's a couple a grand, baby light up
Whatever is mine is ours
I got three or four in a bag in the trunk
That's the privilege of Power

You want love, lust, money, a room with a view
I'll give you everything a love can steal
Come on baby, I'm talking to you
Yeah, it's time to make a deal

You know my name, you've heard me screaming on the radio
I'm still the same
A little sharper, a little cuter, created by computer
He's / I'm the killer
You know my name, you've seen it panted on the
subway doors
I'm still the same
A little darker, a little thinner, i'm gonna have you
for dinner
I'm the killer
He's a killer
