Woman shed tears of Sorrow for their men so far away
With hope they wait for tomorrow - but in the night
They bow their heads and pray
They live by the sword and the gun
And now they march thru the darkness
The fire of freedom burns brught like the sun

Soldier
Fighting for liberty
With blood on your hands
You lead your command onward...to victory
Soldier
Thrashing across the seas
Mighty you stand
Defending the land
With a heart that's brave and free

Back home there's fear and hunger
Out in the streets
The desperate bleed
Out in this world there stalks a killer
Who's heart is filled with lust and greed

Soldier
Fighting for liberty
With blood on your hands
You lead your command onward...to victory
Soldier
Thrashing across the seas
Mighty you stand
Defending the land
With a heart that's brave and free
