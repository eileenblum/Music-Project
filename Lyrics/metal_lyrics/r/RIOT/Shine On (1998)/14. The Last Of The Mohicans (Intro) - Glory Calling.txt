Onward my people they
Came to these shores
From so far away
Searching for freedom
They had known before
Many fall and pray
On this land they build
Their homes fighting wind and rain
Running far from pain they'd known
Now this land they claim

Fight
Into the night, we as one are free
Fight
War burning bright glory calling me
Fight
Into the dark never will i run
Fight
Cavalry charge this land and i are one

Many have fallen
Anf many have died all along the way
Fight for the families of
Those who have cried
This land is where i'll stay !
Mount your horses, one by one
Throw your fears aside
Here for huron blood we've come
For huron blood we ride

Fight
Into the night, we as one are free
Fight
War burning bright glory calling me
Fight
Into the dark never will i run
Fight
Cavalry charge this land and i are one
