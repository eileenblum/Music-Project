Deep within the city, hidden in it's walls they hide the people
and the places far below
But they're strong enough and they're
hard enough to recify the anger in the minds of all subversive men who know.

Still there waiting far behind yea.
Soon he'll sound his call, then we'll stand or fall

Kings are falling destinies calling for this time, oh this time we will be free, yea.
Kings are falling destinies calling in my mind, in my mind i will be free yea, i will be free.

Darkened inner city, one by one they fall along the border of the places which they came.
Well we're mad enough and we're bad enough to seperate illusion from the madness all the faces look the same
Now they're waiting for his call.
soon we'll hear his cry, then we'll stand and fight.

Kings are falling destinies calling for this time, oh this time we will be free, yea.
Kings are falling destinies calling in my mind, in my mind i will be free yea, i will be free.

Now they're waiting for his call.
soon we'll hear his cry, then we'll stand and fight.

Kings are falling destinies calling for this time, oh this time we will be free, yea.
Kings are falling destinies calling in my mind, in my mind i will be free yea, i will be free.
