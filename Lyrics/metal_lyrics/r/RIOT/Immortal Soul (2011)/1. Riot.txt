I sent your job to a foreign land,
baby I got mine, don't you understand?
I took your home, your car, I can afford to buy it,
what's it gonna take to make you riot?

I sent your sons and your daughters to the desert sands,
give 'em all to me, you're an American!
They get a flag and a box, and I will surely supply it,
what's it gonna take to make you riot?

And I told you, live in fear 'til you call my name.
Then I sold you and you're still playing my game....

What's it gonna take - to make you riot?
What's it gonna take?

Do you fear your God or your brother man?
No god I know would ever take your land.
Thank your God for your gun? Now it's time to try it -
what's it gonna take to make you riot?

Look to the east, there's a brand new flame,
the children of Allah put us all to shame.
They're tired of the lies and cannot stay quiet,
what's it gonna take to make you riot?

Yeah I told you, live in fear 'til you call my name.
Then I sold you and you're still playing my game....

What's it gonna take - to make you riot?
What's it gonna take?

You forget your rights, and I forget your name
you're gonna keep on payin' cause you're all the same.
This is your master' voice, donât you dare defy it.
What's it gonna take to make you riot?

Swing to the right, baby all the way,
I'll be dancin' with the Devil on the judgement day.
I sold my soul, to any fool who'd buy it.
What's it gonna take to make you riot?

And I told you, live in fear 'til you call my name.
Then I sold you and you're still playing my game....
