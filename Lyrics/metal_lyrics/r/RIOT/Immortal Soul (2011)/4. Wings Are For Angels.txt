If I leave I'll be dead by morning,
if I stay it's all the same.
Insane from a thousand sorrows,
what's my name again? I don't know...

Past the graves of a million dreams,
swallow all &amp; fade away.
What I do or I don't it seems,
damned all anyway, damned to hell.

They called me a fool for my choice of career.
I'm the winds of war that will blow you away,
sure as I'm standing here.

Wings are for angels, wings are for angels.

Try to breathe in this ancient wonder,
golden days of history.
On spinning blades I'm the god of thunder.
What's my name again? That will do...

Flyboys, they get all the glory,
working men get what remains.
Lost my soul when I sold my story.
Here I go again, yes I know...

They called me a fool for my choice of career.
I'm the winds of war that will blow you away,
sure as I'm standing here.

Wings are for angels, wings are for angels.

Kill your brother if Allah tells you,
I will kill what else remains,
for the money my country gave me.
What's my name again - now you know!

Once more to the fields of glory,
damn the clouds &amp; burn the sky.
Lost my soul when I sold my story.
Here we go again, yes I know...

I lost all my friends and I lost all my fear.
Nothing left to die for, they told me today,
Iâm staying another year...
