I've been waiting, always waiting, I've been waiting,
can you hear me?
Meditating, meditating, tired of waiting,
don't you know, I've been drinking for days,
got the stagger to show it, the weekend is here
and I'm ready...
Aspirations are high but the funds are low,
gotta keep it up 'til I'm steady.

One for crying, one for dying, tired of trying,
Gonna be just....
I've been fearing, disappearing,
tired of hearing, here we go,
now I'm truly inspired and totally flying,
I'm a master of everything, I ain't even trying.

Sins of the father will shine on your darkest days.
Why even bother with life, I know.
Or if you'd rather, open this amber vial,
How many hours 'til life, I know...

I know, I know, the bottle tells me so,
I know, I know, the bottle tells me so,
I know, I know...

Imitating disintegrating is stimulating,
I'm alive!
Power steering disappearing, hard of hearing,
just drive -
If you got no future, you got no friends,
you got no choice you gotta rise again.

Sins of the father will shine on your darkest days.
Why even bother with life, I know.
Or if you'd rather, open this amber vial,
How many hours 'til life, I know...

I know, I know, the bottle tells me so,
I know, I know, the bottle tells me so,
I know, I know...
