Insanity, you light up the world for me...

With a song in my heart and a gun in my hand,
waiting for you,
with this secret I keep,
where the sea meets the land,
waiting for you all...

Waiting for the night to begin...
Almost in my sight, this fragrant wind.
The lifeless on parade...

Insanity, return to me,
I'm living in a fever dream.
I burn for you, you scream for me,
there's no one I would rather be right now.

Do you breathe like a man,
is your life not your own?
Waiting for you.
Do you hunger for flesh,
where it lives on the bone?
Waiting for you all...

Waiting for the night to begin, yeah, yeah.
Almost in my sight, this fragrant wind,
The lifeless on parade...

Insanity, return to me,
I'm living in a fever dream.
I burn for you, you scream for me,
there's no one else I'd rather be right now.

Insanity, you light up the world for me.
We rage and we kill, and we call it free will,
we believe in it still.

Insanity, you bring out the man in me.
This demon within, it's evil &amp; sin,
right under your skin.

Insanity, we all are the same, you see.
We fight and we fall, and never recall,
our history is all insanity.
