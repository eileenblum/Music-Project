All is forgotten or stolen or sold,
all that remains is a boy growing old.
A memory of something without a name,
a thousand excuses for staying the same.

Where is the fire that raged in your soul?
Buried now in a deep dark hole,
forgotten like your story and your name.

Hey, Johnny, brother take my hand
I remember, I am still your man.
Another round and don't say when,
'til we hit the ground and ride again,
nothing's changed and nothing stays the same.

Yeah here is your box full of lightning and dreams,
here's to the thunder, remember the screams.
A thousand times twenty, they call your name,
no one's forgotten, they carry the flame.

Waiting for someone to bring us all home
a Jack in black leather, a King in chrome,
to say the word and start it all again.

Hey, Johnny, brother take my hand,
I remember, I am still your man.
Another round and don't say when,
'til we hit the ground and ride again,
nothing's changed and nothing stays the same.

We kept all the pictures of good times and bad,
you drove us all crazy, the world drove you mad.
I hear it inside you, a gathering scream,
a fire eternal a love that's supreme.

Would you be king again just for a day,
We live but once, or so they say,
and then we never pass this way again.

Hey, Johnny, brother take my hand,
I remember, I am still your man.
We're waiting, all, we still believe,
do you have one ace left up your sleeve?
Nothing's changed and nothing stays the same.
