Burn the night to fear the day.
Daylight comes and burns it all away
just like the ocean haze,
so the last one thousand days.

Speak to God, I kneel and pray,
no reply, don't know that I am
weaker, stronger, cannot say,
but older by a thousand days.

Crawling - keeps me - from falling...

Moving slow I make my way,
another floor another day.
Never knowing what to blame,
from down here y'all look the same.

Pray the prayer to pass the time,
no time for reason, only rhyme
will fill the page and light the light,
so the last one thousand nights.

Once upon a midnight clear
miles of highway disappeared
into the sky near Gemini,
if you're seeing double, close one eye.

Crawling - keeps me - from falling...

I have been there once before,
but the band played out of tune,
and I did not have a word to tell a story,
'til you saved me with a love so rare
as water on the Moon,
and I'm sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry...

I have been there once before,
but the music would not play,
though I had a song and then I had a story.
Will you save me when the sun delivers
all another day,
and Iâm sorry, Iâm sorry...
