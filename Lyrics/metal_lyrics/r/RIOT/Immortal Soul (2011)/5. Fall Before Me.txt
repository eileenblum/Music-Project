Take this sword from out my hand,
return me to the motherland.
Day is night and duty done,
now bear me 'cross the river.

Sands surrounds us, let it pass,
a storm within an hourglass.
We rise and fall, time takes it all,
we stand and we deliver.

Now I stand before you,
riven by the choice I've made,
And driven by the voice I prayed
would sing me home to glory.
Who among us knows the day?
Ours is but to pass this way.
In brotherhood we understood,
this battlefield my story.

Should I fall before you, I will feel no shame.
It is the price of war in blood and in flame.
Should you fall beside me, I will do the same,
breathe you deep inside me, and carry your name.

Thrones, Dominions guide my way,
deliver me another day.
Cloak me now in righteousness,
your champion stands alone.

Day of mourning, day of wrath,
All fulfill the prophets path,
Death is struck, all nature quakes
Oh, Father take me home.

Now I stand before you,
riven by the choice I've made,
And driven by the voice I prayed
would sing me home to glory.
Who among us knows the day?
Ours is but to pass this way.
In brotherhood we understood,
this battlefield my story.
