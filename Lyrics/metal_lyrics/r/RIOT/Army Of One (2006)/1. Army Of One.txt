Breaking from under the spell
Taking my life like a bullet wound
My masters are straight out of hell
I feel their eyes watching my every move
I can not surrender control
My only relief from this endless pain
I beg and I cry for an ounce of your sympathy
Still I am left here to die

Carry on, just a moment of mercy
Bring your fight to them all
Lift your blade, from the floor

Death, is my burning light
Still I'm alive and must fight
The knife in my hand is my guiding force
I scream through the silence of night
My senses are gaining complete control

Just a dream, now nothing is over
Break your chains from the wall
Stand up, stand tall

Slowly we built to a mass
An army of one as we grow with our vengeance
The battle has not yet begun
We'll tear out the hearts of all those who suppress us

Just a dream, now nothing is over
Break your chains from the wall
Stand up, stand up, stand tall
