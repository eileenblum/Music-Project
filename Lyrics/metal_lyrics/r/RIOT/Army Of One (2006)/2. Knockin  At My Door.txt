I'm feeling like I'm caged, I've got to live
There's someone on their way
I'm guessing that I'm brave, but still I give
The devils has his day
I'll tear it up, I'll tear it down alone, that's what I feel inside
I look behind the corners where I go
I can not close my eyes

You see what you wanna see
You feel what you wanna feel
There's someone at my door

Who's that knockin' at my door, knockin' at my door
Who's that knockin' at my door, knockin' at

It stepped inside my mind and it won't leave
The images I see
I can't confuse the messages I read
There's someone haunting me

You hear what you wanna hear
You know what you wanna know
There's someone at my door

You see what you wanna see
You feel what you wanna feel
There's someone at my door
