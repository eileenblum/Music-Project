Blinded, I give my true confession
Innocent I walk out on the floor
Finding, all of my oppression
Patronizing what you think is pure

Give me something, lay my hands upon the door
Only my sense of who you are, who you are

Is it yesterday, am I on my way
Just a picture on the wall
Sever all my ties, try to recognize
Just a memory, that's all

Blinded, caught in disillusion
Just a little light inside your eye
I've been dwelling in seclusion
Hiding from the demons in the sky

Only you, drag my heart onto the floor
Desperate my intentions are ignored, are ignored

Is it yesterday, am I on my way
Like a needle in my vein
Sever all my ties, try to recognize
Now I can't escape the pain

Now I'm lost inside, mirror by my side
Like an angel at my door
Broken alibis, try to recognize
I keep coming back for more
Is it yesterday, am I on my way
Just a picture on the wall
Sever all my ties, try to recognize
Just a memory, that's all
