Pickin' me up, your tearin' me down
Like a fool on a mile drive
Sew my side with a dirty needle
Keep your live on the prize alive
Turn me out before you turn me in
Got my hand on a ready blade
Five more days till I meet the man
Gonna bow my head and say

I'm still alive, half a mile until I get away
Still alive, live to fight again another day

I've burned my bridge and I've done my time
Like a man on a magic ride
I'll find my way through a crowded street
I'm a devil in disguise
Get out of my way or I'll gun your down
Got no time for your alibis
I found the crown, now I'm out of town, never gonna die

I'm still alive, half a mile until the border line
Still alive, leave the scene and you won't do the time

I'm still alive, half a mile until I get away
I'm still alive, so I'll live to fight another day
I'm still alive, half a mile until the border line
I'm still alive, leave the scene and you won't do the time
