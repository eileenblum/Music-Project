If ever I saw you there, would you even care
Just a sign for everyone to see
Once I was a boy, now just like a man
I'll find a way to pass another helpin' hand

In a distant land, I'll be there for you
No one else gonna help you like I do

Tell me, tell me half of what you're thinking
'cause I don't know
Tell me, tell me so my heart ain't sinking, let me know

Just in time you've come, like another one
I've just come to rectify your soul
Once I am a man, I'm gonna make a stand
Get out of my way while you can

If you ever go, won't you let me know
Don't betray the passage out yourself

Tell me, tell me what you think you're living for
'cause I don't know
Tell me, tell me just in case you're heart ain't sure
Let me know

Deep inside my soul, visions come and go
I've got to find a passage back to you
