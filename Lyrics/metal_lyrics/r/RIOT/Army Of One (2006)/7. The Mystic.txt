Mesmerized, darkened skies, we set upon the seas
In the night, we can not wait, to hear the mystics pleas

Carry on, on through the mercy of night
Never wrong, hi power of sight

Oh see me, see me
Won't you just look in my mind
Oh help me, help me
Turn me away, from all evil I find

Desert sun, wind and rain, all is at your command
Nothing hides from your tortured eyes
The answers lie in your hands

How long we can find the will to survive
Hear my scream, am I alive

Oh see me, see me
Won't you just give me a sign
Oh help me, find me
Give me your hand, and tell me all that you find

How long we can find the will to survive
Hear my scream, am I alive
