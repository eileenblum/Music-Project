Building walls cities tall, just a moment over
Camouflage, hear them call, one more turn to sorrow
Tear it down, tear it down, then they will remember
Every kind has a crown, nothing left to send her

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know it does, I know it all falls down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know it will, I know it all falls down

Innocence, just the same, never stop to question
In the end, just a game, it's just no deception
Tear it down, tear it down, tear it out from under
Take a piece, look around, there's no time to wonder

Tell a few, tell them all, just in time to miss you
Kick the wall watch it fall, it's a crime to be true
Take a life make them proud, then the past is undone
