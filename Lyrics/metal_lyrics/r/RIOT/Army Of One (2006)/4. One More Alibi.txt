Roll the dice or spin the dial, save a life or kill a child
Test the blade for residue, that's not all they found on you
Like a dying man, in a story book
The only think I want to know is who you are

I'll give you, a moment in your life to run
From all the different things you might not be
I'll let you, inside my confidence I know
And find a way to what you have become

Burn the cross or let it stand, is it a crime for half a man
I need to know
Build a bridge or tear it down
Only a king could wear your crown

Such a lonely page, in your story book
Now all I want to know is who you are

I'll give you, another piece of time to tell you
It holds the answers to your life
I'll show you, one more alibi to let you
Resurrect the pieces you have lost

Like a dying man, in a story book
The only thing I want to know is who you are
Tell me who you are

It's just a moment in your life, it's just a moment in time
