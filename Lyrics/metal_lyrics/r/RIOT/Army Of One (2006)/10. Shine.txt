Speeding through space, I'm falling to fast
The present is fading away
Twisted and lost, I'm far from my home
Just hours of air left to breath
Into the void, I plunge into blackness
This mystery cones to an end
Searching and screaming and desperately pleading
In minutes my death will commence

I can't let go
Nothing left to give me hope

Showering storms of fire and ice
I tumble from mountains of sand
My senses are dull, my body is weak
My ship is in destiny's hand
Blazing with fire I call to my god
Glory to thee take my soul
Save me from pain, or raise me from hell
My body is in your control

And I can't let go
Nothing left to give me hope
I just don't know
Nothing left that I can see

Shine, on your light, see me through
Shine, end this fight, come to you
Shine, in your sun, my last hour
Shine, I can't run, to your tower
