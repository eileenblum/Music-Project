Is someone out there
Is someone hiding from the light, ain't that right
You hear them screaming
You see them crying in the night, oh nothing's right

You can see me
Don't you understand
Don't you know

I'm fallin' tonight, to the darker side of light
You better let me go
I'm fading away, a thousand times today
Help me find my way, and I'm calling out to you tonight

Somebody saved you
Somebody pulled you from the dark, like a spark
You let me stumble, you let me ease away from pain
The broken chain

They can't see you
They don't recognize, why

Like a dream you faded, you were cast away
Deep into the night, somewhere safe
You came to me, hold yourself and say, yeah

I'm falling tonight to the darker side of light
You better let me go
I'm fading away, a thousand times today
You better help me stay
I'm falling tonight to the darker side of light
You better let me go
I'm fading away, a thousand times today
You better help me stay
And I'm callin' out to you
