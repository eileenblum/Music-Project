Feeling trapped i'll soon succumb 
The hour strikes i'll turn and run 
A piece of dream inside my mind. 
I feel entomed i must remove 
With depth of reason i should prove 
give me trust for all is true 
Only one, i enlist to follow on 
From the dust all our ashes will be gone 
That's right. 

So i travelled on. 
On into the darkened night. 
Only you don't turn me down. 
So i carried on, on into the dark and light. 
Twist of fate is all i found. yea. 

As i clean and dress my wound 
The cast of blood and bone i lose 
The penchant filtered thru the sky 
Only fortune my mistake 
soon to pay for vows i break 
I'll search for solice deep inside 
Only one, i enlist to follow on. 
From the dust, all our ashes will be gone. 
That's right 

So i travelled on. 
On into the darkened night. 
Only you don't turn me down. 
So i carried on, on into the dark and light. 
Twist of fate is all i found. yea. 

So i travelled on. 
On into the darkened night. 
Only you don't turn me down. 
So i carried on, on into the dark and light. 
Twist of fate is all i found. yea.
