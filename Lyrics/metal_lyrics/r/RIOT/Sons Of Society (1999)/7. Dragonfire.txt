Cross the signs that fool your minds 
Let your fear light the way 
Danger games inside the claims 
Fathers law to obey 
One falls all fall death shines in your eye 
Raise your hands and cry. yea. 

Dragonfire proud and strong 

Armore clad diseased an mad 
From the canyons of hell 
Climb the wall to desperate calls 
Killers casting their spell 
Save thee save thee save all if you can 
Save your fatherland yea 

Dragonfire, proud and strong yea 

Raise your hands to the sky yea. 

One falls all fall death 
shines in your eye. 
Raise your hands and cry yea 

Dragonfire, proud and strong yea. 
Dragonfire, proud and strong 
Look into the eyes the dragon....yea
