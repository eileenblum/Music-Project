I use my silence as a wall to keep me safe until i fall. 
Hide from all uncertainty, that's right. 
I crept onto your darkened cage 
Awake all oyur primal rage 
To find out what you want from me. 
And so i wait, invision 
all that i can state, citizens and all are freee  yea 

I'll keep fighting to the end 
For my innocence defend 
I've...lost all but everything from the fire. 
I have seen, bad machine. 

I'll use my conscience as a guide to change 
My future you're implied, a bit of some insanity. 
I strike a match near Kerosene to rid the eyes of fantasy. 
No i'm never to be seen 
And so i wait the future's forty years too late 
Or somewhere there along the way yea 

I'll keep fighting to the end 
For my innocence defend 
I've...lost all but everything from the fire. 
I have seen, bad machine. 

And so i wait, the future's forty years 
Too late, or somwhere there along the way yea. 

I'll keep fighting to the end 
For my innocence defend 
I've...lost all but everything from the fire. 
I have seen, bad machine. 

I'll keep fighting to the end 
For my innocence defend 
I've...lost all but everything from the fire. 
I have seen, bad machine. 
oh bad machine that's what i am yea oh that's right yea
