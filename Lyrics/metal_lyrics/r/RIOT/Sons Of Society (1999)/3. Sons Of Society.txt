Stop arresting my mind, finding the force in my eyes. 
No use telling your lies, looking for safety inside.

No use holding me steal the blood in my eyes. 
No use forcing my arm to comply with your greed. 

Sons of society. 
You keep me satisfied - you keep me satisfying. 
Scorned with compliancy no more to satisfy 
I will comply with you. yea. 

Formed in silence and war, subtle we move to destroy. 
Give to you more and more, the massesare set to deploy. 
Stop consoling me i've got hold of my life. 
Stop patrolling me stealthe blood in my eyes. 
No use forcing my arm to comply with your greed. 

Sons of society. 
You keep me satisfied - you keep me satisfying. 
Scorned with compliancy no more to satisfy 
I will comply with you. yea. 

Sons of society.

Sons of society.
