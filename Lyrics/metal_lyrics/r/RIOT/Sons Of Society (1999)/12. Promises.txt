I've been fighting this war for so long. 
Tell me why its not over. 
With inclinations our leaders are wrong. 
There they are the're controlling our lives. 
Still i'll fight. 
We have fought through the sun and the moon. 
Facing tyrants and soldiers. 
We stumbled from glory to doom. 
Blood of men on my shoulders. 
It's true, what you do. Listen. 

I believe, i believe in the things they said. 
Your promises, no more promises. 

Sons and brothers they die side by side 
Not a soul in sedition. 
From the gallows to streets of versailles 
Now we live in submission now me, oh i'm free. 

I believe, i believe in the things they said. 
Your promises, i believe, i believed in the things 
they said, your promises. 

I believe, i believed in the things they said. 
Your promises, oh i believe, yea. 
I believed in the things they said, your promises. 
Yea i believed in the things they said, oh oh promises.
