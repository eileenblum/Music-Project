Tied to visions theres something that's bringing you low. 
Every morning the bastards are starting their show. 
I can hear them cry for their lives. 
but now all is lost here and now. 
So i'm flying up upon....oh 

On the wings of life. 
This is all we could 
Climb upon, yeah, 
on the wings of life, 
till forever is never.....now. 

Desperate measures have desperate directions indeed. 
Find the answers to all that we will need. yea. 
I can tell when you're lying or not. 
But still all is lost, here and now only fortune alone.... 

On the wings of life. 
Still we are climbing higher . yea. 
On the wings of life, put the test to the fire....yea. 
That's what i'm gonna do 
Put the test to you....oh....yea....yea 

I can hear them cry for their lives. 
But now all is lost, here and now so i'm flying upon 

On the wings of life 
This is all we could climb upon. yea 
On the wings of life 
Till forever is never....now...yea 
On the wings of life 
still we are climbing higher, yea 
On the wings of life 
Put the test to the fire....yea
