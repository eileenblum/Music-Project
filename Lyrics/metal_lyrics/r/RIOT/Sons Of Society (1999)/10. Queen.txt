Around midnight he locked in tight to his frustrations, she told her tales 
With all she could, that's right. He wasn't half as good at cold manitpulation, 
But he just listened as he should yea. 
You don't know, but it will show. you'll make a better man of me. 

Queen, it seems you hold my heart within your hands 
Queen, i mean you make me sorry, but you don't know. 
Queen, i dream you made me bleed and just for show. 
But you won't let me go. 

She played hist heart she played his mind with every finger. 
Untill he finally lost his soul yea. 
He said a thousand times her captive rhythms still linger. 
But she just crucified him cold 
You don't know, but it will show, you'll make a better man of me. 

Queen, it seems you hold my heart within your hands 
Queen, i mean you make me sorry, but you don't know. 
Queen, i dream you made me bleed and just for show. 
But you won't let me go. 

Queen, it seems you hold my heart within your hands. 
Queen, i mean you make me sorry baby but you don't know. yeah 
Queen, i dream you made me bleed and just for show 
but you won't let me go. 

Queen, i dream you made me bleed and just for show. 
But you won't let me go 
won't let me go baby. 
Feels like you're tearin' me apart baby 
Oh you made me bleed and just or show baby.
