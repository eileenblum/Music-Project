I've been looking in the mirror, i don't know what i'm tryin to find 
I hope in time i see things clearer, yea. 
I'm prayin' time will clear my mind. 
Darkened visions in my doorway 
Throw my heart upon the floor 
The only lesson that obey. 
Keep me comin' back for more 

They say that love is so deceiving, like a picture on the wall. 
It breaks my heart and leaves me grieving. 
Gets me ready for my fall. 
When you cut me and leave me still breathing, 
leave me in time of need....well save me time to 
Bleed....save me time to bleed 

Tearin me up on the inside, you leave me crying out in pain 
no more good it. Does me to hide, caus all my runnin's been in vain 
You throw me down while i am sleeping. 
Stick a knife right in my heart. 
I  can hear you softly creeping, it ain't overtill you start. 
Then you cut me breathing, leave me in time of need 
Save me time to bleed 

You throw me down while i am sleeping, 
Stick a knife right in my heart, i can hear you softly creeping. 
It ain't over till you start 
They say that love is so deceiving, like a picture on the wall. 
It breaks my heart and leaves me grieving 
Gets me ready for my fall, when you cut me and leave me still breathing 
Leave me in time of need 
Well save me time, save me time 
To bleed...ha....save me time to bleed 
Time to bleed...save me time to bleed
