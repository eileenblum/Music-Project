Remember, days of the past i see them still. 
Forever, baby, lost inside my tortured will 
This was all i ever wanted to feel. 
This was all i ever wanted. 
Baby don't you know. 
In my eyes i see such misery. 
It hurts me when you go. 
Yea how i need to feel you close to me. 
This was all i ever needed to feel 
This was all i ever wanted. 

Cover me, cover me 
Into the night don't you see i'm all alone. 
Don't you leave me here alone thoughout the night. 
Cover me,  cover me 
Into the night, don't you see that i'm alone. 
Would you leave me here alone throughout the night. 

You were all i ever wanted to feel darlin. 
You were all i ever wanted. 

Cover me, cover me 
Into the night don't you see i'm all alone. 
Don't you leave me here alone thoughout the night. 
Cover me,  cover me 
Into the night, don't you see that i'm alone. 
Would you leave me here alone throughout the night
