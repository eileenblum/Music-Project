The clouds were gathering, 
the sun moved out of sight. 
Then came the rain. 
Outside the city line 
Into the darkened night 
He came to claim 
Into another town the people he could see 
He could kill with a look from his eyes. 
He is looking for you he is lookig for me. 
Upon his devil horse his figure slips away 
He hides from light 
A phantom magic man from mountains black an grey 
He rides with might 
Another circus show another broken ride 
He could fly like a bird in the air 
He is coming for you he is coming for me. 

Somewhere tomorrow. 
Somewhere today. 
From fields of sorrow 
Through winds of change 
Somewhere he'll find you , to steal your soul 
His eyes disguised to , conceal his goal 

Another circus show 
Another broken ride. 
He could kill with a look from his eyes 
He is coming for you 
He is coming for me 

Somewhere tomorrow. 
Somewhere today. 
From fields of sorrow 
Through winds of change 
Somewhere he'll find you , to steal your soul 
His eyes disguised to , conceal his goal
