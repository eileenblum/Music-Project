I heard you ccrowling across the floor
While the sun was scratching at my back door
I tasted the pleasure upon you're lips
And i saw the blood on your fingertips

Oh another night, another day
You sent my love someone else's way
You rocked and rolled while i walked the floor
What kind of fool do you take me for

Maryanne
You answered the call of the street again
Maryanne
The sidewalk's under your feet again, Maryanne

There's a time for war and a time for peace
A time or love and sweet release
I gave you twice what i asked you for
Well give it back, my baby, this is war

Fire burns and needle stings
And darkness closes on everything
I gave you love and i gave you life
Now you're trying to twist the knife

Maryanne
You answered the call of the street again
Maryanne
The sidewalk's under your feet again, Maryanne
Maryanne
You answered the call of the street again
Maryanne
The sidewalk's under your feet again, Maryanne
