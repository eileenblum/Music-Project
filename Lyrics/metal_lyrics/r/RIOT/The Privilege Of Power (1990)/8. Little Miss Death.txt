I need a reason to be cool for a little while
A bitter pill that ain't to hard to swallow
You got me runnin' like a hot wired Cadillac
A chrome-plated victory - delicious and hollow

Since you came into my life
You said you'd been invited

Little miss death
You're a vision in silver and cellophane
I'll lick the blade and you'll feel the pain
Till i can't remember my name

Tonight you're looking like a catclub cocktail
All spillin' out in your neoprane teaser
You're burning up just like this number in my pocket babe
Tequillas' tellin' me to shut up and squeez her

You got me frozen in my place
A cold cunning razor-boy
Decides be a pretty face

Little miss death
You're a vision in silver and cellophane
I'll lick the blade and you'll feel the pain
Till i can't remember my name

Too drunk to live - too young to die
That was our battle cry our alibi

Little miss death
You're screaming delightfull young Jezebelle
I'll pain your name across the gates of hell
If that's the salvation you sell
