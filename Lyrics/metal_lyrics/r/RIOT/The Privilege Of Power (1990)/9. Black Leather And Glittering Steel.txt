We drank 'till the sunrise
Rode away singin' Johnny's back again
maybe i'm wrong - maybe i've really just been away too
long

There a few who remember
Fewer still who remember why
They ain't still ready to fight but i've had the world
at my feet
And i know it's right

I wanna crawl from the wreckage again
Feel the kiss of twisted metal
Like a drink running hot in my veins
I've got a score to settle

Black leather and glittering Steel
They're calling me back
So i'm turning my head to the wheel
Black leather and glittering steel
I'm thirsty for more
So i'm sending my foot to the floor

Looks nobody's buying
Looks to me you can't go home again
So i'm riding alone
maybe the lights are on - but nobody's home

So long to my brothers
Later on once again you're left behind
Are you lashed to the mast
Or will you drown in the chair
Where i found you last ?

I wann feel the wind in my face
And the velvet shimmering limousines
Like a kiss from the queen of the damned
Like the smell of gasoline

Black leather and glittering Steel
They're calling me back
So i'm turning my head to the wheel
Black leather and glittering steel
I'm thirsty for more
So i'm sending my foot to the floor

I wanna crawl from the wreckage again
Feel the kiss of twisted metal
Like a drink running hot in my veins
I've got a score to settle

Black leather and glittering Steel
They're calling me back
So i'm turning my head to the wheel
Black leather and glittering steel
I'm thirsty for more
So i'm sending my foot to the floor
