So we went one by one, flew through the sky
Suddenly mystery, fear in my eyes.
Should i, throw mayself away from the fight
Sould i , hide and stay out of sight

Run, hide my eyes from the sun,
wait till morning has come, should i run

Desperatlely, soon i see, some fall away
Calling out, helpless shouts, dying now they lay
How i, recify my soul, i don't know
Can i, hide inside this how, let me go

Run, hide my eyes from the sun,
wait till morning has come, should i run

Should i, pull myself away from the fight
Should i, hide inside and stay our of sight.
Run, hide my eyes from the sun,
wait till morning has come, should i run
