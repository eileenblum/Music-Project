I remember the sign on the wall
Listen brothers your destiny calls.
So they left in the dead of the night
Forming armies our soldiers unite !
Sailing blindly, all around me, send them off to war.
Slowly rising, so suprising, thousand people or more
Sound the call to our country "come one and come all"

Cries of hypocrisy
filled with anger and greed
From the mouths that they feed
Letting people belive that they are free

Early morning the sun starts to shine
Bringing light to the dead and the dying
In the distance the cities still burn
Harsh resentment is all that we've learned
Some remember, gone forever, part of our history
We must question, every lesson, man's obsession and greed
Hear your cry for the dying but no one will see

Cries of hypocrisy
filled with anger and greed
From the mouths that they feed
Letting people belive that they are free
Some remember, gone forever, part of our history
We must question, every lesson, man's obsession and greed
Hear your cry for the dying but no one will see

Cries of hypocrisy
filled with anger and greed
From the mouths that they feed
Letting people belive that they are free
