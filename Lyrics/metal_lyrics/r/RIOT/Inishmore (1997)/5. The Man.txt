I'm tired of running, i'm tired of who i am
I've been obsolved from this prison which i stand.
I pray for freedom from everything i see
Somebody please set me free
Oh no i'm never looking back
No now i'm in for the attack

Here i stand, you know who i am, running for the highway
I'm the man
Here i stand, catch me if you can, burning down the highway
I'm the man

I see your justice i watch your wicked ways, steal their minds
and then you will betray.
You feed them silence and make them lose their will freedom song running still.
Oh no i'm coming after you.
No now there's nothing you can do.

Here i stand, you know who i am, running for the highway
I'm the man
Here i stand, catch me if you can, burning down the highway
I'm the man
Here i stand, you know who i am, running for the highway
I'm the man
Here i stand, catch me if you can, burning down the highway
I'm the man
Here i stand, you know who i am, i'm running long
Here i stand, catch me if you can, coming after you
I've been running hard.
I've been running long.
I've been running so long.
