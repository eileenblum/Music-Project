Down below, visions are calling you home
Where dark eyes glow, cities of crumbling stone.
So many people, turning their heads from fire
You'll never lose your desire, it's bringin you higher.

Oh your watching the signs, coming for you.
Oh your ready this time, running for the line.

Soon you'll know, your giving the best that you got
Soon it will show, the sun on your back beating hot.
One after one, your answers becoming your lies.
You'll never lose your desire, it's bringing you higher.

Oh your watching the signs, coming for you.
Oh your ready this time, running for the line.

Oh your watching the signs, coming for you.
Oh your ready this time, running for the line.
