Running the cameras on what they are waiting to say
Fixing the picture to who you will gather and pray
Some will protest and some will defy in the night
Some will cry for an ending to come, waaiting to let them selves go

Liberty, dying to set yourselves free
In your hour of darkness your fighting for freedom to be

Liberty, hurtling towards victory, from the gutters and gate
Posts your children are coming to see liberty

Controlling you mind, supressing your thoughts and beliefs
Crushing your senses conormities all that is real
Sound the call in the morning you march to the sword
paying prices for what you have done, wanting to let yourself go

Liberty, dying to set yourselves free, standing oneand for all
You must sacrifice all that you see.
Liberty, hurtling towards victory
Only god will convince them for one is for all to be free Liberty yea

Sound the call in the morning you march to the sword
paying prices for what you have done, wanting to let yourself go

Liberty, dying to set yourselves free
In your hour of darkness your fighting for freedom to be
Liberty, hurtling towards victory, from the gutters and gate
posts your children are coming to see Liberty yea
