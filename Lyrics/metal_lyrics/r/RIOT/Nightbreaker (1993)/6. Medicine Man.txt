This town has no mercy
When you're on your own
When there's no one close to you
No place to call your home
In the back alley shadows
My body yearns, the pain it grows
A needle holds the solution
Feel the sting no let it flow
A dangerous game - no place to hide
I'm looking for you to keep me satisfied

Medicine man
You hold the key - unlock the door
Like a knife in your hand
A spell that you cast for evermore

I need a shot of satisfaction
My body aches - my blood runs cold
I need a killer chain reaction
That's gonna rock me to the bone
I'm burnin' inside - i'm under the gun
You got what it takes - you know you're the one

Medicine man
You hold the key - unlock the door
Like a knife in your hand
A spell that you cast for evermore

A dangerous game - no plave to hide
I'm lookin' for you to keep me satisfied

Medicine man
You hold the key - unlock the door
Like a knife in your hand
A spell that you cast for evermore
