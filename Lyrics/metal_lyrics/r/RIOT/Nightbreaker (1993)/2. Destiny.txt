Tell me i'm crazy
I'll show you that maybe
Life is like a candle in the wind
We search for the rainbow
It seems that it won't show
But we don't worry about a thing
I'm not afraid of ever losing faith
Dreams do come true
This time the tide will turn for all to see
My dream with you

Destiny
Search for the rainbow
Endlessly - you don't know
Destinty
Seems like it won't show
Endlessly
You don't know
How many times

Right now i'll show you
The things you must go through
If you'll be kind enough to stick around
The headaches and heartdaches
Watch out for your own sake
Or you'll be buried six feet underground
I've sacrificed so much i can't turn back
Dreams do come true
I'll find a way to make it all seem clear
My dream with you

Destiny
Search for the rainbow
Endlessly - you don't know
Destinty
Seems like it won't show
Endlessly
You don't know
How many times

So head out and hold out
Except for your own doubts
There's time enough to find another way
Don't turn back or turn 'round
You'll be comming back another day
I'm not afraid of ever losing faith
Dreams do come true
This time the tide will turn for all to see
My dream with you

Destiny
Search for the rainbow
Endlessly - you don't know
Destinty
Seems like it won't show
Endlessly
You don't know
How many times
