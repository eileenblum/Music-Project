You know me you see
In your dreams so distantly
Remember what i said ?
I'll never let you go
Hold secrets deep and dark
My visions light the spark
Surrender all your fear
And take me by the hand
I've come a thousand miles
To watch you in the night
Now i won't let you go
I've got you in my sight
You feel me , you can tell
I've got you in my spell
Tonight i'll make you mine
I'll never let you go
I touch you with my eyes
You run but can not hide
I'll hold you in my hands
Then run into the night
So many times before
I've let you slip away
The time has come for more
This time i make you stay
Run
I'm on the run
Run
I'm on the run
So many times before
I've let you slip away
The time has come for more
This time i make you stay
Run
I'm on the run
Run
I'm on the run
