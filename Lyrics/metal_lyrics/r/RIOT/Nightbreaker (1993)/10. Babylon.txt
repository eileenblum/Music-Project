Unlock the gates
Unlock the doors
Cyrus waits outside no more
Laughter rose
Inside the walls
In the night this time
The ancient city falls

I'm running from the storm
It can not be too long before it's gone
I'm searching for the dawn
Touch me and my soul will be reborn
I have seen babylon

Soon to come - the mystery
She'll rise above the land and sea
Babylon the great will cry
Kings will weep and
Souls will die
The clouds are are gathering today
Feel the thunder in the streets
I hear the prophets pray

I'm running from the storm
It can not be too long before it's gone
I'm searching for the dawn
Touch me and my soul will be reborn
I have seen babylon

Nations drink the fatal wine of
Intense immortal crime
Babylon will surely fall with
Judgement day upon us all
I'm running from the storm
It can not be too long before it's gone
I'm searching for the dawn
Touch me and my soul will be reborn
I'm running from the storm
It can not be too long before it's gone
I'm searching for the dawn
Touch me and my soul will be reborn
I have seen babylon
