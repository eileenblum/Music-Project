You know my heart ain't feeling right
You walk these streets again tonight
I must be strong - but it's heard when you're away
Cause i know where you're going and the games that you play
Now these streets are growing cold
A fire burns tonight where love is gold
I'm a fool to believe in the simple things you say
I can't face tomorrow ; can't face another day

In your eyes
I see a fire burning
The hands of time keep turning - how long will you be mine ?
In your eyes
I see a life tomorrow
Filled with pain and sorrow - forsaken by the lies
in your eyes

Everyday just feels the same
Loving you is such a lonely game
In the heat of the night you hear me calling out to you
Words are spoken but your eyes show the truth

In your eyes
I see a fire burning
The hands of time keep turning - how long will you be mine ?
In your eyes
I see a life tomorrow
Filled with pain and sorrow - forsaken by the lies
in your eyes
In your eyes
I see a fire burning
The hands of time keep turning - how long will you be mine ?
In your eyes
I see a life tomorrow
Filled with pain and sorrow - forsaken by the lies
in your eyes
