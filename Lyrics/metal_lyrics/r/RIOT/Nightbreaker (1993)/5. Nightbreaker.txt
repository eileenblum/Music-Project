Remember what they told you
When you faced the burning sun
There was glory in your hands
You must be brave...
The mission must be done -
Or we will surely see the end
No need to fear
No danger can we find
Just turn away your face
And turn away your mind
Embrace the night
Wait for the shot to come
Don't turn your back and run

Nightbreaker
Explode in blinding light
Electric fires scorch the desert sand
Nightbreaker
Thunder in the night
Acid rain - it falls upon the land
Oh Nightbreaker

So many years have passed
But questions still remain -
If we search what will we find ?
Should we shed a tear
Or bow our hands in shame
Did we know or were we truly blind ?
Now the time has come
The power we must bind
This world will never be the same
We must be first in line
Marching out so bravely
Hero's one by one
Don't turn your back and run

Nightbreaker
Explode in blinding light
Electric fires scorch the desert sand
Nightbreaker
Thunder in the night
Acid rain - it falls upon the land
Oh Nightbreaker
Nightbreaker
Explode in blinding light
Electric fires scorch the desert sand
Nightbreaker
Thunder in the night
Acid rain - it falls upon the land
Oh Nightbreaker
