I was sittin' on top of the world
Happy as a fool could be
Now there's a dark cloud overhead
I need someone to rescue me
You're and earthshaker
Dream maker
I'm crying out for a miracle cure
I know that you're the one for sure

Take me home magic maker
Take me home magic maker

Livin' hard
Livin' under the gun
Cross me and i'll make you bleed
Never knew what the good book said
My eyes were closed i could no see
You're and earthshaker
Dream maker
I'm crying out for a miracle cure
I know the one for sure
Take me home magic maker
Take me home magic maker
Take me home magic maker
Take me home magic maker
