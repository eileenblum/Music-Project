Silent Screams
As they tear them apart
Take a life, sell your soul
The selfish need of a selfish heart
makes my blood run cold
In a world of selfdestruction
Where the truth is rarely seen
Next stop for the modern man
A human suicide machine
See the light in the sky
Choose to live or die
Oh the time it draws near
Stop the screams i hear
We raise our fists in anger
Don'T fool with or destiny
And silent screams are growing
We raise our fists in anger
Please stop this human tragedy
It's a cold wind that's been blowing
Reckless Hearts - Desperate souls
They pass the blame and wash their hands
Behind the walls
The blood will flow
And curse the promised land
Cry for mercy in the night
Why can'T they try and understand ?
There's no one telling them wrong from right
It's murder on demand
See the light in the sky
Choose to live or die
Oh the time it draws near
Stop the screams i hear
We raise our fists in anger
Don'T fool with or destiny
And silent screams are growing
We raise our fists in anger
Please stop this human tragedy
It's a cold wind that's been blowing
We raise our fists in anger
Don'T fool with or destiny
And silent screams are growing
We raise our fists in anger
Please stop this human tragedy
It's a cold wind that's been blowing
