Whoever lives behind these walls got an appetite for pleasure
I've seen the trail that was left behind for broken hearts and buried treasure, arms and legs, hungry lips, and a grip of steel
One kiss and you live forever; that's one love you never wanna feel
Who's sorry now?
Should never go unknown
Who's sorry now?
You made the choice, but you should've known
Run for your life
Run for your life, you've got to run
Run for your life
Run for your life
Nothing's gonna save you now
Run for your life
Run for your life
From the arms that cling and the jaws that bite
Run for your life
Run for your life
You've got to run for your life, from the kiss of death
Whatever walks behind these doors gonna eat you up alive
You want to run, but you can't resist; you know this lady's never satisfied
She's ready, ready for you with the ? to take you higher
One kiss, and you're defenceless; one bite, and your heart's on fire
Who's sorry now?
Should never go unknown
Who's sorry now?
You made the choice, but you should've known
Run for your life
Run for your life
From the arms that cling and the jaws that bite
Run for your life
Run for your life
Yeah, the thing wanna take you home tonight
Run for your life
Run for your life
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Run for your life
Run for your life
You've got to run for your life, from the kiss of death
