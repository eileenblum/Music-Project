I awoke in the darkness
A ringing in my ears
In the cold and the silence
Feels like I've slept for years

Voices in the distance
Someone speaks my name
The sound of tears and laughter
Am I dead or insane?

I'm calling, no one can hear me
I'm calling, you know where I must be

C'mon let me out
You've got to set me free
Just to even hear

Ashes to ashes
Is that what he said?
More familiar voices
Lies about the life that I had

I wanna speak that I hear though
A realisation arise
A shovel strikes the earth above
I'm being buried alive

I'm calling, no one can hear me
I'm calling, you know where I must be
Hello! You've got to set me free
Doesn't anybody hear me

I'm calling, no one can hear me
I'm calling, you know where I must be
C'mon let me out
You've got to set me free, hey...
C'mon let me out, c'mon!
You've got to set me free!
