I hear the call when the sirens scream
Into the night where an angel waits for me
She's lookin' bad she's a killer machine
I say the word and she explodes into light
Blinding power and rage
Players run to the stage
Screaming wings fill the silvery sky
Rising on pillers of flame

And we ride thundering into the sky
And we ride
On wings of eagles we fly

Full alert she is hot for the game
I sense my enemy and fire is the warning I send
A dance of death swirling miles above the rain
While mortals sleep angels swear to defend
I salute you my friend
Unafraid to the end
Devil take the high most
To hell with the rest
Now let the battle begin

And we ride thundering into the sky
And we ride
On wings of eagles we fly
Come on get up get out...

[SOLO]

Heat seekers flash headed straight for your heart
One finds the mark and a fireball rocks the clouds
Men and machines sweet and deadly we are
We rule the wind on titanium wings
Plunging back from the chase
One more champion erased
I am the last and the plaster of my art
Until I am challenged again

And we ride thundering into the sky
And we ride
On wings of eagles we fly
Come on get up get out...

And we ride thundering into the sky
And we ride
On wings of eagles we fly
Come on get up get out
