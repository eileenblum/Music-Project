I was born on these streets years ago
I was the king of the neighbourhood
Fast on my feet, I was elite
I was the star of the show

This task must be done - I will not run
I will not lay me down to die
This war I will win, so let it begin
Deep in my heart is a burning fire...

I can't let it go
Alone in the night I know I must fight for my home

Time has changed the seasons
And I will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away
These streets are getting colder
And I am growing older
Tomorrow seems so far away

What's become of us friend, we were one till the end
Now I'm alone in the streetlight gleam
This town knew our names, but nothing's the same
The places I played have forgotten the dream

I can't let it go
Alone in the night I know I must fight for my home

Time has changed the seasons
And I will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away
These streets are getting colder
And I am growing older
Tomorrow seems so far away
