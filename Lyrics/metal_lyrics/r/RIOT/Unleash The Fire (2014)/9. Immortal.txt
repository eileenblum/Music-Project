Just a young man with hopes and dreams
Full of passion
Willing to share your gifts with the world
Outside

Your time on this earth was so very brief
But your star burned so bright
You encouraged us to shine
Shine on

In simple ways you did inspire
So many people
Forming a clan spread around the world
Your tribe

Your time on this earth was so very brief
But your star burned so bright
You encouraged us to shine

Shine on through the darkest night
Your music is eternal
Through your soul has touched the sky
Through your songs you are immortal
You are immortal

Did we make your dreams come true
With our passion?
Rest in peace assured we still hold
Your light

Your time on this earth was so very brief
But your star burned so bright
You encouraged us to shine

Shine on through the darkest night
Your music is eternal
Through your soul has touched the sky
Through your songs you are immortal
You are immortal
You are immortal
