We come from the mountains
We come from the plains

It runs through our veins

Our defiance is a source of pride
Brothers of metal we stand unified
Join us now in this call to arms
We fight for the right to be heard

Let me hear you
Fight fight fight
Get on your feet, put your fists in the air
Let me hear you
Fight fight fight
Show your true colors, stand up if you dare

Our numbers are few
But our strength is immense
Unsheathe your sword
Let the battle commence

Our defiance is a source of pride
Brothers of metal we stand unified
