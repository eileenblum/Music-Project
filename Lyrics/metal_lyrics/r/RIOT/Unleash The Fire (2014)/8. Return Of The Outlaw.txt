Sundown at th edge of town
A dark figure approaches
He needs no introduction
Everyone knows who he is

They say he shot a man dead in San Antone
And two more in Memphis
Deeds are the measure of a man
So don't take your chances

When Six Gun Sal rides into town
Nobody wants to be around
Shut your mouth, forget what you saw
It's Six Gun Sal, return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw

Weathered skin and a heart of stone
A lonely desperado
Cold black eyes with deeds to match
His grit is not bravado

When Six Gun Sal rides into town
Nobody wants to be around
Shut your mouth, forget what you saw
It's Six Gun Sal

Rumor travels faster than sound
Cross him boy and you'll be in the ground
His fuse is short and he's quick on the draw
Six Gun Sal, return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw

When Six Gun Sal rides into town
Nobody wants to be around
Shut your mouth, forget what you saw
It's Six Gun Sal

Rumor travels faster than sound
Cross him boy and you'll be in the ground
His fuse is short and he's quick on the draw
Six Gun Sal, return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
