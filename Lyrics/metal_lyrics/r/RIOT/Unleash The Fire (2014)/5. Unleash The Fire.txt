There's a charge in the air
As if it will ignite
So much furl, one little spark
Will set the room alight
Alright, unleash the fire

Anticipating what's to come
Eager hearts start to race
Thunder rumbles and lights come up
As power fills this place

Something comes over me
When I hear the crowd roar
Stoking the blaze inside
As I come back for more

Unleash the fire
Unleash the fire in your soul
Can't fight desire
The hunger burns out of control
Unleash the fire
Unleash the fire

Alright, unleash the fire
Feeding off your energy
The power is magnified
Burning up 'til it overflows
Returning amplified

Something comes over me
When I hear the crowd roar
Stoking the blaze inside
As I come back for more

Unleash the fire
Unleash the fire in your soul
Can't fight desire
The hunger burns out of control

Unleash the fire
Unleash the fire in your soul
Can't fight desire
The hunger burns out of control
Unleash the fire
Unleash the fire
Unleash the fire
