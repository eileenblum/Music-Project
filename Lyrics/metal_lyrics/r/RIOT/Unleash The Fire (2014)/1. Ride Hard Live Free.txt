Rising above me the eagles unleash
A downpoor of fire and steel
A mission for freedom with hearts made of stone
Relentless attacking at will

The fighters give chase till it's done
Their fury is second to none

She flies high across the crimson sky
To seek out our foe, the demons in disguise
Ride hard live free the battle rages on

Racing with vengeance the gypsy she burns
The enemy hot on her heels
Night skies on fire, the devil's desire
To heighten the pain that one feels

The fighters give chase till it's done
Their fury is second to none

She flies high across the crimson sky
To seek out our foe, the demons in disguise
She dances on fire at speed of light
To challenge the devil to another fight
Ride hard live free the battle rages on

She flies high across the crimson sky
To seek out our foe, the demons in disguise
She dances on fire at speed of light
To challenge the devil to another fight
Ride hard live free the battle rages on

Ride hard live free
Ride hard live free
