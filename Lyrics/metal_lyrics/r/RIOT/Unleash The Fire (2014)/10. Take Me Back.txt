Remember the city lights
With friends by our side
Running streets wild
Chasing down all our dreams
Our fears cast aside

Laughing, rocking
Drinking, fighting
We felt so alive
The air electric
There was no stopping
Young hearts filled with drive

One more time
Let's light up the road
Feel the wind in our hair
Say the word
Name the time and the place
You know I will be there

Come, take me back
To the time
We were young and headstrong
Oh, take me back
To that place
Where I belong

They say you can never return
Those days are dead and gone
But we write our story
With guts and with glory
Our dreams live on

One more time
Let's light up the road
Feel the wind in our hair
Say the word
Name the time and the place
You know I will be there

Come, take me back
To the time
We were young and headstrong
Oh, take me back
To that place
Where I belong

One more time
Let's light up the road
Feel the wind in our hair
Say the word
Name the time and the place
You know I will be there

Come, take me back
To the time
We were young and headstrong
Oh, take me back
To that place
Where I belong

Remember the city lights
With friends by our side
Come, take me back

Take me back, come on!
