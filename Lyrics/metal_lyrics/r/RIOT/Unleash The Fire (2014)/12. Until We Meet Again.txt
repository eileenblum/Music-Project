My old friend, has a really been another year
Life goes on, but it's not the same without you here
Still find myself
Grabbing a phone to give you a call

I was young when you came and took me under your wing
To become a friend, a brother and a blessing

You gave me a chance to have my own voice be heard
And did not ask anything from me in return

Together we'd kick back and create some songs to share
Melodies sung in unison like an evening prayer

Childhood dreams, taking our music all around the world
Memories of us making our fantasies come alive

Until we meet again my friend
We will join and sing along
Until we meet again my friend
We will celebrate your song

Until we meet again my friend
We will join and sing along
Until we meet again my friend
We will celebrate your song

Until we meet again my friend
We will join and sing along
Until we meet again my friend
We will celebrate your song
