Since I was young, I've wanted to soar
Free through the air on wings of steel
In the realm of eagles
I would touch the sky

Through discipline and sacrifice
Training complete, I'm ready to fight
For God and country
I will give my life

Take to the air
All our fighters rise
We must defend our land

Light up the sky with flames
Rolling and driving to line up the foe in our sights
Fighting as brothers
As we all watch our enemies fall from the sky
Fall from the sky

Imperiling thoughts steal into my mind
About my family waiting at home
Will they be proud of me
Even if I fail?

The task at hand is easy enough
If I ignore my foe is a man
With a family of his own
To be left alone

Take to the air
All our fighters rise
We must defend our land

Light up the sky with flames
Rolling and driving to line up the foe in our sights
Fighting as brothers
As we all watch our enemies fall from the sky
Fall from the sky

Light up the sky with flames
Rolling and driving to line up the foe in our sights
Fighting as brothers
As we all watch our enemies fall from the sky
Fall from the sky
Fall from the sky
