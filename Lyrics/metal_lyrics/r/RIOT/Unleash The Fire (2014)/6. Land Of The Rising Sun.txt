On wings of eagles we soar
Headed across the Asian seas
A distant thunder roaring
Closing in our destiny

We touch down in Narita
The masses were a sight to see
Headed toward the city
Tokyo rose, she waits for me

Shine on, the gift of love is through our song
Shine on, the people sing along

Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun

Fight or fall we chanted
Fists held high and voices strong
A universal language
In music we create a bond

With open arms we're welcomed
Your warriors, we came to play
A night of metal magic
Mark and Masa lead the way

Shine on, the gift of love is through our song
Shine on, the people sing along

Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun

Shine on was our battle cry
Hand in hand 'til the day we die

Shine on, the gift of love is through our song
Shine on, the people sing along

Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
Ah, the Land of the Rising Sun
