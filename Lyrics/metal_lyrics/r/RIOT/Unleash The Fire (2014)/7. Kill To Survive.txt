Lately I've become a sort of stranger to myself
Living on a broken dreams trapped in my private hell
I don't know what to think or feel inside
Lost it all when I left my soul behind
Build a mighty fortress on my grave

Lightning cracks the sky
Raising hordes of angels
Weary of this world

Fighting, raging through the battle, warrior
Kingdoms washed into the sea
Spirits cast the spell of darkness, glorious
Madness reigns in all our lives

Kill to survive
Kill to survive

All the magic's fading and the war will never end
Blooded bodies butchered by the demons in my head
I gotta feeling I know what you might say
I gotta feeling it's time to get away
I gotta feeling that we've both go insane

Lightning cracks the sky
Raising hordes of angels
Weary of this world

Fighting, raging through the battle, warrior
Kingdoms washed into the sea
Spirits cast the spell of darkness, glorious
Madness reigns in all our lives

My wretched soul
In burning bright
Your blackened heart
To kill is to survive

Lightning cracks the sky
Raising hordes of angels
Weary of this world

Fighting, raging through the battle, warrior
Kingdoms washed into the sea
Spirits cast the spell of darkness, glorious
Madness reigns in all our lives

Fighting, raging through the battle, warrior
Kingdoms washed into the sea
Spirits cast the spell of darkness, glorious
Madness reigns in all our lives
Madness reigns in all our lives

Kill to survive
Yeah, Kill to survive!
