Riding the thunder, black leather that shines
Leaving this city and memories behind
Will I return and back on these streets again
Will I crash and burn?

Back alley ways they're calling my name
Unleashing the rebel, this man I became
I lived and I lied and on these roads again
My street will ride

Raise your fists up to our brother man
Johnny lead us to your promised land

Ride on with strength and will
Raise up your blackened shield
Fly high on your wings of steel
Shine on metal warrior

Crowned me your king, I am the chosen one
Leading my way I am second to none
You call out my name, but in the end I've learned
That it's all the same

The love I felt for these bloodstreets I roam
This concrete jungle I once called my home
I lived my life fast and now I running from
My checkered past

Raise your fists up to our brother man
Johnny lead us to your promised land

Ride on with strength and will
Raise up your blackened shield
Fly high on your wings of steel
Shine on metal warrior

Riding fast as lightning, racing with the wind
Rolling with a fury, a fire burns within
The angry beast is howling, raging down below
Dancing with the devil, heavy metal thunder

Raise your fists up to our brother man
Johnny lead us to your promised land

Ride on with strength and will
Raise up your blackened shield
Fly high on your wings of steel
Shine on metal warrior
Shine on metal warrior
Metal warrior
