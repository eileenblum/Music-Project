Even the most docile man has his limit
The point beyond which he can't go
Only a fool would damage a man's spirit
And not expect him to explode

There comes that moment
One must fight to survive

Bring the hammer down
Strike with fury and force
Bring the hammer down
Hands of fate will set the course
Bring the hammer

It makes no sense to go looking for a trouble
A wiser man awoids the stride
When tempers flare, decorum with crumble
There are no rules in the fight for life

There comes that moment
One must fight to survive

Bring the hammer down
Strike with fury and force
Bring the hammer down
Hands of fate will set the course
Bring the hammer

Even the most docile man has his limit
The point beyond which he can't go
Only a fool would damage a man's spirit
And not expect him to explode

There comes that moment
One must fight to survive

Bring the hammer down
Strike with fury and force
Bring the hammer down
Hands of fate will set the course
Bring the hammer

Bring the hammer down
Strike with fury and force
Bring the hammer down
Hands of fate will set the course
Bring the hammer
