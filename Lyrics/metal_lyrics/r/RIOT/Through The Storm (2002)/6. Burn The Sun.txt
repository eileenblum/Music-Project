Off in the distance the engines they burn, burning through the night
I`m heading for glory, it`s time to take flight, soon my people will learn
Now I fly, like an eagle, I`m starting to climb over
Suddenly, vengeance is all that I see yeah 

Fire from the sky, fury from above
I`m an angel of mercy, a devil of love
Just watch us, we burn the sun

Fires are burning and many will die, glory calls to night
I flight with my brothers as one by their side onward towards the light
Heading in to smoke I am starting to see over
Let it be, the hour is coming to me, yeah

Fire from the sky, fury from above
I`m an angel of mercy, a devil of love
Just watch us, we burn the sun

Glory by my side, time to set me free
I`m an angel of death or a serpent of love
Just watch us, we burn the sun
Now I fly, like an eagle, I`m starting to climb over
Suddenly, vengeance is all that I see yeah

Fire from the sky, fury from above
I`m an angel of mercy, a devil of love
Just watch us, we burn the sun
Glory by my side, time to set me free
I`m an angel of death or a serpent of love
Just watch us, we burn the sun
Oh, it`s burning down baby, fury from above, oh
To my Head

It`s not my life, you set upon me all over I know
It ain`t right I`ve severed all connections that would grow
And in my life I`ve been around to know
Deep inside it`s your eyes that show, it goes right back to my head
I`m feeling something, it goes right back to my head
I feel you watching me, yeah, ooh I can`t run

A better man would suffer surely too, `cause you`re not done
Your love is like a bullet from a gun, 
I turn around and I know your name never found but I feel your stare
It goes right back to my head, oh I`m feeling what you do
It goes right back to my head, oh there`s someone watching me
It goes right back to my head, I feel, oh I feel you watching me
It goes right back to my head, I can`t run, I can`t run
It goes right back to my head, you`re coming, you`re coming after me
It goes right back to my head, this ain`t right no more
This ain`t right, it goes right back to my head
Oh I know, I know, I know, I know it goes right back to my head
I can`t run, I can`t run, no turning back
It goes right back to my head, yeah
