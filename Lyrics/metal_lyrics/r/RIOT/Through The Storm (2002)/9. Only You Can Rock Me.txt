Who's takin' time out
We'll take your shout out
We're the boys, we got nothin' to lose
I've had enough now of school stuff now
You ain't with us then it's just bad news 
Only you can rock me, rock me
Come on back now, do it again
Only you can rock me, rock me
Kickin' off just like a hurricane 
We can't wait from day to day
Cause we've got somethin' to say
We can't wait from day to day
Cause we've got somethin' to say 
Come out on the street now
On every corner
Breakin' out and we're doin' what we wanna
Just like a jewel shines in the night
She burns so hot out under the street light 
Only you can rock me, rock me
Come on back now, do it again
Only you can rock me, rock me
Kickin' off just like a hurricane 
We are here and there's no end We'll keep on comin' again
We are here and there's no end We'll just keep comin' again
