The tearing hand of plunder seem to burn into my soul
I`ve learned enough to wonder if I`ll ever gain control
You infiltrait, you desacreate the bodies of the one
Who testifies to others of the damage you have done
You never understand, there`s darkness lying at your hand

The hour glass it stands alone for me to see
Oh I`m lost inside this world
I`m feeling so confused
I can`t believe, I`m sentenced here to die

The desperate hands of fortune seem to gather all around
To wait inside the darkness just to see what I have found
You never understand, just a lonely dying man

The hour glass it stands alone for me to see
Oh I`m lost inside this world
I`m feeling so alone
I can`t believe, I`m sentenced here for life 
Just a broken man, I see the hands they turn for me

The hour glass it stands alone for me to see
Oh I`m lost inside this world
I`m feeling so alone
I can`t believe, I`m sentenced here for life 
Just a broken man, I see the hands they turn for me

The hour glass it stands alone for me to see
Oh I`m lost inside this world
I`m feeling so alone
I can`t believe, I`m sentenced here to die
Oh I`m lost inside this world
I`m feeling so confused
I can`t believe, I`m sentenced here to die
Here I lie, oh oh I can hear you, I can see you
Oh, I`m a broken man, there`s damage done, baby, oh
