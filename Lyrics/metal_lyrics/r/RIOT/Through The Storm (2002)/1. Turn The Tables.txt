Nothing left for me to see but my sense it follows me
I feel I`m lost under the sun, I live in fear 
But I won`t run, no I won`t run
No more praise for you at all it`s time for you to fall
I`m dealing with it, now it`s over
We give a pound and you want three, it`s time to make you see

Now I`m here to let you know
Look out, look out, ride the tide that`s rising from the sea
Look out, turn the tables over 
I`m here to let you know that we are free, yeah
Ooh I`m here to tell you oh listen to me

Your deafened ears they fall upon, beg for mercy but get none
You left my people cold and tired, but anger grows within the fire
First there`s one and then there`s no more
See them coming off the shore

We`re dealing with it now it`s over
See the writing on the wall, it`s time for you to fall
A better man than you will say - look out look out
Rise the fire that`s burning into me, look out, turn the tables over
I`m here to tell you all that we are free
No more praise for you at all, it`s time for you to fall

We`re dealing with it now it`s over
Give a pound and you want three forced to make to make you see
Now I`m here to let you know
Look out, look out, ride the tide that`s rising from the sea
Look out, turn the tables over 
A better man than you will set us free
Look out, look out turn the tables over
I`m here to tell you all that we are free, yeah
Look out, oh yeah, look out, no more fear
Not afraid, no more fear, follow me now
