I remember sudden distant sound
Guilt and leverage mark my way
I try to take myself a thousand steps from here
Somewhere something makes me stay
I recall a broken spirit traveling down the road
Never more his images have burned upon the floor, floor, floor

Let it out, the chains revolving in my mind, fight on
Tear it out, death is calling me this time
Draw the line, a simple man hands upon his stone
Spin his wheel for a dime
He sheds a tear of two and covers up his soul
He did not ever speak his mind
Rattle on, the masters keep him like a frightened dog
Battle scars, the fortune of his heart will kill us all, all, all

Let it out, the chains revolving in my mind, fight on
Tear it out, death is calling me this time
Draw the line, oh you feel like there`s nowhere at all
You feel you`re alone at the door
It`s alright you`ll see, yeah

Let it out, the chains revolving in my mind, fight on
Tear it out, death is calling me this time
Draw the line

Let it out, the chains revolving in my mind, fight on
Tear it out, death is calling me this time
Draw the line
Oh yeah, let it out, let it out
