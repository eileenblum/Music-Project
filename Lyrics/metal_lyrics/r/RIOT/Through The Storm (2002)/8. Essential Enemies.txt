My hands are always open, my ground is nearly shaking
Follow to each endeavor to bring my soul to closure
I find no certainly, my eyes can`t be set free
Essential enemies flowing through me, my life I see

My blood runs cold and darkened within my chemistry 
I found my soul has sharpened the knives of life for me
I bring no certainly tomorrow end, I see
Essential enemies flowing through me, my life I see

My hands are always open, my ground is shattered still
The sound of silence shatters, my life a bitter pill
With my own certainly, testing my sanity
Essential enemies flowing through me, my life I see
