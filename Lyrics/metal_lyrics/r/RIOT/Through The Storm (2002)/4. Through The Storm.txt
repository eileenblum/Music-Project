Here the sound of all this silence
You're damned to hell if you don`t
Destination of the righteous
You break the spell, towards the light

In an empty room you sit alone and realize
You can`t believe yourself no more
I`ve been a thousand miles and more, so beautiful
I`ve killed ten soldiers with my sword to bring you to my knees
I can not wait no longer for you, we`ve past out last escape
There`s no way I can go on
I`m here to meet my end
Hell would be alright now
I can`t hide it anymore

Passing through the storm
I see my life and pass it by
I can`t complete my life and why I`ve battled armies 
On the shore line of Corsica and more
I`ve knelt before the eyes of god and stumbled to his throne
We`re sailed the oceans of the world to sacrifice ourselves
And just to look into your eyes I`d give my very life

Passing through the storm
I see my life and pass it by
I can`t complete my life and why I`ve battled armies 
On the shore line of Corsica and more
I`ve knelt before the hand of god and stumbled to his throne
I`ve sailed the oceans of the world to sacrifice my soul
And just to look into your eyes I`d give my very life
I`ve battled armies on the shores, oh I`d give my life
I`ve knelt before the hand of god, soul life
I`d give my very soul
I`ve sailed the oceans of the world, soul, soul life
All just to look into your eyes, oh yeah
I`ve battled armies on the shores, give my soul
I`ve knelt before the hands of god, yeah
