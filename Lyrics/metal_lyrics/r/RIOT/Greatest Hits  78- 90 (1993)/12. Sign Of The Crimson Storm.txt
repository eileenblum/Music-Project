Oh god what have i done ? In the shadows on the dark
side Neath the skies of crimson doom In the streets i
hear the wind cry Evil sings the devil's tune On your
knees and pray for mercy Let god hear us on this day
Or in the acid rain our bones will lay Oh cry cry for a
world that's torn Cry for a child unborn For it's the
sign of the crimson storm Desperate people in the city
Foolish games of greed and wealth On themselves
they have no pity They are victims of themselves
Gotta make you pay for mercy Let god hear us on this
day Or in the acid rain our bones will lay Oh cry cry
for a world that's torn Cry for a child unborn For it's
the sign of the crimson storm Oh god what have i done
? In the shadows on the dark side Neath the skies of
crimson doom In the streets i hear the wind cry Evil
sings the devil's tune On your knees and pray for
mercy Let god hear us on this day Or in the acid rain
our bones will lay. Oh cry cry for a world that's torn
Cry for a child unborn For it's the sign of the crimson
storm Oh cry cry for a world that's torn Cry for a child
unborn For it's the sign of the crimson storm
