I'm travelin' in my car, I call my automobile,
Something's sayin', boy you got to go on.
I'm feelin' overdrive, you're sittin' at my side.
Can you hear my wheels begin to squeal ?
I can't go no more,
My foot's to the floor.
We'll be lucky to get out alive,
In overdrive, in overdrive.
I'm feelin' overdrive, you're sittin' at my side.
Can you hear my wheels begin to burn ?
I got my foot to the floor,
My hands on your clutch.
I'm gonna make my pistons pump,
Right through the roof.
I can't go no more,
My foot's to the floor.
We'll be lucky to get out alive,
In overdrive, in overdrive.
I can't go no more,
My foot's to the floor.
We'll be lucky to get out alive.
In overdrive, in overdrive.
Yeah, come on.
Oh, hit the highway,
And don't look back.
Ah, can you feel my hot rod?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, come on.
Oh shake me, yeah, come on.
I'm in overdrive, look out, look out
