Well I've been riding all across this land I've been trying for so long now to track down this cold hearted man
I'm running short on time can't let him get to the border line I'm a ruthless man yes I am
Gunfighter hell's rider you better go for your gun gunfighter hell's rider you're gonna pay for what you've done
I remember it well I'm gonna send you straight to hell
It happened down by the Rio Grande when I was just a kid he burned through town like a raging fire I'll never forget what he did
And lying in the sand was my daddy with a six gun in his hand by the outlaw's gun he made his final stand
Gunfighter hell's rider you better go for your gun gunfighter hell's rider you're gonna pay for what you've done
I remember it well I'm gonna send you straight to hell gunfighter
Well I've been riding all across this land I've been trying for so long now to track down this cold hearted man
I'm running short on time can't let him get to the border line oh I'm a ruthless man yes I am
Gunfighter hell's rider you better go for your gun gunfighter hell's rider you're gonna pay for what you've done
Gunfighter hell's rider you better go for your gun gunfighter hell's rider you're gonna pay for what you've done
I remember it well I'm gonna send you straight to hell gunfighter
