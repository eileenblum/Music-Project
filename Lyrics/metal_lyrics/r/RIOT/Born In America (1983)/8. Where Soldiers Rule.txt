Leaves have fallen 'cross the path we once have slaved is it long before we catch the break of day
Out in the fields we carry on our broken journey straight path ahead all we ask is hope and glory
A voice it cries on through the night it never dies here poisoned rain cuts in through the crimson sky
Out in the fields we carry on the lonely distance straight path ahead all we ask is no resistance 
Aah aah aah aah aah aah
Have we led ourselves astray have we lost the light of day
Can we hear our leaders call will we learn we're one and all is no man ever save 
Where soldiers rule where soldiers rule
Through sand and rain full moon in sight there lies our stand on through the night
Out in the fields our leaders call straight paths ahead soldiers rule this all
Have we led ourselves astray have we lost the light of day
Can we hear our leaders call will we learn we're one and all is no man ever save 
Where soldiers rule where soldiers rule
