Passion and pleasure it's always the same playing with fire it's a dangerous game yeah
Dark like your eyes dark like the night it's deep within me a spell I can't hide
And you burn in me just like fire on the raging sea like a storm from inside like the thunder from up in the sky
There's no escaping that look in your eyes though I can see you through your own disguise yeah
My soul's in prison all locked up in chains no chance for release you burn in my veins
And you burn in me just like fire on the raging sea like a storm from inside like the thunder from up in the sky
And you burn in me just like fire on the raging sea like a storm from inside like the thunder from up in the sky
You burn in me oh oh you burn oh you burn in me you burn you burn ooh ooh ooh whoa you burn
