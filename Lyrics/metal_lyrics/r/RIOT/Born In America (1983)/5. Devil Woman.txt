Hmm mm mm mm I've had nothing but bad luck since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you sweet lady answered in your mystical course
Crystal ball on the table showin' the future the past
Same chappel of evil eyes and I knew it was the spell she cast
She's just a devil woman with evil on her mind beware the devil woman she's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman with evil on her mind beware the devil woman she's gonna get you from behind
Give me the ring on your finger let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger giving you what you hadn't planned huh huh
I take the potion she offered me I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes and I wondered what I came there for oh
She's just a devil woman with evil on her mind beware the devil woman she's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman with evil on her mind 
Beware the devil woman she's gonna get you from behind from behind from behind
I don't want you anymore and stay away
If your're out on a moonlit night be careful of the neighbourhood strays
Have a lady with long black hair try to win you with her feminine ways
Crystal ball on the table showin' the future the past
Same chappel of evil eyes you better get out of there fast
She's just a devil woman with evil on her mind beware the devil woman she's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman with evil on her mind beware the devil woman ooh ooh
She's just a devil woman you know she's gonna hide beware the devil woman from behind
She's just a devil woman beware the devil woman ooh she's the one
She's just a devil woman yeah beware the devil woman
She's just a devil woman she's gonna get you
