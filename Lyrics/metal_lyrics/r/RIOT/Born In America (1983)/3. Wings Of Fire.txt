When the moon is black never turning back in the castle walls
The suit of armor shines through the ruins of time I can hear them call
Oh the ground it is burning the seasons are turning it's time that we planned the attack
The medival call it cries for us all now there is no turning back
We'll rise with the sun this task must be done driving them into the sea
The king he must fall or death to us all we must win this one victory
Wings of fire take me higher burning your way through the night
Wings of fire take me higher the battle is raging in flight we'll have victory on wings of fire
Oh the war it wages the battle it rages long into the night
The warrior's falling there's destiny calling his blood drains from his mortal life
The castle's on fire flames reaching higher burning a hole in the sky
And from it will fall freedom for all shouting for our victory call
Wings of fire take me higher burning your way through the night
Wings of fire take me higher the battle is raging in flight we'll have victory on wings of fire
Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah
Wings of fire take me higher burning your way through the night
Wings of fire take me higher the battle is raging in flight 
Wings of fire take me higher burning your way through the night
Wings of fire take me higher the battle is raging in flight we'll have victory on wings of fire
