Running from the law for something I did not do fearful of the lies fighting for the truth
I can't let them catch me my life it will be done so when evening comes I'll be on the run
Running through the hills got no place to hide racing with the wind I got you by my side
A fugitive chasing after destiny freedom never shines oh down on me yeah
Running from the law reaching for the sky never turn my back on shadows in the night running from the law
Their sights are set on me I must keep up the pace I feel them getting near I won't give up the chase
And when the morning comes if they're not at my door I'll keep myself alive running ever more
Running from the law reaching for the sky never turn my back on shadows in the night oh running from the law oh oh
Aaaah running from the law for something I did not do fearful of the lies fighting for the truth oh
A fugitive chasing after destiny freedom never shines down on me yeah
Running from the law reaching for the sky never turn my back on shadows in the night
Running from the law running from the law running from the law
