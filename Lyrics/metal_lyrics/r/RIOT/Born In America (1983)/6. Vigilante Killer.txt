Oh walking through the streets taking life in your hands the boy's on the corner's sixteen but a man
He may ask for money with a flick knife make a stand he doesn't even know he walked right into your hands
He knows he's doing wrong but he's sure he's doing right the punks would stop their killing if someone put up a fight
New York Central Park ain't no place to cruise at night he's looking for blood bet there's more spilled tonight
Vigilante killer he's a vengance morbid man vigilante killer but they don't understand
The tv says he's killing but they love him just the same the crime rates gone down and we don't even know your name
Get you outta town you hurt with all the pain we'll make your name immortal 'cause you made our streets the same
You were a victim of crime now a victim of the law guardian angels even joined for the cause
Get you outta town you hurt with all the pain we'll make your name immortal you made our streets the same
Vigilante killer he's a vengance morbid man vigilante killer but they don't understand
Vigilante killer he's a vengance morbid man vigilante killer but they don't understand
Walking through the streets taking life in your hands the boy's on the corner's sixteen but a man
He may ask for money with a flick knife make a stand he doesn't even know he walked right into your hands
He knows he's doing wrong but he's sure he's doing right the punks would stop their killing if someone put up a fight
New York Central Park ain't no place to cruise at night he's looking for blood bet there's more spilled tonight
Vigilante killer he's a vengance morbid man vigilante killer but they don't understand
Vigilante killer he's a vengance morbid man vigilante killer but they don't understand aah
