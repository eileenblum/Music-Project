Yeah yeah burning up the night that was early afternoon won't be home tonight there's nothing left to do
Send myself astray I'm out on the prowl head on hand in hand lead me to the promised land
I'm gonna lead you to the promised land whoa oh aah ooh
Ooh time and again my love is on the line once we touched the sun but now I'm on the run
Nothing left to say come take me by the hand lay down on the ground so I'll lead you to the promised land yeah 
I wanna lead you to the promised land yeah yeah yeah yeah whoa oh oh oh what the hell cook it
Oh burning up the night that was early afternoon I won't be home tonight there's nothing left to do
Send myself astray I'm out on the prowl head on hand in hand lead me to the promised land yeah
I wanna lead you to the promised land yeah yeah hey now whoa oh oh oh yeah hey
Lead you I wanna lead you lead you to the promised land
I wanna lead you baby lead you baby ah ah aah whoa oh oh oh
Lead you I wanna lead you lead you to the promised land
Lead you ooh I wanna lead you lead you to the promised land
Yeah uh uh yeah yeah hey whoa oh oh oh yeah lead you
