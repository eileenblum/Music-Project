Aah racing my motor the steel is hard the feel is fine
Moves just like a rocket but I will break the speed of time
Don't need no pit stop baby you know I'm running hot and I'm tough and I'm feeling mean 
Heavy metal machine heavy metal machine ah aah
Cut through the wind a ball of fire on the loose
Ooh don't try and stop me I'm sweating steel and I'm spitting juice
Don't need no pit stop baby you know I'm running hot and I'm tough and I'm feeling mean 
Heavy metal machine heavy metal machine got to keep it clean aah heavy metal machine oh yeah aaah
Heading for nowhere I could be heading straight for you
You can't escape me no matter what you do
Burn up the ground I'm gonna cut you down I move so fast I can't be seen 
Heavy metal machine heavy metal machine got to keep it clean aah
Heavy metal machine aah yeah aah yeah come on huh huh
