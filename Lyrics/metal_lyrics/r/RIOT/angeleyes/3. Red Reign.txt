From the far north eastern wall
To the asian planes
Son of Jah runs the morning call
And all the children came
Running hiding from reality
Sudden winds of change
hear the sound of your refrain

Oh no, red reign coming over me
God knows, god knows how they lie
Oh no, all the pain that should never be
Red reign
God knows how we try

Summer blood washes through your tears
From the sacred square
They deny you through all your years
innocence shared
Coming over what i's got to be
Got no one to blame
Hear the sound of your refrain

Oh no, red reign coming over me
God knows, god knows how they lie
Oh no, all the pain that should never be
Red reign
God knows how we try, oh we try

Running from reality
Sudden winds of change
Hear the yound of your refrain

Oh no, red reign coming over me
God knows, god knows how they lie
Oh no, all the pain that should never be
Red reign
God knows how we die, how we die
