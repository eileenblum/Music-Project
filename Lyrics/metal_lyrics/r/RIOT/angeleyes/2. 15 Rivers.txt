Spreading wings across the water
Through the oceans that i fly
Hearing sounds of sistant laughter
Oh my people fall and die
I set sail on seas of sorrow
I cry fifteen rivers wide
I look towards tomorrow
with silence in my eyes
I don't care, i keep my eyes upon tomorrow
and i will find yeah
I don't mind cause i'm through with all this sorrow
and i will try, try

Sail your soul upon the ocean
I'm turning fifteen rivers wide
Searching for the land i came from
hope alone will guide me through the night

I look upon the madness of the river
I carry fortune in my hand
From silince i deliver
The words from which we strand
I set out, i set my sold across the sky
Move out, i can hear the distant cry
Sailing youls that i deliver
Now that i'll be running through the night
I don't care, i keep my eyes upon tomorrow
and i will find yeah
I don't mind cause i'm through with all this sorrow
and i will try, try

Sail your soul upon the ocean
I'm turning fifteen rivers wide
Searching for the land i came from
hope alone will guide me through the night
