Touch the hand of fate and you know, you can see the world
far beyond reality you will go.
Step inside my fantasy and you will start to see.
All the strange illusions that i know
Eyes that cry with no tears to show, mouths that move but don't
speak.
I can help you to find, this world that you seek.

So we go, turning the hands of time, going on and on
Searching until we find, land of fantasy.

Close the doors of your confusion just let it slip away.
So alone we'll stumble though your memory.
One by one you'll learn of things that others will refute.
Understanding more will make you free.
eyes are wide but you can not see a flash of light in the dark
I can teach you to feel, a fire's first spark.

So we go, turning the hands of time, going on and on
Searching until we find, on until we find, believeing in all we see,
belivieng in all we see, remembering endlessly, land of fantasy
