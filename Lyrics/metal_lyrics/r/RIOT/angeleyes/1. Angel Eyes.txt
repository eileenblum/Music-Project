Maybe nobody told you, you don'T know whi i am
I'm not looking to show you, when a man is a man
I've been telling you, you've been gone for so long
I've been telling you, don't you know
that it's wrong. yea
I ain't giving no reasons, i didn't telling you why.
I'm just looking for freedom, from this deadly desire
I've been telling you, you've been gone for so long
I've been telling you, don't you know that it's wrong

Angel eyes, angel eyes, angel eyes

I've been telling you, you've been gone for so long
I've been telling you, don't you know that
it's wrong.yea

Angel eyes, angel eyes, angel eyes
