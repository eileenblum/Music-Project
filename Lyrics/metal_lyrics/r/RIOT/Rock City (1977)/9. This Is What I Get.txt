This is what I get for loving you.
This is what I get for being true.
This is what I get, for taking all you put me through.
But I'd do it again, 'cause I'm still in love with you.
It's been a long time, since I've seen you,
And I'm longing for your touch.
You left me, without a warning, yes you did,
You know I, need you so much, so much.
This is what I get for loving you.
This is what I get for being true.
This is what I get, for taking all you put me through.
But I'd do it again, 'cause I'm still in love with you.
Then he came along, and he took you, right by surprise.
Now I'm alone, and I got those teardrops in my eyes.
I told myself, this would happen, many times before.
Now I find myself, looking at the world, face down to the floor.
This is what I get for loving you.
This is what I get for being true.
This is what I get, for taking all you put me through.
But I'd do it gain, 'cause I'm still in love with you.
This is what I get for loving you.
This is what I get for being true.
This is what I get, for taking all you put me through.
But I'd do it again, 'cause I'm still in love with you, yeah.
Do it again, 'cause I'm still in love with you.
This is what I get for loving you,
This is what I get for being true.
This is what I get for loving you,
This is what I get for being true.
