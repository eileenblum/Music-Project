A tender lovin' woman, needs a hard lovin' man,
To give her, peace of mind, from the start.
Lovin' hard as a rock, kissin' soft as a roll,
Screaming, lightning, shooting straight through your heart.
Heart of fire, you're full of desire,
Burn your blues away.
Little heart breaker, you're such a, soul shaker.
Come and give your man what he's askin' for.
My cards are on the table, I'm ready, are you able?
I'll give you lovin', 'till you say no more, no more, no more.
Heart of fire, you're full of desire,
Burn your blues away.
Heart of fire, you're full of desire,
Burn your blues away.
