I've seen lightning, and I've fought fire,
But I've never, met a girl like you, no.
You possess a magic potion, you put a spell on me.
You're like the moon, sitting above a raging sea.
You're my gypsy queen,
You're my lovely dove.
You're my gypsy queen,
I don't care, if it's just lust.
Watch out, below, 'cause this girl is on the prowl,
She'll get you somehow.
She want's, some fun, traveling around from town to town.
She'll never settle down.
You're my gypsy queen,
You're my lovely dove.
You're my gypsy queen,
I don't care, if it's just love.
You're my gypsy queen,
You're my lovely dove.
You're my gypsy queen,
I don't care, if it's lust.
You're my gypsy queen,
You're my lovely dove.
You're my gypsy queen,
I don't care, if it's just love.
