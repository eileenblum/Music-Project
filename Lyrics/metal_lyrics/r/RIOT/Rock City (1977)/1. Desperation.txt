Been on the road for fourteen days,
Got six more left to go.
The rain is pounding down on my hood,
I got a heavy load in tow.
You been so cruel to your lover boy,
Had to get up, get away.
Don't need your lovin', don't want no babies,
I've had my thrills for the day.
Desperation roll me,
I'm rollin' over to you.
Desperation roll me,
I'm gettin' closer to you.
Been on the road for fourteen days,
And I ain't got a shirt to show.
The heat is pounding down on my back,
What a heavy load I tow.
Desperation roll me,
I'm rollin' over to you.
Desperation roll me,
I'm gettin' closer to you.
Desperation roll me,
I'm rollin' over to you.
Desperation roll me,
I'm gettin' closer to you.
Hey, hey, hey, all right.
