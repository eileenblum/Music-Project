Get ready, stand steady,
We're gonna shoot you full of Rock 'n Roll.
You're goin' crazy, don't be lazy,
Ah, the boys are losin' control.
You're an angel with a broken wing,
You're an angel who was born to, born to swing.
Oooh yeah, I feel like a dog in heat.
Oooh yeah, I got a fire burning under my feet.
Get ready, stand steady,
The boys are on the run tonight.
The next town we'll be getting down,
We're gonna rock 'till broad daylight.
You're an angel with a broken wing.
You're a angel who was born to, born to swing.
Oooh yeah, I feel like a dog in heat.
Oooh yeah, I got a guitar burning under my feet.
Get ready, stand steady,
We're gonna shoot you full of Rock 'n Roll.
You're goin' crazy, don't be lazy,
Ah, the boys are losin' control.
You're an angel with a broken wing.
You're a angel who was born to, born to swing.
Oooh yeah, I feel like a dog in heat.
Oooh yeah, I got a fire burning under my feet.
Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready...
