Get your motor runnin',
Head out on the highway.
We're lookin' for adventure,
Or whatever comes our way.
I know we're gonna make it happen,
Meet the world in a love embrace.
Fire all of the guns at once,
And explode into space.
I like smoky lightning,
Heavy metal thunder.
Got my hands on the wheel,
Lord, I like that I'm under.
I know we're gonna make it happen,
in a love embrace
Fire all of the guns at once,
And explode into space.
Like a true nature's child,
We were born be wild.
fly so high
never gonna die
Born to be wild.
Born to be wild.
I was born to be...
Heavy metal thunder...
Get your motor running,
Head out on the highway.
Now, we're lookin' for adventure,
Or whatever comes our way.
I know we're gonna make it happen,
the world in a love embrace
Fire all of the guns at once,
And explode into space
Like a true natures child,
to be wild
fly so high
never gonna die.
Born to be wild.
Born to be wild.
Oooh yeah.
