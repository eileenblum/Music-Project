Oh come on,
She got everything,
That she always dreamed of.
She'll have everything,
That she'll ever need.
But the one thing that she never got a taste of,
Was to get down in between.
She's hot for love,
She's ready to roll it over.
She's hot for love,
Got no time to think it over.
Well get down on this bitch.
Well, she was locked behind a bedroom door,
A prisoner of lock and key.
With dreams, of midnight lovers,
Comin' to set her, free.
She's hot for love,
She's ready to roll it over.
She's hot for love,
Got no time to think it over.
She's hot for
She's ready
She's hot
Got no time
Now she's loose, gonna turn on the juice.
So brother you best beware.
Ooh, long hair and a stare
She's gonna get you,
when you're unaware.
She's hot for love,
She's ready to roll it over.
She's hot for love,
Got no time to
