So you think you been workin' hard,
Givin' it all that you can,
And nothin' seems to make it better,
You're gonna scratch it for a whole new plan.
Street life, it ain't right,
When you feel you've grown apart.
You've gotta scratch and bite,
And punch and fight.
Take my hand, I'll lead through the night.
It's there, it's all there for the taking.
It's there, and it's waiting for you for the making.
Now your lastin', from day to day,
Well you're waitin' for the world to change.
You're just goin' through all of the motions,
While you're caught up on a mystery train.
No luck, ain't that tough,
You see it's all just a part of the game.
You gotta scratch and bite,
And punch and fight,
Just to be a part of what shall remain.
It's there, it's all there for the taking.
It's there, and it's waiting for you for the making.
Just waiting for the taking.
So you think you been workin' hard,
Givin' it all that you can,
And nothin' seems to make it better,
You're gonna scratch it for a whole new plan.
Street life, it ain't right,
When you feel that you've grown apart.
You've gotta scratch and bite,
And punch and fight.
Take my hand, I'll lead through the night.
It's there, it's all there for the taking.
It's there, and it's waiting for you, for the making.
Oh yeah.
Waiting for you, it's waiting for me, it's waiting for all man.
Oh yeah.
You gotta scratch and bite,
You gotta punch and fight.
Waiting, waiting for the taking,
waiting for the taking, waiting for the taking...
