Flashing lights above my head,
It's all that I can see.
Crashing clouds of smoke appear,
Sayin' come on, follow me.
Here we come again,
Ready to lose control.
The battle has begun,
The planes are ready to roll.
Fire's blazing,
All hell's broke loose.
Flaming swords,
From an electric noose.
Flying tigers above me appear,
Fly me away.
Get me outta here.
On and on and on,
We sing our battle cry.
We'll leave the cities far behind,
And that'll be (?).
Here we come again,
Ready to lose control.
The battle has just begun,
The planes are ready to roll.
Fires blazing,
All hell's breaking loose.
Flaming swords,
From an electric noose.
Flying tigers above me appear,
Get me outta here.
Get me outta here.
Here we come again,
Ready to lose control.
The battle has begun,
The planes are ready to roll.
Well, here we come again,
Ready to lose control.
The battle has begun,
The planes are ready to roll.
Here we come again.
Here we come again.
Here we come again.
Here we come again.
Here we, here we come again.
Here we, here we come again.
Here we, here we come again.
Detroit.
Here we, here we come again.
New York, and Chicago.
Here we, here we come again.
Tokyo.
