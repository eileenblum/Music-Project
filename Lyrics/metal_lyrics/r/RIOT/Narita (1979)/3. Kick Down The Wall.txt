The boys down at Johnny D's,
They're lookin' for love to tend.
Music and language tapes,
They're getting down at the Bitter End.
Hot nights and bright lights,
Some gettin' rolled by the bar.
Comin' downtown, shake down.
Yeah, we're gonna know who you are.
Kick down the wall.
Kick it on down.
We'll keep the music playin',
Kick it on down.
Kick down the wall.
Kick it on down.
We'll keep the music playin',
Kick it on down.
You like diamonds and rubies,
You love crystal and pearls.
And Momma likes sandy beaches,
Daddy likes school-age girls.
I'm reachin' out for you,
Come on, reach out for me.
Kick down the walls now honey,
I'm gonna show you how sweet love can be.
Kick down the wall.
Kick it on down.
Keep the music playin',
Kick it on down.
Kick down the wall,
Kick it on down.
Keep the music playin',
Kick it on down.
Kick down the wall.
Kick it on down.
Keep the music playin',
Kick it on down.
Kick down the wall.
Kick it on down.
We'll keep the music playin',
Kick it on down.
Kick down the wall.
Kick it on down.
Keep the music playin',
Kick it on down.
Kick down the walls.
Kick it on down.
I'll keep the music playin',
Kick it on down.
Kick down the wall.
Kick it on down.
Keep the music playin',
Kick it on down...
