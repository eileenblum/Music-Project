Rolling thunder, feel my fears come alive
Stop and wonder, how many people must die ?
I've gone away, far away, to this misery
Help me, someone set me free

Run hide
coming after me
Run hide
On to Albany

Hungry army, brothers Iroquois
Lonely party, fighting down in Troy
Long ago, so far away
Driving westward shores
Help me, someone hear me say

Run hide
coming after me
Run hide
On to Albany
Run hide
Coming after me
Run hide
Killers all I see
