Brave and strong
Born of the lords
The eagle sees so far as he scars
The roots have spread out
The tree of great peace
The seeds of war grow strong in the east

They shot one by one

Brotherhood
Show your sign
The long house
Brotherhood
Sound your call
The long house

Many stand proud,
Five nations and one
Blinded eyes they cry to the sun
Fallen and weak
Many will die
Hold my land and pray to the sky

They shot one by one

Brotherhood
Show your sign
The long house
Brotherhood
Sound your call
The long house
