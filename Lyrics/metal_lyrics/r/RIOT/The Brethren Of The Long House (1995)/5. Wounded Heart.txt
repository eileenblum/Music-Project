Yes my father
I'll take your command
So my brother
I'll ride through you hand
All I feel is the painm in my heart, it won't let me
be
Save my people from all that you start
Drive them to the sea

Wounded Heart
Sail away on the ocean
Take my hand together we'll fly
from this land
Wounded heart
Spread your wings on the ocean rest your head
For alderman, now you are dead

Run
Our villages burned and destroyed
Runs...resistance
Will soon be employed
Take my mark on the mountain of hope
Now I've com to lead
Blood and vengeance is all that I know
Brothers follow me
Now my people they bargain my soul
And turn their eyes away
They lost freedom that once made us whole
Now I hear them say

Wounded Heart
Sail away on the ocean
Take my hand together we'll fly
from this land
Wounded heart
Spread your wings on the ocean rest your head
For Alderman, now you are dead
