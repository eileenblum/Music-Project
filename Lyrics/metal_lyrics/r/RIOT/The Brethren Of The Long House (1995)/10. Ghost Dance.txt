Watching through the dead of the night
Think I have one in my sight
I'm torn in many ways
Being far from where I'm known
I'm alone

Crossing over one by one
I am just a ghost to some
Feel my spirit start to soar
One more hour and I'll be sure

Someone see me
Someone hear me
Someone bring me, back from where I go
Someone help me
Someone touch me
Someone tell me has my death begun?

Surely soon I will discover
If I hear my fallen brother
Things have got to change
Life it cannot end this way
So I pray

Turn me loose on rock or stone
From this battlefield I'm thrown
Darkened visions start to grow
One more hour then I'll know

Someone see me
Someone hear me
Someone bring me, back from where I go
Someone help me
Someone touch me
Someone tell me has my death begun?
