It's too late, my body's growin tired
To many of my brothers fall and die
I can't wait, soon I will be gone
Running from the land where I belong

Rain, falling on my shoulders
Rain, from the sky
Rain, I see tear drops falling down
Rain, where I die

I push on, my people on the run
How can I stand and fight against a gun
It's no use, this war is all I see
How can a man come on a land that's free ?

Rain, falling on my shoulders
Rain, from the sky
Rain, I see tear drops falling down
Rain, where I die

They're coming from another to turn me away
I'll stand up with my brother
I'll fight another day
Finished with your promisse
Finished with your lies
This land we won't surrender till every red man dies

Rain, falling on my shoulders
Rain, from the sky
Rain, I see tear drops falling down
Rain, where I die

You know it's gonny keep on running
Let it rain
It's gonna rain down, let it rain where I die
keep on coming tear drops coming down
