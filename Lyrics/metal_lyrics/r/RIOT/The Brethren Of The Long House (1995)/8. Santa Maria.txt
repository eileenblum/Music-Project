There are ships upon the ocean
Through the morning mist and cold
Ride the wind to the new world
Lion hearts they sail so bold
In a vision I have seen this
Such a dream I can't ignore
What becomes of our children
When they reach the secred shore ?

Santa Maria
The world awaits your destiny
Santa Maria
Say a prayer for me

A man of faith, he is driven
Passions burning deep inside
Hope and courage dwell within him
As he watched the midnight sky
There are some who will forsake him
There are those who wonder why
Though many people will embrace him
We remember and we cry

Santa Maria
The world awaits your destiny
Santa Maria
Say a prayer for me
