The rooms were so much colder then my father was a soldier then  and times were very hard when I was young
I smoked my first cigarette at ten and the girls I had a bad yen and I had quite a ball when I was young
When I was young it was more important paid more pain but the laughter much louder yeah when I was young
Met my first love at thirteen she was brown and I was pretty green I learned quite a lot when I was young
The rooms were so much colder my father was a soldier then  and times were very hard when I was young
When I was young it was more important paid more pain but the laughter much louder yeah when I was young
When I was young it was more important paid more pain but the laughter much louder yeah when I was young
My faith was so much stronger then I believed in fellow men and I was so much older then when I was young 
When I was young when I was young oh oh when I was young ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh yeah
