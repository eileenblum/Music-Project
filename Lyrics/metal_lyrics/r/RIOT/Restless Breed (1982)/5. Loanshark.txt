Cold blood eyes that are black as the night wounded as soon as I smell blood I strike
Drag you to drama if you don't pay back don't look so innocent could be attacked attacked
Hiding in shadows cast by the moon mobsters are waiting inside the saloon
I'm a loanshark collecting payments overdue I'm a loanshark does your mother know I'm after you
I'm a loanshark down on your knees for the truth I'm a loanshark I'll squeeze what I want from you
I'm a loanshark collecting payments overdue yeah
Many a man are in debt to me wound up as concrete dumped into the sea
You can't hide I have spies all over the own don't laugh 'cause this man ain't foolin' around no way
Hiding in shadows cast by the moon mobsters are waiting inside the saloon
I'm a loanshark collecting payments overdue I'm a loanshark does your mother know I'm after you
I'm a loanshark down on your knees for the truth I'm a loanshark I'll squeeze what I want from you
I'm a loanshark collecting payments overdue 
Hey hey that's right boy you better come up with that greenback dollar
Yeah you know what I'm talkin' about baby oh yeah
I'm a loanshark collecting payments overdue yeah I'm a loanshark does your mother know I'm after you
I'm a loanshark down on your knees for the truth I'm a loanshark I'll squeeze what I want from you
I'm a loanshark collecting payments overdue loanshark
