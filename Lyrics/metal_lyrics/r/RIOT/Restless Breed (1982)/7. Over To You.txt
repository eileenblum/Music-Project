I can see you 'cross endless miles I can see your distant smile hangin' over 
I'm a rover living all over if you follow give it time think it over roll it over
And it's only a matter of time it's only a matter of time before I turn it
Only a matter of time only a matter of time before I turn it
Over to you over to you babe over to you yeah oh over to you yeah ah
I'm a soldier living by the rules standin' in shadows and tryin' to be so cool silly fool
I'm a sailor I cross the seven seas change directions with every passing breeze shoot the breeze
And it's only a matter of time it's only a matter of time before I turn it
Only a matter of time only a matter of time before I turn it ooh
Over to you girl turn it over to you ooh over to you hey yeah oh over to you 
And it's only a matter of time it's only a matter of time before I turn it
Only a matter of time only a matter of time before I turn it 
Over to you girl over to you babe over to you ooh over to you 
Over and over I'm gonna turn it to you hey turn it over ooh yeah yeah 
I'm all right over and over over to you over and over and over and over
