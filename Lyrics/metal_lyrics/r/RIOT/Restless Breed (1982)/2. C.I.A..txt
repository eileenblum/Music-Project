You won't believe what I'm after I play this game for keeps uh
Amidst of blood and disaster I'll drop you down on your knees
I fight for so called religion the right to say as you please
If they should hold me for ransom honey destroy my tapes as you leave
I got a licence to murder the perpetrators must die
I work for united countries don't even ask me why 
I don't have much to regret baby you see me on the tv
The politicians I protect they're filled with hate and disease
We're fighting in the streets so you can feel at ease yeah
We're fighting for our lives we all must sure survive I'm in the C.I.A. he he hey
I stand around like a stallion you know I think I'm too cool
There's lots of money and action as long as I don't get fooled
There's really no room for mistakes quick and grow what you're after 
My venom sprays from my magnum try to escape and you're shot
I signed a contract with satan so I don't worry at all
And if you want some excitements hey just leave your number I'll call
All my spents are expensive honey they put it on my account
I fight my way out of trouble in god we trust is my clout
We're fighting in the streets so you can feel at ease
We're fighting for our lives we all must sure survive I'm in the C.I.A. he he hey
And I'll blow your face away ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah he hey
Yeah you're gonna buy this one baby 
We're fighting in the streets so you can feel at ease
We're fighting for our lives we all must sure survive 
I'm in the C.I.A. C.I.A. C.I.A. ha ha ha
