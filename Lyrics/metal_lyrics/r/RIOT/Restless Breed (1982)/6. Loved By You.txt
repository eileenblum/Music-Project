There I was talkin' 'bout you out on the street it won't be long before we finally meet
I played my cards and now my hand was alright and now I'm searchin' but I don't see the light
We had some action but it split at the seems the situation had me weak in the knees
Now you look for me to hold you near I still need you so dry your tears
I only wanted to be loved by you ooh ah loved by you you loved by you whoa loved by you
You gave me feeling all around in my brain now don't you stop I've got to feel it again
Your door is open and I come inside my mind is achin' and my body's afire
There was a time you acted so refined there was a time when you would blow my mind
And now I'm lookin' at they way you changed here we are playin' the same old game
I only wanted to be loved by you oh loved by you ooh loved by you you loved by you yeah yeah oh
Oh oh oh you know what daddy likes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh yeah oh aaaah
There was a time you acted so refined there was a time when you would blow my mind
And now I'm lookin' at they way you changed here we are playin' the same old game
I only wanted to be loved by you oh loved by you you loved by you baby you loved by you oh
Loved by you baby loved by you you loved by you eh hey loved by you tell me
