Mm mm mm mm when the sun goes down in this border town and a fear sets in and gets higher
And down in the streets in the desert heat ride seven men with their hearts afire
They ride through the town and it burns to the ground
Hell bent on vengeance hate and greed 'cause they're the restless breed 
This outlaw attack that strikes from the back is just the revenge that they need
'cause their brothers they fell at a bar called the wishing well now this town will surely bleed
They ride through the town and it burns to the ground
Hell bent on vengeance hate and greed 'cause they're the restless breed 
They'll take what they want and give it to the restless breed 
Hold on to your life they'll take it to the restless breed
Don't put up a fight they're gonna bring you to your knees 'cause they're the restless breed ooh
Morning sets in there's nothing left that's been untouched by the raging storm yeah yeah
And when the smoke it clears the women shed their tears because they know they'll be back for more
They ride through the town and it burns to the ground
Hell bent on vengeance hate and greed 'cause they're the restless breed 
They'll take what they want and give it to the restless breed 
Hold on to your life they'll take it to the restless breed
They'll take what they want and give it to the restless breed 
Don't put up a fight they're gonna take you to your knees 'cause they're the restless breed ooh ooh
