Girl I've known you for a long time so many times you made me out the fool
They say love is blind babe I'm too blind to see and now it's a showdown between you and me.
Showdown I can't take it anymore showdown now I'm walking out the door
I've done my time now I've got better things to do now it's a showdown between me and you yeah
Now you've got me spinnin' round and round I can't tell which way I'm turning
I've been the fool and you've been so cruel now it's a showdown between me and you
Showdown I can't take it anymore showdown now I'm walking out the door
I've done my time now I've got better things to do now it's a showdown between me and you 
Showdown I can't take it anymore showdown now I'm walking out the door
I've done my time now I've got better things to do now it's a showdown between me and you 
Goodbye goodbye goodbye baby showdown I've got better things to do showdown I found a woman
Showdown I found a woman to be true and now I'm walkin' out the door
Showdown now I'm walkin' out the door showdown goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye baby
Showdown got a woman I got a woman who's true showdown
