You have to bea lasting memory of a thousand different dreams
I traveled over a golden rainbow is there more I have to see
Searched so long walked country miles yet to find what I may need
Here I sit so patiently will I ever find my lady
Ooh ooh ooh just a dream away yeah just a dream away 
Whoa oh just a dream just a dream away
Have all my boyhood memories locked inside my dreams
Never knew it could be so hard but is this what Ireally need
Here I'm standin' at the station with a raincoat in my hand
Searchin' for lonely girls headin' out to distant lands
Ooh ooh ooh just a dream away ooh ooh ooh just a dream away yeah
It's just a dream away whoa oh just a dream just a dream away
Ooh ooh ooh just a dream away ooh ooh ooh just a dream away yeah hey
It's just a dream away whoa oh just a dream just a dream away
Yeah it's just a dream just a dream away a dream dream dream away
Hey dream it's just a dream away oh dream just a dream away
It's just a dream it's just a dream away ooh dream it's just a dream away
