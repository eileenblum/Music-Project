Victims of mass confusion victims of the night payment and restitution never see the light
He lived a life of persecution he lived a life of violent violent violent crimes yeah
Master of self destruction he wanted to end his life the problems that stood before him too heavy for his stride
He lived a life of persecution he lived a life of violent violent violent crimes yeah
It's kill or be killed baby huh huh and I'm a city slicker
He lived a life of persecution he lived a life of violent violent violent crimes yeah
The powers of mass destruction evil in the night obsessed with the illusion he takes another life
Victims of mass confusion victims of the night payment and restitution never see the light
He lived a life of persecution he lived a life of violent crimes 
He lived a life of persecution he lived a life of violent violent violent crimes 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
