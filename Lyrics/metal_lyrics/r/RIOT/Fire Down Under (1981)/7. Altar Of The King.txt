On the night,
Through the fire and the light.
I hold my sword up,
Lightning, it strikes out.
Reach for the light,
Fight for my life.
A mystery 'till we meet,
The fountain of the king.
To the altar of the king.
To the altar of the king.
To the altar of the king.
Evenings burning skies,
Reflects upon my eyes.
Out in the distance,
Utopia, resistance.
The power and the glory,
Through wild woods calling.
Evil is flowing,
Its own justice, to the fight.
At the altar of the king.
To the altar of the king.
The altar of the king.
Ohhh, ohhh.
faster and faster
To the altar of the king.
To the altar of the king.
To the altar of the king.
To the altar of the king.
I'm so near her,
Sight's so clearer.
Riding faster, riding faster.
Evil is calling me, yeah.
