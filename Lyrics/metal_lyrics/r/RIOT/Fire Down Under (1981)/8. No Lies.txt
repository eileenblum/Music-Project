I'm feeling, just feeling,
Seems like it's all inside.
No meaning, no grieving.
Just the way that I can't hide.
I'm praying, she's saying,
No reason for me to disguise.
Love's waiting, and I'm taking,
So sorry, I tell no lies.
No lies.
Tell me no more lies.
No, no, no.
No lies.
Tell me no more lies.
Still trying, was crying,
Can you see, without open eyes?
Love's going down, to a place,
Where we can break our ties.
I'm praying, she's saying,
No reason for me to disguise.
Love's waiting, but I'm taking.
So sorry, I tell no lies.
No lies,
Tell me no more lies.
No lies,
Tell me no more lies.
No lies.
Tell me no more lies.
No lies.
No, no, no.
Tell me no more lies.
No more lies.
