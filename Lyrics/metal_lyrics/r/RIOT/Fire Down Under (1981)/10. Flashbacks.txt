[Instrumental-Mostly]

"Are you ready to rock 'n roll?,
get off your feet, off your feet, Born To Be Wild"
"San Antonio, San Antone..."
"London, it's been two years,
and a very hard struggle,
to bring a band to Hammersmith,
are you ready to get down?,
a good one, please welcome for the first time,
our guests from New York City: RIOT"
"RIOT is on it's first visit to the
Bundes-Republik Of Germany, and as I understand it,
from talking with record company people,
the band is having to deal with a conflict of
image"
