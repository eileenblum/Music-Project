Just a stranger passing thru town
Long fays ago, i feel so alone
BUldings around stand tall and gray
Staring down as if i'm their prey
In a rush of my mind i remember yesterday

[Chorus 1]
Misty morning rain
It blows in your eyes
You can't feel the pain
Misty morning rain
It blows in your eyes
You won't feel the pain
Misty morning rain

All the pleasure, all the pain
Dreams of you is what keeps me sane
Every morning by the river walk
Into the night as we let them talk
All my yesterdays is what keeps me holding on

[Chorus 2]
Misty morning rain
Dreams of you
What keeps me sane
Misty morning rain
It blows in your eyes
You can't feel the pain
Misty morning rain

[Chorus 3]
Misty morning rain
It blows in your eyes
You can't feel the pain
Misty morning rain
Dreams of you
What keeps me sane
Misty morning rain
It blows in your eyes
You can't feel the pain
Misty morning rain
