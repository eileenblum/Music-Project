Say good bye to your true love
One step further from me
I can't decide which way to take it
Stand alone and don't look back
Music is coming 'round the past
Take it, we'll all twist again
Once you find it, stay close behind it
You're still waiting, this time for me
Once we're playing, now we're praying

[Chorus:]
One step closer
One step closer
One step closer

Live fast, don't you talk trash
Someone's waiting right on your ass
Take it, this time we're gonna make it
Roaming round this time around
I guess you all know what's coming down
Take it
Once you find it, stay close behind it
You're still waiting, this time for me
Once we're playing, now we're praying

[Chorus:]
One step closer
One step closer
One step closer
