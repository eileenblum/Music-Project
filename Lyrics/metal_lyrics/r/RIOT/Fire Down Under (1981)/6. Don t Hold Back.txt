Tell me all your dreams,
How you want your love to grow.
We'll sail across the ocean,
There's so little that we know.
City streets,
So full of people, talkin' aimlessly.
Gotta climb above it all,
To a rainbow you can see, yeah.
Don't hold back,
There ain't no place to hide.
Don't hold back,
There's a place, right by my side.
Don't hold back,
There ain't no place to hide.
Let me be the crystal ship,
To a diamond sky of love.
Don't hold back.
From a corner of the sky above,
We'll watch the days go by.
People going nowhere fast,
Puts light, in a weary eye.
I'll love you baby,
Give you all the love I've got.
Keep you cool from the sun,
Dry from the rain,
If you're cold, I'll make you hot.
Don't hold back,
There ain't no place to hide.
Don't hold back,
There's a place right by my side.
Don't hold back,
There ain't no place to hide.
Anytime you see,
The one you really need.
Go on find the time,
Go on, let it shine.
Don't you remember?
Tell me all your dreams,
How you want your love to grow.
We'll sail across the ocean,
There's so little that we know.
Don't hold back,
There ain't no place to hide.
Don't hold back,
There's a place, right by my side.
Don't hold back,
There ain't no place to hide.
Let me be a crystal ship,
To a diamond sky of love.
Don't hold back.
