Somewhere she's waving at me
At the corner of the bar
But i find the distance too far
To have me get up and see
Could it be due to my smile
Maybe i'll just hang out awhile

[Chorus]
You're all i need tonight
Come on save it for tonight
You're all i need tonight

What you saying ?
Is the music up to high ?
Why don't you come come a little closer ?
Put my finger on your surprise
Your someone's ordinary dream
Just a dish of pure delight
Now if i can't hold my ground
Have someone bring my car around

[Chorus]
You're all i need tonight
Come on save it for tonight
You're all i need tonight

[Chorus]
You're all i need tonight
Come on save it for tonight
You're all i need tonight
