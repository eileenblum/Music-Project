All alone, sitting inside now,
Are you waiting for me?
I'm feeling just a little bit slower,
Than I usually seem.
If I'm gonna take some chances,
Will you still remember me?
And in the end, from the haunted dreams,
You might find, what you really need.
You find what you need.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
When you reach the forest,
Which way, does the wind blow the trees?
Does the wheel inside you,
Turn like the wheel in me?
I can't give you no answers,
To the questions, that you've got.
I feel that things been missing,
And this time I gotta take the shot.
I'm gonna take the shot.
Feel the same,
Baby does it feel the same to you?
Feel the same,
It ain't easy when it happens to you.
Feel the same,
You don't know what I'm going through.
Feel the same,
It ain't easy when it happens, to you.
No, no, yeah.
Ohh here we go...
Feel the same,
Oh, baby does it feel the same to you?
Feel the same,
It ain't easy, when it happens to you.
Feel the same,
You don't know what I'm going through.
Feel the same,
Lord, it ain't easy when it happens, to you.
It ain't easy.
Feel the same,
Baby, does it feel the same to you?
Feel the same,
I gotta know, does it feel the same?
Feel the same,
You don't know.
Feel the same,
Tokyo Rose, she knows!
Feel the same,
Tell me how it feels.
Feel the same...
