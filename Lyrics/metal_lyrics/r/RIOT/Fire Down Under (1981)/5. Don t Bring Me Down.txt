You took my money, baby, you steal my cigarettes.
First chance I get, I'll be up and jet, I'm gone.
You beat me up, you threw me out,
You killed my dog and cat.
The "Ken-L-Ration" is yours,
I want the "Friskies" back.
Ooooh, don't bring me down.
Ooooh, don't bring me down.
No, no.
You took my car, for just one night,
Out to cruise the scene, that's what you told me.
Now the engine's gone, the tailpipe's bent,
My 8-Track's playin', Spring-st-st-steen.
You call me a wimp, you say I'm a chump,
Well your face is bent,
And you smell like gorilla dump.
Ooooh, don't bring me down.
Ooooh, don't bring me down.
No, no, no.
Hear what I said, hear what I said now?
Ooooh, don't, don't, don't,
Ooooh, don't bring me down.
No, no.
Ooooh, don't ya bring me down.
Ooooh, don't ya bring me down.
Ooooh, don't ya bring me down.
No, no, no.
