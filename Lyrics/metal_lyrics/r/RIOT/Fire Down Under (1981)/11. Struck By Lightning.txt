She had some strange ideas about living
Just wasn't part of the game
She had some loving she knew she couldn't part with
Boys would never be the same

My innocent lady, she had the guts
Put it all an me from the start
Kisses they burned like fire
Found an easy way to my heart

[Chorus]
Struck by Lightning
Love is alive, i feel it tonight
Struck by Lightning
Your magic touch makes me seem so

I told her ...
gimme a call, drop me a line
Gotta see you again
So day into night and night into day
A sad way thru my fall to train
My innocent lady, she had the guts
Put it all an me from the start
Kisses they burned like fire
Found an easy way to my heart

[Chorus]
Struck by Lightning
Love is alive, i feel it tonight
Struck by Lightning
Your magic touch makes me seem so

Struck by Lightning
Love is alive, i feel it tonight
Struck by Lightning
Your magic touch makes me seem so
