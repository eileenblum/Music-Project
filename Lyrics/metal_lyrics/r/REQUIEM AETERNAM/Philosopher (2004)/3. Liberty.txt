All power comes from God
All weakness comes from God
All knowledge comes from God
All ignorance comes from God

Say goodbye to being free
Love slavery, truthful Christian
Quit your Liberty

All joy comes from God
All suffering comes from God
All good comes from God
All evil comes from God

Move away from the destiny
Trusting his word, he'll be a martyr
Quit your Liberty

Describe the time
Your final rhyme
Bleeding the insane
Eternally
Dying his pain

In the shadows
You will see
Without creed, without deed
Your Liberty

All weakness comes from God
All ignorance comes from God
All suffering comes from God
All evil comes from God

Describe the time
Your final rhyme
Bleeding the insane
Eternally
Dying his pain

[Based on Rousseau's books: The Social Contract &amp; The Confessions]
