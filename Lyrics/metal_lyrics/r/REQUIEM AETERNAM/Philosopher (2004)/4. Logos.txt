From discord is born the broadest unity
From confusion arises the widest serenity

War is the king of all
Trial is the crown of the Lord

Hide your folly
Show your darkness

The one that is always
The always who is by now
The now that is hiding
The hiding who is the one

Logos

Wisdom is common
Wisdom of bitterness
Wisdom is one
Wisdom of loneliness

The one is made up of everything
Everything issues from its completion

Fire will judge the appraisers
Fire will sentence even God

This world in vain
The sabre in pain
This bow of aim
The wound of claim
