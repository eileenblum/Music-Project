Everything is vanity
Phenomenal life
Order comes from chaos
Human being annihilation

Nonexistence is the existence without attributes
No qualities, no activity as far as meditation

Right view, right livelihood, right speech, right intention
Right action, right mindfulness, right effort, right concentration

Individual soul is an illusion
Separatism: root of all evil
Universe comes from nothing
Feelings arise from ignorance

Nonexistence is the existence without attributes
No qualities, no activity as far as meditation

[Chorus]

Renunciation of desires
Tale of everlasting day
The salvation of the anguish
Labyrinth of mortal clay
Aspiration, pronunciation
Truth and justice, all in vain
Desperation, desolation
Will be returned to the men

Illuminate me

[Chorus]
