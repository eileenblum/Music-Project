Alone
Trying to understand
Warrior
Silent
Writing with his blood
The destiny

Like a song without melody
Like a poem without a dream
Like a prayer without deity
He lives his world

Prisoner
Ignoring all complaints
Defiant
Confidant
Feeling only his truth
The loneliness

[Repeat verse 2]

Lick the snow
Drink the rain
Feed the soul
Kiss the pain
Scar your face
Hear your fate
Taste your sweat
Spit your hate

Walking the nights
Running the flames
Flying the hearts
Breaking the chains
Sing the sage
Untie the spy
Murder the rage
Open the sky
