All is uncertain even to the happy one
Action is what defeats reason
Everything is valid for the winner
Passions sharpen smartness

With your veins
In the skies
Seeing claims
Dancing lies
On the flames
Mortal flies

Fright can be seen in the face
Evil opposes another evil
Love extinguishes another love
Appearance is what hurts

In this land of dreamers
Time forgets reality
In this field of soldiers
Grief puts out sincerity
In this net of sinners
Wisdom shows the tyranny

Virtue doesn't fear abundance
Justice doesn't suffer from injustice
Kismet goes ahead without compassion
It's necessary to learn to die

[Based on selected essays by Seneca]
