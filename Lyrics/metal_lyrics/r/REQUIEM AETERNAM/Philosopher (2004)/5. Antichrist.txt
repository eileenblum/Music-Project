Man aspires to be the superman
Aspires to the ungovernable
He longs to be almost a nihilistic being

The past belongs to me tomorrow
There's someone who was born posthumously

I vomit the cross that destroys conscience
I deplore the one who lives on poverty

Man aspires to be the superman
Although they disapprove of him
Although they condemn him

The past belongs to me tomorrow
There's someone who was born posthumously

I vomit the cross that destroys conscience
I deplore the one who lives on poverty

The good God and the Devil are products of decadence

Convictions imprison you
Compassion dies on you
Forget the prodigy
Forsake the humility
Forage the identity

Man aspires to be the superman

Malefactor hope; weak spirit
Passive intelligence; dark dependence

I vomit the cross that destroys conscience
I deplore the one who lives on poverty

The good God and the Devil are products of decadence

[Chorus]

Foresee the infamy

[Based on Nietzsche's books: The Antichrist &amp; Thus Spoke Zarathustra]
