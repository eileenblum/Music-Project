Immortal worm: Inextinguishable fire
Destructive willpower: Accumulation of being
Abominable emptiness: Inexplicable panic

Temporary and eternal
Freedom and necessity

Desperation

Dare to be an individual
Dare to be entirely yourself
Isolated before God
He pretends to get rid of himself

To fall slowly
To fall without being able

To die eternally
To die the death
To live eternally
To live the death

Desperation, the worst of miseries
Desperation of not being able to live
Desperation, the truth is a lie
Desperation of not being able to die

Recitation

Fear of an external eventuality
Fear of something unknown
His religion laughs at his disgrace
Something that doesn't dare to know

[Repeat verses 5 &amp; 6]

To die without life
To die the death
To live without life
To live the death

[Based on the book by Kierkegaard: Treaty of the Desperation]
[Recitation: Verses 1 &amp; 5 of "Madness" (Forbidden Writings by Romero Sum)]
