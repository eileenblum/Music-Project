Because your mind was trapped by your world
Maybe that is because of your fear
I don't want to believe the crying few people will understand

I've never heard my furious heart beating
Start without hope like the infamous deception
Oligarchical present that has passed without future

I know life may have taken you to your truth
Relative and fade hypocrisy

[Chorus:]
Come Back
You don't have too much time

But I feel stronger although you may have forgotten
About those few nights
But sad at the same time, for cannot know

I know life may have taken you to your truth
Relative and fade hypocrisy
