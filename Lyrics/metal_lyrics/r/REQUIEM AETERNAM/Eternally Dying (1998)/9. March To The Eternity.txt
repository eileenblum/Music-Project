Melodies and feelings describe your march
Fire and ice get used to your way

There is hidden music in the night
Sweet melodies enchant my senses
Eternity, you are the one who catches me
Divine death, you are the one who bewitches me

The earth of dust, water on earth
The sky on water, universal creation

You're the sacred that I watched under the stars
Immaterial, abstract present
The breeze of your funerals
Drags ways? That no longer, not even existed

A dark angel nails his spade on your shiny sand
His black horse doesn't respect the prayers
They come to you in an exquisite way
Without being afraid of nature

There is hidden music in the night
Sweet melodies enchant my senses
Eternity, you are the one who catches me
Divine death, you are the one who bewitches me
