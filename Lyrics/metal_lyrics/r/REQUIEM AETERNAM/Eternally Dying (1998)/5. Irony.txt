Soul, contemplate them! They inspire on legends
Almost ridiculous
Sinister mannequins, vain, somnambulist
Of the night

Their eyes, treasure of pain
Immaterial pride
Looking the sky all the time, like a vile mortal
Who does not understand life

Soul, illustrate them! They inspire on fantasies
Almost miserable
Cerebral distortion and ambitious end
That's coming

They place across the unlimited
Brothers of the silence and tranquillity
In this winter I feel my soul cover the idol
In a furious obscurity
Eternal God of the cold forest
Health and immortality!

You trample the dead that once was your puppet
Chaos is the most wanted of your jewels and crimes
You trample the angel that once was your slave
Treason is the most hated thing of your rules

Dictators of lies that know your truth
Laughing at your story badly narrated
Comedy actors that ornated your future
Clowns of tragedy that attend your present
