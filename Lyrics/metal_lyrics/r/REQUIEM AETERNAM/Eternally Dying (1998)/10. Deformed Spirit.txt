Deformed spirit that cherishes my cries
Indefinable way of explaining my sense
The invisible pain which pushes to the stage
The reason that fights against the fire which burns me

[Chorus:]
Livin' in my mind
Deformed spirit
Livin' in my brain
Deformed spirit

Illusion from the hell that swaddles my look
The terror of the failure that grows in the present
Maybe you'll never understand what this prayer means
Of a nonexistent hymn written by my soul

Fade poet that inspires in my memory
Banished musicians socialising an image
Painter that doesn't understand himself while painting
Confused love which has no answer

Urban diffuse fantasy, manufacturing and almost tired
The vane and capricious positions that uses you
The eyes of silence find what is ours
Maybe platonic, although it's always quiet
