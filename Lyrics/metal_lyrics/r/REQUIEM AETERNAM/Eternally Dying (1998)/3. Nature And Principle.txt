Living is all psychic act
The nothingness reveals anguish
Death is the real character of existing
Essence apprehension

The phenomenon describes the essence
Of false conscience
The philosopher tries to know
All the essences

Reality is a vital impulse
Intuition tries to get life from inside
'Time is irreversible and each moment is irreplaceable'
'Religion is wanting to know about God and the soul'

[Chorus:]
Nature, life, desire, reality
Principle, death, anguish, destiny

Life is unlimited continuity
Where the anguish breathes
Death is just a living point
Where my destiny converges to

The phenomenon describes the essence
Of false conscience
The philosopher tries to know
All the essences

Reality is a vital impulse
Intuition tries to get life from inside
'Time is irreversible and each moment is irreplaceable'
'Religion is wanting to know about God and the soul'
