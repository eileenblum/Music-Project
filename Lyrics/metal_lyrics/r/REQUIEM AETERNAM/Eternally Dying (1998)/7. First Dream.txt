Fear of losing the reason
Insecurity takes possession of the matter
Shadows of the past attempt against his soul
Symbolic condensation of a desire

Hysteria, anguish, depression - this is the irony
Psychosis, fright, tiredness - this is my misery

First inextinguishable impressions of the infancy
Life's course is determined from the beginning of the fantasy

First dream

Experience, psychic conflict and trauma
Oniric interpretation of an only episode
Eternal malediction of the unreachable

[Chorus:]
Unfortunate stories
That I can't already change
Resistance to the discovery of his secrets
Dream excel imagination

Commotion for predestined causes
Testaments that involve intentions
Remorse without sense
Criminal illusion that doesn't rest

Shadows of the past attempt against his soul
Symbolic condensation of a desire
