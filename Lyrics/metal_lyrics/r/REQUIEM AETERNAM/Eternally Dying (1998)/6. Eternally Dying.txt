My ballad is as immense as sad
My song raves on my anguish

I feel you again, friend violin
Always near your brother, the violoncello

I love loneliness but I hate it
Silence liberates me but it imprisons me

I feel you again, bitter melody
Always near your loneliness

[Chorus:]
Eternally Dying
With a cruel but divine punishment
Eternally Dying
With an incomprehension that never speeds
