Lost in the unknown, in a full moon night
Where wolves' screams take possession of the silence

I'm inside an abysm
And there nothing is real except my pain
The ruins of civilisation show the Human cruelty
That couldn't prosper during the centuries
Killer empires from an evil
Turned into material
Penetrate in the image
Of an inexplicable dream

Lost in my own world, where the shadows
That draw my look, swaddle a desert view
Mystery of life is the big question that has no answer
Nature life more after the apocalypse

Eternal life for the ones who die
Eternal death for the ones who live

Vision of amorphous pictures, the sacred and the heathen
Cultures destroyed by others, that lie to cover their guilt
I die alone but I can't realise, I cry and I don't know why
I scream without hope, I'm Lost In the Unknown

Lost in the unknown, in a full moon night
Where wolves' screams take possession of the silence
Lost in my own world, where the shadows
That draw my look, swaddle a desert view
