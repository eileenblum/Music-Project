I will die again
I don't know my friend
Where is my life
I can't already cry

My pain, your pain
It's so real, tell me why

[Chorus:]
I never see faith in your eyes
But I see you free
I never see faith in your look
But I do see My Misery

Maybe because of your tears
I try to hide my fear
'Cause I want to feel
Something so unreal

My pain, your pain
It's so real, tell me why
