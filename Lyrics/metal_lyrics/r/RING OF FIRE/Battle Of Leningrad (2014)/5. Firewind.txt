Starts with a spark
That turns into a flame
You can put it out
But it comes back again
Always almost too late
Where the fire still burns
There's no love and no hate
Until justice returns
Now you got the feeling
That will never let you go
Wounded and not healing
Changing everything you know
Now it's time to take a chance
No time for turning back
I know all about the circumstances
It's not the end 'til somebody loses and wins
Here it comes once again

Fire wind
Fire wind
here it comes again
Fire wind

Now the sky is burning
And there's no place left to run
The wheel of fortune turning
What kind of future is to come
Now, I never thought that this could happen
I never thought that this could be
Walls of bayonets around me
To keep me company
Now it's time to take a chance
No time for turning back
I know all about the circumstances
It's not the end 'til somebody loses and wins
Here it comes once again

Fire wind
Fire wind
here it comes again
Fire wind
