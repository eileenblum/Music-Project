The army still surrounds
Suffocating weapons pounds
900 days and nights
We'll never give in
Everyday we'll rise again
In freezing cold and endless night
We will survive
We will survive

Losing homes and families
Hear the children cry
Nowhere safe and warm to hide
And they wonder why
Cut down debris from buildings
Burn it to keep us warm
Better if we were never born

Angels in heaven are tolling the bell
The battle of Leningrad
One million starving souls
Are dying in hell

Oh, oh, oh!
Leningrad!
Leningrad!

Angels in heaven are tolling the bell
The battle of Leningrad
One million starving souls
Are dying in hell

Oh, oh, oh!
Leningrad!
Leningrad!
