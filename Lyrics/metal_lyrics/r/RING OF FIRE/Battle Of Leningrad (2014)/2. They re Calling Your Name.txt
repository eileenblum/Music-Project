In the city from darkened windows
They look out on the night
Shaking from cold and fright
They're hanging on for their life
You don't remember and you don't care
Screaming voices
Ghosts out there
Crying, dying
Calling out your name

If anyone ever had a reason
If anyone had a right
Choices to live or die taken away

Take a number and get your share
Screaming voices
Ghosts out there
Crying, dying
Calling out your name

You don't remember and you don't care
Screaming voices
Ghosts out there
Take a number and get your share
Screaming voices
Ghosts out there
All in love, all in war's not fair
Screaming voices
Ghosts out there
Crying, dying
Calling out your name
