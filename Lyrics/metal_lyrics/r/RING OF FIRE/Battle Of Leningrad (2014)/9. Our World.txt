Here in the dark
With pain in my heart
So lost on my own now
This city is falling apart
It's our world, our world

Now everything's changed
And nothing's the same
I try to hold on
Hold on, hold on
'Til everything's gone

Soon it will end
So much to mend
The streets are deserted
Only spirits attend
This is our world, our world

Now everything's changed
And nothing's the same
I try to hold on
Hold on, hold on
'Til everything's gone
