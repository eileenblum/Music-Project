Empire!
Empire!

Territory and riches
Power and majesty
With heroic ambitions
Proclaiming many victories
Conquering every mountain
And spreading from sea to sea

Greater than any other
Throughout all history
A dying civilization
With dark treachery
Marching into battle
To bring the world to it's knees

Empire!
Empire!

No one cares for the people
No one cares for the lost
Another nation for conquest
Another land that once was
How will it last forever
When nothing ever does?

Empire!
Empire!

We're surrounded
By the empire
Buildings being pounded
By the empire
oh no!
Empire!
Empire!
