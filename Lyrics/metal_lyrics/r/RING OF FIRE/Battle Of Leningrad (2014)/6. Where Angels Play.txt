Lost in this prison of fear
Knowing that death is so near
We pray for tomorrow
And we try to pretend
Give us our daily bread
But only the lucky get fed
Nothing left for you and me

If I only had wings
I'd fly so far away
Where angels play
There to stay

The days just go on and on
And many are not for long
Still surrounded and we can't break free
How did this end up so bad
Remembering all that we had
Nothing left for you and me

If I only had wings
I'd fly so far away
Where angels play
There to stay

If I only had wings
I'd fly so far away
Away!!!

Where angels play
