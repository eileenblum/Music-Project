The snowfrakes go silently by
Outside my window
I am wondering why
Nothing changes
We try to survive
But I'm only waiting here
Waiting to die

Is this only a nightmare
Will I wake up to find
Skies that are clear
We're all lost here somewhere
In the land of frozen tears

Feeling empty and cold to the core
It's so impossible to just ignore
Every heart that is broken
Every moment
A lifetime of fear
Every word that is spoken
In the land of frozen tears

Every heart is still broken
Every moment
A lifetime of fear
We're all lost here somewhere
In the land of frozen tears
The end is always near
In the land of frozen tears
