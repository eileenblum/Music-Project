Glittering diamonds in a sky seen through the trees
Pieces to a puzzle of forgotten memoris
Starlight reflections in eyes that don't see
Dreaming of things that will never be

Close my eyes and see the window

Floating in the darkness like agents of the deep
So far beyond the believes that we keep

Close my eyes and see what they see

Rising from the ashes on the wings of fire
My heart keeps burning, feeding my desire

Rain
Is falling down on me again
And nothing will ever be the same
Te only thing left for me is pain
And you're the one to blame

Rain
Is falling down on me again
And nothing will ever be the same
Te only thing left for me is pain
And you're the one to blame
