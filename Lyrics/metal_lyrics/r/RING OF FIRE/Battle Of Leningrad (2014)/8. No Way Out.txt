It's not the first time
And it's not the last time
Year after year
Tear after tear
There is no reason
And there is no rhyme

So much confusion
Clouding your mind

Fighting a battle with no hesitation
So much frustration and no patience
It's so unclear
Why we are here
Going in circles and switching direction
Constantly facing rejection
Now there is no doubt
There's no way out

Won't need no bullets
Prisons or guards
When we are gone
They'll carry on
This game of waiting
Few will survive

So much confusion
Clouding your mind

Fighting a battle with no hesitation
So much frustration and no patience
It's so unclear
Why we are here
Going in circles and switching direction
Constantly facing rejection
