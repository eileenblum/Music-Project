Vladimir greater, and Yaroslav wiser
And Rurik's Varangian Guard
Ivan The Great, The Grand Duchy of Moscow
The Romanov Empire's start

Voices from the past
Never would surrender
I hear them calling
Mother Russia!
Mother Russia!

War with the Mongols, Germanic crusaders
the Swedes, and the Golden Horde
Tales of the Cossacks, like warrior pirates
Exploring and searching for more

Voices from the past
Never would surrender
I hear them calling
Mother Russia!
Mother Russia!

A legacy greater than ever in history
Nothing would be the same
Imperial emperors, war after war
Confusion and so much pain

Voices from the past
Never would surrender
I hear them calling
Mother Russia!
Mother Russia!
