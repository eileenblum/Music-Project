I see castle walls
Towers standing call
Mountains rising from the sea
I can feel her next to me in the mist
She's so beautiful I can't resist
Can't touch her she vanishes
I know it's only a matter of time
I've got to find her and make her mine
But this is only a land of illusion
Filled with confusion

Lake a labyrinth
Now I'm lost within
Nothing is as it appears
Minutes seem like years
Finally, there she stands
Reach our tenderly to touch her hand
Feel her kiss, she vanishes
I know it's only a matter of time
I've got to find her and make her mine
But this is only a matter of time
I've got to find her and make her mine
But this is only a land of illusion
Filled with confusion

Ancient memories
Are clear to me
Deja-vu
Now I know how well to break the spell
She'll be with me forever now
I know it's only a matter of time
I've got to find her and make her mine
But this is only a land of illusion
Filled with confusion
