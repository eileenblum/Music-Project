From the first moment of time
The fabric of life stars to unwind
With every breath
Closer to death
With every passing day
Oceans are made
Starting with single drops of rain coming down
Season change
Rearranging
And every ending becomes the beginning
The world keeps spinning

And the circle keeps on turning evermore
Gone forever each moment pure
But tomorrow, morning sun is gonna shine
There's no stopping the circle of time

Dynasties going to war
Fight to the last to even the score
Win or lose, still they want more
Power and Majesty, tempered with greed
Holding to key the peace that they never see
Season change
Rearranging
And every ending becomes the beginning
The world keeps spinning

And the circle keeps on turning evermore
Gone forever each moment pure
But tomorrow, morning sun is gonna shine
There's no stopping the circle of time
