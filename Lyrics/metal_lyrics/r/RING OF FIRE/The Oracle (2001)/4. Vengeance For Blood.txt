Another day lonely day
Fading to grey
There's no getting away
So tired of lying away
Feeling my cold heart break
There's nothing more I can take
I know before morning comes
I'll do what has got to be done
I'm gonna make it right tonight
Tonight
I'm riding for vengeance
Vengeance for blood
I'm racing the engines
Vengeance for blood

For everything you have done
Your time has come
Now there's nowhere to run
You have started a war
You escaped death before
But you won't anymore
I know before morning comes
I'll do what has got to be done
I'm gonna make it right tonight
Tonight

I'm riding for vengeance
Vengeance for blood
I'm racing the engines
Vengeance for blood

It's time to make you play
There's nothing you can do
Don't you know I got nothing to lose
I been counting every hour
Till I see your face
How much longer will I have to wait!
