City of golden design
Buried with unspoken treasure inside
Nobody knows of the danger it hides
Center of power and greed
Deep in the tomb's where they planted the seed
Waiting for victims
Ready to feed

It's the city of the dead
Lonely streets where ancient spirits tread
In the city of the dead
You can hear the voice in your head
In the temple's secret passage
Evil curses said
Heed their warning to stay away
City of the dead

Hundreds of centuries old
Places where legends and stories are told
Unknowing victims come searching for gold

It's the city of the dead
Lonely streets where ancient spirits tread
In the city of the dead
You can hear the voice in your head
In the temple's secret passage
Evil curses said
Heed their warning to stay away
City of the dead
