Voices in your mind, from another time
Tell you what to say, travel far away
Go wherever they lead you
But still no one believes you
It's all in your hands. You must save your land
Restore everything to the rightful king
But whatever to you
You can't deny what you know in your heart to be true
If the evil queen calls you a liar
Face the fire!

With a sword of light, fight the black knights
Set the people free, fill their destiny
Everyone has invited. To a country united
Then they set a trap. No more turning back
No attempt to flee, from the enemy
Even good friends betray you
But you can deny what you know in your
Heart to be true
When the evil king calls you a liar
Face the fire

In the final tale. Captured, thrown in jail
Charged with sorcery. And indecency
For arousing suspicion. Trial and inquisition
People need to learn. Witches have to burn
It is simple fate. Put them to the stake
Try to break you with torture
But you can deny what you know in your
Heart to be true
When the evil king calls you a liar
Face the fire
