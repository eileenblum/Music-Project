Moon in the eastern sky
The warrior's lullaby
The rising sun
Soon will come
A glorious time to die
Armour, lance and sword
Murder, aim and gore
On and on
Generals fight destiny
Soon they're gone
To the world of dreams

Song of the Samurai
Living and dying for honor and glory
Their whole life forsaking
For all time awaking
Legends forever

On gilded horses ride
As arrows start to fly
And blood will spill
Up until
Everything wrong's made right
Armour, lance and sword
Murder, aim and gore
On and on
Generals fight destiny
Soon they're gone
To the world of dreams
