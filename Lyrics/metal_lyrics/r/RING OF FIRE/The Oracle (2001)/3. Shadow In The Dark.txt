First to came to me
Tried a friend to be
Then you started to hate
Full of jealousy
Became my enemy
There was nothing to say
But when the sun rises high there's no place for you
You'll be gone away but you won't even leave a mark
Just remember you are just a shadow of the dark

Someday you will see
What you did to me
How you turned me away
Stole my dignity
Then you laughed at me
Tried to drive me insane
But when the sun rises high there's no place for you
You'll be gone away but you won't even leave a mark
Just remember you are just a shadow of the dark

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
From all your lies
Morning has come
You're caught in the light of day
Now you're gonna melt away
