I wake up and wonder
How many days are gone
I look out my window
The blue sky goes on and on

Now my mind goes round and around
Feeling like Iâm lost and found
Life is just a mystery
Guess thatâs the way itâs supposed to be

No way to know by now
The happy ending
Iâve got to find somehow

Every time I remember
I get captured by the memory of you
Suddenly I canât go on

Iâve traveled so far now
But youâre all I think about
Remember the last lime
We just tried to talk it out

Life is just a mystery
Guess thatâs the way itâs supposed to be

No way to know by now
The happy ending
Iâve got to find somehow

Every time I remember
I get captured by the memory of you
Suddenly I canât go on

No way to know by now
The happy ending
Iâve got to find somehow

Every time I remember
I get captured by the memory of you
Suddenly I canât go on
