On a journey celestial
To a planet forbidden
All alone on a mission of hope
Thatâs where I found you

Now forever you cast your spell of love on me
And I will love you âtil the end of time
Forever mine
Until the brightest stars fall from the sky

When galaxies die
Iâll stand by
Our love will still survive

Whatever it takes
Iâll dedicate
Into infinity

Until the end of time

I was lost in a shadowland
âTil I saw your light shining
Mesmerizing my mind with your thoughts
You were so beautiful

Now forever you, cast your spell of love on me
I will love you âtil the end of time
Forever mine
Until the brightest stars fall from the sky

When galaxies die
Iâll stand by
Our love will still survive

Whatever it takes
Iâll dedicate
Into infinity

When galaxies die
Iâll stand by
Our love will still survive

Whatever it takes
Iâll dedicate
Into infinity

Until the end of time
Until the end of time
