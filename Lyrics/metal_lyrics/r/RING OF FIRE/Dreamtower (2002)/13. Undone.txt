In a dark world
Youâve been waiting so long
Now the feeling is so strong

Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
Never surrender
Just keep fighting to survive

Try to break free
And someday youâll see
The true light of liberty
Like the rising of the sun
Shining on everyone

Run
The race has begun
Run
Itâs time to become
Undone

Like a time bomb
Slowly ticking away
Silently comes the rampage

Written in blood
All over the world
(Thereâs) no peace
Until justice has been unfurled

Has to be all
Or nothing at all
Until the last drop falls
âTil the world becomes as one
âTil darkness is overcome

Run
The race has begun
Run
Itâs time to become
Undone

Try to break free
And someday youâll see
The true light of liberty
Like the rising of the sun
Shining on everyone

Has to be all
Or nothing at all
Until the last drop falls
âTil the world becomes as one
âTil darkness is overcome

(You get your) run
The race has begun
Run
(Now your) time has come
Run
Itâs time to become
Undone
