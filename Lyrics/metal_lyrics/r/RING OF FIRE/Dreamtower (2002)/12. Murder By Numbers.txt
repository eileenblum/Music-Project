The silicon city
Would like to welcome you in
But there is no pity
And no one is your friend
Be careful how you connect

Data combines in so many ways
So many numbers get out of place
Digital crime can happen to you
Your numbers taken by somebody new

Just when you think no oneâs watching you
And all your systems are safe
A warning light means itâs already too late

Now your computer wonât understand
Anything you try to say
An empty screen
No way to communicate

Now you are nobody
Your life has been taken away
Now you just keep falling
Like youâre a victim of fate
Every system is failing you

Run out of water, run out of food
Itâs hard to breathe, it doesnât look good
Losing your senses, losing your mind
Silence so loud is your lullaby

Just when you think no oneâs watching you
And all your systems are safe
A warning light means itâs already too late

Just when you think no oneâs watching you
And all your systems are safe
A warning light means itâs already too late

Now your computer wonât understand
Anything you try to say
An empty screen
No way to communicate
