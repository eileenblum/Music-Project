My dÃ©jÃ  vu
I still remember you
My dream come true
A feeling so strong

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
I still remember you
My dream come true
A feeling so strong

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
There is no one like you
What can I do
Now that youâre gone

There is no time
There is no space
In the land of nevermore
The midnite sky goes on forever
A sea without a shore

Strange memories
Calling to me
Speaking in my own words
I start to remember, the feeling returns

There is a princess behind a golden door
Itâs so familiar, like Iâve been here before

Iâll follow my dream
Itâs my destiny to bring you back with me

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
I still remember you
My dream come true
A feeling so strong

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
There is no one like you
What can I do
Now that youâre gone

Just out of reach
Like sand on the beach
The waves keep reaching for more
Eternal flame, in stormy weather
Keeps burning like before

Out of the blue
Visions of you
Come crashing into my brain
So hard to recover, it drives me insane

There is a princess behind a golden door
I know the feeling, like Iâve been here before

Iâll follow my dream
Itâs my fantasy to bring you back with me

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
I still remember you
My dream come true
A feeling so strong

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
There is no one like you
What can I do
Now that youâre gone

Iâll follow my dream
Itâs my fantasy to bring you back with me

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
I still remember you
My dream come true
A feeling so strong

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
There is no one like you
What can I do
Now that youâre gone

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
(My dÃ©jÃ  vu)
I still remember you
My dream come true
A feeling so strong
(A feeling so strong)

My dÃ©jÃ  vu
There is no one like you
(What can I do)
What can I do
Now that youâre gone
(Oooh no!)
