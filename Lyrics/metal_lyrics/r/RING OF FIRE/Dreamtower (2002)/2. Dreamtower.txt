Deep in the night you awaken
To a feeling so alone
Donât know which path you have taken
Your surroundings so unknown

Are you still sleeping
This canât be reality
Your bed is floating on clouds on the open sea

Now, finally
You can see
That you are

Dreaming inside a dreamtower
The dream within a dream
Dreaming inside a dreamtower
Nothing is what it seems

How many doors must you open
âTil you find the (one) to escape
All your words remain unspoken
Memories have been erased

Are you still sleeping
This canât be reality
All (movements) frozen
Now you have been chosen

To be
Finally
In the place that you are

Dreaming inside a dreamtower
The dream within a dream
Dreaming inside a dreamtower
Nothing is what it seems

Suddenly elucidated
And your dreams have all gone away
Everything so complicated
Itâs so hard to ascertain

Are you still sleeping
This canât be reality
Look out your windowpane
Now you are floating in space

Once again
You can see that you are

Dreaming inside a dreamtower
The dream within a dream
Dreaming inside a dreamtower
Nothing is what it seems
(No!)

Dreaming inside a dreamtower
The dream within a dream
Dreaming inside a dreamtower
Nothing is what it seems

(Dreaming that dream within a dream in Dreamtower
Dreaming that dream within a dream in Dreamtower)
