On the sea of clouds
On the shores of heaven
From the north to the south
To the portals of time

On a desert isle
On a untouched mountain
On a river wild
Searching for the sublime

An imaginary state
So hard to create

System Utopia
Crystal domain

The simplicity
Of a single vision
An eternity
That is one of a kind

An imaginary state
So hard to create

System Utopia
Crystal domain

An imaginary state
So hard to create
System Utopia
Crystal domain

System Utopia
Home on the range
