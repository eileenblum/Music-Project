Archipelagic
Counter attraction tactics
Science and magic
In Laputa

Abstracts nomadic
Blood line aristocratic
Something so tragic
In Laputa

The music of spheres resounds
In a symphony of sound
A floating cloud domicile
Laputa, celestial isle

Phantasmagoric
Kaleidoscopic stories
Time metamorphic
In Laputa

Kingdom exotic
Citizens aeronautic
Victims of logic
In Laputa

Just watching the world below
With knowledge nobody knows
Our destiny intertwined
Laputa is yours and mine

The music of spheres resounds
In a symphony of sound
A floating cloud domicile
Laputa, celestial isle

Just watching the world below
With knowledge nobody knows
Our destiny intertwined
Laputa is yours and mine

(Laputa, celestial isle)
