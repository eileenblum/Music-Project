For ten thousand years undisturbed
Under the earth
The treasures of mighty kings
Strange happenings

The knowledge of ancient earth
Riddles of antiquity
Frozen in time
Manage to survive

The children of the sun
Awakened and disturbed
Canât be reversed

The strangers thought they never
Find themselves forever
Haunted by the Pharaohâs curse

In perfect alignment and size
Pyramids of the Nile
Mirroring distant stars
Strange counterparts

The knowledge of ancient earth
Riddles of antiquity
Frozen in time
Manage to survive

The children of the sun
Awakened and disturbed
Canât be reversed

The raiders thought they never
Find themselves forever
Haunted by the Pharaohâs curse

The children of the sun
Awakened and disturbed
Canât be reversed

The raiders thought they never
Find themselves forever
Haunted by the Pharaohâs curse

(Nooo!)
