From the deserts to the oceanside
From the mountains to the plains
From two thousand years of peaceful life
To only strife and pain

Came to move them from ancestral homes
Bringing howling winds of war
To see the endless sky and earth below
Nevermore

Death and destruction
Came rolling from all directions
Then came the deal makers
Selling their lies

A forgotten people
Forced to wander the earth

Never respected
Only (neglected)
Theirs is the ghost of America

Receiving no honor
Holding on to their pride

Only were cheated
Never defeated
Theirs is the ghost of America

Many generations had come and gone
But their land was never changed
Life in harmony with nature reigned
Until the white men came

Until they said this is our promised land
It's our eminent domain
Let's destroy all traces of the past
Let nothing remain

Death and destruction
Came rolling from all directions
Then came the deal makers
Selling their lies

A forgotten people
Forced to wander the earth

Never respected
Only rejected
Theirs is the ghost of America

Receiving no honor
Holding on to their pride

Only were cheated
Never defeated
Theirs is the ghost of America

Death and destruction
Came rolling from all directions
Then came the deal makers
Selling their lies

A forgotten people
Forced to wander the earth

Never respected
Only rejected
Theirs is the ghost of America

Receiving no honor
Holding on to their pride

Only were cheated
Never defeated
Theirs is the ghost of America
