Yesterday
Seems like a long time ago
I found out
What I still donât know

Please donât say things will never be the same
Just for today

Letâs just make believe that weâre in love again
Any fool could see weâre more than only friends
Letâs just make believe weâre sorry and pretend
Instead of going our separate ways
Letâs make believe

I wonât mind
If the sun doesnât shine
A day without you is just a waste of time

Weâve come too far to throw it all away
Just for today

Letâs just make believe that weâre in love again
Any fool could see weâre more than only friends
Letâs just make believe weâre sorry and pretend
Instead of going our separate ways
Letâs make believe

Oooh...

Letâs stay together once again
Until forever

Just take my hand
Youâll understand
All that I am

I want you back with me
Why canât you see
How it could be

Letâs just make believe that weâre in love again
Any fool could see weâre more than only friends
Letâs just make believe weâre sorry and pretend
Instead of going our separate ways
Letâs make believe
(That weâre in love again)
Letâs make believe

(Letâs just make believe weâre sorry and pretend
Instead of going our separate...)
