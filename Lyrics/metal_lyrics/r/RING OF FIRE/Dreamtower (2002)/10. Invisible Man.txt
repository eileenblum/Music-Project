[Lyrics and Melodies by Mark Boals / Music by Virgil Donati]
[2002 Boalsongs BMI / Gildon Music BMI]

Under the cover of darkness I sleep
In an empty street
With the collection of memories to keep
There is no one to meet

People pointing their face to the sky
Never wondering why

A unique specialty
Turns to madness

They donât understand
Nobody can
Donât know who I am
Invisible man

A small grain of sand
I reach out my hand
Invisible man

I try to tell them but no one can see
What is happening to me
Everything coming apart at the seams
But at least I am free

Sometimes I feel like I donât want to try
But Iâm too lonely to die

A unique specialty
Filled with sadness

They donât understand
Nobody can
Donât know who I am
Invisible man

A small grain of sand
I reach out my hand
Invisible man

They donât understand
Nobody can
Donât know who I am
Invisible man

A small grain of sand
I reach out my hand
Invisible man

They donât understand
Nobody can
Donât know who I am
Invisible man

A small grain of sand
I reach out my hand
Invisible man
