Apocalypse liberty
Resolute enemy
Always demands another sacrifice

Said to illuminate
Another world create
Only the innocent will pay the price

Public absentee
From reality
Propaganda to believe

No one is willing to trace the trajectory
Of systems of treachery
Aimed right at you and me

Evolution
Coming down on me
Revolution
Refuge of the free

TV mentality
Intelligence mockery
Daily destruction feeds the appetite

Total apathy
Perfect strategy
Counting the numbers like a game

Behind the scenes partners pretending to disagree
Forcing distraction from their real anarchy

Evolution

Coming down on me
Revolution
Refuge of the free

Infomachinery
Hypocrite prophecy
Goes from illusion to insanity

Public absentee
From reality
Propaganda to believe

No one is willing to trace the trajectory
Of systems of treachery
Aimed right at you and me

Evolution
Coming down on me
Revolution
Refuge of the free
