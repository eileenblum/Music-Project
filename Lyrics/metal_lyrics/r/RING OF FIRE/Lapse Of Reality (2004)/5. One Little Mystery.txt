Don't be misled by the color
Of any clouds in the sky
Cause it's so hard to discover
Any reasons why
We were like birds of a feather
Together all of the time
Our loving always delivered
The sweetest of wine

And the end to the story
I'm still trying to find
It's so hard not to worry
Cause I can see in you and me
One little mystery
Somewhere in history
Something that used to be
One little mystery

I don't walk any others
I don't believe in goodbyes
But it's so cold in the summer when
Your sun doesn't shine
Feel like I'm stuck at the bottom
No way to get to the top
I go to get where I am going to
And never stop

And the end to the story
I'm still trying to find
It's so hard not to worry
Cause I can see in you and me
One little mystery
Somewhere in history
Something that used to be
One little mystery
