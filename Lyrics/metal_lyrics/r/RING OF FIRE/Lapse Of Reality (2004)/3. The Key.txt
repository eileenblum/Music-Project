Love, love is the key
Inside of you
Inside of me
Why, why can't you see
Unlock your sadness and be free

Thousands of silvery ships sail into the sun
Ready for destiny with their guns
Some of them won't make it back
And some will survive
There's no permission to ask why

War is so useless
When no one wins anyway

Love, love is the key
Inside of you
Inside of me
Why, why can't you see
Unlock your sadness and be free

Now there's a cold bitter wind
That's blowing again
Taking all feeling from hearts of men
So hard to see through the tears that keep us apart
So tired of making a new start

War is so useless
When no one wins anyway

Love, love is the key
Inside of you
Inside of me
Why, why can't you see
Unlock your sadness and be free
