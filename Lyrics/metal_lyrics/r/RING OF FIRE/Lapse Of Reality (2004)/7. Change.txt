All those times you tabled them
Downtown conversations
I'm only seeing nothing but lies and reputations
Caught in a landslide no easy way to go down
Desperately dancing through all the tears
That I found
Open another sail
Get over this dry prevail
Finding a better play to twist things around

Change
It feels so strange
It's a brand new game
Change
Nothing's the same
You're the one to blame

Everything comes around to I told you so
And how you play it
Always abusing one of a kind will surely break it
Never look back now
You never want to slow down
Leave it behind you
There's nothing left in this town
Escape to another day
A habitual hideaway
Making a clean getaway when no one's around

Change
It feels so strange
It's a brand new game
Change
Nothing's the same
You're the one to blame

Time for you and me
To be free
