Wandering the deepest night
Out of dreams and out of light
Lost my reason why
Close my eyes, don't want to see
All that was no more will be
I'm no longer me

If I had a machine
That could change yesterday to tomorrow
Then I could be free
To undo all the pain and the sorrow

Drowning in a sea of doom
Deep within my mental tomb
Ending came too soon

If I had a machine
That could change yesterday to tomorrow
Then I could be free
To undo all the pain and the sorrow

I'm no longer me...
