Haven't you heard
What they are sayin' seems so absurd
It can't be true
I can't believe it, it can't be you

Are you that kind of man?
I just don't understand
Why don't you show your hand?
I keep hearing
You're that kind of man

Heaven and earth
Fall from your fingers, what is it worth
Where is the crime
Why does it linger, wasting your time
Aren't you concerned
Aren't you preparing your crash and burn

Are you that kind of man?
I just don't understand
Why don't you show your hand?
I keep hearing
You're that kind of man

Now you're going down
Got those photographs you denied
You look like a clown
So surprised
