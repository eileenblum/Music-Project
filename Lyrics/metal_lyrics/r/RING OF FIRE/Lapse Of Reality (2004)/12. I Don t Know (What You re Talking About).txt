Now the good old days are gone
And there is no more integrity
No more right or wrong
So what is getting better
Stay the course and take no heed
It's a factual emergency
No apology
No one will write a letter

Leading moral values low
An agenda that we'll never see
No one ever knows
until after tomorrow
Human deficit is high
What has happened to the family
Wills are running dry
To find some hope to borrow

Tomorrow, tomorrow
Will be a better day
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tell us now to doubt
But, I don't know what you're talking about

Nothing's ever what it seems
All that matters is efficiency
Never mind our dreams
They are swiftly passing
Tell us war delivers peace
After leveling divergency
Can it ever cease
Conflict everlasting

Tomorrow, tomorrow
Will be a better day
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tell us now to doubt
But, I don't know what you're talking about
