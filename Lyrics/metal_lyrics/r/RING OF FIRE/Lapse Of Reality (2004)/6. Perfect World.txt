Everyone has a plan
Everyone has demands
One grain of sand makes a pearl
I want a perfect world
Making promises is easier
That to fulfill
A miracle will last forever

We are the people of the planet
We all imagine a perfect world
The kind of place where everything's alright
We are connected, we are troubled
So many answers, still no cure
Sleeping on dreams of a perfect world tonight

Why are you trying to hide
We're all the same inside
So many flags are unfurled
I want a perfect world
All our life is only just a feather in the wind
A miracle will last forever

We are the people of the planet
We all imagine a perfect world
The kind of place where everything's alright
We are connected, we are troubled
So many answers, still no cure
Sleeping on dreams of a perfect world tonight
