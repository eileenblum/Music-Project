In the misty silence dark
Feeling like my soul is fading
Emptiness reveals my heart
Everything becomes forsaken
I stare at these walls surrounding me
Each tick of the clock is misery

If I lost my memory
Would you still remember me
Blinded momentarily
A lapse of reality

Now the light has come and gone
Feeling like my life is broken
Useless words just come and go
Lost before they can be spoken
I try to explain impulsively
With lines of insane geometry

If I lost my memory
Would you still remember me
Blinded momentarily
A lapse of reality
