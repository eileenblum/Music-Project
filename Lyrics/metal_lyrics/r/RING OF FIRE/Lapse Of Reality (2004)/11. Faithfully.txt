It's been such a long time
I don't remember before
Situations combined
I can't take anymore
Should I put up the fight
Or just walk out the door
Leave this prison behind
Got to even the score

You never will set me free
From your need
From your greed

Every day, every night
Every wrong, every right
Every black, every white
Faithfully
Every high, every low
Every yes, every no
Every goodbye, every hello
Faithfully

I see you watching me
Painfully, endlessly
Counting my misery

If I made up my mind
You will already know
If I gave you a sign
You will never let go
So whatever I say
Will be counted untrue
And what ever I pray
Won't be enough for you

You never will set me free
From your need
From your greed

Every day, every night
Every wrong, every right
Every black, every white
Faithfully
Every high, every low
Every yes, every no
Every goodbye, every hello
Faithfully
