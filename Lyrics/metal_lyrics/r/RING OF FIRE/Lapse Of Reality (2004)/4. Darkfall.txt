There comes a time
When the clouds are too heavy to fly
Shadows inside
Desperate feelings are trying to hide
In the night something happens in the dark
Unexplained

Don't let the sun go down
Don't let it hit the ground
Don't wanna hear the sound
Don't let the sun go down

Look in the mirror
But the answers are not very clear
What do I see?
Don't remember who I'm supposed to be
In the night something happens in the dark
Unexplained

Don't let the sun go down
Don't let it hit the ground
Don't wanna hear the sound
Don't let the sun go down
Mountains of fear
Standing over a wall of tears
Is this my life?
I feel deader that if I had died
In the night something happens in the dark
Unexplained

Don't let the sun go down
Don't let it hit the ground
Don't wanna hear the sound
Don't let the sun go down
