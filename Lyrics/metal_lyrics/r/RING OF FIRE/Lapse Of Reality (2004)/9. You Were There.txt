You were there
When I was all alone without a friend
You were there
When everything went wrong
You were there
To help me to go on and not pretend
You were there
To help me to be strong
Now you are gone
But deep inside me
You still live on, because

You lifted me up
Carried me over mountains I could never cross
You were my strength
You were my reason to be found when I was lost
You showed me the way
Always believing and never counting the cost
So every day
I thank the lord above that you're my hero

You were there
To keep me warm through all the coldest nights
You were there
To melt my heart of stone
You were there
To rescue me when I was losing sight
You were there, to bring me back home
Now you are gone
But deep inside me
You still live on, because

You lifted me up
Carried me over mountains I could never cross
You were my strength
I thank the lord above that you're my hero

Out on my own, at least I know
I'm never alone
