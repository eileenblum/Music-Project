How many teardrops have you cried
And left you inspired
How many dreams have left you dry
To find your desire
How many people never learn
To open their eyes
How many bridges will they burn
With so many lies?
In the morning after
Nothing really matters

Saint fire, call your flame
From the mountain
Saint fire, light the way
Burn the darkness
Saint fire, judgement day
Comes just like a lonely dancer

Calling on visions from the past
The people decide
What to destroy and what should last
The facts are denied
Burning hearts can never
Stay asleep forever

Saint fire, call your flame
From the mountain
Saint fire, light the way
Burn the darkness
Saint fire, judgement day
Comes just like a lonely dancer
