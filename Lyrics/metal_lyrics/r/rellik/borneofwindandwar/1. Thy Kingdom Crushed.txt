This is not the punishment for your deeds
Rather this is the penance for your convince
For the fact that you played the game
And attempted to win
Now the lids of your eyes are removed
You will see the truth
I am the creator of the game
Your every move plotted out against
Every thought you had I read
Every stab that you made at my back
I saw it... and now... You know that I am God
I condemn you woth my hand of holiness
The flames of the abyss are burning at your feet
I am the Lord of the Pit wicked in my ways
I damn you from above and burn you from below

Because you are nothing, you have gained no ground
You slide down the rungs of the ladder to your salvation
Denied from the beginning of existence
With my godly powers I gave you hope
You wondered where it came from so I broke it
You denied my powers as your savior
So with my black hand I took your soul and ate it

I took your circle of beliefs and burned
Then put out the flames and gave you what remained
A meaningless pointless life that you flaunt
And no-one is deceived when you try to beat me
They see inside you
The shattered remains of your life
