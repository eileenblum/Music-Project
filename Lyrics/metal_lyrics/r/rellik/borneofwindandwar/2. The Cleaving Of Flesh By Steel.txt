I call to the Gods for vengeance
I praise the Gods of War
I beg of thee not ocurage, for courege is embedded in my soul
I thank thee for my strength
I praise thee for my will
My will matches yours, and firever we will kill

With sword in hand I serve you
Before massive armies I stand alone
As blood is shed on the field
I cry to you for more to kill

Murder is not the term for this is slaughter
For the weak are pulling on the chains of my rage
They beg for this blood soaked carnage
Their actions induce their downfall

I am the sword of the gods bludgeoning
The legions of the weak
Their blood is like a fire licking the icy shell of my heart
I am inspired by hatred I am inspired by the weak
I beg to hear their cries the pathetic pleas to save their wretched lives
