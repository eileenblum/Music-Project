I awake to the abundance of souls weak and astray
Cowering in fear of their lord they try to make amends
Now I take their souls
The weak ones are crushed to display to the others
Pathetic attempts to assuage my anger
Will meet my wrath with an iron fist
My strength will smash their souls
I guard the gate to the ground of atonement

Where the remains of smothered souls are buried
Defiled by the absence of a service
Weak souls deserve no ritual

I am the one who leads the weak to their downfall
Follow me
No eyes so their eyes can't see the fight blinded
We have no mercy when pour death
comes without warning
