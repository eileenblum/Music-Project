Thunder give me the strength to strike
Lightning guide my sword to hack to stab to kill with might

I harness the strength of the storm that gathers on the sea
there will be no questions when the storm brings its destruction
It will be me the commander of the black winds
My hands generate strength and weild this sword of flame
Instant cauterization of the wound
Cleanly severed heads serve as trophies for my tomb
I gather the souls of the dead and bring them to my side

You will not be surprised when the walls of your kingdom are crushed
By my hands alone
I need no weapon to destroy you
Because I know your weakness

Slaughtered the weak lie on their backs
After my sword took off their head
Letting the soul to escape to be taken into my hands
My legions multiply as the weal fall to their knees

Gods give me the strength to gather my souls
I am the planter of the seeds of the storm
I the cammander o the black winds
My sword rests before your throne

Now I'm granted grace and the strength of the Gods
I can die in peace
My body left to rot in whole my soul will ascend
To the gates of the gods
There my soul will sleep amongst the lords of the storm
