Weaponless I stand on this battlefield
So tall above the rest
I face an enemy too great in thrength and mass
My pride an courage have left
And now my soul is silled with fear

I hear my own heart pounding in my ears
Know that I will suffer for countless days
And that I will never forget this pain
Know that I will rise again

From my death you will create more death
Each stab at me will release a stabbing

Each time I've felt fear I will return to you

Know that I conquer know that I crush
And when you're on your knees that I have triumphed

And as I ask for my death fill your heart with victory
Turn your head and walk away forget my being
Your torture has made me stronger
With these last few days of life
I will come back again and fight
Now I have stufied and learned the path of the righteous
I have studied myself from uotside my body
So I abandon it and all its frailties
And attack with a force beyond your reckoning
