I kneel before this throne and channel the energy of the ages
I look inside myself for the strength to smash the worlds races
I close my eyes clench my fist and rise up for a new awareness has been given

I weigh their souls before the slaughter
I balance sin with the blood of the conquered
I am the weilder of the holy sword

Millions drop before me
Their blood cannot stain me
It fills me with energy
They scream in terror they scream in fear
Witnessing the blood loss the holy cleansing

They gaze into my eyes and see my wrath
The sins of a race who chose the wrong path

And now they see the fire burning for a million years
Witnessing their end reduces them to tears
Drowning in blood survivors will be burned
I point my sword and fire shoots forth
Cleansing the last inhabitants of the earth
