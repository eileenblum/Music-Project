I am a man of honor
I am a man of word
I am a man with sword
Who will rape you to the throne

I will use my strength
I will use my sword
And you point and laugh
At this force that removes you from control

This steel is sharpened into sword
I remove the flesh from bone
My blood is in my veins as yours is on the floor
A visual depicting the slaughter and the gore
I hold my head in pride upon my shoulders
Harnessing the power to drive this mass murder

In my fist is hair connected to your severed head
Decapitation the means by which I proved my strength
As you hope and pray I hew hack and slay
Such is the speed with which I lay to waste
No grave for the weak
You are left to rot
So to the vultures you will fall as prey

And now you know my sword I spoke and followed through
I proved to you the strength of my mind, heart and sword
