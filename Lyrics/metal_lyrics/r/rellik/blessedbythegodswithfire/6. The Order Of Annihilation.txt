United we will stand divided you shall fall
Conjuring the earth to quake and boulders to break
Commanding the winds and the violent tidal waves
We are the cause of volcanic eruption
In selfish vain glory we undo your nation
Embalming the earth with blood and fire

The strength of the ancients will bring domination
The trumpets sound the doom o the angels choir
Now sound the sirens o armageddon
We are the order of annihilation

The alignment of the planets
The force of our lord Nergal
The banishment of inhabitants
The completion of our tribunal

Now raise the smoky curtains of the stage
And reveal the downfall of the age
Watch the performance on this theatre made of bone
Where human slaughter and tragedy are the only show
