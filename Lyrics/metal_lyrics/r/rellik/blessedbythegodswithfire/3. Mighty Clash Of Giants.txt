In this lifetime I will not witness the end of this earth
But I can imagine the ball of flame that will engulf this
A light so bright our eyes could not classify its colors
By the time we'd see its light it would be too late

Light years away
A massive planet much larger than ours is burning
Swept with storm and stress and made of flammable gas
A planet in flames will only further incinerate
In its path of explosion is our planet Earth

No one will survive
Nothing will be left
The earth cannot withstand
A nuclear blast

Burning winds churning a maelstrom beyond comprehension
No dust no ash, nothing will be let o human construction

In the wake of flame a hole is left in space
Sucking up the waste its speed is so great
The magnetic poles of this earth will break
No gravitational pull we'll fall right off this earth

Our spines would crack in half from galactic whiplash
In seconds we would die
Suffocating in space
Our blackened mangled bodies unidentifiable from the blackened sky
