Blessed by the Gods with fire
Blessed by the Gods with sword
Wielding this god given strength to crush the weak
In the Art of War

My hand alight with fire the other red from blood
Thy kingdom consumed by flame
Thy armies disassembled by my sword

That which sustains your life spills upon the earth
The blood once in your veins spills upon my face
The soul is let free through the hacking of your neck
Bone and flesh break now your soul I will take and rape

I place myself on the throne
Through my efforts of annihilation
The reign of the weak has been stopped by me
Their crown is crushed and their pages torn

The bells chime with the ring o your demise
You saw the white clouds turn black in the sky
The ring of fire has encircled you
From my hand the flame was borne
The sword is drawn and the time is now to kneel down

A raging inferno of blood and fire incinerates the weak
Now that it's time to die who will you call your god

The One you betrayed by your acts laughs at you
My hand is judgement
My eyes have seen your crimes
So your soul is crushed with the swing of my hammer
