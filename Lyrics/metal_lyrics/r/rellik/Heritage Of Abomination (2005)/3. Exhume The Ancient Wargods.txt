How we pray to the ancients for vengeance, we ask for one last fighting chance
Let us break these chains of enslavement our free hands deliver judgement
God of the bleeding sphere called Mars, open the gates let your armies harge
Fill this gorge of war with the blood of our captors, the touch of spear and axe fills our hearts with rapture

The opening of the cosmic war has begun
This is the last battle between gods and men

How we pray to the ancients for vengeance, we ask for one last fighting chance

"We have arisen as Horus and sit down as Ptah
We are strong as Thoth and mighty as Atum

We speak with our mouths in order to seek out our foe
They have been given to us and shall not be taken from us"
[Taken from The ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead:
Spell 11: "Spell for going out against a foe in the realm of the dead"]

The wrath of the gods is inspired by the shedding of our blood
Invoke the violence of the ancients by the rape of our women
Upon the throne of genocide we are seated built with the blood of the defeated
The inhumanity of man against man is beyond belief
