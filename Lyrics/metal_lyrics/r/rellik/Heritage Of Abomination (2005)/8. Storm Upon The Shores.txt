I tread lightly through the night, becoming shadow-like
You will hear no sound, no indication that I am there
Except for the fear, unexplainable when I am near
I will haunt and stalk, before I strike
I like to see the paranoia develop into hysteria!!!
And the last moment when you are ready to break open
I will put my blade unto your throat and watch the bloo like fountains flow!!!

I am the storm upon the shores
The fire upon the blade
And mankind will never find
Peace from my campaign

When your throat has opened, the bleeding is severe
But half the fun of slitting throats is the gurgling you will hear
I instincts will take over and you put your hands to your neck
Realizing that the warm and wet is the blood RED!!!
I am not through yet, but the fountains have peaked, and when you realize
That it's useless to scream
The desperation inside drives you to survive, panic then attack, fight or flight
The lights begin to fade your head becoming heavy
And from the loss of blood you will become weary

I am the storm upon the shores
The snake in your garden
And once again I will wilt your flower to demonstrate the power of my resolve
My gaze is cold and hard
And I could stare for hours at my art
Time is of the essence and my presence must go undetected
