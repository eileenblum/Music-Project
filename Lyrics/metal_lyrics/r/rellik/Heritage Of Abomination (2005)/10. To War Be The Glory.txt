Our screams will fill the sky and the ravens will fall
Our blades will glow from he sun and our armor will flash like lightning
We will be like Michael with fiery sword and eyes of wrath
The lamenting of our enemies shall become deafening

"Let their blood be plentiful", let it pour from the sky like the great deluge
Let it be more potent than wine, it's nectar shall intoxicate us
We will be incessant and drunk, fighting in a battle-haze

Judgement be swift. Our wrath will be fire

Let their lies turn into venomous snakes
These horrible vipes shall bite their owners
Let the poison wind slowly through their veins
Let their pain be tenfold the hurt of their false tongues

Judgement be swift. Our wrath will be fire

The fluid of the body will become like acid
Their spit will spoil fertile ground, their semen will destroy the womb of mothers
Children will be incinerated upon conception and blood will retaliate against flesh

"Let their blood be plentiful", let it pour from the sky like the great deluge
Let it be more potent than wine, it's nectar shall intoxicate us
We will be incessant and drunk, fighting in a battle-haze

Our weapons will rend their diseased skin
Our blades will cut their heads from their necks
Our hammers will smash their hands and mouths - the tools of their deceit

Upon the cries - our songs of war, the clouds will break apart
Lightning and storm will hale down, the earth will break apart and shoot up flame
Our enemy will be consumed, the end of their days is near
