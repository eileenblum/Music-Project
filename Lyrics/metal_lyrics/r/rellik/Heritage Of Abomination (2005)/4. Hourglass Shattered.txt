Brick by brick this wall will crumble
Dust and debris mark our forced enemy

Sending up a sign th those inside the wall that their kingdom is soon to fall
My armies wait to charge so the enemy knows that it is time to die
This pause gives me time to observe the fear in their eyes
My armies charge like a gust of wind, the gushing of blood is soon to begin

My armies swarm like flies to carrion
As I wait behind the lines with my axe in hand
All those with fear who try to run, those will be the first to meet my weapon

Sending up a sign th those inside the wall that their kingdom is soon to fall
My armies wait to charge so the enemy knows that it is time to die
This pause gives me time to observe the fear in their eyes
My armies charge like a gust of wind, the gushing of blood is soon to begin

Heads are chopped flying through the air, a grisly sight of human despair
Fountains of blood reach to the sky, a violent display of my might
Now they know fear they feel its terrible grip, frozen cold, frozen stiff
The awful impression that death is imminent,
Can consume a man's soul and leave you lifeless
