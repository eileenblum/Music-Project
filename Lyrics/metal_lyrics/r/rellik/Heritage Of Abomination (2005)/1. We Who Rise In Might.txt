The four horsemen came and brought forth their plague
The scribes of history wall say
Before our savage journey we were a quiet people
With a culture and integrity
Then the storms came and the land it raped
Clouds broke and famine fell from the sky
Mouths were cracked and dry and tongues had forgotten water
Our empty stomachs churned themselves with hunger
I watched my brothers die from the land so dry
Like a fruit it withered and humanity writhed

I rise with Pride
To preserve myself I will fight

I scoff at the fate that came from the sky
Abandon my god, for this god let my family die
I rise in might, to preserve myself I will fight
Together we will ride and spill blood in the stream of life

We abandoned our home and took to the open road
Searching for a helping hand amongst fellow men
Looking like the plague rom which we came
Fellow men soon turned their backs

Forsaken by the gods
And outcast by humanity

We took by force our pride and integrity
Abandon your god, for this god will let your family die
I rise in might to preserve myself I will fight
Together we will ride and spill blood in the stream of life

We abandoned our home and took to the open road
Searching for a helping hand amongst fellow men
Looking like the plague rom which we came
Fellow men soon turned their backs
