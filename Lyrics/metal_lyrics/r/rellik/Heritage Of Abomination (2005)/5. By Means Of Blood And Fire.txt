Blood thirsty axe and sword we flail bodies
Chopped and dismembered humans now amputees

The flag of our land is blood upon the ground
A dead body marks our territory the hands that fought us will turn to dust
Severed and collected from the dead and all the hairs from their head

Blood thirsty axe and sword we flail bodies
Chopped and dismembered humans now amputees

The flag of our land is blood upon the ground
A dead body marks our territory the hands that fought us will turn to dust
Severed and collected from the dead and all the hairs from their head

We gather them up and let them rot, then throw them in the pit
Let fire cleanse them we chant to the gods as the fire starts to grow
Let us feast we chant to the gods as we start to eat

We conquerthen dismember the hair and hands we keep
We gather then make fire of our dead enemies
They suffer we devour now they know who is their king
Offer blood offer fire by these means will we conquer
