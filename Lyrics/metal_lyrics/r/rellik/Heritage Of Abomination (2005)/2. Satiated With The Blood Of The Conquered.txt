Attack!!!!
We are one and many a driving force consuming the enemy
Vengeance is mine for the time when their foot shall slip

The day of tragedy is at hand
So their doom comes swiftly

Uncontained hatred rains like fire from the sky
The wind and the storms and the fire is on our side

They sow the wind and shall reap the whirlwind
Men will be annihilated and women will be raped
Temples are ablaze we set fire to your faith
Where are your gods the rock in which you took refuge
Who drank the blood the wine of your libations?
Now nothing more than a memory in a mouth of Ashes

The day of tragedy is at hand
So their doom comes swiftly

See now that I, even I am he I am the god to be
I hold my hand to the sky and command from the throne
As I live forever when I whet my flashing sword
And my hand takes hold on Judgement
I will have Vengeance
I'll make my arrows drunk with the blood of the conquered
