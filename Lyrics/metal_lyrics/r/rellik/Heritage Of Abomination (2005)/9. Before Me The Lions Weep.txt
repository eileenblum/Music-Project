I throw my head back and gaze into the sky
Searching for divine protection of my life
I'm searching for hope and courage to fight
I drop my head and gaze upon the field where the flesh of men from bone is peeled
No longer can I contain this fear

I charge the field screaming like a maniac
The first wave falls as resistance builds to our attack
Shells explode men are dashed into the sky, like our hopes to make it out alive

Cold machines unforgiving
Sweeping fire through our lines
They are calibrated to destroy and to defy

The heads of men pop like melons, the extremities coarsely severed from tendors
I overlook a landscape of blood and blasted earth
Drawn by the violence of men who served shell craters early tombs for the deceased
Under armed the casualties steadily increase
No eulogy for those brave whom to the earth their blood they gave

Before these massive weapons that man has made to destroy man
Courage is impossible to summon at the sight of these machines
Which alone would make the mightest of lions weep

The heads of men pop like melons, the extremities coarsely severed from tendors
I overlook a landscape of blood and blasted earth
Drawn by the violence of men who served shell craters early tombs for the deceased
Under armed the casualties steadily increase
No eulogy for those brave whom to the earth their blood they gave
