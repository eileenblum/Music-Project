Time is right get on the line, just go nuts now
Stand in pride, take on the night be wild and free
Kick the beat, bring on the heat, rock you somehow
Sing along with our favourite song for the world to see

[Pre:]
Just another night we are Running wild

[Chorus:]
Me &amp; the boys we love that noise
Me &amp; the boys we are going crazy
Me &amp; the boys we make that noise
Cause Rock 'n' Roll is our choice

Rock so hard from the start, shake foundation
Hit the gas kick some ass until the dawn
Earth will quake, quiver and shake, the exaltation
Jump the beat, move the meat, create a storm

[Pre:]
Just another night we are Running wild

[Chorus:]
Me &amp; the boys we love that noise
Me &amp; the boys we are going crazy
Me &amp; the boys we make that noise
Cause Rock 'n' Roll is our choice

We'll come over, we are just standing proud
We will sweat and praise Rock'n'Roll
Raise your fist, we are all getting loud
And that's what we all came here for

Time is right get on the line, just go nuts now
Stand in pride, take on the night be wild and free
Kick the beat, bring on the heat, rock you somehow
Sing along with our favourite song for the world to see

[Pre:]
Just another night we are Running wild

[Chorus:]
Me &amp; the boys we love that noise
Me &amp; the boys we are going crazy
Me &amp; the boys we make that noise
Cause Rock 'n' Roll is our choice
