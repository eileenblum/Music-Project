Waves are pounding on the hull
On the wind the bones and skull
To lay our hands on easy prey
To take the fortune of the tray

Rum and powder in the air
Rapacious we face every dare
Our cannons are so justified
To gun down every ship in pride

[Pre:]
We are one with the wind, one with its glory
We are one with the waves, one with the sea

[Chorus:]
The Jolly Roger's flying high
The rigging's reaching for the sky
Riding on the tide
We take the freedom as our pride
We take the battle side by side
Riding on the tide

"Cat and mouse", it's time to play
We hunt them till their final day
Justice is our treatments name
Balls of lead the tool to tame

[Pre:]
We are one with the wind, one with its glory
We are one with the waves, one with the sea

[Chorus:]
The Jolly Roger's flying high
The rigging's reaching for the sky
Riding on the tide
We take the freedom as our pride
We take the battle side by side
Riding on the tide
