Hundred-fifty tons of steel, rolling through the night
Sparks are dancing in the smoke, the fire's raging wild
Hundredweights of blackest coal to feed its burning hunger
A melting pot of glowing steel, a hell of grime and smoke

[Pre:]
Smoke and fire, run that pyre

[Chorus:]
Steam and thunder gonna roll you under
Rage and fury gonna spell its name, Locomotive

The railway's gonna squeaking hard, wheels are dragging over
Red hot grease is on the steel, oiling all the bars
Rhythm's gonna pounding hard, the monsters own thunder
The whistle-pipe is blowing strong, foretelling what to come

[Pre:]
Smoke and fire, run that pyre

[Chorus:]
Steam and thunder gonna roll you under
Rage and fury gonna spell its name, Locomotive

The stoker's gonna shoveling coal to melt it in the fire
Sweat is dripping from his brow, vaporizing in the heat

Pressure's gonna rising high, speeding up the engine
Purgatory comes alive to burn on fires rage
So comon now

Hundred-fifty tons of steel, rolling through the night
Sparks are dancing in the smoke, the fire's raging wild
Hundredweights of blackest coal to feed its burning hunger
A melting pot of glowing steel, a hell of grime and smoke

[Pre:]
Smoke and fire, run that pyre

[Chorus:]
Steam and thunder gonna roll you under
Rage and fury gonna spell its name, Locomotive
