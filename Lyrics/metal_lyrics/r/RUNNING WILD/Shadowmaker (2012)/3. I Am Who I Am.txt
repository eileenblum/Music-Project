I am one to feel the fire, I am no one giving in
Always try to reach higher to keep my own world spin
Always fight reckless liars, I just wanna know for real
See the man behind the curtain, I always break the seal

All the world, going crazy, majority goes insane
Trying hard just to bait me, I keep right off the game

[Pre:]
I am on fire, for the world to see
The taste of freedom's got a hold on me

[Chorus:]
I am who I am and I always take a stand
And I keep the flag just high above my head
I am who I am and I always will defend
Cause I am who I am who I am

Wheel of time speeding up now, fashion is the crucial point
Integrity's fading somehow, I keep out of that joint

[Pre:]
I am on fire, for the world to see
The taste of freedom's got a hold on me

[Chorus:]
I am who I am and I always take a stand
And I keep the flag just high above my head
I am who I am and I always will defend
Cause I am who I am who I am

I am one to feel the fire, I am no one giving in
Always try to reach higher to keep my own world spin

[Pre:]
I am on fire, for the world to see
The taste of freedom's got a hold on me

[Chorus:]
I am who I am and I always take a stand
And I keep the flag just high above my head
I am who I am and I always will defend
Cause I am who I am who I am
