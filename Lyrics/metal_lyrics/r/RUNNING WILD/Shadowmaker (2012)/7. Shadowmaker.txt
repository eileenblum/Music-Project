A cross of light on the horizon
All evil is in prime of grease
The long awaited revelation's burning
A mission just to force redemption
By a fast reforming laser-beam
Melting evils' soul to kiss the void

Healing "pain" of being evil
By melting out atrocities
To ban their souls to send them back to hell

[Chorus:]
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker, beware of the soulbreaker
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker, he writes their name
Into the dust of their bones

The punishment long overdue
The debt collector heaven sent
To ban their souls to send them back to hell

[Chorus:]
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker, beware of the soulbreaker
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker, he writes their name
Into the dust of their bones

A consolation to the chosen
A nightmare to the evil one
To ban their souls to send them back to hell

[Chorus:]
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker, beware of the soulbreaker
Shadowmaker, shadowmaker, he writes their name
Into the dust of their bones

(Ally to the undertaker)
(Beware of the soultaker)
