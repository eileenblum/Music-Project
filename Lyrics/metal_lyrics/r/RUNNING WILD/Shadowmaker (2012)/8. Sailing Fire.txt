The waves are setting rhythm
The hull' dancing left and right
So we are heading for the night
Stars are full of fire
Twinkle like precious stones
Reflecting on our "Skull and Bones"

[Pre:]
The beat of the holy sea is pounding in our hearts
A compass true and clear just right from the start

[Chorus:]
Sailing fire, the flame is burning in our hearts
Sailing fire, a guarding light just right off the dark

Icy air is drifting
Blowing just on our sails
Frozen hands claw at the rail
The hiding dark ist resting
Just underneath the keel
The peace of freedom's what we feel

[Pre:]
The beat of the holy sea is pounding in our hearts
A compass true and clear just right from the start

[Chorus:]
Sailing fire, the flame is burning in our hearts
Sailing fire, a guarding light just right off the dark

When our time has come to put our hearts to rest
The body's wrappend into the "Skull &amp; Bones" our crest
To kiss the sea

[Pre:]
The beat of the holy sea is pounding in our hearts
A compass true and clear just right from the start

[Chorus:]
Sailing fire, the flame is burning in our hearts
Sailing fire, a guarding light just right off the dark
