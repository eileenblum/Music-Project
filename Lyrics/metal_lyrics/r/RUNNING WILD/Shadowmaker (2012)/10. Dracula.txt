Midnight tolls the bell, the full moonâs glowing bright
The counts awakening, the creature of the night

[Pre:]
Oh the night, beware of the night
When there's danger in sight, beware of the night
He is out there!

The throat became so parched, longing for relief
Declining urgent needs, bringing on the grief

[Pre:]
Oh the night, beware of the night
When there's danger in sight, beware of the night
He is out there!

[Chorus:]
He spreads his wings to fly on a high and silver stream
He is the final of your dream, Dracula!
He just arises from his dark and lonely grave
He lets his longing grow to turn into its slave

[Pre:]
Oh the night, beware of the night
When there's danger in sight, beware of the night
He is out there!

[Chorus:]
He spreads his wings to fly on a high and silver stream
He is the final of your dream, Dracula!

The open window, he's gonna slide in
Innocent sleep and he's ready to bite
Sucking the blood, injecting the poison
Vitality fades to become undead

The morning breaks, sunlight is rising
The count returns to his lonely grave

The count he lays to rest now
His hunter knows what to do
To put a stake in position
He drives it through his heart now!

The counts unholyness just starts to fall apart
A tragic character with a damned but lonely heart

[Pre:]
Oh the night, beware of the night
When there's danger in sight, beware of the night
He is out there!

[Chorus:]
He spreads his wings to fly on a high and silver stream
He is the final of your dream, Dracula!

He's going to hell
Caught in his spell
He's torn apart
His broken heart
