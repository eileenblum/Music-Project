The lights went out and the gear starts humming
The air's on fire, ready to explode

[Pre:]
Adrenaline is rising high
Sorrows have been kissed goodbye
When it's coming

The bombs go "bang" and the heads start shaking
The pumping bass gonna shake the roof

[Pre:]
Adrenaline is rising high
Sorrows have been kissed goodbye
When it's coming
Electrified, just wild and free
Going round and round, the extasy

[Chorus:]
I want a piece, a piece of the action
I take a ride on dynamite
I want a piece, a piece of the action
Gimme some slice 'n' I'll take a bite (of the action)

The room gets wild and the pyros are banging
Like a hot shot bullet going across the room

[Pre:]
Adrenaline is rising high
Sorrows have been kissed goodbye
When it's coming
Electrified, just wild and free
Going round and round, the extasy

[Chorus:]
I want a piece, a piece of the action
I take a ride on dynamite
I want a piece, a piece of the action
Gimme some slice 'n' I'll take a bite (of the action)

They dance and shout 'n' the band is pumping
Everybody is up till the last encore

[Pre:]
Electrified, just wild and free
Going round and round, the extasy

[Chorus:]
I want a piece, a piece of the action
I take a ride on dynamite
I want a piece, a piece of the action
Gimme some slice 'n' I'll take a bite (of the action)
