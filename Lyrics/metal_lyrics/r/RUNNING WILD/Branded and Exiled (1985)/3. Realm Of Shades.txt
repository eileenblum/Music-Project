The night when you hear the call
From the realm of shades
You see the reaper face to face
Your mind is fading and your breath is going away
You feel free from every sway

No gods can hold you
In eternity
No rulers command
The shadows are free

Realm of shades, the land of the damned
Realm of shades, it will always expand
Realm of shades, the empire of the night
Realm of shades, breading its might

The empire of delivered souls arises in the dark
The realm where everyone has got the mark
Living free with no rules and laws the host of the wise
We bored of whole world's lies

No gods can hold you
In eternity
No rulers command
The shadows are free

Realm of shades, the land of the damned
Realm of shades, it will always expand
Realm of shades, the empire of the night
Realm of shades, breading its might
