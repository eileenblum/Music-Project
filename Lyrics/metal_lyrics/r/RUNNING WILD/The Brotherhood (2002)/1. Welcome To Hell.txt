I, I bid you welcome
On earth, this maltreated place
Home, home of destruction
Facing insanities' trace
Money, money's the idol
The altar, holy icon of man
Facing the truth of a place you never should be
Here comes the warning, the warning you get for free

Welcome, welcome, welcome to hell
Demons' terror is waving its spell
Welcome, welcome, welcome to hell
Visions, nightmares are fit to tell, welcome to hell

Souls feeding the gear
Victims of obedient trust
Slaves working their ass off
Reward, to bite the dust

[Pre...]

Say, say farewell
Flee, rushing headlong fast

[Pre &amp; Chorus...]
