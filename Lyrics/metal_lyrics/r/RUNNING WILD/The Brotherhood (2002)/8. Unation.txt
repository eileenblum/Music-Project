We are the riders, facing the storm
Conviction guides us, taking the scorn
Denying the yes-man, never being the fool
Longing for freedom, our aim is true

We are so loaded, holding the flame
Screaming in anger, our rights to claim

Heeding our call
We are too proud we want it all
Never give in

Strong and proud we'll survive the grief
Scream and shout for what we believe

Tipping the scales, never biting our tongue
Freedom is calling, the heart of the young

[Pre...]

We are the riders, facing the storm
Conviction guides us, taking the scorn
Denying the yes-man, never being the fool
Longing for freedom, our aim is true

[Pre &amp; Chorus...]

Fist up high, freedom to defend
Dark to deny, unation stands
