Cold and rapacious we rule it all
The demon crushing your chest

We watch your despair, your struggle of life
We bet on who's coming best

Increasing our fortune, choking your breath
Living on our Cockaigne
We steal from the poor to feed on the rich
With caviar, diamonds, champagne

We are sucking your life and your blood

War, the bloody lucrative tool
To work on your doubts and fear
Gold, we sold our souls onto
The greedy and cold profiteer

Ruling the world with a stick and a carrot
Slavery's our believe
Juggle with intrigues, justice is blind
Never giving reprieve

Brothers in arms, your arm feels the needle
The poison injecting the fear
We render homage to the evil inside us
The demon, the cold profiteer

[Pre...]

[Chorus...]

We take what we get to get what it takes
To work on your doubts and fear
"Gimme the headline, I'll give you the war"
The greedy and cold profiteer
