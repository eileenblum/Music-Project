Fighting on the TV, the trench war is on
The host is getting greedy, the viewers having fun
Kain is slaying Abel, with words below the belt
Insult lives in the fable, no truth would ever help

Hysteria is on
One day hero
Stripped down to the bone
Reduced to zero

Soulstrippers, triumph on high
Soulstrippers, truth and a lie
Soulstrippers, being a star
Soulstrippers, feathered and tarred

Fasten your seatbelt for a heavy 'tour de force'
Where respect is never spelled, audacity sets the course

[Pre &amp; Chorus...]
