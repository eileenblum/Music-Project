[Bonus track]

Glaring lights are hot burning out the day
First riff to crack your bones, a treatment all the way
Bass is roaring low, pounding on your chest
Drums are hammering, the band is hitting gas

Roaring sounds are high shaking all the ground
Tubes are running hot all systems getting loud

Firing, loudness, blasting through my bones
Spiritual, healing ceremony on its own

Gonna riding high I'm alive not dead
Gonna testify what my freedom's at
Powerride

Flames and flashes burst, pyrotechnics high
Smoke and heat is on, sorrows gonna die
The crowd is "Running Wild", screaming to the top
Masses moving fast, bouncing wild and hop

[Pre...]

Glaring lights are hot burning out the day
First riff to crack your bones, a treatment all the way
Bass is roaring low, pounding on your chest
Drums are hammering, the band is hitting gas

[Pre &amp; Chorus...]
