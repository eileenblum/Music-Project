In the crossfire between wrong or right
Caught the fine line between madness and pride
In the darkness when the fight begins

All alone a stand has to be made
Putting in action what has been said
Proof it deeply proof it straight
In the end now the deuce must be paid

Don't try to run before you walk
You have to think before you talk
C'mon and open up your mind
Before the truth walks out of sight

All your life thru they teach you right from wrong
Can you trust 'em? Or is the truth yet gone?
In the darkness when the fight begins
Your soul's telling virtue from sin

[Chorus...]

Is the truth out there? Or is it still inside?
Who teach you wrong from right?
Who teach you dark from light? YOU!

All is one - one is all
Consideration, the universal call
Try to find out which way is your heart
Is it peaceful or is it caught in dark?

[Chorus...]
