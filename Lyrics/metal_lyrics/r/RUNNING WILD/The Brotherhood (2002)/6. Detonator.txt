Getting loaded, the heat is on
A bomb exploded, I'm getting hun
The body's raging, well, I see red
No more caging, 'til the hunger's fed

Words of thunder, storm breaks loose
Now, going under, no way to move
I'm a flash of lightning, cracking to the ground
The heat is melting, release is found

T.N.T. is the deepest part of me
Dynamite, the stuff to get it right
Detonator

I smash your mirror, saw the truth behind
Gone to zero, I'm not blind
Toxic terror, that's what you are
Insulting error has gone to far

[Pre &amp; Chorus...]

Getting loaded, the heat is on
A bomb exploded, I'm getting hun
The body's raging, well, I see red
No more caging, 'til the hunger's fed

[Pre &amp; Chorus...]
