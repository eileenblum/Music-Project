Rising the flag on the masthead
The sails and the ropes' holding tight
The gunners are eager to fire
Well prepared for the fight

Fight, flee or surrender
Defeat you can't deny
Better give up in the first place
Or drown in the blink of an eye

Gold, jewels and diamonds
The price we'll have to claim
Noble rogues are standing
We'll never quit in the game

We gonna ride the sea, we pray to the wind and the glory
That's why we are raging wild and free

Come sing along in the pirate song
Hail to the wind, hooray to the glory
We're gonna fight 'til the battle's won
On the raging sea

No way to move your deadlocked
Nailed down by feu-eclair
Lead is carrying fire
Victory's noble and fair

[Pre &amp; Chorus...]
