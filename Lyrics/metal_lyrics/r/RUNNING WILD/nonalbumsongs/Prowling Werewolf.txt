[Verse 1:]
Can't you see the hungry Werewolf
Lurking in the darkness.
(going depth) the greedy nightmare
(a creature anywhere).

Blackened shadow at your back,
Assassin running faster.
He is out to find the victim
Satisfy his Master!

[Bridge:]
Better beware - better watch out.
Better beware - the clock strikes twelve!
Better beware - better watch out.
Better take care - of yourself!

[Chorus:]
Prowling Werewolf - of the night.
Prowling Werewolf - (out to) your side.
Prowling Werewolf - at your back.
Prowling Werewolf - on attack!

[Verse 2:]
(try angle dream),
(upcoming friend the ...).
(outbound the scream deny),
But in the end he lose (his fight).

Conspiracy and slavery
Are written in the prophecy.
Waiting (on) the hungry (flame),
(trying) to, to end the game.

[Bridge:]
Better beware - better watch out.
Better beware - the clock strikes twelve!
Better beware - better watch out.
Better take care - of yourself!

[Chorus:]
Prowling Werewolf - of the night.
Prowling Werewolf - (out to) your side.
Prowling Werewolf - at your back.
Prowling Werewolf - on attack!

[Solo]

Yeah!!!

[Verse 1 (repeat):]
Can't you see the hungry Werewolf
Lurking in the darkness.
(going depth) the greedy nightmare
(a creature anywhere).

Blackened shadow at your back,
Assassin running faster.
He is out to find the victim
Satisfy his Master!

[Bridge:]
Better beware - better watch out.
Better beware - the clock strikes twelve!
Better beware - better watch out.
Better take care - of yourself!

[Chorus (2x):]
Prowling Werewolf - of the night.
Prowling Werewolf - (out to) your side.
Prowling Werewolf - at your back.
Prowling Werewolf - on attack!
