[Verse 1:]
Riding the storm wind, carrying the depth.
Smashing the Evil, taking his breath.
Invisible powers bringing the end,
Trying the fire â time to defend.

[Chorus:]
Invisible nightmare â the torture on high,
Apocalyptic Horsemen â riding on fire!
Apocalyptic Horsemen â rising the explodes pyre!

[Verse 2:]
(... that riders, timing the shape).
The (dawn) of his arrow â carrying in fate.
Even in shadows, (staging) the poor.
The final justice, that comes after all.

[Chorus:]
Invisible nightmare â the torture on high,
Apocalyptic Horsemen â riding on fire!
Apocalyptic Horsemen â rising the explodes pyre!
Apocalyptic Horsemen â riding on fire!
Apocalyptic Horsemen â rising the explodes pyre!

[Solo]

[Verse 3:]
(eating) your money, (eating) your gold.
Paid (... is near), like it was cold.
The seven (plants) crossing the (men),
The Devil's eye, that (dare) for men.

[Chorus:]
Invisible nightmare â the torture on high,
Apocalyptic Horsemen â riding on fire!
Apocalyptic Horsemen â rising the explodes pyre!
Apocalyptic Horsemen â riding on fire!
Apocalyptic Horsemen â rising the explodes pyre!
