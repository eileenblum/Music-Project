The sky is turning dark, horizon deep in black
The flag is turning red, so feel the reaper's trap

[Pre:]
Bad news on the wind, the calm before the storm
Cold sweat on your skin, cause the bell calls alarm

[Chorus:]
Black skies, red flag, so hear the reaper's calling
Thunder, lightning, all hell is breaking loose
Black skies, jet black, so fear the reaper's calling
Hunter's striking, your hand is on the loose 

Hell is on, courage gone
Thunder all around
Cannons crack, rip the deck
Shoot you to the ground

Fight or flee, ain't no spree
No prisoners allowed
Flag is red, turn your black
Survivors will be drowned

[Pre / Chorus]
