Like a rolling tank, the engine to crank
Unwavering on your way
"A song and a dance", ain't no chance
You wanna rock out your day

[Pre:]
You wanna shout it all out: all night long!
You wanna keep it real loud: alright!

[Chorus:]
Stick to your guns, fist up high
Stick to your guns, and don't let go
Stick to your guns

A pumping fist, studs on your wrist
Your colours show who you are
You gird your loins and your buddy joins
A fight in a musical war

[Pre / Chorus]
