Transformation of the soul, clicks and likes the highest goal
Illusions turning into truth, put a spell right on the youth
Mobbing just creates despair, the smell of sulphur in the air
Trivialize the meanest act, criminals right on the attack

Riding on a wind of change, golden shackles 'til the grave
Fallen to a world of lies, to become a slave will be the price

[Pre:]
Wold of illusion, lies and confusion
The "beast" is talking, while the devil's walking

[Chorus:]
Lies are blinding, pictures lying
Truth is dying, bounded and hellectrified

666 is what you use
You're finding lies where you look for truth
The "beast" is rising, talking well
Absorption in the name of hell

[Pre / Chorus]
