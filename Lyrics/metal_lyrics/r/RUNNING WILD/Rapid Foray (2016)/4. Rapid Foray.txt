We hit the sea, wild for action
We wanna ride the daring waves
A fair wind, great expectations
Out for glorious raids

Setting gear, pick up speed now
We're gliding on side by side
Catching up with their prow
Cannon's fire will make it right

[Pre:]
Frenzied and determined we fire all guns at once
Ship is changing hands now, a precise clockwork that runs

[Chorus:]
We're on a rapid foray
We know when the timing's right
We hit and run fast as lightning
Fortune on our side, oh oh
Fortune on our side, oh oh

Boarding now, we take all over
Gold, jewels and diamonds too
We live our life way of the rover
A wild storm right on you

[Pre / Chorus]

The hourglass is running so fast
Victory is oh so plain
A real blast from the past
A rapid foray once again

[Pre / Chorus]
