A prophecy of ancient times written in the sky
The moon is bathed in deepest red, universal cry
Foretelling what he future brings, a coup d'etat and war
A radical change in history, revolution in the raw

We look upon a changing world, suffering's all around
Deception right on the agenda, veracity's on the ground

[Pre:]
A bloody moon so big and bright, the horizon deep in red
Impending war written in the sky, words of death and dread

[Chorus:]
Blood-moon rising, the herald of the change to come
Blood-moon rising, foreboding there's no place to run

Fire, water, earth and wind, the elements on war
The earth will just defend herself, a universal law

[Pre / Chorus]

If you don't believe the words you hear
See, war is everywhere!

[Pre / Chorus]
