Life is hard, to get it right it ain't easy
Desperation's in your heart
You need relief, so bang your head and feel the music
Well it's time about to start, get up

Head up high, you shout it out, your fist is rising
Your heart is pounding with the beat

[Pre:]
Pulse rate is rising high
No, no compromising

[Chorus:]
Like thunder from the mountains
Like a storm from the sea
Like the power of an earthquake
Shaking up the street
Yes, rock'n'roll is equal
When adrenaline is high
Feel the rush by the blood in your heart, get up

Volume's high, you feel the noise electrifying
The blood is pumping in your veins
It is real, your feel, there's no denying
Your way of shaking off the chains

[Pre / Chorus]
