Born for greed, the devil's seed, a demon in your soul
Money-bound, you're losing ground, a tank out of control
Trading war, mendacious law, creating all that grief
You don't care, it's all a ware, the pay is your belief

[Pre:]
Into the fire, wretched liar

[Chorus:]
Warmongers, you lie and cheat on hate and greed
Warmongers, the demon in a shell
Warmongers, you hide the truth, you fake the news
Warmongers, you kiss the flames of hell

Children die, mothers cry, its all the same to you
Unimpressed, no second guess, 'bout the evil that you do

[Pre / Chorus]

Weapon trade, terror faked, you set the world on fire
But punishment will set an end, to atrocities, you liar

[Pre / Chorus]
