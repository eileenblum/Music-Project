Born in Wales, becoming a mate
1719 the year of his fate
His ship is seized, "Davis" is on
Becoming a pirate, his past is gone

Relentless in fight,
the crew's hold and guiding light
Bravery's first
and the trading ship is cursed

Black Bart at war with the world
Black Heart, embracing the curse
He's riding the wind or the edge of the storm
The storm before the calm
Black Bart

When Davis dies he is the man,
"Roberts" the captain, lord of the clan
"Royal fortune" becoming his pride,
"Nomen est omen" superior in fight

Relentless in fight,
the crew's hold and guiding light
Bravery's first
and the trading ship is cursed

Black Bart at war with the world
Black Heart, embracing the curse
He's riding the wind or the edge of the storm
The storm before the calm
Black Bart

On "Cape Lopez" the "Swallow" is near,
hangover in blood, setting the gear
The mariner fights, firing a round,
"Roberts" is dead, finally drowned

Relentless in fight,
the crew's hold and guiding light
Bravery's first
and the trading ship is cursed

Black Bart at war with the world
Black Heart, embracing the curse
He's riding the wind or the edge of the storm
The storm before the calm
Black Bart
