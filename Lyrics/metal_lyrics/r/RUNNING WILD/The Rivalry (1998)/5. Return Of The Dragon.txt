[Rolf Kasparek]

Only when the last dragonslayer has been layed by the heels
And his demonic soul is melting in the holy flames of eternal truth
The dragon's kingdom will return to free the enslaved soul from his shackles of hate
That will be the time, when the Serpent loses its tongue and its head!!

The kiss of the Serpent brings darkness and torment
They fight the defender with treason and slander
Seducing to blindness, souls getting mindless
They're slaying the dragon, the're hunting the pagan

When the unerring law of the dragon returns, to wipe away all the pain
The Serpent is banned and the soulless will burn, the root of all evil to tame

No resurrection with evil's attraction
Denying its spell, might save you from hell

When the unerring law of the dragon returns, to wipe away all the pain
The Serpent is banned and the soulless will burn, the root of all evil to tame

The death of all badness brings the end of all madness
Misleading liars, they will burn in the fires

When the unerring law of the dragon returns, to wipe away all the pain
The Serpent is banned and the soulless will burn, the root of all evil to tame
