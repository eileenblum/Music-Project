1714 that was the year
The Spanish fleet ran out of luck
The weather was stormy, the sea was lashing
Furious lightning and thunderstruck

Three hundred men
Fighting hand in hand
Abandonment or raid
Tons of 'pieces of eight'

The 'Flotilla' was driven down to the reefs
The wooden hulls of the vessels were cracked
300 000 'pieces of eight'
The fleet of that year was totally wrecked

Three hundred men
Fighting hand in hand
Abandonment or raid
Tons of 'pieces of eight'

The viceroy commanded to furnish a squad
60 soldiers to dreg up the plate
Took all their salvage to a small camp ashore
Lack of suspicion, no thought of a raid
Jennings came up with a hazardous plan
The Spanish garrison was taken by guise
Three sailing vessels, three hundred men
300 000 their glittering prize

Three hundred men
Fighting hand in hand
Abandonment or raid
Tons of 'pieces of eight'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The Spanish plate hauled off by raid
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Jennings' trick a painful kick

During their escape they happened to spy
A gorgeous spanish merchant ship
'In for a penny, in for a pound'
They got them in their steely grip
And several thousand 'pieces of eight'
To fill their ships up to the deck
Jennings' fleet sailed out to sea
No one ever found his track

Three hundred men
Fighting hand in hand
Abandonment or raid
Tons of 'pieces of eight'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The Spanish plate hauled off by raid
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Jennings' trick a painful kick
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Impudent tries will win the prize
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No soldier pack will find his track
