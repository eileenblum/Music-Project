Squire Trelawny and Dr. Livesay having asked me, Jim Hawkins,
to tell everybody the whole tale about the 'Island',
Flint's treasure and Mr. Silver.
Keeping nothing back but its position and that only,
because the major part of the treasure has not been lifted yet.
I personally think we would never have begun this adventure
and set course with the 'Hispaniola', if we had known
what would happen and that some of us would never return,
having lost their lives. Sometimes the whole story haunts to my dreams
and brings me the worst nightmares I ever had.
That's when I hear the cries of the fallen,
the waves pounding the rocks on the coast and Captain Flint's
raw voice screaming: 'Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Hahahah!'.
And I tell you, no oxen and wain ropes will ever take me
back to 'Treasure Island'!!!

Mr. Bones is fighting 'Black Dog'
He wants to split him to the chine
'Blind Pew' the bringer of the spot
Horse-hooves trampling his spine
We have the map to start our trip
The 'Squire' has the ship and the sailors
'Long John' is the man with the grip
No one knows he will raid us

The yell of the slain
The waves on the rocks
Captain Flint's raising hell
He's calling my name
To drive me insane

Treasure Island
Where the brave fell
A one-legged devil
From the pit of hell
A greedy demon on his treasury
Cursed the island, oh, eternally

'Long John' is spreading his law
Hatching a death bringing plot
I show up in a council of war
What I heard in the barrel from this toad

The yell of the slain
The waves on the rocks
Captain Flint's raising hell
He's calling my name
To drive me insane
But I'll never return to

Treasure Island
Where the brave fell
A one-legged devil
From the pit of hell
A greedy demon on his treasury
Cursed the island, oh, eternally

We see the land, shining sand
But it can be our grave
I jump the boat, overload
Trying to be too brave
Burning sun, find 'Ben Gunn'
Assassins claim the ship
I cut the rope, I try to cope
To free it from 'Hand's' grip

Pulling row, cannon law
The jolly-boats last trip
Killing tried, stockade fight
'Silver's' villains quit
Abandonment, to 'Silver's' hand
A cunning pact is made
Trick or treat, make scoundrels
Bleed, their dullness will be paid

I stumble to the stockade
The sweat drips from my brow
No one keeps a lookout, oh no!
The rabble owns it now
'Silver' tries to shield me
The 'Black spot' comes again
He throws the map onto the ground
He plays a tricky game

Pickaxe, rope and shovel
The dead-man marks the way
No chest, no gold, no silver
2 guineas is their pay
Musket cracks like thunder
The blood is running red
'Ben Gunn' kept the treasure
From the beginning to the end

When we put back to the sea
'Silver's' chains are doubly tight
'Long John' and his counterfeit key
Sidle away into the night

The yell of the slain
The waves on the rocks
Captain Flint's raising hell
He's calling my name
To drive me insane
But I'll never return to

Treasure Island
Where the brave fell
A one-legged devil
From the pit of hell
A greedy demon on his treasury
Cursed the island, oh, eternally

Treasure Island
Where the brave fell
A one-legged devil
From the pit of hell
A greedy demon on his treasury
Cursed the island, oh, eternally
