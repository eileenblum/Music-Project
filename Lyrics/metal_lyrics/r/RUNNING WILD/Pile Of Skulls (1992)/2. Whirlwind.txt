Thundering foam that hits the keel
Like powder blazed by flints
The figure-head is riding high
With his face right to the wind
The hull that creaks in every joint
Is hammering the sea
Determined it will ride the main
It will last eternally

It rips the wild and stormy sea
Like a heavy charge of pride
Hook and eye are moved by storm
The ropes are holding tight
The rudder's beating left and right
The ship's in seasaw motion
The proudness of a majesty
Is banning all devotion

Like a whirlwind
Rushing over the sea
Like a whirlwind
Blowing fast, blowing free
Like a whirlwind
A raving storm in the night
Like a whirlwind
Going mad, going wild

Thundering foam that hits the keel
Like powder blazed by flints
The figure-head is riding high
With his face right to the wind
The hull that creaks in every joint
Is hammering the sea
Determined it will ride the main
It will last eternally

Like a whirlwind
Rushing over the sea
Like a whirlwind
Blowing fast, blowing free
Like a whirlwind
A raving storm in the night
Like a whirlwind
Going mad, going wild
Like a whirlwind
Like a whirlwind
Like a whirlwind
Like a whirlwind
