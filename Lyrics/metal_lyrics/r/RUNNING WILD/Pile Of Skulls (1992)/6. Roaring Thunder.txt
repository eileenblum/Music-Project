You rule the world, but we don't care
You don't impress, whatever you dare
We hate your vileness, enough of your lies
Flame to our anger, you'll pay the price

Your fate is sealed without a doubt
Verdict guilty, no way out
Trick or treat is what they play
The hand of doom will have its way

Roaring thunder, the hearts of man, your five-star meal
Roaring thunder, you wrecked the car, so hands off the wheel

You pollute the world with your snake-talk tongue
We'll never give up until you're gone
You squeeze us out, you rape the earth
Pour recklessness, there's nothing worse

Your fate is sealed without a doubt
Verdict guilty, no way out
Trick or treat is what they play
The hand of doom will have its way

Roaring thunder, the hearts of man, your five-star meal
Roaring thunder, you wrecked the car, so hands off the wheel

Predaciousness, to fill up your lair
We know the truth, tho' you're not aware
A darkened power grabs your throat
No time for mercy, 'cause you've sunk the boat

Your fate is sealed without a doubt
Verdict guilty, no way out
Trick or treat is what they play
The hand of doom will have its way

Roaring thunder, the hearts of man, your five-star meal
Roaring thunder, you wrecked the car, so hands off the wheel
Roaring thunder, lightning strikes when the youth stands tight
Roaring thunder, fist up high show no respite
