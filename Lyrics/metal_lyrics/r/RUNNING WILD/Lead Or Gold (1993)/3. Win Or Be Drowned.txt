Like soldiers of fortune, we're cruising the sea
Against all odds, with the urge to be free
We're longing for freedom, like an animal that's chained
We're thirsty for justice, like a flower that's drained

Win or be drowned, so fight hard
Win or be drowned, like a wild shark
Win or be drowned, so stand tight
Win or be drowned, freedoms fight

Slave - drivers hunted, our cannons will speak
A frightening terror for the profit they seek
Like sea - cruising phantoms, on the breath of the sea
We are foiling their plans, hooked, they can't flee

Win or be drowned, so fight hard
Win or be drowned, like a wild shark
Win or be drowned, so stand tight
Win or be drowned, freedoms fight

We're still full of pride, we are fighting for life
For independence we're struggling, we've got to survive
We're longing for freedom, like an animal that's chained
We're thirsty for justice, like a flower that's drained

Win or be drowned, so fight hard
Win or be drowned, like a wild shark
Win or be drowned, so stand tight
Win or be drowned, freedoms fight
Win or be drowned, so fight hard
Win or be drowned, like a wild shark
Win or be drowned, so stand tight
Win or be drowned, freedoms fight.
