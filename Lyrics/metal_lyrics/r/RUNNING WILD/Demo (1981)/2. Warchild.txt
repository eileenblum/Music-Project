Shit on the law, he has to fight his war
He's a rough child, dirty and wild
He fights on the streets and gets what he needs
His friend is a knife, that's why he's still alive

Warchild, warchild, warchild, warchild

Never been on his knees, can't believe in peace
Fourteen year old boy, society's toy
Cops are playing their game,
Bullets coming like rain
The blood's running wild,
The blood of a young child he dies

Warchild, warchild, warchild, warchild

Warchild, warchild, warchild, warchild
Warchild, warchild, warchild, warchild
Warchild yeah
