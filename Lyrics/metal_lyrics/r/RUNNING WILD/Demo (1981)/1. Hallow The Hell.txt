Can you see the black night?
Can you see the dark light?
Your mind is bright

Fear is all around
They're all falling down
On their knees

'Cause they all know, that heaven had to go
You can be so low, in our show
They all know, that heaven had to go,
In our show

Hallow the hell, that's all we want to tell
Hallow the hell, that's all we want to tell

You can't be so blind
That you can't see the sign
On our faces
We are the best
????
He is the pest

'Cause they all know, that heaven had to go
You can be so low, in our show
They all know, that heaven had to go,
In our show

Hallow the hell, that's all we want to tell
Hallow the hell, that's all we want to tell
