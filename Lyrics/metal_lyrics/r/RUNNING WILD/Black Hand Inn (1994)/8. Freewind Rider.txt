The howling wildwind blows, eternal freedom calls
Its soul is running free from care
Its spirit's wild and free flowing in the wind
The taste of freedom's in the air

The hooves are pounding fast, kicking up the dust
Horse breath is panting really hard
The black horse rears up, its mane is flying high
Braveness and truth is in its heart

Call of the wild, soul's running free
Call of the heart, desire to flee

Freewind rider, its mane is waving in the wind
Freewind rider, no chains could hold it down again
Yes, it comes alive, riding the badlands without end
Freewind rider, its soul is flowing in the wind

Freedom and solitude are flowing through its heart
To free its soul from binding chains
The stallion's running fast right into the sun
The blood is pumping in its veins

Call of the wild, soul's running free
Call of the heart, desire to flee

Freewind rider, its mane is waving in the wind
Freewind rider, no chains could hold it down again
Yes, it comes alive, riding the badlands without end
Freewind rider, its soul is flowing in the wind

Mother earth and father wind
Its spirit's running free
If chains would hold it, it would die
Where ever it may be

The howling wildwind blows, eternal freedom calls
Its soul is running free from care
Its spirit's wild and free flowing in the wind
The taste of freedom's in the air

Call of the wild, soul's running free
Call of the heart, desire to flee

Freewind rider, its mane is waving in the wind
Freewind rider, no chains could hold it down again
Yes, it comes alive, riding the badlands without end
Freewind rider, its soul is flowing in the wind
