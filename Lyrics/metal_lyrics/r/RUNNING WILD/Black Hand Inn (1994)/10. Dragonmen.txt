Flying shields across the sky, the dragon's firebreathing
Metallic wagon rides the wind, blinding lights releasing
A stirring phenomenon is lighting up the darkened sky
Magnetic stream on the soil, a whirring sound when dragons fly

They ride the wind on metallic wings
Envoys of the invisible council
At the speed of light, lighting up the night
Watching where the evil will break through

Piktograms have spread the word, unadulterated truth
Rediscovered holy laws, man's honesty to prove

They ride the wind on metallic wings
Envoys of the invisible council
At the speed of light, lighting up the night
Watching where the evil will break through

The holy dragonmen, trailblazers of a new age
Riding the universe to force the evil to its cage
The holy dragonmen, watching the fallen soul
Roaming eternity to save the truth, the highest goal

The holy dragonpaths, flowing streams of energy
The breath of life is in its veins, where the spirit's running free
Dragonmen will bring the truth, ancient wisdom on their mind
The untruth's the easier way, is truth made for mankind?

They ride the wind on metallic wings
Envoys of the invisible council
At the speed of light, lighting up the night
Watching where the evil will break through

The holy dragonmen, trailblazers of a new age
Riding the universe to force the evil to its cage
The holy dragonmen, watching the fallen soul
Roaming eternity to save the truth, the highest goal

Flying shields across the sky, the dragon's firebreathing
Metallic wagon rides the wind, blinding lights releasing
A stirring phenomenon is lighting up the darkened sky
Magnetic stream on the soil, a whirring sound when dragons fly

They ride the wind on metallic wings
Envoys of the invisible council
At the speed of light, lighting up the night
Watching where the evil will break through

The holy dragonmen, trailblazers of a new age
Riding the universe to force the evil to its cage
The holy dragonmen, watching the fallen soul
Roaming eternity to save the truth, the highest goal
