One night they see light,
Horizon is filled up with flames
Destroying all the towns
They left only dead and empty plains

Invaders are coming from space
To destroy the whole human race
Fire on the cities bringing death onto the world

They're coming to reign with power to scare
They're coming to drive away the warpigs and their rules
They're coming tonight to make the world alright

Iron Heads from the universe

Ruins are everywhere, the whole world is empty and dead
No plains and oceans, pollution and warheads anymore

Invaders are coming from space to destroy the whole human race
Fire on the cities bringing death onto the world

Iron Heads from the universe
