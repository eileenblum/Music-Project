Warriors of the street
Wanna beat their enemies
The shark's broke the truce
Tonight's the night, who'll win who'll lose

This is not your turf
Unarmed you just die first
Ruthless they fight their fight
To defend their walls feeds their pride

Senseless massacre tonight
Kid kills kid in this riot
The rulers don't want to care
Deaf and blind hiding in their lair

War in the gutter, fight!

Watch out!

Gunshell, shotgun
You have to fight or run
The kids fight tonight
Who knows who's wrong, who's right

Shining blade, a yell
Running blood, a kid fell
He's so surprised
He dies in the gutter another wasted life

Senseless massacre tonight
Kid kills kid in this riot
The rulers don't want to care
Deaf and blind hiding in their lair

War in the gutter, fight!
