Blood, blood, bloody night
The poor stand up and fight
Marquises, kings and all this vermin
Hunted up in burning streets

Fight, fight, fight with rage
Their menials are locked up in a cage
The spirit of the rebel lives
Determined to break free

We stand up to break our chains
Rulers beware
We'll take your scepter and reign
On beggar's night

Riot terminates our pain
We'll catch you in your lair
You have to pay for your blame
On beggar's night

Sin, sin, whip and chain
That's the way they live and reign
Too many people died in their dungeon
Now pain's too hard if it's for their profit

Beast, beast, go away
No reason why you have to stay
The wealth you squeezed out of our lives
Will become your tomb

We stand up to break our chains
Rulers beware
We'll take your scepter and reign
On beggar's night

Riot terminates our pain
We'll catch you in your lair
You have to pay for your blame
On beggar's night
