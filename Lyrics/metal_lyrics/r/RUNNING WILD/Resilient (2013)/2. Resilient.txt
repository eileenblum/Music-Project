Premonition's creeping up on me
I am just right in a storm
Shifty tricks and hostility
Really can't do me no harm
Temptations are everywhere
To switch off your mind
Contemptuous lies are in the air
The pure and the true to grind

There's no hiding - it just won't go away
So keep on fighting to foil their plans
Madness is rising - slaves are marching on
The free are striding to shake off the trance

Resilient  (Resilient ) - We resist till the end
We're taking our pride in the rage of the fight
So we're gonna take our stand - we gonna stay resilient

Resource management in control
They won't just take a bite
Not your body - they want your soul
But we gonna give 'em a fight

There's no hiding - it just won't go away
So keep on fighting to foil their plans
Madness is rising - slaves are marching on
The free are striding to shake off the trance

Resilient  (Resilient ) - We resist till the end
We're taking our pride in the rage of the fight
So we're gonna take our stand - we gonna stay resilient

And I always will defend what I'm believing in
I am never giving in - standing proud till the end

Despair and apathy - everywhere - surrounding me
Resignation and frustration - everywhere - got a hold on thee

There's no hiding - it just won't go away
So keep on fighting to foil their plans
Madness is rising - slaves are marching on
The free are striding to shake off the trance

Resilient  (Resilient ) - We resist till the end
We're taking our pride in the rage of the fight
So we're gonna take our stand - we gonna stay resilient
