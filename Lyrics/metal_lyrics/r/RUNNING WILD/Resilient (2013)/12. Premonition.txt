[Limited Edition Bonus Track]Oh a chain reaction world warÂ´s on
No protection from a raging gun

Dust is falling on the eerie scene
Man is choking silent scream

The worldÂ´s on fire oceans vaporize
The green is wilting flames will touch the skies

Premonition time is running out
Demolition itÂ´s hell without a doubt

Unknown virus skin turns black
Devious life form right on the track

The worldÂ´s on fire oceans vaporize
The green is wilting flames will touch the skies

Premonition time is running out
Demolition itÂ´s hell without a doubt

ManÂ´s achievements just fade away
Another stone age another day

The worldÂ´s on fire oceans vaporize
The green is wilting flames will touch the skies

Premonition time is running out
Demolition itÂ´s hell without a doubt
Wrong decision failure all the way
Supervision protectorate will come and stay
Come and stay walk away huh huh
