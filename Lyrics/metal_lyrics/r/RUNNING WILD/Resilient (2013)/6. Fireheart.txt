You're a wildchild 
Freeride on the wings that take you high
They can't chain you 
You stay cool by the freedom in your heart

C'mon and take a ride on the fireside

Fireheart - no matter what is coming
Fireheart - you always stand your ground
Fireheart - no evading and no running
There's no hide - oh yes you stride 
'cause you're a Fireheart

Highly persistent defence
You're proud and you're loud
You are headstrong - Resist long
what they try to put on you

C'mon and take a ride on the fireside

Fireheart - no matter what is coming
Fireheart - you always stand your ground
Fireheart - no evading and no running
There's no hide - oh yes you stride 
'cause you're a Fireheart
