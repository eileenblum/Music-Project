[Limited Edition Bonus Track]You indulge your pet whim big time
YouÂ´re a jumpinÂ´ Jack straight all the way
YouÂ´d climb the highest mountain to cash in all the day
Dirty mind clean suit and tie artificial smile to hide your lies
Neck deep youÂ´re in corruption the dirt jsu testifies

When there is smoke thereÂ´s fire
Where fire is thereÂ´s heat
In the heat you smell the pyre
Underneath your feet

YouÂ´re living on payola and shenanigans dervish dance
A four leaf clover in the devilÂ´s oww hands
YouÂ´re slipping over to the other side devilÂ´s child
Stored in the black book where achivements are filed

On your way youÂ´ll stop at nothing
YouÂ´re deserving one but you take six
A deeper sense behind it three times it spells your fix

When there is smoke thereÂ´s fire
Where fire is thereÂ´s heat
In the heat you smell the pyre
Underneath your feet

YouÂ´re living on payola and shenanigans dervish dance
A four leaf clover in the devilÂ´s own hands
YouÂ´re slipping over to the other side devilÂ´s child
Stored in the black book where achivements are filed

When there is smoke thereÂ´s fire
Where fire is thereÂ´s heat
In the heat you smell the pyre
Underneath your feet 
And I donÂ´t give a damn huh huh

YouÂ´re living on payola and shenanigans dervish dance
A four leaf clover in the devilÂ´s own hands
YouÂ´re slipping over to the other side devilÂ´s child
Stored in the black book where achivements are filed
Oh oh oh youÂ´re living on payola and shenanigans dirty hands
