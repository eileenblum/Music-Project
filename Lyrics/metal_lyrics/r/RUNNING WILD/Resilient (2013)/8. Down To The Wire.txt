You're down out now - you rock bottown down the line
They pester on you and your foes are doing fine
The boss gripes about you - he critizises your attitude
Tearing you of a strip now - his behavior's kinda rude

World's turning black now
'cause you're down on your luck

Down to the wire - you're falling - you're falling
Down to the wire - to zero and below
You're down to the wire

Oh you're down and out

Parents on a campaign - they wanna bring you into line
Change right who you are and everything will be fine
Political correctness for grovellers all the way
Intimidation as a weapon - but don't fear to have your say

World's turning black now
'cause you're down on your luck

Down to the wire - you're falling - you're falling
Down to the wire - to zero and below
You're down to the wire

The world is going crazy - indifference's marching up
Drumbeats of a new world and goofballs doing the hop
Freedom's on the lose now - personality fades away
Monotony and correspondence - all colors turn to grey

World's turning black now
'cause you're down on your luck

Down to the wire - you're falling - you're falling
Down to the wire - to zero and below
Down to the wire - you're falling - you're falling
Down to the wire - to zero and below
You're down to the wire

Oh you're down and out
Oh you're down and out - out
