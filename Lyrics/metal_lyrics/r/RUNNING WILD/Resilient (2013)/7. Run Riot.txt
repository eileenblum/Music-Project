A weight of tons right on your back
It seems to pull you down
Still they mess around with you
Before you hit the ground
You're down and out - you hate them all
Anger spells your name
They should beware you're bursting out
Right like a hurricane

Yeah, you gotta run

C'mon you gotta run riot - timing is right tonight
So c'mon you gotta run riot - shout it out in pride - run riot
C'mon you gotta run riot - it really makes sense to me
So c'mon you gotta run riot - a natural act to be - run riot

Music turned to religion too
"The holy grail of prate"
They tell you what to listen to 
'cause they don't love they hate
They critizise and terrorize
They've really got no clue
Narrow-minded pedants rule
Culture, politics and you

Yeah, you gotta run

C'mon you gotta run riot - timing is right tonight
So c'mon you gotta run riot - shout it out in pride - run riot
C'mon you gotta run riot - it really makes sense to me
So c'mon you gotta run riot - a natural act to be - run riot

You're done with it and you've had enough
Of idiots and nonsense stuff
Creation and a trivial life
Sweetmeat and daily life
A treadmill to create distress
A New World Order? Ridiculous!
They build it up to tear it down
'cause boneheads wear its crown

Yeah, you gotta run - you gotta run

C'mon you gotta run riot - timing is right tonight
So c'mon you gotta run riot - shout it out in pride - run riot
C'mon you gotta run riot - it really makes sense to me
So c'mon you gotta run riot - a natural act to be - run riot
C'mon you gotta run riot - timing is right tonight
So c'mon you gotta run riot - shout it out in pride - run riot

You gotta run - you gotta run - you gotta run riot
