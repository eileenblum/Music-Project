Riding into the sunset
The highway is winding its way
The motor is droning
While the night is killing the day

Swallowed by the twilight
The plains are hiding left and right
The air's turning colder
Freezing, I am just caught in the ride

Well a red dressed woman - she's just coming 
Straight right out of the black
What hell of a vision - a sweet phenomenon to me

Desert Rose - a vision just next to me
Desert Rose - angel or fantasy?
Desert Rose

Her magical dark eyes
Really got a hold on me
Her contours are fading 
What the hell do I see

Well a red dressed woman - she's just coming 
Straight right out of the black
What hell of a vision - a sweet phenomenon to me

Desert Rose - a vision just next to me
Desert Rose - angel or fantasy?
Desert Rose

Vision's never reccuring
To this magical place
Yes, I am always returning
But I never found any  trace

Well a red dressed woman - she's just coming 
Straight right out of the black
What hell of a vision - a sweet phenomenon to me

Desert Rose - a vision just next to me
Desert Rose - angel or fantasy?
Desert Rose - a vision just next to me
Desert Rose - angel or fantasy?
Desert Rose
