They privatize it all the way
The want control right completely
They want you body, mind and soul

They come along in suit and tie
Spitting lies

Natural right to live, to breathe and to be
Crystal Gold - they wanna dy out resistance
Resource control and the next step is your soul

The air to breathe is their next raid
You'll better pay or suffocate

Natural right to live, to breathe and to be

They're working hard on a world bust
Creating terror, fear, mistrust

Perfidious plan to hide their action
They come along in suit and tie

Natural right to live, to breathe and to be
Crystal Gold - they wanna dy out resistance
Resource control and the next step is your soul
