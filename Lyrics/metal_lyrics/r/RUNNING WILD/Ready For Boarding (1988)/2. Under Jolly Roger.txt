[Music &amp; lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

Weigh the anchor, hoist the sails
Cruisin' for booty on watery trails
No exploiter we see can still sail on
Our cannons fire till his ship goes down

Fly our flag, we teach them fear
Capture them, the end is near
Firing guns they shall burn
Surrender or fight there's no return

Under Jolly Roger

Venerable scoundrels, no blood on our hands
Our engagement are tough, but only for defence
Carefully we sail around the reefs
To force those die-hards to their knees

Fly our flag, we teach them fear
Capture them, the end is near
Firing guns they shall burn
Surrender or fight there's no return

Under Jolly Roger
