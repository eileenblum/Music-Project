[Music: Moti, Lyrics: Finlay / Moti]

Reach for the rifle - go for the gun
Saddle the beast huge load to heave
Unstoppa bullrace now begun
Cry for the slaughter who would believe

Hunting the red one - blood on their breath
Screaming horizons for clues of the kill
Blowing their own horn - stinking of death

Tally ho.

Touch of the tail but what to expect
Dog don't believe why to die for the queen
Lies to the allies - wrath with respect
Blood hounds of hades - heeding the scream

Pounding of hooves they cannot control
Mud flying high as shit hits the fan
Break for the border - the thrill of it all

Tally ho.

Clawing the reigns
Of a world gone mad treason
Breaking the chains

Death or glory - pride or pain
Breaking down the rules of greed and gain
Hunter's hounds in the hands of the hunted
Death or glory

Clawing the reigns
Of a world gone mad treason
Breaking the chains

Death or glory - pride or pain
Breaking down the rules of greed and gain
Hunter's hounds in the hands of the hunted
Death or glory

Death or glory - pride or pain
Death or glory
