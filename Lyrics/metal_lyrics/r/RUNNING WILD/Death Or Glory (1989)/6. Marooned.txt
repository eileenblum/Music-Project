[Music: Kasparek, Lyrics: Finlay / Kasparek]

Fire, fore and aft
Man the boats and put to the sea
Crashing yardarms - cries of pain
A will to live - a chance to flee
Panic on the boats to save
Stricken hands the first on board
Leading to eternal grave
Dragging down what they could hoard

Thirty days and nights have I seen the brink of death
Troubled seas - my only friend
Drag me down - gasping for breath
Cursing eternal black
Bloodied by the dogs of war
Memories come clawing back
Treasured friends - their sight no more

Eternal cruise
I feel the fires of madness
Burning holes into my wounds
This hell on earth
I feel the power of sadness
No way out - I'm marooned

Lonely this hell on earth
Demons screaming in my mind
Wading thru debris of life
A thousand souls their graves to find
Flotsam with death on board
Bodies ripped until the bone
Nothing but the sounds of time
No sign of life - am I alone?

Eternal curse
I feel the fires of madness
Burning holes into my wounds
This hell on earth
I feel the power of sadness
No way out - I'm 'marooned

Eternal curse
Could I really be stranded
Start to count 1000 moons
This hell on earth
To me the dogs have handed
No way out I'm marooned
