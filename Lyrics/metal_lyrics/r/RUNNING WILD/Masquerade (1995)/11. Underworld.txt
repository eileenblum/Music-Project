Evil souls and blackest hearts, lurking in the night
A darkened race, so mean and sly, they keep away from light
Ancient words tell dreadful tales about the other side
About its world where demons live and where the evil hides

They invade the world with war and pain to save their evil aim
Their power's built on blackest lies, but man will pay its price

Underworld, the centre of the blackest heart
Underworld, where the evil side hides in the dark

They've ruled the world through history, the lords of war and crime
Military and government, they're brought into line
Men in black, they cover up the sight of U.F.O.'s
Their power's save as long as there is no one who knows!

They invade the world with war and pain to save their evil aim
Their power's built on blackest lies, but man will pay its price

Underworld, the centre of the blackest heart
Underworld, where the evil side hides in the dark

Churches built on holy spots its energy to ban
Exposing truth, who's the church? blackest kind of men
Religion's made to obscure the mind, living on its lies
Who's the one to wear its crown? the devil! no disguise!

They invade the world with war and pain to save their evil aim
Their power's built on blackest lies, but man will pay its price

Underworld, the centre of the blackest heart
Underworld, where the evil side hides in the dark
Underworld, where laws were made to hide the truth
Underworld, where evilness and darkness rules

You have eyes to see, nevertheless you see nothing!
You have a soul to feel, nevertheless you feel nothing!
You have a mind to know, nevertheless you know nothing!

That is the way we want you to be!!! HO HO HO...
