They want you to live on their rule,
To walk just straight in the line
Big brother, so mean and so cruel,
So obey and you'll doing fine

Proud you'll be, for all the world to see
So shed off your fear if you wanna be free

They want you, working 9 to 5,
Paying your tax all the way
They don't care if you're dead or alive,
But they care what you do or say

Proud you'll be, for all the world to see
So shed off your fear if you wanna be free

The wind of freedom blows away the binding chain
Independent minds are sowing their grain
Boundless power will tear the wall apart
So don't give in be a rebel at heart

The pressure group lives on the fat,
They hate people saying the truth
They don't want people using their head,
They don't want a critical youth

Proud you'll be, for all the world to see
So shed off your fear if you wanna be free

The wind of freedom blows away the binding chain
Independent minds are sowing their grain
Boundless power will tear the wall apart
So don't give in be a rebel at heart
