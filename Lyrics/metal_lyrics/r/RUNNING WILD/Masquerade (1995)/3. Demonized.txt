Modern man is going crazy,
The whole world is going mad
The atmosphere is going hazy,
They loot the world until its dead

The hell of war that rages on,
The law of hate that's everywhere
Falling bombs a billion tons,
Plunge the world into dispair

An evil, frightening nightmare
That rules the world until the end
No change and no redemption
Will come until the evil's banned

Demonized, the machinery pollutes the air
Demonized, atomic bombs that sow dispair

Politicians rule the lie,
Misuse the law to make their pile
Corrupted whores of deepest dye,
They ruin the world, but they keep their smile

An evil, frightening nightmare
That rules the world until the end
No change and no redemption
Will come until the evil's banned

Demonized, the machinery pollutes the air
Demonized, atomic bombs that sow dispair

They invade the world with blinded rage
Revealing truth'locked to a cage
War and death their evil seed
They hold their power on dirty deeds

Religious con-men are catching souls,
Take the money that's rolling in
They cheat the world to save their goals,
Let children die while they pray and sing

An evil, frightening nightmare
That rules the world until the end
No change and no redemption
Will come until the evil's banned

Demonized, the machinery pollutes the air
Demonized, atomic bombs that sow dispair
Demonized, corrupted men that pray the lie
Demonized, they save the money let people die

"That rotten bastards!"
