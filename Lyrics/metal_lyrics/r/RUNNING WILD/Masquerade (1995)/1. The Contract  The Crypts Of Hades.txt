[Redcoat:]
"Are you willing to raise our empire of hate and evil
Onto the whole world and to deliver man and every
Living creature onto our hands?"

[The three:]
"Yes, master!"

[Redcoat:]
"Are you willing to tell man lies about world's past,
How he was made and to supress the truth for all times?"

[The three:]
"Yes, master!"

[Redcoat:]
"Are you willing to deliver your souls onto our hands
To become powerful, famous and rich?"

[The three:]
"Yes, master!"

[Redcoat:]
"Ho Ho Ho! So it shall be done!"
