Liars and deceivers
We are a thorn in their side
'Cause we are insisting on our rights
Fed up with their tutelage
Which we will overcome
We will stand, so they will run

Evil machinations
For power and for wealth
They stick at nothing for themselves
Senile and restrained
They say they know what's wrong or right
You know, true evil will never see the light

Heads or tails, which way you will choose now?
Die or live, surrender or fight?
Wild and free, together we'll stand
Strong and proud, we claim our rights

They say I am a sinner and seducer
They try to put the blame on me
Don't give a fuck for the way they see
Stand up and you'll win
Surrender and you'll lose
It's heads or tails, you have to choose

Heads or tails, which way you will choose now?
Die or live, surrender or fight?
Wild and free, together we'll stand
Strong and proud, we claim our rights
