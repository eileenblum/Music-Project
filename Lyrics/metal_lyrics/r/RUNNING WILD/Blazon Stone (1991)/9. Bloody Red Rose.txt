In the war of the roses, the tragedy source
King Edward was bound to die
Richard III the new "Lord Protector"
Ruled with "Loyalty me lie"
A vigilant guardian to the sons of the king
As sure as an eagle will fly
He died in a battle in 1485
And Henry defamed Richard with lies

Richard was charged in the "Act of Attainder"
With tyranny, murder and gain
Henry revoked the "Titulus Regulus"
With the smile of the vicious insane
Henry VII that rotten bastard
Executed the whole house of York
Elisabeth Woodville was immured for life
And Tyrrel the liar was aquitted by court

The poisoned thorns of the bloody red rose
Red venom of deepest dye
Henry the traitor, the victor by sin
Soiled Richard's blood with a grin

While Richard was ruling the boys were alive
When he died the boys disappeared
Henry killed them to get onto the throne
But the book of truth was sealed
Henry paid Tyrrel to say that he had murdered
In the name of Sir Richard the brave
Henry killed Tyrrel without any trial
So Tyrrel took the truth to his grave

The poisoned thorns of the bloody red rose
Red venom of deepest dye
Henry the traitor, the victor by sin
Soiled Richard's blood with a grin

The poisoned thorns of the bloody red rose
Red venom of deepest dye
Henry the traitor, the victor by sin
Soiled Richard's blood with a grin
