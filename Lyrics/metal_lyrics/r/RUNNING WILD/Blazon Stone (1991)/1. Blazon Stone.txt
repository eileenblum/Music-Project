Like an hawk-eyed eagle, we're cruising on our raid
Our dogged pride will never fade
Born-free we're still sailing the seven stormy seas
No-one will force us to our knees

Stand tight, we'll fight the fear and pain
United force
Blazon stone, power and hope to the slave
Blazon stone, a mascot to the tortured
Blazon stone

Break the chains of torment, madness causing pain
Can't be the fate that rules the game
Corruption, hate and treason are the evil we must fight
United we will stand the night

Stand tight, we'll fight the fear and pain
United force
Blazon stone, power and hope to the slave
Blazon stone, suppression, we'll send to its grave
Blazon stone, we spit into the face of death
Blazon stone, a mascot to the tortured
Blazon stone

They demonize our pride, blood on blood, we can't submit
We battle side by side, like a pounding ram that hits their head
Their man-o-war shall burn
Mr. Mortis reaps his seed
The point of no return
Slanderous lies we will defeat

Stand tight we'll fight the fear and pain
United force
Blazon stone, power and hope to the slave
Blazon stone, suppression we send to its grave
Blazon stone, we spit into the face of death
Blazon stone, a mascot to the tortured
Blazon stone
