Thundering cannonfire is roaring through the air
They're fighting courageous, driven by despair
Deadly muzzle flash robs them of their pride
Grapnels claw the rail, vessels're side by side

Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity

Brutes are taking over, to claim their living spoils
Cracking musketfire, until every plank is soiled
Surrender's the only way to stop this deadly raid
Bloody, fettered wrists, slavery's their fate

Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity
Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity

Slave trade still exists, it's a legacy of the past
Punishment's long overdue, to fight the scars it casts
Hard-boiled criminals, they're rotten to the core
Machinery in motion, as long as money is the law

Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity
Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity
Slavery, the pain of the sea
Slavery, inhumanity
