[Music: Rolf Kasparek, Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

[Limited Edition Bonustrack]

Sailing fast, we fly on wings
We live the sea, we play its strings
Stormy winds to lead the boat
To unknown shores to shoot our load

We stand tight in the darkest night
We will fight for freedom rise
We endure till slavery's gone
We stand proud to fight all wrong

The cry for freedom on the waves
United we stand till our graves
Riding high, the clouds rush by
Never give in, never say die

We stand tight in the darkest night
We will fight for freedom rise
We endure till slavery's gone
We stand proud to fight all wrong

Libertalia, the wild and the free
The Ideal of Freedom is ruling the sea
Libertalia, the strong and the brave
Drowning the slaver, down to its grave

The holy flag, the sign of pride
The bones are crossed, the skull is white
Standing strong for Liberty
We raise our glass, we praise the free

We stand tight in the darkest night
We will fight for freedom rise
We endure till slavery's gone
We stand proud to fight all wrong

Libertalia, the wild and the free
The Ideal of Freedom is ruling the sea
Libertalia, the strong and the brave
Drowning the slaver, down to its grave

Libertalia
Libertalia
Libertalia

The moral of the story is:
We ride free, we raise our fist

We stand tight in the darkest night
We will fight for freedom rise

Libertalia, the wild and the free
The Ideal of Freedom is ruling the sea
Libertalia, the strong and the brave
Drowning the slaver, down to its grave
