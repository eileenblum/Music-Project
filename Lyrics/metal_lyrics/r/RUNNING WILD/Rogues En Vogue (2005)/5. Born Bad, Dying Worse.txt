[Music: Rolf Kasparek]
[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

Born with that evil smile
Don't waste no time
Filling up your file
Crossing the line

Blood is your sugar poison
Filling up your soul

[Pre:]
Born liar, evil fire
Black blood is filling your veins
Born killer, life-long thriller
Counting out the men you've slain

[Chorus:]
Born bad, dying worse
Your choice, it ain't no curse
Born bad, dying worse
Hellbound, your evil thirst

Fraud and lies are your passion
You won't give it up
Maxim and not fashion
Hell fills your cup

[Chorus]
