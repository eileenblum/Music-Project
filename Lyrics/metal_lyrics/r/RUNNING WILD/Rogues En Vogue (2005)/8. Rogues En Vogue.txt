[Music: Rolf Kasparek]
[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

Once there was a promised land
Spoiled by fatal hands
It turned into a pyre
Burning high and bright

[Pre:]
World wars, crisis, famine, cashing in all along
Slaves to bloody profit, determined to do wrong

Ignorance and arrogance
Hardly find a chance
To see "the golden age"
The "chamber" is their place

[Pre]

[Chorus:]
Rogues en vogue, touching fire
Shot their load with the tongue of the liar
Rogues en vogue

The holy forces on the game
Soulless rogues deadly tamed
The "Eldest" well prepared
Returning to the stars

[Pre]
[2 x Chorus]

Into the fire's hungry flames, you're falling
To burn away your sins
R.e.v. (R.e.v.)
Into the fire's deadly flames, you're falling
Right into the void
