[Music: Rolf Kasparek]
[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

Glowing fire deep in your heart
Cry of freedom ready to start
Times of darkness pushing the line
Take a stand now right here on time

[Pre:]
These words on the wind
Revolution's back again
This time, right time

[Chorus:]
Draw the line
Draw the line
When the time is right!

Classify you and push you around
Kicking's started when you're down on the ground

[Pre]

No more self-doubt to hold you down
No more pushing when yo're standing your ground

[Pre]
[Chorus]
