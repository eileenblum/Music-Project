[Music: Rolf Kasparek]
[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

Coating evil plans in a world of shaking hands
Trying hard to feed the fire, keeping strife alive

Man kept in the dark
With the force of breaking hearts
Quarrel of every kind
To confuse and twist the mind

[Pre:]
Silver shiny wings bathed in fire
Godly weapons speak to break the chains of darkness

[Chorus:]
Angel of mercy won't you spread your wings?
Flying high on a silverclouded beam
Angel of mercy won't you cut that strings?
That feeds the dark and keeps the world in chains

Lies of deepest dye, no need to reason why
Manipulating rules, enslaving common sense
Forcing upon all man their evil bullshit then
Court jesters never reign, they die away in pain

[Pre]
[Chorus]
[Pre]
[2 x Chorus]
