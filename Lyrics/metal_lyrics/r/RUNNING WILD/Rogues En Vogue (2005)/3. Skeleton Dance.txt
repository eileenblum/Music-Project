[Music: Rolf Kasparek]
[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

In the year of global changes, harvest's fast
Ringing in the final landslide, hardest test

Overnight a sudden stormwind, blowing red
Steely titans on a mission, flinging lead

[Pre:]
Here comes the storm to bring the dawn
The end, a new beginning
To keep the world on spinning

[Chorus:]
Skeleton dance, Skeleton dance
On the wind of the final fire
Skeleton dance, Skeleton dance
On the dust of the yellow rain

The dark is hitting three-times, glowing ball
Mushrooms shoot their poison, growing tall
Fallout, falling in now, blackened skin
Sunset on devastation, devil's grin

[Pre]

The golden calf was holy, man on knees
Final at the birch tree, eternal peace

[Pre]
[2 x Chorus]

Skeleton dance, Skeleton dance
Staged by the global liar
Skeleton dance, Skeleton dance
Dreams fall to a sea of pain
