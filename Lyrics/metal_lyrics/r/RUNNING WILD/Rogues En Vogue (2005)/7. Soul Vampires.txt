[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

Lifeforce's getting sucked out like our blood
Vampires taking everything we've got
They want us to live our lifes in fear
They want us to build a perfect gear

[Pre:]
Vampires on our soul

[Chorus:]
We want it, we need it
We need revolt on holy ground
Like thunder &amp; lightning
No chains or boundaries hold us down

Playing games with lies and thoughts control
Synchronicity their highest goal
They transgress the boundaries of good taste
Take a stand now, no more time to waste

[Pre]
[Chorus]
[2 x Chorus]
