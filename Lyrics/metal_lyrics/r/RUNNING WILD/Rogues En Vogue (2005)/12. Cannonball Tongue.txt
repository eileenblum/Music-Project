[Music: Rolf Kasparek, Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

[Limited Edition Bonustrack]

Blood of a promise is dripping from your lips
Sugar in the gas, the evil takes and sips
Progression's fading slain by deadly lies
Perfect shaving, the sheeps will pay the price.

Your convictions changing like your tie
Outrageous fiction, your suit comes with a lie

Black is the shade of your heart
You fall to fire, step by step, part by part

Caught in darkness, the poison in your heart
Made up stories, your everlasting art

Cannonball Tongue

One step forward and two steps going back
Specialized in sit-outs, your way of attack
Ostrich behaviour, head deep in the sand
Trivial phrases, empty of content

Black is the shade of your heart
You fall to fire, step by step, part by part

Caught in darkness, the poison in your heart
Made up stories, your everlasting art
