[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

I wanna tell a story
Of worldwar No. 1
How lies of "death or glory"
Feeding on the gun
"This is the war of intrigues
This is the war of pain
This is the 'One world order'
Where every truth is slain"

Empires on their hitlist
Dreams of enslavery
Crushing iron fist
To see man on its knees

[Pre:]
A spiral that leads on to hell

[Chorus:]
The war, well it came with a lie
The war, where the monarchy died
The war, where the twisted eye reigned
The war, falling to ideals insane

In 1897
Secret agreement came
The whole world to plunder
In "Lucifer's" name
Making up a conflict
The "crown" was on the game
Their "tank" was on the move now
"Entente" was its name

[Pre]
[Chorus]

A shot in Sarajewo
Tactic of blatant lies
This was a deadly cocktail
And common sense really died

Gas into the fire
The "shield" was flaming "red"
The world became a pyre
Widows, broken and sad

[*] The war is a bundle of intrigues
The war is still raging on
The war, a creation of soulfreaks
The war until they are gone

[*] The war is a taste of hellfire
The war is the downfall of man
The war is the trade of the liar
The war again and again

[Repeat *]

The war is the war is the war
