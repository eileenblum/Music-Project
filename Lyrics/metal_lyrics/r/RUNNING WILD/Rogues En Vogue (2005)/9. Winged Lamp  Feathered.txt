[Music: Rolf Kasparek]
[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

Gods &amp; warriors
In a long agone age
Tragic &amp; glorious
Where fate turned the page

Time was mythical
Mount Olympus alive

[Pre:]
Spreading his wings to fly
Touching the golden sky
Fury against the dark
Loyal and true at heart

[Chorus:]
Winged &amp; feathered, flying on high
Winged &amp; feathered, way up in the sky

Gliding majestically
The winged horse in the sky
Turning perfecly
Natural born to fly

[Pre]
[Chorus]
[Repeat 1st verse]

[Pre]
[2 x Chorus]
