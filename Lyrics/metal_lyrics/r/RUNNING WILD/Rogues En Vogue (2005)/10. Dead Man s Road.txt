[Music: Rolf Kasparek]
[Lyrics: Rolf Kasparek]

Loudest madness, silent sadness
Bedlam, raving mad
Frustration on the nation
Entertainment all the way

Perfect plastic, orgasmatic
Silicone valley on two legs
No meaning, TV-screening
Boneheads right en vogue

[Pre:]
Straight on the long and lonely road
Into the void

[Chorus:]
You're walking the wire
That leads you straight to dead man's road
You're walking on fire
Well, on the edge you lose yourself
On dead man's road

Casted fastly, fallen castly
Cashing in on trashing arts
Ride the donkey that brings on the money
Champagne and celebrity

[Pre]
[Chorus]
