Out in the world you can watch'em struggling
For a small piece of luck
They won't die with a smile on their face

For possession they'd kill their mothers
For some bucks they deny themselves
And the whole world is right in that trace

They are riding forth
No time to lose
Got to alter every place
They are riding forth
No way to choose
And the next step's out to space

With a high hand they watch their buildings
Self-righteously praise their deeds
No time for recess on their way

In a way it is quite amusing
But it's a fake of deepest dye
Let's hope they'll see it one day

They are riding forth
No time to lose
Got to alter every place
They are riding forth
No way to choose
And the next step's out to space

Pay attention to history
Look at all the things they've done
No remains, there's nothing left
It's all blown to kingdom come
