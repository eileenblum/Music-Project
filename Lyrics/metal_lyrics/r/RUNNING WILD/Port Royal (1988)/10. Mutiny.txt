Pain of hunger's growing stronger
The wages are gone, can't wait no longer
I have to sign on under every flag
If I want to live, I have to fag

Engaged, I hit the sea
Never thought of mutiny
The work is hard, the pay is low
We're treated bad, our anger grows

The waterbarrels going bad
Daily a sailor dies by fag
Whip cracks pain's their holy law
If they're going too far this means war

Stand up and fight

A seaman disobeys a law
The whip cracks, flowing gore
He gets a hundred cuts, one too much
His death feeds our grudge

The waterbarrels going bad
Daily a sailor dies by fag
Whip cracks pain's their holy law
If they're going too far this means war

With grinning looks we precede
Revenge for the ones who'd bleed
Encircling bastards who killed
Their eyes show fear, they're thrilled
