When I was a kid they tought me their rules
We did anything they want, we did it like fools
Their book was holy, we learned it by heart
Their holy fight, we had to take part
Exploited and cheated my life was a mess
Religion and war, we were possessed

Inspired and brave, out to the field
So blind that we couldn't see, our destiny was sealed
We tried to fight, fell one by one
Disillusion, our belief had gone
Exploding shell tore off my legs
Senses faded by the grenade cracks

Warchild, Warchild
We fought and died for it... we are

Warchild, Warchild
We cried and bleeded for it

Wake up now
