[Blackmore/Turner]

Lookin' like little miss lonely
Standin' in her ruby red shoes
Tellin' me she loves me only
Ever if it ain't true...
Ooh you... drippin' with desire
Skintight, dynamite
Fever takes me higher

[Chorus:]
Lemme see ya rock
Lemme see ya roll
Lemme see ya burn
Rock fever...

[Chorus:]
Yeah, gonna give it to you tonight (rock fever)

I can feel your blood run hot
Burnin' with a fire
Gimme everything you got
Right down to the wire
Ooh - temperature is risin'
Ain't no use I'm breakin' loose
I ain't gonna fight it

[Chorus:]

Come on, let me give you a shot...

44 calibre rock and roll
Fever deep inside her
Hits me straight between the eyes
When she open's fire...
Ooh... you
Drippin' with desire
Skin tight, you're dynamite
I can't get much higher

[Chorus: x3 times]
