[Blackmore / Dio]

When evening falls, she'll run to me,
Like whispered dreams your eyes can't see.
Soft and warm, she'll touch my face,
A bed of straw, against the race.
We believed we'd catch the rainbow,
Ride the waves to the sun,
Sail away on ships of wonder.
But life's not a wheel with chains made of steel.
So, bless me, come the dawn,
Come the dawn, come the dawn, come the dawn.
