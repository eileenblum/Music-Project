[Samwell - Smith / McCarthy]

See the stars come joining down from the skies
Gently passing they kiss your tears when you cry
See the wind of summer blow your hair upon your head
See the rain, the falling rain, it's rain
Still I'm sad
Oh my flowers, my tears are falling two days
They are driving the night profound, they are lost
Flower, flower the wind is blowing
Time into my heart
When the wind blows hard, we are apart
Still I'm sad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Still I'm sad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, How I'm sad
