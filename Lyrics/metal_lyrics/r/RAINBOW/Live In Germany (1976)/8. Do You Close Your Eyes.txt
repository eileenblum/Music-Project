[Blackmore / Dio]

Oh na na na na
Mystery in me is something I can't see
But I see you very well
You slippy, cool, nobody's fool
But there's something inside I can't tell
I know a poor man, a rich man
I know I can talk to a king
But nobody here is gonna tell me
I can't find out one thing
I see your glow around you
Open your arms 'cause
I'm walking to you, come straight or through
Maybe I'm wrong but
I know it won't take long to see
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah, yeah
Making sweet love to me, yeah
The logical friend said that
I know in the end
The things that make me smile
To right from the start, I take the image of your heart
and know it all the while
I know a rich man, a poor man
I know I can talk to a king, yeah
So nobody here is gonna make me believe
I can't find out one thing
I see your glow around you
Open your arms 'cause I'm coming, running, straight or through
I could be wrong but I know it won't take long to see
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes, I've gotta know
Do you close your eyes when you making love
