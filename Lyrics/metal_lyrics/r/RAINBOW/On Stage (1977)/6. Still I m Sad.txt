[Samwell - Smith / McCarty]

See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing, they kiss your tears and your cry
See the wind can't stop me blow your hair from your face
And the rain come falling down in its crazy way
Oh
Still I'm sad, still I'm sad
Oh, myself, my tears just fall in the dust
They will dry every night we find the love
Hey, see the wind can't stop me blow time in my heart
And the rain come falling down while we are apart
Oh
Still I'm sad, still I'm sad, oh!
See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing, they kiss your tears and your cry
See the wind can't stop me blow your hair from your face
And the rain come falling down in its crazy way
Oh
Oh, oh, oh, Oo-ooh
I'm so sad, I'm so sad, yeah
Ooh, ooh...
But still I'm sad
Feeling so sad, feeling so bad, you're making me sad
Breaking my back, ah
Oh, I'm sad, yeah
