[Blackmore / Dio]

When evening falls
She'll run to me
Like whispered dreams
Your eyes can't see, ooh
Soft and warm
She'll touch my face
A bed of straw
Against the lace, ooh
We believed we'd catch the rainbow
Ride the wind to the sun
Sail away on ships of wonder
But life's not a wheel
With chains made of steel
So bless me
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
We believed we'd catch the rainbow
Ride the wind to the sun
Sail away on ships of wonder
But life's not a wheel
With chains made of steel
So bless me, oh bless me yeah, bless me
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Ooh, ooh..
Mmm, mmm
Ooh, ooh
A light is all that see
Off to you and me
Ooh, ooh
Ride the night
See the light
Ooh
Take him to the sky, yeah
Ooh, oh
Oo-oo-ooh, ooh
Through the door
Ride the sky
Make it shine
For you and I
See the light
Through the night
Make it shine
To the night
Catch the rainbow, see the light
Catch the rainbow
And ride the sky
Make it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine!
Shine! Shine, for you and I
