Paint me your picture and hang it on the wall
Color it darkly, the lines must start to crawl

Down, down, down
Spin me around and around
Draw me away to the night from the day
Leave not a trace to be found
Down, down

Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

Paint me a picture of eyes that never see
With flashes of lightning that burn for only me

Hey hey hey
There's only the devil to pay
I'm ready to go
Pull me down from below
Give me a place I can lay

Hey hey
Nothing is real but the way that I feel
I feel like going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Hey hey
Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going down
Down, down

Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down
