[Blackmore/Turner]

You better not mess around with me
You know you better think twice
Because I've been running on a really bad streak
And I'm just looking for a fight
So you took me by surprise
Thought I was gonna run
But the cross fire is in my eyes
And my body holds the gun
Here I come
You better get ready to make your move
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm gonna shoot
Get ready make your move
Got your name on my bullet and my aim is true

You better not mess around with me
I got you in my sights
I've back's against the wall
You know that you better think twice
One of us is gonna fall
I'm looking for a fight and the time is right
You better get ready to make your move
Got my finger on the trigger and I'm gonna shoot
I say you better get ready
Make your move
Got your name on my bullet and my aim is true
