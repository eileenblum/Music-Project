[Blackmore / Turner]
[Intro: Rosenthal]

Day after day I'm waking up
To find that you're slipping away
Night after night
I can't fight the emptiness inside
There's nothing I can say
Now I know you're turning me away
It's only a disguise
But you don't have to hide
The truth is in your eyes tonight

I don't wanna live a lie
But I don't wanna say goodbye

And I can't let you go even though it's over
I just can't let you go
I know your love is growing colder

One look in my eyes and you'll realize
You got my heart in your hands
Won't you let me know something more
Where did we go wrong?

I don't wanna fight
All I wanna do is try to understand
I'm reaching out for you
Baby what can I do
I've been holding on so long

I don't wanna live a lie
But I don't wanna say goodbye

I can't let you go
Even though it's over
I just can't let you go
I know your love is growing colder
And I can't let you go even though it's over

I don't wanna live a lie
But I don't wanna say goodbye

I want you by my side
And I can't let you go
Even though it's over
I just can't let you go
I feel your love is growing colder

And I can't let you go even though it's over
I just can't let you go
Feel your love is growing colder

Don't go
Though I know it's over
I just can't let you go
