Everyone's restless, there's something in the air tonight
Thunder and lightning making us feel alright
I'm a time bomb ticking, you're ripe for the picking
Gonna make your temperature rise
I'm ready to explode now
You're circuits overload now
I'm climbing between your thighs

[4x]
Can you feel it?
Got the fever

It's no dream so you hold on tight
No there's no escape, no babe you can't fight
Got your body gonna, your juices overflowing
I wanna piece of your pie
Stick your nails down into me, scratch and claw me
I'll make you scream and cry

[8x]
Can you feel it?
Got the fever

[8x]
Can you feel it?
Got the fever
