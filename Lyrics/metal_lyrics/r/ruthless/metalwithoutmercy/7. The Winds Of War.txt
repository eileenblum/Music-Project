[2012 Re-release Bonus Track]Iâm dreaming in a field of darkness, where so long weâve seen no light.
Sailing in on a sea of madness, invaders coming with the night!
Rotor blade it splits the twilight, ready made for the kill.
Silently we lay in waiting, to escape from this field of darkness.

Iâm drowning in a pool of sorrow, the chosen one to bare your cross.
Reflecting back on lives tomorrow ... taken with no remorse.
A fatal game of hide and seek, hiding from myself âtil I sleep.
Left for dead my memory fades now, abandoned back to this pool of sorrow.
We cry tonight, from the napalm light, the forests a flame ... and every night well itâs the same.

Yeah, winds of war, they are howling at high velocity tonight, stars above see them falling, burst into a deadly light.
Listen children, all is forsaken with the power thatâs bequeathed to you.
Tranquility will be achieved now, to silence the winds from howling.

We cry tonight from the napalm light, the forests a flame ... and every night itâs the same.
We cry tonight, only trying, from the napalm light, the forestâs still flaming ... yea ... and every night itâs the same.

And every night itâs the same, the same, the same, the same, the same.
