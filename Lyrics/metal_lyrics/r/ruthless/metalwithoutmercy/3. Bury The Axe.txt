They'll come out of the skies with blinding speed
Causing world destruction on your flesh they'll feed
They live just for one purpose and that you'll see
Is to put an end to living to you and me

They'll come out of the skies causing terror very soon someday
For our stupidity and hatred they'll make us pay
Pain and anger shall spread throughout the land
They don't even care, they can't think or understand

The time has come to bury the axe

I want you all to stand up
And fight for what you believe in
I don't want you to let these metal minded monsters
Destroy your mind
I want to know if you all stand with us

The time has come to bury the axe
