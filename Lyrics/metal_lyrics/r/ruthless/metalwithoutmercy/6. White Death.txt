[2012 Re-release Bonus Track]Oh yeah.
My love is one of deceit. Come closer now and feel the need.

The need to burn with white lights, the need to die by white dust.

Yea ... youâll feel the cold all around you ... tonight! Youâll die ... you sold your soul to white death.

Runaway and hide, tonight we live in a paradise.
But thereâs a truth in the back of your mind, when the sun comes up, Iâll no longer be inside.

Yea ... youâll feel the cold all around you ... tonight! Youâll die ... you sold your soul to white death.
Your mine the cold blood rests in you. Youâll die ... you sold your soul to white death.

Now you know ... whatâs in store, white death knocks at your door!
Skeletal figure melting in the mirror, remembering back to when you were here.

Loved your scent and your childlike charm, dot to dot ... play it on your arm.
Stick a needle inside ... feel the pleasure ... so now your gonna die and deathâs forever ....

Yea ... youâll feel the cold all around you ... tonight! Youâll die ... you sold your soul to white death.
Your mine the cold blood rests in you. Youâll die ... you sold your soul to white death.
