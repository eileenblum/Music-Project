The prince of darkness has summoned me
To bring a message to all of thee
You'll listen good you'll learn it well
For he'll meet you all at the gates of hell

Walking through the mist of inferno road
An elm displays her dusky arms
The god of sleep there hides his head
Empty dreams are left unsaid

In various forms the specters mourn
Centers double and besiege the door
In the passage the hydra stands
Reaching out with one hundred hands

They're going down
Down to the gates of hell
They're going down
Down to the gates of hell

Gorgon turns with his triple frame
Vain chimera vomits empty flame
The chief he stands steel prepared
Waiting there for those who dare

[6x]
They're going down
Down to the gates of hell
