Master of metal will you hear our cry
We're iron glad soldiers ready to fight or die
Our time has arrived now, we're waiting no more
Our armies have swollen, we're marching through the door
We're taking no prisoners, we'll boil away your brain
Melt off your face drive you insane
We're rude and we're loud, we'll blow you away
We have no emotions no feelings left today

Metal without mercy, steel away your soul
Metal without mercy, never let your go
Metal without mercy, listen to what we say
Metal without mercy, you'll never get away

Prince of the night give us a sign
We're armed and we're ready to take over your mind
The crowd is intense, we take to the stage
Fist in the air, we fly into a rage
They'll tell us it's dying
We' ll bang our heads no more
We laughed and we said we're metal to the core
We're rude and we're loud
We'll blow you away
We have no emotions no feelings left today

Master of metal will you hear our cry
We're iron glad soldiers ready to fight or die
Our time has arrived now we're waiting no more
Our armies have swollen, we're marching through the door
We're taking no prisoners, we'll boil away your brain
Melt off your face, drive you insane
They tell us it's dieing, we'll bang our heads no more

We laughed and we said we're metal to the core
