It was a dark night on mulholland drive
It was a night that many did not survive
They were armed came with guns and knives
Sent to kill he controlled their minds

An evil man might be satan himself
Brainwashed kids many he did deceive
Told them lies, yes they did believe
Kill unknowing that's what he achieved

Charlie manson was his given name
Killing sharon was his way to fame
Now he sits and rots in his cell
Waiting there till he goes to hell

Mass killer, that's what he's meant to be
Mass killer, writings on the wall
Mass killer, that's what he's meant to be
Mass killer, writings on the wall
