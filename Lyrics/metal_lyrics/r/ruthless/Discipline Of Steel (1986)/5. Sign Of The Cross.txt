Run alone, steal my own
Stay away from me
Metal steams, bridge of dreams
Faster then the breeze

Be aware of who dare
Sacrifice no pain
Through the forest
Through the trees
There's vengeance in vain

[Bridge:]
It is your wish, you're in debt
Crucify the enemy when met

[Chorus:]
Find - the sign of the cross
Fulfill your destiny
Find - the sign of the cross
Don't let your mind be deceived

Cast your vote, stay afloat
Over the hills
It is written and submitten
Kill or be killed
By the light of day, just one day
Reach into the sun
Cast the rich into the ditch
The battle is won
