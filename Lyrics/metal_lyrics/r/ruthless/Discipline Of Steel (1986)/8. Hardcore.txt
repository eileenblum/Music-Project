Sitting down across the room
Staring back at me
Givin' me this evil wicked eye
So I walked up to her
Said look here bitch
Tonight I'll make you scream and cry

[Pre-Chorus:]
She's hardcore
Screaming for more
She's hardcore
Coming back for more

Got where I want you
Down on your knees
Gonna make you plead for mercy tonight
Getting deep inside you
Your so sticky and wet
I feel your body quiver and shake

[Chorus]

Got where I want you
Down on your knees
Gonna make you plead for mercy tonight
Getting deep inside you
Your so sticky and wet
I feel your body cum again

[Chorus]
