Back in the days before they keep time
The Earth was pure and mankind
People lives their lives in a simpler way
They didn't have the problems there is today

They traveled on horseback not in cars
No smog in the sky to cover the stars
Battles were fought with swords in hand
Was no thought of self-destruction in man

[Chorus:]
They left the message

Kings they ruled with power and grace
No politicians to cause disgrace
Maybe we should to cause disgrace
Maybe we should live like they did before
Or change real fast-see they're closing the door

[Chorus:]
They left the message

[Bridge:]
People why can't you see
We're causing this misery
The message has come from the past
We're living much too fast
