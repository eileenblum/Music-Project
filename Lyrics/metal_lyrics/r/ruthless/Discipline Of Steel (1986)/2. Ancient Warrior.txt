Standing a misty mountain
Sword held high in his hand
Looking down over the valley
Wants to free all his lands

His armor shines bright in the sunlight
He'll fight for his life today
Lead his people to battle
For their lives he will pray

[Bridge:]
Steakin' across the battle lands
Fighting among all his men
They're fighting for peace you'll see
They're fighting for all decency

[Pre-Chorus:]
For the time has finally arrived
Ancient man will always survive

[Chorus:]
Cry of the ancient warrior
Of the ancient warrior

[Chorus]
