Deep in the forest where there is no light
A fiery hatred that burns in the night
Demon warriors hunt side by side
Cowering victims have no place to hide

Steal your virgins - sacrifice them at will
The people watch - their own are killed
When all is down and all hope is lost
A new king is crowned no matter the cost

[Bridge:]
Pull the wool, over your eyes
And look into the sky

[Chorus:]
Know no evil, know no evil
Know no evil, oh no

Peaceful lands lay at rest y day
But when night comes they're not far away
A cloud of dust that rises within
They come to slaughter your next of kin

Your first in line - you begin to beg
They say to join them, join 'em to be saved
Try so speak, no words can find
But then your father's words come to mind

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
