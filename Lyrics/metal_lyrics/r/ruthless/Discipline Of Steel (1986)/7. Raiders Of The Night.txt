They coming to stalk you
You're their only prey
There comin' for you
You'd better pray today

They seek and destroy
And take over your minds
Prepare to battle
At the edge of the knife

[Bridge:]
And I told them we would fight
We know that we are right
We stand for what we believe
There's death to what they met

We see them in the distance
Prepare to meet your fate
The sounds of metal gods
Now we must hate
They're coming closer - a stench fills the air
The smell of sweat and blood
We show no despair

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Raiders of the night
Raiders of the night
We'll stand up 'n' fight
From the raiders of the night

[Post-Chorus:]
We're standing tall
Balls against the wall
We'll fight for what is ours
There's safety in numbers
We know that it's true
We are strong - we are few

[Bridge and Chorus]
