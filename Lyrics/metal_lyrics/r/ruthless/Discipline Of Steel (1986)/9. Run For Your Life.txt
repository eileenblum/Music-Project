Suicidal hot-line ridin' on the redline
Livin' on the edge of destruction
Flyin' down the highway, people see it my way
Death defyin' grace of my construction

[Bridge:]
Engine's on fire - life's on the wire
People don't know which way I'll fall
Pulling all the stops, runnin' from the cops
Off the distance I hear the master call - he says:

[Chorus:]
Run for your life, do or die, stand or fall
Run for your life, no one has it all

Outlaw renegade, thinkin' that I got it made
Look around what do you see
Got a girl in every town - just can't seem to turn it down
This must be the life for me

[Bridge:]
Can you feel the power's gettin' louder
Can't stay in one place too long
Runnin' from my trouble - leave behind the rubble
Off the distance I hear the master call, he says:

[Chorus]

[Break]

[Chorus]
