We are the warriors - we seek to rule the land
Wearing our armor we're neither good nor bad
We have but one objective - to make it through the night
They criticize the way we live and fight

[Chorus:]
It's just another day, just another day in hell
It's just another day, just another day in hell

The streets are jungle - no safe place to hide
So we chose to fight for the things we think are right
Out on the alleys we live from day to day
Leave us alone or there'll be hell to pay

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
We are the avengers - we're come to save the day
They'll rape you then you away
This is our land - we'll do as we please
One lick of my knife and your tongue begins to bleed

[Chorus]
