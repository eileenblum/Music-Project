Scavengers give warning, unleash the dogs of hell
The gods of death are rising - I'm the teller of the tale
The wagers of war know only to defy
Too much death and hatred - we're living a life of lies

Fear us the rebels, no one side we're on
Preparing our battle this war's gone on too long
Our thoughts are instinctive, been burned into our soul
Taught to us by our elders a long long time ago

[Chorus:]
Discipline of Steel - cannot think or feel
Discipline of Steel - killing just to kill
Discipline of Steel - cannot think or fell
Discipline of Steel - before us you will kneel

Scanning a memory of a past that's been and gone
Living and loving the something just went wrong
Forgotten the old ways, what keeps me alive each day
If you've tasted iron you know just what
I say

There is not a meaning to the lives we lead
Useless good for nothing sent here just to bleed
Fighting to death, we never will retreat
Constant forward movement, we'll never taste defeat

[Chorus]

Battle cry:
Can you hear the thunder, begin to wonder
Where we're going, never, never, knowing

[Chorus]
