We started this 30 years ago
A life we chose to live
With the ups, and the downs
This dream will never end

Out of the ashes
We ride
Out of the ashes
Ruthless rides

We're coming back with a big vengeance
We hear the roar of the crowd
We take the stage
The lights go down
It's time to turn the page

Out of the ashes
We ride
Out of the ashes
Ruthless rides [2x]

We started out 30 years ago
This dream will never end
We hear crowd roar as we take the stage
We've turned the page again
