We march upon the capital
The time has finally come
Tired of the lies we're told
The way this country's run

They take away our rights
Tell us what to do
Military or prison state
We'll be slaves when they're through

Circle
Circle of trust

Put our trust in politicians
A mistake we regret
Fighting for our freedom
Or live in dictatorship

Take a stand as one
Let voices be heard
Give us back our land
See, you don't have a choice

Circle
Circle of trust [4x]
