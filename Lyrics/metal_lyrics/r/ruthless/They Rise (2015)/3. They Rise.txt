The sun has fallen
The skies grow black
This evil rises
From its graves
Mindless monsters
With a taste for blood
They'll rip your flesh from your bone

A man-made virus
Has unleashed this hell
The dead now walk
The earth again
Experimental cover-up gone wrong
Now mankind fights to survive

The dead they rise
The dead they rise
Death has risen
Death has risen
Again...

Suicide becomes the way for some
An escape from this rotting flesh
Scavenger we now all become
A feast for the undead

The dead they rise
The dead they rise
Death has risen
Death has risen
Again...

The sun has fallen
The sky grows black
This evil rises from its graves
A man-made virus
Has unleashed this hell
The dead now walk the earth again

The dead they rise
The dead they rise
Death has risen
Death has risen
Again...

Death
Death
Death
