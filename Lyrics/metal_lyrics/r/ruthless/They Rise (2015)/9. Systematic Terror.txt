Suicide, running in fear
Slowly rotting inside
Demons from my pass slay me down

Locked up in a padded room
No longer can I hide
The voices in my head are getting louder

Systematic terror

Shadows on the wall
Reflection in the glass
This evil nightmare's insanity

Spiralling through my mind
Bleeding on my brain
Distant memories never end

Systematic terror

Systematic terror
