With thunder and lightning
He descends from the sky
Coming here to save his people
From the evil they defy
Tyrannies enslave them
Rules all the land
Making them do their deeds
With an iron hand

Defender

His armor shining bright
Glistening in the sun
His army lines behind him
Ready for the fight
Unsheathes his sword
Held high in his hand
Gives the order to march
Into battle with him

Defender [4x]

On the wings of freedom
He descends from the sky
Coming here to save his people
From the evil they defy
Unsheathes his sword
Held high in his hand
Gives the order to march
To battle with him

Defender [8x]
