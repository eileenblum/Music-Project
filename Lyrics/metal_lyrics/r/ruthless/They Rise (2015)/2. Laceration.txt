Unsuspecting victims
Not knowing their time is near
Cold blooded killers
Spreading devastation

Obedience through fear
Laceration of the soul

Slaughter of the innocent
Mayhem before our eyes
Children never getting the chalice to live

Obedience through fear
A laceration of the soul
Obedience through pain
A laceration of the soul

Infants cast into eternal hell
In the silence
We hear the moans of a dying world

Obedience through fear
A laceration of the soul
Obedience through pain
A laceration of the soul
