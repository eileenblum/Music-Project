Sitting here all alone
Waiting for the end
Tears, they fall
From the pain I feel
Losing you, my friend
Looking up I see your face
Fading in the sky
Knowing that the day will come
When we'll meet again

Time waits for no one
I've seen so much death
Time waits for no one
I have my regrets
No one waits for me

This hurt I know
Will fade in time
But not your memory
Thoughts of you
They fill my mind
You live inside my heart
In shades of dark
You're the glowing light
Now I'm letting go
In the black of night
You're shining bright
Now I'm letting go

Time waits for no one
I've seen so much death
Time waits for no one
I have my regrets
No one waits for me
