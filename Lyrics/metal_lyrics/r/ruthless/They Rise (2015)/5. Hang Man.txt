Running and hiding
From the deeds you have done
Stealing and killing
Swimming in innocent blood
This life that you've chosen
An outlaw with a gun
Inside you're slowly rotting
A demon you've become

No place you can call home
Your family's turned on you
Your friends all disown you
Everyone looks away
Your hatred now it blinds you
Your soul it smells of death
Lost inside this out-land world
A path that you'll regret

Now you heel the hangman's noose
Wrap around your neck
As you try to take
One last breath
Can you feel the hangman's noose
Slide around your neck
As you try to take
One last
One last breath

For years you've evaded
The long arm of the law
In shadows your fear grows now
Your time is running out
Darkness now surrounds you
With every move you make
Panic's setting in
And death's not far away

Your heart it bears faster
The time it flies on by
Thoughts now betray you
You don't know what to do
The end is now near
You know you're gonna die
You'll hang there by your neck
Until you're fucking dead

Now you feel the hangman's noose
Wrap around your neck
As you try to take
One last breath
Can you feel the hangman's noose
Slide around your neck
As you try to take
One last
One last breath
