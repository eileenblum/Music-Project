Never, let the blood
Of the innocent, be shed
Yet let the wicked's flow
Like a river; to carry the corpses
Of their dead

We don't want your hungry
Or your weak
It's evil we seek
And with every breath we breathe
We'll hunt it down
Until there is none left
To be found

Heretic, abomination unto God
You have stolen many lives
But tonight we will come for
Yours

For we are the army of God
Not to be compared with legion
So as you look into my eyes
Try to tell me; that my God isn't real

In God alone i trust
To wipe away the tears of the innocent
And justice; will be claimed

So, prince of this world
Fear me
For I will hang your corpse
As a mockery of evil
