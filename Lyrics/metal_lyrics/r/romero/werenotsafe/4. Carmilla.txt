Tales were told
Of a woman
Who drew the dead
Into her body

Lead out into a forest black
Underneath the autumn moon
The cry of the witch calls forth

Temptation
Deception
In the weak
Mind of fools

A succubus
She beckons
The dead
Into her womb

With scarlet lios she prays
Unto the devils heart
Stripping the life away
From men; cadavers at her command
They beg for touch; they crave her moan

Men; what will become of this world
If we continue to feed this whore?
What will become; of true love?

Now'a the time; to light this up
And burn away; her unholy lies

Tonight tonight; we take back this town
Tonight tonight; we end her curse
And drive a stake deep into the heart of lust

And in the Father's name
I pray amen
