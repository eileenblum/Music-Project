Silence mourners upon the
Mortuary steps
Notions ill conceived
And they wept
Over the false messiah
That you prophesied

By the, stagnant water
Ever flowing, from your lips
Flooding the hearts of His people
Thirsty they sip

As you prostitute their innocence
Upon an unholy alter

Murderer of unborn prophets
Murderer of His children
Their eyes, are a gate to despair
Their eyes, are a gate to despair

Formed by the hands of men
Regurgitated by God

Liar, force feeding a weakened god
You, are nothing more
Than a whore
And a fraud

I have heard
The heartbeat of God
And it will be
Our war cry

For blood, has been shed
For innocent blood, has been shed

And I, will only bow to God

I will, only bow to you
O, Lord
The creator
Of the heavens and the earth

For You are the ocean
That buries this heart
Jesus, awaken this land
