We didn't come here to bow down
We came here to fight

We will wage this war
We will not back down
Lift your hands, to the sky
And know that you're not alone
You're not alone, do not be afraid
For God is with you, do not fear

So tell me, what have you to do with peace?
So tell me, what have you to do with peace?
Take a stand and fight with me, take a stand and fight
Take a stand and fight with me, take a stand and fight

Do not hesistate, do not waste what God has given
Do not hesistate, do not waste what God has given

So tell me, what have you to do with peace?
So tell me, what have you to do with peace?
Take a stand and fight with me, take a stand and fight
Take a stand and fight with me, take a stand and fight

And as death, reaches out
Take his hand and break it
