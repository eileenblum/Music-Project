Dear friend, for the sake of God beware
Kiss the rose, you have in hand
And wipe the dust from this face
And blessed, be the man who spares these bones
And cursed, be the man who moves these stones

Many like us have loved, many like us have cried
And many like us have left this life
In the blink of an eye

We took this world, through our courage
Our strength
Yet we couldn't take anything with us
Down to our grave
Yet we couldn't take anything with us
Down to our grave

So remember, as you pass us by
As you are now, so once was I
And as I am, so one day you'll be

Now prepair for death and follow me
For you will remain alive, in the dreams of the voiceless
