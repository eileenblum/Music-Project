Do not utter, a word from your lips
Keep your mouth shut, keep your mouth shut
Or I'll rip you apart

Now remove the mask that you've been wearing
and show this world, your decaying beauty

You have betrayed all, that matters to you
Do not lift your hand out, expecting me to lift you up
I have no sympathy, for traitors

America, how does it feel
To have the blood of your saviour
On your hands?

You are not the one with nail scarred hands
