You know that you're alive
But your heart is failing
For so long you've been asleep
But your eyes are open

As your soul clings to the ashes, of this life
Know that this is what it's like, to be alive
When you are living, to die

To your hands you fell
To your feet you stand
How long did you lie awake?
How long did your heart break?

Without you, this world held nothing x4

Yet I went without you
Help me recall
The way you etched love upon this heart
And forgiveness upon these arms
God..... God save me

You over took me, with who you are
Refine this heart by your love, your hands

Make in your image, a man who will be after your heart
