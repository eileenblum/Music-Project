Bow before the throne, of deception
Lift your hands up high to this mockery
False prophets singing praises
To a god, they do not know

Mortal lives singing praises
Unto, a darkened throne
Mortal lives singing praises
Unto, a darkened throne

Lacerations across this sky
Shed the tears of your god
Revealing his lies

Now is the time to destroy this plague
As their idols, lay broken at their feet

I will feast upon the flesh of your head table
And the hand of divenitey will reveal the absolution that you've mocked
You borth forth, this witness
Birthing poison from the womb

Jesus Christ, first born of the dead
To you alone the glory
