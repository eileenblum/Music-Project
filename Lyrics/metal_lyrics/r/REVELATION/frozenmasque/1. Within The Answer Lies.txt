Lying here in the quiet
Serene thoughts never come
The canvas of black
Offers a perfect still
For the flashes of life
When the switch is thrown

The nightly ritual of sleep
At bay for the moment
I want the truth
The underlying answer
To the burning question
Who am I

Truth is I know &amp; I''m frightened
I have become what everyone sees
What they want me to be

And not even I know
What it''s doing to me
So I lay here,try to rest
For tomorrow comes all too soon
