One face for self
While another for you
Cannot the difference
See between the two

Which one is real
And which is fake
The sustenance of which
Is hard to partake

I feel like I''m dying
With a thirst to quench
But I can''t reach
Far enough down that hole
To taste the water
Sweetening my life
But I can''t
