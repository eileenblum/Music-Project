I don''t need this,not now
Just leave my mind

Every night you visit me
Taunting visions &amp; emotions within
All I want is to be finished with you
To move on
But somehow I can''t

You''re in disguise,fooling my heart
Revealing yourself when I am weak

Every night you visit me
Taunting visions &amp; emotions within
All I want is to be finished with you
To move on
But somehow I can''t


Do you wake up angry at yourself
For letting me slip into your mind
