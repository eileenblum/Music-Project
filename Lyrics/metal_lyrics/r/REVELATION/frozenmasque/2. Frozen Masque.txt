I hide behind
This smile on my frozen face
A side of depression
One should not bear

Not content with death
I toil on through despair
Every once in awhile
Someone sees through this face
That I wear

Once I met 
A person such as this
But I was in a strange land
Not understanding
How much honesty
Flowing from her
And I see

That with her kind words
I found me
That with her generosity
I found me
