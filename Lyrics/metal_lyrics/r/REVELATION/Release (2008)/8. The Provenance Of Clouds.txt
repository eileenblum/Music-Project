A sometimes wisdom
A lonely vision
A love of life
A lone revision

This disguise is for the season
I need only a reason
The edge of a precipice
A simple matter, reckless
Willing more than needing
Drinking more than bleeding
A compact letter
Unfold it if you will

The word stuck in time
The whole a crime
A token of victory
Orthodox insincerity
We throw a rain of pearls
Hard tried by destiny
This particle of faith
Don't look too closely
