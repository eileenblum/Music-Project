[Words: John Brenner]

Follow me not in the depths of what is real
Into the objective vision over all
And do not join me in my misery
In my decision to remain as one apart

Deceive me not with false hopes of relief
Into believing that good can come of life
For I know that belief comes only from insanity
When I feel the pain of tortures unknown

What do I see in visions discreet
Futures unseen, paths not meant to be
Where can I find inside my mind
A means of escape from all of their kind
