[Words: John Brenner]

Lonely spirits hide behind my sight
They search the ruins of a dying mind
Dredging deeply for my will and courage
To face the future cleansing of my dreams

Piles of ashes sifting through my fingers
Wailing to the winds of remorse and regret
The only remnant of the Past and of tomorrow
A shriveled life, a withered destiny

Upon a pyre, the ruins of my vision
Are burned away, freeing them of sin
Who cares to resurrect the unremembered and unknown
When even the ashes are just a memory
