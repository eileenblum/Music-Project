[Words: John Brenner]

Your scars remain before my eyes
Even those you choose not to reveal
Sensitive enough to yet bring tears
A burden of grief that I cannot ease

Dejectedly I sit and stare
Feeling all of my wounds afresh
Deep they reach into repressed
Feelings which I ever hoped to hide

Driven to our self-inflicted pain
And compelled to re-live again
All of our vulnerable yesterdays
Thus we cope in our different ways

Who can tell me where to hide
What will make you whole inside
Most things I know will never change
Especially not the ones we wish
I torture myself
For I haven't any answers
So in despair we continue on
Fearful of another sunrise
Of another harmful dream
