[Words: John Brenner]

Sometimes I scream late at night in my head
In vain to release the frustrations
And I find no solace in the knowledge and lore
That is at the heart of my coping with life

And though I try to be not a sinner
I am yet a slave to temptation

Sometimes I cry when I look at the world
And watch it rushing hastily by
Without but a glance at my wretched self
Unconcerned with anguish and pain

A speck in the void, a fleeting cloud on the wind
I can't preserve even a second of love
But is it too late, Lord, help me not to hate
And to show the world that true sincerity lives
