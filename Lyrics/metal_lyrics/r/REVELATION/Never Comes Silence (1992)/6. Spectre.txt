[Words: John Brenner]

In the darkness of night
The silence slowly takes form
The black velvet of loneliness
Stealthily moves to envelope my mind
And I relive morbid scenes of my life's tragedies

The icy touch of regretful woes,
The spectre that is past grips my heart
Inflicting torture and deadly hindsight,
Demanding correction of my wrongs

I walk back in time on the path of despair
The memories seem so painfully real
Ever shackled thus to my present days
I reside in the shadow of depression
In the churning maelstrom of emotion
The spectre bears me along unrelentingly...
