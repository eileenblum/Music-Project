[Words: John Brenner]

Yesterday I saw the flowers crying
Mourning for what used to be
And then I touched them with my mind
And saw they also cried for me

Today I saw the high sun frowning
Saddened by what I have become
No longer able to unfreeze my heart
Forever frozen until numb

Outside I found the air was dying
Stale and lifeless, short of breath
Poisoned by my thoughtless needs
To slowly lead us both to death
And all that is green has now been paled
The colors have faded, their brightness assailed
And, though I wish to make amends
The path of nature now only descends

The lonely creature of the woods are going
The way of the hopelessly forlorn
Until all that remains is myself, wretched man
Condemned to die before the morn
