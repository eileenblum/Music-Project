[Words: John Brenner]

Here is the night
And here I am
Where I remain within the walls
Which protect and hide
My thoughts on fast-forward
To empty promises I've made myself
To a place everywhere...
And nowhere

racing thoughts no stop them please won't someone make me
laugh again I just want to sleep forever only without dreams
just black nothing but sleep never comes I reach out call out
no one is there no one hears where are you maybe I'll
never know find me save me from all choices all futures
no answers never come

I'm alone
No one watches me
In no one's thoughts am I now
Must it be as if it never were?
I can't see beyond yesterday
As I fade from your memory
So do I fade from my own
(goodbye...)
