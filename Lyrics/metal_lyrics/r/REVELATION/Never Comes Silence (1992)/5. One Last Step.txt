[Words: John Brenner]

I stand on the edge of darkness, small and insignificant
Balanced between compromise and conviction
The abyss sweetly calls my name

I stare at this empty page, reflecting my future
Unable to express my inner trepidations
In hollow meaningless empty words

Who stands between me and self control
How small the straw that is the last
How thin the walls which seal my mind
How close the final episode of apathy
