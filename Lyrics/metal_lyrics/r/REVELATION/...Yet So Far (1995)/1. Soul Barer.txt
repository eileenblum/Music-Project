[Words: Dennis Cornelius]

Why do people try to steal the moment
When my perception is what really matters
I can't think for myself
Somebody must do it for me
I can't get into that reality
Stress I feel on me everyday
Can't relax can't control my anxiety
It's hard to face the truth
I'm afraid of my inner self
Can't be who I really am
