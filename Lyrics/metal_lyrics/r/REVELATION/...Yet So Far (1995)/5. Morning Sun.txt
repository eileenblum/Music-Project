[Words: Dennis Cornelius, Steve Branagan]

Like a circle, the morning sun begins and ends
From the sight of it, I hold back always waiting
Every aspect, every possible point of view you can fathom

My unavoidable destiny
The human idiosyncrasy
It is exigent that I must deviate
From this fear of unimaginable pain

At the crossroads I seem to take wrong turns
Perfect hindsight reveals the true route
If I can learn from the past, can I become
The individual I aspire to be?

Like a circle, the morning sun begins and ends
From the sight of it, I hold back always waiting
I can continue to put off life, but how long will
It wait for me?
