[Words: Jim Hunter]

Something pure
If left undisturbed
But is it made of stone or sand?
Can it last forever?
If it falls away
Will I even understand

Things are said
To open the cracks
And begin the decay
Misunderstandings shatter
It to dust, gone, fallen away

It's hard to see eye to eye
When paths never cross
There's nothing left to rebuild
This love forever lost
