[Words: Steve Branagan]

Searching for the one, the one who is to come
Will it ever happen for me?
Waiting is like staring into the deceitful winter sun
The endless lonely journey that clings to a merciless hope

I believe the moment will come
I have to believe it will happen
I believe the moment will come

Will there ever be a point that I will just give up?
Am I to walk the beaten path without questioning my fate?
If I ever get there I may not even know it
A myriad of thoughts, a plethora of forgotten dreams

...The never ending search for truth
...A nameless face in a sea of unsurmounting falsities
I must trudge the weathered path
