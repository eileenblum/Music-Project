[Words: Steve Branagan]

I move on as if something keeps pulling me forward
I don't want to go too far for fear of not wanting to return
One eye looking forward, the other looking back

I wander from the external world
An impressionable soul in an inherent spectacle
A minuscule player in a monstrous entity

I stare at the palatial displays
Yearning to be a part of it
If I could fly, I would fly the infinite heavens
If I could paint, I would paint the endless skies
I take the natural steps to my destiny

The strive for immortality is awakened by thoughts of reality
For what seems like days, turns out to be only minutes
The pleasure of the soul is only an arm's length away
