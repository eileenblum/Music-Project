[Words: Dennis Cornelius]

Turning my back to the breeze
I lift my feet off the ground and I soar

With no apparent reason
I am looking for direction
For something real

In the distance on the horizon
I see the cloud it draws near

And all at once I'm surrounded
By the fear of what can never be
Why am I made to suffer

In the darkness I search for you
Groping through an eternal mist
In the daylight I have no self-control
Over wanderings in my head

I found the room
You're crying

In the darkness we found a new
Place with fear put aside
In the daylight I remember
Things I could not see at night
