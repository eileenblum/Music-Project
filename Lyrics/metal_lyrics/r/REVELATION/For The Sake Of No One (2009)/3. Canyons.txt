All dreams muffle their music
Fearfully I try to understand
Your world
Far behind
The sky
Seems small today

Canyons divide your glances
If glances say what they mean

Two languishing in the apse
Beneath a hollow sun
Elbowing through doorways
Endless rafts of words
Like nightshades in evergreen lands
A chord like five night trains
One umber hair winding
My lips are too pale for your cheek
