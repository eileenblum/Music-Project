We have no faith in stones
No taste for eating earth
This is for you alone
My temporary soul
The hard shadows at noon
Snow falls through the holes
A hundred promises
Ended with that madness

Music for our desire
The terror of yielding
Slowly drives you away
Sweating, drifting
Eyes on those sacred hands
Everything is seen
Everything is known
Everything ignored
