Snow sounded a warning
A compressed afternoon
Deafening whispers
Shone like rotten wood
My fingers
Sought shelter in your room
You ravaged
And like a vandal left too soon

Memories of pale lunar fictions,
Breasts, and leaves

Alone on a jetty
I was down the hill
An old and weary
Chasm of azure
Pierced by arrows
Stretching ropes from the steeples
Confound the plagues
Little drunken vigil

Memories of pale lunar fictions,
Breasts, and leaves
