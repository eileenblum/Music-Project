When A Ray Of The Sun Brightens The Earth
And The Glance Doesn't Seats On The Killed In The Battle
The Night Starts It's Way And The Devil Doesn't Drowse
He Tears The Warriors Souls Inclined In The Prayer

But The Death Doesn't Make The Deceaseds Feel Quite
Showing Them The Way To The Kingdom Of Gloom
A Beautiful Maiden Can't Find The Hero
And They Are In Spell Of A New Charge

They Gods Cousted Down They Eyes And Turned Their Faces
Just The Devil Walks, covering everything with darkness
Shrowing On Sleepers His Bloody Faces

Souls Fight To Earth Other Here
And Their Flesh Is Just A Mute Reward
The Flesh, Doomed By Their Destiny
So You Can Name

That Place Appeared Because Our Madness
And Our Wish To Destroy Everything
But Forces Are Equal So It Wount Be The Winner
That Is The Reason Of Eternal World.
