My Room
The Kingdom Of My... Melancholy
My Mind
Can't Realize The World... Around Me
My Underworld
Created And Surrounded... By Four Walls
I Keep This World
Just For Myself.

My Eyes
Glance At The Outside
Into The World Of Fear, Violence And Haterid
They Heads
A Turning To My Side.

There Are Looking At Me
Those Creatures
Can't Be Called The Human Deings
Darkness Is In Their Souls.

Their Eyes Are Full Of Lie And Hipocrisy
Their Hands Destroed Greedness
Are Turning To Reach And Destroy Me
To Turn Me Into A Faceless Creature
Like They Are Concidered To Be.
