Dream...
The Life On The Earth Is A Dream.
One Long And Recurrent Dream.
It Makes You Crazy By Monotonicity.
And Now It Surrounds You.
Now You Belong To It.
And You Become A Dream For Others.

Die...
Break The Nets Of Dream (The Nets Of The Life).
Take My Hands,
Make A Step To The Path Of Understanding.
Destroy THe Dream Of Life.

Cold... Emptiness...
Yes, That Was Hid Out Of Illusions
They Are In Front Of You.
The Gods Of This World
Touch Them. Break THeir Masks.
Are You Surprised? Wake Up.
They Are Not The Defenders Of Sufferes
This Gods Bring Suffering.
They Laugh At Your Pain
And Then They Make Sax Face.

Die...
Break The Nets Of Dream ( The Nets Of The Life ).
Take My Hands,
Make A Step To The Path Of Majesty.
Destroy THe Dream Of Life.

Now You Are Equel.
You Know The Truth
Play With Human Souls.
Create Your World Of Dreams.
But Look Arround, Was It The Last Step.
May Be It's Another Illusion.
But Who Are You? The God?
Just A Piece In Eternal Dreaming
And May Be The Death Is Just A Beginning?

Die...
Break The Nets Of Dream (The Nets Of The Life).
Take My Hands,
Make A Step To The Path Of Endless Suffering
