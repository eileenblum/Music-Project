[Roxette cover]

I know there's something
In the wake of your smile.
I get a notion
From the look in your eyes, yea.
You've built a love
But that love falls apart.
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark.

Listen to your heart
When he's calling for you.
Listen to your heart
There's nothing else you can do.
I don't know where you're going
And I don't know why,
But listen to your heart
Before you tell him goodbye.

Sometimes you wonder
If this fight is worthwhile.
The precious moments
Are all lost in the tide, yea.
They're swept away
And nothing is what it seems,
The feeling of belonging to your dreams.

And there are voices
That want to be heard.
So much to mention
But you can't find the words.
The scent of magic,
The beauty that's been
When love was wilder than the wind.
