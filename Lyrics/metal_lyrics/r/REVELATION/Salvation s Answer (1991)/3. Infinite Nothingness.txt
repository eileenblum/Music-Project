[Words: John Brenner]

Decisions
Are sometimes cruel
When you want to be an individual
And not another's tool

Which way does the pendulum swing?
Does it matter what the truth may bring?
Subjective viewpoints examine thin air
Objective reality only proves nothing is there

Motives
Are not well understood
Should you believe in "right or wrong"
Or in "evil and good"

Can we win in a game
That has no rules?
Can we live in a world
Of intelligent fools?
Is gray just a color
Such as black or white?
Is deceit an entity
Or just inner fright?

Is there more than
The human mind can conceive?
Or is there an answer
Beyond our beliefs?

Uncertainty
May well be the end
Another facet overly simplified
Brings Paradox again...........
