[Words: John Brenner]

What's in the future?
And what's it hold for me? 
Will things ever change?
I think I know

Lurking in the shadows
Something hidden lies in wait
It always seems to win
A game I'm not allowed to play

I can see clearly
That no one will be there
Least of all, you
Won't be at my side

How many times does right go wrong?
And who's the one to blame?
I pray to God the time will come
When someone will ease the pain

Is it just a premonition?
Or is it just my fate?
The long and lonely answer
Gnaws at my heart forever

It's the inevitable
Images etched in stone
A life of entropy
A death alone
