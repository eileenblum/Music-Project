[Words: John Brenner]

The time was right to rid the world
Of the serpent's filth and decay
Immaculate purity gave birth to a Son
To enlighten and pave the way
You taught us by example how to be one with the Soul
To be humble and give with your heart,
That Your Kingdom is our goal

Your blood was on our hands
But You returned to wash it away
Forgiving all who deceived themselves
In believing they'd turned You away
You left us with Your Spirit to guide us thru troubled times
But we have lost the light you've placed in us
And replaced it with lust and crime

Thank You for being there, for taking away my pain
For accepting me the way I am, for teaching me
For opening my eyes, For returning my love for You
I need You more every day, to cope with the hate and fear
I know You'll never leave me here alone
