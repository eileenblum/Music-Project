[Words: John Brenner]

Some have said they wished they were me
But what could I ever offer
You might say I just want attention
Only I know it isn't true

You ask why I'm so sad all the time
It's because I walk the road alone
The only One who waits for me
Waits on the other side

I can't change the way things are
Don't you think that I have tried
I can't pretend everything's all right
That would only be living a lie

How long must this go on?
I'm just Waiting for the End
For the end of my death

The truth is I'm not good enough
For someone who deserves much better
I hope that in God's eyes
I can live up to my expectations
