The full-grown son of an arrow
Whose hands are free,
A lonely ghost in the ocean
The chance sent to me,
Where the notes huddle together,
Is there room for him?
Not enough time to remember
To collect all the sin
(After sin)

All the old ways of thinking
A little luck, a little numb
All the despair, the crying and drinking
Deep in the august sun
Trouble awaits behind every doorway
Shakes the dust down to the bed
Trying so hard to ignore them
To send someone in my stead
(In my stead)
