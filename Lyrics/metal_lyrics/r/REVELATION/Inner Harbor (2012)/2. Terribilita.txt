Burning in effigy,
All that's inside of me
Bleeding through self-blinded eyes
Circle of agony,
Hellish cacophony
Deafens with too many lies

Voiceless, a conscience speaks
Answers that fall too meek
Torments from deep inside
The face in the mirror laughs
Like some distorted mask
Revealing thereâs nowhere to hide
