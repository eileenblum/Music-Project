In the dark waters standing still at dusk
Looking like prey in the eyes of hawks
Strangers are friends in this wondrous blue
By that boarded house sleeping in at noon

Looking for what slept there in the time and tide
Thereâs a penny in the tray so I raised my knife
Ambled out for love, open mouth in vain
Demanding to be measured after you went away

My dreams arose
Name and all scarcely shown
From sleep awaken
You always cross it alone

Walking empty handed, bending in between
Fever-felled, that brittle bridge is not a dream
They never broke the silence, wringing their thin hands
Bright small shells lying in the sand.

Watching, I wandered
Along the boat and shore
I thought about how long
The road would let me endure
