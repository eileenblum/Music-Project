In the cold of the moment
Dip into the well
For words that drown unspoken
Another soul to sell

If we were less than human
We could escape ourselves
But every feeling is broken
Thereâs nothing left to tell
Like welcome to a stranger
We embrace in sleep
Shaking hands with danger
And falling through the deep
