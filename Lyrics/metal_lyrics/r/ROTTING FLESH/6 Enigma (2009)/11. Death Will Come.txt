Down at the arcades / Shamelessly they creep
Undivided crowds / Striving for their sleep

Dungeons for life / Where dusk dwells upon thee
Summon the whispers / To join in thy coffin

Choirs of evil / Chant their psalms of deadness
Sores are bleeding / Sickened melodies

Death will come / To destroy
Seek the truth / To annoy!!!
