[Into the night of the Dead
Spiritual thoughts arise
Throwing their web over my ashes
As the darkness walks on my stone]

What is that incubus flying over your head?
Bringing denial upon the sad
Looking so dangerous with the threat of a curse
Feeding horrible spirits

Watch him through your dreams
Deadest of the dead
The truth covered with a sin

Killing the truth that enlarges your fear
You bow to your Lord - Feed your demon
Come to the Dead, follow the end
Look for the lie - Feed your evil

As
The Night
Of Death
Falls down
On you

Reckon the sign of metal
Into the living lie
The sign relates with you
Into the living lie

[I'm supposed to sleep with the dead
to join the believer inside his grave]
