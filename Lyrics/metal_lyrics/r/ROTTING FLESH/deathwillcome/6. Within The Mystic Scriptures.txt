Within the mystic Scriptures
That I have found one night
I read repulsive stories
About the ancient fight
Between the good and the evil
There has been eternal war
Bringing fear among the people
That they never felt before
Ah! The burning lands
That I have saw
Within my dreams
Still haunt me
Domination of the scary Gods
With the lat of the sword and fire
People running anywhere they can
Cause it dawns the year of the liar
Resurrection of the living dead
While the people for the heroes seek
Kings and armies fighting for the truth
Since the prophecies have made them freak
Why don't you ask the Necromancer for the truth?
Stillborn children for the Gods of steel
Sacrificed on altars of decay
They have brought the peace back to the land
Sacrificed on altars of decay
Now all I see is so black
That my eyes are in pain
And the fires burning hot
In the world of the insane
Within the mystic Scriptures
That I have found on night
I read repulsive stories
About the ancient fight
