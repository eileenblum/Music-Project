Death to the Afraid
The Devil creeps behind
His sight feeds your fear
the signs explode with fire

Rise
In evil
With hatred
And slaughtered
And die

Sudden, rotten evil sucked life forever
Benighted, winter's doom bereaves the light
Yield your swords to the Dark King
Yell to a universe of bursting Hell

Those who lie
With their mask will die
Chained with their lyr annous necrology
Rot with us
Those will die
With a piercing sigh
Suck their heart
On this Hell

Obscure Desire
And the truth of fire

Master of the sword, of the power, and the Lord
Of the living and the dead, of the bloodiness of fire
Master of the sword, of the power, and the Lord
Of the living and the dead, of the bloodiness of fire

Death to the Afraid
The Devil creeps behind
His sight feeds your fear
The signs explode with fire
