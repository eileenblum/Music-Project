Death will come
To Destroy
Seek the truth
To Annoy

Down at the arcades
Shamelessly they creep
Undivided crowds
Striving for their sleep

dungeons of fire
Where dusk dwells upon Thee
Summon the whisper
To join Thee in Thy coffin

Choirs of Evil
Chant their psalms of deadness
Sores are bleeding
Sickened melodies

Death will come
To Destroy
Seek the truth
To annoy
