The Signs of Obituary
Disquiets the pitiful
They stumble on reality
Like Lost Souls

Spirits burning in the Underworld
Expelled from the gardens of Atlantis
Echoing the laments of the Evermore
Doomed to a never ending striving

Soldiers with grisly claws
Legions that live in darkness
Tireless watchers of the Ever Plague
Gather the hopeless escapers

In under-crypts they hide
Amidst the boiling sea
They breathe an air of steam
So scurrilous
In shrines of red Sapphire
They worship Gods unnamed
And summon the undead
To join them

Spirits burning in the Underworld
Expelled from the gardens of Atlantis
Echoing the laments of the Evermore
Doomed to a never ending striving

The Signs of Obituary
Disquiets the pitiful
They stumble on reality
Like Lost Souls
