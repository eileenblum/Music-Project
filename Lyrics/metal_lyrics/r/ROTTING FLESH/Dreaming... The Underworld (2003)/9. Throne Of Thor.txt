High above a mountain where the mortals dare not go
Lies the greatest castle that no human eye can see
Built with stones so ponderous by Giants and Titans
Full with gold and diamonds and silver and sapphires

Empty chambers all there is inside the mystic temple
Wall paintings of some art by artists of the Goth
But inside the greatest one, the Chamber of the Chambers
So prominent and so grandeur, the throne of Thor

Thunders
Only you can see
If you are drawing near
And all the men who closer came
Draw back in fear

Choirs of glory one can hear
That hymn with minor chords
Praising with their chanting voice
The Throne of Thor
