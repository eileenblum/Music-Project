It's too late
Always slipped of a pace
Every time
Laments scar your face

Unspoken
Unspoken

It's a shame
But it's how you die
Without word
Is how you fight
All consumed
But it's why you're right
It's how you live
It's how you die

Watch with hate
fight again
What's all this redlight?
To suffer you're ready
That's why they summoned you
Walking on your reality

A fucker's insanity

Watch all the ugly pigs
What's all the dust around?
Watch how the came for you

Watching the dead around you run out to hide
Watch out and hurry up, don't eat this pie
What we all eat is what we always decide
No time to wonder now who we are
Unspoken
