We're only now departing
With our unborn
Entering the pathway
Walked by our kind
Evil is our beauty in the night
Evil is our way of fire

All the sleepless night, As our power
All that's dark within, As our power
Woke by a thunder that stroke in the night
Opened our red eyes
Striving for blood is a reason to fight

Before the sunrise
We are the red Gods
You are the victim
Ready to suffer the sweet pain?
Mortals restrain
Are you ready?
This is Your own reality
Are you ready?
This is Your own reality

Chariots of fire came to take us
To emerald cities of eternal desire
What are these words you just said?
Worry will not lift you higher
Watch how our teeth bring you list
Nothing can save you from fire
Watching our teeth wanting your blood
You fall in a sleep deep and eternal
