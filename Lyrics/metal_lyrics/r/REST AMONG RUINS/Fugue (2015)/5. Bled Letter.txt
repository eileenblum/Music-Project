Don't believe a word that you hear
I've written all that can be revealed
Don't let all be lost not having read
The words that through ink were bled

No longer do I see a monster in the mirror
When peeling the skin back, revealing a man
Desperately awaiting his lifeâs past
I still can't allow her to see me this way

Don't believe a word that you hear
I've written all that can be revealed
Don't let all be lost not having read
The words that through ink were bled

For now my truth can only be written
If seen or spoken, I know that I'll lose her
So through ink I leave my penitence on paper
Just like giving blood but I'm bleeding out

I swear that I'll show my face when
I get it back
I swear that I'll show my face,
you'll see me again once I am whole
