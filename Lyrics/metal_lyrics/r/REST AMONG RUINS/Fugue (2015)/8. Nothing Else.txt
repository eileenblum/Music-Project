Could we savor these early hours
If weâre speaking with our backs turned
To each other or are we here
Just to be alone?

I am right here in front of you
Why is it that you donât speak
I rose from the hospital bed to find you in the city
But you look through me as if Iâm a ghost
Iâve left the clues from our past
Yet the path you wonât follow
What more can I do to step into your view

Could we savor these early hours
If weâre speaking with our backs turned
To each other or are we here
Just to be alone?

There is nothing else
That I can say
It seems the memories have
Only remained with me

Was it the least of your worries that I arise
Without any scars from the wreck
I canât bear to ask these questions
Since you donât even seem to know my face
Iâve left the clues from our past
Yet the path you wonât follow
What more can I do
To step into your view

There is nothing else
That I can say
It seems the memories have
Only remained with me

So to the mirror I turn to see
Questioning my reflection
Never before was there a need to fear
So why is there one now?

There is nothing else
That I can say
It seems the memories have
Only remained with me
