With these stones that have held me here, captive
Lying now in ruins
A cascade of memories surrounds me and now
I leave the chains behind me
Remembrance is never the same when we remove ourselves
When weâre removed from the shame

Before you say anything give me this time
To find the life that was caught in endless night
Before we speak let me please see clearly
And through the ashes I will awake

The regrets that have held me here,
captive Are now understood as a
mark of my humanity
And a sign to leave the chains behind

Before you say anything
Before you say anything give me this time
To find the life that was caught in endless night
Before we speak let me please see clearly
And through the ashes I will awake

Don't worry this will all be over shortly

Before you say anything
Before you say anything give me this time
To find the life that was caught in endless night
Before we speak let me please see clearly
And through the ashes I will awake
