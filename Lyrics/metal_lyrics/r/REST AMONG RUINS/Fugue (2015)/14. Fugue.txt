Opening these eyes for the first time
As if they had seen all along

Follow these callings beyond the storm
Dying to know why this seems so momentary

For so long I've been waiting
To return to the world left behind me

Don't believe a word that you hear
I've written all that can be revealed
(Is this a sign to surrender?)
Don't let all be lost not having read
The words that through ink were bled

Is this a sign to surrender?
With a blindfold tied and just one round in the chamber

The will escapes me
To stop the record from skipping
The streets have emptied
And I have finally made up my mind

It's no wonder that there was
No exchange between our eyes
And I don't know if this is
Something from which I can hide

It's no wonder that there was
(I didnât mean for it to be this way)
No exchange between our eyes
And I don't know if this is
(A symphony without arms and)
Something from which I can hide

I didnât mean for it to be this way
A symphony without arms and
A theater empty while you're
Stranded in the balcony

Follow these callings beyond the storm
Dying to know why this seems so momentary

The shore, dreading the shore

I.XII.X.VIII.II.VII.IV.XIII.IX.III.V.XI.VI.XIV.

And when I finally
Pass through your gate
Avoiding the faces
Staring up at me
Expecting our eyes
To meet again
I met instead
Our names etched in stone
