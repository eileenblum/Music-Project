The sky hung low to the earth
As if to tell me that I am not worthy
But I continued to search
Clouds collecting in front of me
Lightly flashing

And there you were, standing amongst
A silent crowd behind the gate
Can you not see me?

Distant sounds of sirens
I know I'm in the right place
The point at which
Everything seems to drift
The other way
But I am still holding on

I am still holding on
And there you were, standing amongst
A silent crowd behind the gate
Can you not see me?
Can you not see me?
