But empty was the night
When I met the edge of the earth
As the light stormed behind the clouds
With empty hands, I refuse to leave my very last hope
And the mirror's view, the rivaling truth

Is this a sign to surrender?
With a blindfold tied and just one round in the chamber
I think it's safe to say I've been
Stranded and left to search with no direction
And I can't help thinking that I am supposed to
Lose myself along the way

Why else would this take form in front of me
At this moment, on this night
Other than to hide what I have been searching for
These familiar forces have suddenly become strangers
In a world that I thought I once knew

Is this a sign to surrender?
With a blindfold tied and just one round in the chamber
I think it's safe to say I've been
Stranded and left to search with no direction
And I can't help thinking that I am supposed to
Lose myself along the way

In the glaring light at the edge of the earth
Forsaken by the world and sky
It occurred to me then
What a pleasure it would be to watch them
To watch them burn
