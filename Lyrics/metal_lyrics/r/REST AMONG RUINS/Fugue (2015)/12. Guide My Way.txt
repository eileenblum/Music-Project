Risen from what felt like an eternity
The uncertainty drives me to my feet
Carefully following the heals of my steps leading in
And I'll never turn back around

My deepest wounds will not heal
Until I know you're alive
Trusting in city lights
To guide my way

Distant is the path standing before that
Of my convalescence; swept into darkness
With the lights and the screams of the sirens

My deepest wounds will not heal
Until I know you're alive
Trusting in city lights
To guide my way
