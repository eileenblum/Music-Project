Into the storm I reached and disarmed
Before it could reach me
To prepare as if to flip down
The light switch to see
Securing the gaps in the sky
Unknowing that our own
Is sure to shatter
As the world blisters below

It was the greatest mistake
Though we didn't know it
Tearing the bolts from the sky
Towering above our horizon
Now our city is dark and dry

These defenses are strong
Yet unaware that revenge doesn't heal
And in the end, who strikes last
Is simply as powerless as the first

It was the greatest mistake
Though we didn't know it
Tearing the bolts from the sky
Towering above our horizon
Now our city is dark and dry
Now we must wait
Until our wounds have healed

I didnât mean for it to be this way
A symphony without arms and
A theater empty while you're
Stranded in the balcony

Securing the gaps in the sky
Unknowing that our own is sure to shatter
As the world blisters below

It was the greatest mistake
Though we didn't know it
Tearing bolts from the sky
Towering above our horizon
Now our city is dark and dry
Now we must wait
Until our wounds have healed

Removing the storms
Before they could fall
Now it's just a matter of time
Before these acts will ruin us all
Now it's just a matter of time
