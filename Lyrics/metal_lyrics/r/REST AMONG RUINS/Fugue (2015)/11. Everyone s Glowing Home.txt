This wait has become so unbearable
And I fear that any longer may prove me unable
Months go by without answer
And still cannot the hour hand find its way
Has it all been forgotten?
Has it all been lost again?

The will escapes me
To stop the record from skipping
Each night, dancing
To broken rhythms of these questions

Atop the shards strewn across the floor,
Reflections of a truth to which I cannot describe
Still find a way to sink under my skin
Deeply, removed just to get a closer look inside
Makes me think that it's time I write to meet her

The moonlight seeping through the window
Over empty streets and glowing homes
By the looks of the carpet map below
Where were you when I needed you most?

Has it all been forgotten? Has it all been lost again?

The will escapes me
To stop the record from skipping
Each night, dancing
To broken rhythms of these questions
The streets have emptied
And I have finally made up my mind
To take this one chance
To find her again
