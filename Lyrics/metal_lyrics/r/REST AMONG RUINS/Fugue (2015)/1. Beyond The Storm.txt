Opening these eyes for the first time
As if they had seen all along
And never to speak again of these grey skies
That have held me captive
For so long I've been waiting
To return to the world left behind me

Follow these callings beyond the storm
Desperately reaching out for hints of solace
Dying to know why this seems so momentary
The time against the tide, always dreading the shore

The wreck, I relived over and over again
The agony in your eyes, the fear for our lives
With the prayer you not be taken

Follow these callings beyond the storm
Desperately reaching out for hints of solace
Dying to know why this seems so momentary
the time against the tide, always dreading the shore
Oh god, was her life spared?

Follow these callings beyond the storm
Desperately reaching out for hints of solace
Dying to know why this seems so momentary
the time against the tide, always dreading the shore
