There must be some sort of mistake here doctor
Unwrapping these bandages to another's face
Holding my breath as I race from mirror to mirror
Every time praying that the last was a lie

It's no wonder that there was
No exchange between our eyes
And I don't know if this is
Something from which I can hide
Imprisoned in another's skin
Where are the seams to release me?

I cannot wait while out of focus
A moment longer
A loss for words because they
Would not be my own

It's no wonder that there was
No exchange between our eyes
And I don't know if this is
Something from which I can hide
Imprisoned in another's skin
Where are the seams to release me?

Reflections in the night
Turn me out from inside
Reflections in the night
Can you not see that I'm
Imprisoned in another's skin
Where are the seams to release me?
Imprisoned in another's skin

It's no wonder that there was
No exchange between our eyes
And I don't know if this is
Something from which I can hide
Imprisoned in another's skin
Where are the seams to release me?
