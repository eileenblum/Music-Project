Approaching the shore,
My questions still unanswered
Just like I should have before but this time with blood
In my hands that paint the waves that pass by
A trail of guilt I'll forever leave behind
Every shade of the night washed away
Down to my blistered hands,
Carrying the burns and the burdens of my guilt
Yet ready for the weight of redemption

Rising under the tide
Lifted above my head, the waves to cleanse the sky
With all of my strength
I hope it's not too late to wash this guilt as far away as I can

Carrying the burns and burdens
of my guilt
Ready for the weight of
redemption
I'll hold on as long as I can if
even this ocean consumes me

Every shade of the night must return
To the sky above me
Rising under the tide
Lifted above my head, the waves to cleanse the sky
With all of my strength
I hope it's not too late to wash this guilt as far away as I can

The weight subsides as these waves become walls
In a moments rest on my shoulders
Then crashing down, every stone, every trace
Of imperfection, every fault exposed

Rising under the tide
Lifted above my head, the waves to cleanse the sky
Deliver us from the night
