[feat. Aleka Farha]Standing under a glaring moon and begging
Please come closer and share your reflections with us all
Iâve been lost in the worldâs confessions
And in need of your guidance
And I know what has driven me
But is it time to let go?

âcause I canât breathe
I've reached the edge
And can't believe what it's come to
And that I've been left with nothing
From where we were to where I stand right now,
Its all been taken away
Now I can't breathe, now I can't keep
This from defeating me

Standing under a glaring moon and waiting
For a reason to believe that this all was meant to be
Iâve been lost in the worldâs confessions
And in need of your guidance
And I know what has driven me
But is it time to let go?

âcause I canât breathe
I've reached the edge
I can't believe what it's come to
I've been left with nothing
From where we were to where I stand right now

âcause I canât breathe
I've reached the edge
And can't believe what it's come to
And that I've been left with nothing
From where we were to where I stand right now,
Its all been taken away
Now I can't breathe, now I can't keep
This from defeating me
