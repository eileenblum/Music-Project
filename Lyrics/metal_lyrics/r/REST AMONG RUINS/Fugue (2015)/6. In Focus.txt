Dreams of distant memories
Coming now into focus
As the story of our lives meets the big screen
Front row seats to our Hollywood premiere
A lifetime dream
Captivates an audience of one

Finally reliving this tale for the first time
Since I awoke to this terrible dream

For some reason I didn't see
The chapters lived most recently
Not that I am proud of them
I just find it odd that they're missing
Front row seats to our Hollywood premiere
An audience of one
Desultory remembrance of our lives
The theater lights flash suddenly
As I open my eyes to leave
A different ending it may have been
But there is no time to waste

Finally reliving this tale for the first time
Since I awoke to this terrible dream
