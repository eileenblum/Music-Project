Our fathered fears, begotten here,
Embraced in form of chivalry
Now lace our hearts to our sword

For our fears we live
For our fears we fight
For our fears we die

But maybe once, with this, we could live without (fear)
And with no need for closure, what could stop us?

A pool of tears collecting here,
Stronghold, stronghold of frailty
Now greets you as you wake

But maybe once, with this, we could live without (fear)
And with no need for closure, what could stop us?

Start this over, your thought, without cowering doubt
Start this over, needless closure leave it aside now

Silence will remain apart few
A part of all
Whispers deliver
But do not bring deliverance
But maybe once without
Once without fear
We could start this over
Start over
