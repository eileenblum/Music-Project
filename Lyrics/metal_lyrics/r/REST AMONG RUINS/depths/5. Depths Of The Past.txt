The world can no longer be your stage

Forgetting everything that I had said,
When the blade met your skin once again,
Of life to be lived; purpose unmet

And I hope you won't mind my being a close step behind
When gathering hope that you've lost

Forgetting the remedies
Forever within your reach,
Need I remind you that fate rarely gets its way

And I hope you won't mind my being a close step behind
When gathering hope that you've lost

I will beg not to watch you bleed
Again the depths of the past you've claimed, then foretold
Have conquered you

Forgetting everything that I had said,
When the blade met your skin once again,
Of life to be lived; purpose unmet
