With hesitance in knowing that the first will be a clumsy stitch
No time has felt like the right time to begin to mend and
With open arms welcoming all condolence

Remind yourself of only memories that are worth all embrace
Remind yourself that in the absence we remember permanence

Living only with the memory, the weight only becomes heavier
When begging life from behind glass
With open arms welcoming all remembrance

Remind yourself of only memories that are worth all embrace
Remind yourself that in the absence we remember permanence

Slowly losing sight

This is the dark display of your thoughts on my mind
