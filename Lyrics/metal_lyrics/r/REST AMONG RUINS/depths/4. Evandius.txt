Moments of clarity are few to be offered
As time is quite barren yet picked nonetheless

Eager hands forever gather
Seeking release, a chance to breathe

In the dying light
Of what we thought we knew
This is what I am, I've become

Although disengaged for the moment
The battle remains within
When what we've become
Begins to conquer who we are

As the shadow is further cast
In relentless dissonance

In the dying light
Of what we thought we knew
This is what I am, I've become

Only through our struggles to embrace what was forgotten
Do we realize what we have become:
Ghosts to who and what we loved

In the dying light
Of what we thought we knew
This is what I am, I've become

No one will know my face when I reach the end
