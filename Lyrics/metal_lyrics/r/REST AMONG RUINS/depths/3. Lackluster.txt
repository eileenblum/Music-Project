Stranded it feels to be alone amidst plenty
And identifiably so as forlornness floods awareness and thoughts submerge
As I wish to wash away this cathartic residue

And I fear these words will not be clear
Unrevealed, these thoughts of Grey

In taking this brief moment
To collect these scattered thoughts
And harbor their trailing dreams
I fear this is the end of the counterweight

And I fear these words will not be clear
Unrevealed, these thoughts of Grey
