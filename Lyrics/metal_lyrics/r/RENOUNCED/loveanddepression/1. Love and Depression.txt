Wash away the dirt from my hands, for I have suffered for to long.
Purify me burn these demons from my mind.
Images of you turn to ashes, as I grow older.
My love for others fades as the world chokes.
I can feel her dying.
I'm helpless I don't wish for angels to pick me up off my knees, I just pray for freedom from my demons.
Suffocating in my thoughts.
The battle between love and depression has been lost countless times.
This modern life is suicide.
As the rain falls, drowning me.
