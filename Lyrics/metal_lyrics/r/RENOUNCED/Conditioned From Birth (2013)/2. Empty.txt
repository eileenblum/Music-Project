Never have I dug so deep to keep the loneliest of nights from claiming me, or to stop the ocean from swallowing me whole.
The tick of the clock sounds like iron rain, falling from the heaviest of heavens.
Apparently taking your own life is a cowards way out. We all lose in the end, I wonder where you sleep, but I know you will just burn out like another memory.
It takes more than fucking someone to keep you warm inside.
Oh the tragedy of existence.
I'm so sick of this place in my head.
I just want to disappear completely.
Like god during the holocaust.
Show me the warmth of grace.
Show me my wings that work.
