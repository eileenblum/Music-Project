I like when you laugh like you have never been alone.
Because I know how unhappy you really are.
Your room is a graveyard of sleepless nights, with boys you never even knew and I was just another one you went through.
I couldn't stand you after a while, but I stayed because I felt sorry for you.
Now it's time for me to leave like your father.
You will go through life making mistake after mistake.
Holding onto things that don't exist, maybe you just have to save yourself form hurt.
Run away, because it works.
No more sand between our toes, no more south coast oceans, only the loneliest of cityscapes an solitudes for you to rot away.
