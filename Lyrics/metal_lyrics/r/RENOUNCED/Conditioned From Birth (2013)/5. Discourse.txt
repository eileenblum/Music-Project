No tolerance for ignorance, save me from this burning word, before I snap.
Fuck the sheep, who stick to their shepherds of hate.
Freedom is all I crave.
I see right through, stop burying the blame.
It's you that makes no change, it's you that's stays deranged.
I promised myself a long time ago, not to be apart of this fucked generation.
It's so hard to find anything gold, sometimes I think about letting go.
Forced into nothing.
They push the propaganda like a disease, it eats away at your soul.
This impending tide will consume us all.
I won't drown.
I promised myself, a long time ago
Pull the plug.
