So I move my lips because I know you won't move yours.
The silence is forever.
I just stare at my feet and hope the ground will give way, taking me with it.
A part of me doesn't care, but the other parts just want something to hold onto.
Mind prison, my soul must escape.
I should have walked away from day one.
That rope calls my name, but no more wanting to be a dead weight.
I'm so grateful that I don't miss your skin, but I do still remember your eyes, so wide under the early morning light.
Words mean nothing.
We should hold onto the things that we're not supposed to.
I don't miss anything about you anymore.
