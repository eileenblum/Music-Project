Whole world fall to knees
My steps never will stop
I saw too much filth
And i cannot give up

Iâll crush your fate
You will saw my hate
Stop this whisper in my head
i hate this silence (when)
Whisperâs born in head
When I do my steps
I can't see the end
For all that was already dead
I will fight until the end
My world which in my head
he had not died yet
for my world that in my head
I will fight until the end
Never become such as above
No one can save tormented soul
