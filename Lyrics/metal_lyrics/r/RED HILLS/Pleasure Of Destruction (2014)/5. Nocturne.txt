Fallen city Nocturne
City with mark of death
Who saw your greatness?
Greatness before the end!
No one will hear the cries
Cries of fallen by death
Thousand eyes of dead children
Watching you from the slitâs
What is your secret?
City with mark of death
What are the cries?
Which coming from depths
What was the purpose?
Purpose of all these murders
What was the reason?
Reason of all this deaths
Death, death is everywhere
Now here lives desperation
Echo of children's cry
Will be heard here forever

This earth is cursed
no one will be saved
These curse will get you, and even god will forget you
Fallen city Nocturne
City with mark of death
Who saw your greatness?
Greatness before the end!
No one will hear the cries
Cries of fallen by death
Thousand eyes of dead children
Watching you from the slitâs
