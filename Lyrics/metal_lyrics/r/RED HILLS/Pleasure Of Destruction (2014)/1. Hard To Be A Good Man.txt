Today it will be the end
And the gallows wait
I leave my shelter in the shadows
I have meeting with the gallows
Stop to blame yourself
try to feel my pain
You are all
Only foolish crowd
I have lost my soul
for your stupid needs
And in the end
I'm embrace with death
i Sold my soul for nothing
For got everything Iâve dreamed ofâ¦
They have lost their humanity
And now all gone
All my days all my feel
All my passion
All my love the time has come
gallows await me
The time has come
My sorrow is falling drowning in the crowd
drowning in the false pride
The time has come
I leave my shelter in the shadows
I have meeting with the gallows
