Empty eyes of sorrow
Empty so will never be
Weakness hands of proud
Weakness so will never be
Sight the sign, in the sky
Soon all will fall
This is fight without light
Your soul will burn
New age will be come
And you must be strong
Now and forever
Not afraid to be alone
You will see another fall
Soon or never
Itâs like the fever
One way to rescue, now or newer
Your soul will (be) saved
Forgot the lies about heaven
Empty eyes of sorrow
Empty so will never be
Weakness hands of proud
Weakness so will never be
Itâs like the fever
One way to rescue
Now or newer
Your soul will (be) saved
Forgot the lies about heaven
