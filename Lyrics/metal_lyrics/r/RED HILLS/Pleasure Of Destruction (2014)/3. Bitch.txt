Your death is my fault
Thus I closed your mouth
Cause you was so noisy
My dear Elis
Bitch!
I shudder from your voice
Stopped that fucking noise
Die for our feelings
Now or newer
Stop to crush my nerves
Shut up forever
Down, down deeper in the pit
I dig it so deep
My feelings so height
Itâs your grave my valentine
Down, down deeper in the pit
I dig it so deep
Down, down deeper in the pit
I dig it so deep
My feelings so height
Itâs your grave my valentine
Down, down deeper in the pit
I dig it so deep
