Pain moving to head
You cannot stop impending sorrow
But you can do this now
You will my chose
You scream my voice
Your fear my death
You gave last breath
Hold my hand, hear my screams
End is coming, end is coming
At this moment, all my fears
Disappears, disappears
Bullet crash the silence stop this suffer
Follow after midnight to the freedom
Flying through the dreams soul will forget the fears
Bullet crash the silence stop this suffer
Hold my hand, hear my screams
End is coming, end is coming
At this moment, all my fears
Disappears, disappears
For the pain for the fear
Bullet crash the silence stop this suffer
Follow after midnight to the freedom
Flying through the dreams soul will forget the fears
Bullet crash the silence stop this suffer
Suffer 
Pain moving to head
You cannot stop impending sorrow 
But you can do this now
