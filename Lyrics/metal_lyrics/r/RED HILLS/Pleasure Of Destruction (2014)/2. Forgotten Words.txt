Itâs your last day
And you will remember all your life
You will remember all misdeeds
You will remember all your sins
Donât forget who you are
Donât forget youâre amazed
Donât forget all sins
What you did once
Spit your blood from bleeding tongue
Stop your screaming about gods
Try to say with me this wordâs
And Iâll show you some new ways
In our world where
Godâs forget about us
Peoples make only worse
Donât be like mass
Be your self
Make this world better
Make peoples better
Donât forget who you are
Donât forget youâre amazed
Donât forget all sins
What you did once
In our world where
Godâs forget about us
Peoples make only worse
Donât be like mass
