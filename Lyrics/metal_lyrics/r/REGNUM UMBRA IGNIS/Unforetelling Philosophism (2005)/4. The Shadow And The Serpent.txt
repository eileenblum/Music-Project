[Lyric by Deathscythe, Music by Deathscythe]

The wisdomâs flame reveal
The shadow of a being wrapped in the silence of the soul
In a far-away and stare in the metamorphosis
That precede the matter and the moral.
Where the spiritual cold consume the remembrance of the
Past and the nightfall winds blows strongs
The time transcend the pain and the madness
Lifting his existential cause to reasonâs center.
From the mountain where no-other man returns of uncertaintyâs dip
behold appear from among mist the
serpent that reveal in a deep to look
a immense infernal valley to ecclesiasticâs eyes.
While the quest for something "beautiful" the torment confort
and burn the anguish... the times embed in despair
on sick and ancient soul with the emptiness heritage
and the illusion of a objective long time forgotten.
And the serpent disappear in the somber projection of a being
Without hopes or pretensions
There is nothing in your around just the absolute silence
Without doubts, without emotions... just he.
