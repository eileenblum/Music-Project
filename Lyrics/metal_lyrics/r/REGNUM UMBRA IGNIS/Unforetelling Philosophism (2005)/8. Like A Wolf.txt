[Lyric by Hellish and Deathscythe, Music by Deathscythe]

Exterminating the weakness with the wrath of the strongs
The katharsis will reborn in times of war
Into bloodies battlefields and
Donât in shame remembers of past mistakes.
One Unforetelling them
Those consumed by yours own words.
One in knowledge
Dethrone kings, fools idols of adoration.
Eclipse of reason... manipulators of lies
Into the emptiness of centuries like a hollow shell
Beholding through of insanes teachings
The precious points becoming power
The reality of that never bow it
The strong one... whose the hell proud it.
