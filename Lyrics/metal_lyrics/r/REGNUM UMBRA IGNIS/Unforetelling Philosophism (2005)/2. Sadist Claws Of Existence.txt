[Lyric by Morte, Music by Deathscythe]

Without to comprehend the reason that precede the unreal dreams
Insupportable pain zephyr of life!
Incredible is to walk in the obscures nights and
To feel in the dawn his singular crispness.
Dip in the despair and dream with me everything who would like to be...
Living intensely a void, no words neither gestures!
In the silence of doubt and in the certainty of truth
(We) will be the flesh and the bones deceased!
The likeness of empty... Unusual existence!
Like everything will can to be if we want...
Nothing will be equal, to who thinks to be truth!
And the empty god cry the tears that sprout of the dry tree
Whose endless of greed the same planted...
Dipped in my desires to live.
In times like these we born in the silence and in the doubt!
A unique human figure profane odyssey of flesh!
The life is just a dream where want to be real and
The death a slumber that never awaken.
Without end like indeed the desires of to be free from the sadists claws of god.
