[Lyric by Deathscythe, Music by Deathscythe]

One with many on soul only in the carnal world
Learning with the silence the forgotten wisdom
Living the night and see the creation
The intimate reflex in the moon eyes only in the universe
The lake in the solitude valley reveal
In my eyes the legion that I am...
Supreme destructionâs forces
In the shadow throne of serenity
Explosions of hate run in my veins
Thus like I search the perfection in war
Join the secrets that inhabit in my soul
I unveil the mystery of my journey.
