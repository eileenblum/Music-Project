[Lyric by Morte and Deathscythe, Music by Deathscythe]

So many times forsake to think with the reason
Believing dim and blindly in the esteem of someone else
Great changes are realized and all seem like before
A futureâs sight induce by forged discoveries
or feelings so frustrating like a cold touch of reality.
To live is a reality inebriated by the illusion of to exist
To exist an absolute desire... the infamous immortality
To live insât to exist...
Alone between everything concerning of this vast universe
Dying slowly with the time and everything significant.
The being is an unit between dreams and reality, desires and madness
Unlike in ideas that fade away with the time.
The life is taciturn and soon way ephemeral in excess
Like the truth that isnât eternal, in absolute!
Or the unbridled ideology into the nothing
Maybe the mistake be wait that the time all reveal
Being the Master of the own existence the changes are choices
Thus the Master are between the eternity and the nothing.
