[Lyric by Deathscythe, Music by Deathscythe]

Appear behind of yours empty words
hards until to your supreme empty mind
hidden by worshipers of incomprehensible to enlighten.
Blows to wind hearten words and dip in the courage that never was yours.
See the sickness to prosper in the heart of the truth
See it!!!
Relevants words said to impertinents are
Weapon on the hands of serfs of the uncertainty
Borned in the rotten womb of doubt.
The voice to that one who do not bow and
who wander by the world before your existence
Not is philosophal... is free!
Appear behind of yours empty words
Iâm the one! And who are you with all these words?
Who makes you supreme?
My transcendental existence conquering donât care
With the extirpation of eyes of a race that unknown
who see and in his mind create illusions to forget others.
