[Lyric by Deathscythe, Music by Deathscythe]

From hate to domination...
Treading on face of who by weakness did fall
Lacerating the wound that never will heal...
I shall raise my flag covered by blood
Turn worthy the losts and conquers
In the  path of glorification!!!
Retake control by brutal strength.
Broking the laws created by inferiors ( beings?! )
Marching with the holy landâs destruction.
The unmask illusion
In the beginning of battle.
Chaotics days of blood and fury
By a ideal.
Shall reveal the true face of Satan!!!
Extreme aggressivity destroying the universal fantasy
Dissolving the scoria that infect our battle
To elevate the purity of spirit... the temple!!!
From hate to domination...
Immortalizing the pain
Searching re-raise who today is look like bizarre
And in the deepness of time and warlike soul is noble.
The only strength of the past... of flesh... of temple.
When the honor was bigger than greed!!!
