[lyric by Morte and Deathscythe]

Oh! Those times that evanesced so fast
but I can see when outside did rain blood,
that turn us always lives always strongs,
and the leafs fall.. I see it falling... like we fallen.

Where to have the love sick my heart throb in hate,
and of the belly of a prostitute will born my son,
that will honor my hate always live... always strong,
and one more time my black blood will blasphemate
against the contradictions words of god.

God that capture my more sincere feelings,
I donï¿½t believe in your false love and senseless,
That turn me so unreal like your truth.
I will live forever without the peace of god...
I am the torment!

Despair in envy by my victories,
always fighting against yours bastards sons,
they prayer against me,
but in the end of times I drunk in chalice,
the blood of your blood,
of a crucified... in the flames of inferno!
Under of the strength of the hellï¿½s flames!

I dip in the mysteries of full moon that follow my steps
I believe, and I am, the defeat of your son,
crucified... that bleed like a bastard filthy.
I believe en the only god that move the infinities dimensions,
and to do shine the horizons more distants of the life.
