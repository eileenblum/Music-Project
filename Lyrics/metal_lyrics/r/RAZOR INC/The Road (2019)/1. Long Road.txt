You have got on the road for your journey, long time ago
To be the man of your dreams and achieve what you've wished for your goal
Walked day and night with your aching feet stepping on stone
With the light of the dawn you will know how far you've gone from home

Long gone, on a long road
Determined to break down your walls
You've gotta save your soul
Long gone, on a long road
Determined to break down your walls
You're gonna sing your song

You have got on the road for your journey, long time ago
You didn't know how hard was to be that far and to be alone
Being burnt by the sun and being shaken by winds of the night
With the light of the dawn you will sing your heart out from above

Long gone, on a long road
Determined to break down your walls
You've gotta save your soul
Long gone, on a long road
Determined to break down your walls
You're gonna sing your song

[Lead]

Long gone, on a long road
Determined to break down your walls
You've gotta save your soul
Long gone, on a long road
Determined to break down your walls
You're gonna sing your song
Breaking free and singing your song will save your soul
