I said I was set on my road,
Instead of standing still, alone in shivering night
Walked along the streets with a hope to see the light
Of the never-coming dawn

We were our flesh and our blood
Were dreaming the days that we would sing along evermore
Some of us went, some of us flew through the sky and
I am now moving away on my own

As each day and night pass me by
I'm searching the childish tears of joy
Under layers of dust
With an endless void in heart and now I know
I've already seen, already known and already lost
Against time that sweeps all that we love

Living a life with blank hope
In spite of moving but standing alone in shivering night
I said I was set on my road but all I do is to roam
To roam an aimless road

As each day and night pass me by
I'm searching the childish tears of joy
Under layers of dust
With an endless void in heart and now I know
I've already seen, already known and already lost
Against time that sweeps all that we love
And I keep searching under the layers of dust
With an endless void in hearts and now I know
I've already seen, already known and already lost
Against time that sweeps all that we love
