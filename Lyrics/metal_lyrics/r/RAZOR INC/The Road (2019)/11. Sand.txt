My heart is in my hands
There is a hole in my chest
I filled it with pure sadness
And buried the heart in the sand

There's no turning back

I quenched my thirst with its blood
'Til it's dry and colourless
I shed my tears to the hole inside
And stared at the desert's endless sky

The sky was blue but now it's grey
I shake within, in a ruthless fray
So I buried my heart in boiling sand...
This suffering, I tried to end
The heart... Kept... Pounding...
