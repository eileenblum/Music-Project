As time walks again, wounds will be healed
We'll become renewed,
We will feel just like we used to feel
Again

Time changed us once, we perceived then how but it was
Too late to return
We hurt each other with the harsh words that we didn't really mean
But hearts were broken anyway

As our time runs again time will heal
We'll become renewed and we'll forgive
The past
Yet it's so cold, the sorrow stays, in deep down
Inside the heart and it gets
Colder and colder while we hold our
Breaths inside as we live

We're the hearts of stone
Time cannot heal

Facing that the truth has mercy to no one and we are no one
Before the real
We hurt ourselves with the feeling that how worthless we were
Before the time we steal

As our time runs again time will heal
We'll become renewed and we'll forgive
The past
Yet it's so cold, the sorrow stays, in deep down
Inside the heart and it gets
Colder and colder while we hold our
Breaths inside as we live

We believe that we'll break the hearts of stone one day
