All of your days are passing by within the bore
Staying the night all alone inside a hole
Moaning all time, swinging feelings under siege
Grim pain you feel, like you're always in the wall

Send me your heart to be clean, to be fled from your decrease
I am the lighthouse of your sea of sorrow, you're sinking deep

Came to naught again,
I fell but I have made a stand so far
Don't you feel the pain,
I came along the way with open scars

Lend me your soul, if you wish, if you're feeling so much tired
I can repair, I can share, I can fight with your despair

You could feel that you've lost
And yearning of the days of joy
All could be fine

Came to naught again,
I fell but I have made a stand so far
Don't you feel the pain,
I came along the way with open scars

All could be fine, all is well in the end
All will be passed, when your heart will learn to stand
All could be fine, I'll be holding tight your hand
All should be well
