Meat on sale on the streets where we breathe
Cheap lives increase and the vultures feed
As we grew and thrived, felt the pressure more
Once we cheered ourselves but here is not safe anymore

Now we are trying to survive
Whole concrete city, we're inside
Sincerity has died in concrete hearts
All in all we lost

And there are no trees and parks, no clean air
In the end we see that no one cares

Now we are trying to survive
Whole concrete city, we're inside
Sincerity has died in concrete hearts
All in all we lost

To dream is the only thing we can
But minds have covered in dust and dirt
The skies are grey and filled with smoke
All trapped inside of the concrete walls

Now we are trying to survive
Whole concrete city, we're inside
Sincerity has died in concrete hearts
All in all we lost
