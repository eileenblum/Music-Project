Running on the streets to nowhere, running to reach nothing
Becoming the one who broke his shell, changing the fate
I feel strength

Carrying a heavy burden
I carried it for so long and now I'm freed
Can't you see, can't you feel?
I'm the shadow of all shades

Following all traces so that I can find peace and bliss
Got rid of this old bad habit, I cherish my new gist
I feel strength

Carrying a heavy burden
I carried it for so long and now I'm freed
Can't you see, can't you feel?
I'm the shadow of all shades

Rising up â another strife begins
Rising up â and all my fears dismissed
Rising up â I'm not lost anymore
Rising up â and my strength you will see

Carrying a heavy burden
I carried it for so long and now I'm freed
Can't you see, can't you feel?
I'm the shadow of all shades
