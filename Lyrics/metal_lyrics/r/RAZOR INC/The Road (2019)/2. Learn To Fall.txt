Found myself between the sky and the sea
I don't know how to reach the land
I live now between the real and the dream
And don't know how to wake the day

And if I can't make myself feel,
That what is false and what's real
I'll be lost evermore, I can't rise
But really know how to fall

Laying down I'm neither trying to reach
Nor searching a way to go ashore
I stay now between the night and the day
And I don't want to be saved

And if I can't make me feel,
That what is false and what's real
I'll be lost evermore, I can't rise
But really know how to fall

I see the sun shining, see the sun cry in tears
