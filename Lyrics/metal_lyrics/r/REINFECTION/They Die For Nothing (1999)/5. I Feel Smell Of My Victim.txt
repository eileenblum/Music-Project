I heard steps and beating of her heart
She escaped between trees screaming of fear
Avid for warmth and smell of dead woman
I strangled, exposed and admired her

Nudity of her dead body caused
That I couldn't prevent myself from
Leaving me semen inside her
Aware that nothing will grow of it

Smelling her moist pussy
I satisfied myself with her fresh smell
Kissing her cold lips
I was pulling entrails out

Taking away a part of her womb
I buried all her remains
Aware from the very beginning
That no one would feel her smell

She's dead [4 times]

...and no one can find her
