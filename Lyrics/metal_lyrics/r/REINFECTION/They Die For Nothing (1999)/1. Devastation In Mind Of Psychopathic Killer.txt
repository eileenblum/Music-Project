Gunk leaking through the cracks between the stitches
Dripping on the atrophied body and ashes of his tissue

Amputation is a madly exciting fact for you
And every little detail influences the order of your cut
You suffer from simplicity overtaking
Other's lives, other's lives

Your jealousy is much stronger and requires more victims

Each your movement was well thought out

The more victims, the longer you think what you really do

Too much blood
Too many dishes filled with human entrails

Your desire to be better came to extremes
The number of bodies is increasing

Next victims
Fear and increasing number of their bodies
Cause devastation in your mind
