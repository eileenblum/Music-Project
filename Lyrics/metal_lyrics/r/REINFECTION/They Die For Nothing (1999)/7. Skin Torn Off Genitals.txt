Feeling fear that excited him
And encouraged him to do this
He took out a coffin from unfinished grave

And opening it he saw
Fresh corpse of damp meat, sunken orbits
And green, half-rotted skin

This slow decay was so advanced
That is was difficult to distinguish
Whether it was male or female
Momentary desire to be in corpse's arms
Caused that nothing mattered for him
Saturated with morgue scent
He took out his knife and started to cut
The wholly retted skin of genitals
He tore it off to end everything
He closed the nailed it of the coffin
and then disappears like cemetery fog
Soaking into the soil during the rain
