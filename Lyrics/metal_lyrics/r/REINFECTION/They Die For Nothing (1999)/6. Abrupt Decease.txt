Exhausted and injured I was lying
In the puddle of my own blood
That flew down even from the walls
Terrible scream of slaughtered children
Who, helpless, were smashed with an axe
They were hanging down like puppets
With their entrails ripped

Distorted, gloomy seen
By my panic eyes
And mocked by my mind reality
Seemed to disappear as the life
Of my corpse-like body
Was disappearing

Screaming and crying didn't stop
But declined in the strangest way
Indescribable moment lasted

When a knife stabbed my body again

I feel asleep
