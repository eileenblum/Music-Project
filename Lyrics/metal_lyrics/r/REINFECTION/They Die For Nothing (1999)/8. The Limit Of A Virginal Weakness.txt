not aware of seriousness of this act
He strangled her spitting on his face
He grabbed a knife, excited
And cut her face to lick her blood

She lost her strength,
tears stopped dripping from her eyes
She fell down with trails of strangling
On her neck and lay with terror on her face
Her eyes turned towards him
Caused confusion and hear in his mind
He started to laugh
but his laughter changed to a panic cry
So ruthless but so weak
With virgin fear
he started to stab her body with a knife, Aimlessly
He felt he lost and she was free
He lay down besides her
Embrace her trembling and crying
