Odor and scent exciting the senses of lascivious women

Blood leaking straight from genitals
Tempts to rape a dead man
Lying on a cold table
In their visions a perverted,
revolting imperious intercourse
Satisfaction of power
Over a decaying, dissolving corpse
This rape causes schizophrenia in their minds
And forces to reach an orgasm by masturbation
Day by day they prefer dead
To the teeming with life
And the only reason
is the morgue full of rotting corpses
Where do these coarse penchants and unfulfilled wild desires come from?
Why?
Maybe they are filled with rotting bugs that eat their insides up cruelly

Day by day....
