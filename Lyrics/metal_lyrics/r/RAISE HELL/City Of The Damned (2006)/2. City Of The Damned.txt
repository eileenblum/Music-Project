Just like me and you
They're crawl around in dirt
Discussed by their own souls
Just waiting for it all to end
They're all waiting for the end

The city of the damned

Like zombies they walk
Without words they talk
Waiting for the ride
So they all can ride
To the dark
Where we are safe the cold
It's time to go

To the city of the damned
The damned
To the city of the damned

Like you and me
Without faces they strife
Like hollow skeletons
We walk out last mile
At last...
...at the city of the damned

It's time to go
To the city of the damned
The damned
To the city of the damned

They crawl in dirt
Like zombies waiting for the city
Of the damned
The damned
The damned
The damned
