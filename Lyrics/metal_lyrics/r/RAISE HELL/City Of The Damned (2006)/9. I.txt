It's starting to get a little lonely in here
But I always have you my friend
So shiny and cold, you always know what to say
You always been good to me

Reaching for my own hand
Drag myself and pulls me towards the abyss

I declare you guilty
Now you will have to pay with your life
It's your execution
You're guilty
So rise!
And take your final steps
Six feet to go

It's been a while maybe an hour or so
Twenty years or an eon who knows
What the hell did we do, explain it again
I'm guilty as one, but then...

Reaching for my own hand
Drag myself and pulls me towards the abyss

I declare you guilty
Now you will have to pay with your life
It's your execution
You're guilty
So rise!
And take your final steps
Six feet to go

Lights out
Satisfying their hunger for blood
Eyes shut
Falling deeper and deeper within
Show down
The spoken damnation of man
New crown
Worn by the rulers of the damned

I declare you guilty
Now you will have to pay with your life
It's your execution
You're guilty
So rise!
And take your final steps
Six feet to go

As they declared him guilty
And dragged him though the crowd
He looked up with a smile and laughing
Said: you all will follow some day
