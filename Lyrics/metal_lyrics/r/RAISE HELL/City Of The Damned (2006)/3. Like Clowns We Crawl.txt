While I keep reaching for my soul
You dig in deeper like a virus
We all came crawling from the cold
And now we struggle to survive
You keep on beating while I bleed
I gasp for breath when you are strangling me
So why even bother to go on
Pain will repeat it self again and again

That's why we fall, we fall down
I was made to crawl, I'm a clown
Take what you want and let me out
(Let me out)

I thought I've found my place to rest
But I guess I wasn't made to hide forever
It's a never ending game
So why fight in vain
Little by little I will crack
All my pleasure thoughts turns to black
So final battle's at the edge
Now I am ready to give in

Like clowns we crawl
That's why we fall, we fall down
I was made to crawl, I'm a clown
Take what you want and let me out
That's why we fall, we fall down
I was made to crawl, I'm a clown
Take what you want and let me out
(Let me out)
