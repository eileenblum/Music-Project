Can you see them
As they're walking by
Sadness in their eyes
Can you hear them
As they live to lie
The train keeps passing by...Alive!

Among the thousands
Here I'm in my seat
With tracks under my feet
Watch the horizon
Painted with our blood
Conductor's changing gear

The devil's station
Tapping out your blood
Drawing near
Getting closer

The dark revelation
Devil's station
Now appears... tonight!

The trip just ended
The mist of crying souls
Now surrounds us all
And as the rusty doors
Cracks and open up
I realize we're here

The devil's station
Tapping out your blood
Drawing near
Getting closer

The dark revelation
Devil's station
Now appears... tonight!
