Open your eyes, open your mind
Open your eyes... open your mind!

Broken down, deceived by liars
Why do you only fear them at night
Ferry tales of demons and fire
Created by ourselves mankind
We lived as liars since the dawn of belief
World of denial, why is it hard to see

You can't believe it
Self denial
You can't believe it...

Open your eyes
Can't you see they are trying to
Open your mind...
To the unknown
Open your eyes
Can't you see they are trying to
Open your mind...
To the unknown
Open your eyes to the unknown
Open your eyes to the unknown...

Illogical explanation
Look behind the human mind
Where we come to understanding
Of what's real, it's yours to find
The prophets say they obey reality
What to they know, what to they see
I call in truth they say it's insanity
What are you now, genius or fool

You can't believe it
Self denial
You can't believe it...

Open your eyes
Can't you see they are trying to
Open your mind...
To the unknown
Open your eyes
Can't you see they are trying to
Open your mind...
To the unknown
Open your eyes to the unknown
Open your eyes to the unknown...

Just a touch from a soul far away
Set off your fear
Why do you scream instead of communicate
Let them in, let them in, let them rip
Let them in, let them in
Let them in, let them in, let them rip
Let them in, let them in, let them rule

You can't believe it
Self denial
You can't believe it...

Open your eyes
Can't you see they are trying to
Open your mind...
To the unknown
Open your eyes
Can't you see they are trying to
Open your mind...
To the unknown
Open your eyes to the unknown
Open your eyes to the unknown...
