Outside the coffin it shouldn't be, it's a mystery
Made sure I nailed well and buried it with stones
I checked there was no pulse
So how can it be, is it haunting me
Hiding furthing inside my sacred sanctuary

Like nails scratching windows
The chills on my back drags me closer...

The ghosts I carry
Don't deny me again
Unsafe in a sanctuary

Now that it whispers from the dark into my soul
I come to realize it always been there, just don't know where
I look the gates well do what I can to keep it away
But still it's here now staring by my side

Like nails scratching windows
The chills on my back drags me closer...

The ghosts I carry
Don't deny me again
Unsafe in a sanctuary
