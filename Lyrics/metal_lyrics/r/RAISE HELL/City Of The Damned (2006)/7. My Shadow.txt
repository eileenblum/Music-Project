Staring eyes, we are paralyzed
Statues tremble with fear
Do you dare to turn around
To see if someone's there

We beg for mercy
But silence here will cry alone
Dying for nothing
Ripped apart my eyes getting dark

I'm a shadow
Dying for nothing hear the voices of doom
In search of my own soul
Lost in a maze we are the children of ever more
The screaming voices within
Waiting for the silent demands of mother earth
It must be consequence of my sin

We are hypnotized to never realize
That we're pray and nothing more
Planted here in this hunters cage
By the darkness in the core

We beg for mercy
But silence here will cry alone
Dying for nothing
Ripped apart my eyes getting dark

I'm a shadow
Dying for nothing hear the voices of doom
In search of my own soul
Lost in a maze we are the children of ever more
The screaming voices within
Waiting for the silent demands of mother earth
It must be consequence of my sin
