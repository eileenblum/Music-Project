There he waits for the doom
So alone in a store cold room
Chained and scarred he's bleeding for his anger

Set him free
He's the one that will speak your silence
Set him free
He's the one that will lead your vengeance
He's barely breathin'
And now they want his blood

While he speaks for all of you
Absorbs the pain they put him through
And finally he will be free forever

Set him free
He's the one that will speak your silence
Set him free
He's the one that will lead your vengeance

To fade and falling
The reaper's calling
Yesterday's brawling
Takes him down

Set him free
He's the one that will speak your silence
Set him free
He's the one that will lead your vengeance

To fade and falling
The reaper's calling
Yesterday's brawling
Takes him down
To fade and falling
The sinner's crawling
I hear them talking
Of how to make him taste the pain
