The while light approaches me
While trying to cover my eyes
But the phenomenon insists

Time rushes and reverse into the past
Is what there I was born?
In this deja-vu I thrown back
Back to the beginning of the end

I'm certain
He's raising again
Relieved of the burden
And soon it's you my friend
No!

Floating over my village in the cold
Watching myself through a mirror of time
All there is, is a black darkened hole
The beginning turns to end

I'm certain
He's raising again
Relieved of the burden
And soon it's you my friend
I'm certain
He's raising again
Relieved of the burden
And soon it's you my friend

I'm shaking, freezing, falling
Listen, he is calling
I'm shaking, freezing, falling
Listen, he is calling for you

I'm certain
He's raising again
Relieved of the burden
And soon it's you my friend
I'm certain
He's raising again
Relieved of the burden
And soon it's you my friend

As last he's come for you
