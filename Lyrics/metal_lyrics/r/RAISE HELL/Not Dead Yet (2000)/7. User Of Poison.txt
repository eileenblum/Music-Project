The rush in the body from the venomous drink
Makes you dizzy and makes it hard to think
User of poison, user of poison

All these venomous drinks turns you on
Cause it makes you feel like
You are the world dominator
The supreme creator
But not for long

You feel nothing when you hit the floor
You might as well wake up in the home of a whore
User of poison, user of poison

All these venomous drinks turns you on
Cause it makes you feel like
You are the world dominator
The supreme creator
But not for long

User Of Poison

Afraid of nothing when you enter the hall
Cause you know from before that you always stand tall
User of poison, user of poison

All these venomous drinks turns you on
Cause it makes you feel like
You are the world dominator
The supreme creator
But not for long
