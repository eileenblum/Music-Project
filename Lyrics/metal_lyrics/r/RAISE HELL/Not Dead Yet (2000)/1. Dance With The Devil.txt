I know what I want to do and I don't care what they say
I do what I want 'cause I'm the hunter and you are the prey

Come with me, come with us be a rebel

"Come with me and dance with the devil"
I'm the goddamned devil"
This job pleases me
Be a goddamned devil
This job will please you to

Do what you want to do and don't care what they say
I said you can do what you want 'cause you're the hunter and they are the 
prey

Come with me, come with us be a rebel

"Come with me and dance with the devil"
I'm the goddamned devil"
This job pleases me
Be a goddamned devil
This job will please you to

Life is short when reflecting of how long you will be dead
So live your life and do the things you never have done but always wanted to

Hey you what do you want to do
Hey you do like I do
Dance with the devil you to
Now dance or else you are a fool

"Come with me and dance with the devil"
I'm the goddamned devil"
This job pleases me
Be a goddamned devil
This job will please you to

Please you to!
