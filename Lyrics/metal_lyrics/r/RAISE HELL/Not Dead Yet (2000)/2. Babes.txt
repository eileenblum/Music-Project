I want you, I want you to tell me what you really can do
I tell you all I want is you
I got to, I got to show you what I like

Come on now baby
I like it when you light my fire
Come on baby take me higher
Together we can sin
Come on baby let me in

Come on now baby, that's what I like

You're so fine, won't you be mine
Always there in my mind
You're so hot, are you coming or not
Take my hand an be mine tonight

Come on now give me some

Come on baby give me a kiss
Give me something I truly will miss
So come on any how, any where, any time
Be mine, oh yes be mine

Come on now baby
I like it when you light my fire
Come on baby take me higher
Together we can sin
Come on baby let me in

Come on baby light my fire
I like it like that
Come on baby take me higher
I like it like that
Together we can sin
I like it like that
Come on baby let me in
