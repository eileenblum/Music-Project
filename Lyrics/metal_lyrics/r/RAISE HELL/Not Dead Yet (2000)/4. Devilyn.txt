At her first day in church with her fucked up kin
They could see her sin
She looked sick like never before
And back to church like this no more

A girl left her life in her sleep with this note
She wrote this was my dream
She laid there naked on the made bed
With her only friend witch was the end

Some years went by and the girl got mad
Believe it or not this girl was bad
She was like the devil in disguise
You could see it in her eyes

A girl left her life in her sleep with this note
She wrote this was my dream
She laid there naked on the made bed
With her only friend witch was the end
