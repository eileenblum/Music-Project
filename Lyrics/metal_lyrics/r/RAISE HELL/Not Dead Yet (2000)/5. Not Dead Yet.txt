When I feel your body next to mine
I feel so fucking fine
When I touch you, when I feel your heat
Then I can't wait until we start the beat

Can you feel it to my treasure
If you do give me pleasure

Isn't it the best if we do like this
Give each other something more than a kiss
Isn't it the best when it's like this

Once we've started this there is not stop
Come on now let us reach the top
Keep on going like you do
I know you like it to

Can you feel it to my treasure
If you do give me pleasure

I will use my most powerful spell
To put you in the hands of hell
I know your most sensitive spots
And you will never get rid of my powerful touch

Isn't it the best if we do like this
Give each other something more than a kiss
Isn't it the best when it's like this
