As I walk along the path to the gallows
They laugh at me and dishonour my name
In their eyes I steel and I'm a killer
But if they knew what they did when they sacrificed

Can't you see what they've done to me
I'm closing my eyes and I walk in the...

Fire!
Licked by the flames
I am your liar
Fire!
Pathetic fools
A dying choir
Liar!

Now that I've turned you will kneel my anger
You will regret the rope round my neck
No longer safe in this sanctuary where you used to dwell
Go ahead and run my vengeance will find you

Now you feel what they've done to me
I'm closing my eyes and I walk in the...

Fire!
Licked by the flames
I am your liar
Fire!
Pathetic fools
A dying choir

Now that you've tasted my anger
Would you believe what they say again

I'm closing my eyes and I walk in the...

Fire!
Licked by the flames
I am your liar
Fire!
Pathetic fools
A dying choir
