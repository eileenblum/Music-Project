Crowded horizons with silhouettes of soldiers armed to teir teeth
A great legion of demons spread their wings all over the earth
Their weapon the art of death rush through their blood
The word on their tongue ready to speak waiting for devil's command

Silver with nuclear powers
Power was given
Stormed from the sky
The missile crashed

Devils soldiers are running across the field upon a blackened beast
By every step they took a new life was ended
With only death on their mind, thousands in line
The stormed from side to side, through heaven with death in their sight

They crushed the heavenly sign, the sign of scripture
They crushed the heavenly gates and demanded god
Come out!

Killing the humans who stand below our race
With our superior powers we marched into the battlefield
Into the heart of goodness, the heart of god
The hearts that pounded too long strangled more and more
Strength was given into our hearts as goodness souls received our hate
Strength to overcome everyone

Now show us your hearts - stuck on a pole
A cross with Jesus' name - I forced you on
And so a crown of thorns upon your death

March for devil's word, the word of hate and destruction
March for devil's art, the art of death and chaos

Crowded horizons with silhouettes of soldiers armed to teir teeth
A great legion of demons spread their wings all over the earth
Their weapon the art of death rush through their blood
The word on their tongue ready to speak waiting for devil's command

Killing the humans who stand below our race
With our superior powers we marched into the battlefield
Into the heart of goodness, the heart of god
The hearts that pounded too long strangled more and more

Now show us your hearts - stuck on a pole
A cross with Jesus' name - I forced you on
And so a crown of thorns upon your death

Devils soldiers are running across the field upon a blackened beast
By every step they took a new life was ended
With only death on their mind, thousands in line
The stormed from side to side, through heaven with death in their sight
