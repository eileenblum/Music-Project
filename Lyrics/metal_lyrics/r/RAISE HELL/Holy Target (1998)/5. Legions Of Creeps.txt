You are down, down on your knees
For your believes of his fucking lies
Your existence will end
With your worthless comprehension

You blame us for being sinners
But the truth is that you are just too weak
To understand that you are

Too weak to make own rules
Too weak to follow your lust
Too weak to live by yourselves
Too weak to kill!

You live by the light of goodness in heaven
But we'll never follow you
We will show you the truth
You are just a legion of creeps

You are down, down on your knees
For your believes of his fucking lies
Your existence will end
With your worthless comprehension

You live by the light of goodness in heaven
But we'll never follow you
We will show you the truth
You are the biggest sinners of all!

Weak fucking sinners!
