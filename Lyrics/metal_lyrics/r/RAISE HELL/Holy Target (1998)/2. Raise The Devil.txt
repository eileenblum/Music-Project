I've walked this earth with hate and rage in my heart
For many years and many more

I can not resist to hate these living creatures
I must end their so-called lives

I spit out this hatred, this hatred I've carried too long,
Too long so they could spread their seed
Go through the roots, the roots of goodness
Make the flower perish
Reaping the fields with our seed
Your flowers will never appear

Only truth will remain, let hatred reign
It's for the devil to choose, let hell break loose
Ingenious I am, demolished you are
Raise the goddamend devil!

I looked in the past of a child, a child with rage in his heart
Once in his lifetime as the devil's child he opened his eyes so black
Blacker than night, darker and darker by time

Releasing my hatred inside!

Ingenious I am, demolished you are
Raise the goddamned devil!
It's for the devil to choose, let hell break loose

Only truth will remain, let hatred reign
It's for the devil to choose, let hell break loose
Ingenious I am, demolished you are
Raise the goddamned devil!
