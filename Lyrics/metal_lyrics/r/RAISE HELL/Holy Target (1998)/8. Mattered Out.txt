Sipping your wine during the blessed sacrament
Healing and feeling your weakness
Denying yourselves in the palace of enticing

The liar's abusement is the attendant's amusement

Suddenly a flash from the sky. Knock back
The sorms are coming closer
Throw yourselves under the trees of Eden

The flash will pierce your blinded eyes
The sores will be exchanged to reality
As soon as it mattered out your fantasy world

The shackles of the world will blow away
As rality whistles it's ouverture

The flash will pierce your blinded eyes
The sores will be exchanged to reality
As soon as it mattered out your fantasy world

Sipping your wine during the blessed sacrament
Healing and feeling your weakness
Denying yourselves in the palace of enticing

The liar's abusement is the attendant's amusement

Suddenly a flash from the sky. Knock back
The sorms are coming closer
Throw yourselves under the trees of Eden
