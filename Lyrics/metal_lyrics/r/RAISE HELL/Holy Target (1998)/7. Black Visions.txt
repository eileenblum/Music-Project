Black visions through my eyes, like tunnels in demonic laughter
One with the night, I crushed the gates into this dimension in red
With red bursting eyes - I stare so silent and cold
I kissed you goodbye, left you alone
Nightspirit, take me home

With wings on a track and stars by my side
We end on a higher level
Take my hand and come along

Black visions in my mind, like memories in bitter darkness
One with the night, I struggled to stay with the demons inside
With red bursting eyes - I stare so silent and cold
I kissed you goodbye, left you alone
Nightspirit, take me home

With wings on a track and stars by my side
We end on a higher level
Help me solve the cosmic black

Come along and let us escape
Into this voyage in rapture

Into a hole, something tears my flesh
Demonic beasts call my name
One with the night, stars by my side
I hunt for visions so black

With wings on a track and stars by my side
We end on a higher level
Help me solve the cosmic black
