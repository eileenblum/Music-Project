Let evil out, let madness swing through the air
Psychotic mind with lust to kill
Watch out for the blade of death!

Slice, with your tool
Kill, bring death to the fool
Slayer, you have done it again
Ripped them and killed them in vain

You are the master of knives
You are the controller of human lives
Don't feel sorry for those who have slithered
Into the arms of the red ripper

Into the woods hand in hand, leads you to his nest
No one will know where to find the rest
The knife in his hand waiting impatient to cut
You'll see, you virgin slut

Slice, with your tool
Kill, bring death to the fool
Slayer, you have done it again
Ripped them and killed them in vain

You are the master of knives
You are the controller of human lives
Don't feel sorry for those who have slithered
Into the arms of the red ripper
