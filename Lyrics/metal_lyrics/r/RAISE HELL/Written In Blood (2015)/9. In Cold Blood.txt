Blood, death, hate, forever in cold blood

Time stands still, can't even hear a sigh
Hatred is growing as life passes by
And then you open the gates and you make the leap
The leap into...
The world is crying desperately for light
In despair!

Blood, death, hate forever in cold blood
It's written: Blood grows hate
Forever in cold blood we crawl

Your last breath of air turns to smoke
Coughing out your enemies and meeting them eye to eye
You find yourself in a tunnel of razorblades you're running
It's a hopeless escape, a painful journey, eternally

Blood, death, hate forever in cold blood
It's written: Blood grows hate
Forever in cold blood we crawl
