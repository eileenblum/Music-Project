The devil in disguise never came to rest
The back alley shadows lurks in her nest
Waiting for the perfect night to fall
For the resurrection to devour us all

Seaching, seeking, stalking her prey
Burning the souls with insanity
Making them scream, making them cry
Pay with your lives, an eye for an eye

Praise the night, she will rise again
Embrace the flame of the blackened resurrection

Listen to the cries of the devil
Piercing every soul under her wings
Crying and bleeding, nailed to the wall
Make the true believers regret their call

She feeds, she drinks, she needs their fear
The urge for pain will always be there
Twisting the knives in your back
Pulling them out one by one by one...

Praise the night, she will rise again
Embrace the flame of the blackened resurrection...
