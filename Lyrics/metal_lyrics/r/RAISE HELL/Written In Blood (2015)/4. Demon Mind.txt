I'm collecting memories of pain
In a world that's darkened and hollow
The light's only there as a skin
To cover up the gloom that will follow

My claws are grasping for your soul
Violently I am inviting you
To my world where demons cry
I welcome you all

They call me demon mind
Walk through the river of flames in hell
Demon mind, where we suffer, where there's pain

I cut the smile off your face
Just to see that skeletal grin of yours
Making you see the beauty of it all
The beauty of my kingdom, the beauty of its fall

The clouds are shifting, the moon is turning red
You step into the world of the dead
Left behind all your perfect lies
I welcome you all

They call me demon mind
Walk through the river of flames in hell
Demon mind, where we suffer, where there's pain
