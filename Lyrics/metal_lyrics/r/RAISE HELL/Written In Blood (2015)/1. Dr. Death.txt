10 shots takes me to your kingdom,tonight will take me to hell
Searching creatures from the grave, crawls out from the dark
Dagger stabs right through my heart, fighting to stay alive
Cut in deeper, let me bleed, take me to your sanctuary

Piece by piece, please let me be
My life passes by
Lost in circles, insecure
Here he comes again
To get you...!

Fading, falling far beyond, dreams where nothing's real
Angels and devils before my eyes, fighting for their lives
10 shots take me to paradise, heaven will know my hate
Gates are closing, shut the lights, can't get out of this alive

Dr. Death what a bloody mess you made of me
Dr. Death, look what you did to me, I'm someone else

Piece by piece, please let me be
My life passes by
Lost in circles, insecure
Here he comes again

Dr. Death what a bloody mess you made of me
Dr. Death, look what you did to me, I'm someone else

Hang him higher, victim of belief, nailing them all to the cross
10 shots brought me to this victory, one more and I'm gone

Piece by piece, please let me be
My life passes by
Lost in circles, insecure
Here he comes again

Dr. Death what a bloody mess you made of me
Dr. Death, look what you did to me, I'm someone else
