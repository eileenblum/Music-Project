Welcome to the morgue, my simple quiet home
A place to rest in peace!

Eyes shut, my friends won't make a sound
So you should be sleeping well on the shelf I made for you

It's your final hour
Before you float away, river so deep, to burn in hell
This is your final hour
Before you leave this fire, for the ashes, enter the pain
You call him master
God won't be there, you're all on your own

I fill up your eyes with a shadow of your fears
Even though I told you a billion times
That this day was coming, you still look surprised

It's your final hour
Before you float away, river so deep, to burn in hell
This is your final hour
Before you leave this fire, for the ashes, enter the pain
You call him master
God won't be there, you're all on your own
Final hour...!
