You got dragged into the clouds tonight, I waited so long
You fell that day that Christ was born, piercing your wings on the crown
You build yourself a prison cell for eternal sleep
Only memories will remain here, of your nightmare...

Lost, hollow minds obey the one, the rest just follows
They lick their wounds of madness, but forever they will bleed

Seems like our destiny's manipulated
The father, the son and the holy ghost
Decapitated our souls

Fear, signs of danger in the night in the land of the silent
Hell comes together with the perfect dawn
The straps from our hands break!

Seems like our destiny's manipulated
The father, the son and the holy ghost
Decapitated our souls

As the dreamers swallow all your lies
Fairy tales of sorrow built my despise
You cannot see me because I'm real
I'll be here waiting for you... To kneel

Cries end the chorus of this night, no more silence
Tears, tears of blood fills up your eyes in this fallen domination...

The father, the son and the holy ghost
Decapitated our souls
