Attack, heart attack so deadly
The strike came from behind
It all went black, soul so black
With open arms I greet him

I hear the bell of the reaper
I fear the bell of the reaper...

Alive, still alive, not dead yet
But his grip around my neck is so tight
Soon to die
I hear him ring the bell of the reaper

Hell, here I dwell so lonely
Burnt by the eternal flame
Pain, feel the pain
Upon the altar of sacrifice

Now I ring the bell of the reaper
Now I am... The bell of the reaper
