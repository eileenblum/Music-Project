I've been searching the world for a scapegoat
To find out why just you had to die
Why the starving children is crying
And why the blood flows from my wrists

Thank you God for bringing death to this world
For creating torture
Thank you God for the beautiful scars that I war
Thank you God

I have learned I can kill for pleasure
Rape for fun and lie to my closest allies
While I have my fun you've got my back
I keep my trust in you my friend

I've seen the true tellers disbelieved and crucified
I've seen a breaastfeeding mother decapitated
The homeless man, laughed at and ignored
But it's all right as long as we wear the cross

Thank you God for bringing death to this world
For creating torture
Thank you God for the beautiful scars that I war
Thank you God
