Strongest army, no one can stop us now
Our fire power will take you down
So drop your guns and surrender now while you can

I was told I was indestructible but now my creations fall apart

One by one they're shot down to the ground
My soldiers nowhere to be found
I realize that I am left out here to die

We arise, termination
Skeletons of destruciton
We arise and in the end we're the ones who wear the crown

Lines of fire is lightning up the sky
Storms of smoke before my eyes
Can't remember why I'm out here dying in the dark

We stand in front of the enemy lines
Stare into their darkened eyes, here they come they rise

We arise, termination
Skeletons of destruciton
We arise and in the end we're the ones who wear the crown

Skeletons of destruction, we arise
Wear the crown of destruction... Of destruction!

Sirens howling in the night
Not a chance to see the light
Bones are braking and the taste of shattered lives

I was told I was indestructible but now my creations fall apart

We arise, termination
Skeletons of destruciton
We arise and in the end we're the ones who wear the crown
