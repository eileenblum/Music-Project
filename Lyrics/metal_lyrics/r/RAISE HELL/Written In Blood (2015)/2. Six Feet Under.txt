Souls of the broken dreamers are making their final march
Watched by the eye of the raven, like a predator and prey
Long enough they have wandered on the face of earth
Long enough they have worked as a big disgrace of man

Master, fallen angel
Madness, voices, echoes from the grave
Master, burning slayer
Six feet under

Judas has awakened with vengeance by his side
Alone in a small minority a trooper holds his ground
The ashes of his fathers keeps his eye open wide
The memory of his mother makes him lift the sword again

Master, fallen angel
Madness, voices, echoes from the grave
Master, burning slayer
Six feet under

Stranger even though I felt him my entire life
Always called for me like a shadow by his side
Fools, your eternity is drowned in flames
Savior, oh sweet death I'm reaching out my hand

Master, fallen angel
Madness, voices, echoes from the grave
Master, burning slayer
Six feet under
