Wherever you may go
faces of ghosts always appear
Whatever you may do
you sense that they always are near

You are in here
in a cradle of fear
They are in there
never-ending nightmare

[Chorus:]
This is the haunted house
in here your cries will not be heard
This is the haunted house
and they will never let you go!

In here parnormal rules
They are getting closer to you
too bad you're tied up by chains
and no time remains

You are in here, in a cradle of fear
They are in there, never-ending nightmare

[Chorus]

Make the demons go away
I'm in hell and here I will stay

[Chorus]
