Nothing you offer is fine with me
I live my life with no guarantee
Taking day by day by myself
keep the thing you say to yourself

[Chorus:]
I look at you with despise in my eyes
You tried to tease
but you only released the devil in me

Devil may care!

Why don't you have a closer look
on why you live your life after a book
I don't have to read the pages
I write new ones as they come to me

[Chorus]

Now you regret it
I'm sorry you didn't get it
Now you realize it
Your life ain't worth shit
When the damage is done

[Chorus]
