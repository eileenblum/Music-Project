When you think your day is over
he will wait for you
He will spy on you
watches you go by

He's a stranger in the night
A night-watcher
Follows every step you take
Is there a night-stalker?

[Chorus:]
Something is by the trees
A Night-Watcher
Something is in your way
A Night-Watcher
Never turn your back at
the Night-Watcher
He waits for your every night

He is something you can not describe
He's a stalker always have him behind you at night
Don't look back now, cause he's coming
Run for your life or die!!!

[Chorus]
