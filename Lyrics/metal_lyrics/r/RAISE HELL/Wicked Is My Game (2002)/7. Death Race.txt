All lined up waiting for the gunshot to start the race
All engines powered up, there is no return

Feel the thrill of the speed, this is a Deathrace
Screaming wheels in the night, this is a Deathrace

[Chorus:]
Wipe the dirt of your shoes, it's madness let loose
Wipe that smile of your face, this is a Deathrace

Push your beast to the limit, faster and faster you go
It's power pulls you back against the seat
I hope you know what you're doing

Feel the thrill of the speed, this is a Deathrace
Screaming wheels in the night, this is a Deathrace

[Chorus]

Chased, but you feel safe
By steel you are embraced
Lights in your eyes
Caught you by surprise...

Crashed into a wall, you lost control, you failed
You paid the price, you learned what you might face
In a Deathrace

All lined up waiting for the gunshot to start the race
All engines powered up, there is no return

Feel the thrill of the speed, this is a Deathrace
Screaming wheels in the night, this is a Deathrace

[Chorus]
