The first time every thing was fine
The oracle foretold me
The second time I was told about things
Happiness no more

God won't be there for you
Prayers to him will be in vain

[Chorus:]
Why will this happen to me?
It's all in your destiny!
What can I to prevent this?
Nothing!

The next night I couldn't sleep
cause Death was knocking on my door
A bullet through my brain will help me
change my destiny

Destiny Deceiver
Destiny can't be deceived

[Chorus]
