On the other side of our dimension
where the truth has no name
there is pain for you and me
It's been after us for all of our lives
I've seen it all in my dreams
now that I know the end is near

It has been after me
trying to make me see
It drives me to insanity
It all has to end...

[Chorus:]
Father, what's coming next?
Disaster, followed by death!
Forsaken by lies

Am I the only one who discovered
who found the other side?
There is a truth about everyone
the freedom of speech is hard to bear
I've seen it all on this side
and I've watched it all with fear

You have been after me
trying to make me see
It drives me to insanity
It all has to end...

[Chorus]

I'm giving in, I'm letting it go
I'm losing it, I'm losing control
I want to know the truth no more
Please lie to me again...

[Chorus]
