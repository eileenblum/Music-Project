You hear him whisper from the shadows
don't let your inside show
He needs your dark side to get free
don't let the dark one grow

Digging deeper
getting closer
Sins is on what he breeds
Hell no, don't let him feed

You hear his enticements in your head
You fear them laying in your bed
Don't let him convince you

[Chorus:]
Don't follow his desire - He's born in hell
Don't follow his lies - He's born in hell
Don't listen to his calls - He's born in hell
Don't listen to his demands - He's born in hell

Waiting for the perfect time to strike
with patience as none alike
as hard as he may try
don't listen to his lullaby

He's the one who will make you do evil deeds
It's your body that he needs
Powered by your darkest side

[Chorus]
