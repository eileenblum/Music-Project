You want to know what's wrong with me?
I'm not sure you want to see
You want to know what's wrong with the world?
My world is nothing like yours

A nightmare for you, is joy for me
torture for you, is heaven for me

I know what's wrong with you
you're afraid to lose
I know what's wrong with your world
If you don't scream you will never be heard

A nightmare for you, is joy for me
torture for you, is heaven for me

[Chorus:]
Don't play something you're not
Don't think that you're someone else
Don't think you're the cream of the crop
Don't, cause you know you're not

You are... in my cell...

Can't you see what it's going to be
You live a life in misery
Don't you try to be the one
Take a look in the mirror, you are nothing

You're nothing
torture for you, is heaven for me

[Chorus]

Making you wait for what I create
Just you wait for my wonderful hate
I get a thrill from the way that I kill
Your last will I won't even fulfil

[Chorus]
