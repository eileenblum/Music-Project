We're born blind, there's nothing than black
When your journey ends, that state comes back
While we're waiting for the endless night
We'll watch how fade the last strips of light

So... everybody dies alone
Life has no purpose on its own
We are all on the way just to the end
Deep into the void our souls will blend
You may pray to... something beyond
But you'll never have respond
Life's the one you truly love,
But with death you'll spend aeons and above

Life's a bitch,
Call it by the name
Whatever gives you
Gonna take what you've reached

This bitch will leave you finally
Take everything you have
The more you wanna live
The more you gonna lose

Betray you
Forsake you
She hates you
She's in you
Rest in dust

One day ill disappear
I'll be gone, like a dream
When you're awake
So, like a fetus before its born
I don't give a fuck if I would live or die

Eight billion lives will fade in 100 years
After the salty rain of tears
Dig into the mud to be forgotten
Dirt, the place where dreams are rotten
Ideas you so deeply care today
Like thrash, will be thrown away
The truth we have to to face
Life is the pure act of waste

Life's a bitch,
Call it by the name
Whatever gives you
Gonna take what you've reached

This bitch will leave you finally
Take everything you have
The more you wanna live
The more you gonna lose

Betray you
Forsake you
She hates you
She's in you
Rest in dust

This bitch will leave you finally
Take everything you have
The more you wanna live
The more you gonna lose

Betray you
Forsake you
She hates you
She's in you
Rest in dust
