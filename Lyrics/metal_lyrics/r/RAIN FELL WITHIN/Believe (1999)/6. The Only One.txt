[South American Bonus Track]

As quickly as the days have passed. Like falling tears.
As cold as fall's dead rotting grass, are these last years.
Thoughtless, I know.
Staring in silence.
Timeless, I know.
Standing in darkness.
And I see their bodies mangled on the ground.
And the screaming will haunt me.
For now, death all around. Can you hear me?
Or am I the only one?

The only one!
Please make this only a dream!
The only one! It was an unfair fight.
Could not run from the light.
Why I'm alive, I do not know.
Will I survive? Where will I go?
And I see their bodies mangled on the ground.
And the screaming will haunt me.
For now, death all around.
And I cry out, but I am the only one!
The only one!
Please make this only a dream!

The only one!
Please make this only a dream!
The only one!
The war has left only me, The only one!
