The light has grown dim, another day turned to night.
Your tears meet my lips as you hold me tight.

My body is getting weaker and I wish the sun would brighten up the sky.
I thought I'd see a light before the end but all I see is cold and dark.
My body is getting weaker and I wish the sun would brighten up the sky.
I thought I'd see a light before the end but all I see is cold and
dark...besides you.

Thelight has grown dim, another day turned to night.
Your tears meet my lips as you hold me tight.

My body is getting weaker and I wish the sun wold brighten up the sky.
I thought I'd see alight before the end but all I see is cold and dark.
Oh, you hold me even closer now. I see nothing at all. With you I cry my last tear.
