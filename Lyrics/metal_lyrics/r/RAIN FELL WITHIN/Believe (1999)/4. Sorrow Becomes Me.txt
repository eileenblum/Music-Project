Through the night, follow me; I will lead you to safety.
In your arms I'm complete and in your eyes I find peace.

Must you go so soon? Can't we embrace?
Until the night is through, forget the danger we face!
In my emptydays alone, I can't eat and I can't leave home.
Oh my heart longs for you to hold me as only you do!

Sorrow becomes me! Please ease my pain.
When you leave me, I go insane!

"Sit down, close the door. Your soul is mine forevermore!
You will do whatever I say. Tonight you die to take the pain away!"

Oh, I cry for the one that I lost and I feel for the soul that needs me.
But I can't be someone that I 'm not. Even though I can't bear you to leave.
Oh, my love you are so far away and it seems we are two worlds apart.
Though I fear in the end you won't stay. Only you can mend this broken heart.

Oh...until I am with you...
Oh my heart still breaks.

Sorrow becomes me on this quiet evening.
I've crept so slowly into your room, where you're not sleeping...
Knife in m hand, one last breath...
I say goodnight and share your death.
