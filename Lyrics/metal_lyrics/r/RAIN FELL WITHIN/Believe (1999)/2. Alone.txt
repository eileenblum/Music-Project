I see your face as they carry you away. Now you are gone and I am alone.
Alone, searching for you, will I ever find you?

Lost, eager to return to thee. Fevered and mourning. Tell me I'm not dying.
I lay in the cold winter rain, shivering and bleeding, I long for peace.
See the snow hide my face, am I free from the chase?

Lost, eager to return to thee. Fevered and mourning. Tell me I'm not dying.
I lay in the cold winter rain, shivering and bleeding, I long for peace.
Ah, my stealing love Oh is all you'd done...

Alone, searching for you, will I ever find you?
And I'll follow every footstep, search through every lead, hoping my next step leads to thee.
I will follow every footprint, search through every lead, until my next step leads to thee.

My heart will lead me: I will trust my lonely heart.
Oh my heart deceives me! Are we meant to be apart?
Alone, searching for you. Will I ever find you?
I see your face as they carry you away. Now you are gone and I am alone.
