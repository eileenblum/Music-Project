Into my imagination, into my pulsing veins.
Within my aching heart, you seem to ease the pain.

Just one more cut through my skin
And I can feel my life begin!
Here there's more pleasure than pain,
I see things never meant to...

See my imagination, into my pulsing veins.
Within my aching heart you seem to ease the pain.

And I see the damage you are doing,
but I can't seem to escape this false reality!
But I will not be fooled by your lying eyes!
I find it so absurd, you think you're in disguise.
And you say to me that I am your destiny...
But where will you be tomorrow?
