Only in my dreams could a place like this exist.
All the flowers are in bloom eternally.
See me,my hands reach for the sky.
I'm dancing in the sunlight,and in the distance,
the clouds pass me by...leaving me behind.
But does the rain ever fall?
Take me by the hand and show me what I'm overlooking.
Joy doesn't exist here at all
Tell me where it lies without pain, without sorrow.

See me,my hands reach for the sky.
I'm dancing in the sunlight.
And in the madness,I dream of my life that I left behind.
Only in my dreams do you hold me this tight.
And when I awake and open my eyes the vision fades.
But does the rain ever fall?
Take me by the hand and show me what I'm overlooking.
Joy doesn't exist here at all
Tell me where it lies without pain,without sorrow.

Nothing is left inside this heart of mine.
Nothing is left inside me.
Nothing is left inside this heart of mine.
Nothing is left inside me.
But does the rain ever fall?
Take me by the hand and show me what I'm overlooking.
Joy doesn't exist here at all
Tell me where it lies without pain, without sorrow.
