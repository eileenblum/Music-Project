Sail to me,set me free
from this curse that ails me
Is my face familiar?
Does my voice hypnotize?
Let my words confuse you
as the tide pulls you in
Come to me gently
Feel my breath upon your neck

Welcome my friend
my island has been waiting for you
My song has been sung a thousand times
This time you'll stay forever
Welcome my friend
my island has been waiting for you
My song has been sung a thousand times
This time you'll stay forever
forever...

Come to me gently
Feel my breath upon your neck
Is my face familiar?
Does my voice hypnotize?
Let my words confuse you
as the tide pulls you in

Welcome my friend
my island has been waiting for you
My song has been sung a thousand times
This time you'll stay forever
Welcome my friend
my island has been waiting for you
My song has been sung a thousand times
This time you'll stay forever
forever...

Take this gift i give for you
I'll end this life for endless life

You see through me
and you turn away
And my beauty
won't make you stay
I will burn here forever

Sail to me,set me free
from this curse that ails me

Welcome my friend
my island has been waiting for you
My song has been sung a thousand times
This time you'll stay forever
Welcome my friend
my island has been waiting for you
My song has been sung a thousand times
This time you'll stay forever
forever...

Oh just go and sail me away
More will come to take your place...
