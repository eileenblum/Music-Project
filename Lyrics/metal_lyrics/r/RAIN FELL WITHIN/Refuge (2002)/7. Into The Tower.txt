He reaches out to her for the last time
He's an arrow and his target he won't miss
We are only here for a short time
But i didn't know it could end like this
There he stands as helpless as a bird in flight
Their dark faces show no tears
for their victim's eyes
He reaches out to her for a final time
and he knows in the tower he will die...

He feels his heart escape his body
Moments pass that feel like years
He sees his life flash before his eyes
Memories that mean more now...

Into the tower while the world stands by
Watching in horror,let us cry
Into the tower while the world stands by
Watching in horror,let us cry

He feels his heart escape his body
Moments pass that feel like years
He sees his life flash before his eyes
Memories that mean more now...

He is as far as a bird in flight
Their dark faces show no tears
for their victim's eyes
there is no more time
to be thinking twice
No more chances to fight back
or to say goodbye
What seems to be much faster
than the speed of light...
They are soaring
through the bluest and the clearest sky
When the rush comes
crashing to a sudden stop
We're a frozen unity
of consistent shock

Into the tower while the world stands by
Watching in horror,let us cry
Into the tower while the world stands by
Watching in horror,let us cry

If we don't all lose our minds
and stands together,
we may survive the end of time,
live for the better
They can't destroy our beliefs,
they can't take our pride
They are the wrong,
they are the weak and we will live on
we will live on...

Into the tower while the world stands by
Watching in horror,let us cry
Into the tower while the world stands by
Fighting for our lives,for our pride
Into the tower while the world stands by...
