All my dreams,I want to share with you.
Every breath and every sigh...
All your dreams,I want to be there though.
You are and always will be my life.
But time changed you,and I stayed the same,
and time changed your your heart,
why do hearts change?
For many nights now,I've been in the dark.
I'm hiding in my head,and I'm so far gone...
What makes you think you can brake my heart?
What gives you the right you tear me apart?
I wander where you are,and who's in your arms.
And you think of me,or where you belong.
Every word that you say echoes in my head,
and I trusted those words with every ounce of me.

What makes you think you can break my heart?
What gives you the right you tear me apart?
Remember all of those times when you held me tight,
and looked into my eyes all through the night?

What makes you think you can break my heart?
What gives you the right you tear me apart?
I'm torn apart.
I can't seem to hold on to my sanity.
You swore that in your life there was only me.
Only me...

What makes you think you can break my heart?
What gives you the right you tear me apart?
I'm torn apart.
