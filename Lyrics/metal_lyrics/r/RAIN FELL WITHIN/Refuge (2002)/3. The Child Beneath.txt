All of my life,I've been harassed.
And just when I thought it was over,you brought it back.
With all your hate and all your lies.
And you point the finger at me as you hide in your disguise...
But I see the child beneath.
Still dreaming of things that have never come true.
You see what I've made of myself,
and you believe in your mind
that I couldn't be wiser than you...
You fool.
All of my life,I've been harassed.
I guess because I have something that they have lacked.
I look around to the people who care and smile.
Rather than waste my time
on those who don't know me at all...
And I see the child beneath.
Still dreaming of things that will never come true.
You see what I've made of myself,
and you believe in your mind
that I couldn't be nicer than you...
You fool.
And i see the child beneath.
Still dreaming of things that will never come true.
You see what I've made of myself,
and you believe in your mind
that I couldn't be wiser than you...
You fool...
