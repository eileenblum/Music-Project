I think I see beyond your eyes,your lies.
I will not let it get to me.
I am much stronger than you think I am.
My path I'll choose,don't try to lead me.
You claim to know me.It is I who know you.
I will prove you false.I am in the knowing of you.
You claim to know me.It is I who know you.
I will prove you false.I am in the knowing of you.
When you take off the mask,I'll see your face.
It's not that I can see through,but that you are fake.
You hide behind a mask others don't see.
I know there is a darker side.
I can't quite unveil the truth of you.
But I am sure something's not right.
You claim to know me.It is I who know you.
I will prove you false.I am in the knowing of you.
You claim to know me.It is I who know you.
I will prove you false.I am in the knowing of you.
When you take off the mask,I'll see your face.
It's not that I can see through,but that you are fake.
When you take off the mask,and I know you will...
They will all see your face and be in the knowing of you.
