She glitters in the mist,
and colors fills my eyes.
I'm waiting for the sun to rise.
It was so long ago when she last
showed her face
I almost thought she burned away...
Burned away,and let me lifeless...
Scattered into the horizon

I'm waiting for the sun to rise
and take my breath away
She disappeared some years ago,
after a violent rain
She took a thousand souls with her
and here I still remain
Not sure if I'm alive or dead,
and I don't really care

Oh I can see her now
shine through the clouds like heaven
and only for me
And i can feel her now
pierce through my heart with her fire
and burn me away
Oh I can see her now
shine through the clouds like heaven
and only for me

Leave me lifeless
Make me one with the horizon
I feel the sand beneath my feet,
the tide caress my skin
I hear the waves crash on the shore,
and here I feel at peace
Her warmth beats down upon my face
and causes me to grin
Rich tapestries of blue and red,
she paints across the sea

Oh I can see her now
shine through the clouds like heaven
and only for me
And I can feel her now
pierce through my heart with her fire
and burn me away
Now,I am one with her
my heart is filled with fervor
and I burn away

I am amongst the mist
and color fills my my eyes
and slowly I begin to rise
It was long ago that I last felt alive
I should have known that I had died

Oh I can see her now
shine through the clouds like heaven
and only for me
And I can feel her now,
cut through my heart with her fire
and burned me away
Oh I can see her now
shine through the clouds like heaven
and only for me
Now I am one with her
my heart is filled with fervor
and burned away.
