Stakes aflame it's time
Sworn to the unspoken oath
Absurd tongue 
Fainted eyes
Raise this knife through me

Cut deep
Deeper
Crown this corpse

Heresy now shall spread
Straight from the womb of madness
Deeds I've nothing to atone for
Contagious patrimonial pest

I'm there each time you pray in my name
I mock when witches chant your funeral words
I laughed when dogs sucked you rdy
Possessed now I own you

Still all stakes burning for me

Born in the grave of hope
A monarch in holocausting throne
Command of fire and death
Morbid gospel
All life to dust
