With clenched teeth I stalk God's madness
Gifted with blindfolds charisma
Should I dig out my eyes
A dogma begins
And Satan was there

Mouldy the air you breathe
Feasting on venomous prey
The sacred tumor won't let you see
What lies beneath this palace

Thieves of abyss
Bring forth all sacred gold
Ancient blacksmiths
Treasures turn to war
Sing with angels
Songs of morbid cult
Cursed be your tombstones
Unrest to lay forever

Forever to smite in death's own tune
Forever to burn in fires of heresy

Cursed be your forehead
Cursed be your womb
Cursed be your shoulders
Cursed

Hail Realism
Hail Fanatism
Hail Revenge
