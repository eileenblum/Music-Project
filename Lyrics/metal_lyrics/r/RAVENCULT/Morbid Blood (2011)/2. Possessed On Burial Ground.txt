Tonight the black moon lurks
Shadows move they dance they hide
Ancient gospel of the unblessed
Listen and tremble
My fate is sealed

Possessed on burial ground
The oath I took
Possessed on burial ground
I'm undead I cannot die

Stand in awe
Ecstatic breath
Ruthless eyes
Abyss calls
Burial ground
Torces high
I'm reborn
The only one

Possessed on burial ground
Possessed

Beyond the gates of your world
Lies a secret from the unknown
This curse will kneel you to death
The urge to cut your mortal flesh

Possessed on burial ground
The oath I took
Possessed on burial ground
I'm undead I cannot die

Sacrifice this skin for knowledge
It's clear and I can see
Black moon this holy night
I sold my soul and now I'm free
