Deep in the veins of this earth
In solace we're breathing for ages
Underground unearthly seed
Aborted through past congregations

A servant walked the era of kings
Bind in eternal lust and chaos
Serpent's son
Father of rats
His names of damnation now summon

Commence the orgy
Desecrate at will
To carnage we ride
Through winds of damnation

Violently baptized in sanctity's deep well
One by one got damned 
Again and again
Walk in peace
Carrier of pest
Word sinks
My last breath

To carnage we ride
Through winds of damnation

Serpent's son
Father of rats
His names of damnation now summon
