Forged in a world of decay
I've no remorse
My blood is cold
I walk through the underworld a fiery path
Inhale the black smoke in this tomb

Sense the pounding from beyond
The sound of ultraviolent force
Prepare yourself the time is now
Razorbalde knife to fuck this world

Forged in the bowels down below
I have no pulse
My blood is cold
Walk through the desert is the only way
Inhale the black smoke in this tomb

Ready to kill

This abyss underneath my skin is vast
Since morbid times it tunes in hideous sounds
Like sledged beast that's roaring from the past
I heed the call and here I stand

Rise through this living hell in mayhem and decay
Onslaught has begun
I chose this bloody way

Ready to die
