Around your aura 
Stench and healy
Snakes crawl!

Since my poison is tempting
Inexpressible my shape
When the seven coffins dance
Bells toll for you and me
I'm like no other
But walk among you
Snakes crawl!

Crawl with me I'll teach you
The art of betrayal and monstrous craft
The ways to cause the bitter cancer

No fruit is forbidden and lust unpresent
Feast at your own sick flesh
Quenched with blood envenomed
Once you've followed
There's no return
