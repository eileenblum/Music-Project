I got morbid blood
I know it runs inside of me
Pure and mighty
A magic spawn
A glorious birth

The breed of the cursed I always knew
Morbid blood runs inside of me
Eternal life I got alone in falls of venom
Eternal live in falls of venom

Morbid blood
So few against countless
Morbid blood
The bloodshed never ends
Morbid Blood
A handful versus thousands
Morbid blood
Surrender or fight til death

I got morbid blood
And you're the living dead
Oh the living dead

And how can I oppose this galaxy of fools?
A martyr serving madness
Heart of stone
Salvation through doom

Morbid Blood
So few against countless
Morbid Blood
The bloodshed never ends
Morbid blood
A handful versus thousands
Morbid blood
Surrender or fight til death
