Tentacled priests
With baphomet's blood
To the horncrowned demise
We pray

Atrophic lands
With leprous life upon
Through stillborn screams
We leave behind our seed

The horncrowned demise
Its stench you shall breathe
With hunger in eyes
Fates to be sealed

I call the clouds together
Enshadowed the ring of the moon
Winged one through whirlwinds
Who bears the cloak of bones
Witchcraft breathing in his hands
Eighteen hands raised towards the sky
As pest awaits to arrive

The flavour of torments bitters your tongue
In oceans of sulphur
To get drowned
To the death
