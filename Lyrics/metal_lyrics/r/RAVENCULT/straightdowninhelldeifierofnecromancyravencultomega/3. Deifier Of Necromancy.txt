[performed by Ravencult]Leaving the void graves behind
The moon and I have seen this death
Resistance this dead skin alive
And it's deathbreath reigns again
Black spells circle my dust through whirlwinds
Take me from this hole
Black spells awake the seas
With hungry waves drown them
Black spells circle my dust through whirlwinds
Take me from this cenotaph
Black breath spell
Leaving the void graves behind
The moon and I have seen this death
Resistance this dead skin still alive
Baphomet's deathbreath reigns again
