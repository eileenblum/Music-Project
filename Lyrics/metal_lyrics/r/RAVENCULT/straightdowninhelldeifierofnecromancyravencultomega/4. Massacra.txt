[performed by Ravencult]
[originally by Hellhammer]In moments of reflection
It all unfolds to me
I walk down through my mind
And feel a bittercold fear
What mankind did with pretence
Of religion and belief

Away is the sun
Endless the night
Mankind's massacra
Intelligence is dead

There have been satanic rites
In blood, inverted crosses
