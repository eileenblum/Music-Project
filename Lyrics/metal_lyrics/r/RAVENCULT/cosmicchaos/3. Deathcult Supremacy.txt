In this land without winds
They wont ever, ever dream
They are the blind they cant see
They are just here to serve destiny
They cant find to defend
The creation that will bring the end
Down below in this hole
The veil of death is everywhere
Infinite and profane thrones
Abysmal sights of the damned
Cleansing chaos steals the light
Majestic darkness feeds the bitter frost and howling winds
Shall scream
Abhorence deeds
Eternal bliss
Demons born seed of hate spill forth
Stroke the flames
Inhale the burning death
Deathcult supremacy
This is the dark age
Neverending horror
This moment of glorious defeat
Is an eternal memory maximum evil power
Mourning sorrow perpetual pain
Seed of hate spill forth
Stroke the flames
Inhale the burning death
