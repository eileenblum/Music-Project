Legions arise from the graves
Retribution n the lambs of god
The cold winds of darkness blow strongly a shadow of infernal might
Unleash the black winds of hate
The fear from the heart of hell unveil the source of hellish creation
Your god is dead
The torture
The pain
Decadence
Die nazarene
Pure blackness
Pure grimness
Hail greatness
Evil is the key
Perdition and bloodshed
Sathanas glows in the dark
The splendour of hate
The beauty of the devil's mark
Into the realm where nothing dies
We'll rise again
We are the first in the face of god
We are the incubus breed
Pure hellish blasphemy
Against lambs of god
