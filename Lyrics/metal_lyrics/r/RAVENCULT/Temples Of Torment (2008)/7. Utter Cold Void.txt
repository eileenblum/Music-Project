No presence of mortals in silent fields of gray
No movement, no lifeline in utter cold void
The path I chose to wander lies north
Where rust is priceless and ice covers the earth
Winter's mist is near
Where gleaming shadows crawl
And I could only substitute joy with strict logic
And I could only substitute life with imminent death
Return to nihil law since motion is futile
I sink in cold void, adjust in the higher scorn
Here man resembles gods and gods resemble man
We suffocate in mortal shell
We need no blood but frost
Frost!
