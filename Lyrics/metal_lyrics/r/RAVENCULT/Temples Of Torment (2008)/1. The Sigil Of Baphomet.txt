An age of plagues, an age of chaos has come
No fields for kings , no fields for thorncrowned ones
Knowledge bestowed in ancient cult , the horned one more than a figure in black
No redeemer liveth, liberation we seek
The earthy coil drenched in sulphur, the burden of matter
Repentance for sin
Nearly heathen
Repentance for sin
Like seven stars that drowned the sun and the moon
One step further to witness writings of doom
To be neither enslaved, servant or fool
A cryptic note unveiled for eyes to see
An age of plague ascends
No fields for kings
The earthly coil in sulphur
Liberation!
The horned one
A cryptic note unveiled
Knowledge bestowed in ancient cult
The sigil of Baphomet
