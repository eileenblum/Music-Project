Hoarfrost addiction, injections of cold
Divided we breathe in heretic ways
Careful what you wish for, blessed parasite
Tolerance withered constantly unknown
Where irresolution equals discipline
An empty stare and puppets string
Hearts that sound like ghastly necrotunes
Three nails could be enough
Creating your own doom
Salvation is at hand
Pilgrim, humanoid
Three nails are not enough
