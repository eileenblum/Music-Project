Spawned from the filthiest cunt
The son of God, the nebular whore
Emerging from darkseas
Like cosmic rays erase the fog
And glorify the winterstorm
Funeral dreams of angels forlorn become unknown
Now cursed by the moon, I sacrifice the virginborn
Spawned from a dying womb
The son of God, the nebular whore
Emerging from darkseas
Like cosmic rays erase the fog
And glorify the winterstorm
Ages before the birth of time and space
Where no sun's rising on earth's face
The bitter frost will turn all life to dust
Sceptres down, inhale some glorious death
Spawned from a dying womb
The son of God, the nebular whore
Emerging from darkseas
Like cosmic rays erase the fog
And glorify the winterstorm
