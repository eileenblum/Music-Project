Goatshaped masks, hamstringing lash
Noisome divine serfdom
Vehemence with no submission
Moribund world
Cancerous growth, no anaesthesia
Nonentity, hate and conversion
Hail woe!
All holiness now scuttle, impurity
Cloven hoofs in sacred ground
Genuine inner pain, immortality
Through the abysmal fog, Infernal Majesty!
Face the soil, who twists the knife?
Cloven hoofs, goatshaphed masks
A curse that sounds so merciless
Drape yourself in status torment
Genuine fear, horncrowned rats
Destruction!
The final command
