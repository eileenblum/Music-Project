They break contracts
Just as they like it
They murder until
Everybody is pole by fright
And they talk about peaceful victories
They explote you
And lie to the world
They spread violence
Blood and tears
But you still trust them
And give them money
But you don't dare
To fight the danger
Fright or stupidity
Makes you follow them
You're guilty as well as
The other, wan't you finally
wake up
You feel safe
When you hear
The sound of sirens
The blame sticks on you
Like poison stand up
But who's aware of this
And conceals it to nation
wake up
And only wants to enjoy the present
This person is a scamp
stand up
Especially when he chooses freedom
wake up
And then doesn't give
A fuck about it stand up
