Finally the time has come
The hunting season just can begin
In the name of the nation the search
For you, you're wanted
Bang 'til death
Every day your existence is impressed
To be a public enemy
They plan hard labour in concentration camps
Laws will be changed they learned of the past
Kids understand we must stick together
Unity is what we need
Bang 'til death
Today they call it democracy
The brown plague of the past days
They talk to you everyday
Today there're uniformed in suits and ties
Tear off their masks and send them to hell
Bang 'til death!
Kids understand we most stick together
Unity is what we need!
We piss on your discipline
And hate your fucking order!
