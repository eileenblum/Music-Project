You walk down the streets
And you make trouble
When you beat them up
You have tons of fun

You're proud to be different
And you don't need adaption -
You resist with all your strench

The one day you will have power
When you beat them up

You have tons of fun

Dead end kids you're a boozer
Dead end kids you fight for your right
Dead end kids you're really O.K.!
