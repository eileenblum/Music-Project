I know myself hanging there
For nice icy nights
Facing the endless darkness around me

Wounded by my own spear
On the wind cold tree
I am Odin - Hallowed by my own rite

A tree unknown the roots be sprouts
Lets my life slowly fade
From a bough of Yggdrasil I hung
Committed to my fate

Delivered to the fright
Of endless ice and night
I had to gaze into the misty world
Of Niflheim - the dire northern frost empire
In my self chosen solitude

Runes you will reveal
In the dust of ancient times
Remember my sacrifice
When I hung for these nine nights

Runes they were concealed
In the dust of ancient times
I died to be reborn
When I suffered these nine nights

When I begun to grow
Evanescent by pain
I sunk from the tree with a sigh

The knowledge of the dead I learnt
Cause only cruelty can forge
And then word just followed word
