When Skoll and Hati are on their prowl
To devour the sun and the moon
When all the stars will fall from the sky
To let the earth shake in its doom

Judgement day has come
For all the life that walks the sun

When Fenris is breaking
Away from his chains
Spitting his fire upon the ground
The Midgard snake ashore
Is flooding the earth
With poison emblazing
Sea and clime

Made from the nails of finger and toe
Of the dead, Naglfar sets afloat
Summoned by the turmoil and riot around
The sons of Muspell come crossing now
