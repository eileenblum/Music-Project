Peace descending slowly
On the fields of blood
Eyes staring empty
Life runs in the mud
Skogul clad in mist
To choose amidst the gore
Those fallen heroes
Whom Hel shall have nevermore

To drink forever
Valkyries serving Heidrun's mead
To feast on Saehmnir's meat
Daily risen from the dead

To live a warrior's life
Reckless and hard
To walk, to live, to breathe, to die
The honour of Asgard

Come all you heroes
The slain of battlefields
Einherjars warriors
Your fate long revealed

Come sons of Odin
Welcome in Valhall
Einherjars heroes
On Wigrid thou shalt fall

To sit with Odin
His guest and adopted son
To live in Valhall
Until RagnarÃ¶k may come

To fight aside the Gods
On Wigrid's fields of blood
To die a second time
Within the final flood

On Wigrid thou shalt fall
