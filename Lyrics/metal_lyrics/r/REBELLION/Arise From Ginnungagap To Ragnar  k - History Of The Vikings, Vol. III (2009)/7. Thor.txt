The son of Odin the Godfather
And Jord the Earthmother
Was an unruly child
Furious and wild
Too strong to be tamed
And yet too young to be sane

Oh my son spoke Odin until you grow of age
To control your temper and your rage
You must live with the keepers of the lightning
Who are used to power so frightening

Oh father look at me what I've become
My feet are lightning I am your son
My voice thunder under brooding skies
My hammer cracks skulls as giants die

Oh Odin it's been long but I've come home
My feet never touch Bifrost for I tread too strong
I've come to claim my seat now in Gladsheim
Bilskirnir shall be my palace the home of mine

MjÃ¶lnir my hammer I hold it strong
Defender of Asgard where I belong
On my chariot the wildest storms I'll ride
As thunder speaks and lightning strikes and
MjÃ¶lnir hits I'll rule the night

Thor - Giants hide the fear
When they feel thy hammer near
Falling from the sky
Skulls cracked die

Thor - Keep chaos hard at bay
As with broken skulls they lay
Their life at your feet
Death doth greet

Father I'm not afraid to meet my fate
On RagnarÃ¶k the final stand dues to be paid
Father by your side I'll proudly die
On RagnarÃ¶k chaos prevails gods shall die

Father Magni and Modi shall overlive
My pride my sons live to give
After death father there's life to come
For in our sons father we will live on
