Odin I am the son of Bor
The Norns sung my fare
Ravens beside me evermore
In a world to be made

But you who are you
The Giants of Ice
Ymir you think you rule
Ten thousands won't suffice

It's a war of thousand years
Between courage and your fears
It's a war an endless fight
Between darkness and light

It's a war of thousand years
There is life and endless tears
It's war where giants fall
Gods shall stand tall

Odin I am standing strong
Amidst bloodshed's agony
Vili and Ve hold our long
Oh my brothers next to me

Where is Ymir he must die
Then his breed will be gone
Fall upon him hear his cry
This battle is won
