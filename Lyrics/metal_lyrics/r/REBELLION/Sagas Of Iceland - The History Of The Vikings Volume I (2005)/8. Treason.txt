Our lives have turned sad
The harvest again was bad
And it's growing worse
hungry children cry

They pray to a new god
while their people die
But fortune does not grow from a lie

What is our hope when kings betray
Sigurd was too strong but in ambush they lay
His brother helped and he was paid in gold
Now Sigurd lies dead bloodless and cold

Treason dwells in our king
He lies betrays and kills at night
What fortune can it bring?
Treason walks in this land
The Grayskin murders
smile on his face
But blood is on his hands

King Tryggve was strong
And Erik's sons feared him well
So in the dark of the night
He was stabbed and fell
And Sigurd's son they tried to buy
But he remembered his father
and saw the lie

Treason dwells in our king
He lies betrays and kills at night
What fortune can it bring?
Treason walks in this land
The Grayskin murders
smile on his face
But blood is on his hands
