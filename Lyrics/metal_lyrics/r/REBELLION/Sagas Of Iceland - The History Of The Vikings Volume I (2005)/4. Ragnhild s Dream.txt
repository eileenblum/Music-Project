Ragnhild the daughter of Sigurd Hjort
Her father murdered and she was taken
Far away across the fjord,
a slave to be her fate forsaken

Halfdan the black the king of Agder
He heard about her beauty and her sadness in life
Rescue the lady make her a queen,
set free a slave, gain a wife

There's greatness and grace for the northern race
A strong hand to come,
a king for the throne
He shall lead Norway on

Ragnhild's dream.
A thorn in her hand
grows a tree so high
Ragnhild's dream.
Rooted in blood
but the branches reach for the sky

A strong han to come,
reach for the sun in the sky

Their son is born a child of beauty
Crows a young man strong and fair
Harald Harfarger, Halfdan's son
Looking for dangers
few man dare

King Halfdan he died at the age of forty
Leaving his people to Odin he rode
Harald must rule the kingdom of Agder
Praying to Thor, fate will unfold

There's greatness and grace for the northern race
A strong hand to come,
a king for the throne
He shall lead Norway on

Ragnhild's dream.
A thorn in her hand
grows a tree so high
Ragnhild's dream.
Rooted in blood
but the branches reach for the sky
