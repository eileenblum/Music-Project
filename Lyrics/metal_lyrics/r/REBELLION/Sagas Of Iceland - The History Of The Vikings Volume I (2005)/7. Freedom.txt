(The Saga Of Gang Hrolf)

I fought like a free man
so I broke the law
The way of the vikings don't count
here no more
And strong is the arm of the tyrant that rules
The Jarls of the free
they were taken like fools

So friends come aboard
and away on the sea
The shores of France seem
a promise to me
Battles to be fought
their king he is weak
There's land to be taken
a fortune to seek

'Cause we'll stay free
A master of the waves a wolf of the sea
'Cause we'll stay free

Ho ho Gang Hrolf
Ho ho Gang Hrolf

Freedom is the goal
that you fight for in life
Let no tyrant take it away
Freedom is all that is left on my hands
And a wolf of the see I shall stay

The battles are won
and the simple asks for peace
Here I shall rule as the Duke of Normandy
They tell me kiss his feet
so I lift them to my face
I'll never bow my head
nor any of my race

Cause we'll stay free
A master of the waves a wolf of the sea
Cause we'll stay free

Ho ho Gang Hrolf
Ho ho Gang Hrolf

Freedom is the goal
that you fight for in life
Let no tyrant take it away
Freedom is all that is left on my hands
And a wolf of the see I shall stay
