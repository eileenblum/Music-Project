Regnat the Dragon Slayer, king of sea and land
When people spot your sail
they fear the sword that's in your hand
I was born your son
and with my brothers I sailed out
To feed the ravens, steal the gold
where battle rages loud

You had to go to England
with the few men you could gain
And outnumbered ten to one your heroes
they were slain
You searched for death in battle
but the falling light of day
Saw you as a prisoner in chains
they dragged you away

In a pit of snakes
By vermin's breath
Die you lost your life
No honour in such a death

The sons of the dragon slayer
All for one we stand
We'll cut the blood eagle
And your life shall soak the land
The sons of the dragon slayer
King Ella you'll repent
I'll cut the blood eagle
And your life shall soak your land

Ivar my brother king of London
let me know
He bribed the English nobles
so king Ella stands alone
Now's the time to gather men
to play the bloody game
Take their lives and spill their blood
to wash away the shame

Long boats touch the sand.
Northern warriors steel in hand
The enemy is weak,
no way to defend
Running through the lines,
falling on a fearing prey
Rognar's sons deal hard.
And in the end they win the day

In a lake of blood
King Ella's death
Die hard die slowly die
The blood eagle drinks your breath

The sons of the dragon slayer
All for one we stand
We'll cut the blood eagle
And your life shall soak the land
The sons of the dragon slayer
King Ella you'll repent
I'll cut the blood eagle
And your life shall soak your land

And the lonely one is strong

And we got our friends
to count on
Through the hard times and the rain
So we'll never play your rules
It is our life it is our game
