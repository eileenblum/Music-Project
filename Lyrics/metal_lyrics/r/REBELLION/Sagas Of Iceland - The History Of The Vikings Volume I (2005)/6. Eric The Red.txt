Away from Iceland's shores I must,
the king says I must go
Some neighbours asked a fight with me
and I laid their bodies low

Now my face is in the wind again
and friends are by my side
The green land we are looking for
and we trust in Odin's might

Come join me now I know the way,
(We'll be free!)
No king to rule us down
(Ride the sea!)
Man the boats and hoist the sails,
(All hands on deck!)
There's land to find I know,
(Don't look back!)

Through the wind and storm I'll carry on
To a new land where the sun will dawn
In the wind and storm I'll raise my head
Eric the Red

My son I see the fire in your eyes
as I felt when I was young
And I've listened to the Skalds and tales, you've gotta go as I have done

But it's your way Leif Eriksson,
the Red has come too old
The Vinland you will find I know,
Ride the wind be strong and bold

Come join me now I know the way,
(We'll be free!)
No king to rule us down
(Ride the sea!)
Man the boats and hoist the sails,
(All hands on deck!)
There's land to find I know,
(Don't look back!)

Through the wind and storm I'll carry on
To a new land where the sun will dawn
In the wind and storm I'll raise my head
Eric the Red
