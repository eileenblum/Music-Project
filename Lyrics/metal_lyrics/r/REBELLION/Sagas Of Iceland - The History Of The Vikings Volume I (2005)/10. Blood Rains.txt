(The Saga Of King Olaf Trygvason)

On the blackened eve of destruction
A king arises with the
promise of light
But the Jarls who held him high
Were soon to see that they followed a lie

Wise magicians and healing women
Put to the stake by royal hands
Baptized they would not be
And so in flames their life did end

Odin thy face
It fades in the blood
The heathen oaks burned
It's the end of a god

Blood rains from the sky
Love is just a Christian lullaby
I can't believe I'd rather die
Blood rains from the sky
Preaching love while tortured victims cry
I won't believe I'd rather die

Bondes who would not dip in the water
At the Althing he had put them dead
A royal smile a lie on the lips
Believe in Christ or drink burning lead

Raud a mighty Jarl on the isle
He was taken at night
and tried to a stake
His house on flames
Yet he would not fold his hands
Condemned to death
He had to swallow a snake

Odin thy face
It fades in the blood
The heathen oaks burned
It's the end of a god

Blood rains from the sky
Love is just a Christian lullaby
I can't believe I'd rather die
Blood rains from the sky
Preaching love while tortured victims cry
I won't believe I'd rather die
