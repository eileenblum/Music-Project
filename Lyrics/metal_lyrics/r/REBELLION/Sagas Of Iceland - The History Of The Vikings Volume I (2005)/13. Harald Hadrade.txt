Fifteen years, too young to die
The saint he fell within the last battlecry
But the time has come for you not yet
Escape from the battle of Stiklestad

Baptized by the sword and the shield
Destined to be kind
The last in line
Lead this epoch to an end
To be written in blood
Named Harald Hadrade

Out there in the world, afar from home
Explore all the east and grow up so strong
No riches, fights or prison walls
Will keep you away,
when your destiny calls
Baptized by the sword and the shield
Destined to be kind
The last in line
Lead this epoch to an end
To be written in blood
Named Harald Hadrade

See Norway lies bare down to your feet
King Magnus died, now your crown is complete
At England's shores you will just arrive
To fight your last battle
and pay with your life

Baptized by the sword and the shield
Destined to be kind
The last in line
Lead this epoch to an end
To be written in blood
Named Harald Hadrade
