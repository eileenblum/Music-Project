I have been on viking cruises,
taking what they wouldn't give
Sacrifice to Njord the master of the waves
on which I live

Now I found a king to follow,
now I serve the Forked Beard
Sven the son of Harald Bluetooth,
King of Denmark knows and feared

To England -- our dragons had to ride
To help the beaten Aethelred -- the
Picts we must fight

And many -- a hero died that day
I raged with bloodlust
and I cut their lives away

And so we beat them on a field
of gore and bone
But there is a price to pay,
the English should have known

Aethelred, oh Aethelred --
your kingdom now is gone
The king of Denmark takes your crows, oh you should have known

The northern sea he rules,
Denmark and England he unites
The norsemen rule the waves and king Sven holds all the might
The Forked Beard he rules
and like the devil we will fight
We rule the waves.
Fear the vikings pride

Hey, hey -- we are ruling the waves...

We burn the churches and the cross
The serpents of the crucified,
their lives are at a loss

Sven prays to Odin and to Thor
The power of the ancient gods
who dwelt here long before

And so we hunt those
who have burnt the oak trees down
The heathen roots run deep
the ancient gods are still around

Crucified, oh crucified,
you should have known
Your time has not yet come
and so we burn your houses down

The northern sea he rules,
Denmark and England he unites
The norsemen rule the waves
and king Sven holds all the might
The Forked Beard he rules
and like the devil we will fight
We rule the waves.
Fear the vikings pride

Hey, hey -- we are ruling the waves...
