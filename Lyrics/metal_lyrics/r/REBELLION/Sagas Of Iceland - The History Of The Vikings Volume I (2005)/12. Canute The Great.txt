(The King Of Danish Pride)

Now that I fight
With might and main
The Danish troops
I'll lead to fame

Now I survey the lands
Where I may stride
The English soil
I'm a King of Danish pride

You have plundered the whole Isle of Man
To become a greater king
And you murdered guiltless families
In the massacre of all Danish men
Aethelred. Oh Aethelred
It's my will to fight and see you dead
My troops are Viking warriors
And we sail the river Themse

Now that I fight
With might and main
The Danish troops
I'll lead to fame

Now I survey the lands
Where I may stride
The English soil
I'm a King of Danish pride

Forked Beard my father
I have sailed the way you led
To England on my Dragons
And I avenged all the dead
In Ashington, it was Ironside
I slayed his troops it served him right
Father, we took the lands
And we sailed the river Themse

Now that I rule
With might and main
The Danish kingdom
I lead to fame

Now that I own the lands
Where I may stride
The English soil
The King of Danish pride
