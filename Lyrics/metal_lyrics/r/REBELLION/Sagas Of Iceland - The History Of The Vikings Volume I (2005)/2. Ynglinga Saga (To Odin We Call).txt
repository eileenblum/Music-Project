He came from the land of Asaland
The ruler of Asgard
From the land of ice and snow

He conquered all of Saxland
And the giants of Jotunheim
The ravens fly where he'll go

A wise and travelled warrior,
a cunning enemy
Taking what we sacrifice
Across the rainbow bridge

Giving strength in battle, giving victory
Odin's chosen heroes
May cross the rainbow bridge

Hear the thunder
The sky is cracks
See the rainbow bridge
There's no turning back

Valkyrs riding a bloody trail
Heroes cross to Asgard, never fail

To Odin we call
-- in his name we will fight
Riding on dragons through the waves
And the gods on our side
To Odin we call --
in his name we will fight
Summon the valkyrs in the sky
On the wings of death we ride

The power of the Skalds
And the magic of the runes
He taught to us who sacrifice
By the cold light of the moon

The father of the Ynglinga
The house of our kings
The battle sound amuses him
And battle we shall bring

Mad as wild dogs
Strong as the bear
I bite my shield in anger
Life I never spare

A deadly blow, as cold as ice
The power of the berserk, take your life

To Odin we call
-- in his name we will fight
Riding on dragons through the waves
And the gods on our side
To Odin we call --
in his name we will fight
Summon the valkyrs in the sky
On the wings of death we ride

Hear the thunder
The sky is cracks
See the rainbow bridge
There's no turning back

Valkyrs riding a bloody trail
Heroes cross to Asgard, never fail

To Odin we call --
in his name we will fight
Riding on dragons through the waves
And the gods on our side
To Odin we call --
in his name we will fight
Summon the valkyrs in the sky
On the wings of death we ride

And the gods are on our side...
