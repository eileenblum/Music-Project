Shadows hide the battlefield as daylight fades away
The ghosts of fallen angels are picking up the prey
The spirit of the heroes that once fought for the light
Is crushed down on the blood soaked earth now where is all their pride

You - you are the last man standing tall
Fighting for the sacred grale but knowing you will fall
Now - that there is nowhere you can hide
Standing strong until the end your fate it will decide

Stand alone
You fight alone
You die alone
You will die

Rise
The power of evil
Power of evil
Ancient and old

Rise
The gods of destruction
Gods of all evil
Blood turns to stone

You're waiting on a barren hill to watch the enemy
Closing up upon the last man standing free
Armies of the darkness so numerous and cruel
You know your time is over and the devils take the rule

You - the anger rising in your mind
Agony's forgotten as you march against their lines
No - you will never bow your head
Sacrifice your life you know that eve will see you dead

[Narration:]
There was a mighty clash as his sword spoke in thunder
Dividing the waves of his enemies,
Their bodies falling in thousands from his strokes.
With every cut his anger grows as he stands on piles of the slain
Hell itself seems to rise spewing out countless creatures that seem to mock 
life itself so
But the last man is still standing strong on the edge time clad
In his in his fierce anger and the battle seems to rage on forevermore
