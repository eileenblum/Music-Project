I dwell up high
I send my armies off to die
I smile with glee
I hold the lead you won't be free

And as your children march to fight
To hail the glory of my name
They're taking lives they're spilling blood
This is the nature of my game

Kneel down and pray
For paradise
You will rise

My word is war
Writ' in blood to roam your mind forevermore
Word is war
My word is war

My word is war
Born in hell to seek you out to eat you raw
Word is war
My word is war
Word is war

Your skull white bone
They fill my hall and on my thorne
I sit I rule
All the warriors all the fools

I hear the voices from the grave
They sing the glory of my name
I bath in blood I drink your life
This is the nature of my game
