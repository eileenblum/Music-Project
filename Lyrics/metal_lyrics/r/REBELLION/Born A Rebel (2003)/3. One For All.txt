Built of metal
Of gleaming steel
Mighty and invincible
And fear I never feel

Screaming warcries
Like an iron bird of prey
Hungry for the power
Choosing our way

I was brought up by the wolves no way I'm turning back
There's a world against us ready for attack
I've been a fighter all my life no way I'm giving in
Call me a devil's child then I'll live in sin

And still we march and never fall
We're standing proud we're standing fall
We're holding on
One for all

And there are few I can recall
Who rise above the crowd so tall
We're holding on
One for all

Angry and wild
Hearts burning deep within
Never turn the back on you
You'll stab the knife right in

Raging through the town
Forever free
Born to be a rebel
Born to be your enemy

The harder that you come the harder I shall be
I'll never trust in you I am your enemy
There's no way to stop me I'm just like a stallion
This is what I live this is my own rebellion

And the world is never with us
So we must hold on alone
But heroes never falter
And the lonely one is strong

And we got our friends to count on
Through the hard times and the rain
So we'll never play your rules
It is our life it is our game
