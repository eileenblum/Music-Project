Are you looking for the ultimate kick
For the drug to gain some speed
Forget cocaine its Adrenaline
And heavy meral that's what you need

Burning like a fire like a demon in the night
Feeding on your energy you know we've got the right
Eating up the miles we're heading down the motorway
And we never stop you know it well we're here to stay

Got the power to take it to the top
Filled with energy never to drop
I am agression I run through the walls that you keep
Adrenalin the ultimate speed
Adrenalin

Playing hard and playing fast we never turn it down
Welcome to our metal blast we'll turn your worlds around
Raging through your hometown through the streets you know so well
Tonight we rule we'll take the streets we'll take you down to hell
