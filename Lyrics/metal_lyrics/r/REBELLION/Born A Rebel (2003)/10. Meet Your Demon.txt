Deep down in your mind where there's evil to find
I dwell in the shade of the sun
You know me I rise when the smiler have all gone

I rule all the pain and madness will rain
From dark clouds hiding the day
No way out there;s black in a world of decay

Meet your demon take a dip in the night
These doors are open there is evil in sight

Meet your demon take a sip of his breath
You look at your own face you look at your death

Come on meet your demon
Shake his hand say hi
Come on meet your demon
Be a nice boy don't say good bye

Meet your demon
Meet your demon

Depression it brings as I open my wings
A touch on the shores deep within
All is mine the fear and the deed and the sin

Just come with me take a look and you'll see
All the emptiness deep in your soul
Here I rule there's a universe you've never known

Meet your demon come on take your pill
You stare at the ceiling he will find you still

Meet your demon you can not run away
He's a faithful companion and he's here to stay
