Like ghosts arising
From my childhood memory
I see the horned one
Initiation just for me

I see them dancing
Around a fire black and lean
Remember jumping
Over the fire to get clean

More and more I feel the memories rise

Like the dusk awaiting dawn
I have been too long
Serving foreign masters fighting faw away from home
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
I feel the urge so strong
To stroll and rest under the tall trees of my home

Tall and mighty
The Seeress stood in front of me
She shook in blind trance
And her wild herbs set me free

I saw the leader
Descending from Walhalla's gate
Leading his people
Into a prosperous fate

More and more I feel the memories rise

Like the dusk awaiting dawn
I have been too long
Serving foreign masters fighting faw away from home
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
I feel the urge so strong
To stroll and rest under the tall trees of my home

[Solo]

Like the dusk awaiting dawn
I have been too long
Serving foreign masters fighting faw away from home
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
I feel the urge so strong
To stroll and rest under the tall trees of my home

Like the dusk awaiting dawn
I have been too long
Serving foreign masters fighting faw away from home
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
I feel the urge so strong
To stroll and rest under the tall trees of my home
