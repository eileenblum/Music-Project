Now what I do find
Is not what I had in mind
A prosperous fate I don't see
And that is angering me

My people live like a slave
My father careful not brave
To Rome taxes we pay
Starve in the winter we may

Veleda once she said
Just otherwise I do remember I see
To her I'll ride to the Bructeri
And the Seeress shall answer me

Explain my fate to me

High above the Seeress tower
Floating on the wings of a dream
Take my hand oh Veleda hold me
Nothing is as it seemed

A prosperous fate means not Rome
There is a deed to be done
There is a battle of fight
A people left to unite

I must choose where I stand
To whom I lend my hand
It seems like treason to me
But we need to be free

Explain my fate for me

High above the Seeress tower
Floating on the wings of a dream
Take my hand oh Veleda hold me
Nothing is as it seemed

Freyr rules in ecstasy
My fate now I clearly see
At the Allthing Veleda speak for me
Give to my people the faith to be free

[Solo]

High above the Seeress tower
Floating on the wings of a dream
Take my hand oh Veleda hold me
Nothing is as it seemed

High above the Seeress tower
Floating on the wings of a dream
Take my hand oh Veleda hold me
Nothing is as it seemed

High above the Seeress tower
