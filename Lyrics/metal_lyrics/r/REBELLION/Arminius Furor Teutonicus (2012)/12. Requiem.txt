As I sit here
I see thee as we were young
Like brothers, best friends
We'd see it through whatever come

Worn and tired I am
Feel the weight of all those years
The weight of years

Wish you could be with me now
Wish you could be with me now

But this is just a requiem
But this is just a requiem
But this is just a requiem
For the fallen
For the fallen
For the fallen
A requiem

[Solo]

Oh that battle
All the freedom, glory and gold
I never saw them
But you died young and I live old

Wouldn't you have liked to live
To see your children die in the wars to come
Would you not have liked to live
To see your sacrifice undone

But this is just a requiem
But this is just a requiem
But this is just a requiem
For the fallen
For the fallen
For the fallen

A requiem for the fallen
For the fallen
A requiem
For the fallen
