The time has come we will send
Your legions doomed to meet their end
There's no way out, nowhere to run
Our triumph blossoms in the sun
The ground turned red, by Roman blood
Your leaders died by their own sword
A warning for all time

Don't set your flag on our land, we'll never kneel
Defeated by barbarian tribes, how does it feel?
Your pried and joy lie shattered at our feet
At Teutoburg ground
Vae Victis
Where empires bleed

See me now, first of my tribe
As destiny is on my side
Fight for freedom, Cherusci rise
Gaze right into your enemies' eyes

We built a wall to hold them back
The Romans face our last attack
Here where it all shall end

Don't set your flag on our land, we'll never kneel
Defeated by barbarian tribes, how does it feel?
Your pried and joy lie shattered at our feet
At Teutoburg ground
Vae Victis
Where empires bleed

At Teutoburg grounds
Sacrificed in our holy groves
Our remains preserved in time

[Solo]

Don't set your flag on our land, we'll never kneel
Defeated by barbarian tribes, how does it feel?
Your pried and joy lie shattered at our feet
At Teutoburg ground
Vae Victis

Where your empire bleeds
At Teutoburg grounds
Augustus

Your pried and joy lie shattered at our feet
At Teutoburg ground
Vae Victis

VAE VICTIS
