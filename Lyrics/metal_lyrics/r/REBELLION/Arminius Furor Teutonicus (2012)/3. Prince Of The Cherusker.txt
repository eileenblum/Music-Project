Oh come dear Arminius eat with us, recline
There is turmoil in your homeland and your troubles
I'll make mine
Segemir, your father, struggles for the upper hand
But Segestes, your uncle, also tries to win the land

Augustus I am
Ruler of the world
Imperator
Ruler of the world

Prince of the Cherusker, Hero of Pannonia
Raised in Rome your people you rule
Prince of the Cherusker of Germania Magna
With my help and under my smile you rule

Pannonia's decided just a year to final peace
So take your Ala home from the army you're released
Germania Magna win for Rome and I will aid
Roman peace to help a prosperous fate

Augustus I am
Ruler of the world
Imperator
Ruler of the world

Prince of the Cherusker, Hero of Pannonia
Raised in Rome your people you rule
Prince of the Cherusker of Germania Magna
With my help and under my smile

Prince of the Cherusker, Hero of Pannonia
Raised in Rome your people you rule
Prince of the Cherusker of Germania Magna
With my help and under my smile you rule

[Solo]

Prince of the Cherusker, Hero of Pannonia
Raised in Rome your people you rule
Prince of the Cherusker of Germania Magna
With my help and under my smile

Prince of the Cherusker, Hero of Pannonia
Raised in Rome your people you rule
Prince of the Cherusker of Germania Magna
With my help and under my smile

Under my smile
Under my smile
Under my smile
Under my smile
You rule
