Through mud and through rain our legions drag on
They fall on us like demons, they hit and they run
Attack out of darkness, spreading death and despair
They cut through our rows, an ambush beware

Varus - look what you've done
No way to turn back now
no chance to head on

Trapped - in swamp and in rain
Like phantoms they rise
Leaving corpses and pain

Oh Varus see your forces are bleeding
No escape from the Teutonic wrath
Oh Varus see your pride was misleading
In the storm and the everlasting rain

Teutonic wrath

Leave the civilians from our baggage to their fate
Get out of this trap before it's too late
There is nowhere to run, we just can't make a stand
Our legion is butchered as it gets out of hand

Varus - look what you've done
No way to turn back now
no chance to head on

Trapped - in swamp and in rain
Like phantoms they rise
Leaving corpses and pain

Oh Varus see your forces are bleeding
No escape from the Teutonic wrath
Oh Varus see your pride was misleading
In the storm and the everlasting rain

[Solo]

Oh Varus see your forces are bleeding
No escape from the Teutonic wrath
Oh Varus see your pride was misleading
In the storm and the everlasting rain

Oh Varus see your forces are bleeding
No escape from the Teutonic Wrath
Oh Varus see your pride was misleading
In the storm and the rain

Everlasting rain
No escape from
Teutonic wrath
