Like all the years before
Roman legions cross our land
Like all the years before
They feed their soldiers off our hand

Varus Varus
New governor of Germania
Sworn to force Roman law
Upon a people free so far

Oh Varus, a friend of mine you are
Oh Varus, but this has gone too far
I will not see my people live as slaves
I will not
Oh Varus, you don't know who we are

Not in all those years before
Was the rule enforced with an iron fist
Never in those years before
Were we tread upon until the ground we kissed

Varus Varus
Bitter enemies you've made of friends
Sworn to a full revenge
For humiliation suffered by your hand

Oh Varus, a friend of mine you are
Oh Varus, but this has gone too far
I will not see my people live as slaves
I will not
Oh Varus, you don't know who we are

[Solo]

Oh Varus, a friend of mine you are
Oh Varus, but this has gone too far
I will not see my people live as slaves
I will not
Oh Varus, you don't know who we are

Oh Varus, a friend of mine you are

Oh Varus, but this has gone too far

Varus Varus
(I will not see my people live as slaves)
Varus Vaurs
(Oh Varus, you don't know who we are)
