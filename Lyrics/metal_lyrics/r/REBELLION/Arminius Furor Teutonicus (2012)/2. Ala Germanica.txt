The legions are marching
Pannonia burns
On the edge of the battle
We wait and I learn

The cruel art of warfare
To wait till it's right
To jump our horses
The battle to decide

500 Barbarians I rule

Ala Germanica
Into battle ride
For glory and for victory
Side by side
Ala Germanica
Arminius lead us on
Defeating Pannonia
In the name of Rome

ALA GERMANICA

The thick of the battle
Like the edge of a blade
Receive now my orders
I must no longer wait

We ride under screams
A maelstrom from hell
to kill where we hit
or to die where one fell

500 Barbarians I rule

Ala Germanica
Into battle ride
For glory and for victory
Side by side
Ala Germanica
Arminius lead us on
Defeating Pannonia
In the name of Rome

ALA GERMANICA

[Solo]

Ego Imperator Caesar Divi filius Augustus, te, Arminii, ductorem
popularium, pro meritis in bellum Pannonicum ingentissimis tuis ordinem
equestrem transduco.

Ala Germanica
Into battle ride
For glory and for victory
Side by side
Ala Germanica
Arminius lead us on
Defeating Pannonia
In the name of Rome

Ala Germanica
Into battle ride
For glory and for victory
Side by side
Ala Germanica
Arminius lead us on
Defeating Pannonia
In the name of Rome

ALA GERMANICA
