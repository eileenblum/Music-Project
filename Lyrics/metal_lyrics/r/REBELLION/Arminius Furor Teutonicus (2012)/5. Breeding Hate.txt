Roman Rules - Roman Lords
Roman taxes - Roman swords
Free Men - No more
Subdued - Roman Law

I see the cattle taken
With the winter at hand
Just to feed the soldiers
That rule the land
Forts standing strong
All the trees are gone
Heads bow to fate
And deep inside - I breed hate

Across Thenus up Lupia we rode
Full of joy to return home
I can't wait
Looking for a prosperous fate

I see warriors without pride
Women stealing out of sight
Blunt and rusty is the blade
Just numb eyes breeding hate
No more children on the street
Just a dog barks in retreat
I see not a prosperous fate
Just numb eyes breeding hate

Young men - Taken slaves
To serve - Roman grace
Women raped - As pleased
To serve - Soldier's need

I see Segestes smiling
As a friend of Rome
I see his riches growing
And his work well done
I am a Roman knight
Should be a friend of Rome
What I've seen of late
Deep inside - I breed hate

Across Thenus up Lupia we rode
Full of joy to return home
I can't wait
Looking for a prosperous fate

I see warriors without pride
Women stealing out of sight
Blunt and rusty is the blade
Just numb eyes breeding hate
No more children on the street
Just a dog barks in retreat
I see not a prosperous fate
Just numb eyes breeding hate

Breeding hate
Breeding hate
Breeding hate

[Solo]

I breed hate

I see warriors without pride
Women stealing out of sight
Blunt and rusty is the blade
Just numb eyes breeding hate
No more children on the street
Just a dog barks in retreat
I see not a prosperous fate
Just numb eyes breeding

I see warriors without pride
Women stealing out of sight
Blunt and rusty is the blade
Just numb eyes breeding hate
No more children on the street
Just a dog barks in retreat
I see not a prosperous fate
Just numb eyes breeding hate
