Hear the sizzling from a serpent's tongue
They won't believe you so in vain you come
To warn the Romans of an ambush you must
Too blind they are me Arminius they trust

Segestes
Don't you know there's a deed to be done?
Fate is sealed, we will fight, not run

Let's speak through javelins, spathas, and shields
Wait in the brushwood never to yield
We are sworn to make it an end

Oh Segestes
Don't you know there's a deed to be done?
Fate is sealed, we will fight, not run

Don't you see the warning
Written on the walls
Released, the ghost of freedom
Let repression take its toll
A voice that stirs within us
Never to be choked again
The ghost of freedom

We raid their towers on our lands at night
Retrieve the powers back on our side
You say we are lost, but I say let them come

Don't you know there's a deed to be done?
Fate is sealed, we will fight, not run
Let them come

Don't you see the warning
Written on the walls
Released, the ghost of freedom
Let repression take its toll
A voice that stirs within us
Never to be choked again
The ghost

Don't you see the warning
Written on the walls
Released, the ghost of freedom
Let repression take its toll
A voice that stirs within us
Never to be choked again
The ghost of freedom

Welcome to our forest
Our holy groves
It's time to show true colors
Feel the oaks reach for your soul
The breath of our Gods on the wind
The holy earth beneath your feet
The ghost of freedom

It's time to let all hell break loose
Time to die
Time to die
It's time to die

Don't you see the warning
Written on the walls
Released, the ghost of freedom
Let repression take its toll
A voice that stirs within us
Never to be choked again
The ghost

Don't you see the warning
Written on the walls
Released, the ghost of freedom
Let repression take its toll
A voice that stirs within us
Never to be choked again
The ghost of freedom
