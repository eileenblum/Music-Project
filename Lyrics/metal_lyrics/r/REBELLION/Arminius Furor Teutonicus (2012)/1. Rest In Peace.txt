Strong he was and great in fame
People came to hail his name
Once again they travel wide
To walk a last time by his side

Germania she still is free
She owes it to his victories
The Roman Varus he did beat
Germanicus he saw retreat

Gone he is gone
All that lives comes to end
So now just Rest in Peace
Gone he is gone
A poison you can't defend
So now just Rest in Peace
Rest in Peace

A people strong to rule their land
United under his own hand
But some are here who cry today
Bus lost belief along the way

Adgandaster the Chatti lord
He fed him poison 'cause he feared the sword
A deed by traitor done
Who lives on like a wayward son

Gone he is gone
All that lives comes to end
So now just Rest in Peace
Gone he is gone
A poison you can't defend
So now just Rest in Peace
Rest in Peace

[Solo]

Gone he is gone
All that lives comes to end
So now just Rest in Peace
Gone he is gone
A poison you can't defend
So now just Rest in Peace

Gone he is gone
All that lives comes to end
So now just Rest in Peace
Gone he is gone
A poison you can't defend
So now just Rest in Peace
Rest in Peace
