I've been drunken with horror death can't
frighten me
I 've long forgotten what the feeling of fear
might be
Life's but a shadow meaning nothing at all
But I feel alive again now that I stand with my
back against the wall

[Bridge:]
My back against the wall

[Ref.:]
Calling all to arms
There is no way to escape
Fate has turned to black
At least I'll die with harness on my back
[2]
All of my yesterdays have led me this way
Like a fool I believed what the tongues of evil did say
In my veins there is life again now that I must fall
This is my destiny here is my end with my
back against the wall
