[1]
The crown , my deeds Like a burden does it seem
I stand all alone In a dark and empty dream
[2]
Such is the bitter taste
Of the blarney outta hell
There was a life to waste
And the witches did it well
[3]
Here as I sit
On a cold and empty throne 
The thanes, most men 
All have fled I am alone
[4]
Such is the bitter taste 
Of my hopes about to fall 
There was a life to waste
I see demons rising tall

[Bridge:]
No use to run and hide
No use to run and hide

[Ref.:]
Now as my dreams lie there in pieces
Where is the glory after all
Now as I stand amidst the ruins
I see  demons rising tall
Demons rising tall
[5]
Still I am invincible
No fear in my heart there'll be
No man man of woman born
Shall have power over me
[6]
Yet there is a bitter taste
Of the madness that did fall.
I had a life to waste
I see demons rising tall

[Macbeth:] They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly, but bear-like I must fight the course. What's he that was not born of woman? Such a one am I to fear, or none.
[Young Siward:] What is thy name?
[Macbeth:] Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
[Young Siward:] No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell.
[Macbeth:] My name's Macbeth.
[Young Siward:] The devil himself could not pronounce a title more hateful to mine ear.
[Macbeth:] No, nor more fearful.
[Young Siward:] Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.

[They fight, and young Siward is slain]

[Macbeth:] Thou wast born of woman, but swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, brandished by man that's of a woman bom.
[Macbeth:] Why should 1 play the Roman fool, and die on mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes do better upon them.

[Enter Macduff]

[Macduff:] Turn, hell-hound, turn.
[Macbeth:] Macduff, of all men else I have avoided thee. But get thee back. My soul is too much charged with blood of thine already.
[Macduff:] I have no words; My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out.

[They fight]

[Macbeth:] Thou losest labour. As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air with thy keen sword impress as make me bleed. Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; I bear a charmed life, which must not yield to one of woman born.
[Macduff:] Despair thy charm, and let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripped.
[Macbeth:] Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, for it hath cowed my better part of man; and be these juggling fiends no more believed, that palter with us in a double sense, that keep the word of promise to our ear and break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
[Macduff:] Then yield thee, coward,
[Macbeth:] I will not yield to kiss the ground before your feet, and to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though thou opposed being of no woman born, yet I will try the last. Before my body I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff, and damned be him that first cries: "Hold, enough!" My fate may have turned to black but at least I 'II die with harness on my back.
