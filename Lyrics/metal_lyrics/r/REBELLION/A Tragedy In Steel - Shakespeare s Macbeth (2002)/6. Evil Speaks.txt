[1]
Darkness settles down
On your spirit bound
By the fears eroding your mind
As the dead arise
They fix your eyes
And your secrecies they find
[2]
You have got to know
You would sell your soul
Though evil tongues may beguile
To the sisters you run
They knew you would come
And they greet you with a luring smile
[3]
There is no need to ask
For they know their task
As they sing in a language of old
A black cat screams 
They weave your dreams 
An apparition does unfold
[4]
A bloody child
Clad in fires wild
Demons answer me
Beware of Macduff
Act bloody and rough
And an end to it there will be

[Ref.:]
Watch out, beware 
There are boundries you shouldn't dare
better beware my human friend 
where the evil lurks your life will end
[5]
They are touching your soul 
With their fingers so cold
Sanity's left behind 
More answers you need to find
[6]
Strange prophecies
Giving hope to thee
Promising life not death

Fear no one
For none of woman born
Shall ever harm Macbeth
