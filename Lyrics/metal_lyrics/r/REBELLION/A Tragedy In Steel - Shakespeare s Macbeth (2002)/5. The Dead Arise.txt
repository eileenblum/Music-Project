[1]
My fears in Banqou stick deep
Haunt my sleep
He knows the sisters' prophecy
His smiles I can read
[2]
For his breed I've sold my soul
A fruitless crown can it be all
Fate will have to bow her head
Banquo my friend soon you'll be dead
[3]
Muderers will do the crime 
I've paid them well to cut you fine
I'll never have to look at you 
Banquo my friend your life is through

[Bridge:]
I - I've walked deep in the blood
Return I can not
No I'll have to carry on
To be safe with what I've done

[Ref.:]
The Dead arise from their grave
To assail what we thought safe
The Dead arise outta hell
To the hero that fell
[4]
What is this I look upon
should be dead and gone
How can I believe my eyes
Is it a lie
[5]
Banquo how can it be you 
You lie in the blood that's what you do
I see mortal gashes on your head 
How can you smile you should be dead
[6]
What man dare I will dare 
A thousand warriors or the Russian bear
But pale cheeks of immortality 
How can I fight how can I fight against thee

[Bridge:]
Oh no - Let the earth hide you away
In hell you should stay
No don't you reach for my crown
I shall never take it down

[Narrator:]
Shaken by the ghastly apparition of the slain Banquo Macbeth fears even stronger
now for the security of what he has stolen by murder and treason and defends
by such means. Like a blind stalker in the night he is drawn back to the lair
wherein the witches dwell, hungry for confirming answers to the burning doubts in his soul.
