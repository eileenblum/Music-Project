[1]
We ride all alone from the battlefield
The rebels beaten they had to yield
Banquo and I we silently ride
Brothers in arms side by side
[2]
There s a fog which falls on the weary soul
It engulfs our souls as we head for home
The lands we pass we ve never seen
Clad in a twilight like a dream
[3]
Out of the shade three women rise
Appear in features that please the eye
How can such grace walk the earth
Can it be of human birth
[4]
Their eyes glowing with unearthly light 
Shining like diamonds in the falling night
They hail our names as we greet 
Their voices sound like music sweet

[Bridge:]
A Prophecy for great ambitions
A promise weaved in gold
Evil speaks a pleasant language
The Evil speak a pleasant language
A Prophecy is told

[Ref.:]
Hail Hail Hail Macbeth
Thane of Claims and Cawdor
and Master of death
All Hail Macbeth we greet thee with laughter 
Hail Macbeth thou shalt be king hereafter
[5]
We bid them stay as they did turn
More about our fate to learn 
Too sweet did their visions sound 
To ambitious men for glory bound
[6]
They turned to Banquo and hailed his name
Revealing to him the greatest fame
My brother listened pleased and well
To the promises they had to tell

[Ref.:]
Hail Banquo hail to thee
Lesser than Macbeth yet greater thou It be
Father of a line of kings to come
Hail to Banquo the chosen one
