Hail Hail Hail Macbeth

[Macbeth:]
Macdonwald I 'II take your head and hold it to the sky
[1]
Brothers look down in the valley
The traitors are strong their numbers are great
here we are we won't surrender
Fight for glory or meet our fate
[2]
Macbeth traitor know my name 
I will take your head in shame
I kill those who do betray 
Come now come and make my day

[Ref.:]
For my King and for Scotland into battle I ride
Disdaining Fortune 
Brothers march at my side
King Duncan you rule all hail to thy name 
Disdaining fortune
For Scotland's fame
[3]
Into battle anger in my brain
I fight like a madman insane
Like a lion feasting on the prey
I will just take your life away
[4]
I bathe in your reeking wounds 
I slay bloody life too soon 
I drink blood of enemies 
I kill in perfect harmony

[The Witches:]
The weird sisters hand in hand, 
Posters of the sea and land,
Thus do go about, about,
Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
And thrice again to make up nine.
Peace! The charm's wound up.
