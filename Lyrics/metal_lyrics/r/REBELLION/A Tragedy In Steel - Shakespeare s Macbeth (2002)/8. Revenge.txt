[1]
Macduff
Who are you
Once you were loyal
Once you were true

Run to England
To stand against me
I will burn your castle
I will slay, your family
[2]
How can I be loyal
To a murderer that stole the crown
How can I be loyal
To a tvrant 
That takes my country down

[Ref:]
We'll take revenge for all the lives you stole -
Macbeth 
The sins you did in the end you'll fall -
Macbeth 
We'll take revenge and put you down, in the
end we'll seize the crown
I'll take revenge for all the lives you stole -
Macbeth

[3]
Macduff 
Look and see
Here are the bloody corpses 
of your family
Burried dead
In a nameless grave
My lust for blood
Will make me safe
[4]
I've cried a thousand tears
In the shadows of the lonely night
As the tears run dry
You tyrant
I know that I must fight

[Gentlewoman:] Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise, and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her. Stand close.
[Doctor:] You see her eyes are open.
[Gentlewoman:] Ay, but their sense are shut.
[Doctor:] What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.
[Gentlewoman:] It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
[Lady Macbeth:] Yet here's a spot. Out, damned spot; out, I say. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? ... Macduff the Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. No more
[Doctor:] What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
[Gentlewoman:] I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
[Lady Macbeth:] Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried. He cannot come out on 's grave. To bed, to bed. There's a knocking at the gate. Come, give me your hand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
