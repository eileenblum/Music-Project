I have lived a warrior
I've earned my gold
To do the bloodwork of Rome
And to Sahsnot
I send my prayers
For I am a Saxon now
The warriors' tribe my home
Sahsnot

We descent from Alexander the Great
Landed on these shores and
Dirt and dust with gold we paid
We are warriors born to kill and to fight
Stand in our way
And you will die

Brothers of the sword
A Germanic Horde
Oh Sahsnotas Saxons we are

Warriors out to kill
Yes and kill we will
Oh Sahsnotas swordbrothers we are

I and all the warriors
Of the Reudignians
The Angles, Aviones
No more Nerthus
No priest to rule us
For we are Saxon now
And free to choose our own
Sahsnot
