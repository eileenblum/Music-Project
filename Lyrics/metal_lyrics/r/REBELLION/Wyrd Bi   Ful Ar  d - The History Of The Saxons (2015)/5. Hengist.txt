As I lay dying
I hold my sax in my hand
Not to pass without it
A warrior for Wodan must fend
Oh Wodan it won't be long

When I was young we came here
We took this land for our home
Hengist our hero and chieftain
Gone was the power of Rome
White horses float the sky

Hengist Hengist fly white horses
Win the power in all Angelland
Hengist Hengist Saxon forces
For you we all did stand

Vortigern he called us
As we slayed his enemy
We saw the land was fertile
And we took it as a legacy
White horses float the sky

Rowena the daughter of Hengist
Beautiful but treacherous
Vortigern he took her
Blinded by love and lecherous
O Wodan I won't be long

Rowena they are fools and they trust in us
You open the door and we'll use the Sax

Just kill them all stab them dead
Let this lonely hall become their deathbed

The night of the long knifes let them feel
We take all their land and we pay it in steel
