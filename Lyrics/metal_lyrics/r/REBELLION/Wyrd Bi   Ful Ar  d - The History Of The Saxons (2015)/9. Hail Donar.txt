To the Christian god alone we must pray
Execution if we fail to obey
New laws by the Frankish king to bind us
Free men we have been and we will stay thus

...or we will die
...or you will die

Hail Donar take revenge
The rivers run in red
Hail Donar we'll avenge
Defilation and the dead

Hail Donar scream with rage
As we bring the hammer down
The hammer rules where justice reigns
Where free men stand to take the pain
Hail Donar

Wittekind has called to all those who are true
To assemble at the grove of SÃ¼nte-Loh
Hold the Althing, sacrifice our Gods of old
Choose a warleader to follow as he told

And then the Franks attack...

Stand strong, hold your Sax tight
The boggy ground will break their line
Fall on them. Kill them
Make them bleed for all their crime

Victory, Victory, Victory Hail Donar
The Franks lie in their blood
