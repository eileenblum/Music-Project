A small band of warriors all clad for war
We water the boat and we pull on the oars
We cross to Britannia to find easy prey
Where Roman rule falls to a state of decay

The Saxons come
Fight, steal and run
Making Wodan smile
When we rape all the isle

Take to the sea to find fortune and plunder
Take to the sea, pull the oars hold on tight
Britannia she lies like a virgin so tempting
Take to the sea and we'll play her just right

Salt on our lips and wind in our hair
We are the Saxon, we conquer, we dare
Lites Saxonicum they call these shores
We steal all their gold take their women for whores
