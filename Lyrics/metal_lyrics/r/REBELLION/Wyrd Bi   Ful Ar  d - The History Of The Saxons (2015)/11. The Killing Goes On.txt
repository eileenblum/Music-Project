As free men under Wittekind
We storm the land
Rage against all Franks we find
Blood on their hand

Scara Franzisca Charle's elite
Run, escape to Paderborn
Their life is all that some could safe
Ragged and torn

On and on the killing goes
The Reaper feeds on souls
Warriors doomed to die
Sacrifice their lives

On and on the killing goes
I'm haunted by the souls
Those who once stood strong
The killing goes on

Fresh soldiers come to reinforce
The Frankish might
So by the Hase river see
Death or victory

Even our women fight along
Raging bare breasted and strong
For three days we kill and bleed
But in the end there is defeat
