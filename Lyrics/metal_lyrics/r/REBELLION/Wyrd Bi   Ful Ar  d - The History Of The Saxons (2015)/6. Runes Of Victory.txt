I carve a rune of victory in my Saxe's steel
The downfall of the Bructeri their fate now sealed
Suitbert the Christian fool we sent away in shame
The Siegesburg stands where he lived to prove our claim

No more rule of the crucified
No more Christian fool
And we all follow Hathagat
Let the heathen rule

Runes of victory
Encarved in thy steel
Blessed by Sahsnotas
We will never yield

Runes of Victory
No we will never kneel
Blessed by Sahsnotas
The power is for real

The Angrivari beaten and the Suerland in our hand
Thuringia it tastes the Sax and adds to our land
BÃ¼raburg, AmÃ¶neburg, the Franks hide behind walls
Afraid to meet the Sax in field afraid of their own fall
