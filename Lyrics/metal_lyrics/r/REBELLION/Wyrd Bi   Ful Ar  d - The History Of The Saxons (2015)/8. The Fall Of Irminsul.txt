Hundreds of years, skirmishes and war
Many Frankish kings have tried
To conquer us before
This time w were beaten
Their numbers were too large
The Eresburg has fallen
Towards Irminsul they march

Destruction, Violation, Genocide
Without a rule
Desecrate, annihilate
The fall of Irminsul
The knowledge of the ancient
Brought down by a greedy fool
Exterminate a people
The fall of Irminsul

Charles declared a total war
Extinction of a people no less he swore
Children, women, ancient
All are given to the sword
Murder, blood and slaughter
Just to please his Christian Lord

And she looked peaceful
As she stood so tall balancing
The world and the void
So peaceful
Every second she stood
Before she was destroyed

Shock, despair, anger
Scream for revenge
