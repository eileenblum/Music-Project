The sun it rises to a day filled with hope
For Charles offered to confer terms of peace
So to Verden our warriors came unarmed
Trusting his words so the killing may cease

In came the heroes of SÃ¼nthe-Lo
Only Wittekind was missing
He did not trust the promise of peace
Granted by a Frankish King

Betrayal
Betrayal

Unarmed they were butchered
While priests chant their tunes
The best of a people lie murdered and ruined
Such is the love of the priests and their lord
But history books will remember Blood Court

There lie the fallen for justice we cry
The priests say a prayer and shrug with a sigh
The king calls it justice, his word is the law
But it was just a slaughter for all that we saw

Wittekind, the only hope left for freedom
Wittekind, the last one to avenge the treason
All the power of the Saxons unite
Wittekind, you must fight
