Father: "Thank you wise woman, you herbs and potions have healed the boy"
Healer: It is nothing, thank Nerthus, just give the Goddess a small sacrifice
Priest: Vade retro Malefica. Seize her
Boy screams: "No, leave her!"
Father: "Hold it ... please, I beg you, she did no harm"
Priest: "She is in league with the devil, stand back and keep still or you will share her fate"

On the air I can smell the stench of evil
It is the devil's work you exercise
Vade retro evil demon
I can clearly see through your disguise

Heathen you shall burn
God's mercy you shall learn

The holy cross will purge your power
To the blessed water you must yield
Arrest her now, put her in irons
And in time the truth win be revealed

Heathen you shall burn
God's mercy you shall learn

He's a god full of mercy so your demon he'll defy
As the flames burn your flesh your soul to purify
So we sing all his glory while the witch burns at the stake
We rejoice in his mercy and a peaceful world we'll make

Look at her now bound to the pole
The most blasphemous sins she confessed
But god is great and his mercy endless
Her rotten soul in fire shall be blessed

See the flames reaching for the sky
God has mercy she is purified
A miracle, kneel and pray
God has mercy on those astray

Boy: "Father, why do the Franks hate us so much"
Father: "Because we are Saxons my son, be proud of what you are!"
Boy: "Then tell me our history father, so that I may know who I am."
