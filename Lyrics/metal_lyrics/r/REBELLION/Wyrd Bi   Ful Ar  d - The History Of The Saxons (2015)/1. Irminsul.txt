Where the eye of the hanging one sees far
And the wise in Irminsul observe the stars
Here the holy groves whisper Wodan's name
Here our ancient Gods reside in all their fame

Angria, Eastphalia, Albingia, Westphalia
The four Saxon regions united we are

The Thing gathers all so that wisdom may rule
Here at the feet of our tall Irminsul
So come all my people no fighting you fool
Under the peace of the tall Irminsul

Here we assemble to speak peace and to speak law
And to decide who shall lead us into war
All the people come from near and from far
There's no king here free men we are
