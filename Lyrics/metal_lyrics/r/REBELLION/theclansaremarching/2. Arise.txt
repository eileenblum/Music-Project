From Ymir's flesh the earth was made
And from his blood the seas
Crags from his bones, trees from his hair
His skull made the sky so free

From his eyebrows the blessed gods
Made Midgard for the sons of men
And from his brains
Storm-threatening clouds

Midgard arise
From the ashes of a thousand years of war
The spark of life
Touch the elm and the ash tree
Deep within their core

Mankind arise
Take possesion of the land, sea and shore
The Spark of Life
The spark of life darkness is no more

From Muspelsheim fire was taken
To shine over Midgard
Put in a chariot to be drawn
Across the sky

Sol the driver hunted day for day
By Skoll the wolf
So finally on RagnarÃ¶k
The sun will die
