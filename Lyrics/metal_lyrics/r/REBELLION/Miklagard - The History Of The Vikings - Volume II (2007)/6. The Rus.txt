From the lands of Sweden they came
862 was the year
Sailing under the flag
Of Rurik spreading fear

Novgorod was their stronghold called
The lands around they subdue
Blonde warriors cunning
Mighty and true

[Chorus:]
The rivers they rule
Warriors to the core
The Rus they are called
Standing proud and tall
Here their word is the law
The Rus they are called

Swjatoslav their present king
His names's like thunder on the plain
He conquered the bulgars
And chasars by sword and flame

[Chorus]

They rule the rivers to Miklagard
And to pass we must pay
A mighty kingdom
to last for many a day
