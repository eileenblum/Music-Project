I saw you in my fever dreams
Mighty walls of shining grace
From a different world it seems
A golden glimmer on my face

Across the lands, across the sea
I've traveled far I will succeed
And now I am passing through your gate
Within these walls there lies my fate

[Chorus:]
The golden roofs of Miklagard
I see you shining in the sun
My destiny lies within these walls
Oh Miklagard

Palaces of gold and stone
The riches of the world for trade
A harbour larger than the fjords at home
A city that the gods have made

From the lands of ice I came
To Miklagard for honour and fame
One of the emperor's guard to be
Varangian truth for all to see

[Chorus X3]
