The raging storms lead us north
Along the icy Neva's shores
Sailing ever north

A strange white light floats on the clouds
The silence screams at us so loud
Faces in the clouds

[Chorus:]
Through this world of ice and snow
In the dawn strange creatures glow
Frozen giants passing by
Standing on the edge of the life
Sailing on and never stop
Hold the sails don't let them drop
Here the stranded have to die
Sailing on the edge of life

An icy lake before us lies
Frozen smiles in weary eyes
Cold and empty eyes

Following the northern star
As we head for Ladoga
The northern star

[Chorus]

The land where ancient giants dwell
What is real who can tell
Eager eyes they seem to stare
Ghastly sigths in the air

Who claims my soul who knows the deal
Claws of ice I can feel
Stone cold fingers touch my heart
Hold it tight tear it apart

[Chorus]
