Skeletal hand of a desperate man
Lays a bludgeon upside your head
He wants your flesh and he wants it fresh
That's why he will wait you till you're dead
He wants your essence, it gives him presence
Puts meat on his bones
No more languishing, forever in anguish
Frank is coming come

Hellraiser
Hellraiser

In search of the threshold of pleasure
Obtained by sadistic measure
Lament configuration
Bliss through disfiguration
Malevolent priests inflicting agony
Ecstasy through misery

Mauled, ripped and torn
Pleasure and pain come as one
Mauled, ripped and torn
Pleasure and pain come as one

Severe mutilation brings joy
Using bleeding torturous toys
First they will desect you
Innocent blood then resurrect you
Vicious circle never end
Finding pleasure though pain again, again
