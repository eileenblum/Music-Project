Here to tell you a twisted story
Like back when comics were gross and gory
Before Dr. Werthan, that righteous slime
Claimed horror and gore led kids to crime

Acid in the face, needle in the eye
Decapitation, dismemberment, even sicker ways to die

And so the story goes
A creep commits a crime
Sanguinary, atrocity
A body dissected while alive
The vital parts then sold
Still living flesh, not cold
To make a tasty sausage
Making cannibals of untold
Now there is a widow with a malignant plan
Revenge for her own man
She sliced and diced

Revenge for sixty cents a pound

Seduce the innocent
Seduce the innocent
Seduce the innocent
Seduce the innocent
