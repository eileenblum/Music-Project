Deeper, deeper in the woods they're found
Chanting, chanting Cthulu cometh now
Sacrifice, sacrifice, give it flesh they sing
Calling, calling the lord blasphemy

The old one, great old one
It is nightmare itself
Waiting in slumber
Deep in the earth it dwells
Steaming, oozing stench of one thousand graves
Sleeping, dreaming in the corpse city of Ry'leh

Cthulu, dread Cthulu
It darkens the sun
The ancient, the anti god
Lord of the unholy ones

Howling, baying like animals in heat
Living dying by the master's decree
Teaching it's vulgarities even as they sleep
Awaiting the chaos when the master leaves the deep

[Lead: Shaune]

Deeper, deeper in the woods they're found
Chanting, chanting Cthulu cometh now
Sacrifice, sacrifice, give it flesh they sing
Calling, calling the lordly blasphemy
Hear them calling blasphemy
