It's a sickness of will, get a life
Conformity instills, get a life
Plastic personality, get a life
Void of originality, get a life
Such a waste of human flesh, get a life
Aspiring to less, get a life
Call and you just follow, get a life
It's sickening and hollow, get a life

This is the land of the free, where's your individuality?
Why aren't you striving to be all that you can be?
Take a chance, thrash a trend
Take a chance, it's not a law you can bend

Get off your complacent butt
Snap out of your spineless rut
You can gain a little dignity
Learn the meaning of integrity

It's a sickness of will, get a life
Conformity instills, get a life
Call and you just follow, get a life
It's sickening and hollow, get a life
