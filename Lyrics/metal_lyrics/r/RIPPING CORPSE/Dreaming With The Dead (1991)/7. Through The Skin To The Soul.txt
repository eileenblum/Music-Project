I spoke the words that let them in
Chanted in tongues, indulged in sin

[Lead: Shaune / Erik]

I've embraced a darker way
Will a new life begin
Conspiracy with demons
Hidden deep within my skin

They taint my soul now
Insidious brethren
Whispering their hatred
Of the purity of heaven
Through the skin to the soul
Conspirator unforgiven

Their elegance disarmed me
So subtle, yet obscene
Their gilded lied designated to drive me
To hideous extremes
They've taken all my faith now
Only fear and pain remain
I'm a mortal door, I'll cry no more
I'll never be redeemed

In my sleep they afflict me
With sordid blackened dreams
They fill my mind with hellish crimes
In loathing I am clean
My anger can expell them
Riding on my screams
Fits of anger unlock the cage
Consequences to be seen
