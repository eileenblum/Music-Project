Pulled kicking, fighting into an abyss
Your ignorance and hatred have opened wide a rift
Stupidity, arrogance stoke the fire well
Not looking for violence but who could ever tell

You've opened wide a rift of hate
Shall we back down or shall we reciprocate?

Adrenalin flowing, fists and elbows pumping hard
Putting up a wall so you can't become a part
Long hair, short hair, schisms in the brain
It's senseless and brutal and there's nothing there to gain

[Lead: Shaune]

You've opened wide a rift of hate
Shall we back down or shall we reciprocate?
