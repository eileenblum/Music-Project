Lance the boil, drain the pus
Cleanse the sores they leave on us
Righteous and false they are a plague
The antibiotic for them is rage

Immoral majority, corrupted hierarchy
Wolves in sheep's clothing, condemn them with loathing

Bastions of hypocrisy
They sully the image of decency
Espousing lies, preaching insanities
Conscience of no remorse
There's a deceitful selfish course
Abased in infamy, weeping for sympathy
Expose the contradictions, stifle the contagion
Degraded, stigmatized, naked without their lies

Local pastor can't control his lust
Holy man fallen â Chugging pus
Distinguished senator drank too much
Death by auto â Chugging pus
The honorable mayor is now a bust
For smoking crack â Chugging pus

Local pastor can't control his lust
Holy man fallen â Chugging pus
Distinguished senator drank too much
Death by auto â Chugging pus

Pick the scab, peel the crust
Reveal the infection we mistrust
Propriety is just a husk
Shock on your lies
Chugging pus

You're despised because you point your finger
While the stench of your lies forever linger
Like the encrusted cunt of an abscessed whore
You infect, you bring us your gorge
Your pathetic, societies festered affliction
Your bacteria, you deserve that distinction
