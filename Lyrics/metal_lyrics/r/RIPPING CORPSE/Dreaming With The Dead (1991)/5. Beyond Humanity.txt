Are you sane Crawford Tillingast?
Bow you've seen it, how long can your sanity last?
Don't go back in the house on Benevolent Street
Defy the urge no mater how it entreats
Deny the lust and greed to see
It's usurping your will and humanity
The pineal is no means to sanctity
Just a catalyst for the corrupting entity

Omnivorous, it feeds on minds deceased
Great knowledge, yet such perversity
The evil that lurks in all men's minds
You must defy it, strike it blind

Uncovering latent vision
Pretorious sounght to find nirvana
Absorbed in gratification, climaxed in decapitation
Festering withing the maw, digested by the hungry obscenity
United and debased with the voracious mutated amalgamation

Awash in a sick sensation, ravaged, debauched, not emancipated
Sapient abomination, sucking in the covetous myrmidon
Swollen, satiated, glutted from metempsychosis
Devouring without prejudice, engulfing, consuming, incorporating
Because humans are such easy prey

Defy it, save yourself
Survive
Defy it, save yourself
Survive

Beyond humanity
