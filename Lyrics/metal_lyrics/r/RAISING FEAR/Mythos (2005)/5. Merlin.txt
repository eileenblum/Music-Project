In the land of king Arthur
Somewhere back in old history
A bard, a prophet, a wizard, there lived
demonâs kin, most famous of men

He moved the stones
From Ireland to England
The temple of heavens to build
The holy sword he
Preserved till the time
When Arthur could claim the throne

He thaught Arthur all the secrets
To became a great king
Magic, knowledge, wisdom, enchants
To rule over Camelot, noble and just

He fell in love
With Vivien of the lake
The Lady who learnt all his art
When he was weak
Enamoured of her charm
She entrapped him in Breceliande
Merlin â Seer, enchanter
Merlin â Master of Magic
Merlin â Master of Illusions
Merlin â Master of magic
