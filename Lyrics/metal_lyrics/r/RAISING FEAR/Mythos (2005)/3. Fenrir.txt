Darkness falls as the prophecy said
âThe time of the doom will arriveâ
The wolf ate the sun, the giant the moon
None of the stars has remained

Out of the chasms
The children of evil...
Itâs Ragnarok
The serpent â the Wolf
All of the giants
The end of the world!

And when the wolf comes
One voice breaks the night
Asgardh unite! â Asgardh unite!
All of the godsâre coming
Heading the call
Asgardh unite! â Asgardh unite!

The call of the horn resounds in the air
The warning for the ending of all
Odhinn and Thorr and Tur join the battle
The clash of the monsters and gods

Out of the chasms
The children od evil...
Itâs Ragnarok
The serpent â The Wolf
All of the giants
The end of the world!

[Chorus]

The prophecy was clear
The end of the gods had to come
The doom of the powers
Yet... The gods will still face their destiny!

Out of the chasms
The children of evil...
Itâs Ragnarok
The Serpent â The Wolf
And all of the giants
The end of the world!

[Chorus]
