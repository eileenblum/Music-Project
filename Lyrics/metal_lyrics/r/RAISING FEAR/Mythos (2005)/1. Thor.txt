Wielder of the hammer
Mjollnir powerful
God of fire and lightning
Red â bearded Aesir

Defender from giant foes
The only one at Ragnarok

The first born of Mother Earth
(Thor Almighty)
The defender of his race
(God of thunder â Thor)
The first born of Mother Earth
(Thor Almighty)
The defender of his race
(God of Thunder â Thor)

When he rides the chariot
Drawn by massy goats
Heavens all resound of
Its rolling wheels

Avenger, brave warrior
Odhinnâs champion son

[Chorus]

The end was so close,
When he faced the giant foe
It came to Valhalla
And challenged the Gods
Hrungnir was its name and he had a heart of stone
He came with its giant mate Mekkur Kalvi of clay

Yet the hero of Asgardh with fearless wrath
With the Hammer in hand ready to strike
Tore them apiece with a mighty blow
Still heavens rejoice of his victory

[Chorus]
