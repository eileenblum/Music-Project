Couldnât decide
Always living on the edge
Creatorâs helper?
Spent all his life
Ravaging all of the villages

Stonecoat, helped the maker one day
Stonecoat, caused destruction on Earth

Good or evil, never chosen the way, Ocasta
Good and evil, chaos bringing turmoils, Ocasta

One day he was captured
Tricked, entrapped, and burned alive
As death loomed
He blessed his captors
Giver of knowledge, wisdom and power

Stonecoat, helped the maker one day
Stonecoat, caused destruction on Earth

[Chorus]
