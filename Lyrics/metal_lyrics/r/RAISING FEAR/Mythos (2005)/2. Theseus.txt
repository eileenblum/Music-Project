...Bloodthirsty creature
Ritual carnage
Half beast half man...

The cruel king
Of the court of ancient Crete,
King Minos
Had Dedalus build a maze
He locked the beast
And set the high price for defeat
Young boys
Seven, to feed its rage

Into the maze
The chosen ones would die
Terror awaiting
The Minotaurâs curse

âIâll stand for you
Oh father beloved Lord
Kill the bull
With my sword
I am Theseus
I wonât let all my people die!â

Shed tears
Of the beaten Greek king
Aegeus
Wouldnât let him go at all
Love tears
Arianneâs, Minosâs kin
Magic twine
Led him back out of the maze

Into the maze
The chosen ones would die
Terror awaiting
The Minotaurâs curse

[Chorus]
