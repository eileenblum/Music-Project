Back in 1486
A great and grim king was at the lead
The last reign was to be
Of the glorious Aztec Empire

Montezuma was his name
Lord of Mexico

Gold, precious stones
Magnificent silver work
Feathers green adorned his figure
Almost like a God...

Mighty and majestic
Feared by everyone

When one day the god â like men
Came to conquer all his lands through fire and tears
Hostage he was held for fear
He could lead a raging revolt

Montezuma was his name
Lord of Mexico

Gold, precious stones
Magnificent silver work
Feathers green adorned his figure

He believed them gods
Mercyless rude warriors coming from far shores
He believed them friends
They would bring destruction, death,
And the end of all

He believed them gods
Mercyless rude warriors coming from far shores
He believed them friends
They would bring destruction, death
And the end of all

The curse of the king
And all his people
The deceived ones
Cursed their deceivers
Escape for no one
