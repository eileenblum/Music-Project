Once the oppressor
Of Uruk harsh king
Then strongest man that ever was
Friends to Enkidu, the savage wise man
They stood together
Perform many deeds

The Demon, they killed
The bull sent by Ishtarâs wrath

He saw the great Mystery
He knew the Hidden
He recovered the knowledge of all times
Before the Hood

He met Utnapishtim
The Living One
Fried to uncover the secret of life
Yet at once
He found Himself
Old and weak
Mortal man

Gained nothing, but pain
He knees and weeps

He saw the great Mystery
He knew the Hidden
He recovered the knowledge of all times
Before the Hood

He journeyed beyond the distant
Journeyed beyond exhaustion
Gilgamesh, half human half God
Carved his story on stone

Woe to me! What can I do now?
Death is all around me
Death has devoured my body my flesh
I lost my immortality
O Goddess! My Mother!
Outstretch your hand!
Save me from these pains!
We to me! What can I do now?
Wherever I look there stands death

Gilgamesh! â Heâs the one
Heâs the one who saw things secret
Gilgamesh! â Heâs the one
Heâs the one who heard The Story
Lord of wisdom, he saw the abyss
And brought back words of the Hood

[Chorus]
