We are looking for the kraken as we sail the sea 
Sailing the sea for what we believe 
I see a face, in the waterâ¦ in the water!!! 
The years have passed with no trace of the monster 
The crew keeps strong as the storm keeps stronger 
I see my face, in the waterâ¦ reflection of an old man face 

Deep in the darkâ¦ A red gaze menaces 
From the abyssâ¦ the end awaits for me 
From the abyssâ¦ raises the fear in me 
Darkness emergesâ¦ a tentacle stirs the ship 

I SEE the KRAKEN, I SEE the KRAKEN 
I SEE the KRAKEN, I SEE the KRAKEN 
I see the kraken but I'd have never believed 
The greatest beast is the fear within me 
While harvesting the hate in this quest 
The worst creature was growing in me, killing me 
It is killing me 

Please forgive me, I never realized what we were doing to ourselves, in this quest 
It is in a hidden corner of the mind 
So many years overcoming the waves 
The darker the storm the greater the beast become 
I see a face, in the waterâ¦ reflection of a nightmare 

Deep In the darkâ¦ A red gaze menaces 
From the abyssâ¦ the end awaits for me 
From the abyssâ¦ raises the fear in me 
Darkness emergesâ¦ a tentacle stirs the ship 

I SEE the KRAKEN, I SEE the KRAKEN 
I SEE the KRAKEN, I SEE the KRAKEN 
I see the kraken but I 'd have never believed 
The greatest beast is the fear within me 
While harvesting the hate in this quest 
The worst creature was growing in me, killing me 
It is killing me 

We are, everybody 
We are, in hell 
We are, everybody 
We are, in hell 

In hell we are, in our own hell 
Please forgive us 
Please forgive me, I never realized what we were doing to us, in this complex reality.. 
We are, in hell 

I SEE the KRAKEN, I SEE the KRAKEN 
I SEE the KRAKEN, I SEE the KRAKEN 
The greatest beast is the fear within me 
While harvesting the hate in this quest 
The worst creature was growing in me, killing me 
It is killing me
