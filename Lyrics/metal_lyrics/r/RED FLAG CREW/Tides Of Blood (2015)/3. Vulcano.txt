I am the king of the seven seas 
commander of turkish fleet 
I am Barbarossa 
I am the king of the seven seas 

I destroyed Lipari 
ensalaved their souls 
now all that I want 
is under my control 

I am Barbarossa 
a nightmare to the spanish empire 
Terrible chaos caused by my cannonade 
now I have my assets for slave trade 

Vulcano forge 
souls of the fleet 
melting iron from the battle heat 
forged with magma and heated blood 
screaming souls burried in the mud 

Now the fire has dissapeared 
the smoke on the horizon is clear 
only ruins and dust in here 
harvest will sprout from our tears 

Vulcano forge 
souls of the fleet 
melting iron from the battle heat 
forged with magma and heated blood 
screaming souls burried in the mud
