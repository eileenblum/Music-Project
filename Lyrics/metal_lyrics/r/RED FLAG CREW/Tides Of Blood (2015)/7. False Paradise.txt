What are my eyes showing me?
here I am confused on my knees
I can only see clear water and white sand
paradise

A girl is walking towards me
she is bringing some peace
she moves slowly with the waves
she is singing some celestial songs

Where's the blood,
the smoke and the rotting corpses?
Where's my ship,
those people that hate me?

Yo ho! what do I see?
Island Tortuga is paradise
Yo ho! I can't belive
this is really happening
this place is hot as hell
but my heart is cold as ice
Yo ho! true paradise
I feel... I feel free

Dolphins are all around
hot water is so calmed in this place
endless peace in here
but... but...

Where's the blood,
the smoke and the rotting corpses?
Where's my ship,
those people that hate me?

This is starting to bore me
I want fire in my eyes
FIRE!

Oh lord of the seven seas
please take me back
take me back to the true
evil true paradise

Oh lord of the seven seas
please take me back
take me back to the true
evil true paradise

Oh lord of the seven seas
please take me back
take me back to the true
evil true paradise
Oh lord of the seven seas
please take me back
take me back to the true
evil true paradise

Oh lord of the seven seas
please take me far
take me back to the true
evil true paradise
Oh lord of the seven seas
please take me away
take me away from this hell
emptiness false paradise
emptiness...
false paradise...
