Welcome on board lad
take your maities along with us
long travesy without what you need and what you deserve
all you dreamers of the sea never felt this freedom in your ship
night has become to long
too silent in the calm sea

this is our dance, waves must go higher
we stand and dance with mermaids in the fire
give me some rum and jump higher
this is the night of pleasure and desire

pirates are having fun
with dream girls in the island of death
this poisson is changing our minds
the freedom in our veins

the time is ours
I am the beast
I am out of fear

This is my last chance
to see pirates fighting the beasts
no fear within me
only time is my enemy
pulling us into the abyss, with a silent move, sand of time falls
every port we visit in our jouney is achance to feel our blood

this is our dance, waves must go higher
we stand and dance with mermaids in the fire
mermaids.... are feeding us
taking care of us, they are.... like dreams come true
they accomplish our desires
mermaids!! ... are inside my thoughts
....playing with my thoughts with my thoughts!!!
they cares about my desires
they accomplishes my desires,my desires

She is, the mother of mermaids
she is in front of me
she is big as oceans
sharp teeth and reptil eyes
she is calling me
take me with you
take me to the deep blue
I want to go further
beyond my frontiers
I will travel where no man has dared to go

I will travel where no man has dared to go
I will travel where no man has dared to go

this is our dance, waves must go higher
we stand and dance with mermaids in the fire
mermaids.... are feeding us
taking care of us, they are.... like dreams come true
they accomplish our desires
mermaids!! ... are inside my thoughts
....playing with my thoughts with my thoughts!!!
they cares about my desires
they accomplishes my desires,my desires
