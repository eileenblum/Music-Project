With all the army you put forth 
Defenders hold fast on San Luis fort 
Desire for victory 
The anxiety turns you mad 
Defiant Vernon triggers the attack 
After three days and nights of the fire 
The pride of admiral Vernon is clear 
The supposed "victory" disappears 

Blind in one eye commands the troops 
Blas de Lezo rules 
Single handled he rips souls 
Blas de Lezo rules 
âPatapaloâ makes us true 
Blas de Lezo rules 
A piece of himself 
In each battlefield 
Stay alive, face the 195, all you have to do is fight, stand the 195 
Stay alive, face the 195, all you have to do is fight, stand the 195 
Piraterror... piraterror... Piraterror... 

Lezo supplies the valor 
To defenders of the harbor 
Canons of Cartagena 
Opened fire on British 
Defensive fortifications prevailed 
Disease from God finish with death 
Now we can see the light we fight for 
The British retire for reinforce 

Blind in one eye command the troops 
Blas de Lezo rules 
Single handled he rips souls 
Blas de Lezo rules 
âPatapaloâ makes us true 
Blas de Lezo rules 
A piece of himself 
In each battlefield 
Stay alive, face the 195, all you have to do is fight, stand the 195 
Stay alive, face the 195, all you have to do is fight, stand the 195
