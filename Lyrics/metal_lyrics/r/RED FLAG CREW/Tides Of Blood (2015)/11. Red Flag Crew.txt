We are sailing the sea, 
we are fighting the wind, 
no one of us fears the rage of the waves, 
the salt burning our face, 
we are loosing control, 
no one is asking for mercy, 
fear is away from our hearts, victory already in our minds, 

Trembling under your feet, 
the ship is twisting in pain, 
as we are out of the course in the rain, 
captain stands on the deck, 
through the eye of the storm, 

taking the course of our freedom we fight for our souls in our unique ship, 
we will never betray our brothers of blood, we will kill, we will lie we will strangle for us, for our brothers in arms 
toguether! 
together we arrive, together we leave, 
together we stand, together we die 

PIRATES!!! OPEN FIRE , 
PIRATES!!! TAKING FIRE, 
PIRATES!!! AYE AYE CAPTAIN, 
PIRATES!!! WE ARE ALIVE, 

searching for Spanish gold, 
we will kill 
we will die 
we will strangle 

we will take their lives, 
we will kill 
we will die 
we will struggle 

Of all the deaths you caused in this sea, 
why are you taking me , 
'till the end of time, 
I would have followed you, 
I will follow... you 
hahahhahahah 

PIRATES!!! OPEN FIRE , 
PIRATES!!! TAKING FIRE, 
PIRATES!!! AYE AYE CAPTAIN, 
PIRATES!!! WE ARE ALIVE, 

we will never betray our brothers of blood, we will kill, we will never betray 
we will die for you my brothers my blood, we will kill , we will die but we will never betray 
we will never betray our brothers of blood, we will kill, we will never betray 
we will die for you my brothers my blood, we will kill , we will die but we will never betray
