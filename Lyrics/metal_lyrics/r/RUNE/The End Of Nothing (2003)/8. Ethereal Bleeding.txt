Other notes:
We are eyes with lids that slip low with exhaustion and apathy.
We are undoubtedly on our last leg. Extinction is eminent.
Though we are without hope, we appreciate time bringing us here to witness the end of what the people of the past have prepared.
Thanks to the unsympathetic anguish of a world on its knees for inspiring this creation.
Also a thanks to our friends, families, all that has inspired us and Willowtip and Relapse for believing in our vision.
The struggle has just begun - give up.
