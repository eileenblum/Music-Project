You've stolen my heart and just left me in agony
Scarred and wounded by your dark and heartless fantasy
Your poisoned love controls their souls
You've killed them all and ran so far

Awakened the devils
Defaced all the souls that you found
Caustic like the fire
Burned all the hearts around

The sky will die when the sun goes home
But how can the trees live without any roots
The devil and you wear the same evil smile
Angels can't escape your forsaken damned lies

Awakened the devils
Defaced all the souls that you found
Caustic like the fire
Burned all the hearts around
