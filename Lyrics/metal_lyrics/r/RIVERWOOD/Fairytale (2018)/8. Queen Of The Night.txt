Once was a time in the white desert cold
A place she could call her home
And then came the darkness grievance and hate
From the hands of love she is afraid

Black endless nights in the shadows of hell
Her fearful mind has gone beyond the sun

Skies have called for the help of the sea
Over the hills where the people died
What future will be with the cloud and the trees?
To be the queen of the night

And tale carries on
And tale carries on
And tale carries on
And on
