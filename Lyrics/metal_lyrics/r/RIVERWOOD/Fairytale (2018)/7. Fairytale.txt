Afraid of walking down
This empty road alone
But there's so many stories
That were left untold
Smells like a rotten core
Death moves up in the air
Tho I need to put an end
To your fairytale
Fairytale

So I breath in this atmosphere
Build a weapon inside of me
As the past is fading out
I'm digging in
I'm throwing my fears away
Surviving out today
Won't live a life in the rain
I'm whole again

Falling hard
Into the fear
Broken hearts
The night is here
Worlds burn before my eyes
As if it's my demise
Dive into the dark
Soul feeding and on their hearts
Hear the voices scream
For your fairytale

So I breath in this atmosphere
Build a weapon inside of me
As the past is fading out
I'm digging in
I'm throwing my fears away
Surviving out today
Won't live a life in the rain
I'm whole again

I saw something moving near the open waters
I've tried to come closer but it disappeared
I feel someone is breathing behind me
But when I look back I only see my shadow
No.. It cannot be my shadow
It doesn't follow my moves
I'm not alone
There's someone here
