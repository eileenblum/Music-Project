Darkening skies below the sea.
Marching through the mighty waves
A ship is standing tall

Fairytale that has never been seen
Yet it haunts their dreams
Devours their minds

When the darkness kissed
The lips of the skies
And the sea has turned into grey
Horrific visions came by
As the ship will fall
They all gonna die

MÃ¶t ditt Ã¶de

Sailing beneath the ocean's gravity
On its frozen floor
Sunlight doesn't rise

And floating remains of elder war machines
Rusting skeletons
Are hanging from above

When the darkness kissed
The lips of the skies
And the sea has turned into gray
Horrific visions came by
As the ship will fall
They all gonna die

When the waters kissed
The lips of their fate
And the blood in their veins was running cold
Shallow hearts
There is no escape
From the creatures they behold

MÃ¶t ditt Ã¶de

The storm
Is getting dark
The ship is sinking down
Is this the end

A funeral
No one attends
Whisper in the dark
I'll haunt you down in the bedtime stories

MÃ¶t ditt Ã¶de
MÃ¶t ditt Ã¶de
MÃ¶t ditt Ã¶de
MÃ¶t ditt Ã¶de
