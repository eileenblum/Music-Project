Rising sun is still in the east
But signing no light to my spirit
Moonlighting in the dark of night
But never laying in my deepest

Wake up and rising the spirit
Riding on the strom and light
Prepare yourâs for fighting
Drive away your humanity

Rising sun invities me to come
We do not need guide to go
The spirit is the oneâs my lord
No one canât stop I fly
