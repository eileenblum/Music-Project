[Graves/Crystal]

[1ST VERSE:]
[vocal: Rob Graves]
Woe...Loud...
We call to you from beyond the grave...
My crusting writhing rotting metal slaves...
Power forged in fire throughout the land...
The weak must die we'll take a metal stand...
[CHORUS:]
Wake, wake the dead...
[2ND VERSE:]
Massive molding armies who have been freed...
Waiting as we plant our metal seed...
Spreading like infection throughout the world...
You'll take our injection with a metal sword...
[BRIDGE:]
Wake, wake, wake...
[lead solo: Rob Graves]
[3RD VERSE:]
I can see them coming through the fire...
I can see them crawling from their graves...
Loud...
[REPEAT BRIDGE:]
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
[4TH VERSE:]
Come join us we'll wake the dead...
