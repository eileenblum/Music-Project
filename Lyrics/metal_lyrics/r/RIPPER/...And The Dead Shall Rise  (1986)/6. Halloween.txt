[Graves]

[1ST VERSE:]
[vocal: Rob Graves]
Night has fallen, the wind begins to blow... Children at play in the streets, the ones you know... Clouds fill the sky, the leaves are falling down... A cauldron of black spills a spell onto your town...
[1ST CHORUS:]
[backing vocal: J.D.Shadowz]
Tonight is halloween, your heart turns to stone... Theres death on halloween, spells of death will be sown... You'll die on halloween, on the sacrificial mound... Tonight is halloween, where remains will be found...
[2ND VERSE:]
Descending down like you knew they would... Bringing death to your neighborhood... Children dance unsuspectingly... Their blood will spill on this sacred eve... 
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
[3RD VERSE:]
Slaughtered lambs on the ground, they bleed... Eating flesh is their only need... You want to wake from this dream of hell... This is no dream, you know damn well... 
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
[lead solo: Rob Graves]
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
Halloween
