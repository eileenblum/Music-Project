[Graves/Paine/Shadowz]

[1ST VERSE:]
[vocal: Sadie Paine]
Your time to rise, lust in your eyes...
I hear the cries, pain in your thighs...
Love hard as steel, you burn to feel...
Come to the cave, make you my slave...
[1ST BRIDGE:]
Tied and helpless, take you tonight...
[CHORUS:]
Wont tie you down, just tie you up...
Wont tie you down, tie you up, tie you...
Dont tie me down, just tie me up...
Dont tie me down, tie me up, tie me up...
[2ND VERSE:]
Youre not the first, wont be the last...
My love you thirst, dont drink too fast...
Bang on my door, beg me for more...
Fill you with pain, drive you insane...
[2ND BRIDGE:]
Tied and helpless, take me tonight...
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
[lead solo: Rob Graves]
[REPEAT 2ND BRIDGE:]
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
