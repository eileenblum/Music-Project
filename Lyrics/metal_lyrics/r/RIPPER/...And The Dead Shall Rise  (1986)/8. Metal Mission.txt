[Graves/Shadowz]

[INTRO:]
[vocal: Rob Graves]
I know what it's like to be alone...
In a world of desperation...
I've heard and I've seen it all before...
From human pretension...
But I know that strongly I'll survive...
As long as I play, metal...
[1ST VERSE:]
Metal is inside me...
Metal is all around me...
Metal is universal now...
You must all crack your skulls...
[2ND VERSE:]
Slicing down to the bone...
Seizing the metal throne...
Molten blood is pounding...
Through your metal veins...
[1ST CHORUS:]
Mezmerizing, pulverizing...
Death defying, never lying...
Metal mission, steel precision...
Show the world the metal law...
Crack you skulls...
[lead solo: Rob Graves]
[2ND CHORUS:]
Feeling stronger, thrashing longer...
Sparing no one, our deed must be done...
Metal mission, steel precision...
Show the world the metal law...
Crack your skulls...
