[Graves/Paine/Shadowz]

[1ST VERSE:]
[vocal: Sadie Paine]
When the full moon lights up the night... Thats when my hunger is right... The fog creeps and covers the ground... Your blood chills when you hear the sound...
[1ST CHORUS:]
A 440 six-pack that screams through the night... A wicked black Cuda of muscle and might... I'm stalking the city, I'm ruling the night... I am The Night Cruizer until morning light... 
[2ND VERSE:]
I pull to the curb, I've spotted my prey... I smile and lick my lips, you'll do as I say... Look deep into my eyes, you feel my fire... You'll fill my need as you spill your desire... 
[2ND CHORUS:]
I have the power to make you my slave... Or eat you and beat you and throw you away... But I think I'll bite, you look good to me... Once I have done so, you'll never be free... 
[lead solo: Rob Graves]
[3RD VERSE:]
Time to shift your gears into overdrive... My never ending thirst is unsatisfied... Hammering, pile-driving your stake into me... Feeding the fire and burning the meat... 
[3RD CHORUS:]
Dawn is approaching, I cant hang around... Cold, blue and lifeless is how you'll be found... I fade into black, I return to the ground... New victims await me tonight at sundown...(end solo:Crystal)
