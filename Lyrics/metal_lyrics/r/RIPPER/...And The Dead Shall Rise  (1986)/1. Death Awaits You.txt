[Graves/Paine]

[1ST VERSE:]
[vocal: Johnny"Death"Crystal]
I look almost human by the light of the moon... You knew I'd be coming but not this soon... My sickle looks cold and sharp to the touch... A well executed swing wont hurt too much...
[1ST CHORUS:]
Death awaits you... Death awaits you... You cant see me at night but you know I'm there... The full moon is my killing light, the grave my lair... 
[2ND VERSE:]
Terrified you search for a safe place to hide... But at each dead end turn I'll be standing by your side... My boney fingers stretch out and clutch at your sleeve... My toothy grin flashes, its time to leave... 
[2ND CHORUS:]
Death awaits you... Death awaits you... Death awaits you... Death awaits... 
[lead solo: Johnny"Death"Crystal]
[3RD CHORUS:]
Death awaits you... Death awaits you... Death awaits you... Death awaits you and you and you and you
