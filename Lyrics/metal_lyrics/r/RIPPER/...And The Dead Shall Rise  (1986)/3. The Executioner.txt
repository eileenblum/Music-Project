[Graves]

[1ST VERSE]
[vocal: J.D.Shadowz]
Come to me your time is near... You're living your last day... Beg me crawling in your fear... I enjoy it more that way...
[CHORUS:]
Beg me, beg me, beg me, I am The Executioner... 
[2ND VERSE:]
Remember now just what you said... You'll never die this way... Your rotting corpse will have no head... When you lie in your grave... 
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
[lead solo: Rob Graves]
[3RD VERSE:]
And so my metal blade does fall... Your blood runs down my thigh... Its when you know youre safe from death... That you will surely die... 
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
[scream: Rob Graves]
