[Graves/Paine]

[1ST VERSE:]
[vocal: Rob Graves]
I walk day and night from grave to grave... Lurking and searching for someone to save... By the light of the moon I dig up the ground... When I know theres no one around...
[CHORUS:]
I shovel and dig through the mounds of fresh sand... In hopes of finding a cold and clammy hand... But all I find is rotting flesh turned to dust... Even that I hold and fondle with lust... 
[2ND VERSE:]
Digging and poking around your rotting bones... Who knows what I'll do when its you that I own... I'll dig up your tomb on a cold night in the rain... But dont you worry, when youre dead you feel no pain, sweet pain... 
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
[lead solo: Rob Graves]
[3RD VERSE:]
So when your time comes and your life must cease... Dont expect to rest in peace [laughs]... 
Because I'm waiting to dig you up too... I suggest cremation the wise thing to do...
[REPEAT CHORUS:]
