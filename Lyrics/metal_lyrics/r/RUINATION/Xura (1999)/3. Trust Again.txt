The flash of fire descends
In moments sky's in grief
Lusts overfilled voluptuous flesh
I lie entombed, bereaved
Falling from the grace
My eyes are clear deep
Under Blackened glasses
Longing for the dawn
My beggar god's return
My dirty name of love
Like dust is pouring underfoot
In sick perception's dream
These hollow dreams will bleed
Like a rainful day
Like abounding place in stubs
Where ancient forest ever grown
Where I had grown
Beyond unknown

I'm embraced
Don't care: right or astray
Sky turns grey
But I trust again

I hate this wounded air
But I trust again
In shameless sun and moon
Upon I always howl
I trust in blood which is
Getting numb in veins
Worshipped by millenniums
Raped by modern brains
