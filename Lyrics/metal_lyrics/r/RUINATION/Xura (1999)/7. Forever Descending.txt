The extension of the black in the gulf of universe
The vastness of the space setting
The countless antitheses
Depressively bleak depths
Glimpse of the way in which world of dreams
Borders upon the real
Bury the dark irrational
Side of your queasy being
I'll rise to destroy you
In the shreds of liquid dementia
Wreak that havoc upon the outness
Rip the mask of chronic blindness
Highly violent blindest nature
Inscrutable malice sine wing it
All my soul within me burning
Fantastic terrors never felt before.

Euthanasia from the bloody hands of god
Threshold between reason and madness
Sarcastic descriptions of existential cuts
Dreaming behind insensible pane
Suffering beyond the outside world
Initial conditions bloom again

The reckless and unworshipping things
That lives and seek and give
No reasons for the torrid sentience
Uncertainly as to whither own destiny was foreseen
Before birth sentenced to sufferance

Leave me somewhere between faith and doubt
Leave my loneliness unbroken
Dirty souls in the worn bodies
Tortured by nameless fears and longings
Dread extinction and nothingness
