Did you find depths of mind?
I want you to feel
Do you hear screams from fear?
I want something to reveal for you

Open your eyes, what do you see?
You see only me
Give a glance to distant tree
It looks like me
Why did you find the way?
It is in grain
But if you do a mistake
It leads astray

Don't take my name in vain
Don't take my name...

Take your chance don't look back
There can be a dark
Heal your soul it's not a crack
Don't be a shark
