Shattered fate falling down
Looking back, falling once again
Take a flight to the edge of the world
Through the circle of constant pain
I saw the flood of dizzy angels
Mend the shredded shroud
Devoid of control
This skin, the ride takes me so high

I struggle in pain coming out of focus
The world in stain (around you)
It's what you never wanted

Final struggle against for hours
I knew it would never last
It thrives beneath the blood
It engraves you in daydream
Exploring the depths of unspoken abyss
Enjoy the high. Hit the ground.
Slowly freezing moments
Of ultimate sickening joy

Hungry eyes like acid blue
This is it when it gets to you
Where do I find what I've been shown?
Walking in daze with the empty hands
Sickener's seed azure devils in need
The passing days veiled underneath.
Leaving nothing but an empty shell
While I live I ignite in hell

I struggle in pain coming out of focus
The world in stain (around you)
It's what you never wanted
I struggle in pain I like violence in you
The world in stain (around you)
It's like a blackened flower

Final struggle against for hours
I knew it would never last
It thrives beneath the blood
It engraves you in daydream
Exploring the depths of unspoken abyss
Enjoy the high. Hit the ground.
Slowly freezing moments
Of ultimate sickening joy

I struggle in pain coming out of focus
The world in stain (around you)
It's what you never wanted

Painful steps through the valley of shadows
Speck of time. Drown in space.
Day after day I collapse
In a wake of sleepless nights
Alien with you, the demons whispers
Half an angel half a beast
Softly, gently creeping
My name is twisted lust
