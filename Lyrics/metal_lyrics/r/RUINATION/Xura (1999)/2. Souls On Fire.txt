Fallin' star is pulling me down
When I'm thinkin' bout the past
I would give my ears for this calm
This would be my own at last
Please make my all nights shine
Please help me to see in fine
Please explain the dreams of mine
All along the line

Please save me
From my torments ant pangs
Please save
'Cause my all future hangs
By a thread over me

Narrow means is all what I see
In the land where the sun shines bright
I got myself in the blind lead
But I found my second sight

Please save me
'Cause my soul is on fire
Please save me
From the absent desire
Of the flesh within me
