I can't forget you and I cannot back
Night always becomes a pain
Your last words sound till now
I close my eyes and begin to realize

Long way into myself
My singing soul is dying to be free
I am tired from my pain
I can't perceive what's going round

I am afraid of nothing,
I try to forget it all
I am afraid of myself
Something changes in my mind I feel
And begin to realize

Long way into myself
I know my price, I feel my heart
Something changed in my mind
I found my mind, I found here myself
