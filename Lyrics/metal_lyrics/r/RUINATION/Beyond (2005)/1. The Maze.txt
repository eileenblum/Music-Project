I want to say it from my mind
You want to save it from mankind
You tend to draw the line
It has just turned into the might
Nothing can't stop it, do it right
If not this virgin fright

Call it my resolution
Call it whatever it may be
War in hot summer
Sitting on the ice
Call it whatever it may be
Allright, delight...
You call it whatever it may be

Don't know what happened through these days
No one believes it anyway
Sometimes these days of trace
Are like a sickly drunk parade
A part of crazy masquerade
Subconscious bestial maze

Call it...

Isn't it strange that the eyes are staring at the flesh
Isn't it strange that the heart starts beating fast oh fast
Isn't it strange that the blood is running from your lips
Isn't it strange that somebody is sucking it so fast oh fast
