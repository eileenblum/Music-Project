Hoist our sails
At the edge of the world
What we're searching for?
As strangers in private ball
This black corvette of bliss
Shall wipe away our tears
Praise captain for today
Who owns this black universe

Jealousy burns in their eyes
In eyes of onshore whores
It makes me almost undisguised
And naked from the core

Keep tracking on your heaven
Although I'm cold to your way
Every forthcoming day
It seems as new, but feels the same
And sense of sameness
Couldn't let to repose
I have a gift divine - my gulf of calm

And at the edge I freeze
Just found my quiet home
The smile of warm summer breeze
Flatters me forevermore

Time shall erase the trace
So, heaven I'll deny
I own a promised land
Eternally bound to die
