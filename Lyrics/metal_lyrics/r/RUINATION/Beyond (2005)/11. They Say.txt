Our ways to the sun, they never end
We feel the breath of holy spirits that defend
Us from the evil darkness hand
From ghostly sights of human fancy - monster land

You see the God in white surrounded by the saints
See the gods in white that live behind the veil

They say
Your love will never die
They say
People never cry
They say
There is no pain and pangs
And no disease and fear and hate
and tears in your illusion land

Our life is a fight against the force
The everlasting triumph against religious wars
A constant growing, passing doors
And fording rivers of perpetual trials

You see the God in white surrounded by the saints
See the gods in white that live behind the veil

They say
Your love will never die
They say
People never cry
They say
There is no pain and pangs
And no disease and fear and hate
and tears in your illusion land
