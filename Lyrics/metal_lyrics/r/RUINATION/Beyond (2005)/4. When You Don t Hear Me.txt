Touch my face
Do you feel the wrinkles?
Kiss my face
Do you feel the taste of sorrow and belief?

Touch my cheeks
See, they're weather-beaten
Kiss my cheeks
Do you see I need to talk, I need relief?

Touch my eyes
Do you see them crying?
Kiss my eyes
You see, my tears are sweet...

It hurts when you don't want to hear (me)
It hurts when you just try to tear away
My gloomy heart from yours...
It hurts when you erase our dreams
But I believe in our love - it streams
And it will bloom again!

Touch my lips
Do you see they got chapped?
Kiss my lips
Do you feel the taste of sorrow and belief?

Touch my tears
Do you feel the lightness?
Kiss my tears
You see I felt relieved.....

Touch my face
Kiss my face
Touch my cheeks
Kiss my cheeks
Touch my eyes
Kiss my eyes
Touch my lips
Kiss my lips
Touch my tears
Kiss my tears
