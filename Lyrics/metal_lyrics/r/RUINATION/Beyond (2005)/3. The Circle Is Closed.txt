The circle is closed
So do anything
'Cause there is no reason
To long for the season
That went to the end

So this is the song
The plead for mercy
And there is no freedom
The silence is wisdom
In union they stand

Alive
The daybreak comes soon
It will drive the shadows
And creatures of night
Away from you
Ado
It will drive it too
Together with shadows
And creatures of night
Away from you

Outside the sphere
The night stays bravely
With burning horizons
And blinding rivers
Of the lightning trees
And now can you hear
How light is coming in
It enters the house
Of darkness and anger
Of love and despair

Alive
The daybreak comes soon
It will drive the shadows
And creatures of night
Away from you
Ado
It wills it too
Together with shadows
And creatures of night
Away from you

The circle is closed until the break of day
The circle is closed until the break of day
