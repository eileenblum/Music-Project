It seems like only Holy Mother comes to let you in
Pressing to the juicy bosom, closer to the sin
Dancing on the stage like madness, naked and delight
Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol to hide

Crack of mind people deride
They will ruin all the pride
Walk the path of love and fight
Towards the sun, towards the light

Jenny reptile, all her friends say they're gonna be with you
Pure friendship, devotion, say they're gonna be with you
Laughing at your actions, humiliating in all ways
It seems like only burning evil comes to let you in

Somebody tell me what is dear
Somebody tell me what is clear, near and dear
In all this dung where egoism rules
And all this cramp strangling all of us

Jenny reptile, all her friends say they're gonna be with you
Johnny asshole and his friends say they're gonna be with you
Through state and all the pigs say they're gonna be with you
Church depravers and the priests say they're gonna be with you
Laughing at your actions, humiliating in all ways
It seems like only burning evil comes to let you in
