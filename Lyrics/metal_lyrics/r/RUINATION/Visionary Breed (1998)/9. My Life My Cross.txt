The real life of man is somewhere deeper
It flows inviable and growls
Like underground waters. I want to cut
My way to it some day

Years run faster than
Roaring rivers of my tears
I am sleeping with open eyes
My solitude - my cross

Years run faster than
Roaring rivers of my tears
I am sleeping with open eyes
My solitude - my cross

Frost shakes my tired body
When I look into your eyes and soul
The real life of man is somewhere deeper
My whole life - my cross
