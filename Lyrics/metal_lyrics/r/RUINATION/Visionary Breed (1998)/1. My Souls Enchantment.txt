My primal blaze, my painful fate
I lost my love, I feel your blame
The endless fear takes me tonight
There is no life, there is no light
The creeping pain controls your brains
The end of life for you is near
I will be dead, I'm not afraid
The blameless world we will create

My soul's enchantment at the doors
I'm looking for the naked forms
The painless flowers slowly die
And disappear in bleeding sky
My soul's enchantment at the doors
I'm looking for the naked forms
The darkest people bless your face
And I ignite the human race

And I will find the trees of mind
I'll be a king and rule my land
And don't betray my real name
I want to fly, still in the sky

My primal blaze, my painful fate
I lost my love, I feel your blame
The endless fear takes me tonight
There is no life, there is no light
The creeping pain controls your brains
The end of life for you is near
I will be dead, I'm not afraid
The blameless world we will create

My soul's enchantment at the doors
I'm looking for the naked forms
The painless flowers slowly die
And disappear in bleeding sky
My soul's enchantment at the doors
I'm looking for the naked forms
The darkest people bless your face
And I ignite the human race
