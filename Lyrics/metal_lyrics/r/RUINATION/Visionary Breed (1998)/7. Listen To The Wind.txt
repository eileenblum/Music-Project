My soul rows like bird against
the wind I want to test and find
My strengths of mind
Different people offten lie
out of whole cloth into eyes
But i deny my lie

Listen to the wind: it's melody of sky
Listen to the wind: when your eyes cannot cry
Listen to the wind: when your lips get dry
Listen to the wind....

My head goes round from that noise
which bidding down to my choice to find
My strengths of mind
Birds are flying to the south,
I'm opening my eyes
Look at them and look

Listen to the wind: it's melody of sky
Listen to the wind: when your eyes cannot cry
Listen to the wind: when your lips get dry
Listen to the wind....
