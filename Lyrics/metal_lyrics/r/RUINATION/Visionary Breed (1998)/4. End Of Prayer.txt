Life is ours and every day for us something new
We don't want to know what do we really want. Is it true?

End your prayer to a God
Move fight in yourself

Why, have I try to comprehend the truth and lie
To behave myself even I can't do it
Now, when I know where to go and how to live in this world
I'll show you who I am and what's in my mind

Many times we hear what's about what we have to do
Can we dream about world which we create or subdue

Why, have I try to comprehend the truth and lie
To behave myself even I can't do it
Now, when I know where to go and how to live in this world
I'll show you who I am and what's in my mind

End your prayer to a God
Move fight in yourself

Why, have I try to comprehend the truth and lie
To behave myself even I can't do it
Now, when I know where to go and how to live in this world
I'll show you who I am and what's in my mind
