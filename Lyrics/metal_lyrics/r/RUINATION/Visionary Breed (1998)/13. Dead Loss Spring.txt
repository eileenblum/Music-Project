Everything is knocked out of my legs
Like chair for killer who'll be hanged
Something takes my sin my health for me
Now I've only creative work

I am waiting for my spring
(The) Sun has rised in my heart
If you want me to sing
Recollections grow apart

I am waiting for my spring
(The) Sun has rised in my heart
If you want me to sing
Recollections grow apart

I am waiting for my spring
(The) Sun has rised in my heart
If you want me to sing
Recollections grow apart

I am waiting for my spring
(The) Sun has rised in my heart
If you want me to sing
Recollections grow apart
