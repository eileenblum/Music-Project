I can't listen to you... I know... when i walk in the clouds
Different voices I hear inside of me, it's my conscience

These years of madness
These blissful days
I tried to hold you
I'm out of place

I found my feelings, I lost my plans
I found my feelings, my common sense
I see your face when I close my eyes
And I affraid (of) you when dream arrives
I dream of your lips on last sunrise
It is too complex to realize

I can't hear you because... I know... it's too late, you're dead
I live in my dreams, my thoughts and I hope for meeting with you

These years of madness
These blissful days
I tried to hold you
I'm out of place

I found my feelings, I lost my plans
I found my feelings, my common sense
I see your face when I close my eyes
And I affraid (of) you when dream arrives
I dream of your lips on last sunrise
It is too complex to realize

I found my feelings, I lost my plans
I found my feelings, my common sense
I see your face when I close my eyes
And I affraid (of) you when dream arrives
I dream of your lips on last sunrise
It is too complex to realize
