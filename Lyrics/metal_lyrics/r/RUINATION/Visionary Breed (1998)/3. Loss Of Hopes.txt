Pain hurts my singing soul
Rain washes my face recalls that I'm alone
Sun shines through rain and clouds
Man looks at me and tells "you lost your chance"

I hear your voice inside me
(I hear your voice inside me)
I see your picture in the bog
(I see your picture in the bog)

Say, say that I'm unfair
Day after day I think of my blunder
Why am I so incorrect?
Try to forget me 'cause I'm introvert

My........ eyes look at the still
My further fate is sealed
I am on the beam
In my present thoughts

Why will you never see me with The Sun in the sky?
I, I will never see you in the world where I die...
Why will you never see me with The Sun in the sky?
I, I will never see you in the world where I die...

My........ eyes look at the still
My further fate is sealed
I am on the beam
In my present thoughts
