Open mind for me
I will want to say for you
You will understand
Never say goodbye
I will know that from your eyes
Take my breath away

Never say goodbye
I will know that from your eyes,
From your eyes...

Forgive, if somebody forgot your words
Perceive, that nobody cares of your thoughts
Believe in yourself and feel delight
Receive,  that in your hands you keep your life

What's the price of life
Pay your price for happiness
Who knows how to live
Do not affraid of truth
Many times I heard these words
Who will need me.... yeah

Do not affraid of truth
Many times I saw these words
In your eyes.....

Forgive, if somebody forgot your words
Perceive, that nobody cares of your thoughts
Believe in yourself and feel delight
Receive,  that in your hands you keep your life

Forgive, if somebody forgot your words
Perceive, that nobody cares of your thoughts
Believe in yourself and feel delight
Receive,  that in your hands you keep your life
