I want to spend my time with trees
To hear their rustle to forget my dreams
I want to see the falling start at night
The flying bird in the wind's eye

Never.. never I will see the Sun and sky
Never.. never I will understand your sigh
Never.. never I will know what is snow
Never.. never I'll forget my last vow

I want to hear how rain knocks outdoors
I know what I can but I want more
How can my soul to bloom? Who knows...
Sometime you brought me red rose

Falling leaves inform about the fall
You told me so but you have to go
I need your hand and warm today
I just know it is my way

Never.. never I will see the Sun and sky
Never.. never I will understand your sigh
Never.. never I will know what is snow
Never.. never I'll forget my last vow

Never.. never I will see the Sun and sky
Never.. never I will understand your sigh
Never.. never I will know what is snow
Never.. never I'll forget my last vow
