If you will become a lass
Don't you know I'll kick your ass
If you ever sell the pass
I will tell you go to grass

Don't be angry with me and forgive
Sometimes it can be in vogue
Sometimes it can be a joke, can't it?
Just a joke... just a joke

A joke... just a joke... a joke...

There is no hurry to choose
'cause I'll tell you "hey you loose"
Never try to be very cool
Everyone will say "he's a fool"

Don't be angry with me and forgive
Sometimes it can be in vogue
Sometimes it can be a joke, can't it?
Just a joke... just a joke

A joke... just a joke... a joke... just a joke
A joke... just a joke... a joke... just a joke
