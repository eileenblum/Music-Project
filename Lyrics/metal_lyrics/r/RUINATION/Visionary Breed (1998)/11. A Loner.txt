When i just walk in the town
Every fucking man has a down on me
They dislike my clothing and my long hair,
earrings and slang. Who cares?

Can I feel what every man feels every day?
Yes I feel that. It's my way. I'm not a vain!

They think I have devil's sould
But I know I'm not alone, alone.
Why have you to look like they?
Every man asks me... I say - "it's my way"

Can I feel what every man feels every day?
Yes I feel that. It's my way. I'm not a vain!

Don't look like man which tells me
When you have to be like normal men
Already better be like yourself....
Don't look like man which tells me
When you have to be like normal men
Already better be like yourself....

Can I feel what every man feels every day?
Yes I feel that. It's my way. I'm not a vain!

I'm not a vain, yeah!
Not a vain......
Vain....
