Sun taled to me you're a bastard child
Your meaning is none and small mission is done

Call civilization, destruction, creation
New generations gain
Over and over the time is moving slower
Dancing on your useless remain

I am alone at this kingdome without crown
Holding angels in my pocket, rule the ocean without storm

Dazzling whore now is hidden behind
The sea of coloured leaves
She wants show me the place where I can find
The truth of forgotten believes

Call civilization, destruction, creation
New generations gain
Over and over the time is moving slower
Dancing on your useless remain

I walk within dirty heaven closer to goddess skin
Tryin' to pass, to catch, to breath: that's the blazing autumn's gift

Dazzling whore now is hidden behind
The sea of coloured leaves
She wants show me the place where I can find
The truth of forgotten believes

Dazzling whore now is hidden behind
The sea of coloured leaves
She wants show me the place where I can find
The truth of forgotten believes

Of forgotten believes...
