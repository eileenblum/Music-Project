Whenever will i comprehend, that nothing lasts forever
The Sun will never shine at night
Your silence tells me everything
I call you by my eyes, I dream to come back to my world

I sacrifice myself to you
My soul remains far away

Wherever you are I will see, that I can't live without you
The bird is singing on my hand
I want to see the back of dreams
My beating heart is broken I want to come back to my world

I sacrifice myself to you
My soul remains far away
You opening my eayes for me
I'm melting from your look
