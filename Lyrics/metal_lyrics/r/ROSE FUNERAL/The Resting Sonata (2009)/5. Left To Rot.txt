You're wasting your time.
There's nobody there.
Close your fucking books because nobody cares.

The skies are empty.
We're on our own.
What makes you think that we're not alone?

Stories, bullshit fantasies.
It's nothing, I will make you see.

When it's over and you're rotting in your tomb,
You didn't think this would be happening to you.
Another godless soul is growing in the womb,
You didn't think this would be happening to you.

How have these lies reached this far?
They have proved nothing,
Just built the scars on the martyr who died in vain.

Kill!

You have all died in vain. Sentenced by your ''sins.''
You think you're damned to a horrible end.

You're all alone in your wretched casket.
No religion, just maggots feeding on your skin.

I will kill,
I will find you.

God you're a rotting bitch!
