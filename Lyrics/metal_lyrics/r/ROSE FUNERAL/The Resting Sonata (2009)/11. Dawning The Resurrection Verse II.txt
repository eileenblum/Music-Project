You scream for your god, but all you see is me.
Try to claw all you want, there's no escaping thee.
Draw the blade from its sheath, hollowing your insides.
You kick and bleed.

Fingernails are torn off, teeth are broke away.
The knife is deep inside you, hear these words I say.

You're nothing, the fucking scum of life.
I've come to take you, you're dead tonight.

I try to hold you as you struggle to focus on me.
Your eyes are rolled back in your head with pain.

Motionless, you can't move a fucking limb.
Blinded, all you see is darkness.
