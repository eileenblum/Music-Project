I feel the ground before my feet. Its wretched dirt.
The wind encased with every dying breath of blood thirst.
I've touched the hand of god and crushed in his fucking teeth.
Undying, undead, reach for you beneath.

I set my paths for you,
To unanswered cries.
I spill the blood off my hands,
And now we watch you die.

As dawn is rising full of death, he'll beg to me.
His carcass fills my eyes.
Demise of all holy.

It's all over. These streets are fucking bare.
They never knew the end was drawing near.
The tears that shed, the blood that ran.
This is how it all began.
Our greatest fears have come to damn.
This is now the fall of man.

As dawn is rising full of death, he'll beg to me.
His carcass fills my eyes.
Demise of all holy.

I feel the ground before my feet, its wretched dirt.
The wind encased with every dying breath of blood thirst.
I've touched the hand of god and crushed in his fucking teeth.
Undying, undead, reach for you beneath.
