Risen,
I have come to take the souls of the dead.
Encasing carcasses,
I drink the blood of the buried and sever them.
Decomposing extremities.

When everything has fell into eternity,
The depths grasp all who it finds.
Flames burn amongst this ruined dead city,
To bury god and crush mankind.

Suicide or their choice to die,
For they all believe in the entity.
With clean bitter taste of the ones who betray,
I have come to pull you down.
Seeking,
Taking,
Calling from above,
The blackened dove,
To my own love.
Of the skin smelling so alive,
Clearly they are calling to me,
My slaves of a dying Christianity.
I destroy everything I seek,
Slaying for humanity.
Wretched I have come to kill you,
Carving guts just to make them spill through.

When everything has fell into eternity,
The depths grasp all who it finds.
Flames burn amongst this ruined dead city,
To bury god and crush mankind.

Risen,
I have come to take the souls of the dead.
Encasing carcasses,
I drink the blood of the buried and sever them.
Decomposing extremities.

I have never loved you,
My dear you taste so divine.
With slashing comes bashing,
Your blood is mine.
