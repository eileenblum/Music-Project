Rot through the skin. Deep within is where the cut and scythe
Bleed them out. They spill about. One by one they end a life.
Hacking, they butchered them malevolently. Extirpate. Annihilate.
Bring forth unholy

Amputation is done by singularity
The fixation on the cold body enlightens me
Draining blood, I cut, I slice, I slash, I dice the skin
Untouched, they pray I stop, but I start to begin
