Suffocation I strangulate them,
They deny such a lie through deception,
I marked the day that everybody dies,
They await the rise of a being in disguise,
Where is the sign that you claim to be divine?

Dead,
There is no holy,
Only bloodshed through desultory.
Spread,
A false story,
Breed to fear in a fallacy,
Watch them die.

Prevarications,
An allegory for the foolish nations,
I marked the day that everybody dies,
They await the rise of a being in disguise,
Where is the sign that you claim to be divine?

So divine.

Die,
Watch them die.
So divine,
They confine,
They decline.

Rest upon your delicate possession,
Push aside your failure of digression,
You walk a path,
A life of extortion.
To spread your myth of antic corruption.

Delude,
Telling lies with aspersion.
Obtrude,
Spread fear by conversion.
Death,
There is no holy,
Only bloodshed through desultory.
