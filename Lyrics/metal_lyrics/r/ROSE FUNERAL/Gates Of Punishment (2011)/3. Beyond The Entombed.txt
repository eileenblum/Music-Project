Beyond the gates of entombment
I feel illuminating creation
The blinding light is eclipsed
With a stench of human cremation

Await the desolation
Of the gods in which I'll slay
Take away each gasping breath
Abort the ones who pray
Kicking slashing
Choking from above
I've killed them
Accession of the dead
The rotting begins to spread
I have killed them all

Eclipse the sky with doom
I've seen their light I've spread the night
To taste once more
And they'll beg, and they'll scream to you

Judgement. No fate.
No faith, no truth, no life, just certainty
The gate burns upon their need for insanity
I have become, the one, to kill the son
Bearing the weight of the crutch. All lies.

Eclipse the sky with doom

Beyond the gates of entombment
I feel illuminating creation
The blinding light is eclipsed
With a stench of human cremation
A mortal form has begun desecration
I feel (I feel) they kneel (they kneel)
This night is mine.
