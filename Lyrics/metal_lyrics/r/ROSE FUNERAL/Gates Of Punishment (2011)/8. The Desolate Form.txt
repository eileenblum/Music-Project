Split apart the chest,
Peel the skin,
Cut within,
Tie them to the bed,
Grab my knife,
Take the life.

I canât control myself.
Dissolution,
Ending lives,
On a killing spree,
Separation desecration,
Of the third degree.

Blood fills up the lungs,
When they choke,
On my cum.
Fuck them 'til theyâre dead,
Grab my knife,
Take the life.

They canât control themselves,
Disappearance,
Ending lives,
On a killing spree.
Molestation concentration,
On fulfilling me.

Pull the skin apart,
Ripping out the heart,
Dismantle them from the start,
Murdering becomes my art.

Dissolution,
Ending lives,
On a killing spree,
Separation desecration,
Of the third degree.
Disappearance,
Ending lives,
On a killing spree.

Molestation concentration,
On fulfilling me.

I wonât take it back,
My lust wonât stop,
Watch them laid to rest,
Stacked and piled on top.

All the ashes burn,
With a stench of skin,
Turning organ to urn,
I start to kill again.

Butcher everyone,
I want to kill them all.

I wonât take it back,
My lust wonât stop,
Theyâre laid to rest,
Defiled.
