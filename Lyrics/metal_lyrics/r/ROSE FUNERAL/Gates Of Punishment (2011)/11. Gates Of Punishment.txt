Welcome to the depths,
Immolated one.
Fulfill your regrets,
Slaughter has begun.
Mutilated dawning,
Squirting everywhere.
Mangled bodies form,
Leaving bones to spare,
Children left forlorn,
Masticate the still born.

Call upon the legion,
Outride the horsemen of doom.
The propitious life,
Skinned alive in its tomb.

Squirting everywhere.
Mangled bodies form,
Leaving bones to spare,
Children left forlorn,
Masticate the still born.
Welcome to the depths,
Immolated one.
Fulfill your regrets,
Slaughter has begun.
Mutilated dawning.

Now pray to all who neglects you,
The celestial world of demise.
Impalement,
Misery,
They bind them all to see,
Mortal internecion.

Pulverize carve them into fragments,
Dissection subdue,
Lacerate hack them into pieces,
Torturing blood spills through.

Now pray to all who neglects you,
The celestial world of demise.
Impalement,
Misery,
They bind them all to see.

Fixate on suffocation,
The holy being massacre,
Sent to bring them desecration,
Domination by manslaughter.

Welcome to your depths,
Cast down and undone,
Fulfill your regrets,
Slaughter has begun.

Iâve opened the gates of punishment.

I just want to end them all again.
