I'm waiting in the darkness
Her blood will soon be mine
She took this life for granted
Her body they won't find

I'll show her evil that she never knew existed
She starts to pray as she is being mutilated

I torture rape and kill
Under a godless sky

Killing for pleasure, my need for blood will not stop
I live for your death, for your pain, I am insane
I will not stop until your dead and buried,
Dismembered and nameless
They will not find me

Pray to your god that's nowhere
By my hands, you will die
I torture rape and kill
Under a godless sky

I disfigure her body
Lying in her grave
I see only death
I feel no pain

Pray to the god that you think is above
The one who would save you and show you his love
Now you are mine and will not be saved
Dismembered and rotten, fucked in your grave

Killing for pleasure, my need for blood will not stop
I live for your death, for your pain, I am insane
I will not stop until your dead and buried,
Dismembered and nameless
They will not find me

She lies under a godless sky
