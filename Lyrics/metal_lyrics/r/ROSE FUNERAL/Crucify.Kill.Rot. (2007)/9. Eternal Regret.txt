I want you dead
No longer breathing
Suffering in blood

Die! Feel my pain
Choke on your words
I have no remorse

I want you dead
No longer breathing
Suffering in blood

This is only the beginning feel this fucking pain
Screaming from the knife inside you
Your flesh becomes mine

Haunting on my dreams no longer suffer on your words
Covered in blood barley breathing servering your nerves

You'll suffer in your coffin
You'll suffer in death

I want you dead
No longer breathing
Suffering in blood
I have no remorse
