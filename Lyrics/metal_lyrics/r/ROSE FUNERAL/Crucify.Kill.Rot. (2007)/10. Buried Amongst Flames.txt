Rise upon the face of death
Buried amongst the flames
These servants of torture
Killing for your pain

Tearing into your flesh
Digging into your bone
Your blood becomes the life
Death is all you know
Now you suffer in the darkness

Ripping into you
Exposing your insides
Suffer in your hell
Buried amongst the flames

Taken into torture
To die

Torment your soul in hell
