We will see the fall of mankind
No one can ever save us
Death to all the sinners
And the good will be set free

Blood runs trough the streets
People screaming to him why

The stench of dead bodies
Fill the air
Walking through these corpses
Maggots render their flesh

The only way to live
Is to kill

And make them suffer
Each breath
I have no remorse
For the human race

Soon it will be over
Your life belongs to no one
Corpses fill the street
As you are begging for forgiveness

God's hideous creation

Your body shakes and trembles
When will you be saved
Mankind will suffer for him
We are all dead

We are dead
