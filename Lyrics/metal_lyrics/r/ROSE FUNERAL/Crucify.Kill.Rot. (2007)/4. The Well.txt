Drowning at the bottom of a fucking well

Bodies
Rising from this well
Taken from their grave
In this living hell

Ripping, tearing through the flesh
You will be the first
Victums of their thirst

Blood is spraying
Flash is falling
Dead are rising

Blood is gushing
Start convulsing
Now your turning

Bodies, left for dead
Will-be-rising
Infesting
The human race
To serve their blood lust

Raise the dead
Feast on the living
