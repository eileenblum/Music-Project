[2x]
Blood stains on the walls
Hanging from my hook
Guts spill out onto this floor
From this life I took

[3x]
I crave your body
I need your flesh

In this life of torment
No one will survive
I don't want to hear your screams
I'll only watch you die

Cutting through your flesh
Blood drips out then pours
Hacking up your body
I will kill once more

[2x]
Blood stains on the walls
Hanging from my hook
Guts spill out onto this floor
From this life I took

In this life of torment
No one will survive
I don't want to hear your screams
I'll only watch you die

Cutting through your flesh
Blood drips out then pours
Hacking up your body
I will kill once more

[2x]
Blood stains on the walls
Hanging from my hook
Guts spill out onto this floor
From this life I took

[3x]
Kicking and screaming
Begging for her life

[2x]
I want your body
I crave your flesh
