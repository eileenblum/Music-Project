I roamed beyond laws of time.
Severed from beacons of light.
The agony of the unknown.
Navigate through the smoke.
A sister lays with a brave heart.
Ground vibrates, birds flee and soar.
Sweet lady fly you are free.
Bound by blood always be with me.
I'll wait for spring, her throne will shine again.

Trees sit stripped of leaves.
The morning freeze eats me.
Rowed my boat out to sea.
Her memory is in me.
Fading land draped in white.
Endless waves caught my eye.
Drifting beneath the forsaken sky.
Helpless and lost to hands of time.
