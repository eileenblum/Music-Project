Eyes focused on lines that were blind.
Trees and beings come alive with fire when lights awaken in the night.

Mind waits for the glow.
Wildlife in stone.
Goddess show yourself before the dawn.

Past flared and offered wisps of hope.
Rolled on for miles.
Brought me to my knees and demanded all the air.
Ancient beauty.
