Oh silent night, show me your glory and rain down your light.
The sky and the ground, dark shapes creep around in the kingdom of no life.
They cascade down to masters hollow crown.

I found myself lost amongst these illusions of creation.
The horizon of my knowledge fades behind burning eyes.
Senses dulled and rarely pronounced.
Searching hard to find myself.

A day and night of untamed light.
A coloured sky upon weary eyes.
A sleepy gypsy delicate and frail.
I searched and found salvation from the sounds.
