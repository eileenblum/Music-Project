An empty canvas filled with loving thought, the best I've ever had.
My love come lay a while.
These cold winter nights were long and lonesome.
With smiles and eyes in love.
The sands of time will be forgotten, this perfect moment.
Now you keep me up with all your grace.
You're so blessed, oh so blessed.
My flame burning bright.
