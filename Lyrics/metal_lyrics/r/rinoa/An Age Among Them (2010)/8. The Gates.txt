We fell into rhythm beneath a raging glory.
We marched in oblivion, silent of all sounds.
Lucid visions of the great odyssey.
Our faith among this land of fire.

He took the reins and flew to the west.
We watched with joy until the terrain changed.
Swans grazed the sky and held the last remaining light.
Hearts beat with the life and expels out into the night.
Immersed deep in those fiery eyes.
