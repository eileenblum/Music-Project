We will stand alone, together.
Please go to him.
With broken clocks and concrete walls.
I will starve for you.
Few seconds pass and it suffocates me.
Knock me down a peg or two theyâll say.
My self worth is shattered.
Please go to him.

This old sea bed will be our new home.
Sinking feeling, weâll fight to save our city.

We will stand together.
