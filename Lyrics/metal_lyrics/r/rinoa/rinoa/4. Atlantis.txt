You left me standing here alone
And with this I felt rediscovered.
Iâll take a quick blast to calm my nerves.

Like a snowflake on your driveway,
I will fall for you,
And with this you will see this through.

You left me standing here alone
And with this I felt reinvented.
You left me standing here alone
And with this I felt rediscovered.

Watch me wade through water.
Iâm not waving, I am drowning.
