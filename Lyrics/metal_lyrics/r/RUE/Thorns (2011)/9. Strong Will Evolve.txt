so many years have passed how many more to go I ain't looking forward
to getting fucking better you can take it with you go fuck off and die
come on and take what you've learned twist it to suit rely on one
expect the worst and on and so on I may be broke but I will not beg
fuck it failure shows you what's true you never will and never had a
chance to guilty of the same mistakes over and over again well what's
the fucking point does it really even matter if there is money you
whore break something I've worked hard everything that I have you make
sick hate on your back now with your hands out to take dread dread
seeps in every pore ever in dread of a world you can not control every
day hated more than the one before and the strong will evolve
perspective I think you'll find you'll see me standing right there
while blackness swallows everything behind me and you don't wanna talk
about it fear fear creeps by the hour living in fear of your life
spiraling out of your control every day loathed just a little bit more
and the strong will the strong will evolve let's roll and we'll talk
about it and we'll find a way to fuck this evolution up
