It's almost time stop screamin' shoutin' freakin' out and drinkin'
smokin' for a while and blow away the haze don't expect to see me back
on that road we're worthless and weak sedate to placate the demons a
walk of lies and blow away the hate don't expect to see my back on
that wall I won't even try to look you in the face no matter what it's
worth within this wall around me as high as I get I can not see over
control unseen a little death in your life a bridge is burning your
soul fades into obscurity your garden's burning but your sure you're
still alive the stomach's turning the way you make your self sick grab
some ground spit it out bleed it 'til there's nothing left to you're a
lie without heart and there's no regeneration no regeneration
