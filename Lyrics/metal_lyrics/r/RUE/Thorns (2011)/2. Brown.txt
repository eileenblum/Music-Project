Brown torn and twisted withered and dying twisted inside thoughts I
thought I knew you once thoughts we all thought that you could change
thoughts that given time you'd grow into a man instead you fucked us
off and dropped out so you let go throw away soul malice doubtful your
intent and I don't even want to understand your motives fuck it it's
not my business you serve yourself that's all there is that I'll ever
need to know right I wonder if you ever know what it means to depend
on yourself to feel that weight on your own two legs tell me how do
you live not at all oh no friend not at all what's with the secrecy
why don't you just be honest haven't we shown enough love to earn that
much respect from you perhaps we only did you the grave disservice of
holding you up all these years should we have let you drown shit we
thought we were being friends your secret's safe with me I'll watch it
all go down but my friend I'll never understand you you really think
the world's against you feel ashamed that you've been passed by do you
really think that running away will bring you to cured for what ails
you I don't
