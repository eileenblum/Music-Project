Pretty shifty and eyes that say to me you wanna take me home not a
second not a second did I stop to contemplate this you know there's
just one feeling I want tonight it's in your mouth and in between your
thighs you know I love how dirty you are when you don't even know me
tongue over lips and hands over hips now we're about blow our minds
riding so high well we can't quite tell who is fucking who you know
that I could never trust you no not enough to ever love you just when
I think I'm about to explode says don't you dare now the pressure's on
oh how you take me on it all feels so right how could we ever go wrong
and I can't see can't see an end to your skin where do I begin not
gonna let this end down slow oh baby you're so sweet down slow oh baby
you're so smooth
