It's dead gunshot drown slipping down tears or blood what does it
matter now could we've ever known wouldn't leave it alone should we
ever seek to manipulate the light moving like you're scraping on
something rise cry out plague did you suffer bled bleed out is this
what you do deceive no one prey no more cold cold cold in blood could
we've ever known wouldn't leave you alone rise cry out plague did you
suffer bled bleed out everything you've used up dead the dying
sleepless sleep forever bleed bleed out this is what you do the rancid
foaming from the tip of your tongue I hope it rots you from the inside
out your tongue I hope it rots you from the inside out torturer in
your ending madness pain of regret dying without human emotion what
good's this fucking feeling unsettled an element of heart disgraced
your face made of glass forever when who you were fell apart wasted
lifetime's endeavor
