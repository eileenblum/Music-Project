In this desert there is nothing in this grave lies my heart bury me
broken and bloody everfailure the torment of the undefeatist give me a
violent death where it leads I've been there days run together an
endless cycle bury me so displeased blow me away burn me down what is
this that drives me is it the absence of validation maybe not this day
or the next a fool's crusade where money and comfort go away and the
only thing you're left with are these songs that you play play no
sympathies please beyond this failure fantastic lusting after death to
fell this crushing me let's me know that I'm alive lusting after death
