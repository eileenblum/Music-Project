This is the death of a dream, intertwined, with the birth of hope.
Hopelessly ensnared, with senses impaired. Polarization. Love and hate
collide. This is every day, not just a pinnacle or pivotal moment.
This forest of thorns is for certain, not without it's roses. Flowers
so radiant, so alive and breathing. Emanating such overwhelming,
overpowering beauty, that the only reaction from the heart or the
head, their only means of communication with these beings beyond
being, is either the laughter of a child or the tears of a deep,
undefined and indescribable loss. Not meant to touch these faces of
God, these Heavens, one never can without agony. That pain of flesh
and of mind. That of thorns in the skin. Pulling in any direction
opposite escape. This misery interwoven with that revelation of bliss.
