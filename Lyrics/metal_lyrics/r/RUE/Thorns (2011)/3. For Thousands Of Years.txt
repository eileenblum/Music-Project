Spit in my face blackness fill my heart hit me again it's time to die
well why are we here to hold this gift this blessed beautiful
desecration of us inside insane in love with death the vile lust for
everything that destroys us seems like we're hurtling towards an end
that seems to have no end it only gets more painful empty and futile
man we're gonna keep going unenlightened arrogant as ever let's keep
on fighting the same old tired war or let's party down get so high and
drunk and numb ourselves to just how fucked up this life is without
respect there's no unity just keep in mind how very little your life
is worth take you soul for a swim in a river of blood don't try it
you'll drown in suicide party down so fucking high so fucking drunk I
don't wanna think this time in a river of blood try not to drown your
sorrows in suicide let's party down get so high and drunk and numb
ourselves to just how fucked up this life is within excess there's no
unity just keep in mind how very little your life is worthâwhy are we
here
