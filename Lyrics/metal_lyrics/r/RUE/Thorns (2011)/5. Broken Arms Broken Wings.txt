My heart hate this halt this hopeless tortured growing old feels so
fucking cold and hard these chores do they really take your life
anywhere conform because your afraid to do as you please on your knees
begging scratching sniffing dying you whore this life can be a bitch
sunder the dream that dragged you under how true is anything you do
can't seem to get over it is this the bottom line on your knees
jerking sucking milking tasting you hole don't you wish you were dead
yet I swear I've heard it said the boring are often bored well I'm
tired too I can't stand this place it's a web everything sticks to
everything else failing light hating life I know I've heard it said
the boring are always bored well I'm tired too fuck it I think we're
in Hell in the place everything runs into everything else failing life
hating the light grinding in your bones these desperate urges to get
stoned just for relief from your own grimly mundane reality help me I
reach out to you I am but your servant hold me in your broken arms my
broken wings won't heal won't fly into the sun or fall in love with
everyone there'll be no release from this solitude and your twisted
world perspective fear and disillusion making a fool out of your self
in the end you've honed a nice stone
