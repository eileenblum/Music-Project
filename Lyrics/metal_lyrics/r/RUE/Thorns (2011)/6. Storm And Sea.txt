A pale blue light rolling in waves the pale blue light that lights
your face electric eels act as the furious fingers of God's sifting
searching for us through the hydrolyte haze the fires of Hell can't
touch us now out here all alone in the middle of the sea up and up and
until you drown what does it mean this isolation life is not sweet
when you're cold and bitter and beat you take a fucking beating up and
out and until you're dead everything so saturated can't keep it dry
can't keep it warm oh how you fucked up your life you sad imploded
ruin of a human you ruin it's too late to reciprocate now face the
fate you made this is the moment you appear to me there's no more
judgement there's no more deceit this is the moment you appear to me
how can we ever get it back now can we get it back I don't know what
you think you're doing friend seeking your road well you got me
thinking now maybe there is no road just the constant sway and shift
of the storm and sea
