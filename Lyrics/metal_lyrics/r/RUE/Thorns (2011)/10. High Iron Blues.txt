This is not who I am it's just who I wanna be distracted in the things
I hate wasting my time I'm so ashamed I can't look you in the fucking
eye like I used to baby I'm not here baby I'm not there you act like I
act like I care if you care livin' the life riding around on a dead
horse let's go were we born to serve hell no livin' a lie so deep up
in this whore you didn't notice she's dead bloated cool and blue for
you there is no message there's nothing new this violent passage
destroying you there is no message no nothing new this time a violent
passage into my peace of mind
