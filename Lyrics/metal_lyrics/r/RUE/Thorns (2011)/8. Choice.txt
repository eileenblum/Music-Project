Is a child taught are they corrupted is he saved or will he be
destroyed pick one ultimately one must make a choice either go all in
or fold run and hide they do not choose but lay their trust in you
look into their eyes they're looking in your eyes put to the test
superficiality will fail deception will take life given the choice to
give up or endure the stress this is the truth the only time in your
life I'll go to Hell I'll take you with me drag you down with me run
you into the ground oh go to Hell take me down with you we'll never be
through is this obsession or is this love
