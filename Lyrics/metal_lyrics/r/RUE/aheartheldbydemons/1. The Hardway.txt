Crawling through falling through
Your self-made world of shit
Every second wonder of yourself
Is this it?
Loser forever failure
Disgusted by yourself
Your path since your birth
Ever spiral downward toward
Nothing save for your death
Awaiting the cold comfort of lifelessness
Just take it away another year by
Distant yet still dragging on me
Tearing away a part of me
Wearing away that part of me sinks to the bottom
Black as coal and silent as a grave
You won't draw breath in this place
In hell you're so convinced that you're dying
Unable to let this go and live
There is no perfect what do you want?
To be like everyone else faceless
Ground down into unmemorable dust
An all too familiar feeling
Betrayed by my body my honesty
Inexperience
Onward I trudge through this heartache
I'm still learning the hard way.
