Open the gates
It is time
I push back
The lies obstructive and holding me back
No longer will I lay down
My mind my body new rare form
Roiling circles of my poisoned blood
Roil
Everything against everything else
Pure and refined
My wake breaks up the surface
I've gathered all my tools and materials
To raise this monument of disdain
Burn in rings of dark dried blood
A world's upper echelon
Burn
Wide eyed open the gates
Even through I'm weary I'm not standing
On my last trembling legs
I'm a man and like a man
I walk on.
