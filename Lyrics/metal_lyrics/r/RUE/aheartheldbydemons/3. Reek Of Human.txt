I see a fire in the tower
And irony does ascend
Constrictive sensation
The reek of human
Blood is resolved
The end is so only
It does not discriminate
Justified the weak for the fallen
Who has won?
He will not be seen
Speed them along to feed the earth
Burn their cities not the trees
By the millions heaped into human landfills
And my how a wasted history does reek
Rising up to the heavens
Like lost souls discorporated
Your pavement can not stop me
I am the throw away
And you reek of a sad effort
Destined to fall short from the start
And it never ends so fuck it all
Separation rejection holding me down let me die
Leave me down to my bleeding black spleen
In my heart all that I will ever need.
