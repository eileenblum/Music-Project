Through the course of this road
Working to separate us
Numb that way we grow
Older and colder
No more of the past
I can't see it
I can't fucking feel it
So much empty space
In front of me now
I will never know
The depths to which I'll never go
Seems like I can't even satisfy myself
A lifestyle destined to end up incomplete
In a way or many ways
Bigger better brighter than white light
Who really cares?
And who will survive?
Why do we try?
Am I thinking wrong?
These living hands we adorn with precious sentiment
Only before we knew if they start dying
Not long enough is the rest before the sleep
In this world you might as well concede to cancer.
