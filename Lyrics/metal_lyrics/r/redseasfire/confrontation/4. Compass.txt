The moral compass set to south
Down down where you're heading
There is no light to see underground
No light to see what is missing
One day you'll see the surface
To create a life worth living

Now I see you for what you are (we've left alone)
And It's a mess you've made
How the promises faded away

The story goes that I have lost
The only way of stopping you

Stop talking down to me
You may think that it shows superiority
But all I see are the cracks in your composure
Revealing insecurities

This is bred through your inferiority
And the lack of who take you seriously
A desperate cry to be heard
A foolish cry to be accepted by
Those who never care nor quiver at your words.

I'm done with taking orders
It's time to live life as I please
If all the mistakes I've made
Have made me the man I am today
How can I feel regret
This is the end that I've made
The suffering you've caused
Will never cease to end

Streaming with colours
Pierced by the eyes
That scream out your name
And they pray its not the end

Streaming with colours
Pierced by the eyes
That scream out your name
And they pray its not the end

We can't, we'd suffer again
To find the words unspoken
I can see what I've become

We can't, we'd suffer again
To find the words unspoken
I can see what I've become

The end is closer in this life
Than I care to dream, but its not over yet.
