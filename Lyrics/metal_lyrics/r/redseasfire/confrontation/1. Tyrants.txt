We're in an age of change
The tunnel's light is near
And all you think about
Is vacuous selfish fear

Time to react
Now that their backs are turned
The truth is in and its getting worse
If you don't stop them who will?

Time to react
It's reaching critical mass
So get behind me or stay in chains
Ones you've defended in vein

The future's not a promise
With a key to hide away
Let's break open the constraints
and see if you're the same

After all that we have done to take away
The price of fame that you have taken day after day
After all that we have done I'm saved
The price that we have come to understand your pain

You've let them ascend the throne
Horrors in the name of gain
Your the one who said its done
And it's killing off the rest

I can't escape this prison
But the brittle bars now ache
I know
That you're beginning to fade
I know
There's no chance to be saved

Will this ever leave me
Or will I carry this for
All the time that I have left
At least till I forget
