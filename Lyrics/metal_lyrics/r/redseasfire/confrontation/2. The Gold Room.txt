The Palace of Dreams
Behind locked doors is the key
Unless you have the opulence
You'll beg on your knees

Why has it been left to feed
The words have simply left me
Why has it been left to seed
A world in which we cannot live in

I think you have yourself confused
By the do's and the don't's of the self accused
Dictate our direction with no voice of truth
History tells the tale that you're all the same

Now it's fallen to the hands glittering gold
That's all they know and you've left them wondering why aren't yours?
Their false assumptions as to why, will hurt us all
Lets hope the saying doesn't ring true

The Palace of Dreams
Behind locked doors is the key
Unless you have the opulence
You'll beg on your knees

Baited and bitten the wounded stay down
Our faces in dirt and our ears to the ground
No sympathy for the self-inflicted sickness
I'm so fucking tired of the way that they treat you
So get on your feet and get ready to shout
That enough is enough and it leaves me no doubt
How we conduct our behaviour changes now
It's a fear that gags you, sweat it out

Lay down the youth of the castor and now I am free
The sum of the curse that will pass down will itself rise in me
Hold to the callow constraints I have to connect
Run and step on the king of the sinking
Where your fate has been kept in your rage

(And it's broken, like the others)

Like no other you've scratched at the surface
have you come to understand it all?

And it's broken at seems we've created
I can't hold myself accountable for your mistakes again
When this is buried in the ground
Covered and stifled I'll sleep
Without a second thought but it's not now

It's time to wake up
It's time to wake up
It's time to wake up
Wake up
