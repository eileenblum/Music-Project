Time that we've bought
To try and get close
To the top of where we can go
But now you look down
You've figured out the climbs not worth the fall

Do what you're told
In hope that it all pays off
It's times like these that I can't look back

Why wait?
It's the medicine you choose
Why wait?
And it will be the last of you

I won't say the struggle within
Isn't worth the claim
The right to say that it defines you

Your affluence has become the ignorance that has caused
More than any personal struggle could absolve
The suffering of those left in your care
Apathetic to the needs of the souls you see as diseased
Strip back the skin and see who's within
It's you, the same, it's me, the same

Knock, knock
Now fate awaits
Its time to make the grand escape
Strap on your sensory prowess
And lead us the key

You've always been the lucrative type
But at the cost of how many lives
Have I pushed away from your magnetic eyes
Those who are prone to the insidious lie

A doctor of spin, you've kept them within
Their cage of ensued perspective,
Pull harder at the strings until they tangle
The message is lost and you slip by unseen
For the last time oppressor
Now address the few who still stand up to them
Begging for help

If they're still haunting me then they must...

Hold it inside and see what you find
Do you see us breaking free tonight
Now it doesn't seem fair to you
Hold it inside until you resign
The clutches with which you cling to life
In spite of the stare that shows no remorse

I can see all the things
That you've buried in the dark
And all of the faces that you've left behind
And If their still haunting me
They must be nightmares for you
