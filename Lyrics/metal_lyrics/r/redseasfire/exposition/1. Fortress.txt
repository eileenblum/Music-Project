Break your act for a moment.
Here in the cold the outside seems so far from home, late door shuts the night time in.
Clock hands applaud the night owls stare broken and oblivious to me.

We're tired trying to sleep without this distance.

The ice breaks the silence you've made from pain,
And only now do I see clear the excuse you've made to breathe.

Life is not a race.
The expression on your face says it all, you'll be bitter till the end.
You'll stop before the fracture, look the other way this hour.
I can only hope.

These words that you never said, goodbye my friend.

To me you're so sheltered and it makes you judgemental.
How can you form your frivolous opinion, when you don't know the answers.
Cos' I'm not fucking happy with where I am, not gonna stand here and watch this chance escape me.
Beside the hole that you dug for your grave.

Time won't heal you.
You think its unjust.
You think its your turn.

Time won't heal you.
This time will be yours, made to hold back like your clutch.

I have tried before this gets out of hand, before this gets out of hand.

Your selfishness takes a turn for the worst.
If you want these dreams of sadness just hold your fucking breath.

The ice breaks the silence you've made from pain,
And only now do I see clear the excuse you've made to breathe.
The ice breaks the silence you've made from pain,
And only now do I see clear the excuse you've made to breathe.
