I know this now, time of death is ten past eight
The lights are gone and thank god the moneys safe
There's nothing physical in this grave
And now you've fucked it

As fortune plays its tireless game
The rich dictate for now who stays awake
'Til the end, 'til the end
And am I being selfish?
This isn't how it should be
Not one eye shut for those the blessed
Watch as the fickle fade away

Have some endurance for your self-abuse
Last it out put the suffering to use
Through your own experiences build up the rest
Don't waste it away, don't let it regress
And now a penitent face stares through the glass
The weight bares down upon the decisions you've made
Again and again, further away from the life you pictured today

As fortune plays its tireless game
The rich dictate for now who stays awake
'Til the end, 'til the end
And am I being selfish?
This isn't how it should be
Not one eye shut for those the blessed
Watch as the thoughtless tear us apart

It's not enough to say what you say without action
Stand and fight you'll soon realize there's a reason they failed

This is the calling, next time no warnings
As the shadow looms over, these old structures are caving in

All this reality is stuck without a sense of movement
On axis we're caught drifting through the gaps

Lately I've found that everyone feels that they know who they are
And lately I've found that everyone hurts when they find out the truth
What if your opinion isn't right?
What if your words don't apply?

It's all we've come to know
Back up against the wall, we are not blind now
You're not striving for perfection,
You're begging for acceptance
There's no escape, there's no escape
They've been given new eyes to see through you
Time moves on, these lies live on...
...without you
