Do you feel so hollow like there's nothing left inside
No hope no promise for the fading world outside
I see the life inside you that you'd bare to retract
This fog is lifting over our aphotic sky

I will find the solitary life to lead me home
You should try to find your own way

(Oh Oh)
To find my way back home

I will find the solitary life to lead me home
You should try to find your own way

Tear down the web and start again [2x]

Wait if you feel like there is no escape
Wait there until the old way conveys a glimpse of return
When will they progress and stop the obsession
Fueling this regression, far from the free mind we've sown

Under it all, you're the same as us
We are the invention, you can't overcome
Can you see now they've covered your eyes
Light rushes in and now you will know the obvious

I will find the solitary life to lead me home
In removing you from myself I will find what I used to know
I will find the solitary life to lead me home
You should try to find your own way
