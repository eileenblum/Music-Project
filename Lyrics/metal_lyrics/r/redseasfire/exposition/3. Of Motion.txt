Sounds that swell over tired plains
The words you've learned here to brave
Come crashing down
No one is to save the dying age you attempt to trade
Through all the disdain I've seen the mistakes
The first was saying that it was never too late
And I was wrong to take the blame

Fain for us before they get their way
Too late for the things we want to change
Time will say how you forgot your way
That made you try so hard to find another way
Another way
Before promise is led astray

Now they're gone I can redeem for the lows had
But can't see you see, you'll wait there forever
As the old me is dead
