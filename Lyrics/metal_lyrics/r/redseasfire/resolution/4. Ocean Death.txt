Travelled heart beating host
Awkward tendencies, a measured dose
Is this how days have come to end
Vanished from thin air
Like the decisions for what has been
I wonder if I'm still dreaming, with eyes open wide
The porcelain road ahead, my metaphor of deceit
Cracked and crumbling, mistakes need not repeat

In time you'll fade away, inside yourself betray
In time a clean start will divide the hope you feel
Do you have the will to change
A mind that's shattering like glass
Under the weight, crippling from decay
Will I see another day
Where better things prevail
Or have to wait until I close my eyes
The final curtain fall
Like darkness to our eyes
Who could not portray exalted existence
Betrayed
