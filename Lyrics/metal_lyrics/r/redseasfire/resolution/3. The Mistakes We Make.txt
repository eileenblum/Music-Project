Can you keep it low key, tell me what you're breathing in
Is it jealousy, is it the tendency not to pay any attention
Not to speak on the frequency
Our lives are good, but yours is dependency
On the downward spiral, so listen close to me
Before they come and get you the time is right
You're stuck, you're caught in the headlights
Peoples choices are their own to make
Their curse if they choose to make the mistake
So have some fucking self restraint and drop your plea for empathy
Drop your plea for empathy
Another night, another risk,
Education with a fist
You're such a tear away without the brakes
So fill me in on what I've missed
Move on move out
Can't you see I'm helpless
Give up cave in
Your so fucking hopeless
You've got the potential but you lack the sight
Not something you gain from doing wrong right
Stop what have you done within
The beating cracks the bones
The fatal blow is received
A poignant scene
Wait the matterâs still at hand
But sheâs already wasting away
Move on move out canât you see
Another day, the same headache
Bright lights filter, the callings of
Another day, a chance to wait for the clock face failings to catch up with me

Another day, the same headache
Bright lights filter the callings of
Cause I've been lost a long time
Don't take my words as truth
Their said without a thought or care for you
Pray you believe that I'm here
But all you'll find are empty rooms of where I've been

Look me in the eyes and tell me I'm wrong
The feelings too good, to know that your gone
What a waste its been
We've lost in both the eyes that stare
A life, a voice, my friend
I want to hear the words again but only to know that theyâre wrong
I know you see me like I see you and soon it will all change again
A different hand, another lie

Peoples choices are their own to make
Their curse if they choose to make the mistake
So have some fucking self restraint and drop your plea for empathy
Peoples choices are their own to make
Their curse if they choose to make the mistake
So have some fucking self restraint and drop your plea for empathy
Now you're entering the stage of self indulgent self repair
You'll get what you want and you don't fucking care who gets in your way
You'll push them aside because you haven't learnt from your mistakes
Again and again you'll repeat, dragging down another friend.
