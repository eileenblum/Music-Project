I can't wait for separation
A land fill of flesh that amounts to the height
At which to see the damage you've done
This is your candidate
It's time to formulate
A role inflicting change
Stand up with grounding weight
My eyes dilate at your mistakes
Self inflicted fortune, narcissistic reprobate
You need communication or you'll separate
Focus from which we can relate everyday
Strip away the silence, bury the divide between us
I always want what I can't have now I'm left here to decide
If I can't ever make a choice without living with deceit
Now who's to say my decisions made canât, canât live with this defeat
Canât live with this defeat [2x]
Oh OK now I understand
So your enigmatic construct means there's no blood on your hands
You've made oh so clear there' s no compassion in your sight
An avaricious mind can't sympathize with it's ghost
Lifeless order for the young untraced
The aching outrage now affecting change

Strip away the silence and bury the divide
I always want what I can't have without with deceit
Whoâs to say once my decisions are ingrained
I wonât care to listen
