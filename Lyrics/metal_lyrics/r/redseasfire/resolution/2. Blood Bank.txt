Dread comes in waves for those who wait
Without an answer, without a lifeline
A broken mistake, a reason to fail
Tormented for living

I can't escape this feeling
That we're buried underneath
The expectations we've reduced
And that crumbled at our feet
It's not enough to escape the hole
That you are fit in too, there's only room for one
In the house of the egocentric

Covert horns hide the devil inside, masquerade as the innocent
Deceiver that you are
It's all a mess now and you've only got yourself to blame
Escape path from this progress the freedom you claim
I can't understand you
Your words are insane [2x]
Your words are making you insane

Procure for war, we've lost the cure
To fix our system's leak

So hold me down, your veiled disguise
Now I can't breath out your words round my throat

So hold me down, your veiled disguise
The mask has been dropped, the face is my own

So hold me down, your veiled disguise
Now I can't breath out your words round my throat

'Cause this is not how you live free
When every waking moment's spent dreaming
It's OK for you to be alone
If it gives you opportunity to make this life your own
Coordination of everyday life, you're fighting to stay afloat
You have a choice now, I know you have what it takes to see it through
Another fork in the road to set your sights
Only you know best now make your choice

So hold me down, your veiled disguise
Now I can't breath out your words round my throat

So hold me down, your veiled disguise
The mask has been dropped, the face is my own

Watching over me
In solitude you'll see
That I have found a way
To find strength from within
