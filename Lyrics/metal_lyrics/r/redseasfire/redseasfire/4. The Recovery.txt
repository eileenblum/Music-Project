Skin and steel,
Freely I return,
To soft breath, 
A life of half-death.

Stranded, I fade in two directions,
Salvation slips away,
The choice of my ascension isn't mine to make.
The scene of my surrender,
The pieces,
As I lie sleeping,
I see fractured shards.

Freely I return to this,
To recover the broken part of me,
The broken part of me.

I can't feel,
I can't see.
I can't feel,
I can't see.

Pulled back to this,
unwilling to recover.

Freely I return to this, 
To recover the broken part of me,
The broken part of me.

My world disintegrating,
Past life consuming me,
Asphalt taste,
Shatterproof embrace,
Air fills my lungs,
Eyelids wide pupils dilate,
As my senses scream.
