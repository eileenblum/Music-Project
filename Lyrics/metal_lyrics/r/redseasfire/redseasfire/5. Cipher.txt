This is the harmless truth you've concealed,
No expense spared,
Your defiance assured through
God-given right.

How can you carry on?
How blind must you be,
Not to see ancient history.

This is the timeless lie you propagated,
No care for the hate you've created.

This is the harmless truth you've concealed,
No expense spared,
Your defiance assured through
God-given right.

How can you carry on?
How blind must you be,
Not to see ancient history repeat.

Will it be your last?
To save your conflicting words
Conflicting words.

You're the disease

This is the timeless lie you propagated,
No care for the hate you've created.
This is the shroud you've cast on all of us,
You're so faithless.
