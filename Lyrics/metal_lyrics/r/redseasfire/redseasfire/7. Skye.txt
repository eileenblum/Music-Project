Wreck of sense
Believes the world inside heals 
Relax, I'm cold 
But you'll swear the same 
Tear out the doctrine
Rip clean the facts we breathe 
Chew the lines till there's 
No crowd for the scheme.

It's all a caustic urge 
We'll break before you show 
Your nature fails our empire

Form the species 
Perception without consciousness
Yet your willing decides nothing 
The authors of our acts 
The few so numerous 
A reflex unthinking response 
No memory remains 

We'll fake it 
The human style, it's all an animal risk 
Remove our oxygen 
We'll hate it

It's all a caustic urge 
We'll break before you show 
Your nature fails our empire

Tonight you'll believe
You'll pulse on repeat
We step through the cord
Our poise smoothes the dive

Another constellation 
Tonight believe 
You'll pulse on repeat

Now you're chrome 
Just spill through 
Float, limbs aside
Frame-bound embrace

Flagship of your design 
We'll stay the night 
Flagship of your design 
These hopeless hearts desire
Flagship 
We'll stay, we'll stay the night.
