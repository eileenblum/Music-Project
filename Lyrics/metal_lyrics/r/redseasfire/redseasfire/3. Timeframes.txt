Tides within the structure,
serve to distract,
The consciousness unravels,
Turn out the light,
Before you see,
Sit in this darkness

Shadow forms slip by,
The other worldly ways now fail you,
The nerves erase the details,
Meanings submerged

So carve your bones to fit the mould,
Twist your necks and face the screen,
So lay on your fractured wrists,
You'll make martyrs yet,
You'll make martyrs yet.

Tides within the structure,
Serve to distract,
The consciousness unravels.

It isn't worth the time, 
Vacant, idle
Let the world pass by.

This is not your world,
species born redundant,
this absence of thought.

Carve your bones.
