Hold me, suspended in air,
Free in thought.
Hold me back,
Suspense is the chore.

To see the end,
To feel a beginning,
To understand all origins.

Who would want reality?
No matter the answer, your thoughts remain unchanged.

To have seen the beginning,
And to feel the end, 
while falling gives it all away,
gives it all away.

Hold me, suspended in air,
free in thought, hold me back.
