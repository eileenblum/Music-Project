Presupposed,
We find distorted meanings 
The past warped to fit
The present's leaning

Beyond the word
The spaces we fear 
(Insularity)
Will force us all (us all) 
To Hate

What of integrity? 
Hands filled without a question
And what of intelligence? 
They're running dry but you'll keep drinking

Deception might be all
We cling to
With no free thought 
We must conform 
Serving another mind.

I am here as a passenger.
pushed on by the wills of another.
to forget wishes of my own desire,
to lose the dreams of my own design

When you lie awake at dawn 
The terrors and nightmares 
Your anguish
Brings you to your knees

Presupposed 
Distorted meanings 
The past warped to fit 
The present's leaning 
Beyond the work 
The spaces we fear 
Insularity will force us all to hate

Will force us all to hate
