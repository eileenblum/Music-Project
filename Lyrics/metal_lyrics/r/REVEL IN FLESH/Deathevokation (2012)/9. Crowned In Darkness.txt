Crowned in darkness
Crowned in death 

Devastation - no salvation
Final damnation
Immolation - no salvation
The fall from grace
Crowned in darkness
No grace - no hope - no Cure

Death reach the sky... when night is the new day
Statues turned to dust
Rise of theshadowworld
Night is eternal... when death is infernal

The morning never came when ashes forever rain
The remaining souls have gone insane with regrets
and with pain

Fire falls down from the sky
Oceans swallow the land
Continents rip themselves apart
Revelation - cremation

As we burn under the crown of darkness

Expect no deliverance 
No flesh will be spared
In the ceremony
Under the crown of darkness
Expect no deliverance
No Flesh will be spared
As we die 
Crowned in darkness

Prophecies of chaos visions of death 
Night is eternal... when death is infernal

In days of mourning
No saviour - no saints
Embrace the end of life 
Excruciated - executed
Cataclsymic apocalypse
Eternal solstice - a world of chaos
Entangled in death's domain
Revelation - devastation
