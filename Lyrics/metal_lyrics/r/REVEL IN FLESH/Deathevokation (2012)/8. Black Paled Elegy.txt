From north to south 
From east to west
Embraced by the blackest death
From clergy to gentry 
From burgess to peasants
Captured in the claws of death

Bloodred - hatred
Black paled elegy

Leading the rats onwards
Bringer of death inwards

Breath of miasma
Inhale the dead
Raped incubation
Raise the black flag
Deadly infection 
Bow to the end
Yersinia pestis
Pandemic reign

Conception of dissolution
Harvester of pain
Seed of damnation
Heaven sent plague
Like thieves in the night
In dead's silence
Mask of the red death
Destiny unveiled
