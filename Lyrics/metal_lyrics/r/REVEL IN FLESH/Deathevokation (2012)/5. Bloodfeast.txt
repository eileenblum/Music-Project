Welcome to my empire of misery!

Annihilation - trumpets declared
Holy death campaign
Cursed forevermore

Morbid (years of) desecration
Traces of death mark the land
Twisted dynasties expanded 
Under a crown of blood

Bloodfeast - thrilled to kill
Bloodfeast - fire at will
Bloodfeast - precision fire
Bloodfeast - funeral pyre

Of confessional insanity
With God's blessings sent into the fire down below
Maledictions - terror of soul collectors
Exploitations - mercenaries drown the soil with blood

30 years of infestation
30 years of tribulation
30 years of livin' hell

Lynch domination - hengmen reign the market squares
Lay down crippled and broken
Flagellation - fear the tyrant's wrath
Putrefcation - inhale the stench of rotten death

Bloodfeast - livin' hell - bloodfeast
