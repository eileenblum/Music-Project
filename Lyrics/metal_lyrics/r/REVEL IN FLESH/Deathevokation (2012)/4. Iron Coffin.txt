Cenotaphs mark their way

Grey wolves of the sea - to kill is their destiny
Iron in will - resisting hell to kill!!!

Leaving the homefleet with vengeance in mind
Armed with a deadly freight 
To cut the enemy's lifeline
Into a storm ridden endless abyss
A lonesome killing machine on the call of duty

Iron coffin - a silent fall
Iron coffin - embraced by the endless ocean
Iron coffin - compressed demise
Iron coffin - into the depths of no return

Wolfpack unleashed - silent hunters of the sea
Wolfpack unleashed - howling from the depths

Drowned in the dark - left in eternal misery
Lost in the dark - cenotaphs mark their way

Withstand the rough sea with tension and pride
Finally a trail of smoke across the horizon
A convoy driven into the ocean knife
Just a taste of blood and the wolflust is unleashed

The call to the battlestation in the iron coffin
Commando periscope depth of the iron coffin
Taking aim on the transporter with the iron coffin
Launching first torpedo - all hell breaks loose!!!
Iron Coffin - detonations shake the sea
Iron Coffin - the sound of bursting steel 
Slowly the wolf surfaces into the flaming inferno 
Into the depths of no return with the iron coffin!!!

A hell of smoke and deadly explosions 
Scattered castaways drowned in burning oil
Corroded lungs - severed bodyparts
Sailors' apocalypse - the wolve's work is done!!!

Grey wolves of the sea - depth was their destiny 
They were iron in will but driven into the open knife!!!

Discovered by sonar - forced into the defensive
Feel the compression in the iron coffin
Each meter brings them deeper into their shallow grave
Waterbombs explosions shock the iron coffin
Waterdamage &amp; sinking deeper with the iron coffin
Running out of battery - trapped in the iron coffin!!!
Into the depths of no return - death in the iron coffin!!!
