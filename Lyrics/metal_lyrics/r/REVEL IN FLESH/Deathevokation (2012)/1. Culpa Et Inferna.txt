Hell eternally sworn 
Blood red throne 
Hell eternally sworn
Seas of blood

Pogrom in fire - flames rise higher 
Ashes to ashes... and dust to dust!!!

Nostri culpa - Nostri inferna

Through the gates
Rotten death
Beyond the grave
Rotten death
In disgrace

Hell eternally sworn... in hellfire
Blood red throne
Hell eternally sworn... dark desire
Streams of blood 

Trapped in the crypt - many faces of death
Worm infestation... in the stench of damnation

Hell eternally sworn... burn the cross
Blood red throne
Hell eternally sworn... left to rot

Sinners will burn in the scourge of fire
Seven seals are broken - rest in festering slime
In death's embrace - rot!!!
