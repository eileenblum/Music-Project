The empire crumbles under bombing terror 
Hear (the) desperate cries!!!
A steel inferno with massive casualities - our final hour!!!

The last elite - sworn to death
In (the) Samurai's cult
Pile squadrons - thrilled to kill for eternal glory
Counter attack - sacrificial operation
For honour &amp; pride - they're marching to die!!!

Murder - death - kill!!!
On divine winds
Glorious suicide - holy way to die!!!
Spread the wings of death
Rot for honour - rot for pride!!!
On divine winds
Glorious suicide - holy way to die!!!
Spread the wings of death

Disintegration - under siege
Fear the motherland's ruin
Against the armada with olden war machines
A flight of no return!!!

Dawn of battle - mission's briefing - a last goodbye
Kamikaze
Saki of death - hail the Emperor (and) rise to the sky
Kamikaze
Counter attack - sacrificial operation
For honour &amp; pride - take off to die!!!

Murder - death - kill

Surviving dogfight - fleet in sight - dive attack
Kamikaze
Flak inferno - crushing death with open eyes
Kamikaze
Burning vessels (and) deadly explosions
Horror high!!!
Fading life - forever remembered in shrines of souls!!!
Purified in flames as a human guided bomb
Indoctrinated death - victims of a lost cause!!!

Murder - death - kill
