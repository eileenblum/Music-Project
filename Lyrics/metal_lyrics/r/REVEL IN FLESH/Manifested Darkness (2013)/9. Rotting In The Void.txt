Rotting in the Void.
Dwelling in A Wasteland.
Within my Castle of Despair.

Where only Emptiness prevails.
Emptiness prevails.

Where nothing remains the same.

Loosing yourself.
Trapped in A Labyrinth of Dread.

Labyrinth of Dread.

Your mental World gets torn apart.
Only Shreds of Sanity remain.

Remain.

When Sorrow turns to Hate.
Out of Hand evoke the living End.

Evoke the living End.

Scars ripped in the Flesh.
Rotting in the Void.
Scars ripped in the Heart.
Rotting in the Void.
Allday living Hell.
Rotting in the Void.

Rotting in the Void.

Allday living Hell.
A dying Wish.
A living Nightmare.

A living Nightmare.
A living Nightmare.

As Time stands still.
Helpless Voices freezing deep.
Forever in Gloom.
With hopeless Eyes you stare into the Abyss.
Where Only Shreds of Sanity remain.

Shreds of Sanity remain.

When Sorrow turns to Hate.
Out of Hand evoke the living End.

Evoke the living End.

Scars ripped in the Flesh.
Rotting in the Void.
Scars ripped in the Heart.
Rotting in the Void.
Allday living Hell.
Rotting in the Void.

Rotting in the Void.

At the Edge of Madness
You're close to pull the Trigger.
Sinking deeper into Nothingness.
Drifting away into A No Man's Land.
Deep within yourself.

Deep within yourself.

Where only Emptiness prevails.
Where nothing remains the same.
Nothing.
Silent endless Nothing.

Nothing.
Nothing.
