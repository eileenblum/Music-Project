Burning forever.
Burning in everlasting Fire.
For Eternity.

For Eternity.

An Augury of Fire carved within the Epitaph.
Crossed Bones Obscurities.
Your last Journey begins.
An empty Hourglass remain.
Symbols of Death.
Your eternal Fall.

Cauterized... You'll suffer.
Cauterized and purified by Flames.

Torment in Fire.
In Torment 'till Death do us apart.

Torment in Fire.
In Torment 'till Death do us apart.

The Stench of incinerated Flesh prevails.
Ashes rain over A decaying World.
Buried in A Blistering Urn... Urn!
Night conquers the Day.
Only the living Dead remains.

Crawling... Slowly.
Crawling... At the furnace Funeral.
Slow... Cremation.
Slow... Furnace Funeral.

You'll suffer.
Purified by Flames.

Torment in Fire.
In Torment 'till Death do us apart.

Pillars of Mankind get shattered... Shattered.
Monuments of Faith will return to Dust.
Confess to Chaos, confess to Filth.
When Daylight fades, Fire will be your only Cure.
For Eternity.

Burning forever.
Burning in everlasting Fire.
For Eternity.

Crawling... Slowly.
Crawling... At the furnace Funeral.
Slow... Cremation.
Slow... Furnace Funeral.

Torment in Fire.
In Torment 'till Death do us apart.

Torment in Fire.
In Torment 'till Death do us apart.

Cauterized... You'll suffer.
Cauterized and purified by Flames.

Torment 'till Death do us apart.
