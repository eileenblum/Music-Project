A endless Column march.
In the Grip of Winter... of Winter.
Into the Unknown.

Into the Unknown.

A Paradise fading with no Glory.
Shattered in Anxiety and Shame.
Only A Wasteland remain.
Of what once was your Home.

Under the Whip of Revenge.
Under the Whip.
Under the Whip of Retribution.
Under the Whip.

Expulsed.
Into the Unknown.
Expulsed in Misery.
Expulsed.
In an Exile of Calamity.

Day after Day the howling of heavy Artillery.
Gets closer and closer.

Under A bloodred Sky.
You beg for Mercy.

Deathmarch on Blood frozen Soil.
Deep in the claws of Winter.
Crystal cold Death curdle the Blood.
You trample on scorched Earth.

Under the Whip of Revenge.
Under the Whip.
Under the Whip of Retribution.
Under the Whip.

A Victim of Disposal in your fallen World.
Howling on your Knees while begging for Relief.

Expulsed.
Into the Unknown.
Expulsed in Misery.
Expulsed.
In an Exile of Calamity.

Day after Day the Horror prevails.
One Step closer to the Edge.
Your World get blackened in Ash.
A Funeral Procession of your Existence... Of your Existence.

At the Gates to Hell you beg for Mercy.
Expulsed in an Exile of Calamity.

Expulsed in an Exile of Calamity.
