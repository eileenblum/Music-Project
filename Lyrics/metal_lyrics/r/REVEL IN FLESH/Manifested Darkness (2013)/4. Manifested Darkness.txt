In Darkness.
You've sworn the Oath of Duty.
Bound for Lifetime.
Sworn to the Realm of the Night.

Manifested Darkness.
Allegiance until the End of Days.

Manifested Darkness.
Sworn to the Realm of the Night.
For all Nights to come.

Darkness Clouds.
As Mankinds last Stronghold.
Starts to crumble.
Beyond the Walls.
The Sun hides for Years.
For Years.

I am the Wathcer of the Walls in A Land forlorn.
I am the Shield that guards the Realm of Night.
I shall wear no Crowns.
I shall win no Glory.
At my Post I shall live and die.
I am the Sword in Darkness.

Manifested Darkness.
In Manifested Darkness.

Advance with no Fear.
Towards the Enemy Lines.
Ride in Force.
Kill or be killed.

Manifested Darkness.
Allegiance until the End of Days.

Manifested Darkness.
Sworn to the Realm of the Night.
Until my last Breath.

Sworn to the Realm of the Night.
Sworn to eternal Night.

Manifested Darkness.
Manifested Darkness.
