[performed by Revel in Flesh]Summoning at the alter of the gods
Out of the tomb into the portal of doom
Slowly they're grinding the corpses
Slowly they're mangling the rotten flesh
Seed of horror - Boiling blood
Welcome in the chapel of despair
Seedless horror - Endless pain
Entangled in deaths domain
Servants from darkness march from their tomb
Disturbing the dead for the mass in the chapel of bones

Bonecrusher
Separate the flesh from the skull
In the bonecrusher
Pulverize the mortal remains

Holy symbols baptized with the stench of death
Relicts of faith desecrated under the flag of terror
Morbid ossuary - Symbol of mortality 
Blood runs from the stone
Destiny in infinity
Slowly they're carving the nave of bone
Cement of mortality - Meat and bone meal
Headstone for the monolith of the death
Dome of horror - Monument of fear
Under a roof made of human skin
Servants of darkness construct the chapel of bones
Decorated in death with the enemy's putrid remains
Once buried in holy soil - Now excavated
Traces of war on the exhumed skull
The raven gather around the left overs
Morbid ossuary - Symbol of mortality
Monolith of death...blood runs from the stone
Chapel of bones relict of eternity...immortality
marching from their tomb servants of darkness - Arise!!!
Disturbing the dead for the mass in the chapel of bones
Marching from their tomb servants of darkness - Arise!!!
Decorated in death with the enemy's putrid remains
Decorated in Death
