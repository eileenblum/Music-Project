Open the gates to the spheres of death
Restless acherontic horror
A reign of smoldering ash
A chaos enshrined dwelling
Nightmare of the putrefying flesh
Funeral orgies of the rotten dead
Stiff cold rotten creatures rise
Arise fullfill my curse

Casket realms
Creeping in the abyssmal gloom
In my casket realms
Splendour of the flesh devouring darkness

Casket ride
At the dead of night unite
On my casket ride
Behold the mist ascending deadlight

Crawl, creep and rot
... at the dead of night
March, rip and slay
... back from dead again

Funeral presence unholy
Angst ridden gloom
The deathkult communion ascending
Excruciated doom
Dragged into the obscure
Stiff and cold
Dragged into the obscure
Your flesh slowly ripped apart

I roam beyond mortality
In malevolence I prevail
Cold nightshade hordes rise
Arise fulfil my curse

Unite at the dead of night
On my casket ride
