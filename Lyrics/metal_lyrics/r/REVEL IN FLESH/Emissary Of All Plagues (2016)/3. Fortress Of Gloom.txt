The curse is fulfilled
Abominable misery speaks to me
Hideous emptiness
On my path of withering

I wander
I seek
I hide
In the dark

Tangled in mist of chaos
I feel the presence of the dead

In my fortress of gloom
I hide
In my fortress of gloom
I observe the eternal black
Eternal black

Starless
Endless
Nothingness
I'm swallowed by the void

Breathless
Lifeless
Starless
I fade to black

Tangled in mist of chaos
I feel the presence of the dead

I wander
I hide
I seek
I fade to black

The vengeance of eternal frost
Chunks of bursting glass slithering
I'm consumed by fear
I bow to the cryptic nothingness

I hide
I seek
I wander
I observe the eternal black

In my fortress of gloom
My fortress of gloom
Of gloom
