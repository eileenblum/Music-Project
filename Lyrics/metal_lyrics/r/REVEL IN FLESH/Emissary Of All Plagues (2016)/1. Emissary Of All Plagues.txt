Kult of death
Of death
Graveless horror
Restless flesh
Emissary of all plagues
Emissary transcending horror

Kult of death
Graveless 
Kult of death
Restless rotten flesh 

A conjuration
In triumph we arise
We cloak the earth
With a thousand nights

Bone crushing
Death marching
Revel with the dead
The emissary of horror
Plagues of the rotten dead

Emissary of all plagues
Emissary of all plagues
The transcending horror

We raise the chalice
Filled with shreds of life
In obedience onto death
In obedience loyal to the kult of death

In the name of the flesh
We strife
Kult of death
In chants of misery
Kult of death
In black dripping cruelty

Emissary of all plagues
Emissary of all plagues
The transcending horror

In sermons of necromantical chaos
We're roaring
The chants of the rotten
Crypt crawling
Blood feasting
Revel with the dead

The emissary of horror
Plagues of the rotten dead
Rotten dead

Kult of death
Never to fall aside
Kult of death
Forever to stride

Graveless
Restless
We hail the kult of death
