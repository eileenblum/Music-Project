World of terror, world of pain.
Breeding horror, dead insane.

Baptized in carnage, crawling in blood.
Killing field's horror, as flesh turns to dust.

Unbolt the hurt locker.
Unbolt the hurt locker.

Claymore detonations, shrapnels fill the air.
Bodies ripped apart. 
Chunks of flesh as life ceased to be.
A shell shock misery.

Hurt locker.
Alright!

Outburst of horror, a blood-red shroud.
Feel the reaper's hand.
Face the final end.
What once was, never again shall be.

Baptized in carnage, crawling in blood.
Killing field's horror, as flesh turns to dust.
Unbolt the hurt locker.
Inside the breeding hurt locker.

Hurt locker.

Hurt locker, my palace of pain.
Hurt locker, dead insane.
Hurt locker, my palace of pain.
Hurt locker, dead insane.

Dead... dead insane.
Breeding horror, dead insane.

World of terror.
Breeding horror.
Dead insane.

World of pain.
Breeding horror.
Dead insane.

Traumatic violation, blood on your hands.
A wretched entity, gasping for air.

Unbolt the hurt locker.
Unbolt the hurt locker.

Outburst of horror, a blood-red shroud.
Feel the reaper's hand.
Face the final end.
What once was, never again shall be.

Hurt locker.

Hurt locker, my palace of pain.
Hurt locker, dead insane.
Hurt locker, my palace of pain.
Hurt locker, dead insane.

Dead insane.
Dead insane.

Dead!
Breeding horror, dead insane.
Dead!
Breeding horror, dead insane.

World of terror.
Breeding horror.

World of pain.
Dead insane.
