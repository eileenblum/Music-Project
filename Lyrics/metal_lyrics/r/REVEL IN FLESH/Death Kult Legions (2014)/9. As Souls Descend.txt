Kneel at the gates, tremble when death awaits.

Last sacrament, a final lament.
Your dark hour, covered in a shroud of agony... of agony.

Thy grief prophecy.
Shrouded agony.

Shrouded agony.

Bear the pain with no regrets.
Bear the pain, no more tears to shed.

Inhale the stench of the mortal way, exhale your last breath.
Standing at the grove of death.
Transcend through spheres of gloom.
Escape from the shores of doom.

Thy grief prophecy.
Shrouded agony.

Shrouded agony.

Accept your last judgement, in charon's claws.
Descend into the underworld, A nightshades masquerade.
Agonised, as the soul leaves your body.

Transcend through spheres of gloom.
Escape from the shores of doom.

As souls descend, lamentations end.
As souls descend, your lamentations end.

Kneel at the gates, tremble when death awaits.

Bear the pain with no regrets.
Bear the pain, no more tears to shed.

Thy grief prophecy.
Shrouded agony.
Thy grief prophecy.
Shrouded agony.

Shrouded agony.

As souls descend, lamentations end.
As souls descend, your lamentations end.

As souls descend.
