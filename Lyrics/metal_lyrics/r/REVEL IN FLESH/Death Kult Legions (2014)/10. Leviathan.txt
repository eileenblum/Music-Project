Drifting beyond, beyond the gates of Pain... of pain.
Souls leave this mortal shape, souls transcend to the dark.

Left in trance, out of the body.
Possessed by the power of will.
Grotesque perception, slow levitation.
The sense of gravity ends at the dead of night.

Transcending in trance, as the shadows rise.
A perished earth, as blackness conquers the light.
At the dead of night, a final salvation in darkness.
Possessed by will, abandoning into an endless night.

Souls leave this mortal shape, souls transcend to the dark.
Drifting beyond, beyond the gates of Pain.

Drifting beyond.

Condemned in the void between two worlds.
A salvation from agony. 
Paranormal black light.
Souls gather as flaming tongues in a realm where only night prevails.

Transcending in trance, as the shadows rise.
A perished earth, as blackness conquers the light.
At the dead of night, a final salvation in darkness.
Possessed by will, abandoning into an endless night.

Levitation, leave this mortal shape.
Drifting beyond the gates of pain.
Transcendental Chaos.
At the threshold to eternity.
Transcendental Chaos.
A liberation of pain.

Souls drifting like flaming tongues.
Souls enshrined in eternal darkness.

At the dead of night...
At the dead of night, possessed by will.

Levitation, leave this mortal shape.
Drifting beyond the gates of pain.
Transcendental Chaos.
At the threshold to eternity.
Transcendental Chaos.
A liberation of pain.

Liberation.
Liberation.
