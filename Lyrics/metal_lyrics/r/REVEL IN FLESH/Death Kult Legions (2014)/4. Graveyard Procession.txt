Awaken from slumber out of the abyss just before the dawn
One with the dead in the funeral march mortal flesh arises again
Consumed by darkness in a deathbound celebration

Graveyard cult
Twisted graveyard cult

An obscure exhumation
A morbid celebration
Funeral feast on the altar of skulls
In the graveyard procession, procession
Graveyard procession, procession

Necromantic feast on the altar of skulls

Rotten flesh to revel
In the graveyard procession
Feasting from the casket
In the graveyard procession

Crush their eternal shrines
Exhume the corpses
And inhale the stench

Evoke the rotten dead
All shall be eaten
Severed on the burial ground

Graveyard cult
Twisted graveyard cult
Graveyard cult
Wicked graveyard cult

An obscure exhumation
A morbid celebration
Funeral feast on the altar of skulls
In the graveyard procession
In the graveyard procession

Let's dig out the dead!
Rotten flesh to revel
In the graveyard procession
Feasting from the casket

An obscure exhumation
A morbid celebration
Funeral feast on the altar of skulls
In the graveyard procession, procession
Graveyard procession, procession

Raise the grail of putrid blood
In the graveyard procession
Summon the utter dark
In the graveyard procession

Enthroned on a pile of skulls
In a deathbound celebration
Consumed by darkness
In a deathbound celebration

In the graveyard procession, procession
In the graveyard procession, procession
