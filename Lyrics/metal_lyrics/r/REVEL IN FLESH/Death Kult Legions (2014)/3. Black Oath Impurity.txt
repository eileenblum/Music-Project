Witchcraft invocation
Call for perdition
Deep down in the crypt
Where light touches none
The coven is gathering in black
Secrecy of death unveiled
Blood drips from the altar of life

Darkness unbound
Thy black destiny
When darkness unbound
Black oath impurity

Praise the chaos
Bless the dead
Preach the chaos
Bless the dead

Monastery of horror
Conspiracy of dread
Monastery of horror
In obscurity they dwell

Congregated in silence
The walls absorb their screams

In heresy they preach the chaos dawning
In heresy they bless the fall of sin
Spirits drifting through the dungeons
Forever laid to rest
Forever

Blessed by chaos
In heresy they burn
Blessed by the dead
In heresy they burn forever
The coven is burning forever
