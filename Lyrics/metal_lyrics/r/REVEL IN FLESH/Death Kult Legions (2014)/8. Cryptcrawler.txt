Descend into my kingdom below... kingdom below.
Below I crawl. 

Crawl!

Detached from life.
A horror lasting for centuries to come.
Everlasting.

In a deviant burial rite, they tried to keep me down.
Embedded in my crypt, never to rise again.
Grotesque sepulture, brutally deformed.
Extremely mutilated, bondaged to a bundle of flesh.

I'm the cryptcrawler, dwelling deep below.
Cryptcrawler, for centuries I dwell.
The spawn from the pits of hell.

Fear me, your blood curdling nightmare.
Fear me, the revenant shrouded in blood.

Blood.
Shrouded in blood.

In my profound chasm, brutally beheaded.
Body parts nailed in the coffin.
The heart ripped apart.

I'm the cryptcrawler, dwelling deep below.
Cryptcrawler, for centuries I dwell.
The spawn from the pits of hell.

Deep in the pits of hell.

Fear me, your blood curdling nightmare.
Fear me, the revenant shrouded in blood.

Your blood is curdling slowly, as I revel in your flesh.
Your body shrouded in blood, as I inhale your last breath.

Last breath.

Followed by rats, as I creep through the colonnades.

I creep!
I am the cryptcrawler.
In my last resting place.
Everlasting.

Everlasting.
Everlasting.
