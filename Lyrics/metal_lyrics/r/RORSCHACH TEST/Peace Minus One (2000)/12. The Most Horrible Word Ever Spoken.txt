Someone pulled the fire escape in Hell
Someone got knocked out in the last round and hit the bell
Someone thre a match into the sun someone gained
the world and lost his sould it could be anyone
I know the most horrible word ever spoken
It has left a bloody trail of hopes and dreams that are broken
A small toy boat against the tide with all it's might
keeps pushing forward but when the battle's done
it finds it has come now further than the shore
to reach the mountain top to climb above your fears
you spend your whole life reaching to find you never once were near
Almost is the most horrible word ever spoken
I don't believe in Almost.
