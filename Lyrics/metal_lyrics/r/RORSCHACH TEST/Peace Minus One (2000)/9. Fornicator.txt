I was born in a world that was shaped by the blade of a two edged sword
I was draped in a cloth with the sign of the cross and the flame of the Lord
But every time I saw the theif on the tree it began to look a little more like me
I was told not to taste or touch anyone who was outside of the fold (they're unclean)
I was warned not to play I would burn if I played with fire of the flame that I hold
But every time I saw the filth on the street it began to look more beautiful to me
Every time I touched the unclean thing it felt more and more like I was touching me
That's why they call me Fornicator
You play with fire you will burn
The fire will burn all the fornicators
I was stripped of the cloak with the sign of the cross and the flame of the lord
Now I'm dressed all in black I was stabbed in the back by the two edged sword
And every time I see the filth on the streets it's a mirror image staring back at me
Every time I see the thief on the tree it's a mirror image staring back at me
That's why they call me Fornicator
You play with me you will see
The fire will burn all the fornicators
