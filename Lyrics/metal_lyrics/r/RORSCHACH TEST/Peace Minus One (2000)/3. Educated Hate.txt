Johnny came home with a lunchbox full of lead
The note said sorry mom, but your son is dead 
And his friends say he died for honor but there's another reason
We know instead Johnny died for the red bandanna wrapped around his head 
Poverty was getting old, crack for cash and guns for gold 
Kyle and Kevin didn't come home at all
The phone hit the floor when their mother got the call 
And all the newsmen were having a field day 
And all the cops were having a ball
Saying "gangsters kill each other, but these Goth kids kill 'em all!"
Gunfire lights up the night sky
A place where children never learn to cry 
A worse fate called educated hate, HATE 

reading, writing, arithmetic and drive-by practice
3 + 5 + 7 = 357
1 + 8 + 7 = 187
Bald heads raise arms of disgrace 
They wear the sheets to hid their face protect the states
From educated hate
HATE
Reading, writing, arithmetic and drive-by practice
