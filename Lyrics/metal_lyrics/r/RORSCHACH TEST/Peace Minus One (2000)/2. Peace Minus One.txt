Salute the men in blue who protect your life and mine
Night stick swinging closet sadomasochistic swine
Where were you on the day our childhood died
Were you polishing your guns? 
Looks like you weren't the only ones 

You say you come in peace 
We say peace minus one 
Peace minus one
We say make war, fuck love 
A salute to the fallen youth who have died on the cross of our neglect 
Programmed and desensitized to kill all the reject 
And the news shows the clip a thousand times 
And still has the balls to ask the question why 
To serve and to protect 
you say you come in peace
Destroy our self respect 
we say peace minus one
To rape and to degrade 
peace minus one 
Run from the war you've made 
We say make war fuck love 
We say peace minus one
Fourteen year olds have guns 
They say make war fuck love
