Green, Yellow, Light turns red
There's a devil playing in my head
I didn't want to I didn't try
Now I'm haunted by their image as I watch them die
I replay the ending of life so sweet
Now they're seeing heaven in their sleep.
There's an angel in shadow blue coming clearer and it looks like you
There's a devil in hazy blue coming clearer
shocking?
I'm too hardened to turn back 
my heart has gone black
I'll crush the American Dream
Empowered by their faces as I watch them scream
Turning the silence to pure aggression releasing the demons of depression
There's an angel in shadow blue coming clearer and it looks like you
There's a devil in hazy blue coming clearer
shocking?
