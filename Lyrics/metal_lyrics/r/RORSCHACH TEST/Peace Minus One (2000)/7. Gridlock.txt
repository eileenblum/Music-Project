Rise Congregation, rise stand to your feet
Lads zieg hielaluya to your king
fall on your knees like flies
you can't succeed here
apart from everything and nothing that is high
high

Homeless veteran, dying of aids will work for food 
subway needles all for free I'm in the mood
do you feel it too? do you feel high? 
High

Jesus doesn't come through the cotton
Jesus doesn't come through my vein 
Jesus doesn't come through my heart anymore
He says he never knew
my name do you feel the same
when you get
high?
