Whatever happened to love? She's like a used up whore she doesn't work anymore she stopped feeling
I'm in her washing machine except I never get clean I am a permanent stain it's not working
Add one more fuck to the pile who cares? I don't besides, we both know it well it's not working
At least I'm not in denial I don't give a fuck you and every thing that you say it's not working
I'm damn well spent, your damn well spent, it's damn well spent
Whatever happened to drugs? It's just a game that I play to make the pain go away
I'm still hurting, no matter how much I tke it's never able to give one single reason to live it's not working
Add one more hit to the pile who cares? I don't besides, we both know it well it's not working
At least I'm not in denial I don't give a fuck you and all these games that you play it's not working
Whatever happened to God he's playing hide and seek the earth he gave to the meek
has stopped turning I am a piece of his clay the king that gets thrown away
when you learn how to burn you stop feeling
add one more God to the pile who cares? I don't besides, we both know it well it's not working
At least I'm not in denial I don't give a fuck
You and everything that you say it's not working
