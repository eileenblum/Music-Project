As time goes by, I find the things that used to thrill me will now leave me in a state of boredom life rolls on and I'll run to something new and will stay there till it's through making magic in me wait until the thrill is gone once more
then can we back the fuck up?
The old becomes new becomes old becomes new again
Somebody throw the switch and make this rollercoaster stop and back the fuck up!
As time goes by we move from east to west from worst to best we climb to new extremes while seeking temporary joy good to bad rich to poor love to hate peace to war like a rollercoaster doesn't it all leave you wanting more?
