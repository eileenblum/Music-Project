[Blackie / Big Boss]

I turn over the yellowish pages
The parchment falls apart among my fingers
The mysterious prophesy I begin to read
Shall I comprehend the message SOMEONE had sent us ?

When hours of Time come
And the Dark meets the Dark
When the Boy is blinded by sun
And the Girl turns to dust
When two Cups are filled
One is blue and other is purple
When the Old Man devoures the New - Born Child
And changes into the Flame - into the Flame....

When the midnight Hand grinds the Egg
Black Bird flies up onto the Tree
When Winds bring the Breath of Plague
And the Vulture strangles the Nightingale
And Zodiac falls into ashes
When Water starts rising up
And the Flame changes into Ice
When the Multi-arm Being appears - Being appears....

And Melek Taus sits down at her feet
When the Beauty swallows up the Ugliness
And the Pride is known as the Virtue
When the Sea Serpent wakes up
And brings the Gift to all people

Then you enter, oh , you Blind Creature,

Into the beginnings of the New Era !
