[Big Boss / Big Boss]

Thousands of voices use to be heard in distance
Tell tales about themselves, the Eternal Story
Carried by the Wind - it sounds all around
The shell fanfares gust...so lightly.

Mysterious Lykorian made drums sound
The storm whispers in the tops of the trees
It trembles with amazement, everything alive around
Even the Sea stayed still at the Moonlight.

Dance - be merry - the Depths of Ages
The Soul is scorched by the Flame
The Flame of beauty and Southern Winds
Emeralds of Rains run down the cheeks.

The Beam of the Birth illuminated the landscape
The chiaroscuro of tones will cares the eyes
The Messengers of the Masters will light torches
They glow like Stars - the Frost is around.

Slowly rejoicings and bustle calm down
Lykorian falls asleep - the Storm went to sleep
The Sea will wave shortly, even the shells will fall
silent
And the New Space's shining all around us.
