[Big Boss / Big Boss]

Through all the endless Spaces
Like a dark track of Time
Runs the deadly Curse of Durron
Oh, hear words glowing like thousands of Suns !

You ! All you mortal and ordinary
Who don't know the secret Or' Ma Or'
And will never understand the Wisdom of the crystal
star
That controls the flow of Endless Time.

You ! All you mortal and ordinary
Who cannot defy Dar'Gel
And his Power springing out of Eternity
He rules the cosmic brightness Ty'r.

All you mortal and ordinary -

Who are subject to the Laws of Emptiness
And who can't drink from the Goblet Su'r Gyn'yn
Which is the only Spring

You ! All you mortal and ordinary
Who don't want to listen to silvery tones Za'z
And who reject the Beauty and Wisdom of the Breeding
Ages

You all be cursed !

Be cursed !
