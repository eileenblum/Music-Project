[Alesh / Big Boss]

In the dark Vagina of the Space
Penis of the Life pulsates
Frantic Sperm hitting......
The ovaries of Black Holes.

Along the spiral of Time
Germs rush through space
Devouring deadly Wisdom
Of the icy Infinite
Emerald eyes of the Embryo
Make their way through the Cosmic Dust
Glowing heart of the Foetus
Is fed with the artery of Wisdom

I stand astride, my my feet
On ancient Planets
And the brain, brain, brain, brain mass
Of my split skull
Being penetrated / by Aeonal Wisdom
By Aeonal Wisdom of endless Ages....

I am the Fire of Life, Life / and the Breath of Death,
Death
I stand alone, eternal, eternal
In the centre / of my own / existence !

Deserted by everybody / Multiple despite that
Destroyer and Creator / Creator of the Spirals
I let the extinction of Time arise
By the birth, by the birth
Of the Infinite

My Loneliness is Victory
Over the self-delusion of Happiness !
