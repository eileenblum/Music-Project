[Blackie, Alesh / Big Boss]

Why ?

I dance on grey skulls
Of just hipocrites !

On my shoulders I carry
The globe full of fools !

I devour my own trails
On which my homunculus hangs !

The comet shot out of my brain
Will not reach the borders of the Space !

Crowds of idiots trample down
My pregnant pituitary gland !

I weep over my Loneliness
Surrounded by my Friends !

I must laugh at the kidness
Of my mortal Enemies !

I open my Inward Mind
For the icy breath of the endless Existence !

I want to change into an icicle
Of the universal Reason !

My heart turned to stone
Together with the testicles of the Life !

Thousands of hammers hitting the anvil
Of my dark Destiny !

Why ?.........Billion of Nothing......!
