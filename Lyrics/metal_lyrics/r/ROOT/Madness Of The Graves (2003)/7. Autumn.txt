[Legend about life]

In autumnal yellowed foliage 
Knightly armor dwells and killed horse
Sunlight breeze dry out dew
On helmet and sword of hero

Hero dropped of in eternal sleep
Glance of his dull blue eyes
Sad and weary towards heaven aim
Fade away the glory of gallant knights

Trees are bowing down with wistful song
Grey hairs of fathers, woeful eyes of mothers
Tone of sylvan horns sounds through the autumn
Clamor of battles in a distance fade away.

As it whole world were went to sleep
And stars glowing on yellowed foliage
Where knightly armor dwell
And killed horse, helmet and sword...

[Dedicated to J.Vrobel]

I would become my own demon, somebody speaks to me, 
his sight fire's a sign in my heart, sign of age and death, 
sign fiery and frore, coursing before me dark and horrid.
