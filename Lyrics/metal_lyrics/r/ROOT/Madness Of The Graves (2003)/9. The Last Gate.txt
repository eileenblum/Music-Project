[The story of Demons]

[Equirhodont:]
In times of dark ages
Demons of extinction raised
And opened gates to all realms. 
Naked beings were leaved at the mercy
Of withering power, as stalls fall. 

[Old Ones:]
Ninety-nine Gates are already closed
Their worlds are ruined. 
Only last gate is withstanding
Protected by immense power
Mages are defending their world. 

[Durron:]
Demons are insane and rage with anger
Who is rising to oppose them? 
What are these powers? 
Which is protecting this world? 
Why is it? 

[Hex:]
Nathless they are only two
Strong and powerful, invincible. 
The first Equirhodont is, 
The second Durron is called
Their world is Magic. 

[Lykorian:]
The wall created by spells
Is rising before demons. 
The wall eternal like universe
Resilient like Mages
Is stronger after every thrust. 

[Magician:]
The struggle appear to be infinite 
Isn't it however only a dream? 
Milliard years already last, 
Does not appear that one day ends up
Why should so? 

[Leviathan:]
Black magic is aeonic, powerful
Demons hold their world. 
Who was drive them into the battle
Which hasn't winner 
Which will have the end? 

[Equirhodont:]
No one knows, and don't understand 
This endless urge 
Conquer the mystery and mysticism 
Volition of Excellency 
Hunger for eternity.

So the struggle lasts to these days
And will last forever. 
You are only ordinary humans, 
Humans before gates. 
Before closed gates! 
Forever! 
Forever and alone! 
You stupid humans
forever!

The last went away, I stayed alone among graves, serene, silvern, 
in which rests thousand tales, which nobody knows, 
which nobody listen in and which nobody narrates ...
