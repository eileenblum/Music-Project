[Calling]

Silver gathers of the Graves,
Silver flowers of the Graves,
Silver voices of the Graves,
Silver eyes of the Graves...

They calling me every night
Singing to almost go mad
Singing their songs of death
I tell you everything I heard
During a dark nights.

Ballads of death empires
Ballads of dead realms
Ballads of dead ages
Ballads of Graves

They calling me every night
Singing to almost go mad
Singing their songs of death
I tell you everything I heard
During a dark nights.
...I hear the voices, they speak of Ancestors, glory, uprising, failure...
