[Ballad of ancient realms]

Excrescences of hate are weaving
With roots of spite and evil. 
Coursing mass of matter 
Lento changing color and shape.

What will be spawned in following while? 
What will be smashed for new life? 
What's going on in a heart of darkness? 
What's going on in a heart of darkness?

What revived all universes? 
What is that great mystery? 
Wherefrom coming in tidings to us? 
Are we the origin or fetus?

Heart of darkness pulse in depth. 
Rivers of ages are joining there
Gates of worlds purfle shores. 
But where rise life and death?

Hate and love are dancing together, 
Birth with extinction ardently screwing, 
Their children -life and death -rejoice, 
Sadness is smiling and pleasure is crying ...

I am lying down exhausted, unable to move, resolved not to listen, 
full of lunacy and mystified, 
nathless the Last is coming and I am arising again, 
seized with insatiable desire for knowledge, The last is narrate.
