[The tones of mystery]

I see a shape - or is that a mere hallucination? - 
As rocking on me and from their eyes trickle the bloody tears, 
I hear a whisper of lifeless lips, it calling me on into the depth, 
I am going away with it, awake in the empire of dead, 
I hear words, out of one's graves arising a legends of dead dreams, 
listen in with me to tales, which once were truth
