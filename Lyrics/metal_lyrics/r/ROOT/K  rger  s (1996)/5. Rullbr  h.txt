[Blackie / Big Boss]

[RullbrÃ¤h:]
I'm learning the anxiety of happiness,
it seemed deceitful long ago, but words of praise urge to birth
a harbinger of butterfly flight.

[RullbrÃ¤h:]
Glory of spite, delight of blood,
Happiness of happy - go luckiest and the forever mute,
of strong only in beauty and vulnerability
living in the sorrow of their souls.

[Prophet:]
I come across happiness
without looking for it,
lost in the bottom of bitterness
in the garden of faded flowers.

[RullbrÃ¤h:]
I'm listening to the whispering of voices,
about the blossomed solitude of abandoned eyes,
solitude agitates my heart.

[RullbrÃ¤h and Prophet:]
I will no longer, may be when I wake up...
