[Blackie / Big Boss]

With a mix of love and sorrow
I'm watching the beautiful land
that already by its birth
was ordained to come to an end.

Why?
It disappeared under the
layers of millenniums,
not even a recollection has remained.
Where went the living and dead
so beautiful and yet mortal?

It only lives in my mind,
the awesomely sad recollection
of the cruel fate of my beloved,
proud nation - KÃ¤rgerÃ¤i.
