[Blackie / Big Boss]

I am an envoy of Infinity,
Materialization of mysterious Wishes,
I am Grandiose Magus Equirhodont
And I have fulfilled my mission

The race from the Stars that created you
Was destroyed by you - why?
I am the last of them thousands of us who survived
Are sealed in Black Stone.

Only longing for vengeance gave us the power to create
Me, the Stone and Dygon.
Note RodÃ¤xx what you must know,
For each blow to Dygon
All living are paying with their lives.

And that also you bravery became our vengeance
Only RullbrÃ¤h is innocent, innocent
Although she is mother of Dygon.

We don't exist any more
I have fulfilled my mission
Nothing more than Emptiness
I have finished - I am the Grandiose Magus .
