[Big Boss / Big Boss]

Why does KÃ¤rgerÃ¤s not exist anymore?
Who knows?
Nobody will learn the secret of Ages,
Nobody can stand up to the order
Who knows?
That is given by Infinity.
Who knows?

I remained alone, TrygÃ¤n - Sexton,
For long years I buried all who died
From day to day.

And there's nobody left here anymore
Alive or dead - I am alone here,
The last grave is dug,
For me the Time has also come.

I am leaving alone, abandoned by Life,
Sad nad redundant,
I'm laying down to sleep,
Out of which there's no waking,
KÃ¤rgerÃ¤s doesn't exist anymore

A long time ago there lived...
Mighty, mighty KÃ¤rgerÃ¤i!
