In the silent night only purple flash
running the dark sky
I'm going to the Wall
That's rising in great distance.

This Wall is made of Centuries stones
Only I know her secrets
Bones fragments - dotted around
I see my life and holding breath.

The Unknown Ones walking around me
their eyes glowing, their mouth grin
they talk to me with unknown language
I would like Stop it, but I must going...

I hurry to the Wall, flying like wind
Mystery Power driving me forward
I'm Apocalyptic - Horseman
And this Wall is my Goal!
Is it Wall of Death?
Is it Wall of Life?
