In bottomless emptiness of my Solitude
sound the string of Life - and I'll born again
such as Phoenix from the ashes...

With my foot crushes grey Eternal Dust
any secrets not hidden from me.
My flame abloom with Black, Black Roses
in the mist wide open darkened Crypt.
I enter alone hidden curious eyes
And take this Black Book to my hands
Absorb the Power from Book of Wisdom
And receives Message of my Darkened Gods.

The Message is attended with tympanums rumble
Earth abyss awaken... Earth abyss awaken...
From Volcano's flows fiery Truth
in the flood of Knowledge will drown many ones.
Black Flash crack into the Cosmic Wisdom
here comes my friend Time.
Human disappear in this Book of Fate
I know pain - development of all human race.
In bottomless emptiness of my Solitude
sound the string of Life - and I'll born again
such as Phoenix from the ashes...
... I come with Knowledge!!!
