There is the Pit
There my friends dwell
There is Azathoth - great Center
Of the Cosmos... and playing on
His flute...

There is Yog Sothoth - Master of
Dimensions - and Faceless One...
and Faceless One...

There is Nyarlathotep - Black Messenger
And Black Prince of the Abyss...
There is Shub - Niggurath - Father of the world of Horror,
And Ram of The Sun...
There is Cthulhu - Eternal Serpent who sleeps
There is The Goat of a Thousand Young!
I know The Old Ones!
