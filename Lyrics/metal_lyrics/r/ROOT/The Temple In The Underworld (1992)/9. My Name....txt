When I dance over dying Life
and Black Pearls Flow from my
empty eyes sockets, is it the Termination?
My name is DEATH...

When I play on the Flute made from
your skin-bone, and my jaws are roaring
with laughter in neverending smile
is it the Termination?
My name is DEATH...

I'm Immortal by my death
and my realm is borderless
I'm like you all
without hearts, without reason
but I'm happy, 'cause my name is DEATH!
is DEATH!
