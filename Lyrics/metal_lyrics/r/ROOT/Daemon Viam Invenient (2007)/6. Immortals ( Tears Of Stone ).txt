Extinct looks of the stony giants
Witnesses of forgotten Aeons
They talk each other
When all go to sleep.

Allegorial stories they tell together
of the times when the Great ruled
they remember-
when all go to sleep.

Then the Right was the Right
And Lie was its reverse.
The Stone lives-
When all go to sleep.

They saw it all therefore they know,
how the creatures came and left.
They sing-
When all go to sleep.

Then the Wise came created Things,
they turned to nothing, but who knows...
the Stone breathes-
when all go to sleep.

The Ages passed the World was incubating
which for long forgotten is.
Tears of stone-
when all go to sleep.

Memories turned to dust
so why to wake the dead from sleep
we stand here-
even if all go to sleep.
