Dark diamonds in your eyes
Oh, how bewitched they glow

What are you holding mysterious goddess
Do you know my secrets, maybe?

I can see your face by day by night
I can see you in ponds in rocks.

I can hear in the leaves, in the wind
I can hear you in the revers in the seas.

I know you from the very Ages
You are everywhere i am
