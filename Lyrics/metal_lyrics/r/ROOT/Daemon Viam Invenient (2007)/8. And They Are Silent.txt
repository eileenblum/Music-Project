Just silently lay the Messengers of Time
As if Death suddenly caressed them.

Autumn painted leaves,
gently cover the Earth,
just as if drowsing protecting,
but who against?
What shall come?
...and they are silent.

Manking going to sleep
not aware of any evil
its quest is done
but for whom?
What shall come?
...and they are silent

Animosity of the moment of Doom
everything that was is breaking down,
bound by the eternal Cycle
whose Order it is?
What shall come?
...and they are silent.
All has been considered
all has been counted
and will fade in void.
So has been decided!
What shall come next?
...and they are silent

Wanna know the right?

That was the universum rising
and told the Verdict
upon all the Mankind and its deeds!
They are silent no more.
They spoke...
