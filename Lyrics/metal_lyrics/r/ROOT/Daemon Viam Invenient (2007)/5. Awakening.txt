I held his arms
When he was dying
Glowing universes in his eyes
When he was dying
His mouth whispered legends
When he was dying
He wished to become me
When he was dying
I wished to become him
When he was dying
He fell to dust
When he was dying
I put on his candle
When he was dying
And then...?
I was born
as he died
