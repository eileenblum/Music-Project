It creeps in our dreams
The flowers of lotus with wolfteeth
amazing sceneries with dead
breathing beauty of death

Strange beauty of Fright

Amazing feeling of fear
which we love with abandon
fantastic pictures of life
turned into cruel pain

Strange beauty of Fright

We cannot fight it
we are overcome with feeling of sorrow
we are crying upon the dead beast
anyhow we love the

Strange beauty of Fright
