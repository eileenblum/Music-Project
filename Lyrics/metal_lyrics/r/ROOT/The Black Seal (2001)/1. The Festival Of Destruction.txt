[Blackie / Big Boss]

Sprightly Celebrating in His name will break out
In the streams of blood we will wash our Hearts
And from the broken skulls of our enemies
We will drink the elixir of Death to the birth of Power !

Skeletons on horses are coming with the Night
Flames are reflected against gloomy rocks
We are dancing, drinking, naked and intractable
We call into the fire: In Nomine... In Nomine...

The time of sacrifices is coming, knife-edges are glowing
Living hearts are torn from bodies, blood is streaming
We squirm in a trance of pleasure and lust
The Gate opens up and He is coming!

His cruel smile fondles all of us
The best bites are offered to Him
We throw away bones in the dancing whirl
We call into the fire: In Nomine... In Nomine...

In Nomine Satanas!
