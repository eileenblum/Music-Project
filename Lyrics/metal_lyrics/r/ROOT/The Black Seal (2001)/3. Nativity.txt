[Blackie / Big Boss]

Before million ages
Great and wise was born
Strong and eternal arise out of him.
Our father's and endless Nira.

Ancient hollows
Expended their mysteries
I came on world in chilling grief
Not knowing my mission
of cursed legacy.

Roar of devil's
attended my birth
They knew who I am.
Beast's freaked, rocks were torn, 
Even the time was stood with dread
I've come.
