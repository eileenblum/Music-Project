[Big Boss, Ashok / Big Boss]

Through myself one can reach the place of eternal suffering,
Through myself one can reach the night that is not followed by a morning,
Through myself one can reach the cursed bastards of one's mother-country... (**)

Who knows the mysterious place,
Where it lies forgotten,
Covered with a layer of the whole millennium's dust
And still waiting and waiting...

Who finds it and use it,
Will become the Lord of the World,
The Central Point of Magic
Is conjured in it....

I have been looking for it for whole Ages,
I am close, very close now,
I can feel its power and force,
My black blood is boiling...

I know it is waiting for me,
We are tied together with a bond,
Bond of dark anger,
Cruelty, passion and victory...

When I seize it with my hands
And say the Words,
Then the Galaxy contracts,
Then be in fear, you...

... you disgusting, you stinking!

[(**) Dante, Inferno.]
