[Blackie / BigBoss]

Do you want to cross the River of Shadows
And come back afterwards?
Do you want to talk to the Ferryman 
And sit in his Punt?

Do you want to see the Lost Worlds
And mysterious nations?
Do you want to fly through night with Phoenix
And to get warm in his Ashes?

Then you must know that:

There is the only Mountain in the only Plane,
In it four Fires flame,
The first one smaller than the second,
In which Salamandra takes bath,
The third one is bigger and the forth is the brightest of all,
Then take away her Being with a Three-Pronged Fork
And at the Lucifer's glitter
Take out her Heart - the Heart of Salamandra,
Put it in Salt Water and wait.

Drink the potion the Ninth night!
