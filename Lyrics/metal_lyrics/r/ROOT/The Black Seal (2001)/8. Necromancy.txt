[Big Boss / Big Boss]

Come! O you triple goddess!
Hellish, earthly and heavenly goddess!
Goddess of roads and crossroads!

You nightly friend of light,
Who despite this carries light to us,
You friend and mate of the Night....!

Wandering among shadows and graves,
You take pleasure in the long howling of hounds
And in vapours of shed blood.

You lust after blood
And fill mortal creatures with horror...!
O Gorga ! O Morma ! You multiform Moon!

Turn out to be your beam,
Favorable to the sacrifice carried
In honour of you!
