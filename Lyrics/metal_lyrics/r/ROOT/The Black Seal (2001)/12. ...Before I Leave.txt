[Big Boss, Ashok / Big Boss]

Before I leave to reach the Deceased
I want to let you know the Truth.
I know the Laws that are engraved
In the silver vault of the Monster's skull.

Some were smoothed away by the flow of Time
And they lost their meaning.
Those, which still can be read,
Turned into Mighty Magic Spells.

Those, who are watchful now,
Will be sure to find the Key to them.
But using them for the evocation
Is deadly to everyone!

Before the rise of the World
Old curses speak to you now.
... Before I leave to reach the Spiral,
I will leave you my Legacy.
