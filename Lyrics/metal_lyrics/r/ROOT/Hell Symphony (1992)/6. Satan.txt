Have you Afraid - 
that - your heart will be tearing
by mass poisonfull lies
that - your mind is smack to pieces
with Secret scream of unknown
that - your soul bridge over the pit
of Time between Life and Death
that - lust that you controlled is
roaring monstrous Symphony of
Pleasure.
that - horrible macabre creation
drowing create of Foetus.
that - emptiness of your skull
is filling putrefactions Knowledge
that - Satan that living in yourself
will rising His Goblet ?
WELL - you raising it with Him
And toast to birth of REASON !
