Shine . . . shine . . . shine . . . shine
Luminous flash intersect to my brain
Empty eye - sockets glare
What want the yellow bone - say to me ?
Ah ! Master of Knowledge, Ah Lucifer !
I have this lies sick of neek ! 
Add up their deceits
It is impossible
Already decay their frocks
We filling barrels with brimestone
Bring full hods - of poison !
Lucifer's silver Sword
flying silent night
I hold it in my hand !
we mustn't be knock down
Burning Black Candles !
Second Prince of Eternal Darkness !
today light his weapon
it knowledge heat to me !
Golden throne turns to ruins
And Lucifer laughing again !
