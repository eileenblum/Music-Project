Abyss shakin' like before the storm
- I'm screaming : "ZODACARE" !
where flowed river, new boiling lava
- I'm screaming : "ZODACARE" !
where stood forest, now is wasted plains
- I'm screaming : "ZODACARE" !
where was gold, now black load growin' up
- I'm screaming : "ZODACARE" !
where was life, now putrefaction smell
- I'm screaming : "ZODACARE" !
where was fire, now cold winter rules
- I'm screaming : "ZODACARE" !
where crystal glittered, now earth laying
- I'm screaming : "ZODACARE" !
He very good watching entrance to Earth
of Freedom. 
- I'm screaming : "ZODACARE" !
There rules BELIAL !
