Beasts and Creatures
Endless pits
Truth and death
Life and swamp
Storms and billows
Flames in water
Mist and glow
Green death
Sea - god raising - rage 
Undewater fury - dismay 
Leviathan - is the Lord
Leviathan - our Master 
Snake breath blowin' you
Don't you see on other shore 
Leviathan . . . 
You will see fiery temple 
And underwater Pentagram
Leviathan . . . 
Now you see the eye of Snake
So raisin' your Baphomet
Leviathan . . . 
Already you give in to our Master
and forver turn upsidde down
your cross !
Leviathan . . .
