At midnight when owl hoot
And moon is full, and moon is full
Draw nearing time
I screech frightened
My friends runaway, runaway from
my home
I'm shakin' with frighten?
I know that it isn't dream
I know that it isn't dream
I'm turn into LOKI - my tooth is sharp
my claws want break - eyes is glare
my tongue is bloody - I'm shakin' with mad
and rushing and rushing - into depth
of black night.
LOKI - LOKI - LOKI 
At day break I'm come back
on my hands is blood
My turn was done
I'm human again !
But this nothing for me
I wanna be LOKI again !
LOKI - LOKI - LOKI
