Fiery flame of firre
Implacable hate 
Fury power roaring
Already light and thunder
Inferno rush across the earth
Abaddon drawing takes breath
His heart is like stone
Bursting out breath of death
ABADDON - fury, ABADDON - mad
ABADDON - crusher, ABADDON - slayer 
Heavens gates crashing down
Into the deep of fire
Golden altars is fallen
And you listenin' Satans laugh !
