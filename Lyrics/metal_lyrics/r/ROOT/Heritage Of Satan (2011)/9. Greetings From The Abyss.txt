We invoke, invoke, invoke You our Master
We, the chosen ones, beg You
For the command to the Ultimate Attack

We canÂ´t hesitate, They are coming
Our streeds stand ready, swords shining
So give the Ultimate Command!

CHARGE!

The Prince of Death flies above the battlefield
Blood, sweat, dust, scream of horsesÂ´ neighing
Red clouds cover the scene

...And then the Horns will blow
And the Enemy will be swept into Nothingness
...Only Dust and Ashes!
