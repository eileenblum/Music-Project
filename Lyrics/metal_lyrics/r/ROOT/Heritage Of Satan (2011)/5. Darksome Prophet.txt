The Darksome Prophet
Comes through The Time
His words precede his Deeds

The Darksome Prophet
Speaks to you with The Voice
To you all and all your Sons

The Darksome Prophet
His hand makes the Sign
His gesture penetrated with Wisdom

The Darksome Prophet
Will turn the dist in Silver
Lie and truth seem to be Virtue

The Darksome Prophet
A fiery glow in his eyes
Will burn everything - even the saint preachers

The Darksome Prophet
The darkness of Dreams comes alive
Do as your Wisdom tells
