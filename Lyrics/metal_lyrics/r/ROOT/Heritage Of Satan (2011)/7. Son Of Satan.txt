Ad Satanas Qui Laetificat Juventutem Meam.
To Satan, Giver Of Youth and Happiness.

From the Dragon breath
And the fiery Diamond

From the Infernal Power
And the black Seed

From the cursed Woman
Of Diabolic Kind

From the Dark side
Of the kind of Man

From the might of Trapezoid
And the womb of Magic

HE was born
THE SON OF SATAN!
