Yellow eyes glow
AdamÂ´s descendants run away
Flared revenge - the stamp of hooves
Riders in black cloaks
Golden chalices smashed in mud
Holy temples burn, burn, burn
No remorse
Only the revenge shining in the eyes
For thousands years of lies
For millions of innocents
Amazing Satan
Now collecting tax, the tax of Truth
For hypocrisy - Death Penalty!
For falsehood - Death Penalty!
Shining Lucifer
Burning with his gaze
AdamÂ´s descendants screaming with terror
Now the Truth has come
TheyÂ´re pounded by Belial
The Riders have passed by
Only dust remains
Dust, Bones and Truth...
The Ground for new Empire
Dust, Bones and Truth...
Black Rooster is singing
The Kingdom of Darkness
Comes to Rule

Pone, Diabolus, Custodiam!
Devil, set a Guard!

[Son:]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Here comes His Dark Majesty
SATAN!
[Son:]
SHUT UP!!!

[SATAN:]
"Welcome, my Son"
