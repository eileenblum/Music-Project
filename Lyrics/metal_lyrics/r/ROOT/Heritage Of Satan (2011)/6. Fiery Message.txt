So open the Infernal Book
Read the Fiery Message:

"...And Fateful Times will come
When everything turns to dust
And the dust turns to nothning
And from the Pre-Substance He will be created
And He will create everything New
And He will be the only Law
The Law of Chaos and the Law of Order

The Legion of Doom comes from the Darkness
The silver Horns glow in flames
Upon them the wings of Demons and Creatures
And rocks burn, oceans dye with blood

...And the Hordes from Hells will rise
Satisfy their desires upon the Dead
And Universe itself will tremble
And the smile of Fangs of steel will glow
Upon the ghastly end of Existence
And skeletons will be smashed to dust
And the memories of YOU will vanish

The Legion of Doom comes from the Darkness
the silver Horns glow in flames
Upon them the wings of Demons and Creatures
And rocks burn, oceans dye with blood"
