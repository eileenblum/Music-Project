One day they will rise
Creatures, no eye has seen
Myriads, monsters and monsters
The Maw of Hell will open

And will pay
Those who hesitated
Worthless creatures
Clad in golden cloaks

Crowns and crosses
Crushed by hooves
Those bizzare buildings
Razed to the ground

And prayers in vain
Will turn to Scream
Turn to Pain
Turn to Nothing

Revenge of Hell
Revenge of Hell
Revenge of Hell
Sweet will be the Revenge of Hell!!
