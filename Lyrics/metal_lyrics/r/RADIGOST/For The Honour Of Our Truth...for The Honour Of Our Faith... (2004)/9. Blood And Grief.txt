As I'm standing above this world my soul is overflowing with sadness.
Woe to you, the glorious people if you have despised the exploits of your fathers.
You have forgotten how were our ancestors dying for the honor of our lands and for the honor of our names.
How many enemies had been killed and how many cities had been taken.
Our swords were sharp, but now there are only ashes.
Woe to you, who allowed our enemies to trample our shields, to crush our faith with cross, to slander our truth.
But the Sun of justice shall light our way and traitors will be committed to flames.
Release your hatred, behead the enemy.
