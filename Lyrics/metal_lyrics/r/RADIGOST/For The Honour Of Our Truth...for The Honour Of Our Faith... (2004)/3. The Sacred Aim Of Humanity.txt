Who am I?
A common creature born in the anvil of Gods?
Knight or priest, worker or thief: one with desires, one with hopes.
I walk my way, from birth till death, I walk my way of glory and misery.
I fight with evil or I kill for truth, I fight for treasure or guard the âjusticeâ.
And what I feel during my life?
I feel hatred!
What is my state while I live?
State of war!
What is the aim of my existence?
To slay (punish) the enemy.
Who are my enemies?
People like me.
Ha ha ha.
Blessed be, the God of war.
In the name of you I kill more and more.
