Night is my soul and stone is my heart.
The Moon is in my eyes, the Moon lightening this long way of darkness.
Look in my mind, look in the eyes of the night.
Who is walking there in the mist, who dwell in the dark realm of my thoughts?
Pass through the silvery streams lit with the light of the Moon.
Walk along the shadow paths that guide you to my spectral palace.
Far from the Sun it stands, far in my dreams.
The only king of it is me and you.
We, emperors of many lands, we summon dragons and execute entire nations, we are the gods of our world.
But could we exist if the darkness of our souls was released?
Life in the eternal night ...
