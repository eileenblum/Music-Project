The constellations are in bedlam
As the universe never seems to seize expansion
To contrive a new inauguration
Bewildered thoughts for mankind to conceive
Unalterable dire beseeched
To impel the terminus of existence
And the world befallen
Malignant new reign of calamity

Eliminating all credence
And long fought for bigoted reckoning
An affinity to enthrall our dilemma innate
Of entities that man's feebleness procreated
To cajole the void that swallowed our kind alive
Pacifying, omitting and deaf
From listening to the true voice
Of the one whom lives aloof
In the cosmic abyss

Captivating all chaos to reform into order
An eternity of infinity
But now awaits slumber as he has not
Been recognized
To be reborn again,
And so it has come
Upon a Twilight Sun
An eternity of infinity
Draws mortality...
