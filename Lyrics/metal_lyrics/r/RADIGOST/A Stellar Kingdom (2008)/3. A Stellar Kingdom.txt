The first born chaos was a key to the spring of life.
The birth of a star: beginning of a new epoch.
Ever spinning wheel of a beings
Invisible, but tangible
It lives, it gives strength to the stars,
a door to the multiverse.

Billions of suns from the eternal dark,
Dancing, flying in the abyss.
Crown of heavenly fire
In the celestial icy castles.
"Emptiness" becomes inhabited,
"Emptiness" turns into Creation.

Dying, but never dead
It will remain for millenniums.
Renewing or fading away,
A Stellar Kingdom builds it's strongholds,
Steadfast through the Infinity,
The shelters of your own,
The places to fight in...
...The Order to die for in Rebirth...
