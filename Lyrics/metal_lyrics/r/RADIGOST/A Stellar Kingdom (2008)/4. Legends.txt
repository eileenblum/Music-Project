Where was I when the first man appeared and the first word was said?
he fear, the thought, the sound...
Something unseen or some kind of flying serpent.
A forest beast and a nameless spirit, an uncontrollable energy.
I followed man all the path, the long road of history.
Transforming, shapechanging shadow. I was many.
The hidden, but more evident than a ray of light sometimes.
Reflection of great kings, the cradle of myths.
Nobody could tell what I was, as well as nobody knows it now.
Today I am prayed and worshiped, I am the holy great one.
The Almost United One!
But what will I be when the Human will not be?
