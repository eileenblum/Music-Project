Twilight of mankind: human, leading himself to extinction,
The deadlock of evolution means degradation and regress

Dark instincts prevail, the lower ones gather in packs
To fill their own pockets full, to finish off the heroes

Greed, killing honor, industry, killing nature.
The never-ending wheel of war is running,
Swallowing last resources of the planet.
The outward imperial grandeur hides the inner poorness.

Last thoughts of dying science,
The greatest killing machine is ready
To make the end coming faster:
Civilizations are fallen!
Back to the wildness, back to the tribes
The strongest is right, there is no place for creativity,
Cause aggression means life now.

The failed experiment of the "Gods" comes to its end:
Dying humanity on the exhausted mother Earth.
