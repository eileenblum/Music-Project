How art thou fallen from heaven, o Lu'ci-fer, son of the morning!
How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations.
For thou hast said in thine heart,
I will ascend into heaven,
I will exalt my throne above the stars of God:
I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation,
In the sides of the North:
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
I will be like the most High.
Yet thou shalt be brought down to Hell, to the sides of the pit.
