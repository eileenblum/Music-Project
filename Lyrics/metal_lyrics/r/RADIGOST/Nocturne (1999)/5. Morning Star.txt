The abyss of forgotten dreams and desperate thoughts
was lost in the"bright"light of half God.
Evil embodiment of your vicious hopes,
I was lost in the labyrinth of the being.
Blind ones saw me and deaf ones heard me.
They didn't know that they are part of me and I am part of them.
Shining morning star, shining brighter than other stars,
I cry in the loneliness, face to face with my thoughts.
Can you hear me?
Lost in the forest of desires, I walk my path with you.
The beast hidden in your soul, the star in your mind.
