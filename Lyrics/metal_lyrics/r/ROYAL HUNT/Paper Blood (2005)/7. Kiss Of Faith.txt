Only dead have seen the end of war...
Knowing that - I fell a bit better
When I do remember what's happened before... oh well.
Moving on to the heart of the matter
Father always told me 'bout men and mice,
Being not afraid to take chances
Well, he said enough 'coz by the time he got iced
I was on my way - circumstances
Led me out into the open...
Boy, reality bites.
Doesn't matter what you do -
Another crook gets rich
Doesn't mean a thing what's your calling
Living by your heart and whining
"Life is such a bitch"?
Anyway you go - you're falling to the bottom of the food chain.
When the moon comes up
And the sun goes down
I can change the whole world.
Feeling stronger
From the dead of night
To the morning light
Getting ready to challenge my faith
When you're feeling weak
And you life seems tough,
You can't wait for a break any longer...
Who can stone you cold,
Who can whip you down
If you stal a lil'kiss from your faith
Do I live as I live or do as I do?
Don't forget who told you:
"When life has no value - death has its price"
...just something I saw in my father's eyes.
