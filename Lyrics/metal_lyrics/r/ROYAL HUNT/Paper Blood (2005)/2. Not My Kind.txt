Time is running out, you're left behind
Can't you see - you're not my kind?
Somebody's gain's built on somebody's loss -
Friendship of ourswas a beautiful ghost
Better run home - put a hell of a race -
Get yourself a pretty, brand new face
You're not my kind.
Tell me your dream and I'll tell you your soul.
Higher we climb? Even harder we fall
Son of a bitch keeps on hangin' around -
Stay away or I'll rip your heart out.
Hustling left and right - so this is your kind?
Time is running out, just let it go
Search your heart and you will find
Seeds of hate and envy, left to grow. Can't you see - you're not my kind?
Year after year, all those battles we've fought...
Hard to believe - but you've got yourself caught
Nowhere to hide, now you're under attack -
Nice lil'load and it broke your back
Scream into the night - so this is your kind?
