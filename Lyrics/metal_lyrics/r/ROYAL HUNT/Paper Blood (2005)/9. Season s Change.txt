Images of winter gently move
Fallen, golden leaves.
Sun is hiding far behind the roof,
Knowing what it means
Days are getting shorter, I can see
Chilling tears of fall
Running down for you and leaving me
Out here in the cold
Since you left whatever I would do -
Nothing comes out right
I'm fighting through another lonely day,
Another sleepless night.
Dreaming 'bout wings to fly away
But as I was told
Brokenhearted can't, the're cursed to stay
Out here in the cold
This change of a season is over and done
Won't look for a reason... just sad that you're gone
Every single word you've ever said
Is ringing in my ears
Making me remember what I had.
This burning trail of tears
Leading me away, into the night...
Closer to my fall.
Season's changing, turning off the light
Out here in the cold
Dissapearing very slow - this line of footsteps in the snow...
Spirit of my better day's living on the edge
Be it so and let it be... 'coz as far as I can see
There's no way to escape this season's change.
