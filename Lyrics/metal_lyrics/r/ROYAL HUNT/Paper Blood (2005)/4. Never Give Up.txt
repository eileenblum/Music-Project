It's over now... I feel my sadness fades away
Wonder how we could survive and take it through another day?
I'd say chances are few - but they are out there,
Start something new - right now and right here
Look, I'm telling you...
We'll never give up, we'll never give in
Wherever this road's gonna lead us
We'll never give up, we're playin' to win
And heading right up to the top
We'll never give up, we'll never retreat
Whatever out there's gonna hit us
We'll never give up, we'll land on our feet
We'll make it come right in the end -
We'll never give up.
Seconds fly as if the're bullets. Could it be
Worth a try to cut them loose and let some peace come sown on me?
I see chances are few but the are out there,
Waiting for you to decide
To start something new - right now and right here -
To change your life tonight.
