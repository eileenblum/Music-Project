I'm rising sails to leave my father's land
No longer waiting for the tide
It took a while to try and understand
How do I want to live my life:
You live it or lie it - anyway you want.
I cross the ocean to another side to see the world you've never seen
I'm walking straight into the glowing light feeling as twice the man I've ever been
You live it or lie it - no reason to deny it.
Stop dreaming, start living...
All you have to do is break your chains.
Uncounted wonders no one's seen before...
I've watched them rise and dissapear
It could've been you - just open up the door
And take that first step to overcome you fear.
