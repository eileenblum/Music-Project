I was raised in a faraway land,
Tryin' to be number one.
Dad use to tell me -
Whatever you do, never let go 'til you're done.

I was fightin' as anyone,
I was twisted around.
I was broke just as anyone,
On the way - way down.

Never ever settle for less,
Raise you hand it's to kill or to bless.
Never ever settle for less,
Who needs the crown when you're head on the ground.
Let me out, I'm just makin' a mess...

Chip on my shoulder and look on my face,
Changin' my life on the fly.
Too late to make it and too late to stop,
Too late to figure out why.

I was fightin' as anyone,
I was twisted around.
I was broke just as anyone,
On the way - way down.

Never ever settle for less,
Raise you hand it's to kill or to bless.
Never ever settle for less,
Who needs the crown when you're head on the ground.
Let me out, I'm just makin' a mess...

The wind of sadness can shade the heart of gold.
I'm gonna leave it all behind.
I'm prayin' for a break - if I could face the world,
Without sadness in my mind...

Never ever settle for less,
Raise you hand it's to kill or to bless.
Never ever settle for less,
Who needs the crown when you're head on the ground.
Let me out, I'm just makin' a mess...
