Give it up just let it flow,
Keller's runnin' TV show.
Razor blade in action - everything is "live",
Scandal makes a paper "hot",
You may like it, you may not.
Marriage, rape, divorce, somebody's butchered wife.

Empire rise, they're built on lies,
In the children's eyes, I'll never...

Give it up, never ever give it up!

Little kid some place abroad,
Shot dead by the terror squad.
Only one? Just not enough to ring a bell!
TV preacher will love to tell you,
Pay a dime and God's for sale.
Don't get scared it's just another day in hell.

Empire's turn, they're built burn,
We'll never learn - I'll never...

Give it up, never ever give it up!
