Time, how long it's gonna lasts?
I'm livin in the past and runnin' out of time...

I keep runnin' around in circles,
I keep walkin' in the dark,
I keep tryin' to wash away the devil's mark!

I have my reasons to remember,
I have my reasons to forget,
I have my reasons to reject a safety net!

'Cos we'll all fall down on the cold, cold ground,
Don't you turn around - who's crime?

Time - I'm runnin' out of
Time - I've wasted all my
Time - I'm gonna need some
I'm runnin out of time!

I'm gonna finish off confusions,
I'm gonna leave it all for good,
I'm gonna quit on being' left misunderstood!

I'm gettin' rid of my illusions,
I'm gettin' tired of the crowd,
I'm gettin' out, I'm checkin' out,
I'm gettin' out!

'Cos we'll all fall down on the cold, cold ground,
Don't you turn around - who's crime?

Time - I'm runnin' out of
Time - I've wasted all my
Time - I'm gonna need some
I'm runnin' out of time!
