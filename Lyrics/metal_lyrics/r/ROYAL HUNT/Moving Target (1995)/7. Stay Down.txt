They have promised you the world,
And left you on your own,
Now all your life is built on fear,
Lies and hearts of stone.

And now I realize,
The promises were lies,
I'm walkin' endless miles,
I can't believe my eyes...

Are you fightin' for survive?
It's a lousy way to live.
A wish to make it through the night,
And nothin' else to give,

And now I realize,
The promises were lies,
I'm walkin' endless miles,
I can't believe my eyes...

Stay down low down,
Nobody cares if you're still hangin' around.
Stay down low down,
Who will you run to and who will you pray to,
When you're down on the ground...

Who will help you when  you fall,
Who will pull you up?
When you're prayin' for revenge,
Who will make you stop?

Stay down low down,
Nobody cares if you're still hangin' around.
Stay down low down,
Who will you run to and who will you pray to,
When you're down on the ground...

And now I realize,
The promises were lies,
I'm walkin' endless miles,
I can't believe my eyes...
