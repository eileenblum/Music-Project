You shut the door, you let me hang myself,
You've turned your back on me and now I'm gone.
So listen, ask yourself, can you undo what I've done?

You told me lies you've tried to put me down,
You showed me hell because that's where I've been,
I hope you happy now - I didn't like what I have seen...

Yeah, I do appreciate,
You're the one who gave this kind of fate to me,
But I can't wait until...

Time will tell - you're on your feet so far, but only
Time will tell - how long it's gonna lasts!
Time will tell - you're reachin' for the star, but only
Time will tell - if shadows from the past will bring you 
hell...

You just can't get enough, you broke my heart,
You're so rich now you can ski uphill.
Tear my life apart - you never ask me how I feel...

Life is going down the drain,
You got pleasure, all I got is pain - you're driving me 
insane!

Rest your weary head my son, all your troubles just begun.
Close your eyes, unchain your heart - help you God...
Full of hate as you have always been,
Drop your gun 'cos anger is the sin...
