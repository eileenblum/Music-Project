Look, broken moon shines through the clouds so restless,
Cold, even light just touched the hill of sadness.
Flash back - it all happens again,
Traces of tears will be washed off by rain...

Over, it's over, look I'm goin' down,
But you can't see anything.
Over, it's over, King is Dead - Long Live the King!

I'm on the same path to the cross as the last time,
They'll crucify me once again - you've broken my heart,
As you did it before.
Judas I'll wait, come and knock at my door.

Over, it's over, they just shut me down,
And you won't do anything...
Over, it's over, King is Dead - Long Live the King!
