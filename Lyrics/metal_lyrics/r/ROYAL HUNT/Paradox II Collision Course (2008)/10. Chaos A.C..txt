The chaos keeps on raging, still hungry for a thrill -
whatever script we're staging:
holy book's kept close to the gun - now fire at will
The cast is ever changing to reinvent its skill -
no soppy happy ending:
in the name of some God - just fire at will

Rest your weary head my son, all your trouble's just begun... it's still
a long way home.

"Lord grant me strength to accept those things I can not change"
St. Francis
