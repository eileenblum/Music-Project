I thought that the madness was over as echo of a last bloody war
was fading away, but discovered a new breed of fools on the way
to steal their fair share of headlines... in "Whatever Times"
over and over

For some unexplainable reason there's always a few of a kind
who'd put their beliefs in a prison of highly deranged, vicious minds
Praying away for a bigger and stronger empire to surface the Earth,
coming back from the ashes to set every nation on fire...
Blood's on your face and all over the place as

you're hiding, you're lying - disgrace is worse than dying,
keep falling much lower 'cause it's so far from over
The war cry's returning (remaining bridges're burning)
you'll hear it - we mean it - so clear and loud:
"Blood in blood out!"

Now the war's moving into your home...heat's getting closer

Who could have believed or expected, who knew all along that today
Dark Ages will be resurrected - now look at yourself, go on!
Wait for Messiah to save you and show what to do, follow
millions of desperate rebels without a clue what are they fighting for,
asking Almighty for.

See it coming... blood in blood out.
