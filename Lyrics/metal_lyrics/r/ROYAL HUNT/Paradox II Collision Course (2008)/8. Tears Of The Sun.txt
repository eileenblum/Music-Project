While all of us walk alone... no help, we're on our own
The end - as they say - is a heartbeat away,
so give me a reason to stay...

Roaring silence...you walk down the street in Belfast -
think of it as every step that you take is your last...
It could be, easily, just keep on watching your back:
highest alert all the time - you are under attack,
better keep moving

Rain's falling down on me as trying to make me see
the scars of this town. Just leave it and run
surrounded by tears of the sun

Shot in the distance - and fear bounces back from these walls,
someone ahead of you screams and suddenly falls
Killings are random but there is a reason behind
Retaliation? Well, half of the nation went blind

while children in church are singing so peaceful,
bells are ringing a lovely tune... I'm going mad!

Rain's falling down on me as trying to make me see
the scars of this town. Just leave it and run
surrounded by tears of the sun
Rain's falling down on me... I wish it will let me be
One day I'll be gone but whatever I've done's
remembered by tears of the sun

You can't ask for forgiveness from Heaven
'til you've asked for forgiveness from men...
In this town it will take you forever, so who gives a damn?
