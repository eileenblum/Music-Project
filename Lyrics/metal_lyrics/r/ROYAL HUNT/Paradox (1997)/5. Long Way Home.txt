When the nigh is calling I shut another door,
Celebrating loneliness I never knows before.
I miss a place to call my own - it's a long way home...
In my open prison cell just everything I've got,
Disappeared in silence every word I've said is not.
And now I'm lost and all alone - it's a long way home...

It's a long road, but ever longer to the blind,
And I've been searchin' way too long.
Still I can't find the place where I belong
It's a long way home...

You see me suffer on my knees - I wish I knew just what it means.
You watch us come, you watch us go - he tells me something I don't know.
You've set me up, I thought I'm free - just tell me where you wanna be?
Another step and I'll be gone - what you will do can be undone...
