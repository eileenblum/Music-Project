I don't believe in tomorrows - you'll never change my point of view,
My fears and sorrows runnin' down my spine, I tell you.
I watch my people dyin', I watch them go - I don't know where...
The skies are crying, washing out their blood into the

The rivers runs away,
Turns red and looks like vein.
The rivers shows the way,
Away from bloody rain.

The Gods of war are callin', I hear their voices in the wind.
The sun is falling - another day is gone, another sin.
I see the star of sadness is touchin' bodies on the ground.
Somebody's madness just took my life and turned it upside down.

The river of pain - we're all betrayed and sold,
The river of pain - my land is dead and cold.
The river of pain - when I close my eyes,
The river of pain - spirit never dies...

My time has come I'm leaving, my mind is tearin' me apart.
I wanna die believing in common sense and wisdom of my heart...
