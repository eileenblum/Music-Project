Facing every window, 'round every corner
TV eyes are up and running, no one's gonna tell
why nothing's ever sacred, nothing's ever private
Everything's exposed and all our values shot to hell

But no one seems to know which reality to show
Hunted, we're hunted down

Catching any moment, taping every sentence,
watching from above - some kind of legalized abuse
Any given second, every single minute
analyzed, categorized for any later use

Still no one seems to know which reality to show
Hunted, we're hunted down
Hunted, I'm hunted down
