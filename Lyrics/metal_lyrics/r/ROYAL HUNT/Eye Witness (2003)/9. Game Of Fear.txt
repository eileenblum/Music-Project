Another faceless man in grey set house on fire -
and he stayed 'til every single flat was burning
This guy just launched his own attack -
shot older woman in the back
He's not a pro, but he is learning
This terror lives on our fears - and it's growing
Playing the game of fear -
wild on the streets letting blindfolded steer
Playing the game of fear -
run for your life 'cause your last day is near... Just waiting
Somebody's in the mood for war
which non of us have seen before
The rules are simple - random killing
Without a clue, without the cause -
we live in freedom, and because
that simple fact just hurt their feelings
Face this human waste, change the pace - 'cause it's growing
Playing the game of fear -
wild on the streets letting blindfolded steer
Playing the game of fear - sneaking behind like a snake.
Disappear! Playing the game of fear -
feeding the war, and you're making it clear
Playing the game of fear -
run for your life 'cause your last day is near
