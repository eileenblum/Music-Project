Empires were built through the centuries drones
on somebody's flesh and on somebody's bones
Creating our needs while dumping what's left -
now nature's dying, it's choking to death
Tell me for how long

We're burning the sun, we'll tear down the mountain
and drink out the river 'til river'll run dry
We'll shoot at the stars, or torture the ocean
'til Earth will stop breathing and wind wouldn't fly
We've buried ourselves by building a tower
to climb up to heaven - we're falling to hell
We're burning the sun, we'll tear down this mountain
and drink out the river until the river runs dry

As we're gaining strength - the world's getting week
We're blowing away the remains as we speak
Another decade, we're pushing some more
Destroying the walls while we're closing the door

When the forest turns to desert, when the river turns to mud,
When the air becomes a treasure - who allowed to tear it all apart?
