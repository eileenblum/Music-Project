Kind of faraway country,million miles from our homes
Have no reason to be here - now, see how it goes
Sharing "wisdom and progress", but we're armed to the teeth
escalating this madness - tell me, why can't we leave?

'Cause we can't let go - no, we can't let go
can't let go - we just can't let go - ever

Every inch of their country we're proclaiming as free
'til the last of the natives have no places to be
Educating with fire, liberating with steel
pushing repatriation - do we care how they feel?

'Cause we can't let go - no, we can't let go
can't let go - we just can't let go
We're taking over 'cause we
can't let go - and never ever will
Can't let go - it;s just the way we're build
The only thing we know - until the final toll -
we'll never ever let go
