[Japanese edition bonus track]

Once I had a Dream
Like a voice in the distance
Call out from the night
asking me for the answer

Somewhere in the dark
is a place without dying
peace the eternal peace
that we see it is waiting

Truth show me your face
and who you are
I can't be dreaming on
I'm wide awake open the door
Day is dawning now [x4]
