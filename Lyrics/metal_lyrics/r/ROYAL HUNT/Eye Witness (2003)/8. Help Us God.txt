A week to build the world - and now you're leaving
Do you ever see the cards you're dealing?

Many times your ways are strange'n shallow
Makes me wonder if I'll ever follow you
Take that kid I've seen around, crying
Everytime I passed him felt like dying - but just a little bit
Trying to understand by whom he's hit

Look like kid;s been taking quite a beating,
maybe loved the hand that did the hitting
I'm sure the guy's so proud to be a father
and his son will live just like another one
Growing up in jail. Father,can you alert us when we fail?

Help us, God - help us find the way, save us
from ourselves - take that pain away.
Listen - help us, God

See, he never will forgive the hitter
Life just slipped him a pill - and it tastes bitter
Growing up in middles vino's talking
he will be convinced that he is walking
while crawling on his knees, hoping this is the only way it is

So help us, God - help us find the way, save us
from ourselves - take this pain away, take us
to your heart - guide us all the way, teach us
Help us, God - help us find the way, save us
Help us, God
