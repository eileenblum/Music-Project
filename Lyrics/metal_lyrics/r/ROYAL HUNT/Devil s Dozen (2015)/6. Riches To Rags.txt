I've been around way too long to care or wonder
Why am I bound to witness all this mess? I guess
Wherever you go â it's the same, so I'm
Sure it's a name of the game
If you're quick on a trigger, richer and bigger
You'd stay a bit longer, get a bit stronger, hope for the best. It's alright

You can save every dime, hide or bury it all
But the higher you climbâ¦ even harder you fall
Carry on, don't be shy â keep on stuffing these bags
In a blink of an eye you'll go from riches to rags
Don't forget! Then againâ¦ go ahead
Carry on, don't be shy â keep on packing these bags
In a blink of an eye you'll go from riches to rags

I've been around way too long to care or wonder
Who's going down, who's to blame or whyâ¦ oh my
Do as you pleased but watch out
Here's what I'm talking about
Hurry, pick up your numberâ¦ who's going under?
Look at these faces, glittering placesâ¦
There is no easy way out
