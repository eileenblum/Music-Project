Sometimes I feel so lost, so off the track
And yes, I know â there is no going back
Trying to remember that point of no return
When all those bridges burned

Somewhere in time. I am a little kid
No second thoughts, no matter what you did
There's always someone to catch you if you'd fall
I know you're nearby, can you hear my call

If I could hit rewind; re-watch, relive, refineâ¦
Still waiting for a sign, another chance to put the record straight
'Cuz I'm no longer scared to tell how much I cared
These words I should have sharedâ¦
I know it's way too late

Years passing by yet this kind of wound never heal
Words can't describe the pain or the way I feel

I know I've never been a perfect son
Forgive me for my "living on the run"â¦
It's the same old story, but now we're worlds apart
I'm so sorry if I broke your heart
