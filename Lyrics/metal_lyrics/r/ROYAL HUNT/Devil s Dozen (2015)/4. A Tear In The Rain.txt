Yesterday is over: dead and gone,
Cold and grey â so what're you dwelling on?
A fortune made and lost? Just counting up the cost?
You better keep your fingers crossed

Time has come for us to count the score:
Tell me what have you been fighting for?
A little bit of fame? Seems like a modest claimâ¦
But no one will ever know your name

Storm is coming today, well â get running
Off you go ball and chain
Keep on steering away, disappearing
Like a tear in the rain
Life's been wasted â so far, can you face it?
Does it drive you insane?
Scary feeling: you are disappearing
Like a tear in the rain

A little bit of fame? Believe me,
There's no shame
Seems like a modest claimâ¦ they
Always sound the same
But no one will ever know your name
