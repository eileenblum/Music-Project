On the highest of mountains
On the shiniest throne
In a circle of fountains
Out of reach and all alone
Every move is majestic
Every wordâs pure gold
As a simple domestic
Iâm all ears, lo and behold

How do you â know whatâs wrong and know whatâs right?
How do you â let me ask you, inside

How do you know whatâs wrong, whatâs right?
How do you see the other side?
How do you feel night after night
Watching the darkness grow?
How do you know if itâs alright
Judging without a second sight?
How can you live in black and white?
How do you know? How do you know?

After years of rejection
You are finally there
Closest thing to perfection
Heart of stone, an empty stare
In the kingdom of madness
Youâre an essence of good
Yet youâre drowning in sadness
A lonely soul misunderstood

How do you â know whatâs wrong and know whatâs right?
How do you â let me ask you, inside

How do you know whatâs wrong, whatâs right?
How do you see the other side?
How do you feel night after night
Watching the darkness grow?
How do you know if itâs alright
Judging without a second sight?
How can you live in black and white?
How do you know? How do you know? How do you know?

How do you know whatâs wrong, whatâs right?
How do you see the other side?
How do you feel night after night
Watching the darkness grow?
How do you know if itâs alright
Judging without a second sight?
How can you live in black and white?
How do you know? How do you know?

How do you know?
How do you feel?
How do you know if itâs alright
Judging without?
How can you live in black and white?
How do you know? How do you know?
