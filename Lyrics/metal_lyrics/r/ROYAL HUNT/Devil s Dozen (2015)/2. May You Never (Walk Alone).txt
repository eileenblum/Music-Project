I have been stuck behind this wobbly desk for hours now. I don't know how and where to start â so pointless, so grotesque: a dire plight but what to write about you but "I miss yo so"? My mind is emptyâ¦ here I go

May you never walk alone, forgotten down the road â so lonely,
The one and only, far away
You're never on your own, I'm crying out "so long" forever
And "may you never walk alone"

As twilight turned to dawn an empty page was all I had, I'm going mad
What to remember â neither saint nor sageâ¦ or just like me â so can't you see
Now as your image fades away the only thing that's left to sayâ¦ I'm going

May you never walk alone, forgotten down the road â so lonely,
The one and only, far away
You're never on your own, who cares about what they're saying?
Just hear me praying, listen

May you never be afraid. It doesn't matter where you're going without knowing either way
You'll never be betrayed. I'm crying out "so long" forever
And may you never walk alone

I have been stuck behind this wobbly desk for hours now. I don't know how
And where to start â so pointless, so grotesque: a dire plight but what to write?
It's like every word's been said before so I can't do it anymore
