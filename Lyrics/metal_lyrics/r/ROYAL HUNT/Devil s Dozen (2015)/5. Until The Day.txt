Another year has passed, another
Wrinkled page's been turned
God knows it's not the last; I've learnedâ¦
I've learned to hold on tight and
How to make it on my own
But in the middle of the night I'd moan
I'll wait, wait until the day my
Bleeding heart stops, but now I pray
"Is anybody up there? So guide me with thy grace"
I'm getting readyâ¦ just to see your face
How come: you slipped away and
Yet it feelsâ¦ you're everywhere
I miss you every single day, I swear
I'll wait, wait until the day my
Bleeding heart stops, but now I pray
"Is anybody up there? So guide me with thy grace"
I'm getting readyâ¦ just to see your face
I'll live, live until the sign shows at
My door, all the stars aligned
Then I'll know what's comingâ¦ a little price to pay
So I'll be waiting right until the day,
Right until that day

Another year has passed, another

How do I know it's not the last; I've learned, by now â I've learned
