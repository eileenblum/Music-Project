[August 2026 - There Will Come Soft Rains]

We`re here to simplify your life forever man,you just don`t 
know
how good your life is gonna be
Take every aspect of your day-computerize the place you stay
Just leave the thinking up to me

Technology within the walls around you
You never knew how much you needed our protection

1 too many reasons 2 the changing seasons 3 the time has 
come to realize
3 so sad and lonely 2 you are the only 1 countdown to World 
Wide War

"We`ve come to take away your brain and put computers in 
it`s place"
You`ll never hear these words from me
Just smile and sign away your life and kiss your 
holographic wife
You never dreamed it`d be so good

Technology will wrap it`s arms around you
Just let our main frame show you love and affection

"Oh no,you`re never gonna change the way I live my life"
We`ll insert a chip in the place where your heart used to 
be   
"Oh no,you`re never gonna take my heart ,my soul"
Tell your soul - we control these things.
