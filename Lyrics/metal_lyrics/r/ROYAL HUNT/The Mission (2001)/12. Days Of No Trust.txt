[April 2026 - The Long Years]

Dark and silent world just felt asleep.Moon is staring from 
the deep,
wise and quiet sky above my head.Stars are fading-
do they regret hopes and fears that they reflected back to 
us through all those years? 

Time is standing still until the dawn.Living daylights will 
force it on the run
Game is over.No more peace of mind `til the night`ll come 
crawling,so I could find you
And then I could dive into the darkness full of memories-
again

If I`m closing my eyes to remember the day when the wind of 
eternity took you away
Many colors of pain in my heart - I can see,it`s all coming 
back to me
As the merciless sun melts the rest of the night,chasing 
vision of you through the ocean of light
slowly passing me by,turning wishes to dust - I`m living 
the days of no trust
