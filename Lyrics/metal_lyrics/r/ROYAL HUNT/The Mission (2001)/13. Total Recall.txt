[November 2005 - The Off Season]

We gave this pain to the world which we can`t understand
Blood disappears like the raindrops when hitting the sand
Eye on the Bible and hand on the gun-wandering comes to an 
end
Fight in the name of your god and his son-wait for the 
final command:

Total Recall - we saw it all,we took it all protected by 
the law
Total Recall -we torched another life we`ll never know
Total Recall - we shot it all we burned it all and now it`s 
time to go

Wish for redemtion and peace`s never crossing our mind
Blood on the bricks - that`s all that we`re leaving behind
Pictures of home disappearing in flames.Mission`s complete
In the end there`s nothing to lose,we`re ready to go-
wait for the final command - "Total Recall".
