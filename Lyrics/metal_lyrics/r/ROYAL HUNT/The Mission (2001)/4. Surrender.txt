[April 2000 - The Third Expedition]

"Open up the window"-said the light-"See into another 
world"
Is it only a dream?
Voices sound familiar in the night...could this be reality?
Or is it all in my mind?

Why me? Could I just be "The One"? Or have I come undone?

Head in through the door and start to run straight into 
another life,
dear old friends beside me
Never had a dream that`s so surreal-could this be the end 
for me?
Am I losing my mind?

Still...I just stay.Can`t run away-there`s a price to pay

Look into the sky thru the naked eye,in a flash of light - 
surrender
Losing everything,soldiers march and sing.Distant bells 
will ring - surrender
Let the children cry-earth will breath a sigh in a blaze of 
light - surrender
They`re taking everything.Demons dance and sing when the 
chimes will ring
The end is here

"Open up the window"-said the light-"Welcome to another 
world"
Dear old friends beside me
Voices so familiar every night-could this be reality?
Am I losing my mind?
