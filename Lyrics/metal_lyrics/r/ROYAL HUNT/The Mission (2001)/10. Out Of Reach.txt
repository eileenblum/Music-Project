[August 2002 - Night Meeting]

On the road of disillusions,in the land of broken dreams
From the city of confusions,scared to death I`m running-or 
so it seems
In the sun my heart is freezing,mind is boiling in the shade
And a mean mirage is teasing `cross the endless 
desert,that`s due to fade out
by now,but still around.Makes me wonder why we`re here
on this unholy ground

I feel you`re near,I hear your call,I see your shadow on 
the wall
I know you`re here day after day,but everytime-one step away
Divided only in our mind,why can`t we see another`s side?
Out of my fear I`ll build the bridge - you are so close but 
out of reach

I can`t tell you where I`m going,I can`t tell you where 
I`ve been
I just run without knowing what I did,you know what,just 
what I mean?
I gave up on understanding,I let go the foolish pride
Won`t expect a happy ending-not this time,I know it-but 
it`s alright
`coz me and you`re the same - even 1000 years apart    
I got someone to blame

We were looking at each other while the ones we`ll never 
see,
only feel,have slowly passed you...and me.
