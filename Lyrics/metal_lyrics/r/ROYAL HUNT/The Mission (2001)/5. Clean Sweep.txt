[April 2005 - Usher II]

Scrach the surface of your fear,take a look inside it
Books on fire everywhere.Our work? You got it right
We`d never missed a chance to destroy whatever comes our way
So,day by day-it goes on forever
Burning the age page after page - leaving the stage to you

No excuses,no regrets-wiping out the magic
Things we`d never understand`re dying `til the tragic,
final point of no return.You can see it coming in the dark
Behind your back step by step it`s climbing
up to the top of your world...I`m waiting
