[June 2001 - And The Moon Be Still As Bright]

I don`t need a reason-being who I am-I don`t need a reason 
to try to understand
Why we even bother,in the noman`s land,killing one 
another.For what? Some rocks and sand?

But I`ll stop that flow - I won`t let it go

Everybody`s losing for a little gain.Everybody`s choosing 
to walk away in pain
Wake me up,I`m dreaming - world`s gone insane
I would give my life away, but who can stop the rain?

I swear I`ll stop these bullets in the air,I swear I won`t 
walk away
My share`s to be a tougher man to scare,my share-right to 
the dawn of Judgement Day
I know-it`s hard to move against the flow,I know-but I 
won`t hide away
I`ll go `cross the desert,through the snow,I`ll go into the 
light of Judgement Day

I know this day will come and count the score.

Waiting for tomorrow I`d close my eyes and pray:"Take my 
load of sorrow and all my fears away"
In a scary fashion nightmare reappears-I can feel it coming 
and waking up in tears

Don`t tell me lies,`coz everybody knows what`s goin`on 
We`re almost proud that our race is bad right to the bone
Can`t you see-we`re looking again,high and low,
for the world to destroy - like our own?
