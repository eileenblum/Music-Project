Hear me out: the game is over, itâs enough
Talk about broken promisesâ¦ so tough
All these days been spend on piling up regrets
Every phrase just seems as pointless as it gets

Running out of tears (after all these years)
Moving on against the flow
Running out of tears my hopes and all my fears
Now time has come to let you go
Running out of tears (as the smokescreen clears)
Whoâs to blame? I guess you know
Running out of tears, my heartache disappears
Now time has come to let you go

I'm running out of tears

Keep it allâ¦ and most of all those sleepless nights
Itâs your call, Iâve had enough of endless fights
Close the door cause this is never gonna be
As before, so you can through away the key

Running out of tears (after all these years)
Moving on against the flow
Running out of tears my hopes and all my fears
Now time has come to let you go
Running out of tears (as the smokescreen clears)
Whoâs to blame? I guess you know
Running out of tears, my heartache disappears
Now time has come to let you go

When the night is getting colder I hear your voice, but so unclear
Looking back over my shoulder and watch you slowly disappear

Running out of tears (after all these years)
Moving on against the flow
Running out of tears my hopes and all my fears
Now time has come to let you go
Running out of tears (as the smokescreen clears)
Whoâs to blame? I guess you know
Running out of tears, my heartache disappears
Now time has come to let you go

Running out of tears (after all these years)
Running out of tears and hopes and all my fears
Now time has come to let you go
Running out of tears (as the smokescreen clears)
Whoâs to blame? I guess you know
Running out of tears, my heartache disappears
Now time has come to let you go

I'm running out of tears
I'm running out of tears
I'm running out of tears
