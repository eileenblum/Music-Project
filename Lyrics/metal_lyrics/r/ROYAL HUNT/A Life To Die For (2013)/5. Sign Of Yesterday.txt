Weâre looking for changes but what if thereâs nothing more to find?
Surrounded by strangers while all what weâve had is left behind
What are you looking for? Still afraid?
Not anymore

No reason, no goodbye â just walk awayâ¦ I see it as a sign of yesterday
As right behind us tables turning, bridges burning â look another way
So little to forgive, so much to sayâ¦ just leave behind this sign of yesterday
Above it all the sun is blazing while erasing every single sign of yesterday

One way or another we seem to forgive and then â forget
Iâm looking no further for ways to returnâ¦
At least not yet
What are waiting for?
Go ahead and close the door

No reason, no goodbye â just walk awayâ¦ I see it as a sign of yesterday
As right behind us tables turning, bridges burning â look another way
So little to forgive, so much to sayâ¦ just leave behind this sign of yesterday
Above it all the sun is blazing while erasing every single sign of yesterday

No reason, no goodbye â just walk awayâ¦ I see it as a sign of yesterday
As right behind us tables turning, bridges burning â look another way
So little to forgive, so much to sayâ¦ just leave behind this sign of yesterday
Above it all the sun is blazing while erasing every single sign of yesterday

No reason, no goodbye â just walk awayâ¦ I see it as a sign of yesterday
As right behind us tables turning, bridges burning â look another way
So little to forgive, so much to sayâ¦ just leave behind this sign of yesterday
Above it all the sun is blazing while erasing every single sign of yesterday

Yesterday
