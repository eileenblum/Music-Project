Now and then I look upon the skyâ¦ but why?
Yet another day is passing byâ¦ oh my
Not so sure what I am waiting for at your door
For a little faith in you? No more!

Have you ever showed a single signâ¦ divine
Have you ever heard a word of mineâ¦ of mine
Will you ever look me in the eye and lie?
Will you share a tear the day I die? I die?

Can you try and tell me why from the sky
Your hell comes down from heaven
Everyday an endless playâs staged away
While hell comes down from heaven
Go insane and spread the pain: let it rain
Let hell come down from heaven
Can you try? And tell me why
From the sky when hell comes down from heaven
Hell, your hell comes down from heaven

You created lifeâ¦ itâs such a mess, I guess
It never bothered you, could not care lessâ¦ oh yes
I give up â you let me downâ¦ agree? You see
Thanks a lot, your hell comes down on me

Can you try and tell me why from the sky
Your hell comes down from heaven
Everyday an endless playâs staged away
While hell comes down from heaven
Go insane and spread the pain: let it rain
Let hell come down from heaven
Can you try? And tell me why
Your hell comes down from heaven

Again and againâ¦ a part of your plan: again and again
Your hell comes down from heaven

Hell comes down from heaven
