How many times you felt so weak you let them keep you down?
How many times your simple hopes and dreams got kicked around?
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

How many times you closed your eyes and said, "I'll get there soon."?
How many times you didn't dare... kept howling at the moon
Throughout entire night
Throughout entire night

But what if there's a way to make it all undone?
A second chance to go back where it all begun?

If you could have a life to die for
In front of you, behind that next door
No effort and no fight
This one you've won
Goes on, and on, and on
If you could have a life to die for
I wish you'd use it right
And no more regrets
Because tonight the game is on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on,

So many times you saw the best in life just pass you by
So many times you walked away without asking why
How could you let it go?
How could you let it go?

So many times you really wanted to but couldn't reach
So close yet far away... enough to hear the choir preach,
"You're never gonna win,
"You're never gonna win."

But what if there's a way to make it all undone?
A second chance to go back where it all begun?

If you could have a life to die for
In front of you, behind that next door
No effort and no fight
This one you've won
Goes on, and on, and on
If you could have a life to die for
I wish you'd use it right
And no more regrets
Because tonight the game is on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on,

You're in for a minute
So take it or leave it.

But what if there's a way to make it all undone?

Goes on, and on, and on

I wish you'd use it right
And no more regrets

And on, and on, and on, and on, and on,

[Fading:]
If you could have a life to die for
In front of you, behind that next door
No effort and no fight
This one you've won
Goes on, and on, and on
If you could have a life to die for
I wish you'd use it right
And no more regrets
Because tonight the game is on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on,
