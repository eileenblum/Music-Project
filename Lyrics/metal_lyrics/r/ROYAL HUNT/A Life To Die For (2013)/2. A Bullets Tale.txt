Now youâre trying so hard to deceive me
But whatever you do â believe me:
You can run but youâll never leave meâ¦ itâs a bulletâs, bullet's, bullet's tale

Always dreamed to be The One but thousands just like me
Were created for this gun. So how itâs gonna be?
Enjoy the view until the day we meet
Iâm chasing you

Way too small to bear a name but thought it could be yours
Doesnât matter, just the same â no shortages in wars
So round and round we go until the day
Youâre going down

Now youâre trying so hard to deceive me
But whatever you do â believe me:
You can run but youâll never leave meâ¦ itâs a bulletâs tale
Getting closerâ¦ just to remind you:
Be aware, I am right behind you
Go wherever you go â Iâll find youâ¦ itâs a bulletâs tale

A bullet's tale

A bit of led, a bit of brass, some magic stuff inside
Here I go â a final blast â a short yet pleasant ride
No cheers, no prizeâ¦ just take your final breath
And close your eyes

Now youâre trying so hard to deceive me
But whatever you do â believe me:
You can run but youâll never leave meâ¦ itâs a bulletâs tale
Getting closerâ¦ just to remind you:
Be aware, I am right behind you
Go wherever you go â Iâll find youâ¦ itâs a bulletâs tale

No cheers, no prizeâ¦ just take your final breath
And close your eyes

Now youâre trying so hard to deceive me
But whatever you do â believe me:
You can run but youâll never leave meâ¦ itâs a bulletâs tale
Getting closerâ¦ just to remind you:
Be aware, I am right behind you
Go wherever you go â Iâll find youâ¦ itâs a bulletâs tale

Bullet's tale, a bullet's tale
