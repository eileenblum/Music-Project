So many times before I felt the world came crushing down
And all around me slowly melt across entire town
Right there youâd kneel and pray

To someone up there with a crownâ¦ or wish yourself away - away

While growing up I quickly learned â
You always hold your ground
And never leave a stone unturned â you better stick around
We're born and die alone, so learn to make it on your own, on your own

I wonât trust, wonât fear, wonât beg when Iâm telling you:
At last â forgive, forget â the words which I knew
As they were branded on my mind
But now itâs all what I can find:
Wonât trust, wonât fear, wonât beg for the rest of my life
I wonât trust, wonât fear â that pageâs remaining unsigned

the page's remaining unsigned

Whoever tells you to retreat is messing with your head
The fightâs not over when youâre beat but only when youâre dead
Donât let them shred your life to bits
By now you should have learned
Who never wins? The one who quits at the point of no return

I wonât trust, wonât fear, wonât beg Iâm telling you:
At last â forgive, forget â the words which I knew
As they were branded on my mind
But now itâs all what I can find:
Wonât trust, wonât fear, wonât beg for the rest of my life
I wonât trust, wonât fear â that pageâs remaining unsigned
