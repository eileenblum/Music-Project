How many minutes left to live? How many breaths to take?
How much to keep, how much to give, how long youâd stay awake?

I do believe that once youâre gone â
There is no coming back
No second chance an no re-run â
A simple fade to black
You tell me â is it so, or thereâs something I should know?

One minute left to live so where do you go
Regretting what youâve done and everything youâve ever said?
One minute left to live and â
What do you know? â
I wouldnât change a thing
I just keep on riding straight ahead

Iâve been around, Iâve seen it all â no pity, no remorse
I did my bit and fought the wall, kicked down a lot of doors
So if the end is near â just bring it on I have no fear

One minute left to live so where do you go
Regretting what youâve done and everything youâve ever said?
One minute left to live and â
What do you know? â
I wouldnât change a thing
I just keep on riding straight ahead

One minute left to live but what do you care?
Regretting that youâve done and everything youâve ever said?
One minute left to live â regardless, I swear
I wouldnât change a thing, just keep on riding straight ahead

One minute left to live so where do you go
Regretting what youâve done and everything youâve ever said?
One minute left to live and â
What do you know? â
I wouldnât change a thing
I just keep on riding straight ahead

One minute left to live but what do you care?
Regretting that youâve done and everything youâve ever said?
One minute left to live â regardless, I swear
I wouldnât change a thing, just keep on riding straight ahead
