Tell me how do you sleep at night and help me
To understand your twisted mind:
Living off someone's misery and giving
Away the pain... and feeling fine?
You're waiting for a miracle to wash your sins away?
Sorry, but I can't change your pity story...
There's nothing I can do at all
Too late, the only thing that's left is to wait
A little for that final call... your fall
Still praying for a miracle to wash your sins away?

Whoever you betrayed, whatever price you've paid -
It all'll be washed away... a hard rain is coming
Whoever's on the run, whatever's left undone -
It will be over soon... a hard rain is coming

No sorrow and no fear and all your sins will disappear
Whoever's path you've crossed, whatever's hurting most -
It all'll be washed away... a hard rain is coming

You're on your own, whatever you have done -
It's time to pay
Just walk alone and settle all your depths -
Here, right away
A heart of stone is breaking quickly... man,
It's not your day
But either way - you can't stop dreaming,
Well... keep on dreaming
