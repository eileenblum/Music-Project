Another day is passing by
But I'm still standing; you might ask me "Why?
How many heartaches can you take?
How many wounds until your heart will break?"
I'm moving on, I'm pushing on
Have no direction, but I'm going strong
Just like a ship without a sail
With a hurricane right on its tail
I can't allow myself to fail

One more day - if you can give me one more day
Just one day - before you leave me - one more day.

The ones I met, the ones I lost
Became a single - kind of scary - ghost
It keeps on knocking on my door
I tell you. I can't take it anymore
Entire life - a bloody mess
But at this point I couldn't care less
Whoever stayed, whoever fled:
You sort it out while I'm - instead -
Will keep on moving straight ahead

The race is on... I kneel and pray:
"Just give me one more day."
