Can't go on without knowing
How to make it through another day
Can't be blind yet keep on going
Tell me why you've left me here to stay
All alone... on my own... it goes on and on

Lift me up and bring me straight to heaven
Burn my past and everything I've done
Take my sins - I piled them up, all seven
... now I see - my guarding angel's gone

I don't know where did you come from.
Fallen angel from a dream... you see:
I don't care, and if it's such a turn on -
Tear apart the very rest of me
Lose the key... let it be... set me free

However... forever... my guarding angel's gone
