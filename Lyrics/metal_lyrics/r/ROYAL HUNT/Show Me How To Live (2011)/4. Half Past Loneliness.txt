Life's not the same without you
All this time around you's been a dream.
And you'd never guess:
Still I can hear your laughter even ages after
You've been gone. and I confess:

Half past loneliness... I'm waiting for
All my dreams to show up at my door
The clock has stopped at
Half past loneliness... I'm wide awake
How much more a wounded,
Broken heart can take?

Wait just a minute longer -
Pain is getting stronger every time
You're on my mind
Now all I do is trying to forget, denying
A sense of time of any kind
