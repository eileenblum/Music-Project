Hey, how've you been? Dreamed 'bout you lately...
Whom have you seen? Miss you all... miss you greatly
I saw you smile... when? Last december?
Yeah, it's been awhile since you left. I remember
Pain... as we're saying goodbye... pouring rain
Me? I don't know... lost all my senses -
Facing the war makes you strong yet defenseless
Hell's all around, all that dying and screaming
Where's no way out - you are next... so I'm dreaming

I close my eyes and hear: "Another man down."
But far behind me - I'm flying -
Somebody else's body hits the ground I'm moving away... or just trying?

I spread my wings and hear: "Another man down." more screaming, cursing and
Crying
Somebody else's body hitting the ground... I open my eyes... and I am this
"another man down"

Hey, it's getting colder... oh no, time to go
