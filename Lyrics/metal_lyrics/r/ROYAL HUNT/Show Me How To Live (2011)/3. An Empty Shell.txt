I saw you all around the place
a sure and solid bet:
no heart, no soul... a common face,
as cold as you can get

Without a clue, without a cause
it's in your blood, cuz otherwise you're just an
empty shell

Behind that almost perfect mask
no feelings, no remorse
Remember: time is running fast,
the sound of closing doors
is getting louder every day.
you never had a real name, you're just an
empty shell

The end is near so unavoidable and rude
I guess you're dwelling on the past
Whatever happens here
is easy understood:
you're never meant to last, you're never gonna last.

Without a clue, without a cause
it's in your blood, cuz otherwise you're just an
empty shell
