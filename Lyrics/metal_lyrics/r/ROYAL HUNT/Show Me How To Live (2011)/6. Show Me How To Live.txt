In the midnight hour I'm sitting by the fire,
Running out of memories to burn
Look, I'm in your power - beaten down and tired,
Waiting for the last thing left to learn

So show me how to live

You can leave me waiting by this dying fire...
Just a single question, anyway:
What's the point - creating life but no desire
To hang on and face another day?

So show me how to live, cuz all I do is trying
To honestly forgive, but patience's running dry
So show me how to live: you can't keep denying
What all you've had to give - a thousand ways to die
Now show me how to live
