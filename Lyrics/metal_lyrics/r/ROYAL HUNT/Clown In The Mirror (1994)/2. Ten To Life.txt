Sun's comin' up and news starts spreadin' around.
Yesterday's gone, and you man I had to gun down, down, down.

Hey mister "know it all" - what the hell you gonna do?
When a jerk like that takes a swing at you.
You'll run for cover, you'll spit him in the eye,
You'll pull the trigger! - don't tell me lies...

My mother said straight way's build on pride, yeah.
If wishes were horses then beggars would be ride, and ride, ride, ride.
Hey mister "know it all" - what the hell you gonna do?

When a jerk like that takes a swing at you.
You'll call it even, you'll desperately weep,
You'll pull the trigger! - and nail that creep...

Ten to life - now the crime is done.
So long - I'm too far gone...
Ten to life - from a judge so fine,
Best man - that money can buy...

Took a shot but I've failed,
Now I'm dying in jail.
And it cuts like a knife,
I'm gettin' Ten To Life...

Just like a dream they busted me and put me away,
Over the hills and down to the slammer to stay.

Hey mister "know it all" - what the hell you gonna do?
When a jerk like that takes a swing at you.
You'll turn another cheek, take livin' in disgrace,
You'll pull the trigger - get off of my face...
