Tell me more, all about your class.
Wasted days - used to watch your ass.
Make your move, cos' you're in - I'll pass
Lets clear the air -
Hearts of stone and one track mind,
Makin' bread on an easy ride.
Cover up for a heavy crime,
You call it fair?

You'll never start learnin',
Just keep those wheels turnin',
My heart goes on burnin'...

What's you gonna do when your world goes down?
Small time player on the big ground,
Push it to the limit but the moment's gone.
Now I'm out.
Money for the blow and you think you're big?
Build your muscles but your heart gets weak.
Makin' up a dream it falls apart,
I don't wanna be your bodyguard.

Listen up - here's something new -
Now I'm quit protecting you.
Fuck yourself til' the you're black and blue,
Get off my side.
I don't care if you're in or out,
Make believes what it's all about.
Be a part of the faceless crowd,
I'll be alright!

You'll never start learnin',
Just keep those wheels turnin',
My heart goes on burnin'...
