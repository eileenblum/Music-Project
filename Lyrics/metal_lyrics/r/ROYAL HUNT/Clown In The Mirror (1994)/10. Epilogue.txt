Sailin' away - alone in the ships of time,
Wanderin' bout the past - stayin' lost in line.
Never ending story of both night and day,
Everything's been lost along the way...

Over the years all the friends I've had,
Rushed to settle down before they died.
In the darkest hour - screams into the night,
Everyone's who never seen the light.

Someone's lost and someone's found,
Someone's movin' 'round and 'round.
Someone's pushin' all the way and hit's the ground.
Someone's came and someone's gone,
Someone's livin' on the run.
Someone's made it, someone's not,
To see the dawn...

Minute by minute, hour by hour's gone,
Left me alone, kept twistin' me 'round and 'round.
Every single piece of me will cry for help,
Do I have to take that final step?

Someone's lost and someone's found,
Someone's movin' 'round and 'round.
Someone's pushin' all the way and hit's the ground.
Someone's came and someone's gone,
Someone's livin' on the run.
Someone's made it, someone's not,
To see the dawn...
