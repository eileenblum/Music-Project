Call it a day, close down the front,
What you don't own, that's you don't want.
Hitchin' a ride to the land of "A lot",
Please everyone, feel like a slot.
You gonna choose, from a pack of lies,
Which one will close somebody's eyes.

You gotta jump over somebody's head,
You better watch it every step.
It's kind of tricky without safety net.

Here today, gone tomorrow,
From time to time it changes the state of mind.
Here today, gone tomorrow,
If you could get another life, your tears will dry?
You'll see it passin' by...

Claim to the top, make it all real,
Crash everyone under your wheel.
Give it a shot, do it at your best,
Conscience is clear, put it to rest.

Something is wrong, something won't flow,
Feel like dressed up and no place to go,
Stop buggin' me, now when you've failed.
You're talkin' fair and out on bail,
But every coffin needs a nail...
