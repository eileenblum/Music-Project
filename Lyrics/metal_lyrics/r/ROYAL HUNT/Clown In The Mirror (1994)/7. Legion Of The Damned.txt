I'm back in town where I was born,
Where street's so cold and heart's of stone.

They told me - kid, you'll see the sun.
I did! through the barrel of the gun...

Day one I understood the game,
So much to loose - so much to gain.

I'm not the one who's left behind,
I know I'll make it - through the night...

Somebody's gonna die in a desperate fight,
No use to hide away the light.
Get paid to go so far - no matter who you are.
Nobody's gonna run and there's no one to blame,
We're under the gun and feel no shame,
It's never gonna end - the legion of the damned...

I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools,
So many saints, so many rules...

It's gonna be - cold day in hell,
If ever reason'll break the spell.

Somebody's gonna die in a desperate fight,
No use to hide away the light.
Get paid to go so far - no matter who you are.
Nobody's gonna run and there's no one to blame,
We're under the gun and feel no shame,
It's never gonna end - the legion of the damned...

They don't understand,
I know who I am...
