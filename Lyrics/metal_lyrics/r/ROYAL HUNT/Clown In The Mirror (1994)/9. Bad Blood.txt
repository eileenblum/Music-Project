I used to be kind of an easy guy,
I tell you now you've sort of crossed the line.
I've been in town and you've called the names,
You better run back home and get brand new face!

Bad times lost and good times won.
Things will get ugly, you've all alone,
You will never see the dawn.
I don't care, cos' I'm bad to the bone...

Bad blood breakin' your heart,
I'm gonna track you down,
You knew it right from the start.
Bad blood breakin' your heart,
All we got is just a bad, bad blood...
Bad blood breakin' your heart,
Because you're trapped in the middle,
Now you're fallin' apart.
Bad blood breakin' your heart,
All we got is just a bad, bad blood...

You want me down crawlin' on my knees,
You wanna watch me suffer slowly by degrees,
Hard hittin' stuff, but it won't make me crack,
You wanna fight, you'll get a bang for the buck.

Bad blood breakin' your heart,
I'm gonna track you down,
You knew it right from the start.
Bad blood breakin' your heart,
All we got is just a bad, bad blood...
Bad blood breakin' your heart,
Because you're trapped in the middle,
Now you're fallin' apart.
Bad blood breakin' your heart,
All we got is just a bad, bad blood...
