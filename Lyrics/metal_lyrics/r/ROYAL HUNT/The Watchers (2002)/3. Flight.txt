[Live]

Eyes of the night keepin' me right
Engine's roaring like hell
Wing on my side, shakes of the light
Ready to go -I can tell

You better sit upright or you'll fall down
No one's gonna help you miles around
There's no place for tears or fear of heights
Nothing - just the thunder of flights

Fly forever and try -
Cross over the sky -
Feelin' the wind blow.
Cry for losers who died
They're watching you fly -
Over the rainbow

Scary how fast you're down in the dust,
Watching the sign in the sky
Kill or get killed, glory and thrill
Waitin' for one who'll survive
I had a dream last night and I say you burn
Right on the edge of the point of no return
No more excuses and no more comin' back
Light of the sun - ifs turnin' black
