[New Version]

Another fight - another story,
I can not choose,
I'm always payin' too much
Days runs to nights, turns off the glory.
Somebody looses, somebody looks out of touch

The colours are dark, but I hope I got luck on my side

My spirit's lost -
I cry my heart out,

10 000 years have past - and what have we learned?
We're doing worse - illusions all 'round.
My life's the same as many lifetimes ago.

Day in, day out -
I'll be alright.
Day in, day out -
I feel like shouting it out.
