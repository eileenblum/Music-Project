[Live]

Sailin' away - alone on the ship of time
Wandering 'bout the past - stayin' lost in line
Never endin' story of both night and day
Everything's been lost along the way

Over the years all the friends I've had
Rushed to settle down before they died
In the darkest hour - scream into the night
Everyone who's never seen the light

Someone's lost and someone's found
Someone's movin' 'round and 'round
Someone's pushin' all the way and hits the ground
Someone came and someone's gone
Someone's livin' on the run
Someone made it, someone not
To see the dawn

Minute by minute, hour by hour's gone
Left me alone, kept twistin' me 'round 'n 'round
Every single piece of me will cry for help
Do I have to take that final step?
