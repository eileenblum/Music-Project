[Live]

The one who's watching over my shoulder - get a life
I see your arms are nailed to the cross but your eyes are 
so alive
I never thought you're lying but now it's turned around
So many hearts are dying - you've let them down over and 
over again

Can't reach you, can't meet you
I gave you everything I've got
You hear me, don't leave me
It's my message to you, God
Can't see you, can't feel you
I've lost just everything I've got
Forget me, you've left me
It's my message to you, God

We're busy burning witches the way we've learned from you
We're good at killing creatures, so teach us something new, 
come on!
One of your own creations is kind of hard to understand
You, freak of nature - just tell me why did you create us 
man?

Traces on the floor,
I can hear the door closing me right inside my dream, it's 
a sign from him - let me be
Sunrise through the dust - future in the past chasing me
Shadows on the wall, voices down the hall's calling me over 
and over again
