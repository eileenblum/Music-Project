[New Version]

Our circus's closed and midnight ghost
Comin' out as lights go down
Old and tired clown, no one is around
Staring at the mirror - now listen

Oh, the show must go on
Lived in the crowd, but dyin' all alone

Clown in the mirror - glitter and scars
Here pleasure and pain look as one
Clown in the mirror touchin' the stars
Flyin' his dream to the sun

What a mask can say? Cry the night away!
Askin' mirror: "Tell me how long?"
Wrigglin' all those years, through the laughter'n'tears
Don't believe in hearts of stone
Oh, the show must go on
Lived in the crowd, but dyin' all alone

Clown in the mirror - glitter and scars
Here pleasure and pain look as one
Clown in the mirror touchin' the stars
Flyin' his dream to the sun

But the sun will rise, evil took the prize
Something will remind you
Sign of disgrace - this paint on your face
