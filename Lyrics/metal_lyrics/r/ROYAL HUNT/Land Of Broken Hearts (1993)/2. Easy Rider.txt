Somebody's gonna win,
One of a million, one of a kind,
So tell me it's a sin,
I'm pushin' it up and crossin' the line.

Nobody's gonna run, Nobody's gonna hide,
So if you lookin' for trouble - you'd better
Stand up and find!

Easy Rider - takin' it day by day,
Easy Rider - drinkin' the night away.
Easy Rider - livin' it day by day,
Easy Rider - trouble is on its way.

Since I was a kid,
Never looked back, never slowed down,
Ridin' down the street,
Lookin' for one way ticket to the promised land.
