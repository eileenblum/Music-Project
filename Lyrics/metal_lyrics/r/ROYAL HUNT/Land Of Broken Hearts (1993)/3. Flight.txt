Eye's of the night, keepin' me right,
Engine is roarin' like hell.
Wings on my side, shakes off the light,
Ready to go - I can tell.

You better sit upright or you fall down,
No one's gonna help you miles around.
There's no place for tears or fear of heights,
Nothing - just the thunder of flights.

Fly forever and try cross over the sky -
Feelin' the wind blow.
Cry for losers who died,
They watchin' you fly - over the rainbow.

Scary how fast, you're down in the dust,
Watchin' the sign in the sky.
Kill or get killed, glory and thrill
Waitin' for one who'll survive.

I had a dream last night and I say you burn.
Right on the edge of the point of  no return,
No more excuses and no more comin' back,
Light from the suns turnin' black.
