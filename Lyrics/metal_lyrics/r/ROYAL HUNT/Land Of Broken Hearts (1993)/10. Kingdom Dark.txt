Run, you better run as far as you can,
Why - I'm gonna die and nobody cares.

Stop wastin' my time, I'm gonna fly high,
You'll find out, the way to survive -
Follow the light tonight!

Watch your steps, it's Kingdom Dark,
There is fear behind your back.
Help me out or let me in,
Watch me die for someone's sin.

Out, somebody shouts, but who - I can't see,
Age, blesses to the rage, callin' for me...
