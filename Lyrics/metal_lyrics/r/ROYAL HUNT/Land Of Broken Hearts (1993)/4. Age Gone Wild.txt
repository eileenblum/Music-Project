All I need is to turn the page,
I can see a man - he's twice my age.
Proud face, a lot of scars,
I can see a shadow of the bars...

Hold on - can you feel the sorrow,
Hold on - he won't see tomorrow...

Yes, he was proud as hell to the end of the line,
So he's got a story to tell of the age gone wild.
The magic and the spell, an eye for an eye,
Now, he's got a story to tell of the age gone wild...

Just a kid but he was told,
He will be the one to rule the world.
Such a shame - with speed of light,
He become a beggar over over night.
