I'm just a number, I don't know my name.
Unknown faces a part of the game.
Out in the desert the madness begins,
Who's talkin' mercy? We're playin' to win...

Better run around, there's no easy way out,
If you loose - take a stand,
So do whatever you can - again and again.

Running wild like creature of the night,
We're born to run - we never trust the light.
Running wild, we're so afraid to try,
We're all alone and everyone is blind,
Running wild...

You'll start the fire and livin' on a lie,
Rats get fat while good men die.
They got you running to follow the track,
You'll face the trouble with fear on the back...
