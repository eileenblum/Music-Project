[AndrÃ© Andersen]

Now I'm going
Down on down

Take me home
I'm all alone, lost without a clue
I've been around, been up and down for years but now I'm through
Take my hand
I need a friend to get back on my feet
One man down
Cuffed on the ground
These odds are hard to beat
This time around
I'm going down
Face down on the ground
Down on down
Down, down

Out of gas, an empty glass,
Bored and out of change
Looks like any kind of fun is way outside my range
Tried so hard to play it smart but trouble came,
Looking for me
I'm sure today they'll lock me up and throw away the key

I'm falling, falling
There's nothing to lose or to gain anymore
Falling, falling
It never will be like before

So now I'm falling, falling
There's nothing to lose or to gain anymore
Falling, falling
It never will be like before
Falling, falling
There's nothing to lose and there's nothing to find
Falling, falling
Way down it's the end of the line
