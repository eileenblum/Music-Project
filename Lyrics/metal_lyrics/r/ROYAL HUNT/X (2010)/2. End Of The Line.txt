[AndrÃ© Andersen]

Hey, watch us crawling downhill,
Pretending to be on our way to the top
So we're falling upwards or is it just me

Feeling lost and confused
(Yeah, it's all yesterday's news)

What it we're leaving something or
someone behind as we're marching away
And believing that there's no time to rewind, oh no
I need some time to catch my breath
You're in or not? You're in or not?
We're running hot

Second away from getting there,
But loosing minutes are passing us by
Hours to change the pace
But we're refusing
Times up end of the line

We all need some time to catch our breath
You're in or not? You're in or not?
Get ready, cause we're running hot

Second away from getting there,
But loosing minutes are passing us by
Hours to change the pace
But we're refusing
It's time for you to slow down and try to see why
Your life keeps on passing you by

Treasure
Metal stop running
The end of the line
