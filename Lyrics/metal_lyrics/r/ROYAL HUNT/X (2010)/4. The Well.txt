[AndrÃ© Andersen]

Every friend you've had
Everyone you've lost
Whom you miss the most are disappearing
In a nick of time
You can change it all with a single call
And watch them slowly reappearing

Drop a coin into this magic well,
Make a wish but not just yet
Someone's heaven could be someone's hell
Be aware of what you'll get

Everyday we die just a little bit
Every heart beat just brings the very last one closer
You can stop the clock
You can turn the tide
For a little while
So hit the breaks it's been a long ride

Drop a coin into this magic well,
Make a wish and you will see
Who you were before that final bell
Are you the one you wished to be?

Look inside the world
Look inside the wear
