[AndrÃ© Andersen]

I'm walking tonight under these blood red stars
They're spreading their light across the sky
We're moving apart me and these blood red stars
It's breaking my heart
I'm wondering why

How could I forget to once again
Raise my glass to you
The land of sorrow
You remember wasted years full of pain
And full of angry tears

Why this tortured soil is still alive
How with all those scars
It keeps on living?
Hopes and dreams are in the dirty
Every soul's been badly hurt
But look up there
Above the wall
Red stars refuse to fall
As they should, Dead cold

I'm walking tonight under these blood red stars
They're spreading their light across the sky
We're moving apart me and these blood red stars
It's breaking my heart
I'm wondering why
Wondering why

Hey, it's all gonna change one day
I'll close my eyes and pray all your pain away

I'm walking tonight under these blood red stars
They're spreading their light across the sky
We're moving apart me and these blood red stars
It's breaking my heart
I'm wondering why

Where bloody stars
Wondering why
