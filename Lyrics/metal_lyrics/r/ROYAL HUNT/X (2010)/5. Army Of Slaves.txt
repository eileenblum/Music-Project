[AndrÃ© Andersen]

I've been rolling with the puches,
I've been chased around town
At the bottom of the blood chain
You better get used to be pushed around

I've been lost and I've been lonely,
I've been howling like a dog
And I might look all the same,
But I'm still in the game
It makes you hard as a rock

You need a lot of fists until the system breaks
So an army, just like us is all it takes

You see a slave with an army of slaves
Can change the world in mysterious ways
Cause when the chain is gone his heart gets stronger
A slave with an army of slaves
He is a slave no longer
Slave no longer

I've been kept below the surface
A part of the bad crowd
I was rotting inside as the last one in line
With no chance of ever getting out

I'm sick and tired of losing,
Sick and tired of bad luck
Let's say today is the day when I'm breaking away
And never ever coming back

You need a lot of fists until the system breaks
So an army, just like us is all it takes

You see a slave with an army of slaves
Can change the world in mysterious ways
Cause when the chain is gone his heart gets stronger
A slave with an army of slaves

A slave with an army of slaves
He is a slave no longer uh, yeah

Slave with an army of slaves
Can change the world in so many ways
Cause when the chain is gone his heart gets stronger
A slave with an army of slaves

A slave with an army of slaves
Can change the world in mysterious ways
Cause when the chain is gone his heart gets stronger
A slave with an army of slaves
He is a slave no longer
