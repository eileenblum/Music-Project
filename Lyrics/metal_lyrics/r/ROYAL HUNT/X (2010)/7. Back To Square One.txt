[AndrÃ© Andersen]

They say a home's just a place where you can leave your hat
That's right and I'm a living proof
As you will see of that
On the move all alone who cares 'bout a place to call home?
Look ahead race is on and you better run away from square one
Run away from square one

I use to chase fame and fortune all over the place
But what's  the point if you never meet a single friendly face
Anywhere, anytime?
I'm starting to think it's a crime
Can't you see all those years I've been living a lie?

I travelled the world and I crossed every sea
I've seen everything what I wanted to see
Around the world on the run
I'm back to square one

I'm pushing the wheel and I'm turning around
I'm leaving behind everything that I've found
Along the way It's been down
I'm back to square one

I travelled the world and I crossed every sea
I've seen everything what I wanted to see
Around the world on the run
I'm back to square one

I'm pushing the wheel and I'm turning around
I'm leaving behind everything that I've found
Along the way It's been down
I'm back to square one

I travelled the world and I crossed every sea
I've seen everything what I wanted to see
Around the world on the run
I'm back to square one

I'm pushing the wheel and I'm turning around
I'm leaving behind everything that I've found
Along the way It's been down
I'm back to square one

I'm going on I'm back, back to square one
I'm going on I'm back to square one, yeah won't say yeah
I'm back to square one
I'm back to square one, square one
I'm back to square one, square one
