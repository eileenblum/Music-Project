[AndrÃ© Andersen]

Oh, I be a shadowman

Don't need a face, don't need a name
No business card but all the same
I'm right around the corner just in case
You'll change your mind

I'm like a shadow in the night
Here on your left, here on your right
I'm everywhere at anytime
An easy one to find

I'm your master, doing well
Reaching out to help
Just take my hand, come on man
When your dearest dreams are shot to hell
Here I am your shadowman
Shadowman

I have it all in any shape,
In any colour real or fake
To shoot, to smoke to swallow raw
Let go and take a dive

And watch your biggest problem
Gone! Severe mistakes become undone
You must admit that I'm the one re-tailoring your life

I'm your master, doing well
Reaching out to help
Just take my hand, come on man
When your dearest dreams are shot to hell
Here I am your shadowman
Shadowman

Look back at your life and tell me you're fine
Why, please tell me why did you cross the line
Into the world of a cold, permanent night?

Alright now red alert begins to flash
You're into deep and out of cash
Prepare yourself to face the crash
Oh, now it's all unfair?

So you discovered something new
I'm not kidding you, I'm killing you
You're on your own because we're through
And I don't really care

I'm your master wish me well
Fade away but try to understand
When your silly life's got shot to hell
Think of me your shadowman
