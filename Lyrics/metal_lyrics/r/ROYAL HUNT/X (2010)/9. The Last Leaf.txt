[AndrÃ© Andersen]

Wind is shaking the tree outside
Holding it nice and tight
While blowing leafs away
I know it's just a myth,
But can the last one escape the fall and stay?

How I wish that you were here to help me
Do bitter words suppose to cut so deep
How I wish that you were here to tell me sleep

I'm still in front of an empty page,
Imagine deserted stage
Nobody else but you
Up there trying to save the day but failing
What's left to say? Who knew?

But out there in the cold the last leaf's gonna fall
And sweep away another lonely day
So I'm just waiting for a gentle sigh, my final call
Fly away, I'll follow

Can you see the wind is getting stronger?
It keeps on playing with my jaded heart
Let it be Can't take it any longer
I know that out there in the cold
The last leaf's gonna fall
And sweep away another lonely day
So I'm just waiting for a gentle sigh, my final call
Fly away, I'll follow

But out there in the cold the last leaf's gonna fall
And sweep away another lonely day
So I'm just waiting for a gentle sigh, my final call
Fly away, fly away, fly
