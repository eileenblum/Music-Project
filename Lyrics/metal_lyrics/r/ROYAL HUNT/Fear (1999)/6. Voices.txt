Stranger, stranger look what's going on
Danger, danger's coming, you're alone
in the noman's land, out of your head
where the angels fear to tread

Voices are calling
Calling for you from the stories which never've been told
Voices are calling
Voices of heroes - betrayed and left out in the cold
Voices are calling
Crying for vengeance that they were denied through the years
Voices are calling
Sharing their secrets of glory and tears

Dreamer, dreamer once again refused
to be a winner - sinner  - what are you going to loose?
Hide behind the lies, close your eyes
Step by step your spirit dies

Voices are calling
Calling for you from the stories which never've been told
Voices are calling
Voices of heroes - betrayed and left out in the cold
Voices are calling
Crying for vengeance that they were denied through the years
Voices are calling
Trying to tell you their secrets of glory and tears
