If pictures could talk there'd be too many voices
If sorrow could scream I'd be deaf in a day
I beg my memories to slowly fade away
Too many voices

If pain could've been seen there'd be too many faces
wherever I'd go - I'd rather be blind
And in the darkest night I'd loose my guiding light
but you I'll find even if I'm blind

Follow me - but I don't know where I'm going
Follow me down the road to something new
Follow me - there's no other way of knowing
what your heart is telling you

I'm planting my hopes and I harvest illusions
year after year - understood by a few
Sometimes it seems like I'm getting through to you
but it's just an illusion

I'm so afraid of loosing you
but there's nothing I can do
Nothing I can do but my heart is calling you - follow me
