Runaway's free, enemy's found
I'm on the plane but my heart's on the ground
frozen by fear, covered in snow
pounding away in dispair and somehow I know
we'll never make it back - where do we go?

On top of the world I'm a king of the hill
I'm riding the wind and horses of steel
I'm one of a kind, just open your door
to one of the faces of war
Let me inside I'm just one of the faces of war

Senses are dead, reason is gone
Why do I shoot, tell me, what have they done?
Innocent kid covered in blood
Shreaded to pieces and left in the mud
Now I know - we'll never make it back. Where do we go?

End of the road, back to the wall
I'm kicking the dust on the spot where I'll fall
Final command - crime in disguise
Second of pain and I'm closing my eyes - now you know
We're never coming back - it's time to go
