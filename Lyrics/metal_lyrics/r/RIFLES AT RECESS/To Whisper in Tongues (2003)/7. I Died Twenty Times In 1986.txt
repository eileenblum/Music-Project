where were the angels when my sunshine was shattered? how did it feel to touch my
skin? eight years and innocent, how did it feel to touch my skin? your hands buried
buried my tongue in the deepest grave , flowers were fading on gods brightest day.
i was sucha cute kid but now i hope youve spent these days practicing death. where
were the angels when screams died wishing that my throat was the size of forgiveness?
i was his sin. i hope that youve spent these days practicing death. i close my eyes
and you melt away....let's restart this fucking war.
