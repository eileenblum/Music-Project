I need to know if someone or something is there
Watching every move that I make
There's got to be a reason for the cross that I bear
If I open my eyes will I wake?
Shattered emotions and seasons of change
Riding the wind bringing troubles again
Living on the edge I have made my mistakes
But that was yesterday

Calling Angels, come watch over me
Catch me from falling I want to believe
Calling Angels, spread your wings over me
Cover my heart from pain's memory

I don't know where I'm going
But I sure no where I've been
I'm feeling the walls closing in
I've got to break these chains that are holding me down
The healing insinde must begin

Turning the corner and starting again
Rise from the ashes, take hold of the flame
I must faith there's an answer above
To make it through the night

Calling Angels, come watch over me
Catch me from falling I want to believe
Calling Angels, spread your wings over me
Cover my heart from pain's memory

Calling Angels, come watch over me
Catch me from falling I want to believe
Calling Angels, spread your wings over me
Cover my heart from pain's memory

Calling Angels
Cover my heart, spread your wings over me
I want to believe, I want to believe, Calling Angels
