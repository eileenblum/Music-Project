Looking for answers deep in the night
Caught in the shadows hiding from sight
Losing my senses out in the cold
When I felt the power breaking the hold

Fight to survive, you'll stand or fall
You're dead or alive inside this war

When Darkness Reigns, you'll feel the agony
The price is paid, if only eyes could see

Hiding your secrets under your skin
Living a lie you never can win
Get out of your prison open the door
You're playing with fire like I was before

Fight to survive, you'll stand or fall
You're dead or alive inside this war

When Darkness Reigns, you'll feel the agony
The price is paid, if only eyes could see
When Darkness Reigns, you'll face the enemy
Saving grace, from the hand of destiny

Running, hiding, trying to fill the spaces
Living, dying, time has quickly faded

Looking for answers deep in the night
Caught in the shadows, living a lie

Fight to survive, you'll stand or fall
You're dead or alive inside this war
When Darkness Reigns, you'll feel the agony
The price is paid, if only eyes could see
When Darkness Reigns, you'll face the enemy
Saving grace, from the hand of destiny
