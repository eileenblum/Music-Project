Cold wind and rain, driven by desert storms
Slaves to the sun unbridled heat
And still we journey on - to rise! Rise

Your reaching on, objects of scorn, the covenant of blood
The remnant livess, and now it seals your fate

Judah, your time has come
Cities will burn, nations will fall
Kingdoms are gone, still you stand strong
The Lion of Judah

Laws of the prophets passed down for generations
The veils removed, revealed in time
The sceptor will not depart

The Lion of Judah, I hear your call
Cities will burn, I know for sure
Outside your walls, temples will fall
But still there's Judah

See the cornerstone
The strength of Israel
Lay down your crowns
Get off your throne
Before you're carried away

The Lion of Judah
I hear your call
Cities will burn
I know for sure
Outside your walls
Temples will fall
The Lion of Judah
