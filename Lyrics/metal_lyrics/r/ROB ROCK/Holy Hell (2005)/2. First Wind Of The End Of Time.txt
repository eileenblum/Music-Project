Can you hear the thunder roar?
Can't you see it's the end of the world?

Shining stars, fall from the sky
The sun and the moon will not give their light
The earth will shake, it can't be denied

In the days of depravity
Rising up for iniquity

Rumors of war and wickedness
Nothing but fear and deep distress

Where will you run when the world is in flames?
Where will you hide on the reckoning day?
Nowhere to run when the hour arrives
Nowhere to hide at the end of time

Face to face as he opens the scroll
Lamb of God, the one foretold

Shining stars, fall from the sky
The sun and the moon will not give their light
The earth will shake, it can't be denied

At the end of time, many will call
On his name, at the end of time

Where will you run
When the world is in flames?
Where will you hide
On the reckoning day?
Nowhere to run
When the hour arrives
Nowhere to hide
At the end of time
