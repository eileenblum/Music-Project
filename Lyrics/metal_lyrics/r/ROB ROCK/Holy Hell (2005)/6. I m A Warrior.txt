I could see the city lights, then they turned to black
Then I heard the sirens sounding out
I could see the rockets glare, shooting in the night
Everyone was paying for their lives

Am I dreaming?
I don't believe it
Am I wrong or right?
Then I heard a voice say in the night

I'm a warrior - take my hand
Let me lead you to the promised land
I'm a warrior- take my hand
Side by side we'll make our final stand

Then I saw this blinding light - I heard a sonic boom
I could feal the earth shake in the doom
Then a silence filled the air, I could not hear a sound
I could see the ashes all around

Am I dreaming?
I don't believe it
In the dead of night
I could hear the voice that showed me life

I'm a warrior - take my hand
Let me lead you to the promised land
I'm a warrior- take my hand
Side by side we'll make our final stand
I'm a warrior

I'm a warrior - take my hand
Let me lead you to the promised land
I'm a warrior- take my hand
Side by side we'll make our final stand
I'm a warrior
