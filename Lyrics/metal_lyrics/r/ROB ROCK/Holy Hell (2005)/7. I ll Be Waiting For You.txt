Staring through the window, longing for the other side
Your days are so much better, I wish I was by your side

You were there for me everyday
In my heart I can hear you say

I'll be waiting for you, I'll be waiting for you
When this world is all through, I'll be waiting for you

The memories like a river, flowing on through my mind
Your voice I still remember, and your words are still my guide

You are there for me erveryday
In my heart I can still hear you say

I'll be waiting for you, I'll be waiting for you
When this world is all through, I'll be waiting for you

I'll be waiting for, I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for, I'm still waiting for you

Your are there for me everyday
In my heart I can still hear you say

I'll be waiting for you, I'll be waiting for you
When this world is all through, I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you, I'll be waiting for you
