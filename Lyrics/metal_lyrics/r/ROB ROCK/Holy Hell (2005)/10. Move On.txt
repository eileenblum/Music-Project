I've traveled every country, I've traveled in my mind
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time
And somewhere lies the answer to all the questions why
What really makes the difference between all dead and
Living things the will to stay alive

Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion - Move On
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing - Move On
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning - Move On
How I treasure every minute, being part of, being in it,
With the urge to move on

They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul
A voyager and settler they both have distant goals
If I explore the heavens or if I search inside
It really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself
That I have always tried

Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion - Move On
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing - Move On
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning - Move On
How I treasure every minute, being part of, being in it,
With the urge to move on

The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
The crying of the eagles that hover over me
I see it and I hear it but how can I explain
The wonder of the moment to be alive and feel the sun
That follows every rain

Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion - Move On
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing - Move On
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning - Move On
How I treasure every minute, being part of, being in it,
With the urge to move on

Move On - Move On,
Like a wind that's always blowing,
Life is flowing - Move on
