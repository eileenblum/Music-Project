Over and over and over again
The spirit and flesh, the conflict within
Temtation, desire, the fight to be pure
The lust of the eyes, so hard to endure

This is Holy Hell
The battle for your mind
Purify my soul
In the cruible divine

Testing your weakness, enticement to sin
The master of lies is at it again
Weapons of warfare and schemes of deceit
The moment is now, the flesh is so weak

This is Holy Hell
The battle for your mind
Purify my soul
In the cruible divine
Holy Hell

Over and over and
Over again - Holy Hell
The spirit and flesh
The conflict within
Holy Hell

This is Holy Hell
The battle for your mind
Purify my soul
In the cruible divine

This is Holy Hell
The battle for your mind
Purify my soul
In the cruible divine
Holy Hell
