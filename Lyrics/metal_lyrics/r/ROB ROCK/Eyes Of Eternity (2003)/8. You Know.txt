The air is filled with tension, I'm tired of this game
Something here is dying it don't feel the same
Lying right beside you, I find it hard to breathe
Searching for a reason that I just can't see 

You know that I'm on to you, I know what I see
I see the lies reflecting in your eyes 

The dream is over, losing its charm
And now betrayal fills your heart
You won't remember, you're moving on
I can't believe your passions gone 

A gripping silence now fills the air
I'm reaching out but you don't care
Intense emotions hang on your sleeve
Just like a badge of enmity 

No contact, no mercy, no truth to tell
Time and time again, you turn and walk away 

You know that I'm on to you, I know what I see
I see the lies reflecting in your eyes
You know that I'm watching you, I know what I feel
No matter what you say I know you're trying to hide from me 

No contact, no mercy, no truth to tell
Time and time again, you turn and walk away 

You know that I'm on to you, I know what I see
I see the lies reflecting in your eyes
You know that I'm watching you, I know what I feel
No matter what you say I know you're trying to hide from me
