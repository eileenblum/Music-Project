[limited edition bonus track]

Beautiful Lady, tell me what you looking for
Beautiful Lady, let me help you find the door 

She was just a lonely child, left out in the street
She was lost and she was wild, no shoes on her feet
She stands upon the corner, with life passing by
What's locked behind those distant eyes? 

Beautiful Lady, tell me what you looking for
Beautiful Lady, let me help you find the door 

A tender face, a heart of stone, her pain is her own
Every night when the sun goes down, it chills to the bone
No place to rest her head, no place to call home
How can you make it on your own? 

Beautiful Lady, tell me what you looking for
Beautiful Lady, let me help you find the door 

Beautiful Lady, here's my hand we'll take this road
Beautiful Lady, to the place that we call home
