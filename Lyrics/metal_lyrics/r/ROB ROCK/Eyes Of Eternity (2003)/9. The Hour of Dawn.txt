The hour of dawn and the stars begin their slow recession
The light appears and the world soon transforms
Who holds the key to unlock my door?
Who holds the key to this life I've known?
I lost my way but I found it in your eyes this morning
Now I'm here, slip away to the dawn 

I long to see the answer, inside this crystal ball
The Word is still revealing until the curtain falls
These things are kept a secret until the hour unknown
Who stands among the seven? The hand that holds the stars
Shining a face of brilliance just like a blazing fire
These things are kept a secret until the hour of dawn 

Who holds the key? Forevermore 

Another time or another place
Chance is a wheel that turns the hand of fate
We were young we were so nadve
How could we know when the heart is so deceived?
When you're taken by fear you will search for tomorrow
All that I want is to be free in my life. 

Looking back I can plainly see
The mirrors of time reflecting the truth to me
When your heart is invisible 
A tormented soul confused by all your dreams
As we're riding the storm and we head for tomorrow
All that I want is to be free 

Who holds the key that will open tomorrow? I must be free. 

The hour of dawn and the stars begin their slow recession
The light appears and the world soon transforms
Who holds the key to unlock my door?
Who holds the key to this life I've known?
I lost my way but I found it in your eyes this morning
Now I'm here, slip away to the dawn
Won't you open the door to the rest of my life?
