I have seen the highest mountain
The holy city in the sky
Coming down out of heaven
Where his glory dwells inside 

Hear the angels singing out his name..."Hallelujah"
Where the light has never ceased to shine
Oh Zion 

In the fields of fire
Through the mud and the mire
We will fight and rise up again
On the storms of the sand
We're off to the holy land
Oh Zion, here we come again 

You want to go to the mountain
Well faith and truth are the keys
You must believe in the Savior
And the price he paid for you and me 

Hear the nations calling out his name..."Hallelujah"
Eternal light will never cease to shine
Oh Zion 

In the fields of fire
Through the mud and the mire
We will fight and rise up again
On the storms of the sand
We're off to the holy land
Oh Zion, here we come again 

In the fields of fire
Through the mud and the mire
We will fight and rise up again
On the storms of the sand
We're off to the holy land
Oh Zion, here we come again
Come again!
