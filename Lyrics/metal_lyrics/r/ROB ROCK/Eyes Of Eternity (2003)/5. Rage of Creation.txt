The war machine is on the loose
Mile after mile we tread for you
We cross the land and sea and we journey through the night
We're never turning back; we'll never give up the fight 

Living on the edge of life come fly away with me
Reaching for the endless sky will set you free 

Can you feel it? I feel the Rage of Creation
Can you feel it? Tonight I feel the Rage of Creation 

The battle blazes on and on
Just like a never-ending storm
When the lights go down and you feel the power of the stage
Shining like the burning sun, enchanted by the flame 

Living on the edge of life come fly away with me
Reaching for the endless sky will set you free 

Can you feel it? I feel the Rage of Creation
Can you feel it? Tonight I feel the Rage of Creation 

Can you feel it? I feel the Rage of Creation
Can you feel it? Tonight I feel the Rage of Creation
Can you feel it? I feel the Rage of Creation
Can you feel it? Tonight I feel the Rage of Creation
Can you feel it? I feel the Rage of Creation
