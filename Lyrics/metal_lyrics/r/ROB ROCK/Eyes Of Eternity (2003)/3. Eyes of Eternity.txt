Feeling the eyes that are roaming the earth
Desperate hearts that are cursed from their birth
I want to be there when we know the reasons why
The tragedy and pain we carry through this life 

At the end of time, I will wait for you
Eyes of Eternity will open 

Live for today because tomorrow is gone
Changing the course of the road that you're on
I know you'll be there if we go our separate ways
We'll find the answers to the questions that we crave 

At the end of time, I will wait for you
Eyes of Eternity will open
On the other side, I'll be there for you
Eyes of Eternity have spoken 

Crossing the night I will face it alone
Stand at the gates of the spiritual realm
I'm going to be there when the eyes begin to shine
Illuminating explanations for this life 

At the end of time, I will wait for you
Eyes of Eternity will open
On the other side, I'll be there for you
Eyes of Eternity have spoken
