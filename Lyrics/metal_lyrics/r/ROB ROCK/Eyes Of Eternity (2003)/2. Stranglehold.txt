Say goodbye to all that you have ever known
Shadows falling at your feet
Feel the enemy that lingers in the air
Your destiny is under siege 

I want you to tell me
I need you to be free 

Bow your head and close your eyes
Don't you know that evil's by your side?
The witching hour has finally come 

Every day you fight a war you cannot win
See the signs of discontent
A legacy of torment follows after you
While you slave in decadence 

I want you to tell me
I need you to be free 

Bow your head, the day is here
Don't you know that evil's always near?
The witching hour has finally come 

The stranglehold is hard to see
Focus my eyes so I can face the enemy 

I want you to tell me
I need you to be free 

Bow your head and close your eyes
Don't you know that evil's by your side?
The witching hour has finally come 

Bow your head, the day is here
Don't you know that evil's always near?
The witching hour has finally come
