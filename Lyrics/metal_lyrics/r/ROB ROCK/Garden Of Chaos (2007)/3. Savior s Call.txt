Born in misery
Silver spoon in hand
You canï¿½t find happiness
Lost in Neverland

Life will bring you to your knees
You will search but you wonï¿½t see
Youï¿½ll never find what youï¿½re looking for
Until you hear the Saviorï¿½s Call

Emptiness and pain
Cradle to the grave
Tasting everything
Just to find relief

Life will bring you to your knees
You will search but you wonï¿½t see
Youï¿½ll never find what youï¿½re looking for
Until you hear the Saviorï¿½s Call

In the night when darkness falls
Silence screams until you let it go
Reach the point of no return
Crying out for someone to take the throne of our life

Life will bring you to your knees
You will search but you wonï¿½t see
Youï¿½ll never find what youï¿½re looking for
Until you hear the Saviorï¿½s Call
