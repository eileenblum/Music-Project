King of Kings, with all the power and majesty
And with justice he alone, judges and makes war
Lord of Lords, his eyes blazing like fire
On his head are many crowns, wear a robe dipped
In blood

For 1000 years, the throne of grace
For 1000 years, no suffering pain
For 1000 years ï¿½ Millennial Reign

Word of God, heavens armies are following
As heï¿½s wielding the sword, striking down the nations
Faithful and true, is the spirit of prophecy
Will the fury and the wrath ruling over creation

For 1000 years, the throne of grace
For 1000 years, no suffering pain
For 1000 years ï¿½ Millennial Reign

King of Kings, with all the power and majesty
And with justice he alone, judges and makes war
Faithful and true, is the spirit of prophecy
Will the fury and the wrath ruling over creation

For 1000 years, the throne of grace
For 1000 years, no suffering pain
For 1000 years ï¿½ Millennial Reign
