He is coveting the action
The hero for the cause
Tainted by obsession
The holy war Jihad

Heï¿½s got his eyes on you; Watch him pull your strings
Heï¿½ll lay his lies on you, heï¿½ll promise everything

Taken by the hand of pride
Blinded by the lust inside
Just a child in Satanï¿½s Playground

When itï¿½s built upon aggression
The martyrs will arise
Virgins wait in heaven
The infidels must die

Got his eyes on you, let him pull your strings
Laying lies on you, heï¿½ll give you everything

Taken by the hand of pride
Blinded by the lust inside
Just a child in Satanï¿½s Playground
Follow any endless tale
Hide behind the silent veil
Just a pawn in Satanï¿½s Playground

Evil doctrine, Hellbound followers

Heï¿½s got his eyes on you; Watch him pull your strings
Heï¿½ll lay his lies on you, heï¿½ll promise everything

Taken by the hand of pride
Blinded by the lust inside
Just a child in Satanï¿½s Playground
Follow any endless tale
Hide behind the silent veil
Just a pawn in Satanï¿½s Playground
