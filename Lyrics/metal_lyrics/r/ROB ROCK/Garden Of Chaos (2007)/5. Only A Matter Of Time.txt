You know the end is coming fast ï¿½ one day soon
I feel the tension in the air
The world is spinning and itï¿½s losing all control
You know I see it everywhere

Does the mind see, what it wants to fear?
You want your remedy, itï¿½s only a matter of time
When the curtain falls, believe the ancient scrolls
Body, mind and soul, itï¿½s only a matter of time

Will you be ready for the coming of the Lord?
Beyond the sun itï¿½s set in stone
Too busy to believe in such an awful fate
Still waiting for the day to come

Some still believe the power of the planets
Some live as children of the stars
The signs of heaven and the messengers
All tell the tale of whatï¿½s to come

Does the mind see, what it wants to fear?
You want your remedy, itï¿½s only a matter of time
When the curtain falls, believe the ancient scrolls
Body, mind and soul, itï¿½s only a matter of time
