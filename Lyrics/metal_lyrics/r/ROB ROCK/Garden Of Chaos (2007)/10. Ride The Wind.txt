Through the streets of Zion and all across the land
You can hear the trumpets sounding
Now hear the command
Rise up in numbers and walk on the clouds
Weï¿½ve got the thunder so shout it out loud

Iï¿½ve never seen your face before, I never let you in
And when the storm is at my door,
I will ride the wind ï¿½ Ride the Wind

No peace in our lifetime, destruction of man
The course of a nation you never can plan
Tyrants and rulers with blood on their hands
Only the strong are making a stand

Iï¿½ve never seen the signs before
Caught up in the race
Evil lies behind the door, Iï¿½m gone without a trace

Ride the Wind ï¿½ Ride the Wind!
Ride the Wind ï¿½ Yea, come on!

Rocking the palace weï¿½re shaking the earth
With number and lightning the last will be first
Take all your stories, your legends and tales
Give me the answer itï¿½s heaven or hell

Iï¿½ve never seen your face before, I never let you in
And when the storm is at my door,
I will ride the wind ï¿½ Ride the Wind
