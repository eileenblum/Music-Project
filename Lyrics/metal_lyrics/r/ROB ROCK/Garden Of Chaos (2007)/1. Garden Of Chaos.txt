In the garden it was right
And now we pay the price for leaving it behind
Building temples to the sky
With a heart of stone weï¿½re shutting out the light

Screaming vengeance from the grave
The souls that made the sacrifice
Weï¿½re turning away

Conquer the evil, the shadows of war
When is the end going to come?
The Garden Of Chaos has no peace at all
Who then can say that theyï¿½ve won?

In the streets the children die
Shedding blood and tears and no one seems to cry
Politicians shift to blame
Flattering with words they lie,
Theyï¿½re playing the game

Conquer the evil, the shadows of war
When is the end going to come?
The Garden Of Chaos has no peace at all
Who then can say that theyï¿½ve won?

The battle lives another day
And we donï¿½t stop to see the signs
Canï¿½t we find a better way?
We donï¿½t want to see the carnage left behind

Conquer the evil, the shadows of war
When is the end going to come?
The Garden Of Chaos has no peace at all
Who then can say that theyï¿½ve won?
