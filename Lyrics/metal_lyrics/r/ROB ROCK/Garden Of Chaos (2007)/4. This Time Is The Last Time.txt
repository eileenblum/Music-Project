The answer is staring me right in the face
Been trying so hard but Iï¿½ve made my mistakes
Iï¿½ve been down this road before
And Iï¿½ve always wanted so much more

This time is the last time
I will give my heart away
This time is the last time
I will ever trust again

So hard to believe when youï¿½ve been cut down and torn
Iï¿½ve waited so long just to walk through this door
Now my heart is in your hands
We must realize the sacred plan

This time is the last time
I will give my heart away
This time is the last time
I will ever trust again

This is the last time!

I feel you come closer an my heart lies next to me
I feel you come closer and my soul wonï¿½t let me be

This Time ï¿½ Last Time

This time is the last time
I will give my heart away
This time is the last time
I will ever trust again

This time is the last time
I will give my heart away
This time is the last time
I will ever trust again
