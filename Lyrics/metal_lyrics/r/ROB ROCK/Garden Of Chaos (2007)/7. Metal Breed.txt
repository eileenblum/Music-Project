I could hear the metal rising
From the land across the sea
A wave of thunder in the darkness
Grinding rhythm, scorching steel
FM radio was rockinï¿½
Building armies on the air

Revolution that is still evolving
Standing tall the metal breed
Generations of the anvil pounding
You canï¿½t kill the Metal Breed

Burning up the next frontier
Images that stir your mind
Moving pictures with the music
Winning masses all the time
Music television rockinï¿½
Legions turning in the show

Revolution that is still evolving
Standing tall the metal breed
Generations of the anvil pounding
You canï¿½t kill the Metal Breed

Digital now cast in concrete
Spreading out like a disease
Every download on computer
Exhilarate the metal scene

Revolution that is still evolving
Standing tall the metal breed
Generations of the anvil pounding
You canï¿½t kill the Metal Breed
