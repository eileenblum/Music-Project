One breath of life
I will never be the same
With your open eyes
Everything Iï¿½ve known has changed

Lying beside you now Iï¿½m lost in a dream
All of my past has faded now that you breathe

Tiny miracle
Youï¿½re depending upon me
My gift from above
Your innocence so sweet

With every new day dawning, the joy it will bring
With every step take now, a new world opens
