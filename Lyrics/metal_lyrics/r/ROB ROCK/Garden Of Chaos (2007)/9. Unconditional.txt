Some words are never spoken,
some  feelings never shown
But in my eyes youï¿½re perfect
and all my heart you own
No matter what reason,
doesnï¿½t matter what you do
Thereï¿½s nothing that can make me walk away

I will fight the coldest winter and pray until
the sun shines on our face
My love for you is so much more than feelings now
You can count on me to always be there

No matter what we face together
No matter what the hand of fate
Just remember Iï¿½ll be standing there
My love is unconditional

You know thereï¿½s time of sadness,
anger, doubt, despair
But donï¿½t forget the good times
and the promise we share
Cherishing the moments, whatever life may bring
Youï¿½ll always have the hand of your best friend

I donï¿½t care which way the wind blows, because
weï¿½ve got something no one else an know
When seasons change I never want you doubting me
I will always be there to stand by your side

No matter what we face together
No matter what the hand of fate
Just remember Iï¿½ll be standing there
My love is unconditional
- Unconditional
