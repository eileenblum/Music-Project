I can't believe all the time that passed between our lives 
Just yesterday it was a dream too far to come true 
I've fallen for the last time, I can see the sun it's in your eyes 
I've waited for a lifetime just to have you here by my side 

In the night, I feel you hold me tight 
I feel my love's alive, as you're taking me through the night 

Taken for granted, taken for a ride across that line 
Into the crossfire between body, soul, and you're mind 
Emotion is a fine line, you can be deceived when you spill the wine 
Blinded by a compromise, you can throw away so much time 

But we can make a run for heaven now 

In the night, I feel you hold me tight 
I feel my love's alive, as you're taking me through the night 
In your eyes I see there's no disguise and now I realize 
That I finally found paradise 

In the night 

In the night 
I've fallen for the last time 
I've waited for a lifetime 
Blinded by a compromise 
Taking me through the night
