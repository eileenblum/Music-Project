Headlines, staring in your face, trying to catch your eye 
Question, words upon the page only criticize 

Speculation dramatized 

Media Machine 
It's an evil in disguise 
Media Machine 
Your privacy denied 
Media Machine 

Deception, an angle on the scene selling magazines 
Perception, revealing what to see on your TV screen 

Rich and famous pay the price 

Media Machine 
It's an evil in disguise 
Media Machine 
Your privacy denied 
Media Machine 
Reputation on the line 
Media Machine 
The public will decide 

Put on a spin and open wide 
Sympathy or victimize 

Media Machine 
Expose the darkest side 
Media Machine 
Manipulate the lines 
Media Machine 
Investigate the crime 
Media Machine 
Discretion left behind 
Media Machine 
You've seen it all before 
Media Machine 
Still you want some more 
Yea, eat it up!
