Now; now that you have gone away 
Where will you run, where will you stay? 
You know you've been hiding for so long 
See; see all the love you left behind 
Leaving you stranded all alone 
What will you do your lost and lonely 

Caught, caught in a web of sin again 
I was so blind like you I ran 
Somehow I found the light to guide my way.... 

After all that we've been through 
Love of my life, I will remember you 

Forever, Forever 
Forever, Love of my life 

Fear; fear all the things that you once knew 
Trapped in a hell lying to you 
Trying to keep you from the only truth 
Take; take what you want it's your own choice 
And after all we hear this voice 
Because we've found a love that just won't go away.... 

After all that we've been through 
Love of my life, Lord, I long to be with you 

Forever, Forever 
Forever, Love of my life 
Forever, Forever 
Forever, Love of my life 

Now, now that you have gone away 
Where will you run, where will you stay? 
You know you've been hiding for so long 

Forever, Forever 
Forever, Love of my life 
Forever, Forever 
Forever, Love of my life 

Forever... 
It was your grace that fell on me 
Now your love has set me free 
Forever... 
Forever, Love of my life... 
Forever, Forever... 
Forever
