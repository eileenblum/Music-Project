You've got to break from the past 
You've got to leave it behind you 
You know the feeling won't last 
Don't let emotions confine you 

No matter what we have to face 
The sun will shine again 
Although the scars will leave a trace 
The sun will rise again 

Just like a killer of time 
Don't let depression define you 
You've got to make up your mind 
Now it's your turn to fly 

No matter what we have to face 
The sun will shine again 
Although the scars will leave a trace 
The sun will rise again 

You know that life isn't fair 
Nobody owes you tomorrow 
You're in the pit of despair 
Turn the page on your sorrow 

No matter what we have to face 
The sun will shine again 
Although the scars will leave a trace 
The sun will rise again 
It's time to turn another page 
The sun will shine again 
Somehow this too shall pass away 
The sun will rise again
