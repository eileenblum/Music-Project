You come unraveled at the slightest glance 
I'd like to go but I can't take the chance 
Your crazy love's got a power trip on me 
Tell me something, show me how you feel 
Imagination gets the best of me 
Every breath on the edge is so surreal 

All I need is you to drive me insane because 
All I want is you to love me again and again 

Your cold emotions got me wild and tense 
I got my guard up but it's no defense 
Just help me find the way to read your mind 
It's never easy 'cuz you make it hard 
Communication like a house of cards 
Takes everything I've got to keep a hold on you 

All I need is you, you drive me insane because 
All I want is you, to love me again 
All I need is you, don't lead me astray because  
All I want is you, to hold me again 

All I need is you, you drive me insane 
All I want is you, don't lead me astray 
All I need is you, you drive me insane because 
All I want is you, don't treat me this way 
All I need is you, come on love me again 
All I want is you, you're all that I need in my heart.
