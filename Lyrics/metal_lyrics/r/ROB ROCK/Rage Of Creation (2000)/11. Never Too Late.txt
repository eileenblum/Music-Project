By your broken words, I feel your tables turn 
Don't try to feed me with your lies 
By the way you talk, I'd say you need a friend 
It's time to throw off your disguise 

It's never too late to start again 
You'll find the answers in your heart 
It's never too late to turn away 
From all those things that do you wrong 

You need to be yourself, see who you really are 
So decide what you want to do 
Only you can tell what you need to be free 
Don't want to go on playing the fool 

It's never too late to start again 
You'll find the answers in your heart 
It's never too late to turn away 
From all those things that do you wrong 

You think you got it made, you better take a look 
Because you can't hide what's in your eyes 

It's never too late to start again 
You'll find the answers in your heart 
It's never too late to turn away 
From all those things that do you wrong 

It's never too late to start again 
You'll find the answers in your heart 
It's never too late to turn away 
From all those things that do you wrong
