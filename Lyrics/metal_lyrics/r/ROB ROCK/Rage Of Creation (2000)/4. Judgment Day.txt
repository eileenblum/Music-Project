Violence, wrath and chaos 
Blood fills the street 
Generals lead their masses 
Children at their feet 

Judgment Day 
Will the sun refuse to shine 
Judgment Day 
When the stars fall from the sky

Come Armageddon 
The woman rides the beast 
Wisdom from the heavens 
Anger, plagues, disease 

Judgment Day 
When the stars fall from the sky 
Judgment Day 
Good and evil will collide 
Judgment Day 
There's a rider on the storm 
Judgment Day 
Bringing justice and the sword 

Kings of earth are unclean 
Babylon demon seed 
Riches, splendor, blinded by her luxuries 

Lead the nations astray 
Kill the prophets and saints 
Deluded and fallen, the mark of the beast 

The beast and the dragon are false 
Weeping and mourning cry out 
Scavengers feast, eating your flesh 

Judgment Day 
When the stars fall from the sky 
Judgment Day 
Good and evil will collide 
Judgment Day 
There's a rider on the storm 
Judgment Day 
Bringing justice and the sword
