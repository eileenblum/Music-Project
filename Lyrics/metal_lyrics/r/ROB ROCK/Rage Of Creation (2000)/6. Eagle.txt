[ABBA Cover]

They came flying from far away 
Now I'm under their spell 
I love hearing the stories that they tell 

They've seen places beyond my land 
And they found new horizons 
They speak strangely but I understand 

And I dream I'm an eagle 
And I dream I can spread my wings 

Flying high, high, like a bird in the sky 
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze 
High, high, what a feeling to fly 
Over mountains and forests and seas 
And to go anywhere that I please 

I saw good friends we talked all night 
And we fly wing to wing 
I have questions and they know everything 

There's no limit to what I feel 
We climb higher and higher 
Am I dreaming or is this all real? 

And I dream I'm an eagle? 
Is it true I can spread my wings? 

Flying high, high, like a bird in the sky 
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze 
High, high, what a feeling to fly 
Over mountains and forests and seas 
And to go anywhere that I please 

Is it true I'm an eagle? 
Is it true I can spread my wings? 

Flying high, high, like a bird in the sky 
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze 
High, high, what a feeling to fly 
Over mountains and forests and seas 

High, high, like a bird in the sky 
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze 
High, high, what a feeling to fly 
Over mountains and forests and seas 
And to go anywhere that I please...
