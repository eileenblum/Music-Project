Liar, selling you lies from the start 
Deceiver, feeding on you like a shark 
See it coming, feel it breaking you down 
Time is running, wasting away for so long 

There's only one way out 
Tear down the walls that cover your mind 
One way out 
Open your eyes to the lies 

Seeker, you search for the meaning of life 
Changes, waiting for you to ignite 
See it coming, feel it burning your soul 
Tide is turning, leaving you out in the cold 

There's only one way out 
Tear down the walls and open your mind 
One way out 
Leave all this mayhem behind 

One way out 
Tear down the walls that cover your mind 
One way out 
Open your eyes to the lies 
One way out 
Tear down the walls that color your mind 
One way out 
Leave all this mayhem behind 
One Way Out!!!
