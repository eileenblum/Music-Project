Voices in the shadows, whispers in the night 
Telling him that vengeance will make everything all right 
Tortured as a child, condemned by all his peers 
Thoughts that have no reason and a heart that's full of fear 

Caught between denial and delusions of his mind 
No mercy in the system, there's no place left to hide 
Crazy like an angel who has fallen from on high 
Filled with rage and violence, he will not be denied 

A twisted world of killing and crime 
The handiwork of Lucifer's kind 

On the streets of madness 
The predator rules, stalking the night 
On the streets of madness 
The demons alive 

Gaze into the valley, the valley of your greed 
Where money is the master, holding all the keys 
No time to raise the children, they're drowning in the sea 
Everyone's a victim in the city full of dreams 

A twisted world of flesh and desire 
The handiwork of Lucifer's choir 

On the streets of madness 
The predator rules, stalking the night 
On the streets of madness 
The demons alive 
On the streets of madness 
A sweet appetite for taking a life 
On the streets of madness 
Demons will rise 

Voices in the shadows, whispers in the night 
Telling him that vengeance will make everything all right  

On the streets of madness 
The predator rules, stalking the night 
On the streets of madness 
The demons alive 

On the streets of madness 
A sweet appetite for taking a life 
On the streets of madness 
Demons will rise 

Ruling the night, with killings and crime  
On the streets of madness
