You said you're sorry for what you did, but in the pain I will not fit...
I have to suffer until I die but you will never see me cry...
I've suffered long enough watching your face, staring into my eyes telling your lies
Can't you feel my hatred tearing apart?
You will never see me cry I will not die.
