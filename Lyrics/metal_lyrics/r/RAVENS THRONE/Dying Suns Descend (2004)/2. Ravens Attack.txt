Death will come to your nations; light of sun will fade until its dark
Ravens Throne body eaters, drink your blood and snatch your guts apart
Night falls sharp as sward the thrown in malice from a devil's hand
You shall see the hell and suffer by our teeth in your taste flesh
We can fly high and higher, our cult and sons they will attack...
Ravens throat bloody, bitter, brings the fog and misty wings will shine...
As the darkness enlightens our ways, your souls will stay so restless forever you shall pain for every move you make
Death will come to your nations; light of sun will fade until its dark
Ravens Throne body eaters, drink your blood and snatch your guts apart

Nightful shock has spread the throne the glory made of our hands
Tearing out the ultimate skies by our deadly grimy eyes.
