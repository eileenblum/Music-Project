Slay in such of hatred, and let the bodies flow and burn 'em when nearly alive.
Pay for all the tragedies, for all the misery when my life was really aside.
And seek the darkness and let the winds of revenge blow them all away .
In empty blackness avenge your sadness and make them really cry.
In darkness ... betrayals [x3]
Bring 'em all burn them down!!!
DIE!!!!
