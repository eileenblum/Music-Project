The gloomy winter up north has just begun, since the eternity of the frozen ones.
Underneath the north side a frosty night, filled with creatures the demon owned.
They'll fly ... to the winds of the upper skies
cry ... until your tears become a frozen ice
Freeze ... in the unlimited oceans of the snow
Born ... to be tortured by the ravenÂs might
Crows never crawl they are always high, and darker then the ebony night
Fly and be as always so high,
With rage and hate that rising in the heart
Cried until you tears became a stony ice
Wings are as sharp as a silver blade
Fly ... to the northern winds of the upper skies
Fly and be as always so high,
With rage and hate that rising in the heart
Wings are as sharp as a silver blade
