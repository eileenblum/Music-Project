[Music / Lyrics by Zymolust Ravenson]

As hearts entomb a twilight fall
Of pure enrages
A grim, dulcet, mute darkness

An overture embraces mure
Reflects a pulsing moon
At rise revelation cruel

For underworld burning in cold
Ruins that hold verses unfold
A storm that calls them all
Inflames of roaring fire
Shall burn with all desire

Dark!!

Inspire demolition reverence
Invoking mythological Phases
Of death horn-head retraces
The flesh  of man...

Forces of hell in hand
Damnation arrival demand
Arises From abyss to stand...
