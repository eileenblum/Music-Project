[Music / Lyrics by Zymolust Ravenson]

Utter night to the lowest point again...
Freeze in dark old void in pain
Like a black robe of rime together, that enfolds a heart forever

Enclose to the Essenes of life... creatures no longer alive
In lights of day through time... drowning in doom, in demise
Sorrow come forth, grim to me, we shall never part in misery
While grief hold us to inner gate
We dope our souls in blackened fate

Roving writhe to cold agony
Deep inside the bowls never-be
Collapsing veins that carry a black blood delight
Disguise of carnal thoughts that brought grave-head to die
Defined the terms of destiny by time

Blackened Heart of Grief!

Enclose to the Essenes of life... creatures no longer alive
In lights of day through time... drowning in doom, in demise
Sorrow come forth, grim to me, we shall never part in misery
While grief hold us to inner gate
We dope our souls in blackened fate

Traduce my tar that runs in me
Forever held in chest of blackened heart of grief
