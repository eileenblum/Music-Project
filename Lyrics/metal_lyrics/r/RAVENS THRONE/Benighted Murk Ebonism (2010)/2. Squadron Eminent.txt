[Music by Zymolust Ravenson / Zakaraya, Lyrics by Zymolust Ravenson]

Riders through darkness
Roamers of the unrevealed
Tales of the ancients
invaders of the upper fields
Rook as ravens loom, explode the hearts ahead of thee
War! Dominate terranes beyond
inflect the steel
inflame the depths of darkened fear
swords in throats spill the blood of enemies
crowds on their knees spit the blood of agonies
rule with a fist of iron conquer lands destroy, defeat...
Sharpen blades of fate snatch the limbs , rebel as doom

tyrants of darkness...  revealers of the unrevealed
tales became legends... breakers of the mountain sealed
cruel ravens doom ,crash the hearts heads to be
thorn in the throat of realms beyond
with swords of steel
we bring winter's storms
