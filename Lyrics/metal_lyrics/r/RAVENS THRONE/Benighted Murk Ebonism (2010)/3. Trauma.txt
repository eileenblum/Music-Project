[Music / Lyrics by Zymolust Ravenson]

Flaming skies above in sight
flaming dome extracts away
Haunted Jackals brought the night
haunted castles turned to clay
served decline direction falls
I, to die in shroudless grave

waves descend from the mount of roaring darkness
stars extend till the moment of total blackness

Senseless illusions, observing my mind
End of conclusions, for now I shall fly...
Death oh! My Shelter, embrace me and sigh
Dimensions
of last devoiced vengeance
Columns of storm that clashes
Turns my wings to ashes
Trauma
At last now defined

Flee the soil underneath my claws
Weep the trees that stood to fall
Ages of insanity across the endless ocean of days
Reflection of my life of no existence
inception for this life of no Resistance

waves descend from the mount of roaring darkness
stars extend till the moment of total blackness

Falling sky above  entwined
falling doom is here to stay
Hunting demons won the fight
Holding past in one-word say
servants in lines to fall in hole

I have died as life was given
