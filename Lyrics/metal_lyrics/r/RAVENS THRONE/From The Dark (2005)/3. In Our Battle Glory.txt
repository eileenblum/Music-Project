[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

Long ago evil fought (Vulgard) the wolf, the king of northern hills,
Again evil rose from east, led by fighter faster then death, riding the horses of might.

(Keiatl) the black conquered with mayhem, fought and won,
(Vulgard) died with honor.

Long ago evil fought (Vulgard) the wolf, the king of northern hills,
Again evil rose from east, led by fighter faster then death, riding the horses of might.

(Keiatl) the black conquered with mayhem, fought and won,
(Vulgard) died with honor.

(Kjarten) the son no one ever sow was meant to be a warrior,
Escaped with tide to west, armed with the ghost sword.

Oathed on his fatherâs blood to revenge... [x2]

(Magnus) has the gift of prophecy, apocalypted scarred knight with ghost sword
When (Kjarten) suddenly appeared.
(Magnus) sacrificed, (Gunnar) taught him to be a wolf on battlefield.

Oathed on his fatherâs blood to revenge... [x2]

When the time came (Keiatl) was faced by ultimate gust of fire, from (Kjartenâs) eyes.
Sky went gloom, ground shacked, a war of darkness.

(VULGARD) ... you are avenged
