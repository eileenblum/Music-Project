[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

A blindness through total darkness, rotten coffin embracing dust
Infinity of death insanity, brutality to rip the guts
Desirefull thought as hunger for flesh and bones goes more
Hanging corps on rusty hook to taste the smell to hear the worms
Raped carcass laying naked discharging burning lust
Embryonic body was fed its own heart

Ravenous ravens swallowing vomit, crunching skulls of dying men
A dissected liver was bitten row monstrously, when the brain was taken fresh
And fed to the most aggressive reptile.

The thirst for blood theory
The thirst for blood theory, explosion of vein volcane
