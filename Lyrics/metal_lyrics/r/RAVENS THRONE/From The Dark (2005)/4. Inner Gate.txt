[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

Cast your self into the stormy flames of growing darkness inside,
Seek an entrance through your cryptic soul the black choice is thine.

Kindle dusky heart and free your soul to an endless journey time,
Reflection like a midnight sky deformed with a burning lights,
Slide deep... more deep, strait path to another world.

Giant gate with carved spells upon, a symbols and signs of death
Suicidal thoughts that comes for an absolute form of life.

Reach eternity... fly free... to the dim... of void infinity.

Cast your self into the stormy flames of growing darkness inside,
Seek an entrance through your cryptic soul the black choice is thine.
