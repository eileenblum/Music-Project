[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

Grimly landed from dark unto mankind world as storm...
Chosen day has come to lead the mighty war...
With the eyes of evil like an access to hell,
Falling sun forever destroyed....... destroyed

Starving wearwolfs are guided by rage, unleashed through the forest of darkness.
Cruelty Iâm waiting embracing black soul,
Shattered voices in the air like a hurricane at horizon.

Doused night sky revelating evil, screams of dead winds cracked the moon,
Damned earth is burning like a virgin from an atrotic rape.

Shadows flows over the ruins lakes of destruction,
Dark, gloom, and fear spread all over the land.

Chained... you will be chained by fate as slaves bearing our silver thrones
Suffer you will never save the daylight that we killed by darkness swords.
Tyrantly we will reign the falling kingdoms at our feet.
Strongly hit the fist of steel, the invincible are defeated.

Chained... you will be chained by fate as slaves bearing our silver thrones
Strongly hit the fist of steel, the invincible are defeated.

Grimly landed from dark unto mankind world as storm...
Chosen day has come to lead the mighty war..
With the eyes of evil like an access to hell,
Falling sun forever destroyed....... destroyed
