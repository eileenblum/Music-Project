[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

Thundering sky for Aeons, gathered creatures summoning black winds eternally.
Powered with lust and frost, the end begun.

Realms come forth built by darkness powers, a time for our race to domain.

Awaiting land for chaos, synoptic massacres, decay embrace humans

Impaled on our spikes and cast out through the mighty wrath of us.

Hear cold fire screams out with echoes all lives shall mort.
Blown souls and spirits tortured in empty cold silent void.

We spread decease among thee sue, beseech for death.
Feel the swords passing through your neck and taste the steel.

All those eons we fought, into a battle that we already won.
Let the frost at horizon preach our arrival... on winter wings.

Gloom covered the frozen sun and left forsaken forever.
Shattering stars falling to tear the earth asunder.

Realms come forth built by darkness powers, a time for our race to domain.

Hear cold fire screams out with echoes all lives shall mort.
Blown souls and spirits tortured in empty cold silent void.
