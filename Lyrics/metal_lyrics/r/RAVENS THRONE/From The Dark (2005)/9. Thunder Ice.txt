[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

The gloomy winter up north has just begun, since the eternity of the frozen ones.
Underneath the north side a frosty night, filled with creatures the demon owned.

They will fly... to the northern winds of the upper skies
You will cry... until your tears become a frozen ice
Freeze... in the unlimited oceans of the snow
Born... to be tortured by the ravenâs might

Crows never crawl they are always high, and darker then the ebony night
Freezing light shines from the sky... thunder ice

Fly and be as always so high,
With rage and hate that rising in the heart
And wings are as sharp as a silver blade

Fly and be as always so high,
With rage and hate that rising in the heart
You cried until your tears became a stony ice
And wings are as sharp as a silver blade
