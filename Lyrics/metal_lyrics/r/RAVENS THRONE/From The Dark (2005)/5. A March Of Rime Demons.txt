[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

Winter demons march to ruin across the earth, to destroy the nations.
Descending at north followed by a storm, creeping Armageddon.

Death raise and shine into the sky, decline is the only straight line.

Winter demons rise, as might frozen wave far beyond the oceans,
Ruling from the north, flooding demons roam, crawling darkness comes.

Death lays through there veins as cosmic sparks and sin of all into a vice.

Hit the claws as spears smash the land with fears.
Abandon what passed with tears...
Change the face of earth unto a black ground of fire.

Motherland has sent the greatest myth of all time.
Frost shall reign the stars, the winds, the seas.

Hit the claws as spears smash the land with fears.
Abandon what passed with tears...
Change the face of earth unto a black ground of fire.

Winter demons march to ruin across the earth, to destroy the nations.
Descending at north followed by a storm, creeping Armageddon.

Death raise and shine into the sky, decline is the only straight line.
