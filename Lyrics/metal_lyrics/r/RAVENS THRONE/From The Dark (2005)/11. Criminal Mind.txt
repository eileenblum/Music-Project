[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

Diving in to the criminal mind when he decide
To take a human life with all the pleasure and no regrets
Roaming all the day and night to find his prey to die
A flashing flames within the eyes showing desire to kill

This day will come again
And never forget...

Rip the skin and cleave the flesh
Crash the bones inch by inch
Rise the axe and off the heads
And let the hummer fall

Rip the skin and cleave the flesh
Crash the bones inch by inch
Rise the axe and off the heads
And let the hummer fall

This day will come again
And never do you forget
The grimy evil grains
Cold is the blood

This day will come again
And never do you forget
The grimy evil grains
Cold is the blood

Every victim by fear was blind
Captured for ever inside this mind
The only rule is kill or die
The criminal that I mentioned was ME...
