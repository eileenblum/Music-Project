[Music / lyrics: Zymolust]

Death will come to your nation; light of sun will fade until itâs dark...
RAVENS THRONE body eaters drink your blood and snatch your guts apart...

Night falls sharp as sword that thrown in malice from a devils hand...
You shall see the hell and suffer by our teeth in your tasty flesh

We can fly high and higher, our cult and sons will attack
Ravenâs throat bloody, bitter brings the fog and misty wings will shine...

Night falls sharp as sword that thrown in malice from a devils hand...
You shall see the hell and suffer by our teeth in your tasty flesh

As the darkness light our way, your souls will stay so restless
Forever you shall pain for every move you make.

Death will come to your nation; light of sun will fade until it's dark...
RAVENS THRONE body eaters drink your blood and snatch your guts apart...

Nightfull shock has set the throne the glory made of our hands...
Tearing out the ultimate skies by our deadly grimy eyes...
