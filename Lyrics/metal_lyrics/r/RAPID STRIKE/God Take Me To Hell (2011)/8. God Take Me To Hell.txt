Oh God please help me...someone died by my hand
It seems so unreal...it could be a dream
But I have just seen...blood on my hands
There's blood all around me...and pain in my eyes

Oh God what is happening to me?
Am I cursed by this bloody fate?!
If you ain't my home
Then my home is in hell

Leave the cursed soul
Leave me in my pain
Take me home
God take me to hell

I'm destined for more to kill
In this circle of the damned you wish you were never born
You pray for the end to come
But still glad to be alive in this infernal battlefield
It wants me, calling me, can't you hear
Can't you hear DESTRUCTION!!!

I hold my AK firmly, wildly pressing on the trigger
Killing dozen in one burst and the number's getting bigger
In these moments I can only feel the hate
Now I understand - God you ain't my fate

Leave the cursed soul
Leave me in my pain
Take me home
God take me to hell
