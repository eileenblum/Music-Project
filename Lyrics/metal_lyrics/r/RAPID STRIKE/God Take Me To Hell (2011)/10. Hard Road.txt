When everybody leaves you
And you stay alone
Forsaken in the dark
And nobody asks where you are
That is hard
That is hard

Then you live a hard life
Drive on a hard road

And then you find an old friend
Oh yeah, a fucking little demon
Alcohol
A friend which gives you strength
To go out and find the action
Satisfaction
I must see her!

I see you baby will you come
I'm drunk and I'm blind
This is only for one night
It will be fast
Come on baby be my sin
Come on baby let me in
You want me, yeah I know
Join me in my game
Don't be scared honey
Let's go!

Left aside, standing in silence
Trying to find the answers to how things got so wrong
Forgotten, he desperately struggles to find a way out
Lights start to fade and the road slowly disappears
Lost in the darkness, his mind is shattered
His mind is shattered of loneliness
And insanity fills the emptiness inside

Don't go baby, don't you run away
Don't leave me, you can save me
I don't want to be alone
With dark mind, my head will explode
I need something to heal me
Where is the friend?!

Then you find an old friend
Oh yeah, a fucking little demon
Then you live a hard life
Drive on a hard road
On the road
Drive on the hard road
