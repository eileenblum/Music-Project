Hey stranger, what do you say
You can't live of headache or your inside pain
You got a bitter side of life doesn't it feel like sitting on a knife
Your life is so hard and who can you blame
Come with us stranger into the tomb of pain

Won't you come and you'll see
There's no more honesty
All becomes a lie when the truth we deny

Tomb of pain is our real home
Greed and treatury - the life as we know
Tomb of pain for everyone to go
Tomb of pain - life that's in sorrow

Surrounded you are with bloody gore
Cheap souls want your money and nothing more
Every man for himself, it's crystal clear
Trust is the word you won't find here
They want your fame and to who can you blame
Come with us stranger into the tomb of pain

Won't you come and you'll see
There's no more honesty
All becomes a lie when the truth we deny

Tomb of pain is our real home
Greed and treatury - the life as we know
Tomb of pain for everyone to go
Tomb of pain - life that's in sorrow

Who has the right to intervene in other people's lives
Who has the right to take what they want
When they want, from whom they want
No one!
Still, many do
So, one has a choice; to let it be
Or to brake their fucking grasping hands and say
FUCK OFF!

They come to steal - stop 'em
And if they try - crush 'em
They come to kill - kill 'em
To their fate seal 'em
