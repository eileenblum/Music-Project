People are leaving, in tears they leave their land
War has been raging for a while now
I can't understand
Everything perished in the flames of burning cities
No life than show
Aggression shows no pity

We won't go away, we stay
We belong here with our fathers
We won't go away, we stay
Together to the end we're fighting

Numerous battles taking numerous lives
Welcomed the nineties with screams and cries
Innocent dying, no sense to this shame
Forces of peace cowardly spectate
And the terror stays the same

We won't go away, we stay
We belong here with our brothers
We won't go away, we stay
Together to the end we

Fight, fight
It may be the last but we will
Fight, fight
Till the wounds make us kneel
Fight, fight
To fail is worse than death
Fight, fight
The stage to strike back is set

The storm is coming
It's coming
Freedom!
