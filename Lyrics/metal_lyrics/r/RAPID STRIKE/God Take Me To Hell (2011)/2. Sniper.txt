I'm a hitman that's what I do, don't look for me - I'll come to you
If you got a job that needs my skill - show me the money and I'm in for a kill

Just gimme the name of the one who'll die
And I promise you - his life is mine
You don't want to get blood on your fists
And for me he's just another name on the list

When my aim is focused on your head
Kiss your ass goodbye - you're dead
Be still and try not to make a mess
You know the outcome and you can't change it

My steps are silent, you never know I'm there
Where ever you are better beware
I never stop - keep that in mind
Cause I'm being payed for you to find

My eyes are sharp - never lose your  trace
When the time is right I'll shoot your face
One bullet fired from the far distance
Ensures my prize and kills you in an instance

When my aim is focused on your head
Kiss your ass goodbye - you're dead
Be still and try not to make a mess
You know the outcome and you can't change it

Killer eyes of mine staring at you
Watching closely at everything you do
Twisted mind preparing for action
Insane act that drives my passion
Darkened street - my stalking place
You can run but my gun will chase
Look around I'm surely near
Death's silent presence is here

I'm gonna kill you
I'm gonna track you down and shoot you like a dog
You're mine
One bullet - you're dead
Two bullets - in the head
Three bullets - for the fun
Four and five to empty my gun

Sniper!

When my aim is focused on your head
Kiss your ass goodbye-you're dead
Be still and try not to make a mess
You know the outcome and you can't change it
