Near is the end, gunfire began
Fear starts to spread in the city of Vukovar
Bombs start to fall, tanks begin to roll
But we stay here to protect our homes

With honor and pride we defend our country from them
Serbs and their might, butchers killing in the name of
God, slaying everyone in their path, until death
Becomes my bride I will stay to defend what is mine

Scent of death in the air
See the blood, feel the pain
Memory remains of this place
In my home, in my grave

The fight goes on, we stay and we won't fall
Brave are the ones who defend their town
Many have died, reinforcements have not arrived
Defenses are breached and the terror is here

The fall of '91, slayers some into our town
Blackened souls with hearts of coal and stone
Run if you can, they will kill everyone with
Croatian blood, remember our dead and honor them to your grave

Scent of death in the air
See the blood, feel the pain
Memory remains of this place
In my home, in my grave
Mothers cry, their sons have died
Feel the pain, feel ashamed

Coming to get you, they won't spare you, don't beg, you better run
Moon is full, shining the blood like a witness to what they've done
Slaughter is here in the streets, women scream, they feel no guilt
We will haunt them, in their sleep for they deeds, until they see

Scent of death in the air
See the blood, feel the pain
Memory remains of this place
In my home, in my grave
