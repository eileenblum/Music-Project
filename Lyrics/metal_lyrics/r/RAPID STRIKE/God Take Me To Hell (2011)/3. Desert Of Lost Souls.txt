Lost but never found, thought that there can't be enough
Believed in sanity, joined with vanity
Eyes opening to temptation of greed, eternal disbelief
Always wishing for more, desire stronger than the mind

They couldn't see that it's not theirs to take
Always repeating the same mistakes
Thinking it can never go wrong
Joining the others in the desert of lost souls
As they sailed the sea of greed
Winds started to carry them around
Wandering in wealth they stole
Sailing further away from the sun

Caught in the sound of gold insanity
The lost souls praise their material lords
Living illusion of reality
Misery of their life, never satisfied with what they have
Eyes opened to temptation of greed, trapped eternally
Wishing forever more, cursed their own mind

They couldn't see that it's not theirs to take
Always repeating the same mistakes
Thinking it can never go wrong
Joining the others in the desert of lost souls
As they sailed the sea of greed
Winds started to carry them around
Wandering in wealth they stole
Sailing further away from the sun
Spread their emptiness through the past
Infecting history fast
Now we see just what they've done
Left the desert to their sons

They couldn't see that it's not theirs to take
Always repeating the same mistakes
Thinking it can never go wrong
Joining the others in the desert of lost souls
As they sailed the sea of greed
Winds started to carry them around
Before it's too late catch the sun
