On trough the dead of night, armies march into the fight
Mothers pray in the morning sun, preaches pray for the end of life
Children cry in the eve of dawn, global panic-fear in our eyes
Sinners laugh and martyrs die, chaos of Armageddon will arise

In my dreams I see the beast, it's seven heads are looking at me
Eyes filled with rage, spawning hell fire on the good and brave
Nothing can stop this demon from hell, destruction and madness take command
Famine, plague, obsession and woe, world trapped in the holy war

No one can stop this terror of damned
Not even God that forgot about us
Listen, why are the bombs falling from skies?!
Why are we slaves of corruption and might

Genocidal nature of human kind, total defeat of our selfish mind
Rotting carcass shows us the sign âHello and welcome to paradiseâ
Great leaders play their games, war to the east-peace to the west
Manipulate the poor-promise the best, kill all opposing and bribe the rest

Hey God is this your plan?! To let us suffer, is it all that you can?!
People die in front of your eyes, maybe you are just a sadist in disguise!
The end is getting near, all life is soon seizing to exist
And in the final scene-the skies will burn!

No one can stop this terror of damned
Not even God that forgot about us
Listen, why are the bombs falling from skies?!
Why are we slaves of corruption and might

Might!
