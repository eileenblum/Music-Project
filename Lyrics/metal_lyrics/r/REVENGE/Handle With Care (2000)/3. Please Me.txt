I'm like the falling rain
Passing dry to wet
Falling you down
I'm just a poison on your lips

I'm like the shining sun
Burning skins at day
And hiding on
I'm like the devil at your side

I said "please"
Are you down and on with me
I said "please"
I'll be there and nice tonight

I'm gonna make you please me

I'm not the man I want
Sometimes I'm wrong
I just can't find the words
To make you understand

I try so hard again
Difficult to me
So many changes in my mind
I want your help
