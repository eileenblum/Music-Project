I was joking
With my sorrows
Always hanging
On tomorrow

I've been crying
Just a million tears away
When I found out
People start to talk
Try to tell me
There's no way for me in the world

I've been crying
Just a million tears away
I've been searching
Just a million times again

Only need a fortress
When we could be all alone
Find a place to reach
The summum of your love
I'm in loving
I'll be loving
I mean loving you tonight

I'm a strong man
But it's all so much
Never thought it
But it can't be so cruel

I've been crying
just a million tears away
I've been travelling
Just a million miles away

Just be loving you

Another day
Another day for love

Another day
Gonna make you understand
It'll be so nice
If we could be all alone
