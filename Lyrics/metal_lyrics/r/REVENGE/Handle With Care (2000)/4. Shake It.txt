Lost in the world
No one else by your side
"Hold on to what you believe"
Feeling dispressed
Don't know what to do
"Hold on to what you trust in"

Good days gonna be
Coming soon
If there's something
That you can't stand it more
Got to

Shake it, shake it, shake it

If there's something
That is bad
You've got to

Shake it, shake it, shake it
No one's gonna make it
Just for you

Sometimes you're good
Sometimes you're bad
"Hold on to what you believe"
Don't let your mind
Lower and lower
"Hold on to what you trust in"

You're dreaming of sometimes
When love is so nice
When the night is so sweet
It's not so far
If you really want it
You have it on your smile
And got to
Shake it
