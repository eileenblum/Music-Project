She was hot inside
Every day and night
Can't stop running wild
Get some appetite
For a little child
That's she can't deny

In her dreams
Treated boys
Looking good
Never gettin' nicer
She's got more loving

When she's having a boy
And when he's younger
An easy prowl
For an innocent mind
That's why she wants to get a little

Nasty
Nasty for boys
Even when he's younger
Nasty
Nasty for boys
Even when it's harder
Everytime he's younger

But one day she left
On a stronger man
That she couldn't beat
Get some appetite
For a little girl
That she couldn't fight
