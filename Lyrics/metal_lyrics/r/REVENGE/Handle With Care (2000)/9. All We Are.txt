I've told you once, twice
All the time
Can't you understand
There's nothing that we all
Can satisfy
One step at one time
Can you do it fast
There's nothing that we all
Can do it good

In the band, you're feeling strong
In the night we strut
You can't feel right around
The world
And you make it right

All we are
Devils, killers
All we are
Angel of death
All we are
Nightmare warriors
All we are
And you care, godspell

You wear your straight
Black leather glove
Raise your fist and yell
Every arm is following you on

Night black metal bike
Under scary eyes
Feeling like the lightning
In the storm
