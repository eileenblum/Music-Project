I'm just trying to make you realize
I'm not the man that it seems
I'm not a perfect mind
But there is one thing I know

My love is sincere at all
I'm speaking honestly
Taking my hand
Let's be starting all again
Just one shout
Just one shout for love

Glorified, you don't need
a million lies
You just have to make it right
And you'll be by my side
Glorified, we don't need
another fight
You just have to make it right
And you'll be by my side
Glorified

It's not so easy everyday
I just can't play
You've got to trust me baby
'cause I've told you once
My love is sincere at all
Don't need another lie
Taking my hand
Let's be starting all from the start
