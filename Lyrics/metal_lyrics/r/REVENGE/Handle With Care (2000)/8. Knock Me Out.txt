You were the fire of love
You were searching
For someone to love

You were the fire inside
You were dreaming
Of somewhere to hide
No time to waste
No pleasure left
No one can make it
The way that you want it

Knock me out
Everyday
Knock me out
It's just another pain
Knock me out
Every way
Knock me out, knock me out

I have been lost on my way
I've been searching for
Someone to love
I wanted you deep inside
Injuries seems to make me feel right

I was hungry tonight
To make up your mind in your eyes
I was hungry tonight
I was hungry for love
