I'm gonna make you feel right
Until the end of time
I'm gonna make you seem bright
Like a shining star

Good love this is what I need
Make you shiver and shake
Good good loving
Give me all you've got tonight

Cum'on and open your eyes
I can't get enough

I'm gonna make you feel sad
Between love and hate
Seems like I've never been bad
If it's not too late

Gonna make you right
Gonna make you shine
