Now the new demonic age
The locust of hell jumped
Victimized: Iâm the calculated design
To bring this empire to mass destruction

Holy place is burned
By the human idiocy
They lured to cryptic prophecies
And Iâll be served

Baptized alive, baptized to death

I'm the chaos
I'm the son of impurity
Duality of demon and human

The endless diabolical mind
Manifest an apocalyptical (thoughts)
Incineration of all the truth
Youâre gonna die

Ah the fallen angel come to me to fill this world with apocalypse
Show them the blind world,fill this world with hate

I'm the one who denied your God
I'm the one who kill your priest
I'm the one who deceive
I'm the one that you wont embrace

Holy place is burned
By the human idiocy
They lured to cryptic prophecies
And Iâll be served

Baptized alive, baptized to death
Though Iâm the reincarnation of black God

And Iâll be served
And Iâll be served
And Iâll be served
And Iâll be served!
