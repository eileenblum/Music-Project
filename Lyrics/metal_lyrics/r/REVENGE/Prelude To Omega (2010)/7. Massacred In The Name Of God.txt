Here it comes, the immortal army of god
Perish the mortal, slaying immortal
Hoping a senseless savior, the knight of the untold apocalypse

All running, screaming ,praising
Their worthless god

They who run their demise, are dying fast
They who make their own god, are tortured

We are all humankind, crawling under the sin that we create it
And finding our merit that slaughtered in the past

Those whom the One detest, they putrefacted in their own hell
Those whom the One detest, are die in Death!

No one are gonna save from
This catastrophic world
No one are gonna save from
This eradication triumph

Fidelity of the true One
Kill their mind
Memorized
And mortality

Horde of seven dimension
Crumbling out from the sky
Without words soul ripped apart
And taken to the altar of death

Immortal army of God

Massacred in the name of God
We will sink in mortality
Massacred in the name of God
The earth is our grave and we die in here
Massacred in the name of God
Prophecies becoming real
Massacred in the name of God
We will sink in mortality
