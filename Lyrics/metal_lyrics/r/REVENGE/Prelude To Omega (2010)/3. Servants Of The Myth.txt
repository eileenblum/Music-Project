We are the subject of obligation
Servants of the gods
Praise the visionaire
We are design to bowing

We are the subject of obligation
Servants of the gods
Praise the visionaire
We are servants of the myth

Weâre killing for nothing
We acclaim our merit
Impurity for what we have done

This is the legion myth
Slaved by our thoughts
Divining a dead shit

Enslavement of mankind
Creation of the bastard
Continue to revealed the damned promise

Servants to our gods,we create a false divine
Servants to our gods, we sacred the doom

Oh God
We are dying in the hand of statue
That we invented to kill ourselves

What a dull existence
Perceiving no escape

Enslavement of mankind
Creation of the bastard
Continue to revealed the damned promise

We are the subject of obligation
Servants of the gods
Praise the visionaire
We are design to bowing

We are the subject of obligation
Servants of the gods
Praise the visionaire
We are servants of the myth
