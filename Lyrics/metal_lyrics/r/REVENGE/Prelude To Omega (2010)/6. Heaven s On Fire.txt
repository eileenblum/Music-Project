(back in the past, I ruin my life, I give my soul to an angel
cursed with hellfire, this curse give me a road to damnation
Iâll burn heaven and his wings)

Began the trial of the cursed one
Regrets scalded inside my organs
My love is banished with the mist
Life like a tomb in the dessert

(my life is no more, vengeance is some more)
(no salvation, only damnation)

Right now heavenâs on fire, I burn this light with all my revenge
Right now heavenâs on fire, I plague this God place

Wicked legions come forth
Chained and faded
Wicked legions come forth
Sinned and drowned

Holy place, where the people
Seeking for hope
I call it a gate to annihilation

I walk, when the sun goes black
I kill, when the devils run
I breathe, when the angels dead
I live, when the heavenâs burned

Feed me sin and my hatred will rise
Horrors of vengeance always in my mind

Angels are falling
Corpse are burning
(Iâm bringing death)
Heavens is sinking
Hell is rising
(Iâm the angel detest)

Right now heavenâs on fire, I burn this light with all my revenge
Right now heavenâs on fire, I plague this God place
