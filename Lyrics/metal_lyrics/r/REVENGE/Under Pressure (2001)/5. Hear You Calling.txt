You want me, it's okay
Oh baby, I got you on the line
Rock me down, shakin' me
You knox, you can brake
All the rules

I wanna hear you calling
I wanna hear you calling
I wanna hear you calling
Hear you calling,
Hear you calling
Calling my name

Crazy nights
Make it right
I wanna be in your arms
Fight fire
With fire
I'll be burning by you
Hot desire

Calling me
Turn me on
I'm ready for tonight

I wanna hear you calling
I wanna hear you calling
I wanna hear you calling
Hear you calling,
Hear you calling
Calling my name
