I'm on the way I feel
Searchin' for a thrill
Live my life
Everyday - all the times
I wanna be myself
Living from day to day
But I need you
Anytime - all the time

You were the fire
You were the light
You were the sign
And you will be mine
And you will be mine
And you will be mine

Can you
Handle, handle
Handle me with care

I'm not a perfect man
I'm not a perfect mind
I'm not so right
Everyday - all the times
I'm gonna fight for you
I'm gonna kill for you
More and more
For your heart - for your love

You were the fire
You were the light
You were the sign
And you will be mine
And you will be mine
And you will be mine

Can you
Handle, handle
Handle me with care
