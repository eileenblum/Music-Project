I've got a love tonight
I've got a love to sale
I've got he fire inside
In my veins that's right

I've got the power in me
I've got the force
In my hand
I've got a gold
In my heart
Shining bright tonight

You know, I know
I'm gonna live for you
You know, I know
I'm gonna die for you
You are the one
You are the first
I said
Try to get enough
You are my soul
You are my faith
I said
Try to get enough
Try to get enough
Try to get enough
For you
I've been loosing my mind
I've been loosing my heart
I've been calling your name
Many times before
I've been so upside down
I've been so lost and found
I've been between the lines
Before you get mine

You know, I know
I'm gonna live for you
You know, I know
I'm gonna die for you

You know, I know
I'm gonna live for you
You know, I know
I'm gonna die for you

You are the one
You are the first
I said
Try to get enough
You are my soul
You are my faith
I said
Try to get enough
Try to get enough
Try to get enough
For you
