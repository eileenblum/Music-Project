Saturday night,
I was on the run
Gettin' high,
'till the morning sun
Too much drinks
But I just don't care
My whiskey rollin'
With the rocks

Flashing lights, cuttin' through the night
Music sound gets me to the top
Come on baby,
Let me feel alright
Live for fun
Ain't no place I wanna be

Baby can't you see ?

I wanna dance over you
I wanna dance over you
I wanna dance over you
I wanna dance
I wanna dance over you

Saturday night,
The fever's growing up
Feel the heat
All around the place
Girls and boys
Meeting on the beat
Move your head and shakin' on your feet

Come on girl show me
What you got
Let me see what you can do
In this night I'm gonna
Make you cry
You'll can see the devil in me
When you touch your arms
When you touch your hands
I feel my body shaking over and over

When you touch my skin
When you touch my lips
I feel my body shaking
Over and over
