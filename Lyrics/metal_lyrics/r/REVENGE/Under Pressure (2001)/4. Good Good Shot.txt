If you're looking
For a good time, you know
She's the number one
She's the only one for
Satisfaction guaranteed

She's got the long, long legs, you knox
And the eyes of the sin
She never say never
If you knox what I mean

She don't care what is right
She don't care what is wrong
She don't care what they say
She's getting up all nights

She's a good, good shot !
She's a good, good shot !
She's a good, good shot !
She's a good, good shot !
She's a good, good, good,good
She's a good, good shot

She's got a magic touch,
You know
Give it everything you need
Rollin' thunder, ring the bell
She will take you away

You can believe me man,
That's why
She puts me through hell
But I can't get enough
And I'll be back for more
She don't care what is right
She don't care what is wrong
She don't care what they say
She's gettin' up all nights

She's a good, good shot !
She's a good, good shot !
She's a good, good shot !
She's a good, good shot !
She's a good, good, good, good
She's a good, good shot !
