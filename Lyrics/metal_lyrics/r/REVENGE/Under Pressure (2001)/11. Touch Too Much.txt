[AC/DC Cover]

It was one of those nights
When you turned out the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing
That she wouldn't do
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew she was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

Seems like a touch
A touch too much
Seems like a touch
A touch too much
Too much for my body
Too much for my brain
This kind of woman
Gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch
A touch too much

She had a face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Let the thunder
And lightning start
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
She wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare
Seems like a touch
Touch too much
You know it's much too much, too much, too much
I really want to feel
Your touch too much
Girl you know
You're getting me
Much too much
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
Cause you're much
Too much too much
