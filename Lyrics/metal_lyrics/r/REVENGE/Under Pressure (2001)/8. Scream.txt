Another night
Another thrill
He comes around
He'll be back for more
Another call
Another game
He'll be back for more

He's coming for you!
You can

Only, only, only scream
Only, only, only scream
You can only scream
You can only scream
Another voice
Another tear
Another fear
He'll be back for more
Another blood
Another fight
Another crime
He'll be back for more

He's coming for you ! You can

Only, only, only scream
Only, only, only scream
You can only scream
You can only scream

Nowhere to hide
And no escape
Nowhere to run
It's just too late
It's not a dream
It's not a movie
You can't break free
Just gonna die
You feel the ice
Into your veins
No help for you
You're the next victim

Only, only, only scream
Only, only, only scream
You can only scream
You can only scream
