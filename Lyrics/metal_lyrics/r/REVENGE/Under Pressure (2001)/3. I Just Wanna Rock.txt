Hey kids !
We are back on the stage
And everybody is alright

You've got the power
In your hands
Feeling higher and higher

Turn off the light
Turn on the night
My song is playing on radio
Turn on the power !

I just wanna rock
I just wanna roll
I just wanna rock'n roll

Hey kids!
Rock'n roll is in our souls
Singin' the song and don't think twice

Turn off the light
Turn on the night
My song is playing on the radio
Turn on the power !

[Chorus]

Turn on the light
Can you feel the heat tonight
Turn on the light
Turn on the light

I just wanna rock
I just wanna roll
I just wanna rock'n roll
