Goodbye old friends
I always keep you in my heart
It's been nice for a time
I will wait another night
I miss you till we're back
On the stage

Goodbye old friends
I always keep you in my heart
It's been nice for a time
I will wait another night
I miss you till we're back on the stage
I miss you till we're back on the stage
I miss you till we're back on the stage
