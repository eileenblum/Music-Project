You were young and wild, born in 69
You're just a restless child, devil by your side
You wanna see the world,
Over and over
You're living on the road, make you feel alright

Like an eagle flyin'
High in the sky
You will never surrender

You're like a hurricane
Many ways to see
You're gonna break your chains
You want to be free
You're blood is running hot, burning you inside
The voice of liberty
Calling you tonight
Run on and fly on
And never look back
It's just the call of the wild

Do what you want
When you ride with the wind
There's no speed limit
Do what you want
When you ride with the wind
There's no speed limit

You're riding on your way
Faster than the light
You wanna leave the past, just another fight
You wanna see the stars
Shining on your way
You're waiting for a sign
To the promise land

I can't believe
That you get off your head
Show me how to believe

Do what you want
When you ride with the wind
There's no speed limit
Do what you want
When you ride with the wind
There's no speed limit

You were young and wild, born in 69
Your heart is hard as steel, metal on metal
You wanna see the world,
Over and over
It's just another dream, open up your eyes

Thunder and lightnings
Will be by your side
You're gonna be free tonight

Do what you want
When you ride with the wind
There's no speed limit
