Stranger feeling in my soul
Burning me out of control
I can't explain, it's destiny
I don't know
Where you come from
Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
I can't explain, it's destiny

Walking on the edge
On and on, looking for my way

Can't stop the night
You're calling me
Can't stop the night
It's your destiny
Million voices
In my head
Talking to me
Never ending
I can't explain
It's destiny

Sometimes flashing
In the night
It's not a dream
Not a nightmare
I can't explain, it's destiny
Walking on the edge
On and on, looking for my way

Can't stop the night
You're calling me
Can't stop the night
It's your destiny
Can't stop the night
You're calling me
Can't stop the night
It's your destiny
