A justice court constituted to extirpate

All diverging interpretation ways of scriptures
From the orthodox line

The linen shroud tor second messiah
To impress the crucifixion meaning

On a cold october morning in the year of the lord 1307
Accusations carried damnation to walls of paris temple
The king was plotting with joy the templar order to destroy

Balancing national debt with confiscating act

Prepared were instruments
For every fault confession

So guillaume lmbert
With pleasure of whiplash torn
Naked master skin
And nailed his wrists to a door

As christ before...

So once again upon the passion of lord
According with traditional word
A torture velvet chamber
To dress the sindon gown
The humours of wounds flowed
Coagulating blood
Royal secret and sublime avenge
Ultimate portrait obscene
Of what does mercy teach

Persecution of each sin
An image fixed by hate

The matrix of heretic last icon
His spattered shroud consecrating
As relic of pain

A cross with two "j"

Jesus nazarene and jacques de molay
Missing ring among that days
And six centuries
Of prayers and deceit

The same name of christ brother, james

An inquiry commission instituted to examinate
The case of templar master named:
Jacques de molay

So began the process of canonization in black

The sound of hammer judge
As three bell tolls to light
Even though were set the pyres...

Inquisition condemnation erasing or assimilation
This is consecration of sindon sophisticated
But now mistery of twentysecond rank is disclosed
The attribution to a different identity arid the avenge
Is sevenfold fulfilled
