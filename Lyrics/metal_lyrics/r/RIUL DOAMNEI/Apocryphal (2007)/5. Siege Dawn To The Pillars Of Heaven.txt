Might has turn from slumber
Of this peace disgraceful time 
Soldiers march at dusk with 
Heaven gates on their sight

The glory of ancient code denied
For great campaign of death
Clouds were moving fast and dark
Near was siege dawn to heaven pillars 
Light...

War was come to paradise
Hostilities in arrogant clamour
Clockwork foul was compromised
Archangels dressed the armour
To defend the Zion splendour
From the ruin and genocide
Landers free in fugue by night
The slaughter for the skies demise

"For re-establishment of hierarchy fallen
Destroying the stillness with savage behaviour
Mining foundations in Christendom heart
Lords! Advance!"

At the entrance to muster..."

To impart a violent lesson
Under sodomy agonies harvesting seraphim

This was the day of the celestial massacre
Eclipse phagocyted the sun
Raged the artillery and guns

Angelcorpse in battlefield
Manure shed from Sophia hands  
How happened end in glory
Of lies emperia for men

This faith utopia developed the hope of the livings
To wall up this prison with view 
Original prophecy had emerged again from the sands 
Discerning the distance forbidden from dominion 
For the downfall of pillars and heaven
