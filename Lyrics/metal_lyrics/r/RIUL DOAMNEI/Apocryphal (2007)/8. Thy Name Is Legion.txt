Superstition satisfied 
The trivial fear and human doubt
Promise on eternal passage
Professing chastity vile
A crusade versus forces of their demons 
The reason for extermination

To catapult infected 
Corpses over fence
The breviary of evil
And decadence

Deserving disdain and repression

Order of prelacy bent on prie-dieu
In profound worship and wicked despair for
The tarots as rungs of the downstair to hell
The high priestess card and the hanged man

Apollyon Crystal Phalanx
Thy name is legion in fame
Apollyon Crystal Phalanx
To rage on season the flames

In public virtue and private vice they live
The doctors of the canon laws shall die

As a violence consumed in a confessional box
Libertine monks haunting maidens in devotion 

The missal for impure in the hands of world
A shepherd to deprive thy wishes beheld
