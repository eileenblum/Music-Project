So the earth rose again at the end of the days
Regenerated one by her self
Flames from dread consolidated with pain
To capture rest elements chaos

Thou art grasped wisdom of upheaval
Trasmutation state of awareness symbol 
As error lies hidden in those three sufferings 
Men settled adobe in weakness
In limbo to engulf every dissolute truth

Hordes forth predestination certitude
In epochal collision course                                              
As brides the world forgot 
The spores of inner hate
Fell down from the grace
Into substrate to wait 
Then founded were weapons in armistice
To forge the martyrs chains

No one indulgence to souls

The mist haunted this place to have the crown
A guest from oblivion 
Formed and not created   
With same substance of mother made
Hybrid holy in orgiastic ether
To obscure the columns of wrath 

When Angels fed the bells 
All forces left the flesh
To raise
The abyss grating well
Uncovered was the hell
As canopic urn

Now the storm looms again at the eve of this age
Contaminated by the regress
Shame on men in adulation insane
Architecture of perfect infection

To control the crowd with cross
