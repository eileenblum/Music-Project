A dirge to the lord far beyond even
Blind faith in the cult of demiurge
The dark took control on the Garden of Eden
In the arms of the sapience to urge
This chapter of men as bridge on a river
Evangelic sin fever to purge
The edge of religion dispersed the shivers
Of being at hypocrisy source

In hissing tongue to reveal
To Eve's ear snake approached 
"I have the key of knowledge
and it shall be thy..."

She handed fruit forbidden
To Adam teaching first
Inversion of creation process
Madam rapture of thirst
But jealous "god" by Mother lorn
Unable to govern world
In the name of his grace exiled
 All human pursuit trace

"I am God... I am the one!
My rage has to become....

Thy pain is still undone!"

Crude proliferation through
Ramifications in dogma of tomorrow
In sorrow of stigma they wept out
A Sober extinction was laid out

"Our Father living
The vault of the skies
Bless us all together
Thy reign we declaim"

In terror of god all mortals deceiver
Apostolic succession to keep 
Inquisitors raked up the desert of chosen
The cure for history sickness
Vicars of Christ as emperor whip
With rape administered forgiveness
Ignorance suggests believers
Legions indifferent driven

In sin at hypocrisy source

"Our brothers screaming
In hate from depth of the abyss
United forever
Aware the denial of the sort"
