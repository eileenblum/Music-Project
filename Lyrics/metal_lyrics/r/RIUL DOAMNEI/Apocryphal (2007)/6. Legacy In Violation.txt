Impostures in transcription
Rewriting gospels known
Mutations lot the masses yoke
Loosing sense of first golden spawn

Forsake
The vain essence of eyeless ghosts,
Trespass damnation shade
Regurgitate the host

Ashes will turn into fire
Dust on the guess of the liars
Plague religion called
Institution of the church from
Letters of sf. fk. paul

Proscription impositions
The rape of minds unfold
Mortification lives with you
From the baptism day to enslave
Break on

The legacy in violation
Pontiffs incelebration
Of memory elimination
Wrongful indoctrination

The circle of rectifier

Severed head of baptist
As heritage evokes
Real church of jerusalem
And falsification done

The legacy and violation
Priesthood in fornication

In better desire investing the oath
Observing expectation
In abominations of gnosis unsold
To fetter the fire corroding the truth
Apocryphal annunciation
For next revelation of gospels untold

The seal of apostasy gown
