Psycodrama of convenience loosened tourniquet to fold
The will in serpent creeping coils
A stolen alembic as glassheart broke off suspense to the soil
Pouring poison injected in my veins
Intrigues bizarre carnival at the court of my grave
For three coins sold my soul after funeral sale

Sometimes amber drop preserves death
As the bezels of truth birth a vengeance den

Forgiveness for sinners
A witness asleep
In palatial gardens
Infested with weeds

I kissed malevolent vestments of decay
In scarlet chamber sunset shadow lengthened to fade
Bittersweet taste of absinthe
Dried tears in bloom
Sapphirine fires
Danced filthy at council with moon
Gears of patience still rust to dust
Lascivious spit the parables spread
Unleashed in vehement mess
A gilded throne of favour
In the field of miracles left
As pledge to ravens hunger by even
White nemesis on marbled ledge

Sown is disgregation seed
To bud one rose on a ley of misery

Arcana genesis discordiae
Orerit et praesidia
Ornat misericordiae"

I vested desires in mannequin silhouette
Under my pillow gathering thorns for comfort

Incest
Bewaring the guess of
Autocracy to flesh
I swore never
To sever
Amor mors et sors
May pardon
Forget
A tecnocratic dash?

I have removed protective mesh from the rage
Tyrants imparted austere
Rigid lethargy rule

A perfect beauty and the strategy of silence
Like a feral surge over tray of youth
Definitive deluge in deliquescent solace
As naked whisper to wash white soot
