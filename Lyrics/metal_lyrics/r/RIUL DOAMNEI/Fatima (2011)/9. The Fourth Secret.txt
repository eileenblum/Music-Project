Sun has set over Saint Peterâs square
'Neath obelisk shadow which grew so vast
The council of ravens in conspiracy of silence
A rest of black feathers at dusk

Last sleep on the earth deformed
Awaiting fulfillment at dawn
Preparing the poison for world
Enfolding the throne
Ascending to Secret, the Fourth

The second upcoming was hidden by popes
The second messiah enslaving you all

Gold shines on purple talars
Undressed forlorn and mould
Strange voices and whispers haunt Vatican rooms
Tormenting dreams of bishops asleep
With visions of falling to misery and ruin
The end of two thousand years under Kingdom of Church

The next one has come, the Devil calls
The wisdom of Christ and Saints burns

âAn Archangel will walk among mortals once again
The rebel one who fell down from heaven to abyss
Will rise through the flames from depths to punish
Planting his seed into womb of charity and graceâ
This is revelation of Fourth Secret
From letters of Sister Lucy to keepers
The next incarnation by Lucifer semen
