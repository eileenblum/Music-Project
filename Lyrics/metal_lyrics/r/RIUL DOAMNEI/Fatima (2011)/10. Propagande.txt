A manifest to architect the fame
Now that cult has become danger
And thousand of mouths filled with her name
Keeping safe the church domain
Institution claims its own
All canât be erased: to assimilate!

And take back control
Her prodigy has just been approved
Among the stench of upcoming decay
Psychosis gains into strategy
Under drape where misery lays
Awake

A tacit order through centuries
With the perfect aim to preserve
Supremacy built on suffering
And respect born from the pain

âAnd I will descend in white lightning gown
Not crown of thorns but mantle of stars
Over clouds as a carpet to set me down
A proud rose in the burning bush
Seed of glory sown in eternal dustâ

From now on you will pray
Her and only her
Once again upon disgrace

Last purification through fire has come
Leading a brave army of cripples devoted
Once again upon disgrace

Among storms as a goddess who rides the night
A Valkyr grown in despotic arms
To rise as queen enthroned to martyrsâ eyes

From now on you will pay
Face to face
Once again upon disgrace
