I fall suddenly asleep
As forced to stillness
By impending presence near me
So are these scars maybe a gift from heaven?
Obsessive dreams that recall to seven
My body shakes by delirium tremens

Donât feel any pain or fear
A greenglow which filters through
A shadow behind the door
Something is coming forth
An extracorporeal sight
Invisible arms to lift
I levitate

As a mystic shaman blessed
By holy spirit I float
Entranced in an altered
State of perception
Believe forever
And never forget
Her gaze upon my skin

Phosphorescence behind
That shadow which hides inside
Grey angels with eyes of shark
Believe forever and ever
And never forget

My naked chest on a cold stone altar pressed
The injected needles into my veins are left
I suffered from a rare hysteria form
My story under regressive hypnosis
