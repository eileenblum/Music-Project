From the sand of a ghost desert
The Sirocco wind blows on
Through the dunes where the time is lost
As a serpent creeps forlorn

Prophetâs progeny has there taken form
By her hands and womb so warm
In the shadowfall her chador was led
To the bloodline of Muhammad

Falling down from the stars to abyss and fade out
As a comet appearance
Fleeting in the cosmos night
And Israel awaits in terror
The return of Sultanâs might
As the nightmare of a new Pharaoh

And now walk where you fear
On a fire-woven tapestry
End is near

Falling down from the stars to abyss and fade out
Burning from a deeper paradise
Razing towns
Welcome to the holocaust

So now walk where you fear
Burning from a deeper paradise
End is here

Sheâs the Fourth Daughter of the Light
Sheâs the Lore, Queen of Holy War
Sheâs the Ancient Mother of Islam
Sheâs the Shining Fatima
