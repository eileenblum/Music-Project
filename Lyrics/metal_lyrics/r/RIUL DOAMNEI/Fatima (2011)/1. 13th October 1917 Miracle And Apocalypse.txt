Darkness as a veiled glass
On red clouds are rising up
Deep autumn creeps
Where skies are livid
And winter comes forth
Trespassing gates of heaven
Appearing to rule

Our Lady of charity and grace
Our light and comfort trace
Our source of hope
In fragments

The miracle and apocalypse
Useless itâs praying god
Be thy eye witness ripped out

Constellations
Seize for her a throne
From where she governs
Enlightening your soul
And night upon world

âBrother, do you want to feel the fire?
You gotta go down
Blazing through the flames to beware
Of tempting mess
As Thomasâ finger settled on Jesusâ chest
Touching under vest with your hand
The leperâs plagueâ

An interstellar massacre over spaceline

And the jealous saints
Bleed in their vanity
A curse to paradise
To burn the Jesse Tree
And the hierarchy

Welcome here where crowd waits
Living the miracle of moon

Immolation
Blood spatters her crown
With which she hails
Releasing out her hordes
To radiate upon world
