A silhouette in shadow
So many times I see
In beauty now I sleep
A step forward to your grave
Listen little angel
To the words of lullaby
Now close your eyes forever
And leave the world of light

Seminary and rigid rules
To the convent chamber used
Where my body was abused
And so long I was recluse

Flame of a candle was consuming the wax
Far through window as a dancing whore
Then darkness there and nothing more

Sleep my little angel
Donât say a word tonight
Tomorrow wash your blankets
Your sorrow is othersâ delight

The litany of the sacred heart

The queen of the holy rosary
The shroud of a virgin in ecstasis
Listen little angel
To the words of lullaby
Now close your eyes forever
And leave the world of light
