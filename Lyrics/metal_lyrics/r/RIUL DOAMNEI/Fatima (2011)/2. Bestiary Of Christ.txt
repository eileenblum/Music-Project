And the blood in their mouth will taste sober
The marriage of Chana under rain
As morning pure water for an acolyte
Worst venom descends through your bowels

Terrible dark beauty of nature
Reminds of incarnation divine
In the garden of wounded Christ
Slavering demons appear
'pon the cradle to wait
Their turn to feed hunger justified

Let our hands dig under
The gravestone of abyss set

Uncorrupted by the witness
Triumphant inner flesh
Persecution and despair forget
The cruelty wears a talar
Infesting children left
At the cathechesis lesson sat

Thy door has been pressed
With the blood of the lamb
Sleep-walkers at borderline frail

They still repeat to themselves
It was just a nightmare from past

The bestiary of Christ
