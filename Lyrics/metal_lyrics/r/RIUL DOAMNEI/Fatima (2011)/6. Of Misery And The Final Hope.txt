Iâve travelled so far away from home
Where I left my life denied
With a white spelled dream
Which fades to night
As the past sins into morninglight

Iâve tried so hard every way to call
Myself back to life
In the warmest lust where tight will falls
As grey ash over
Fire-eaten skies

Of misery and the final hope
Now hear me screaming loud

Dyers! Sinners!
Chanting prayers
There waits the crowd
Standing at sunset
A pilgrimage of lepers to the sanctuary vault
An ordinary story
Of misery and the final hope
Now hear them screaming loud

By the bleeding of my feet
Arms and lips I bow myself to thee
Over charity and grace you master here
On a raw stone walk on my knees
To kiss prodigious skin

Now hear them crying out
They offer their soul for misery
And the final hope
Over charity and grace I worship here
