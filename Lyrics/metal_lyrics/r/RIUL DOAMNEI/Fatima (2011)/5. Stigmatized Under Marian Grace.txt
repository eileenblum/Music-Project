Ghost of city lay still
Under white aurora moon spell
Genuflexed the nails I felt
During the Sunday sermon at Easter mass

Am I a servant? A rosary kisser
I face holy virgin licking my fingers
Am I a sinner? Smoke for believers
Am I a liar? Faith in my inner lust

My hands started bleeding on the marble stair

Under marian grace I suffer
Her desire in stigma plague
Perversion creeps in tender cares
My pain and wounds so rare
She taught me in naked darkness
To impart the cruel caress
Her mercy 'pon my mortal flesh
Witnessing on earth

Be bound to serve in crimson spill
Her passion in wales on skin pale
My lips slowly move on to pray
For all those who wonder
The miscreant shall believe
The blind will see and the mute will speak

Am I a servant? Am I a sinner?
Stigmatized under marian grace
