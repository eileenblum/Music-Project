[Lyric: Federico - Music: Riul Doamnei]

The whipped silence lived and breathed stilt over trees
A left mist lens by invisible hand evil
Forward nightpiece of moon that recovered knees
By the lovers freeze towards the candlelight room

A cometh in rue
(voyeur wood)
As terror bellows stoke brands in cornucopia of unconscious
Neo messiah of woe
Reborn in blood
Vomitosis of faith
Strelitzia grew
(under plenilune pray)
To snare from ground her steps 'cause she has obsessed his gaze
Not Death knowing laze
Bistoury wale
The final schism to make

Clod cursed in
Mould ecumenical
Pain matrix
Absinth in fecalix

"...No vices for novices..."

Well,
Torn balmoral hung down
Over rotten trunk, the old
Abbot still lay libidinous
Under shade of her gown
Twice had sinned and
In vice he purloined life
Of a young naive novice
A deceit to the pureness
Tumid purply marks adorned
As neckband her throat
She consecrated to the horned
An arcadiagram of bort

A talardent will trespassed in fatalent thrill
But nadir wood hid horrid clough warder deep
Of a never-found corpse, Abbess had induced to kill
Astride, seducing siege to plant with devil her seed

Cannibal soul 
Murder of doll
(exchanging heart chaste for a century given)
Covenant seal
Necrogamy treat
Conventombed fate
Synodious flames
Under Jezebel name
(a conventity wicked from an ancient trigram)
On dial belfry to shed
Triad zodiacal lymph
She libertine timeless nymph

"...Per duplicem noxam
Hanc sanguinem fundo
Immortalibus hostia
Meum pactum renovo
Cenaculum vitae
Oraculum mortis
Malo cultum reiectum
Ab codice scripto..."

In the night of stars alignment She uttered formula at third bell
To rechristen her-self another once and carve apse clerical sham
Mass catholycantropic black drew the inquisitors to cleric cell
But those unveiled him hanged by the long red novice tress

This way was completed her ritual slaying

Under his feet a painted trigram 
At the cusps of which three acronyms headed
Virgo Scorpio Gemini astral
Castitas Turpitudo Seductio

A name and a place: "Abeljez-Campanaria"
As the cadaver naked revealed this message skin-cut
So they climb to dial, Her in calvaria to damn

"...Nunc sacram interdictam
Sed mox Abbatissam
Suspensam meridie..."
