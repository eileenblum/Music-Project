[Lyric: Federico - Music: Riul Doamnei]

Alone loitering and pale
Pain spottes path as paint
Step by step
Marching on the virtues way
Now hunt my fate
Wait for her porcelain made
From now to dusk
On the shores of this vitreous lake

A strange scarlet flame have lured me here
Under most splendent evil born from Sirius star
Her harvest is done my ruin in languid gown
Starts

The lastest dream I ever dreamed
Her gaze like spell
Is it heaven or hell?
Moon's our sun
Mother white
So this night will never turn to light
Art Thou Morgana?
Or The Lady of Lake?
There finding forlorn my Avalon

..."My Lord of the War
Not for me was enthralled
Thy name as rill-blood
Reflecting 'pon the sword?"...

If I met thee for
My triumph or fall
Doesn't matter at all
Never lost I was before

So many darkness I've torn
Seeking her on this earth until madness howls
Drink deep from the calix of her doctrine
Angel eyes but devil horns

From the silent hill side to her elfin groat
Where she'd promise a kiss
And another present for me
"I love thee true":this mine hope too

The lastest dream I ever dreamed
Her pale skin bare
Her scent through the air
Maybe I should sleep for eternity
Or awake at dawn
Thou!!Lilith spawn

Many starved lips gaping in the gloam
Like horrid warning for my soul
I saw ghost kings, death possessed 'em all
..."La Belle Dame Sans Merci, hath thee in thrall"...
