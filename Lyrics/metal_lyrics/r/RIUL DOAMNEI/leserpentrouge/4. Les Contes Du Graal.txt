[Lyric: Federico - Music: Riul Doamnei]

"The end of first age Seraphim and the third Angels hierarchy,
Rebelled and at war with the others, sealed the Alliance with
The Adepts of Darkness to reconquer what too long was lost
And forgotten..."

Red desert sands kept cursecrets Apocrypha
But now heavens started to blaze
Angels at war blessed the Herald Apocalypse
The armies of Gabriel raged

Whilst the human eyes was still trying to penetrate
The mistery of Graal through sky
The most sacred relic was disputed in massacre
From exodus of Sinai tribes

To the north Arcade of Chartres named "Door of the Iniziated"
A golden wonder of absolute knowledge
Enrobed with stoles to incense this thirst

The Fountain of Soul under Solomon Temple,
of Moriah was Shetiyyah stone
Later house of Nine, Guardians and Knights,
three kisses rite at Baphomet dome

Kebra-Nagast
as Parzival led to the land of Priest John

Jerusalem ruined and iconoclast won, the salvation on Assuan way
An ancient flood isle stored the Trinity hidden, for two centuries Tabernacle stayed

Again waters of Nile as blood
Plagues and darkness three days long

Twelve Tables of Law
Made meteorite raw
Forty dusks passed
Then Moses returned

Causing pain after pain Archa rode
From place to another place to Tana Lake
For next eight hundred years silent one's time bode
Saint Mary Of Sion the Axum church to reach

"Hic Amicitur Archa Cederi - Hic Amicitur Archa Foederis"

Great clouds lurid thickened
The Winds stormed on battlefield
Near was Har Megiddo for the Mercy Throne
Seraph Lieutenant Uziel loomed
At the Gabriel left ahead of troops
Waiting signal to invade

"...TO WAR!..."

Virtues darts rain grew fire
Sight black doves flight... Immolated
Cherubs figures... Mutilated
Earth rumbling trembled... Devastated

As Bezaleel hands had built for god will reflection
So Uzzah and Ahio burnt on chariot redemption
A scourge...

The battle was won but the war not so shure
Axum in terror of a final assault
Forsaken the gates of besieged city lure
The Trumpets of Damned recalled

...So there marched the Apocalypse crowd...
