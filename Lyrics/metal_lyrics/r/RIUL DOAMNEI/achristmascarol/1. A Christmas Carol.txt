[STAVE 1:]

Marley's Ghost, The Ever-Errant Enchained

[STAVE 2:]

The First of the Three Spirits, The Pure Enlightened

Cold wind had blown
And howled through the doors
From the north had driven storm
Fear had taken form of a guest
From shadow born, pale as snow
And Marley's words had turned

"I wear the chain I forged in life
I made it link by link and yard by yard
Expect the first tomorrow when the bell tolls one
Because you will be haunted by three Spirits"

- How can I have slept through
A whole day and far into another night? -

The quarter was so long
The hour itself and nothing else
And the curtains of his bed
Were drawn aside by a hand

Of a strange figure dressed in purest white
Breaking out from light, half old half child

"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past
Your past, rise and walk with me"

The darkness and the mist had vanished
It was a clear, cold, winter day

- Good heaven, I was bred in this place! -
"These are but shadows
Of the things that have been"

The school was not quite deserted
A solitary child neglected by his friends
Was left there still

And Scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see
His poor forgotten self as he used to be
And the visit of his little sister, Fan
Always a delicate creature
Whom a breath might have withered
But she died a woman

"Let us see another Christmas"

And it was Christmas time again
It was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops
But it was evening and the streets were lighted up
The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door
- I was apprenticed here -

Waltz of the Apprentice

A ball room as you would desire to see upon a winter's night
In came a fiddler with a music-book, in came Mrs Fezziwig
In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable 
In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke

There were more dances and there were forfeits
And more dances and there was cake 
And there was negus, and there was a great piece 
Of cold roast beef and there was a great piece of cold boiled 
And there were mince-pies and plenty of beer
The fire and a mistletoe wreath and there were red candles
Wine, cheers, laughings, happiness

Once upon Loss, Regret and Broken Promise

He was older now
And his face had begun to wear 
The signs of care and avarice 
He was not alone 
But sat by the side of a fair 
Young girl in mourning dress 
In whose eyes there were tears

"It matters little
To you, very little
You fear the world too much
Another idol has displaced me, a golden one
I have seen your nobler aspirations 
Fall off one by one
And I release you with a full heart
For the love of him you once were"

She left him and they parted
- Show me no more! Conduct me home!
Why do you delight to torture me? No more! -
"One shadow more", exclaimed the Ghost

"And now see the family that you have never had" 

A daughter was standing near the fire with her mother
And children asking for Christmas presents 
When the husband suddenly said:

"I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon 
Mr. Scrooge it was, I passed his office window
And he had a candle inside
His partner lies upon the point of death
And there he sat alone, quite alone in the world
I do believe"

- Leave me
Take me back
Haunt me no longer -

[STAVE 3:]

The Second of the Three Spirits, The Serpentine Crowned

Serpent, it creeps to man asleep 
Without any warmth, without any sound
Man, he sleeps where serpent awaits 
Without any awareness, without any care

Sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together
Scrooge had no occasion to be told 
That the bell was again upon the stroke of one
Now being prepared for almost anything

He turned uncomfortably cold
When he began to wonder
Which of his curtains 
This new spectre 
Would draw back
He put them every one 
Aside with his own hands 
And lying down again 
Established a sharp look-out 
All round the bed

Five minutes, ten minutes
A quarter of an hour went by
Yet nothing came
A strange voice 
Called him by his name

"Come in and know me better, Man
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present
Look upon me"
- Spirit, conduct me where you will -

Dinner of Villains, A Crutch and the Vacant Seat

The house fronts looked black enough
And the windows blacker
Contrasting with the smooth white sheet 
Of snow upon the roofs
It led him straight to his clerk's house
Bob Cratchit his name 
Who had just come home
With his son upon his shoulder, Tiny Tim
Alas, he bore a little crutch 
And had his limbs supported by 
An iron frame

The pale hands of misery had gathered this family 
Among hunger and sickness in a portrait of disgrace
A dinner of villains, too many mouths to feed 
Bobâs voice was tremulous when he told them this:

"Tim told me, coming home
That he hoped the people saw him 
In the church because he was a cripple 
And it might be pleasant to them 
To remember upon Christmas Day
Who made lame beggars walk 
And blind men see"

- Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live -

"I see a vacant seat 
In the poor chimney corner
(Carefully preserved)
And a crutch without an owner
If these shadows remain
Unaltered by the Future
None other of my race 
Will find him here"

Through the Storm to Man's Orphanage

To Scroogeâs horror, looking back
He saw the last of the land
A frightful range of rocks behind them
And his ears were deafened
By the thundering of water
As it rolled and roared
Again the Ghost sped on and on
Above the black and heaving sea 
Being far away from any shore
They lighted on a ship

Much they saw and far they went
In almshouse, hospital and jail
In miseryâs every refuge
It was a long night
If it were only a night

Looking at the Spirit he noticed that its hair was grey
- Are spirits' lives so short? -
"My life upon this globe is very brief
It ends to-night at midnight"

- Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask 
But I see something strange, not belonging to yourself
Protruding from your skirts, is it a foot or a claw? -
"It might be a claw for the flesh there is upon it"

From the foldings of its robe it brought two children
Wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable 
They knelt down at its feet

"They are Manâs, this boy is Ignorance
This girl is Want, beware them both
But most of all beware this boy
For on his brow I see that written which is Doom"

- Have they no refuge or resource? -
"Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?"
What then. If they be like to die, they had better do it, and decrease
the surplus population
(The bell struck twelve)

Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost 
And saw it not, as the last stroke ceased to vibrate
He remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley
And lifting up his eyes beheld a solemn Phantom
Draped and hooded, coming like a mist
Along the ground, towards him

[STAVE 4: ]

The Last of the Three Spirits, The Black Hooded

The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached
When it came, Scrooge bent down upon his knee 
For in the very air through which this Spirit moved 
It seemed to scatter gloom and mystery
It was shrouded in a deep black garment 

It left nothing of it visible
Save one outstretched hand
But for this, it would have been difficult 
To detach its figure from the night 
And separate it from the darkness 
By which it was surrounded

- Am I in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come? -
The Spirit answered not but pointed onward with its hand

- You are about to show me shadows 
Of the things that have not happened 
But will happen in the time before us
Ghost of the Future, I fear you
More than any spectre I have seen -

They travelled through time and space 
And stopped beside different places 
Where everyone was speaking about
The death of a rich old man 

If he had died alone and forgotten
Someone was selling out his burial dress 
And the curtains of his bed after despoiling them 
From his own corpse and chapel of rest

No word of care or sadness to him
No prayer and no funeral dirge
A tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone
A squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping
Clutching, covetous, old sinner! 

- Spirit, I see! The case of this man might be my own
Merciful Heaven, what is this? -

A pale light fell straight upon a bed and on it
Plundered, unwept, uncared for was the body of this man

A Corpse Unwept, Uncared For and Forgotten

Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death set up thine altar here 
And dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command
For this is thy dominion
It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released?
It is not that the heart and pulse are still? Strike, Shadow, strike
And see his good deeds springing from the wound
To sow the world with life immortal

No voice pronounced these words in Scroogeâs ears
The Phantom steady hand was pointed to the head

- Spirit, I understand you
And I would do it if I could
But I have not the power
Let me see some tenderness
Connected with this death 
Or that dark chamber will be
For ever present to me -

The Ghost conducted him through several streets
Familiar to his feet and as they went along
Scrooge looked here and there to find himself
But nowhere was he to be seen

-Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead -

The Spirit stopped
The hand was pointed elsewhere
A churchyard! Here, then
The wretched man whose name
He had now to learn
Lay underneath the ground

It was a worthy place
Walled in by houses, overrun by grass and weeds
The growth of vegetationâs death 
The Spirit stood among the graves
And pointed down to one

The Stone of the Neglected Grave

- Are these the shadows of the things that will be
Or are they shadows of things that may be, only? -

Still the Ghost pointed downward 
To the grave by which it stood

- Menâs courses will foreshadow certain ends 
To which, if persevered in, they must lead
But if the courses be departed from
The ends will change -

Scrooge crept towards it
Trembling as he went and following the finger
Read upon the stone of the neglected grave
His own name
