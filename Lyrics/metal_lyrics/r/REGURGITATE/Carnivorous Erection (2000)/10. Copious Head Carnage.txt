Bronchial cavities fill the acidulous pus
Copious head carnage makes you flutter and fuss
The pharynx is sealed with liquefacted meat
Readying myself for a toothsome treat

Cooking the contents of your simmering skull
Its hollowed out husk provides a convenient bowl
In anticipation, my mouth begins to froth
Making bullion of your cranium, I spoon the tasty broth
