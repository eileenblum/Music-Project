Severing uterus as the ovaries are rent
Your leaking gap is utterly split
Throbbing in excruciation your crotch is mangled

I gleefully carve up the bladder and slice up the cervix with mirth
The fundus is now a stump as I dismantle the afterbirth

The fetus is carved
Embryonic execration
Umbilical excoriation
