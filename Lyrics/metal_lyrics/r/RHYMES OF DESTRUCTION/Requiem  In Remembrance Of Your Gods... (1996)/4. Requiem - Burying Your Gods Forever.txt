With the last stop on your long way in
sight, and the preview of a metamorphose
into rotten flesh, you'll deny your god and
sing this last song:
"A divine comedy, about god's insanity, as a
grotesque theathre, based on hypocrisy"

+ Reverende Pater, benedic me, quio volo
confiteri peccata mea coran domino et de
Dominus Jesus Christi, sit in orde tuo et
super labiis tuis et sincere confetearis
peccata tua

+ Dominus noster Jesus Christus te absolvat
et ego, auctoritate Ipsius, te absolvo a
peccatis tuis. In nomine Patri et filii et
spiritus sancti Amen. Vade in pace

And now you embrace your pagan gods, and new
illusions you create, but after a while your
dogmatic conformism, makes your Odin the new Christ...

Requiem for your long dead god, as a shama-
nistic prophecy, a pagan ceremony for the
buried god... you'll never find 'm back!

Requiem / Burying your gods forever... and ever...
