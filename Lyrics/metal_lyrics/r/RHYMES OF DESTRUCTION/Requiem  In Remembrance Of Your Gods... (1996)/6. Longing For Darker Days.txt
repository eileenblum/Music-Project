Now the sun has set and the moon has risen
from her illuster crypt, hear my dark voice
calling over the twilight fields of war...

As the dark winds wander over my woods, the
grey skies are opening their light for this
ceremony, it gives me the power for a new
kingdom, mine... it bring the return of
the ancient ones nearer... together, we'll
reign further and further... Into eternity
...I'm (almost) immortal

I still wander,
And dreams are often forgotten
But this nightmare continues and
Paganism won't be restored but we'll blow
Christ up into his right dimensions,
Longing for darker days

Visions of a past, rejected thoughts
a shredded dream: christ still rules this
world, but his kingdom's drowning, still I'm
longing for those darker days

Our day will come once... it's even closer
than you can imagine

Into the sinister paths we follow
