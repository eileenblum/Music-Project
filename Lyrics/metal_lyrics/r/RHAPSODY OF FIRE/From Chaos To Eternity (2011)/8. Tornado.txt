[Turilli/Staropoli]

In primordial times of war
Gods and men, dragonlords
Fighting for a dead world
A black sun will scare us all
Gloomy past carved in hate
Ready to be back

It's my time, my chance to show
Who you are, who we are
Shade of human terror
May I cause the unborn's fall
Through new gates he will come
For the end of all

From empty shadows
Electric silence
In veiled reflections
Of one lonely sunshine

In the air my whispered name
In the air...

Now condemned to be insane
Evil born, you will drown
Swallowed by oblivion
Once to darkness I belonged
Deep inside, you're the same
Godforsaken soul

In my heart the angels' fate
In your name fear and pain
Violence and bloodshed
May the thunder's holy force
Pound in me, burn my sin
Storm once more

From empty shadows
Electric silence
In veiled reflections
Of one lonely sunshine

In the air my whispered name

[CHORUS:]
BEYOND THE SECRETS OF SPACE COLLIDING
IN STELLAR FIRE I WILL BURN TO SAVE
MY WORLD'S UNWRITTEN FATE
FROM QUAKES AND VOLCANOS

BEYOND THE SECRETS OF SPACE COLLIDING
IN STELLAR FIRE I WILL RISE AGAIN
AS TEAR OF ANGELS' PAIN
AS CYCLONE, TORNADO AGAIN

[Guitar solo by Luca Turilli]

From empty shadows
Electric silence
In veiled reflections
Of one lonely sunshine

In the air my whispered name

[CHORUS:]
BEYOND THE SECRETS OF SPACE COLLIDING
IN STELLAR FIRE I WILL BURN TO SAVE
MY WORLD'S UNWRITTEN FATE
FROM QUAKES AND VOLCANOES

BEYOND THE SECRETS OF SPACE COLLIDING
IN STELLAR FIRE I WILL RISE AGAIN
AS TEAR OF ANGELS' PAIN
AS CYCLONE, TORNADO AGAIN
