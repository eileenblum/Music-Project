[Turilli/Staropoli]

From chaos to eternity

Dead space all around
Grey shades, not one sound
Dark thoughts, half-alive
Chaos born, life denied

Dead space!
(All around)
Grey shades!
(Not one sound

Dark thoughts!
(Half-alive)
Life denied

I'll live!
(Make me live)
I'll feel!
(Let me feel)

I'll be!
(Make me be)
Set me free

I need him, I see him
A new emotion fills me
(Save my soul)

Inside me, beyond me
Expanding to his cosmic will
(Save my world)

[CHORUS:]
AN ANGEL SPOKE
HIS SOUL WILL SOAR FROM RUINS OF HATE
SILENT PAIN, ENDLESS WAR
LED FROM CHAOS TO ETERNITY

MORTAL DESTINY
HIS BLEEDING RHYME OF DIVINE TRAGEDY
A NEW TRACE OF HOPE IS CARVED IN HIM
THE SECRET OF MY UNIVERSE, MY SIN

From chaos to eternity

Darkened entity
Chasing loneliness
Nowhere I can hide
One choice: truth or lie?

Darkened
(Entity)
Chasing
(Loneliness)

Nowhere
(I can hide)
Truth or lie?

I'll live!
(Make me live)
I'll feel!
(Let me feel)

I'll be!
(Make me be)
Set me free

I need him, I see him
A new emotion fills me
(Save my soul)

Inside me, beyond me
Expanding to his cosmic will
(Save my world)

[CHORUS:]
AN ANGEL SPOKE
HIS SOUL WILL SOAR FROM RUINS OF HATE
SILENT PAIN, ENDLESS WAR
LED FROM CHAOS TO ETERNITY

MORTAL DESTINY
HIS BLEEDING RHYME OF DIVINE TRAGEDY
A NEW TRACE OF HOPE IS CARVED IN HIM
THE SECRET OF MY UNIVERSE

[Solo]

[CHORUS:]
AN ANGEL SPOKE
HIS SOUL WILL SOAR FROM RUINS OF HATE
SILENT PAIN, ENDLESS WAR
LED FROM CHAOS TO ETERNITY

MORTAL DESTINY
HIS BLEEDING RHYME OF DIVINE TRAGEDY
A NEW TRACE OF HOPE IS CARVED IN HIM
THE SECRET OF MY UNIVERSE, MY SIN

From chaos to eternity
Set me, set me free!
