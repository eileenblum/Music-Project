[Turilli /Staropoli]

I wonât forget that day
I wonât forget her name
What has hell done to her 
Her painâs flowing in my blackened soulâs veins

Libera animas
Omnium defunctorum
De poenis inferni
Ne cadant / ne cadant in obscurum

Libera animas
De poenis inferni

Cold frozen night
(Bleeding sins and lies)
Nocturnal rhyme
(Of unholy pride)

Quake! (Crack!) Dare! (Clash!)
Storm the gates of hell!

MAY YOU BE THE ONE
THE EVERLASTING FLAME OF HOPE
GLORIFY THE ANGELS
AND FIGHT THEIR HOLY WAR
LET ME FACE THE BEAST
AND EVERY SINGLE DEVILâS SON 
I WILL FREE MY MIND
AND I WILL SAVE HER SOUL

Many donât realize
What itâs capable of
What âevilâ really is
Far beyond its meaning as a mere word

Requiem aeternam
Dona eis, Domine
Requiem aeternam
Lux perpetua / lux luceat eis

Requiem aeternam
Dona eis, Domine

Her lovely smile
(Brutalized and raped!)
Her crystal eyes
(She wonât see anymore!)

Quake! (Crack!) Dare! (Clash!)
Storm the gates of hell!

MAY YOU BE THE ONE
THE EVERLASTING FLAME OF HOPE
GLORIFY THE ANGELS
AND FIGHT THEIR HOLY WAR
LET ME FACE THE BEAST
AND EVERY SINGLE DEVILâS SON 
I WILL FREE MY MIND
AND I WILL SAVE HER SOUL

[Guitar Solo: Luca Turilli]

MAY YOU BE THE ONE
THE EVERLASTING FLAME OF HOPE
GLORIFY THE ANGELS
AND FIGHT THEIR HOLY WAR
LET ME FACE THE BEAST
AND EVERY SINGLE DEVILâS SON
I WILL FREE MY MIND
AND I WILL SAVE HER SOUL

Why youâ¦ why?
I will free you!
