Silent cries
endless night
paint all my fate, whisper my name
sing my angel of light

Shy magic star
angel eye
another bright shade of blue
my shining star

No more lies
no more cries
whispers in my mind
and dreams are frozen in time

Shy magic star
be my guide
fly where angels are free
my shining star

Shy magic star
angel eye
another bright shade of blue
my shining star
shy magic star
be my guide
another bright shade of blue
my shining star
