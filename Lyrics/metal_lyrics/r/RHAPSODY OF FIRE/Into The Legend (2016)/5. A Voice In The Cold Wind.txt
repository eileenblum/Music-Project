Rest your wings my butterfly
don't you cry I'm here by your side
don't be afraid, get lost in a dream
I watch the morning dawn upon your skin

Let this daylight dry your tears
I'll never leave you
in the cold rain
in the blue sky

I am the one voice in the cold wind
I am the one voice in the rain

Lost in a world of silent cries tonight
you will hear me calling across the sky
this night will never die
no more broken ties

Let me be your freedom
let me be your light
with love you'll find your lonely way
my words will warm and calm you tonight
I promise, no more cries, no broken ties

Let this daylight dry your tears
I'll never leave you
in the cold rain
in the blue sky

I am the one voice in the cold wind
I am the one voice in the rain

Lost in a world of silent cries tonight
you will hear me calling across the sky
this night will never die
no more broken ties

Lost in a world of silent cries tonight
you will hear me calling across the sky
Lost in a world of silent cries tonight
you will hear me calling across the sky
this night will never die
no more broken ties, no cries
