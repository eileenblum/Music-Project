One day a king will rise with the sun
born into darkness on this silent shore
he will remember the cold and the shame
he preys for salvation in this sea of flames

King, rise, die, cries

He's just one lost soul, he cries for

Fading memories
from realms of light
eternal mystery
when knowledge was confined

He sees this world with a different light
feeling the rage and it's all been a lie
he will remember the dark and the pain
with eyes of a stranger he will stand so brave

King, rise, die, cries

Now his mind is free, he cries for

Fading memories
from realms of light
eternal mystery
when knowledge was confined

Now his mind is free, he cries for

Fading memories
from realms of light
eternal mystery
from dreams revealed in
fading memories
from realms of light
eternal mystery
when knowledge was confined
a king
will rise
