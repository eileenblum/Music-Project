Another shadow in my darkest day
from kingdoms of light
cold silent rain
and if I close my eyes
a promise, a word, a voice never heard

Master of illusion
feel the rage of darkness
sad immortal angel
now face the change

And now I'm standing more stronger and proud
I know there's so much, so much more I can be
standing alone at the edge
a promise, a word and a voice never heard

Master of illusion
feel the rage of darkness
sad immortal angel
now face the change

On wings of glory over the rain
guide me through my secret place
full moon fever is raising again
guide me to my chosen fate

On wings of glory over the rain
guide me through my secret place
full moon fever is raising again
guide me to my chosen (fate)

On wings of glory over the rain
guide me through my secret place
full moon fever is raising again
guide me to my chosen fate
to my chosen fate
ride
to my secret place
