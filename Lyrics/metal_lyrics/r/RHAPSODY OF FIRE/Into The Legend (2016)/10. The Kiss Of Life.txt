Ignis sanctus
ignis dei

And so we run, so we run down in flames
where all the love, love has gone into the rain
there's no cure I can tell
I'm under her spell, she's waiting for me
cold wind is calling again, it's calling again
now the vision is getting clear

Tell (me) your secrets
and tell me what do you see
give me light to see inside
just purify my sins

My lady shines
lonely day that fades away
my lady shines
call my name and dance with the moon
don't be afraid
just your illusions are now fading away

And time has come, time has come to feel no pain
my shining star, shining star lights the way
there's no cure I can tell
I'm under her spell, she's waiting for me
your smile will not be the same
will not be the same
for the first time all things are clear

Tell (me) your secrets
and tell me what should I see
cold so close the water
just purify my sins

My lady shines
lonely day that fades away
my lady shines
call my name and dance with the moon
don't be afraid
just your illusions are now fading away

E sorgerÃ , realtÃ , come il sol, come amor
e speranze ormai tradite ma vissute giÃ , perdute giÃ 
vissute son

CrescerÃ , in me sarÃ 
e sorgerÃ  la speranza come il sol
per ritentar voli mai provati ancor

Tu mia veritÃ , che sai sognar, che sai osar, dimenticar
vola oltre l'umana coscienza, vola oltre i confini
oltre il mio cuor, oltre l'amor

Resta in me con sogni e calor
e sorgerÃ  la speranza come il sol
per ritentar voli mai provati ancor

Nova natura, nativus sensus
anima pura, lucem divinam
nova natura, nativus sensus
anima pura, lucem divinam
nova natura, nativus sensus
anima pura, lucem divinam

My lady shines
lonely day that fades away
the kiss of life shades of night that fades away
my lady shines call my name and dance with the moon
don't be afraid
just your illusions are now fading away

Watching the rain fall
with my real visions
I will be dreaming
I will be fading

Watching the sand fall
with my illusions
I will be searching
I will be waiting

Ignis sanctus

We run we search the kiss of life
the kiss of life
maybe she's looking at me
she's speaking
maybe she speaks to me!
