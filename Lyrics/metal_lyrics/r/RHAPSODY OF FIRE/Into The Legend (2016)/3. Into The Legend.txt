Insomnia est angorem
animarum
intenebris infirmae sunt animae

Breaking the silence in this morning light
cold wind is calling
marching with fire and steel in your heart
searching for answers
shy mystic rain you've been frozen in time
paint all this darkness
filling my soul, filling my lonely fate
dark mystic rain

Nightmares and frozen gates
silence, feel the cold reaper's blade
seasons, turning to grey
diseases, always run through my veins

Into the legend I will ride
far away from this cold sea of lies
never know, never tried
I'm still burning
into the legend you won't see me cry
from the other side

I'll be fighting this eternal night
flames are still burning
marching with pain and tears in my life
facing this sadness
shy mystic rain and dramatic rhymes
rain gently falling
filling my soul, filling my lonely fate
last mystic rain

Nightmares and frozen gates
silence, feel the cold reaper's blade
seasons, turning to grey
diseases, always run through my veins

Into the legend I will ride
far away from this cold sea of lies
never know, never tried
I'm still burning
into the legend you won't see me cry
from the other side

Into the legend I will ride
far away from this cold sea of lies
never know, never tried
I'm still burning
into the legend you won't see me cry
from the other side
Into the legend I will ride
far away from this cold sea of lies
never know, never tried
I'm still burning
into the legend you won't see me cry
from the other side
stairs of stone, descending
