In the dragons' year 9000
after the sixth won war
Nekron conquered the darklands
so began his new reign
His new bloody reign

A whole town built on a rock
as giant as a mountain
portals made of angels' bones
to warm men, elves and dragons
Elves, men, dragonlords

NO TRACE OF HUMAN LIFE
THERE IN THE DARKLANDS
HARGOR BECAME SOON THE HEART
HEART OF THE DARKLANDS
DARK GREY LANDS

In the dragons' year 9000
after the sixth won war
Nekron conquered the darklands
so began his new reign
His new bloody reign

NO TRACE OF HUMAN LIFE
THERE IN THE DARKLANDS
HARGOR BECAME SOON THE HEART
HEART OF THE DARKLANDS
DARK GREY LANDS
