[Dargor:]
While I crossed the mountains' side
I recalled a memory
days of anguish nights of pain
your voice lives on trapped inside my mind
eternally

Those wise last words fade in my soul
"You had the choice, you chose the light
find your way darklands' son
spread your wings then your heart will fly"
Thank you, angels
I am now reborn
this may be my last breath
and my final day

I'M THE SON OF PAIN
WELCOME MY NEW FATE

Hell's lost flame was life for me
in that moment I felt free
I was under an evil spell
so now I want just to live again
to live again

I am proud, proud to lead my soul
to new horizons, to the golden sky
"find your way my brave darklands' son
wizards, kings, elves and trolls"
Thank you, angels
I am now reborn
this may be my last breath
and my final day

I'M THE SON OF PAIN
WELCOME MY NEW FATE
THUNDER GODS I PRAY
I DENY HELL'S FLAMES
