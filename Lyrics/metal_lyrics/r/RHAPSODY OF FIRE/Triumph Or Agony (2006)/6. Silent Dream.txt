The silent storm in my heartbeat
is raging at the questions of soul
no way back, rising darkness
blind angel in a night without stars

Lost in the silent dream
of a lonely broken love

The fall of hope, of illusion
is hidden there behind the wild rocks
to reach the sun, warm my feelings
I'll rise where only eagles can fly

Lost in the silent dream
of a lonely broken love

FLY, FLY HIGH
ENLIGHT MY HEART AND MY EYES
BRING HOPE WITH YOUR HOLY SUNLIGHT
THE ANGELS' FIRE

The silent storm in my heartbeat
is raging the questions of soul
no way back, rising darkness
blind angel in a night without stars

Lost in the silent dream
of a lonely broken love

FLY, FLY HIGH
ENLIGHT MY HEART AND MY EYES
BRING HOPE WITH YOUR HOLY SUNLIGHT
THE ANGELS' FIRE

I'LL BELIEVE
IN WHAT THE WIND BRINGS TO ME
IN PURE LOVE AND GREAT EMOTION
I WILL BELIEVE
