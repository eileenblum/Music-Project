Vision of darkness, mad gothic splendour
rhyme of primordial neverending war
carved in the wild rock under the ghost town
sun of the darklands, black pride of Kron

200 nor of unholy stone
speak through the tears of desperate souls
legend and myth will never reveal
the infinite pain behind Nekron's will

Wars of the underworld
fought by our brothers who'll never return

Broken emotions wet from the shy rain
lords of the lost time dream of great revenge
no chance for mind's rest, fear in the dawn's breath
what they will soon find can be just their death

200 nor of unholy stone
speak through the tears of desperate souls
legend and myth will never reveal
the infinite pain behind Nekron's will

Wars of the underworld
fought by our brothers who'll never return

IT'S OUR DESTINY
TRIUMPH OR AGONY
ANCIENTS' GLORY ENDLESS PAIN
DEEP INTO THE DUNGEONS OF HELL

Lux aeterna
de sententia dolorosa
libera nos
lux aeterna
ex dolore sangui
Angelus sempiternus
angelus ex inferno

IT'S OUR DESTINY
TRIUMPH OR AGONY
ANCIENTS' GLORY ENDLESS PAIN
DEEP INTO THE DUNGEONS OF HELL
