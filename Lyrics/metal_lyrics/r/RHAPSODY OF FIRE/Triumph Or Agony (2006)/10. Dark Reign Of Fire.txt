Nekron's bloody shadow
lives on in his dark words
Hargor knows what happened
now it's time to run fast
before they come

Run valiant heroes and hide
the dark words of hellgod's last son

Then they found the river
that led them to Fenor
onward down to Orin
Orin was their shelter
now they were safe

Triumph or agony depends on how
you will use those words

Orin opened its grey walls, Hanos received them
one of the wise kings who believed in the order's plan
to save the known world
After a long deserved rest they went forth in the dawn
their way back would be long

The evil forces are planning the worst act in the history of these lands
what this book could reveal to them it's divine help

"Soon the black book will be opened with consequences beyond any nightmare.
Be ready to face its evil revelations.
Today, at the whisper of the darkest winds, a new saga begins!"

[Eloin:]
"Pass through our middle forests safely, old friend,
my heart goes with you beyond mountains and oceans
I see what fate has decreed, I see it in the holy stars.
The seizure of Nekron's book is only the beginning
of a great adventure and we shall meet again.
We shall defend our beloved earth.
Myth and legend ride with you!"
