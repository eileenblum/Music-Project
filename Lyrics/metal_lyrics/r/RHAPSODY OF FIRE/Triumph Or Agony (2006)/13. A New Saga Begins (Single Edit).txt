[Bonus Track]

Into the darkness they crossed the marsh
And entered the frozen cave
A secret path was cut into the rock
A labyrinth, a twisted maze
An unknown misty haze

Khaas' eyes focused on the grey rock
He saw it in a different way
The riddle soon would be solved
An illusion was carved in the stone
The arrows show where to go

THEY ARE THE LAST HOPE
FOR MEN, DRAGONS AND DWARVES
SPIRITS OF THE FOREST
SHY ELVES AND TROLLS
FIVE GO FROM ELGARD
INTO THE DARKNESS LEAVING THE LIGHT
TO FIND THE BLACK ORDER'S
IMMORTAL DARK RHYMES
TO FIND THE WRITTEN WORDS
BY HELLGOD'S UNHOLY SON
PREVENT HIM FROM RETURNING
AND SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD
THROUGH THE VALLEY OF SIN
LED BY THE WHISPERS OF HOLY WIND
INTO DAR-KUNOR A NEW SAGA BEGINS

The well of dead souls appears
A red river's flowing inside
There's no way to cross
There's no way to climb
They wish they were birds and could fly
Fly to the other side

THEY ARE THE LAST HOPE
FOR MEN, DRAGONS AND DWARVES
SPIRITS OF THE FOREST
SHY ELVES AND TROLLS
FIVE GO FROM ELGARD
INTO THE DARKNESS LEAVING THE LIGHT
TO FIND THE BLACK ORDER'S
IMMORTAL DARK RHYMES
TO FIND THE WRITTEN WORDS
BY HELLGOD'S UNHOLY SON
PREVENT HIM FROM RETURNING
AND SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD
THROUGH THE VALLEY OF SIN
LED BY THE WHISPERS OF HOLY WIND
INTO DAR-KUNOR A NEW SAGA BEGINS

THEY ARE THE LAST HOPE
FOR MEN, DRAGONS AND DWARVES
SPIRITS OF THE FOREST
SHY ELVES AND TROLLS
FIVE WENT FROM ELGARD
INTO THE DARKNESS LEAVING THE LIGHT
TO FIND THE BLACK ORDER'S
IMMORTAL DARK RHYMES
TO FIND THE WRITTEN WORDS
BY HELLGOD'S UNHOLY SON
PREVENT HIM FROM RETURNING
AND SAVE THE WHOLE WORLD
THROUGH THE VALLEY OF SIN
LED BY THE WHISPERS OF HOLY WIND
INTO DAR-KUNOR A NEW SAGA BEGINS
