Over the mountains the first lights of dawn
the rocks around are covered by snow
[Iras Algor:]
"Come here my friends, enjoy this last view
the sunlight's reflections, the shy fading moon
Many legends told by the jesters
were inspired by the facts
of a time now forever gone
when our friends the elves lived in these lands
when our friends the elves lived in these lands"

OLD AGE OF WONDERS, OF ELVISH EMOTION
PROUDLY SURVIVED IN THE MYST OF THE STARS
MAGICAL DAWNS, HOLY VISION OF ANGELS
LONG TIME BEFORE THE ELVISH WARS
OLD AGE OF WONDERS, OF ELVISH EMOTION
PROUDLY SURVIVED IN THE MYST OF THE STARS
MAGICAL DAWNS, HOLY VISION OF ANGELS
LONG TIME BEFORE ALL
THE ELVISH WARS

"During the first six primordial wars
the elves found shelter between these wild rocks
at that time this region known as Irith
was green, majestic, heaven on earth
When the sixth war was sadly lost
for elves and unicorns this meant the fall
Nekron found a new reign to rule
so woods and flowers decided to die
rivers and falls became suddenly dry
from that time the cold darkness reigned
the darklands became what they are today
the darklands became what they are today"
