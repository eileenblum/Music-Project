[bonus track]

Neverending is my love for you, my Earth
More and more each day
Your greatness speaks to me

You deserve all the respect
From your sons for you've given us
The miracle of life

[Chorus:]
AND WE GO ON WITHOUT REFLECTION
ALWAYS FORGETTING WHO WE ARE
WE DENY HER OUR ATTENTION
THEN WE LAMENT WHEN LIFE IS HARD
TO THE WHOLE WORLD I PRAISE YOUR WONDER
YOUR BEAUTY AND YOUR MAJESTY
FOR YOUR SONS WHO NEED PROTECTION
I WILL SING AND ALL SHALL HEED

We prevent ourselves
From taking actions so
Thinking other people
Will do it for us

We always have better things to do
Mother Earth I hear your new call
I'll do the best for you

[Chorus]

[Solo]

You deserve all the respect
From your sons for you've given us
The miracle of life

[CHORUS]
