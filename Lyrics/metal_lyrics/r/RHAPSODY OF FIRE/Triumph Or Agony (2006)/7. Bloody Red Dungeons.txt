Lost in a sea of rising darkness
fear and devotion meet again
lost between rhymes of mystic splendour
heaven is back to war with hell

Nobody knows who planned that rock trap
wild and ancestral spider's web
evil and dark red bleeding dungeons
threat for the sake of mother earth

Since the black army won its last war
cold is the breath of ancient sin
rites of unhuman dark perversion
sad tragic years lost in the myth

THE SILENT RAGE OF GOD
ETERNAL HOLY CALL
RED SUN AND MOON COLLIDING
FROZEN SOUL

Shades of a velvet wide horizon
fear for a hopeless time to come
fire and ice, the white flame's courage
angels' immortal blazing sun
Lost in a sea of rising darkness
fear and devotion meet again
lost between rhymes of mystic splendour
heaven is back to war with hell

THE SILENT RAGE OF GOD
ETERNAL HOLY CALL
RED SUN AND MOON COLLIDING
FROZEN SOUL

Luna rossa, pianti, paure
rabbia, ira, urla, torture
innocenza persa per sempre
ombre vagano eterne

The silent rage of god, eternal holy call
Holy call

THE SILENT RAGE OF GOD
ETERNAL HOLY CALL
RED SUN AND MOON COLLIDING
FROZEN SOUL
