[Bonus track]

Mirrors reflecting
The broken illusion of one lost
And sinful Mind's eye protect me
While caught in this dark world of fear
And fading hope

My soul is worn

[Chorus:]
The sun lonely woes
Of innocence lost
In the shades now revealed
By a fate never told

A sea of new hope
Won't fear his reborn
In its waters we'll wait for
The great heaven's call

Fragments of tortured
Existence revealing cold whispers
Of lonely Ghosts, led by shadows
Enlightening the souls of all evil
Of darkened faith

And mortal pain

[Chorus:]
The sun lonely woes
Of innocence lost
In the shades now revealed
By a fate never told

A sea of new hope
Won't fear his reborn
In its waters we'll wait for
The great heaven's call

The call

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
The sun lonely woes
Of innocence lost
In the shades now revealed
By a fate never told

A sea of new hope
Won't fear his reborn
In its waters we'll wait for
The great heaven's call

The call
