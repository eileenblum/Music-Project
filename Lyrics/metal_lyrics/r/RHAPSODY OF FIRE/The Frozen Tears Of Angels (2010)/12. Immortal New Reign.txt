Into the wide, sinister, cold Darklands
One voice from the shadows is calling my name
Trapped in a lie of silence reflecting
The answers of fear and Heavenly woes

Now I know to whom I belong
Save me now from my darkest side
While your sacred flame
May wash all the sins from my bleeding hand

Into the eye of scarlet horizons
I pray that men sorrow have spoken my name
Nowhere to hide my darkest emotions
That innocents fell for the will of my hand

Now I know to whom I belong
Save me now from my darkest side
While your sacred flame
May wash all the sins from my bleeding hand

[Chorus:]
We are the vengeance of souls went in silence
We are the rage of the heavens in flames
We are the pride of the earth's holy dying
We are the angels' immortal new reign

We are the vengeance of souls went in silence
We are the scream for the new rising dawn
We'll give our lives to defend our kingdoms
We'll fight the hells at the end of the world

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
We are the vengeance of souls went in silence
We are the rage of the heavens in flames
We are the pride of the earth's holy dying
We are the angels' immortal new reign

We are the vengeance of souls went in silence
We are the scream for the new rising dawn
We'll give our lives to defend our kingdoms
We'll fight the hells at the end of the world
