[Khaas:] Where are we Iras?
[Iras:] Near to the doorway of hell...
[Dargor:] Can you  can you see?
[Tarish:] No, but we must press on... What is that?
[Khaas:] Howling... It's coming from everywhere!
[Iras:] Naroth... Run!

Running fast, chased by the Naroth, they face the avalanche

[All together:] What's that? The ground...!
[Khaas:] It's an avalanche!!
[Tarish:] No, hold on! Help me!

[Dargor:] Are there any injured? Are you well, my friend?
[Iras:] Yes
