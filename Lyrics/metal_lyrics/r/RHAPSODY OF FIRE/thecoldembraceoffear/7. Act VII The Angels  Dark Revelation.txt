[Iras:]
When I regained consciousness, I could see Dargor
And around him a mantel of snow
Oh, friends of the beloved lands  We had survived
Though racked with pain I called for the precious magic book
I opened it and immediately realized how lucky we were
Only a few pages were missing
Those glorious words written by an angel
Were there before my mortal eyes
This was a sight I had lived my whole life
Hoping one day to see

[King Uriel:]
All the divine wisdom of the angels
Was contained in those ancient pages
Tired and weary they came upon the village of Nairin
On the eastern side of the White Mountains
Home to the little elves  There they could rest
And Iras, after being cured by the elves' magic arts
Could finally examine the mysteries of Erian's work
But what he discovered in doing so, he never expected
Erian's words were not only completely clear
But they were tragic and prophetic as well
A revelation of angels
