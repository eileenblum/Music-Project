[Iras:]
What many believed was only a legend
Was now lying in front of me...
There it was... Erian's book of the holy angels
The testament of all the Heavens... beckoning to me
A black dragon made of stone stood guard over it
Threatening with outstretched wings
As I drew closer my heart pounded
But I cast off my fear and in the next instant
I opened the book

[King Uriel:]
What Erian had written 5.000 years before
Was now finally before their eyes

[Dargor:] Elf of the caves!
[Khaas:] Tarish, what in God's name are you doing?
[Iras:] You  insane  fool!
[Tarish:] I do what must be done !
[Dargor:] Let him go!
[Tarish:] Give me the book and I will spare the life of this old wizard!
[Lothen:] Traitor
[Iras:] He knows not what he's doing!
[Tarish:] I know very well what I am doing  Hand it to me!
Give it to me or he will die!
[Khaas:] All right  Take the book but let Iras go!
[Iras:] No !

[Iras:] Take it from him!
[Tarish:] Fools ! This belongs to the Black Order !
[Dargor:] Leave it  leave it!
[Khaas:] Ah  I'm bleeding!
[Lothen:] Help him!
[Iras:] Do not let him escape  Go after him! We must have the book
[Dargor:] I will return with it!

[Iras:]
As I lay wounded
An incredible pain shooting through my head
I saw Dargor struggling with Tarish  he won!
But before dying, the elf king was able
To tear some pages out of Erian's book
Then everything turned to black
