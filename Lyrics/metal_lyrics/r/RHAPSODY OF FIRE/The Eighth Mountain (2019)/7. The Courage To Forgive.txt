(Ten... years... by... since... gone... I... hate... what...)
(Did... to my life... to my soul... father, why... you, father)

Ten years gone by since you've gone and I still hate what you did to my life to my soul. Father, why? Why...

Ten years you wasted to shape your own son, to grow the perfect warrior
Ten stones on my back are crushing my bones, they're bending my spine
I'll get over it: I'll destroy my hate

Hard is the path when the memory makes you grieve
Painful, the memories are painful like a wound
Leave the past behind, find the courage to forgive
Painful, the memories are painful.
It's your duty, the contract says, "You have to forgive."

(Shades... dark... war... shield... sword... years... age... child...)
(Friends... and my hands... made to play... father, why... you, father)

Shadows of the war, a shield, a sword: despite my young age they were my close friends
Despite my hands were made to play, I learned how to kill... but why?

Life is a labyrinth of chances and leaps of faith, an endless dreaming
Maybe I wouldn't become brave like you, as strong as you were
I'll try to forget: I'll destroy my hate

Hard is the path when the memory makes you grieve
Painful, the memories are painful like a wound
Leave the past behind, find the courage to forgive
Painful, the memories are painful.
It's your duty, the contract says, "You have to forgive."

All the stars can't ignite the dark
I will burn my anger just to see the light, to rise again

Hard is the path when the memory makes you grieve
Painful, the memories are painful like a wound
Leave the past behind, find the courage to forgive
Painful, the memories are painful.
It's your duty, the contract says, "You have to forgive."
