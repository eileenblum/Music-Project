His voice can give comfort when you're down
Its sound strokes your hair like a breeze
His voice could warm the coldest places
The wise man still lives in our hearts

Still he cures memories
Still he builds stone castles
World's not the same right after you're gone

White wizard, your wisdom will exceed this time forevermore
White wizard now watch over us, guide our souls
You have seen dark future storms

From ashes to ashes the life still goes on
But God knows we miss you as well
From dust to dust the world goes on
We all wait for the rightful heir

Will he cure sickness?
Will he build new temples?
A warlock will come, as you, times before

White wizard, your wisdom will exceed this time forevermore
White wizard now watch over us, guide our souls
You have seen dark future storms

Who now fights for the righteous and the poor?
Serpents of evil emerge from the dark so... we need your help!

White wizard, your wisdom will exceed this time forevermore
White wizard now watch over us, guide our souls
You have seen dark future storms
Future storms...
