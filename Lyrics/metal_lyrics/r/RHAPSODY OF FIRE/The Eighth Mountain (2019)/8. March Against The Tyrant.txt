Look at the dawn, shining clouds and mountains
The cold morning wind makes me tear and think of you

Let me breathe it once more this time without chains
Let me feel once more how much life you have on your lips
...So kiss me

Look at the dawn, it could be the last time... The march has begun
Gates of steel and gold... The tyrant of Konstrukts this evening will fall
Unrightful King of the throne, the Nephilim's henchman will pay for all
691 sons were killed without mercy so... justice will come!

Trust in me as a leader, don't be afraid
We will march for brothers and sisters murdered
Trust in me: together we'll win!
Oculus domini, nobili animo

Freedom for the brave, hand-to-hand's what we crave
Ridin' for the land so these rocks will turn to sand
The tales will recall this glorious day

We struck evil guardians, they were flying blind
The only chance to break through the walls
Rain made of arrows and stones
Our shields were enchained, unbreakable chrome

Trust in me as your leader so we won't fail
We will march, the traitors tonight will dine in Hell
You'll see: together we'll win!
Oculus domini, nobili animo

Freedom for the brave, hand-to-hand's what we crave
Ridin' for the land so these rocks will turn to sand
The tales will recall this glorious day

When all seems so lost
The will can change your hope

A warrior I know from the east now is coming
He'll help us 'cause I spared his life
Like earthquake and storm we will scorch all this earth
And together we'll push deep the knife
The tyrant tonight surely dies

So the fortress is burning and the wine will flow with the songs
So raise your sword: the tyrant tonight will dine in Hell
Let's play the bells, let the world know we won, we're free!
Oculus domini, nobili animo

Freedom for the brave, hand-to-hand's what we crave
Ridin' for the land so these rocks will turn to sand
Freedom for a world where oppression and pain
Are just forgotten words of the Nephilim's empire
The tales will recall this glorious day
