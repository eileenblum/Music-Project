Warriors fighting
A thrill made of iron and steel
Charging horses
It's a never ending wheel

Due to my orders
A thousand lives are gone

Screaming louder from the cliff
I feel as a master of peace
But I can't face what I see what I feel
How to find my bliss?

Oh God I promised
We would go to war

The hills, the grass, the trees
Are slowly turning red
Forever and ever
These fields will taste of our blood

Father, forgive me 'cause I have no regrets
No complaints

Fifty thousand lost fallen souls
The victory needs sacrifice
And both of the armies have lost their half or more
I can't pay the price

Oh God I promised
We would go to war

The hills, the grass, the trees
Are slowly turning red
Forever and ever
These fields will taste of our blood

Father, forgive me 'cause I have no regrets
No complaints

All victories have a price

The hills, the grass, the trees
Are slowly turning red
Forever and ever
These fields will taste of our blood

Father, forgive me 'cause I have no regrets
No complaints

I got no regrets
No more

Oh God
No more
