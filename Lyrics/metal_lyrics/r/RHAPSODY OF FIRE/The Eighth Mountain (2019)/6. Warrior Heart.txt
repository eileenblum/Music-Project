Once more battle, (I) think it's my last stand
A lost soul is begging me raising his poor flickering hand

Should I not care for his silent cry? The honor, at least, will prevail
We've never been friends but I won't close my eyes: we lost our family to serve our flag

Under the steel of my enemy's armor is beating the same warrior heart
And though we both know how to kill without fear... we don't care if the world falls apart
And once in a while you will see me cry

Silence is everywhere, cold: the voices of death
Even the birds forgot how to sing
Struggling for one last breath

How could I be so disgustingly blind? Emotions are always the same
We've grown up apart, we lived separate worlds but... day and night live together and tamed

Under the steel of my enemy's armor is beating the same warrior heart
And though we both know how to kill without fear... we don't care if the world falls apart
And once in a while you will see me cry 'cause...
Under the steel there's a hero like me who is sharing the same warrior heart
I know we belong to this world full of fear, face to face with the scars you can't hide
And once in a while there's no shame in tears
