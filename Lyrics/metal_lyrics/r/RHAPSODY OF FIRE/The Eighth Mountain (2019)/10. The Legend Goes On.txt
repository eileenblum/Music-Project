Still the legend goes on and on...

I cast a spell and I've seen
Pieces of the future unveiled
Green are the valleys where I belong
I've seen the mountain still shining

People are dreaming
Singing a song
The ghost of war
Has disappeared

There were eagles flying in the sky
Over fields of gold
The kingdom of the magic
Reaching for the land for the dream
Stories still untold
Still the legend goes on and on

I've seen...

This night will soon be gone
Here comes the dawn
My contract will be up
I'll be free

No more revenge or darkness to heal
The orchards will all be in blossom
Love of my life is healthy and real
The ghost of war has disappeared

There were eagles flying in the sky
Over fields of gold
The kingdom of the magic
Reaching for the land for the dream
Stories still untold
Still the legend goes on and on

I've seen...

There were eagles flying in the sky
Over fields of gold
The kingdom of the magic
Reaching for the land for the dream
Stories still untold
Still the legend goes on and on

I've seen...
Finally I've seen...
