A tragic dark tale
A message of love
From no man's land I
I will follow ancient rhymes
Cut me and I will bleed
If that's all you want
My mind is free and I close my eyes
I'm waiting for changes
In this old world

Late just, just too late
To take a chance again

You, like a ghost that I feel
Makes me warm, makes me real
In my heart and my lonely soul

Tell me your secrets
Angel of light
Where time has no meaning
In cold winter nights

You, can you hear me
Are you there I know it's late

You, like a ghost that I feel
Makes me warm, makes me real
In my heart and my lonely soul

Tell me your secrets
Angel of light
Where time has no meaning
In cold winter nights

Tell me legends untold
When angels need to know how to fly
Let the dance of nature inspire me
And illusion and reality fades

Tell me your secrets
Angel of light
Where time has no meaning
In cold winter nights

Whispers and dark rhymes of
My angel and light
'Cause where time has no meaning
I'll stand with my pride, my pride
