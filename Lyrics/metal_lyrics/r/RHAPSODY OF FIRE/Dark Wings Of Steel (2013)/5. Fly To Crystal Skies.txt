In death we will live again
And feel magic flames

This night will fade, the sun will rise again
Remember tomorrow my friend

Fly to crystal skies
See the flames rising from my past
And we'll fly to crystal skies

Tomorrow it's so far away
In darkness we all will remain

This night will fade, the sun will rise again
Remember just sing in the rain

Fly to crystal skies
See my flames rising from the past
And the stars are brighter tonight

Rain fills the silence
I hear the cold wind call my name

Fly to crystal skies
See the flames rising from my past
And the stars are brighter tonight
Fly to crystal skies
Magic flames rising from the past
And we'll fly to crystal skeis
