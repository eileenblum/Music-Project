Tell me all the words that you have never said
Your tears of hope are now burning my skin
You say it all with your dark shining eyes
And wash away all my thoughts inside

No more love and no more pride
In the darkness I remain

In a lake of tears
I'll paint angel's dreams
Silver lake of tears
Where visions are real

You just believe what you want to believe
And what you get now is just what you need
Some killing time and some killing years
Just say the word, you know that I'm here

Anytime and everywhere
In the water I remain

In a lake of tears
I'll paint angel's dream
Silver lake of tears
Where visions are real

Turn your head up to the sky and don't
Don't let me go
In darkness we remain

In a lake of tears
I'll paint angel's dream
Silver lake of tears
Where visions are real

Real
Where visions are real
Silver lake of tears
