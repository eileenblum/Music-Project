Somewhere, somehow
I'll always be there
Listen in silence
Free from this chain

Immense
Le onde su me
And you know
It's not a dream anymore

Sad mystic moon with shades of grey
Breathing life into my dreams
Save my soul from endless pain
Wash with your flames all my sins

Listen, so silent
All this waves again
Thinkin' 'bout future looking through my past

Immense
Le onde su me
And you know
It's not a dream anymore

Sad mystic moon with shades of grey
Breathing life into my dreams
Save my soul from endless pain
Wash with your flames all my sins

Tormenti
Lamenti su me
Immense
Sono le onde su me

Sad mystic moon with shades of grey
Breathing life into my dreams
Save my soul from endless pain
Wash with your flames all my sins

Sad mystic moon with shades of grey
Breathing life into my dreams
And save my soul from endless pain
Wash with your flames all my sins
