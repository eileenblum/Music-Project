I need sometime
To understand
'Cause I'm still fighting
Along this cold land
Just look inside
Then start to think
Just leave me alone
See my sacrifice
Now

Time has come
Hear my confession
I was blind
Losing myself
Just hold me close
Just make me strong
Just tell me lies and
The visions of tales never told

E nella mente te!
I'm standing alone in a dream

My sacrifice
In this morning light
If I walk alone
Let this road lead me home

(The) Night has come
This time I'll be strong
Just take my hand and guide me away
Facing the fear, I'm losing myself again
Dark shadows, whispers
And sad rhymes in my restless soul

Eternamente in me!
Passioni, sospiri e te

My sacrifice
In this morning light
If I walk alone
Let this road lead me home

Sembri cercar
Momenti sognar
Di lontani cammini narrar
Resisti e ritorna mio eroe!

My sacrifice
And time passing by
If I walk alone
Let this road lead me home
Dark angel eyes
With a burning desire
In this morning light
Just where nothing is real
Is real
We'll found what we need
My love
Where nothing is real!
