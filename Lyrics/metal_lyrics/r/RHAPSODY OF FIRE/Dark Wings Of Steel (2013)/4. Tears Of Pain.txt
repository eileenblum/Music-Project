Electric whispers
Are falling with rain
Freeze my decisions
And my tears of pain
Spirits of winter
Are calling my fate
In this Hell's dominion
See my final day!

Di luce ed ombre
Io vivro!
Al mio destino gridero'!

I just want to live again
And listen all my tears of pain
Falling shadows, chains of fate
Embrace my soul, my tears of pain

Memories are burning now
Inside my brain
Shadows are calling
From a sea of rage
Old mystic vision
Come and bring me pain
And be my religion
Just take me away!

Di luce ed ombre
Io vivro!
Al mio destino gridero'!

I just want to live again
And listen all my tears of pain
Falling shadows, chains of fate
Embrace my soul, my tears of pain

Sento nell'aria
Pace ed odio tra me e te
Give me more, give me the light, the sign
It's my final day
Embrace my soul!

Di luce ed ombre
Io vivro!
Al mio destino gridero'!

I just want to live again
And listen all my tears of pain
Falling shadows, chains of fate
Embrace my soul, my tears of pain

Is this my final day?
Tears, fear, now inside my dreams
My tears of pain
