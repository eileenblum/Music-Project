[Digipak and Vinyl Bonus Track]Just one more candle to light
Before sleep takes me away
I saw you dancing' in the rain
With angels by your side and I am waiting

Just say a word and I'll be there tonight I know
The prayer that I whisper
I know it by heart, yes I know
Just one more favor from heaven
And I'll follow you into your dreams

Just fighting back frozen tears
Through all the miles, all these years

Close your eyes and fly
In her eyes I'll fly

This heart of mine
Has believed in love through time
And I still don't know
How much to say how far to go
You say it all with your eyes
Would you hear if I whispered your name?

Just fighting back frozen tears
Through all the miles, all these years

Close your eyes and fly
In her eyes I'll fly

One kiss, one touch, just one dream
Is all I need to hold on to
And when I close my eyes it's just
Your face I see
And it's always you and me
You and me

Just fighting back frozen tears
Through all the miles, all these years

Close your eyes and fly
In her eyes I'll fly

Close your eyes and fly
