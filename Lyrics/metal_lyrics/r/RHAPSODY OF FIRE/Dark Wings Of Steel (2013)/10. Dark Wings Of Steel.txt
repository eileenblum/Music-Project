Shine, fight, burn
Give me blood
Show flames with sorrow and pain

Cry, ride

Cry, die, ride
Chose the light
And your mind is never free, you bleed!
Die!

Nightmares are real
Spread your wings
And you feel, no pain, no fear

Eternal light
Of angels glory
With dark wings of steel
Riding from Heaven

Ride, die
Nightmares without end
Show no mercy
For the restless souls

Cry, ride, fight, die

You burn
Turn your head
Just give me the light
Just give me life
Sad wings of steel
Steel!

Nightmares are real
Spread your wings
And you feel, no pain, no fear

Eternal light
Of angels glory

Eternal light
Of angels glory
With dark wings of steel
Riding from Heaven

Eternal night
Of angels glory
With dark wings of steel
Riding from Heaven

Dark wings of steel
