I have just one tale of magic
And in the mirror all things are now clear
For all those tears we learned to hide
Our smiles will never be the same
For once in my life
The future is mine
It calls to me from the inside

Been waiting so long
Through your eyes I see forgotten worlds
Been waiting so long
They say all is fair in love and war

So close and so cold the water
If that's all you want and if that's all you need
I know that love is just another word
To say what I feel tonight
Into the mirror I'll found all the answers
Shivering memories untold

Been waiting so long
Through your eyes I see forgotten worlds
Been waiting so long
They say all is fair in love and war

I still believe that what we have been
Is what we are now
We all will be free
Into the mirror all things are now clear
Where nothing's real
Beyond light and dreams

Been waiting so long
Through your eyes I see forgotten worlds
Been waiting so long
They say all is fair in love and war

Is this
Is the mirror of life!?
Of life
