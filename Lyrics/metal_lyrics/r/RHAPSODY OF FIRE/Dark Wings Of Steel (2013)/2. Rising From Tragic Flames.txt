Save my soul
See the hands of time
My guide
Rise and just make me strong!

Too far horizons I'll follow your dreams
I'll search mystic flames
I will know my new fate
Shy mystic rain falling from angel's reign
Will color my visions
Will guide my new day

I will call your name again
Int his cold brave new world

Shades of gray and magic flames
Are facing tragic days
Fighting the ancient sin
I'll live and
In distant lands I will find all the answers
See tragic flames with the eyes of the angels
I'll fight and see my fate

Days of hope
And days of endless pain
Alone with my silent and restless soul

Distant horizons I'll follow your dreams
(I'll) Search mystic flames
(I'll) Know my new fate
Shy mystic rain falling from angels reign
Will color my visions
Will guide my new day

I will call your name again
In this cold brave new world

Shades of gray and magic flames
Are facing tragic days
Fighting the ancient sin
I'll live and
In distant lands I will find all the answers
See tragic flames with the eyes of the angels
I'll fight and see my fate

Are facing tragic days
Fighting the ancient sin
I'll live and
In distant lands I will find all the answers
See tragic flames with the eyes of the angels
I'll fight and see my fate
