Blue flame cavalry
Blue flame cavalry
Blue flame cavalry

A burning arrow climbs
Heads of steeds bent low
Await the riders!
Grant the sick ones release
Torches carry their color
Across the riven lands
Called to end the suffering!

Soak the robes in oil
Close your eyes to the blaze
A burning arrow falls and announces their doom
A decree of blue flame

The fires of purgation
Enveloped by the burning shroud
This town is tainted
A struggle to contain the plague
Masks upon their faces
Fill the wells with sand
The riders do not breathe the bitter dust

Soak the robes in oil
Close your eyes to the blaze
A burning arrow falls and announces their doom
A decree of blue flame
Soak the robes in oil
Close your eyes to the blaze
A burning arrow falls and announces their doom
A decree of blue flame

We must contain the region
We must contain the region
We must contain the region
We must contain the region

Blue flame cavalry
Blue flame cavalry
Blue flame cavalry

Blue flame cavalry
Soak the robes in oil
Blue flame cavalry
They cleanse the riven lands
Blue flame cavalry
A burning arrow climbs to call them
Blue flame cavalry
Contain the plague before it spreads
