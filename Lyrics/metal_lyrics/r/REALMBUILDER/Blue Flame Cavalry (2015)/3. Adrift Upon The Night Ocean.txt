His ship is taken
Far horizons retreat
The sun will not rise
Pale birds wheel across the night sky

The winds begin to speak

Adrift upon the night ocean
Adrift upon the night ocean
Adrift upon the night ocean
Adrift upon the night ocean

The ship decays
Uncharted seas
He talks to the waves
Set the wooden statues upon the water

The winds begin to speak

Adrift upon the night ocean
Adrift upon the night ocean
Adrift upon the night ocean
Adrift upon the night ocean

The horizon fades
The horizon fades
