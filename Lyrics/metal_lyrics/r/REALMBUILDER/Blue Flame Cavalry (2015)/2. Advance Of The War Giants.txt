The ground shakes
Sleepers are awakened
The tattoo of their approach
Relics fall from the wall
The gates burst
The ancient sentries stride
Shadows spread
As they advance

March - onward!
Attack the fortress - obliterate!
Swing the iron hammers against the wall
The tall ones stride through conquered lands
Advance! Advance! Advance!

The walls crack
Birds take to the air
Geysers signal their arrival
The war is here
Thunder echoes in the valley
Enter through the broken wall
Shadows spread
As they advance

March - onward!
Attack the fortress - obliterate!
Swing the iron hammers against the wall
The tall ones stride through conquered lands
Advance! Advance! Advance!

Behold the walkers
Smoke rises from the gauntlets
Air warps
They walk across the battlefield
Clothed in armor
They pull the plow of destruction
Air warps
White eyes shine upon grey skin

Advance! Advance! Advance!

Advance of the war giants
Advance of the war giants

Nothing can stop the advance of the war giants
Nothing can stop the advance of the war giants
They pull the plow of destruction!
Nothing can stop the advance of the war giants
They pull the plow of destruction!
