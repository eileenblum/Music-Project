Light it up!
Sparks fly as flames chase across the night
Black paste fills the cracks
Steel bites into the sacred stone

The sigils of pyromancy are carved into the mountainside

They write their names with fire
They write their names with fire

Carry the torches
A signal that can be read on the other side
Eyes flash with infernal life
A wake of blue flame
Claimed by fire
Light it up!

The sigils of pyromancy are carved into the mountainside

They write their names with fire
They write their names with fire

They write their names with fire
They write their names
Immortalized in flame
