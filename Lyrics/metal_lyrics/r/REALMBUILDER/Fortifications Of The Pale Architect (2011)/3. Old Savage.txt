Huddled before a dim fire long white hair knotted with bones
The open plains stretch in all directions
He cannot remain in one place for too long
Prison works its way to his heart he stirs from a fitful slumber

The moon turns red the fire begins to grow
He joins the fray battle calls the old savage
The fire begins to grow he outlives them all
His body creaks but still he fights he is a warrior born
The battle lust is always there

Three score years of bloodshed
He lost count of how many he has taken
The battle lust is always there
