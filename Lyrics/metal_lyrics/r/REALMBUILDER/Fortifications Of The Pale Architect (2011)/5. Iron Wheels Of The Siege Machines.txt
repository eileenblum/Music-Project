Take the banner spiked wheels turn
The sanctified lands defiled sword point recruitment
Advance the weapons of war burning trees fill the sky
Pour pitch onto their faces
Iron wheels of the siege machines no reprieve
Siege machines roll forward siege machines roll

The truce flag aflame tie off your wounds
Six commanders have died take their boots
Our enemies have gone to the tower
We must follow them there and burn them alive
Iron wheels of the siege machines no reprieve
Siege machines roll forward siege machines roll
Iron wheels of the siege machines keep pressing
Siege machines roll forward siege machines roll
