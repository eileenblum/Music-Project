We will dig here swing your pickaxe the vanguard presses on
Pry the stones loose work through the night
We must grow the barrier
Pull the tool wagon the wall that cleaves the world

We march at dawn proceed apace three towns have joined the cause
Climb the scaffold sun sears their eyes
Tempered steel falls again and again
Pull the tool wagon the wall that cleaves the world

Pull the gears turn
Pull the stones rise
Pull I command
Pull work or die
Fix the ladders stack the stones
We build the wall that shields the empire
Pull the tool wagon the barrier climbs
