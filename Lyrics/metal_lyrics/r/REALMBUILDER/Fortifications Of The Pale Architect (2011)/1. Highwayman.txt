He lets the axe fly yield your coffers or your lives
Corded muscle beneath weathered skin he fits a bolt to the twine
Eyes agleam within the copse like a wraith he appears
He does not have a name do not look in his eyes
Reign in give up your gold this road is his yield or perish
He is the highwayman

He takes what he wants a question earns a broken jaw
Brave men fall from their horses arrows in their necks
He is the brigand of the lowlands
He does not have a name do not look in his eyes
Reign in give up your gold this road is his yield or perish
He is the highwayman
This road is his
