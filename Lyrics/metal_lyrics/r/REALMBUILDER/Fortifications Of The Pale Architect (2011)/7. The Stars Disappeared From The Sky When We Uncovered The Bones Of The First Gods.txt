Our lives are short heartbeats
Our towns are stains upon their world
We are controlled we must remember the constellations
First gods worshippers are sacrificed
First gods we dream of the end beyond the veil

Do not look up the fires are blinding astronomers prophesize
Leave the fallen men we walk towards death
First gods worshippers are sacrificed
First gods we dream of the end beyond the veil

The stars disappeared from the sky when we uncovered the bones of the first gods
