The woods are gone a place where stars shine he tells the thoughts of others
Forgotten a thankless errand they abandoned him
The rain has turned cold lost halcyon
The minion is forgotten the minion is forgotten

The woods are gone the stars arranged by his lord winds carry
Forgotten a thankless errand they abandoned him
The rain has turned cold lost halcyon
The minion is forgotten the minion is forgotten
