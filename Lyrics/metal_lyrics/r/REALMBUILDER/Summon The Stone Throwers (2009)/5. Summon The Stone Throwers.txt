Boulders sit in a cave in the west the sun is obscured by smoke
Deep groans of the elders nine centuries in the dark

Repel the attackers put swords to their necks crows speed overhead
Repel the attackers put swords to their necks
Blow the ancient horn summon the stone throwers

In the wending hollows their flat heads rise from the dirt
the beasts of war ready the granite storm to the castle walls

Repel the attackers put swords to their necks crows speed overhead
Repel the attackers put swords to their necks blow the ancient horn
The walls have collapsed the siege machines roll
Blow the ancient horn summon the stone throwers
The beasts of war ready the granite storm
