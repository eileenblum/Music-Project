Brigands from the east comrades in bloodshed invade the village none left alive
Town after town they pour in from beyond
Raise the blades the reavers will have their way

Raised in the fury of battle years bleed together
Ninety-nine raids until he was brought down

Finish them all stride from the smoke burn the long hall a path declared by a sword
He writes his legacy in blood doors hang from hinges the plague marches on long killing years
The buildings burn he does not dream cries borne on cold winds his name was lost long ago
