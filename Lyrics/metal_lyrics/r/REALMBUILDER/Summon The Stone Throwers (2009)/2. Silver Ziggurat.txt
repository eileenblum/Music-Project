An unheeded altar rain falls around it
All who enter forget themselves

Compelled to go the voice calls what is this place?
A fever burns in my mind the tattoo of one million hammers
An artefact of aeons ageless on a dying world
A jagged shadow is cast by the silver ziggurat

Captives return secreted away
Far beyond the mountains
A prison for the sun and moon
