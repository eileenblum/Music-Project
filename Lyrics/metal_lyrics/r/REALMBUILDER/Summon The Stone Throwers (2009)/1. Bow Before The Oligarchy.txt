Bow before them compelled to kneel avert your eyes
Years of crawling lost halcyon three years of dusk
A dark arrival a blade slices then from now hills filled with the dead

Their hissing words are serpent threats sword point genuflection
Their homes have all been burned
Chained to unfinished work
Chained the fettered ones perish
Bow before them compelled to kneel avert your eyes
