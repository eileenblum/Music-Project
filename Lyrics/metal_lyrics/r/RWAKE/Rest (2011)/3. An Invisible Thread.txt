nothing last forever un relived
when all the others give and fucking take
user suck the life to fucking live
imitate life but never recreate

if we knew there would be no fit
if you think you know then youâre fucking full of shit
look around you and embrace it
the long road to hell with no regret

now you feel it cause youâre sick at your stomach
itâs a feeling that no one can run from
itâs a haunting and the sickness is the demon
exorcise through suicide and reason
