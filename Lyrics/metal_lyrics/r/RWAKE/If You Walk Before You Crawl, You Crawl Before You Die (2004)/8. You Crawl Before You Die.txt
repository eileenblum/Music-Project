âAll right Iâm coming out,
and any man i see out there Iâm gonna kill him,
any sonnuvabitch takes a shot at me,
Iâm gonna kill him, and Iâm gonna kill his wife, and all his friends,
and burn his damn house down!â

until the end of time
the slaughter infested the city limits and county lines
born outlaws and molded into chrome
the very elements inside of the bone
fire in marrow
spheres carrying trees
possessed pick up trucks and pairs of sluts blackened pond scum
and mothers that cry
if you walk before you crawl you crawl before you die
