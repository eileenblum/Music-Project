i can't believe you're still dragging that shit around with ya,
just figured you'd be a lilâ more philosophical about it
and cut it the fuck loose,
and when a man sticks a gun in your face you got two choices,
you can die,
or you can kill the mother fucker.
our life a forgotten thought i feel like Iâm never gaining ground
your birth from the loop and you'll die in the black loop
an answer i will never find i feel like Iâm never gaining ground.
power of dust given life forms of drugs create the flight
consumed planets run through shape metal
a force that feeds forge into the laws of space and the origin of the universe
unleashing the end of life super science and sorcery
orbit into the future by going light years downwards.

my first instinct was to beat the hell out of ya, you know that dontcha?
