Phase transitionsThe Universe changes its formAnd its properties into waterWater changes its formAnd to the swine though the divideHe loses mind and his designCreate, evolve and alignThe seventh dayDesign Earth two angelsCarry out warIn the name of GodKill fight conquer Followers of Christ assumeEviticus exodus hexagramIan omps psalmsEvolve become none
