a symbol appears before
us...high above the clouds
to gaze upon it mortal one,
would mean the end of doubt
all the men out here today,
will fall at our hand
the chosen few,
defenders and protectores
of the land

a book of secrets lies within
for all of us to read
to swear the oath
and hail the sign never
break the creed
countless men have gathered here,
the keepers of the faith
immortal and untiring
with one voice they exclaim...
"hear us, praise us, take us,
to our land far away..."
