silence enrobes the land as
the gargoyle spreads his wings
to rule over centuries
of many a wicked thing
the wrath of ages in his eyes
as he sets into the night
the moon's eclipse obscures him
now as he ends his silent flight...

you fall...a victim of his spell
to the witchery of fright
as the gargoyle's eyes ablaze
like the fire in your heart
the anthem of the damned
entombed in the sands of time
never to return,
a beast right out of hell

...a beast right out of hell

dark forms surround the shroud
where a watchful eye awaits
the rebirth of the moon
the tide of endless gloom
upon a silent hill that night
a sorcerer casts his spell
to reawake the dormant gargoyle
to serve him till the end...
