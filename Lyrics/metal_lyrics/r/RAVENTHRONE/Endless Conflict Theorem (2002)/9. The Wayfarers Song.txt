the rain is clearing
over my father's land
a cloud in the distance fades away
over hilltops a gust
of wind now sharply blows
bringing the mist down
low unto the sea

thousands of feet way up
above th land
an eagle dares
and spreads his wings
a kingdom of silence
where only you may go
across the wide open seas
and ports of call...

haste not now,
as the night will fall
bring us a tale from your
homeland far away...
gather here at the fire pit,
the share the glory of old
visit the places that dreams errect
the lands that are found
very far from here
see the ruins as they drape
the horizons
kissing the sky farewell

the robe of dusk now engulfs
the world again
a river mutters its lullaby
so silently
a gust of wind carries
the song away
to weary heroes who follow the
serenades...back home
