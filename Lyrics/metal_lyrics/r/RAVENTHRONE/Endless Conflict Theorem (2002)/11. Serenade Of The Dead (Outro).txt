serenades, composed by the dead to hail the end
from the graveyards comes an eerie sound
like an air from the shrouds below

fearful eyes, like the gaze of a child on a stormy night
the silence is broken now...

all music &amp; lyrics written by ray wells during
a truly cold canadian winter...
"endless conflict theorem" was recorded,
mixed and mastered by martin schirenc
at the vato loco studio, vienna austria (summer 2001)
produced by ray wells and martin schirenc

drums performed by mike groeger
guitars, bass, keyboards and vocals performed by ray wells

cover artwork &amp; design by jacek wisniewski

thanks to all individuals, magazines, radio stations, spirits and demons that have supported raventhrone in the past, present, and future...too many to mention, but you know who you are and where you dwell!

...this album dedicated to my wife karin...
