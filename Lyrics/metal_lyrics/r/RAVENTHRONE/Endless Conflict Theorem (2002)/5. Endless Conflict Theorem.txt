born of high and might lands of lore
a legion of riders from an ancient time
the rage of batle in their darkened eyes
together they will into glory ride

high above among the restless clouds
a raven sings its song into the night
lightning shines a beacon far ahead
announcing now the coming of the end

valleys now tremble
to the war cries miles away
in the glens the water freezes
as a cold hand brings dismay
a dark stone rises far into
the clouds way up high
and greeted by a thunderstorm
we chant a battle cry
honor is enthroned
again as the one eternal heir
with fearless might our legions
rule our enemy ensnared

the sound of thunder rumbles
in the palace of the gods
the chariots of fire leave
a trail of death and blood
from ancient times they have returned
to judge the hearts of man
to slay the weak and praise
the strong to hold
up high their flame
