i float away now gently from this world
from my body i'm expelled, as i enter far beyond
i exit life and enter death and see the eerie light
it calls to me so softly and bids me to come in
thousand miles above the ground...i am as light as air
i cannot hear yet i'm not deaf, i see yet i feel blind
as i float above the world i hear the creature's voice
a soft and mellow lullaby cradles me to death
the earth realm seems so far away as night begins to fall
ascending now to eternity to join the stars way above the ground

stand here now before the throne, stand now to be judged
as a wicked soul with eyes of fire rises to be heard
a circle of demons winged and grim stand to guard the hall
the lick of eternal fire seers your flesh to bones
a scream of anguish breaks the silence, the silence in the sky
as a black cloud brews a thunderstorm that tremors all around
one by one the demons fly, fly to seek their prey
the legions of pandemonium, the soldiers of the grey
