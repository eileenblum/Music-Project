laughter in the castle halls has faded dead away
the rooms around lie empty now as winter brings dismay
deep within the castle walls a spirit wanders free
the undead soul of centuries past, kept from heaven's door

around the towers of this castle darkness drapes the land
a fog now draws upon the hills engulfs the hillside grand

the undead faces in the silent halls
a gloomy picture painted on the walls

of demons and darknes we are told a tale
an ancient story everyone, everyone must hail...

the road to the castle is paved in blood tonight
the life force of the innocent, victims of the fight

i feel the presence all around us now
as voices whisper silently, whisper to the clouds
