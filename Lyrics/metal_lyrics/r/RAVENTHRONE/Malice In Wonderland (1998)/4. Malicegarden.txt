Deep in the twilight lurks a somber place
People call it Malicegarden
A realm of sadness the throne of the dead
Where sunlight is as rare as laughter

Leaving our world to enter Malicegarden
A journey that will last forever
A legion of mourners crying the past
Bedding the remnants deep in silence

Cross the portal and step in Malicegarden
Touch the fruit of everlasting glory
Here we will dwell praising endless darkness
Here we will stay for now and ever

Inducing oblivion the sinister path
Where this garden lies...
Of malice and grievance the creatures will tell
A fate lost in ages past
The throne of destruction, the passionate fruit

Only beyond death it grows,
for those who enter here

Beyond this hill of fouling flesh
Beneath the sea of tears
Lies the heart of Malicegarden
The castle of ill faith...
