Pale horizons somber taint
The coming of an age
Here we dare and step beyond
A land unknown to us
See the undiscovered side
The region of the dead

Unseen on breaths of wind we ride
Unheard to cars of man or beast
Pale the faces in the shroud
Calling us to leave this world
From a slumbers silent dream
To the end a corpse will bring

From a slumber unsilent
To the throne supreme
Immortal and defiant against the world we stand
Restless and soulless, rapture of peace
Devouring the hearts of man.
