A raven will come in the solstice divine
And bring the truth upon mankind
The blade and the shield will speak of war once again
The hills will bed our fallen men.

The sound of steel breaking bones of our foes
Avenging the lies of the past
To battle we march singing songs to the brave
To conquer weakness from within
Then will come a better time after this
A time of shining steel and pride...

Here I roam obscured and lonely
Haunted by an angel
No one can see what the gloom withholds
Ha... the shine is blinding
Abigor the host, the warrior soul
Gather beside me your legion

"...We cast our spell and praise the goat
The warriors of the night..."

"...Conquer the Raventhrone..."

Here I am on the world's darkest side
Where the wind unsilent blows
Crystal eyes as I'm ready to fight to reach what will be mine again
Blade of steel and a spirit strong and proud
I am the wolf among the flock
Marching forward never turning back
Ahead there my future lies
Silence will come to the world all around
When I kill my foes with rage
Then will come a better time after this
A time of shining steel and pride...
