Insomnia, greetings abductress of light
Abhorrence 'tis the ravenous time
Coming to burn in the lake of damnation
The echo of time
Grieving the terror the harsh one's death
Embrace darkness the kiss of the beast

The alpha, conspiracy of evil
The summon... possessed
Downward the Anfang of demise... we weep
Rampant the sight. Clairvoyant...
Fire evil destruction and hate
Endless black silent our fate

Master of evil... the sign of the horns
Painting the world with blood...
