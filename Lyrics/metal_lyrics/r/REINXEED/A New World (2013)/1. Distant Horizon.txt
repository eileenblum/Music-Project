I've opened the gate to a new world beyond the horizon
Where we'll go tomorrow
We travel through time and galaxies
Imagine the stars
One simple melody will open up the gate

Follow me into a world beyond the stars
Beyond your dreams where oceans lies before your eyes
Hope for mankind never dies

Imaginationland have called for our dreams
Where fantasy is real

One mission: To stop the darkness
From further beyond our dreams and imagination
With power much stronger than a thousand truths
I know we'll prevail

The night is clear, the moon is shining when it's time to go
Follow me...

Just follow the stars and home is not far away
Beyond the horizon we'll find our way
Through darkness and fear
The purest of heart will lead us the way

So follow me to the distant, the distant horizon
No more fear of darkness
Only the light will prevail here and now
The shining star from paradise has shown us the gate
To a world where eternity waits
Where our dreams will be eternally

Follow me...
Stars, I can bring you stars, I can bring you fantasy
Only with the light...
