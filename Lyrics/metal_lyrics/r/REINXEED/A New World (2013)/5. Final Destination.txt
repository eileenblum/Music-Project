When you're on your own facing the world alone
You can never be sure
But I do know that you and I includes in the plan
I was your knight that was holding you tight forever
Now when those days are over, I know you will prevail

Final destination, we have heard it's call
And we will never stop the fight
I hear you calling for me

People dream all night, all day and all morning
But all won't come true!
You're the one I'm searching for
So where can you be now?

Open your eyes, there's a world outside that's hiding
Even the strongest man is weak, but you know I will prevail

Final destination...
