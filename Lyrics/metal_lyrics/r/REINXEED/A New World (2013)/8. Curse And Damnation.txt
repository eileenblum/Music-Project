An old Egypt treasure was found long ago
Belonged the tyranny of an old king
Curse and damnation was carved in stone
Only if they could have taken it serious
With the treasure found they were going
Down the river of Nile
He slipped with his gun and he fired a shot to his friend

Hear the night is calling! It's calling for you for
Curse and damnation on board this ship
Can you see the sign, the sign of the stars that tells me
Of a curse and damnation tonight?

Anyone who touches the treasure by hand
Brought on themself a curse until they die
Came to England to be a part of their lives to
Show the world what they have found, but did they know?

Once you have touched it you're knocking on heaven's door
The only way to be free is to send it away, far away!

Hear the night is calling...
The sign of the stars that tells me no chance for salvation
The curse and damnation is here

Only one thing left to do; sail it across the world
Ship from Southampton they're passing the
Curse and damnation on board

Hear the night is calling...

This is no vacation; no chance for salvation
The curse and damnation is here
