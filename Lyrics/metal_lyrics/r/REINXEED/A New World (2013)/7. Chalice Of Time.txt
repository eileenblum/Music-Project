There's a cold in his eyes as he's waiting to fall
When the hope fora  new world is gone
He stands on the edge, his vision is clear
But has he the courage for one last step?
Now the time has come for one more decision
Will it be wrong or right?
The end of the tunnel will show you the light
But also a path far away from paradise

"Follow the stars and don't look back"
Have always been said through hard times
"Always sunshine will come after rain"
But sometimes the comfort in words have to end!

Riches and gold, for what you have sold
Falling towards the end, not so cold
No more your prime fills the chalice of time
More than one way to go, more than one way to find
How the story of your fate will end...

Taking the strongest belief in your deeds
Knowing that down this will lead
Feeling no pleasure in selling your soul
Hardly the finest of ways to reach your goals

For the woman he cared so much for he could die
But not even the Devil can find such control
To deceive a heart, to deceive a life
So for nothing you traded your soul

"Follow the stars and don't look back"
Have always been said through hard times
"Always sunshine will come after rain"
But sometimes the comfort in words have to end!

Riches and gold...

Turning his head to the sky in need for help
"Save my soul from fire!"
Turning away, stares the beast in the eye
"You have no power, my soul belongs to the sky..."
