I open up my eyes in a new world
The ocean guides my way back to you
I've been away for years, found my call
Now the sound of tomorrow, a light that I've borrow
Will hopefully guide my way home

In our hearts we carry on!
We follow the stars down the stream
When we sail the ocean and cross the sea
We've come to the start of our journey home

Now I'm coming home
This has been a journey to feel free and alive
But wind flies and calls my name, I here them now:
Now there's no more tomorrow, the light that you borrowed
Will guide you and lead you back home

In our hearts we carry on...

We have always carried on!
We followed the stars down the stream when
We sailed the ocean and crossed the sea
Ending our journey back home
We sailed the ocean and we crossed the sea
Now ends our journey home

So many years gone by but finally
I found my way back home to you
