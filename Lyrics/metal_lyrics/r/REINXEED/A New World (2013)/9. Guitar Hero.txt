Faster, "Faster" you must go, to realize your fate
It's a destiny of loneliness 'cause for you it is to late
You're hiding in your chamber and you think you are a star
You're such a fool believing that someday you will go far

Floating away into a dream when
Green, red, yellow soon appear
Notes flying fast on the screen before you
But there is one thing I can't get, please don't tell me!

Why won't you take control of your life?
I'm asking you don't tell me why 'cause I don't understand
And I don't wanna know why you play the game
All right, so you think you're a hero
For playing your guitar with no string?
But you're just a zero who doesn't know a thing

You take me to your dark and secret chamber, your domain
Behind these walls you say that you're a king

Now that's insane!
You score a million for a crowd that don't exist
If your carrier would end today, well you will not be missed

Do you think you're the truest of the true?
You're hiding away from your reality
Stand up and shot 'cause no one will hear you!

Why don't you take control of your life...
