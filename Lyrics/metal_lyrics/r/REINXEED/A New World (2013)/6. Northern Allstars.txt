Champions united, our reign has begun!
Nordic alliance, together as one!
Our goal is the victory, we will never surrender
Cheer out and reach for the stars when we sing:
This is where we stand!

Ain't gonna stop 'til we reach for the top
We're the northern allstars!
From mountain and trees, through the hills and the sea
Hear the northern allstars!

United we stand, we're the "Nordic Land!"

In it to win it is all we believe
In the south where we stand up and fight
There's no truth, there's no glory
But sometimes we all make it through hand in hand
This is where I stand!

Ain't gonna stop...

United we stand, what a glorious feeling
For all and everyone
