Listen the bell how it rings in the night
The hour of midnight strikes once again
Close all your doors, all your windows
'Cause soon they'll be here
I feel them march all around us with nowhere to go
Someday they will find the peace they search
Enter the gate to their heaven and peace will be found
They know that we still belong here on earth
Our time soon will come
They will guide us the way...

If you feel like there's someone there beside you
They won't be shown in darkness after all
Fly away
On the other side we'll meet again tomorrow
Fly away, into darkness you will go

Fly away

"Into the Darkness!"

Into the darkness the spirit's alive
They try to deceive our destiny, things to be done right
Before they can cross to the other side
This is their final chance just to do things right
For bad things they've done in their life
Mystical nightmares have tortured these spirits
But now they're free

Now they are free
They're so alone out there, no one to give a helping hand
What they need, is a light in the dark

If you feel...
