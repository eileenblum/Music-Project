He came over the hills from an empty room
his days in paradise were dark but then he realized
That when dark times appear to you
Keep rocking every night
But in the wishing well he's crying in the shadows
Wild frontiers bring the shadows of the past to our future
We are all victims of the night

Take a little time and run for cover
Reach up for the sky, you'll find no other
Far away up high the melodies of your life
In the distance I hear
Like a teenage idol you're a star
One day you're so far away, will I see you again?

Far above the ocean sky you can see a light
A light, away so far
The melodies of a shining star
When the time has come for us to go to paradise
We will all see that the messiah will come again

Back on the streets we know, the fighting has begun
Is this the end of the world?

Take a little time...

A hymn for the star
High up in the sky your melodies goes
On and on and on and on...
