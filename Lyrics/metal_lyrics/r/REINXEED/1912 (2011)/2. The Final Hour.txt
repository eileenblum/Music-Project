(Save us tonight
From deep unknown
Time's running out
This is our final hour)

Water's closing in on left and right
From every side
Nowhere to run or to hide
Only a few lifeboats hanging around
Others have gone to sea twenty in one
Only twelve in the first
In Belfast they filled up with sixty men
And if you have money to spare
Then someone could save your life

Only way to find a way out
Is to go around the boat
And blinded you search for hope
Take control of your own life
When twenty other people
Try to find a way to survive

[Chorus:]
Save us tonight
From deep unknown
Time's running out
This is the final
Death lurks below
Nowhere to run
This is their final hour

Struck by ice in the middle of the night
The only thing to do is try to survive when
The water draws near
Only one degree and if you're lucky maybe two
The water will take your life
Lifebelts on and you're ready to go
You feel now how death crawls nearer
Who should we blame, should we blame the ice
Or the people who starred the boat?

Fifteen hundred people made their grave
Out in the water on that night (on that night)
Everyone will be remembered
See your life it flashes before your eyes

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Save us tonight from deep unknown!
Time's running out!
This is the final hour!

[Chorus 2x]
