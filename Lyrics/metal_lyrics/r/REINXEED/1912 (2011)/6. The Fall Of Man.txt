The vessel began the maiden voyage from
Southampton, England bound for New York
Tenth of April nineteen twelve
With captain Edward Smith in command
On the darkest night of Sunday fourth of April
Nineteen twelve, four hundred miles south of Grand banks spotted
An iceberg ahead of the ship

Oh, they turned from the danger to late
Caught in the middle of north of Atlantic
Where nowhere a rescue could be

[Chorus:]
If we fall, we would die
We would go with honor
Standing in line
For the last time
We won't be afraid
We are tall, we stand
Darkest of night is upon us
And we stand and
We fight 'til the end to survive
It's the fall of man

The first lifeboat launched
Was lifeboat seven on the starboard side
With twenty people on board
Out of a capacity of sixty five
Orders were given by captain Smith
"Women and children first"
First class, second class
The third had to sneak on board to survive

Oh, the tragedy in the middle sea
Caught in the middle of north of Atlantic
Where nowhere a rescue could be

[Chorus]

"CQC SOS CQC
Stuck by an iceberg
Sinking fast
Need assistance
We're going down
I repeat, we're going down"

[Solo]

The vessel began the maiden voyage from
Southampton, England bound for New York
Now the Atlantic Ocean is a grave for the maiden
(This is the fall of man)

[Chorus]
