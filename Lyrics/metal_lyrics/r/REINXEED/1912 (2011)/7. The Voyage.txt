Welcome to all, climb aboard
To the biggest luxury that man has build
Sail far away for a new horizon, everyone's invited
All alone on the ocean they declined
The warnings that they've got
"Iceberg ahead, if you turn it's too late"
But no one cared

[Chorus:]
Over two thousand souls on this floating kingdom
Reaching for newer skies and horizons
Far away you hear them say
Save our souls, come and take us away
We are all alone
Nobody hears when we're calling
Terror on the middle sea
Is this it, the voyage of our dreams?

Twelve o'clock, Southampton
Tenth of April nineteen hundred twelve
All alone on the ocean for one week
Until they'll reach their destination
So many great expectations
Oh so many questions heard
"Is it true what they say?"
Then we'll go down and pray
For all their lives

[Chorus]

Then the night closes in and the only light
Is the moon that shines on the sea
Up ahead in the distance something
Great and white appears to be
Iceberg ahead, they tried to lean
To starboard side in the night
Our glorious kingdom, lost at sea forever

[Solo]

Left for sea that shiny day, no one saw her again
Carved in all our memories, we remember you

[Chorus]

Is this it, the voyage of our dreams?
