Biggest creation known to man
A luxury on the sea
And now it's time to set another sail
We must go now, faster so we
Can reach our goal
Yet by another morning star
More steam into the engine
Hear now how we roar
Another day will shine
And faster we must go

[Chorus:]
I would give all I had
For just one more day
To show the world
If you believe you can achieve
I'd give up all I had
If moments could stay
But realize we must go faster

We must go faster

Can you imagine what they would say
If we arrived not as planned?
Steam up the engine
Put the level to the max
Headlines waiting for us if we
Can reach our goal
Yet by another morning star
More steam into the engine
Hear now how we roar
Another day will shine
And faster that we go

[Chorus]

Let's go

[Solo]

Another day will shine
And faster we will go

[Solo]

[Chorus 2x]

Now
