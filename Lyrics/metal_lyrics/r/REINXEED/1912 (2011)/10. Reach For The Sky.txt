I feel the wind blowing in my hair
In the north Atlantic
Standing before the head of the ship
Feels like I'm the king of the world

[Chorus 1:]
Raise my arms up high into the sky
Screaming for my life
I'm the king of the world

[Chorus 2:]
Reach for the sky where the birds fly so high
New life begins on the other side
Taking control of my life once again
Now and forever I will reach the sky

The red and the blue
And the holy white
Only a few days away
Taking my time
On the ship of dreams
Leaving everything behind

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

Now and forever reach the sky
If you do believe
In happiness don't cry

[Solo]

[Chorus 1]

Reach for the sky
Where the birds fly so high
New life begins on the other side

[Chorus 2]
