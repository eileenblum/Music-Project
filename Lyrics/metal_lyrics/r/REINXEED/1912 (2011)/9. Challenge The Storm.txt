Take her to sea and further beyond
New distant skies and horizons
Hear me now, the maiden from
Ireland will sail across the sea

I have been told to steam up the heat
Faster we go with coal on our feet
Lightning strikes, so far away
But yet we are there

[Chorus 1:]
Rise to the sky, in heaven we belong
We know what's been told, together we are strong
We are on the biggest ship of history

[Chorus 2:]
Light's out, the night closes in
Warnings have made us believe
Into the sky you can smell the ice (smell the ice)
So why should we be told of danger?
Why should we care?

[Chorus 3:]
(Challenge the storm)
I know we will pass right through
(Challenge the storm)
Hear out thunder crying out
(History's born)
Knowing we're unsinkable
Made of steel, unstoppable
Now when we're challenge the storm

Pull up the anchor we're leaving the shore
Set up the engine, we're setting the course
Wind blows, the sirens calls out in a mighty roar

As we sail into the ocean
This maiden of steel will put us in motion
Set me free so far away on this black hearted sea

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

See the light of the legacy
In the great hall of the magic night
Heading for eternity, the northern sky
Will shine like "Shyrheny"

A crash would be our kingdom fall
End of this beautiful journey
All would go, burning flames
Shining up like heavenly fire
But we're unsinkable

[Solo]

Deep under sea I'm invincible
'cause I would never lie
Once upon a time when the melody of life
Could sing "Atlantis, give me
A second chance to show my paradise"
Here in neverland the majestic lightning
Strikes again when the sword in stone
Forever carry on

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

(Storm of fire hides the night now)
