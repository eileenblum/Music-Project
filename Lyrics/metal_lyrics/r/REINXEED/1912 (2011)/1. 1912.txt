Go faster they say
No time to turn from the ice
To turn is too late
The damage is done
There's no way

Hear the chimney cry
One last time
Before they'll die
In the Atlantic sea
All will go tonight
Away (into the night)

[Chorus:]
She was said to be unsinkable
But she's made of iron
Nothing else could take her down
Until that tragic night
Nineteen twelve

The number of lifeboats
Compared to the people on board
There's not enough room
For us all, half must die

Hear the children cry
One more time
Before they'll die
In the Atlantic sea
They will go tonight
Away (into the night)

[Chorus 2x]

[Solo]

Hear the children cry
One more time
Before they'll die
In the Atlantic sea
They will go tonight
Away!

[Chorus]
