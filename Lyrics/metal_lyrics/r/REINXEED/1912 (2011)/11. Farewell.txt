On a cold dark winter night
When the moon light owns the night
A mighty steamer born on Ireland
Came to see its end
With the speed of twenty one knots
As they go through the night
There was no time to escape its destiny

See now when the moon hits their eyes
As the only light they have

[Chorus:]
Out in the night you hear them crying
No time to say farewell
There was nothing we could do
More than enough were bound
To haunt the sea when the night was done
In the morning all was gone

Ancient stories tell of curse
And damnation on the ship
The voyage of their dreams
Turned into the nightmares
As they tried to lean to starboard side
They were hit by the ice
There was no time to escape its destiny
So see now when the deepest of sea
Come to claim the ship to its fate

[Chorus]

Someone is screaming
Fear not you'll be dreaming
More than fifteen hundred
People in that water died

[Solo]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
