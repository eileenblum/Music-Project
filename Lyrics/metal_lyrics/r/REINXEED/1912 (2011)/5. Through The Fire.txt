People running from left to right
Trying to find a way to survive
When the water draws near and
All the lifeboats are almost gone

But sadly to say there's no way
When they save all the people
According to the class they live

All hope is gone and the
Only thing left is to pray
Pray for a closure that
Their souls would be saved

Through the fire (fire burns)
Water turns into graves
Through the fire (fire burn)
Their live will not
Be the same in the night

Hear the band, they start to play
To calm them down but why?
Knowing that soon the ice-cold water
Reaches your heart
Then you feel it starts to burn
No matter which way you turn
Two hours or so then
It lies on the bottom sea

Traveling in third class then
Life boat's no option for you
So many people gone, so many lost

[Chorus:]
Through the fire (fire burns)
Water turns into graves
Through the fire (fire burn)
Memories will remain
Through the fire (fire burn)
Only way to survive is desire (fire burn)
If only we would have known what to come

[Solo]

Help's on the way but
Four hours is too long
All would be gone lost at sea
We honor you

[Chorus]

Through the fire
Through the fire
