(Time's running out)
The tide is rising
(Time's running out)
You hear them screaming
(Nowhere to run)
When the clock is ticking
(Nowhere to hide)
For some the judgment day
Has arrived tonight
Why? Why? Why?

Terror and fear crawls up your skin
When the surface draws you nearer
The bottom of the ocean drags you down
Like thousand knifes you feel the cold
The captain takes his whiskey
As he welcome his own destiny
"You're on your own" his last words
Now there's nothing we can do

Caught in the middle of the Atlantic sea
Hear them now, screaming out

[Chorus:]
Do not fear my friend
Life will never end
Some will never see
Their families again
For some this is the end
When the terror has begun

Nineteen twelve, the year the biggest tragedy occurred to all
Women and children first on board the lifeboats
Say farewell! Say farewell to your loved ones
You will meet them on the other side
Who could tell that so many lives
Were lost at sea that night?

Caught in the middle of the Atlantic sea
All alone in darkness
Hear them now, screaming out

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Caught in the middle
Of the Atlantic sea

[Chorus 2x]
