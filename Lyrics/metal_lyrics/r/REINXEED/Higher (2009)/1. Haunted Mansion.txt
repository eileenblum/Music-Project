Now as I open up
My eyes to see the moon arise
I feel I'm not alone
The stories they told
The ghost on the hill

They said he had a friend
Long before his life would end
But we fell over him
To get what he wants
The friendship must end

It's a life of happiness would end so soon
Into the night he ran away
Far from the house where he ended the life of his friend

Deep in side of this haunted mansion
The spirit lies
Try to run you can never hide
From the ghost of the hill!

Open up your eyes
See him passing by
In this haunted mansion!

He tried to walk away
From this everlasting pain
Of being all alone
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to be
One night he fell asleep
Never to wake up anymore
Now he is bound to his mansion until his eternal day

Deep in side of this haunted mansion
The spirit lies
Try to run you can never hide
From the ghost of the hill!

Open up your eyes
See him passing by
In this haunted mansion!
