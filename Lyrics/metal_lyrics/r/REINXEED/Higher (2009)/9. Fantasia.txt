Open the door
tell the me the stories,
of the world deep inside our mind.

There have been told,
that one day a savior will come,
will keep his heart will open the gate forever.
No reason to turn away, no reason to go!

Fantasia, this is where I long to be,
Fantasia all my dreams come true with you.
Fantasia listen when I call for you,
from where I am there will be a new tomorrow...

Dream away
forever the light of your fantasy will rise,
he have been caught,
they're calling for you.
sooner or later Fantasia will rise, rising you.

Fantasia, this is where I long to be,
Fantasia all my dreams come true with you,
Fantasia listen when I call for you,
from where I am there will be a new tomorrow
