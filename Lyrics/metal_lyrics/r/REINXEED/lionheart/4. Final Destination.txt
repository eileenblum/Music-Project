[Verse]
When you're on your own, facing the world alone you can never be sure
But I do know, that you and I, will soon be one

[Bridge]
I was your knight, that was holding you tight forever
Now when the times are over, you know you can prevail

[Chorus ]
Final Destination, we have heard its call, and we will never stop the fight
I hear you calling for me

[Verse]
People dream all night, all day, and all morning, but some won't come true
Your the one I'm searching for, so where can you be

[Bridge]
Open your eyes, there is a world outside, that's hiding
Even the strongest man is weak, you know you can prevail

[Chorus ]
Final Destination, we...
