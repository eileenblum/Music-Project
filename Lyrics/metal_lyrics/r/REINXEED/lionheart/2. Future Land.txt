[Verse]
The day before the day I was born, the sun was shining up very strong.
The power within will hold out for long, all the little ones, all very small,
fight with your heart with your mercy and soul, do not never stop if you wanna reach your goal,
All the worries and miseries are holding for you a chance to be free,

[Bridge]
There is a place where everyone can hold their hands,
Just find the way to the Future Land

[Chorus]
Horror and Darkness, all we feel is fear
Sorrow and Sadness, will not disappear
I won't get blind by the sun in my eyes, goodness survive and evil dies
An armor of steel and a sword in my hand, I'm searching the way to the Future Land

[Verse]
The day after the day that i died, the moon was glowing into the night
As I was waiting for my last time to come, the sound of eternity was growing strong
The sadness in my soul was no longer there, It had just left me, just disappear
The lightning in this world was fading out and now my world is travelling south

Stick
A story can't be told if you're changing the end
Don't take your life with shame, come with me to the Future Land
