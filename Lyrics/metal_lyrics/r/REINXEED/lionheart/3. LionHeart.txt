Once in time, all from the start, I longed for the LionHeart
Now your minds has shown itselves, and I know what you're looking for
The road to your fate is beginning to fade, your destiny is not far away

[Chorus ]
I was after history, but now I am all from the start
The Gods of Valhalla where reaching out their hands for the LionHeart

[Verse]
When I look into your beautiful eyes I see the truth
Now your soul is burning up, and I know what you are searching for
By using your heart that is stronger than steel, many peoples lives you can heal

[Chorus (x2)]
I was after...
