Here comes the man, who's the hero of our time
Saving our treasures, never shouts "now it's mine!"
Swings trough the jungle, on stormy seas he sail
In search for the holy grail
See how he flies trough the mountains and the sky
Moving away from the darkness with his hat he controls his destiny
Along with his father they make history

Raiders of the last Crusade in the Temple of the Crystal Skulls
Hide the secret for one to find
He won't surrender, he'll never die!
The last one included creatures from the sky
Away from the ruins before they will fall in the Temple of the Crystal Skulls

Germany falls and their way to prevail is to
find higher power to help them, or fail
Sandstorm and evil has fallen so soon
In the valley of the crescent moon
Kneel down, and penitent man will pass
With a leap of faith you walk through the path of God
When you stand before the grail
Remember to choose wisely

Raiders of the last Crusade in the Temple of the Crystal Skulls
Hide the secret for one to find
He won't surrender, he'll never die!
The last one included creatures from the sky
Away from the ruins before they will fall in the Temple of the Crystal Skulls
