Welcome onboard in mist
THe Captain was weak. they trough him overboard
Rest of the crew made a mutery dance
They're sailin' tonight

Now set sails for stranger tides
No fear to show us
Resistance is strong when you fight, fight with your heart

Fire is burning from canons exploding when the fleet comes
To rescue a dam in distress
"Welcome onboard!"

Moonlight shows you
Who they really are, the gold in their hands brought a curse onboard
They sail for the fountain of youth
Plunder and steal to get far
Parlay means nothing on this ship!
So now set sail to stranger tides

Into the locker of Davy Jones they try to run away
From depts that has to be paid
"No one leaves this place!"
Placing fire against his heart then takes control as Captain of his
Flying Dutchmen arrives only to call in your soul
Tears from a mermaid in need for this quest
Of glory the dice will be rolled
