Follow the cold shiver running down your spine
A spider's crawling on your neck, he bites you down
The end of one thing is a start of something new
When the web is shown your powers grow

Your friendly neighborhood is safe
When he flies trough time and space
With great powers comes great responsibility, remember...

"We're flying we're diving, we're not afraid of dying
We'll risk it all to save your life..."
They're flying, they're diving they're not afraid of dying
They come to save us all in time
Now they take their wings and fly
High above the sky to see, and to hear us calling

Storm rogue, a cyclops, an old wolverine
Enter into one amazing fighting team
Some have the powe to control our minds
It's their destiny, their legacy

Four green creatures living down below
With a power they can't show
Came here from far, far away
In the sewers they're fighting today

"We're flying we're diving, we're not afraid of dying
We'll risk it all to save your life..."
They're flying, they're diving they're not afraid of dying
They come to save us all in time
Now they take their wings and fly
High above the sky to see us

One man flying high and fast, a superstar
Red and Blue is shininh, green will make him fall
Forever he'll save us all

"We're flying we're diving, we're not afraid of dying
We'll risk it all to save your life..."
They're flying, they're diving they're not afraid of dying
They come to save us all in time
Now they're flying high above the sky 
They've come to save us now
Now they take their wings and fly
High above the sky to see, and to hear us calling
