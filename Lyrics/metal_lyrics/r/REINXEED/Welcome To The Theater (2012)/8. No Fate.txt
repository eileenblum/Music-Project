He came from the sky out of nowhere in time
His mission - To erase their doom
I was the one who could save us all
And they knew that before I was born

So now we'll go in the night of our judgement day
We will fight, fight to survive! Kill and slay

No fate (no fate) but what we make
Make a final stand in this war we fight tonight

Into the night, fire at will, never surrender
If you wanna live on (We'll never die...)
Stay in the light, kill or be killed,
Fire is burning and victory's near
But only today, it's our judgement day!

We have been fighting a long time,
We're out numbered by the machines
We have a strength that can never be measured
Out in the war we must go!

So now we'll go into the FIRE! A burning crusade
Win or lose, cause this war will end now tonight!

No fate (no fate) but what we make
Make a final stand in this war we fight tonight

Into the night, fire at will, never surrender
If you wanna live on (We'll bever die...)
Stay in the light, kill or be killed,
Fire is burning and victory's near
But only today, it's our judgement day!

(Oh, we knew from the star, my mother protected my life for you all)

What is it that makes us human?
It's the strength of the human heart...
Like the strength of my mother
Who tought me to win this war!

No fate (no fate) but what we make
Make a final stand in this war we fight tonight

Into the night, fire at will, never surrender
If you wanna live on (We'll bever die...)
Stay in the light, kill or be killed,
Fire is burning and victory's near
But only today, it's our judgement day!

Now run into war with power so pure,
That only a man can live for
Don't worry my friend, I'll be back!
Come with me if you wanna live!
