"Take me back, take me back, Doctor!
Take me back, take me back Back in Time!"

What's the time? I'm on my own when the rain falls down
Speeding light growns in my sight and I look ahead
My friend is gone and I wonder why, is it destiny?
I changed my way of life in the oldest of our land
When I have lived for many days, don't follow me!

Souring high, your machine can fly

Flash of light and Fire
Steaming from the tires
There's no limit in the sky

I must save my friend from the past
Go against the time, make it fast
See trough our future and history
Somewhere in Time I will find where you are

There's no returning from where I'll go now
History's changing again
"Time's not against you"
Old ancient stories revealed and changes
Here in the Western Land

I have found my one true love, I'm tired of rejects
She's one in a million, one in a googolplex
I'm sorry friend, you don't belong where murder's not a crime
We must back to -55, now it's our time!
Now you fly in my machine so high

Flash of light and Fire
Steaming from the tires
There's no limit in the sky

I must save my friend from the past
Go against the time, make it fast
See trough our future and history
Somewhere in Time I will find where you are

There's no returning from where I'll go now
History's changing again
"Time's not against you"
Old ancient stories revealed and changes
Here in the Western Land

Fly away forever, time is now or never
I believe we'll meet again

Flash of light and Fire
Steaming from the tires
There's no limit in the sky

I must save my friend from the past
Go against the time, make it fast
But where is your ocean of dreams
When you can't see your own fantasy

There's no returning from where I'll go now
History's changing again
"Time's not against you"
Old ancient stories revealed and changes
Here in the Western Land
