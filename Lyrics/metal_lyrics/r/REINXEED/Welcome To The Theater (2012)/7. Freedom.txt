Lower your flags, go back to your homes
Let them forgive you if they can for hundreds of years of
murder and theft,or else you'll die to day

You have misstaken your place in this game, kneel down before your king
For I am your ruler, from now on today you'll follow my commands

You have enslaved our people, our way of life will soon be gone
We won't cave in

Freedom, we cry for freedom
On this Stirling Bridge we fight for something no one's ever had before
They don't know a thing, they fight for a king who promised us freedom if we surrender
One thing they can not withdraw from us all our minds and our hearts

Those men who fought beside eachother
In the dawn they fought for the man with a strong belief (the strongest belief)
A belief in their freedom, something that I never had and never will

I desires peace, withdraw your attack! In return I grant you gold
Titles, estates of the finest of man listen to your king!!!

A lordship and title, where in the bible can you read of Judas live down
I'm not that kind of man
"You have bled, now bleed with me"

Freedom, we cry for freedom
It's all for nothing if you don't believe in your own freedom
You don't know a thing, you fight for a king who promised you  freedom if you surrender
One thing they can not withdraw from us all our minds and our hearts

All weak men betray, all lose heart for their own glory
God, I beg you God, give me strength
So hear now my last prayer

She was my one true love, and for my life they ended hers just to make me come to them
Vengeance, the price is blood below your feet if you don't dare to detain your noble rights
Freedom, oh Freedom, I cry for our freedom!

Never before to your king have I sworn a trustworthy alliance
We'll never die!

Freedom, we cry for freedom
Now It's all for nothing if you don't believe in your own freedom
You don't know a thing, you fight for a king who promised you  freedom if you surrender
One thing they can not withdraw from us all our minds and our hearts

I cry for freedom, that's all we'll ever have
Please God, give me strength to die well tonight
We want our freedom now

You pay with your life for a certain demise
But only if believe it, so God give me strength to die well tonight
