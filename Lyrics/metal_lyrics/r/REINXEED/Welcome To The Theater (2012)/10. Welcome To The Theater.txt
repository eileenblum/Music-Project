The great dictator singing in the rain
And th seven psycho usual suspects silence all the lambs
Mean Girls in the fight club will die hard when
The Departed Gladiator with a scarface feel the Heat

Far away you see the others on the rock
And the Time machine takes us to the abyss of the
Mystic River, where the brave heart Frankenstein might be
The shining helps us all to see

Welcome to the Theater we'll show you to your seat
Look into the screen and you will see a star wars
Against the Avatar inside the Matrix failed
When the twilight goes away

You will get an offer, don't refuse
In his chair the Godfather will shake his jaws
And cast away the Unforgiven fellowship of rings!
This is no country for old aliens with vertigo

Stay alive when you for up inside the cube
Terminate all public enemies
Walking down an green mile when the warriors become
The men in black, and that's not all that you will see!

Welcome to the Theater we'll show you to tour seat
Look into the screen and you will see a star wars
Against the Avatar inside the Matrix failed
When the twilight goes away

I'm gonna tell you my secret now...
I don't see people walk around because they're dead, no!
Gone with the wind, the ghosts are busted, haunting ends
I have a sixth sense of what's coming next so hear me out!

Once again you hear the bridge and choirs sing (choirs sing)
Going back into the future if I can
But I don't have the time, when pirates comes around
I'm gonna tell you once again!

Welcome to the Theater we'll show you to your seat
Look into the screen and you will see a star
Welcome to the Theater we'll show you to your seat
Look into the screen and you will see a star wars
Against the Avatars inside the Matrix failed
When the twilight goes away
