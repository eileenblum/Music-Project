A silent morning rising up
Children playing hide and seek
Is this the end? Do not fear for your life
Moments of magic high above
God will hear you when you pray
Horn of the angel, hear!
Victory's near in this land we fear

Dreams! We will live forever!
Far beyond on the moonlight we belong
We have seen so many fears deep inside our mind
Now eternity will rise

Pray, it's not too late, fall asleep
Dreams will take you far away
The battle of Reindhill begins!
All as one! We will never fall!
Dreams! We will live forever...
