Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known
Threatened your tradition, held sacred
Nature demystified
Black and white paradigm outmoded
Afterlife nullified

Cradled in the palm of God
Invisible essence
Silent night and empty skies
I never felt a presence

I am just a complex ape
Designed for sowing seeds
Imagination spawned the concept
Of transcendental needs

Every tribe walked this path and had a vision
Maybe God is just too big to fit in one religion
We call one truth by a thousand different names
In the end the sages all speak the same

Forge it, fake it
Never admit it
Too proud to be wrong
Temples, Churches
All seem so certain
No one really knows the truth
Cast doubt, day in and day out
Beliefs so very narrow
Black light
A stab without sight
Am I worth more than a sparrow?

Strive to be immortal, eternal
Hidden worlds to discover
If weâre just decaying carbon,
At least we've got each other

Search the scrolls
Scout the stars
Explain who we really are
Dragging depths
Unearthing stones
Wonder if weâre all alone

All alone
Alone
Alone

I donât know why weâre here; what came first, what comes next?
If we just get one chance, search the scrolls, scout the stars
I donât know why weâre here; what came first, what comes next?
A god in every heart, fragment of the Divine

The choice is fear or love
