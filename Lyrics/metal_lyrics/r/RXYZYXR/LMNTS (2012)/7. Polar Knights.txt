In a decaying society, art must reflect decay
The wells are running dry and our future's wasting away
Vapid promises spew from the leaders of every nation
They know damned well we're on the brink of annihilation

How far must we walk down this road before we see where it leads?
When did the focus shift to gluttonous wants from collective needs?
Massive civil unrest, symptom of a dying system
Transition to something that appeals to collective wisdom

Move forward
Bury the structures we revile
Move forward
Our union will signal rebirth like the full moon over the Nile

The war machine marches on, prolonging relentless matricide
We have found the cancer that needs to be excised
Accepting serfdom, the world patiently awaits a messiah
Tell everyone there's nobody coming and you become a pariah
With a planet in debt to itself we watch our system grind to a halt
The shit hits the fan, we don't change a thing, the implosion is all of our fault
We're headed to oblivion, cause we've chosen to be oblivious

Move forward
Bury the structures we revile
Move forward
Our union will signal rebirth like the full moon over the Nile

Your loss is their gain

We give to the rich and rob from the poor
There's always an excuse to profit from war
Hard to imagine no possessions when you're sitting in a mansion,
The suits were banking on the stocks to once again rise
We're seeing the world economy collapse before our eyes
We gave you the tired poor huddled masses yearning to breathe free
And now that's all that's left of our society
The stage is set for extinction
Don't let them tell you your vote counts

You have to scream for your voice to be heard
You have to scream for your voice to be heard

Move forward
Bury the structures we revile
Move forward
Our union will signal rebirth like the full moon over the Nile
