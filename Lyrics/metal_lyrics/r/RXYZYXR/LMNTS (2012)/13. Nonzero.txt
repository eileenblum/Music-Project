Soft incandescent glow soothes soft-minded slaves,
Still chained, yet never thought of questioning
Their myopic rose-tinted lens for ancient fairy tales
Drop all the nonsense, child, for now's the time to evolve

Stare into the sun
Cross the divided line
Cling tight to the truth
Illuminate your mind

Lifeless bodies wash up on the coast
Done gasping for breaths not meant to be
Homes underwater giving up the ghost
No mercy as far as the eye can see
This is the dark night of the world's soul, don't expect absolution
Rolling deeper down a blackened hole, resisting evolution
After a decade profiteering from war raped all the land, and they still want more

Stare into the sun
Cross the divided line

No ammunition, no enmity, emerge as one human entity
New great commission, renewed clarity, renounce the illusion of scarcity
Abandon opinion, erase division, cauterize wounds that bleed the earth dry
Natural selection, starving regression, sever the limbs that constrict those who fly

Underground, where we've all been gagged and bound
Underground, ignorance resounds
Underground, I'm not coming back around
Underground; once lost, but now found

Abandon opinion, erase division, cauterize wounds that bleed the earth dry
Natural selection, starving regression, sever the limbs that constrict those who fly

Transcend the creeds
Unlock the chains
Abolish the law
Baptize in light
