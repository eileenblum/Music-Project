Adjust to corruption
Spiraling through silicon skies
Consecrate destruction
Drowning in an ashen sea

Technologically I'm obsolescent
Automatons dominate the present
Compassion could never compete
Against the arsenal of the elite

Face to face with listless eyes,
Soulless men, machine hearts, machine minds
Obsession with wealth so despotic
Laissez-faire artifice of the robotic

Tell us to stay in the mineshaft,
The canary is already dead
Tell us to stay in the mineshaft,
The canary is already dead
But the lesser of two evils is still evil,
And my enemy's enemy is not my...

The modern slaves scourged to produce our pharaoh's cybernetic pyramids
We are martyrs to self-proclaimed gods, a neo-animal sacrifice
Let children starve like dogs in the streets,
But it all goes back in the box,
It all goes back in the box

Tell us to stay in the mineshaft,
The canary is already dead
Tell us to stay in the mineshaft
The canary is already dead
But the lesser of two evils is still evil,
And my enemy's enemy is not my friend

Liars!
Goodbye!
My enemy's enemy is not my friend!

We remain inhumane
