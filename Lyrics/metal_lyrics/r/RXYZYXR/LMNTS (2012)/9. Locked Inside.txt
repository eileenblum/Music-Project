Concealing what we're ashamed of
Sweeping all under the rug
Basket left outside the door
Abandoned here forevermore

Locked inside padded walls
Waiting for parents to return
Won't feel the breeze upon their skin
A child's suffering is not your concern

From a distance, a darker era' s vestiges remain
Alone in the cradle, with no one to ease the pain
You said those days were over when you joined the union,
But the secret is out now, no more hiding your institutions

The blind will freeze in their tracks, unsafe without a hand
Others will lay for years in their crib and never even stand
The muscles and mind will atrophy, a widespread sickening apathy
Willfully as deaf, dumb, and blind as the little ones we watch over
No one will speak for those who can't speak for themselves

From a distance, the residue of a troubled past
Society has moved on, but still you let the abuses last
You said those days were over when you joined the union,
But your secret is out now, no more hiding your institutions

Lacking oversight
Hiding the failure of a nation
Contributing to new disabilities
And needless amputations

You are the guardians
Disposed of by their mothers and fathers
You are the guardians,
But you barely even bother

You are the guardians
Forgotten by their mothers and fathers
You are the guardians,
But you barely even bother

You take your frustrations out on a boy that can't defend himself
You force yourself on a little girl who can't speak a word
Complicit in the death of the resource that we're supposed to cherish
What does it say about a people who let their children perish?

Echoes of a cry that will never be attended to
Resonate in the chamber at the end of these darkened halls
When you turn a blind eye to the agony of the innocent
It should come as no surprise when your society falls
