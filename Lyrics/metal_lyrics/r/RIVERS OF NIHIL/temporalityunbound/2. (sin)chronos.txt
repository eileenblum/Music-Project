Deep between subsequent space and time
Where I exist, where I've always been
I am god, I am man, I am nothing
Shifting between the focus of reality

I see through time, experience all at once
And without measure
Unbound temporal senses
I must seek to change man's finality

Nuclear demise, slowest of all deaths
Rampant, starvation plagues the world

-Society Crashes in on itself-

Amidst the violence and injustice
No one shall survive
No force can balance the weight,
Of every human mind

Embedded into the eternal cosmos
Life subject to the judgment of infernal god

Amidst the violence and injustice
No one shall survive
Repetition of sins flow in perfect time
Irreverent time, imperfect lines

Your human mind, catatonic
Will play host to Armageddon

Present the superfluous choice
To create destroy, or maintain and falter
Bring forth the very end of all
An act of mercy disguised as death

You cannot perceive all the things I see
Infinite occurrence repeat instantaneously
I am god. I am man, I am nothing
Shifting between the focus of reality

I see through time, experience all at once
And without measure
Unbound temporal senses, I must seek to find my finality
I experience without measure
