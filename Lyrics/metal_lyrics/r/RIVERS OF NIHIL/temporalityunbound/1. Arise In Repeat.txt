Unsteadily awaken to Arise in repeat
That far long scent triggers memories all too sweet
Inhale to a portion, A portion of his past,
Now puzzled on how long he can make this memory last

Losing all that feeling he once felt,
Slipping out of this emotional state
If his mind had hands of its own
He would have sustained that thought long ago

The conscious seed of light,
Adjusting to his impairment
Pursuing the everlasting feeling of enlightenment
Bring forth the lost mentality
Most men spend their entire lives searching for the moment of clarity

Oh the rush and how it feels so fine
Like nova cane injected into my spine
Seeing everything that he once cared about
But it all means nothing now

Omissions from the centric flow
His senses reveal what no one knows
All memories retrieved arise in repeat

Detachment from these humane elements

Omissions from the centric flow
His senses reveal what no one knows
All memories retrieved arise in repeat

Descending backwards into that state of mind

Stray awayâ¦
