Negative space envelopes me, I have found purpose in the undoing- of purpose in and of itself. Nothing truly drowns in a sea of emptiness. Can you see it? Cosmic inversion. Behold; all is one and it too shall be nothing.
Cataclysmic, this incursion. Weâll find salvation in death, the one true emptiness.
Revert to one, the natural sun â preceding stars and the bedlam of existence
The careful equations- keeping, bodies in rotation unwind, unhinge.
The cure for excessive matter- moving through a vacuum
Destiny will be unwritten, all frivolous life, undone through my bitterness
Behold: all that is left of creation, a monochrome of eternity- in the breadth of a single atom.
It too shall be extinguished, and I with it.
Finally free of this temporal stasis.
What is perceived as time fails
I float through hallways without structure. What is perceived as time fails. I am one with the intangible.
In chaos we have found form, in essence; all has been unified.
We are slaves to the stillness
Shed this - diminutive form. In this instance I am at peace, shape and form no longer matter.
At one with the voidâ¦
At one with the voidâ¦
In this epoch of emptinessâ¦
