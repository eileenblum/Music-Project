An intersection of perspectives
Stretching like the ocean's tide.
We've been lost at sea for far too long now,
We are losing all placements within our abyss of time.

Raise the anchor to set the sail.
Optimism waits for all whom can bare.

The ocean speaks; in the distance I hear its voice.
Crying "steer the helm; proceed to follow its course, rise above, resisting all force."

Reassure this mental deficit, proceed further from existence,
Swallow these empty shore sides whole / as we ride a recurring current.

As our voyage turns the ores, we'll drift off into the sea,
No sense of direction, No compass to lead.
A stirring of notions exists within my ocean.
I fail to perceive all feelings plundering forth.

These eyes rotate backwards into my skull, I stare at quoted questions written in bold
Oh conceptions, thrusting full of deception, x3 how you fit it all perfectly into my brain......

Raise the anchor to set the sail.
Optimism waits for all whom can bare.

Submerged between ocean and air
Confronted by the age of despair

Reassure this mental deficit, as we proceed to further / from our existence,
Only to swallow these empty shore sides whole / as we ride a recurring current.

From the furthest my vision can see
An over whelming confusion is consuming me.

I've abandoned my skin
My wounds are open as the salt is welcomed in.

Reassure this mental deficit, as we proceed to further / from our existence,
Only to swallow these empty shore sides whole / as we ride a recurring current.

The ocean speaks; in the distance I hear its voice.
Crying "steer the helm proceed to follow it's course, Rise above, resisting all force."

This tidal wave with an impact of cement force will seal graves at the ocean's floor.
