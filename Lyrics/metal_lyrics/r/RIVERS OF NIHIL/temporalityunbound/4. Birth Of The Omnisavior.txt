I awaken with, no memory of life
Though I feel the omniscient is inside me
Course through my veins, abduct my brain.
In this catatonic state I am enlightened
Plain white, Sterility surrounds me
Wooden Visage of the lord observes my being
Tubes and wires force me to be, force me to see.
The universe, inside these four walls
All of existence, trapped within my skull
Is this really life? All is pain
Infinite knowledge, driving me insane
No speech no, sound
Just thoughts and sights
Deconstruct the man that I used to be, tear him limb from limb.
Erase this life. I'll be born again
In this catatonic state I am enlightened
Plain white, Sterility surrounds me.
Wooden Visage of the lord observes my being
Tubes and wires force me to be, force me to see.
Speaking to me, the only voice I hear.
Caresses me with its cold and static logic
I am alone, cannot express my fear
Wooden Christ speaks and I'm force to listen
Seeping through me, the plague of godly sin
I hear clearly the tone of his acid whisper
I am not alone, I am never alone
We become one in the birth of the Omni savior
This birth negates me, I face immortality.
Deconstruct the man that I used to be, tear him limb from limb
Erase this life I'll be born again, born again, again, again.
I awaken with no memory of life
Though I feel the omniscient is inside of me
You are my veins, you are my brain.
