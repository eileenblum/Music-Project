A mask burnt into my skin, ancestral I become
Woven into dust, they're watching me

Now I need the pain, to return, to transcend and to believe.

I need the pain
It's all I am
A lesson to be learned
And be forgotten

A mask burnt into my skin, ancestral I become
Woven into dust, they're watching me

To pretend to be detached from the fabric of constant change
To deny a connection to the threads that make you whole (x2)

But hell is what you need
To achieve
And maintain peace
It's what you need

I need the pain
To feel alive
A lesson to be learned

When I shed my skin
To cherish tradition
I will claw beneath the folds
And find ash where the eyes should be

They're collecting what's left of my bones
And putting them in little jars
Adorning them with diamonds
And resting me below the sun

Ancestral I become
And woven into the dust, into the dust

A mask burnt into my skin, ancestral I become
Woven into dust, they're watching me

Now I need the pain, to return, to transcend and to be free.
