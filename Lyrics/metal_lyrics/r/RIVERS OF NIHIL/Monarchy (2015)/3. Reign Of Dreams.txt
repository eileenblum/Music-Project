Residing in complex illusion
Their burning tongues, bleeding us dry
Presiding bodies complete distractions
Colluding spines deceiving the mind

Electric wounds in the eye
They have a taste for the blind
Endless, dreaming of night

Oh to return to that plane
To touch eternity once again, I would lose my sight

Drag me below the line of light
Trillions of points connect inside

What is beyond the seam?
Collect in circles within the green
With no instruction conceive perfection
The glass in two, the rest in nine

Electric wounds in the eye
They have a taste for the blind
Endless dreaming...

Without sleeping, they can't fold my image in twain
Without dreaming, they can't say my name

Oh to return to that plane
To touch eternity once again, I would lose my sight
Drag me below the line of light
Trillions of points connect inside

Electric wounds in the eye
They have a taste for the blind
Endless dreaming...
