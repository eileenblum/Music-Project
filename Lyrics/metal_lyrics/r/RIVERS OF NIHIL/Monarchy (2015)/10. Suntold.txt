I am crease, as I am fold
I am composition thus I am suntold

I've seen it in the dawn of your mind
As a fossil, a blueprint of divine
No chariot to ride, nor a sun that marvels aside
As no creature has truly lived until it has truly died

I am crease, as I am fold
I am composition thus I am suntold

Only the sand will survive
Let the will of our grains find its own way to decide
Let the particles faint that orbit you and I

If it's death they need to truly see, then let it be
If it's love they need, then open your heart and be set free

I am crease, as I am fold
I am composition thus I am suntold

I've seen it in your eyes, like an eclipse dominating the sky
Only the sand will survive
Within the grains we will thrive
