The day the sun swallowed the sea, I felt the light draining from the core of me.
The science of constant motion had betrayed every thought of expansion.

Here my remains, vulnerable and frail limited by constant conditioning rusted and pale

Unresponsive and worn through, evolution of absolute solitude 
The breaking point of a static, lifeless dimension has become true

The restless creation mechanism grooves
The returning formation of knowledge that knew.

In well sewn silence, a symphony vibrates to honor my cells
In realms of guidance, I'll shepherd them to the oceans swell

Becoming what I once was again, Prometheus of a dry river bed.

The agents of a new world structure, form together in ageless brew.
The essence retained, a semblance of rain, ceaselessly they call my name.

The agents of a new world structure, form together in ageless brew.
The essence retained, a semblance of rain, ceaselessly called.

The day the sun swallowed the sea, I felt the light draining from the core of me.
The science of constant motion had betrayed every thought of expansion.

Here my remains, strong and renewed. 
Perpetual, in bloom.
