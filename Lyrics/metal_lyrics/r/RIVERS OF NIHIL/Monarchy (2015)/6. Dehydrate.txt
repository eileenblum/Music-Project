The sanctity of life is a lie
You merely choose to become bound
By believing that the sun will one day come down

You are dust and nothing else
You are the pile of salt you were always meant to be
The holy admonished melts away

Into the unsinking sun I gaze as I wither away
As reparation for commencing union
I give myself unto the sand and become unseen

I am dust and nothing else
I am the pile of salt my body was always meant to be
A part of the world that destroys me

Colors burst from beneath my skin
The serpent crawls from within

Spreading the ash of my remains
The gentle winds caress an otherwise empty plain

Into the undefinable space between
Life and what is beyond it seems
Perhaps a soul shall venture forth
Discovering the real amidst the lie

I am dust and nothing else
I am the pile of salt my body was always meant to be
A part of the world that destroys me
