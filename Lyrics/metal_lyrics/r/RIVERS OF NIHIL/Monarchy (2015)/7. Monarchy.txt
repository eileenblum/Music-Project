A giant stands, a shadow cast by his hand

They're taking our lives away, and dragging us from our homes, bereft of constitution, the tyrant sun
Calling back to the instinct to be controlled, clandestine convalescent, the rule is old

The violent shift in violent tones, the silent build has been exposed
Has been exposed

Calling back to the instinct to be controlled, clandestine convalescent, the rule is old
The acid reign, has taken hold
In time they'll sing, the monarchy of the sun

Created in the image, of a perfect design
My brothers and sisters! Only love will raise the tide

Rise

They're taking our lives away, and dragging us from our homes,
Bereft of its foundation, the fallen one
The acid reign, has taken hold
In time they'll sing, the monarchy of the sun
