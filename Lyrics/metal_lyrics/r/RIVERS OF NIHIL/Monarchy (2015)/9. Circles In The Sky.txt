As we march
Into the scars of the earth
Other circles feel the fear
All the tension pulls apart, magnetic waves reveal

And the traces fade
I am not corporeal

Pray to be unmade
And absorbed into the light

Everybody be as one
Suffering only in the mind
Coalesce into the none

If you worshiped only the real
Would you change how you feel?
Do you believe you're truly at one?
Or would you bargain for another day beneath the sun?
Do you regret?
Do you feel?
Do you own what you've done?

And I saw those circles shrinking
Missing the fear that once drove them
To separate us from what we are

And the traces fade
We are not corporeal

Pray to be remade
And absorbed into the light

Everybody be as one
Suffering only in the mind
Coalesce into the none
