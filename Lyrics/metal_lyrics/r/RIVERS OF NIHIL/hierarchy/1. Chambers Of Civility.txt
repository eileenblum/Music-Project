We have become addicted to nothing.
System Interface.
With thy organic mind. altruistic living is a waste of time.
Materialism dominates our kind.
We are slaves in the new world, just part of a design.
Just consumers. Not immune to the snakes that will sell our souls.
To machines, We belong.
Eat the shit they give us because we can't live without it.
We are so numb because wanted it this way.
We are so numb because we like it like this.
Elective euthanasia societal anesthesia
Sew my eyes shut, I won't watch this anymore,
Sew my mouth shut, I won't eat this shit you give to me.
Living in civil chambers we have separatist behaviors.
Cultivating an unchanging landscape.
Meaningless distractions.
Concoction made to make us numb.
Side effects include disillusion.
Paranoia and lack of trust.
Mechanical walls built to hold us in.
Invisible lines are drawn.
Sew my eyes shut.
Refusing to be subjective to such diluted imagery.
The pure soul of immunity, Resisting through the chambers of civility.
Elective euthanasia societal anesthesia
Sew my eyes shut, I won't watch this anymore,
Sew my mouth shut, I won't eat this shit // you give to me.
