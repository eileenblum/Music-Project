[Music: Uttley, Biggs; Lyrics: Biggs, Dieffenbach]

Information/continuum drift.
I am the product of continual stasis.
Preservation of sacred light.
Reach for the ultimate sight.

The reign of knowledge long in a spectrum of mind.
Compounding corners fold into metaphysical time.
The potential of every living thing documented ethereally.

I return my psyche to the origin of self,
Through this plane of space and time.

Mortal coil encased in night, perpetual insight.
Every detail placed into design.
Configuration of human kind.

I return my psyche to the origin of self,
Through this plane of space and time.

Innermost reaction / exploring outer tides.
Innermost reaction / the conscious seed of light.
We reach within our minds.

I return my psyche to the origin of self,
Through this plane of space and time.
The conscious seed of light!
