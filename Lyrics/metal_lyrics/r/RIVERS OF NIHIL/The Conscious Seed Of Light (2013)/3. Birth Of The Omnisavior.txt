[Music: Uttley, Kunz, Biggs; Lyrics: Biggs]

I awaken with no memory of life.
Though I feel the omniscient is inside me.
Course through my veins, abduct my brain.

In this catatonic state I am enlightened.
Plain white, sterility surrounds me.
Wooden visage of the Lord observes my being.
Tubes and wires force me to be, force me to see.

The Universe, inside these four walls.
All of existence, trapped within my skull.
Is this really life? All is pain.
Infinite knowledge, driving me insane.

No speech, no sound, just thoughts and sights.
Deconstruct the man that I used to be, tear him limb from limb.
Erase this life, I'll be born again.

In this catatonic state I am enlightened.
Plain white sterility surrounds me.
Wooden visage of the Lord observes my being.
Tubes and wires force me to be, force me to see.

Speaking to me, the only voice I hear.
Caresses me with its cold and static logic.
I am alone, cannot express my fear.
Wooden Christ speaks and I'm forced to listen.

Seeping through me, the plague of Godly sin.
I hear clearly the tone of his acid whisper.
I am not alone, I am never alone.
We become one in the birth of the Omnisavior.
This birth negates me, I face immortality.

Deconstruct the man that I used to be, tear him limb from limb.
Erase this life I'll be born again, born again, again, again.

I awaken with no memory of life.
Though I feel the omniscient is inside of me.
You are my veins, you are my brain.
