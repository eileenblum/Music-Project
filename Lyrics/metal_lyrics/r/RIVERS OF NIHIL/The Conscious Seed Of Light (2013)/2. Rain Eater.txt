[Music: Uttley, Kunz, Biggs; Lyrics: Biggs]

Time has come, I know the walls around me, I've covered every inch.
I know they're calling to me. I'm bleeding minutes, seconds, days into this place.
But time moves so slow, I work finger bone.
The flesh no longer part of me: I must emerge.

I am the son of centuries of self-serving, sickening scum.
I can dig, and I can crawl away from this place of iron and stone.
I can just walk away, and I'll be free to go...
Heed the calling rain, to a place that I can call home

Bury me so I might grow.
Feed me rain, and leave me alone.
Bury me, and leave me alone.
Feed me rain so I might grow.

Knowledge through growth,
My veins grow out into the Gaian essence which feeds all life.
Grow into the essence which feeds all life.
Isolation, paralysis: the state in which I spend eternity interned. Eternity flows.
Time moves slowly, work to emerge, fulfill my purpose within the natural world.
Within this temple of dirt.
But time is no more, where this seed is sewn.
The flesh no longer part of me: I am alive.

I'm the sum of a million years of life, light and love.
Reaching once-dead arms to the all-giving sun above.
Men of flesh and blood would call this gift a curse.
But they don't know my pain, I would gladly serve this time a million-fold.

Bury me so I might grow.
Feed me rain, and leave me alone.
Bury me, and leave me alone.
Feed me rain so I might grow.
