[Music: Kunz; Lyrics: Dieffenbach]

Pulsating template encrypted by the earth.
Journey inward through the outer planes of consciousness.
As imagination orchestrates to disburse.
Kundalini, sleeping serpent,
A confluence of energies coiled within the four leaf lotus.

Youniverse within me.
Soil &amp; Seed radiate energy.
Given form to infinite divinity.

As her consciousness syncs with mine,
The pendulum swings releasing me of my serpent swine.

Internal winds, replenish the intuitive mind,
Collectively all with one in this breath of life.

As her consciousness syncs with mine,
The pendulum swings releasing me of my serpent swine.

Chant the sound of seed.
Harvest the soil of skin.
Reserve inner truth blossoming within.
Piercing cry through bushes and stones,
Restore our Mystic Mother's earthly home.
Built out of branches and bones, branches and bones.

A calling to rejoice us from which we've grown.
I can faintly hear her passive voice, as I stare into the wisp.
Beyond all reasonable choice.
She speaks from the extension which I've grown,
As these vine structure our flesh and bones.

Tribal mind, muladhara vibrates and chimes; Defusing.
Hues of red my cosmic roots have now aligned.
Constellation of my primitive design integrated at the base of my spine.
Treasure of this holistic glow, vibrant colors honor its cosmic home.

Youniverse within me.
Soil &amp; Seed radiate energy.
Given form to infinite divinity.

As her consciousness syncs with mine,
The pendulum swings releasing me of my serpent swine.
Internal winds replenish the intuitive mind collectively all with one.
