[Music: Kunz; Lyrics: Dieffenbach]

Alternating Personality!

Disguising all that is natural
While losing yourself under all that owns you.
A glitch for those that fear reality.

The influential impact of centuries to come
Weighting out human instinct while sculpting character.

Becoming what these products shape you to.
Stuck living a life that doesn't hold real value.

Traded individuality to mimic some trend.
If we were to die and be reborn, we'd do it again.
Disgraceful human race!

One day unfamiliar will hold the look of all these faces.
An unrecognizable fool.

Narrowing down the path evolution takes us.
Are we clones programed to make these mistakes?
Our path of fate holds no originality.
Following and falling countless steps behind the lead.

Traded individuality to mimic some trend.
If we were to die and be reborn, we'd do it again.
