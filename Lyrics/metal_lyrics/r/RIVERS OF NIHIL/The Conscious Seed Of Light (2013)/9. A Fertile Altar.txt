[Music: Kunz; Lyrics: Biggs]

The dread of night manifests in me,
I am the teeth in the mouth of eternity.
Driven by a cyclical will:
The Order demands that blood must spill.

Upon my altar, the flesh is mass-produced.
One singular obsession: Disfigurement of youth.
Pray to the terror of my name.

For I am God in the eyes of your family,
They have surrendered your flesh unto me.

My copious offspring: Salvation to the world.
The vibrance of a vessel filled with the seed.
The seed of a prophet, celestial bound.

Lay your body before your Lord and King,
Hallowed is the nature of my blasphemy.
A cold slab blessed by God Himself,
An altar of fruitful creation.
Built by your father's hands!

The decaying rites of our fathers,
Spring forth into a new world age.
Inside I know I am the chief of all sinners.

Upon my altar, the flesh is mass-produced.
One singular obsession: Disfigurement of youth.
Pray to the terror of my name,
And pray to the truth!
