[Music: Uttley; Lyrics: Dieffenbach, Biggs]

Behold her earthly optimization; communication with life.
Entering the sea of immaterial vines.
Unraveling to be an entity of one in the essence of all.

The place of serpents; a gateway to eternal mind.
The gift of nothing; baring sight into the one eye.

He who breaches beyond her underline.
Drinks the sacred nectar of the ayahuasca vine.
Her digital persistence brewed without remose.
No resistance.
Her intelligence, consuming me, diluting me.

The place of serpents; a gateway to eternal mind.
The gift of nothing; baring sight into the one eye.

Growing through the pain of rebirth in the serpent plane.
And she is not the same, one and all combine within her frame.

As she reads my mind, decoding fragments of human kind.
Leaving physical binds, curious venom is left behind.

She who breaches beyond the timid void of man.
Releases her merciless intelligence.

The place of serpents; a gateway to eternal mind.
The gift of nothing; baring sight into the one eye.
