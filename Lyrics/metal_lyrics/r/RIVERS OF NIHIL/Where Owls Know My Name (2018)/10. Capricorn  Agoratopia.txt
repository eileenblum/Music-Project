Fear, fear drowns the mind
In my kingdom, in my refuge
Within this empty room
Where I can speak to you

A last breath for the earthly
In empty space
Distant voices chant softly
It's beginning to look like a pale facade
Another cry for existence
Stands to be ignored
But it's a pale facade

It's a pale facade
Hands stretching toward the last day beneath the sun
Reaching paradox
In time we will unmake ourselves
It's a pale facade
Secure in your right to remain
Breathing the air you did not earn
Like ants coveting

Strong sense of dependence
No will of its own
Walk for centuries to realize all that's left is a fading image
Words like fleeting omniscience
Cloaked in subtle pain
No answer for those needing relief from existence

Oh the sight!
Oh can it be?
I've longed to see that which truly

Owns the light
A calming wave of incandescent grace

Spreads its rot

It's a pale facade
Hands stretching toward the last day beneath the sun
Reaching paradox/in time we will unmake ourselves
It's a pale facade
Secure in your right to remain
Breathing the air you did not earn

When the sun doesn't rise
And the hope of light fades
Rest these eyes a while
I'll see your face
