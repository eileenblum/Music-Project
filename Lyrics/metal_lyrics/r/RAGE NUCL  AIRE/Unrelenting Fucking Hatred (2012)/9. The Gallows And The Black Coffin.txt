Suspendatur per collum
Turn Death's darkest shades:
all the colours of asphyxia;
Thou art hanged, but thy Seed is quick

0 Gallowsborn, unsoiled by light,
[2x] bring the plague;
Bring corpselights from the Carcasscape,
[2x] bring the plague;
Up from plague pits yawning wide,
upon which a crossmoon shines,
bring them that grim Death designs,
whose sex appeal can't be denied

The twisted dead that have stained the soil
[2x] bring the plague;
Bring the Grave to all who have eyes to see,
[2x] bring the plague;
Worms come after hands like spiders
[2x] that bring the plague
To this place of putrescences,
[2x] bring the plague

As the Gadarene swine leapt for thee,
let their offspring roam the streets,
while Mother Proctor trades in seats
with a better view of the Triple Tree
of Ty burn

Bring black coffins filled with rats,
bring the plague;
From the gallows, through the corpse-gate
bring the plague;
Bring Shadows to these ancient walls,
bring the plague;
Let nothing stop thee, let no one stop thee,
bring the plague

For behind smiles to despise
lurks a traded in the eyes

This is blasphemy made flesh,
with eyes as warm as a deathbed fuck
