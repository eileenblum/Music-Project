Your right to live
does not supersede
my need to KILL you

"What whore shat you into the world?"
There is no "murder", here:
this shit was never born
You haven't lived
and I can't un-KILL you;
you have no names I can recall

Everything is cold, finished... ruined
Every day is a funeral
There is no remorse
Do not repeat - We will repeat

debris, you are...
mud-dwellers all:
you live
where you don't belong

Let your HATE be more lasting than the grave:
This is not "good bye,"
this is "see you on the Other Side"
you have useless-eaters' eyes
and mouths only open to bite or lie;
How fucking dare you breath?
You feed my unrelenting fucking hatred
You! Eat my UNRELENTING FUCKING HATRED!
