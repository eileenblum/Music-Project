In the charnel land of the Damned,
in a child's Garden of graves,
Insanity has planted
fields of the Crucified;
their heads point to the parched Earth
under vermillion skies

On each side of a blasted path,
as far as the Eye can see:
row upon row of crosses;
miasmic ill enshrouds
Perdition's umber implements
beneath black roiling clouds

To while away Eternity,
the godless lost bewail
their inverted Damnation
amid the vacant graves

Their demented cacophony
delights the Fallen Child,
who sowed Temptation's seeds
to watch his Nurslings writhe

This is the dawn of Nothingness (to be embraced):
the Dust, the dark, the gathering mass
...and the scraping tread of the dead on the Earth...
