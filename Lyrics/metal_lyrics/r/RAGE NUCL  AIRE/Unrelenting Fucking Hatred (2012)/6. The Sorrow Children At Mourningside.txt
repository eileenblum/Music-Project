(we are ashes...)

Leave us in our Silent Mansions,
in this place of sunlight and roses,
for nothing dies here, not anymore;
the Aktions are done, and we are dust

To the mad laughter of machineguns,
we descended into such along graves;
we subhumans, we bleed in darkness
that the light be not offended

We were here...
These are their houses, now,
and we are here

We were here...
This is Mourningside,
and we are here

We were here,
in this House of Tears...
now we are here

we were here:
this is where they wept;
now we are here

We caught fire
and burned so easily;
we blackened,
and then we were ash (we are ashes)
We rose to faces,
eyeless faces
that bleed black Grief
in endless oceans of Black Suffering

Now we are here,
like rat bones on a plague ship,
in thy Garden
where there are only Others...
