Utter hatred,
an old-time hatred:
of this hatred
we are kin,
because some people are only good for bullets

Let's talk about your future:
simply stated, you don't have one;
let it all end without sweetness,
without the thoughtfulness of suicide

It's time to remove you from the world:
30 seconds in the killhouse aught to do (it);
(your) nudity offends me - blood is better,
complete with holes from an MG42

The trick is in the brutality:
it's all in how hard you play,
(but) I'm looking forward to a quiet hanging
at the end of a long, long day,
and then falling asleep
to the soft drip of a slit throat

The angel of conscience
has been displaced
by butchery's muse,
who is fairest of face...
Don't you wish I were sorry?
I love how your eyes abhor me

Let us indulge the Art of Wrath,
(let us) obey the Laws of Excess...
