In these, the Last Days
before Armageddon,
comes the mighty nightstorm, (and)
the Mist brings the Chosen

Black against blue,
the Raven has flown;
Darkness, now,
as the world closes

(now) there be fewer dogs,
with each swing of the Axe;
all Aktion is prayer:
pray with the Axe

And the Chosen?
Feed them to the Young Lions;
in this Hellscape,
Violence is golden

KILL on Command,
KILL with Hearts so cold,
KILL because you can:
Violence is Golden
