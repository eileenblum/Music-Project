The song of metal striking bone
And the smoke of a  thousand burning men:
In this theater of cruelty, 
Blood and fire hold dominion over all
Passive aggression is not enough
(and) silence is never a recourse;
It falls to us to purge the land

Poinium Cherem
They are empty lives that profit not
from the right to control plutonium's destructive power
for destruction is good for the soul
We offer one and all the blessing 
of Annihiliation; on or off the battlefield

let true obliteration rise
Shall we strive to kill them all?
Of course we fucking must
Reduce them all to original ash
Back to elemental dust;
from the west, rain immediate
and intense white fire;
7.1 billion dead: the human race, entire
Shadows of humanity: pathetic carbon things

Wind of death from far up North,
Spread your lovely blackened wings
ever since the advent of the atomic age
our hate-filled hearts have needed 
to vent their fucking nuclear rage
Now, here there be dragons:
Kill
Hate
War
Violence
On the other hand, what we could use now
is a Sino-American Chainsaw War
