"My urine is divine", I think she said
but the words came out awash in blood
Let mine eyes be thine, Impieta
In this age of desire, before I decay

Black stone window into heaven
Answer me, answer me:
What is kinship Of fertility 
With sacrosanct filth and disease? 
Sic transit gloria sanguis

From the mouth of she, whose love is a plague
flow red-black commandments 
Calling for new purity... Let us pray
Let righteous serpents cavort within
The woman that is the altar and set the blood
that filth of life, to rotting in her veins

She laid her hand on the shroud and she left blood
And it was dust, as it has been for a thousand years
Now we wait for the stars to die in the company of flies
