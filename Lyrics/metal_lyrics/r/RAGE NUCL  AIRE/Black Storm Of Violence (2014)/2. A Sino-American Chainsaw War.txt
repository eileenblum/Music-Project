In a field littered with people
Amongst which corpses grow
were enacted feats of war
As man was born to be killed 
"Your screaming is music: sing to me
Sing your pain with funeral shrieks"

Kill the face No Identity
Kill the heart rip them all apart
Kill the soul
In humanicide 
Kill, don't stop
Ripsaw carnage art
Heads, torsos and limbs everywhere

This is war, this is not a crime
make them bleed:
Wash the ground with blood;
make them dead:
We're running out of time

Mech-angels dancing in a whirlwind of gore
Make convincing arguments 
and a truly cleansing war

Turmoil in the east? Violence is the answer;
Removed from History: Violence is the answer
Unrest in the west? Violence is the answer;
Aggression, suppression: Violence is the answer
To all life's ills, Violence is the answer
You deserve to die - Violence is the answer
What's the question? Violence is the answer
No matter what the question, Violence is the answer
