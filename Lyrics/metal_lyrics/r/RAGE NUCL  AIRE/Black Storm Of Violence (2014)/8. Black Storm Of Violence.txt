Thou art not the offspring of silence
Thou are not the righteous hammer of god
Thou hast not fashioned a proper temple of war
Thy strength is not as might as a  rock from the sky

Is this what you call  your house of war,
You fucking pigs?
Get thee hence behind me,
Back to your house of submission

Doth he call all his children by their name?
Then it's good to know what words mean;
If thou woudlst be a deodand, 
we can remand thee back to thy god 
If the brown dogs says there is only one god, 
Then murder is holy name
The lessons say who the enemy is

And these are the words of the scato mondaine:
Kill the grafted snake
Kill it
Kill the evil whites
Kill them
Kill the blue eyed devils!
Kill! kill! kill! 
[From "Zebra" By Clarke Howard]

Humanity is vile in that it lets thee live
Who would save mankind with murder
to earn wings
Excommunicate and anathema 
who do not wish to be forgiven
You are what lies at the bottom of the pond, 
Hellblack infidel, how shall ye burn?
