There's something loose in the garden, 
With soul so dead and cankered heart
like his blind hammer
in this house of shadows and blood,
murder is an alternative lifestyle

This is where we cut out their livers and hearts and ate the
This well is blood and we drink of it
There are only murders in this room
One soul, one blood

They are are made for the pit
We have made many pits 
Punishment mus strike the innocent and guilty alike
The Guilty are best punished slowly

Let us conjure up a noose
Looped up according to ancient knotcraft
It's 13 steps to the gallows, 
and the grave receives you with love

There can be no peace without penalty
We are pleased, but not content
That many remain unrepentant
Kill for the killing 
The will of the will
