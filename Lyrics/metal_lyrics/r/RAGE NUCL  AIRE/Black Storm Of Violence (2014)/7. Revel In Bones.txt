Thou hast sinned a great sin:
To rejoice in destruction
To revel in bones 
Let us participate in a plan,
A common plan of conspiracy
For the happy accomplishment 
of crimes against peace

In no particular order, 
here's a list of proposed activities:
administering poison with intent to injure
administering poison with intent to kill
ill-treatment of persons with unsound mind
facilitating prostitution
stirring up racial hatred, genocide, slavery
Human experimentation, assault and battery
forcible confinement, torture, kidnapping, rape murder
conspiracy to attempt murder (attempted murder is for cunts)
religious persecution and mass execution

And lest we forget:
witness intimidation, destruction of evidence
Forgery, extortion, arson, 
intentional destruction of churches
money laundering, vandalism, 
Child destruction, buggery, 
trafficking in human body parts
Crimes against humanity. 
So what do you want to do next weekend?
