Fuck
I could never give what you wanted from me
Parental shame of the world's greatest deadbeat
Fuck up, failure, disappointment, &amp; lonely
Mother always said I made her
Sick

I am your life's greatest failure you loathe me
Parenthood is a fucking bitch

Bet you're wishing that you could go back in time
Call the doctor, tell my father agree on one
I don't want to be a mother, abort my son

Sorry that I'm such a nuisance &amp; a shit stain on your fun
Forever will I be denied
By my only God damn blood
