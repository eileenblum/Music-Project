Wake me
I must be fast asleep
I thought I heard you say that you were always there for me

Mother, can you hear this song I sing?
Every word dedicated to your apathy
Father, you were never fucking there for me
I've lived my life as a bastard child &amp; 21 years deep

How could you leave me behind?

The blanket ripped from me
As far as I'm concerned I have no fucking family

No love, no family

I am the blackest sheep [2x]

It's never enough
Shit

So cross my face from every picture
Erase my name from every paper

Welcome to my lovely dark abode
Anything I can do to make you feel at home?
Take a seat let the candles fill the house with smoke as I tell you a tale of how I'm all alone

Mother, can you hear this song I sing?
Every word dedicated to your apathy
Father, you were never fucking there for me
I've lived my life as a bastard child &amp; 21 years deep
Fuck

Fuck you mother, fuck you father, never fucking cared to bother

Fuck you both [2x]
