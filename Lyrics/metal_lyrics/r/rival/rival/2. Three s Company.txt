Back the fuck up

Cold sweats are a constant tribute to the hate in those hollow eyes
If I could breathe I'd say that I'm sorry I never gut you with that knife
Face down on the bedside praying "God please help me" he was never there but the Devil was always near me
Mother, father, saviour please, please help me
No one was ever fucking there

So I took the fucking beatings bare
Mommy please don't let him hit me again
Watch me beg for my life, if I could go back in time
I'd never put down that knife [2x]

Yeah, you'll never touch me again you motherfucking 5-0 bible thumping bigot
Go tell the youth how you fucked up my head &amp; beat my face to a pulp &amp; made me wish I was dead
But, there's no time to forget the past, all the times that I had wished my life would end, put in your wrath cause
There was always something I could do wrong

A face that's ridden with shame
No one was there for me
I know I'm partly to blame
So beat me, beat me

God, where were you?
Cause you were never fucking there for me

Where were you, God?
You were never fucking there for me

He beat my face to the floor
While you watched, clawed my skin till it tore
I guess I was just nothing to fight for
&amp; that's never changed my dear maternal whore

Three's company
Mom, dad, &amp; God
What a ghostly family
