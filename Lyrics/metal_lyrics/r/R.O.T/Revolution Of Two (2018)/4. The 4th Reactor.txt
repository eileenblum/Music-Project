You think to know everything about this story?!
But if you weren't there of what you speaking about?!
Only who aren't ash can tell
Like me, I saw that mushroom catch me!

I can not understand that so big creatures are dust
And me so small, still whole
I make way between interiors
For come back to my family!

Deformed bodies
Will breathe this air
Horrible mutations
Chaos!

Tears falling on ashes
(Tears falling on ashes)
Punished by your creations
Deafening silence,
Suffer and regret!
Suffer and regret!

Alert, danger, escape
Last words
Flames, screams, fear
Last breathe

The last error will torment you forever
The way back is blocked by a thousand corpses

Your souls burn,
Faults make you suffer
You can't sleep with
The memories of danger!

Deformed bodies
Will breathe this air
Horrible mutations
Chaos!

Tears falling on ashes
(Tears falling on ashes)
Punished by your creations
Deafening silence,
Suffer and regret
Suffer and regret

Your souls burn,
Faults make you suffer
You can't sleep with
The memories of danger!

Tears falling on ashes
(Tears falling on ashes)
Punished by your creations
Deafening silence,
Suffer and regret!
Suffer and regret!

Your souls burn faults, make you suffer
You can't sleep with, the memories of danger!
Damn insomnia, regret leave me alone,
Give me the strength to forget everyone

I do not now, what to do I'm lost,
I wander aimlessly in this city of ghost
I do not now, what to do I'm lost,
I wander aimlessly in this city of ghost
