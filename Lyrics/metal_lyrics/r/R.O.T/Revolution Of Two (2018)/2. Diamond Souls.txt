So many times in which
Darkness has tried to prevail
But we took it part of us
Now, we throw, ti at you all!

With the obstacles you have placed (placed)
We have become stronger (Stronger)
Our skin doesnât fear any blade
(Fuck you?)
Thank you all!

After every lie,
After every defeat,
After every betrayal,
The way is more clear!

Welcome to the doors
Of our eden
Keep your sou tight
Have a good journey!!!
