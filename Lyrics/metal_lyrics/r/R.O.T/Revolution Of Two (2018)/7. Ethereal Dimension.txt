Hide behind ruin
My breathless breathe,
Resound where I fallen
In which life has disappeared

For my errors, I'm exiled
From my dimension
My life has come, to an end,
And my soul, full of poison,

Hide behind ruin
My breathless breathe,
Resound where I fallen
In which life has disappeared

I'm running away
From that beast
That of soul is
Never satisfied
And among the daemons
Is the greatest,
That needs my soul to get
On the other side.

On the other side!

For my errors, I'm exiled
From my dimension
My life has come, to an end,

For my errors, I'm exiled
From my dimension
My life has come, to an end,

For my errors, I'm exiled
From my dimension
My life has come, to an endâ¦
