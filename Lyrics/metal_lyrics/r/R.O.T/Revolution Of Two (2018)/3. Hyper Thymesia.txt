Memories lacerate the heart
Blood smells of remorse
Tears stained with regrets
Scars I don't want to heal

The wind of memories
It strikes violently my face
It's accompanied by its terrible whispering
That make you crazy from inside!
That make you crazy from inside!

The wind of memories
It strikes violently my face
It's accompanied by its terrible whispering
That make you crazy from inside!
That make you crazy from inside!

Freedom denied,
Repudiation for new ways
Self-harm on my heart
Wish to come back!
Wish to come back!

Everything's going to end
Will not come back anymore

Your image disappearing
They make me coward
They lead me to betray myself
They lead me to betray myself
