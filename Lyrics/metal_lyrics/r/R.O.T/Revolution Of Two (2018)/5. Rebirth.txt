Armed by my only courage
I leave for the freedomâs crusade,
My ideals, my rights,
Are more important than everything!

The do everything for the bring me down
Thos who seemed, to be my allies
They only tried to stop me
Believing i would be fin in these chains!

This is my revolution
If you will not follow me,
I do not care, I am fed up
This is my rebirth!

They do not live
Because theâre afraid to die,
They do not fight,
Because theyâre afraid to lose

Hold you your chains
I go away!

This isâ¦
This is my revolution
If you will not follow me,
I do not care, I am fed up
This is my rebirth!

They do not live
Because theâre afraid to die,
They do not fight,
Because theyâre afraid to lose

Hold you your chains
I go away!
