Hollow bodies, treample this land.
First corrupted, then emptied of their soul.
We are ruled by evil people
who sold their soul.

Those, poor unluky
That have kept the soul
Are crushed by the crused spiers
Of this kingdom

Youâll feel like, youâre suffocating,
You will, be asked to surrender
Your heart, will seem to be stopping,
The only way will seem the surrender!

Do not be fooled
This curse is an illusion

It seem able to kill you
But in reality, let you to do it
It seem able to kill you
But in reality, let you to do it

You have the power to choose
sacrificiest the easy way.
And, choose your path
Fight the course

Currupt sovergins, empyt people
Who is behind this?
The origin of evil, What is it?!
