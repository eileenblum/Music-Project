The sound of that song,
My heart wrote for you
Resound uselessly in the
Cold land of myself

The awareness of evil,
The desire of good
That living with it
Drag my tired body on way back
â¦On way back!

My legs moves to you
And my arms stab them

My legs moves to you
And my arms stab them

We didn't choice how to born,
But we can choice how to die,
A part of me wishes to do it
In that vortex that made me weak
But will death be enough
To end this?
But will death be enough
To end this?

The blood's smell
And poison flowing in me
They have deprived me
Of every decision of every will

Death or life?
Death or life?!

I choice to die
To avoid torture
Of those memories
Of those choices

We didn't choice how to born,
But we can choice how to die,
A part of me wishes to do it
In that vortex that made me weak
But will death be enough
To end this?
But will death be enough
To end this?

The blood's smell
And poison flowing in me
They have deprived me
Of every decision of every will

A gift, but also curse,
The presentiments that dwell in me
A gift, but also curse,
The presentiments that dwell in me

They made my path distressingâ¦
They made my path distressing!

We didn't choice how to born,
But we can choice how to die,
A part of me wishes to do it
In that vortex that made me weak
But will death be enough
To end this?
But will death be enough

Back or forward?
Death or life?
Heart or mind?
I didn't choice to exist!
Back or forward?
Death or life?
Heart or mind?
I didn't choice to exist!

But I'm forced to make
Choices in every moment
But I'm forced to make
Choices in every moment
