I will be your guardian angel!
I will never, leave you
I will protect you at all costs

Tell me, what it's wrong?
Tell me, what torments you?
Don't go away from me
Because without you, I am lost
Don't go away from me
Because without you, I am lost

But now I always feel less your presence.
Something take us away.
I'm afraid to lose you

Tell me, what it's wrong?
Tell me, what torments you?
Don't go away from me
Because without you, I am lost
Don't go away from me
Because without you, I am lost

I'm burning in these flames of betrayal and contempt
That grow up inside me as if this were a disease

As if this were a disease!

Every time and everywhere
I'll always be here

And I will fight by, your side
In moments of need!

I will be your guardian angel!
I will never, leave you
I will protect you at all costs

Tell me, what it's wrong?
Tell me, what torments you?
Don't go away from me
Because without you, I am lost
Don't go away from me
Because without you, I am lost

Now, I don't feel, anything
My souls, has frozen
With the hell's fire
It got upper hand on me
With the hell's fire
It got upper hand on me!
