Give your mind over to the wicked
Can you feel your heart pounding now?
With the fire inside your eyes
I can see you're ready for the battleground
Victory finds its way in the fine lines
Interwoven with the story of our lives
Be ready for the fire
Be ready for the fight

These walls cannot contain the fire inside me
With or without you, I'll keep on fighting

Overcome by the darkness that's rising in me
I can feel the enemy approaching
I am the one you have stolen
I am the one that is bound by your lies
Be ready for the fire
Be ready for the fight

These walls cannot contain the fire inside me
With or without you, I'll keep on fighting

These walls will never
Contain the fire inside my heart
