Silence, all you sinners
Heed the words from the God who brought you out of darkness
Whose blood became the cleanser of your souls
And then I saw a great white throne
From his presence, the earth and sky fled away
The water is rising to claim our nameWe cannot live, we cannot
And this I tell you brothers
I saw the dead standing before the throne of God
Do we have the savior?
Death will find those who find no mercy
This is a call to call all those who repent
For the kingdom of God and His angels are on our side
We will not back down; we will not lose this fight
Stand your ground, for nothing can shake us, not even his lies
We will defeat hell, like Christ defeated our sin
Well done my good and faithful servant
