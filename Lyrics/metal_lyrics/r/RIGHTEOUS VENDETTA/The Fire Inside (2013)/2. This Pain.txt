Can You burn this house I've made
The walls were built with lies and deceit
I'm holding on to my faith
To take away this pain

Truth be told:
I saved you the last time
And you know that I will save you again
From the arms of the distance between us
I feel you moving farther and farther away

Why can't you say
Everything will be the same
I'm not afraid
So take away this pain
Why can't you say
Everything will be the same
I'm not afraid
So take away this pain

I feel the rising sun darken the ground
That I walk upon
It makes me hate
The ones that I blame
For all the countless times I've failed you

Truth be told:
I saved you the last time
And you know that I will save you again
From the arms of the distance between us
I feel you moving farther and farther away

Why can't you say
Everything will be the same
I'm not afraid
So take away this pain
Why can't you say
Everything will be the same
I'm not afraid
So take away this pain

'Cause everything
Is worth the life you made inside of me
Give me your hand
And we will overcome
Give me your hand
And we will overcome

Why can't you say
Everything will be the same
The same
The same

Why can't you say
Everything will be the same
I'm not afraid
So take away this pain
Why can't you say
Everything will be the same
I'm not afraid
So take away this pain

This pain
