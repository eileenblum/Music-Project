As I fell from the sky,
The rushing wind awoke the sleeper inside
My heart.

It's been a long time,
It's been a long time since I've walked this place
I've been to the edge of the world
Ohhh

How can we live,
With the silence?!
Can you feel it,
Feel it, feel it
In your hands?!

Woah! We have the power to change the world!
Woah! With our love, with our love!
Woah! We have the power to change the world!
Woah! With our love, with our love!

As I fell through the clouds,
A light came down.
I knew I could change the world,
I know we can change the world.

How can we live,
With the silence?!
Can you feel it,
Feel it, feel it
In your hands?!

Woah! We have the power to change the world!
Woah! With our love, with our love!
Woah! We have the power to change the world!
Woah! With our love, with our love!

(Woah!) Our voices will silence the end!
Because in silence there are always things to mend!
(Woah!) As I walk to the edge of the world
My heart begins, to sing again!

Woah! We have the power to change the world!
Woah! With our love, with our love!!
