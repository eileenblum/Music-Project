Whatever the price
I'll pay it
I'll do anything to see the light.

Am I the only one who sees who you are?
Am I the only one who takes it this far?
Now that the cards are down it won't take long to figure you out.
If I would have known I wouldn't be here right now.

Whatever the price
I'll pay it
I'll do anything to see the light.
I've looked for a way out, out of this for so long.
Desperation blurs the line between right and wrong.

Am I the only one who sees through the lies?
Am I the only one who cut the ties?
Now that we all found out, it won't take long to take you down.
If I would have known I wouldn't be here right now.

Whatever the price
I'll pay it.
I'll do anything to see the light.
I've looked for a way out, out of this for so long
Desperation blurs the line between right and wrong

Desperation blurs the line between right and wrong
Right and wrong
Desperation blurs the line between right and wrong

Whatever the price
I'll pay it
I'll do anything to see the light

Whatever the price
I'll pay it
I'll do anything to see the light.
I've looked for a way out, out of this for so long
Desperation blurs the line between right and wrong
Right and wrong

I've looked for a way out, out of this for so long
Desperation blurs the line between right and wrong
