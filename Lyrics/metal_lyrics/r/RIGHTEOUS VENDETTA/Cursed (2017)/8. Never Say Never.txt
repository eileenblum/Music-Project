Let the waves crash in
I've been searching forever
But I never say never
Let the waves crash in
Never again, never afraid
Come to the waves and never escape
Better late than never

Never say never
There's always tomorrow
We'll live forever
Let's take our time there
Bring me to my knees
No longer will I bleed
I will always have this fire
On the flames build my empire

Deep inside I find the fire to fight that makes me whole
I'd been searching forever but I never said never
Let the waves crash in
I'm better this way unleashed from the pain
Found in the waves beyond my escape
Better late than never

Never say never
There's always tomorrow
We'll live forever
Let's take our time there
Bring me to my knees
No longer will I bleed
I will always have this fire
On the flames build my empire

I've been waiting for forever

Never say never
There's always tomorrow
We'll live forever
Let's take our time there
Bring me to my knees
No longer will I bleed
I will always have this fire
On the flames build my empire
