We'll never make it out alive
If we're just waiting to die.
Crush the weak, and show them fate,
It's time to meet the divine.

That's their philosophy;
There's not a single person in this world
That can survive this war.
Unless we stop them.

War is killing us all.

It's time to face it, the system is failing
Call for revolution this is ours for the taking
Want my philosophy?
There's not a single person in this world
That can stop us now
It's time to change things

War is killing us all

[2x]
This is heartless
I know but I like it
Settle it with violence
Break the silence

This is hopeless
These words got you choking
And through it all
I want you to know

This is heartless
I know but I like it
And through it all
I want you to know this

I've been fighting for so long
I've forgotten who I was
I've been rotting in the sun
Killing for a cause
I'm not aware of
Innocent lives dying for the greed of another
Guilty men lying to keep the truth, undiscovered

[2x]
This is heartless
I know but I like it
Settle it with violence
Break the silence

This is hopeless
These words got you choking
And through it all
I want you to know

This is heartless
I know but I like it
Settle it with violence
Break the silence

This is hopeless
These words got you choking
And through it all
I want you to know this

War is killing us all

And through it all
I want you to know this
