I'm a psycho
Simply in denial

It's time I let the secret out the cage
You know it's taking over me
It's the reason for the wars we wage
Somebody come and save me

I'm a psycho
My mind is like a freakshow
All these viscous cycles
Remind me that I've lost control
I'm a psycho
Simply in denial
It's time to face the truth
We're all just psycho

It's time somebody put you in your place
You know delusion plays mind games
How do you think I ended up this way?
There's not a thing that can change me
Softly speaking, gently breathing, slowly changing, my mind is taken

I'm a psycho
My mind is like a freakshow
All these viscous cycles
Remind me that I've lost control
I'm a psycho
Simply in denial
It's time to face the truth
We're all just psycho

Softly speaking, gently breathing, slowly changing, my mind is taken

I'm a psycho
My mind is like a freakshow
All these viscous cycles
Remind me that I've lost control
I'm a psycho
Simply in denial
It's time to face the truth
We're all just psycho

I'm a psycho [2x]

I'm a psycho
Simply in denial

It's time to face the truth
(you know) it's time to face the truth
We're all just psycho

We're all just psycho
