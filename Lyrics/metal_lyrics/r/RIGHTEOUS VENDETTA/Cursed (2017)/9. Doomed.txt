Rip the flesh straight from the bone
Killing demons, crushing blows
Glory is killing me, glory kills turn into glory sprees
My hands tear you apart, taste my shotgun
Get a look at my chainsaw
I don't wanna hear your plea
Say hello to my BFG

Doomed forever
Never gonna wake up from this living nightmare
Doomed forever
Until we die we crush hell together
(fighting with all our hearts)
This is a fight we cannot win
But know we're gonna fight until the end

This is all or nothing, hell on earth, from the gates they're pouring
I stand as one to fight, I cannot live but they all must die
Argent fills my veins
Hear the chorus of the demons scream
In hell your corpse with rot
Waiting for that one head shot

Doomed forever
Never gonna wake up from this living nightmare
Doomed forever
Until we die we crush hell together
(fighting with all our hearts)
This is a fight we cannot win
But know we're gonna fight until the end
Doomed forever
Never gonna wake up from this living nightmare

I can feel the argent sting, rampage, haste, wounds regenerating giving me invincibility
Invincibility

[2x]
Doomed forever
Never gonna wake up from this living nightmare

Doomed forever
Until we die we crush hell together
(fighting with all our hearts)
This is a fight we cannot win
I can't stand the thought of giving in
But know we're gonna fight until the end
Doomed forever
Never gonna wake up from this living nightmare

This living nightmare

Never gonna wake up from this living nightmare
