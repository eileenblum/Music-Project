Tonight

This is no place for your eyes to wander out of line
You might see something you can't shake
It'll be stuck in your mind
But your mind can be your greatest weapon
Or your own worst enemy
It just depends how far you let it go
(call me hopeful) call me crazy

Get out get out
You'll never make it alive
Without me you cannot survive
Without me you die
Get out get out
There's only one way to end this
It's never the way I intended
Get out get out
You'll never make it alive
Without me you cannot survive
Without me you die
Get out get out
There's only one way to end this
It's never the way I intended

Tonight belongs to us
A perfect night to fall in love
When the darkness comes
It gets dangerous
Falling in love with my demons

The edge of sanity was never a safe bet
A fine line never hurt anyone
It just seems to get in my head
But my head can be my greatest weapon
Or my own worst enemy
It just depends how much they get inside
I keep my mind hidden when they get to me

Get out get out
You'll never make it alive
Without me you cannot survive
Without me you die
Get out get out
There's only one way to end this
It's never the way I intended
Get out get out
You'll never make it alive
Without me you cannot survive
Without me you die
Get out get out
There's only one way to end this
It's never the way I intended

Tonight belongs to us
A perfect night to fall in love
When the darkness comes
It gets dangerous
Falling in love with my demons

Falling in love with my demons

I keep my thought confined to every corner of consciousness
That way the demons can't get to them

Tonight belongs to us

Tonight belongs to us
A perfect night to fall in love
When the darkness comes
It gets dangerous
Falling in love with my demons

I keep my thought confined to every corner of consciousness
That way the demons can't get to them
Demons!
