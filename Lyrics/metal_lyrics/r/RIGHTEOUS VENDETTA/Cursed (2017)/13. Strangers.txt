I can't break free

Deep down I know
In your soul I still have you
You don't understand when you're all alone
You still think of how it used to be when I was always there, always there
There's just no way
I can't break free

You will always be the one
I will run to out of the darkness
You'll be the one who won't fade out
Forever in love but I know
We're strangers for now

Your face says it all
In your eyes I see your soul
You can't understand why you feel alone
It reminds you how it used to be when I was always there, always there
There's just no way
I can't break free

You will always be the one
I will run to out of the darkness
You'll be the one who won't fade out
Forever in love but I know
We're strangers for now
We're strangers just for now
We're strangers for now

[2x]
You will always be the one
I can't break free

You will always be the one
I will run to out of the darkness
You'll be the one who won't fade out
Forever in love but I know we're strangers for now
But I know we're strangers just for now
But I now we're strangers for now

I can't break free
