Have you ever seen a man
Staring into the sun?
With his hands above his head
Screaming I can never change
Dying to find some kind of meaning
It's all I want to feel right now
That kind of freedom they talk about
Cause I'm sick of the feeling
I get when I'm trapped inside my head

I couldn't feel anything in my heart
Until the sun came out
Beautifully blinded, nothing to hide inside
I can start all over now
I can never forgive you
I can't even forgive myself
I guess that's why we stay this
I can't make it to heaven alone
Meet me halfway

Have you ever seen a man
Struggling to find himself
With a cross above his bed
Waiting for a night when he can finally rest and get some sleep
He was never safe between the pews
The last place he'd think that he'd find you

I couldn't feel anything in my heart
Until the sun came out
Beautifully blinded, nothing to hide inside
I can start all over now
I can never forgive you
I can't even forgive myself
I guess that's why we stay this way
I can't make it to heaven alone
Meet me halfway

I see you in the corner of my eye
Your like a shadow but you stay with me all night
Your voice it haunts me in my sleep
I'm into you as much as your into me

I couldn't feel anything in my heart
Until the sun came out
Beautifully blinded, nothing to hide inside
I can start all over now
I can never forgive you
I can't even forgive myself
I guess that's why we stay this way
I can't make it to heaven alone
Meet me halfway
