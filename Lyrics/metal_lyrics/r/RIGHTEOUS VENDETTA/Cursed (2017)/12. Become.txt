It was never enough
(yeah, to my life)
Two lies one love into your trust
It was all I could do
(to keep the spark alive)
I'll remember your words 'til the day I die

You brought this on
Your words so strong
You know this is wrong
This war's just begun
I hate the person you've become

It was always too much
(I think I'm done)
Two lies one word and I've had enough
Now there's nothing to lose
No regret this time
I can never forget how I watched you die

You brought this on
Your words so strong
You know this is wrong
This war's just begun
I hate the person you've become

I hate... what you've... become
I hate... what you've become

You brought this on
Your words so strong
You know this is wrong

I'll remember your words 'til the day I die
I can never forget how I watched you die

You brought this on
Your words so strong
You know this is wrong
This war's just begun

I hate the person you've become

I hate the person you've become
