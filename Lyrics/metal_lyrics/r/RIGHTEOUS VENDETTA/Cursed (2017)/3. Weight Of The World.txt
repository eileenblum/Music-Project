It's hard to believe in who I am these days
The hole within me is getting too deep
I am who I am I know it's hard to believe
My words as a weapon triggered my faith in me (in me!)

Trying to breathe
But the weight of the world is crushing down on me
Looking for a sense of release
But the weight of the world
The weight of the world is crushing down on me

There's nothing I can do to keep these thoughts in my head
Don't take it personal I never mean what I say
But it's hard to keep your mouth shut when the world is at your throat
Hard to understand your point of view
When my only view is at the end of the rope (I'm at the end of my rope!)

Trying to breathe
But the weight of the world is crushing down on me
Looking for a sense of release
But the weight of the world
The weight of the world is crushing down on me

If only I could unwind, forget the world for a day
I'd be much better off than this
But it's never too late
To get where I need to go
And use the weight of the world

Trying to breathe
But the weight of the world is crushing down on me

Trying to breathe
But the weight of the world is crushing down on me
Looking for a sense of release
But the weight of the world
The weight of the world is crushing down on me
The weight of the world

The weight of the world is crushing down on me [2x]
