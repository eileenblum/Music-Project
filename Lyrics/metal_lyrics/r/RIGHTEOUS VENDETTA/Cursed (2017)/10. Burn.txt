So burn burn baby, I'm addicted to this
You can't stop me now, it's too late for it

You always told me how I wasn't enough
I never made you happy, never measured up
Every word was a lie, now there's nothing to lose
You'll never see me coming, never see me coming

I was strung out on loving you
Just one more hit 'til you're the other you
The one that keeps me running on back to you
You'll never see me running, never see me running again

Now I'm addicted to the thought of you

So burn burn baby, I'm addicted to this
You can't stop me now, it's too late for it
Now burn burn baby
Burn burn baby
Burn burn baby

I watch you burn this all to the ground
Lit a match, light it up, never made a sound
Barely holding on, barely able to breathe
You'll never see me turning, never see me turning

Through the flames I walk away from you
Turn my back to the ashes and I face the truth
The bridge crumbles and the stones falling to the ground

I'll never see you running, never see you running again
Now I'm addicted to the thought of you
So burn burn baby, I'm addicted to this
You can't stop me now, it's too late for it
Now burn burn baby
Burn burn baby

I struck the match and never looked back
Now I'm choking on the ashes of everything
Everything we used to have

So burn burn baby, I'm addicted to this
You can't stop me now, it's too late for it

Burn burn baby [4x]

Burn burn baby, I'm addicted to this
You can't stop me now, it's too late for it
Now burn burn baby
Burn burn baby
Burn burn baby

Burn burn baby [2x]
