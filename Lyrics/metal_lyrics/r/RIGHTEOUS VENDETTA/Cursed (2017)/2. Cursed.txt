I feel a blessing
I feel a curse
I feel a blessing
I feel a curse
I feel your voice circling around my head (around my head)
I think I'm cursed!

The blood on your hand
I feel you reaching in
I wanna believe there's more to you than this
Cursed!
Your word spoken
Never giving in
I want to listen but your whispers are poison

You know my tendencies
You know I'll fall
I can't get away when everywhere I turn I see your bloody hands waiting
For me to grab a hold
Get a taste of the darkness, a grasp of your world
I think I'm cursed!

The blood on your hand
I feel you reaching in
I wanna believe there's more to you than this
Cursed!
Your word spoken
Never giving in
I want to listen but your whispers are poison

I spent my whole life in your hands
I kept my promise to the bitter end

(I think I'm) cursed!
Cursed!
I think I'm cursed!

The blood on your hand
I feel you reaching in
I wanna believe there's more to you than this
Cursed!
Your word spoken
Never giving in
I want to listen but your whispers are poison

I want to listen but your whispers are poison[2x]

Your word spoken never giving in
I want to listen but your whispers are poison
