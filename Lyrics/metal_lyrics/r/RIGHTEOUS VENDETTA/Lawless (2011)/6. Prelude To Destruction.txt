Burned into your brain, of you alone standing on that day
Your blank expression testifies of your blackened heart
What did you think would happen to your life?
That is falling apart
How could you be so deceived?
He will find you and cut you off
We are running out of time
Hide your and follow me I know a place that we can go
Fear is not an option, when the fight for our lives is the fight for our souls
Why have you left us so far behind?
Give me a new hope
Your blood is on your own hands by it you will live
I have no will to push on
What victory is there without the savior?
My blood runs thin but my blood runs thinner
I have no will to push onWhy have you left us so far behind?
Give me a new hope
Your blood is on your own hands
By it you will live
This is a warning, a prelude to destruction
This is a warning
The Son will save you
