I must confess there is a pain
From the bottom of my soul
Pushing its way to the heart of the matter
It may seem to be hate
But my heart says otherwise
We havenât come this far to fall back down
The voice of reason has spoken to me
Past the whims of the fallen, the death and destruction
We must rise above the world
Stomp out the pain, become victorious
We are victorious, we are victorious
Let you mind cling to me, and your heart guard my eyes
Let your mind cling to me, let your heart guard my eyes
Take this away, far from me
Let your heart guard my eyes
Does not wisdom call, to you
O men I shout?
Listen for I will speak noble things
And the opening of my lips will reveal your righteousness
You fool; your mouth is your ruin
And your lips the snare of your soul
For you talk so proud, now watch our
God tear your kingdom down
Your mouth is your ruin, your lips the snare of your soul
You talk so proud, now watch as I tear your kingdom down
