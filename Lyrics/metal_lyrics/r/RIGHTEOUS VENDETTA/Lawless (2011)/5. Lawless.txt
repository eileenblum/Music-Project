Now feel the pain of the lawless man
Your deeds are that of the heathen
Your mouth utters the filth of the world
Your eyes are filled with lust and seduction
Your heart holds the path to destruction
The lawless one will be revealed
Whom the Lord will slay
With the breath of His mouth
We are heirs to the promise
We are heirs to the kingdom
For I am angry on account of your voice
And I shall take your hand and destroy
The evil prevalent under the sun
Our hearts mourn for the time winding down
And the dead that will never be found
Breaking our walls down, for the savior to rebuild them in the final hour
There is hell to pay for the lawless man
I hear a voice softly calling my name, it guides my action
It guides my mindFrom the fog,
 I arise a new creation
A being of grace, fulfiller of the law
For I have no power, I have no power without the law.
There is an evil that I have seen under the sun
And it is prevalent among your kindIt never sees the sun, and never knows anything
It is better off than he
