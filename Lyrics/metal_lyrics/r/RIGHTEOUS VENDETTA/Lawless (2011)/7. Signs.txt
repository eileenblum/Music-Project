Fear gripping every inch of your body
Are you awake now?
Has your mind settled on the mythical return of the King?
The coming King or has myth become reality as you stand defeated
Now claim your ear and hear the words of the wise
And apply your mind to my knowledge
So that our trust may be in the Lord
I am a walking corpse with the heart of a king and the mind of a servant
If only these signs would change the love we share
I have seen the signs of the coming of the age
Where the earth will find its end
I have seen the signs of a burning world
I have seen the signs of the end
Return unto me for the signs were there
We will reign in all the glory of the King
Who called us from the beginning of time
We will reign forever at the throne of our creator
