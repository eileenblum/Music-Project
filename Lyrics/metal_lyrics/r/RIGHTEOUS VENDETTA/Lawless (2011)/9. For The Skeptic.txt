Push your faith
Push for truth
You are all sons of God
Make room for us in your heart
In all my troubles
I find great joy in you
My faith can move the mountains, but where is my love
I am nothing
The only surrender that you have seen has corrupted your hope for glory
The only surrender you have seen has corrupted your hope
Yahweh, Yahweh you are Ego Eimi
I lay my life down at the foot of the cross
As humble as I know how to be
Take this life and make a new creation out of me
Yahweh, Yahweh you are Ego Eimi
I am dead, lost I the sin of this world
God I need you now,
You are mineGod I am dead, lost in the sin of this world
God I need you now,
You are mine (We need you now)
(You are our God)
