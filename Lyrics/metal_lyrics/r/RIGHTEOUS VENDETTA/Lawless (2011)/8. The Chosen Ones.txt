Focus you mind on the coming age of suffering
We fought the good fight
Now bring the enemy to their knees
This is the final age of suffering
We are the chosen ones
With perfect vision, comes perfect attention
The making of a dynasty
We are the making of a dynasty, speaking out to a dying world
We must face the only thing that we have
Upon ourselves the fight of the ages rests
A final task for the chosen ones of the
Fatherâs loveWe were made for this
We will speak the truth until they shut their mouths
And when the devil resists we will strike him down
We are the chosen ones
We are the chosen ones of a holy living God
With the power of the cross we will not relent
[CHORUS]
The Lake of fire awaits you satan, forever
