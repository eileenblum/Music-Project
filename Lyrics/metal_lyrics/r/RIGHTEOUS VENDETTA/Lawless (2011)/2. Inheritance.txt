There can be no cowards
When the battle awaits our souls
We must forward with the power of the one who saves
Donât think I have come to bring peaceI have not come to rest the nations
I have come to bring you a sword
You underestimate the power of the words
That I am speaking to you
You deny the power, granted unto these
Hands are clean
We have conquered the world this time
The eldest of evils, will not shake us
For we hold all power
For it was spoken that a man would redeem the nations
A humble servant, glorious with the riches of heaven
Became a man, without an ounce of guilt
Pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our inequities
Mocked before the world, died, was resurrected,
Now reigns at the right hand of the father
If only they knew, if only they could see
Our inheritance
[CHORUS]
You underestimate the power of the words that I am speaking to you
