Oh my God
Your will has become our own
Oh my God
Your time is now

I feel this world is slowly collapsing
Where can I find my rest
I feel the grasp of death embracing
When can I find my rest

[CHORUS]
Itâs been so long
When can I find my rest?
Iâll take this weary heart
And I will endure this to the end
This is The Dawning of our lives

This is the dawning of our lives
Oh God itâs been so long

[CHORUS]
