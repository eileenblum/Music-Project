We find ourselves
Pulled down from the cross
Covered red with blood
He dies for our sins
Now the battle is won
The battle is won

[CHORUS]
And this picture so carefully painted
We find ourselves
Stuck to the canvas
Unable to move
Modeling for others
The essence of life
The essence of God
The essence of doubt
Flows through us

Throw down your doubts
Cast aside your fears
Let his blood fall onto us all
[x2]

[CHORUS x2]
