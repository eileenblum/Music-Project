Cascading down this road again
Remembering every word you said
I hold your face like I do your ghost
This hollow life, I have nothing
I feel this isnât inside
Inside is where youâve hid your life
Chasing this burden
That wasnât for my life

[CHORUS:]
This pressure is way too much
Iâm losing myself
These thoughts of fire surround my heart
And comfort me
Canât you see what Iâve become?
Please Father forgive me
Lord I come before you

Can you taste it, his victory
What I was is now finished
Forcing this pain away
God come into this world
Can you taste it
His victory
What I was is now finished

WE WILL NEVER BE SHAKEN

Psalm 95
