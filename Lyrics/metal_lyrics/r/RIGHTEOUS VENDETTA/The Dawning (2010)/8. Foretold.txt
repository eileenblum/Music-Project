Where will you fall?
When God appears [x2]

Like lightning the time of the Lord
Will be sudden, unknown, and in front of the world
The second coming Foretold
Prepare our hearts; this is the end of all we know
Those who have life, shall lose their lives
Those who give life, shall receive life

Men of fear for the things that are coming to this world
Men of fear

This is not our world
Itâs not our home
I give my life to live again
Live again

And all our lives
Weâve waited for this day
The second time, the coming of Christ
And all your lives you have left and turned away
Now watch your world fall apart

Earthquakes will shake the earth
Plagues, famine, all in this world of terror
These are the days you non-believers shall fear
Yet not a hair, on your head shall perish
For your endurance you shall gain your lives
