Breath deep, into me
Tight across your heart
Like a vice around your mouth
Let yourself fall and fall into his call
It calls, it burns,
Until my heart discerns [x2]

Inside there is a Breath Beneath
Take a stand against death
The one who wants our breath
For the power within lies something much greater
Something much stronger
All power is in him
And with him we stand

[CHORUS:]
Fighting for a soul who lies within your grasp

In the spirit we find ourselves
And in our souls we find our hell

Breath in me this is deep

[Chorus x3]

I am fighting for you my God
