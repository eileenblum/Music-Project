Breaking, your heart is breaking
The pieces fall into a pit of life's mistakes
Falling, your breath is falling
Falling short of those words you should have said

[CHORUS]
Crawling, crawling from the truth
It hides inside of you
Your heart will show you the way
Toward salvation and a new day

Your days are numbered
Don't find yourself burning for a second chance

The lies have been set
Right before us
