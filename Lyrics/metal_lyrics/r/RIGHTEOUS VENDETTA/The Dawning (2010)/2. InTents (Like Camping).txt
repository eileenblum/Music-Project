How can I see?
When this body of death consumes me
Tear this flesh from my un-righteous heart
Oh God tear this flesh from my un-righteous heart

[CHORUS]

The sacrifice Iâm willing to make
For life everlasting
Just to see your face
For eternity

I give my life to you [x2]
I give my life to you
For a hope in what Iâll become

[CHORUS]
