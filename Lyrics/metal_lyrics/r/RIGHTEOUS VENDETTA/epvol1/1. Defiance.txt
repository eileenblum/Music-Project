I will spit in the face of defeat
Standing at the feet of my enemy
With fearless taste
I'm here to claim my victory

With a rope around my neck
I can feel the pressure of cheating death
I am facing the giants
Planning to silence the nations

Great is the power of violence
But greater is the power of defiance

[2x]
Come on stand up
Put your hands up
Live in defiance

Overtaken by the sound of the cadence
Can you feel it?
A million lives were there for the taking
Not one was spared history in the making

I am what the tyrants call a fire in the sky
I am a warrior
I'm not afraid to die

Great is the power of violence
But greater is the power of defiance

[4x]
Come on stand up
Put your hands up
Live in defiance

[3x]
I am the rising sun
I am the chosen one

[4x]
Come on stand up
Put your hands up
Live in defiance

I am the rising sun
I am the chosen one
