Don't let today waste away
It only comes once
The way the sun shines against your face
Is just the way she speaks

We are all waiting for
Her to smile

Because when she cries
These are the days that we stay inside
And when she screams
She lights up the sky

If only we had listened to her oceans
We would have seen a change in tides

And now there's one thing left to say
As all these days seem to waste away

I'm sorry

I wish I could let you
Breathe

Exhale, all of the poison
That we have brought to this Earth
Exhale the, poison
We have brought to this Earth

Don't let today waste away
It only comes once
The way the sun shines against your face
Is just the way she speaks

Don't let today waste away
It only comes once
The way the sun shines against your face
Is only for today.
