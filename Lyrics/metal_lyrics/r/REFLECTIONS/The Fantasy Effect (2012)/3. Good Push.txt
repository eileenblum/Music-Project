Take a step back
These surroundings are signs
Where do you think that
You can go

This is no place for you

I'm on your side
You are so much better than this
I'm on your side
We can breathe on our own ground
This world could be ours
If you would just
Listen to what I have to say

I have been down these streets
That as of now you call your home
And I promise, I promise
It wont be this way forever

Consider this a new beginning

I see, the smile behind your eyes
You cannot hide from me
Maybe, someday you'll notice
That this all happened for a reason

This all happens for what?

This all happens
This all happens
This all happens for a reason
