Just for once
If you would stray away, then you would see
These walls have two sides
The illusion that they call

Home

I do not see the point
In taking the life out of living
I dont believe Ive ever seen, anything as beautiful
As the gift of living my life free

There is a part of me
That Ive left here
This means, part of me is lost
Forever

All these days blend to one
Is this really worth remembering
All that's lost, can be found
In a place already forgotten
These obstacles
Will only hold me
For so much longer

We will not walk down a path we did not choose

The sky no longer labeled as....

The sky no longer labeled as limits

And this all seems like a dream
A memory, balanced by distance
Your mind may not believe it but

Is reality really realistic?
