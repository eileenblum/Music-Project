My eyes are frozen
Stuck dancing with shadows
Another night spent sitting with silence
Screaming my name

And once again you've left me breathless
Pondering what could have been 
These possibilities once were endless
But I'm afraid weâve come to the end

And I will never know
And itâs all because of you
Forget the sunshine
I'd rather scream with the moon

Tonight we silence
All those who have held us back
Never forget who stands behind you

Next time you reach up
You'll find nothing

To hold you up

So once again you've left me breathless
Pondering what could have been 
These possibilities once were endless
But I know this is the end

I will never know
And it's all because of you

Tonight we silence
All of those who have held us back
Never forget who stands behind you

Tonight we silence
All those who held us back
Never forget who stands behind you
