I remember when
You told me you cared
But its quite easy to see
Youre fucking worthless
So sell yourself
For everything you're worth
Sell yourself

My miscommunication
Got what I wanted
No more of your face
With my new expectations
This will never happen again

Go fucking die

Ive watched you fall too long
And not cared at all

This has been my burden for far too long

Far too long.
