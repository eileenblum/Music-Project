My world is changing to the colors of their negative
My body's weightless in your gravity filled world
So why
Wish this bliss would ever let me go

Based on my optics, I'd say it's safe to say
My line is crossed as far as
Pushing my limits
Can't you see
These streets
All appear to me as Fantasy

Things you would never believe 

On the outside
There is no hope
Broken Tides
I prefer a place where the picture is perfect

No longer is my life your object
My own breed of reality 

My lost sense of time
Brings forth another realm of thought
This conscience is for now numb so,

Close your eyes and let the world embrace you.

Isn't this what we dream for
To open your eyes

We will tear, these walls down.
