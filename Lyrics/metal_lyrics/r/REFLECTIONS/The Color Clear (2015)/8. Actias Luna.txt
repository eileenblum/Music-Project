It's all inside of your head!

We are nothing but illusions
Lost inside our own delusions
We're victims of our own seclusion

It's all inside of my head!

Almost like dÃ©jÃ  vu
All of my dreams in the hue of blue
Believing all the lies I wish were true

I know we've made choices
We wish we didn't choose
But you will always have me
Even when I don't have you

You are the sun, and I am your moon
I am your artist; you are my muse

I've been lost
Inside of dreams I see with open eyes
I've grown fond of
The bliss from this eclipse between body and mind

Hollow bodied entity
Won't you walk with me
Show me something that I've never seen
I've lost the line between reality and my dreams

Something so shallow
Can sink so low

You are the sun, and I am your moon
I am your artist; you are my muse

You will always have me...
Even when I don't have you....
