If i could die tonight
I wouldn't think twice
I would take the step
Right over the edge

Eternally I have wondered why
As all of the days go by
I'm always the one who's left behind
I'm always the one who gets left behind!

I can see you forgot about me
I'm nothing more than a memory
The ghost of half the man i used to be

We fell apart in perfect symmetry
We fell apart in perfect symmetry

Am I nothing
More than a figment of my own imagination
Never ending
Thought left circling in contemplation
A wandering soul without any destination
Am..I..Despair?

I've developed infatuations
Intertwined by hallucinations
They have become my only inspiration
I realize life's foundation
Has become manipulation
No one..really...cares!

A moment i have waited for
With such anticipation
Ill exhale my last breath
With no sense of hesitation

My aura has lost all of its illumination
If you wish to vanish
Follow my demonstration

I can show you how to disappear
I can show you how to disappear

I am nothing
More than a figment of my own imagination
Never ending
Thought left circling in contemplation
A wandering soul without any destination
I am despair

I am nothing

I am despair
