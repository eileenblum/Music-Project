I keep seeing
The same things
Over and over and over again
I will never understand,
How the lowest people always get the upper hand

And as time ticks by
I sit and wonder why..
I ever gave a fuck about anything
Watch me fall asleep
Neck deep
Hanging straight down,
Tied up
...to the fucking ceiling

My pigmentation is turning black
Now I know that I'll never be turning back
In this world..
Where hell means home
I will come up,
From the bottom
Through sticks
And stones

It's all your fault
I've become so hollow
An apparition
Of my own ghost
I wont ever
Crawl down to your level
I'd rather
Rot in limbo

Sit here,
And play this game
Let's skip the introduction
And say no names
My own..
Is my own
In rooms of thousands
I still stand alone

Why am I
The only one
With eyes as empty as the ocean
ã¤
I knew I should have known
I wish I never let you see what I've shown
I've lost
All
Hope
I was born to
Be alone
I knew I should have known
I wish I never let you see what I've shown
I've lost
All
Hope
I was born to
Be alone
