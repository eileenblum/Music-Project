How many times can we say these things?
And keep pretending that it never meant anything..
Our minds wonder, but I always knew
When I close my eyes,
All I see
Is
You.

What hurts the most
Is having to know
Words and scars are all I have to show
I put together these letters with pen and paper
Only to write,
Songs
Of how
We were so close

Wherever I go,
I don't want to go.
Without you
Without you

How can you say
You have nothing to say?
How can you be
At a loss for words?
We fit together like puzzle parts
Nothing in this world
Could tear us apart

How many times can we say these things?
And keep pretending that it never meant anything.
Our minds wonder, but I always knew
When I close my eyes,
All I see
Is
You.

Wherever I go,
I don't want to go.
Without you
Without you

A feeling I can't help but chase
It seems somehow I've lost my place
I was gone
Too long
Now I've been erased
Not even I
Recognize my face
Not even I
Recognize my face.

All these places are never the same.
I can't believe I've grown so deranged
You haunt me anyway I run,
I'll never change
Into what you've become

Wherever I go,
I don't want to go.
Without you
