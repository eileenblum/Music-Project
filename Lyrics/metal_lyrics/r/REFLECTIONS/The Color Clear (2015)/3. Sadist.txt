I never knew
You were more than a voice that made its home inside my head
Now I'm carving scars into my arms
To remember what it feels like to feel anything.

That was only the start
My addiction to tearing myself apart
I'm in love with hating myself
Its the only real thing I've ever felt

I hold a gun to the head of God
Please tell me where i went wrong
Every single step I take
Leads me right back to the same mistakes
I've been here before
But i adore the pain keep coming back for more.

I bleed just to see
If there's anything left inside of me
We are a perfect fit
A sadist and a masochist

I've never been good enough

I am never good enough.
