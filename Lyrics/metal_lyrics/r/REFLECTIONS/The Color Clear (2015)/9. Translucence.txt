Slave to insomnia
Dreamless and sleepless
Counting the stars
Just to watch them fall
Prisoner of phobia
Afraid of my shadow
I never know
Who I'll be tomorrow

I still remember the way
You used to say my name
As if I were your own
As if this ever meant
Anything at all

I'd give anything to go back to that moment
Even if only for a moment

How can I forget
The only things that I want to remember
This is an endless endeavor
This is pretending we never said forever

You looked into my eyes
And promised we would die together

I'd give anything to go back to that moment
Even if only for a moment

It was always my greatest fear
Everyone I love would disappear

Just like the color clear...
