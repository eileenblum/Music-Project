pseudo smiles, and empty eyes..
I think I've been hypnotized
shallow hearts and narrow minds
can't you see?
you're blind

your eyes are like kaleidoscopes..

I've been sleeping with my hands around my throat
please show me a way,
to see through
the smoke..
I'm falling into patterns I thought
I broke

and I wish you would whisper my name through the wind
one more time..

I
miss
hearing
the sound

one thought that will never fade,
is how we promised we would never change

I wish I could forget,
but these scars are here to stay
and the memories in my head,
I know won't ever go away

I've been here..
a thousand times before
I stand near..
the edge, with hope to fall
I've been here..
a thousand times before
I stand near..
the edge
with hope to fall

your eyes are like kaleidoscopes

your eyes are like kaleidoscopes..
