I know I'm a failure in your fucking eyes
But it doesn't matter to me cause you're fucking blind
My entire life has been a waste of time
Falling for the same tricks in a different disguise

This is my shadow self
Ever since I can remember you look out for yourself
I must be dreaming
Because for once it seems I'm seeing clearly

Did you think that you could just leave me here to die
I don't know what I did to deserve this
You don't even treat me like a fucking person

I have no heart
I have no fucking heart
Everything I touch always falls apart
Why fight for something that's not meant to be
I'm done being treated like the dirt underneath your feet

Fill my eyes with flies and cut my throat so I can't breathe
I'm so sick of the tangled web we weave
I'd give anything to rid me of these memories

THIS IS MY SHADOW SELF!
