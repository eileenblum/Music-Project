How could i have stole your spirit
You don't even have a soul

Lost in an empty vessel

Claiming connection with self
But your being is artificial

How does it feel to be so hollow?

Tongue tied by a language of lies

Drop the God complex
You are no better than the rest of us
Come back to the fucking slums

Something so small can spiral out of control
Before you even notice
It becomes your whole world
What am I to do?
I've lost my path
I never thought to

Fear the after math

Come back to the bottom
You forgot where you've come from.
