See? I told you
You can't love a monster
You can't even look me
Straight in my eyes
Why are you afraid?
Does the simple thought of my
Being alive make you pray for the exit?

I am a monster
I'm not sick
I am the disease

I have
Fallen in love
With the
Feeling of

Being filled with all this toxic
Being filled with all this toxic

I am numb
My vision spiraled into cycles of darkness
What I've become
Is something more than I thought I could be

In order to find the truth
You must make the questions
To become more than a follower
You must make the answers

The answers
