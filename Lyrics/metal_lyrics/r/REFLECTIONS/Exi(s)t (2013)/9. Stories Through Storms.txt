Well here we are again
Same song, same dance
Will this day ever not replay
Stuck in a cycle
Known as the only way

Why won't you open your mind
Everything they told you was all a lie
There's nothing wrong with your eyes
What you see is simply
The other side of the spectrum
The other side of the spectrum

It feels like everything
That you say to me
You're trying to force feed
Down my throat
Give it your best shot
I know I will not
Let your words be believed

Everyone that I ever
Have put my trust into
Has let me down except
The ones I consider blood

I'd stand through any storm
Just to show you that I'll never leave again
And that nothing could ever take me away
The stranger in the mirror
Has gone forever
And for the first time, for the first time
I know who I am now
No matter how much it hurts
