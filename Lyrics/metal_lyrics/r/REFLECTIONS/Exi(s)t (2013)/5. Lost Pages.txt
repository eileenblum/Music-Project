[feat. Becka Graham]This, this is your moment
So take your first step through the door
This is what happens when you ignore
The ones who say dreams aren't worth fighting for

Every mistake
Every single moment of regret
It can all be left behind
If you have the strength to let go

If you have the strength
To let go

I know that the hours seem like days
With my heads in my hands I beg
For my peace,
My peace of mind

I see as
The days pass
And I see
You forgetting
My face and
It hurts so much
I cannot explain
How much I wish
This would go away

Do you see
The way that things could be
Or do you only notice
The way that they are

I was lost
In a place with no light
And somewhere down this path
You turned away, away, away

I'm wondering where you've gone

I'm wondering
I'm wondering
I'm wondering
Where you've gone

I'm wondering
I'm wondering
I'm wondering
Where you've gone

This will not be
The last time you see me
I promise

This will not be
The last time you see me
I promise
