Waking up on the other side of the sunrise
My diolation will stay the same
I've grown accustomed to these cold winds
Sending shivers down my back

This is how I live
This is how I will die
You can tell me I'm sick
I still think you're full of shit

My serenity is in the empty half
Of the hourglass
And when the time runs out
I will turn the tables

We are no different than the ones you stand by
On the outside
The differences between you and I
Lie inside

A life
Consisting of a constant high
At least I'll always know
That I'm alive

At least I know I'm alive

When will you realize that you take all this too seriously
Live life by the owl's call
Fuck the ones that try to tell you how the system breathes
Live life by the owl's call

My serenity is in the empty half
Of the hourglass
And when the time runs out
I will turn the tables

It's so sad to me
The worst part of you
Took away the best part of me, away the best part of me
I used to tell myself
That I would never become someone else,
But I thought I told myself
I was going to be somebody

It's not coincidence
Things played out this way
I know you had this planned from the start

Luckily for me
I can see right through you now

I can see right through you now
