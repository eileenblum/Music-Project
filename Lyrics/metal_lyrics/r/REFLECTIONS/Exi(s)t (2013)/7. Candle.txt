I am not afraid to let the world know
You ripped my soul from my fucking chest
I have opened my eyes
Only to see you are my enemy

The candle is burning out

Is there any escape?
And if there is, can you show me the way?
I don't want to play this game
I just want to disappear
And if you take my hand
Well I can show you who I really am
Wave away to all the pain
Were bringing all the light back

This candle is burning out

You put the blame on me
To take the weight off your burden
Someday you will see
You can't escape fate

Is there any escape?
And if there is, can you show me the way?
I don't want to play this game
I just want to disappear
And if you take my hand
Well I can show you who I really am
Wave away to all the pain
Were bringing all the light back

The reason
You are alone
Is because you left us all behind
I know
That you know why
We turned our backs for the last time
