To be honest, the truth is Iâm afraid
I fear losing the only thing Iâve ever held so close

The fact is you never cared
Half as much for me as I did for you.
No matter what you say,
Youâre filling your head with lies

Telling yourself youâll be here,
When youâre not anywhere to be found

How can you just close your eyes
And pretend Iâm a ghost,
When I am haunted by the thought of you

To be honest, I wish I was like you.
I wish I could forget these memories
Did you not see me falling down
Into endless shades of grey
You watched without taking a step

I just wish you could disappear
But maybe Iâm the one who turns to smoke
Maybe this is my destiny
Maybe this is my destiny
