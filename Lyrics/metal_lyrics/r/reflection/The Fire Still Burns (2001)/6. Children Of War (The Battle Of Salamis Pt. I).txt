[Music &amp; Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis - 1995]

Kings of Greece sail to war
Men with pride and glory
Clamors of battle sounded again
As Pythia gave the calling

[Bridge]
Listen to the voices of the night
Listen to whispers of the dreams
Listen to the sound of the wind
Guiding our steps to win
Sirens screaming the night has come
The silent mist appeared
Poseidon the God of Seas and Waves
Has got His Kingdom here

[Bridge]
Listen to the voices of the night
Listen to whispers of the dreams
Listen to the sound of the wind
Guiding our steps to win

[Chorus]
Oh oh Into the Battle
Oh oh Children Of War
