[Music and Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis - 1992]

[Chorus]
Coming and losing, torturing confusing
Reflection of my life, that's the answer if you ask me why
Reflection of my life, that's the answer if you ask me why
Oh, Oh, Oh
There it is I have to go
There is nothing left to show
Was it really all my fault?
I'm the one who chose this route

[Chorus]
Coming and losing, torturing confusing
Reflection of my life, that's the answer if you ask me why
Reflection of my life, that's the answer if you ask me why
Oh, Oh, Oh
Now the sky is getting clear
Hear me Father I have no fear
Life is nice and you are too
But no one will cry when I fly away

[Chorus]
Coming and losing, torturing confusing
Reflection of my life, that's the answer if you ask me why
Reflection of my life, that's the answer if you ask me why
Oh, Oh, Oh
Reflection...
