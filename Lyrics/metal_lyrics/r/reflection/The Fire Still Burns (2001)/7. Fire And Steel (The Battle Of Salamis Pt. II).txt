[Music &amp; Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis - 1995]

The crusade for the battle begins in Salamis
The Quest for the Victory appears but we shall win
Against the Persian Army Fire and Steel
Greeks are the Masters of War Hail, Hail to Greece

[Chorus]
Fire And Steel to those who don't believe
We shall fight We'll burn the sky tonight
The night brought the dome at last, the Greeks are prepared
To fight tonight for their pride, no matter what
Sons of the Wind, Children of War, Zeus is with their side
The Ships are fast, Aeolus blew, They broke enemy lines

[Chorus]
Fire And Steel to those who don't believe
We shall fight We'll burn the sky tonight
Fire And Steel to those who don't believe
We shall fight We'll burn the sky tonight
