[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: John Tolakis - 1991]

Running into the centuries looking for your peace of mind
Running into the centuries looking for your kingdom come
Nothing's more is now yours nothing to afraid
Fighting barbarians and that is all you know

[Chorus]
You are a step before the end
One step
One step Before the End
Running into the centuries with your immortal power
Running into the centuries looking for a new life
Nothing's more is now yours nothing to afraid
Fighting barbarians and that is all you know

[Chorus]
You are a step before the end
One step
One step Before the End
