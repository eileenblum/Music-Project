[Music &amp; Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis - 1992]

We must end this madness
Children's eyes are full if sadness
Somebody said "it just a matter of time"
I believe that's our bigger crime
Chasing shadows through your life
Make you realize that we are still blind

[Bridge]
I know it might be not too late for us
To escape the wings of fate

[Chorus]
The Wings of Fate
The Wings of Fate
Everybody has got a price
Respect and honor are hard to find
Come on and think on yourself
Can you see the world is coming to the end

[Bridge]
I know it might be not too late for us
To escape the wings of fate

[Chorus]
The Wings of Fate
The Wings of Fate

[Chorus]
The Wings of Fate
The Wings of Fate
