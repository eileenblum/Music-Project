[Music &amp; Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis - 1993]

By the fire I wait to be sit
By the daughter who suckled iron
Companions of moonlight sisters of the night
The dawn is waiting for You to come
To You who rejoiced when You've burnt the oaken mast
Mother of shadows, brothers of the pain
Gift of Prometheus, Secret of the Gods
Eternal punishment but it is too late

[Chorus]
Scattering of winds, BUT YOU STAND THERE
Waiting for Your death, DARKNESS HAS PREVAILED
Only for a while, CHRIST HAS RETURNED
Gave back the flame of life
By the fire I wait to be sit
By the daughter who suckled iron
Companions of moonlight sisters of the night
The dawn is waiting for You to come
To You who rejoiced when You've burnt the oaken mast
Mother of shadows, brothers of the pain
Gift of Prometheus, Secret of the Gods
Eternal punishment but it is too late

[Chorus]
Scattering of winds, BUT YOU STAND THERE
Waiting for Your death, DARKNESS HAS PREVAILED
Only for a while, CHRIST HAS RETURNED
Gave back the flame of life
