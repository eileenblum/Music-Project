[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas - 1992]

See the sun, for a last time
Don't go back, stand up fight or die
Don't be afraid, Death is chasing You
Don't go away, one of You must win

[Bridge]
Shake the Earth, Fight to death
Don't try to escape
Shake the Earth, Fight to death
Don't try to escape
Take the sword, with the cross upon it
Ride your horse, holding close it's reins
Don't forget, He is not a mortal
He's a God, and He wants Your soul

[Chorus]
When Immortals...Die!
The light of day seems a lie
When Immortals...Die!
When Immortals...Die!
The light of day seems a lie
When Immortals...Die!
"When and darkness comes and light falls
It was then that Fear made His nest in my soul
My sword is in my hand and is blessed by thou
Let my death be the way to purity
I'm His chosen One, thy blessed by His Will
And I must fight proud to show what happens...
WHEN IMMORTALS...DIE! HA HA HA HA"
See the sun, for a last time
Don't go back, stand up fight or die
Don't be afraid, Death is chasing You
Don't go away, one of You must win

[Chorus]
When Immortals...Die!
The light of day seems a lie
When Immortals...Die!
When Immortals...Die!
The light of day seems a lie
When Immortals...Die!

[Chorus]
When Immortals...Die!
The light of day seems a lie
When Immortals...Die!
When Immortals...Die!
The light of day seems a lie
When Immortals...Die!
