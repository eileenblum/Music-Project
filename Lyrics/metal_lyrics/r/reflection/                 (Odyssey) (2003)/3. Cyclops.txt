[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Chris Kappas]

The giant is lurking into the shadows
Like a statue standing so proud
Lurid He is, a God child
Like oak He stands
Mountain man alone in darkness
As He drinks the divine wine
Angry He is by the strangers
Disgrace them made them fear

[Chorus]
Poseidon Son proud and evil
One by one the companions die
Poseidon Son proud and evil
One by one the companions die
But this hellish heart can not escape
Their rage is bigger than the fear
The plan is ready to execute
The stick is burning into His eye

[Chorus]
Poseidon Son blind with pain
Polyphemus the Beast with the fierce soul
Blindness is the punishment forever
Blindness is the punishment forever
