[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

The Earth is trembling tonight
A huge form appears from behind
Tall as a mountain he stands
Welcome To Lestrygon's Land ?

[Bridge]
Oh, oh...the giant is out again
Oh, oh...watch for your life
A body like stone, his eyes so cold
The giant is out again
Oh, oh...prepare for the fight

[Chorus]
Giants...huge and fearless sons of Gods
Giants...eaters of the flesh
Giants...between the ground and the shining sky
Ulysses...Fight until the end
Giants...huge and fearless sons of Gods
Giants...eaters of the flesh
Giants...between the ground and the shining sky
Fire, blood and death awaits
The slaughter now begins
In shore are wrecked all the ships
Those who had luck to the cape
Only Ulysses ship shall escape

[Bridge]
Oh, oh...the giant is out again
Oh, oh...watch for your life
A body like stone, his eyes so cold
The giant is out again
Oh, oh...prepare for the fight

[Chorus]
Giants...huge and fearless sons of Gods
Giants...eaters of the flesh
Giants...between the ground and the shining sky
Ulysses...Fight until the end
Giants...huge and fearless sons of Gods
Giants...eaters of the flesh
Giants...between the ground and the shining sky
Fire, blood and death awaits
