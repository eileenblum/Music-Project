[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stahtis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

Queen announced she has decided
The old bow to be Her guide
He who dares to have the pride

[Bridge]
Who will be strong enough?
To be Master of the land?
Old and proud standing there
Only Kings hands should dare
Precious gift sign of war

[Bridge]
Wisdom Goddess, give your sign
The old bow to be my guide

[Chorus]
Who will dare to bend the bow?
Shining axes stand in row
Contest starts, who will be Lord?
Who will dare to bend the bow?
One by one the claimants dare
For the ragged dressed no one cared
Reign of fear begins to appear

[Bridge]
'Cause our strength is not enough
Bow and sting can not be won
The old beggar makes a wish
Just to see if he could reach
The strength and power of his youth

[Bridge]
Bow and string became one
He is the Master of the land

[Chorus]
Who will dare to bend the bow?
Shining axes stand in row
Contest starts, who will be Lord?
Who will dare to bend the bow?
Who will dare to bend the bow?
Who will dare to bend the bow?
Who will dare to bend the bow?
Who will dare to bend the bow?
