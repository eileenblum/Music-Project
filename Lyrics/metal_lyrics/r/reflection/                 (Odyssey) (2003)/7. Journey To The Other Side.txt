[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

In the shadows he creeps
To the land where no life dwells
Travelers in the western seas
To the other side of the mirror
For the great prophecy he seeks
Of the blind prophet Teresias
Who lives among the dead ones
To the other side of the mirror

[Chorus]
To deepest seas we've traveled
To strongest winds we've conquered
To strange lands we're heading
Journey to the other side
The underworld is waiting
United we shall make it
Our power is divine
Journey to the other side
The prophet's soul is coming
The most proud of all (the) dead
(The) Master of all prophets
To the other side of the mirror
As he drinks the black blood
The great prophecy he speaks
For the return to kings land
To the other side of the mirror

[Chorus]
To deepest seas we've traveled
To strongest winds we've conquered
To strange lands we're heading
Journey to the other side
The underworld is waiting
United we shall make it
Our power is divine
Journey to the other side
To all heroes and friends
For a last time he talks
And to his dead mother's soul
To the other side of the mirror
The keeper he escapes
Persephone didn't release her
He is the one who returns
From the other side of the mirror

[Chorus]
To deepest seas we've traveled
To strongest winds we've conquered
To strange lands we're heading
Journey to the other side
The underworld is waiting
United we shall make it
Our power is divine
Journey to the other side
