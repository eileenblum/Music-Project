[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

As we seek our destiny
The island of the Sun we see
Thirst and tiredness makes us pray
(But) Our oath is made never to break
Sleep now comes next day begins
The ships are tied by strong south winds
Cursed by (the) Gods the winds still blow
One month have passed still try to go

[Chorus]
Silence
In the land of no escape
The oath should never break
Silence
In the island of the Sun
Slaughter has begun
Slaughter
Days passed by the hunger grows
Despair and anguish breaks them all
The king decides to search the land
Helpless thought the die is cast
(The) Vow is forgotten, fate is sealed
But Gods forced (the) king to deep sad sleep
Temptation is great anxiety (is) increased
(The) sacred animals are killed

[Chorus]
Silence
The Gods of light betrayed
The oath should never break
Silence
In the island of the Sun
Slaughter has begun
Slaughter
