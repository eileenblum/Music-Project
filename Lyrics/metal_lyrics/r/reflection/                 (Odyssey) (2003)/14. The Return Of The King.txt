[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Chris Kappas]

Father and Son into battle
Like eagles in the air they fight
Side by side standing so proud
For justice and their Kingdom they kill

[Bridge]
Master (Master) of all Masters (Master) He seeks for revenge
A King (King) He is, see Him (Of The Land) how proud He fights
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Beware the sky ? is raining blood
Beware the sea ? is crimson dressed
Beware the wind ? is blowing fast
Beware the King ? THE KING IS BACK
Glory for the Kings return
The last act of the tragedy
The lament is now over
The King is forever back

[Bridge]
Master (Master) of all Masters (Master) He seeks for revenge
A King (King) He is, see Him (Of The Land) how proud He fights
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Beware the sky ? is raining blood
Beware the sea ? is crimson dressed
Beware the wind ? is blowing fast
Beware the King ? THE KING IS BACK
