[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Chris Kappas]

The silence is broken
The sky is blazing
By honor, glory and pride
Return to the land
God of wind blow fast tonight
Seas of anguish make our pride
The adventure begin

[Chorus]
Still sail on the seas
On wings our ship fly
To the Holy Land of dreams
Endless days and endless nights
Destiny seems so close
But the Wind blows to the North
Soon a strange land appear
The adventure begins

[Chorus]
Still sail on the seas
On wings our ship fly
To the Holy Land of dreams
Endless days and endless nights

[CAST OF CHARACTERS:
ULYSSES
