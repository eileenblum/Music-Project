[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis]

Seven years in the fairy's island
Gazing the sea and the stars
Oblivion rivers and skies of sorrow
Makes him to dream of the past ?
The days became months and the months became years
And still his sadness unfolds
The fairy's love and compassion to him
Makes him to suffer more ?
Eternal life and youth he was promised
With tears he was begged just to stay
His every dream would become reality
But his decision remained

[Bridge]
Oh Oh Oh
His destiny was his home
Oh Oh Oh
The tears and the dreams could not stop

[Chorus]
Gods please hear my plea
Take away the sorrow and pain
Just to see my land for last time
Only once and then I may die
Zeus the Thunderer heard his plea
The Fates have decide for his life
Hermes leaves from the skies above
And reaches the Fairy's land
The message was clear the king had to leave
Her love could not make him stay
With tears in her eyes and sorrow in Her heart
In divine order She obey

[Bridge]
Oh Oh Oh
His destiny was his home
Oh Oh Oh
The tears and the dreams could not stop

[Chorus]
Gods please hear my plea
Take away the sorrow and pain
Just to see my land for last time
Only once and then I may die
