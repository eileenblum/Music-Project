[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

And when the dark night falls
I gaze up at the sky
I pray to the mighty
The mighty Gods of the Light
Athena, show mercy
Have mercy for my poor soul
And when the day comes alive
Send me back to Ithaca shores
The Goddess hears his plea
And with the first light of the sun
Like beggar makes his disguise
With rags She dresses him up
No one can tell who he is
Not even Evmeos, his loyal friend
And when the time will come
He plans on taking revenge

[Chorus]
Beware of the night
Beware of the stars
The curse is now broken
The King will be back
And 'till night falls
The claimants should (be) killed
The crowd shall hail the return of the King
Give me a sign?
Beware Of The Night
Who is this stranger
Who claims to be the King of the land
I can't believe that it happens
Like God He seems in my eyes
Oh hear me my Father
I was a child since you left our land
I thank all the Gods now
The time for revenge has now come

[Chorus]
Beware of the night
Beware of the stars
The curse is now broken
The King will be back
And 'till night falls
The claimants should (be) killed
The crowd shall hail the return of the King
Give me a sign?
Beware Of The Night
