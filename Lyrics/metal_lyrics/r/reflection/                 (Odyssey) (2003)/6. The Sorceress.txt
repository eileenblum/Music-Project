[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

Spells and crafts are here
In the land where the sun sets
Can you sense the fear?
A heavenly voice is near
The Goddess gave us drink
The magic juice
Her deadly touch we fear
But it's too late
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Chorus]
The Sorceress
Her magic spells are near
The Sorceress
The power to heal
The Sorceress
Is it real or just a dream
Ulysses
Beware his sword of steel
The King sets for the quest
Where the stone palace lies
With sword and bow at hand
By the power of Gods he talks
Her poison juice he drinks
But the magic spells will fail
His turn comes for revenge
As the witch asks for his love
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Chorus]
The Sorceress
Her magic spells are near
The Sorceress
The power to heal
The Sorceress
Is it real or just a dream
Ulysses
Beware his sword of steel

[Bridge]
Spells and craft we fear no more
Our trip begins to the underworld
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Chorus]
The Sorceress
Her magic spells are near
The Sorceress
The power to heal
The Sorceress
Is it real or just a dream
Ulysses
Beware his sword of steel
