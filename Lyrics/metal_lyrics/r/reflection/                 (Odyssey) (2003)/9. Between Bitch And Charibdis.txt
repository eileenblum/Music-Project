[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

Through the storm
Gazing to the unknown
The smell of death
Surrounds the red dressed sea
No one ever lived
From the deadly Bitch
No one knows
The legend of Charibdis

[Chorus]
Secrets, secrets of seven seas
Creatures that never before you've seen
Ulysses you have to find the quiz
You must decide...the Bitch or the Charibdis
The wind now blows
And the sea disappears from our eyes
The challenge begins
Athena please help me this time
My sword and spear
Are thirsty for blood tonight
But the Bitch is too strong
She brings death from above

[Chorus]
Secrets, secrets of seven seas
Creatures that never before you've seen
Ulysses you have to find the quiz
You must decide...the Bitch or the Charibdis
