[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

Nine days against the wind
Sailing to the unknown
As the dawn breaks across the ocean
A strange land appears again
Come (and) rest our precious friends
Come and taste our unique seed
Sweet and magic a gift of Gods
Can force your soul can free your mind

[Chorus]
Forget and dream no more
Into oblivion fall
Your land you'll never see
Don't taste (the) forbidden seed
Those who dared to taste it
Are tied now upon the sails
Forbidden fruit the nightmare ends
The leave behind the lotus land

[Chorus]
Forget and dream no more
Into oblivion fall
Your land you'll never see
Don't taste (the) forbidden seed
