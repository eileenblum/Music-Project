[Music: Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics: Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

Don't try to forget the dreams of the night
The nightmares that haunt you the day
Don't try to escape for the thoughts of your mind
There's no hope you can not escape
The eyes of the night are always upon youÂ 
They'll force you to horror and pain
The weak will fall, the strong will survive
But always the price is the pain

[Chorus]
Pain...you bring only sorrow
Pain...you bring terror and horror
Pain...you bring only sorrow
Pain...you bring terror and horror
You wake in the night afraid of your shadow
Searching for proofs in your closet
The presence is near like curse is upon you
The pain will always be there

[Chorus]
Pain...you bring only sorrow
Pain...you bring terror and horror
Pain...you bring only sorrow
Pain...you bring terror and horror

[Chorus]
Pain...you bring only sorrow
Pain...you bring terror and horror
Pain...you bring only sorrow
Pain...you bring terror and horror
