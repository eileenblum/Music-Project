[Music : Stathis Pavlandis, Lyrics : Stathis Pavlandis, Chris Kappas]

Feel the night...
As light is fading and darkness is falling
See the eyes...
Don't try to hide you can not escape

[Bridge]
All the secrets and sins
All the fears and dreams
Feel the night...
As light is fading and darkness is falling

[Bridge]
All the secrets and sins
All the fears and dreams

[Chorus]
You can not escape by the eyes of the night
The eyes of the night
See her face...
As pale and white her eyes are watching
Hear her song...
Her voice like music is taking you away

[Bridge]
All the secrets and sins
All the fears and dreams
Feel the night...
As light is fading and darkness is falling

[Bridge]
All the secrets and sins
All the fears and dreams

[Chorus]
You can not escape by the eyes of the night
The eyes of the night

[Bridge]
All the secrets and sins
All the fears and dreams

[Chorus]
You can not escape by the eyes of the night
The eyes of the night
The eyes of the night
