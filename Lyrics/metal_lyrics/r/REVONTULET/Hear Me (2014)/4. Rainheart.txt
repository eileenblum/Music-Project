[Part I]

Tell me itâs not in vainâ¦
You wonât ever hear
Anything that I want to tell
Anything that I feel.

Music my farewell,
My verse effaced lines,
My lonely voice will fade away
Into endless silence.

Between summer and fall
When midnight blues,
Between night and dawn
When sunrise kisses moon,
When tears drown in rainfall,
When heavens fall apart,
This ceasing music
Flows from my lone rainheart.

Raindrops and fallen leaves
Hold smoke in dying dance
Itâs just a memory â your kiss on my lips,
Our never romance.

Between summer and fall
When midnight blues,
Between night and dawn
When sunrise kisses moon,
When tears drown in rainfall,
When heavens fall apart,
This ceasing music
Flows from my lone rainheart.

[Part II]

All the songs that I sing for you
Youâll forget. I know the bitter truth.
Risen sun
Must go down
Dying lightâs glowing from afar,
Melodyâs raining from my heart.

Dying lightâs glowing from afar,
Melodyâs raining from my heart.

Between summer and fall
When midnight blues,
Between night and dawn
When sunrise kisses moon,
When tears drown in rainfall,
When heavens fall apart,
This ceasing music
Flows from my lone rainheart.

[Part III]

Until the day I am gone (lifeâs so lone)
Will be my efforts in vain? (love is pain)
I want to fall with the rain
Just once more
I want to fall with the rain
Just once, once for my rainheart

Between summer and fall
When midnight blues,
Between night and dawn
When sunrise kisses moon,
When tears drown in rainfall,
When heavens fall apart,
This ceasing music
Flows from my lone rainheart.

Music my farewell,
My verse effaced lines,
My lonely voice will fade away
Into endless silence.
