Deep in the abyss of soul
The purest music was born
Iâve lost the place we belong
Maybe someday youâll hear my song

Play the love prelude for me
â¦Never endingâ¦
Touch the hidden key in me
â¦I am waitingâ¦
Play the black and white
â¦tonightâ¦
My pianist of the darkest night

Child of December cold winds
Fly on a melodyâs wings
Touch ivory and ebony
Once more breathe your music into me.

Play the love prelude for me
â¦.Never endingâ¦
Touch the hidden key in me
â¦I am waitingâ¦
Play the black and white
â¦tonightâ¦
My pianist of the darkest night
