Lead me to your beauty,
Show where your breeze sings alone.
Shades disappeared, sunrise is blooming
With open heart I meet new dawn

In your lakes and your forests dwell silence and calmness
I can hear that your winds are still calling for me
Walk the long road home, Iâm so tired and lonely
I left my heart in your blue eyes, Suomi

Tell me your old stories,
Touch my heart with your tale.
Whispering trees lull my worries
For all thrills are in vain.

In your lakes and your forests dwell silence and calmness
I can hear that your winds are still calling for me
Walk the long road home, Iâm so tired and lonely
I left my heart in your blue eyes, Suomi

Starlit sky holds me tight,
Northern nights hide truth
Till rising sun turns dim into bright.
Youâre so far awayâ¦ I miss you

In your lakes and your forests dwell silence and calmness
I can hear that your winds are still calling for me
Walk the long road home, Iâm so tired and lonely
I left my heart in your blue eyes, Suomi
