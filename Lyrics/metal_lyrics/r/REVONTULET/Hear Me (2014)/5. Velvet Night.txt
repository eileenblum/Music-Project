Your scent on my skinâ¦
Youâre my consolation and sinâ¦
And I only wish to wake up
In your armsâ¦

Your taste on my lipsâ¦
Lie on my breast and sleepâ¦
And I smile but tear touches my eyeâ¦
You are mineâ¦

When two souls kiss in touch of fingertips, 
You can hear I breathe in lust and passionâs bliss.
You will hold me tight, ardent and wild 
All this velvet night.

Moonbeam, only you and Iâ¦
My dream is so simple -
to live and die
In your armsâ¦

When two souls kiss in touch of fingertips, 
You can hear I breathe in lust and passionâs bliss.
You will hold me tight, ardent and wild 
All this endless night, 
Velvet nightâ¦
