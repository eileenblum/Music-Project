From the abyss of hell to the dark side of moon
Iâve been going for ages and ages.
And I have no more tears, no more love, no more fears.
Iâm not mortal, but Iâm not an angel.

Am I dead? 
Youâre alive.
Is it truth? 
No, Itâs lie.
We are locked on the heaven in cages.
Are you glad? 
No, Iâm crying.
Donât you know I will die?
Yes, I know. Iâm Infernal Angel.

From the sunlight to dust youâre so gloomy and doomed.
Youâve been lonely for ages and ages.
You wonât die, but I will. You have gone, but I hear
Your sweet voice. I can see fallen angel.

Am I dead? 
Youâre alive.
Is it truth? 
No, Itâs lie.
We are locked on the heaven in cages.
Are you glad? 
No, Iâm crying.
Donât you know I will die?
Yes, I know. Iâm Infernal Angel.

And today here we are, but tomorrow - just ash.
Itâs our blame and weâll never be free.
We are always apart and our hearts will be crashed
As weâll do it for you and me.

Are we dead? 
Weâre alive.
Is it truth? 
No, Itâs lie.
We are locked on the heaven in cages.
Are we glad? 
No, we're crying.
Donât you know I will die?
Yes, I know. Iâm Infernal Angel.
