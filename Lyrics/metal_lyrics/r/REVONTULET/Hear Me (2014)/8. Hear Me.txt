[Part I "Love"]

Do you remember
Dim light and eye to eye,
Every breath and sight.
Do you remember
All those words untold,
Passion concealed,
Our hearts closed.

I touched you hair
On that cold misty morning
Your fingertips
Were caressing my spine.
It was bitter prelude
For a sweetest torment.
Before the dawn
You were already mineâ¦

Hear me!
I want to hold you,
My dear! Please,
Donât look away!
For I felt my heartbeat
With yours in that longingâ¦
I want to feel
The same once again!

And everyday
Waking up in the morning
Look at your smile
And embrace you tight.
And wherever you go
You wonât be so lonely
I will be there,
I will stay by your side!

Hear me!
I want to hold you,
My dear! Please,
Donât look away!
For I felt my heartbeat
With yours in that longingâ¦
I want to feel
The same once again!

Hear me!
Iâve loved you right
From the start,
And wherever you are
I will feel you heartbeat
with mine lone and longing
Till time is through
My voice will guide youâ¦

[Part II "Hope"]

Now itâs too lateâ¦
All the days passed by,
All illusions fadeâ¦
Lost and loneâ¦
Even stone cracks
When time is gone.

Living all my life
In pride, greed and lie.
Thereâs nobody you can call,
Rise and fall.
Praying just to breathe
Once more
At the heavenâs door.
Darkest fears
And you hearâ¦

Requiem aeternam
dona eis, Domine,
et lux perpetua luceat...
Requiem aeternam
dona eis, Domine,
et lux perpetua luceat...

Now itâs too lateâ¦
All the precious faces
Will be erased.
Lone and lostâ¦
Echoes will bring
Voice of the past.

Living all my life
In pride, greed and lie.
Thereâs nobody you can call,
Rise and fall.
Praying just to breathe
Once more
At the heavenâs door.
Darkest fears
And you hearâ¦

Leaving all my life
Behind, I canât hide
Bleeding heart
In world of wroth,
Lust and sloth.
Giving all my love
To you until time is through.
Fears are gone
âCuase youâre my
Hope

[Part III "Pass"]

Deep in the darkness
As the last grain fell,
Whispers are gone
and the silence
Will be our last farewell

So go far away, my loveâ¦
You go where time is through
So go far away, my loveâ¦
I sing for you!

I touch your pale face
I taste your lips so sweet,
Donât be afraid âcause
the silence
Dwells in your own heartbeat

So go far away, my loveâ¦
You go where time is through
So go far away, my loveâ¦
I sing for you!

So go far away, my loveâ¦
You go where time is through
So go far away, my loveâ¦
My heart always beats for you!

Hear me!
I want to hold you,
My dear! Please,
Donât look away!
For I felt my heartbeat
With yours in that longingâ¦
I want to feel
The same once again!

Hear me!
Iâve loved you right
From the start,
And wherever you are
I will feel you heartbeat
with mine lone and longing
Till time is through
My voice will guide youâ¦
