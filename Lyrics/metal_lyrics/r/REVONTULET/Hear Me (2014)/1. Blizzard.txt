Snow is falling slowly down 
Christmas tale is played and gone
Icy blood, heart of snow
Northern lights burnt out my soul

Lost the trace of one whoâs blest
Cruelty grows from sadness
Everything that was so frail
Is broken by betrayal.

Fire burns in my frozen soul

Blizzard, take heart from me
And crystal tears from my cheeks!
Shared my soul with the storm
Shall I pray for forgiveness?

Snowflakes touch my weary lids
My senses stray in shining ocean
Cold and despair crawl from my fingertips
The howling wind drowns my silent devotion

Fire burns in my frozen soul

Blizzard, take heart from me
And crystal tears from my cheeks!
Shared my soul with the storm
Shall I pray for forgiveness?

Fire burns in my frozen soul

Blizzard, take heart from me
And crystal tears from my cheeks!
Shared my soul with the storm
Shall I pray for forgiveness?

Blizzard, take my heart from me
And crystal tears from my cheeks!
Sold my soul to the storm
So I pray please forgive me, forgive me!

Midnight sun flares in my burnt soul.
