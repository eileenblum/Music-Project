Youâre my hope, youâre my new life.
Youâre the dawn. Iâm the dark night.
Iâm not yours. You wonât be my.
We have lost our summertime.

Wind kisses me goodbye
Pale moonlight makes me blind
My life is on the wane
I will be crucified 
We are like fallen leaves
We bloom and weâll die
My mind is broken dream
Eternal autumn is mine.

Take my hand. Itâs our last touch.
Say my name. Love is too muchâ¦
You are my tamed desire.
Summer night, ice meets fire.

Wind kisses me goodbye
Pale moonlight makes me blind
My life is on the wane
I will be crucified 
We are like fallen leaves
We bloom and weâll die
My mind is broken dream
Eternal autumn is mine.

My sadness shows the way 
To the first ray of day
Till sunlight conquers night
I will be by your side
Still Iâve got flesh and blood
Still Iâve got beating heart
Life passes through my mind
Eternal autumn wonât die
