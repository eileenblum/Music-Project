You crossed the line
Once for all
Keep your fucking hands off

They don't need you
They don't want you
No excuses, no empty promises
They won't eat your fucking lies anymore

You scumbag, piece of shit
You better watch your fucking step

Justice
Will hit you like a bullet
Right between your eyes.
Justice will haunt you
Until you beg for mercy,
Until you regret it
