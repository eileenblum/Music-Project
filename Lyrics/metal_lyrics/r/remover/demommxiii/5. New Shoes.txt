New shoes, new phone, new car.
Just Do it.
New pants, new screen, new house.
Have it Your Way.
New girl, new friends, new life.
Keep the wheel of fortune running
And consume.

Consume, consume, consume
Consume, consume, consume

Sounds like a familiar movie quote
"Working jobs we hate,
So we can buy shit we don't need."
And it all goes on repeat
Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.

Work, buy, die.
Doesn't it feel great?
Consume your whole fucking life
You are just a fucking slave
