Pushed to the corner,
Back on the wall.
Your next move -
Grit on your teeth?
Or just bottle up again?
Bite the hand that feeds?

If you never say a word
You will never make a stand
If you never start a fire
There will never be a storm
If you never say a word
There will never be a fucking storm

Your history of defeat
Is written within your scars
Your fears are holding you back
You will never make a difference

Make the first step,
Break out of your old patterns,
Bite the hand that feeds!
Even its your own.
