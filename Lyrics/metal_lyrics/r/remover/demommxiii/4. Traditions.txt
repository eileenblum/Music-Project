Your traditions mean shit to me.
You're still holding on
To that bullshit ideology
Stuck in the past
No sense of change to see
A lack of independence
Is what I really see

Like a child with no one to play
You're just tied to your mommy's apron strings.
Use the goddamn thing between your goddamn ears
And start to fucking think,
Start to fucking think!

Do you need that following of medieval rules
I bet you need someone to beat that shit out of you
Knock knock. Who's there?
It's equality kicking your front door.
Your black and white dream is fucking over

Blank pages on your holy book?
Your church is burning.
Where is your preacherman?
Where is your preacherman?

You are a dying breed.
The water is poisoned.
Can I get a fuckng amen?
Can I get a fuckng amen now?
