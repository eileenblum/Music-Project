I feel ashamed
To be born in a country
Full of xenophobic rednecks.

And I will never raise
Your fucking flag.

Why should I be proud of
Something I didn't create?

This is not my anthem.
Your pride will have a fall.

Nationalism is a disease.

Burn every flag,
Burn your passport,
Break down every border,
That is the only cure.

Nationalism is a disease.
