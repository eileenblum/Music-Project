I don't believe
There is a savior.
I don't believe
There is something higher.

There is no one
Judging every step,
There is no one
Accounting every lie.
I don't have to look for excuses.

Hurt if you wanna get hurt,
Kill if you wanna get killed
Love if you wanna be loved
Let live if you wanna fucking live

What goes around comes back around,
As simple as it is.
That's what I believe in,
That's my fucking revelation.

Karma
