Yeah, thanks,
I don't give a shit about your band.

No, we didn't sold a hundred shirts on our last show
Oh yeah, your songs have a message, too
About your new haircut or how you lost your I-Pod?

Congratulations!
You so called heroes
Must be proud of your fancy new
Energy drink endorsement contract

I don't give a shit about your crew
I don't give a shit about your attitude.
If that's what it's all about
I fucking quit
