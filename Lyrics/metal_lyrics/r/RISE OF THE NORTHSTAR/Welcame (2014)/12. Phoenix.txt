From our dust we rise!

Facing the carnage
The pain, the sadness, remains the rage
Of living and fighting until we die
Challenging the sun, all gods I defy
For rebirth of Japan, I dip my pen
In the blood of victims I drown my brain
Double back of nature, it's fuckin hard
But harder and harder we'll be our fuckin charge
Return Of The Nihon Supremacy
Show to the world a quiet dignity
Face the danger, you wait on the ring
Unscarred by death, armed with Phoenix Wings
Straight to your face and nothing to lose
Nothing to win but everything to prove
Proving our support to you and your town
From Paris City, We scream this song!

Pom Pom fire with the saiya style
Feed your rage with these fucking lines
And when it's full of all my words
Change yourself into a firebird

The motto of my fucking rhymes,
Against March Eleven and his prime time, I cry,
Brothers and sisters fallen with my tears
Behind the wave you have the big fear my dear
But Stand up, catch and break this mother fuck,
It's never over swell your cosmos like a Pump
Finally I have a message, for all our fellas,
Much support from R.O.T.N!

Pom Pom fire with the saiya style
Feed your rage with these fucking lines
And when it's full of all my words
Change yourself into a firebird

Take off motherfucker

And I hear all those guys about twenty twelve
The final judgment and all these bullshit
Keep your god, your books and your predictions... Hit it up with this!

Never get beaten by the disaster
JAPAN!
Never get beaten by the disaster
JAPAN!
