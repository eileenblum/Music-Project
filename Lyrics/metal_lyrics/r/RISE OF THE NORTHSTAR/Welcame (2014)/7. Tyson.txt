Here is a new boxing â Era
Nineteen eighty Six / Nineteen ninety, Undisputed Champion
I was a kid but I remember the glory days of "Iron Mike Tyson"
With clack short shorts and black low shoes
Let me represent my vibes, represent the old school
Fuck rhinestone and sequins, fuck them all
I only know how to bite, I'm an animal
Seven two one / six four five
When my technique speaks I feel alive
"Everybody's got plans 'til they get hit."
From Brooklyn to the ring I want to devastate it
Five foot frame for hundred kilograms
My speed kills like snakes attack rising from the ground
Strength to your head my punch have "Bad Intentions"
Demolition is the key, I got the key for demolition
Yo-you-yo-yo-young I was a fe-fe-fe-fe-fearful
Invert the roles, welcome to "The Death Desert" rule
Fear is a bullet and your brain the tagger
Clik Clik up on the ring and you'll find the darkness
Ah ah ah ah "Power and Skill"
My time to rise, my time to Kill
Ah ah ah ah "Power and Skill"
My time to rise, my time to Kill
Just "Punch Out!"
