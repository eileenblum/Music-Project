Bringing it back!

Out of nowhere let me introduce my self
Vithia, Singer, seeker of the mind's abyss
Leader, armed like a dunce
Yeah my weird accent comes from there, I confess
Love Jap comics and heavy music over all
Trouble maker forever against all
Pissed off since the first day,
Trying to get out, following his own way

Bringing it back kid
Bringing it back!

The Furyo Style is in my blood
Kick in the desk, Learn on the floor
Never underrate the Underdog
(We) Came in this game to smash the score

By my side you can see four Yankees, rookies
Bad time, bad day, they ended up here
Defending their dream / Showing no weakness
Through their hands you discover fear
The fear to step back with your fake clic clac
In your back you find real life
"Big Bang Attack", yeah you will disappear
Singer screamer liar, gimme the mic
And learn the real fear

Bringing it back kid
Bringing it back!
The Furyo Style is in my blood
kick in the desk, Learn on the floor
Never underrate the Underdog
(We) Came in this game to smash the score

So What!?

I told ya mother fucker
We are not anyone
We struggle like no one to move on
Each track is a revenge
The nerd's revenge
Except us, who can believe in us?
Five branches of the same star
Will rise above to guide the troops
Yeah that's right
The Rise Of The NorthStar !
