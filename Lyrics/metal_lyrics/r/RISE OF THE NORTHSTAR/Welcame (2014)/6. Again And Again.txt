No motherfucking topic for this one, just a freestyle
Ssup' Shibuya, it's the Saiya's return
Stand up, rise up, let's your cosmos burn
Pah Pah Pah, Demonstrate some Saiya Style

Stay Gold like a Saint, represent this vibe
Focused on the curveball like an animal
Welcome to the jungle, town to town

R.O.T. to the motherfucking N
One day, one show, take a look around

To all the lovers, the haters
Ardent supporters
Since the beginning we play if fair
Follow the trend, we don't care

[Chorus:]
Again and again and again and again
We Smash the Game
And again and again and again and again
Remember our name / Furyo 'til I Die

I've been educated so I use the key,
But to break the window, call me Jagi.
I'm a big Lunatic, forgive me for that,
White socks, white shoes, all dressed in black

My inner self tells me to find
A sensitive flow with a big fat sound
Write our story, represent our name
Forever, whatever, not matter the pain

To all the lovers, the haters
Ardent supporters
Since the beginning we play if fair
Follow the trend, we don't care

[Chorus]

We came to the Stadium, play in Japan here is the mission
After two years, Demonstrating our Saiya style in Tokyo / Cheers
First album is out / There is a new big challenge to confront
Become a generation leader, here is the goal

[Chorus]
