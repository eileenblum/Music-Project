United but different,
Rise of the northstar,
United and stronger,
THAT'S WHO WE ARE! Ponk!

Revenge this word comes to me
when I read the name of my fucking team,
Step up, jump up, Tokoyotes bad boys,
(our) Japanese dream is out of control,
Honest is our approach, cause we are true to ourselves,
But hard will be the road, where bastards will spit their poorness,
Strange for you is R.O.T.N Star,
but for my passion Iâm ready to die,
And for all these guys behind us,
LET ME SCREAM THIS CHORUS!

One for all
One for all
One for all
ONE FOR!!!

I speack to these fake ghetto bands,
all these crews limited by their names,
I donât give a fuck about your codes and your clichÃ©s,
move your âpainâ and let me,
Spit my rage and break the cage
of your spirit, just turn the page,
My life, wrote in my lyrics,
not crazy but at least itâs authentic,
A revolution doesnât happen on itâs own,
ours will be accompanied by the crowd,
Never say âneverâ, never âgive a fuckâ,
If you like this response, PUT YOUR HANDS UP!

One for all
One for all
One for all
ONE FOR!!!

Our identity was born at the end of the world
And thatâs where youâll hear my lyrics resound.
Bow to the fist of the north star
My name is Kenshiro and I'm your worst nightmare

Rise of the NORTHSTAR!
Rise of the NORTHSTAR!
Rise of the NORTHSTAR!
Rise of the NORTHSTAR!
