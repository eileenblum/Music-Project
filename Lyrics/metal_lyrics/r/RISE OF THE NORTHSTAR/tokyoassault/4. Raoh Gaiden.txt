Have you ever seen the star?
Have you ever seen the star?
Have you ever seen the star?
Near the great bear!

Itâs because you were meant to do to fight against me,
The death star announces the sad destiny of my ennemies

The sound of the master
The sound of the master
The sound of the master
Joined da empire to avoid your disaster

Since I was born in this world,
Since I was born in this world,
Since I was born in this world,
Iâm gonna hold it in my hand!

The legend of the terrible Kenâoh begins now,
If you want to take this life, come as you want and fight

The sound of the master
The sound of the master
The sound of the master
Joined da empire to avoid your disaster

I'm Kenâoh! And Kenâoh wonât kneel!

MAS-TER
MAS-TER
MAS-TER
Of da empire!
