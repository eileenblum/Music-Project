Fuck you all!

Ignorance 
Submission 
Here's your relation to the norm
Proud to have found a tribe
You feel strong with good vibes. 

Intolerance
Stupidity
That's what you defend... 
While judging us,
While judging me!

And I see all these fucking weaks lost in their codes,
(In their codes!)
Forgetting who they are, what they want, and mostly why
(Cunt!),
Trying to find a salvation, in the fall of others,
They make it a mission, and dare speak about honor?! 

You're wasting your time trying to stop me,

Cause it's been a longtime I found myself... 
And my enemies! 
A big French guy with a Japanese swag,
Bring it, bring it, bring back the furyo style,
ROTNS until death,
You can't test the beast without the rest of the clic.

And I see all these fucking weaks lost in their codes,
(In their codes!),
Forgetting who they are, what they want, and mostly why
(Cunt!),
Trying to find a salvation, in the fall of others,
They make it a mission,
And dare speak about honor?!

Yeah you speak about honor...
And integrity? 

North-Star kick the lyrics!
Without my team I can't tangle all these bricks, 
And build the bridge that'll take us to Japan, 
Ssup shibuya! since the beginning that's the plan, 
I see on my back a lot of people who laugh, 
Whisper, spit and don't understand our acts, 
Why are they dressed in black? 
Why Japan? 
What does it mean "Bring back the Furyo Style"? 
Chikichikichek you can't ward off my tricks, 
"Muire" strategy with da Rookies techniques, 
A fucking childhood dream that you can't stop,
Hostile, even when others think they're cops!

Yanasane! 

Against All!
