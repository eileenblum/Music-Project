Times are hard today for me and I,
I miss them since the begining guy,
and all this hate tires me, Real
This life shakes me up, puts me in the ordeal
Headbutt, kickback, mother fucking chop
But I won't become slave of my troubles, I get up,
Pop Pop Saiya's way'll push me up,
I've lost my marks but maybe it's my trump

Challenge your fears
Never look back
Keep walking
Fight for your dreams

Respect your childhood dreams,
cuz you'd never been closer to yourself than at this age,
Teen, you learn and seek,
but sometimes you get lost and fall,
at this moment rise up and take control,
chose the good way, hard way, find a goal,
fight 'till you die, protect your ideas
and walk all the way with da Saiya spirit

Challenge your fears
Never look back
Keep walking
Fight for your dreams

Like I Do
No more lies
Unleash the beast inside!

He tells me "One day you'll reap what you've sown
The good, the bad, take care of your own"
Yeah how thing's change and now this is my turn
To come with my friends and a good microphone
I stand up for my peops, against myself
I shoot down the barriers, like anybody else
opposed to my reason, wanna break my mind
from my infinite torments, take these rhymes

Challenge your fears
Never look back
Keep walking
Fight for your dreams

Like I Do
No more lies
Unleash the beast inside!

Just wake up
wake it up
Find in your mind da sayan rage

Like I Do
No more lies
Unleash the beast inside!
