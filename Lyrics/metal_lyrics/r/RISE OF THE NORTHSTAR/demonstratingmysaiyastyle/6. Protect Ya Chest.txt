[Bonus Track]Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay,
Gimme the mic so I can fuck it away
Straight from my mind without compromise
A team puts the uniform for another round
R.O.T.N, Revenge Of The Nerds
Star on the track, let your cosmos burn
Burn your ear and shut your mouth
Da "Futago team" is in da house

Back on stage on the road again,
&amp; again and again consumed by the rage
But no pain no gain, thatâs the deal
I just wanna leave
I take a license to kill

Twenty eleven, This is the new era
From Shibuya, I take the powa

That's what we did, to fight for
One sound one team, came from the North
Faithful to ourselves, we will remain
Protect your chest, against our lyrics rain

Letâs drop a bomb!
Danger Danger
Oretatchi-a (wa) furyo da
This song is how I tell ya
Go fuck your mother!
I see one band, Iâve seen them all
when the Northstar rise, your poor band fall

And they set their defeats for better to complain
Thatâs not our style,
Look at the name of my gang

Come on guys it's time to rise
against this reign of negation, weâre not demise
So listen ! One, find ourself
and believe this heart beating in our chest

Here come the lords
Here comes the saiya
against your world
like a bomb on Hiroshima!
My vocal skills will throw you out of the ring
Sorry youâll never reach the world where iâm the king

That's what we did, to fight for
One sound one team, came from the North
Faithful to ourselves, we will remain
Protect your chest, against our lyrics rain

Remember the motto of my block,
Never forget, never bow, never give up!
