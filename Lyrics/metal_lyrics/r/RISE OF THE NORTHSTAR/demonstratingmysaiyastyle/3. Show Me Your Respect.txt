Let your cosmos burn!

Show me...
Your respect!

One day this guy called Destiny tried to catch me
And tore me away, but he slipped and made me stronger
Listen I never run away
Your god is useless to me,
I don't need him to move on.
I live as a free man, trying to run my life and fuck off destiny.

It's hard but learn to take,
Don't avoid, stay awake
And let your cosmos burn!
Burn!
Let your cosmos burn!

All days disturbed by punk who chose the weak's way..
Not for me.
I fight all the time against my nature...
Continually I try to tolerate you and do not judge who you are,
So, respect me and the way I live,
I chose the hard way.

It's hard but learn to take,
Don't avoid, stay awake
And let your cosmos burn!

Burn!
Let your cosmos burn

Represent!

Oh shit,
I dedicate this one for the pit.
For all the crazy hardcore kids,
Life is hard.
But you'd better be more.
Take your hate and your frustrations,
And spit 'em out on this shit,
Stay straight in your life true to yourself
Protect your crew,
No pity for your enemies
And the real aspect you'll get
And your cosmos you'll burn.

Let your cosmos...
Burn!
