Touch my eyes with yours
Find my hands with yours
I am still I'm not
Decayed and vanished I am
Still I'm not
Forever gathering the stones
From all his dark and shattered walls
The power of the unforgiving slave
He'll haunt you down unto the end
And fall down to the earth loosing
the grip I had
Reality so it remains
no one to follow
Forever to last memories gone
Still you will recognize
The eyes of the beast
Visit your dreams
and your cruel world
In following to the shining darkness
Striking coldness eats the pain
Conspired by the darkened angels
Trapped inside their broken sheilds
Fight to expire your dissolution soon you'll be the insane
and exerminated
Locked inside the cave
with only the shadows
Of a future you never will see
The Warrior's left
but the coward stays
Touch my eyes with youurs....
Find my hands with yours.....
Touch me!No use to fight this time
cause you shall...
Raise
Raise to fall
Fall to live in the shadows
You just pray
To your God
But the sins will forever be....
Yours!!
Right into the pieces
of your broken soul
With the laugher of the enemy
like sirens in your ears
A lullaby for the dying....
Bleeding little creatures right
before your eyes
Telling every little thought
That you're about to die
So..
Raise
Raise to fall
Fall to live in the shadows
You just pray
To your God
But the sins will forever be....
Yours!!
