Tied up in a rope of hate
Inside a world of no retreat
She begs the one to let her go
But it's too late
Clouds are passing right outside
As if today were still alive
But she just know this war's
Come to an end
Now that she knows
There's a reason for the pain
Will someone catch me if I fall?
All that she wants
Is to fight her own war
Will someone miss me if I die?
A millenium away
From all the things that made her feel alive
No turning back she's into deep
Inside the endless fight
To hide from all the faces making fear
She only wants to disappear
Into the secret cage
Where faces are the one she makes
Now that she knows
There's a reason for the pain
Will someone catch me if I fall?
What she wants
Is to fight her own war
Will someone miss me if I die?
When she dies.....
This final thrill within me
In terms of war I call for
This final thrill within me rising follow
In terms of war I call for treason
My time
Warm blood
In me
Fire burns me
Sweet death
Catch me
Into infinity
