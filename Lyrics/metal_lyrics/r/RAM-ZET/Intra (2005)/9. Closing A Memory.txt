My fire Devine
fit into your lies
And fly
Come Dvine
Wisdom unwise
Pieces entwine
What sis we find at
the end of the path?
Knowing only the cruel guides
the pitiable angel
As we walk side by side
in a castle of air
She's watching Devine
Reflecting a sign
And into
Your chamber Devine
Breath only for me
This time
Would it kill you to realize
what you have done
For the sake of a reason
tht no one could find
Would it hurt to admit that you
live in a dream
Could this ever end?
Could you really kill her?
Would you fall apart in spite
of what you
See in darkened dreams
Exterior imagination through your head
A conversation with the dead
Just a fantasy
Like a pure extension
And there's no one there to tell you
what went wrong
I'm a wide flood of fears
Wipes out all sense of time
Closing te memories of all
No longer I shall fear the end
I want to fight this
But it just hurts too much
Your face is in my mirror
so how can I hide?
I've have enough of this
I turn my back to pain
I want to stay here
And forever rest in peace
Taste my Devine
Fir into your lies
Our ashes will fly
Come Devine
Wisdom unwise
Pieces entwine
Nothing has changed
at the end of our path
KNowing only the cruel-
leads the way to our fall
And there's no long
antone lft by me
As the blind leads the blind
to his faith
But only to find he
remains unforgiven
so he turns but his
angel is already gone
Could you make her fall
Could you ever end her
Can she fall apart
in spite of what you
See in darkened dreams
Exterior imagination
through your head
A conversation with the dead
Far from the galaxy
No one can save her
Left outside a hole
In this life I feel no more remorse
I can not live or die
plase cut me down from your cross
I am not worthy of your tears
I want to fight this
But it just hurts too much
Your face is in my mirror
So how can I hide?
I held you off of me
I turn my back to pain
I want to stay here and
forever rest in peace
