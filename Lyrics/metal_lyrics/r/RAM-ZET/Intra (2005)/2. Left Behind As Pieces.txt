His arm reaches to hit the sun
In a crowd with no one
But it's painted on the wall
Next to all the naked bodies trailed by mist
Eating the forsaken puzzle
No sign of remorese just a vision to be broken
He's pleading eyes they haunt me
Trapped inside the faceless
My creation turns to ruins
Left behind as pieces
Watch me fall
Again I walk the lonely path
Within the crowds circle
The poisoned angel disappear
Promise kept still I can feel
the spineless fools surround me
And they feed my anger
Drawing flowers with my blood
Like a vision to be broken
He's pleading eyes they haunt me
Trapped inside the faceless
My creation turns to ruins
Left behind as pieces
Watch me fall
Watch me fall
