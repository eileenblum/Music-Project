Do you see a coward ocean
And do you see my broken crows
The happy clown will praise the devil
You pray alone as magic dies
Sacrifice the broken man
Be the power you command
Do you want a slice of madness
And do you want a different self
The attitude you bring ain't pretty
Still I just want a piece of you
I am sorrow
I am hate
I am anger
I am fear
Many had a little man
And he was always gruntig
And she tied him to a five-bar gate
And kicked his little head in
Do you need to hide the certain
Or do you need another way
The crap you bring and hide inside you
Just let it all poor out on me
