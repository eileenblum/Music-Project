Changing time as it came to pas
Hating you as you were tender, faith ful, beautiful
The brave would rise and I could feel again
Touch the spirits but they're corrupted, hateful, dreadful
Living in this cage made me fell alive
Anger beyond rage drove my soul tohte
POint of no return never looking back
Heading for the end now you need to
Take me to the void
Take me to the violence core
Lay le down
Dying for a soul
The loss you face cannot compare to mine
I would still try to be tender, faithful, beautiful
Now there's time and I will say goodbye,
I fall again as I'm corrupted, hateful, dreadful
Take me to the void
Take me to the violence core
Lay me down in soil
I'm dust anyway
This is my fight
This was my way
So was the sign
You were the sign
This is my fight
You were my way
It was a sign
You were the sign
There was nothing that I wouldn't hate for you
There was nobody I wouldn't slay for you
There was nothing that I wouldn't burn for you
There was nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Now you nothing and I will not hate for you
Now there's nobody I would still slay for you
Now you're nothing and I will not burn for you
there's just nothing that I wanna do for you
