Now is the time you should take me
Away from crowded heavens
Falling down, and nowhere will
i find the peace we've been searching.
Life is srtong, but you are tired
So week and tired so week..
Last times, say the lines for you get to go
While we still breath and still
And cry. I'd_ die for a cure that might save you
or take you to a better place.
Like fire better like fire
let me fade I'll cut myself away
Let me fade cut myself away
Let me fade for someone like you
Lean for the last time like in the dreams I
Lean into your soul and into your arms
Lean into my arms lean for the last time
Like in the dreams I lean into your soul
I feel so far away I am all alone
I feel so far away now I'am all alone
I feel so lost today so lost
I feel so far away now I'm all alone..
I feel so changed so barren, so cold
Without you I'm losing my ground
Before I break on, hear me now and lead me
To some place peaceful
Where death can reach my heart
And lead me
