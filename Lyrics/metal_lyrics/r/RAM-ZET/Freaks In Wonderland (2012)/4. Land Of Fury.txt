I chase but now it's nothing but desire
Running From my own reflexion just to feed the liar
I will cross the... land of fury
I will be the torn.. and guilty
Negligence is just another way to hurt the other
I will go thru all the space and time
To rome the glorious past alone
I am the guilty one
I am the core
To the endless end I search
To find the final path
I'm all and everything but nothing
In this world
I will cross the... land of fury
I will be the torn.. and guilty
Confidence is just another
Way to break the looser
Before the end it's all just hate you hold
Before the end you'll seek the endless cold
And I won't follow you into the void
And I won't guide you thru into the void
There's no return for you now
Into the void
I will cross the... land of fury
I will be the torn.. and guilty
Emptiness is not what I
Intended for my crime
