I'm inside you
I'm within your mind
all around you no peace

I feel him getting closer
nothing to do but wait
just a helpless spectator
as his personality changes
he's here now in my living nightmare
and he's chasing me
I can hear him breathe
I can hear his steps
but he's nowhere near me
and this mist is inside my head makes me personality change
I feel him this is his domain
and I loose my sense of time as faith turns into fear

Fear my being watch my power
hate my existence
hate me
hear my command
obey my word
follow my lead
cause you're all mine...

I keep watching movies in my head
this is madness
the same images over and over again
the pictures of him are repeated
clearer and clearer every time
there are voices in my head
why can't I remember?
he's behind the wheel
now driving me insane...

Fear my being
watch my power
hate my existence
hate me
hear my command
obey my word
follow my lead
cause you're all mine...

I keep watching movies in my head
this is madness
the same images over and over again
the pictures of him are repeated
clearer and clearer every time
there are voices in my head
why can't I remember?
he's behind the wheel
now driving me insane...

Fear my being
watch my power
hate my existence
hate me
hear my command
obey my word
follow my lead
cause you're all mine...

Fire into my eyes
the creatures run through my mind
a bullet right through your head
I tend to leave but I can't
it's to late...
you appear in my hell
you have to leave me or else you'll be me
