This silence never touched by noise and we're reaching out
I touch the dark spot of your heart
I bring peace...
Why do you bring me to this lake of sorrow
is this some kind of joke
you'd better speak in difference of all the preachers
I trust you
don't turn my faith into hate
this time I hear terrifying sounds around me
and your confusing words spinning 'round
preach me teach me
do your best to tease me
and I will make you bewail for good
I just want you to find some peace 
can't you hear the blackbirds prayer
In the woods of my fantasy all I want is to get some sleep
Thought you'd knew I'm your destiny
It's your life but it's me
deciding couldn't be much...
from this heart she will kill me...
I swear...she will...
This silence never touched by noise and we're reaching out
I touch the dark spot of your heart
I bring peace...
If this is path to eternal peace
I really wish she had brought me here
before and if she is the one
she claims to be
She's like an angel from above
to guide and protect me but as the fairy
you got fairytales how can you expect me
to trust you nurse me curse me
just never try to judge me cause the spell could be yours for good
I will find what you're looking for
I can guide and protect you
just like my dream of reality
How I wish...that it would come true
Now you'll see that we're aimed to be give me trust
I'll give you amity
don't you see it's my devils choice
he will be there and crave to decide
This silence never touched by noise and we're reeaching out
I touch the dark spot of your heart
I bring peace...
