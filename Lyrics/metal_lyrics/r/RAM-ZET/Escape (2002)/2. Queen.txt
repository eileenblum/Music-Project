Where did she take me
can't see a thing here
I try to move but my body doesn't conform me

Just tyr to rest soon we'll start our journey
then why am I looked up in this cage
now someone opens up the door
I think I've seen this face before 
or is this just a fantasy
but in the moment of a blow I see his last journey
then someone other's in control
why did you kill him
his blood is on my hands to I did not want this...failure...
I want to free you from all your soreness
It is to late 'cause I am dead

I'm the queen for one day
I'm the queen for one night

I'm the queen of your fate
I will teach you to scream for silence
Stop what you're doing
it's far to late to rescue me and you
ought to know cause you're the ""healer

Just give me time and I'll give you freedom
you claim my freedom but I'm trapped 
so now you want to set me free
still I'm the one that should not be
I really should just fade away and what you're doing
makes no sense cause
I'm lost forever don't try to guide me to utopia
white plastic gloves removing my blanket
and then she tells me
we shall go

I'm the queen for one day
I'm the queen for one night
I'm the queen of your fate
I will teace you to scream for silence
