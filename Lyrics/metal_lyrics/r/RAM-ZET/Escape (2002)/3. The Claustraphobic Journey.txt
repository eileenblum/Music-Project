Drowning in my emptiness
Love is no subject if my hate isn't there
Strangled by the curse of loneliness
pleasure's no subject if pain is not there

I'll take your hand and I will help you fight
your bedevilled mind come to my peaceful island...
cry...into deep suffocation...
I want to breathe but my throat has disappeared
I claim to be sane that this is just another dream
but the beast inside my head keeps sending pictures of you dead...
We're on the train of no return no absconding
don't turn your head don't look around
We have to reach the other side
no compunction because of all the thing's I've done
don't you try to fool me
you think that I'm mad
but I'm not all your stupid stories
I'll never trust you what you got
Catch me kill me help me free me fear me avoid me
Please don't listen to my oath
all these familiar faces it's like
I've been here before
Eyes glance at me before they turn around
at first they seemed so nice
smiling at me but I know better now
I'll never get away alive

We're on the train of no return
no absconding
don't turn your head
don't look aroun
we have to reach the other side
no compunction because of all the thing's I've done
don't you try to fool me
you think that I'm mad but I'm not all your stupid storis
I'll never trust you what you got
catch me kill me help me free me fear me avoid me
please don't listen to my oath
all these familiar faces it's like
I've been here before
eyes glance at me before they turn around
at first they seemed so nice
smiling at me but I know better now
I'll never get away alive

We're on the train of no return
no absconding don't turn your head
don't look around
we have to reach the other side
no compunction because of all the thing's I've done
don't you try to fool me
