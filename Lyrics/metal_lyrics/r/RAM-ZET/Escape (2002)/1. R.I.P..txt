This dream about her eyes makes me cry...
Night after night...
I can't take this much longer 
I need her empathy
I need her to be around me...
Hasn't been here for a while now where is she probably she's left for good...
I want to kill someone...
I'm fighting
These white walls all by myself....
or maybe...hello?...hello??

I'm here now...
Darkness surrounding my heart thought's are floating 
why did you give me this shot
I really thought you were my friend

Don't talk just listen to my voice
The air around me is so damn blurry seems like a veil of mist
This maze confuses me so tell me where we are and why

Don't talk just listen to my voice
Poison run through my veins makes me loose my mind
Sinking into deep trapped by mortal love this time

I'll set you free 
I'll give you dreams
I can make you feel this eternal peace in your soul
try to "rest in peace"

Now I hear theur voices whisper stories about my death 
still I am not that certain if I'm dead or just asleep

Don't talk just listen to my voice
Falling into an abyss sensing that I'm being moved
probably it's the final journey
maybe I can rest in...peace?

Don't talk just listen to my voice
I'll set you free
I'll give you dreams
I can make you feel this eternal peace in your soul
try to "rest in peace"
