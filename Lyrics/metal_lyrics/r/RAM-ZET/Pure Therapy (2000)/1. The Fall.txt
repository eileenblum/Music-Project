You've got your self
Into this
Into this
Into this bad excuse of a life
I don't now
I don't now
Don't know how

I don't want this it feels like a conspiracy
Blinded just like a
Light of day
I just hate it
I despise it
All I want is to leave

My god why
Have you left me
Talk to the one
Who hurts me
Who betrays me
I deserve my revenge

My god why
Have you left me
All I want is to be the same again
My god you just don't please me
All I need is the time to comprehend

You've got your self
Into this
Into this
Into this bad excuse of a life
I don't now
I don't now
Don't know how

This is the end now it's your time to
Suffer
The endless scream of
Anger
Corruption
Destruction
This is your death
