Last dawn be...
It just felt like be already knew
She killed him with all her senses
He was ready to fall

She wanted this what so ever
So attracted to all the pain
She hoped it could last forever
Now there was only one thing left

This is the end of their journey

I'll keep your soul in my mind
Your blood in my veins
Your faith in my hand

So don't be afraid my little angel
You're protected for the rest of this life
Soon you will be clear to see
There will be no regrets

Speak up to the dead they won't hurt us
This is just my eternal voice
Predicting for you to see
That you're willing to die for me

This is the end of their journey

I'll keep your soul in my mind
Your blood in my veins
Your faith in my hand
