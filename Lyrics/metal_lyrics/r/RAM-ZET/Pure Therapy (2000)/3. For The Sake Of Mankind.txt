Contention
In a shape of you is despair
I will follow everywhere you go
And break the spell

And just
for the sake of any kind of mankind
You will have to bleed
And bring yourself to rest

In search for something different
Magnificent
Almost like a lie

Introduction
Behalf of the atmosphere
You will follow 'till the end of dark
And touch the light

And just
For the course of honesty
All the stories but your grieve
Is suddenly brought to you

Is somewhere someone innocent
Intelligent
No use to try

You'd better bring me down
To find a reason for this pain
You'd better bring me down
I'm not that stupid
Dejection

But no one has to know
Cause you're the one to bear this load
And stand the mockery

And just
For the sake of all this kind of mankind
Now it's time to bleed
You've brought you're self to rest

In search for something different
Magnificent
Almost like a lie

You'd better bring me down
To find a reason for this pain
You'd better bring me down
I'm not that stupid

Far beyond the seeds of this reality
They could see the little one
And he was trying but no one knew why
They just discovered the fear in his eyes
And the new it was eternal
And because he'd been refused the gift of felling hate
He turned his anger into sorrow
And decided that no one could ever talk to him again

You'd better bring me down
To find a reason for this pain
You'd better bring me down
I'm not that stupid
