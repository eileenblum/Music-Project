Don't resist me
I despise all the critical behaviour
All I grudge is your pain
So suffer...

I'll kill your wishes and your future
Believe
Sending all your thoughts...
Total...

Now you're worchless
You're useless

Kill my thoughts
And feel the innocence
It runs through your blood
Kill my thoughts
Protecting your own life
The only one you know

I'm the master
Of eternal collapse and insanity

You're bound to be the victim till the
End at this point
There's no use in begging
I'm superior to all

Now you're worchless
You're useless

Kill my thoughts
And feel the innocence
It runs through your blood
Kill my thoughts
Protecting your own life
The only one you know
