I'm inside you
I'm within your mind
All around you
No peace

To terminated
I reclibe you I rebuild you
I decide your breath
Better believe me
Exterminated
Without tension without motion
I will never free you
Don't you hesitate me

In suffer you will resist me
It's your pain you'll never regain me

Participated
I deny to even help you
I won't ever be there
Always behind you
Inside my hatred
I won't let you I forget you
You're afraid to admit
Your primal fear

In suffer you will resist me
It's your pain you'll never regain me

I'm your secret dream and all your
Wishes will come true
I'm your guardian angels
I'll stay with you

I'm your secret dream and all your
Wishes will come true
I'm your guardian angels
I'll stay with you

I'm inside you
I'm within your mind
All around you
No peace

Don't try again to
Be a victim cause you choose this
Up too you too decide
Always the leader
It's far to late to
Be so sorry cry to worry
You don't even admit
That in your entite faules
