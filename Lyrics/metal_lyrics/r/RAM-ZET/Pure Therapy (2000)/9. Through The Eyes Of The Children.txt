Yesterday you killed me
Today I'm only a moment away
You can never escape this
Can't annihilate what you never can see

This is no dream
It is for real
He rules your life

Now that the sound of tranquillity
The silence roars so load in your head
Never again you can sleep
Cause the fear is only a second away

This is no dream
It is for real
He rules your life

Create it all in your mind
This thought will hurt you
Like poison it runs through your senses
And beyond

The story has to end to the point
Although it feels like deception
Consider it's the end of this world
You can determine it's destiny

This is no dream
It is for real
He rules your life

Create it all in your mind
This thought will hurt you
Like poison it runs through your senses
And beyond

It's time to cry to choose
Which side you belong to
Cause soon you'll stand there
All by yourself
The king won't help
Ashes you obey him

Into the deepest cage
He want to make you smell the fear
And you will stay there forever

I cry though the eyes of the children
I scream beyond the souls of the dead
I cry and once again I obey them
I scream upon the God that you fear

Corruption all the sees is destruction
There's no one to tell him
What to be done
Belief is lost and buried forever
It's to late to tell the stories you told

Into the deepest cage
He want to make you smell the fear
And you will stay there forever

I cry though the eyes of the children
I scream beyond the souls of the dead
I cry and once again I obey them
I scream upon the God that you fear
