How can you leave me like this
I can not live or die
I'm in a state of no mind
And all the fear all the pain
Won't ever fade away
It kills me time after time

I connect with your lord answering questions
With my power
Constantly we will try to tear you apart
Destroy
Now just resting so deep back in your real life
No one worries
Then we'll make a transaction don't you believe
In fear

Over and over this dream is all the same
No one to turn to anymore

Now I'm the king for one day
King for one night
King of your faith
It's my world
World for one day
World for one night
World of my faith

You can call this a game but it turns you to peaces
Nothing matter
The state of the mind is defenceless nothing to do
It's useless
Now you want to go home rest in peace
You thought you had
But no one seems to agree with this anymore
It's bound to end

Over and over this dream is all the same
No one to turn to anymore

Now I'm the king for one day
King for one night
King of your faith
It's my world
World for one day
World for one night
World of my faith

How can you leave me like this
I can not live or die
I'm in a state of no mind
And all the fear all the pain
Won't ever fade away
It kills me time after time
