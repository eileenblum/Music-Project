This is the end,
voices calls me.
Now they're so close.
Walk through the dark,
still I linger.
People I craved cursed me.

I'm facing the facts, trust in my wisdom, join my invisible kingdom.
Truth, this is the truth, burn all the bridges, there's no forgiveness

Farewell, you troubled one. I won't return.
Where I am all good things die.

Cursed by your masters deception the source to all your regression.
Restrain your empathy.
Regain your dignity, your true identity.

My weakness may last for a moment or two,
but watch as I rise from your ashes.

Don't make me see, don't make me hear, don't make me feel, don't make me breath.
Don't make me live once again, just to experience tragedy, decay and limitation.
I'm torn apart now.
I'm torn apart now

Be quiet don't make a sound
as it pours out.
Be quiet don't make a sound.
Virtue pours out.

My old weakness may last for a moment or two,
but watch as I rise from your ashes.

This is the end,
voices calls me.
Now they're so close.
Walk through the dark.
We will find you.
Now you're so close.

They cursed me to ashes.
They cursed me
They're so close.
To ashes...
