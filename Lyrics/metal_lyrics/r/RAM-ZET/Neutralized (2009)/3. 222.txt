Enter my world.
Forget your will.
I'm the victim within this shame of ours.
Conquered, broken
you steal my bones.
You unleash hell
piercing my soul with hatred.
Come on! Fight me!
Destroy myself.
Wicked wonder,
this blade will sure betray you.

Dead within a second from the flash that hit your heart.
The darkness that surrounds you, it's a life beneath your bleeding soul.
The curse for filled, your hope is crushed
by the glory of the unholy brought to you by God, so

scream, cause nothing ever last and no one ever stays,
like all you touch will disappear.
Pain is all that you will find when thoughts of life is worse than death,
and so you wish to end it all,
to end it all this one last time.

Come again cadaverous souls,
unchain your bitter unforgiving hold.
Now I'm all that's left of you.

So learn, that nothing ever heals unless the gone once reappear
and when they want to end you,
to end your life this one last time.

Enter my world.
Forget your will.
You're the victim within this shame of ours
Conquered, broken
I steal your bones.
I unleash hell
piercing your soul with hatred.
Come on! Fight me!
Destroy yourself.
Wicked wonder,
this blade will sure betray me
