This is my requiem.
All that was left me is found when I can't hear them.
Sing my last anthem.

Catching up with all my old conspirators.
Crossing the bridge to the other side.
Searching all that's forbidden, forsaken and forgotten.
Posting my thoughts to invincible enemies.
Lethal information brought to life.
Now, this oath will bring me to the final rest

Flow

In what remains I deny to stay, this path is no longer mine.
I shout to scare the hunting shadows within my mind.
Never to trust the ones who will be trusted,
better believe that you're better off dead.
There's no cure for eternal diseases.
Rest in peace, now..

Tell me secrets and the broken wishes.
Your requiem whispers "You are but a dream"

So, here is the end of me, the end of all forgiveness.
Your voice is calling "I am but a dream"

Flow

Seek and you shall find what was lost inside,
All your bridges burned to ashes.
Pictures turn to grey in your mind.
All that's left in me will be sacrificed.

This is my requiem.
All that was left me is found when I can't hear them.
Sing my last anthem.

Flow

So, here is the end of me the end of all forgiveness
Your voice is calling "I am but a dream"

This is my...
Requiem
