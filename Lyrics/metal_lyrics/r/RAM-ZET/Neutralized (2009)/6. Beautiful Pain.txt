Stars like white moth cluster at the dark windowpanes of heaven.
Yet, a marginal hope for grace sweeps over her grieving eyes.
Quiet as birds at night she sings to the stones, with ashen wings and hidden thoughts.

If they tell you there's lack of evidence
look the other way.
Charge and they will play this game
and feel the unavoidable shame,
resting their case and fade away.
Fade away, they're gone, they're gone.
Gaze upon your heavily bleeding sky,
certain that your shadow passes by
the lost ones howling jealously
rejecting destiny and float away.
They float away, and drown, they drown.

Better to be bigger than to climb the only ladder to your private heaven,
suddenly reminding all your enemies about the revolution.
Guiltiness will never kill the beauty of your constitution,
greater than ever before.

Losing what's left of my faith.
Crying out into the haze.
See me don't lead me astray.
You're still my beautiful pain.

Hail to the people who encourage themselves to walk the thin red line.
It's just a pity that their life is a waste before they disappear.
Hail to the promises given to be broken.
Wave goodbye to your guardian angel and remember her smile.
Before you die , time to die
Before you die , time to die

Suddenly we face our own mortality and the future's growling fast inside us.
Facing all the facts of our reality, we want to find a new solution.
Happiness will never show Its beauty cause It's based on our imagination.
Greater than ever before
this silence in your brain,
like poison through your veins,
accept it won't remain. It's the end

Losing what's left of my faith.
Crying out into the haze.
See me don't lead me astray.
You're still my beautiful pain.
Nothing's left of my faith.
Crying out into the haze.
See me don't lead me astray.
You're still my beautiful pain.
