Hide the shame because
It's invisible to anyone
who'd ever care to have an opinion.
Forget the clangor in the last fair game
It doesn't make a difference anyway.
Keep it buried, keep it hidden,
keep it locked up and forbidden.
Never speak, never whisper,
never tell that we're forgiven.
And soon we'll see the light.

Scared and blind I drift around in your care.
You keep holding me close and I just need to endure your cold lies.
These thoughts won't let me go.
Take me down to anger and blame.
Fake your life and all you get is despair.
All beauty will fade. It all withers and dies.

Please, join the party in my nice little dungeon.
I serve sweet toxic cookies and some blood from my friends.
Ecstatic, fanatic an addict to all that you wanted to
dominate, create ruins of failure.
Addict, fanatic, ecstatic about all that you wanted to create, dominate.
No time for mercy.

Share the shame because now it's visible to anyone.
And if they want to have an opinion
they'll be the losers in the last fair game.
And you don't feel the difference anyway.
Then they're buried, then they're hidden,
all the thoughts that was forbidden.
Free to speak, free to shout,
free to feel that you're forgiven.
And then turn out the light.

Fake your life and all you get is despair.
Beauty will fade. It all withers and dies.
Scared and blind I drift around in your care.
You keep holding me close and I just need to endure.

Please, join the party in my nice little dungeon.
I serve sweet toxic cookies and some blood from my friends.
Ecstatic, fanatic an addict to all that you wanted to dominate, create ruins of failure.
Addict, fanatic , ecstatic about all that you wanted to create, dominate.
No time for mercy.
