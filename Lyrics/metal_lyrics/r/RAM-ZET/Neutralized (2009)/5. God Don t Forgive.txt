Slowly drifting away in the river of shame
with the conscience of Judas and no one to blame.
Suddenly, as we spoke, the preacher approached
with an attitude brought pretty far from above.
"Diabolical tonight?" he said, smiling contentious to his terrified congregation.
With fear in their eyes they knew 'bout his vision and his vicious intentions.
Fearing that life soon would belong in the past.

Don't take this pain from me, leave me to crawl.
Tear me apart and steal all the pieces.
Tell me to follow the cold that lives
in the heart I once loved.

You, you are dead
won't be found.
You will walk through the gates of eternity.
Pray for them all,
but the Gods won't forgive you for all that you've done.

They march along with all good intentions.
Side by side, against the superior force.
Caught in between the saints and the sinners, losers and winners.
But who can we trust to draw the line
with a deadly precision to separate those who shall live,
and those who shall die.
We believe in the invisible wizard one last time.

Don't take this pain from me, leave me to crawl.
Tear me apart and steal all the pieces.
Tell me to follow the cold that lives
in the heart I once loved.

You, you are dead
Won't be found.
You will walk through the gates of eternity.
Pray for them all,
but the Gods won't forgive you for what you have done.
