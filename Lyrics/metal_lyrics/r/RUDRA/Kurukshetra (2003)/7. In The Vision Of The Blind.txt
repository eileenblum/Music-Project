You hope to see diamonds and roses in a paradise filled with pleasure
You hope to meet God in the hereafter pouring wine into your goblet of greed

Once virigns but now corrupted
Whores you are now at the harem of untruth
Without flesh and bones you seek to gratify your senses?
Irrational and absurd!!!!!

Slavery to the preying whore
Your sanity scarificed at the scared altar
Must they forefit their sanity for the promise of paradise?

The blind fail to see it but the wise ones never miss it
The impermanence of pleasure eludes their minds
Fools they are, and they never learn!

Slavery to the preying whore
Your sanity scarificed at the scared altar
Must they forefit their sanity for the promise of paradise?
