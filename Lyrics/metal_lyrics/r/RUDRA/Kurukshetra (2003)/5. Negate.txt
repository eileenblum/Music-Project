Enemies alone I see see in this battlefield
Executing &amp; eradicating souls of black
Rightful confrontation to negate adhyasa
Self induced psychosis, Negated ruthlessly

Neither hatred nor disgust impels us
To destroy these unworthy hopeless minds
Destructions of Dogmas, End of neurosis
Remove the veils of avidya
Negate the darkness within

Die!!

Victims of ruthless negation
Your ashes shall adorn our foreheads as a sign of Victory!!!!!
You have the right to believe but I have the power to dismiss!!
Satyameva Jayate!
