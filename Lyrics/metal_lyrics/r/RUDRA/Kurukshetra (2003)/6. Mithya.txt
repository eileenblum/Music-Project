All subtle, gross and casual realities have no independent existence
Bound by Time, space and the laws of causation.
No more eternal pleasures in heaven or eternal dammnation
Even the God tha rests in Heaven has an end! Mithya!!!

That which depends on another for its existence is an illusion
Creation is like the mirage in the desert sky
A God within space is subject to negation
With a mere word I destroy your God! Mithya!!!

"Of the unreal there is no being; the real has no nonexistence.
But the nature of both these, indeed, has been realized by the seers of Truth" *

Welcome to the funeral of duality
Welcome to the funeral of the creator God

All is Maya
All is Mithya
All has an end except the I

[Bhagavad Gita 2:17]
