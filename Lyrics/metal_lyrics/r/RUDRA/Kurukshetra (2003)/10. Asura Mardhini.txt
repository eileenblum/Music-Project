Daughter of the Mountain, Rise again, destroy the asuras
Daughter of the Ocean, Rise again, destroy our enemies

Consort of blue necked One, Rise again, and split the heads of the ugly ones
Mother of the world, Rise again, and dance gracefully on the battlefield of blood

Shredding fantasies to pieces and killing demons of pride and arrogance
Obliterating the charlatans who speak on behalf of the deluded one up in the skies

One who is like the blazing Sun, do not rest till the drama of life ends
O' Victorious one, do not end your dance you have begun!
