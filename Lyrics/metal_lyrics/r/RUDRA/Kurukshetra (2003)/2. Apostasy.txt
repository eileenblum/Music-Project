What is there salvage!!!
A myth invented for fools proclaim
That I am a sinner who needs salavation
And there comes a creed to save me
When will be your judgement day?
Shall I see the face of your God?
A sadistic eunuch sitting in another dimension!
He doesn't save! He enslaves!

He sits on a throne and plays a game
For he is but a mortal man!!!

My contempt for salvation knows no bounds
It is a golden lasso around my neck!
No paradise can tempt me!!!
I know them all to be Mithya!!!
Apostasy is my creed
I am an apostate of untruth!!!
The masses may reject me for I don't belong to the majority

For blinding darkness I have come
To the dawn of new initation

Misery, sorrow, Deceit, false glory
Lies, Guilt, Pain have all I have seen

Let the new Dawn illuminate my innate glory
Ever pure and ever free I am
