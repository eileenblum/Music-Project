In great heights my mind soars to the indescribable
Vairagya in the form of Saffron robes all around mr

Hara Hara Shankara, Jaya Jaya Shankara
Chanting the Sruti on the banks of Ganja
In the stillness of the Brahma Muhurta
Drums, bells and conch wake the soul to rise
Ambience filled with vibrations of mother Sruti

With offering of flowers and incense to the Swayambhu Linga
Amidst me saffron robes, saffron flags and saffron truth

Fly Fly Saffron Fly
Fly Saffron Fly
Highter and higher

Teaching begins as the sun rises, Mumukshus whereever I see
Mahavakyas analyzed to see the truth within

Hara Hara Shankara, Jaya Jaya Shankara
An image of Shankara with his four hangs on the wall
Ganga flows from one mind to another..... Jai Jnana Ganga
