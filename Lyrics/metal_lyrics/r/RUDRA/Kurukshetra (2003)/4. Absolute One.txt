One alone exists without a second
All that's objectified is an appearance,
This fire of knowledge still burns
This fire of knowledge destroys the misapprenhension
Caused by superimposition

Absolute One! Even the Fire shines after That.
Tat Tvam Asi

Self-shining and indescribable
When words limit and traits negate
Words yet employed to reveal the One,
Sought by the initiated with minds that are uninhibited
Dissolving all notions that are limited

Revealed by the four, In their fourth quarters,
Being the last instrument among the six,
To the one endowed with the four.

Non dually one, Limitless Eternal Consciousness,
Not subject to time, space and causation
Eternally free but seemingly bound

Absolute One! Even the Sun shines after That
Tat Tvam Asi
