Chaotic confusion in the house of emptiness
Congregation of navie believers
Believers remain as believers of time honoured dogmas
Without knowing what lies beyond their convictions

The curse of religion incapacitates their objectivity
Hiding behind God's words to absolve their guilt and hide their naivete

Indoctrinated right from birth to value one's inability to think
From cradle to the grave they live in childish fantasies

Arise &amp; Awake! From this slumber of delusion

In the Temple of Emptiness I hear a melody
A wailing melody from despondent souls
The silent melancholy seated in their hearts
Ignoring their sufferrng for the fear of persecution
