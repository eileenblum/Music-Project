Arise and Fight! Fight till Death!
Retreat is disgrace, now raise your sword!!
Army of Rajas invade! Destroy the tasmasic hordes
Offense is the strategy, Attack insanity
This war is inevitable for the noble ones
Mind battling mind, sublating what is false!

This path may be painful. Yet you must do what is right
Slaughter Mercilessly! 'Cause this is Dharmayuddha

This is agression of the worst kind
Justified Self-infliction
Slaughter, Kill, Rape, every thought of duality
A rentless crusade to grasp the Endless

This path may be painful. Yet you must do what is right
Slaughter Mercilessly! 'Cause this is Dharmayuddha

I am the battlefield. I am the slayer and the slain.
And yet I am not any of it. This war is real yet unreal!
