Pathetic display of unjustified aggression
Killing of mortals in the name of religion
You kill your other self and you think it's God's will
Not knowing that you've been victimized by your false ego

Instead of fighting on the battlefields
Wage the war on the mental plane

Your mind is now misleading you
Enslaved in a cell of dogmatism

[Solo: Alvin]

You call him Father, but are you a worthy child?
If He is so merciful, why are you so merciless?

All apparent dissension and conflicts will fade
into obscurity when you see the Unity behind this Diversity
With whom can you fight, if there's only One
Contemplate!

Wage the war on the mental plane
Kill the ego, which breeds ignorance

Seek Shanti, Abide in Shanti
Om Shanti Shanti Shanti
