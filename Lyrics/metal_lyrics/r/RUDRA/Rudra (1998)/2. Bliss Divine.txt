The Soul of the Universe,
I bow to thee
The one Existence,
I bow to thee

It is never born
It never dies
One without a second
It is Bliss Divine

[Solo: Bala]

Permeating the whole Universe but whom nothing can permeate
Supreme and self-existent
The changeless behind the changing

Beyond, there is nothing
Yet it is everything
That is the Absolute, That thou art
It is Indivisible, Eternal, Immutable, Sat-chit-ananda

Nameless, Formless, Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent,
This Almighty Brahman

[Solo: Bala]

Om Tat Sat
Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti

[Solo: Alvin]

The Pure Consciousness
I bow to thee
The ever-blissful
Let me merge with you!

It is never born
It never dies
One without a second
It is Bliss Divine
