I prostrate myself before the Parabrahman,
the Supreme One, and to all its manifestations
I bow with reverence to the Shrutis and to the Maharishis
I bow to the Satgurus and to the avatars
I bow to the gurus who have captured my soul
I bow to the many in the One

Om Bhur Bhuvah Suvah
Tat Savitur Varenyam
Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi
Dhiyo Yonah Pracodayat

Destroy the Ahamkara in me
Remove the avidya in me
Stimulate my buddhi and let lofty thoughts arise
Dissolve my individuality in the sea of Brahmavidya

Atmajnana is what I seek
Unveil my pristine self
Bestow your grace upon me
And guide me to your royal chamber

Let me see you in both darkness and light
Let the sword of bliss pierce through this Kosha
Let this flesh turn to dust and
let my mind still reverberate your nama

I prostrate myself before the Parabrahman,
the Supreme One, and to all its manifestations
I bow with reverence to the Shrutis and to the Maharishis
I bow to the Satgurus and to the avatars
I bow to the gurus who have captured my soul
I bow to the many in the One
