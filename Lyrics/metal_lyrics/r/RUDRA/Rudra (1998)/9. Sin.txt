Mind your conditioned mind, which you use to judge one.
Conditioned by your own ideals, you denounce the ones who differ
A sinner or a saint, to be judged not by you but by a perfect one
You commit the great sin by calling one a sinner

Heartless and mindless, you judge, disparage and ridicule
The duplicity of your unbounded love is now revealed
A mindless heart and a heartless mind are of no use
Let me ask you now, who is the sinner?

[Solo: Burhan]

Are you talking about God's plan or is it your plan for God
Like you know it all, you say what's right and what's wrong
Your arrogance and ignorance prove that you are an empty shell
I can hear the echoes of the mutilated truths from within your mind

Quick to judge, slow to think, absence of the intellect
You denigrate, patronise, desecrate and chastise
Your own ideals should be your judge and you the judged
Have you heard this line before: "Judge not, that ye be not judged"

Heartless and mindless! you judge, disparage and ridicule
The duplicity of your unbounded love is now revealed
A mindless heart and a heartless mind are of no use
Let me ask you now, who is to repent
