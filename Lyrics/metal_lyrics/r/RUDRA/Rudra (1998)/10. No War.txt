An eye for an eye
Till you lose your eyes
Violence begets violence
You start and it never ends
The weak can't resist the urge to retaliate
The strong shall endure the pain with repose

Peace! No War

You want to conquer the world
But not yourself
What have you gained when the one
Closest to you is far away

Coward! Accept the fact
Weakness is your god
The reins are cut asunder
And watch your senses flee
Your mind has no control
Over your worst enemy
End up being a slave
To your own inadequacy

Immense power without aggression
Slowly consuming without engagement
Conquering without bloodshed
With the right mindset
