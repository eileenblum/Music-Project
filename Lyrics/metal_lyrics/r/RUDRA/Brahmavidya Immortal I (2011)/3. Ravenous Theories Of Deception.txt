Perception and inference are your gods
Observation is your ritual
You are a believer after all with faith in your deductions

Your pramanas are limited
What you don't know, you'll never know until you discover that ignorance is bliss!

Shrotrasya shrotram manaso manah
Vaco vacam pranasya pranah chakshushashchakshuh

Pratibodhaviditam matam*

[Solo devan vinod]

Your pramanas are limited
What you don't know, You'll never know until you know that
The assumed colour of the crystal is not its true nature

Shrotrasya shrotram manaso manah
Vaco vacam pranasya pranah chakshushashchakshuh

Pratibodhaviditam matam*

[*Kena Upanishad]
