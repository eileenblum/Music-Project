You see divinity in the other but not seeing it within oneself
The art of love deceives the heart which knows no reason

What is within cannot be sought through another body
Fools believe that maithuna leads to Brahman

You are not the body that you depend on
You are like a lotus leaf that's untouched by water

Naham prana

Naham Kama

Deluded by pleasures
Obsessed with sensations
Addicted to ecstasy
Love hides your inadequacy

[Solo devan]
