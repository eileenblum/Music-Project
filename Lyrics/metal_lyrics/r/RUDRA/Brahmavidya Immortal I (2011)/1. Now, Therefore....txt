Now, therefore, the enquiry into Brahman leads to the Immortal Self
It is a reasoning of a different kind not divorced from shruti and anubhava

Discriminate between the rope and the snake
Shun the impermanent
Invigorate the Antahkarana
Yearn to be Free!

Athato brahmajijnasa janmadyasya yatah
Shastrayonittvat tattusamanvayat*

Nityanityavastu viveka
Iccharahityam
Shatkasampatti
Mumukshutvam

[Solo devan vinod]

Athato brahmajijnasa janmadyasya yatah
Shastrayonittvat tattusamanvayat

[*Brahma Sutras]
