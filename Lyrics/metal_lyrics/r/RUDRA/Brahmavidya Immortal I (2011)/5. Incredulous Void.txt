[Solo devan]

It is a reasoning of a different kind not divorced from shruti and anubhava
There is a supposed truth which leads you to nothingness
They whisper mantras but leads you to shunya
They cry that all is pain
They die just like all of us in vain
Kshanikavada Chedanam
Om brahmane namah

Reality can't be like the son of a barren woman 'cause I perceive it
Their dry logic based on perception obstructs what lies beyond
Why, must they deny that I am immortal!
Shunyavada Chedanam
Om brahmane namah
Vijnanavada Chedanam
Om brahmane namah

[Solo devan]
