Not knowing that the way out is the way in
Thousands of fools worship the feet of the scornful ones

The key to freedom is in his pocket yet he claims that you are free
He claims divinity but utters 'your are divine'

Unquestioning faith is glorified
What a holy deception

Sarvashruti shiroratna virajitapadambujah
Vedantambuja suryoyah tasmai shri surave namah*

[Solo devan vinod]

Acaryavan purushoveda**

The acarya points out your innate freedom like pointing out the arundhati

The one who sees non-duality as his essence
And he who sees no second reality is a satguru

For he has to be a Shrotriya and a brahmanishtha

Sarvashruti shiroratna virajitapadambujah
Vedantambuja suryoyah tasmai shri surave namah

[*Skanda Purana]
[**Taittiriya Upanishad]
