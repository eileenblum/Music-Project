There is no other, no second thing when I am the only reality
The universe, known and unknown, is a manifestation of Brahman
That reality revealed by the Shruti and echoed by the Smrti
Confirmed by my self experience, beyond disputations

Like the One Sun,
But many reflections,
I am that one Light

In my vision there is only I, that which is the parabrahman
There is no experience other than the Self
What can displace the vision that conforms to the sole Existence!
What can negate that which is self-established!

[Solo vinod devan]

I am the Light of Lights, I am the God of Gods
I am the very satyam on which the universe rests
In me you exist. In reality you don't exist at all
I lend my existence to this world phenomenon
