Where is your saviour now?
Is he up in the skies?
Are you a seeker?
Are you a believer?

Seeking salvation when you are already Free is like a wave wanting to be water!

[Solo devan]

I am that God in Truth
Everything else is Mithya
There is no formless God
That resides in Paradise
There is no holy Book
All are but Lies!

Nothing compares to the Self
The Self that witnesses the Universe

[Solo devan vinod]

There is only the Self Supreme
Which is eternal
Which is Absolute and That I am
Nothing compares to the Self
The Self that witnesses the Universe

I am the God in Truth
Everything else is Mithya
