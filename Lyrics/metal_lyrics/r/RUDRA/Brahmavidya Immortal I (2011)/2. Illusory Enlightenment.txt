A non-dual experience is but a sleep in disguise
What can be learned from such a state of ignorance
Stretching your limbs and mind, is karma indeed
Will these actions lead you to freedom?

And action is limited by nature, how that can confer freedom?
It is the mind that is the seat of avidya
It is knowledge alone that's needed, when you mistake the nacre for silver
When will these foolish deeds end?

Notpadyate vinajnanam vicharenanyasadhanai
Yatha padarthabhanam hi prakashena vinakvacit*
The Self is immortal by nature, can't be gained by action
Attaining the Self is accomplishing the accomplished
Notpadyate vinajnanam vicharenanyasadhanai
Yatha padarthabhanam hi prakashena vinakvacit

[Solo devan]

Notpadyate vinajnanam vicharenanyasadhanai
Yatha padarthabhanam hi prakashena vinakvacit
The Self is immortal by nature, can't be gained by action
Attaining the Self is accomplishing the accomplished

[*Aparokshanubhuti]
