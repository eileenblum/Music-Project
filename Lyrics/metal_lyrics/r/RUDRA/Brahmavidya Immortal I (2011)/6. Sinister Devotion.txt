The one who sees a worshipful form in the form of a lord without
And he worships, sings and dances to enjoy bliss within

His love enduring, his faith consuming the potential of freedom
Bound by love, dependent on faith and mistaken freedom

Taste the nectar within, not the water of this mirage
That which appears as far without, is within

There is no lord in the Universe other than the Atma
In bhakti there is no atmatrpti, Parabhakti is indeed Atma anubhava

There is no Lord in the Universe other than the Atma

[Solo devan vinod]

Yas tvatma rattirevasyat atmatrptashcamanava
Atmanyeva ca santushtah tasya karyam na vidyate*

Taste the nectar within, not the water of this mirage
That which appears as far without, is within

There is no lord in the Universe other than the Atma
In bhakti there is no atmatrpti, Parabhakti is indeed Atma anubhava

[*Bhagavad Gita]
