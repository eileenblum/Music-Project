Hara Hara Shankara Shiva Shiva Shankara [x4]

Ishwaro Gururatmeti
Murti bheda Vibhagine
Vyomavad vyapta dehaya
Dakshinamurataye namah

Renouncing the pleasures of thousand heaves
Destroying the absurd believes of the Lost
Having gained the wealth that can be robbed
Let the shruti be heard from a Guru
This pathless path where the Unknowable is known
Frees oneself from the tyranny of inadequacy
The Freedom gained is Limitation removed
The Knowledge gained is ignorance removed

"It is known to him to whom it is unknown;
he to whom it is known does not know it.
It is unknown to those who know,
and known to those who know not."

Not knowing this I die
Not knowing this I am born
Not knowing this I strive
Knowing this I become Immortal

There is no difference between Jiva, Gagat &amp; Ishwara
There is no difference between Ishwara, Guru &amp; Atma

Atma Satyam Jaganmithya [x4]

Ishwaro Gururatmeti
Murti bheda Vibhagine
Vyomavad vyapta dehaya
Dakshinamurataye namah
