I am not Vaishvanara, the first
I am not Taijasa, the second
I am not Prajna, the third
I am the Turiya, the fourth

I am Satyam which cannot be negated
I am Chit that is Omniscient
I am Ananda that is all pervasive
I am the Lord of All, Om

The fourth prevades the three as an invariable existence
The three cannot stand apart from the fourth
The three letters, which constitutes (Om), is pervaded by the Self
Certainly Om is the Self-Absolute

I am the One who shines in the Sun &amp; the Moon
I am the One who shines in you
I am the One in whose presence existence shines
I am indeed the Light of lights
In all states of experience I shine alone
I am Shivam, Shivahom

Ayam Atma Brahma [x2]

Om Shanti Shanti Shanti
