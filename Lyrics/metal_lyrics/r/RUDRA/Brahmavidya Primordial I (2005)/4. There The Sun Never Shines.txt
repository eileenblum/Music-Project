An abode unheard of to the ones who trust in oblations
It cannot be won through rituals and enjoyments
This highest abode shines like a thousand suns
Which burns away the darkness of a thousand births and yet there the Sun never shines

Amala, Achala, Shuddha, Chaitanyam
Satyam, Purnam, Anantam Atma

"The indwelling Self of all is surely He of whom the heaven is the head,
the moon and sun are the two eyes, the directions are the two ears,
the revealed Vedas are the speech, air is the vital force, the whole Universe is the heart,
all It is He from whose two feet emerged the earth"

An abode where the servant becomes the master
An abode where the master becomes the servant
This highest abode shines like a thousand suns
Which burns away the darkness of a thousand births and yet there the Sun never shines

Amala, Achala, Shuddha, Chaitanyam
Satyam, Purnam, Anantam Atma

I am the abode where the sun never shines
I am the abode from which emerges the Universe

Amala, Achala, Shuddha, Chaitanyam
Satyam, Purnam, Anantam Atma [x2]

I am the abode where the sun never shines
I am the abode from which emerges the Universe [x2]
