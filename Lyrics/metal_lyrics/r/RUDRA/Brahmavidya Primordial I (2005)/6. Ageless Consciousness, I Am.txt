All Karmas proceed with the force to either remove pain or gain pleasure
Experiencing pleasure and pain, we roam the streets of Samsara

Where there is Birth, there will be certain pain
There is certain Death, and nothing to gain

Not knowing light from darkness we roam the streets of misery
In beauty there is ugliness
In ugliness I see beauty too
What a repulsive body that I have which oozes grime and filth
These carnal desires do I find unfulfilling

Where there is Birth, there will be certain pain
There is certain Death, and nothing to gain

Sadashiva Samarambham Shankaracharya Madhyamam
Asmadacharya Paryantam Vande Guru Paramparam

Finally the Truth is seen
Unknowable once to me but now known to me
What an error it is to take myself to be what I am not

No words can reveal me
Yet words alone set me free
The beatitude revealed through desciplic succession

No delusion for me
I am the ever free
No illusion for me
I am the ever free

Sadashiva Samarambham Shankaracharya Madhyamam
Asmadacharya Paryantam Vande Guru Paramparam
