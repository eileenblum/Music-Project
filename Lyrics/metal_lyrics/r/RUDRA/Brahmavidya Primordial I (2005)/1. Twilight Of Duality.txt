Aham Nirguna Akshara Nirmala Kutastha Kevala Satchitananda

I am the mother of all manifested forms
I am the father known as the immovable substratum
My children are the names born of mind
In me they move and shift forms like waves
None knows me through empty reasoning
Except through the words of the indomitable Shruti
I am the subtler than the subtle and the greatest
I am the Lord of the Chariot with five horses

Aham Nirguna Akshara Nirmala Kutastha Kevala Satchitananda

I weave the universe with myself as the material

I am the One
Non dually One
I am the Primodial Self
I am the Absolute

Aho aham namo mahyam, Vinasho yasya nasti me
Brahmadis tamba paryantam jagan nasho pi tishthitah

I am the mother of all manifested forms
I am the father known as the immovable substratum
My children are the names born of mind
In me they move and shift forms like waves
None knows me through empty reasoning
Except through the words of the indomitable Shruti
I am the subtler than the subtle and the greatest
I am indeed the Lord of this Chariot

Aham Nirguna Akshara Nirmala Kutastha Kevala Satchitananda [x2]

I am the One
Non dually One
I am the Primordial Self
I am the Absolute
