Brahmanandamn Paramasukhadam Kevalam Jnanamurthim
Dvandvaatheetham Gaganasadrusam Tathwamasyaadhi Lakshyam
Ekam Nithyam Vimalam Achalam Sarvadhee Saakshibhutam
Bhaavaatheetham Trigunarahitham Sadgurum Namami

Vairagya drives me insane and desperately I seek with faggots in hand, a Guru with Shraddha
For he is well versed in the Shruti that severs Samsara
He take me beyond the gates of sorrow and pain through knowledge

One is the Southern Course, filled with pain and pleasure
And there is the Northern Course, which leads to renunciation
Through restraint the Northern Course I won
It is the path where the sun is conquered and the self is merged in Purusha

That Purusha, without names &amp; forms and Immortality are one and the same
Thus was the instruction from the Guru who has transcended the veil of Maya
The colossal error called Adhyasa was removed by Apavada
This Brahmavidya alone is the panacea for the disease of Bhavasagara

Adhyaropa Apavada [x2]
Negation of the Superimposition [x2]
