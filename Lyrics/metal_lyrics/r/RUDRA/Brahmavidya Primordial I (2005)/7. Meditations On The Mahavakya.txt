Ekam Eva Advitiyam [x3]

Meditation on the axiom that Shvetaketu received from his father
It destroys the life of becoming someone other than what you are
The preceptor of nobility wields the garland of words from the Veda
Stringed with the right method, to reveal the Lord that you already are

The destruction of preconceived notions is possible but only with a purified mind
You listen, then you contemplate and free yourself from the delusion
By seeing that 'That' and 'thou' are indeed one since the dawn of time

Through this axiom the self is realised
Through this eralisation you gain Immortality
Through this attainment you'll realise that you are everything
Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma

This is Brahman
Thou are Brahman
All is Brahman
That Thou Art
[x2]
