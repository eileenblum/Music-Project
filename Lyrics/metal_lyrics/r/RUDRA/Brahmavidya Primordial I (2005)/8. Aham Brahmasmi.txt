That which Yajnavalkya sought away from home
That which Maitreyi wanted to know is
That which by seeking, all is known
Is but the Self within

Aham Brahmasmi [x4]

The world resolves into my senses
The senses resolve in the mind
The mind resolves in the "I"
And the "I" resolves in the Self
What is left to be known?
Once the Self is known
What is left to be seen?
When there is nothing left to see

The Self prevails when you destroy the veils
Of duality caused by the absence of vidya
It is not an effect caused
It is that which is uncaused
Beyond the ken of causality

That which is to be known solely through Atmavichara

Aham Brahmasmi [x8]
