Like Asuras we worship blindness
Innocence raped by Avidya
Tying oneself to the wheel of Samsara by seeking that which is impermanent
This delusion of a million births gets destroyed when one knows this Ananya Chaitanya

Shaivoham Shivoham Nityananda Shivoham Chidananda Shivoham Ananya Chaitanya

This eternal stream of consciousness vibrating in every iota
As the changeless principle behind the changing phenomenon

Om Namah Shivaya [x4]

That Purusha is I
Veiled as it were by a bright vessel
That Purusha is all, is indeed One
The Jiva who knows this gains all
This the Ishavasya reveals as Ananya Chaitanya

Shaivoham Shivoham Nityananda Shivoham Chidananda Shivoham Ananya Chaitanya [x2]
