Through the plea of the Devas to defeat Tarakasura
She incarnated as the daughter of Himalaya to seek the hand
Of the Mahadeva with that union Skanda was born
To crush Tarakasura thus the Gita of the
Devi got revealed to Himalaya

Not subject to destruction
Not limited by space
Not bound by time
She shine as the...

Pratyagatmasvarupinim
She is not the seen but the seer

The closer you get to the meaning of all
You see her shining in every cognition
You mistake her like the way
You miss the rope for the snake
All that you see is her projection
And yet she is none of what she has become
Sagunabrahma svarupinim
Nirgunabrahma svarupinim

With her grace I adorn this grief
With her grace I adorn this bliss

With her grace I adorn this grief
With her grace I adorn this bliss

Ahameva sa soham vai nishcitam viddhi parvata
Maddarshanam tu tatra syadyatra jnani sthito mama

Not subject to destruction
Not limited by space
Not bound by time
She shine as the...

Pratyagatmasvarupinim
She is not the seen but the seer
