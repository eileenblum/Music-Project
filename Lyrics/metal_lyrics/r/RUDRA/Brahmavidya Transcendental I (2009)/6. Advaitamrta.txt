Svaprakasham tamatmanam aprakashah katham sprshet

Ahamasmi sadabhami kadachinaham apriyam
Brahmaivaham atah siddham satchidanandalakshanam

Riding the waves of Maya but seeing Brahman everywhere
Surfing the waves of duality but witnessing non-duality

Universe which is inert has no independent existence
All of it depends on consciousness for its existence

Ahmasmai sadabhami kadachinaham apriyam
Brahmaivaham atah siddham satchidanandalakshanam

The world appears like a mirage but it is not an illusion
At the dawn of knowledge I see the world like a reflection
In the mirror of consciousness

In my consciousness the universe rises
My consciousness is all that becomes the world
Of names and forms

Svaprakasham tamatmanam aprakashah katham sprshet

In the primordial sleep of ignorance the Self
Assumes the form of heavens and hells
Pain, pleasure, body and mind rise to destroy freedom as it were

Ahmasmai sadabhami kadachinaham apriyam
Brahmaivaham atah siddham satchidanandalakshanam
