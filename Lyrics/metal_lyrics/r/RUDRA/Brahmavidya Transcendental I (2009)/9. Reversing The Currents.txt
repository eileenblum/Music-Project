What is seen is not the seer
The witnessing seer cannot be objectified
Through the words of Shruti the seer is seen like a reflection in the mirror

"When the mind, withdrawn from the perception of the external objects through the five sense, appreciates its own awareness and appreciates truth"

Who am I?
What am I? Atma Kim?

Aham satyasvarupam
Aham chinmayarupam
Aham anandarupam
Iti upadesha saram

Ishvararpitam necchaya krtam
Cittashodakam muktisadhakam

The objectified universe fleets every moment
The witness that I am invariable in all perceptions
The I remains as the witnessing consciousness
As the unchanging, unceasing, untainted reality

Atma Kim?
Who am I? What am I?

Aham satyasvarupam
Aham chinmayarupam
Aham anandarupam
Iti upadesha saram
