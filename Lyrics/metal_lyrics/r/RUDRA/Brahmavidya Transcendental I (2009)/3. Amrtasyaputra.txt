Mortals are damned by their fear of mortality
Caused by duality which manifests the world of multiplicity
But when all is Mithya what remains even to be seen apart from
The Self that shines in both darkness and light
Birth and death everywhere, yet I think of another dawn
To taste the bitterness of that which eludes permanence
The heaven that I seek and the joys I yearn to swill diminish into
The effulgence of the Self

We are Amrtasya Putrah

Atmaiva kevalam sarvam bhedabhedo na vidyate
Asti nasti katham bruyam vismayah pratibhati me
"The mind indeed is the form of space. Mind indeed is omnifaced.
Mind is the past. Mind is all. But in reality there is no mind."

Birth and death everywhere, yet I think of another dawn
To taste the bitterness of that which eludes permanence
The heaven that I seek and the joys I yearn to swill diminish into
The radiance of the Self

We are Amrtasya Putrah

Om namo bhagavate dattatreyaya

Om avadhutaya namah
Om brahmadattaya namah
Om vishnudattaya namah
Om shivadattaya namah
