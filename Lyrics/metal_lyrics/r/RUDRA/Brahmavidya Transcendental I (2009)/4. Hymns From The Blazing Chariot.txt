Shri bhagavan uvaca
Kutastvaa kashmalamidam vishame samupasthitam
Anaryajushtamasvargyamakirtikaramarjuna

Arjuna Uvaca
Na hi prapashyami mamapanudyadyacchokamucchoshanamindriyanam
Avapya bhumavasapatnamrddham rajyam suranamapi cahipatyam

Sanjaya uvaca
Evamuktva hrishikesham gudakeshah parantapah
Na yotsya iti govindamuktva tushnim babhuva ha

Dilemma amidst Kurukshetra yet Arjuna spoke like a wise man
The battle of Shreyas and Preyas enshrouds the Dharma Yuddha

Ashocyan anvashocas tvam

In both Krishna and Arjuna it shines eternally
One knows and the other knows not
A reality that shines even in one's ignorance
And shines the same in one's wisdom

Nasato vidyate bhavo nabhavo vidyate satah
Ubhayorapi drshtontah tvanayostattvadarshibhih
Avinashi tu tadviddhi yena sarvamidam tatam
Vinashamavyayasyasya na kashchitkartumarhati

Amidst chaos tranquility is bestowed
In action you see inaction
To see beyond the horizon you've got to unlearn your learning

Amidst the battlefield of Kurukshetra Brahmavidya was unveiled to Arjuna
That the Self is certainly Brahman
That which no weapons can kill

Nasato vidyate bhavo nabhavo vidyate satah
Ubhayorapi drshtontah tvanayostattvadarshibhih
Avinashi tu tadviddhi yena sarvamidam tatam
Vinashamavyayasyasya na kashchitkartumarhati

Yatra yogeshvarah krisno yatra oartho dhanurdharah
Tatra shrirvijayo bhutirdhruva nitirmatirmama
Om tatsaditi shrimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu
Brahmavidyayam yogashastre shrikrishnarjunasamvade
Mokshasannyasayogo nama ashtadashodhyahah
