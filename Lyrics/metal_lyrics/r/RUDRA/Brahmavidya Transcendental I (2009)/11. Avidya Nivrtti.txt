"The Lord I am, present everywhere I was prior to everything else.
I am the cosmic womb
I am the born and that which is to be born
I have faces in every direction and the indweller of beings"

Unborn and eternal he is,
Permanent and primordial his nature

Om jaya shankara shiva shankara deva
Om jaya shankara shankara maha deva

"From me alone everything is born. In me, everything is established.
In me, everything is resolved. I am that Brahman which is secondless."

Om jaya shankara shiva shankara deva
Om jaya shankara shankara maha deva

He is the soul of the universe
He is the Self of all

Om jaya shankara, om jaya shankara
