The sorrow is unbearable when countless desires devour me
Life is but a worthless mime which robs away my peace of mind
I now renounce this crown of thorns called Dharma
But this wanting madness never ends! Not even in paradise!

Nothing is worth seeking when everything is relative
I see all reduced to nothing; ashes seem to be its essence
Oscillating between pleasure and pain
The futility of Karmas is glaring
This pain ushers realization that these swans are indeed ravens

Thus Vairagya set me free
Viveka shall set me free

Om bhurbhuvah svah sannyastam maya

Mumukshutvam shall set me free
Shatka Sampat can set me free

Recognize the elusive pleasure in all
Recognize the deadening pain in all
Realize where there is mind even in paradise one can't be free

Ashimahi vayam bhikshamashavaso vasimahi
Shayimahi mahiprshthe kurvimahi kimishvaraih

"Face covered with wrinkles, head painted white with grey hair,
The limbs so feeble, yet desire alone stays youthful"
