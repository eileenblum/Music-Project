Thus speak the zealots of mankind
Fools without a questioning mind
Dogmas breed in their hypnotic words
Insecurity revealed in their preaching glory

Spreading Hate and disunity
Killing peace and harmony
Causing guilt and fear in men
Persecuting the innocent

This is the evil that holy men do
In the name of their religion

Opinions and lies taught as truth
Blinded in the name of good
Creating confusion and a despondent humanity

[solo - kannan]

They cheat, they lie, they make you weak,
They can't practice what they preach

[solo - selvam]

They cheat, they lie, they make you weak,
They don't practice what they preach

This is the evil that holy men do
In the name of their religion

[solo - selva]
