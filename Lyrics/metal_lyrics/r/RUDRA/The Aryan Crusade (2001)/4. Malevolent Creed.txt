Sacrifice in the name of God
Damnation of the lofty thoughts
Watching them die with innocent eyes
This is the sign of the malevolent creed

Is the belief in God necessary?
Is there a need for a creed?

Foolish beliefs in foolish minds
Idiots believe in those words divine
Intellectual circumcision
Bludgeoned by the blinding faith

Fools kill in His name!
People die for His abode!

[solo - selvam]

Minds clouded by dogmatic fools
Decorating lies with senseless truth
The beggar you are is the King in disguise
How long will this delusion last
What is there to gain when the Self is lost
Unthinking minds never realize this truth
Can't you see you are blind
Now it's time to crush these lies

Distinguish the fools from the wise
Cast off your faith, it's time to rise
Against all that makes you weak
From the clutches of this enslaving creed
