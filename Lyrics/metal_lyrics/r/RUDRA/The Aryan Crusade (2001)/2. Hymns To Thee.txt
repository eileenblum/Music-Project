The youthful lord imparts the ageless truth
Under the Banyan tree, facing the south
Uprooting primordial nescience
With his burning eyes of wisdom
For the benefit of the four Rishis
He teaches the inconceivable truth
In silence he teaches
In silence the knowledge revealed

[chorus]
The guru of gurus
Teacher of Atmavidya
Lord of all learning
Whose nature is Ananda

With the chinmudra unfolding Brahmavidya
Duality vanishes without a trace

[solo - kannan]

om namah pranavaarthaaya shuddha jnaanaika moortaye
nirmalaaya prashaantaaya dakshinaamoortaye namah

[solo - kannan]

Beyond death he takes you
By staring into the eyes of death
Where there is no place to reach
By just listening you gain all there is

[solo - selvam]

The youthful lord imparts the ageless truth
Under the Banyan tree, facing the south
Uprooting primordial nescience
With his burning eyes of wisdom
For the benefit of the four Rishis
He teaches the inconceivable truth
In silence he teaches
In silence the knowledge revealed

[chorus]
