The war has begun to destroy avidya
Annihilation of what is not,
watch us slaughter mercilessly

The Aryans are back, with knowledge supreme
The intellect is our weapon!
We're the warriors from the lap of eternity

[chorus]
Watch us invade, invading your minds
Gouging out the eyes of the blind
Revealing the way of the noble ones
Treading the path as the Aryaputras

Not the nomadic invaders from the North
But the noble warriors conquering the South

Not from the fictitious tale taught as history
But from the lineage of the noble Rishis
Neither colour nor race beholds nobility
But it is the Way, which makes us what we are

Watch us invade, invading your minds
Destroying the weak by the sword of wisdom
Removing the darkness from your minds
The intellect will shine in its own glory

[solo - kannan, selvam]

This is the fire that burns darkness to ashes
This fire of Aryadharma
