You have to die to see the light?
Is the weight of the world on you?
Constantly seeking to change the world
But never to change yourself

You are a pain here but expecting pleasure hereafter?
You may be blessed but are you a blessing?

The desperate need for a savior
Is for the fool and the weak
In the dungeon you have fallen
Now you are blind to reason
Heaven is a promise, so is Hell
An experience is always welcome
Verses distorted, your faith transported
To a realm where perception fails

[chorus]
Can't you see the state you're in?
Desires replaced by the desire for Kingdom come
A comforting transient holy slavery
This is your fate, it is sad but true!

You are the human sheep sent to the slaughterhouse
"Forfeit your sanity to gain the Kingdom"
The clergy is waiting with a book in hand
Speaking in tongues to drown your screams
You're in pain but you are paralyzed
by the dogmas of 2 thousand years
Your right to question raped and gagged
To doubt is to sin and a place in Hades!

[chorus]

Freedom forgotten
Lost in the Herd
Your silent tears are seen
Your soul yearns for relief

[solo - kannan]

Throw away those notions, which were taught
By the heaven mongers and the blind fools
Be like the wise and not otherwise
Let the mission be wisdom!

[chorus]

[solo - selvam]
