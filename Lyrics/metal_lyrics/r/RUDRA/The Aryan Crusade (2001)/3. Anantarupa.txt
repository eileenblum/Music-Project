Advaita, Nirguna, Nitya, Ananta

Without beginning and without an end
A reality I cannot comprehend
The wise declare it to be only One
Beyond the reach of speech and mind

[chorus]
"That is Infinite, This is Infinite
From that infinite this infinite came.
From that infinite this Infinite removed,
What remains is the Infinite

That which doesn't change
That which has no age
No abode to attain, No throne to worship
Wherever I see, It sees!!!

[chorus]

That which pervades all, the undifferentiated cause
The effect not different, from the cause!!!

[solo - selvam]

Advaita, Nirguna, Nitya, Ananta

[solo - kannan]
