[solo - selvam]

The wielder of time in human form (Jai Kali, Maha Kali)
In waves of time destroying the mortals born
Devourer of all that is ephemeral
She reveals the truth, non-dual

[chorus]
Cherish the seen by knowing the unseen
Enjoy the play from her lap of time
Mahaakaali, Bhadrakaali
Sanaatani, Rudrapatni,

Garland of skulls, the doership in time
Destroying the notion of 'me' and 'mine'
Standing upon Consciousness
The mother of this universe

[solo - kannan]

[chorus]

The blackness, the all pervasive space
I see the terror when I look at her face
Worship the terrible, worship Death
No more fear of my last breath
om kriim kaalyai namah
