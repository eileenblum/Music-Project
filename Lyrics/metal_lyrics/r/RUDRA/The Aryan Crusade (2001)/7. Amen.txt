I see the devil in your preaching creed
Your talk is cheap but many deceived
None needs your holy bread of life
What I need is to see through your lies!

Amen!!!.
Fools of God
Blinded Dogs

Passion defeats compassion
You feed God to the starving mouths
Ulterior motive in every action
Calculated moves to ensure conversion

Fools of God
Blinded Dogs

Pride of the insane
Vulgar display of divinity

[solo - selvam]
