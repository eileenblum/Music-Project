im in
over my head
follow that light
voice in my ear
which one is right
which one is
i will get into it
down to the bottom
inside of my mine and into my heart
oh i really wanna tell them now
theres a lie that lives and breathes
oh i really need to get this out
theres a lie that lives in me
oh i really wanna tell you now
deep inside it lives it sleeps
oh i really need to get this out
my heads spinning
all around
all around
im in
over my head
over my head
voice in my ear
which one is right
which one is
right
