oh i really need to get back
would you let me in
ive been running with a dead man
and i let him win
gotta show em love
theyre all you have
better let them help you
theyre all you have
breaking me down
i know they can feel it
breaking me down
they know all our secrets
breaking me down i know that
they know who we are
breaking me down i know they can feel it
breaking me down
they know all our secrets
breaking me down
i know that they know what we are
what we are
a happy feeling when i get back
cuz' they let me in
but now im walking like a dead man
where do i begin
gotta let them love you
theyre all you have
gotta let them help you
theyre all you have
tread lightly
those hands arent clean
youve got alot of nerve to spit in your hand for me
youve got alot of nerve spending it like its free
youve got alot of nerve to lie and lie again
youve got a lot of nerve but you aint fooling me
its on you
its not me
