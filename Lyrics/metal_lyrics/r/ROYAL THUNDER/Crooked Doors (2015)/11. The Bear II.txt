thing of beauty how I need you
from the moment that I
saw
your
face
I saw you come my way
and I've loved you every day
broke my heart in time I noticed
but I always did forgive and forget and forget
but I watched you fade away
oh I watched us fade away
and I wish I had the heart
to move on
but I am not
no I am not that strong
no my love I'm not that strong
some will rise
some will fall
some will run away
but I will fade and die
without
without
you
