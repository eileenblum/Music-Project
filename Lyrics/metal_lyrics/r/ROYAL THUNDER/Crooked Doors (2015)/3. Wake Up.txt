I gather all my demons in a line tonight
guide them through the darkness into morning light
they don't seem to struggle there's no need to fight
I am not afraid
should I be afraid
I look up at the stars my wandering soul subsides
desert spirits pass with and electric light
there's no need to struggle there's no need to fight
I'm cutting off my head
I toss it to the side
I'm hoping this will save me rest my restless mind
I don't wanna struggle I don't need this fight
I am not afraid
no I wont be afraid
I'm rising from the sand I see the pale blue light
you are now a memory I don't feel your life
anymore
[backing vocals:] bury me soak up my energies break me from this bond
wake up
I need to wake up
I'm just wasting my time
wake up I need to wake up
I'm just wasting my life
...I am never gonna look back
I'm never gonna look back
I'll just look the other way
I'll just look the other....
