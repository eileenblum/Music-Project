throw your best friend into the fire
then spit them into the grave
round and round
they're twisting that screw
feel it turning inside
you break our backs in the fight
press your fingers into our eyes
round and round your twisting that screw
feel it turning inside
come inside
were alright
we just built a lovely fire
close your eyes
now put your hand in
mine
trow your best friend into the fire
then spit them into the grave
round and round their twiating that screw
feel it turning inside
theyll throw you into that fire
theyll spit you into that grave
dont shake that hand its a lie
its a lie
come inside
were alright
we just built a lovely fire
close your eyes
now put your hand in mine
stay inside
your alright
let us keep you one more night
shut your mouth
just put your hand in mine
mine mine
your worth pennies now mark
on the line
mine mine all mine
pull your best friend out of the fire
and lift them out of the grave
no more round and round
no more twisting your screwed
now its turning in you
now its turning in
