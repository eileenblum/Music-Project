it wont be easy when I leave
but it's better than lingering here with you
there's a hand on my back that guides me on
it's bigger
and brighter
and it's faster than me
I'm in it
I did this
the moment
I'm in it
and I'm not gonna break it off of me
you walk with fire
I heard you were a liar
but I don't wanna break it off of me
no younger
I'm getting
I keep on forgetting
still I don't wanna break it off of me
I walk with fire
ill show you who's a liar
but I'm not gonna break it off of me
whats it gonna matter if you have your way with the world
I don't wanna be there when the fire dies
whats it gonna matter if you have your way with the world
god,I'm gonna miss him
things will be better when I'm free
I've never been good enough for you
there's a hand on my back that guides me on
it's bigger
and brighter
and it's faster
than me
I don't wanna leave you all alone
but I cant keep fighting with these two worlds
and the hand on my back just pushed me down
if I stay
if I go
why am I still here
it's bigger
brighter
and it's faster
than me.....
