i can hear you calling
and im not gonna run
my energies pushing and pulling
im falling for this hard
i shake it off and forget you
see you out and feel ok
but you keep drawing me back here
and i cant keep you away
your using me up
i feel wasted
and you really
oh you really got me now
but im sorting it out
yeah im sorting it out
oh your using me now i can see it
and you really
oh you really got me now
maybe i need to slow down and wait
around
its around
ive seen it around
i am waiting on the real thing
and i need it right now
doesnt have to be a big deal
but i need it
oh i need it right now
its around
i can feel it around
i really oughta try
im a fool
to speed up ahead
no i dont wanna be here
i shut down cuz everythings dead
and now my instinct is telling me
that i should just run
so i run really far
i see
bright lights
forming a wall
and now a fire
it breathes
as it burns
down
all of my energies awake
you better run for your life
