so you got what you want
but its no good for me
and I'm walking backwards
and out of this scene
this is not what I want
no
I need to be free
baby I'm sorry
I never meant to let you down
but I just don't love you
oh I know how I hurt you now
if I were to stay here
id only make you cry cry
I need to be free
let me go
this is not what I want
this is no good for me
so I'm walking backwards
and away from here
far away from here
so don't wait
for
me
