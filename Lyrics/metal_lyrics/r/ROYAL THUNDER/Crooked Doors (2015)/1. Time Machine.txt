im looking for a time machine
but i cannot go back
and change one single thing
its staying all in tact
and im looking for a way to feel
cuz' i dont feel a thing
and it haunts me in this life
when you want me to pretend
oh im looking for a place to be
and a place to lay my head
im drowning in this life
come back for me
it squeels its in the air tonight
that devil knows my name
it shreaks across the sky tonight
that devil knows my name
choosing moderation
i should give it up
but im not giving it up your way
it screams it kicks
i feel the weight
it pulls me down
but im not giving it up that way
still looking for a way to feel
too tired to pretend
it haunts me in this life
when you want me to confess
will i ever find a peace within
will these colors fade away
im wrapped up in these arms
im burning in your bed
dont you ever come and look for me
dont you ever say my name
im standing ten men tall
you will not break me
its starting to fade
theres no need to push away
theres a thorn in your eye
its starting to fade
theres no need to push away
theres a thorn in my side
theres no need to push away
you want this
i finally found a way to feel
no more will i pretend
you wont haunt me in my life
im going to confess
i finally found a peace within
as the colors fades away
i break free form your arms
and burn you in this bed
im no stranger to your black streak
i see through
your my enemy
i oughta know
i wanna know you better than that
im looking for a time machine
but i can not go back
and change one single thing
its staying all in tact
dont you ever come and look for me
dont you ever say my name
you'll be waiting all your life
dont come back for me
relax
its gonna fade
relax
its gone away
