two hands
on the back wall
were going through your mind
from the first floor
through the open doors
tell us what you find
dirty pictures
holy water
and a hole in my eye
some of you are with me
some of you are gone
and others
hiding
waiting to find a way out
out
of
here
I can feel him fall me
I can feel him fall on me
I am trembling
what is happening to me
white wash this memory
we've been trying to get back but were so far in
hush
now
all of these thoughts are obscene
this is such a mess
I know that there's something more
something tells me this is over
now open these doors
we were so far in
hanging from the walls
sliding down down down
to the floor
and I can see those.....
your free
