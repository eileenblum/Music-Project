I will come back here one day in my life
I will be back here one day in my life
I will see how I have let you down
I will come back here one day
I've got a little bit of time here
gotta get this right
I've gotta lay it on the table
if the cards feel right
I'm kicking a rock all around in my head
and all of the times I had
that ship is slowly passing through me
life set me free and cut me down the middle
I'm stuck in between it
don't put me back together
I will come back here one day
I will be back here one day
I can hear you saying
give us one more night
I got a really bad feeling
did I get this right
now I'm throwing a rock all around in my head
cut me down the middle
I don't wanna stay here
oh the rock inside my head
its getting really loud
loud
loud
I don't know what I should do
maybe I should try
but I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
here......
