You have shut down over some time
Memories go in and out of your mind
In your dreams they come to the light
You toss and turn and you fight it at night

You know what's wrong
You see the truth
You're fighting it but it's not easy
No...

You gotta walk through this
Your body shakes and shifts
You gotta walk through this
Hold your body, shake and shift

You gotta walk through this
Your body shakes and shifts
You gotta walk through this
Hold your body, shake and shift

You have shut down over some time
Memories go in and out of your mind
In your dreams they go to the light
You toss and turn and you fight it at night

You know yourself you can not lean on anyone
Do you trust yourself to walk through all this time you've lost
Keep me informed
Oh, body, speak, don't bring me sickness
I long for the truth
Bring the truth to me
This heart's still beating

Just close your mouth don't let it out
You're on your own
Give these things some time
In time, I know
You'll see it's gone
Keep your eyes ahead
Don't hide your face
Be an honest spirit
I long for the truth
Bring the truth to me
This heart's still beating

This heart's still beating
Oh, this heart's still beating
Oh, my heart's still beating
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my heart's still beating

This city is gonna crash
This city is in the air
This city is coming down
This city is gonna burn

You know what's wrong
You see the truth
You're fighting it but it's not easy

You gotta walk through this
Your body shakes and shifts
You gotta walk through this
Hold your body, shake and shift

Your strong hands
On your side
Keep digging
Into the earth
The way is slow getting home
You're wiser now
Spit it out

Your strong hands
On your side
Move slowly
Just recognize
That's the way it goes
You're wiser now
Spit it out
That's the way it goes
Let it go
