There's a coin on my neck
Heavy weight on my chest
Glowing white light surrounds me
Now my spirit's caressed
There's a trembling in the corridor
I feel it in my head
Someone's talking to me
I don't understand
My body burns
In their hands

Now a language pours from my lips
Like hot oil from a jar
I can see the foot of holiness
You scream, "Kiss me, bow down"
Have pity on the demon
It was forced upon the child
I am not the enemy
Where are the eyes of God?

There's a black and a white one
Don't you spit on my land
That would make your path a crooked one
Now the bibles are swelling
As the people cry no
I will grip you with my burning hand
You'll understand
And I won't let go

Black
Dark tunnel crawl inside
Water
Looking for an end in sight

I'm swallowing your death

There's a weight on my neck
Heavy heart in my chest
Now a dark light surrounds me
My spirit is possessed
