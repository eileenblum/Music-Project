I was looking for you
But you've come to me
Press my spine on the tree
Yeah
Open my eyes
I wanna see

Swallow me up
Take me up in your light
Swallow me up
Take me up in your light
Swallow me up
Take me up in your light
Swallow me up
Take me up in your light

It was black, you were blue
As we soared over sea
You were singing to me
Yeah
My arms open
I'm going deep

Deep
We are going so deep
So deep
Yeah
We are going
Go deep
So deep

In the lies
In the lies
In the lies
In the lies

I can't feel my face
What is this place
I'm in your dreams
Ha ha ha ha...

Take, my love, what is yours
Hold me close and know despite the distance I can not ignore
We were searching, broken, we wanted to live
We will never be the same

Things have pulled us apart
We can never have the love we had, we bend and break our hearts
I see clearly
Who do they think that they are
I will never be the same
The same
