Black ships and their masters
They're coming anyway
I know what you're after

There's cheap wine, romance, and you
Then I called, but you did not answer your sleeping witch

Black ships and they're sailing
The stench of death they crave
I know what you're after

Come get what you wanted
You take it anyway
I see what you're after

There's cheap beer, romance, and you
Then I called, but you did not answer your sleeping witch

We're dead
You're dead
It's dead

There's cheap rum, romance, and you
You
Then I called, but you did not answer your sleeping witch

We're dead
You're dead
We're dead

You're dead
It's dead
It's dead...
