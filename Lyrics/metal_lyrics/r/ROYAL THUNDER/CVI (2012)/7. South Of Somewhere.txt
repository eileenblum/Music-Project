Teach him and warn him
Oh, when he sleeps at night
These things will haunt his bones

Mountain's eyes on them
Oh, what these watchmen see
These things will haunt their bones
Oh, what these watchmen see
These things will haunt their bones

And south of somewhere, somebody's in there
I fight for good reasons, the calling's closer
And if I see them, I will start with questions
I won't stop repeating until there's answers

And the dead of night will come in vain
I am careful in proceeding on my way
You can whisper in my ear
The things they say
But it will not bring me pain

The land now is buried
Oh, what you left behind
You can not have it back

And south of somewhere, somebody's in there
I fight for good reasons, the calling's closer
And if I see them, I will start with questions
I won't stop repeating until there's answers

And the dead of night will come in vain
I am careful in proceeding on my way
You can whisper in my ear
The things they say
But it will not bring me pain
