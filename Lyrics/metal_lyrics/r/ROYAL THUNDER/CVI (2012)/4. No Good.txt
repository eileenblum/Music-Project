What's the point in you just hanging around
You're just a dead weight on my ground

You're no good

Time and time again you run your mouth
I see through you
Figured you out

Now you lift me up then you put me down
Behind my back your words get around

Smooth talker, you think you're slick but I don't, don't
I don't like you, leave me alone

You're no good
You're no good no
No good

You're no good

I'm a little tired you hurt my head
You're so draining I'm seeing red
You smooth talker, you think you're slick but I don't, don't
I don't like you, leave me alone

You're no good

Shit, shit, here you come again
But I can see you, snake in the grass
