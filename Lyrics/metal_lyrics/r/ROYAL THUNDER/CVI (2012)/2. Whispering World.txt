Here's the reason
It's the way that you are
But I'm letting it go
In this season
I am learning in life
That I have no control

So I thought over time
And made up my mind
To throw you a line
It's dead in your eyes and you don't reply
I'm wasting my time

Now I'm driving around playing back all the words
In my head that I should have been saying
I should have been strong
I knew you were wrong
But I just let you break me

Here's the reason
It's the way that you are
But I'm letting it go
C'est la vie
And cry salut
Let it go
Let him choose his own road

And you can push us out
And you can do what you want
But you're on your own
And no one's listening
No one cares anymore
Now you're all alone

So I thought over time
And made up my mind
To throw you a line
It's dead in your eyes and you don't reply
I'm wasting my time

Now I'm driving around playing back all the words
In my head that I should have been saying
I should have been strong
I knew you were wrong
But I just let you break me

You lie
You cheat
You steal
You hurt

Here's the reason
It's the way that you are
But I'm letting it go
In this season
I am learning in life
That I have no control

And you can push us out
And you can do what you want
But you're on your own
And no one's listening
No one cares anymore
Yeah, we let you go
