When will this be over
I can't wait
I've been waiting so long
Nothing's changed

Your face down in dark water
You're going to drown
Drown

Maybe when the sun comes up
You'll see your waves
You've gone too far out

I can see her doing well
That when you're not around
You are like a flame that's rising
But she can't put you out

And I believe a better life is waiting for her
But no one here can stop you now and we all know you won't let go

Please try
My hands are tied
I'm over being under this and lifting your weight
You're running away
You're not fooling anyone
I hope you're getting over this
I'm sick of it

I don't wanna see your face around me anymore
All of your excuses old and tired
You're becoming a bore
And if you die before my time and she is there to say goodbye
I will show her how I feel
She'll see the storm that turns in my eyes

Please try
My hands are tied
I'm over being under this and lifting your weight
You're running away
You're not fooling anyone
I hope you're getting over this
I'm sick of it

Twisting pulling turning I am getting this out
Bitter is the taste of your name in my mouth
Twisting pulling turning I am getting this out

Twisting pulling turning I am getting this out
Bitter is the taste of your name in my mouth
Twisting pulling turning I am getting this out

I hope you're getting over this
I'm sick of it
You're running away
You're not coming home
Kill it, I'm burning, he's not coming home
Kill it, I'm burning, he's not coming home...
When the sun comes up maybe you will see your waves
Kill it, I'm burning, he's not coming home...
