The depths of nothing drown my soul
Caverns of deception open from below
Left alone with the emptiness to fill the void
Anger is the sedative to soothe my mind

Compulsion to destroy the existence of oneself
Holding onto the elements of a fading sanity
Darkening surroundings of a deluded mind
Forever trapping reason inside

Pillars of hatred support eternity
Wall of darkness mirrors my destiny

Light fading to grey
Life drains out
Future led astray
Past erased to black
Lost hope of happiness
Found less in death
Had a chance for life
Lost hope of happiness
Found less in death
Had a chance for life
Now it is go
