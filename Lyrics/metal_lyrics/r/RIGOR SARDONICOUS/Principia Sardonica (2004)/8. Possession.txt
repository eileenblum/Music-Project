A grave to shade the frozen day
In cold desertion with shallow names
A soul born dead and cast unto flames
In shameless play to retrieve her way

A frost so pale in softened rain
In casted stone not chisled away
A virtue without lustre in clay
In graven silence and darkened pain

A forgotten stream by an unknown grave
In gifted silence a name betrayed
A barren dream asleep in hate
In mourning dreams denied in rage

A flight of woes in sickness reign
In darkness shunned of mortal saves
A hinded sight such wretched craves
In forlorn lust she sat in grace

A burden onto Hell's dark path
The frost of life in darkness sat
A heart of dust, a soul of lack
The sombre danse from which she laughed

A fallen god to ice so black
The deamon sighs in fractured glass
A silhouette of flame so vast
The eyes of felled Death stared back

A sigh from which thy life attacked
The dead declared offsane impasse
A season of the unknown craft
The plague from which thy death begat

A frightened earth with molten cracks
The stillness of the fire's cast
A fortune of the broken mask
The face upon defiantly smashed
