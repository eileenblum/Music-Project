Mourning has broken
Life is fading
Falling to pits
In endless despair

Awakening of eternity
Sleeping with eyes open
Betrayed of sanity
Cut no bleeding

Strength exhausted
Soulless extinction
Strength exhausted
Soulless extinction

Screaming out in pain
But no one hears your pleas
Shattered in your life
You passing by in time
Scarred in your mind
Where are your fatal wounds
Silence for your piece
Insanity kills you
Insanity kills you
