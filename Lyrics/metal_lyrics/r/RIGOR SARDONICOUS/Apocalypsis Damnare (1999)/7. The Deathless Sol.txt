As Decembre falls like a shaded Moon
And Death Sleeps the Nocturnal Cold
The desolate trees do cry to the Eve
And the breath of earth has Frozen the sun

Flowing Dark Stream of Death
Freezing shrine, dawn will never come

As the dawn fades to Endless Twilight
And the dusk does fall to Immortal Night
The Blackened seas die Whist and Freeze
And the Nighttide sky rings Perpetual Unlight

Starlight, Starbright
Descend unto Frozen Depths

Seething Silence Darkened Unworld

Volatile Nothingness
Freezing shrine, dawn shall Never rise
