"Praise the Dead to Contempt the living"

Behind the Eyes of Lustful Death
I Await in Slumber to bequeath Unrest
For within the Walls of an Enshrined, Decayed Tomb
The corrupted Living of the Dead lie astray

Nocturnal
Desolate
Obeisance
Condensed state of Consciousness

Existence writhing in Flesh - Forgotten Sorrow
Stench of Remains Reek - Eternal Tomorrow

Enshrouded Visions of Darkness betray the innocent
Strolling the Path of life, Soul of Might
Pervading Fear for they know, wrenching
Path of Blood falls to the Abyss

The Dead are to become
And the living shall no more
Embrace the life within

Blind Light
Whispers
Envision
Crypt of the Night

The Dead speak of the Path they follow
Light for some for Other's know
