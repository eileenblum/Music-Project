Taken from Mortal Sin, Underrealm lives again
Reposing form, life of End, open to couch viewed again
Weep away, sobbing cry, Turn away and wonder why
Course of pain drives insane, heart of Blood drains again

Furnished for Beyond
Life has drained away
Cold and hard Despair
Of the lives that were paired

Sealed to Rest in thy comfort selected chest
Protected form everlasting, Sentiment of Stone
Lie in bed, dear Body, dysfunctioned form of human life
Earthen concrete Palace is thy Eternal board of peace

Lowered down in the Ground, Sealed away, numbing sound
Shrieking pain seen again, Underrealm reigns supreme
Reared Sombre, Stiffened breath, restore life on again
Lavish Death, Mortal Sin, reign of Underrealm again
