Time to end the suffering
I cannot stand the pain
I don't care who it hurts
Because life just isn't worth it
Mirrored in my eyes
The agony of my life
Uncontrolled rage from within
When will it all end

Death growing closer
A needed change from hate
I've suffered long enough
And now it must end
The pain I have lived with
Consumes my existence
Left to endure alone
I must go to my destiny

Now I Die

Dark shadows play on my mind
Dismal embrace of solitude
Searching for an easy end
Deliverance from my Misery

Mirrored in my eyes
The agony of my life
I must now go
To my final rest
End growing closer
I feel the cold of Death
My pain is slowly lifting
As I drift away

My mind grows silent
My hands grasp the emptiness
No future in sight
Just the darkened end
Light growing dimmer
Like the hope I once possessed
Final act of loneliness
Death at my own Hand
