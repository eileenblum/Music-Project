Infliction of Sorrow, Trespasser of Pain
Knowledge of the Future, Symptom of your gain
Power of the Father, leading you to Death
Aware of what's to Become beyond your Last Breath
Freedom of enslaved blood, Those you have Failed
Forgiveness of thy children, Shed of Darkness Prevails
King of Unholy people, atop a crown of Thorns
Take his Bloody hand into the Land of the Promised
......Committer of Holy Suicide

Oracle of righteousness, assurance of salvation,
Leader of Whistful souls
Gathering the Broken one's enchantment of faith
Sardonically profound and Cold
Hooked upon the symbol of the Holy people
Blood-Stained and grey
Face to the Skull with Death, the Fate that you have known
It is the Only way

"For God so loved the world, He gave His only Son"
To Rot and Wither away
"In the beginning", from then on fortold
He will Die someday
"Save your Servant", primary goal
On your knees and pray

Born here to Save, turn away and Die
Look down at your people, they wonder why

The King, Son, Savior Died by his own Hand
To free enslaved servants to serve him in his Land

Of Underrealm again
