I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End
Be Thou Faithful unto Death
Fear ye none of these things
And I will Kill thy childers with Death
As many I love I rebuke and chasten
Ten thousand times Ten thousand
And before the throne
There was a sea of glass like unto crystal
And I look and Behold a Pale Horse,
His name that sits is Death
And Hell hath followed with Him
The Time of Death is here, no graves shall ever save
And the Smoke of Torment ascends Forever and Ever
I am the Seven Plagues of earth
Fear me all ye
Blessed are the Dead
Cast afar thy penance
Come unto Me, for I am thy Wisdom
His Name that standeth is Death
Blessed is My lasting Fortune
I am Alpha and Omega Be thou Faithful unto Death
