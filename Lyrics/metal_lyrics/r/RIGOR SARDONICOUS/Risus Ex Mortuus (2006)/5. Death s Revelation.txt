Death awaits my Soul
Bringing me to my Immortal home
Visions of Life, Fantasy 'til Death
Eternity is washed in Damnation's Blood
Hatred to all who have passed here before
Beckoning Light draws the unsuspecting close
Burned by the fire of the soul stealing host
Controlled by a will that led to Damnation

Darkness fills the void of sight
On going Horror of continuous night
Centuries of Nightmares confined to a dream
Unable to awake from my Eternal Sleep...

Damned is my immortal soul
Destined to lie in the fiery hole
Forever cursed the Nightmare continues
Unending Terror of an Eternity in Ruins
Forgiveness from the lord after I die
Promises of life turn out to be lies
Doomed to Eternity bathed in Flames
Condemned existence of never ending pain

Darkness fills the void of sight
On going Horror of continuous night
Centuries of Nightmares confined to a dream
Unable to awake from my Eternal Sleep...
