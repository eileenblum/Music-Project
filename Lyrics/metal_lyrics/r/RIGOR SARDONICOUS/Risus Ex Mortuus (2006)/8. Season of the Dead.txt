Deception of life's enduring pain
Reception of Cold and stiffened ways
Protection from live and mortal waste
feast of the Putrid
Celebrate the onset of Death
This is the Season of the Dead

Arisen from the vacated abysmal plain
Palpitate erotic, barren waste
Succumb vicarious, enslaving pain
inflict and suffer
Eustress of the live and mortal waste
Thus upon Opening the Gate

Life - Baptism of sorrowful fade
Birth - Confirmation sinful innate
Exist - false angled fallen plain
Death - the Sleepless, infinite Dream

Thy Unholy, Cherished faith
Doth befog intrepid ways
ARISE! from the golden, Flaming Gate
life - Death befall thee
Rise thy Putrid form of waste
This is the solstice of our Fate

Life - thy misery of His Name
Birth - afterborn dismay
Exist - false angled fallen plain
Death - the Sleepless, infinite Dream..
