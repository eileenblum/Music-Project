Smile of the Dead
Pleasure of life's Decease
Frown unto the world
Ongoing live Disease
Stiffened tissue
Drying eyes
Victor of the Sleepless Life
Scavenged Earth
Crawling Flesh
Enter to Unsleeplessness
Vision's Cold, Death Bell tolls
Raging form of Eternal dormant
Taken from life, given to Death
-ARISE!

Risen atop Loamy Depths
The Abysses of Unlife
Eternal Hail for lustful Death
Savior of the Divine
Falling to the Scavenged Plains
Sardonical and Grim
Calculated disarray
Discombobulate the Sign

Withered Death, falling Flesh
Servant of Unsleeplessness
Touch of Cold, Death Bell tolls
Arise atop the Buried hole
Sloughing Sloven, Raging sight
Movement of Pathy life
Stained tissue, mummified eyes
Forward to Eternal plight

Dismemberment of the living race
Sapponified Remains
Mutilated Infanticide
Gross display of game
Fearful sight the loss of life
All of whom shall fall
Decaying Corpses, Fermenting Bodies
Rigored and Cold

Skyful Blaze, Rising Low
In the Depths, Darkness grows
Lighted Shadow, Faded Light
Underworld Rise, Eternal Plight
Lavish the Earth, Rotten Decor
Life Takes, Death Gives...
