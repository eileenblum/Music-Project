Living in Torment
Praying for the End
An end to the Agony
Cannot stand the Pain

Time is running out
Life is near the end
Yesterday's beyond my reach
Tomorrow Awaits my Death
Existence without reason
Disdain for all that's alive
Remembering the days of laughter
Realizing it was a Lie

Don't dwell in the past
Look to the Future
For the solution
That has to come

Nothing makes sense anymore
Living in complete confusion
Death is the only Constant
And the only solution
I'm losing faith in all I know
Nothing to ease the suffering
Only hope is Death's forgiveness
To guide me from Despair

Blood on my hands
Flowing from my veins
Death fills my last hours
Awaiting the Final Gift

Eternal Suffering
Crying out in Death
Condemned existence
At the Revelation of Death
Terror from the Grave
Never again to rise
Eternity of Darkness
Forever to fill my eyes

Misery of life
Grows nearer to Death
Never again to feel the Pain
Of life's Hatred...
