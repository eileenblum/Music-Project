Atop the Stench of evaporated Death
a Bloodless form of Wasted Life
Parasitic gluttony writhing inside
Internal nerve shatter, sanity writhe

Dissect
Torn Torn Flesh
Blood Let
Reject

Parasitic Scavengery
Leaves thy whole a scant
Feasted Flesh by Larval colonies
Rapes thee dear Bone bare

Lustful glutton, surviving tactic
Crawling in and out
Failure of sanity to dispose
of non-existent Larvae...
