O' early morning sunrise
Save my soul and light my face
Then a shadow fallen from heaven
Came and took me far from grace

My life is now lost, hope is gone
Lay down upon my grave, I am now
Dead

O' angels of the darkness
Touch my flesh and hide thy face
Take my body into stardust
And the earth shall fall in flames

Amen
