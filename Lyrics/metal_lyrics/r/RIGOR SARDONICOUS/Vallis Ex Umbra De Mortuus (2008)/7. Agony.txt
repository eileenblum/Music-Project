The horrors of my mind
Cloud reality
Dark figures play
Tearing my soul

Decent to madness
Seems inevitable
All seems lost and
Devoid of hope
Sickness of mentality
Confusions of reality

Insane thoughts
Drive my vision
Taking me to the end

Pain of suffering
Is all the keeps
Me alive
Agony, misery,
Despair
Guide me on
My quest

Lost...Alone
Destiny...Provoked
Time drifting
Senses shifting
Feelings
Gone...Forever
Done

Lessons of life never
Learned
Useless guilt of
Survival
Tight embrace of
Emptiness
Darkness dulls the
Light

Symptoms hidden
Behind desolution
The diagnosis never
Comes
Alive but not living
Hope of tomorrow is
Gone
