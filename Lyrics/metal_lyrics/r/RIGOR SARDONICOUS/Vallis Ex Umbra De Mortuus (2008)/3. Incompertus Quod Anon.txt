In fair innocence that died without light
A fallen swift breath which fades in the night
A reflection of dreams that hallow to be
A fragment of stone to touch and to see

Such strong, fair sweetness, thy meek mortal one
Forgotten to some and to all but not one
Cradle your fears and weep as ye may
Thy chaste and soft radiance has died in the day
