Blood rains down from the sky
Rivers choked with the fallen
Terror in the minds of the remaining
Death continues to reign supreme

The earth stained red as they die
Lifeless eyes see the end of time

Orphaned hope as the
Destruction perdures
Pulverized bodies become
The new earth

Forever night
No more light
Nothing left to see

Plague and famine
Pestilence and death
Holocaust complete

Acidic rain
Drowns in the past
Future is forgotten

Eternal winter
Dark and cold
Deep as the endless void

As the winds of tomorrow blow
The dreams of the apocalypse will be fulfilled
