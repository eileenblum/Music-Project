Should I wake before the dawn in a cascade of sleep
I shall scream in silent dreams
A slumber in a mourning and aching breathe
The skybound sol rays a pallid disease
"Mommy! Where are you? I am cold and scared!"
"Little one, be silent. Unto the earth you are spared."
No rainbows nor fairies adorn my bed
As darkness slips over my obscuring, wet head
I am weak, I am pale, My humours have shunned
My soul has been cast though my body clings on
