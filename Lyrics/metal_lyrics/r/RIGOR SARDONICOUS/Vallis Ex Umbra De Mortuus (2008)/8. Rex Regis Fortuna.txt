A dusk in shadows, a palace in pain
A king without crown and
A queen in shame
A sceptre destroyed
Among a throne maimed
A jester's court raptured in flames
A shallow moor in fog silhouette
A castle of souls breathes
Haunted breath
A path of blood royal
Upon ancient steps
A noble birth wrought
Forgotten death

A shadow of dust atop earth
And stone
A fallen angel without heaven
Or home
A sombre praise borne by no one
A gallant virtue among clouds
Without sin
A dusk in shadows, a fortune of fame
A monarch of lust, forever erased
A rapture in twilight,
A cold northern blaze
A solicitude of death
Unknown in disgrace
