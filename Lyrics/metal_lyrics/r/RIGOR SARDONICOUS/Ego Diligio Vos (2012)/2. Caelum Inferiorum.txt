I hear the angel's sing
I hear the devil laugh upon me
A light so splendid and fair
A night of wretchedness and despair

As I walk upon the caverns of time
I beseech the day as I lay upon broken wings

I hear the songs that they sing
I hear the merry wails of damnation
They are born of sweet delights
They were born from endless night

I can see the sun
I can feel the night
I have crowned my head
Then they have taken her dead

I have taken her hand
Nigh the grave to be prepared so vile
The songs that they did sing
Were scowled into levity
