And They came from flames so far and near
Crusaders estranged of madness and woe
Carnage waged for pastimes stay

A foetid tide that is drunk on blood
Mesmerized by this sight so depraved

And the One came unto me
And He spake that I was not the one
To have this joyful grace

A blackened sun that has come from beyond
Entrenched in fright at this sight so forlorn

"What can you claim? Who can you seek? There can be no glory or honor.
Fire reigns eternal. There can be no birth. No love nor hope nor joy nor life.
Nothing sacred remains, nothing that is dear. Nothing shall save you from this gift of fate."

And they laughed these decrepit wretched ones
A fleeting gaffe of torment I did gaze
And I wept. And I fell. And it was.
