Daylight shines the horizon
A glimmering sign of hope
Enchanted molten rising
I relinquish this time alone

A fertile land of grace
Rebounding in my eyes
I will reclaim my lost life

To turn upon this land
I shudder to no unknown
To cast upon the damned
To take from them their own

I seek my salvation
Enliven my own path
I call upon her lapse

A death so estranged
A conscience of dismay
A nightmare while awake
I stand upon her grave

I call upon her name
Before the remembrance gate
A touch upon her face
An angel in this place

I lift her from the earth
A dream unreal and erred
A passioned and tortured world
I embrace her pallid form

In madness from desire
The others from the fire

They danse no more so wild
Their futile wanton guile

I lay her down so near
A noble and gallant scene
I reveal her limpid body
And take from heaven's piety

I lust upon my claim
This immemorial union remains
No god nor daemon shade
Can take this fortune away
