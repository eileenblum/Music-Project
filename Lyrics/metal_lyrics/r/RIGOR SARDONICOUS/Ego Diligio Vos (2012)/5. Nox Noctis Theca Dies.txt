A splendor so fair now is gone
The sun does set away so far

Enchanted honor in flames lies undone
My claim, my cherished is abandoned

I see her gaze upon my face
In vivid prayer alight in haze

A ship upon the shore ablaze
A daemon danse of fallen grace

A desert ray in the midst of May
So weary a shade such morning rays

It creeps upon the sands of grey
A sting to pierce the soul awa
