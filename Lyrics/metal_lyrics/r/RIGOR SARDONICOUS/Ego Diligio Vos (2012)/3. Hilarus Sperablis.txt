The choirs of Heaven unveiled their grace and showed the Divine unto me.

And they sang of life and hope, of darkness shunned, of love and birth, of us as one, a lighted shade, a sacred dove.

And He came to me and spake that I have been blessed in honor's right.

"Do you see the glory before you?
Are you enchanted in your gaze?
Does this miracle call upon you?"
"Yea! I do! I am! I claim!"

And it was.
