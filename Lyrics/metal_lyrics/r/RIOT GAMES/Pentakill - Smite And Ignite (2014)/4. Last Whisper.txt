Whoa Yeah Yeah

No matter how they fight today
No matter how much honor they'll display
We'll dominate

Spells of war
Hear my call
Help me take them down

They'll hear my deadly last whisper
Right before they die

This melody seeks a new victim
Let it penetrate their mind

I will revive, one more life
To ignite them all
And their barriers will crumble
Under all of my force
They'll fall
Lets make them crawl

And when we finally meet their king
There will be no ghost for him
We shall end it all

Whoa Yeah Yeah
