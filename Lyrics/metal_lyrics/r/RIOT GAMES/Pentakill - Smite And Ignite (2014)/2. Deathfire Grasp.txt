Fighting shadows
In their haunting guise

Smiting the wicked baron
And unleash my might

When we face our final hour
In the darkest rift

Come what ever may
I'll be the death of you

After channeling my power
Your end will be swift

Now there's nothing in my way
You'll feel my deathfire grasp!

Clashing minions
Ravaged fields of war

Manifest my dominion
Total chaos restored
