You come from light years away
With your fake orange tan
You look like a carrot zombie
Who arrived in a tin can

Your space pods
Gave you a shiny new glow
Soon cancer will be all that you know

Beware of the carrot attack
These fake n bake creatures will surely attack
So beware of their unnatural skin tone
Look them in the eyes you'll turn to stone

You come from light years away
With your fake orange tan
You look like a carrot zombie
Who arrived in a tin can
Carrot Attack! Carrot Attack!
