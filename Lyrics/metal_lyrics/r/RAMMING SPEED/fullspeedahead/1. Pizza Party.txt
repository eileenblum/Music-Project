It's time to have a pizza party
It's time to have a blast
Lets thrash the shit out of this place
One slice, one slice at a time

I love pizza more than my mom

The oven scorches at 400 degrees
Hot enough to melt your face
Hot enough to melt the cheese

And when death comes knockin' at my door
I'll tell him to go to hell because I'm having a pizza party

It's time to have a pizza party
It's time to have a blast
Lets thrash the shit out of this place
One slice, one slice at a time

I love pizza more than my mom

P - I - Z - Z - A

Hey you get over here
Grab a slice and grab a beer
Hanging out with dudes that count
That's what pizza is all about
