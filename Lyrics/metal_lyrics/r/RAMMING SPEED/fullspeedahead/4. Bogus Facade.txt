Something I see below the surface
An ugliness we hide but it serves a purpose
We've been successful at keeping the oppressed
In their place because of race but still preach equality

I think it's great we accept different cultures
Won't single you out because of your color
Seems to be that things have been tainted
We've become culturally diverse without erasing the hatred

Pull this blind from our eyes
