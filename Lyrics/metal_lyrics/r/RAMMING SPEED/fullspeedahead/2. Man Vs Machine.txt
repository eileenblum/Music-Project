There's the jerk on the Blue Tooth
Oblivious to the world around him
The kid locked in his room playing
video games for hours
The online personality of prince charming,
but you'll see him in real life, he can't even
look you in the face

This technology is getting ridiculous
Let's not let this separate us

And the more we become globally connected
The more we seem to grow apart
It's man vs machine and it's rather cut throat
