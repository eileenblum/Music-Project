I've flown through clear skies on sunny days. From forty thousand feet, I've sent napalm spiraling toward the earth. I've been the bomber, not the bombed. I've set towns ablaze and destroyed the enemy below, but from where I'm seated it's nothing but blue skies. Now I'm on the receiving end; trembling and scared as the earth rips beneath me. Smoke bellows from my leveled home. Shaken, I raise my head to where the vultures feed. The dust settled, and casualties counted. Air raids over, lament has just begun. The disconnect I never knew, now a bringer of grief. Where there ever people below? Now I am one of them.
