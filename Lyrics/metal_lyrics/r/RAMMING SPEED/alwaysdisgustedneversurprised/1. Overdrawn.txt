Were your actions justified when you manipulated lives? What will we do if we've entrusted our saving with these swine? For the lower class, struggling through times of prosperity, the fight goes on. What will you do when every penny must be pinched and the economy dissolves? Will the rich be forced to find other ways to survive? What will you do? When financial interest is not for the people then what do we expect. Crooked legislation has brought us nothing but destitution.
