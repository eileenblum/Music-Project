Another night for Colonel Petrov, more concerned with getting through his shift, than atomic warfare. It was a game of nerves, who'll bomb first, leaders sweating bullets as Slayer showed no mercy. Then the screen cried "Launch! Launch!", he kept his cool, knowing that "This must be a mistake." as he sat and watched 'the end of the world' ...unaware of earth's downfall, we went along with life, business as usual.
