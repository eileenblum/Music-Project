I see no hope in the present or future. I keep hearing that they'll change in '09. The only change I see is in the poor man's cup asking if I can spare a dime. Blindly following a campaign, won't step forward and make your own change. The future must not be in one man. That's why I see no hope. Hailing as the new messiah - the weddings over now it's time to get fucked.
