Beaten and crushed by the daily grind. 
It takes more than $5.50 an hour to survive. 
People being tested on a daily basis by life's many demons and different faces. 
I have no dreamy notion of how life is supposed to be, 
but I'm mad as hell at its inconsistency. 
It's these speed trials and tribulations that make me shred hard with no regard. 
Don't be bummed if you feel like shit. 
It is what it is, no deal with it. 
If life was easy and great all the time, 
you'd never appreciate the uphill fight.
