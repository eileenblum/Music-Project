The Judgement day is drawing near. 
From the pits of hell creatures will appear. 
The stench of rotting flesh, as twelve-foot zombies march toward your death. 
Only one man dares to uphold the law. 
First name's Lazer, last name's Assault. 
He won't fight those ghouls in a court of law. 
And there's never been a battle Lazer's lost, 
He'll splatter their brains, he'll saw off their limbs. 
It's just another day at the office for him. 
In battle he takes his files, his razor sharp documents. 
Opens fire on the undead, sending them to their eternal end.
