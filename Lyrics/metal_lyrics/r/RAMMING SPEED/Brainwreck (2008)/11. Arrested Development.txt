People like the idea of feeling safe, 
but what if that feeling was not a reality? 
What if it was a misinformed belief? 
What if safety did not lead to happiness? 
What if it would lead to a life not worth living? 
What if adventure was replaced by the mundane? 
And to gain security meant to lose everything that once made you happy? 
To settle for less is to accept the status quo, 
and be convinced that such standards are appropriate. 
The surface has been only scratched. 
There's so much more to explore.
