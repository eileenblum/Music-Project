In the dead of night I prowl the skies striking fear, 
into the hearts of men who know danger is near. 
And those who cross my path never live to cross again. Protector of the last heart forged from steel. 
Heavy metal thunder, Lightning in the skies. 
Bodies torn asunder, It's heavy metal thunder. 
Hammer always at my side. 
Goat-drawn chariot I ride. 
Swinging Mjolner with all my might. 
As lightning surges in my veins and the crashing thunder reigns. 
My powers will increase, my powers will be unleashed. 
Heavy metal thunder, Lightning in the skies, Bodies torn asunder, heavy metal thunder.
