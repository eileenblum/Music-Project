How arrogant are we that we disregard past religions as 
mythology, Odin and Zeus are still just as real as they were centuries ago. 
One man's religion is another man's myth, 
while one man's myth is his religion.
If one can't accept the fact that the Valkyries are soaring in the heavens, 
Then one must accept the fact that their god, 
which ever that may be, does not exist. 
It's all or nothing when we come to question whether god exists. 
Either there are many little men living in the sky, 
or there's no miracle in the life you live. 
You live and you die and that's it
There is no heaven and there'll be no hell. 
Now think of the future and what that'll hold, 
when your gods are taught as historical myth.
