Don't keep your head in the sand, place an ear to the ground. 
Use the tools we've been given. 
Stay informed, make your own decisions.
I have little faith that my species will accomplish significant changes. 
At times I feel we're just playing out our parts. 
Biding our time till culture falls apart. 
Apathy is no friend of mine. 
I strive toward positivity. 
Focusing on what matters to me. 
Brews don't contradict my beliefs. 
So if my faith is slowly diminishing in the human race. 
What better reason to party with those who know and share my thoughts? 
Just because I'm a thrasher shouldn't be an excuse to ignore the problems of the world. 
There is no excuse.
