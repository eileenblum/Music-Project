Why has that spark been lost? 
Where have we lost our passion? 
Are we as outraged as we were forty years ago? 
At the social climate of the times. 
At decisions government made that affected our lives. 
We are part of a nation that dragged its people to foreign lands to fight for freedom and democracy. 
All in all, we face the same exact situation in the present... 
Yet there are still some links missing. 
We're more concerned with fabrics of our culture, 
rather than having passion and defiance against war. 
And for every detached, impartial opinion, 
there is another freedom taken. another life is lost. 
All in all, no man deserves to fight for a country that doesn't give a fuck if he lives or dies.
