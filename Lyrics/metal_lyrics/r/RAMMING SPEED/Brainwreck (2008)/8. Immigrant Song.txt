'Close off the border and let's build a wall. 
There's no room left for ingredients in this melting pot.
'I hear this and think where we would be without the foreign workers in this country. 
How easily we've forgotten all of the signs. 
No Irish need apply. 
No Germans allowed inside. 
Now as a country we face a new wave of immigration. 
One that will 'surely bring an end to this democracy'. 
We're so fickle with the arguments we choose. 
Many of our ancestors faced hardships when they arrived. 
So let our new immigrant amigos just live their lives.
