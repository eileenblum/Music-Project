Our soil does not know the taste of American blood, 
for we have yet to shed it. 
We have not endured the daily attacks, 
constant bombings; just exclusive terrorist acts. 
The threat does not exist. 
We fear terror, but not for the right reasons, 
for we fear it ever happening again. 
While other people fear it doesn't happen within this week. 
The threat does not exist.
