Your calluses rip as your fingers are set ablaze. 
The riffs speed past like the ghosts of hell. 
Decapitating the false with your razor sharp licks. 
You live to grind, you live to fast, you live to speed and forever blast. 
You drool all over your wretched life, 
You look like crap and smell the same. 
Wasted no time by playing slow. 
Wherever 'too fast' is happening, you will know. 
You live to grind, you live to fast, you live to speed and forever blast.
