There's the jerk on the blue tooth oblivious to the world around him. 
The kid locked in his room playing video games for too many hours. 
The on-line personality of prince charming, but in real life he can't even look you in the face. 
This technology is getting ridiculous. 
Let's not let this separate us. 
And the more we become globally connected, the more we seem to grow apart., 
It's man vs machine and it's rather cutthroat.
