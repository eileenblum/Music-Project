Disconnected, irrational, cut off from the world. 
Replaying past failures. Inventing tragedy. 
Walls, these are the walls. 
Brick by brick, I dismantle these walls. Tearing them down. 
Seeking acceptance, crippled by judgments. 
Investing too much time in how I am perceived. 
Canât live in the moment, canât shut off my head. 
Self-conscious, insecure, my own worst enemy. 
Distanced myself from my friends and family. 
Crushing anxiety, a self fulfilling prophecy. 
Walls, these are the walls. B
rick by brick, I dismantle these walls. Tearing them down. 
Searching for happiness, searching for peace within. 
Brick by brick, I dismantle these walls. Tearing them down.
