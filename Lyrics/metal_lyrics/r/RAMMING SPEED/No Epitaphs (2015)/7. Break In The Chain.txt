Looking for answers in all the wrong places. 
Wonât find a better me at the bottom of a bottle. 
Constantly stressed, thereâs a heavy weight on my chest. 
Filled with sorrow, donât seem to care if I live tomorrow. 
With each sip Iâm closer to the edge. 
Glassy eyed, can barely stand. 
Just one more drink and Iâll call it quits. 
The partyâs been over but still Iâm wanting more. 
Always chasing that buzz. 
Trying to access my feelings, Iâm mentally numb. 
Crack open another beer, that familiar sound of self-sabotage. 
With each sip Iâm closer to the edge. 
Glassy eyed, can barely stand. 
Just one more drink and Iâll call it quits. 
Canât face myself, canât face my fears. 
Goddamn it, Iâm drunk again. 
How did I get here? Something has got to change.
I feel Iâve lost control. 
Iâm weak and feeble, but can I be strong? 
Can I redefine myself? How long has it been? 
Iâve become estranged from sobriety. 
Tired of the self delusion. 
Tired of the dependency. 
Can I break this cycle? 
I want to be a break in the chain. 
Iâll face myself. 
Iâll face my fears.
