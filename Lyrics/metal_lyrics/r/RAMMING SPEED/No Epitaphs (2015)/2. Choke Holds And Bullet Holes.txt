With choke holds and bullet holes a generation is murdered in the street and thrown into jails by state thugs, trained to stereotype. 
Cold hearted pigs. Scared and weaponized. 
We will not stand down. Protesting in the streets. 
Until thereâs justice, thereâll be no peace. 
But who will history judge when the tear gas clears? 
The subjugators or the disenfranchised? 
Take this threat seriously, we will never stop fighting. 
Always adapting. We will deconstruct a state worth unraveling. 
These bastards killing with impunity. Nothing can heal a family, broken. 
We will not stand down. Protesting in the streets. 
Until thereâs justice, thereâll be no peace. No fucking peace.
