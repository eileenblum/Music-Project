Stripped of our pensions. Stripped of our pay. 
Fight to survive. To see another day. 
Abandoned by the corporate swine. 
Sold out for a bottom line. 
In cities of decay are forgotten scraps of industry. 
The result of an economy thatâs given in to entropy. 
Production has ceased. 
Itâs come to a halt. 
Praising the ones who plunder while damning the ones left behind. 
We donât exist only to produce profits for the few. 
A one world system with a one track mind. 
Intentions they donât have to hide. 
Exploitation is the name of the game. 
Lords of production, they never gave a damn. 
Beholden to no one. 
Trampling the working class. Beware our bite. 
We are the beasts of labor. 
We built your empires, we can tear them down. 
We have the strength to tip the scales, to change the tides. 
Regain control. Explore alternatives. 
We wonât fear biting the hand that feeds. 
We wonât fear biting the first that beats. 
We are the beasts of labor.
