Looking up into the sky feelings so small and insignificant, this planet weâre on, with everything that ever was. 
Every hero and every coward / Every creator and destroyer / Kings and peasants / Corrupt politicians / Every teacher of mores in the history of our species lived here / Atop this fragile crust. 
Rivers of blood spilled in the name of glory and triumph, weâre only masters on a mote of dust. 
We are alone in this great enveloping cosmic dark
There is nothing to save us from ourselves. 
The earth is the only world we know to harbor life, nowhere to migrate
This is where we make our stand. 
Rivers of blood spilled in the name of glory and triumph
Weâre only masters on a mote of dust. 
Nothing demonstrates the folly of human conceits
More than the distant images of our tiny world. 
It underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another
To preserve and cherish this pale blue dot, the only home weâre known.
