United in âguiltâ, weâre all suspects. 
âNever Say Anythingâ, all is held by the eye of providence. 
Weâre caught in a trap. 
Dots connecting our thoughts and whispers. 
Self-appointed gods, always listening. 
They work to break the code from their library of Babel. 
They can never really understand. 
We exist in light but prisms refract our freedoms. 
Covert intelligence, subverts our lives. 
What you see here. What you do here. What you hear here. 
When you leave here, donât let this stay here. 
We are the target of black rooms and wiretaps. 
Never blinking. Always watching. Always listening. 
Scanning every word, reading every message. 
Watching our lives. 
What you see here. 
What you do here. 
What you hear here. 
When you leave here, donât let this stay here. 
Beware the eye of providence.
