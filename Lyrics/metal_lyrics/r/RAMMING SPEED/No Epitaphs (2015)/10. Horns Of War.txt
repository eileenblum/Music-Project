With contempt and disdain, we send the young into the grave.
Each day a tragedy, another headline soaked in blood. 
The tired tune of war plays on as the hawks circle above. 
Another battle to proclaim, another mass grave dug. 
Opinions bought, âtruthâ is sold. 
The lecherous talking heads praise the worldwide violence. 
The failure of the fourth estate. 
I see reports based on fallacy, not fact. 
I see the puppet master pull the strings. 
The days turn to years, our enemies change form. 
I can still hear their tired tunes, their blazing horns of war. 
Another battle is proclaimed, another mass grave dug. 
Canât stand how weâre being baited towards a constant state of war. 
The military machine has a constant need to produce more bullets, tanks and shells. 
Crushing, and killing anyone labeled a threat. 
Pushing for the expansion of war, as their pockets are filled. 
With contempt and disdain we send the young to their graves. 
Attacking the ideology. 
And when the dust has settled, another battle in front of us lay, the future casualties of another decade. 
Proliferate the doctrine of security, only traitors question authority. 
Decades turn to centuries and weâre still at each otherâs throats. 
The battle hymns can still be heard, as the hawks still circle above.
