The pools of blood, broken glass, the garbage bags. 
The ungodly stench on the brink of making me wretch. 
Wandering through this maze, this labyrinth of cacophony. 
The unwanted pounding at my door, the uninvited guest. 
A fiery beast ignites where I lay my head. 
A windowless existence where time decays, canât tell if itâs night or day. Space madness sets in. This is the life that we chose. 
Piss bottles and shit stained walls, a layer of grime that wonât wash away. Wet brains and dirty mops. 
The only thing I feel is disgust for the greasy slime who runs this joint.
He can get fucked. 
Within these halls of cacophony one can enter, but one can never leave. 
The rodents and roaches, thereâs failure abound. 
In this stinking hell hole. 
This museum of sound.
