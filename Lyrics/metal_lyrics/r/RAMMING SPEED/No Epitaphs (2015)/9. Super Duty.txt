Ride on metal chariot toward the edge of time. 
On forlorn roads to nowhere, you gave the greatest sacrifice. 
You were my home when I sought shelter from the piss and the vomit and the shit that I was in. 
In my time of need, Iâd turn to you, the only thing I knew. 
Ride on metal chariot toward the edge of time. 
On forlorn roads to nowhere, you gave the greatest sacrifice. 
Iâll miss those miles we wonât get to have. 
We rode on into the night. 
Full speed ahead, blind to the warning signs, that last trip off this goddamn cliff. 
Ride on metal chariot toward the edge of time. 
Another sleepless night, with open roads under starry skies. 
With white line fever, we keep speeding on. 
No stopping now weâre close to the edge. 
We must ride on. 
We shall ride on.
