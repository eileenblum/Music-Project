Oligarchs curate the dialogue. 
Truncating the past, cleaving facts. 
Consumed by wholesale cupidity, intellect paralyzed. 
Those who dared to speak truth to power dedicated everything to a cause, for which they gave their lives. 
Sterilize the subversive narrative of the opposition.
Erased from the annals of time. Reshaping history. 
Those who dared to speak truth to power dedicated everything to a cause, for which they gave their lives. 
Their legacy pissed on. 
The truths of our past are distorted by the ones who lie.
