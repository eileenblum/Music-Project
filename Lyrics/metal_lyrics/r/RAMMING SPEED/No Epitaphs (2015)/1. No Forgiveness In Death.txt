Within a system thatâs rigid and rigged, ruled by liars and cheats.
On this quest for knowledge I find nothing but graft and scheme.
Worthless are their degrees. 
Worthless are their offerings. 
Naively chose a path with consequences, long they shall last. 
The heavy shackles of the debtors chains. 
No options for bankruptcy. 
Tied to this weight eternally. 
Wondering what could have been if I ditched out? If I didnât buy in? 
The heavy shackles of the debtors chains. 
No rest for the living. 
No forgiveness in death. 
Sowing the seeds of the next catastrophe through predatory lending on the young. 
Day after day, Iâm falling behind, exposing the threadbare economic faÃ§ade. 
The heavy shackles of the debtors chains. 
No rest for the living. 
No forgiveness in death. 
Worthless. Worthless are their offerings.
