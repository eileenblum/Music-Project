Scattered debris
A failed attempt at democracy
Duties fulfilled
and roles played

Silver tongued snakes utter hollow promises
Bedevil the tortured, bedevil the insane

In riot gear
armed to the teeth
"Protect and serve":
an oath that's never been

Battle lines drawn
Suppress the masses
Crushing their voice
Grinding dissent

Have we gone astray?
Or were we fucked from the start?

The recognition of living in a state
in which your rights are granted and nothing guaranteed

Silver tongued devils torture the insane
