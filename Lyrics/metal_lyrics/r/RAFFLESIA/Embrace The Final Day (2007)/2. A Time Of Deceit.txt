Darkness compels you
Your whole live is one lie
How can I see your face when it's veiled behind darkness?
How can I trust the one who took it all away from me?

BE WHO YOU ARE, DO AS YOU PLEASE, THE TRUTH IS GOING TO BRING YOU DOWN TO YOUR KNEES!

In a time of deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
Common sense will strike you down.

You have the power of taking, but we have the power of giving.
You have the power of deceit, we have the power of truth.

In a world of chaos, order will bring back life!

LIFE IS A QUEST FOR TRUTH that we should all succeed.
I keep on writing these words, wishing truth would reveal itself!

PAGES OF LIES, STORIES UNFOLD!
