As the rage is fed
As the blood has been shed
Hours of pain, my soul seeks for this...
This place, embrace, this silence, this moment...

We all forgot
The breeze of the wind
The smell of trees
The warmth of the sun
So pure as crystal water

For I thought this battle was endless
For I thought this darkness was forever!!!

When the tears have dried
When wounds have been healed
That's when you realize
Your mind will have scars of...
THIS RAGE, THIS WAR, THIS PAIN IT HAS DIED
Now it's time for clarity

FOR I THOUGHT THIS BEAST WE CREATED WOULD NEVER DIE

For the sun
For you
I lay myself to rest
