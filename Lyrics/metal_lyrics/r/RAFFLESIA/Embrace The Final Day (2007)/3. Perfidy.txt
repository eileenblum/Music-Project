ANGER MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL, now that I think of what you did!!!

Feelings of wrath endulge me, from hell I will stab thee.

LET WAR THUNDER!!!

The skies are clouded, a pall of fear will come over you tonight.
No place to hide, nowhere to shelter: now we will have our VENGEANCE!

From hell I will stab thee, we will have vengeance.

Now in this dark night
All noise is stilled
My heart is pounding
I smell the fear
Your cold embrace calms me
IT HAS BEGUN...

Blood is flowing, this storm cannot be yield...
PERFIDY COMES WITH A PRICE!
