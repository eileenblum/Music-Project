We build a lot of memorials
But seem to have forgotten why
While we use stone (and metal) to commemorate
Other use it TO MAKE PEOPLE DIE

Within your war of terror
You have forgotten the truth of being free
The stench of death
The colour of blood

I REFUSE TO BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO DIE TO BE FREE
I refuse to take the path of violence to justify

Within your quest for power
You have forgotten
The stench of death
The cries for silence
The price of lives

USE YOUR EYES
CLEAR YOUR MIND
Don't let greed blind your sight

So many lives destroyed
What's left to commemorate
Is just
BITTERNESS
