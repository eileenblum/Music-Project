TIME TO RISE
WE'LL BREAK YOUR SUPREMACY
NO LONGER WILL WE BE LIKE PAWNS... ON YOUR SALIENT

It's time to reap your soul!
No more secrecy, it's time to break your reign.
No more violations, it's time to break your reign.
No more lies!

TIME TO END YOUR OPPRESSION
TIME TO TURN YOUR CONTENT INTO A BLOODSHED

A tempest of justice will pass over you.
This will determine a new epoch.
We'll exert until we triumph.
Time to your advances, a violent storm unleashed.

The authority brought down...
THE HUNTER BECOMES THE HUNTED
THE SCAPEGOAT BECOMES THE JUDGE

No more of your lies
Now is the time
To step aside
