Fear and courage do me great injury
As they struggle within me...

The pride inside is torn
My victory is twarthed by these two rivals

My flesh is burning, blood sweat and tears
The stench is somehow familiar

Within my chest, that which desires my glory will win the battle for my soul.

What pierces my heart, at this dreadful sight, what bitter sorrow.
