Another innocence is spoiled
Another life is shed
Conquer over the weak
Marching over their dreams

BLAME THE ONES WITH POWER OVER ALL
JUDGE THE ONES WITHOUT COMMON SENSE

Traitors to life
Traitors to the world

Dust in their eyes
Blood on their hands
When I close my sight
I SEE THE WORLD... DEAD!

When I reach my hands, I feel the cold sense of murder.

You pretend it's OK
Without remorse, without regret
I feel disgust in your presence
MAY SWORDS RISE OVER YOUR HEAD

As you suffer
IT IS MY TIME TO GRIN
As you succumb
It's time for the weak to take back life

FEELS LIKE I'M ON A PATH WITH NO GLORY BUT DEATH
