This is for all your sins.
THERE'S NO TIME FOR ABSOLUTION...

And by the time you'll understand IT'S TOO LATE
Your palms are NAILED TO THE CROSS!!!
Lives and hopes, destroyed and murdered.

Dark rivers of blood, fields of hope...
Strangled by your hands.
Dreams of glory, killed by your lies!

This is for all your sins.
THERE'S NO TIME FOR FORGIVENESS...
This is for all your sickness and misery!

THIS IS YOUR CROSS
THIS IS YOUR PUNISHMENT

A crown of bleeding roses
Will be perched over your head
And the nails through your palms
Will forgive YOU!
