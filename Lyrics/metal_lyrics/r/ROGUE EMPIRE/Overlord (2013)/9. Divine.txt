The journey has commenced down this golden path.
One foot in front of the other, eyes straight ahead and determined.
Yet, cognizant of the truth that appears around me.
Raising the curtain to let the sun set me free.
Everything needed is within, the key to every door.
Trust in intuition, awaken your mind's eye to see.
The door you must unlock to bathe in the Light.
The mystery unraveling. Escaping the darkness.
My body is just a vessel to experience this world.
My mind is not who I am, moving beyond this physical realm.
I am Divine.
My ego is lifted as Consciousness takes me over.
Sensory perception exceeding explanation.
Everything is beyond comprehension, released from the solid dimension.
My astral body embarks on it's ascension.
Floating through the void, which exists an infinite potential.
Love resonates a vibrational energy that will bring us in harmony to our original state.
Love releases the frequency of harmony, love is the only truth.
Love is true freedom. Spread your light through the void.
Raising the curtain, let love set me free.
Love sets me free.
