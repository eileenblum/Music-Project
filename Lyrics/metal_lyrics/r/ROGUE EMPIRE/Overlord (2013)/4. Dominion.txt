We are the ones that will take your soul.

Reality held in the hands of our masters.The world united through war, fabricated disaster. Their grasp reaches 'round the Earth.Penetrating gaze of the one-eyed sentinel, watching you play it's game.In the crosshairs of the Dominion, quelling all dissenting opinion. Chosen to lead by their own breed. Too late to secede, as they watch you bleed. We can't turn the clocks back, and we'll never change the fact that. We've been lead down a one way road, with no return to the way things were. We've lost control, our minds and souls are not our own. We've lost everything we've known.

Our consciousness, enslaved from a higher place. Fallen from grace, from the ones who gave us life.
The veil has been lifted, life has shifted.
Revealed to you the changes of our existence.

It will never be the same. We have only ourselves to blame.
Sacrifice your freedom at the flame. Life will never be the same.Time to bite the bullet, it's the end of the game.
