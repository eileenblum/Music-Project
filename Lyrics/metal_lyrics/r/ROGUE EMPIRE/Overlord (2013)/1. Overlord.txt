It looks as though the sixth trumpet has sounded, deaf to the orchestra that lead to this.
A grim road of revelation, we ignored 'till we were wrought with privation.
Too proud to accept that we're slaves. The bars are easy to see now (that) we're halfway to our graves.
The smell of gunpowder sits heavy on the air, 5.56mm casings coat town square.
To maintain a firm grasp, a culling of the nations has commenced.
Riding steel horses that breathe fire like Dragons, the puppets carry out their slaughter.
Public execution, raping of the Constitution. It's history repeating, witness the new Final Solution.
You are not free just 'cause you can't see your shackles. The American Dream was always just a nightmare.
Welcome to the collapse, I'm glad you could make it
We tiptoed very loudly, no way you could have mistaken it.
Foot through the door.Â  Face to the floor. Just can't ignore this New World Order.
A man can't ride another man's back unless it's bent. Open your mind, seek the truth and realize.
You are not free (just) 'cause you can't see your shackles.
This is real. Can't conceal. It's all around us.
We've been gutted, torn to the bone.
The Overlord sits smiling on his throne.
