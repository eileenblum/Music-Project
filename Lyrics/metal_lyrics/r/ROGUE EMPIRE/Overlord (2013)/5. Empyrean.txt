They seeded us from the constellations. Descended from the heavens to form their creation.
They interbred with us to create the Dragon bloodlines.
We are the children of the stars.Â  Born to serve the keepers of the mysteries.
The serpent extends from the Pharaoh's third eye, submit to his divine right to rule.
In the ages of the ancients, we walked with the gods on the island paradise.
We walked with the gods in the golden age of man. Our senses unhampered, trusting in the divine plan.
A cosmic lightning bolt crashes, stripping the harmony between the Earth and the Heaven, causing chaos.
A Schism in the energetic environment, thus reflecting in the mundane hologram.
Extirpated from the ancient ways, the land that what you once called your own submerged, and shifted, to form this new existence.
What it was then, and what it is now, no longer acquiesce.
We re-emerged to reclaim humanity for ourselves.
Like a fly, caught in the spiders web. Sheep following the snake with no independent path to take.
An entire world diverged in the blink of an eye.Â  Through the downpour it's easy to spot Draco in the sky.
Was all this just coincidence? Some kind of tragic fate?
Or are the divines who left us to drown responsible?
Was this always planned? The gods are the ones with the blood on their hands.
The Schism will be reversed. Until then we haven't seen the worst.
