Demons approaching. Slipping from Consciousness, only an owl is visible.
Snatching your body, hijacking your mind. Taken away, waking up restrained.
Eyes I dare not meet in dreams gazing down at me. Choking on a silent scream.
Collecting and splicing DNA to create their perfect race.
They've come and brought the light to benight us in their ploy.
We weren't ready for what was given, they knew we'd use it to destroy.
Destroy our world. Destroy each other. The scheme is not what it seems.
What comes from the heavens, comes from dimensions.
What comes from the heavens, encanted from the dimensions.
The Dark Spirits, in their cosmic vessels, descended from the realms to teach the few of their secrets.
In return for our submission and worship, they dug our graves. The apple was just the first step.
We brought technology and you've taken the bait.
It is time, they are ready to open the gate.
Collide the particles, open the door to your world.
Worship us as gods, give us your acclaim. Drop to your knees or face the flame.
The countdown has hit zeroes.
Checkmate. You've sealed your fate. The human race has fallen from grace.
There's no savior, there's no faith. Stripped of your light you bear only shame.
The Deceivers have arrived. They've contrived to lure those not aware of their nature.
