We were forced to awaken from our apathy.Â  Blind to the world that we should have seen.
This freedom was always just a fallacy.
Blinded by faith and greed, we've fallen right into place. Rise up before it's too late.
Starving for a glimmer of hope.
We're praying for a saving grace, sitting on our hands they go unanswered.
Clawing at a wall we'll never climb, we'll never break free, entrapped in the barrier.
Charon rows us to our end. The coin is on our eyes. Our soul: theirs to spend.
Bound to the alter of (the) Nocturnal Angel, surrounded by the Sons of Cain.
Ritual of the powerful to absorb you. Be sure your god isn't the same one you pray to before you burn.
The smoke of your sacrifice fills your lungs.Â  They will read the signs in your burned effigy.
Collecting your ashes to transcend all care.Â  Once again midsummer sets us free.
The sun has risen on a new era, and it will never set again. This is the New Dawn.
Charon rows us to our end.Â  The coin is on our eyes. Our soul: theirs to spend.
The path to our future: lit with the darkest of lights.
Falling in line, led by the divine, this is our fate and theirs no end in sight.
