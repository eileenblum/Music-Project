One nation, under god we trust.Â  Where the scales of justice have come to rust.
A republic of distrust, I'll show you fear in a handful of dust.
False flag domestic terrorism: a bullshit lie to disarm a nation.
False dissenters, placed among us, bring us to confrontation.
They wish to tread on our voices, to cause our abdication.
A mind shattered like glass. Blacked out, sent by the brass.
Working to fulfill the elites agenda and enact an instigation.
Attempts to ignite a conflagration. Working to divide, a bifurcation.
Foreboding scent on this dying nation, you can almost taste it as the atmosphere turns a deep red.
String draws back, bow pulled to the limit. Mirror shatters inside my head.
Simple silence, into violence, fully embracing the split.
Come on motherfucker you'll be buried six feet under me.
Shells hitting the ground around my feet, (a) break in my consciousness. Objective Complete.
A massacre in need of a scapegoat, blind masses demanding justice.
Drugged and thrown to the wolves. Branded as the enemy to please a nation. Sent to a life of incarceration.
INHALE.
Breathing new life.
Captors staring lifeless, soulless, like machines.
Used to initiate a martial order. Forced to view this wretched scene.
Am I dreaming? Piercing my ears, all I hear is my own screaming.
A sight outside to collapse resolve. A populous crushed, liberty dissolved.
In the void, no light seeps through. Hate emboldened, a vivid hue.
Atmosphere turns a deep red. String draws back, bow pulled to the limit.
I will not succumb to this dread. Trust in the spirit.
Absolution, resurrected to stir a dissolution.
Opening the path, breaking this occlusion.
Hate filled their flame. Resolution, enlightened, marching towards.
Revolution.
