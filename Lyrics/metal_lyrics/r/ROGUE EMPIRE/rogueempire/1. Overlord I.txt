Deep beneath the sand and steel, there is a world waiting to be revealed.
Is this hell am I nothing but your slave? I know that Iâm not meant to live this way.
Wake me up from this nightmare, I canât be living.
No, this canât be real.
Your system is failing, now watch it all come down.
Let me paint a better picture then the one that youâve drawn.
Youâre nothing but a plague, when will you be gone?
Beneath the sky of an absent god,
How many have to die until you have to admit that youâre wrong?
We have lit the path to our future, with the darkest of lights.
Inescapable dependence. Inescapable life.
We have engineered our very existence.
We are nothing but slaves.
Veins turned to wires, have we all lost control?
I fear our minds are not our own.
