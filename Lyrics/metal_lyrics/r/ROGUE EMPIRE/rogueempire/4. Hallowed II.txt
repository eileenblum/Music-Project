This is what it all comes down to, nothing but me and you!
This is what it all comes down to, nothing but...
This is what it all comes down to, me and you.
I fear no man, no god, no pain that you could ever cause.
No matter how hard it gets, weâll never turn away.
Weâll never back down, never stop fighting.
As long as there is any hope that things can change.
Iâll strive to be a better man, strive to find a better way.
For so many years weâve been here drowning in a pool of our blood.
For so long, Iâve been captive in shackles.
Chained to the wall, my life is not my own. I am not a soulless man.
Iâll do whatever it takes to get my life back.
Am I only some lifeless vessel? Am I only some lifeless drone?
What I would give if I could mend all of the things youâve done.
If I could go back and right all the wrongâ¦
Instead I am stuck in this war, and there is nowhere left to run.
In this empty place weâll echo across the air waves.
Our sound will always be the hand around your throat.
Choking the air from your lungs.
You better cherish every breath, for it could be your last.
Choking, choking on your tongue until it all fades out.
I am everything theyâve read you stories about.

I am hell.
I am endless agony.
I am penance.
I am death.

The final consequence for all your careless actions.
Until the day that I die, before I close my eyes,
Just know that I will always hunt you down.
Iâll never rest until youâre dead and gone.
I am infinity and I am your demise.
