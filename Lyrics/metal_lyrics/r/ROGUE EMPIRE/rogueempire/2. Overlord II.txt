We would feel the fear, if we could only feel at all.
We have all become mindless drones, nothing more than idle machines.
How much more can we push? How much further can we go?
How much more can we take from a world we used to know?
We have built this panopticon, beneath the throne of our mechanical leader.
Blindly we fall into chains of despair.
You have everything to lose.
We have everything to gain.
Surrender your Will to our command.
âHail to the Throne!â
For we are more than gods.
We are your Overlords!
Our only enemy is ourselves.

Overlords.

Our only fault is self-destruction.
