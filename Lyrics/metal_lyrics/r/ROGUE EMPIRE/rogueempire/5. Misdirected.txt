In this endless ocean with no ship to sail,
Are we even headed in the right direction?
I feel so anxious, I feel so helpless.
This awful paranoiaâs taking over me.
Breathe, just breathe, this canât be happening.
Feel the wind at your back, and the warmth of the sun on your face,
Soon it will all be gone.
We are the hands writing the final chapter,
Turning the page because we know we must go on,
And through the darkness, through all this emptiness,
Weâll be the light tonight to guide you all back home.
Please, Iâm begging, please!
Take your handâs from my neck and allow me to breathe.
I am not mechanical, but I am your creator.
I brought you in and I can take you out.
I am all around you, I am everything.
No matter what you do. No matter where you go.
How can you sleep at night?
How can your conscience find the peace to let you close your eyes?
Just like a disease, Iâm spreading through your body.
How long until Iâm in control of everything?
You are an infection desperate for a cure,
you are an abomination.
You donât deserve the life you have and I will gladly take it back.
Tell me how does it feel to watch the hell you built slowly fall apart?
Beneath your falsely feet, beneath your false led feet.
I know that I am meant to change and bring the world around,
I know that I am meant to change the world.
This is the closest to heaven that youâll ever see.
This life is beautiful, this life means everything to me.
Beneath your hate, your greed,
I know that hope will set us free.
Maybe someday we will all work together,
Maybe one day we will all exist as one.
Now more than ever, I hope for a brighter way,
Than the one thatâs been laid out before us.
My motivation is what beats inside me,
And my determination forces me to be everything.
We must become, we must become the change we wish to see.
In this endless ocean with no ship to sail,
Are we even headed in the right direction?
I feel so anxious, I feel so helpless.
This awful paranoiaâs taking over me.
