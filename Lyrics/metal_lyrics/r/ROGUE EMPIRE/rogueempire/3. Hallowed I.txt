Carve me hollow and fill me with your disease.
Weâre not the people we are supposed to be.
This existence isnât permanent; weâre merely images that will all disappear.
Theyâve taken everything. All we know is gone.
You left me behind to die, without a chance to survive.
Tell me thereâs a way, and that weâll all get out alive.
Tell me thereâs a way and that we'll all get through this.
Tell me are we all alone. Tell me I need to know, I feel so far from home.
Murdered by the hands of the world that sheltered us.
Murdered by the ones who swore that theyâd always protect us.
Blinded by your false sense of justice, youâre driven by greed.
Taking lives by the thousands like knives to our throats. Spilling blood till it all comes out.
I believe itâs time that we cut the head right off the fucking king.
And when there is no one left standing,
Iâll take your throne and burn it to the ground.
