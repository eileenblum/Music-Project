[Featuring Hank Williams III]

I've been cool for far too long
Just a matter of time before I break I took more shit than I wanted to take
You can't look me in the eyes
Somethings gone wrong and you know I know I'm like a stick of dynamite ready to blow
I just can't accept your lies no more
It ain't my fault that you can't take it just ain't cool if you have to fake it

Don't threaten me just pack your trash
And don't let the door hit you in the ass
Get outta my life!

Get up get gone I gotta keep on keeping on
Too much pain and too much strife up yours
Get outta my life!
Get up get gone I gotta keep on keeping on
Too much pain and too much strife up yours
Get outta my life!

I ain't gonna be cool no more
You took advantage of my whole deal this ain't about you it's the way I feel
Nothing's ever good enough
Your never satisfied heard it all before when you give all you got you can't give no more
It's too late to change my mind
I can't turn back the hands of time you should have noticed the danger sign

Don't threaten me just pack your trash
And don't let the door hit you in the ass
Get outta my mother fucking life!

Get up get gone I gotta keep on keeping on
Too much pain and too much strife up yours
Get outta my life!
Get up get gone I gotta keep on keeping on
Too much pain and too much strife up yours
Get outta my life!

Get up get gone I gotta keep on keeping on
Too much pain and too much strife up yours
Get outta my life!
Get up get gone I gotta keep on keeping on
Too much pain and too much strife up yours
Get outta my life!
