Country music stars like the catchy bars
They smoke a lot of weed
Yeah, those country singers like to catch their buzz
They love to drink whiskey

Shotgun-Willie he got popped on the highway
With a roach of that dealie in his ashtray
Them cocaine cowboys just don't feel right unless they're high

Cowboys do more dope
Than rock 'n' rollers
I wonder if cowboys do more dope
Than rock 'n' rollers

Those long-haired rednecks like to pack their nose
They do a lot of blow
Those dog roofers like to take acid trips
They love to go fast, not slow

Behind that clean face in the closet hooked on freebase
Lurks another up-and-coming star
Them cranked up cowboys just don't feel right unless they're high, high

Cowboys do more dope
Than rock 'n' rollers
I wonder if cowboys do more dope
Than rock 'n' rollers

Cowboys do more dope
Than rock 'n' rollers
Do you think cowboys do more dope
Than rock 'n' rollers?

Listen up, people
Don't take the purple acid
You'll have to get down off them towers
