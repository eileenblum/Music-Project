Talk about Indian rights and wrongs sing a few more freedom songs
Look to the spirit, ride the wind let's not walk that trail of tears again

Digging up our sacred grounds won't you leave the dead alone
Let the eagle fly and the buffalos roam and give us back our home

Cherokee cry
Cherokee cry
Cherokee cry
Cherokee cry

Right up front I want my freedom back
I know about Geronimo's Cadillac
That's how you got us on the reservation don't talk to me about segregation

Digging up our sacred grounds won't you leave the dead alone
Let the eagle fly and the buffalos roam and give us back our home

Cherokee cry
Cherokee cry
Cherokee cry
Cherokee cry
Set me free, yeah

Cry, oh, Cherokee cry
Cry, oh, Cherokee cry
Cry, oh, Cherokee cry
Cry, oh, Cherokee cry
