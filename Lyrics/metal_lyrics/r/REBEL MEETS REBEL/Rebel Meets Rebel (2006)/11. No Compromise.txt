[Spoken:]
This is David Allan Coe and the Cowboys From Hell, and everything we do, we do 110%.
That's the bottom line, and that means no compromise.

[Sung:]
I'm guilty,
Nut I'll drink myself innocent
Recklessly honest,
But I'm content
I ain't scared of nothin',
I'm in control
I am my own master,
Nobody owns my soul

No compromise
No compromise
No compromise
No compromise

I'm innocent,
But I'll drink till I'm guilty
You live in a state of confusion
I live in ahe state of Texas
You follow some leader,
I follow my mind
That's what happens, my friend
When the blind leads the blind

No compromise
No compromise
No compromise
No compromise

When it comes, just break it
Ow, bottom's up

No compromise
No compromise
No compromise
No compromise
Never!
