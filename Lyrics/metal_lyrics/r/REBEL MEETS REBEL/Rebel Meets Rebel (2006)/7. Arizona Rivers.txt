When you're young
You wanna believe
Believe in love

Believe in everything

Time
Seems to be on your side
When you're young
And in love

Time
To move along, baby
I've got this feelin' something's going on

I can't make my mind up
When I do
I tell you, baby I'll be through with you

I feel a heart ache comin' on
I feel a heart ache comin' on
I feel a heartbreak
And it's coming on strong
