We have one nanosecond In the spectrum of time
Cause it's about the dead It's all in your mind

Reality, senility human race, outer space
My head's about to overload

Explode, explode

Alien forces live inside my brain
I must obey them or I'll go insane

Procreation, concentration penetration, ejaculation
My head's about to overload

Explode, explode
Explode, explode

Cold shots on the rocks
You know how it makes me feel
You better see, set me free
Don't give me no better deal
Anagram, sonogram
Looking for a thing that's real
All for sale, new ghost town

Time is something you can't steal
Time is something you can't steal
Time is something you can't steal

This black painted sign says: "Jesus saves"
Ride on the highways to an early grave

Remorse, intercourse voices from my alien force
My head's about to overload

Explode, explode

Cowboys From Hell on the radio
Turn it up now just as loud as it will go

Guitar bastards, cymbal crashers
Strobe light flashin', motel bashin'
My head's about to overload

Explode, explode
Explode, explode

Cold shots on the rocks
You know how it makes me feel
You better see, set me free
Don't give me no better deal
Anagram, sonogram
Looking for a thing that's real
Ultrasound, vocals down

Time is something you can't steal
Time is something you can't steal
Time is something you can't steal

We have one nanosecond in the spectrum of
Time is something you can't steal

Time is something you can't steal
Time is something you can't steal

Time is something you can't steal
Time is something you can't steal

We have one nanosecond in the spectrum of time

Time is something you can't steal
