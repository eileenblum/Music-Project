I don't make promises that I can't keep
Got to keep movin', got no time to sleep
Don't talk to me about my future plans
It's time to go, I'm into one nite stands

I'm into one nite stands
I'm into one nite stands
If you want wedding rings to put on your hands
Don't look at me I'm into one nite stands

Ride the highways like a man possessed
I got this demon here inside my chest
I'm hard to satisfy, you understand?
I need some love, I'm into one nite stands

I'm into one nite stands
I'm into one nite stands
If you want wedding rings to put on your hands
Don't look at me I'm into one nite stands

Play, Dime!

I play some football, like my younger days
Then our ol' Hendrix sing Purple Haze
That's when I put together my first band
And now I'm only into one nite stands

I'm into one nite stands
I'm into one nite stands
If you want wedding rings to put on your hands
Don't look at me I'm into one nite stands

One nite stands
