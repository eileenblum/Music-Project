[Featuring Joey Floyd]

We raise a lot of hell, drink a lot of booze
Don't need a damn reason for the things we do
So break out the bottles and bring on the crowd
Exercise your freedom, rowdy and loud

Get down, let's jam
All night, that's right

Rebel meets rebel
And that means trouble
Rebel meets rebel
Double trouble

Rebel meets rebel, man to man
Renegade singer, outlaw band
Rebel meets rebel

Quitters looking back, 'cos there ain't nothin' to hide
It's just a get-together pf country/metal minds
Could it be the future, a sign of the times?
When rebel meets rebel, we're partners in crime

Get down, let's jam
All night, that's right

Rebel meets rebel
And that means trouble
When rebel meets rebel
Double trouble

Rebel meets rebel, we've got our pride
Like old Hank said, it's been a long hard ride
When rebel meets rebel
