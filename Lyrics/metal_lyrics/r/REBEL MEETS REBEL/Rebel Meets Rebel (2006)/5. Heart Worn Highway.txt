On this Heart Worn Highway
Into the heat of night
Look in your rearview mirror
Tucson is out of sight

Headin' for Oklahoma
Texas is still ahead
Face on a Wanted poster
Wanted alive or dead

Destined to die an outlaw
Braggin' in every town
Two steps ahead of danger
Waiting to bring you down

Cling to your loaded pistol
Keep it right by your side
Haul ass on Heart Worn, run away
This could be your last ride

I was on Heart Worn Highway
Too late to turn back now
You made the bed you lay in
And they'll find your trail somehow

You just gotta keep on runnin'
From all the things you've done
Out on that Heart Worn Highway
You'll never buy the gun

Destined to die an outlaw
Braggin' in every town
Two steps ahead of danger
Waiting to bring you down

Cling to your loaded pistol
Keep it right by your side
Out on some Heart Worn Highway
This could be your last ride

Destined to die an outlaw
Confined in every town
Two steps ahead of danger
Waiting to bring you down

Cling to your loaded pistol
Now, keep it right by your side
Out on some Heart Worn Highway
This could be your last ride
