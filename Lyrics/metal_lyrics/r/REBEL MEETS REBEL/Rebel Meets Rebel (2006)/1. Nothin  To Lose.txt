I am a gambler god knows I've been around
I've lived it up now I'm livin' it down
I've played some hunches, and I've played some blues
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

I thought my woman was my ace in the hole
But when she left me I was out of control
I've just had bad luck since I got the news
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

Old lady luck ain't nobody's friend
And old dame fortune broke my heart in the end
Love was the one thing I tried not to abuse

A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

I like casinos and I love slot machines
I lost a fortune if you know what I mean
Those one armed bandits was the wrong thing to choose
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

You wanna help me do you know where I'm at
Don't try to change me girl it's to late for that
You say quit gamblin' and I'll have to refuse
A man with nothing ain't got nothing to lose

I lost it all I don't have no more to give
The doctor tells me I don't have long to live
My friends all say they'd hate to be in my shoes

A man with nothin' ain't got nothing to lose

You say salvation is the one thing I need
Its hell or heaven that I'm just a bad seed
What makes you think you have the right to accuse

A man with nothin' ain't got nothin' to lose

Nothin' to lose
Nothin' to lose
Nothin' to lose
