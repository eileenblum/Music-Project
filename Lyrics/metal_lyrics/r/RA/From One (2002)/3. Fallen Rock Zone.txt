Who do you see standing beside you
Your shadow's me, and you are mine
What do you want you sick, little pervert
I'll hunt you down for all of time

A fallen rock zone
A broken back bone
I want to hear you scream into your cell phone
You're just a traitor, eleventh grader
A cyber sex addicted masturbator

Cowardly punk, you make me nauseous
Misguided fool, you have no balls
Stalking young girls, preying on weakness
Bent on a life with bars for walls

A fallen rock zone
Stealing my tongue
I want to hear you scream into your cell phone
You're just a traitor, eleventh grader
A cyber sex addicted masturbator [2x]

Yeah we've all seen it before, how some people just... hunt and prey on women
The next time you see a guy put his hands on a girl and she don't want
Him to put his hands on her, you tell him he's a punk, you tell him
He's a punk!

A fallen rock zone
A broken back bone
I want to hear you scream into your cell phone
You're just a traitor, eleventh grader
A cyber sex addicted masturbator [4x]
