She asked me out
I thought there'd be no harm in dating
But soon her eyes would cut me like a piece of broken glass
And deep inside I felt myself disintegrating
I then found out what it's like to pay for someone's past

So tell me who's to blame for the pain you're giving me
So tell me who's to blame?
Is it you or is it me?

When we made love at first it seemed like God was coaching
As time went on it became a way to keep me in my place
No more respect. No more passion. No more lovers doting
Two people cursed. So pissed and sad
It's written on their face

So tell me who's to blame for the pain you're giving me
So tell me who's to blame?
Is it you or is it me?
So tell me who's to blame for the pain you're giving me
So tell me who's to blame?
Is it you or is it me?

I don't wanna feel this way
But I can't stop thinking
I can't stop feeling
I wish that things were right
I wanted to be with you
But I will never be enough

And you would never, ever, let me BE!!

Yeah!

So tell me who's to blame for the pain you're giving me
So tell me who's to blame?
Is it you or is it me?
So tell me who's to blame for the pain you're giving me
So tell me who's to blame?

Was it you?
Was it you?
So tell me who's to blame
Ohhh
Was it you?
Was it me?
