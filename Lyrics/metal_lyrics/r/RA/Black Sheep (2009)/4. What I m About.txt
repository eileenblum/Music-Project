As I lie awake at night
And think of how I used to dream
I remember how it felt
When I used to feel like me

The world can never understand
Perfection in a broken man

You know me inside-out:
What makes me tick; what I'm about
You know me inside-out:
My bleeding heart; my world of doubt
What I'm about...

Did you ever think you saw
From the corner of your eye
Something said but then it's gone
Like a shadow passing by

My heart beats with a killer's rage
The vision of a future range

You know me inside-out:
What makes me tick; what I'm about
You know me inside-out:
My perfect life; my world of doubt

You know me; you make me
Destroy me; create me
Perfect me; degrade me
Won't somebody save me?

You know me inside-out
What makes me tick; what I'm about
You know me inside-out
My beating heart; my world of doubt
What I'm about...
What I'm about...
