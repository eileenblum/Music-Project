Killer Ra

Do you think Iâm a fool?
A footstool, a dead weight, letâs get one thing straight
while you fornicate I show you respect
I Get wrecked Catch your lies in my redirect

Itâs so sad that you tryin to deny it
If you wonât tell the truth then Iâll pry it
You had sex and I wasnât invited
Iâd like to know how this was decided.

[Chorus]
Itâs alright; itâs ok
I donât care if you cheat on me today
Iâm broken; disgusted
Iâd still love you if you werenât so busted!

So now you still call.
Stand to fall you carry on about how I meant nothing but you gotta get real,
how I feel for you is black, you pull your knife outta my back

Damn girl you gonna cheat on me feed on me and try to act sweet on me
youâre so dumb I can see right through you you couldnât pay me to do you

I hope that when youâre fifty and your eyes ainât so nifty
you think back about what you done,
you think long and hard about playing me dirty acting flirty getting some

I know you with another man now well two can play that game
Her name is Betty. Weâve been goin steady
And by the way she hates you already

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Whatâs that
who you lookin at
whatcha looking at
who you looking at now? [6x]

[Chorus]
