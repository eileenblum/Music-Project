I am The champ
I'm just a relative of The last one
Settin' up rules
No time to shake-down
Don't need but a moment to blast one
This is how we roll
So full of soul
The befounding fathers be delivered
No chemistry is inside of me
Opponents be start to shiver while they sleep

I have seen yer state of being, you wish The world with a tainted soul
I have held The tip that children have, The fear I can't say no
And I have heard The call of graphics comin out of my tv
And I refuse to let it darken inbetween whats real in me

Callin' all The known nations
you gotta push The push The invasion
so when ya kick it up
ya kick it up
ya kick it up
as we rock The foundation
(as we rock The foundation)

My mind is always on The run
To and fro' in oblivion
Simplified The urban family, yeah
Fight a war against social insanity

Calling all The known nations
you gotta push The push The invasion
so when ya kick it up
ya kick it up
ya kick it up
as we rock The foundation
(as we rock The foundation)

Calling all The known nations
you gotta push The push The invasion
so when ya knock it down
ya knock it down
ya knock it down
as we rock The foundation
(as we rock The foundation)

Your life is only what you can make of it, yeah yeah
And you have got The golden keys

Push it out The street, to The sewer
Enemies will grow, few to fewer
Step past and call on all nations
Dance as we rock on all stations
Feel it in yer bones
Shake it down
Rise above it all
Drop yer frown
Fall onto your knees, hands held high up
Smoke we add fuel, to The fire

Calling all The known nations
you gotta push The push The invasion
so when ya kick it up
ya kick it up
ya kick it up
as we rock The foundation
(as we rock The foundation)

Calling all The known nations
you gotta push The push The invasion
so when ya knock it down
ya knock it down
ya knock it down
as we rock The foundation
(as we rock The foundation)

Calling all The known nations
you gotta push The push The invasion
so when ya kick it up
ya kick it up
ya kick it up
as we rock The foundation
(as we rock The foundation)

Calling all The known nations
you gotta push The push The invasion
so when ya knock it down
ya knock it down
ya knock it down
as we rock The foundation
(as we rock The foundation)
