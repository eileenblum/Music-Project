And when you think its over
Is when it starts again
No one seems to understand
How to make this torture end
And with your hands committed
And the pain is real
You should know its not your fault

[Chorus:]
Its not in your mind
Its not in your head
Its not in the words that your family said
Its not in your mind
Its not in your head
Its not in your thoughts as you lie there... in bed

And so you close your eyes now
Imagine living free
You remember how it was
How it was supposed to be
No one seems to love you
No one seems to care
You enact a morbid wish
To see if someone is there

[Chorus:]
Its not in your mind
Its not in your head
Its not in the words that your family said
Its not in your mind
Its not in your head
Its not in your thoughts as you lie there... in bed

When time is in your pocket
And you've got no where to go
Let the moment take you higher
Light a fire in the snow
Maybe love was all you wanted
Maybe pain was all you found
Your wings will never save you
With your feet chained to the Ground

[Chorus 2x:]
Its not in your mind
Its not in your head
Its not in the words that your family said
Its not in your mind
Its not in your head
Its not in your thoughts as you lie there... in bed
