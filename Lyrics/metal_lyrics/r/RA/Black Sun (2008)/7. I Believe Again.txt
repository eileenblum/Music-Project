You opened up a door and showed a distant light
Delightful eyes that hold the world in grey and white
Romantic arms designed to empty out my heart
Creative joy, dynamic love right from the start

I believe in a world that can take you high
I believe in a thought that can touch the sky
I believe in peace and harmony
I believe that you belong to me

Collective mind I underestimate the sun
In everything in everywhere in everyone
Semantic goals I disregard the simple truth
I trade my fear, I trade my hurt in for my youth

If only I could hide you every day
I could undertake a larger mission
I know that you and I is hard to say
But broken pieces can be whole again
