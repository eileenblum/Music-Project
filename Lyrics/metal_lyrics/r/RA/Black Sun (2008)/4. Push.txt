Daddy, where did all the people go?
Mommy, you won't tell me what you know
Evil smiles while they lie to you
Careless secrets glorified untrue

I can't push it all away
Every minute every day
We have to find the time
to make these people do the things the say

Sorry, I look past the truth alone
Maybe, with my fists I throw a stone
Shallow, graves fill up without regret
Broken, promises we all forget

It falls out of my brain
The visions of my brothers dying in the sand
It always seems the same
The basest instinct convalesces
In what is the worst of man

Listen
We can make it right
We can make them see us in the light
