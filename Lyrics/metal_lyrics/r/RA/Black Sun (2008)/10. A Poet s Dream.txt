I can tell by the color of the sky
You and I so red divided by the sun
I fall into the moment understanding why
I try to hard to hold it but I let it fly
let it fly away

And only the future seems clear to me right now
A foreign object to be at peace with...

On and on
I can't believe the echos of the falling rain
Time walks away
No matter what we do we can't erase the walls around a poets dream

Shiny broken thoughts that sit alone have lost their way
Hand outs all around distort the charity
Waterfalls suspect the air and birds fly in reverse
Nature misinterprets who she's meant to be and all in one day

A stolen misconception can't correct what I have seen
To you to me it's all a lie and so I intervene
Without the world's forgiveness I cannot be brought to life
Forever in the winter I see summer in the distance,
Summer in the whispers of the light
