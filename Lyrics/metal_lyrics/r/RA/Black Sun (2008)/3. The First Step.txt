Words
They twist and turn in me
They rip and burn in me
But a poet dies when he wants to live,
Chooses to be free

I couldn't be in worse condition
I couldn't find a harder time
You wouldn't want to see me
Falling out and in and out of mind

We can only be
What everybody else expected
Everybody else rejected (in me)
And you know that I can't say
A word against what I protected
Everybody else corrected in me

Paralyze
The thoughts inside your head
Erase the words you said
And the emptiest color will color in your soul tonight

I remember all the moments
I remember every game
My inspiration left the very same day that it came
