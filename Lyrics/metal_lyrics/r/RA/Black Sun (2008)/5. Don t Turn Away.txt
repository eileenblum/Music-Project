Under the sun I stand
Over the wings of Fallen Angels
I can't believe the things you show me
In my dreams I have you next to me

Forever gone is love
Out of control I fall in trenches
And if you leave me empty
How will I design the world I need

In your eyes you see it done
Colors drained away like water
Distance all but disappears
And nothing can be done

Don't, Don't turn away
Don't let it take you over
You cannot give in
Don't let it take you over now

And in your eyes I catch
A tiny glimpse of heaven calling
You try to stay in touch but can you
End what has no real beginning

In your eyes you see it done
Colors drained away like water
Distance all but disappears
And nothing can be done

Don't, Don't turn away
Don't let it take you over
You cannot give in
Don't let it take you over now

And I walk away
I leave you right where you stand
I'll never regret all that I said to you
But you never turned away

You never turned away
You never turned away
You never turned away

Don't, Don't turn away
Don't let it take you over
You cannot give in
Don't let it take you over now

Don't, Don't turn away
Don't let it take you over
You cannot give in
Don't let it take you over now

And I walk away
I leave you right where you stand
I'll never regret all that I said to you
But you never turned away

You never turned away
You never turned away
You never turned away

Don't, Don't turn away
Don't let it take you over
You cannot give in
Don't let it take you over now
