This has always been the way it has been
Falling to a hole inside myself
I can't remember hardly anything
But I remember holding your hand
And winter colors all but fade away
The sun seems motion to take the sky
You used to keep me warm within your purity
But now I'm lost in an empty space

Reeling
A broken soul
This lie that I'm forced to live in
Taken
Now that you've been ripped from me

My memory is a fog too thick to see
I must have sold your thoughts to stop the pain
And while it always rains inside of me
My love for you will never ever let you die

Reeling
This broken soul
This lie that I'm forced to live in
Taken
Now that you've been ripped from me

Can't you see?
Can't you see?
I'm not me
I can't let go
Your softness touched me
Without your touch
I weaken like a flower burned
If this is gone
I promise you anything â miss me
So I could hold you in my arms forever

Reeling
This broken soul
This lie that I'm forced to live in
Taken
Now that you've been ripped from me
