You think I notice that you're standing there right next to me?
Am I supposed to bow my head and thank you gratefully?
You break my heart and turn around to get what still remain.
I sold my soul and bought my fear; my inner pains.

Without a clue I trust, I follow you with my eyes blind.
And what I cannot see, I need, I cannot leave behind.
With all those eyes on me, their hunger it's insanity.
I can see you standing there. Do you wanna be free? Do you wanna be me?

I don't wanna be the only One.
To see my name wrote upon the Sun.
I don't wanna be the only One.
To watch it fall into the Sea.

I don't wanna have to play the game.
Sell my soul betray my name.
I don't wanna be the only One.
To watch it fall into the Sea.

So you just sit there stuck, afraid to risk reality.
Those words are mine and you can find them deep inside of me.
You walk away somehow dismayed at what you may have done.
The lies, the dreams, the broken promises... the only One.

I can't remember who's idea it was to make this real.
Divided equally, my feelings I still cannot feel.
And there you are you're all alone inside your fantasy.
I can see you standing there. Do wanna be free? Do you wanna be me?

I don't wanna be the only One.
To see me name wrote upon the Sun.
I don't wanna be the only One.
To watch it fall into the Sea.

I don't wanna have to play the game.
Sell my soul betray my name.
I don't wanna be the only One.
To watch it fall into the Sea.

And when the light is gone.
And it's just you and me.
Would you allow us to be who we're supposed to be? - yeah
Or will time erode our thoughts, our will, eternity.

I don't wanna be the only One.
To see me name wrote upon the Sun.
I don't wanna be the only One.
To watch it fall into the Sea.

I don't wanna have to play the game.
Sell my soul betray my name.
I don't wanna be the only One.
To watch it fall into the Sea.

I don't wanna be the only One.
I don't wanna be the only One.
I don't wanna be the only One.
I don't wanna be the only One to watch it fall into the Sea
