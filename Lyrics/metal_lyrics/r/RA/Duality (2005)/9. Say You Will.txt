My eyes are closed
Within my mind I still can feel your skin
Those memories seem so faint, so thin
You don't believe
You closed the door and never took the time
You never once could let me in

All the time
All the pain
Torn apart too far to see my way
I can't live without you, mine

Say you will
Say you will
Shine on me for one more day
Say you will
Just say you will
Love what you betray

You told the lie
You shoot at me
Ashamed to live out loud
To solve the case in doubt
You have to set me free
It's you
I can't escape the things you did you me
It's all that I can take

All the time
All the pain
Torn apart too far to see my way
I can't live without you, mine

Say you will
Say you will
Shine on me for one more day
Say you will
Just say you will
Love what you betray
Just say you will
Say you will
Shine on me for one more day
Say you will
Just say you will
Say you will

Is it me?
Is it me?
Am I not what you expect me to be?
Did I fall?
Lose it all?
Did you think I'd let you do that to me?
You can try
You can cry
But it won't erase what has happened to me
I can live
I can give
I can say I will, I will, I will
