Thank you God, for this great opportunity.
To share with you, exactly how I feel.
I'm not well, and I think that I should tell you.
That I think I got the raw end of the deal.

Don't get me wrong, cause it's not like I blame you.
Cause sometimes things get crazy on their own.
I'm ashamed of the way I point my finger.
Cause deep down I have reaped what I have sown.

Life is hard, but so is everything.
Give my regards, to a man who cares.
If I succeed, I will save my fellow man.
And if I fail, I'll just stand and stare.

I'm searching this life load.
and I know that you're aware.
That you're a drug to me, a drug within my fear.
But I love you, a junky to your silence.
A wise man who's words I'll never hear.

What to do? I feel as if I'm floating, not aware I'm in control of what I am.
God bless me, take me out of this existence and my role as the sacrificial lamb
- Oh!

Life is hard, but so is everything.
Give my regards, to a man who cares.
If I succeed, I will save my fellow man.
And if I fail, I'll just stand and stare.

I'll just stand and stare.

Life is hard, but so is everything.
Give my regards, to a man who cares.
If I succeed, I will save my fellow man.
And if I fail, I'll just stand and stare.

Life is hard, but so is everything.
Give my regards, to a man who cares.
If I succeed, I will save my fellow man.
And if I fail, I'll just stand and - stare.

I'll just stand and stare...
