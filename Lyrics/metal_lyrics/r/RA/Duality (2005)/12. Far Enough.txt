It's on my face, it's in my feelings
The scars I carry are your name
You fold your arms, you don't believe me
You don't like to think you cause me pain
Yet here I am, your worst creation
A silent spyglass in your style
Don't turn away, you can't ignore it
It's what you wanted all the while

You've taken this far enough
You think but you're not so tough
You've taken this far enough from me

I'm getting bored with affiliation
I'm getting sick of all your crap
You stand there dumb, but you don't see me
You do the crime, I take the rap
If someone saw this they'd say it's crazy
If someone saw this they'd probably lose their mind
So now I'm done â you can't effect me
There's someone else I need to find

You've taken this far enough
You think but you're not so tough
You've taken this far enough from
You've taken this far enough
I'm so sick of all your stuff
You've taken this far enough from me

You're stuck in a fantasy
But my heart knows what's real
There's nothing left to say

Maybe I wasn't up to be
The pure boy for reality
Look around and close your eyes
You're big now, and since in disguise

You've taken this far enough
You think but you're not so tough
You've taken this far enough from
You've taken this far enough
I'm so sick of all your stuff
You've taken this far enough from me
