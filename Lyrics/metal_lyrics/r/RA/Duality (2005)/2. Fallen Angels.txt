My eyes, don't see the obvious
There's way to far to go
Forget all that you ask of me
There's nothing left to go

I see Fallen Angels
When I try to go to sleep
And they're always watching
I see Fallen Angels
As I'm walking in the streets
Silently preparing, what they'll do to me

You see, I'm kind of paranoid
My luck is seen to as my mouth
So I will point the finger now
Beyond the shit, the world of doubt

I see Fallen Angels
When I try to go to sleep
And they're always watching
I see Fallen Angels
As I'm walking in the street
Silently preparing what they'll do to me

I seen Fallen Angels
When I try to go to sleep
And they're always watching
I see fallen angels
As I'm walking in the street
Silently preparing

I see fallen angels (Fallen Angels)
I see fallen angels (Fallen Angels)
When I try to go to sleep (fallen angels)
I see Fallen Angels (fallen angels)
As I'm walking in the street (fallen angels)
Silently preparing what they'll do to me
