Though i tried before to tell her
Of the feelings i have for her
In my heart
Every timethat i come near her
I just lose my nerve
As I've done from the start

Every little thing she does is magic
Every little thing she does just turns me on
Even when my life before was tragic
Now i know my love with her goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of the thousand rainy days
Since we've first met
Its a big enough umbrella
But its always me that ends up getting wet

Every little thing she does is magic
Every little thing she does just turns me on
Even when my life before was tragic
Now i know my love with her goes on

I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if sheâll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
