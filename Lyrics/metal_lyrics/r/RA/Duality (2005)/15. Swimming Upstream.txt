The sun disappeared right before my eyes
My heart turned and walked away
I gave you
the keys to an open door and you threw them right back at me
Once again I'm alone with a pain in my chest so sad so sad so long
And the clouds start to gather here comes
the rain
You meant more then you can know
I can't say I miss you your always around
I can't say I love you cause you cut me down
I'm wounded and hurt and that's my fault
But I made my decision with my back to the wall
And I gotta move on from here
I've done all that I can do
Yeah I gotta move on from here
I've been swimming upstream for you
A storm passes by I can't explain
It's hard to be next to you
Is it my face or is it everything
That your not attracted to
I'm so lost and confused when I look at you
Your rise your lips so soft
And then when you see me I turn away
Cause I know that I turn you off
I can't say I miss you your always around
I can't say I love you cause you cut me down
I'm wounded and hurt and that's my fault
But I made my decision with my back to the wall
And I gotta move on from here
I've done all that I can do
Yeah I gotta move on from here
I've been swimming upstream for you...
I've been swimming upstream for you
I've been swimming upstream for you
