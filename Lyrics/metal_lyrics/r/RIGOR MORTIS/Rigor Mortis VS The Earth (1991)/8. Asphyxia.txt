The blood is pounding in my head I feel a tightness in my chest 
The room is spinning backwards and I cannot seem to catch my breath 
My life flashes before my eyes I realize I'm gonna choke to death 

[Chorus:]
Asphyxia I cannot breathe someone please help me 
I suffocate asphyxiate is this the end of me 

Shove a finger down my throat and hope that I don't bite it off 
I cough I spit I'm in a fit clutching anything in sight 
These seconds are my very last I'm turning blue I'm fading fast 

[Chorus:]
Asphyxia I cannot breathe someone please help me 
I suffocate asphyxiate is this the end of me 

The world around me's growing dim I feel a state of shock is near 
Panic's taken over and my body is stricken with fear 
Now I'm hanging by a thread cardiac arrest is here 

[Chorus:]
Asphyxia I cannot breath someone please help me 
I suffocate asphyxiate is this the end of me 

My bodies twitching on the floor my throat is swelling more and more 
The pulse is weak inside my vein my life is almost drained 
No air to make my final cry and no one here to see me die 

[Chorus:]
Asphyxia I cannot breathe someone please help me 
I suffocate asphyxiate is this the end of me 

Asphyxia I cannot breathe someone please help me 
I suffocate asphyxiate Is this the end of my life'
