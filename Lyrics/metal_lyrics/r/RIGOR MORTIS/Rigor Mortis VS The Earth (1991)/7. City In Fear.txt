Deep in the black hearted death of the night 
Watching your every move 
Driven by madness a voice in his head 
Telling him what he must do 
Watching and waiting for his chance to strike 
Another to add to his score 
Leaving a city to panic in fear 
Knowing that there will be more 

[Chorus:]
Random and senseless his crimes 
His crimes are obscene 
Brutally skillful efficient and clean 
It curdles your blood knowing he's near 
Trapped in a nightmare - City in fear 

Night after night it's always the same 
Someone falls prey to his blade 
With daylight comes news that another was killed 
The trademark incisions were made 
No one is safe on the streets anymore 
The police no protection at all 
Taking your chances and living at risk 
Praying he won't come to call 

[Chorus:]
Random and senseless his crimes 
His crimes are obscene 
Brutally skillful efficient and clean 
It curdles your blood knowing he's near 
Trapped in a nightmare - City in fear 

Then all at once the killings all stop 
As suddenly as they began 
Still there's no trace and the law can't believe 
They're no closer to finding their man 
Time will not heal the wounds he's inflicted 
Knowing that he's out there still 
Wondering when he'll make his return 
And who will be next to be killed 

[Chorus:]
Random and senseless his crimes 
His crimes are obscene 
Brutally skillful efficient and clean 
It curdles your blood knowing he's near 
Trapped in a nightmare - City in fear
