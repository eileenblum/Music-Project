Blood, blood - runs from putrid sores 
Screams, screams- worse than any war 
Toxic, toxic - Sick contamination 
Raping, raping - Through our planet's nations 

[Chorus:]
Gruesome crimson bodies 
Suffer final anguish 
From waste or space 
From a pissed off god 
Where it comes from no one knows 
Contagious contamination

Carnage, carnage - Fills the stinking streets 
Rotten, rotten - Swollen rancid meat 
Plague, plague - Everyone shall fall 
Death, death - And darkness rule all 

[Chorus]
