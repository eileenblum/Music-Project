In the dungeon's where it waits 
Locked down in this cold wet place 
For good or bad it has been used 
Many have died to pay their dues 
Made from wood and chains of steel 
Tighten the rope by turning wheel 

[Chorus:]
The wheel is turning, it never stops 
Ripping in half ripping apart 
Once turning it cannot stop 
Rip you in half, rip you apart 
The wheel is turning, it never stops 
Ripping in half ripping apart 
Once turning it cannot stop 
Rip you in half, rip you apart 
Muscles snap from pounds of tension 
Arms and legs meet dislocation 
Stretched to then past the breaking point 
Pulling hip bones out of joint 
Don't beg don't plead don't even try 
I've met the rack it's time to die 

[Repeat Chorus]

Tied, gagged, and broken separation is complete 
The rack fulfills it's purpose, dividing bone and meat 
For confession or for torture it's grip never releases 
The rack has claimed another life 
My body lies in pieces
