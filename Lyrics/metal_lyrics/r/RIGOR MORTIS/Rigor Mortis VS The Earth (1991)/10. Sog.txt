Sog comes alive out of death 
Called forth by the weakness of your race 
His one desire is to kill 
Sog is the ender of your disgrace 
The dead shall rise at his command 
To feast upon your steaming gore 
The mindless legions of the damned 
Erase mankind forever more 
Sog has risen-Sog will conquer 
Sog is darkness-Sog destroyer 
Sog burns your cities to the ground 
His laughter drowning out your cries 
The streets run red with your blood 
Your bodies lie where they die 
Extinction of the human breed 
A bloody global genocide 
Justified and merciless 
The planet's savior has arrived 
Sog has risen-Sog will conquer 
Sog is darkness-Sog destroyer 
Sog sits on his throne of bones 
He's laughing as the humans suffer 
Nothing no one nowhere no more 
Death forever and forever 
Sog has risen-Sog is alive 
Sog sits on his throne of bones 
He's laughing as the humans suffer 
Nothing no one nowhere no more 
Death forever and forever 
Sog has risen-Sog is alive 
Sog has risen-Sog is alive 
Sog comes alive out of death 
Called forth by the weakness of your race 
His one desire is to kill 
Sog is the ender of your disgrace 
Sog burns your cities to the ground 
His laughter drowning out your cries 
The streets run red with your blood 
Your bodies lie where they die 
Sog has risen-Sog will conquer 
Sog is darkness-Sog destroyer
