Entrapped by cold nowhere to go they wait below 
Crypt of darkness silent abyss eternal unrest 
Entombed in this place the light of day can't penetrate 
Exhumed to discover the deathless remains waiting under 
Frozen forever the faces of terror 
Naked and twisted the skin hard as leather 
Stretching and cracking but always remaining alive 
Mummified - watching and waiting 
Horribly shocking and sickening but never decaying 
In motionless agony 
Young ones still held close to the breast now one with Death 
Eyes fixed with a final vision of grief and pain 
Entombed in this place the light of day can't penetrate 
Exhumed to discover the deathless remains waiting under 
Jellied forever the body distorted 
Harder than stone and forever alone 
Each with a different story to tell of his own death 
Mummified - watching and waiting 
Horribly shocking and sickening but never decaying 
In motionless agony 
Mummified petrified 
Waiting to horrify man with a hideous smile 
Mummified petrified 
Waiting to horrify me in my every dream 
Timeless waiting vengeful hatred so cold so dead 
What made them die' Preserved in time I must know why
