Primitive and deviant like prehistoric man 
Intimidate infuriate 'cos I don't fit your plan 
The way I act the way I look the things I have to say 
Scare you into persecution try to change my ways 
You won't change me 
I don't care what you have to say 
I live my life my own way 
I won't conform to your rules 
I won't be led by your fools 
You won't change me 
You can't break me 
Throwback 
Throwback 
I hate you you hate me never ending fight 
Hunt me judge me take away my rights 
Analyze scrutinize every move I make 
Try your best waste your breath I will never break 
[chorus]
