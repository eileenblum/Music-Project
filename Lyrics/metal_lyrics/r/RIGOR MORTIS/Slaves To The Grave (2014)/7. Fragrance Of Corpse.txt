Hideous, disgusting, obnoxious and crude
A family outcast that's vile and rude
Secluded, abandoned, desolate, alone
Withdrawn from the world he lives on his own
Sadistic, inhuman, merciless and cruel
His own moral standards, his own set of rules

[Chorus:]
Putrid - Stinking smell
Rotting - Bodies swell
Decayed - Human skill
The Fragrance of Corpse is his stench of his kin

Pretending he's God to provide for his needs
Reattaching body parts until he succeeds
An assortment of heads, torsos and limbs,
Modern day Frankenstein creating his friends

Demented, unbalanced, unstable, deranged
Bodies of victims are severed and maimed
Revengeful, psychotic, vindictive, insane
Attaching choice pieces of human remains
Murdering, butchering, dissecting, mayhem
Constructing companions that never betray him

[Chorus]

Pretending he's God to provide for his needs
Reattaching body parts until he succeeds
An assortment of heads, torsos and limbs,
Modern day Frankenstein creating his friends
