Ancient horror, ancient nightmare
Older than mankind
Sources of terror, source of evil
Come forth form the brine
Black and slimy, dripping mucus
Giant golden eye
Beak for ripping, suckers biting
Tentacles held high

From his kingdom, deep dark ocean
Burst forth to the land
Godlike power, demon fury
Time is now at hand
Vulgar figure, oozing onward
Stench of salty muck
Devastation, marks his pathway
Malice runs amok

Almighty, is risen, ton conquer earth
King of gods, soul reaper, life has no worth

Ancient Horror [4x]

Time forgotten, master elder
Dreadful beastly slug
Spewing venom, rancid pustules
Dripping acid blood
Bow before him, makes no difference
Your mind it will crack
Life means nothing, feeds on sorrow
Relentless attack

Almighty, is risen, ton conquer earth
King of gods, soul reaper, life has no worth

Ancient Horror [4x]
