Rising from the cold Norse ground
Undead Viking lusting blood
Gleefully he cuts you down
And drags you to his tomb
Dark of night is hen he prowls
Through his realm no man shall pass
Robbing corpses of their gold
He takes it to the grave

[Chorus:]
Harder than steel
He lives to kill
Merciless slaughter
Cruse of the Draugr

Death black flesh in the pale moon light
Greedy for his red revenge
Filled with hatred of mankind
Jealous of all life
From the living fog he charges
Full Berzerker rage
Brutal blows from ancient steel
He cleaves you to the bone

[Chorus]

Damned to haunt the earth forever
Cursed abomination
For heinous crimes now long forgotten
He can never die
His only pleasure is to kill
In agonizing pain
Delighting in our suffering
Foul sadistic fiend

[Chorus]
