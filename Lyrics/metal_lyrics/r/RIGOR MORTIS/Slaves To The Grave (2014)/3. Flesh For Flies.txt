You are my victim, my helpless prey
And you won't live to see another day
I have the tools to do the job
I'll hang you on a hook and gut you like a hog

Meat's meat and a man's gotta eat
You better get out of the kitchen if you can't stand the heat
I'll grind your bones, I'll eat your soul
I'll use your skull for my dinner bowl

You're food for worms
You're flesh for flies - Flesh for Flies!

You're food for worms
You're flesh for flies - Flesh for Flies!

You're food for worms
You're flesh for flies - Flesh for Flies!

Flesh for Flies!

I am the lord of the harvest
I'll eat your flesh, I'll wear your skin
I am only getting started
And I will kill and kill and kill and kill again

You're food for worms
You're flesh for flies - Flesh for Flies!
