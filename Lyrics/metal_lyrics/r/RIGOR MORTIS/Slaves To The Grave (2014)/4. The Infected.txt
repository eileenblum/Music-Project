I came without warning, apocalypse plague
Reports were horrific but details were vague
The told us the dead were returning to life
Infecting the living with pestilent bits

Ravaging
Pandemic
Infected

Ravaging
Pandemic
Infected

Though they are dead they're no slaves to the grave
Relentless, they hunt for the flesh that they crave
Burn down to ashes and cut off their heads
Sole means of death for what's already dead

The Infected
