Man kills man since time began
From Cane and Able to Son of Sam
We kill for power we kill for greed
We kill sometimes just to watch 'em bleed
We lust for blood and wealth and land
Enough to kill our fellow man
We go to war, cause genocide
In civilized homicide

Sticks and stones may break their bones
But tanks and bombs destroy their homes
So pick a target far away
And live to kill another day
Science fiction is now science fact
We've gone to far, no turning back
We've picked a fight that can't be won
Oh my God, what have we done?

[Chorus:]
Drop the bomb - Death from above - Rain of Ruin
Vaporize - Unleashing Hell as it hits the ground
Drop the bomb - Death from above - Rain of Ruin
Say goodbye - watching the world as it all falls down

All falls down

The keys are turned, the sequence starts
Countdown to the missile launch
Human life is expendable
Projected losses acceptable
Warheads streak across the sky
Mushroom clouds and millions die
The line is crossed and all is lost
A final global holocaust

[Chorus]

All falls down
All falls down
All falls down
