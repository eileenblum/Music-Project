I am the paranoia in your head
I am the thing underneath your bed
I am the killer that never gets caught
I am the fear that cannot be fought

All of your nightmares rolled into one
The terror I bring you cannot be undone
Tormenting your life I'm back very night
Malevolent force I'm your Poltergeist

Upon my arrival the temperature drops
Incorporeal being that cannot be stopped
My villainous visions eat into your brain
Torture unending I drive you insane

All of your nightmares rolled into one
The terror I bring you cannot be undone
Tormenting your life I'm back very night
Malevolent force, I'm your Poltergeist

When I appear
You're gripped with fear
Immortal blight
The Poltergeist

I am darkness and I am despair
You're never alone because I'm always there
Living in fear for the rest of your life
Of all the things that go bump in the night

All of your nightmares rolled into one
The terror I bring you cannot be undone
Tormenting your life I'm back very night
Malevolent force I'm your Poltergeist

When I appear
You're gripped with fear
Immortal blight
The Poltergeist
