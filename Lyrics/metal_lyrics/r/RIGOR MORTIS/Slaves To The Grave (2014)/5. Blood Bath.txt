Slaughter in the nation running high
20 thousand yearly forced to die
America leads the murder game
What do they do it for pleasure or fame?
Men no one deem insane
Crave only blood and pain
A twisted mind can snap anytime
You could fall victim of a lethal crime
Hiding hate with smiling faces

Lucas appeared normal to me
Gein was a pillar of Society
Williams killed children but who would know
Son of Sam, Ed Kemper, DeSalvo
They don't seem deranged
Crave only blood and pain
You're not save from this lunatic fringe
Anyone can go on a killing bing
Here's some fuel for our deepest fears
200 thousand killed in the last 10 years

The drownings, the hangings, the stabbings, the stranglings
The body count continues to rise
Diabolic maniacs attempt the perfect crime
Their victims are dying their love ones are crying
Unlucky ones get in their path
Plotting and planning and stalking and lurking
Yearning for their Blood Bath

Nameless victims - Bloodbath
Die screaming - Bloodbath
Forsake - Bloodbath
In sorrow - Bloodbath
And tears
They hide in plain site, they seek a certain type
Ridding the world of a few
The police have no clues
Serial killers!

It's up to him if he lets them live
Some are tortured and then they're slain.
They are born not made
Serial killers!
