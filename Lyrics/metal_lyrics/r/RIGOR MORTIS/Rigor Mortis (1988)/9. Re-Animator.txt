He seeks fresh bodies in the morgue to test his new creation
Injecting serum in the corpses for the hope of re-animation
He has conquered brain death, welcome back to life!

Re-animator, re-animate me
The human dosage factor is unknown a super charged zombie awakes
Becomes sort of a blood blithering creature everyone's death is at stake
They will give him power, he will give them life!

I'm not insane, I'm dead, but he gave me life!
