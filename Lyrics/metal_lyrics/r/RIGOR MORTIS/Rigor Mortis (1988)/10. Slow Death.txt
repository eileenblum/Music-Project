I'll take your life in my hand
As you follow my command
Now you breathe your final breath
Slowly I put you to death

Now you know, all you fear
As you wait, is coming near

'Cos you can't see me, so you will die!

Your clothes will be ripped away
The madman starts to play
You will be skinned alive
Cooked in fire 'til you die

Now you know, all you fear
As you wait, is coming near

'Cos you can't see me, so you will die!

I have this knife
It's a good knife
Well, what have we here?
You all look a little scared
Or should I say prepared
For you may be our next meal
Casey, rip off their flesh
Mike, drain me a glass of blood
Harden, prepare to make carcass stew

Screaming in terror, now you know your death is near
The skeleton in the black rope, with his scythe will appear
I've cast the shadow of death, on you to make your end
And when rigor mortis sets, we'll do the whole mother-fuckin' thing again!

Now you know - slow death!
All you fear - slow death!
As you wait - slow death
It's coming near

Carved forever on your back
Initials of the maniac
Seen forever in this place
The story of your rotting face

Now you know, all your fears
As you wait, is coming near

'Cos you can't see me, so you will die!

Prepare to meet your slow death
