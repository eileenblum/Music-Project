[2003 Reissued/Remastered Album Bonus Track][originally appeared on the soundtrack for "The Decline of Western Civilization, Part II"]I was bit by a beast can't turn back
Deadly germ in their spit a rabid pack
Rotted nerves turn me to a maniac
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth

Looking sick on the streets slobber drips
Mad disease sent from hell on my lips
I will chew all your flesh into bits
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth

I'm stalking prey in the night
Decay sets in my brain
Infect you with my bite

In the dark lethal actions will begin
Victim found here I am biting skin
Soon he feels the vile blade laced with sin
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth

I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth

I'm stalking prey in the night
Decay sets in my brain
Infect you with my bite
Final stage symptoms will intensify
I can't move feelings gone nerves sucked dry
Paralyzed on the ground now I die
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth
I'm foaming at the mouth now I foam at the mouth
