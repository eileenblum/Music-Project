Born on a battlefield and baptized in blood
You took your first steps in the red reeking mud
Killed your first man at the age of thirteen
Life's lessons taught you to be cruel and mean

All your prayers are said in vain
You live by the blade, die by the same
DIE IN PAIN!!
Soldier of fortune selling your sword
Leading to battle a barbaric horde
Showing no mercy to those you attack
You kill without feeling and never look back

Vengeance and hatred was all that you knew
Stealing and killing was all you could do
Living and loving the life that you led
A life that has left you, nothing but dead
