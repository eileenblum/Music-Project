I knew my destination from my moment of birth
I'd live my life my own way and wreak havoc on Earth
Through my entire childhood most everyone could tell
I have no earthly master 'cause I'm condemned to hell!
My moral violations are proof for all to see
My life is just a journey to where I ought to be
There are evil wicked forces within my every cell
Which always reassures me that I'm condemned to hell!
Hell - Is meant for me
Hell - Is where I'll be
Hell - The place I'll roam
Hell - My final home
To many I'm a demon to others I'm insane
But all who dare confront me are brought to death in pain
I always kill them slowly I love to hear them yell
I slaughter without mercy and I'm condemned to hell!!
