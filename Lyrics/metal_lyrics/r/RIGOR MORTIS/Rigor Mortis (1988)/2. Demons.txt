We are instruments of evil we come straight from hell
We're the legions of the demons that are haunting for the kill
Cathedrals are now cemeteries doom is all you see
We have come to take the world and give you misery
We are pestilent and contaminate the world
And make tombs of your cities
We come bursting through your bodies, rape your helpless soul
Transform you into a creature merciless and cold
We force you to kill your brother eat his blood and brain
Shredding flesh and sucking bone 'till everyone's insane
We are pestilent and contaminate the world
Demonic legions prevail

We are pestilent and contaminate the world
And make tombs of your cities
Demons!
