Welcome to my room my dear I'll show you a good time
It's too bad that you never heard my fetish is a crime
There's no need to worry bitch, just lay there and relax
And as you reach your climax I'll be reaching for my axe!!

With five easy slices, you're in six lovely pieces
Bodily dismemberment as passion increases
So you wanna play games do ya?
Well just who do you think you're fucking with!
You see I've learned everything the hard way
Yes I've been through hell and back
And I believe the time has come to show you why you're here
You see the weapon in my hands and you know your death is near
When I tied your hands and feet you thought it was exciting
But now you know you cannot stop, your body's disuniting

Who's laughing now you fool?
You had your chance, and that's it!
Expect no mercy from this maniac
Well you're fucking history bitch!
First I'll slice your tender leg off just above the thighs
Then I remove your slender arms my passion running high
Last I will decapitate your pretty little head
A masterpiece of blood and flesh lies twitching on my bed

Why do you make me do these things?
When you know I never wanted to hurt you
But no, you wouldn't listen, would you?
Well you stupid fuck, look at you now!
