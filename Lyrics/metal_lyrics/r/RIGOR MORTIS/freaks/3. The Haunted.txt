Deep in the forrest where few men have been 
Stands a house black as sin 
All who have been there are dead or insane 
Shocking things lurk within 

All fear the house where the haunted are dwelling! 
Horrible music infecting your brain 
Calling you in to it's wicked domain 
Can't hide your eyes from the maddening sights 
Praying you won't meet the haunted tonight - 
- You will! 

I had a craving to visit this place 
Cowardice is disgrace 
Now I regret having been so naive 
Death I will soon embrace - 
God how I wish I had never gone in there! 

[Chorus]
[Lead]

Please heed my warning and never go in there! 
Dark evil secrets this cabin can show 
Things that men should not know 
Suicide now is my only relief 
Memories pain me so 

There's no forgetting the things that I witnessed

[Chorus]

Terror haunts the house in the woods Wise men fear it, all men should...
