Digging their way through rotted earth 
Clawing their way from the grave 
They're dead but they live and they hunger 
And it's fresh human flesh that they crave 
The corpses of long dead and rotten 
Family and friends that you knew 
The legions of lost and forgotten 
Are rising and coming for you 

Worms of the earth! Worms of the earth!

Your brain can't accept what's happening 
Your mind wants to snap at the sight 
So numb with fear at your immenent fate 
You don't even feel the first bite 
Rotted teeth tear the meat from your bone 
You watch as they eat you alive 
Drinking your blood and chewing your guts 
And ripping out your insides 

Worms of the earth! Worms of the earth!

Life is over death begins 
A new existance with no end 
The endless night of death consumes you 
Purgatory's grip consumes you 
In painful death unholy birth 
The living dead - the worms of the earth!
