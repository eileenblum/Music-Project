The faces deformed and grotesque 
The disfigured bodies and limbs 
You cringe at the sickening sight 
The freaks are accepting you in 

Hide your disgust as they greet you 
They cannot help their misfortune 
You can't seem to help but wonder 
Are their minds as warped as their form' 

Unnatural humanoids proud to be one of their kind 
Unique imperfections bent for revenge on the world 
Plotting to turn all mankind into creatures obsene 
You shall be next to be transformed into one of them 
...Pray for your death! 

Drugs of unknown chemicals 
Cruel hacksaw surgery 
Altered features of your head 
Make you a monstrosity 

Soon you will realize that you are one of them 
No turning back now because you belong to them 
Seeing the horrible things that were done by them 
...You are a FREAK! 

Forgetting the life you once knew 
Reality you must accept 
Knowing resistance is useless 
You will do what they expect 

There soon will be hordes of people 
Who crave to view mutated flesh 
And you shall choose the next victem 
For hideous transformation! 

You will obey the code of the freaks 
You'll help their cause till the world is one 
You love the freaks - you are a freak 
Long Live The Freaks!
