Mother died when I was born, all her insides ripped and torn 
Father hates the sight of me - I'm an oddity! 
I'm the ugly hidden son kept away from everyone 
Captive in a private cell - acrimony swells! 
Locked in shackles I've remained longing to be unrestrained 
Time and hate will strengthen me - soon I will be free! 

Chained in the attic! Why am I chained in the attic'

Eating only mice and rats muscles growing strong and fat 
Living in my excrement - I am not content! 
Terror of the human race gruesome features on my face 
Swollen tumors on my skin - rabid bloody grin! 
Trapped up in this rotten hole losing all my self control 
Burning anger in my brain - driving me insane! 

Chained in the attic! Why am I chained in the attic'

[Lead]

Set me free!

I'll escape and start to kill slaughter only for the thrill 
Father chained me up from birth - I will kill him first! 
All my neighbors soon will die cut the throat and suck Oem dry 
Feast upon their tender brains - piss on the remains! 
Then I'll roam the streets at night satisfy my appetite 
Tear the victem's chest apart - just to eat the heart! 

Chained in the attic! Why am I chained in the attic'

I will break free!
