Cigarette frozen to my lip
feel that pang gotta make that trip
no you wouldn't advise it saying to me
baby you don't know these folks
but baby understand -- I made my choice

I know I'm gonna make it
got faith in the Lord above
got faith in the Devil below
Faith stronger than a Mother's love
yeh - gotta little bit extra
like silver on a golden wing
and pretty soon y'gonna hear me sing
bout the good thing that I bring

Horror drive oh yeh round the town
promises aint calming my nerves down
doubts I cannot entertain while
waiting that eternity
I understand -- I made my choice

I know I'm gonna make it
got faith in the Lord above
got faith in the Devil below
Faith stronger than a Mother's love
yeh - gotta little bit extra
like silver on a golden wing
and pretty soon y'gonna hear me sing
bout the good thing that I bring

red light pass aint coming for us
deal went down without a fuss
destination aint but a mile
cant contain my infectious smile

oh sweet salvation
oh the joy it comes in waves
a sense of pleasure so depraved
lady luck blushes raises her veil up

now I got my good thing

This goddamed cycle
been repeating all my days
these blessed cursed ways
people tell me that I'm wrong that I should know better

waitin on that good thing
waiting on that good thing forever
waitin on that good thing
people tell me that I'm wrong that I should know better
