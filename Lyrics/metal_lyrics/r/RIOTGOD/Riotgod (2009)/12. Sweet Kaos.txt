Laid out like a city map before me patterns lead my eyes I'm dazed yeh - Amazed? No.

Distraction conversation color fragrance yeh all vie for ones attention -- did I mention?

Got this feeling in my soul like I'm filled with nitroglycer-intimation -- oh this sensation

Standing there before me like a jewel inside a case and I am
BROKE.

Gestures glances shape inflection analyzed so quickly in my mind yeh -- ain't tryin -- no.
Standing as a carousel of choice oh whirls right by me -- so inviting
( and I'm )
Standing there before me like a jewel inside a case and I am
BROKE.

Oh this pulse in my heart -- could easily start
sweet kaos
memory is no friend -- no -- no.

Standing there before me like a jewel inside a case and I am
BROKE.

Standing there before me
with that question on my tongue

Patience - patience baby
oh the night is young

Mirror.
