Town -- overwhelming
so small fit on a pin - rich with hidden sin
Money - he be savin
Day to blending day - mindful of his ways

dreaming of the sky
and colored sweeping plains
destiny awaiting
everything to gain
planning for deliverance
saying not a word
silence truly is the golden rule

road is calling go
all he wants to know
skin is shedding wings are spreading out

Young -- he's a good man
aint done nobody wrong
the day he works are long
young -- he's awoken
fearing not the day
nor anything you say -- like

What about the -- hang on
you know life aint a -- put on
if I were you -- push on
that's no way to -- come on
what ya gonna do -- turn on
I know you feel ya gotta - move on

damn right I've wasted too much time

road is calling go
all he wants to know
skin is shedding wings are spreading out

lookin all around
hearing every sound

dreaming of the sky
and colored sweeping plains
destiny awaiting
everything to gain
planning for deliverance
saying not a word
silence truly is the golden rule

road is calling go
all he wants to know
skin is shedding wings are spreading out [repeat 4]
