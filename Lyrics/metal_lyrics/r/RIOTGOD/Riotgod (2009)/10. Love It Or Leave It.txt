I can see you there watchin'
I see your concern
damn that man's hard headed
when's he ever gonna learn

I know you feel you been saying it over and over again

Babe I learn the hard way
once just aint enough
made life a little less sweet yeh
made life a little more tough

I know you're tired o hearin it it over and over again

my mind aint right I know it's true
baby
love it or leave it it's up to you [repeat 1]

Know you're a little nervous to take this test of time -- yeh you got dreams of your own babe and I'm sure they can't match mine

I aint tired I'll hear them out baby yeh
over and over again

my mind aint right I know it's true
baby
love it or leave it it's up to you [repeat]

come on tell me ya love me.
