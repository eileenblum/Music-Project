Wide - wide will be my smile
when the stars aboce become aligned
fine fine will feel my heart
embraced by the grand design

oh understand me baby
I've no control
hard-wired element it rules my soul
rules my soul....

Retrieved from the black, silent, dream of a death
been blue
been found
been cold

and this desire it was there when I was young - be there [repeat] when I am old

oh understand me baby
I've no control
hard-wired element it rules my soul
and oh this fire inside me it doesn't die
it burns eternally -- demands I try [repeat]

[solo]

Oh understand me baby
I've no control
hard-wired element it rules my soul
and oh this fire inside me it doesn't die
it burns eternally -- demands I try
gone are the days baby, when the straightest line
appeared to me a maze
before my eyes [repeat]

I've got one wish I always will invoke.
