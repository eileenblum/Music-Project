Dawn oh it came broke like a fever
sun shone in through curtains waved by the wind
slowly

the night it disappeared
oh it exploded
cleared the air a vacuum all that remained
still

and I
lay alone
for hours
the smell of yesterday all on my clothes
smoke

and there you came
oh and I turned
the room became filled with all that we learned
the space between us oh
became less and less

You came to me
oh said your piece
your eyes so damned wide
demanding release
your heart was set it was over
long ago

Here come those tears.
