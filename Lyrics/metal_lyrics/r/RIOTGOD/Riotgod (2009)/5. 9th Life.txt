Oh baby you always on my mind
ooooh baby why do you feel so divine
yeh and I
throw away reason and all my care -- no other power can compare

like shadow over sun I feel that you can come right to me
on the morning of my ninth life

oh baby certain like bird in the spring
oooh baby how sweetly with longing you sing
yeh and I
throw away reason and all my care -- no other power can compare

like shadow over sun I feel that you can come right to me
on the morning of my ninth life

Oh baby you always on my mind
ooooh baby why do you feel so divine
and you
come on the morning yeh you come on the morning yeh
you come on the morrrrrning right to me
on the morning plain to see
on the morning yeh
ooooh on the morning of my ninth life
