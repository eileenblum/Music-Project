I'll set it straight
this my frame
aint bout fame
something had to give when all seemed so bleak
had to speak bout that which make me live

Sbeen long since those days childhood games with BTO on H
that void dreaming boy would emply some tools to break things

Never knew how hard it would be--coming real again. [repeat]

Painful play thievin ways
wasted days
cowardly return
the flower inside out rooted doubt slowly dissipates

this joy overwhelms seldom does anything just give
this refrain cuts through pain
awaits me after all I've failed to gain

Never knew how hard it would be--coming real again. [repeat]
Never knew how hard it would be--coming real at all.

And I wave to the ghosts, still splitting halves in half
wave goodbye
thanks for the memories
how we lied
now we tried
wishing on collapsing stars baby

Never knew how hard it would be--coming real again. [repeat]
