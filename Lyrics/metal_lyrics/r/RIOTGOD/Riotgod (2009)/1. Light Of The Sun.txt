Far from Sea and Sand
a mission alone
a capsule of land
proceed with the hope of preserving a seed
a journey of life propelled by a need yet
Suddenly change we were faced with
a beacon of madness message of death
and it became clear
perfectly clear to me

as I stared at the light of the faraway sun [x4]

Now I'm in command
they gave me an order it cannot stand
they wont find agreement in me
its one against all
that's how it will be
I made up my mind to do what I can to stand up be righteous though I may be damned

oh it became clear
perfectly clear to me

as I stared at the light of the faraway sun [x4]

[SOLO]

as I stared at the light of the faraway sun [x4]

Set to kill by the light of the sun
