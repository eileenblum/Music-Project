Certain like a level - irresistible lure
some saying that it's dead
of that he aint sure
searching for the sound that when found will make him feel pure.

Oh what it does to his soul yeh
fuses the young to the old
searching for the sound that when found will make him feel pure.

gonna put all that talk
away to bed
he speaking he truth yea sure as blood runs red

patient like a man who lived far two long
rhythm of his life no substitute song
looking like a lock in a room full of jeys
hiding like a cure to an unknown disease

Oh what it does to his soul yeh
fuses the young to the old
searching for the sound that when found will make him feel pure.

gonna put all that talk
away to bed
he speaking he truth sure as blood runs red

hog tied dreams become unbound
mind sores high -- far from the ground

he meets the waves like prism to beam
and color comes forth yea with shades of meaning
mind is teaming

Oh what it does to his soul yeh
fuses the young to the old
Oh what it does to his soul yeh
fuses the young to the old
