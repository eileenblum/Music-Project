Wasn't far from Mommy's arms when she came alive
knowledge full up head
an anger it began to thrive

making lists of powers
and drawing up a plan
ready to make her mark and take it to the man

Gonna change the world with rock and roll
or so they say
stopping all abuse -- keeping Africa well fed
reading up on debt reform and politics worldwide
raising her voice she waves her banner high.

Flaming little bottle oh yeh
tattooed on her hand
give her time she'll it man
make you understand and
Traveling to protests oh yea far and wide
feeling high up on ideas
and people by her side

Gonna change the world with rock and roll
or so they say
stopping all abuse -- keeping Africa well fed
reading up on debt reform and politics worldwide
raising her voice she waves her banner high.

Wasn't far from Mommy's arms when she came alive
knowledge full up head
an anger it began to thrive
