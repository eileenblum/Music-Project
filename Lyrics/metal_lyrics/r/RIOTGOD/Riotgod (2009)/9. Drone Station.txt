Drone Station 9 don't sound devine but this is what I chose yeh the mission's mine
been 5 long years I been prepared
first man to go down
ain't a little bit scared -- but nervous -- that I'll give ya
cause soon, I'll be leaving.

From earth - to ship - to station so deep to the great unknown that goddamn sleep

and I'll be on my way.

Can't speak to the press I live in my room - thinking of the chamber that might be my tomb
Yeh -- I'll be gone for Quite a long time -- doctors assure me that all will go fine.
When this all begun -- did a trial run -- year took a minute my revival no fun
sixteen day all feverish dreams
consciousness came kickin' and screamin' - so
nervous -- that I'll give ya
cause soon, I'll be leaving.

From earth - to ship - to station so deep to the great unknown that goddamn sleep

and I'll be on my way.

and I think about that letter
only one they'd let through
from that long ago girl -
yeh oh I'll never forget her
she knew something
that I didn't know
and as I pulled apart the paper
saw the picture there
of my only son
who'll surely die while I'm gone.

And I'll be on my way
on my way
cause I'll be gone
my way
on my way.
