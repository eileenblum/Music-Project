Hall of Mirrors mimic time
beams of truth and lies align
racing by me like a stream
living days of stirring dreams
cold are the stares on me

put up shut up, thatta boy
clock hands minutes juggling toys
hours days my house of cards
swear to god I can see for yards
tight are the snares on me

And the clouds they tremble so
suck back the rain yeh â from the bow
and at tree line he appears,
friend my foe of many years
still
I donât shake, asleep, awake.

Could it be?

Hall of Mirrors mimic time
beams of truth and lies align
racing by me like a stream
living days of stirring dreams
cold are the stares on me

Shutters close things change their form
Hooves they pound before the storm
Ears are tuned eyes know the score
Bets are against me â and I want more.

I see the wolf yeh, âneath the sky
about to fall and I cannot cry

I see the wolf.
