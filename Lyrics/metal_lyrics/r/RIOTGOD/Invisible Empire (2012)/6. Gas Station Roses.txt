I sit alone inside the casual ruins
knowing just what and yeh what not to do
I turn the channel yeh from care to less
Instead of trying to turn bad into bestâ¦
or even better.

Star blessed or star crossed
thatâs what Iâve thought
Time well spent
or time bought
my mind gets caught.

And it never occurred to me
While âround I went

Gaging my fortune while I feel bereft
trying to keep balance while these forces shift
Past and the present form a strange collage
and the future appears like some far-off mirage
changing shape and form

Certain that awful clown
wonât come round no more
heart I remove from that glass
that time has past for sure

And it never occurred to me
While âround I went

Promises empty broken records skipped
Anger and Malice yeh my tongue had slipped
Finally determined, I got off that ride
On honestyâs plane there ainât nowhere to hide

Changing shape and form

Captured visions, long imprisoned
released before my eyes
transferred instance, bridges distance
points in time they collide

Tunnel of love it ainât found in the sewer
Gas station roses canât replace couture
I canât engage in all those games Iâd play
I canât serve up things that I used to say.
