Slick navigation of those tree lined hidden streets
Sweating âway childhood oh in that humid heat
life it unfolded oh a crystalline display
good and bad choices oh were soon to come our way
music it would be there for the triumph and mistakes

And like the world we spun there going âround and âround
drenched in those melodies indoctrinating sound
space time energy and friendships loosely bound
on my vinyl soul â yeh grooves were deeply ground

Quarter pound on Broadway oh in that giant car
Tunnel it was so near but oh so very far
Traffic in midtown so slow during the day
Cop heading for our car â nothing we could say
but heâd only lean his head say âBoys put that weed away.â

And like the world we spun there going âround and âround
drenched in those melodies intoxicating sound
space time energy and friendships loosely bound
on my vinyl soul â yeh grooves were deeply ground

Grooves were deeply ground â on my vinyl soul

And when I hear those songs like echoes from the past
amazed at just what will
and over time just
will not last
