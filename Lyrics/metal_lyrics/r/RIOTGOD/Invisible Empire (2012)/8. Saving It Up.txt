Like the last line on the mirror yeh
or the sweet sip from your cup
light on the face from a beamed forgiver
holding the elevator going up
Like the smile seen after a long long trip
or the kiss under gentle rain
gift of a flower oh so red and sweet
or the embrace that keeps me sane

Savin it up for me
I hope youâre saving it up for me

Memory fond one shared amongst old friends
Warm fire in the deepest wood
Saving my place in a line that has no end
The littlest things make me feel so good

Savin it up for me
I hope youâre saving it up for me

Oh when itâs good â itâs good
Oh when itâs bad â shit change.

Like a sudden trembling of the earth
rogue wave rising from the sea
blue sky turns into deepest grey
to feel a freight train coming full speed
Wild glance that can stop a full grown bull
Cold stare lasting hard and long
Harsh words blaze from a flaming tongue
telling me everything Iâve ever done wrong

Savin it up for me
I hope youâre saving it up for me

Oh when itâs good â itâs good
Oh when itâs bad â shit change.
