Allow me to take your emotions and change them
Grasping so crude to warp and rearrange them

Bathed in the spring by the shore and Iâm standing
tears hit the waves that lick at the landing

Bright green rebirth flowers fall
my soul so tender feels it all

seeing your smile â like a beam change direction
bright are your eyes fresh with affection

Allow me to take my emotions and paint them
colors and shades and hues that debase them

need when unmasked is a quivering creature
previews are done â weâve arrived at the feature

Bright green rebirth flowers fall
my soul so tender feels it all
