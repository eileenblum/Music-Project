So are you quite done playing in the road?
You know it only leads to us
Sure we let you think the choice was yours.

Now our power all returns across shores
We let you think the choice was yours

Turn âround
Face it
Donât deny the path chosen for you

Oh â we have come to reclaim
holiday it is over
did you think we had gone?
What a foolish endeavor
Oh weâve come to reclaim.

So now you know what we expect
and oh in our hands the reigns are kept
We wonât let any tears be wept
and our presence you wonât soon forget.

Turn âround
Face it
Donât deny the path chosen for you

Oh â we have come to reclaim
holiday it is over
did you think we had gone?
What a foolish endeavor
Weâve been here since day one
We are bonded forever
Oh weâve come to reclaim.
