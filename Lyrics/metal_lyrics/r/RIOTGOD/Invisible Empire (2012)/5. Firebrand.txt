The quiver of your smile oh the hardly subtle glint in your eye
like a spoon by a plate
Table it is covered with the finest golden plans and desires
of others who wait
Time for you to rest has come and gone so baby letâs get to work
letâs take care of that need

Nothing is spared from your wide open mind
swallowin flower to seed

Oh â brutal and quick it begins
with beauty defiled
Iâm feeling the universe spin from one so eager and wild
oh, it ainât a matter of need
not one I understand
so carelessly fevered your take
from the eyes, the heart, the hand.

Shaking my head my stomach is turning
half-ghost half-man here I come, The Firebrand
Watching you, learning, alert and discerning
half-ghost half-man here I come, The Firebrand
Radiating child of Satan and Mary
half-ghost half-man here I come, The Firebrand
Watching you, learning, alert and discerning
frequency strong, my scars I am earning.

The quiver of your smile oh the hardly subtle twitch you canât hide
like an unbroken steed

Nothing is spared from your wide open mind
swallowin flower to seed

Oh â brutal and quick it begins
with beauty defiled
Iâm feeling the universe spin from one so eager and wild
oh, it ainât a matter of need
not one I understand
so carelessly fevered your take
from the eyes, the heart, the hand.
