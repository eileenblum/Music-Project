Long ago
I was conceived
Woven from the cloth of dream
Introduced to you by you
Your reality my only scene

I remember things that you are loathe to confess
the beatings and the sadness and the states of duress
Canât have a better friend that one of custom design
Fine â try to keep me in this inner stall.

I ainât no fool
I know what youâre doinâ
I wont go downâ¦
Easy.

No I cannot hold out very long
Gonna make you pay.

Feeding on memories â you chose long ago to throw away.
Synthesizing energies
My revenge relies upon delay.

I will poison comfort with injections of fear
whispers oh Iâll generate just inside your ear
Canât have a better foe than one of custom design
Dying â slowly surely youâll feel my fall.

I ainât no fool
I know what youâre doinâ
I wont go downâ¦
Easy.
