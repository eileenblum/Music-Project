Arise, those night visions smoothly
crossfade eyes open
to daydreams they loop and mix repeat their your fix
under the surface on endless uptime constantly
refined tuned so perfect like an endless signal
sustaining throughout your mind.

Your eyes they trawl and skim like butchers they skim
they find bodies and faces preserved for somewhere
down the line.

From the loaded deck
you pull the perfect hand
merging life and dream
like itâs fucking on-demand
Everything goes as perfectly as planned
before your eyes
warms your insides
before your eyes
never felt so high

Savor it baby
consequence â oh that aint never your concern
Savor it baby
Grease the fucking screw
cryinâ as it turns.

From the loaded deck
you pull the perfect hand
merging life and dream
like itâs fucking on-demand
Everything goes as perfectly as planned
before your eyes
warms your insides
before your eyes
never felt so high
