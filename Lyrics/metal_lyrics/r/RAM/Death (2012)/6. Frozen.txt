The ice inside my chest enslaved me,
I am lost,
Lost in moonlit skies yesterday.
Eyes of the desolate wolf pierce this world of dark.
Iron talons enforce winter.
Time moves ever so slow,
This should have never been.
Your frozen will distorts the dreaming.
Alpha queen of the pack,
Your black fangs attack,
In tears you gnaw the roots of the great tree.

Destiny is broken,
Our pain is blasphemy.
Angels are chocking,
Your heartbeats tyranny.

Turn your back on your life giving dream,
Turn your back and curse everything.

Frozen eyes rend the ancient sky.
Diamond claws cut the soul within.
Paralyzed wings the dreamer's death.

Destiny is broken,
Our pain is blasphemy.
Angels are chocking,
Your heartbeats tyranny.

Destiny is broken,
Our pain is blasphemy.
