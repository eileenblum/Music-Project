I am a circle,
The vortex,
The 0,
Omega incarnate inverted vibrations.
The abyss inside me so black and so cold reaches out through The web of old secrets.
My inner eye sees beyond what is me,
Beyond the illusions and reality,
Ripping and tearing with truths best untold,
Creating the keys to make chaos unfold.

I was born by the living death,
Demons reveal in my breath.
Soulless carrions upon my path.
I am the end.

Sinister preacher of cold hardened steel,
Preaching the gospel of the hidden horned master.
Opening pathways to what lies beyond,
Twisting and turning your brain and perception.
Eye of the void,
World paranoid,
Sheep of the order shattered and destroyed.
Cracks appear in the fragile foundations,
I bring the truth of the new revelations.

I was born by the living death,
Demons reveal in my breath.
Soulless carrions upon my path.
I am the end.

Screaming my weapon of choice,
Rituals performed by the voice.
I am the end.

I was born by the living death,
Demons reveal in my breath.
Soulless carrions upon my path.
I am the end.
