Speeding.
Speeding through the night.
Stolen car candy jar,
Tonight I will see the light.
Under,
Under the influence,
A fire burns within my veins,
Fever,
Acid trance.

Engine screams now it seems like there is no return,
Moonlight beams,
Violent dreams,
I am ready to burn.

Hell's around the corner,
Chaos and disorder,
Riding next to death,
Under the scythe.
The end of my destination,
Narcotics and frustration,
Crashing through the gate,
Under the scythe.

Empty,
Emptiness is all,
All the world has no place for me,
I can hear the reaper call.
Flashes,
Memories in my eyes,
I accelerate into darkness,
Into blackened skies

Engine screams now it seems like there is no return,
Moonlight beams,
Violent dreams,
I am ready to burn.

Hell's around the corner,
Chaos and disorder,
Riding next to death,
Under the scythe.
The end of my destination,
Narcotics and frustration,
Crashing through the gate,
Under the scythe.
