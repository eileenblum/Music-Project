Leashed against my living will to this luminous illusion,
Trapped inside an incarnated dream.
Always striving towards something a feeling deep inside my soul,
A truth to end this neverending lie,
Rebellion wit me screaming,
Screaming for an ancient peace,
A dark of light within the brightest dark,
Not believing the eye deceiving,
The untrue worlds foundation cracks,
I will dissolve it all and set my spirit free.

Pain the pain of burning chains,
Light driving me insane,
Lies,
Reflections of the dream,
Mirrors blinding rays release me

Release me
