Still standing tall,
Our heels upon rotting world.
Tenacious to the bone,
Striking fears int the hearts.

We break the walls,
We break the laws,
Tyrants of the iron faith,
No respect,
No remorse,
No conformation.
We bring the pain,
Power insane,
Upon the bright altar of ohm,
Lords of electric warfare,
Total termination.

Vocal blades that sting,
Possessed am I,
The hidden one sings,
Strings and channelings,
Black star in effect.

We break the walls,
We break the laws,
Tyrants of the iron faith,
No respect,
No remorse,
No conformation.
We bring the pain,
Power insane,
Upon the bright altar of ohm,
Lords of electric warfare,
Total termination.

Flame of the tyrants burning,
Fall to your knees and pray,
A new iron is coming,
Tyrants of the flame consumes you all.

Break your chains,
Clean your head,
Enter the fire and be free,
This is heavy metal tyranny.

We break the walls,
We break the laws,
Tyrants of the iron faith,
No respect,
No remorse,
No conformation.
We bring the pain,
Power insane,
Upon the bright altar of ohm,
Lords of electric warfare,
Total termination.

Flame of the tyrants burning,
Fall to your knees and pray,
A new iron is coming,
Tyrants of the flame consumes you all.
