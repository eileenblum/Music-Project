Born in shackles,
Raised in chains,
Living in spite,
Driven by disdain.
I am just a number,
A resource,
A slave I will never submit,
I am still the same.
All you so called leaders of the lands,
Hear this voice that is soon to be banned,
Opposed to your lies I stand,
I know who you are,

I know what you do through the madness,
Illusions,
Deceit I am unbroken,
Unleashed,
Obssessively chained to the truth,
My fist in the air,
Screaming in fury.
Among the ignorant, blind and insane,
Unwilling to compromise I walk the razors sharp edge.
I am seven and one,
Defiant.

Unchoken,
Unmolded,
Unchainged,
I have conquered my past life bloodstained,
I was never a part of your plans,
I see in the dark, I see how you lurk.

Through the madness,
Illusions,
Deceit I am unbroken,
Unleashed,
Obssessively chained to the truth,
My fist in the air,
Screaming in fury.
Among the ignorant, blind and insane,
Unwilling to compromise I walk the razors sharp edge.
I am seven and one,
Defiant.

Obscure rituals,
Cremation of care,
White line poison a web in the air.
Waging your wars,
Enforcing despair.
I fear no death,
I fear no pain.
My eyes are seeing,
My ears they ears they hear,
My voice is speaking so loud and so clear will fight you til I breath no more,
I will wake those who sleep,
Make wolves out of sheep.

Through the madness,
Illusions,
Deceit I am unbroken,
Unleashed,
Obssessively chained to the truth,
My fist in the air,
Screaming in fury.
Among the ignorant, blind and insane,
Unwilling to compromise I walk the razors sharp edge.
I am seven and one,
Defiant.

Defiant
