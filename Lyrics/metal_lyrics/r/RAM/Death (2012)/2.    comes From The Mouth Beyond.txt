The final strain has broken,
Broken the strings,
Inversion.
The abyss spews as it eats itself.
Time kicks made backwards towards the thirteen hour and drags space with it making it void.

Within the within you are a portal,
Your a vessel of the embodied end your twisted souls declare that the crop is ripe.

A million inner eyes open,
And the world is real again.
Too late your realise it's too late.
Claws turned inside out scratch on the back of your eyes,
Making you see your church within.

Within the within you are a portal,
Your a vessel of the embodied end your twisted souls declare that the crop is ripe.

Death comes from the mouth beyond, sensing that her time has come, you bring forth the end divine.
The scyth of light and snakes entwine.
Hear my curse of doom.
