I close my eyes, soon to be petrified, I spoke a word, a summoning. I wake in fear, strange entities are here, they speak my name, chanting.

Nightmare master, demon, made of darkness, curse of the Shadowman.

I'm paralysed, as if my body has died. I see myself from above. In my bed or is it in my head? This man of black with midnight eyes.

Nightmare master, demon, made of darkness, curse of the Shadowman.

Why have they come for me? What have I done? Darkness enshrouding him, like black fire. Eyes of eternal night search my soul. Curse of the Shadowman, terror in black.

Nightmare master, demon, made of darkness, curse of the Shadowman.
