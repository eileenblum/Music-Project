Controlled by fear, locked up in their sphere, blindfolded army, deceived.
Conception, protection, suspicion, repulsion, aggressive defenders of lies.
They walk alone, they're so far from home, lost victims of illusion.
Submission, suppression, addiction, destruction, ruling the world through a dream.

Here where truth is lies, here where spirits die, let the fallen stand and the standing fall.

My life is a crime, I'm here doing time, awake in the world of the sleeping, frustration, obstruction, confusion, expulsion, at war with the deaf and the blind.
I don't walk alone, we head for the throne, in our wake the fires are burning.
Perception, devotion, restriction, construction, the striken will rise with new eyes.

Here where truth is lies, here where spirits die, let the fallen stand and the standing fall.

Hear it now as I speak what's forbidden, you're just another head in the sea of skulls.
Feel it now it's your second deliverance, rise from the dead in the sea of skulls.
