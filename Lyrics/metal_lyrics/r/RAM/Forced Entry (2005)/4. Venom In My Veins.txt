You come crashing down on me, pull your strings conspire.
You try, to twist me into form.
You think you know it all, coming fast to conclusion
You're always right I'm always wrong.

Hate, fire, burns, sick, dying.
I can't escape this pain of venom in my veins.

I was harassed and pushed around, a victim of you power.
For your games I paid the price.
Now you've turned to regret, but there is not forgiveness.
I will rise as you will fall.

Hate, fire, burns, sick, dying.
I can't escape this pain of venom in my veins.
