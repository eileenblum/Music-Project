Strongest, Metal force to rise up from the north,
We are standing tall.
Sudden impact strikes, our time has come, our time is now.
It was forged in steel, before it you will crawl and you will kneel, the hammer shakes the earth, defy and you will die.

You can run but you can't hide, it cannot be denied.

Commanding hellish voice, controlled mayhemic noise, we're running wild, obedient masses trash, mangeled and abused.
Axes screaming loud, crazed, chaotic crowd , full force attack, electric ritual, it's Metal genocide.

You can run but you can't hide, it cannot be denied.
RAM unleashed, electric, armoured, ferocious beast
RAM unleashed, gigantic, destructive, sonic fist.

Heavy Metal lords delivering power chords you can't scape. 
It has just begun, stand back or get rammed.
No force can stop the RAM,
No God, no beast or man, not anything.
On your knees and pray, that you will be save.

You can run but you can't hide, it cannot be denied
RAM unleashed, electric, armoured, ferocious beast
RAM unleashed, gigantic, destructive, sonic fist.
