Twilight, I am frozen. The veil of pain, shrouds and brings me back again. Alone with heavy thoughts, this heart is chained to truth. I',m still here, veteran of inner wars, darkness falls, I can feel the claws of life.

Time heals all wounds but, not these burning scars.

Ghosts from the past, whisper in shadows, voices call, demons soar above my head. Lost in the dark. sorrow steals the dawn. Don't be fooled by what eyes can see, striving on, bearing the memories.

Time heals all wounds but, not these burning scars.
One with burning scars.
