Damnation, a fiery whip strikes within.
Tormentor, manic, supressive aggressor inside.
Dark spirit, has chained itself to my spine.
Doom pilot, spiritual werewolf is now in command.

I am the host, host of the beast.
Controlled by another, possessed but aware.

Soulstinger, screaming it's orders with hate.
Ghost tyrant, enforcing it's cruel, vicious plan of revenge.

I am the host, host of the beast.
Controlled by another, possessed but aware.

Possessed by a being obssessed, cravin the sweat and the lights.
Controlled, inner chokehold, driven through fire and ice.
Possessed by a being obssessed, burning my way  through the lies.
Controlled, inner chokehold, unstoppable slaver unbound.

I am the host, host of the beast.
Controlled by another, possessed but aware.
