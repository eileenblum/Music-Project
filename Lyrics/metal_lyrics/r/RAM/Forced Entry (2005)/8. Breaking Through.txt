Iron will, that will not bend, determinated till the very end.
A silent scream inside your soul is making you thrust towards your goal.
Can see the odds, can't give a damn, only charging forward till this war is won.
They see the power in your gaze, anything in your way you raze.

There's no sign of decline, you were born to strive on towards victory, you will stand to see them fall.
In a world of deceit you are driven forth, bring it on.
Breaking through, make it true.
Breaking through.

Your path is hard, your path is sharp, you're walking through fire in the dark.
A fire burns, consuming all, you're blind to everything but the call.
Some are cut, you bring demise, innocent blood must be sacrified.
A vow is made to reach the top, you know you can't be stopped.

There's no sign of decline, you were born to strive on towards victory, you will stand to see them fall.
In a world of deceit you are driven forth, bring it on.
Breaking through, make it true.
Breaking through, make it true.
