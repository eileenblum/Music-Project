Thereâs a new dawn on the rise
And I see it with new eyes
Iâm breaking my old chains
And my darkened path goes on,
It leads me to my throne,
My crown is called revenge

Rising from my corpses ashes to greet the rising sun
I feel fire in my blackened self, a burning certainty
The bite of the luminous serpent has given me new life,
I was wrong holding my own leash,
Iâm a god unstoppable

I mount the throne prepared within,
King of gods and god of kings, through war,
Through blood, through fire, ascend

I see my will manifesting, I enforce divine law,
I see through the illusory prison,
The force that is me turns your world to dust
You can never enslave me with fear again,
Freedom is all that I am,
Iâm rising and towering over all, titan

I mount the throne prepared within,
King of gods and god of kings, through war,
Through blood, through fire, ascend

I mount the throne prepared within,
King of gods and god of kings, through war,
Through blood, through fire, ascend
