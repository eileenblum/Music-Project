In the abyss, the darkness of the minds
Nine eyes open on three heads
An ancient terror, black monstrosity,
Awakens and belows out in hate

Anti trinity, heretics divinity is alive and
Thirst for war
Itâs prison has decayed, heroâs ideals betrayed,
Civilization a dead idea

Your hollow world has lost itâs meaning
Your god is dead

From the pits the threeheaded one
Arises in fury
Earthquakes, lightning, poisoned strikes,
It attacks relentlessly
Behold the chimaera
Your towers high, your golden temples
All has become ash
All your dreams are nightmares now as the
Monster stalks inside

In the scorching wake of the antispirit,
Truth arises and a new world
Legions march!

Lion, serpent and ram, forged with a
Blackhole heart
Fire, venom, tenacity
Mystic energies align, opposites connect
As itâs spine
Blood boiling fury shakes the earth

Your hollow world has lost itâs meaning
Your god is dead

From the pits the threeheaded one
Arises in fury
Earthquakes, lightning, poisoned strikes,
It attacks relentlessly
Behold the chimaera
Your towers high, your golden temples
All has become ash
All your dreams are nightmares now as the
Monster stalks inside

In the scorching wake of the antispirit,
Comes death
