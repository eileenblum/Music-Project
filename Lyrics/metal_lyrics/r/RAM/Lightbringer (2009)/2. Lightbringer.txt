Destiny has brought you here
Escaping from the claws of fear
To this unknown realm of secrecy and pain

What can you trust? What is real?
What does this chasm in your mind conceal?
Who are you? Gazing in to the abyss

Secrets, darkness, mental void
Awaken, blinding thoughts destroy
Words of truth are calling you
Desolation is the saviour they can never subdue

Serpents are rising in darkness
Uncoiling in obscurity

To crack the cross and scorn the laws
To greet death and feel itÂ´s claws
You need a mind of steel and a burning soul

To turn your back on the indolent world
And see barren wastelands unfurl
You need a will divine and a treaty with the unknown

The sting of truth, behind the masque
Lightbringer
