The world as we know it in ruins,
Mankind is extinct. Machines strook
Before we could react

The genesis software project,
Multi network control
Steered whatever was online to kill

Our last escape was dying, to leave our
Flesh to fight. We enter digital systems
A ghost pilot

A few of us had the key,
A new technology
A chip that could read and write
Lifeforce

We uploaded our minds, left our body as
A shell, to infect and infiltrate

Our last escape was dying, to leave our
Flesh to fight. We enter digital systems
A ghost pilot

We pit machine against machine, 
human living virus. Last hope for
Humanity, the digital resistance

Our last escape was dying, to leave our
Flesh to fight. We enter digital systems
A ghost pilot

We pit machine against machine, 
human living virus. Last hope for
Humanity, the digital resistance
