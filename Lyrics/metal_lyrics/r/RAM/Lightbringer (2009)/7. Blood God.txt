Attention, form a line, canât you hear the alarms of duty call?
Protection of our ways, our terrible immoral foe must fall

I break you down, make you kneel
The pressure of the world you feel
Youâre given arms told to fight
Donât try to see whatâs wrong from right
Youâre too small, Iâm too great
In my hand I hold your fate,
Thou shall kill, thou shall burn, 
through you my foes will learn, that
I am the lord, Iâm the bloodgod

Illusion, grand deceit, thoughts are planted in your feeble mind
Intrusion of your life, disinformation makes you blind

I break you down, make you unreal
The pressure of the world you feel
Youâre given lies told as truth
You donât need to see the proof
Iâm too great, youâre too small
To ask questions when towers fall
Thou shall not see, thou shall not hear
Thou shall only fear and fear,
âcause I am the lord, Iâm the bloodgod

Conclusion, selfsecurity, I am me, I rule my destiny
Envision, I see my path. Your dirty lies cannot reach within

I wonât be broken, I wonât kneel 
No pressure breaks this spine of steel
I am armed, I will fight
Iâm a one man murder squad full of spite
Iâm too great, standing tall, I will stand to see you fall
Here I stalk among your slaves 
Who are marching of towards their graves,
âcause I wonât spill my blood for the bloodgod
