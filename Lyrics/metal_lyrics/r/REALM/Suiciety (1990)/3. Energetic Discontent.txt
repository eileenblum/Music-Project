Look into the mirror that holds my sanity
Searching for questions, answers I hear
Release me from this prison, I can`t stand the pain
Obsession (depression)
Confusion (repression)
Decay

Energetic discontent
A screw is loose, my mind is bent
Energetic discontent
Product of society`s descent

I want someone to listen
I don`t know what to say
I need someone to be there
So I can be alone
I want someone to use me
Make me feel disturbed
Continued torment dwells inside
And turns to bitter ... violent, ... hateful, ... acts !

Energetic discontent
A screw is loose, my mind is bent
Energetic discontent
Product of society`s descent

Why did you lie to me ? Why ?
Why did you brainwash me with fear ? Why ?
I`ll make you pay for the desceit, you`ll pay

Energetic discontent
A screw is loose, my mind is bent
Energetic discontent
Your lying eyes breed violent, contempt
