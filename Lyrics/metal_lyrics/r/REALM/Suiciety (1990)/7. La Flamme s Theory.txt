Twisted thinking, what`s next ?
No more nightmares, they`re real
Maybe tomorrow you`ll know
Knowledge that hides is found

Someday you`ll see
There is this madman
Somaday you`ll see

Revelations, running wild
Risking death for the dead
Raging inflection, insight
Concentration to unveil

Someday you`ll see
To find a madman ...
Someday you`ll see
But it will be too late
To stop his dreams ...

13, he`s out there somewhere
Learning to control his psychotic dreams
Picking at brains
Remains on the curb from a dead dog
What kind of child is this ?
What does the future hold ?

You`ll see what I hope to find
Your respect will be mine
Fame and praise in time
I will look inside, my theory to prove

He`s working, the mind and the spirit
Sickness lost deep within himself, going insane
Secrets untold for your own good
What kind of man is this ?
What does the future hold ?

You`ll see what I hope to find
Your respect will be mine
It will be mine

Looking for the key to set the spirit free
