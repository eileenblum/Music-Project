Black is the vision before me
Fear of mass devastation
Time for another messiah
Death the final solution

Millions dying for a cause
The few deciding all our laws
Swear yourself to church and state
Corporate profits are at stake

Blackest evil now controls the power thrones of earth
Metal masters mangle minds of intoxicated youth
Corrupted senile generals are nuclear obsessed
Dropping bombs, creating mutants that want to eat your flesh

It seems as though our future is hopeless
Rebels are now conformists
Fight for the truth you will win
Surrender your hope you will die

You must take what you can get to satisfy your greed
Forget the starving helpless innocent that bleed
Holocaustal prophecies envisioned now come true
Victims of our ignorance and the poisoned minds of fools
