Open your eyes to what will be lost in time
Our mother is dying, out father is waiting to judge

Knowledge without reason contaminates the truth
Time is against the wickedness of man

Acid rain, toxic waste
Fragile earth
Victims, you`re the cause
Plague upon the world

Forests die, polluted skies
Fragile earth
Victims, buried in waste
Legacy of man

Kill my world
Kill your earth, now

To start now is too late
Yet we wait, with no time left
Come on open your eyes to what will be lost

Barren wasteland
The end ...
