I was on the highway headed east to El Paso
On the road all night, just 300 miles to go
The desert sun was hot it came to claim its toll
You know the road can hypnotize

The sky grew dark, storm winds began to blow
I couldn`t see the road I no longer had control
Kidnapped by an unknown force, journey to its cryptic source
I tried to resist

Blinded by darkness
Black hole draws me in
Grips my soul and body
Strips my mind of fear
Lifetimes pass away
Death and hate collide
My eyes are witness
My spirit free

Trapped in vortex I grasped infinity
Anything I dreamed became reality
Distant words were mine
Time and space converged
I was a prisoner lost in eternity

Somehow made it back to where I was before
The desert vision died the wisdom in me grew
Earth is but a womb life is our conception
Preparing us for birth into a new dimension

Somewhere in the desert on the open road
Gateway to another void beyond this world
Don`t try to find it, it has no control
The price for your journey may be your sanity
