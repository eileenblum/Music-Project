Visions of mind, the power invested within
A force to conceive, effecting the world, standing alone ...
No ! You can`t take my mind, I don`t know you
I won`t go with you, don`t influence my mind

Stand all alone, undamaged by your fears
Born to conquer walls, thoughts ahead in years
In touch with the future, pour forth thoughts portrayed

Will we ever understand, all that he`s foreseen
What lies behind his eyes, behold, the brainchild

Strange to common man, visionary obsessed
Possessed to create, believe the feeling soul
See through the mind`s eye, hear those voices inside

Will we ever understand, all that he`s foreseen
What lies behind his eyes, behold, the brainchild

I will not give up my mind

I won`t listen anymore to the media wars
I must not conform, endure the mental strain
Believe what I say, powers of your soul

Will we ever understand, all that he`s foreseen
What lies behind his eyes, behold, the brainchild

Possess the spirit, inspiration felt from the force
Never accepting what`s been done before, standing alone ...
