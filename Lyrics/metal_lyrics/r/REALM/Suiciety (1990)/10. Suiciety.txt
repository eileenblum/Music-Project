Do or die, the time has come to destroy the system
Soon we`ll be free
Set time for detonation, the bomb lay at my feet
Smoke my last cigarette, mission now complete

All were born into the system, every need provided for
Programmed into conformity, deviants destroyed
Built to help us, in time it took control
I must fight to save our minds
Master of forgotten knowledge
Breeding ignorance at our expense

Why are we so blind ?
One by one it slaughters us
We must not be blind
Stand and fight, destroy the system

The time has come, we have no choise
Must kill the system, to set ourselves free
Detonation time is set, a bomb lay at my feet
A fair trade for freedom, death or defeat

Some are immune to the mind control
But how can they pretend ?
Deviants can be detected
Curiosity condemned by death

I can see through the guise
My mind is my own
I can break the hold
Time is short, the system knows

Suiciety
Suiciety

I`m not afraid to kill myself
I took the bomb I made and ran
To the heart of the system
Level 10, sector 3
