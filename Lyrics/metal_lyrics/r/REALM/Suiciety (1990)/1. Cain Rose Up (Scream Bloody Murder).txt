Cain rose up
Climbing into my head ... Scream
Scream bloody murder
Cain in us all
Forcing some evil deed ... Scream
Scream bloody murder

Halls echoing footsteps
Lost before the grave
Killing time is near
You know that ...

Cain rose up
Shadows in every room ... Scream
Scream bloody murder
Cain in us all
Alive inside of you ... Scream
Scream bloody murder

Can you feel him, rising up ?
Are you willing to harden your heart ?
Don't harden your heart, no, no !
You start to anger when cain rose up and up and up
Can`t you feel it ?

Look up to the window
Explain my desire
I unload, open fire

It`s not the thrill of the game
It`s not the pleasure of pain
It`s what you feel from cain
