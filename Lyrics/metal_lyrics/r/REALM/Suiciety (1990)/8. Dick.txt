Sick of living the same old way
I wish everything would go away
Hanging out drinking whisky at the bar
Closing time and I get into my car

See Dick live
See Dick drive
See Dick drink
See Dick die
See Dick die

Crusin` home gonna push it faster
So messed up really doesn`t matter
Sharp tuned I almost spilled
Didn`t see those people I killed

See Dick live
See Dick drive
See Dick drink
See Dick die
See Dick die

Now Dick made his own hell
The bars he sees keeps him in his cell
Happens everyday

He sits back doing his time
Going over the crime in his mind
It never goes away

How can you sleep at night ?
Never meant to take anyone`s life
Nothing left to say
