[The wise old sailor:]
"Don't go! No one's ever returned
Heed my words - greed exploits your fate
I've seen her walk the shore by night
Imprisoned in her eternal lust
Heed my words - it's suicide
Her fortune's not worth your life
You'll die..."

[The greedy young treasure hunter:]
"Drunken senile fool, don't force your fears on me
I don't believe in legends, I do believe in greed
I will return to laugh in your face
You'll feel the disgrace
Prove your words untrue"

Trembling skies and threatening seas
Welcome our journey's end
Somewhere on this forgotten shore
Wealth or death transcends
I hear the old man's words
They echo in my head
Transformed into reality
Spirit of the dead

[The greedy young treasure hunter:]
I've seen her walk the shore by night
Imprisoned in her eternal lust
Heed my words - it's suicide
Her fortune's not worth your life
You'll die, you'll die, you'll die..."
