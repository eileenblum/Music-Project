Sparked by imagination, fueled by discontent
Visions of the future, arson to prevent

What did she see, why can't she tell
What force does possess this fiery threat

This house is burning
Down to the ground

The flames must be real
She's alive engulfed in the fire

I know what what she sees, the secret I hold
The torch I inherit, the serpent's breath

Heat-seeking Hell Child, cremating the souls
Everything up in a blaze
Incineration
First degree burns
Throwing it all in the flames
The fire is spreading
Breathing in smoke
Endless inferno disaster
Smoldering ruins
This house is burning
Everywhere all around ashes
