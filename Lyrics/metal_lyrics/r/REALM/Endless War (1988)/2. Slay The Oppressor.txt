The battle is over we've won the war
By evil no longer abide
Remember The Lamb, The Life Covenant
As you're strapping a sword to your side

Slay The Oppressor
We must stand against the Legions of Hell
Slay The Oppressor
We must not be victims to his...

...evil plots against man
scouring with hate
knows the Lord
that they'll soon be destroyed!

"Satan will be set free
To deceive the nations of the world
He will bring them together for battle
And surround the City of God
Fire came down from Heaven
And destroyed them
Satan was cast into the Lake of Fire
Tormented forever"
