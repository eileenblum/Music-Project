In this world no one's free
Blood spills still we do not see
The horrors of one thousand wars
Those who died without a cause

The battle rages on and on
Without victor without end

As we live in luxury
Countless starve upon the streets
Children crying out in pain
Children dying who is to blame

Does no one listen to their calls
Victims of the endless war

Pools of blood, flood city streets
Another victim, lies lifeless at my feet
He was stabbed to death
When he did not confess
He swore he was innocent
Now he's a bloody mess

Caught in the crossfire, bullet to the head
Rushed her to the hospital, D.O.A. dead

In the name of God almighty, they sent their child to die
Martyr with no fear of death, a promised paradise
Countless bloody victims
Scream in misery
Slaughtered without reason
Bound in agony

The battle rages on and on
Without victor without end

Does no one listen to their calls
Victims of the endless war
