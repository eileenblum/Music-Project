My heart pounds with fury
Nightmare cease to exist
Oh Lord give me strength
I must face the beast within

All my life something's been calling
Who has filled me with this longing
Why is the world so cold
The sun shines but I cannot smile
Something deep inside me has died

I don't know how long I can carry on this lie

Awoken by the pounding in the distance
Relentlessly it shook my soul
Where does it come from, why do I only hear
I ran to witness what I knew I would see
Blood red skies engulfed the hill
I could not hold back my tears
There he was on the cross
He was dying
Nobody cared
