In my dreams I fly
The meanings are unclear
I've been here before
Victim of fear

Fate's wind, carry me home
Help me forget

Life is so empty without you
Time is a cell without a key
I can't face this world of confusion
Land of dreams, set me free

Falling star burst into flames
Slice through the walls of yesterday
I stand before the oracle
Unveil, my destiny

Overland I reach and tear the sky
Truth pours through the hole and drowns my heart
I cannot breathe the tears and understand
Strolling through the refuge of the end

Life is so empty without you
Time is a cell without a key
