Through the sands of time
Mysteries of life I did find
Though I walk on hallowed land
He's come to take my hand

He said, "your moment has come
For I am the chosen one
Many people give praise to me
For this is my second coming"

Through the blinding light
Which has blurred my sight
Things that I have seen
Mere mortals would not believe
