Time has left its scars
Renditions forged in fear
Torment ridden eyes
Reveal your deepest lies

You're poisoned from within
Convinced to never win

Bound and gagged
Freedom screams again
The truth you know but still avoid
Crucified by pride

You're poisoned from within
Convinced to never win

Alone in crowded rooms
Possessed by solitude
Any time you feel the need
Any time you take for greed

You're poisoned from within
Convinced to never win

Brainwashed to act their way
Free me from this man-made hell

No one can live my life
No one is completely right
Only you can feel yourself
Once you know that you will
