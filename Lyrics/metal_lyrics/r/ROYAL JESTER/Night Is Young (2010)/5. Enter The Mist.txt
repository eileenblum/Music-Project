Tonight the power that is in control of all
Will weaken and vanish to be
Unite in flower the thorn is standing tall
In haze there is no spell to make your sanity withdraw

In darkness the truth of life is waiting
The secrets of why we were born
A fire that burns within us all
Get out there and answer the call

So enter the mist it all comes so clear
I stay for tomorrow I hope you'll be here
We hide from the sunlight 'til morning draws near
There's nothing to fear

So now I see you, you're deep within my reach
Remain here until we're alone
So just let it all flow don't let creature decide
Don't let you conscience stand in your way

Feelings that you've kept a secret for so long
are finally about to be freed
Your heart is speaking loud emotions flying free
Will they be answered in time

So enter the mist it all comes so clear
I stay for tomorrow I hope you'll be here
We hide from the sunlight 'til morning draws near
There's nothing to fear

So enter the mist it all comes so clear
I stay for tomorrow I hope you'll be here
We hide from the sunlight when morning draws near
There's nothing to fear

I just can't resist I just want you near
For now 'til tomorrow 'til sunlight is here
For now and forever please hold back that tear.
The vision is clear

Please enter the mist
