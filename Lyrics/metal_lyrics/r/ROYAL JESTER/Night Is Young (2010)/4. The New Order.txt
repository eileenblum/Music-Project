When all my lies are turning true
And the gate has opened for you
the hour may not he too late
My voice is powerful to hear
All the people will gather near
To pursue my dream of hate

My will shall be the law
All of your strength I withdraw

The time has come for justice to reign
All you fools will burn under my order
The time is here (or our land to tear
All the false that claim to be here

Now your luck is turning back
I commence the attack
There is no escape from the long claw of the law

I will burn what you have built without any guilt
There is no escape from the fire in my heart

Trapped in my net you're caught
Unteaching all you have taught
The time has come for justice to reign..

Termination of the weaker ones that steal
What we built for so long
Seek the guilty ones that fee1 our anger
And fear do not let one of them live

Silence is heard in your hall
I am the one that stand tall

The time has come for justice to reign
All you fools will burn under my order
The time is here (or our land to tear
All the false that claim to be here
