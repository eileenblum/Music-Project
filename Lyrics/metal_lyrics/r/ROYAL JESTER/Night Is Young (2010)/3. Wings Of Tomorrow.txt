Down in confusion you're all on your own
But light will shine one day
Times of sorrow gathering
You need to keep your hope

I see a ray of light
Shine up my way
Finally now I can be free
There comes a day when we all come together
And all of our fears will be washed away
Together we fly on the wings of tomorrow
Just look up and reach for the sky

Darkness surrounds me I'm searching for you
Who can be my guide in life
Embrace me and shelter me up in the night
Until the break of dawn

I see a ray of light
Shine up my way
Finally now I can be free

There comes a day when we all come together
And all of our fears will be washed away
Together we fly on the wings of tomorrow
Just look up and reach for the sky
For the sky!

Oh...

There comes a day when we all come together
And all of our fears will be washed away
Together we fly on the wings of tomorrow
Just look up and reach for the sky
Far away!

Together we fly on the wings of tomorrow
Just look up and reach for the sky
For the sky!
