I wonder what I should say
To break down your wall
When near I want you to stay
Come and make me fall

Cause if you were mine we leave worries behind
Never to walk alone

When I see your smile I know it
Gives me something to believe in
Why are you so far away

Would you go all the way
If you were mine
Nothing could stand in our way
Give me a sign
Would you do all you say
If you were mine
We could spend our lives together
Give me a sign now

I travel the world all alone
Sailing on my own
I'm searching the treasure of life

Sometimes the storm rages and
Oceans are treacherous
Where is the pearl like a
Light in the dark

Look into your eyes I feel
All of paradise is real
Why are you so far away

Would you go all the way
If you were mine
Nothing could stand in our way
Give me a sign
Would you do all you say
If you were mine
We could spend our lives together
Give me a sign now

I would go all the way
Wish you were mine
I'll give you the key to my heart
Give me a sign
How can we make the day
If you were mine
We could live as mine forever
If you were mine
