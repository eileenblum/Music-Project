They'll never know who I am
I'm a Judas in disguise
I'm the nightmare that they
Were too blind to see

Deep in the night
As the stars shine so bright
I will get my revenge and I'll
Make you regret all your crimes
I'll claim the throne
Make this kingdom my own
I'm your own royal jester that makes
You cry when you should smile

False prophets told by the jester
It is just my way to deal with
The merciless people who
Put me through this hell

They cast me out with no doubt
But now I have returned
For this moment I have
Yearned

Deep in the night
As the stars shine so bright
I will get my revenge and I'll
Make you regret all your crimes
I'll claim the throne
Make this kingdom my own
I'm your own royal jester that makes
You cry when you should smile

And I will be the king

Who is the jester today
Now your days are counted and
I will reign

Deep in the night
As the stars shine so bright
I will get my revenge and I'll
Make you regret all your crimes
I'll claim the throne
Make this kingdom my own
I'm your own royal jester that makes
You cry when you should smile

And I will be the king
