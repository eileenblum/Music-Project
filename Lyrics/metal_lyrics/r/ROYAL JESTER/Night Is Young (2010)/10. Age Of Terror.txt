There was a time when our ignorance
Held us at bay so we could not know
But now the word's spreading with the wind
The time to take action is now

They built a faÃ§ade
To keep us from knowing the truth

The revolution is inevitable
You dug your own grave and now we will strike

The age of terror is here again
No one to trust but yourself in this world
The age of error has come at last
Fight for yourself is the only conclusion

Before we spoke of the heresy
But now the difference is hard to see
Exploited lands full of agony
There's nothing left for us to be
Now burn the faÃ§ade, make people aware of truth

The age of terror is here again
No one to trust but yourself in this world
The age of error has come at last
Fight for yourself is the only conclusion

Blindfolded we have been left in this illusion
that they created to rule mankind
We must unveil what is right before our eyes
To see what may be behind

Now no more faÃ§ade, nothing to be hidden from us
The revolution was inevitable
Get on your knees and receive our wrath

The age of terror is here again
No one to trust but yourself in this world
The age of error has come at last
Fight for yourself is the only conclusion
