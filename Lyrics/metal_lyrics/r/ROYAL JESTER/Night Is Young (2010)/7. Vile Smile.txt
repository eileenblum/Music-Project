In the dark of the night he appears
Waking up all my fears
Cannot see if he's real
I see myself for him kneel

Who is this Harlequin that keeps me wake
I recognize his face although it's fake

This terror is unending
The jester smile
I see the light descending
Oh so vile

Try to tell him to leave me alone
Do not challenge the king, but his powers have grown
I hear his raw laughter ring

Please tell me that it's just a dream of mind
But everything seems real I can't be blind

Cold is spreading in my royal room
I hear whispers of doom
There's a figure unclear, cannot see if he's near

This terror is unending
The jester smile
I see the light descending
Oh so vile

King you have been a fool, now you will be my tool

Now I feel my wrath creeping up
You'd better believe
This is not a joke, you will see

This terror is unending
The jester smile
I see the light descending
Oh so vile

I have foreseen my own doom
The jester smile
I'm not alone in my room
Oh so vile
