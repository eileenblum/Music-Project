Here we are tired and hungry
We've gone so far to reach our goal
We will go through fire for glory and wealth
To reveal our desire

Yesterday we were 200 light years away
But now we're here
Many have doubted and many have failed
But today we will harvest our gold

On this day we are right where we're meant to be
The night is young the show has just begun
Have no fear when the jester is near
It's just a sign that still the night is young

Many said that we couldn't make it
They put us down but we kept the flame burning
No matter what and no matter how
We will prove that they were wrong

They want us to be as afraid of the sky as they are
But we are fearless
Scorn kept us going the power was growing
And spirit of youth was our guide

On this day we are right where we're meant to be
The night is young the show has just begun
Have no fear when the jester is near
It's just a sign that still the night is young

And as we reach for the sky
We know we never can die
We must believe we can fly
Over the mountains and seas

Never give in to your fears
You mist go all the way
Show them that you are your own
Alone

On this day we are right where we're meant to be
The night is young the show has just begun
Have no fear when the jester is near
It's just a sign that still the night is young

On this day we are right where we're meant to be
The night is young the show has just begun
Have no fear when the jester is near
It's just a sign that still the night is young
