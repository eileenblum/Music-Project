When there's no sky above to behold
Our cruel fate has been unfold
When there's no way to stand the
Vengeance that is falling down over us

We are the ones who took the command
We shaped the world by our band
We forged the steel and we draw
The lines with blood in the desert sand

The final winter is here and the battles are raging
End of the world as we know it will we be

Born again will sun rise tomorrow
Who will carry the flame
will love there to lead us from horror
Will hate pass on to our next generation
Rise again will mankind be wiser
Or will hate an deceit win
If you seek a guilty you only need
To cast a gaze in the mirror

Darkness is falling over our kind
Surround us mankind us blind
Our bones are dust and
Evolution's finally left us behind
The final winter has come and the humans are
burning
End of the world is here why could not we see

Born again will sun rise tomorrow
Who will carry the flame
will love there to lead us from horror
Will hate pass on to our next generation
Rise again will mankind be wiser
Or will hate an deceit win
If you seek a guilty you only need
To cast a gaze in the mirror
