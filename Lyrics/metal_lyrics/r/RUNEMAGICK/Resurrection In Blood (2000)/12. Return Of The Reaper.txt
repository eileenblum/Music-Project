[Rudolfsson]

Souls of darkness arise
Arise from the dark paradise
Their name is carved in stone
A monument over their bones

The dead will now come back
Follow the master of death, the reaper

Return of the reaper
Return of the dead

They have come to conquer the earth
In a morbid way of rebirth
They follow the master of death
To take your last breath

The dead will now come back
And destroy your life track

Return of the reaper
Return of the dead

Return of the dead
Obey the dead
Return of the dead
Or become a living dead

Return of the reaper
Return of the dead
