[Rudolfsson]

And death when it came
Was like a blessed release
It opened my eyes
For the dark dimension

I greet you death
Come and take my soul
I hail you death
Take my last breath

On dark wings of death
I enter the portal
I will now be a dweller
In the kingdom of the dead

I greet you death
Come and take my soul
I hail you death
Take my last breath

Hail death
Praise death
Hail death
I greet you death

Greeting death
