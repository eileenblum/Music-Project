[Rudolfsson]

Oh lord of the grave
Give me what I crave
Oh lord of the grave
The dark side is what I crave

Guide me on the paths
To the dark kingdom
Let me enter the gates
Of the grave world

Lord of the grave
Master of the dead
Take my soul
To your dark grave world

Oh lord of the grave
Let my soul into your realm
Oh lord of the grave
Let me enter your kingdom
I will serve the dark side
If you let me in darkness dwell
Open your gates
Let me pass away

Lord of the grave
Master of the dead
Take my soul
To your dark grave world
