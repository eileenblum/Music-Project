[Rudolfsson]

A realm where everything is dead
Tormented souls and bodies without heads
This is where all dark and dead dwells
There is no paradise, this is hell

This is your eternal destiny

Dominion of the necrogods

They feast on your burning soul
Tear it apart to thousand pieces
Here you will forever stay
This is your eternal hell

There is no escape from the necrogods

Dominion of the necrogods
