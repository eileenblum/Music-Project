[Rudolfsson]

Cold black night
Ritual candle light

Necromancers gathered
Around my grave
Whispering ancient spells
Forbidden since long time

Summoning my soul
From the other side
Channeling the force
To the remains of my corpse

Reborn in necromancy

"Lords of death, give us the power
release the soul, bring life to the bones"

The tomb starts to shake 
The necromancers raising
The sign in the sky
My body is alive again

Reborn in necromancy
