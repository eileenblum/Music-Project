[Rudolfsson]

In solitude it dwells
Beyond the eyes of light
In a world of darkness
Where no other life remains

Withered black wings
A creature of the unknown

You can not see
The shadow of the one
Without no human soul
Flesh and bones

Demonstrosity
Spawn of obscurity

A forgotten abyss
In the heart of the dark
A home for the demon
Spawned beyond our time

Cold black eyes
A creature of the unknown

You can not see
The shadow of the one
Without no human soul
Flesh and bones

Demonstrosity
Spawn of obscurity
