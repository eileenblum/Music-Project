[Music: N. Rudolfsson]
[Lyrics: N. Rudolfsson]

Black clothes are on and my life is gone
Coffin carried by pale faced ghosts
Silhouettes in the mist slowly moves
On paths of frost to the emperor of doom

Behold the death

Creatures of the dead show me the way
Guide me to the land of darkness, death and doom

Funeral Caravan
A journey to the emperor
Of doom

I feel the breeze of the gates of death
The jaws of Hades howl
Choirs of doom chants the words of darkness
I now behold the triumphant realm

Behold the death

Creatures of the dead take my soul
I am one with the land of darkness, death and doom

Funeral Caravan
A journey to the emperor
Of doom

Funeral Caravan
A journey to the emperor
Of doom
