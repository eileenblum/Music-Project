[Lyrics: E. Karlsson]

Enter the fields, the fields of no life
Feel the emptiness
Watch time as it pass you by
Can you see the things you longed for
Can you see the black wall
What's behind - You can see in your mind
Enter the hills, the hills of no life
Feel the emptiness - Feel the grief
Where is all that you desire
Can you see the black warrior
What will you choose
Run and die or stay and get killed

Call out to eternal darkness - Darkness of life

Enter the woods, the woods of no life
Feel the emptiness
Listen to the silence
Shadows speak to you
Do you see the black mirror
Is there any reflections
Look down, deep down in your soul
A soul you don't know

Call out to eternal darkness - Darkness of life
