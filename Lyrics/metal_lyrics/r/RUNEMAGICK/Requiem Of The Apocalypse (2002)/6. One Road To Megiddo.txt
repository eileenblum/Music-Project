[Music: N. Rudolfsson]
[Lyrics: Whiplasher Europa]

The paths lie empty so silent so young 
The Pleiades lick the roads with a silvery tongue 

The distance shrieks and icons crack 
Never was forever but now that time is back 

.When death rolls upon the table of the gods! 

Breathe in damnation 
Equilibrium falls for my temptation 
Utopia decays 
Demons and angels stand face to face 

One road to Megiddo 
Chaos cries and cherubs die for the lord of flies 
One road to Megiddo 
Spit on time's hand; bite the lands with the fire's fangs 
Megiddo Breakdown 

Morning comes as death 
Hovering upon the Westside path 
The altar is crushed 
And so heaven was blood and blood was rust 

And the fields crawl in ashes 
And shields break for the whiplashes 
And the juxtaposed worlds collide 
It's like dagger in the head of a child 

Breathe in damnation 
Equilibrium falls for my temptation 
Utopia decays 
Demons and angels stand face to face 

One road to Megiddo 
Chaos cries and cherubs die for the lord of flies 
One road to Megiddo 
Spit on time's hand; bite the lands with the fire's fangs 
Megiddo Breakdown
