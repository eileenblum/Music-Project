[Music: N. Rudolfsson]
[Lyrics: N. Rudolfsson]

Every dawn fades in misery and solitude
Weak flames on fragile candles fighting with the winds
The dead speaks with serpent tongues cold as ice
No sleep for the one who fall into the abyss, of desolation

Nocturnal requiem keeps the blood warm
The eyes of fire feed a dying soul
There is something unknown that soon shall appear
Time shall tell when blood dries

Requiem of the apocalypse
A new aeon will rise
When ancient time dies

Remains of the past withered plains
Can't be repaired by any gods or magic
Soul suffocation can't be the end
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law

Nocturnal requiem keeps the blood warm
The mirrors of desire feed a dying soul
There is something unknown that soon shall appear
Time shall tell when blood will unite

Requiem of the apocalypse
A new aeon will rise
When ancient time dies
