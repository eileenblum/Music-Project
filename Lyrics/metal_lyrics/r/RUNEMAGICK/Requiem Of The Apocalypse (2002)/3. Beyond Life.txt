[Music: N. Rudolfsson]
[Lyrics: N. Rudolfsson]

Thick haze in the light of lava fire 
The forces are gathered for a feast
Secrets in the green mist are revealed
Dark landscapes take form in the horizon
Flesh in lust below six eyes
Nocturnal sins hidden deep within

A conspiracy beyond life
In ecstasy it brings the dead alive
.The dead alive

Beyond life

Rites of magic potion in the blood
Venom of darkness in my veins
In chambers of the citadel of metal
Escape to forests of the dark
Tasting the breath from the pyre
Lust on black ground.

.The dead alive

Beyond life
