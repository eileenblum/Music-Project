[Music: N. Rudolfsson]
[Lyrics: N. Rudolfsson]

Three shadows on the sea of glass
Standing by the palace of dead trees
No thoughts of what the nocturnal will bring
And what the future of life will sing

Dawn of the lava aeon
The dark green purple season

Deep in the woods of memories
Where the beast ones lived and ruled
Forbidden temptation now prevails
A first step into the unknown.

Dawn of the lava aeon
The dark green purple season
