[Music: N. Rudolfsson]
[Lyrics: N. Rudolfsson]

Within the realms of darkness the thunder roars
Dark magick echoes in the temple halls
The witch of purple fire sings the tunes of doom
The wizard of the dead rose valley prays in the gloom

Together they summon the force of the mist
Within the surrounding cold dead forest

"Will it be a night when the chariots come again?
To bring the witch to Hades where the king of no life are waiting"

Inhaling the mist
Feel the supreme force of eternity
Laughter of sin
Walk on the clouds of winter darkness

Upon the thrones of the temple they chanting the words
That no tongues can speak and no ears hear
The mist is fading and there's no time to call it back
Watching the crystal ball where the catastrophes appear

Together they summon the force of lust
Within the temple of skin and sin

"Will it be a night when the chariots come again?
To bring the witch to Hades where the king of no life are waiting"

They cursed the numbered demons with wings.
To let the eyes on the black wall watch again

The chariots arrive again
