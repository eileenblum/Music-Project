Your cold eyes
In a world of lies
Freezing my steps
In the halls of the dead

Walking the path of the dying souls
Your eyes are lurking through the eternal dark
You can't capture my soul in your cage
You can't find the heart of darkness

Eyes of Kali
Your eyes are almost killing me
Eyes of Kali
But I am one with the dark

So your funeral will come first

Your dying eyes
In your world in nothingness
Freezing your own soul
In the halls of tragedy

Walking the path of your own death
Your king of apathy can't give you life
You have captured your own soul
You will never be one with the heart of darkness

Eyes of Kali
Your eyes will never kill me
Eyes of Kali
I am one with the dark
