Enchanted by the burning skies
We rise
Captured in the haze
Of the funeral pyre

Winter

We drink to death from endelss wells
A challenge for the ancient gods
Condemnation, a black celebration

Winter of the moribund

Embraced by darkness
We dance
A feast for the fallen
Raptured the chant of death 

Winter
