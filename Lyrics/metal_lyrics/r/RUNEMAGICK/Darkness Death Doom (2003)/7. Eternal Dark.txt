Unknown dark realms
Hidden beyond the gates
You are the chosen one
To enter the dark

The key to eternal dark power

Now you have the key
Grant it to the beast of fire
Worlds are burning down
While new ones arise
Inhale the haze of death

Spread your dark wings
Behold the caravan
Of corpses reborn
All the horizons are Burinn

The key to eternal dark power
