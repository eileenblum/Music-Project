Evil spirits crawling in the graves of the deathless
Lurking in the dark like venomous demons
With false whispers they devastate and desecrate
Their twisted minds are possessed by Doom

You're walking on the edge
Infiltrate the weak
Sucking their blood
Awaiting your next sacrifice

For what purpose do you live?
You are doomed

Whose veins are you cutting now?
Destroyer of minds, eater of souls
Seducing the sons of high fire
The false one you are, gambler of souls

Who are you to condemn
So scared what to find within your flesh
Sacrifice your own offspring
Unholy lust with the fallen angels

For what purpose do you live?
You are doomed
