Deep in the black star abyss
Where the citadel of doom rests
In the Green nebular halls of chaos
The Dragons of apocalypse dwell

Darken thy flesh
Sacrifice your soul

There's a gate within the citadel
It leads to the dark red crystal realm
A place for your sacrificed soul
To gather strength for the coming...
Cosmic funerals!

Darken thy Flesh
Sacrifice your soul
