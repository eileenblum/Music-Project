Like a snake from the underworld
Filled with venom you rise
Awaken by rituals unknown for man
Your secret past is hidden for all time

Your tongue licks me in temptation
Your teeth are shining black like death

The Venom
You are the venom

One day you will bite your own tail
One day you will die by our own venom
Your death will not be remembered by many
Your breath will not be forsaken by any - one

Your tongue licks me in temptation
Your teeth are shining black like death

The Venom
You are the venom
