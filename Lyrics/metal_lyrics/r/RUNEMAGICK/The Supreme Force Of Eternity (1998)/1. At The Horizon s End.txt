at the horizon's end
the dark edge of life
behold the abyss heart
flames tear my soul apart
...apart

the last step on earth
in darkness i will rebirth
travel thru time and space
beyond this human race
...race

a journey... in infinite spheres
on wings... of triumph
a journey... beyond the horison's end
departure... away from this... PAIN!

memories of twisted faces
morbid voices in a race
they fade away
as i travel away
...away

the last step on earth
in darkness i will prevail
a ruler of time and space
beyond this human race
...race

at the horizon's ned...
