what dwells in the ancient spell
the truth in the darkness beyond
signs carved in millennium stone
secret spawn of the shadow

oh, i can feel the power
curse of the dark rune

the past speaks thru the signs
whispering from the forgotten
the triumphant flame will rise
as the weak now die

oh, i can feel the power
curse of the dark rune

curse == let the wrath free
curse == the curse of the dark rune

curse == let the wrath free
curse == the curse of the dark rune
