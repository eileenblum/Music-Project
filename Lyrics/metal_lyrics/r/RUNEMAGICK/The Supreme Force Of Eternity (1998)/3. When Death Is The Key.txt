the time has come
it's time to leave
the call has come
it's time to depart

die...
when death is the key
i spread my wings

the voice within
it's time to follow
the call within
it's time to...

die...
when death is the key
i spread my wings

when death is the key
i open the gate
i spread my wings
and let my soul free

die...
when death is the key
i spread my wings
