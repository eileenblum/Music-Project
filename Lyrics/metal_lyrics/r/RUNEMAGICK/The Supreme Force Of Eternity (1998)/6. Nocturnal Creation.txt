nocturnal creation
a spawn of the night
rise from devastation
in a world without light

the sun is gone
last war is done
a monument will rise
up in the sky

of fire and death
the creation's breath
the dreams are spoken
the end is chosen

nacturnal creation
the vision of thy dreams

nocturnal creation
no life in sight
rise from the flames
the world of thy end

the sun is gone
last war is done
a monument will rise
up in the sky

of fire and death
the creation's breath
the dreams are spoken
the end is chosen

nocturnal creation
the vision of thy dreams

nocturnal creation
the black realm
of the mighty darkness
the supreme soul's domain
