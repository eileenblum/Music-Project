where is the ancient time
carved in our eternal sign

i can't look thru the black wall
i can't touch the world beyond

memories color the emptiness
but still the wall is black

i can't look thru the black wall
i can't touch the world beyond

where is the hungry flame
that once painted the future
...only an empty shell of me remains

where is the eternal path
that was meant for the future walk

i can't look thru the black wall
i can't touch the world beyond

the longing of the eternal fire
grows stronger and stronger
maybe one day the wall will fall
and the flames will be together
forever
