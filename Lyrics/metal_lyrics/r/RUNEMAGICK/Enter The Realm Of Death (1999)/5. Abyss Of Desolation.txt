Darkness falls
The abyss calls
The shadows realm appear
A black gate
A dark soul fate
Eternal Darkness
Black walls of frozen souls
Twisted bodies sourrounding me
Into the abyss, I fall
Into the abyss, of desolation
The path leads
To the realm
Where darkness is eternal
The gate is open
The fate is choosen
The candle of life fades
Abyss of dark desolation
Far beyond life depression
Fleshless souls domain of death
A realm with no space for breath
