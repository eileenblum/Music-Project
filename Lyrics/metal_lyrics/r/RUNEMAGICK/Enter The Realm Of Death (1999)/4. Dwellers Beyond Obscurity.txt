I am the force
We are the force
In the kingdom of the dead
Dwellers beyond obscurity
Here in the world of eternal death
I am my true self
Together with all darkborn souls
A gigantic creation of warriors
A land in eternal darkness
The black dimension of death
Pile of skulls and frozen corpses
This is the home of the darkborn souls
I am reborn
We are reborn
In the kingdom of the dead
Dwellers beyond obscurity
I am reborn
We are reborn
In the kingdom of the dead
Dwellers beyond obscurity
Warriors of darkness
Now are prepared for the final war
We will crush the lightworld
And let it burn for eternity
