He comes at night when the moon is worshipped
A living evil on golden wings
He comes to take you to the abandoned land
A land where darkness is ablazed
A leap in the dark, a step into the forgotten
Through the gates of betrayal breeze
I know the time has come for me
My soul is given to the shadows
He comes to bring your soul to where it belongs
He will give you the dark and black
A ghastly scream from an inhuman shape
And your body is layed to rest
A giant evil inside your soul
Will take you to the malicious paradise
I glorify my gloomy fate
As I reach the point of sins
I glorify the land of the dark
The place where I am one
I deny the faith of christ
'cause I have seen the truth
The truth is evil, dark and black
And the evil is for all of us
He comes to bring your soul to where it belongs
He will give you the dark and black
A ghastly scream from an inhuman shape
And your body is layed to rest
A giant evil inside your soul
Will take you to the malicious paradise
