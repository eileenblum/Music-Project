The flesh now decays
As my soul fly away
The gates of Hades is open
Final destination is choosen
Enter the realm of death
After the funeral
When the mourners walk away
I have my freedom
Leave this rotten life
Life now fades
My soul belongs to Hades
Into the darkest realm
The final journey
Enter the realm of death
After the funeral
When the mourners walk away
I have my freedom
Leave this rotten life
