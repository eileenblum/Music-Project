The battle has begun
Demonic forces is prevail
Hordes of the dead descends
Warriors of hades is unleashed
While angels defending their world
Burning they fall down
Warriors of the light
Will all die in our sight
Lightworld damnation
Torn apart fading away
Dismembered corpses left to rot
Guardians of the light
Drowns in their own blood
Their world is burning
Weak screams dissapear
The surpreme force has won
We raise our flag of death
Lightworld damnation
War - Lightworld damnation
War - The lightworlds
fucking damnation
