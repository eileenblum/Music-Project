The shadow falls
Feel the presence of death
The reaper calls
Feel your last breath
Dark necroshadows
Coming for you
Nocturnal claws
You are in the grip of death
The reaper jaws
Smeared in your blood
Dark necroshadows
Coming for you
Come to the shadows
Come to the reaper
Come to your death
Dark necroshadows
Coming for you
