Blazing eyes
Serpent of the dark skies
Towards the night
The endless noctural sea
Noctem servant
Shuns the septic light
Monolith of darkness
The calling dreamvoid
Dreamvoid serpent
Noctem serpent
It calls, it calls
Into the dreamvoid
Ancient scars
Bleeds the black blood warth
Dark void claws
Surrounds the solitude bath
The serpent eyes
Leads through the gates
The serpent skies
Is so dark and eternal
Dreamvoid serpent
Noctem servant
Follow the serpent
