The wings of night is spread
A lonley soul without rest
The dark thoughts lurks
The dark visions speaks
Longing for hades
Life goes on day by day
The hate is growing stronger
Life has no meaning
So why continue
Kiss the bullet
Kiss the world goodbye
Longin for hades
The reaper comes take you
Away from this world
The boring life is past
Enter Hades
Longing for hades
