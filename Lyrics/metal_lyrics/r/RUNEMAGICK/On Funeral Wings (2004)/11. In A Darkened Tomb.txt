In a darkened tomb
Blessed by the night
Shadows slowly move
In livid ritual light
Black mirrors reflecting
Shiny steel forged by death
The more I sacrifice
The more I feel it coming
Whips lick my flesh
Like wrath from the underworld fire
I'm burning in the eyes
Of the dark one, my desire
Slowly I descend
Like the doomsday rain
I vanish from this world
Pleasure and pain
