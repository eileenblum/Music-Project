Grey clouds turn black
The dying sun out of track
Galactic haze blinds my eyes
Lost in the desert where everything dies
Ocean demon whispers
It calls for my soul
Beyond the black ocean
A kingdom of the fivepointed star
Surrounded my mountains of doom
Thunder of death roars
Ocean demon whispers
It calls for my soul
