Beyond oblivion winds
Motionless I wait
That blood covers
Another broken wing

And I know I can't return
Where the light doesn't pierce
The blackness of the woods

And voiceless here I wait
As my hope starts to wither
for death to overtake my tears

Of a rusty blade
I no longer feel the pain
What else was there to give
What else was there to live
Still waiting silent
Still waiting cold
For death to overtake my tears
