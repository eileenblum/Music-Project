I see you murdering my faith
Contemplate the pain I die in

Beyond an elusive eternity
Of endless shines I ache
My own shadow
Lost in the mist...

Weakened by their voices
Far away my beautiful dram
The memory of my opened flesh...

I feel like forever drowned in my own blood
There's nothing that I know so well
Like my ache
I'll be swallowed by the cold by the shadows
I'll be swallowed by my ache

Whispers fill my soul
Those echoes of cries
Surround what's left of my mind
I'm banned from the nights
And all the candles tuned black...
