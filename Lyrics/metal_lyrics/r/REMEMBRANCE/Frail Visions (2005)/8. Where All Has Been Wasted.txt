Silent grew the pain
Only a sound of storm now echoes
A far escape from all glances
I'll hide...
Away from everything
Where all has been wasted

These painful nights I've painted red
To finally lose myself
To finally lose it all
Feel no the bitter taste down my throat
Everything's eternal when the curtains fall
