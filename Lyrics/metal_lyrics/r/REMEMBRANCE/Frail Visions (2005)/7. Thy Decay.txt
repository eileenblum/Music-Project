These empty oceans
Retired from an earth
They don't belong anymore

Trees are dying
Withering their last leaf
Following their fate
wishing they could belong
To something else than a stifling air

The skies are blackened
By the doom of their stars

Just unveil my eyes

A desperate lack of strength
Nothing but a reflection in a mirror
Within myself I'm dead
Nothing's left anymore
