A storm of gray ashes lashes my face
I watch the sky unreal and pale
I witness the dance of clouds
Until the tide breaks against the rock
Waking up the silence's reign

Where I stand, the skin of the earth
Rests now of sand and stone

When the waters turn our memories to stones
Where I dance is where we will die
The black ashes take me to a timeless sleep
In which I fall, like you will too
The springs melt in the beat
Obsidian walls of larva

Where I stand, we become rust
An empty shell, dying on the seaside
We are this desolated show
This absence of colour

My eyes are veiled by the dust, thick and heavy
Stone-faced gaze of the mountain
Watching me fight my way
Through the looming stones
And I run...

I run the disembodied woods, the ash coated landscapes
They are waiting to take me, but the gray mist will pretend that here,
I never was...
