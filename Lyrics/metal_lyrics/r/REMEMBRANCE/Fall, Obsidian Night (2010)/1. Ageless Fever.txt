An ageless pain that forever prevails
Growing on me
I am breaking stones against the seasons
Breaking stones against the days

In vain I scramble against
This loss of balance
This loss of balance that is ruining me
And makes me feel the path loses me

The river that saves became torrents of water

Deliverance became the lie
Deliverance became the lie
That my thoughts have to chase

The river that saves became torrents of water
Those leave me no choice but to surrender
