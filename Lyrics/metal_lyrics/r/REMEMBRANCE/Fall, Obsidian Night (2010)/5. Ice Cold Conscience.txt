Even though the wounds
I had been trusting all
Watching death
Worm (its way) into dreams
That the black veil bides

These shadows caressing my lesions
My ice-cold conscience
Is time's real nature

I have seen so much in their immense eyes
That are being drowned
By the night
I had been trusting all ha an end
