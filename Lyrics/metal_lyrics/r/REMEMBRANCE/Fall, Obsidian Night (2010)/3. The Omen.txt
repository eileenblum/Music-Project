Burning are the shores of time
And leave us broken

Another scent of death devours me

We carry the sorrows
With ashes in our hand
Like violent blades
Falling from the sky

The ancient falls
Where the moon used to meet
Death in now their mask

Years made us become ageless
Now in the sound of winds
We walk away

In the eventide
We are burnt form our scars
The shores of time are set ablaze
Are set ablaze...
