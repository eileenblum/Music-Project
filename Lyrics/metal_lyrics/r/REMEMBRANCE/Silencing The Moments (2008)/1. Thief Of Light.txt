See me as the endless hall
I am your thief of light
Your path hasn't make it through
Now lone and red
The curse of enlightenment
Hate me, with the strength of your apathy
I will never, never leave

You play for fools
Tortured by daylight pleasure
Beating your sickest thoughts
The dawn shall fade
I am the dissolutions, your disillusions

Dried, withered tears
Such a careless knife
Dried, withered tears
Such a careless knife

I am your thief of light
I grow like a dead tree
That time couldn't vanish
You howled cries for sleep

I am your thief of light
The curse of enlightenment
Hate me, with the strength of your apathy
Hate me, for I will never leave
