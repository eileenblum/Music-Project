I feel the words disappearing in the elegance
The lands I don't reckon not the stones I walked on
Shivers night and day... a restless kingdom
I fall in the mud of truth and I wish I wasn't the one to blame
Life, beyond sadness and broken stones
I breathe the infatuation of death

I see them wandering in misery
Floating on distant waters
I hear them breathing through the walls

Entrust me
All shall be yours
For one hop of ending this

Trapped in the clutches
Of my created dreams
Trapped in my failure
Trapped in the days I forced myself to keep

Take me with you
These endless shrieks won't leave me...
For one hope of ending this
Let me feel the dreary wounds
Your withered breath...
The lands I don't reckon
Not the stones that I walked on

I see them wandering in misery
Floating on distant waters
I hear them breathing through the walls

Take me with you
These endless shrieks won't leave me...
Take me with you
For one hope of ending this
Take me with you...
