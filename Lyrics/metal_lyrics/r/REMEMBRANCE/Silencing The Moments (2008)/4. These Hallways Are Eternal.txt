These hallways are eternal
I know my grief won't change a thing
With all my weakness I look at you
Waiting blindly for the white escapes
but these hallways are eternal
Everything is carved forever inside
The flesh came to light
To appease our despondent day
To take our pains away
I forgot who I was
I forgot who you are
These hallways are eternal
