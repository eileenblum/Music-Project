Sleep on before images
Scratch the surface
Before all falls apart
I am the reckless driver now
Facing the gust of wind
I am the reckless driver now
In a sliver slumber
In a blinding red light.... out of time
As a glance on distant shores
Until everything real dies

Sleep on.... sing for me
Calm me down
Sleep on... sing for me
While all souls silence
No light shall pierce the morning drape
My eyes forever closed
To keep these graceful notes inside
Praise the winds to carry them
Through the nights
Let me be out of time

Hide yourself from my eyes
Let my hands wipe the dust
To many lives have been here
Still it feels I'm the first

Before all falls apart
I am the reckless driver now
Facing the gust of wind
I am the reckless driver now
