Tears in stranger's eyes
Sickly march
Hatred in tortured faces
Silence, step after step
What will be left
Of this early morning

Let me be despondent
Let me be tired of this all

We all stand so still
Speechless in line
wait for the absence
We all stand so still
Speechless in line
Wait for the absence
To overtake all

Such a careless wanderer
You lead the way that I yearn to take

We all stand so still
Speechless in line
wait for the absence
We all stand so still
Speechless in line
Wait for the absence
To overtake all
