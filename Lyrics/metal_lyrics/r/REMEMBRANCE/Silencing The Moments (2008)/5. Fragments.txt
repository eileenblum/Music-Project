Wait for the black veil to fall down
Dissolution is getting closer now
A piercing light
An unreachable sight blinding my eyes
Warmed by hatred
Deprived from all
I breathe in fragments of life
Through fragments of death

I am nothing
Until it swallows me again
I am no one
Until I close my eyes
I am nothing
Until it covers me again

Wipe away all traces from me
Wipe away those bruises
Give me back the pride
I know I could feel you
I heard them laugh
Now only silence will remain

A piercing light blinding my eyes
I breathe in fragments of life

I am nothing
Until it swallows me again
I am no one
Until I close my eyes
I am nothing
Until it covers me again
