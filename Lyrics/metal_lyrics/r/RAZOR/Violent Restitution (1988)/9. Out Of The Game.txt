I should've kept my big mouth shut
I should've known my place
this always happens every time
I'm leaving in disgrace
my self-control is facing
my anger's on the rise
a temper tantrum on the lose
I'm hatred and despised

#: Out of the game: this time I'm really gone
out of the game: but I won't be for long

Patience is a virtue
at least that's what they say
but I don't have a time to waste
to try a different way
hatred is my weapon
violemce is my friend
and that's the way it's gonna be
until the very end (my friend) #

Out of the game: believe me when I say
out of the game: there'll be a price to pay
