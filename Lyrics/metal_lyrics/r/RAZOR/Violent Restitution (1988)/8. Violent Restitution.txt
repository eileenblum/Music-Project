Backstabbit turncoat
I caught you in the act
lowdown lying scumbag
I'm gonna break your back
you thought that you could pull it off
but I saw through your game
now my hands are on your throat
you've got yourself to blame
Violent restitution: you ain't seen nothing yet
violent restitution: I'm playing back the clebt

First I choke you 'til you puke
then I'll gouge your eyes
then it's time to break your spine
my promices aren't lies
and when you think it's over
and my debt in paid
I'll smash your face to pieces
with my trusty spade

Here I come
now you're dead
get your woman
in my bed
now I laugh
while you cry
it's been fun
but now you die... DIE!
