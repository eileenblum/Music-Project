Seried by stress hateful energy
blood is boiling, trying to break free
temper flames, destruction takes its place
killing power uncontrolled disgrace

Draining the strength from your tired soul
robbed of your life to relax
tightening vices taking their toll
inflicting these deadly attacks

Hot blood runs cold

Death sentence from the day you're burn
pressure curse, your skin is ripped and torn
veins bulge, your body's glowing red
hyperthension is leaving you for death

Nervous wreck, hell bent of self destruction
can't break apart this arterial obstruction
cardiac, rate of pulse increase
strained heart, you're soon to be deceased
