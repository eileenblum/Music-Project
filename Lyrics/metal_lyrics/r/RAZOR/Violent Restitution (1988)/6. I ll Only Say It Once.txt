I'll only say it once, don't ask me to repeat it
like I said before, I don't like you
just once you met me, and you don't wanna bet me
you'd better like what I'm about to do
so where'd you stach the money, no don't make me look
you want to live another day my friend
lay it on the line 'cause you know what's yours in mine
the word we chose to use that day was lend

You only live once, better run fast
I don't need excuses, I like it to last
you only live once, better run fast

I'll only say it once, that was my old lady
hey, don't let me see you talk or touch
I'm not too good with pity so be telling the whole city
be telling them that I'm too fucking much
cause there was another man that crossed the line just once
just ask, if only he could talk
his face has soft of changed this guy I rearranged
he ran now if only he could walk

I'll only say it once, this here is my bottle
just n case I need to drink
if you run out of wine, remember that it's mine
that should be enough to make you think
I've worked for what I own, nobody's gonna take it
so shake it off before you dare
I'll just like ice, I'll never say it twice
I'm just like the electric chair
