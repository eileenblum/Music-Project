Take out your whip and give me the pressure I crave
put on your leather and beat me until I behave
woman, you know that I love to be punished by you
how take off your clothes because know it's my turn to be cruel

Dominate, dominate
welts all over my chest
discipline, discipline
baby, your pain is the best

Inflict me with bruises and watch as I scream with delight
humiliate me, I last for your violence tonight
kiss me, then hit me, then tease me, then boss me around
my body is aching with lust so we'd better get down

Hurts good.

Back at your apartment you turn out your lights
light a few red candles, I'm gonna spend the night
you tie me to your bed with rope, you've got some heavy chains
I'm getting ready for some love that's painfully insane
my clothers are gone, the candle wax is dripping on my chest
your fingernails into my flesh, you put me to the test
I love the fire in your eyes, I wanna be your slave
tomorrow I'll be feeling all the pressure that you gave
