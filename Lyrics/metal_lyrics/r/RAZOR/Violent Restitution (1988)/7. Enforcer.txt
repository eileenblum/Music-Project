I'm outside every night
I prowl around with hate
revenge is mine, I will kill
enforce your bloody fate
I take my time, what's the rush
I've already won
waiting for a moment
damage will be done

Looking outside while you're sleeping
certain death is slowly creeping
this is real, you're not dreaming
no one hears your morbid screaming
Enforcer: force ya

God has called your number out
your dying lets me live
murder is my only thought
the gift that I must give
you've crossed my path too often
you thought that you had won
I've sentenced you to die in hell
the sentence has begun

Enforcer: your life means so little to me
enforcer: I'll waste you and then I'll be free
enforcer: regretting that we ever met
enforcer: you struggle but you're last the bet
