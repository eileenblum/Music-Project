The feel of blade in my hand
Violence! Violence!
the power to kill many men
picking my victims and taking revenge
the voices are inside my head
slicing your jugular, skaling your strength
won't let up, until you are dead

Save your life, hide your wife form my knife
stand and fight for it
blood to spill, before I kill, test your will
stand and fight for it

Whaaaaaaaaaa!
Possessed by the feeling that's strange
Murder! Murder!
I've gone through a psychotic change
I used to be normal, I used to feel love
but now all I feel is remorse
a victim of lower society
now nature has taken its course
all my friends were beaten to death
so now I've gotta even the score
killing everything I can find
then I'm gonna kill some more
I know there's a price on my head
they'll hand me for the things that I do
the edge of my razor is sharp
and now I'm gonna use it to you

Whaaaaaaaaaa!
I'm gonna spread the pain again
Torture! Torture!
Killing's the best thing I've found
