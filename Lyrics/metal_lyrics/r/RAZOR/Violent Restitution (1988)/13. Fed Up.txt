Hang your head in shame
don't wanna hear your name
say sorry than you do it all again
your expressions tells the tale
self-sympathy prevails
an asshole I could never call a friend

Fed up with your attitude and fed up with your style
fed up with your butthead friends and hat your smart-ass smile
fed up with the goofs I see all throughout downtown Guelph
fed up with small city life, it makes me wanna Ralph

I say things in anger
you take 'em all to heart
you've got no fucking brains
you've got too fuckin' smart
you're just a little suck
so now go home and cry
to mommy and to daddy
'cause you've got no spine

Let me outta here today
no longer wanna live this way
gotta leave, I'm getting ill
can't take much more, I'm gonna kill
stupid city, like a jail
fans of thrash will post my bail
gotta hit the road and rage
let me out, unlock this cage
had enough, had enough
enough to make me sick
had enough, had enough
of people who are sick
