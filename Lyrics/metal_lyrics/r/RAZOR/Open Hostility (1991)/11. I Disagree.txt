You know what my problem is
'cause you know everything
You say that we play too fast,
you say that I can't sing
Tell the world your expert lies
The speedfreaks know you're blind
I don't play for critics,
I don't care what's on your mind
I disagree
Sound the death knell for the bands
if they don't like your face
If they hurt your feelings
you proclaim them a disgrace
Weasels have no business
interfering with our taste
Tell the truth in your reviews,
I've got no time to waste
If a critic doesn't like the music that you play
Forget about his point of view, don't matter anyway
If they feel offended just because I wrote this song
Then you'll see some bad reviews,
but now you know they're wrong
We disagree
