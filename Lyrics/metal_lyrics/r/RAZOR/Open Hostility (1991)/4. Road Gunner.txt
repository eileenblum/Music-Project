Rising power, feel the speed as I shift into high gear
All alone, I own the road, I know your gates are near
Hellsent, whipped with fury. death certificate I signed
None survive my speed machine, I'm out to kill mankind
Road Gunner, your fate
Road Gunner at your gate
You backstab me and think you'll get off free
Road Gunner, too late
Lock your doors, bolt down the bars, here comes my death machine
Cloud of hate hangs overhead, it always follows me
Wicked swiftness, speed wind raider, I will hypnotize
There's no quicker way to kill than right between the eyes
High balling speed, like lightning
See the chrome shine, roaring wheels
Burning up the highway
My speed demon made of steel
Road Gunner, say bye
Road Gunner, you die
Fuck with me and it's your destiny
Road Gunner, no lie
