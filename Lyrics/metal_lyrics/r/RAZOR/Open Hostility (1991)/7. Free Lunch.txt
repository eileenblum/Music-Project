You piss me off, you drive me nuts
You drink my beer and you always smoke my butts
You owe me money, you owe me big
You washed up nothing, you slob, you pig
Don't say you know me. don't say we've met
You squirmy worm. why don't you pay beck all your debts?
You're always sorry, but then you're back
Bleed me dry until I die, I'II have a heart attack
They warned me, but I never heard
You always take advantage of me
I told you to settle the score
But you think your lunches are free
You used to work to earn your keep
But you always called in sick
and now you spend the day asleep
I'm not your mom, I'm not your dad
I'm not a genius but I know when I've been had
I want my cash and you expunge
My money is the water and you wanna be the sponge
You never change, but then again
You've always been a loser but you're also my best friend
