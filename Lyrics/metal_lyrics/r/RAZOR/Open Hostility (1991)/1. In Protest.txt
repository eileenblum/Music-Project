I deliver images of stark reality
Reflections of the human race and our hypocrisy
questioning the reasons why our video was banned
Severed from the airwaves in our home and native land
Censored
Mention sex or violence and the censors get concerned
Insulting our intelligence. I guess we haven't learned
Why do goofs with hang-ups have control of what we think
This so-called free society's a ship about to sink
Look and then you'll see
Decisions being made for you and me
That's why we're here. because we care
We tell it like it is and we aren't going anywhere
Don't let us down if you're the same
Get your point of view across and beat them at their game
We've got to fight to stay alive
Exposing all the hypocrites until they can't survive
I've heard empty promises from those I used to trust
So called friends who lie to you because they feel they must
Tell you whet you wanna hear then take you for a ride
It's not my job to seam and rob your wallets with a lie
In protest raise your voices 'cause it's time to take a stand
Challenge their authority. we'll take the upper hand
