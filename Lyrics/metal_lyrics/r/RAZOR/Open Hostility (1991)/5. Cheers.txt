Hey, I'm on a high roll I like to party hard
Don't dig no flakes in flashy clothes
Who think they're fucking stars
I've got myself to live my life
It's all I really need
I've worked this hard for what I am
If you don't like it you can leave
Cheers: you only live one life
Cheers: if you're gonna party, do it right
Cheers: nobody's gonna change my mind
You think it's rude, this attitude
You must be fucking blind
'They'll never last", well here we are
We'll thump right to the end
Some have stayed and some believe
This drink's for you my friend
But most of them, they cut us down
And sat we've got no class
We might be wrong, we might be right
So blow and kiss my ass!
Cheers to my friends
