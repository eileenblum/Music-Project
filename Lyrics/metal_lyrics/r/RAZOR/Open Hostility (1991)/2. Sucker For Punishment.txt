I fight the system 'cause I'm offended
Know what it means to be a pawn
Manipulated beyond all reason
You can't decide what's right or wrong
Absorb the pressure. avoid the pain
See the factory. it's just a prison
Life sentence just so you can eat
You're just a number, they'll sacrifice you
Replace you with a new machine
You think they're loyal. you think they care
You think you'll never lose your job
You're just a sucker, if you don't wake up
One day you'll find out that you're gone
What are we doing. creating a system
Resulting in meaningless lives?
Instead of improving. we're always abusing
Too selfish to ever be wise
Busting our butts in a rush to get nowhere
Just look what we're leaving behind
A trail of destruction, self-centred obstruction
It's time to start using our minds
Fight the system. lose the pain
Lacking in courage. afraid of the future
Pretending that everything's fine
How will it feel when you're forty years old
And you're dumped from the factory line
Plan your escape 'cause it's certain to happen
The day when you're through is at hand
Sucker for punishment, here is your warning
Be ready before you get canned
Fight the system. lose the poin
Feel the pressure, this life's insane
