Forces beyond your control
expose you to hazardous waste
Arson, the deviants play,
igniting the lead that you taste
Acid, the rain starts to fall,
smokescreen develops above
Nature, the balance destroyed,
killing the life that you love
Legions protest in the streets
The people aren't willing to die
Riots, the masses are angry
Exposing the corporate lie (again)
Fighting the ignorant scum,
they do anything that they please
Fatcats, they don't have the time
to help us prevent this disease
Violence grows with the problem,
an issue the big shots ignore
Anger, the people revolt,
the legions will even the score
Terrorism by another name, the end result's the same
Nobody wants to drink the acid rain, no way!
