You venture out to walk the streets
That no one else would dare
A blackened night, a faster pace
Running 'cause you're scared
A beating heart, a shortened breath
Won't see another day
You've had a taste, your first, your last
Your life's blood drains away
Cry Out, they'll never hear your screams
A DEATH, beyond your wildest dreams
Cold fear, you'll never break away
It's time, you and your kind will pay
He watches you with deadly eyes
To freeze you where you stand
Gripping terror, unholy threat
Bloodbath on command
Unseen shadow, silent now
Waiting for the kill
Caress your flesh with blade of steel
Desire for blood fulfilled
Hunts you down like easy prey
You'll never see the light of day
NIGHT ATTACK left in disgrace
NIGHT ATTACK begins the chase
Plots your death with deviation
Blood flow brings on strange sensation
NIGHT ATTACK you're paranoid
NIGHT ATTACK you're null and void
Controls your right to live or die
Barbaric torture, reason why
NIGHT ATTACK hangs on a thread
NIGHT ATTACK leaves you for dead
Fills your mind with disillusion
Silence starts the mass confusion
NIGHT ATTACK, he has the power
NIGHT ATTACK, your flesh devoured
