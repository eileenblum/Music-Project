Delusions of grandeur, rebels cast aside
Volcanic reverberations, power won't subside
Substantial influxations, from sources not unknown
Screams for blood and violence, your circuits overblown
Aggressive motivations, control your willing mind
You've come here for a reason, a reason you will find
Persuasive inhibitions, project your thoughts and dreams
You love the noise pollution, the sweat, the blood, the screams
Malicious Intent: You twist and you turn
Malicious Intent: Your body heat burns
Malicious Intent: On bashing your head
Malicious Intent: We will raise the dead
Afflicted population creates this atmosphere
Die hard youths in anger, create a sense of fear
Society protesting, goes against the grain
Lack of understanding, prevention all in vain
Underground united, growing like a storm
Feel the tension rising, thrusting past the norm
Bound by power metal, others do not see
Thrashing takes us higher, sets our spirits free
