Power and mayhem, the onslaught begins
Fist rises up to the sound
We tear up the stage with our violence and speed
And bring the Iron Hammer down
Deadly distortion caves in your head
Frantic behavior begins
We gather together to shed blood and sweat
Wretches indulging in sins
Destroy all who don't believe
This high speed metal we conceive
The metal is blasting, the underground meets
Your parents don't care where you are
The critics all laugh and call us the worst
But heaviness brought us this far
These bastards must burn for the trouble they cause
Revenge must be sweet in our eyes
A swing of the axe, we won't turn our backs
'til every last one of them dies
