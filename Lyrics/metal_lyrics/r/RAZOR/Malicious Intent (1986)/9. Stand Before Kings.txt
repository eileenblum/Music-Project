Were in the slaughter drinking water
Rulers drinking wine
They stab the beast, a selfish feast
Set glare the crystal eye
Kings and Queens with witty dreams
Collect from lower class
The knight and lance, the joker dance
Stand high to save their ass
Born were we fool's company
Night hawk spreads its wings
Deserters and the beggar man
Stand before the kings
Crawl in the cave and push your way
Do it if you dare
It's damp and cold, it's evening stone
It's smoke filled misty air
In the arena, kicking hyhena
Hear the strangling roar
Shock cracks down on wind blown ground
Dusts off the bloody whore
Off with your head is what's been said
King's fist of feather shakes
It's luxury off you and me
King's fist of feather takes
