Well I'm unchained, got the hiss of a rattlesnake
Point the finger, then you incriminate
A lawbreaker on an outbreak rampage
Half witted, half assed, half baked in a rage
An eye for an eye, you are paralyzed
Break neck speed, tougher than you realized
Roam the streets, double dealer born wild
Piss away all you got, lethal juvenile
Cage the Ragers: once assassins brutalized
Place your wagers: one touch and you're paralyzed
An outrager: listen, too fast to chase
Blackguard, what's the charge, throw me into hell
Foaming at the mouth, ragers fill the cell
Clear to me. to you it's rather frightening
My scene, my crowd, skin has started tightening
Underwear is everywhere, anywhere we go
Reckless jailbait, a proud lot at the show
Grab her at the ears and then some, whad'ya catch?
Ragers let'em in if they're up to scratch
