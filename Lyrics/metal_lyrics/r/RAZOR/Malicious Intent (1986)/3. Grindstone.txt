Lived a life of grief and sorrow
Striving for the best
The only cause they criticized
Supporting all the rest
Pounding pavement, pounding steel
Shredding all to break
The grindstone shatters all beliefs
Our lives and pride at stake
There's got to be some give and take
We'll take from you until
We carve our way through better times
The grindstone, out to kill
Acceptance from the underground
Enough to get us by
Metal minds will stand and count
They're never satisfied
Thrashing through their ignorance
Thrashing all in fun
The plans are never altered
Our job is never done
