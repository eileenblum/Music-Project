We've built up our courage
We won't be discouraged to fight
We struggle for power
Our armies devour the night
They've tried to withstand
But we'll gain command in the end
A crumbling nation
With mass devastation still stands
We strive for the right of our nation's demise
They've tricked and abused us and quoted us lies
Nothing will stop us or get in our way
'til Rebel Onslaught rules again
The hunters are hunted
Our foes are confronted at will
We make our progression
With headstrong obsession to kill
They fed us confusion
Provoked disillusion no more
With devilish crimes
They've rotted our minds to the core
Put forth penetration
Caused extermination and pain
Thoughts of desire
Take all of us higher again
Our rivals conceited
We won't be defeated 'til death
Although we are shaken
Won't give 'til we've taken last breath
