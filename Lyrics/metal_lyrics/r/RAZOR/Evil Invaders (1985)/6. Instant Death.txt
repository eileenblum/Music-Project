They told us it would never be
And man kind's race would live free
Free of pain and free of war
And now the sun will shine no more
Deep deception covered with lies
Mass pollutants filling the skies
Minorities' warnings forgotten by all
Truth comes too soon and majorities fall
Living hell, unchained fire, destruction and decay
Burning eyes, burning flesh, prophets in dismay
See them cry, watch them die, in no unending fame
Instant death claims their lives, progression is to blame
Technology the attribute
To futuristic solitude
To flood our mass with unknown gas
And hope the outcome would surpass
Widespread chaos gets out of hand
Law and order crushed on demand
Suicidal tendencies an easy way out
Death through starvation, frustration and drought
All these years till they found out
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
And know the final holocaust
The lives of millions are all lost
Deadly mist brings condemnation
Choking air reaps degradation
A final breath, you're breathing dust
Your death unfair, your life unjust
