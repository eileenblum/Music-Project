You made the trip to catch the band
We better do the best we can
We're glad you came to trash and see
Our raw attack of pure energy
Iron Hammer, in your face
Wall of metal shakes the place
Total volume, full scale attack
Once you're here ain't going back
Now the power's in your hands
A message for all metal fans
I know this sounds a little cliche
But I don't give a damn anyway!
So let this be a lesson to you
Though we leave we're never through
If you help to keep metal alive
The underground will always survive
I pledge: to keep it alive
I promise: metal will thrive
I swear: myself to the cause
I'll teach: all the metal laws
