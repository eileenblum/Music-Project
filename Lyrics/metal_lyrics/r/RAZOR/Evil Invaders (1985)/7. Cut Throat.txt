Damage done, aggressor convicted
Abandoned, abolished for shame
Quest for duty and crucifixion
Sharpens the wretched blame
Painstaking, spiritual making
Head strong, ceaseless stare
Aroused by vulgar carcass
Diseased from iron ware
Cast iron imprisonment, trash in agony
Outcasts are butchered, and seized in slavery
Cut throat
Panic stricken, scorched and marked
Barbaric disaster is near
Disease and degradation
Misfortune after fear
Piston strength, the archway is worshipped
The tempest disciples repent
The wreckage is salvaged and souls recovered
The followed, disposed and resent
