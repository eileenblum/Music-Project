At the gate the thrashers wait, with flesh of hardened steel
At the show the bitches go to such their nasty meal
Pounding meat, scorching heat, lick the dragon's bite
Eat your tail, with tooth and nail, their juices flowing right
Nocturnal curves, seduce and serve, spread the grease and feast
We thrust in time, a filthy crime for craving lucid beasts
Innocence has disappeared, the judgement: bad is bad
We're all damn good criminals from the good times that we've had
Masters of the armory, the attitude will show
Long live the underground, your last chance: here it goes
Trashdance (Into her pants)
From dawn's light, making spite, for thrills 'til early hours
Turn 'em back, infected crack, their skin is caught and sour
Trashdance into her pants, her oyster stings you all
All aroused her stench is doused, she's up against the wall
Pain and pealed with staining steel, take it, feel it grind
Piercing hearse, sends the curse, the trashing metal way
We spit on those who choose to pose, we trash with all the rest
Busting heads, ignoring feds, we know this crowd's the best!
