It was a stormy night... while the city's asleep
I was down to my last cigarette
And the holes in my shoes let the rain soakin' in
It's a night that I'll never forget
The flickering street light, the cold in my breath
Intensity ripped in the air
The sound of a gun as I watched a man run
Into blackness he then disappeared
Violence
Gun control
My heart skipped a beat as I ran 'cross the street
To the house, the lights on inside
As I stood at the door, he was there on the floor
With a bullet between the eyes
They zipped up the bag and they wheeled him outside
As I watched the lights fade away
And the holes in my shoes, still the rain soakin' in
I can't walk away...
I can't walk away...
