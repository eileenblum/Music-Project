Forget the bullshit, turn up the tunes, we don't care for what's wrong or right
Don't be a stooge 'cause we're not in the mood and we're ready to kick ass tonight
Don't be an ass, just raise up your glass, carving the only command
Smashing the load until we explode and we don't need to hear from you man...
'cause we don't give a damn
Forget the bullshit, turn up the juice, be ready to kick ass tonight
Making the laws, we'll fight for the cause and we don't care if it takes all night
Don't be a clown, pass it around, no bogarts the only demand
Dish out the sound, onward hell bound, and we don't need to hear from you man
'cause we don't give a damn
Forget the bullshit, crank up the tunes, we're gonna raise hellfire tonight
Power and speed is all that we need, blasting at ten is our right
Don't mess around, never go down, we give all we've got for the band
Live for the fun, we get the job done, then we fire up the engines and...
Do it all over again
