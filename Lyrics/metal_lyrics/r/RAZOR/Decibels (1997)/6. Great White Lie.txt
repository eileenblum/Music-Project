You think you'll make it but you're wasting your time
You'd sell your sister just to have that last line
You've got to have it you don't care what you pay
Your body's dying but you like it this way
You feel the rush and now the high takes control
Your heart is pumping and you're needing some more
You just keep trying but you can't reach the sky
You've fallen victim to the great white lie
You pave a highway full of ups and many downs
Can't find the fast lane, you just circle all around
Your wheels are spinning, find the rush to live again
Your life line candle is just burning at both ends
When will you realize? when will you see?
The poison in your blood was never meant to be
You stick the needle, whip the blow, you're dying hard
So fuck the world, yeah fuck 'em all, right up your arm
You need the speed
Great white lie
I've seen no lesson learned so here we go again
Can't buy utopia so you just buy your friends
You masquerade behind a face that plays the game
It's your addiction who's the one that digs your grave
