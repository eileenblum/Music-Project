The smith and wesson tried to tell him "put me down"
His mind was just as loaded, wired up for sound
His heart was torn away, and burning deep inside
He knew just what he'd do when he found that guy
Love led to violence as he busted down the door
There was his woman, fucking on the floor
In blinding madness he was struck with raging pain
A round of bullets now the walls bleed a stain
Wife vengeance
Life sentence
His life was flashing, soon the gavel's coming down
His plea, insanity, but they ruled his mind was sound
His soul was cold and blackened, channelled through his eyes
He can't forget, the killing's tangled in his mind
All rise, this court's in session, judgement day is here
Cold sweat just pouring, now he's facing his worst fear
White knuckle fisted like a knife through the heart
We find the defendant guilty as charged
