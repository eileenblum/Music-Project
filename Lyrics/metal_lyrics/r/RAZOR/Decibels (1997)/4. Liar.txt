You think I don't see you standing there
You think I don't hear you, I don't care
You think you are my friend, that's not the case
'cause nothing bugs me more, than your face
Liar: a turncoat, a welcher, a thief
Liar: you're gutless and empty in between
Liar: no backbone, no trust 'cause you breach
Liar: revenge as I smash in your teeth
You think I've got the time, talk to you
You think I give a shit what you do
You think that I don't mind sharing my space
But nothing bugs me more, than your face
You think that you can hang out with the band
You think you'll squeeze right in, can't be a fan
You think you are my friend, that's not the case
'cause nothing bugs me more, than your face
