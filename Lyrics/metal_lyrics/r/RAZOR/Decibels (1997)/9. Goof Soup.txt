You had your say, it's time to play my way
You waste my time, I'll speak 'cause it's my dime
Don't care no more, out cold lying on the floor
My choice, my rules, no time for dancing fools
Taking my chances, I've paid for mistakes that I've made
Fight for the striker, I pay back the piper in spades
Surviving the slaughters, it's taking its toll
Target on side as we break down the wall
Savour the smile on my face as I blow it away
Revenge is sweet, served quick makes a very nice treat
Just add one goof, beat well so there is no proof
Kick hard, kick fast, love the moment, make it last
No guilt, be strong, sick of hearing the same old song
Goof soup tastes good, hits the spot like you knew it would
You'll like, you'll see, good source of vitamin v's
Goof soup tastes great, have seconds, fill up your plate
Goof soup tastes fine, kills the hunger every time
