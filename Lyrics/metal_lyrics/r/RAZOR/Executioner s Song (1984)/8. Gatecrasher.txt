The power rips through the night
Energy you just can't fight
No escape from the fire
Tension mounts and takes you higher
Thousand there at the hour
Band plays on and grasps the power
Clench your fist and start to shake
How much onslaught can you take?
You're a GATECRASHER, sweat beads on your head
GATECRASHER, blood is what you shed
GATECRASHER, lash society
GATECRASHER, it's what you want to be
The speed builts intensity
The metal has complexity
The feel of leather, clang of chain
Ears are bleeding from the pain
The grind shatters time and space
A glow around a broken face
Enslaves your mind and very soul
Seems so bold and yet so cold
The lights they set the stage ablaze
You're left there in a metal daze
From the sound, shrapnel flies
The music never seems to die
GATECRASHER!
