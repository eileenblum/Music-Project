Deep within these ruins is a city full of life
A growing force surpassing all the poverty and strife
An underground militia taking orders from but one
The right to choose who lives or dies 'til senseless victories won
The deadly prowlers are active through the night
To seek their vengeance on others who will fight
Can't see past the fact that they're fighting for their lives
The enemies seek liberation from something deep inside
City of damnation: aggression rules their lives
City of damnation: beckons them to die
City of damnation: on a killing spree
City of damnation: fighting endlessly
They cannot lose the power of a never ending cause
They reach with fear at better things ignoring all the laws
The street becomes a jungle and death attains respect
The bloody anger takes control and minds it does infect
Unending struggle complicates with sheer determination
Killing friend, killing foe, fulfilled extermination
They guard against the enemy to save the territory
A battle which results in death and takes away the glory
Trapped in streets of debris, they're masters at their trade
The fury and the violence will never cease or fade
Alongside all their rivals, dead bodies prove their loss
They're really only rebels both fighting for one cause
