The Sons of Mayhem waiting
Time to start the fire
Volume overwhelming
Can't go any higher
Like a thunderhead above you
The storm is on it's way
With RAZOR 's edge we maim you
because we love to play
Time bomb explodes, time bomb blows
Time bomb expires, time bomb's on fire
Our amps are loud, no turning down
Metal in force, it takes it's course
Welcome to the slaughter,
I hope you're having fun
Living for the evening
We never see the sun
The party's getting started
The music's getting hot
Forget the non-believers
Work with what you've got
Chains, spikes, volume!
Time bomb takes it's toll
Speed, power, leather!
Metal rock 'n' roll
If you like it
Stand up for your rights!
Hold your fists up!
Heads will bang tonight!
