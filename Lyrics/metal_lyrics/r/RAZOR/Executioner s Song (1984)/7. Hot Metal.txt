Metallic mayhem on the loose
Molten rock provides the juice
Rampant start, you just can't hold
Burning heat lost all control
Everywhere you just can't hide
Spreading out it's nationwide
Metal lets you live today
Bands like us, we lead the way
Hot metal, turning you around
Hot metal, burning you down
Hot metal, gets in your brain
I'm feeling pain, from hot metal
Maximum volume soon abtained
Rivet heads now unchained
Studs and leather overflow
Aim to please at the show
Infesting cities one by one
Clenching fists, damage done
Always keeping up the pace
Love to see your violent face
