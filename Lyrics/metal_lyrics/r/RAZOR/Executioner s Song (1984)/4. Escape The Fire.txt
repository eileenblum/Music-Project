The mighty clash, no time for fear
All civil rights are lost
Death to all the innocent
The unborn are the cost
Trampling through the human waste
As hopeless as it seems
A driving force, an inner flame
Compels to me my dreams
Try to cut loose, try to break free
I just can't climb any higher
They're closing in, for the kill
Escape the fire
Crushing down the multitudes
The depths of hell ascend
Mist upon a moonlit sky
Fades to oblivion
Wretvhed captors force their way
On those who will not fight
Bloodstained vengeance rules their mind
The fire's burning bright
Obsessed with total anarchy
The battle rages on
Regimes shall fall to the ground
We must prove them wrong
Destruction levels city streets
Product of desire
I realize my fate is death
I can't escape the fire
