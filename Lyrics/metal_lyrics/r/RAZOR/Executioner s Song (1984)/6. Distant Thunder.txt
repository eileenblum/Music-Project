Earthshaking sound, how far away?
It's hard to tell, but I hope it doesn't stay
Potential danger, awaits us all
Before it's over, how many more will fall?
Can we escape the distant thunder
Or will we ever get away?
Defend against the ruthless hunters
Or stay and rot in death's decay
The rebel's call is seldom heard
Untimeless efforts and no one says a word
The battlecry, fierce mechanism
It just goes on amongst their indecision
