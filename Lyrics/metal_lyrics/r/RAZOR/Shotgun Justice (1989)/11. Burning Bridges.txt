Downtown Toronto a Saturday night
I'm looking to party 'til dawn
Just quit my job 'cause I can't take that bullshit
I never look back once I'm gone
I fought for my freedom, I'm nobody's slave
I'm just gonna answer to me
If that doesn't suit you then outta my way
'Cause a goof doesn't want to be free
They warned me to never burn bridges behind me
They told me that I was a fool
I told them if living means working forever
Then life is the stupidest rule
Wake up at seven, you're working at nine
What sadist invented this scheme,
Five out of seven each week of your life
'Cause you're working as part of a team
Your boss is an asshole controlling your life
Your paycheck your only concern
What a disaster you're wasting your life
Retiring once you've been burned
I know, you need money in order to live well
But why should you work 'til you're dead?
Burn up the bridges and find a way out
That's the smartest thing I've ever said
