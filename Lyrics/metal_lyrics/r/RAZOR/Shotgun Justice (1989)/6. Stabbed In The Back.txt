The metal scene has gone to piss
Boneheads lead the way
Playing fast because It's in
And then they go away
Instead of kicking major butt
They start to slow it down
Bringing back the 70's
I hate these fucking clowns
You sold us out without a doubt
You changed your future plans
You played the game, you've got your fame
And your phony fans
The pinhead movement loves their songs
These bands can do no wrong
And then they come to me and say
Why can't you write good songs?
I hate to be so arrogant
Don't like to call them names
But money is their only goal
My songs remain me some
All the bands I used to like are going down the drain
What the hell has happened here, have they gone insane?
I used to think that heavy bands ignored the current trends
But once you've been in rolling stone you learn about your friends
They never sound the some again, they claim that they progress
But I just think it's writer's slump that wins them their success
The majors spend big money the audience is blind
While RAZOR plays it heavier and leaves the scum behind
We've all been stabbed in the back
