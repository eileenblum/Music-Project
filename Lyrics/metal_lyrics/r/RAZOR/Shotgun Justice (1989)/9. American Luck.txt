Started out with nothing except the urge to play
Just me and my big ego gonna make it big one day
I never had the money. I didn't have a car
I had to bust my ass at work to save for my guitars
Born a Canadian
Didn't come from the USA
The odds are all against me. nobody will defend me
From bogus bands with cash who just can't play
American luck
Too bad we're Canucks
People think I'm famous but the thought is just absurd
I've made a lot of albums but I don't think that you've heard
If I was American I guess I'd be a star
A victim of the Great White North, completely battlescarred
I've never been a big shot but the fact is that I've tried
We've seen our name in lights but we're never satisfied
Don't live a life of luxury but hold on to your hopes
Each time you buy my albums I can buy a pack of smokes
