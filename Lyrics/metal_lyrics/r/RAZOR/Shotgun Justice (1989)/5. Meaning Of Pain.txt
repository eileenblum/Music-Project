I wake in fear, what I thought was a dream
I thought it could't be true That's not my bed, these are not my clothes
And this ain't my room
My arms are shackled and my legs are asleep
Why am I tied to these chains?
Who is responsible and where do they live?
And what are their names?
Step in, into their world
Where problems and peace are the same
Step in, but tell me no lies
My mind is too fucked from their games
Deed to the world, I lay in seclusion
A fission of freedom or fear?
Reach out and weigh in the evil
I feel that the wicked are near
They pump my veins and they've withered my brain
And ask me 'how do you feel'
Break out and over the walls
This time there won't be no deals
Step in, into their world
They're trying to drive me insane
Step in, but they won't succeed
My adrenalin's pumping again
I'm feeling wicked and I'm tracking you down
Brother, I'm coming for you
You had your day now the night she is mine
You can't stop what I'm gonna do
Won't see me coming but you'll know I am there
Your soul will be shaking with fear
Don't see you laughing, now the tables have turned
This message is so fucking clear
Step in, into their world
They were sucking the blood from my veins
Step in, into their world
I was lying there dying in vain
Step in, into my crypt
Where my life was taken away
Step in, into my world
And I'll show you the meaning or pain
