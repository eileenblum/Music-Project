With brutal hatred, I take control
The sound of devastation raw
Don't interrupt me, don't irritate me
Or I will break your fucking jaw
I'm too impatient, I'm volatile
I'm getting ready to Ignite
I carry weapons, I'm always ready
I never back out from a fight
Knock down drag out
Dealing out the decibels and pain
Electric Torture melts you
Electric Torture decimates your brain
I hold my grudges, I don't forget
Uprising chaos on my mind
I tried forgiveness, I tried condolence
But now I've left those thoughts behind
Now I try anger, Now I try strength
Now I try anything that's wrong
I'm a survivor, I never give up
That's why I wrote this violent song
Fight for pleasure, fight for fun
Fight for freedom of the press and always carry a gun
Be impatient and be real rude
Don't listen to your parents, they're a couple of prudes
Be sarcastic and be a Jerk
Quit your job and tell your boss what he can do with his work
Live your own life, you get one chance
It's time to take control and never give a second glance
Be a danger, be a threat
Intimidate! Retribute! Collect on your debts
Be a menace and then be glad
Or on your dying day you're gonna wish that you had
Want for nothing, just take it all
Your life is just a waste If you don't answer the call
One more lesson that you should learn
Don't show respect to anyone when it isn't earned
