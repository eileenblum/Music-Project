I tell you that I'm brilliant, 'cause I know more than you
I tell you I'm not arrogant, because I know it's true
I tell you I'm a sadist, because I love to kill
I tell you I'm an asshole but I've got an iron will
I tell you I'm a genius, and I control your life
I tell you you're not listening and stab you with my knife
I tell You you're a dying man, I tell you that you're dead
I tell you I'm a liar, don't believe a word I said
Accidental damage when I was just a tyke
Head injury I suffered when I wiped out on my bike
Concussion changed my attitude and now I live to hate
Demented and disturbed, I try to tree me from my fate
I tell you I'm a preacher, and I will save your soul
A born again evangelist, I've got a TV show
I tell you 'send your money': redemption will be yours
I say you haven't sent enough, you'd better send some more
I've made a giant fortune by conning all these fools
The bible belters send the cash 'cause they believe my rules
No sympathy for morons, they really want to pay
I told them I'm a liar but they listened anyway
Evangelists and murderers are ruthless
They seem different but they're really the same
In different ways they prey on all the weaklings
In different ways they think it's just a game
Swaggert told the world that he was sorry
Bakker asked us all to forgive
knuckleheads still send in their money
Cause it's the only way they know how to live
