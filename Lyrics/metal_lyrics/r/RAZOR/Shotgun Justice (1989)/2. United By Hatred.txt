Energy, you're hit by the train
A casualty of the social war
Artillery, the weapons I sling
Send you crashing and bleeding on the floor
Arteries, implode under skin
I'm filling all the weaklings full of lead
Anarchy all the war mongers free
United by our total hatred
Try with all your might, we never can be bound
Synchronize your beating, with our hateful sound
On your wounded knees we deny you all your rights
One more neck to squeeze we put you in the vice
Congregate, the loyal stand strong
A hatred that defies all written laws
Incriminate, accusations cast out
We sentence you to die by the saw
Abominate, our powerless foe
We are the black cloud over your head
Annihilate, with unstoppable force
United by our social hatred

Society our enemy, the rules which we must fight
The only way to bring out change is challenging their might
We will not lose this crucial clash and we will never give
Instead we hate don't hesitate, don't let the bastards live
Die hard, the attitude lives
The attitude will breed among the strong
Destroy, all attempts by the law
To make you live a life that is wrong
Aggravate, society's pawns
And let them know that you will repay
Enforce, the beliefs that you hold
And you'll live to fight another day
