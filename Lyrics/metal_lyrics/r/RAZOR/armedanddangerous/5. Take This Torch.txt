Searching in the darkness, searching for the light
Looking to the darkness, putting up a fight
Iron chains surround you, you try to make a run
Someone near has found you, and now you see the sun
Bright lights, now you can see where you are
Far, out in the universe
Now, you, try to escape from this spot
Hot, ready or not
Take this torch
Feel the white hot metal, feel it burn your skin
Experience the torture, pay for all your sins
Taken to the stairwell, taken to a cell
Scorches all your body, taste the wrath of hell
