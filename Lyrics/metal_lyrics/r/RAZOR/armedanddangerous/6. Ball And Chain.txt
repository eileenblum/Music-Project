She's on fire with her nasty reputation
I stood back just to view the situtation
She set the trap and I fell right in
Now I'm living in her world of sin
Every night we find a different way
We live by night and sleep all day
Lives so fast only tries to please
One word from her and I'm on my knees
Ball and chain, ball and chain
Without her love, I go insane
Ball and chain, ball and chain
Imaginations's got me drained
She's dragging me down in her world of disgust
Hours of pleasure, dominated by lust
Try to escape but I gave her my pledge
If there's much more of this I'll go over the edge
Got to explain there's no holding back
It's just no use while she's on the attack
I try to tell her that this life's too rough
She jsut shows me that I can't get enough
