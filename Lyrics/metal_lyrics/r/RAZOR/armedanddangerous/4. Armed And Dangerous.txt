Take to the air, take to the seas
There's no one left to answer your pleas
We're going to start a new revolution
And heavy metal is our constitution
We're overcharged with rock 'n' roll
A time bomb waiting to explode
Like a loaded gun ready to blow
You can't hide there's nowhere to go
Armed and dangerous
With the music that we play
Our guitars have the power
To blow you all away
We don't need any weapons
Just the ones that we supply
We're armed and dangerous
And that you can't deny
We're on your side, fighting for your rights
All the losers will be in your sights
If they don't like your leather or the noise
They better look out or they'll face the boys
We're heading your way like a fireball
Rockin' as hard as a solid wall
A big shock wave reaching out for you
If you like it, you can headbang too
