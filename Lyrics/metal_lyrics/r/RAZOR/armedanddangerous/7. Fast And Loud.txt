Metal fury, metal sound
We'll rock this place right to the ground
Pounding drums, pounding bass
The look of anger in your face
Lights and action hit the floor
Speed and power, give me more
Molten mayhem, tempered steel
Love to hear the guitar squeal
Fast and loud
Loud and proud
Gotta rock hard
To please the crowd
Fast and loud
Power trip
Now's the time
To let it rip!
Spikes and leather fill the hall
Really want to please you all
Armoured fists, i see them shake
How much can our bodies take?
Sound of metal in the air
Time for you to get your share
Metal fans fill our dreams
Love to hear your metal screams!

Recorded at the Waxworks, St. Jacobs, Canada, May 1984
