Hang the Jolly Roger, it's time to set the mood
All kinds are invited, the sweeties and the rude
I see so many people, who's here that I know?
I don't see any faces, they're head first in the snow
My dazed eyes closing, how I want to see
What did I just say, I've lost my memory
Find someone to lean against, I don't wanna fall
He can't drive 55, well I can't drive at all
Going Under, but I'm still drinking, and will until dawn's light
I'm Going Under, and I don't care about anything tonight
Noise and confusion, what'd ya say, I can't hear
Don't move the floor I don't wanna spill my beer
Who's that in the corner beyond his own control
It's showbiz with a little wiz and playin' in a hole
Naked women dancin' round, take yor pick today
It doesn't matter who you choose she wants it anyway
Where is it you're taking me going down head first
Then take me for a ride just to quench your thirst
Living hungry just as long as we're livin' on the road
Pretending I understand the road crew's secret code
Hard times the better times, been hangin' here for months
But your life's too short a line and you only live it once
The fast life the only life, one life I know about
So I'm passing out the bottle, while some are passing out
The road long and lonely, last night the tune is sung
I'm gonna live forever, they say the good die young
