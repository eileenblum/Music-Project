Against the odds, we proved them wrong
We challenged and we won
We're doing things our own way
Just like we've always done
People try to tell us why
We'll never be on top
I'm telling you, that we're not through
We're never going to stop
We play too fast, we play too loud
I've heard it all before (Harcore!)
But every time we play a gig
They're coming back for more (Aaahh!)
A smoke filled bar, a rusty car
This is the life I lead
We'll bring our sound to your hometown
I guess we'll stick around
WHITE!... NOISE!... WHITE!... NOISE!
So don't tell us to turn it down
It's just too loud for you!
And don't tell us to change our sound
Cause we'll just say... SCREW YOU!
You might find, we're not your kind
But we've got our pride
So if you don't like Razor
then get your ass outside!!! (NOW!)
