Victims of technology, trapped in future plans
Acting without asking, won't meet our demands
Stuck walking the straight line, opinions overthrown
Deep inside we feel it, chills us to the bone
Society's own children, bodies whitout voice
Decisions made without us, as if we had a choice
Controlled intervention, who are we to trust?
We must get back the power, our freedom gained a must
Survival is our interest, no question of remand
Survival of the fittest, our lives are in their hands
We beg and we plea for some understanding
A sense of awareness is all we're demanding
Twisting the truth to protect their own
The blunt of raw deals is all we've been shown
The echoes of crying, the innocent dying
An evil force reigns so supreme
With sheer devastation, corrupt motivations
They've shattered our unendless dreams
Our brains have been scattered, our blood has been splattered
And no one is telling us why
These things are forbidden, they're keeping it hidden
And sending our youth off to die
We've tried to find out, hear our screams and our shouts
We're building in force by the hour
We will rise above, forsake glory and love
Their half-hearted lives we'll devour
Blinded by power, they are obsessed
With public supremacy they are possessed
Dictatorship flourishes beyond our control
Poverty stricken, now death takes it's toll
Lost inside ourselves, our inner feelings can't be shown
Cast aside as if nothing matters but their own
Force of one rules over, paralyzing life set still
Brainwashed minds diminish captors for their thrill
Who will win the final battle of death or suicide
Thoughts of human independence, warriors of youth will ride
Seeking out a common mainstream, driven by restricted lives
We must all be strong together, our only chance to survive (yeah!)
The power of the free world, is all that we protect
Enemies among us, who will we suspect?
One thing is for certain, things can't stay the same
We will fight to set things right and beat them at their game
