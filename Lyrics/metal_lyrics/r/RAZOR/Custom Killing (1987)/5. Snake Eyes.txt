Pretty as an angel, but the bone of the devil
The smile of a fox, but talking on the level
The figure of a lady peekin' through the holes
Tying down my wings, pulling on my soul
Your fingers are snakes, they're eyes and they see
Everytime we touch you take a bite out of me
Driftin' through my head, all the things that you said
What is written on the walls isn't right until it's read
So read: with your snake eyes
You're the devil's daughter, I've met him, skip the fakin'
You've been growing horns since your halo has been taken
In the trap you were the bait, that was your mistake
I never cared a bit for dirt or a black-eyed city snake
I was hartly temped with a wink and a bottle of sin
I had my own three bottles of the driest kinda gin
Undressed yoy with my eyes and then I realized
Your rolling dice and broken wings gave in to your disguise
Gave in: to your snake eyes
Everything at stake but I've learned my lesson well
You're giving me the choice will I roll heaven or is it hell
Remove the flashy costume, show me what you've got
A taste of what's below, so you'd better make it hot
Can't you see me laughing, you're begging with your cries
The fireballs I'm throwing are burning in your eyes
I can't roll a seven or even an eleven
Give me staring snake eyes, I wasn't made for heaven
Surprise: I've got snake eyes
