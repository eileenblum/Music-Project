Slicing through the silence
Like blades of stainless steel
A rush of metal fury
Forged from what you feel
Mayhem all around you
You know you're not alone
Fierce and violent actions
Crush you to the bone
Driving us higher, we plunge into fire
A desperate risk we must take
Amidst devestation, forced annihilation
Cause of our necks soon to break
FORCE! OOH!
Possessing unknown power
Grinding to your minds
Don't try to escape
It aims, it seeks, it finds
We know you want it louder
An awesome overload
Decibels of torture
So eardrums will explode
Drove killer instinct
A surging in your veins
Past points of resistance
A level we sustain
Our fuel feeds your fire
Cause this is what you choose
Thrashing with aggression
And cutting fuckin' lose
