An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind
We are all one, the only race is human
An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind
We are all one, the only race is human

Life is more precious than land
Both sides must see
Life is more precious than land
Both sides must see

Choose your colors, pick your side

Products of society that promote vindication
Lost sense of morality, murder is not salvation
Let your demons die for love
Let your demons die for love

Choose your colors, pick your side.
Secure what makes you feel alive.

What will it take for you to see?
Murder is not salvation.

We must go past the past. Mankind is in our hands
We must go past the past. Mankind is in our hands

We must go past the past. Mankind is in our hands
There is no way to peace. Peace is the way
Peace is the way
Peace is the way

Acknowledge the massacre
Open your eyes to the slaughter
Acknowledge the massacre
Our last chance to evolve
Our last chance to evolve
