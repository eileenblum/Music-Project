When I was young I used to think I had it all figured out:
The physical didn't lie, and the lies I knew were true
Fed on that common set of beliefs that my school
Then my job, and a little routine would be my everything
But when I started to reflect on my own passions
Something inside me started to cry
All of a sudden everything in the physical was just a mirage
And I knew the only thing which was forever real was already inside of me
No more compromising with the material world
Meeting the demands of those living as ghosts
Not in this lifetime would I watch from the sidelines
As my true ambitions would be silenced
I knew that the only thing that was forever real was already inside of me
I was my essence
My Soul

I will not fall victim to your will.
I will not fall victim to your ways.

This flesh and bone is just a fraction of what we are
This flesh and bone is just a fraction of what we are

I will not fall victim to your will.
I will not fall victim to your ways.

I will not fall victim to your will, your ways, to your web (to your will, your ways, to your web)
I will not fall victim
I will not fall victim
