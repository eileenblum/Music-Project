"In our battle against those that detest our free and prosperous society, we cannot
Sacrifice any of the pillars our nation stands upon, namely respect for the
Constitution and the rule of law. We must demonstrate to the world that America
Is the best example of what a solid constitution with properly enforced laws can
Bring to those who desire freedom and safety. If we become hypocrites about our
Own legal system, how can we sell it abroad or question legal systems different
That our own?"

Force-feeding this artificial pride
As our freedom is tossed to the side
Force-feeding this artificial pride
As our freedom is tossed to the side

How can we liberate others, when we can't liberate ourselves?
How can we liberate others, when we can't liberate ourselves?
How can we liberate others, when we can't liberate ourselves?
How can we liberate others, when we can't liberate ourselves?

When they said that it was legal, they took it all away
And when they took all of it away, freedom died that day
When they said that it was legal, they took it all away
And when they took all of it away, freedom died that day

And we watch as they dry the blood on their hands with the flames of the constitution.
(All lies. They sold us illusions and promises.)

Our amendments are dropping like flies
Our amendments are dropping like flies

It's all part of the novus ordo seclorum
It's all part of the novus ordo seclorum

Modern Day Babylon...
Give us back our rights.
