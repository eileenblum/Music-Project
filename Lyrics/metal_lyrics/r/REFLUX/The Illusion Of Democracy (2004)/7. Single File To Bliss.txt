Who are you to label blasphemy
When you try to redefine veracity
My soul will not be manufactured

Only a blind soul could think that these stories could be the answer to all
History alone cannot enlighten your soul to be one with god

You can't bear witness to the cure of your own disease
You can't bear witness to the cure of your own disease
Involuntarily adamant, synthetic sense of attachment
Involuntarily adamant, synthetic sense

I must step aside (just follow)
I must step aside (just follow me)
I must step aside (just follow)
I must step aside
Single file to bliss. Just follow
Single file to bliss. Just follow me
Single file to bliss. Just follow
Single file to bliss. Follow me
I must step aside
Single file to bliss. I step aside
Single file to bliss. I step aside

Praise the ones who pave the way to our graves
The only hope left now is revolution.
Praise the ones who pave the way to our graves
The only hope left now is revolution.
Revolution
Revolution

The time has come
I know that our goal is for every man to atone
For I won't condone those who don't want to see all men grow
Decide: bombs or Christ. You cannot be for both

The innocent cannot be spent filling the pockets of guilty men
You will wear your stigma alone.
