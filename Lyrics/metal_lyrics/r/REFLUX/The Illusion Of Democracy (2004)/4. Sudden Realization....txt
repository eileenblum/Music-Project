So this is how you wish to portray yourself to the ones you love and to the ones you have just met?
This is not a desire reflection
This is just and easy way for you to regress

This relentless mirage, will cause you to subside
Your perception will be cured, as clarity arrives

Time to disband the hubris
Disband the hubris
Disband the hubris
Let go, let go, let go
Disband the hubris

This relentless mirage, will cause you to subside
Your perception will be cured, as clarity arrives

So this is how you wish to portray yourself to the ones you love and to the ones you have just met?
This is not a desire reflection
This is just and easy way for you to regress

Nothing can speak louder than silence when all you want
Is to understand yourself. I cannot hold you hand

Proceed to progress
Proceed to progress
Proceed to progress
Proceed to progress

Nothing can speak louder than silence when all you want is to understand yourself
Nothing can speak louder than
Silence when all you want
Is to understand yourself
