Surroundings do not define you
Against indolence, all things are relative (things are relative... relative)
Only actions can speak truth
You define what you perceive

You control what happens next
Will it be what you expect?
You control what happens next
And will it be what you expect?

There's no scapegoat, shift the focus
There's no scapegoat, shift the focus
Shift the focus, there's no scapegoat
Shift the focus, there's no scapegoat
Shift the focus, there's no scapegoat
Shift the focus

Surroundings do not define you. Only actions can speak truth
Surroundings do not define you. Only actions can speak truth
Don't throw it, don't throw it away.
Don't throw it, don't throw it away.
Don't throw it, don't throw it away.

Surroundings do not define you
Against indolence, all things are relative (things are relative... relative)
Only actions can speak truth
You define what you perceive
(Perception and environment go hand in hand)

It's not a gambit if it's all that you want
It's just a damn shame when it doesn't work out
It's not a gambit if it's all that you want
It's just a damn shame when it falls apart
It's not a gambit if it's all that you want.
It's just a damn shame when it work

Nothing that I could do could save yourself from your future.
You manifested this existence
Now find the will to endure. Find the will to endure.
Find the will to endure.
Find the will to endure.
Find the will to endure.
Find the will to endure.

Surroundings do not define you
Pilot your fate through tomorrow's shade
Only actions can speak truth
Pilot your fate through tomorrow's shade

You control what happens next, will it be what you expect
There is no scapegoat.
Thoughts dictate reality.
Thoughts dictate reality.
Thoughts dictate reality.
Thoughts dictate reality.
