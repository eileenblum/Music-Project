Don't force regret
This is a coup d'Ã©tat of your systematic failure
This is a coup d'Ã©tat of what you've made
I will sacrifice all of your traditions
So that I can fulfill my own dreams

What you glorify... the perfect orthodox
It's just another way... of keeping me blind
What you glorify... the perfect orthodox
It's just another way... of keeping me blind
To what could be... keeping me blind to what could be me

Don't force regret upon my ears (don't force regret)
Don't force regret upon my ears (do not glorify this)

The only path that I'll walk down is the one my heart lays
The only path that I'll walk down is the one my heart lays

You cannot replace happiness with status
There's no sunlight in my cubicle

Those who abandon their dreams will be the fist to discourage yours
Those who abandon their dreams will be the fist to discourage yours

Don't force regret upon my ears
Don't force regret upon my ears
