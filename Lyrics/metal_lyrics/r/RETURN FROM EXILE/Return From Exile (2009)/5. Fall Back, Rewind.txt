when you think about the end
do you think we're burning the pages
riding the flames of life
and let them crash us down just because
Crash me down from floating
buried like a plague not growing
Eternity lives in
Imagination that tells the truth from courage and love there our sources above
Feel all the sources above
Eternity will set us free
Imagination lives in me
Forget the rules forget time
Fallback, Rewind
Pick up the sand now squeeze it tightly like a man
Burst into pieces
the windows open so grab her hand
and now you know the answer is in understanding
resisting all fear makes everything so real
I'm not afraid anymore
eternity, it lives in me
imagination sets us free
Forget the lies
