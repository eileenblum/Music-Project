This party's never over

Enjoy the Chaos of this moment
bow down and drink your wine
forgive selfish fulfillment, enjoy the ride

Six billion people and at last your having fun with one of them
Your kicked out of the parents house but that lack of ambition is not a sin

So we, freak out and have a celebration
So you, kick open the door and try to get in
these are the times you can see from inside
so kick open the door, get open the door, and try to get in

And let yourself in..

its obvious that we've perfected the art of partying with the masses

six billion people and at last your having fun with all of them
your kicked out of your parents house but the lack of ambition is not a sin

the end of a night, the end of this night won't arrive
till your ready to die

oh I've lost control

this party's never over
we can sing and dance all night
make this fountain flow forever
drink it down until we die
