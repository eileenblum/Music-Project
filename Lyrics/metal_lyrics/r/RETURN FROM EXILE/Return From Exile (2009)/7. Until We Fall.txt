Won't you take me there

Do you feel the devastation
some never feel
alive
locked in its complicated
but we're going out tonight

I'm
contributing to this party till I drop
and like a Trojan warrior we drink till
we fall

And will we ever see the sunshine?

Hell ya!! do you feel the
devastation
Hell ya!! its a beautiful night and I'm feeling
alright

Exploring the options of a needed release
My thoughts are obsessed
with the physical being
Exploring the options of a needed release

Take me
there, where people drink away the pain
It always helps me to get through the
day
of an undetermined year [x2]

Its complicated but still perfected with
you

with the presence of you there was something to do
at last my mind
forgives for what I have done

and I look at the body, and its used, and
abused, I look at the body
It has become a temple of the soul, It has
become!

And there was preachers, aligning me from the insane
Aligning me
from the insane
I won't be a victim of someone else's superstition
I won't be
a victim of their strength

The freedom bells sing me to sleep
I walk a fine
line...

Standing alone, could be so wrong, we are still here, we are still
strong
Until we fall down into the silence...
We fall down into the
silence...

Oh did you ever think that this stranger
would lead you to the
emptiness inside
when you look back and you don't even know

As I stand on
the wings of the beast I am changed, and unborn
[x2]

but deep inside, I know
there's time
I'll find a home
A soul of my own
Persistence through Existence
is mine..
