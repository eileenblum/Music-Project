I tried my best to hold onto you.
What else could I do if your not even here with me.
Nothing survives within its own self.
The bond will be broken if you don't reach out.

You must reach out.

In my dream we swim in the sea, only you and me.
There is a boat made of gold,
and the girls on board say get inside me.
I can't stay pure if you aren't even here.

This man has lost his connection.

You try to save me but the whores on board scream get inside me.
You try to save me but the line is broken.

You try to save me, pull the line.
Pull the line for the last time.

True love lies lost in a virgins eyes.
True love lies lost in a memory.

True love lies lost in the memory of my virgins eyes.

The gods have set us free.
Now beauty in this world contradicts everything I believe.
This darkness overwhelms me.
Unholy beings devour my soul.

Nothing survives within its own self.
The bond will be broken if you don't reach out.

Another line is broken; for the last time I am broken.
