Sister, I will always be here
We are the sea and forever we remain
Through all years, I will keep you near
Sister, I will always be here

Mount Olympus stood grand, casting shadow across the land
Ceasing the sun's existence in the caverns below
Under the realm of gods, rumoured daemons living where land meets the great sea
Said to be spawn of gods themselves, eating voyagers of the sea

The daughters of Phorcys and Ceto, born below the world
Damned to live forever hidden from the sun
Legend demonised Stheno and immortal sister Euryale; elegant, gentle and caring creatures
Living in harmony with waves for a thousand years of the early age

Fortune cursed the Gorgons in the form of one god; young Zeus arrived, hunting for the head of such a creature
The peaceful and wise Stheno witnessed Jupiter's arrival on the island and fled, fearful of his intentions

Neither man nor god set foot in the caverns until the young one came, confident in his youth and with malice in heart
He took chase, hunting the mortal Stheno as she ran to protect her sister, but to no avail
The caring woman impaled by Jupiter's sword

All that I know lies here bleeding
Love forsakes me; I am undone
You were comfort; my compassion
Love lies broken; I am undone

Jupiter lifted the corpse by the hair and detached the head
Turning only a menacing smile to the young girl as he fled the island

All that she knew in life lay beheaded and in spasm, jerking violently and staining the rocks in sharp blood
And for thousand years that followed, the girl mourned her only love
Screaming out to the sea that had given her false safety
Alone in the world, Euryale in time became her own myth
Luring and killing the men of sea who wandered too far from the known
Feeding on the eyes and brains, and all that she felt caused mankind to commit wrong
