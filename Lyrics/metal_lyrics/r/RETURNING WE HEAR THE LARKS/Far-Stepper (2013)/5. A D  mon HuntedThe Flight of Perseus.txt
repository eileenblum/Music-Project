Medusa stared out to sea for eternity
Traumatised by what the world had brought upon her
And through all the years, her sister watched on
Desperate to quell the pain of her younger

As time progressed, Euryale's passion began to swell
The despair she felt for Medusa grew to something more
Until she could restrain no longer and held her sister
In a passionate embrace of love and sorrowful empathy

The Gorgons' love for each other blossomed intensely
And Medusa realised the comfort she so desperately craved
In the arms of her own sister
Yet the love they shared was cut tragically short
By whispers of another's arrival

The sisters, cursed with such ill fate, would never last in peace
And in melancholy recurrence, a warrior did arrive
Perseus, child of the gods, intent on bloodshed
Fueled by the lies told of the Gorgon sisters
With the reflection shield by his side to avoid her damned gaze
Tasked with removing the head of the feared Medusa
A dÃ¦mon hunted

With stealth of foot, Perseus hunted the Gorgons
Rendering them defenceless to his onslaught of steel
Euryale fought to protect her sister with all she could muster
But was beaten and broken by the sheer power of holy Perseus
Medusa in his sight

Deadly teeth and claws made Medusa a worthy foe for a warrior
Though his experience in battle gave Perseus higher ground
Clashing at blinding speeds, the Gorgon fought with all she had to survive
Yet the warrior's master skill rendered Medusa nothing but prey

Beating the girl into submission, Perseus tore her cursed eyes from her head
Reducing the feared dÃ¦mon of stone to a young girl, writhing in agony upon the rocks
Euryale lay paralysed, watching her life destroyed
As Perseus lifted the girl by the hair and separated her head from body with a swing of the sword

All the world was numb as Euryale watched the blood of her only love burst from the battered and decapitated corpse
Perseus smirked as he tossed the naked body to the ground
Drenching Euryale in her true love's dying blood

Flight

As swiftly as he had arrived, Perseus made his departure
The youngest Gorgon's head in hand
Fueled by the purest rage and despair, Euryale summoned the strength
To raise her broken body in pursuit

Giving chase to the holy assailant
Euryale's speed fueled by such intense malice
Desperate to slay and eat the man who had destroyed her love
To find solace in the taste of his organs

Yet with the speed of gods at his heel, Perseus outran his pursuer
Never to be seen again, Euryale left broken

Sister, I will always be here
We are the sea and forever we remain
Through all years, I will keep you near
Sister, I will always be here
