Raised and adored by her guardian to the tender age of fifteen
Medusa learnt of her sister's betrayal and demise by hand of the gods
Ignoring the orders of her elder and straying far from her home
The youngest Gorgon set upon a quest to avenge the death of her own

A journey far from the caverns and shores of the world that Medusa knew
Ascending the perilous Mount Olympus, searching for answers
A path paved with ghouls and creatures seeking to corrupt the girl
Met only by a beacon of passion, fueled by her vengeance in heart

Medusa arrived in a temple of marble, bathed in the sun's sky
And marvelled at the dazzling realm of gods
But soon, a man approached the young girl; beautiful, eternal
He led her to the shadows

Here; stay still, little girl and do just as I say

Forcing himself onto the young girl, Poseidon, god of the sea did mount
Medusa violently
Grasping the child's face, though her screams still resounded throughout the marble temple
As the raping of Medusa was heard through Olympus
The innocence of the Gorgons, forever lost

Goddess Athena witnessed the desecration of her temple
Shielding her virgin eyes from a holy abomination
And in punishment for allowing such an act, cursed the Gorgon Medusa
Destined to turn to stone the bodies of all mortal gaze upon her

Though Euryale cared for nothing more in the world than her sister
Medusa's lonely existence longed for the companionship of another
But damned to never gaze into mortal eyes again
Her innocence destroyed, she cursed the sea
