For eternity, she called to the sea
Questioning its betrayal and disregard
But the waves only responded in maddening confidence
Caressing her body and engulfing her in all she knew
The song of the ocean

Until the day arrived for Phorcys and Ceto to return to the caverns in shame
And hide themselves in their acts unholy
Euryale looked on, witnessing her parents' violent embrace
Until the gods returned to the heavens and a cry was heard from the soul of Olympus

A mortal infant lay still on the cave floor
Its eyes shut tight to the new world
Her sister took her in arms
Embracing Medusa for the first time
And life regained a purpose

Euryale became the mother of her sister, as Stheno had before her
And as the infant grew, she cared for nothing else in life
Cherishing her every step and each embrace
And the world could do no wrong
