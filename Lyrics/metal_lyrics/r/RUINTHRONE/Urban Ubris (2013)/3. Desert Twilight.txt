Three days, Iâm walking
And through the desert Iâm crawling;
My city is burning, they are looking for me.
A talisman, it brings the energy
Iâm taking it with me
But itâs corrupted and Iâm feeling so much thorn

[Lead: Adriano &amp; NicolÃ²]

They are so high, flying in the sky
In the twilight I saw one of them
Iâve got to run faster than my enemies
If I fail theyâll bring me down

No, I wonât forget the fountains gushing
And the never ending sun,
But now I donât know if Iâm strong enough
To bring this bundle on my mind

[Lead: NicolÃ²]

There is an instant in the day
Where the sunset and the dawn are the same
In that moment I will understand
If my eyes are shining for the light,
The tiredness or if theyâll just brighten
Because of the tears

Something is crashing in me
I have lost my duty
And Iâm feeling near to ruin
Neglecting the talisman to survive

No, I wonât forget the fountains gushing
And the never ending sun,
But now I donât know if Iâm strong enough
To bring this bundle on my mind

[Solo 1: NicolÃ² â Solo 2: Giorgio]

I was just trying to forget all this pain
Sometimes I talk to the wind
Lacerated by the doubt

No, I wonât forget the fountains gushing
And the never ending sun,
But now I donât know if Iâm strong enough
To bring this bundle on my mind
