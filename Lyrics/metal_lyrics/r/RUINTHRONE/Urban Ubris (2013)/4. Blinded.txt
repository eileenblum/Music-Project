To who knows the answers
I curse your name
Prisoner of my life, chains everywhere
I canât recall how I came to her but
I remember the day

It was spring, not so far
Now itâs all disappeared
From her eyes, oh your eyes
And the echoes of fear in my whispering wish
I never knew the answer, oh no

Shall time make you forgive my crimes?

Wander, while the leaves of life are all falling
Come and take my hand in this dream
Blinded by the light of tears in your eyes
And by the chains of pride

[Lead: Adriano]

All sins and violence left behind
And the cries of thousands souls
Refused the light of the Firstborn
Rode against the human fear
Master of Doom, Blacksword
Outlaw, in darkest places bound
Fall of the underground reign
And murdered the only friend

Gurthang, your blade in shining red
âI shall slay thee swiftlyâ
Desirous to spill my blood
And bring it to an end

I saw your pale beauty in this place
Maid of Tears
Love has risen high
Iâve changed my name and I have changed my life
But fate is the same
No escape

Wander, while the leaves of life are all falling
Come and take my hand in this dream
Blinded by the light of tears in your eyes
And by the chains of pride

[Solo: Adriano]

Wander, while the leaves of life are all falling
Come and take my hand in this dream
Blinded by the light of tears in your eyes
And by the chains of pride
Great Worm, you accomplished the will of your dark lord
But you couldnât stop my hand
Blinded by the light of tears in her eyes
Cursed be your name, Black One
