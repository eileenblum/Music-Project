Today is September, thereâs no reflection in this river
The one the witch showed
The prophecyâ¦ it seems so long ago

âOne of you'll sacrifice to allow the other one to surviveâ
Sadly the curse said so
âOne year you'll not find both reflections on the water,
The less deserving will understand in his heart
(and) will have to fade away"
âIt's not true, be careful, we are powerful!â
But I knew I'd be the one

Just for you I'll die tomorrow
And this hope will be my last sorrow
Then your life will have a change
Facing a new challenge
Like an old snake skin I'll crumble

[Lead: Adriano]

I dreamed the blind sight in front of me watching
And digging in me, I lied
I didnât know the answer to the mute's question
I couldnât âcause I am not deaf

Iâm a chiral twin
My destiny is to accept with no remorse
My vanishing,
I can steal your breath no more

Just for you I'll die tomorrow
And this rope will be my last sorrow
Then your life will have a change
Facing a new challenge
Like an old snake skin I'll crumble

[Solo: NicolÃ²]

We were like two trees sharing the same lymph
Weâre the same symphony
But now the lymph is not enough to feed us
We sing different songs

Iâm glad to hear your voice singing aloud
For the first time in our life
My voice was already fading since I was young

Today is the day Iâm not afraid at all
