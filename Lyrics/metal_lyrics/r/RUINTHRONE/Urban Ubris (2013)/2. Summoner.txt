Now my trial is complete
I control this power
Our Sin is haunting all the seas
Condemning us to death
Iâm supposed to stop his rage
Only for a short time
I shall leave all I have, forever
And find my way

Oh, how I wish to see my land again
Ten years are passed, now the shades are here once again
Never look back, all my guardians by my side
And I will delete all the crimes

I still believe thereâs a way to reach what lies behind this pain
Gods and religion inside, just a game we cannot play
Over the lands I will fly high
And Iâll carry on until we fade away

Why, why are this people here fighting to set the same world free?
Why this clash and these screams, like a challenge for the final prize?
I feel the lies, I feel their eyes are watching me
Thereâs something wrong that I canât see
Clergy commands, clergy condemns all they call sin
I trusted them, but is it right?
You can see fading lights in the wind
Souls of lives Sin denied
Soldiers, machines on the battlefield
Meanwhile people still die
So I will delete all the crimes

I still believe thereâs a way to reach what lies behind this pain
Gods and religion inside, just a game we cannot play
Over the lands I will fly high
And Iâll carry on until we fade away

[Solo: Adriano]

Pure corruption, thatâs what I found out
Iâm just a part in their game
Facing the end I open my eyes
Your prays are nothing but lies
Vain hopes led me so far
But I canât delete all the crimes

I still believe thereâs a way to reach what lies behind this pain
Gods and religion inside, just a game we cannot play
Over the lands I will fly high
And Iâll carry on until we fade away
