What is this â a noisy and crumbling prison with no bars?
What is this leaden sky?
Why are all these bright lights dancing?

Here Iâve found myself
Trapped in darkness, bound forever in this world
Where thereâs nothing thatâs worth dreaming
Where thereâs nothing left to sing

All is lost, there is no turning back in to the times
Where hearts were far from it â this never ending storm
You run away from me on and on, on and on
Always to far to grab on my hand
Dancing lights, donât run
Please, dance for me

It has begun
A vain future, nothing more
Beauty lies in agony
The flameâs lost, but they donât feel it
Who knows why?

Void, hereâs what theyâre looking for
No passion, future, oh, it lies unknown

Iâll never, yes never, Iâll never belong to this void
Tomorrowâs dark, yesterdayâs gone
Iâll never, yes never, Iâll never belong to this world
Hearts still dream, I shall never fall

All is lost, there is no turning back in to the times
Where hearts were far from it â this never ending storm
You run away from me on and on, on and on
Always to far to grab on my hand
Dancing lights, donât run
Please, dance for me

You look pale
Oh, where have you been for so long?
You are here now
Please, take me to the place I call home
Where reigns the light and beauty canât fall
So, please, lead me back
Here I canât show what I am
Suddenly, left again alone
The flame of beauty is gone

Here Iâve found myself
In this place where I canât see legend nor poems
I shall not sing just human lies
Decay covers my eyes
But I carry in my memory
Those days of magic
And the creatures of the dawn
Where is the dawn?

Oh, youâre gone, I have to stay
Gone, to leave me alone

All is lost, there is no turning back in to the times
Where hearts were far from it â this never ending storm
You run away from me on and on, on and on
Always to far to grab on my hand
Dancing lights, donât run
Please, dance for me
