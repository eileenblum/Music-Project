Iâve found in this silence the way to heaven
And listen you whispering me, dear night
The flame here is warming my heart and soul
Sitting alone in the new worldâs shades
Donât be afraid to look back
Please, hear my words one last time

I know youâre not here to see me this night
And not even I am now here for you
You canât remain, and Iâm just passing by
The road goes on and will lead me away

And it will lead you far from me
Long ago we were friends
But you wonât remember me
In the wind, my song will end

[Solo: Adriano]

I came from a dream deep inside your soul
I belong to a different world, my friends
I speak to the night but my words are for you
She will take me home

[Lead: Adriano]

Like all dreams, like a chant from the sky
From a world you have left far behind
I will fade and leave you to daylight
We will meet at the end of your time

[Solo: NicolÃ²]
