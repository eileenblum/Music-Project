Far away Iâve dragged my fate
Away from inner dreams
There are places where the shades of past
Cannot find the way to the depths of heart
Life and day, cold and night Iâm passing through
Then the ode comes to me again
Rhymes of blood and filled of tears

Itâs just another cry
Feel it coming from the waters, through the trees
It seems like death to me
But itâs only another cry
Feel it coming down and wandering around
In this suffering world

Far away Iâve dragged my fate
Away from inner lies
Even here I canât find peace
War, genocides, our wounded mother earth
I run away, but pain will never leave
Canât you hear their calls
Our future dying
Are your ears so deaf or you just donât care?

Itâs just another cry
Feel it coming from the waters, through the trees
It seems like death to me
But itâs only another cry
Fell it coming down and wandering around
In this suffering world

[Solo: Adriano]

Itâs just another cry
Feel it coming from the waters, through the trees
It seems like death to me
But itâs only another cry
Fell it coming down and wandering around
In this suffering world

Weâre left alone
Time goes by and the voices fade away
