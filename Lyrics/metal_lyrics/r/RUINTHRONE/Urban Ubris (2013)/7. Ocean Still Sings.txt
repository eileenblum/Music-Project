She was dressed in moonshine
And her black hair swayed in the wind
Like a whisper her ship glided on the silver sea
As mist quietly rises

Hear the story of the traveler
Queen of all the open seas
I tell the truth, Iâve met her long ago

âTake a look into the bright horizon
Find what youâre heading forâ
These were the only words she said
Then she kept on her way
She was not alone, tens of people
Chose to follow her
To start again their lives

Walking at night in solitude
The beast became a fairy

Good or bad, I cannot say at all
Sometimes the price to pay was too much
Her ship brought freedom, and dreams
But still, even blood and death
And then she fled before it was too late
Fading in the sunset, she sang

âCaptain, you are my guide
Captain, lead me in light
Captain, my only loveâ
I have heard it all
Landing at the rugged coasts
Running fast from town to town
Professing her message
She was singing loud
Until her voice filled the air
Crystal clear, untouched by time

[Lead: Adriano]

The wind was carrying her story
And anyone heard of the beautiful traveler
Sure, some loved her but still many people
Considered her deeds pure recklessness
Free, ruthless, with no chains
Keep on singing loud
A bloody gem in a world of shades
Keep on singing loud
And the ocean still sings her name
Keep on singing loud

Followers, a cloud hiding the enemies
She was betrayed
See the fairy without wings, the beast tamed
Death awaited her
(but) Reaching the cave nighttime
They found her
No more

âCaptain, you are my guide
Captain, lead me in light
Captain, my only loveâ
I have heard it all
Landing at the rugged coasts
Running fast from town to town
Professing her message
She was singing loud
Until her voice filled the air
Crystal clear, untouched by time

Still across the seas her song can be heard
She is said to travel only by herself
And thereâs no one else
A ghost on the calm sea in the night
She is said to travel only by herself
And thereâs no one else
She has left all her struggles behind
She is said to travel only by herself
And thereâs no one else
She has left all her speeches behind
She is said to travel only by herself
And thereâs no one else
She has left all her speeches behind
Hear the tale of the traveler

The meaning of her fate
So hard to explain, folk
Still lays in the rhymes she sang
Softly and sweet
And nobody knows
Where her captain might be
Still, I know his name
He is called Liberty
