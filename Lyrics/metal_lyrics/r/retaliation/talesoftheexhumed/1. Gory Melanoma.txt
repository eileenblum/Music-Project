[musick &amp; lyrixxx - Ross Sewage, 1997]

Malignant sores seep,
Pustules erupt with cheese,
Degeneration of epithelium,
Phagocytic cells increase...

The carcinoma disseminates through lymphatic fluid,
Giving rise to a myriad of metastic moppets,
Lambasted by lesions and suffering tissue rejection,
As your countenance glides off in deliquesced droplets...

Infected layers of skin disembogue in sullied chunks,
Cleaved from connective tissue by fitful hands,
Your long face accentuated by pendulant flesh,
Debilitated by an aberration in the DNA strand...

Corpulent moles and warts,
Symptoms of the sarcoma,
Abrading the neoplasm,
You avulse the keratoma...

A tumorous husk is amassed and left to decay,
Emitting a foul septic aroma,
Ameliorate the disease through total dermal regeneration,
You slough the gory melanoma...
Irradiated and mutated,
Cancerous cells deviate,
Carcinogens and pathogens,
The integument you exuviate...
