Pray to the monarch of your soul is your life enlightened enough?
Eat your "bread" drink your "wine" and thank your god for your life
Father, the son and the holy crap opiate the masses
Popes, priests and patriarchs leaders of lambs and sinners
Christ's agents teach their lies lies of "wisdom", eternal lies

Here is my desire its eternal light and god created earth
God created light god created night thy will be done!
And god created all the beasts god created man thy will be done!
And Lord created hate Lord created war Lord created wrath thy will be done!
And Lord created kings Lord created slaves Lord created guns thy will be done!
God=Fear Death=Fear God's slave pathetic slave
