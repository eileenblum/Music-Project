Lost in shades of darkness my soul is dying once more
I'm lying here helpless I'm dying here nameless
A voice whispers in my ears, never look an ashtray full of thoughts
It's gonna bring you tears It's gonna make you fall
Hate me

Looking back in shades of past, so much lies have been told
I can't go on I can't go on
I'm lying here faithless I'm fading here in emptiness
I can't go on I can't go on
So much time spent, looking for love
So much wine I've drunk and I still want more

Kill me for me it's all the same
Deny me for me it's all the same
Hate me for me it's all the same
Kill me for me it's all the same
Deny me for me it's all the same
Save me for me it's all the same
