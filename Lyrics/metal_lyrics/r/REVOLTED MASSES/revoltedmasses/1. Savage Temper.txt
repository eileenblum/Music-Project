Politic tricks and lies, keep us blind
The world is in war, cause money is the law
I won't stay and watch I will fight you back
I will defy your system come again you fools
Today's massive killers are baptized saints
They are in front of us they are TV stars
They kill for money money is their god
They keep us hypnotized look at the clock

It's time to raise your voice it's time to wake up
From your eternal slumbers wake up with wrath
War, starvation, slaves of rotten nations
I dare, I try, I feel denied my dreams, my fears 
The time is near revolution, evolution the only solution
