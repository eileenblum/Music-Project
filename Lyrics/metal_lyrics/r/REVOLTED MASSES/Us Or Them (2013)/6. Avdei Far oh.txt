Another day, in this deserted hell
I must obey whatever they say, treated like animal
Until the sunset comes
Day after day, I feel the whip's wrath
It's said that we're blessed, that's a curse
To build pharaoh's grave, to build someone's pride

Another day, I'm slave of my fate
I must endure all the pain, 
How much torture and misery in a tyrant's name?
I was never free from my cradle to my grave
I'm never free from dawn to dusk
For his vanity I'll die
Without having seen the sky

Under the sun I was born near Nile's shore
Raised as workhorse, I was told I'm a servant of god
The lies unfold, there is no god, they've chained my soul, torn me apart

As the sun comes down, I will rest my soul
No masters! Never! You cannot slave my thoughts

Someday my kind will wake, masters will be slaves
Gods will be rats, tyranny shall pass

As the sun comes down, I will rest my soul
No masters! Never! You cannot slave my thoughts

Pharaoh demands our praise
God demands our death
How did a man become god?
When mankind lost its mind?
I see a man in the throne (not a god)
A common man filled with arrogance
For power and glory he kills
For power and glory starves his voracious mind
