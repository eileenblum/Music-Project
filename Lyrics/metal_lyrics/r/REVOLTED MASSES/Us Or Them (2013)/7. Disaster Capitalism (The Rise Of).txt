Politics preaching horror
Politics preaching the gospel of injustice
Economic depression
Rise of mass torture

Unconventional methods
For disorientation of the people
Warning! It's the defalcation of the poor

Sleep deprivation 
We have come to default
Apathetic we watch 
The suspension of our laws
Politics preaching evil

This is war 
Are you shocked?
This is a war
Are you shocked enough?
This is war, systemic war
This is a war
Defend your lives

Fear and lies 
Blow your mind 
Deceitful binds

Deceitful binds 
Make you blind
Bury your hopes

Their greedy souls
Need more and more
Riches and gold

They want you to starve
Play their games
They want you to beg

We are in debt they say
Any fool can see the truth
We are not obliged, we won't pay their crimes
Lies! No more lies!
