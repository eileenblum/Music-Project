Tremendous growth for the rich exploiting the poor
Repression and religion make alien-nations
Arrogant pigs prepare, this Babylon will fall
Revolted masses will bring our revelation

It's time for the starving child to have revenge
It will eat your head and wipe his mouth with your money
It's time for working class heroes to prevail
Run you little green pigs, we are hungry

Come on slaves break your rusty chains
Take your lives in your own hands
Come on blind see the red light
And we will raise the red flag

[From âThe Internationaleâ]
"Arise workers from your slumbers
Arise prisoners of want
For reason in revolt now thunders
And at last ends the age of cant

I cannot see,
What democracy means
Everybody but me
So raise your voice
Raise your fists

âAway with all your superstitions
Servile masses arise
We'll change henceforth the old tradition
And spurn the dust to win the prize"

Arise
For reason
