Debt rise from filth 
Prosperity, deceit
Class terrorism 
Submit
Rage or sleep

Free trade, interest rate, I suffocate
Wallmart Stores, Shell, BP, ING, State of Gr(ee)d
What? What?

I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna see, I don't wanna feel
When the time is right I'll paint the red line
I don't wanna feel,I don't wanna see, I don't wanna hear
When the time is right I'll paint the red line

People starve, rich devour
Inequity
Disposable flesh
We are possessed
We are the damned

Slave trade, sweat unpaid
I suffocate
In Nike and Mars Inc. child's work
For nothing they bleed

âRecent research shows that the richest 10% own 85% of the global wealth,
while half of the world population lives on less than 2 dollars per dayâ

Is this your democracy?

This liberal democracy
Based on fallacies is aristocracy
Delivered by tyrannies
Supported by idiocracy
Founded upon lies and filth
Fatal corruption and greed
You want the truth?
Here is the truth
Dominated by the few
We are the fuel, we are their tools
We are the mules, there are no rules
We are the fools
