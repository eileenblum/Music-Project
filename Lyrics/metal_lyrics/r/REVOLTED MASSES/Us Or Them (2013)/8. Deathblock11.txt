Welcome to this fortress of pain
I'll cripple you, I'll let you starve
The crematorium greets you savage
I'll use you or you'll be gassed
Undress you piece of shit
Undress you little cunt
Taste my spit you fuck
Taste your own blood

Is this a nightmare
Wake me mother, help me mother
Is this my friend's corpse, lying next to me?
Wake me God, help me God
What's that smell in the air
This is the smell of death
Walk he said, I must stand
I cannot stand, my legs are smashed

Where do they take me?
Passing doors, only howls
I look through the window, they're hanging a man
My heart beats fast
Where do they take me?
(SS soldier) Halt den Mund!
Water Please!
(SS soldier) Halt die Klappe!
Stop! Please STOP!

Inside four walls...God!
Nothing to see...Nothing!
My skin cracks and swells...It hurts!
It's been a week...Mother!
Inside these walls...God!
In utter blackness...Nothing!
Only screams
I can barely breathe
Water please...Please please give me water
My body rots slowly...It hurts!
What have you done to me?
What have you done?

What have you done to me?
