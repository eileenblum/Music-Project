[feat. Tanya Leontiou]Still in my dark cell, still I hear the groans
I feel the snake on the cross poisoning this world
They build the master race
They build the master race again

Again they rise from the filth of this world
Controlled hysteria triggered by fear and hate
Sickened euphoria from killing the poor
Mengele's descents still practice the dogma

I smell the burning flesh 
It's in the air
A shower of death
Will cleanse my sins
Inside four walls
The horror and pain
The horror and pain remains

Still alive, I'm a shadow that still remains
I hear your breaths, I smell your decline
The reich's not dead

Don't forget me
You will forget
Don't forget me 
You will forgive...You will forget


I still smell the burning flesh
I will never forget
...No, no, please no! Why? Why?

I still see the shadow moves
I will never forget
...You will forget! I see you, your decline

Never forget

...I can still smell the burning flesh
 I can still see the shadows moving
I will never forget...
