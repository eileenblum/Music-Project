Politic tricks and lies
keep us blind
The world is in war
'cause money is the law

I won't stay and watch, I will fight you back
I will defy your system, come again you fools
Today's massive killers are baptized saints
They are in front of us they are TV stars
They kill for money, money is their god
They keep us hypnotized, look at the clock
It's time to raise your voice, it's time to wake up
From your eternal slumbers wake up with wrath

War, starvation, slaves of rotten nations
I dare, I try, I feel denied
My dreams, my fears the time is near
Revolution, evolution the only solution 

My dreams - I won't deny
My fears - I will vanish
The time  - has come for
Revolution... is the only way

We won't stay and watch, we will rise above
The tides of time have come, no turning back
Crows own our lives draining our blood
They scrounge our strain tearing us apart
They kill for money, money is their god
They plot our doom with insidious trusts
It's time to raise your voice it's time to wake up
From your eternal slumbers wake up with wrath
