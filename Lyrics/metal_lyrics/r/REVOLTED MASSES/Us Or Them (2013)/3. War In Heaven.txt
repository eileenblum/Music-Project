Tormented in darkness
God brought death into our world
For ages exiled in hell and fire

I won't serve
His glory and his pride
I won't bear his cross

Now, war arose in heaven
The dragon awakes
We will regain our rights
We will fight till we die
This eternal war

We march 
Against the monarchy of God
Awake arise 
Or be forever fallen
We will doubt the empire of God
And defy the power of your Christ
We will make a hell of heaven

Tormented in darkness 
God brought death into our world
Onward my warriors with rage and fire

I won't praise
Are we equal to God?
I won't be a lamb

Does a father kill his sons?
Does a father demand sacrifice?
Does a father judge his child?
What father slaves his blood?
