Fear not the one that they tell you to
Help not the one that's portrayed as a victim
Don't turn your head to the one that needs you
Deny their lies and end the suffering

An oppression, unheard of before
Smoke screened by the media
People are killing and dying
Innocent's blood for the promised land

The hatred is being kindled
by inadequate or no education at all
Homes destroyed and children crying
To fulfill the rotten promises

Bloodshed in Eden
With the blessings of the powerful
Apathy and indifference
Can't you hear the screaming victims?

A puppet government in action,
positioned to muffle the voices of the small
Bending over to any of it's masters wills
So they can sate their greedy appetites

Denial of the basic human rights
No comment by the keepers of the zoo
Impoverished and war torn civilians
At their last threads of this breaking rope

Bloodshed in Eden
With the blessings of the powerful
Apathy and indifference
Can't you hear the screaming victims?

Where is your right to enslave and murder?
Where is your right to destroy and burn down?
You have no right to harass and steal away
You have no right for this land to seize
