World of dogs, dogs of war
unleash terror upon the world
Crimes of hate, crimes of state
Violent rage, medieval age

9/11 was a lie, In 9/11 people died
Riddles of terror, the truth is a lie
Economy dies, dead will arise

Nuclear destruction
Is justice served?
What is the prize?
Black gold, black death
Imperialism in action
A world of hell

World of dogs, dogs of war
unleash terror upon the world
Your hunger for war, reveals the truth
Fuck your liberty, crazy fool

Morality's gone, shame no more
Napalm bombs, tanks of gold
Innocence died. fired to death
A new world order
with armies of hell

Nuclear destruction
Is justice served?
What is the prize?
Black gold, black death
A warfare for profit
A world of hell

Demons riding eagles fly above our heads
Bringing mass destruction in order to defend
Murderers, murderers... DEATH
