You're my fear, deep in my mind
You are here, you spy on me
You stare at me, you burn my soul
Marked my skin eternally
Flames are burning my inner-self
I cry in pain
I can't escape my fate
My life's in vein

But listen carefully, evil speaks through my ring
Words of darkness, he whispers like a snake 
"Only death you'll find 
in my Terra Infernal"

Riddles in the dark, questions of life... The pain from the inside 
Blinded by dust, I can't see the light... I've got to fight 
Horrible dreams, come back again... They're calling again and again 
Tired...
I have to find 
the courage, the strength 
to set me free from all the fear

Frustrated... Deranged from pain
Haunted... By deadly souls
Endless nights, endless dreams
Above my head horrid screams

A shadow just behind me, a tainted sense of fear
I feel his breath inside me, blight is drawing near
I walk through barren wastelands, malicious morbid plains 
Anxiety overwhelms me, (it's) driving me insane

I stand alone... 
I now walk in the shadow between worlds
It's there where I cleanse my soul 
(in my Terra Infernal)

My land, my friends, I left behind... Far away... Far away
In the darkest hours, in my despair... (Please) stay by my side
For freedom and peace, I'll fight till the end... Till the end, I'll try 
Drained...
I have to find
the courage, the strength 
to set me free from all the fear
