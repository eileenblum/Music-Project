Feed your greedy self
Feed your fake desires
Isolate yourself
You're the biggest liar

You want things you don't need
You watch things, you don't feel

(They) manipulate your mind
Your brain is wired
Your head is refined
You're trained to desire

Live your life in your shell, for yourself it's right
Count your days till your death, till your death you lie
Live your life in this hell, in this hell you'll die
Count your coins till your death, till your death you strive

Drown yourself in a sea of money
Choke yourself again to death with power
Sell yourself again, empty your mind
Live your cruel life and rot in the ground

Dehumanize
Demoralize
Consume your life
and pay the price

You want things you don't need
You watch things you don't feel

Use your labour power
(to) fetishize commodities
Irrational conformity
Lose your identity

My little Pavlov's dog

Trained to fantasize
(You think) you're free to idealize
Wag your tail to the right
Take a bow and hide
