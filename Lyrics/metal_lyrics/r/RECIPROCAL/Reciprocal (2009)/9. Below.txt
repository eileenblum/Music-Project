From below the permafrost of the arctic region
Lie species unknown
Since the cryogenian period
Eight-hundred million years to be unleashed

Immersed continually within the glacial mass
Mankind extenuates the anguish of their habitat
The warming of the globe will emancipate
An apocalyptic inevitable fate

Enormous, vastly exceeding the traits of extant life
Winged beast navigating through water, air, or land
No escape, predatory nature will eradicate
Removal, seek and destroy all living entities

Ice cores decrystalize, cleansing native life
Discharging archaic malignant reptilia
By design, enshrined for this rightful time
Now liberated, they ruthlessly
Cleanse the populace

Colonies of ancient life descending from the skies
Grasping mounds of earthly flesh, and tearing to shreds
Screams go unheard, their bellowing overwhelms
For fifty thousand years, they dominate the earth

An epoch of doom, cataclysmic degree
Until a new age of frozen earth
Waters and mass begin to congeal
Frostbite disseminates
Existence now null

Change in earth s atmosphere
Gas levels drop
Continents shift with force
Polar seas rise Earth s orbit alternates
Sunlight decline

Output, diminishing
Sunspots convect
Volcanoes, blanketing
Earth with aerosol
Globalized extinction
The cryptid beast Once again preserved to terminate
