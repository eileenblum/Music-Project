The divine power in nature emanating from the holy deity
Various roles in destructing a universe of imploding moons
Becomes a region of space surrounding the bodies on earth
Annihilating the frail and weak

There will be
Only immortals surpass the eliminating ritual of the one lord
No one left

The oblation of humankind seems to subside

Bindings made of mortal flesh
Aeons of ruination
Inscriptions of the avatar
Planets burn in sight of his holy tome
Shredding faces melting skin
Centuries of scorching skulls
The pleasure of dying is merely lost
In timeless agony
Orbiting endlessly burn

Recreation of the throne
Established dominion over nature
Conquering victoriously

The central body known to provide the light
Sphere of hydrogen and helium aeons away
Nuclear fusion reactions in the interior
Explodes and approaches the earth
Humanity now in extinction
The alien realm is decreeing
Cloning beings for experimentation
Torturing the unborn fetus of dehumanization

The invasion
Annexing territory
Seizing terrain
All ends 

The divine power in nature emanating from the holy deity
Various roles in destructing a universe of imploding moons
Becomes a region of space surrounding the bodies on earth
Annihilating the frail and weak

The central body known to provide the light
Sphere of hydrogen and helium aeons away
Nuclear fusion reactions in the interior
Explodes and approaches the earth
Humanity now in extinction
The alien realm is decreeing
Cloning beings for experimentation
Torturing the unborn fetus of dehumanization
