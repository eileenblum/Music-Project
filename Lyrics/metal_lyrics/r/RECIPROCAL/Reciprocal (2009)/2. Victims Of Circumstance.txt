Annihilate omnipotent gods, omniscient gods, omnipresent gods
Vindicate, eradicate faith, irrational ways, primitive creeds, lack of evidence

Immaculate culture will be displaced for animosity
Obtuse faith overrides human nature as we know it
Cancer disperses across undivided boundaries
Converting feeble minds, desolating interference

Pestilence advances overseas
All-encompassing creatural existence
Succumb to the threat of their requisition
Or depart from the flesh you have redeemed

Enslavement, killing, land theft, blood is on their hands
If they meet defiance, all must be dispersed or destroyed
Ultimatum be their final plea, truce and become obsolete
Behold technology that has the power to erase you

Harmonious civilization deceived to aid them in their wars
Once they gain supremacy, their aid will be aspersed, raped, and pillaged

Force-marched at gunpoint to new land
Those who fight brutally killed without sympathy
Children torn from their mother s arms
By their limbs, bash their head onto rocks, left for dead
In sub-zero temperatures
Suffering endlessly without fire or shelter
Pneumonia begins to set in
Organs shut down and skin turning blue, respiratory system shuts down

Seven thousand soldiers march through breaking down doors
Dragging them to stockades dead or alive

My friends circumstance renders it impossible
that you can flourish in a civilized community 
[General Andrew Jackson]

On the trails is the stench of death Savages unable to move on, left for dead
Ninety percent meet their demise Exposure, froze to death, starvation, and
disease Like cattle herded to their graves Helpless men, women, and children
die, forsaken Afterlife, your only hope to Escape the torturous treatment of
your brothers As one they depart We will extirpate
