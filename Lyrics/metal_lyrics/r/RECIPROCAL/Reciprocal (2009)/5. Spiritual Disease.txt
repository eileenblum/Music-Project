In order to survive infectious agents
Call for a direct path from one host to another
Faithful propagandists of the spiritual ailment
Deceitfully convey their viral devotion
Noxious, numinous calamity
Spoiling, erosion of our instincts
Blindly accepted by the infirm
Widespread, our species is polluted

A sacred contagion, void of resolution

Extreme morbidity
Mortality wrought by men
Abort the parasite
Disingenuous promises of afterlife

Broken down, you flee from the very essence of existence
Strain to discover the purpose of desire
Confined to commandments of restraint
Dogmatic, spiritually transmitted disease

Guided to institutions
Ignorance and fear their motivation
Fantasy stamped in their heads
Now they wait anxiously for their own death

They want to spread the pestilent disease that they ve received
Rapidly amongst the weak in heart, the weak in mind
Deep into the nothingness of blind faith and false truth
Prophecy, the end is near, symptoms of fear infect

The misery in which they dwell manifests

Impairment of the natural state and functioning of the mind
Producing severe symptoms that create emotional ruin

Idolize stone and wooden fomites
Vilify obvious reasoning

Broken down, you flee from the very essence of existence
Strain to discover the purpose of desire
Confined to commandments of restraint
Dogmatic, spiritually transmitted disease

Metaphysical forces control
The deeds of the tainted sheep with no souls
Obstinately, they forever bleed
Religiously dead
