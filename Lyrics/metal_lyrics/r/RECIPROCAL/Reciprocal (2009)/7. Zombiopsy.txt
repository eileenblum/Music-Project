Flailing limbs restrained, clamps and chains
Force the oddities down
Captured by the only survivors left to take control
Abused, tortured, defiled, and erased
Transformed into living dead

We are the dominant beings, we are the legends
Lets wipe our land clear of this bacterial infection
Blood coagulated of the walking corpse
A battle, a challenge, a plague

Dissect the rotten tissue of the face
Hack away and sever limbs
Forcefully saw deep into the skull
To determine existence of defect

The incision occurs, needle aspiration will not suffice
Remains of epidermal layers ripped through twice
Cuts, tears, eternal hacking
Their wounds will never heal
As we perform this
Uncontrolled extreme chaotic zombiopsy

Once they are slain, their bodies are gathered
Into an enormous liquefier
Blended to chunks, shredded to bits
We will wipe the earth clear of this

We know their intent, we know how they strive
Future outbreaks will never survive
With one need, feasting creatures
These beasts have no psychological features

Hack away and sever limbs
Forcefully saw deep into the skull
To determine existence of defect

Run! Run! Run! Run!
Your time has come
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Or join us in our ritual
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Bow down before your masters
Run! Run! Run! Run!
You will be left for consuming
Run
