Rape, murder, hatred
Anger annihilates
Flood, famine, starvation
Disasters that devastate
Lustful, immoral, vengeful
Prideful brutality
Gluttonous, envious, avarice
Foreseen in the prophecy

Your lord, your god, master of all creation
Your hope, your love, your light of all salvation
You pray in vain, each day the pain is strengthened
Evil revealed, he is the face of Satan

Revelations, Christians behold!

For our seven sins, darkness descends upon us
It brought fourth seven plagues
The bowls of wrath will end our days

Witness the wickedness of god
Baptized the angels in their blood
Cleansing of Christians in their blood

Raptured from earth, the prophets promissed passage
Betrayed from birth, left by the one you worship
Suffer the same through this great tribulation
Now curse his name through revelations living hell

Unforgiving lord of warfare brought us plague
End of all existence, pestilence now reigns
Punishment
Execution of the living taking place
Brink of our extinction, ending human race
Face judgment
Unrepentant serpent, spiritually diseased
Satan, dragon, free to lead the sheep astray
Damnation
Eternal lord, immortal saviors wrath
Armageddon, apocalyptic scriptures path

Who will not fear thee, O lord, and bring glory to thy name
For thou alone art holy. All nations will come to worship before you,
For thy righteous judgments have been revealed. 
[Revelations 15:4]
