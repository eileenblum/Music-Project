Lied to at birth, deceived by your masters
You must pray to his holiness
Or live a disastrous life
And rot in hell forever

Living, unquestioning, pray every night
Hoping one day you ll see the light
At the end of the tunnel, will he wait?
He waits, he excruciates

When loved ones are dying, where is god?
When the body is failing, where is god?
When angels are crying, where is god?
Where is he now?

Drowning in self-despair
Wandering aimlessly in a helpless void
Desperately roving the blackest lands
Can t wash the blood from your hands
Can t take away the pain

You wait alone in the absence of light
Darkness descends upon all hope of life
Mentally drained and physically frail
Feeling you have failed

Sinners will not be forgiven
No practice can alter his decision
The dark god will rise and complete his vision
Cherish the life you have been given

Waiting alone in the absence of light
Darkness descends upon all hope of life
Mentally drained and physically frail
Inevitably, you ve failed

Waiting alone in the absence of light
Darkness descends upon all hope of life
Mentally drained and physically frail
Inevitably, you ve failed

When loved ones are dying, where is god?
When the body is failing, where is god?
When angels are crying, where is god?
Where is he now?

Worthless you are as the world is falling
