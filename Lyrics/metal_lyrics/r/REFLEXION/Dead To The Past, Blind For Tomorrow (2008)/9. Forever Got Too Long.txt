You are locked inside my heart
I touch your face and wonder why we got lost
It's been such a long time since we've been like this
Together dreaming of the times we had

Save this for the one last time, for our sake
I'll pray until you're ready to trust your fate

Those times were just too tough
We have to remember that we are the ones without love
It will break me apart
If you don't give me one more night
But now we are just hoping for, praying for
Waiting for better times

Save this for the one last time, for our sake
I'll pray until you're ready to trust your fate

I know it could've been much more
Why did we let it go?
I remember we swore an oath, but forever got too long

Save this for the one last time, for our sake
I'll pray until you're ready to trust your fate
