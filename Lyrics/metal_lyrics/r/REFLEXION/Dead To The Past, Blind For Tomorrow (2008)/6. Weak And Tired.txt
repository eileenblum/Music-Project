Look out, here it is again
The master of pain and pleasure
Wake up or you will go insane
It's the art that we used to call love

It's waiting, graving
Something that makes you feel loved
It's bleeding and dreaming
Searching for the reason to go on

I know that your heart is always on fire
You're losing yourself to desire
Your body is weak and so tired
And you are ready to die for this love

When you get lost
things will never be the same
You will carry the shadow of broken soul

"The less I care the less I cry"
You said and now your eyes
Are smiling but your soul is dead

It's waiting, graving
Something that makes you feel loved
It's bleeding and dreaming
Searching for the reason to go on

I know that your heart is always on fire
You're losing yourself to desire
Your body is weak and so tired
And you are ready to die for this love

Is it the pain you feel, that makes your world more real?
Was it the perfect sin that murdered your only dream?
In sickness and in death, no memories, no regret
Until life do us apart

I know that your heart is always on fire
You're losing yourself to desire
Your body is weak and so tired
And you are ready to die for this love
