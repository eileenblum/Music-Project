Destiny guided me through the valley of fallen souls
But without you I'll be dead before the dawn

The whole wide world is behind my door
The dancing rats on my bedroom floor
I'm so tired again so I think I'll stay at home

It's you who made my world untrue

All I do, I do for you
My heart is dead without you
Don't kill me by saying we're through
My heart is dead without you

You have taken all I've got
My home, my heart and my soul
Yes I know I'm losing it
But here I am still begging for more
...I'm in love with you

All I do, I do for you
My heart is dead without you
Don't kill me by saying we're through
My heart is dead without you
