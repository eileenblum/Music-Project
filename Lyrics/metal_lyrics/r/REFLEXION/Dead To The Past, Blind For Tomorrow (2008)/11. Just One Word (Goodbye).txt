It seems to be the end of the world
To see you walking out of that door
Not one tear did you cry, just one word: 'goodbye'

I wake up every single night
To feed the snakes that are sleeping with me
I see spiders crawling everywhere
I'll take these pills and go back to my bed

I'm so broken. My legs are numb and my eyes are aching
I'm so broken and now I know
How it feels to be all alone

I think I've found my way back home
I think I know who I can trust no more
I fail to see your lies

I'm so broken. My legs are numb and my eyes are aching
I'm so broken and now I know
How it feels to be all alone


Thanks to "Ber" soulrelic for correcting track #5 lyrics.
