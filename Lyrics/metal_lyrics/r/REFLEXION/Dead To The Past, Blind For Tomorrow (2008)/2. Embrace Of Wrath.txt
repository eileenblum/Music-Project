In to the black and then back home
In the dark I love to roam
Oh can't you see that I want to be alone?
My glass heart has been numb for so long

Can't you see, can't you feel, there's no hope in here
In the dark, all alone we all live
I believe in the dark (and) you have to trust in me
In the end it's the only way to be free

I'm not the one to wake you up
From the stupid dream that you wanna love
Oh, can't you see that we are in dark, want it or not
Why don't you accept that you broke apart long ago (so long ago)

Can't you see, can't you feel, there's no hope in here
In the dark, all alone we all live
I believe in the dark (and) you have to trust in me
In the end it's the only way to be free

Blessed by this world of self-pity and greed
In the calm embrace of wrath
Living in eternal desolation
The faked salvation grows inside of you
like a fucking disease
Is there too much to see?

Can't you see, can't you feel, there's no hope in here
In the dark, all alone we all live
I believe in the dark (and) you have to trust in me
In the end it's the only way to be free
