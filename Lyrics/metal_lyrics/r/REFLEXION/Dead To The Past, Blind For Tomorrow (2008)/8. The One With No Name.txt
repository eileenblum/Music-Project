Waiting for the fallen one
Undress the soul for those who rape it
Drink the blood of a saint to save the dawn

Celebrating the pain
For seven years I've dragged along
A sadness that will never let me go

Now the wounded skin
Is burning from within
I can't believe I'm done

I fall in my dreams, forget all that's real
I am the one with no name
I've lost my fears, trust and believe
I am the one with no name

I don't need to hold on
If there's nothing more to say
I don't need your rainy face to prove me wrong

Drowning in the sea
Of bitterness and fear
I can't believe I'm done

I fall in my dreams, forget all that's real
I am the one with no name
I've lost my fears, trust and believe
I am the one with no name
