In your beautiful dress you were standing in front of me
There was sun in your eyes and for a little while
You made heaven come alive
You wore flowers on your head (and)
Your hair was shining
Nothing could murder us now
But again I could not be more wrong

Heaven was you and it made me come alive
But I don't believe in things that make me dead inside
The heaven in me was a lie

When the storm arrived it started raining
Behind the white veil I saw you crying
And the clouds went dark
Before my heaven came crashing down
I saw your beautiful dress painted with blood
And it ripped me apart like a thousand nails in my heart

Heaven was you and it made me come alive
But I don't believe in things that make me dead inside
The heaven in me was a lie

I can still feel you by my side
In the fading shadows I see your smile

Heaven was you and it made me come alive
But I don't believe in things that make me dead inside
The heaven in me was a lie
