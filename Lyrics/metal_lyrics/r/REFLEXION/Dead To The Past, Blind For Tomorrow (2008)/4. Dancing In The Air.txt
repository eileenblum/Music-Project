The parade of snakes in your bed
The disco of lizards in your head
The fraction of beauty in total regret
The fiction of joy when hope is dead

You think you're not gonna fall
If you just go with the flow
But you are so wrong
Your life is just a joke

It's a calling of those lonely days
That echo in your mind
A whisper in the dark
"That's all it's time to go"

A crown of thorns on your head
A modern Jesus without the grace
A gown of a martyr and the world unfair
The kiss of Judas and the last debate

You think you're not gonna fall
If you just go with the flow
But you are so wrong
Your life is just a joke

It's a calling of those lonely days
That echo in your mind
A whisper in the dark
"That's all it's time to go"

See you dancing in the air
It's written in your fate
When too much is not enough
It's the bullet in your head
