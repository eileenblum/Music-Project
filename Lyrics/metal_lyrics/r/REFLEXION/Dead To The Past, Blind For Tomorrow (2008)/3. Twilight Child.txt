Touch the moon and walk on seas
Bless the one who's born from tears
Let me be, set me free

Walk the path you think is right
Take over the world, it's your time
Let me be, set me free

By giving your heart and soul
The night will lead your way
By reading the signs from the stars
You'll find a place to stay
Let the night lead your way

When it feels there's no turning back
You will defeat the curse they cast
Then you're free eternally

By giving your heart and soul
The night will lead your way
By reading the signs from the stars
You'll find a place to stay
Let the night lead your way

When the storm comes and rain beats your face
Spread your hands and smile

By giving your heart and soul
The night will lead your way
By reading the signs from the stars
You'll find a place to stay
Let the night lead your way
