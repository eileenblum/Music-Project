Black nails, black hair, black lips
And your deep black dress
Black mind, black tears, black is
The colour of your life

The heartless never cries
The painless never dies
"These wings will keep me up"
"They will never let me down"
"They'll carry me through the day"
All of your life you've waited for
Someone to take you back home

Oh, how you've waited for someone
To take you back home
Oh, how you've waited for someone
Who brings back the the colours of your life

It follows you, days and nights
Makes you lose your mind
It brings tears into your eyes
All of your life you've waited for someone
To take you back home

Oh, how you've waited for someone
To take you back home
Oh, how you've waited for someone
Who brings back the the colours of your life
