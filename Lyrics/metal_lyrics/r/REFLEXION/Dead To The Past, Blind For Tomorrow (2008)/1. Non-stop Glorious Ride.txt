Last time I walked alone was the last day of my life
I walked so far away and the new dawn never arose
It makes me feel like I have seen this all before
This was enough to carry on with, nothing more

I'm hanging myself once again
and waiting for this fall to end

My broken and beaten body
Is waiting to be born again
My shallow mind blows
All the deep thoughts away
(I'm falling high)

I turned a new page to get back in this so called life
I haven't touch these dusty pages for a while
This time I went too far and I went just way too high
But I will take myself for a non-stop glorious ride

I'm hanging myself once again
and waiting for this fall to end

My broken and beaten body
Is waiting to be born again
My shallow mind blows
All the deep thoughts away
(I'm falling high)

Eye for an eye, word from a word
Everyone knows it won't hurt
Too high a price for you to pay
From my own life and my mistake
