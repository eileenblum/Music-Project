Memories running through your head
Alone and afraid there's monster under your bed
Waiting for him to come home

The strangest feeling when darkness surrounds your mind
Screaming pain when you turn out to be right
The sad story again, leaves you nothing but pain, all in vain

Storm in your heart, it tears you apart
For so long you have wandered in dark
To find out the one who won't let you down

Put your heart, back in the game
And you will lose it all over again
It's always the same, nothing but pain, all in vain

Storm in your heart it tears you apart
For so long you have wandered in dark
To find out the one who won't let you down
