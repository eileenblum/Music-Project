Gone too fast, gone too far
A dead end! "Got back to the start"
Away from the light towards the dark
Ready to lose it all

Rainheart, rainheart
Nothing to hold on, no one to trust
Waiting for someone to save you from the dark

Too lost to hide, too sad to cry
Led by the whisper of the night
Screaming pain! It follows you
Blood red pain! It covers your heart

Rainheart, rainheart
Nothing to hold, no one to trust
Waiting for someone to save you from the dark
Rainheart, rainheart
Deeper and deeper into the night
Give me your hand before you fall apart
