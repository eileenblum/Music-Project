The slashing pain of truth unveiled
So bittersweet (still) it's killing me
Cold is the diving blade of love
You hold the keys to my heart

One and a million times
I've tried to forget you
One and a million times
I've cried for you

Torturing grace from cradle to grave
The leaves of my life slowly turning grey
Cold is the diving blade of love
Closed is the gate to my heart
