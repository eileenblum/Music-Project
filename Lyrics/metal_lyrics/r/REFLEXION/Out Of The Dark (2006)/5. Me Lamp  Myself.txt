Welcome in, but I hope you stay out,
Please come back when I'm not around.
I think this place is way too small for both of us.

Don't keep me near, but just close enough,
Gain my trust before you take me down.
Weak is the mind when you change your heart to greed and lust.

[Bridge:]
Where goes the pain with you and me?
Was there difference, there's no one to believe.

[Chorus:]
It's in our head, the sick selfishness,
Me &amp; myself, forget all the rest.
I'm the spineless one, with holy creed in heart,
A way of life, always can survive.

Once you've gone in, there's only one way out.
Another soul, and I'll be drained of life.
Searching for someone, who cares enough to lead me out.

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
