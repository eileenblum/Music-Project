Her face so white and pale, she's sleeping with death
Her eyes like mirrors of pain

Lost her will to try
Rather stays in bed
Counting her last days

The beautiful smile is wiped away
No one answers when she prays
The same thought inside her head:
"Please let me be or take me away"

Mother cries beside her bed
Where is God when I need His help?
The life of her child is fading away

The time is running out, the end is near
It's time for her last wish
Hand on her heart her mother swears: "I'll do anything"
But she's already speaking to herself

Now beautiful life is wiped away
No more questions no more prayers
No grief in her eyes just a peaceful gaze
The end of her earthly days

Mother cries beside her bed
There is no god, no one who helps
The flame of her life has faded away
Now she is sleeping with no pain
An innocent mind without a stain
The line of her life has faded away
