Wash away all the weakness
Feeble soul will rise and bloom

When the dark descends
The seducing torment of pain
Wakes the spirit untamed
Tonight there's nothing to lose

Burn in the flames of unpredictable truth
Or share the trail of everlasting gloom

The lonesome one in the arms of darkness
The ray of light that hurts like hell

Once the feast begins
There is no simples truth
And the light of day
Ruins the glory of rain
