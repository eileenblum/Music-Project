Alone in my bed, thinking of you
Your beautiful smile turned out to be faked and cruel
Turned out to be faked and cruel...
Shape of angel nothing inside
I was blinded by the gaze in your eyes
A gaze in your eye.. it's gone!

[Chorus:]
Crashing down
From way too high
No more tears left to cry
I thought we're born to share this life
Another victim of your lies

It's here and now, the moment of truth
No more lies, no angel misguide
No angel misguide..
Touch so cold, it broke my heart
I am just another victim of your lie
Victim of your lie..

I'm losing my mind
Losing my will to live
My strength to carry on
How I lust, for this love
It's gone

[Chorus:]
Crashing down
From way too high
No more tears left to cry
I thought we're born to share this life
Another victim of your lies

No tears left to cry..
