The rising sun
Above the sleeping ground
It shines so bright
It hurts my dying eyes
Beautiful sun reminds me of you
That I'm the one in dark
I'm so lost when we're apart oh

[Chorus:]
Don't get me wrong when I say, "I'm the child in dark"
You make me strong 'cause you bring the sun in my heart
Wherever you are is my heart

Changing view
Frozen fields and morning moon
Page 62 takes me back to you
Sparing the sky crimson and blue
Soon my craving is through
I'm so lost when we're apart

[Chorus:]
Don't get me wrong when I say, "I'm the child in dark"
You make me strong 'cause you bring the sun in my heart
Wherever you are is my heart

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Don't get me wrong when I say, "I'm the child in dark"
You make me strong 'cause you bring the sun in my heart
Don't get me wrong when I say, "I'm the child in dark"
You keep me strong if you share the light in your heart
I hope you remember forever you are is my heart
