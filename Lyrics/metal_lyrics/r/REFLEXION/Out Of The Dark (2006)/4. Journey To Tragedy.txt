Born with a dream
Raised by the shadows of destiny
Taught by strange beliefs
Loved only by a sad melody

So it begins, a journey to tragedy
The further we get the deeper we sink
All alone with no helping hand

He's not himself any longer
Nothing can make him stronger

The constant betrayal in the back of his mind
All along the way
Bought and sold for a dime
For the hundredth time
Everything and nothing remains the same

Lost along the way, trails only led him astray
Only the moment of fame drove him insane
All his life became inane

The tragedy
The destiny
This is my dream
