Roaming the sea of this hateful lies,
Made my religion from your eyes,
Possessed by the Siren's song now,
A bed of razors waiting for you.

Only thing you can give me is sorrow,
You will bathe in my tears tomorrow.
Voices screaming "No" in my head,
But lust is going to your bed.

[Chorus]
So if I close my eyes,
And let you rule my heart,
Will it haunt the suffocating pain?

Wearing the mask of eternal gloom,
Tell me one who has met you is *** [?]
Tell me all the grief in your life,
And I will give you endless love, oh...

Maybe it hurts me,
Maybe it kills me,
Maybe it drowns me, but I just want to try
Joining your army of broken hearts !

[Chorus:]
So if I close my eyes,
And let you rule my heart,
Will it haunt the suffocating pain?
So if I close my eyes,
And let you tear of these scars,
It's the only way you can feel alive.

Because I want you to feel,
Devotion that is real.
You need to unleash,
All the hurt and pain that is bringing you down.

[Chorus:]
So if I close my eyes,
And let you rule my heart,
Will it haunt the suffocating pain?
So if I close my eyes,
And let you tear of these scars,
It's the only way you can feel alive.
