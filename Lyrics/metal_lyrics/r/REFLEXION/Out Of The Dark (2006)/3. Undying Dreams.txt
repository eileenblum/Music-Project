Seize the passing while,
Run as far as you can go.
Does the whirl of wind,
Fly, and hope you never fall?
You won't fall.

[Bridge:]
Never lose your home,
When the world gets painful and cold
Undying dreams can fall,
If you turn your back to the hope.

Let the darkness raid your soul..

[Chorus:]
All the millions of dreams that you got,
Are wipe away with no meaning..
Those thousands of hearts that you broke.
Are crush now, no feeling..

Despise the one who cares,
Hate the one who tries to help..
Tries to help..

The pain, becomes your bliss,
When you rely on truth that doesn't exist,
It doesn't exist..

[Bridge:]
Now you have lost your home,
And the one that loved you the most,
Undying dreams are gone,
And your heart is cold like stone,
And you still end up alone.

[Chorus:]
All the millions of dreams that you got,
Are wiped away with no meaning..
Those thousands of hearts that you broke.
Are crushed without a feeling..
You cant hurl the scars when you're strong,
They will haunt you 'cause you're still bleeding,
You're taking this way too far,
Let this show unveil..

Pain, is there, and you have sacrificed it all,
Everything that matters the most...

[Chorus]
