Inside the mausoleum a sour body, assembled is the coven for gluttony
Opening the casket disgusting horrid sight, feast can now begin necrovorous rite
Ripped up gutter, a stench most foul
Morbid pleasure, the disembowel
Tapping the black blood, drinking iron wine
Dead you fill your purpose, human swine
Devouring the innards, feast on rotting sore
Stinking corpse for eating, feeding on the gore
The grizzly ritual, will now proceed
Body dismembered, through cannibal greed
Bloody limbs are scattered, a smelly pile
Dead one torn asunder ,an act most vile
Devouring the innards, feast on rotting sore
Stinking corpse for eating, feeding on the gore
Eating from a coffin - Eating from a grave - Eating from a coffin -
Eating from a grave
Rancid decay, pouring out from the sockets
Fancied dismay, sticky fingers into rear pockets
Molestation frenzy, excreting the skeletal remains
Rabid faces eerie, smeared in clotted moshed brains
Coffin stained with dirt, stinking gory soil
Chewed off stumps into the cauldron for the boil
Fed are now the ghouls, and the crones
Consumed is the corpse, burnt are the bones
Devouring the innards,feast on rotting sore
Stinking corpse for eating, feeding on the gore
Eating from a coffin - Eating from a grave - Eating from a coffin -
Eating from a grave
