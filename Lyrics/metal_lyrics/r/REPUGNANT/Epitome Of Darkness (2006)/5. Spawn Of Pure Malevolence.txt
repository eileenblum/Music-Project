I have come from burning, through freezing seed
Through ejaculation fires, born as infamous breed
Votary of the precipice divinity, defiling the heavenly sterility
Baptized in blood from being born in blasphemy eternal darkness inside of me

Spawn of pure malevolence - Spawn of pure malevolence -
Spawn of pure malevolence - Spawn of pure malevolence

Viewing the world from a far distant tomb, aiming as the gate through the womb
Chosen bodies appear so vicious, my rabid fury unearthly malicious
Consuming your veins, molesting internally your body into excrutiating pains
Putting you into maggot lave, underneath the cenotaph
Tormenting you beyond the grave

Spawn of pure malevolence - Spawn of pure malevolence -
Spawn of pure malevolence - Spawn of pure malevolence
