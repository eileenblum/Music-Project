Exhumation of a tomb, evil haunted catacomb
Rotten corpse covered in dust, drained arteries in rust
Bring a saw cut off an arm, necrophilia was its charm
Molestation of the dead, fucking with a cut-off head
Smell the decomposed stiff, erosion of life
God awful horrid sniff, strikes as lethal strife
Urge to fulfill and ever needed thrill, a sinful corpse to obey my will
Copulation with the deceased, genital bacteria has sure increased
Gluttony unto what remain, ravage unto feebles grain
Blasphemy to fuck the dead, sanity the inner voices said
Whispers inside my brain, telling me to cure the pain
Your remnants so unpure, jailed to putrefaction you're...
Draped in cerecloth - raped in sepulchral rot
Draped in cerecloth - raped in sepulchral rot
Compulsion controls my mind unspeakable inclinations behind dismemberment of the late eye to eye with certain fate
Smell the decomposed stiff, erosion of life
God awful horrid sniff, strikes as lethal strife
Exhumation of a tomb, evil haunted catacomb
Rotten corpse covered in dust, drained arteries in rust
Bring a saw cut off an arm, necrophilia has its charm
Molestation of the dead, fucking with a cut-off head
Voices inside my brain, telling me to cure the pain
Your remnants so unpure, jailed to putrefaction you're... Draped in
cerecloth - raped in sepulchral rot
Draped in cerecloth - raped in sepulchral rot
