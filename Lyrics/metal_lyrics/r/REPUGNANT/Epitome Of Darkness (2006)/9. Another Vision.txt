[originally by Morbid]In the dead of night
Crawling in my sleep
My soul [?] [?] fright ?
Vision from the deep
Tear up my subconscious ?
Haunted by premonition
Tearing into my brain
Struck by
What is happening to me
Infernal death is all
I see
Another vision of misery
Darkness for journey ?
What is tormenting me
Infernal pain is all
I feel
This nightmare is too real
Another vision [4x]
Falling into coma
Motions are all lost
Inner self torn to pieces
Share my soul [?]
Tear up my subconscious ?
Haunted by premonition
Tearing into my brain
Struck by
Another vision [4x]
I can see it stronger now ?
Living is to be astray ? [?] is the key to death [?] to get away
Their reach is beyond control ? [?] to terminal condition ?
Feel my life is faiding
Slipping to my vision
In the dead of night
Crawling in my sleep
My soul [?] [?] fright
Vision from the deep
Tear up my subconscious ?
Haunted by premonition
Tearing into my brain
Struck by
Another vision [4x]
