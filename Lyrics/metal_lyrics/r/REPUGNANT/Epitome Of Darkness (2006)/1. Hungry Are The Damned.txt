Denounced myself from the god of the light
Drank the blood of eternal life and darkness might
Serving him with cloven hoves thus I infest
Demands of his infernal majesties request

After midnight I excel poisoned by the lye of hell - rise again to bathe in crust dwelling in perverted lust the likes of me are taking over rage across the landbeastly ones are in command......
And hungry are the damned
Nosferatu inside of you - Nosferatu inside of you and me

Bloodlust drives me to kill again
You all will die from the terror of my reign Discarded corpses dried of life left as trace
Behold my fangs as they sink into your fucking face

After midnight I excel poisoned by the lye of hell - rise again to bathe in crust dwelling in perverted lust - the likes of me are taking over rage across the land - beastly ones are in command...

Up from a shallow grave clotted blood is what I crave
An apex predator always hungry for more, slit your throat and you'll see
Reborn in morbidity ...just like me
Ghastly proceeds the funeral procession
What once was hidden is now at hand vastly exceeds the global recession-
We're all smitten so we are the damned

Nosferatu inside of you - Nosferatu inside of you and me
After midnight I excel poisoned by the lye of hell - rise again to bathe in crust dwelling in perverted lust - the likes of me are taking over rage across the land - beastly ones are in command......
And hungry are the damned
