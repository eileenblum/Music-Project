Dusk spreads over this cemetery, the ground appears deceased
Lifeless forms buts the sky, out here all life has ceased
Putrid odours rising, from beneath the ground
They climb up from the tombs, with a freezing horrid sound
From beyond the grave - from beyond the grave
Exquisite stench of death, insurrective resurrection
Arisen from the dirt, putrefactive infestation
Brought...back...from the dead
Lifeless...eyes...in their maggot infested heads...
Dusk spreads over this cemetery, the ground appears deceased
Lifeless forms buts the sky, out here all life has ceased
Putrid odours rising, from beneath the ground
They climb up from the tombs, with a freezing horrid sound from beyond the grave, from beyond the grave
Scum of the earth, obliquity in the creation awakened by mistake, overdose of radiation
Terminal deadforms unleashed, in a morbid re-animation
Accidentally unearthed, its evils resuscitation
Scum of the earth, obliquity in the creation
Awakened by mistake, overdose of radiation
