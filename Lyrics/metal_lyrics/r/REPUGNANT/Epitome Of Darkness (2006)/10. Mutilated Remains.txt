Condemned in the chapel, people their confide
Blind and superstitious, awaiting tyrannicide
Holy father ravaged, innocent is cursed
Hell awaits him now, victim of bloodthirst
Woman engulfed in flames, fiend blasphemy
Children to the slaughter, relentless massacre
Inverted are the crosses, vermin now emerge
Total are their losses, burning holy church
Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains
Continuing nightmare, horrid mayhem feast
Crucifixial rupture, in honour of the beast
Chapel deterioration, congregation of denial
Abomination of the perish, power of belial
Carcass steaming gas, intestinal poison stench
Repellant rigor mortis, nausea gutwrench
Mutilated limbs, rancid gore and lard
Excruciating view, this open air graveyard
Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains
Condemned in the chapel, people their confide
Blind and superstitious, awaiting tyrannicide
Holy father ravaged, innocent is cursed
Hell awaits him now, victim of bloodthirst
Woman engulfed in flames, fiend blasphemy
Children to the slaughter, relentless massacre
Inverted are the crosses, vermin now emerge
Total are their losses, burning holy church
Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains - Mutilated remains
