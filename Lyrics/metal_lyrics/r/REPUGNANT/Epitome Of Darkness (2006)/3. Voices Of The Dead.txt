Twisted priest possessed by hell
Tormented in evil sacrilege-
Confused spoken paranoia prophecies of zombies siege
Without control rotting brain veins infest in solemn rage
Haunted by the voices - tongues speaks of carnage
In the morgue, in the cemeteries, in the eyes of the dead and the dying
Reflecting mankind's future doom - as whispered in their sighing
In your head deep within - they chant your worlds demise
Reckoning day of the opening lids - The hour all cadavers arise...
Voices of the dead - chanting inside your head
Resurrected ones living dead-see to it life destroyed
Voices breathe of sulphur putrescent reek of void
Sky turns black sweeping fog
As darkness takes its toll
Vengeful corpses now walk the earth
The dead has total control
Voices of the dead - chanting inside your head "when the earth spits out the dead they will return to tear the flesh from the living"
Voices of the dead - chanting inside your head...
