It feels like a knife
It feels like bathing in ice
It feels like dying; parts of me just did

And it hurts more than you know
Yes I'm hurt more than I'll show
Feel so harmed and broken, backstabbed and deceived

Didn't I see it falling apart?
Didn't I know it just got too hard?
But didn't we share this passion carved into our hearts?

We didn't know what more to do and saw it all just slip away
But underneath my pain it's pride that still burns
No one can ruin the years we had as one before we went astray
I will not forget!

I've lost the magic we shared
I've lost faith without despair
And I am losing so much more now that this ends

Breaking the chain that's holding you back
Breaking it all due to faith that you lack
I thought we fought all battles, but this can't ever be won

Behind the broken dream lies my heart
Behind my iron will I'm still hurt
Beyond my broken dreams lies my path
(I'm bleeding for the heart the truth has stabbed with frozen faith)
Behind the grand facade I break down
(I'm picking up the pieces of a heart that had blind faith)

I didn't know what more to do and saw it all just slip away
But underneath my pain it's hope that still burns
No one can ruin the years we had as one before we went astray
I'll never forget!
