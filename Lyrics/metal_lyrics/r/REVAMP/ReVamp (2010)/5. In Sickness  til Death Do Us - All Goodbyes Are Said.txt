[Patient:]
Let me go
Say all your goodbyes
Accept my death (as I did)
Inevitable for all life

[Mother:]
No! I can't! This comes way too soon!
How can I let go of you now?

[Patient:]
Goodbye, I'm free now!
Don't grieve! I'm gone, let me go!
My death meant peace for me!

[Patient:]
Let me go
But keep me alive
Within your heart (memories)
And promise me that I'll remain

[Mother:]
In my very soul you'll live on,
Even when I let go you're still there
A piece of myself will die with you, but let go, end your pain

[Patient:]
Feel no grief
Embrace salvation

My pain is gone
While yours goes on (just began)
But live your life (for me too)

Goodbye, I'm free now!
Don't grieve! I'm gone, let me go!
My death meant my peace
When all goodbyes are said
Farewell! This ends here!
Don't mourn. I'm free, let it go!
I found peace in my death
