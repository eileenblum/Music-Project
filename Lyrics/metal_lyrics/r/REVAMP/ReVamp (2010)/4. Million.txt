With one foot still in the past
With the other far ahead
(Million timelines
Million lifetimes)
In-between the times go fast
Chase your life while living it
(Keep track of your life
Live dreams, make them real)

A million words, I drown
In what I really try to say
In what I try to be today
(A million paths to a million choices)
It's an overwhelming prospect
Take a step back, time to reflect
(Keep track of your time, use it well; live your dreams)

A million words and fantasies
A million dreams and fallacies
I now know life goes fast
Hold on and be
This is you so dare to become yourself

With memories like scars
Or beautiful memories
Fighting inner wars
(A million senses a million notions)
The past can hurt and teach
With today within our reach
(And tomorrow's fears to breach)
