I need someone to blame!
Feel contempt and betrayed,
I am losing myself, my disdain takes control

Being useless is worst, I can't do shit!

Seeing your pain
It kills me
Losing you now,
I'm provoked
Useless I stand on the side
I would take your pain if I could

Is it God or the world, is there someone to blame?
Is it fate or bad luck, who is failing you now?

Infuriating how I'm forced to remain calm
Disdain!!!

Your pain became like hell to me
Your death; sad way to set you free
Disdained

Aggravation before acceptance
Scorn and hatred; a natural defence
Deepest misery before salvation
Godless suffering before redemption

Now my nightmare's proclaimed
I've found no one to blame
It's a cruel twist of life
Yet my rage can't be bound

Exasperating how trivial we really are
