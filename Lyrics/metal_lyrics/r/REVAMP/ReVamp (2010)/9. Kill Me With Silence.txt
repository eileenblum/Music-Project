You kill me with silence
Using its peace against me
No soothing words to ease my pain
I'm left with no compromise

Fake promises, empathy, smiles
I'm just a game to play, I lost

You're killing me
Silent strike
Silence bites
You burned all lies,
Ashes feed my revenge

You kill me with my own heart
Using my faith against me
The hard demise struck me
Left me with zilch, doubt and lies

Slay dreams
Kill them; devour my pride
I'm just a pawn to lose, disposable

You're killing me
Silent strike
Silence bites
You burned all lies,
Ashes feed my revenge
