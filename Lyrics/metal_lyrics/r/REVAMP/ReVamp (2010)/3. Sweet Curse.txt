It's a burden for wrong reasons
But I keep hold of this pain
No more tears but common sorrow
Yet it wears of day by day
Letting go; I never could but I surely need to heal
Sweet curse, my hell

You bare our memories like staining scars within your mind
You lose all that you knew of me, gone deep inside
Lost love, my hell

Sweet is the curse of hearts intwined but lost, detached but bound
Sad is their fate without relief
Cruel is the curse of love, so luscious yet so dangerous
Sweet curse, our hell

Words weren't made to tell this story
For I can't describe the ache
No remorse for your betrayal
Yet though I find that hard to take
How can beauty change unseen into a monster, I don't know
Lost love is my hell

Sweet is the curse of hearts intwined but lost, detached but bound
Sad is their fate without relief
Cruel is the curse of love, so luscious yet so dangerous
Sweet curse, our hell

Lost hope and lost dreams
Killing you slowly
New scars and new cravings take control
(New desire, new despair)

Losing you was more than I could bear
Losing us, a dive in water deep
Losing you
