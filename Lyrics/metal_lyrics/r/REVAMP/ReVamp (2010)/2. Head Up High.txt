Lust, love, lost
You need a mirror to see your true self
Lust, love, lost
I must be frightening to you
I'm your mirror.
Open up to me!

Head up high, my dear
Don't you let me in
You can't hide, my dear
Freeze me
Don't you let me in!

Hurt me now,
your words can never reach
my weakest spot.
Hurt me, why?
I must be frightening to you
I'm your muse now.
Open up to me.

Head up high, my dear
Don't you let me in
You can't hide my dear
Freeze Me
Don't you let me in
