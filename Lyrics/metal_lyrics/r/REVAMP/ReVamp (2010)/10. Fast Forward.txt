Stuck in today
Now I see time as an enemy
I can't be caught in wistful memories
Distance myself

Live in today
Should it be that hard to be like me
Can it be fear to be like someone I do not want to become
And all I see lies ahead

Fast forward today
Dreaming 'bout tomorrow
Past and present as one, can they entwine and color the time to come; my path?

Sick of today
Now I need my time to hurry up
Can it go faster, I am yearning for what's to come

Lost in today
Now I know that time is my enemy
I can't see hope, my course, my journey
It's just crushing me down

And time moves on
Guideless
Catch up with me
Dreams are there today!

Fast forward today
Dreaming 'bout tomorrow
Past and present as one; they are entwined
Fast forward today
Longing for tomorrow
Past and present as one; they are entwined to color the time to come; my path!
