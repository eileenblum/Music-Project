Loving you is poison to my heart
I'm free by losing you
Why was I blind?
Why did I try?

Loving you, no honey for the damned
I'm freed by breaking through
I have lead a way out

No heart, no shallow heart to love
I'm better off just by myself
No pain, no pain to torment me
I'm better off without this agony

Loving you is poison to my heart
I'm free by losing you
Why was I blind?
Why did I try?

Loving you, no honey for the damned
I'm freed by breaking through
I have lead a way out

No knife, no knife can cut me free
I'm better off without this heart
No fight, no fight will set me free
I'm better off without this love

Loving you is poison to my heart
I'm free by losing you
Why was I blind?
Why did I try?

Loving you, no honey for the damned
I'm freed by breaking through
I have lead a way out
