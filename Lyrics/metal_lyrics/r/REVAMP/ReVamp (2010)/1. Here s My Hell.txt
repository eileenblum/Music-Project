Eyes wide open
Still blind to see
Heart wide open
Still too cold to feel

That's all what's left of me
A frozen mind
A shade of who I could be
That's all I can be today

That's all I dare to see
With broken faith
Afraid of what's hurting me
That's all I'll let in today

In silence I cry
For my aching heart

Frozen
Closed down
Demons won't recede
Doubtful
Fearful
I must face them all

Eyes wide open
Do I dare to see?
Heart wide open
Do I dare to feel?

That's all I want to be
A stronger mind
A light that will make me see
That's all I wish for today

That's what will set me free
With renewed strength
I'll deal with my agony
That is my goal for today

Empty I cry
Where is my heart?

With eyes wide shut I smile and fake...
Hear the time, tick, tick, tick...
Let me try...
Here's my HELL!

Welcome to my pain, my wrath,my contempt
Where demons dwell
Welcome to my scorn, my fear, my disdain
Welcome to my personal hell
