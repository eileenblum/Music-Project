Once upon a time I was strong enough, I was me...
Once upon a time is long ago
Some things start the easy way; it feels good, no more to say
Some things hide so much behind that ease

You ask for more
You're under my skin
You push, I'm floored
This is a fight I'll never win
You bring me down
You're under my skin
Don't break me, no!

Some things change while I remain quite the same; doomed to linger
Some things change for better or for worse
Once upon a time comes back; I will too, I'll stand stronger
Once upon a time's a fairytale...

Once upon a time's today, I stand up, I'll stand strong now
Once upon a time's for yesterday
Some things end without a choice; it's not your call, no reprisal
Some things end too late for you to choose
