It's the truth against my heart or just my heart against it all. it's hard to tell.
it's my will against myself, my body failed to keep it up. it's hard to see.
But I couldn't bare my own state, couldn't bare the sight.
So I hid myself and stood strong until I had

nothing left, nothing there.
I was forced to let it go. Feel what I had done to ruin myself, destroy myself.
In a run to greater goods I forgot to love me.

it's a choice until that's gone and it is gone 'cause I was blind. I see that now.
A choice to stop and see myself, a choice to stop in time to safe what's left of me.
But I just couldn't see my true state. I couldn't bare the sight.
So I hid the truth and went on until I had

nothing left, nothing there.
I was torced to let it go. Feel what I had done to ruin myself, destroy myself.
In a run to greater goods I was blinded.

Nothing anymore.

Nothing left, nothing there.
I was forced to let it go. Feel what I had done to ruin myself, destroy myself.
In a run to greater goods I forgot to love me.
