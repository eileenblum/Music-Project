Alter slowly, freeze in time.
Leisurely we decline.
Caught in routine we fall asleep.

Change tomorrow, find your way.
Try to learn from yesterday.
Face yourself.
Traditions revised.

We see our lives unfold, a mere excuse.
Taken for granted, blinded we live.
We see our dreams die out, no substitutes.
Only at the precibus we change.
At the precibus...

See the daily state you're in and reflect.
You see how thin your being becomes.
Behaviour returns.

We see our lives unfold, a mere excuse.
Taken for granted, blinded we live.
We see our dreams die out, no substitutes.
Only at the precibus we change.

At the sight of destruction.
At the dawn of devastation.
We change course; we grow stronger.

We stand tall!
Only when we fall.

We see our lives unfold, a mere excuse.
Taken for granted, blinded we live.
We see our dreams die out, no substitutes.
Only at the precibus we change.
At the precibus...
