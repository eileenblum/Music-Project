Sounds creep softly into my ears. Deafening as it's exploding in my head.
No silent peace. My head keeps making symphonies of deluded thoughts.

Thoughts and dreams and music.
Streaming endless, they are stuck in my head!

Open nerves, they're killing me.
Enlarging everything.
My mind explodes; it's burning up and scaring me.
Nothing feels the same, So strong it shuts me down, so strong I lost control.

Emotions creep slowly into my heart, not just my own, I pick up every signal.
Inflamed and sore. My heart keeps making tragedies of diminutive things.
My everything hurts!
My system burns!

Sounds and words and memories.
They captured me, they're stuck in my head!

Open nerves, they're killing me.
Enlarging everything.
My mind explodes; it's burning up and scaring me.
Nothing feels the same. So strong it shuts me down.

Open nerves!
They're showing me the truth by force. My body's completely drained.
And primitive emotions can thrive. Goodbye 'control'.

I feel more pain.
My system forces me to.
A mental twist to fear all I can become... I can become!

Open nerves, they're killing me.
Enlarging everything.
My mind explodes; it's burning up and scaring me.
Nothing feels the same.
As it shuts me down. A signal I can't defy.
They're showing me the truth by force. My body's completely drained.
And primitive emotions can thrive. Goodbye 'control'. Goodbye illusion...
