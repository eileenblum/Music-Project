Can I beat my heart that's warning me? All signals turned red.
Can I cheat on time? Slow it down while I clear my head.

I think you know the answer.
Locked inside your heart.
I am the devil inside you.
Your angels lost the fight.

Silence; a divine dream I have.
Inner piece; long lost while I faded.

it is war inside me.
And I'm losing ground. (You stopped feeling while you kept on running.)
I'm gone.
Fading while ambitions burn.
And passion dies with every fight I (you) loose, my (your) demons dance.
Let your demons dance!

Can I change my ways? Allow the voice that tells me to stop.
Can I heal myself? Slow me down to return my strength.

Dare to see the truth in your heart.
Face yourself; embrace all you lack.

it is war inside me.
And I'm losing ground. (You stopped feeling while you kept on running.)
I'm gone.
Fading while ambitions burn.
And passion dies with every fight I (you) loose, my (your) demons dance.
Let your demons dance!

A thousand voices speak like a memory.
Bits and pieces; sound like a melody.
Dear angel, you've been gone too long and there're demons making
their own song.
Master my will; scream to stop me now!
No more left to give.
Now!
Demons dance tonight...

if you'd allow exhaustion.
if you'd allow to feel.
I am the warning inside you.
The limit's crossed; you pay.

Balance, a remote dream I have.
Inner faith, long lost while I changed.

it is war inside me.
And I'm losing ground. (You stopped feeling while you kept on running.)
I'm lost, alone.
Let this war set you free.
Learn the lesson why you're here.
I stopped feeling as I kept on running.
Fading while ambitions burn.
And passion died in every fight I (you) lost. While demons dance ...
