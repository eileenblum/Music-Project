True hearts.
True pain.
True lies to keep it away.

Hold on to careful deceit.
Fake your way out, you defeat every emotion with lucid words.

Fair minds.
Fair thoughts.
Fair doubts we thoroughly hide.

Hold on to words we can't say.
Spineless we keep them away.
Don't dare to show the pain they bear.

How can we show what's inside.
While all we feel tries to hide behind our reason and manner.
Stone cold hearts.

Anxious.
Oblivious.
Sheltered from our uncontrolled hearts.

Hold on to wishful believe.
Minds should give hearts some relieve.
Balance is hard to achieve, we're trained machines.

How can we show what's inside.
While all we feel tries to hide behind our reason.

and manner.
Confined hearts.

Frozen minds.
Stone cold heart.
Loveless lullabies.
Broken, distorted, confined.
We're lost!

Broken!
Confined!
Loveless; a song for the cold lost heart!

Feel more.
Dare more.
See more when your guard is down.

Hold on to words while we lie.
Distorted lullabies.
Play the sad music of our restrained hearts.

How can we show what's inside.
While all we feel tries to hide behind our reason and manner.
Confined hearts.
