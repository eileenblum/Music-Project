So mirror. What is it you see today?
A reflection yes, magically looking like mine.
The chameleon. A princess, a fighter, the 'wild at heart'. They are all the same.
A character shaped by the raggedness of life.

Oh, look again. Eyes mirror the heart. It can color and alter, amendable throughout my life. Resilient 'till I die.

So wisdom. What is it you learned today?
An epiphany. Magically changing my mind.
The 'I know it all'. The unsure, a dreamer, the cynic. They are all the same.
A character formed by the choices of life.

Oh, look again. Eyes mirror the heart. It can color and alter, amendable throughout my life. Resilient 'till I die.

Strong I look, broken I can be. Love what I lost, lost what I don't need. Break down to grow. Change your ways to stay sharp. Embrace yourself.
My amended heart.

Heart. Amend your life. Revise it.

Strive. Revive your heart. Empower it again.

So mindful. Live in the here and the now.
A character changed by the currents of life.

Oh, look again. Eyes mirror the heart. It can color and alter, amendable throughout my life. Changed in time.
