Face it, rage out!
Here's my darkest heart.
Feel it, bleed out!
Weak by darkened thoughts.
Feed it, wear out!
I am nothing but a shell.
Loathe it, cry out!
An inner scream that's lost.

I feel it.
I bare it.

Agony's no sin; embrace it.
Misery's no crime; concede it.
It's my pain...

Hide it, play nice.
Here's my sunny smile.
Blind it, look strong.
It's more real once others see.
Fake it, stay cool.
Keep the pain inside your mind.
Pretend you're tough.
And keept the truth deep down in slumber.

Agony's no sin; embrace it.
Misery's no crime; concede it.

Never keep it in; accept it.
Misery's no crime; allow it.

My pain. It's mine to feel.
My rage, my obsessions, my exhaustion, my grief, my disappointments,
my loss, my insecurity, my wounds, my anguish, my misery!

Agony's no sin; embrace it.
Misery's no crime; concede it.
Never keep it in; accept it.
Misery's no crime; allow it.
