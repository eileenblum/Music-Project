[Bonus Track]Lust!
Dare your sins.
Don't sooth what bums within.
it's an avid glow.
Loath!
Despise your sins.
Let grimness rise within.
Face your darkest side.
I know...

Modern sins.
We're empty inside.
Timeless crime's enticing.
Deadly sins.
Mere games today.

Greed!
Defy our sins.
The scorn that grows within.
As a hungry wolf.
Sloth!
Deny our sins.
Don't care what lies within.
Failures at your side.
I know...

Modern sins.
We're empty inside.
Timeless crime's enticing.
Deadly sins.
Mere games today.
And we all play...

What did we do?
Why did we stray?
What has changed to make all these sins easier every day?
Brazen and lost?
Repented and blessed?
Modern sins are deadly still even though we play.

Modern sins.
We're empty inside.
Timeless crime still charms us.
Deadly sins.
Mere games today.
Shameless we play...
