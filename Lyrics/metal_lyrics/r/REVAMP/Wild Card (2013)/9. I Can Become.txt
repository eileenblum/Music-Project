It's taking the most of me. I lost connection. Drifting again.
I feel what I want to feel. I change when I have to. Ravage serenity inside.
Wake me up!

It's breaking down what I build. I remain restless. Continuous mission.
My mind shapes what I should feel. Natural blindness to inner wishes.
Basic denial.

Who I am has changed in time.
Don't hold on to what once was.
Open to all I can become.

It's tearing up peace I found. I cannot calm down. Wandering again.
I feel what I need to feel. A genuine detour. Is this my way to keep it up?

Who I am has changed in time.
Don't hold on to what once was.
Open to all I can become.

Who I am has changed in time.
Don't hold on to what once was.

Open to all I can become.

Who I am. A quest for life.
Hold on to who I've become.
Open to all I have inside.
