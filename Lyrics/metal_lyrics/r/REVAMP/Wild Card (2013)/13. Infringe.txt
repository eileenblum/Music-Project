[Bonus Track]Put on a smile and let me unwind
Just pretend you listen, poker face
True emotion never show but mine
yours where hidden why'll I gave me heart

A true friend without judgement
Yours where only words if only I'd known
A helping hand while others failed me
Here's the truth you stabbed me in the back
now I know a heart is what you lack

Wound me deeply infringe my trust
call it friendship for the lighthearted days
my pain's frozen locked in time
still it hurts me I still feel betrayed

The fake compassion felt so genuine
said the right words when I was in need
your emotion stayed behind your smile
While I put my heart out on the line

A true friend with true secrets
why you lied to me if only I knew
A caring heart while other left me
Here's the truth you left me in the dark
And your friendship left a darken mark

Form your verdict and condemn me
Have you heard the story from both sides
let me fall just when I called out
Abandon me while my heart was bleeding?
