This will be the death of me. The silence.
Peace without a battle won. No hardship.
Safety such an empty state.
Suffocated by my fate I slumber.

The hunt will make my blood run wild. Embrace me.
Roam the earth to feed my mind. So lonesome.

Hear the wolves howl. Louder! Louder!
Hear the dogs cry. Howling! Howling!

Ravage the silence within. Before the sleep becomes eternally.
Lead me away from the calm.
But keep the door open for I will come home.

Inner peace, a complex wish.
Balancing extremes within.
Erratic but with deep devotion.
A vast range of intense emotions.

Bipolar, I am two in one.
My two sides fought but not one won.

My wolf and dog ...
Ravage the silence within. Before the sleep becomes eternally.

Lead me away from the calm. Feed me!
Caress the heart that beats wild. But feel my soul; so close, it's always there.
Let me run free but keep the door open for I will come home.

Hear the wolves howl. Louder! Louder!
Hear the dogs cry. Howling! Howling!

Selfish in its passions lust.
Righteous with impulsive gusts.
Feed the wolf and feed the dog.
The death of one's the death of both.

My wolf and dog...
Ravage the silence within. Before the sleep becomes eternally.
Lead me away from the calm. Feed me!
Caress the heart that beats wild. But feel my soul; so close, it's always there.
Let me run free but keep the door open for I will come home.
