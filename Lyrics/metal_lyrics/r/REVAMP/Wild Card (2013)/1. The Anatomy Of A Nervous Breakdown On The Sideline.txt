Standing on the sideline, see the life I live passing me by.
I look inside but can't go in.
Standing on the side while staring at myself, again I wonder. Who am I?

Let me go! Flee; far away from the life I once knew.
Let me fall, deep down! The truth will be down there to pick me back up.
Freeze time...for now...

Standing on the sideline, as an alien. It's weird to feel; who's that girl?
Standing here, so broken I'm too tired to grasp: that was me,
I was so self-assured!

Just let me go! Drift far away from the life I once knew.
Let me fall, deep down! The truth will be down there to pick me back up.
My own fear has brought me here.
Stand there alone on the sideline of life while it moved on.

Me, that person, I look so astray.
Re-inventing myself? I mimic in my search for me.
Like a doll on string I move. Like a marionette of a lost soul.
I am in there somewhere but for now I stay right here.

I'm on the sideline!

Just let me go! Drift far away from the life I once knew.
Let me fall, deep down! The truth will be down there to pick me back up.
My own fear has kept me there. Standing alone on the sideline of life while it moved on.
This made me so humble! I'll stay a little while longer.
