I dreamed a dream
But now that dream
Is gone from me (gone from me)
I dreamed a dream
But now that dream
Is taken from me (taken from me)

I have nothing left
But apathy
You took all away
From me
Blinded within light
Voiceless within a scream

Show your face, the real one
Show your face, it's just begun
Show yourself
Not who you pretend to be

I dreamed a dream
But now that dream
Is gone from me (gone from me)
I dreamed a dream
But now that dream
Is taken from me (taken from me)

I dreamed a dream
I dreamed a dream

There will be no sunrise
Behind these blinded eyes
Left in darkness
I feel nothing
Blinded within light
Voiceless within a scream

Show your face, the real one
Show your face, it's just begun
Show yourself, who you really are
Show yourself
Show yourself
Not who you pretend to be

I dreamed a dream
But now that dream
Is gone from me (gone from me)
I dreamed a dream
But now that dream
Is taken from me (taken from me)

I
I dreamed a dream
I dreamed a dream

You took everything from me
I have nothing but apathy

I dreamed a dream...
And now it's gone
Something sick
