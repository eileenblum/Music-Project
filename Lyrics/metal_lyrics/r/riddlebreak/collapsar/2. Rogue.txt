Rogue, outcast
Call me what you will
Desolate, Derelict
Wandering globe of ice and dust
Abandoned, hopeless
Forced to wander time and space
Abandoned, hopeless

A lonely soul
Left on... left on it's own
No set... no set course
Only... gravity!

A parent star left without it's child
A lost child left to fend for itself (to fend for itself)
The frigid waste
Of galactic territory
A lonely endeavor (endeavor)
To find a new home

Closing in... closer to...
Closer to oblivion
Everything... everything stays eternal
Nothing... nothing stays the same

A parent star left without it's child
A lost child left to fend for itself (to fend for itself)
The frigid waste
Of galactic territory
A lonely endeavor (endeavor)
To find a new home

The frigid waste
Of galactic territory
A lonely endeavor
To find a new home
