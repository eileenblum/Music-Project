A cold and silent whisper
Shuddered up my spine
The things it said festered
As it's prisoner was my mind

So further we go
To places unknown
The eye of your mind
Will not stay closed
What you will find
It's only a show
The hole in your head
You're left all alone

Why does your faith suffocate me
The lies, drip through your teeth
And through the pain of the many
You'll bring us all to our knees

The spinner weaves it's webs
Of promises un-kept
While the threads of our hearts are carefully
Undone at the hem

So further we go
To places unknown
The eye of your mind
Will not stay closed
What you will find
It's only a show
The hole in your head
You're left all alone

You're left all alone

I think you should
Hold your tongue
Stitch your mouth
It's all been done

Remember that
There's no submissions for
Grace

Oh my god

Why does your faith suffocate me
The lies, drip through your teeth
And through the pain of the many
You'll bring us all to our knees

You'll bring this world to it's knees
