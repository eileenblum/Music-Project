Torn, between two worlds
A dreaded fear of paths colliding
Fighting, for what you believe in
Fighting, because you were told

Live by the sword
Or die by the bullet
The choice isn't always up to you
Whatever happened to dying with honour?
They take aim and run you through

It's amazing how things have changed
But the story stays the same (stays the same)
Ancient kings conquer worlds
Politicians play their games (play their games)
As long as there is man on Earth
There will always be war (always be war)
The only thing that ever changes
Is what we're fighting for (fighting for)

We walk, on the ashes
Of conflicts unresolved
We are the product, left and forgotten
Our way of life, broken and rotten

Live by the sword
Or die by the bullet
The choice isn't always up to you
Whatever happened to dying with honour?
They take aim and run you through

It's amazing how things have changed
But the story stays the same (stays the same)
Ancient kings conquer worlds
Politicians play their games (play their games)
As long as there is man on Earth
There will always be war (always be war)
The only thing that ever changes
Is what we're fighting for (fighting for)

Live by the sword
Or die
By the bullet

Live by the sword or die by the bullet
Live by the sword or die by the bullet
Live by the sword

Live by the sword or die by the bullet
Live by the sword or die by the bullet
Live by the sword

Or die
