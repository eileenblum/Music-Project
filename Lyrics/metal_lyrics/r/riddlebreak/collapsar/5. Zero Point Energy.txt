Yeah!

Hold your ground
This is where we make our stand
Hold your ground
Witness the resolve of man
Hold your ground
We will embrace the flood
Hold your ground
Our banners drenched in blood

Hold your ground
Hold your ground

Weighted, my soul is fated by
Invaders, here to control our kind
Gripping, at any shred of hope
Slipping, when fears start to choke
Take cover, they bring down city lights
Kiss lover, it may be the last time

Fated, my mind is weighted by
Wasted, how have I spent my life?
Fleeting, a race once so proud
Creeping, through darkened alleys now
Discover, a tech to bring us light
From Under, we destroy from inside

Hold your ground
We will embrace the flood
Hold your ground
Our banners drenched in blood

Hold your ground
Hold your ground

Gated, a fence to keep inside
Our nature, our instincts to survive
Sedation, done by those in veils
Our nation, asleep on a bed of nails
Wake us, please from this nightmare
Resistance, is stirring in the air

Created, a mind control device
In secret, a chance to free our minds
Bracing, break chains from our wrists
Pacing, the moment to resist
From cover, we attack at first light
Brothers, today we stand and fight

The sky cracks open
Bodies falling
Limp and lifeless
Laid around us
Judgement
Is finally at hand
Let he who wins the final battle
Decide the fate of man

Hold your ground
This is where we make our stand
Hold your ground
Witness the resolve of man

Hold your ground
We will embrace the flood
Hold your ground
Our banners drenched in blood

Blood!

BLOOD!

Hold your ground
Hold your ground
