Crack your mind
You won't believe
What you will find inside
A desperate soul
Longing to break away
From it's own god damn humanity

We will leave this human shell
If only for a while
To escape from humanity's judging smile (escape from)
In this fantasy
We are dreaming
But in reality (reality)
Our potential is only sleeping

Crack your mind
You won't believe
What you will find inside
A desperate soul
Longing to be so much more
Than it ever fucking was before

We will leave this human shell
If only for a while
To escape from humanity's judging smile (escape from)
In this fantasy
We are dreaming
But in reality (reality)
Our potential is only sleeping

When you're left
Broken and kneeling
In front of of an empty grave
Please tell me, who will you turn to
And ask the question, "will I be saved?"

When you're left
Broken and kneeling
In front of of an empty grave
Please tell me, who will you turn to
And ask the question, "will I be saved?"

When you're left
Broken and kneeling
Which deity
Would you find appealing

In this fantasy
We are dreaming
But in reality
Our potential is only sleeping

We've got to wake them up

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

And realise
Our potential is only sleeping
