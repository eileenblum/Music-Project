I will never break
In hard times
Never forget what really matters

Understand son
I have walked in your shoes
Don't be scared to walk alone
Cause all you need is you

You can spend your life imagining
Ghosts haunting all your path
Or you can believe in yourself
And no one else

What does not kill will make you stronger
Promise yourself today
I'll do what I want
And I will never give up

I will never break
In hard times
Never forget what really matters

Follow
The certain,
No chains attached
Sometimes
You'll fall on your knees
But that's just a part of life

There are
Those who live for
A life with no today
Nothing is out of reach
It's the decisions you make

What does not kill will make you stronger
Promise yourself today
I'll do what I want
And I will never...

I will never break
In hard times
Never forget what really matters

Rebuild yourself for better days
When you will realize the impossible is right this way
Live as only you can live
Cause we don't know what comes next

What really matters?
