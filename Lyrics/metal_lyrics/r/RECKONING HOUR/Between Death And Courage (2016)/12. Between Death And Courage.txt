There was a time
That all I did was to survive
Among the empty shells of those who always tried to put me down

Realized,
My bleeding eyes could see
The wheel of life, treason and smiles
Life is a mere fortuity

Betrayers,
I'll make you meet the final instance
Where the darkness will reign

Command your life
I challenge you
Notice all you have sacrificed this way

Calamity
The blade that once protected, betrays
Carrying a falsehood life
Lurking through the rotten shade

Malocchio's victims,
The ancient never lie,
The true strength lies inside of me
Where no man and no god can misguide

Between the line of death and courage
Overcome who you really are
Between the line
You'll find resolve
The real truth that makes you alive

Calamity
The blade that once protected, betrays
Carrying a falsehood life
Lurking through the rotten shade

Malocchio's victims,
The ancient never lie,
But now you know the story well
And you shall take your own conclusions

Between the line of death and courage
Overcome who you really are
Between the line
You'll find resolve
The real truth that makes you alive

No matter how far I go
My path's enlightened by the stars
I'm not afraid of my way
We become what we think about
