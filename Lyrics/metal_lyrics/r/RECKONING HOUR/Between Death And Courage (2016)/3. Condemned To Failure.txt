How many people you had to blame
To justify every mistake?
How many choices you have to waste?

Fading increasingly
Buried in ignorance
This paranoia is not a dream

Always asking for salvation
Destroying your own foundation
To wash away the ashes of the past

You've been waiting for so long
But you will never be the hero
And even if you cut the dragon's head off
You're condemned to failure!

So proud of the scars
That were never earned
So blind, will never see the end

Getting on the act
Repaid with agony
Reality straight into your face

You've been waiting for so long
But you will never be the hero
And even if you cut the dragon's head off
You're condemned to failure!

Come face me now
Face your pride
Pray for your god before you die
Show some respect
Learn to fight
In this everlasting life

Always waiting for someone...
Your idols are broken!
Are broken!

You've been waiting for so long
But you will never be a hero
And even if you cut the dragon's head off
You're condemned to failure...
