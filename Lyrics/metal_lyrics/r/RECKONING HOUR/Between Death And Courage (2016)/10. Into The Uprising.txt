Desecration and policy
There's no man here to be believed
We're spoils of revolution
Bastards sons of liberty

Those who sworn to protect us
Now give the man no more choice
In a life of inequality
Blindly followed by the traitor's voice

Keep fighting
Our tears will turn into blood
Convicted
That one day we may reborn

Generation
I'm calling you one last time
For justice
Hear the resounding cry

You want to prove it?
You need to challenge yourself
You need to see with the different eyes

Greatness mirrored in disgrace
While children lose their lives
We must end this impunity
Or face it in the end of times

Keep fighting
Our tears will turn into blood
Convicted
That one day we may reborn

Generation
I'm calling you one last time
For justice
Hear the resounding cry

Together
We are fighting again
Without the fear
Like brothers until the end

We've been tamed for too long
In this social annihilation
By our mighty arms we shall break the hypocrisy

Keep fighting
Our tears will turn into blood
Convicted
That one day we may reborn

Generation
I'm calling you one last time
For justice
Hear the resounding cry

Together
We are fighting again
Without the fear
Like brothers until the end...
