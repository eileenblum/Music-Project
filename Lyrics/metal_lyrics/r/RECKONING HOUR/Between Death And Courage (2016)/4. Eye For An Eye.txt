Sometimes it feels like I'm weak
But I'm just sick of this shit
The wretched triumph
It's taking over

We have to pay it back
No matter what they say
Sacrifice the forgotten
Seized by the jealousy

Shed their blood and show them no forgiveness

There's no trusted words
There's only win or lose
Eternal struggle
Your deeds will haunt you

Would you take this path?
Betraying all you have

There's nothing you can do
Until you beg for a merciful silent death

Inside us all
An animal
One predatory beast
Eye for an eye
Tooth for tooth
This is the law of retaliation

Is this enough?
Do you still believe it's the way?
Will be enough
When fire burns inside you

Open the eyes
Against the wicked
Will be enough
When you witness the rise of the fallen

There's no trusted words
There's only win or lose
Your soul is broken
But it's not forgotten

We have to take it back
No matter what they say
The time is always right
For those who have something to believe

Shed their blood and show them no forgiveness
We'll prevail before the liar's eyes
Shed their blood and show them no forgiveness
We'll prevail before the liar's eyes

Is this enough?
Do you still believe that it's the way?
Will be enough
When fire burns inside you
