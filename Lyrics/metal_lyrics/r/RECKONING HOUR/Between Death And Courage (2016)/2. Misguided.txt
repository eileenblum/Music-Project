So, look at me now...
You never thought I could do such thing, right?
Well you're wrong, goddamn wrong
And now you're falling on your knees
You can hide, you can cry
But first let me tell you a story

Where you only saw mistakes
I got the chances to rise
Where you buried all the friends you had
I got ties that will never die

Here we are
Beneath the storm
Where all the strife says nothing was in vain
So far from suffering
When the help comes from nowhere
I just think of this place
Where life will set me free
Where the light won't fade away

There's one redemption

I stand, against all the odds
Restraining anger for the overcome
How do you do?
How can you stand living like something that you'll never become?

Where you only saw mistakes
I got the chances to rise
Where you buried all the friends you had
I got ties that will never die

Here we are
Beneath the storm
Where all the strife says nothing was in vain
So far from suffering
When the help comes from nowhere
I just think of this place
Where life will set me free
Where the light won't fade away

There is no time for mockery or explanation
They say the scars will never heal
There's one redemption
But you'll never know

Here we are
Beneath the storm
Where all the strife says nothing was in vain
So far from suffering
When the help comes from nowhere
I just think of this place
Where life will set me free
Where the light won't fade away
