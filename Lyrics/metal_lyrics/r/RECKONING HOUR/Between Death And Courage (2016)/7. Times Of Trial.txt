This path we have to tread
Even when hope is at the end
Burning into the void

Erase all the mistakes
The past that we could not have changed
I've learned to walk alone

The suffering
Always walks beside me
I'm bleeding
'Till my inside's dry
Self revolution
Bring it all down to an end

Beyond these walls
There is no silence
Who should I be?
I cannot see
What do I need to prove?
To forget my sins

We went far beyond the days
When our hearts were only one
I can never replace

Feelings have become disgrace
Why is this shit determined
I won't be judged again

The hatred
Welled up within me
I'm changing
Because there's no more lies
Self revolution
Bring it all down to an end

Beyond these walls
There is no silence
Who should I be?
I cannot see
What do I need to prove?
To forget my sins
