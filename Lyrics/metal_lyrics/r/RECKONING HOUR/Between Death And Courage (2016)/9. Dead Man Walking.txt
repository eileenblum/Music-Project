Behold the suffering
The pain consuming your soul
Slowly devouring you
I'm taking back control

This pressure's always been forcing you down
Under a fallen sky
The truth comes out

I hear just blasphemy
You speaking shit
You never learn kid
And that makes me fucking sick

Don't need to answer my questions
You're out of time
To be a man like you
I'd rather die!

Your weakness
It strengthens me
Forgotten
Like a dead man walking

I see your stricken face,
Unrecognized
A scream of shattered words,
From a fucking bastard child

Don't need to answer my questions
You're out of time
I did my part on this game
See you in hell!

Your weakness
It strengthens me
Forgotten
Like a dead man walking

The freedom comes at a cost
You end up paying with the skin
Your false words prove no value
Cause greatness is all within

You're not going to take me down
Don't even try
I hope one day you may learn
Can't you accept what you've been told?

This is what you made your life
Suffer for all you left behind...

Motherfucker!
