For every pressure I hold
My spirit is born again
Facing death, possessed by war
The hate keeps growing

I can feel your soul is not there
You're just an empty shell
Cursed and forgotten by God
Waiting for an end

When your wounds are open wide
There's no sun up in the sky
Can't you see before your eyes?
Now it's time for you to...

Rise from suffocation,
Free all the chains that bind you
Rise through all the fear
That holds you back and choose to rise
Ask yourself what makes you come alive
Then go and fucking do it

What makes you alive?

Every time you try to hide
The confrontation haunts you
Try looking beyond my eyes
There's one salvation

When your wounds are open wide
There's no sun up in the sky
Can't you see before your eyes?
Now it's time for you to

Rise from suffocation,
Free all the chains that bind you
Rise through all the fear
That holds you back and choose to rise
Ask yourself what makes you come alive,
Then go and fucking do it

You may have to fight a battle
More than once to win it

Rise from suffocation,
Free all the chains that bind you
Rise through all the fear
That holds you back and choose to rise
Ask yourself what makes you come alive,
Then go and fucking do it
