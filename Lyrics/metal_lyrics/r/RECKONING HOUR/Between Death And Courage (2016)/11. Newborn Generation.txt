Nothing can bring me down
I was born from this fucked up generation
Now I feel prepared
Struggling with my fist
And now I walk with my own legs

I spit to the sky now I have to wipe my face
All the tragedies of my life are being surpassed

We will not deny our legacy
And everything we have learned
Don't bow your head to anyone
Your voice will be heard

Breaking up the flow of life
Fighting against the system
We've been silent for too long
We won't be defeated

For so many years of despair
Living under oppression
Suffering, unable to fight back
This is our fucking ascension

We will not deny our legacy
And everything we have learned
Don't bow your head to anyone
Your voice will be heard

It will be different this time
Against the endless struggle
There is no wrong or right
We'll give the just what is fair

What is fair?
Just watch defeat?
Rise up above it
Blood and hatred, it dwells in me

One by one
Blood for blood
We face death
Only to seek the truth

My voice will be... heard
Your voice will be... heard
Our voice will fucking be...
Heard!
