Lost
In this hard and tortuous path
With blood and dust in my eyes
By refusing sorrow
I'm transcending dark times

Fight
Take my breath away
But never my persistence
Learning by myself
A reason for existence

How can my heart be the same?
Can I take another day?

Lost
One silent hatred in me
Crawling out this darkness
I carve the walls
To paint the time inside this...

Hell
Between death and courage
Standing on oblivion
Strength within myself
Leads me through desperation

I can remember all the times
That we rose from the ashes
Never denying our pride
In a search of something
No more mistakes! No more!
Had my spirit overcome
Fighting the darkest times

Blood
Is pumping through my veins
Taking out this misery
Power is born inside me
I'm rewriting my own

Fate
I'm locked and loaded now
No one can bring me down
Let the fire burn
Putting myself through a path of no return

I must remember all the times
That we rose from the ashes
Never denying our pride
In a search for something
No more mistakes! No more!
Had my spirit overcome
Fighting the darkest times alone
