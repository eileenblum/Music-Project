Dethtroning your god killing of all saints
My eyes ablaze with anger
Burning all the nation's rebellious vengeance
Can't wait for holy salvation
Thunderous screams rumble the earth
As the filthiest ritual begins
Bloody storms infernal and mortal decrees
Fall from dark skies
Insane beliefs dogmatic thoughts
Decadent mortality falling away
Only the rebel god's immortality
Shall survive

Rising the rebellious vengeance
Rising the firey ball of dark light
Burning the kingdom of fallacy
Spiritless frightful fiery suns
World of hypocrisy perished in fire
Mankind will smolder without a last breath
Rising the empire of fear in this land
Rebellious vengeance now takes command

New eyes for the rebel souls
Destroying the labyrinth with burning desire
Grand ascension to the throne
Mankind in perpetual decay
