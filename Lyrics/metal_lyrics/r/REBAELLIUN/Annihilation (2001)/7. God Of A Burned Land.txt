"Day of wrath and doom impending
Heaven and earh in ashes ending
All creation is awaiting" *
The promised land is now burning

Burn this land
This world and all their dreams
Burn this race
They are all victims

So god this land is yours
We renege on this world
My victory is as real as your fall
Nameless warriors
Empowered by a cosmic strength
Now burning a land of forsaken

Day of death and suffering fading away
Heaven and earth awaiting
All creation is now burning
The promised land falls into ruin again

[* Taken from W.A. Mozart's Requeim]
