The merciless coming
Of the unholy god of gods
Leading the march of the survivors hordes
Unleashing the bloodiest wars
Rising up against thy dogmas and thy laws
No loyalty or supremacy
Renege on the false lords
Defying the plague
Denial of the cross

Chaos coming
No place to hide this time
True revelations
Frozen end of the weak
Relentless endless searching for the truth
Defying the plague
Towards the victory

I am the end
I am the beast
I am the strength
Stubborn resistance
The eyes of the wolf
Leading my will
Defying the plague
Ready to kill
