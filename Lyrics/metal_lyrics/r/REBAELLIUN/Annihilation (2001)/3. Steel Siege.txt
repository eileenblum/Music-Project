Legions of assassins unmerciful march
Underworld can't wait anymore
Rising the darkest mist
Towards the victory of the beasts
Time to kill and celebrate their desperation
Crowning all the gods of the abomination
I am the one who'll crush
I am the one who'll lead
I am the darkest men's creation

Civilisation falls into ruin
Infernal races are coming to dominate
Spoiling the innocence spreading despair
Restless attack despotic domain
You break your vow in suicide
I despise your insignificant life
My army is here the steel siege
Stealing souls for the dark side

The steel siege is thy destiny
Ripping mind and soul in blapshemy
Impotent nations against my will
Stillborn request of humanity

Swallowed shwallowed by thy fears
Men's weakness is my strength
I laugh in the face of thy lord, thy Nazarene
Scornful laugh my most pleasant vengeance
Swallowing swallowing all this land
Apocalyptic end from infernal chasms
Thundergod proclaims genocide
Steel siege the final war
