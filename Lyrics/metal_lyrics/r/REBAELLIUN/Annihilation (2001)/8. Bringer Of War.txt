Leading the army preparing to conquer
No place this time for the cowards who ran away
Bringer of war lord of all domains
Defeating all the nations proving the bloody oath

Blasting the enemy's field the pestilent undead
Killing all sorts of life in this terrain
Apocalypse reigning the legion of rats
The angel of death will take all the souls
Victory of the emperor

The last sunrise wont come in the horizon
The highest command proclaiming the eternal night
Unscrupulous filth revelations will fall away
Dececrating the gods ablaze revenge
Apocalypse reigning the legion of rats
Extermination of this race ultimate command

Leading the army preparing to conquer
Killing all sorts of life in this terrain
Bringer of war lord of all domains
Defeating all the nations victory of the emperor
