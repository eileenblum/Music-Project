We shall rise
Deep in out souls a rebellious will
Destructive restless attack
In the name of hte hoghest revenge
Annihilation
We bring chaos
Filth perishing towards the new age
The end of the rotten peace
Dethroned their saviour
I witness the end of their kingdom

Embryonic world's disease
Oppressive gods swallowing humanity's bequest
They plot in vain
God's creation shall not rest
We reign supreme
New era has come for the ones who'll lead
This empire to its downfall
Dethroning their saviour
I withness the end of their kingdom

Wolves' conspiracy
In the tower of fear
We still refust this loyalty
World's fallacy
Two thousand years will follow
Under the sign of the beast's cruelty

My victory
The final annihilation of this so calld world
Eternally
Suffering
I still hear thousands of screams
The lamb's death symphony
