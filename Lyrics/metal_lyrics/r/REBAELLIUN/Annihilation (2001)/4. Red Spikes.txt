We witness the coming of the chaos gods
Their light must be worshipped
This age we'll celebrate
The splendours of a near time
Spoils of an endless war
Screams announcing the end
Bestial frenzy of victory
Annihilation of mankind must prevail
Eternal obliveon of false idols
Nailing flesh and spirit in damnation

We witness the siege it's time to kill
Lances and blades will make you bleed
Red spikes crossing hands and feet
Crowning with black thorns the coward Nazarene
You cannot hide your holy face
You cannot save your blessed soul
You cannot judge the life around
You cannot run away - Our time has come

Our time has come
To wash the earth and purify
To kill this race
They will not see the light
Unchangeable end
Unchangeable higher sight
Shine like venomous red spikes

We witness the coming of the chaos gods
We witness this so awaited siege
This age we'll celebrate
The spledours of a near time
I can see...
