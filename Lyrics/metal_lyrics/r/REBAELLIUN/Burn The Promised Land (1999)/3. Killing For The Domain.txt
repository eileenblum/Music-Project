[Music: REBAELLIUN]
[Lyrics: F. Penna Correa]

Seeking for the bastard enemy, to kill him, to destroy
Running in the dark land baptized in fire
Escaping from the chapel of the damned
To survive I wanna kill and destroy the cross again
Fuck you, Christ! With pain!
Rising from the abyss to fill the blackened sky
My empire, my domain

Killing... for the domain! Killing!

Feeling all the wrath in my veins
Which was given by the lord who proclaims:
"War and violence in all my domain
Death to the christians in the most bizarre pain!"
Fucking this world and mankind again
Crucifying their god to decree the eternal shame

This land is forever damned like Hell
The strong ones will lead mankind to the end
