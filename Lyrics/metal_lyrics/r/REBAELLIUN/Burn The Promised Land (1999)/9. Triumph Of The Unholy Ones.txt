[Music: REBAELLIUN]
[Lyrics: Ronaldo Lima]

Awaiting the flames of Hell
The darkest king shall rise
To spread the seeds of evil
And humble the thrones of the earth
We're warriors at this war
Your sword leading the battle
With fury we'll crush mankind
By the force of the blazing Metal!

Killing! Killing! I swallow their poisoned blood
Feel the scourge from my wrathful whip
Die by my hands weak servants of light
Fell the taste of my hunger...hunger steel

Marching, desolating, killing...
We'll spread the seeds of destruction on this
damned world
Agonizing, bleeding, ending...
Humanity starts to be devoured

[Lead: Ronaldo]

[Lead: Penna]

Immersed in the immortal flames
The man killer awaits
To lead us to evil glory
And cover the earth with blood!

[Lead: Both]
