[Music: REBAELLIUN]
[Lyrics: F. Penna Correa]

With our force we resist
Apocalypse is our only revenge
Nazarene feel my hate
Feel my sword on your face
An endless war we're going on
With the black warriors, Hell's force
Again we'll crucify you false lord
With blood in my hands I declare war

For centuries we've lived and died
In this decaying age
Now the giants of steel will arise
With the beasts of this land at our side
Chaos, our desire was fulfilled
Blood, all the blood spills
In this war there's only glory or death
Victory is the only way at war!
War! War! At war!

I hear the cry of mankind
I see men in a lion's den
I feel all hate in my hands, in my arms
I give all this hell to the bastards
I'm in this war for victory - your fall!
