[Music: REBAELLIUN]
[Lyrics: F. Penna Correa]

We lead the battle to conquer
We bring the inverted cross to burn the promised land
Behind a line drawn in the sand
They're all afraid... this is the end!

Overflowing with fever
Overthrowing believers
Legions march in attack
Spawning the disease
Burn! Burn! Burn!
Burn!!!

Slander... we want revenge for the centuries of lies
Surrender... the beast takes me, and I reborn
Vengeance will lead this night
A new throne will arise this dawn
As we kill all the enemies in fight

[Lead: Ronaldo]
