[Music: REBAELLIUN]
[Lyrics: Ronaldo Lima]

Storms will come from the red dawn
Storms will come spread the plague
From chaos will rise up the shadow lands
The ancient spirits of earth born... again!

Earth - turn me eternal
Air - turn me unbounded
Water - turn me untamable
Fire - burn in my will!

Burn immortal winds... burn!
Come unbridled force, uncontrollable... come!
The immense fury consumes my eyes,
Spirits of anguish hear my cry!

Blow infinite winds of pain, of suffering
It's our own desire to be born in another life
Like the end that becomes the beginning
Like the sun overcome by the cold.

[Lead: Ronaldo]

Storms will come from the red dawn
Storms will come bring the unity
From chaos will arise the beginning
The ancient warriors of pain born again!

[Lead: Ronaldo]
