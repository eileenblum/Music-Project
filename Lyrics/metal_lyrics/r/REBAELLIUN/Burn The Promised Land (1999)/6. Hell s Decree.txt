[Music: REBAELLIUN]
[Lyrics: F. Penna Correa]

When just the strong ones prevail
The domain of the hellish forces
The domain of the unholy will
Our march will crush the cross
To decree the eternal darkness
And the blasphemy against the god!

Christian's slaughter starts
Let all the men die
To rape their women and hear them cry
We drink their blood like wine
To show the eternal truth
We fight like demons and they will die!

Die! Die!
Die! Die! The Hell decrees... die!

[Lead: Penna]

Hell decrees...
This battle was won by the black and real forces
We've ridden for centuries to this dark empire
Rising is the serpent Tiamat to proclaim:
"Apocalypse reigns in this age of fire!"

[Lead: Ronaldo]
