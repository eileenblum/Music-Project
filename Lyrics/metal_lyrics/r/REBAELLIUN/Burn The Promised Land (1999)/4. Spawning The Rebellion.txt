[Music: REBAELLIUN]
[Lyrics: F. Penna Correa/Ronaldo Lima]

Blood washing the ground
It's my desire burning me
In suffering my enemies will fall
No mercy I'm one with Hell's warriors!

Burning so deep in my heart
Blood in my sword - life ends...
The flame of hate is my way
From the dark - in attack - evil calls!

Warriors from the past call my name
By the blood, honour and steel
By the flame of the black wax
A Covenant I will seal!

Rebellion! Rebellion! Rebellion!
Spawning the Rebellion!

[Lead: Ronaldo]

May your power come to me - as it must be
Shine in my eyes the fire of your spells
I hear, in my mind, the bells of hell
In this fallacious world, I'm a rebel!

[Lead: Penna]
