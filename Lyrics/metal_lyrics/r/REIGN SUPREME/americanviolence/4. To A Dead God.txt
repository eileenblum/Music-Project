I only want to find a safe place where I can hide. Yeah, thats who I am inside, always afraid of my mind. Oh I just don't know where else to go. So I pray to a night sky, to a nothing, to a dead weight, to a dead god. I burn like fire. Desire, it runs me through. Tell me, tell me, just what the fuck this means to you. I'm calling in a plea for you to come and rescue me. I am an island, I stand alone. Drowning in a sea of humanity. There is no way out.
