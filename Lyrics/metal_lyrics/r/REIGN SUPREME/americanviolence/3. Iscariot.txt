And now I see, I was wrong, cold-blooded, unforgivable. Nothing that you say can make this right. I died tonight, a tiny part of me. Shattered trust, I don't believe in truth. And I won't make the same mistake. And I won't let you get the best of me. I gave you everything. I watched you throw it all away. I gave you everything. Iscariot, liar, you betray. Iscariot, betray.
