I stand, defiant. Reject their lies. My body broken, but I push on. Alone and Hated in a world gone wrong. I rise fall rise back up. Caught in a cycle of doubt and regret, a prison of hate that I can't escape. Gotta find a way to break out. I fucking rise above. I fucking stand alone and hated. Defiant. Nothing that I see is real to me, Imitating permanence. So I find myself escaping, I live for today, because tomorrow my never come. I live today, I stand defiant.
