I will not lose. They tried to tear us apart, knocked us down, but we got back up. All alone in this life we live, stood strong through all you had to give. My blood runs through your veins, a bond that still remains. Some things are worth fighting for, for pride, for honor. We won't be slaves to our destiny. My blood runs through your veins, a bond that still remains. All alone in this life we live, stood strong through all you had to give. And we're still unbroken.
