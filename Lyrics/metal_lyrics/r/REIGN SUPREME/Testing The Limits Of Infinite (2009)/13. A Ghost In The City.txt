i'm so sick of wishful thinking turn the page, the clock is ticking wishing i could change your world but sometimes hope is so far, oh so far away i can't walk these streets anymore they cry your name they cry and i lost myself when i lost you i saw the hope in your eyes a future never realized never forget your name your face your fucking scent stained myself my world, myself the world we knew. oh so far away i can't walk these streets anymore they cry your name they cry and i won't live in memories of yesterday see the signs your world came to an end today it doesn't matter what the fuck we say your world came to an end today i can't sleep, i don't dream i just lie there wide awake i found a soul so pure a gift sent from above but only death is certain it cheats us of our loves this is my way of saying goodbye
