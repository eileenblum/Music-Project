your eyes are blinded, obstructed you can't see how all your talk means nothing to no one and how your act isn't fooling me your one true love, your "all that i've got" is something you don't grasp at all come face to face with your pride before your fall and this has gone on far too long i bit my tongue and i swallowed the words that ate me up inside can't wear your heart on your sleeve when you've got nothing inside and every day it gets worse and worse despite how hard i try to crush the insincere i'm calling you out right here, right now just you and me and your hypocrisy
