tested my patience, now feel my hate it's always blinded me i'd pull the fucking trigger just to feel release the temptation of satisfaction, indulging in regret "i'm about to overload" "hold back or explode" don't let go, don't let this moment crush you don't let go, don't let this moment slip away i don't know anything anymore i don't know anything so many years ago, i lost my way but i never had it anyway sold my soul to learn it wasn't worth the price i paid the life i made a shot to the heart is just a shot in the dark i'm sick of feeling sorry for everyone but myself don't let go, don't let this moment crush you don't let go, don't let this moment slip away i can feel it, i can feel myself, slipping away i'd turn back time to begin again, but it won't don't let go, don't let this moment crush you don't let go, don't let this moment slip away
