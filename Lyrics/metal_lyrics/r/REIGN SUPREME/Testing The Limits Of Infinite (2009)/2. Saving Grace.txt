born alone, i'm always trying and failing to escape the slowly sinking feeling i have worn like a weighted crown of thorns can we share this burden of being born alone? we fucking die alone no words can change what's written in stone so i fall, fall down to my knees oh god save me from the hands of my fellow man but no one can save me from this path i've chosen now to leave those empty words behind, i can't be saved crashing bores and lifeless whores, all that surrounds and the hunter becomes the hunted down, trust in doubt trust in nothing but a reckless abandon and the hunter becomes the hunted down, so save yourself and if you spit, i'll swallow every bitter taste buried so deep inside of me this sovereign heart is my saving grace could never be a part of something more could never be a part of something worth dying for and i'll live a life that doesn't mean anything break the cycle, break those chains but when i die, you'll sing songs that don't mean anything break the cycle, break the chains we all die alone
