and come what may i know that i'll survive but life puts your will to the test of love and death and baited breath i lost again i put the pen to the paper so read the words i wrote as favors i wrote this song to let you know my friend to serve a constant reminder and come what may, i'll still be here needing you, and i know you need this too this heart, this heart of mine has seen so many things and i know that they were untrue, but i've never doubted you so please, please don't take for granted what we have achieved know that you are my everything there is no me without a you and come what may, i'll still be here love every moment cherish every second i have with you you'll never walk alone i'll never leave your side this love will persevere long after our bodies have died let me wash away every tear you've ever cried you'll never walk alone i'll never leave your side they can't take it away (love) the only thing that makes this life worth living we'll always carry each other we'll carry on
