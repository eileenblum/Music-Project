i look back upon a life spent waiting, wasting time wishing for what can never be mine so many nights staring up at a blood red sky i had to find strength inside to take what's mine so i'll live in vain, and i'll die in time always got tomorrow on my mind some days i'm amazed to see the way you react can't take the pressures of every day i look back upon a life spent waiting and i know that it's hard to get by but that's the price you gotta pay in these goddamned times we'll tempt fate, cheat death suffer and cry (to an empty sky) so i'll live in vain and i'll die in time and if we could live forever we would bury ourselves in time watch this world that we've built burn to the ground burn it down watch this world that we've built as it all falls down to live and die in vain i fucking struggle through a youth defined by defying through a life lived unsatisfied i had to find the strength inside sacrifice yourself to the trials of modern existence be born anew in the bowels of american violence
