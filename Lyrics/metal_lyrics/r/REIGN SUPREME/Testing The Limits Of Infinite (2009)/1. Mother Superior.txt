i just had to let you know it broke my heart to let you go there's something strangling beneath this skyline like treading water in a stormy sea so go and fill your heart now take back your love from me because the world won't wait for regret to set in i'm sorry, i'm sorry forgiveness is an empty promise promise you won't forget me now because i just had to let you know it broke my heart to let you go so send your sinking ship to sea and take back your love from me
