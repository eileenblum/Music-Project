so far from where i should be but this lonely road is all i know a past and future without a present i put my life on hold, see this through and every breath i take brings another dream to life and every day that passes i let it pass me by i'm only halfway human the rest of me is machine i am reborn i am reborn every day that i wake to a foreign sun and every night that "i still miss someone" i am uncomfortable always i'm not alone a temporary home nowhere to call my own watch the world you love you by and i can't help but wonder if it's getting better and you can't help but make things any fucking worse i'm only halfway human the rest of me is machine i am reborn
