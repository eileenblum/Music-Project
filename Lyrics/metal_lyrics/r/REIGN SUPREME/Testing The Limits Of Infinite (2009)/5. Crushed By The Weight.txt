it's always something new the same fucking excuses "i just can't quit" pollute your body to erase your past but physical distraction won't last the weight of your past is crushing you detach yourself from what they did to you and don't let regret swallow you whole the time is now to turn and walk away from all that you can't change so here we go again same story, different situation crushed by the weight of the world that turned it's back on you and so you turn to me and i walk away i walk away i would do anything to make you whole again but i can't change your past and only you can change yourself i won't be here
