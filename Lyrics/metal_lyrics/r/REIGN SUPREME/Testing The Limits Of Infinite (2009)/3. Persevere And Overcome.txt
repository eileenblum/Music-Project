i will bow to no one no gods, no masters to show us mercy in the face of defeat this endless suffering in the kingdom we've created at the cost of the weak and i know that there is no other way but i can never be your savior, your one to blame fear is your god now and i know if can fight this i'll have learned from my mistakes i've lived so blind and careless but now i know the path it takes condemned to hang your head we bleed the same blood, red, red i'm hopeless i will bow to no one fear is your god now goddamn the consequences the empty beds and restless heads reject their great american myth of persevere and overcome i will bow to no one
