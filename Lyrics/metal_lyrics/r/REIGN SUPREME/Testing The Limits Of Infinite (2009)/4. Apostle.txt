goddamn don't you look me in the eyes you've got nothing but a twisted understanding of what it takes to follow your heart you're just an actor playing a part called your bluff straight from the start apostle, appearance is your only salvation believe what you hear from the mouth of madness you surround yourself with a life of emptiness run yourself in circles to try to please the world you're just an actor playing a part the hands of judgement tear you apart apostle, appearance is your only salvation believe what you hear from the mouth of madness the shepherd leads the flock to slaughter but i won't follow they sway the masses like blades of grass i see the weak, they fall to their knees a generation afraid to pay the cost of thy righteous holocaust obey the words of your false gods follow
