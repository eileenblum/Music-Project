And although the world means nothing
Without someone to share it with
So we sleep the night away
And dream of waiting for a brighter day

Only time will change us
Because we didn't change time
Only god will remember us
We'll be forgotten in time

But there's something's far from perfect
We'll promise we will never learn
But we can grow old here together
Watching the world burn

We drift away
We're only meant to see sometimes
We only need to hear our voice
We're only here to speak sometimes
Even when we're [?]

But there's from perfect
So hopefully god will fail
But paradise is probably fiction
So fuck the world and everyone in it

Because it feels like a thousand years
Since I was born
And ever since I was [?]
It was me against the world
Or was it us against them
Or just me against myself (myself)

But it feels like a thousand years
Since I was born
[?]
[?]

We're all dying
We're all dying
Dying to scream
Just sing out loud

All we are is all we ever were
All we are is all we ever were
All we are is all we ever were
All we are is all we ever were

Children pray for better days
[?]

All we are
Travelers on an endless shore
Can't expect the same [?] storm
In dust we trust
In dust we trust

We invite change
We say nothing
In dust we trust
In dust we trust

We invite change
We say nothing
In dust we trust
In dust we trust
In dust we trust
In dust we trust

We invite change
We say nothing
In dust we trust
In dust we trust
In dust we trust
In dust we trust

We invite change
But we should stay the fucking same
In dust we trust
In dust we trust
In dust we trust
In dust we trust
