So blinded that you can't see
That your baby has become a bastard
And your only love is an unfaithful whore
Always on her knees in the pursuit of something more

Watch it burn
Watch it bleed
Watch it die

No faith to keep
No sons to weep
No future
Let the wolves in
They devour what we left

No faith to keep
No sons to weep
No future
Let the wolves in
They devour what we left behind

I hope it dies in your arms
So you know just how it feels
Falter and crumble like the weak mess that you are
And know that I knew all along

Sing your empty words to your empty song
Let the wolves in
Let the wolves in
Let the wolves in

They devour what we left behind

So blinded you can't see
That demons and devotees
Are different names for the same thing

Always on her back in the pursuit of something more

I wanna watch you burn
Nailed to the cross you built
Like a god in your fantasy world

They devour what we left behind
