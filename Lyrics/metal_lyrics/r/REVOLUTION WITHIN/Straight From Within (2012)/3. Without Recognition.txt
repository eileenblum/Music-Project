Sometimes I feel paranoid and confused
My soul is full of hate can't see through my eyes
Don't tell me what to do I know what's wrong
How can I live this life with you by my side?

Hold your breath and wait
Smell and feel my hate
I will leave your face without recognition
This is what I am
Blind and full of rage
I will leave your face without recognition

You have no chance no one escapes from this
My enemies will bleed and then suffocate
In this world in disgrace my strength is my hope
I'm ready for this war I'm ready to kill!

Hold your breath and wait
Smell and feel my hate
I will leave your face without recognition
This is what I am
Blind and full of rage
I will leave your face without recognition

Go! Hold your breath and wait
Smell and feel my hate
I will leave your face without recognition
This is what I am
Blind and full of rage
I will leave your face without recognition
