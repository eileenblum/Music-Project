Don't smile in the face of devil
You never saw nothing like this
Don't come so close just be afraid
There will be danger in your way
Sorrow no return
Sorrow 'til the end

Your fear screams so loud
For those who choose this wayâ¦ Evil(ution)
There is nothing leftâ¦ Evil(ution)

Stand in the edge of life
The risk is high you know the price
Don't claim your soul you know the deal
There is no hope there's no return
Sorrow no return
Sorrow 'til the end

Your fear screams so loud
For those who choose this wayâ¦ Evil(ution)
There is nothing leftâ¦ Evil(ution)

There is nothing left
Look around what you see
You are not aloneâ¦ Coward
Never ending pain
Voices from far away
Whispers in your mindâ¦ Sorrow

Your fear screams so loud
For those who choose this wayâ¦ Evil(ution)
There is nothing leftâ¦ Evil(ution)
