I am the key to set you free from the demons
But first you must believe in me I'll be by your side
This is the place of reckoning behind the walls
Learn with the lessons from the past release the beasts

Release the beasts

Straight from within

This fake life is a mask you decide to wear
You're not abandoned or alone is all in your mind
You can go where you want be confident
It's time to face your fears release the beasts

Release the beasts

This is the place OK reckoning
Release the beasts

Straight from within
Straight from within
