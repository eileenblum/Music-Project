Anger a single word can destroy your life
A cursed word that can become your loss
The choice is yours is in your destiny
You choose is kill or be killed

Don't be a coward or your life is fucked

Unleash the anger â your time has come
Unleash the anger â or you will fail

Your time to hide comes to the end
Release the monsters underneath your bed
The choice is yours is in your destiny
You choose is kill or be killed

Set free your fury don't be a dumb

Unleash the anger â your time has come
Unleash the anger â or you will fail

Anger, anger

Anger a cursed word that can become your loss
You choose is kill or be killed

Set free your fury
Don't be a coward or your life is fucked

Unleash the anger â your time has come
Unleash the anger â or you will fail
