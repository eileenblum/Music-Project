What

What has been sought?
Keeps slipping off through my hands
As I wonder is it worth struggle to
What's throwing goals out of reach?

Pass through the wall
Which shuts out all of my intent?
Barriers holded all around me
It's getting thinner, as it gets tighter in between

That's time to look towards the threat

Right...

Now's time to strike out all my angst

Right...

Now's time to set the anger mode on

... And spar this cruel truth, steadier than ever

Can't waste the chance to get even closer
Can't waste the chance to take it down

"But man is not made for defeat.
A man can be destroyed but not defeated."

Can't waste the chance to get even closer
Can't waste the chance to take it down

Right...

Now's time to strike out all my angst

Right...

Now's time to set the anger mode on
