I will reveal my thoughts
I will reveal my doubts
My hatred will be exposed
I will reveal my hate
Against this faked world
I realized that everything is left behind

Slay! Kill! Destroy it!
I pull the trigger but nobody hears the shot
Slay! Kill! Exterminate!
Pull the trigger 'til explode your fucking head

Someone deserves to die
Someone deserves to pay
My actions won't be denied
I'm not guilty as you feel
I'm not worse than other men
Look inside I'm sure you will find the root

Slay! Kill! Destroy it!
I pull the trigger but nobody hears the shot
Slay! Kill! Exterminate!
Pull the trigger 'til explode your fucking head

I make justice with my hands there is no other way
You are so condemned now it's your time to pay

Slay!
Kill!
Exterminate!

I will reveal my thoughts
I will reveal my doubts
My hatred will be exposed
Someone deserves to die
Someone deserves to pay
My actions won't be denied

Slay! Kill! Destroy it!
I pull the trigger but nobody hears the shot
Slay! Kill! Exterminate!
Pull the trigger 'til explode your fucking head
