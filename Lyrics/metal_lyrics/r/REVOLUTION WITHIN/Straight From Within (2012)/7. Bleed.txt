I'm walking night and day from grave to grave
Searching the ruins of your twisted mind
You want to stay away from this hell
This is no fucking dream

Bleed for me until it hurts
Bleed for me until I see your pain
It's not enough
Bleed for me until you die

Come to me you're living your last day
Your putrid corpse will have no head
Don't expect to rest in peace you'll rest in pain
This is a painful death

Bleed for me until it hurts
Bleed for me until I see your pain
It's not enough
Bleed for me until you die

Come to me you're living your last day
Your putrid corpse will have no head
Don't expect to rest in peace you'll rest in pain
This is a painful death

Bleed for me until it hurts
Bleed for me until I see your pain
It's not enough
Bleed for me until you die
