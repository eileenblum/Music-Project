My eyes will see your look of fear don't waste your time with me
My anger grows ever more it's your time to fight for pride
I want to bring the fire inside so many times I've tried
Your evil ego crossed the line I wish you only living hell

Revengeâ¦ I will crush you! Revengeâ¦ Revenge now!

My desire to spit out these words the goal is to end all this pain
This time there is no turning back my revenge is finally born
I want to bring the fire inside so many times I've tried
Your evil ego crossed the line I wish you only living hell

Revengeâ¦ I will crush you! Revengeâ¦ Revenge now!
Revengeâ¦ I will crush you! Revengeâ¦ Revenge now!

Go!

My eyes will see your look of fear
My anger grows ever more
I want to bring the fire inside
Your evil ego crossed the line

I want to bring the fire inside
Your evil ego crossed the fucking line
