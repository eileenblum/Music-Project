Empty thoughts nothing remains from this life
Without trust you brake without strength you fall
Stay outside nothing can dwell on my way now
Don't ignore me now stop me if you can

We rise throughout our life
But now we struggle to survive
This is a never ending game
Only the stronger will survive

Stay alive time to be in this long road
Learning how to live learning how to kill
Open your eyes this world is nearest to the end
You can run and hide but not disappear

We rise throughout our life
But now we struggle to survive
This is a never ending game
Only the stronger will survive

Forget the blame and look inside
We must stand together until the end

Final breath final chance to save your life
No one escape this doom no one escapes from grave
Recognize we must stand together until the end
Together as one in union we stand

We rise throughout our life
But now we struggle to survive
This is a never ending game
Only the stronger will survive

Only the stronger will survive
Only the stronger will survive

Only the stronger will survive
