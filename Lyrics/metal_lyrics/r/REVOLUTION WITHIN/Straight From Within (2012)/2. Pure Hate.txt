Pure fucking hate!

I hate all this fucking conspiracy
I hate all those liars who fuck our life
I hate all this sad reality
I hope all those bastards will pay for this

Stay away from my sight!
Get out of my way!

Pure fucking hate!

Hate! Feel my hate!
This is something like you've never seen
Pure hate! Pure fucking hate!
Get out of my way or you will pay!

I hate to look inside this fucking shit
I hate to look inside your evil soul
I hate to walk over the pain and blood
I hate to hear lies from your fucking mouth

Stay away from my sight!
Get out of my way!

Hate! Feel my hate!
This is something like you've never seen
Pure hate! Pure fucking hate!
Get out of my way or you will pay

Stay away from my sight!
Get out of my way!

Hate! Feel my hate!
This is something like you've never seen
Pure hate! Pure fucking hate!
Get out of my way or you will pay

Pure fucking hate!

Pure fucking hate!

Pure fucking hate!
