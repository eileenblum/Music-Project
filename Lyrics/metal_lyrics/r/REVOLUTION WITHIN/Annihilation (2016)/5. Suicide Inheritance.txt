Moving in for extermination
Deep repugnant decomposed
I'm misplaced in pandemonium
My existence becomes insane
Stay away from the gates of anguish
Stay away from this void
Smack my face until it bleeds
Erase me from your fate

I can't tolerate this pain
Suicide inheritance

Steer me through the shadows
With splendour and arrogance
In a path blackened by soreness
I'm ready for battles to come
When your body is covered with blood
And your core is no longer filled
There is no turning back
Suicide inheritance

I can't tolerate this pain
Suicide inheritance
I can't tolerate this pain
Suicide inheritance

Come with me to this endless place
Complete pain and total transgression

I can't tolerate this pain
Suicide inheritance
I can't tolerate this pain
Suicide inheritance
