The time refuses to pass, the days are long
The sun never rises since I'm away from dread
Thereâs no way out Iâll always be the same
Iâm constantly running in the same trail

Iâm in hell

I feel the rage growing inside
Vengeance is blaring in my blood
I feel the rage growing inside
Iâm in a fucking hell

This is a new beginning, my time to rise
This is my chance to take it back
I see clarity, inside this foolish world
Perpetual suffering in this dark life

Iâm in hell

I feel the rage growing inside
Vengeance is blaring in my blood
I feel the rage growing inside
Iâm in a fucking hell... hellâ¦ hell

This rage is slaughtering all my body and mind

There is no way out
Iâm in a fucking hell
There is no way out
IÂ´m in a fucking hell

I feel the rage growing inside
Vengeance is blaring in my blood
I feel the rage growing inside
Iâm in a fucking hell

Iâm in a fucking hell

Growing inside
Growing inside
Growing inside
Growing inside
