Welcome to the final warning
Welcome to the final judgment day
The overthrow is about to begin
The overthrow of self devastation

Annihilation
How much further I have to do?
Annihilation

I'll spit my offense and outrage
I'll spit my umbrage and madness from inside
I will collect all your sorrows
I will collect all your angst and erase it

Annihilation
How much further I have to do?
Annihilation

Welcome to the final warning
Welcome to the final judgment day
The overthrow is about to begin
The overthrow of self devastation

I'll spit my umbrage and madness from inside
I will collect all your angst and erase it

Annihilation
How much further I have to do?
Annihilation

Annihilation â The end of all you know
Annihilation â The end of human race
The overthrow is about to begin
Annihilation â Our own devastation
