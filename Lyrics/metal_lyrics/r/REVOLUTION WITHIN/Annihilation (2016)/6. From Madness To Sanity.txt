Madness is killing me
From the deepest of my soul
Paranoia an inner state
I lost my grip on reality

Now I feel madness moving away
I throw my fears to the beasts

Alone I suffocate
My existence becomes grey

Now I feel madness moving away
I throw my fears to the beasts
Back from madness to sanity
All the fears now are gone

Now are gone
Now are gone

Madness is killing me
From the deepest of my soul
Paranoia an inner state
I lost my grip on reality

A mental disorder putted in my back
I will no longer walk alone
Words never spoken packed in my brain
I almost devastate myself

Back from madness to sanity
All the fears now are gone
Back from madness to sanity
All the fears now are gone
