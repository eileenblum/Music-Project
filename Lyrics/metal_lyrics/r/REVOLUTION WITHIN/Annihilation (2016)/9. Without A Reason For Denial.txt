I hear a voice in my head so far away from me
I am misplaced and afraid
I can't bow no more I see the humankind
Collapsing from veracityâ¦ veracity unleashed

World is in denial travelling through fear
This godliness that we obey
Spreading lethal disease; injected with your lies
You born in fear and destructionâ¦ no one can save you

Without a reason for denial
No reason to
Without a reason for denial
You never take it back

You never you never take it back
You never there is nothing left inside
You never you never take it back
You never there is nothing you can do

A voice in my head so far away from me
I am misplaced and afraid
World is in denial travelling through fear
This godliness that we obey
Spreading lethal disease; injected with your lies
You born in fear and destructionâ¦ no one can save you

No one can save you

Without a reason for denial
No reason to
Without a reason for denial
You never take it back

No denial
