Death is in my wits burning up my head
Killing is my will I became a slave
Lost in a deep hole I'll dig your fucking grave
I will take your soul away (from me)

I am not free but I'm by my own
This is my trend this is my choice
Lift your fists and join me in this struggle
I build a fortress around my fate

I came here to stay now it's my time
I am so blind lost in my dreams
Lost in this agony lost in this world
Unreal thoughts unreal despairs

I felt so empty no one cares
Now my fate is in my hands
The seeds of insurrection grow
No one can stop me now

I am not free but I'm by my own
This is my trend this is my choice
Lift your fists and join me in this struggle
I build a fortress around my fateâ¦ Around my fate

I felt so empty no one cares
Now my fate is in my hands
The seeds of insurrection grow
No one can stop me now

I am not free but I'm by my own
This is my trend this is my choice
Lift your fists and join me in this struggle
I build a fortress aroundâ¦

I am not free but I'm by my own
This is my trend this is my choice
Lift your fists and join me in this struggle
I build a fortress aroundâ¦ around my fate
