Sometimes things happen that are just out of your control
Another night, another folly, it's my perception of real facts
It feels to me like chasing a purpose, the purpose of seeing you fall
Like a nightmare, like distress, like the thirst of a manhunt
Like the thirst of a manhunt

I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist
I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist
I will not rest
Until you fall on your own pain
I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist

My rage is locked inside and ready to extinguish you
Your instinct, your vocation, it makes me fucking sick
You want me out of this struggle, but I don't want to leave
Are you ready? Are you fearful? I'm ready to crush you down
I'm ready to crush you down

I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist
I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist
I will not rest
Until you fall on your own pain
I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist

The rage grows up under my feet
I do despise that you still exist
Until you fall on your own pain
I will despise your existence
Your existence

I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist
I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist
I will not rest
Until you fall on your own pain
I don't despise you
I do despise that you still exist
