Epidemic plague nobody is real
Hatred and voracity the supreme deal
Fatal infection I'm out of this grief
Abomination is the greatest belief

Aggressive pictures of anguish
It's my vision, my eye's fixation
Walking away, a betrayed reliance
Follow my way to the judgment day

Creepy thoughts â Ruining my brain
Nothing remains â I see the devil
Creepy thoughts â Ruining my brain
Nothing remains â Until I see the devil dies

Spellbound inside this violent warfare
The war is on there is no home
Learn how to live in this fucking cage
The fury grows inside me

Creepy thoughts â Ruining my brain
Nothing remains â I see the devil
Creepy thoughts â Ruining my brain
Nothing remains â Until I see the devil dies

Spellbound inside this violent warfare
The war is on there is no home
Walking away, a betrayed reliance
Follow my way to the judgment day
To the judgment day

Creepy thoughts â Ruining my brain
Nothing remains â I see the devil
Creepy thoughts â Ruining my brain
Nothing remains â Until I see the devil dies

The devil dies
Dies
