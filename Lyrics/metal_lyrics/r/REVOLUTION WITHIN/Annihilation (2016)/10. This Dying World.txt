Depressing moments of our lives
The common story of hurt and loss
The doors are opened cause I choose my path
Nothing to say, I make the rules

Don't, don't expect for mercy
Don't, don't beg for your life
While you see desolation in your existence
I see brightness inside this dying world

My body and mind are totally exhausted
All my life I really hurt myself
Your weakness means nothing to me
You are the weak I am the strong

This dying world
While you see desolation in your existence
I see brightness inside this dying world

My body and mind are totally exhausted
All my life I really hurt myself
I really hurt myself
Your weakness means nothing to me
You are the weak I am the strong
I'm the strong

Depressing moments of our lives
The common story of hurt and loss
The doors are opened cause I choose my path
Nothing to say, I make the rules

Don't, don't expect for mercy
Don't, don't beg for your life
While you see desolation in your existence
I see brightness inside this dying world
