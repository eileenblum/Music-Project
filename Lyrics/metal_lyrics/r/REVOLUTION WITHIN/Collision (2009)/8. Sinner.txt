God... save... me... I want to believe in you
Please... help... me... to understand you

I can't believe what I see
We live in one fucked up world
So many lies cause me fear
I just wish to disappear

War... fights... pain... I'm sick of this
Don't... judge... me... I'm just a man

Time to stop these confrontations
Time to say that's enough
So many lies cause me fear
I just wish to disappear

God...
I can't see you... I can't hear you...
Please forgive me... I'm a sinner...

God... save... me... I want to believe in you
Please... help... me... to understand you
I'm sick of this... I'm just a man... God!

God!
