We all have fucking dreams that sometimes became true
That's why we are too ambitious because we want some more
Don't think that I'm crazy I tell you no fucking way

Now it's not a dream, now it's not the same
Who you think you are? You are not a God... No way

Always looking for a reason to begin a new fight
Rules were made to be broken that's the way we live our life
Don't expect me to surrender I am ready for the war

We all have fucking dreams that sometimes became true
Rules were made to be broken that's the way we live our life
Never say that we're losers we are better than you

Through these words of denial
Your point of view almost prevail
Every day we get even stronger
Your words make no sense any longer

We all have fucking dreams that sometimes became true
That's why we are too ambitious because we want some more
Don't think that I'm crazy I tell you no fucking way

Now it's not a dream, now it's not the same
Who you think you are? You are not a God

Now it's not a dream, now it's not the same
Who you think you are? You are not a God... No way
