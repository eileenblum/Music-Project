I will stand tall

I will stand tall to face what you call the real world
You see the damage all around but you really never care
You don't know... How I feel... with all this hypocrisy
You think I see a precious life but all I see is cold and dark

The faith is always there... You know that
Look inside yourself... You will see

I never waste my time with unnecessary words
You know me I only speak with people who deserve
I despise... I ignore... The selfish and the weak
I'm so tired to be a piece in this fucking stupid game

Look inside yourself... You will see

Born... Die... This is our destiny
Right... Wrong... Parallel diversity

I will stand tall to face all the poor philosophy
I don't care what people say I never will be down
They don't know... They don't know the meaning of a life
They just care about their filthy hypocrisy

Look inside yourself... You will see

Born... Die... This is our destiny
Right... Wrong... Parallel diversity

Born... Die... This is our destiny
Right... Wrong... Parallel diversity

I will stand tall I will stand tall to face it I will stand tall
I will stand tall I will stand tall to face it I will stand tall

I'll stand! I'll stand! I'll stand! I'll stand!
