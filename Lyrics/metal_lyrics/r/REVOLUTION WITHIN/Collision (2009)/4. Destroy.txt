I wanna destroy everything in front of me
It's so depressing this feeling here
Cause I feel so anger cause I feel so pain
Come here and taste it
You tried to kill all of my soulÂ 
But you should swallow my words
Look at my eyes and see my hate for you
You will pay for this fucking truth

Destroy, Destroy, Destroy, Destroy

My little patience is over
I can't wait for miracles
My thirst of revenge it's so huge
And I'll see you in hell
I want to see your tears of blood
I know I'm bad but it's your fault
Cause you hurt me so many times
But now I gonna change your life

Destroy, Destroy, Destroy, Destroy

Destroy, don't say that you're a weak, I don't care
Destroy, time to hear my voice, I'm talking to you
Destroy, I am not your enemy, can't you see?
Destroy, the way to save your mind, be yourself

I wanna destroy everything in front of me
It's so depressing this feeling here
Cause I feel so anger cause I feel so pain
Come here and taste it
You tried to kill all of my soul
But you should swallow my words
Look at my eyes and see my hate for you
You will pay for this fucking truth

Destroy, Destroy, Destroy, Destroy
