I don't understand why I feel so
Disappointed and frustrated
With a desire of destruction and pain
I think this world it's not for me
Disillusion and confusion
Things that make this place a shit

I'm surrounded by evil
The anger is inside of me
I'm surrounded by evil
The evil is inside of you

I lost my soul and lost my mind
Emptiness loneliness
Why I feel we kill this world
Where is my strength where is my hope
I was blind but now I see
I believe we will resist

I'm surrounded by evil
The anger is inside of me
I'm surrounded by evil
The evil is inside of you

I don't understand why I feel so
Disappointed and frustrated
With a desire of destruction and pain
Where is my strength where is my hope
I was blind but now I see
I believe we will resist

I'm surrounded by evil
The anger is inside of me
I'm surrounded by evil
The evil is inside of you

Surrounded by evil
Surrounded by evil
Surrounded by evil
