The mystery of our destiny
Just show us the insanity
My own desire is to throw up the feelings
That I have inside me
It seems that everything
It happens is my fault
I was dreaming all this time
But now I'm drowned in this pain

Silence... and lies... that always burned our souls
Without... leaving... an ash

My silence will be the last thing... you'll hear
My silence will be the last thing... you'll fucking hear

Today I'm scared to wake up
My heart no longer holds this reality
I have been betrayed by life
And everything what I believe
It seems I sold my soul to the devil
To get something from this life
I avoid hurting your feelings
You did it without watching back

Silence... and lies... that always burned our souls
Without... leaving... an ash

My silence will be the last thing... you'll hear
My silence will be the last thing... you'll fucking hear

Can you hear my silence?
Can you feel the silence?

Silence... and lies... that always burned our souls
Without... leaving... an ash

My silence will be the last thing... you'll hear
My silence will be the last thing... you'll fucking hear
