Time is the healerCreator of scarsI'm a disbelieveraiming for the stars I know it's hard to findbut it's harder to be kindYou know I ain't got timefor another troubled mind Time is the stealerLike a fast racing carI'm a dreamerin a sleazy bar I know it's hard to findbut it's harder to be kindYou know I ain't got timefor another troubled mind Hard to hold on toSomething worth holding on toIt's hard to be strong, to get alongwhen fools think you're wrong
