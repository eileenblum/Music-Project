Don't wanna be hereDon't wanna be hereI don't belong hereNo I don't belongAll of this is wrongGot to turn my back and runNo room for me hereNot room for me hereI cannot breathe hereNo I need some spaceGot to turn to someplace safeWhere I can be myselfNothing said, nothing to hearNothing done, nothing to fearDidn't say anything, took no standLeft me with nothing but empty hands
