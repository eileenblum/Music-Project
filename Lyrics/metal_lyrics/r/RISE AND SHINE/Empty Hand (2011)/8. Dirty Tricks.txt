Why couldn't you be honest?Why couldn't you be straight?Why couldn't you just speak the truth?The truth and nothing elseNo I think I know your kindI think I've met you beforeYou'll never be satisfiedYou always wanna get more You turn your sails to the windIt's a sin to see it, it's a sinTo see you turn your sails to the wind You always try to get around thingstwisting like a snakeJust to rise a step or twoyou'll do anything it takes'Cause you wanna reach the top,you wanna grow real strongAnd I know what smell it isthat keeps you carrying me You think you're hard as stoneYou think I'm too blind to seethrough all those dirty tricksthat you try to play on meBut I'm not afraid of youI've learnt my lesson wellTry to walk over me againand I'll send you down to hell I'm gonna crack your ugly shellIf you try to fool me again'Cause I'm not afraid of youAnd I can tell how you turn those sailsIt's a sin to see it, it's a sin,to see you turn your sails to the wind
