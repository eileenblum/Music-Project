Since I was a child I've always been toldI talk too much, too fast, too loud- Keep it low, hold it back, stay downStay down, hold it back, keep it low I thought you all would like to see me downWas so sure you all would like to see me down'Cause I knew you all would like to see me downI was sure you all would like to see me down'Cause I know you all go crazywhen someone tries to live those dreamsI know you all go crazyIt's not allowed to break free This life was given to meBelieve you just live onceLook at me I got so much to giveI got to give it all before I'm done I wanna feel, I wanna feel for realI wanna shine so you all can seeI'm gonna rise above all my fearsI wanna live, I wanna live for real It's the fight for being part ofwhen you're still always on your ownIt's the fight for staying honestwhen a lie's so easily toldIt's the fight between givingand the fear of what there is to loseIt's the fight believingwhen there's so much to doubt I wanna feel, I wanna feel for realI wanna shine so you all can seeI'm gonna rise above all my fearsI wanna live, I wanna live for real This life was given to meBelieve you just live onceLook at me I got so much to giveI got to give it all before I'm done
