I didn't wanna do it
But I did it anyway
My mama said I blew it
But I said screw it babe

You know lately I've done a lot of thinking
Though most of the time I've been drinking
You got to give it what you got
or you might as well not
When I'm over the top remind me not to forget
that I have no regrets
in the arms of death

You said you all knew it
That I had to pay
But I won't get down and pray
No it's a game I choose to play

You know lately I've done a lot of thinking
Though most of the time I've been drinking
You got to give it what you got
or you might as well not
So please remind me not to forget
that I have no regrets
in the arms of death
