If you've always been a fighteralthough you tend to loseIf you always lit a new hopeand now you've lost the glowWhen all the words are emptyWhen nothing reaches insideWhen you heard your voice so many timesthat it has lost its shine Oh, where can you turn to?What can you do?When pain doesn't hurt no moreTell me is that bad, is that all? If you always held your head highalthough you've been a step behindIf you always knew you'd get thereand now you've lost the trackWhen all the dreams have fadedWhen nothing seems to touch you anymoreWhen the pictures and the truths you toldgot lost along the road Oh, where can you turn to?What can you do?When pain doesn't hurt no moreTell me is that bad, is that all? If you always had it in youalthough it's been hard to grabIf you always were so certainand now you start to doubtWhen reality's there to haunt youWhen you are turning scaredWhen you realize you lost the faithand that was all you had
