It's my love, it's my hate
It's my destiny and fate
And I know it's too late

It's my life, it's my all
It's my rise, it's my fall
And it's hard to stand tall
When you hear the gods call

It's like falling in darkness I don't have a choice
Blinded I follow my soul's inner voice
The creation of harmony and noise
