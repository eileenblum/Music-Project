Sell yourself to get what you needPocket your pride and keep up with the speedThe only one to blame is you - if you loseWinner or loser - you're the one to choose No, no, nothing is fairNo, no, nothing is fair'Cause what you get is always someone else's shareWhat you take is someone else's share We all get our share and all this is mineSo stand in the line and please keep behind'Cause baby you're a beggarand that will keep you downThey say we all get a fair chanceand you turned your down But what if nothing is fairNo, no, nothing is fairWhat if what I get is someone else's share?What I take is someone else's share? No, no, nothing is fairNo, no, nothing is fair'Cause what you get is always someone else's shareWhat you take is someone else's share
