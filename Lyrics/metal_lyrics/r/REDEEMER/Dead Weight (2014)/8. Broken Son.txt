Another broken son from a broken home.
Another troubled youth with nowhere to go.
You're no more a man than I am your child.
You're just another crook with a crooked smile.
Who do you think you are,
tearing my family apart?
I will not call you father.
Don't you call me son.
You are no father and I'm no fool to what you've done.
You're a snake in the grass.
Don't play the martyr with a murderous past.
I used to call that house my home.
You're not welcome here; give up the ghost.
The memories we made before that man destroyed everything.
My father held me in that room.
But my mother's eyes were fixed on you.
Leave well enough alone.
Another broken son from a broken home.
I've become a man despite you.
Another troubled youth, but I'll make it through.
Violent and angry.
I am the way you made me
and I'll never be the same,
but I'm better off that way.
So, tell me, was your fling worth it?
Does he make you feel alive?
Do you see the face of my father when you look in my eyes?
Can you look in my eyes?
Another broken son from a broken home.
Another troubled youth, with nowhere to go.
I've become a man despite you.
Another troubled youth, but I'll make it through.
I'll make it through.
