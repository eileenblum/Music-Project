Another town, another down.
I've never felt as alive as I do now.
I don't know if I'll ever go back.
Give me twenty heads in a dim-lit basement.
Fort Ryland nights. The California backyard that made me.
The open road can take me.
I wouldn't trade this for anything.
We'll never be the same.
The friends we made.
We sang along.
The Colorado smoke screen lingered on.
I found life in that eerie wooden shack
that once harbored death.
The van. The overnight drives.
The starry skies.
This is my life, my love, my everything.
Don't let the open road take me back.
I wouldn't trade this for anything.
We'll never be the same.
And we all knew Wolf never stood a chance.
I'd trade these luxuries for a crowded van.
This is all I live for: this is my everything.
This is all I'm good for: this is all that's left for me.
The open road can take me.
This is all I live for: this is my everything.
This is all I'm good for: this is all that's left for me.
Give me twenty heads in a dim-lit basement.
Fort Ryland nights. The California backyard that made me.
I wouldn't trade this for anything.
We'll never be the same.
