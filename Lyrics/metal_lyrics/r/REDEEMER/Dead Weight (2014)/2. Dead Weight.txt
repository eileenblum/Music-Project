Sadness set in around sunset.
Uninvited, yes.
But it's all in how you handle it.

I've seen better days, but I'm trying to mend.
The candle can only burn at both ends for so long.
Dead weight is pulling me under.

Sink or swim,
I dig the grave I've been living in.
When I lived through hell, I found there's far worse things than death.
What if I'm waiting for a peace that I can't have?
What if they're right and I pushed that grace out of grasp?

The silence is deafening.
The misery is setting in.
I fear that I'm just making waves...
To keep from drowning in unhappiness.
The silence is deafening.
The misery is setting in.
I feel myself sinking again.
Suffer to survive.

The grass was never green on either side.
I think of nothing but I,
And focus only on the shadows when the sun shines.
Growing up,
I found out nothing was good enough.
I'll fight my way to the surface or bust.
Under the weight of hopelessness, feeling crushed.
Can't give in to giving up.

This world showed me no love.
I bit the bullet and toughened up.
They'll give you nothing, their words are vacant.
This life is what you make it.
