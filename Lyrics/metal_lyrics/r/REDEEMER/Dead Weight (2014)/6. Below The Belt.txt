You call yourself a friend, but you'd turn on me in a heartbeat.
In the midst of slander, you're the last to speak.
When it's blow for blow, you'd be the last to swing.
Last to swing.
You're worse than the worst of them.
And when you're needed most, you'll be the worst of friends.
Respect doesn't mean a thing.
To a fraud, loyalty means nothing.
When you need me next, remember what you did.
When you turned your back on someone you called friend.
I called you brother.
You abandoned me.
How dare you say I never have your back?
I gave you everything.
But you still walked away.
I'm done.
This is the last time; bending over backwards to say goodbye.
My trusted ally,
you left me to die.
You call yourself a friend, but you'd turn on me in a heartbeat.
In the midst of slander, you're the last to speak.
When it's blow for blow, you'd be the last to swing.
Last to swing.
