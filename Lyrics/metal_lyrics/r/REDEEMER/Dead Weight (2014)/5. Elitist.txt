Your family is no family to me.
You preach unity like you know what it means.
So call me a newjack, an outcast.
You're another elitist.
I'll be the back of your pack.
The self-esteem boost that you needed.
Elitist.
Stake your claim with the cowards.
Get your kicks on your false sense of power.
Choose your enemies wisely.
You turn your nose up at the likes of me.
Elitist: hierarchical waste of time.
No friend of mine.
Elitist: shun one, shun the family.
Step to them, step to me.
I've had enough.
You're no better than me.
You're no better than us.
Unity.
Respect.
Weed out the arrogant.
Protect what's left.
