Destructive seeds sprout best from the back row of seats.
I'm trying my best to forgive the body that forgot me.
I don't live in fear or crumble at the feet of a tyrant.
I was never called to judge the non-compliant.
Hate for its own sake is blindness.
I was never your enemy.
Condemnation was never my place.
"God is love" doesn't mean that some don't make the cut.
I've never known grace to mean that a good man is not enough.
Hell has raged inside.
I boasted faith when I was scared to die.
Now, I see that salvation isn't part of a bargain I'm holding up.
I was never your enemy.
Condemnation was never my place.
If you only know God as a judge,
I'd rather meet him by gavel than live on the run.
