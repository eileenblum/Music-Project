I was once so alive and the world was so colorful.
If I open my eyes will the color return?
I know this hurricane.
I've felt these waves.
Will You calm the storm in me?
I can't help but think this is only routine.
I bow my head but where is my faith?
Where do my words fall?
Am I the last thing on Your mind?
Do You overlook Your children's cries?
Give me a sign,
so I know that I'm not walking blindly.
I'm struggling.
Show me that I haven't left Your arms.
Have I left Your arms?
I'm broken.
I'm dying
Is this what You wanted?
This storm isn't letting up.
I thought I was stronger than this;
I wont make it.
I say amen time again,
it's still raining.
Why is it raining?
You've kept me alive this long.
You know my weaknesses.
God, keep me strong.
Then I hear Your voice in the breeze.
I can feel the angel's wings around me.
Your love surrounds me.
When I curse your name with the breath you gave.
When I cast all blame on my creator.
I've done everything.
I've done everything to make you turn against me.
How could you love me now?
But You love my when I am weak.
You love me when I'm broken.
When I doubt Your name, I forget everything you gave.
You love me the same.
