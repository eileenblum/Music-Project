I was a prisoner before these steel bars
My life was gone before this concrete box
I was dead inside, before I took his life
I had a baby boy and a wife, everything I loved died that night
If there's something or someone stronger than my pain
Can you hear me screaming? Why aren't you answering?
I've watched a man die at my hand, I am misery
I'm as dead as a screaming man could ever be
I'd give anything to hold my son again
I'd give anything for it to be me in that car instead
Helpless a broken man, slipping through the cracks
I've killed for them, I'll die for them, but I can't bring them back
I'm as dead as a screaming man could ever be
