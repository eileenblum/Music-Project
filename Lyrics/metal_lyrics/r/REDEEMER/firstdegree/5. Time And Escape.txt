I've been confined for ten winters now
Cold world, a cold man getting by somehow
I'm a dead man walking through these concrete halls
A mark a week for ten years on these prison walls
I've heard of a saving grace, but that grace hasn't set me free
and the holy book they gave hasn't done much speaking
I know there must something stronger than my pain
I need more than a faceless name, I want to believe
So this is the first time we have talked
I'm drowning in sorrow, You know everything I've lost
Does my salvation rest on things I've done
If I run to you, are you quick to judge?
I'm laying everything down
They say You can take my pain and erase mistakes somehow
My wife and son are waiting, I'm waiting to be there
more than anything I need peace and I can't find it here
God of grace and hope, make yourself known
I'm tired of trying, I can't make it on my own
I was a prisoner before these steel bars
My life was gone before this concrete box
Ten years of being dead inside
Ten years of haunting thoughts and restless nights
There's nothing left for me here
I'm tired of hate
take everything I am away
That I could see Your beauty, and others see You through me
All I am is at Your feet
Breathe life into me
I'm done with emptiness; hollow shell of a man's regrets
create a melody, that I could sing Your praise
I can feel You in this place
