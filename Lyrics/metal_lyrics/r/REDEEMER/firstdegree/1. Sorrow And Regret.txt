Family meant everything before my family was gone
and I thought I could push through, but I could only stay so strong
She was beautiful as ever, even screaming as she left
but when she went she took the children and I haven't seen them since
Innocent and perfect, they were everything I had
but I don't deserve a family and I can't outrun my past
so I stayed sober for a year and drank the other five away
because the whiskey feels like comfort and the bottle always stays
When i'm drunk I don't feel anything which feels alot like peace
It keeps my finger off the trigger but the steel between my teeth
Barkeep the bottle, I'll drink to misery
Deadbeat; forgotten, not the man that I used to be
Why hope for tomorrow? I can drown myself today
I was once a father. We were once a family
No home, no reason to live and no hope
I'm back to the poison that made her go
Two days from now, six years ago, I can't forget
Who cares if I make it home?
Fifth of Jack for a lonely ride
I never even saw the sign
God, what have I done?
I was dead before I took their lives
They aren't breathing
Young girl and her child son
I couldn't save them
But how could I run?
Somebody's family, somebody's wife, somebody's child, I've ruined someone's life
It's bad enough i've taken everything I had
How could I kill and drive on past? (What a coward I am)
I would give anything to put that bottle down
I would give anything, for everything i've lost somehow
I'm so sorry, I could never fix my mistakes
I beg forgiveness now, I wouldn't expect acceptance
I'm alive somehow. I would not blame them if they end it
I've ruined lives and pushed everyone that I loved to the side
I've been destroyed by my vices
These addictions have prices
I could never say enough
Can't right all the wrong I've done
I've left bodies in my wake
I'm so sorry
