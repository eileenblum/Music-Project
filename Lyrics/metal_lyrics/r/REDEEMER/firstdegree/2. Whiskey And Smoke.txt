Whiskey and Smoke at the end of the road, and I know i'll never hold my wife and son again
Misery overwhelms, if there's a god up in heaven, He put me in hell
December 24th, the love of my life and our precious child were out on the road, blacktop covered in snow
a knock on the door, the men in blue suits, "We're telling you now son, you might want to sit down.
Fall Creek Road, 6:45, your address on the license, I think it's your wife and son.
It was a drunk hit and run, and trust me we're looking." (You're not looking hard enough)
"We found her car on the road. They were hit from the side, and we're sorry but neither survived"
If you know this man tell me now, the bar quiets down
A miserable silence rings out
He took everything I loved, it's his fault alone
the closest I'll come to holding my child is holding a headstone
The bartender slides a shot of the strongest stuff money can buy but it's not enough
He says, "Ten minutes before the wreck a regular here, Edward Cass, had just left
he was drunk and I know, he takes Fall Creek Road and lives in the broken down house on the corner
Now that you mention it, I heard someone say his car was destroyed, he barely made it home."
Now the murderer's down the road, he'll remember my name with a knife to his throat or atleast broken bones
I down the last of a glass and head on
Driving as fast as I can go, nothing to lose
who cares if I make it home
Tonight I'll look in the eyes of the drunken fool that took my pride and joy last night
I'll make him pay somehow
Nothing heals in time and the lives that he took will eat him alive
How can I look in a monster's face
He doesn't know my pain, but I'll make him pay
Pulling up to his place of escape
Ready to fight and ruin his life like mine
His truck is a mangled mess, if he thinks he knows suffering...
He knows nothing yet
