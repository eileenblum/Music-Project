Line up. No survivors, no way. Thereâll be no survivors today. Line up, face front, eyes down.  Line up, donât make a sound.  Line up, youâll do as youâre told.  Line up, now get in the ground.  The only question now is who will go first to suffer lead poisoning - 230g worth.  All bleeding stops eventually.  Line up and march on, one after another.  March on, donât look at each other.  March on, donât expect to go much further.  What doesnât kill you makes you wish it did.
