I refuse the saviors role.  I tow no oneâs rope.  I am no oneâs hero, nor anyoneâs hope.  Iâm no torchbearer.  I carry no oneâs light.  I am no manâs keeper, nor any manâs acolyte.  Kick, scratch and bite from underneath. The body carries the head, the head carries the jaw, the jaw carries the teeth.  I fail to fall silent, to keep my tongue still.  My voice is an acid; when I speak it spills.  Iâll meet you three ways if you challenge me: ferally, destructively, ceaselessly.  Kick, scratch and bite from underneath.  The body carries the head, the head carries the jaw, the jaw carries the teeth. Antagonist, I know you so well.  You wonât see me coming and Iâll see you in hell.  Count your days.  Youâll need but one hand.  I bid a venomous farewell.  Iâll see you in hell.
