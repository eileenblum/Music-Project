I couldnât give a fuck if the sun never rises again.  Abandoning everything in desperation. Thatâs what I fucking get for believing.  Completely embracing ruination.  Despite the odds I keep breathing.  I couldnât give a fuck if the sun never rises again.  I fail to overcome the sense that something is left undone.  I hope the sun never rises again.
