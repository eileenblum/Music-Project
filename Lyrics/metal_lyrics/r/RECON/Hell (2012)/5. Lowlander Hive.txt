A fire-filled syringe hanging from a lifeless arm, plunger half pushed in. Where do I begin?  Spit on me once and I tell you - Iâll spit on you two times. Iâll spit on you when I fuck you, Iâll spit on you when you die. The lowlander hive.  Shake my scorched form into ruin.  Mothers and hookers, daughters and wives, thereâs enough in the needle for you and the rest of your hive.  Spit on me once and I tell you Iâll spit on you two times.  Iâll spit on you when I fuck you, Iâll spit on you when you die.  Swallowed by ruin they starve and deprive.  Crowded by humans, swarmed by the hive.
