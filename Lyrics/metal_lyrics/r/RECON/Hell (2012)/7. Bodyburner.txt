We are Gods. The keepers shall tremble. Their pillars crumble to dust from marble. Their destruction justifiable. Over those they consume, the flames are lambent, tiding shifts of reason through vengeance and judgment. Fireâs form leaves nothing unclaimed, and in its form, your every name.  Oil the wood, stack the tyrants high. Bury the flesh of our governors in the fires of our fathers, bodyburner.
