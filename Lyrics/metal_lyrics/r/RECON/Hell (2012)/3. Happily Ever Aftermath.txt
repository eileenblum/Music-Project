These are the words of a dead man.  Try your best to convince me that all this isnât a joke.  We pretend to be free and alive but we are all in the yoke.  Under illusion that what we do means something, eventually all is leveled to nothing.  Blind me.  This place is a terror to my eyes.  Abandon me to my fate.  For me itâs far too late.  Reluctant to believe that thereâs a future reserved for me.  No plan for tomorrow, no exit strategy.  What attempts to rise will fall, and now Iâm waiting for the goddamned end of it all.  Blind me.  This place is a terror to my eyes.  Abandon me to my fate.  For me itâs far too late.  Iâve got to believe Iâm on the verge of something.  Itâs the only thing that keeps me going.
