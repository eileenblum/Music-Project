[DeRoque / Ochoa]

Cold places
Empty faces stare at me
In my dreams
I see them looking
The things that haunted
Scaring me with my past
I wonder if I'll make it
I wonder how this could be
Will I ever get out of here
Will I ever be set free
I know your name in life
Help me speak it in my dreams
In my, in my dreams (You are always with me) in my, in my dreams
They're coming to get me
Oh there's no where to hide
Then You show and reveal Your power to me
Shadow's break then
I've learned quickly
All your power to see
Comes to life when I speak your name
All the demons they flee
I know your name in life
Help me speak it in my dreams
In my, in my dreams...
