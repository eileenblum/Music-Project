[Christianson / Ochoa / Roberts / Ronson / Starline]

Yes it's true you are a believer
But you've been fooled by the lame deceiver
Sex and dugs and rock n' roll
The pleasures of life
Will take it's toll on you
And you know deep inside you can't hide
You must try to
Feel the fire
Burning desire
Fan into the flame
The fire that can never die
Feel the fire
Burning desire
Take hold of the Sword
The Word of life
The armor of God to prepare you for the fight
Take time to pray
Come back to stay
Let Jesus Christ complete His work in you
And you know
Deep inside
You can't hide
You must try to
Feel the fire...
Feel the fire...
Feel the fire burn
