[Ochoa / Roberts]

Wasted time my friend
Don't' you know we're in the bitter end
He's coming back again
To save us all from this world of sin
Christ the Savior, He'll set you free
Christ died for Sins
Come and receive
Rise
It's your decision
Choose this day whom you will serve
Come and confess Him
Jesus Christ
The only way
Ask Him in today
Emotional leaders are coming down
New Age logic
That lies been around
Religious society
It's insanity
A hope for you and me
Christ the Savior, He'll set you free
Christ die for sins, come and receive
Rise
It's your...
Rise
It's your... in your heart He'll stay
