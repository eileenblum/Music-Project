[Ochoa / Roberts]

The prophet had a dream
Four beast from the sea
Mystery what could this mean
Four mighty nations will rise to conquer and rule the world
In time you'll see
Their powers will die
God's kingdom reigns forever
It shall forever never fall
I have seen the vision Ancient of Days
Power, the glory, the gift, the prophecy
Can you see His visions
Ancient of Days
One comes from the East
The dragon that gives power to the beast
One world system soon to arrive
Fear God give Him the glory
He calls with a voice of thunder
Judgement has come
The kingdom's at hand
God's kingdom reigns forever
It shall forever never fall
I have seen...
I am He who lives and was dead
Behold I live forevermore
Mighty nations rise to conquer and rule the world
When He returns
The Godless will die
God's kingdom reigns forever
It shall forever never fall
I have seen...
