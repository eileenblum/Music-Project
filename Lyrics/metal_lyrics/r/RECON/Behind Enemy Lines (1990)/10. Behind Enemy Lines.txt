[Brown / Ochoa]

Recon, an elite force
Highly trained for war
Armed and dangerous
The enemy is no match
For a warrior of God
Come and join the soldiers of the light
Be prepared to tread dangerous ground and to fight
Behind enemy lines
Behind enemy lines
Soldier, take up your arms and use your weapon well
There's a battle field
Warfare
A faith waiting to be won
Come and join the soldiers of the light
Be prepared to tread dangerous ground and to fight
Behind enemy lines...
Recon, an elite...
Behind enemy lines...
