[Ochoa / Ronson]

Lord take us away, we're looking to be set free
For we believe Your word, that You'll return
Like you said one day
In a blink of an eye
Trumpets will sound
Dead in Christ will arise
You will come back for your bride
Take us away like a thief in the night
Take us away
From this world of hurt
Sorrow and pain
Take us away
Take us away
If I die tonight
I know that I'll be with you
I pray I'd live my life as though you'll come each and every day
In a blink of an eye...
Take us away...
Though I seem impatient
Lord Jesus come Quickly
I just can't wait until that day
I see your face
Take us away...
