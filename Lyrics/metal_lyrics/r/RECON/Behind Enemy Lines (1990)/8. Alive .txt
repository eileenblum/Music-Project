[Ochoa / Roberts / Ronson]

I know how you feel
Empty, sad and lonely
You try booze and pills but in the end you're empty
Living life like a wounded child
You've been deceived
God's hand stretched across the sea
For you and me
Let's start to live
Live for the King
It is written
He is alive
He is alive
Believe what say for he will never lie to you
Power, glory and selfishness
Won't set you free
Let's start to live
Live for the King
It is written
He is alive He is alive
He is risen
He is alive
He is alive
Like a dream I feel so free
I love the Lord in me
By my faith my love grows strong
Oh He's so mighty
His kingdom is at hand
Repent
Believe and be saved
By his love we must stand
It's time to live
Live for the King
He is alive...
