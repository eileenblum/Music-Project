A mass grave of nameless
Were they ever alive?
Every day brings a new disease
There's nowhere left to turn
So they start to turn back
Nothing will last on this earth
We are all damned
We're all damned by murder
We are all damned
We're all damned by hatred
Fuck
The end is near
Line us up, gun us down
The end is near
We are the sacrifice
There is no time left
There is no fucking hope
And when all is said and done
No one was remembered
Cover us with a flood
This is finally over
