This won't end well
If it ever ends
Fucking sellout
I can't believe I called you friend
I'll see your eyes bleeding those worthless tears
Where's the dedication?
Where's the trust?
Every fucking day is a new regret
I'll watch you fade away
The only ground you've gained is a fucking grave
There's no more running scared
This is the end
No more 90 days
Take your last breath
I'll see your eyes bleeding those worthless tears
Look where this ended
Look whose back is turned on us
No surprise you fucked us all
You were always worthless
You always win, you always win
This is a loser's game
You'll die by your own knife
You'll die today
This world holds nothing loyal
