And I would have to suffocate myself
And kill everybody else
Just to tolerate this earth
Fuck the world
Bury the earth in the ashes of humanity
I will feast on the glory of the mass extinction
Straight to the gallows.
Nothing is safe
Everyone suffers
No one escapes
Lines have been crossed
No one is innocent
Welcome to the execution
Playing god never felt so fucking good
I wish every step I take was on the face of someone great
Just so they could feel the pain I feel every day
You are marked with hate
You fucking disgrace
And I would have to suffocate myself
And kill everybody else
Just to tolerate this earth
Bury the earth in our ashes
There is no hope for the human race
Nothing is safe
Extermination is the only answer to rid us of this plague
