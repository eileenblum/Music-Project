Everything you said to me
You said in vein
You lied to me just to get what you wanted
You left me for dead
You left me to suffer
Suffer inside
Do you remember my face?
Do you remember what you did to me?
You left me to rot
You left me for dead
Everything you said to me
You said in vein
You lied to me just to get what you wanted
You left me for dead
You left me to suffer
Now you'll get what you deserve
Do you remember my face?
Do you remember what you did?
Everything you said to me
You said in vein
You lied to me just to get what you wanted
You left me for dead
You left me to suffer
