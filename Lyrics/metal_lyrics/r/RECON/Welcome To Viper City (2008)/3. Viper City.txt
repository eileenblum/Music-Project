What's it like to be dead?
What's it like to be nothing?
This life has bled you dry
It's left you cold and alone
Now you're dead
There's nothing left
You ran away from your life
Now you have nothing left
What's it like to be empty?
I stand alone, no other way
I stand alone, poison free
Straight Edge
My pledge
Straight edge
My vow
And now this life has washed you away
There's no one left to help you
There's no one left to blame but yourself
What's it like to be empty?
What's it like to be nothing?
This is the end of you
I stand alone, no other way
I stand alone, poison free
How does it feel to be the most meaningless?
