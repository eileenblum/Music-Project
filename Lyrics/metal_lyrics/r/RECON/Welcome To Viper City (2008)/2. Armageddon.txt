Wait
Take a look at yourself
Tell me if you still think you're so great
I will show you
You will fucking fail
You've seen your last precious ray of light
this is the score to your demise
And you can't run or hide
No you can't run or hide
You think this is all my fault
You're the fucking failure and you know it
Good job burning every bridge
Now you will pay for what you did
Hope it was fucking worth it
Run from all of this
Turn your back on me
Keep praying that I won't live up to all of my dreams
I'll be laughing when you bury yourself
Bitch, bury yourself
