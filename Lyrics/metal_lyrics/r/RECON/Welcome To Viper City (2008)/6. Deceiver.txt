I don't know why I continue to waste my time
But this ends right now
I can see the fear in your eyes
I can see you're dead inside
And I hope this tears you apart
I am a monster
I feel nothing
I don't know why I continue to waste my time
But this ends right now
I can see the fear in your eyes
I can see you're dead inside
And when you fuck your way to the top
I will be there to shut you down
This is what I've become
I am a monster
I feel nothing
I am the master of deformity without a shameful conscience
Demoralized by nothing
Without the reigns of my blind decisions
Amidst a plague is salvation within
