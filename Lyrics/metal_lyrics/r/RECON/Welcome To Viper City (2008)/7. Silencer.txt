I will crush your world
What will you do when everything you care for is destroyed?
Will you act unfazed?
You brought this on yourself
I'm not sorry
Enjoy your pointless life
I'm living your dream
You're living a nightmare
Lost in your lies and failures
They're pulling you under
So take a bow
I hope you're fucking proud
I'll watch you sink to the depths of your hell
To the depths of your fucking hell
And as far as I'm concerned
You're already a corpse
I will crush your world
What will you do when everything you care for is destroyed?
Will you act unfazed?
You brought this on yourself
I'm not sorry
Enjoy your pointless life
