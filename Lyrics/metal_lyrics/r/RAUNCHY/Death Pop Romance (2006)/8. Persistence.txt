This is just me
Nothing more and nothing less
It feels like the world is watching me
But my world is laid to waste
Persistence to the end
Persistence to the end
This is just me
Nothing more and nothong less
I see that you are crushing yourself
But I fall asleep next to your heartbeat
Take this heart
I give it to you
I pass the burden
Now it's up to you

From this day
We are here to stay
The apex of a choice
The weapon of your voice

I see the world alone
I watch you in a soul
Take this heart
I give it to you
I pass the burden
Now it's up to you

From this day
We are here to stay
The apex of a choice
The weapon of your voice

You can't take away my persistence
This is the apex of my choice
I don't need your acceptance
You will fall and I'll rejoice
Take this heart
I give it to you
I pass the burden
Now it's up to you

From this day
We are here to stay
The apex of a choice
The weapon of your voice
