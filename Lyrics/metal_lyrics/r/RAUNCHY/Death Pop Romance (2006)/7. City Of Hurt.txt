I will use the hate you have awakened
I will learn from every step taken
I can't believe you're willing to waste your hate on me
This is my dream and my dream will bury you

On a dark Thursday
I notice you're nasty
On a dark Thursday
I love you for it
This city of hurt will bring us all down
This city of hurt is the place of a broken sound

I am you at your darkest
And I will take you farthest
We ride this city with youth eternally
As the night brings pity, baby!
We avenge eventually

On a dark Thursday
I notice you're nasty
On a dark Thursday
I love you for it
This city of hurt will bring us all down
This city of hurt is the place of a broken sound

On a dark night I notice you're nasty
I will use the hate you have awakened
I will learn from every step taken
I can't believe you're willing to waste your hate on me
This is my dream and my dream will bury you

On a dark Thursday
I notice you're nasty
On a dark Thursday
I love you for it
This city of hurt will bring us all down
This city of hurt is the place of a broken sound
