Closed hands yield open hearts
This is a song of rebellion and
I'm bleeding
For the heart that bleeds
For the lost and the dying
For the ones chasing their dreams
Cut it wide open for everyone to see
When they hold it up against me
Time has come to rise above the meaning
Accelerate the meaning in shadows
There is no master, no rules, no compromise
There is no master, no rules, no compromise
Cut it wide open for everyone to see
When they hold it up against me

All is Better than before
For everybody else

Do you really think I care?
Do you honestly believe?
This my everlasting oath
My burning fire
Cut it wide open and let them see
When they curse the truth inside me
This is a song of rebellion and my bleeding heart
If you don't care we don't care so fuck you all
Irreversible is the things we do in life - do or die!
Pick a fight, take a stand or fuckin die

All is Better than before
For everybody else

I'm burning for you
Better than before
Cut it wide open and let them see
This is my everlasting oath
Inside me
