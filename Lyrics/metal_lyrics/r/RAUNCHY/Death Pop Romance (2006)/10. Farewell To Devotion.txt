I am seduced by your rush of devotion
The darkness is upon me
Bloodstain my name
My darkness is a farewell to devotion
My darkness, still you will hold me back

I burned all my bridges
Still I come tenfold
With a shadow heart insane
I can never be restrained
Still I come tenfold
Still I come tenfold

I am all I am your worship
Your tribute to freedom
Reinvent my exist to escape your kiss
Put a gun to my head
My god you would wish
My darkness is a farewll to devotion
My darkness, still you will hold me back

I burned all my bridges
Still I come tenfold
With a shadow heart insane
I can never be restrained
Still I come tenfold
Still I come tenfold

I am all
You are like the summer and a thousand pink roses
I say thank you for it all
This is where the panic sets in
As I sense the infinite syntax of your love
Only one question still remains
Will you say my name?
We burned down heavens
We are all the same

I burned all my bridges
Still I come tenfold
With a shadow heart insane
I can never be restrained
Still I come tenfold
Still I come tenfold

I am all
