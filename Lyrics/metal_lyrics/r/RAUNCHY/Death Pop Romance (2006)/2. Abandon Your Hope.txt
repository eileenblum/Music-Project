Hollywood demonology
Sound the seventh parade of vanity
We built this city
For pleasure and sin
We love in self-pity
The light is getting dim
Accelerate the dead tonight
Embrace this
My stage fright

I saw a thought, an intent
Now everybody cries
We'll wait and stop for the dead
Now everybody talks

Hollywood demonology
Hey baby!
Say hello to tragedy
I bare my guilt in my worship
I indulge in your fame
Only myself to blame
Accelerate the dead tonight
Embrace this
My stage fright

I saw a thought, an intent
Now everybody cries
We'll wait and stop for the dead
Now everybody talks

Of revenge and conspiracy
Of love and lunacy
The dawn of the dead
Has arrived over Hollywood

I saw a thought, an intent
We'll wait and stop for the dead
I saw a thought, an intent
Now everybody cries
We'll wait and stop for the dead
Now everybody talks

Of revenge and conspiracy
Of love and lunacy
The dawn of the dead
