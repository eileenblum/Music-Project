I've been avoiding the light
I join the myth
I need to realize what I've missed
I crawl through shadows, through space and time
And now I sense you at the end of the line
At the end of the night
Hold the line
As they transcend
The bringer of light

I caught a glimpse of you
Between the moment and the dead
Now I remember you still here
The stories in my head

This ride accelerates I live the myth
I celebrate the darkness of what I've kissed
I crawl through clouds, the shadows for us
Then you start pleading with my heart
Hold the line
As they transcend
The bringer of light

I caught a glimpse of you
Between the moment and the dead
Now I remember you still here
The stories in my head

These words of flames
In my white shade serenade
I still remain
The meaning in shadows
The place I choose to live
Is in a dream forever
As darkness falls, the shadows for us
Between the moment and the dead
As I wake up I can hear the echoes
Teh laughter from the living dead
As darkness falls, the shadows for us
Between the moment and the dead
I still remain

I caught a glimpse of you
Between the moment and the dead
Now I remember you still here
The stories in my head
