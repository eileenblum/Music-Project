We burn down their contradictions
As the sparks turn into day we are alive
We burn for us, for them, for you
This is the anthem
This is the truth

For all to see
For all to feel
For all to beg down on their knees

Nothing remains to be buried
We ride this forever
We are the new way, the new breed
Ignite the essence of fire Skeleton maniacs
Tonight is the night where nothing remains the same
All is still here
The velvet still remains

For all to see
For all to feel
For all to beg down on their knees

This is the anthem
This is the truth
This is the anthem that burns for you

For all to see
For all to feel
For all to beg down on their knees

The fall of you
Forever your nightmare
Trust me we're in this together
Nothing remains to be buried
We ride this forever
