Our darkest dreams set us free
Our darkest scene set us free
I wanna live the dream
Inside a shadow heart
Where all things are alive
Through a blackened soul
Take me back to
The depth of remembrance
In the summer of love
My heart turned cold

Call me
I'm coming

The rush of you forever
Inside our darkest dreams
I need to remember
Things are not what they seem
The rush of you forever
Forever remember
Inside our darkest dreams
Thing are not what they seem

Our darkest dreams set us free
Our darkest scene set us free
I wanna live the dream
Release the vain
You wanna live the dream
Set us free

The rush of you forever
Inside our darkest dreams
I need to remember
Things are not what they seem
The rush of you forever
Forever remember
Inside our darkest dreams
Thing are not what they seem

The rush of you forever in the summer of love
Inside our darkest dreams my heart turns cold
I need to remember in the summer of love
Thing are not what they seem my heart turns cold

Call me
Here I'm slowly coming

The rush of you forever
Inside our darkest dreams
I need to remember
Things are not what they seem
The rush of you forever
Forever remember
Inside our darkest dreams
Thing are not what they seem
