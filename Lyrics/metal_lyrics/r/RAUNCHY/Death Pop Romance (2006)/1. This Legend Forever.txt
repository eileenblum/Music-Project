You live the fiction of a new bravery, your slavery
Every time you speak her name out loud
Will you maintain this leap of faith?
Now that you are forced to withdraw
I am the dead of followers
I stand out from the crowd
Hollow and dedeived
I am the light through her heart chords
My persistence is immense
And she lays down her life
In this ambient dark the night is young

In this world we are what they don't speak of
We are the damned
The soulless

Take me further
This legend is forever
Take me further
Don't fall with me

She is back again like a hope divider
She repents what she has done
In this world we are what they don't speak of
We are the damned
The soulless

Take me further
This legend is forever
Take me further
Don't fall with me

Her blood party is her realm of darkness
Tired before you, bows your master
She is restless after the bite
Receive the kiss of death
She is restless after the bite
Tonight here with me

In this world we are what they don't speak of
We are the damned
The soulless

Take me further
This legend is forever
Take me further
Don't fall with me

The scene is dead
We are the fashion
The new death pop romance
