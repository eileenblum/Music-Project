Working 9-5 half a life made you sick
You might as well suck dicks
Shake the hand of the man who forced you in split
Think about the choices you pick

Suck my d d dick dick dick

Reliable kid but a choice of one way road
Ready to explode
Sold off his soul, couldn't keep it rock'n roll
Think about the bags you load

Spawned from a life so far down the lane
It's gonna haunt you until you brake the chain

Small Ville ballers
Welfare gangsters
Country club divas
Punch clock hookers

Spawned from a life so far down the lane
It's gonna haunt you until you brake the chain
