12 years of thunder and storm
Turned me into what I was meant to become
I'm not a liar though I do you wrong
I just need fire to remain strong

Show me your real darkness
It's no use to me if you keep it to yourself
You're all sugar, call me pretty face
Well I'm nasty mind and your only hell

Oh show me your real darkness, you keep it to yourself

Your song, your sweet song I'm sick to my mind
I'll stick to my own life
Your song, your sweet empty song, so hollow

12 years of thunder and storm
Turned me into what I was meant to become
I'm not a liar though I do you wrong
I just need fire to remain strong

Oh show me your real darkness, you keep it to yourself

Your song, your sweet song I'm sick to my mind
I'll stick to my own life
Your song, your sweet empty song, so hollow

Don't say another word
