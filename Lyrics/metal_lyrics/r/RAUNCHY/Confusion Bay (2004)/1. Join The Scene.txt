50 fags, Jim Beam, two wizards and me sitting in the street
A beat up bird with dragon blood sees me and joins the scene

So many pretty girls all over the world

Copenhagen,  London town,
New York City and Amsterdam

I've got love for you all
The little ones the fat ones and the tall
All my life, every Saturday night

50 fags Jameson two wizards and I on the floor tonight
Twelve feet tall women gasping for heat, I better put up a fight

So many pretty girls all over the world

Copenhagen,  London town,
New York City and Amsterdam

I've got love for you all
The little ones the fat ones and the tall
All my life, every Saturday night
