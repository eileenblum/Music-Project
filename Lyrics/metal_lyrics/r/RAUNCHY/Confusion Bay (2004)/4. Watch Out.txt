Watch out, see us coming
Don't think about running

Speak up, stop playing
Who cares what you're saying?

How does it feel to be floating away?
The 7th generation today
Fight your own wars and let us play
Can you take yourself seriously?

Skip the same ol' routine and take it off your routine
You think we're joking?
Stop testing us cause we're breaking through
You're just barking! 
Who are you comparing? 
Our ways scaring you?

Watch out, see us coming
Don't think about running

Speak up, stop playing
Who cares what you're saying?

How does it feel to be floating away?
The 7th generation today
Fight your own wars and let us play
Can you take yourself seriously?

Watch out, see us coming
Don't think about running.
