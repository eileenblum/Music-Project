We're approaching Showtime
You put down your closing punch line
There's no doubt about it
Push push push till the daddy takes the T-bird away
Well it's on my mind every day
No stopping, things are all like fucking
You wanna taste the fruit and rub it
But there's this girl right down the road
And I know that she's gonna rock my boat
Well it's summer of overload

I'd rather die then not at least try

I saw you down the road and I want you to rock my boat
I saw you down the road and I wanna stick it in there c'mon
Chicks on love drugs
Hoes in tank tops
Brunette rednecks
Redhead school chicks

I'd rather die then not at least try

I saw you down the road and I want you to rock my boat
I saw you down the road and I wanna stick it in there c'mon
