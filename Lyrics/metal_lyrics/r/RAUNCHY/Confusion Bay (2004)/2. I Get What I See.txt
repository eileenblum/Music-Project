I'm bad, I'm a bad bad boy
Just think of what I've destroyed
You might say that I'm evil
I don't care about people
You might say that I'm evil
I don't care about ugly people

Who cares?  Well it matters to me
and it would matter to you if you dared

So natural
It lies deep down in me
Cause you have blinded eyes
I get what I see

When I'm down I'll feel it
And I'll probably lose my mind one time
Or who knows it might last forever
The needle spins in the same ol' line
