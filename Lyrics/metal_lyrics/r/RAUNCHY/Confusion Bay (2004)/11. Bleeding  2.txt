Piercing through flesh
Cutting bones so don't test
You're so fed up because you think you know what's best
You didn't quite get there, something like this

But don't put yourself to rest
You winded up cold blood, gone cold but not quite dead
Don't think all is good as it gets
Reality check your biggest threat

Contemplate yourself

You're on when you're really off
In a beat down you're beating up a dead horse
Scream out loud, you're played out

They still want you very bad it's showing from far
But the boys still talk about you looking deep in that jar

Contemplate yourself

You're on when you're really off
In a beat down you're beating up a dead horse
Screamed out loud, you're played out

Enough is said
You're bleeding from stretched arms and legs
Contemplate yourself
When hate strikes your gate

You're on when you're really off
In a beat down you're beating up a dead horse
Scream out loud, you're played out
