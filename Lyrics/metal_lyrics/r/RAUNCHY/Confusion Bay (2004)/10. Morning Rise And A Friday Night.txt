Take it easy, you know what'll tease me
And keep it sunshine
Though your life is cheesy

You intimidate me and I'm on phantom ice
This ain't as it should be, nothing I recognize

Morning rise and a Friday night
Morning rise but just one night

You're so high and I'm so dry
Just one time in your town
I had your country in sight

I kept it gangster
You wouldn't take the chance cause
You had your package
I went home with my ass kicked

Morning rise and a Friday night
Morning rise but just one night

You're so high and I'm so dry
Just one time in your town
I had your country in sight
Morning rise and a Friday night
You felt it live and bright
You could have killed the beast inside
