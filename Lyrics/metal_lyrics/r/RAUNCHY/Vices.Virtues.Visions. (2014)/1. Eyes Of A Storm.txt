My pulse races faster than my mind can follow
Chasing after my vengeful self
Through a relentless path of destruction

I've become its passenger
Seeing now what has passed
Just slow down, let patience lead
This moment you'll come to accept

Don't be defeated by it
Whether or not you take control
You're still along for the ride

If anything this will be
A true test of patience
Two eyes of a storm

This rage has taken me hostage
Its hand gripping the wheel
Accelerating bitter thoughts
Through no vein will it yield

I've become its passenger
Seeing now only what has passed
Just slow down, let patience lead
This moment you'll come to accept

If anything this will be
A true test of our patience
Two eyes of a storm

Quiet streams of light
Find a passage to the ground
Crossing all along the way
