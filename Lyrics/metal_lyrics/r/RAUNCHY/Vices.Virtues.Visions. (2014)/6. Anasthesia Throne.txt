Failing so eagerly to fulfill
Your duty
Waiting so passively without meaning
No meaning

Doctor Apathy to the inoperating room
Self sedation stat so that we can resume
Anesthesia eyes assess with urgency
From afar, his backseat state of emergency

Outside looking in a crowded waiting room
Patient Imagery anxious to be viewed
Just enough to sense the very surface
Before returning to untroubled numbness

Failing so eagerly to fulfill
Your duty
Waiting so passively without meaning
No meaning

A dormant driver waiting to direct the wheel
Sitting idle on a busy street
Arbitrary gaze across a stream of steal
No desire to follow or compete

A passenger in your own life
No destination or purpose

Failing so eagerly to fulfill
Your duty
Waiting so passively without meaning
No meaning

Drifting for so long
Will eventually find direction
A sign from where you belong
To follow with conviction
Let the anchor fall
And commit itself to the bottom
So you can carry on
So you can live with intention

Failing so eagerly to fulfill
Your duty
Waiting so passively without meaning
No meaning

Failing so eagerly to fulfill (your duty)
It's no wonder that you feel nothing at all
Waiting so passively without meaning
No meaning
