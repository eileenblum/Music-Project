Wake up digital sleeper
Informing must begin
A day's data to digest
Before you power down to do it again

Wake up digital keeper
It is all around you and beyond
That needs undivided attention
So chew quickly and move along

Automated reminder
Refrain from disconnection
The programmed are the sole survivors
In our artificial interconnection

This is the age of overload
You are what you consume
Beings of information
Identities unknown

Wake up, your dream is digital
Do you ever feel the hunger for the truth?
This is the age of overload
You will find it all the way around you

There will be no escaping artificial identities
Plying and manipulating the world that we perceive

Wake up, your dream is digital
Do you ever feel the hunger for the truth?
This is the age of overload
You will find it all the way around you
