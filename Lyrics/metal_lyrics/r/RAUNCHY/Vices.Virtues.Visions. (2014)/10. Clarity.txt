Sooner or later we will have to remove
The blindfold from our eyes
Sooner or later we will have to let go
Of the fictions that we lived by

Conspiring against ourselves
Denying truths for the sake of pride
Dividing our hearts to envy
Satisfying our lust and greed
Misguiding the choices we make
To wrath, sloth, and gluttony

Today we lost ourselves
Gave our self control away today
Today we bid farewell
To vicious cycles and we welcome new days of hope

Stepping out of the darkness and into the light
To show the damage we've done
Stepping out of the darkness and into the light
In hopes that we'll overcome

Conspiring against ourselves
Denying truths for the sake of pride
Dividing our hearts to envy
Satisfying our lust and greed
Misguiding the choices we make
To wrath, sloth, and gluttony

Today we lost ourselves
Gave our self control away today
Today we bid farewell
To vicious cycles and we welcome new days of hope

In this moment of clarity
The past seems so far away
In this moment of integrity
I can finally see clearly
Reason to live this new day

If I can find inside the strength
To defeat these demons
If I can find inside the strength
Carry on with self restraint,
Integrity and patience

I will know it's not over yet
That this is not the end
I will know that this is not the end
