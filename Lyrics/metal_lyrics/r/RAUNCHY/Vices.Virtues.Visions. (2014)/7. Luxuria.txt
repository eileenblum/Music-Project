I'm craving you like I'll never need
Anyone or anything else after I know that you are mine
I've got an appetite that I must satisfy
Only with the taste of you
Not that I know it yet but the feeling I'll get
Will most certainly be recognized

I'm craving you like I've never been
Anything but starving and you're the only life from which to feed
I've got an appetite that I must satisfy
Only with the taste of you
Let out a breath to catch and I will pull you in
In by the hands of the night

If only time could move as fast as my past devotions
I could see my way through the temptations
Perhaps to find satisfaction
But something's caught my eye again and I can't let it get away

Don't you know this is
Our first and last goodbye
So let's make this time
Worth both our while
Once you've caught my eye
There's no escaping
So let's make this time
Worth both our while
