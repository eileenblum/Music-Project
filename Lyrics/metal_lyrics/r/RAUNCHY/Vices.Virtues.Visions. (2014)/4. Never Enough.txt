Resting between worlds seated at his throne
Consuming the stars and all that dare surround him
Soaked in the warmth of the sun
As all below live subject to the night

And as they battle for the scraps that fall from his table
Scraping the earth under their feet
Wars are waged and never won

In vicious cycles around his endless hunger

Oh there will never be an end
Oh 'cause there will never be enough

Self indulgent, deeply hell-bent
To see his way to the bottom before moving on
Gorging the food of the gods
As all below live subject to the night
And as they carry the weakened ones to safety
Across the desolate land under their feet
Wars are waged and never won

In vicious cycles around his endless hunger

Oh there will never be an end
Oh 'cause there will never be enough
There's no way out
Until the gods give up their heavens and he empties them out

A fleeting burst of light
In the small blink of an eye
Illuminating a path
'Cross a melancholy sky
He followed with intent
Mindful of his every step
Passing by the hungry
The ailing and the dead

Oh there will never be an end
Oh 'cause there will never be enough
There's no way out
Until the gods give up their heavens and he empties them out
