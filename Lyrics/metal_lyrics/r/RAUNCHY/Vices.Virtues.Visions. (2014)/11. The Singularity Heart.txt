Goodbye my heart, I won't be needing you anymore
To the fire with you before you risk my life
Somewhere below this thickening skin
There is a trace of humanity
An inkling of life underneath it all
The undying will of weakness

Envious of the machines who never knew
That we together destroyed the earth

They can sleep, with guiltless dreams
They can sleep, they can sleep

Everything inside disappeared
Upon our awakening
To the beginning of what will become
What will become the end

Somewhere within this ever numbing heart
There is a trace of empathy
An inkling of life underneath it all
I can't explain where it's going

Envious of the machines who never knew
That we together destroyed the earth

Everything inside disappeared
Upon our awakening
To the beginning of what will become
What will become the end

Give me a reason to feel again
And I'll try to find where my heart has been
Give me a reason to feel again
To untie my veins and let the pain in
Let the pain back in

They can sleep, with guiltless dreams
They can sleep, they can sleep

Everything inside disappeared
Upon our awakening
To the beginning of what will become
What will become the end
