Fire in the sky
Chaos in our eyes
I cannot save you
I cannot save myself

We have only ourselves to blame
For this wasteland that has become of our world
We brought upon this bitter end
From our insatiable lust for power

Silent as the frozen earth
Desperate as ever before to breathe
Praying that the night will bring
A moment of safety to sleep

Fire in the sky
Chaos in our eyes
I cannot save you
I cannot save myself

I have not seen beyond the smoke
That reaches for days in all directions

Silent as the frozen earth
Desperate as ever before to breathe
Praying that the night will bring
A moment of safety to sleep

We build only to destroy
From ourselves we have no protection
We build for power and glory
Take what we can and leave nothing

Silent as the frozen earth
Desperate as ever before to breathe
Praying that the night will bring
A moment of safety to sleep
