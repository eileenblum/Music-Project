I know it turns me on to see
The way you look at me
With your eyes are dancing on the pale white moon
Would you even think about leaving so soon?
And there she hits you within your eye
You know all is lost and about to die
Then she turns her head with a beautiful smile
And talks for a while with that...

Fateful severed spiteful boy
Deep away in the heart of joy
Talks like crazy, Talks to the sea
The sea is what you see in me

Track through the city filth that lies below
When I'm with you the streets are fields where flowers grow
You look pretty in every stitch you're in, I'm a little boy
I'm in love with you in ways they'll never try

Set sails for the future
Head on into the night

You give yourself the red carpet grave
The last of the lost was hereby saved
With the serpent tongue and a hot plated heart
She turned back the story from the start
And there she goes all dressed in style
All is won within all that dies
Then she turns her head with a beautiful smile
And talks for a while with that...

Deadly severed spiteful tongue
Sweep away the heart with songs
Run like crazy, Run to the sea
The sea is what you see in me

Track through the city filth that lies below
When I'm with you the streets are fields where flowers grow
You look pretty in every stitch you're in, I'm a little boy
I'm in love with you in ways they'll never try

A rose dressed in thorns
Yet your touch is just a feeble plot
A rose dressed in thorns
A black kingdom between mountains of lust
Yet your touch is just a feeble plot
Kick up a fire and watch them explode
