I am the one that brings death and dirty girls
I am the future, the destroyer of all your worlds
I am the one in your colossal sky
I am you when you scream and wonder why

Hell was made for heroes
In all your reason
I am your warrior

We scar above all mistakes
On bruised and battered wings
Ascend to bring back the light again
Passed imagination

I am the one that brings revenge at dawn
If I was your god you would live all day and all night long

A little step closer to the end
A little too late

It should have been me
It should have been you
