You know it's right when you feel it's wrong
We all fall down and fall apart for love
But rest assured that we will take it to the wasteland discotheque
And make them turn their heads again
It's in the way we fucking move
It's in the way we fucking dance
(In this) Black house, Glass City

Thank you for all the times we shared
Now you want it, you want it so bad
Tap tap your toes to the beat
Like all the rest you're sweet, sweet, sweet
I've tasted all of them

A girl, a boy, one hell, like thieves we are
All in love with stolen heart
You think it's right when you tease on your knees
Like cheap dirty trash
We push ourselves in and out of relationships
Now I've lost myself in girls from the city
And girls that will say we all feel the same way
(In this) Black house, Glass City

Thank you for all the times we shared
Now you want it, you want it so bad
Tap tap your toes to the beat
Like all the rest you're sweet, sweet, sweet
I've tasted all of them

My job here is done - fuck yeah - and soon you'll be gone
If everyone loves everyone
The term has truly failed if the stars have fallen
Then desire is the new black fire

Thank you for all the times we shared
For the ones we shared and beyond
Now you want it, you want it so fucking bad
Tap tap your toes to the beat
Like all the rest you're sweet, sweet, sweet
I've tasted all of them

One girl, two girls, my hell, like thieves we are
All in love with stolen heart
