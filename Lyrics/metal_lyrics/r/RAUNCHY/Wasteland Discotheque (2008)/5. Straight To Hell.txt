This city we ride like devils in the night
Harlots and dragons, crowns and thorns
This city we ride with hell hounds by our side
We thrash to live, we live to thrash

Let's go the only way we know
You don't stay, Straight to Hell

Save me 'cause the hounds of hell do bite

There's nothing left to reconcile
A mirror desire is a mirror on fire

This game we play like demons in a parade
Now we ride a fucking charade
Thirty sharks, sixty wolves and a fat lady in red
Before the night is over we are fucking dead

Let's go the only way we know
You don't stay, Straight to Hell

Save me 'cause the hounds of hell do bite

There's nothing left to reconcile
A mirror desire is a mirror on fire

Let all hell break loose
In a Crystal Lake scenery
Come dance with me
My misery

There's nothing left
We're going straight to Hell
