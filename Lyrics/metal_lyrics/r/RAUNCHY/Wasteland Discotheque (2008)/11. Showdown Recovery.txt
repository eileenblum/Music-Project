Yeah, we bring out the guns tonight
Rednecks of the dawn of sixteen, sleepy hollow
Now loneliness sleeps in his neck skin like a snake bite
A death rattle sings his swan song serenade

Whatever the fuck you wanna call it
This is a showdown

When we burn
In recovery
Your infinity doesn't mean a thing to me
When we burn we burn to be free

Now loneliness sound the surrender for you and me
A lone tower bell rings out the swan song serenade

Whatever the fuck you wanna call it, dirty boy
This is a showdown

When we burn
In recovery
Your infinity doesn't mean a thing to me
When we burn we burn to be free

Hell yeah

A lone tower bell rings out the swan song serenade
Within a glimpse his destiny was made
Under the trees of timeless fables
The wolves they gathered and took that red hat away

When we burn
Take me when you break me and throw me away
Your infinity doesn't mean a thing to me
When we burn we burn to be free
