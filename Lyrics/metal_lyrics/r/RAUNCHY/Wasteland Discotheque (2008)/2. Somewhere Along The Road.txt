Hell Yeah we're riding big cars with big cigars today
We're thunder, storm and everything that's here to stay
Say what you want
Tonight the sky is on fire
Say what you want, tonight we are the fire!

I died alone with you somewhere along the road
I've tried so very hard watching you, watching you fade

Hell yeah my dead boys are in the mood for a fight
Like zombies they are, they smell blood, what a wonderfull sight
Say what you want
Tonight the sky is on fire
Say what you need
Tonight we are the fire!

I died alone with you somewhere along the road
I've tried so very hard watching you, watching you fade

Just take your time and come on over
The show is about to begin
When the shit hits the fan just before sundown
That's when the girls are dressed for sin
That's what i saw in Copenhagen
That's what i saw

I died alone with you somewhere along the road
I've tried so very hard watching you, watching you fade

That's what i saw in Copenhagen
In London. In New York City. In Amsterdam
