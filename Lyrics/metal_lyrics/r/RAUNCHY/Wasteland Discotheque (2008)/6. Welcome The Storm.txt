So you say doom is on the way for those about to dance their life away
At the whisky-a-go-go with your big fucking mojo
You simply pick up what is just a no go

Hell yeah we're picking stars tonight
We're about to commence the truth
The paramount of youth

You wanna run away
From the life you call your own and have a little taste of what's to come
Hide inside those empty words that have lingered for far too long
For far too long in your dead kingdom

You are so fucking alive that you will hang'em high to stay for a while
Up in Hollywood hills there's a place where it chills
Where you'll find the beauty in your breakdown

Hell yeah we're picking stars tonight
We're about to commence the truth
The paramount of youth

You wanna run away
From the life you call your own and have a little taste of what's to come
Hide inside those empty words that have lingered for far too long
For far too long in your dead kingdom

Away from the storm
Inside the void I'm all alone
Walking in the rain
Knowing this will outlive me

You wanna run away
From the life you call your own and have a little taste of what's to come
Hide inside those empty words that have lingered for far too long
For far too long in your dead kingdom

We will welcome the storm
