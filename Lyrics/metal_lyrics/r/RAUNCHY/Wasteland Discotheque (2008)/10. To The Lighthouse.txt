You have become my ethereal darkness
My black highway and my heart split down the middle
Why do we keep doing this to ourselves?
This never bliss, only sounds of hell's bells

I want to take you away
Make you see the beauty in life again
"To the lighthouse", she sings in the night
As we sail through the bay into a new day

And there it leads the way
For us phallic and proud
With its light scattered all over
All over the crowd

Through mountains; through water to find
What could lift us up to see the bliss on the horizon
A symbol of hope, a kicked up fire
To find tranquility inside the flames

I want to take you away
Make you see the beauty in life again
"To the lighthouse", she sings in the night
As we sail through the bay into a new day

And there it leads the way
For us phallic and proud
With its light scattered all over
All over the crowd

Uh, baby let's take it further down below
This rowboat is not for the two of us
We're not running on empty heart
You're my black sunrise and my heart split down the middle
Baby, why do we keep doing this to ourselves?
You're the sound of hell's bells, but that's not a bad thing, right?
Let's take it to the next step, let's do it all night

We're the young believers
We're nation builders
Fucking for might

I want to take you away
Make you see the beauty in life again
"To the lighthouse", she sings in the night
As we sail through the bay into a new day

And there it leads the way
For us phallic and proud
With its light scattered all over
All over the crowd
