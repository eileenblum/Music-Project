Yeah

Here we go again

You got a killer sound there, said the devil
So what did I say to him:
"Yeah. You're right, bitch"
And then we continued

Now this one is for you
Fuck yeah, it's on all the girls keep on dancing
We're ready to give them everything

There's no clarity, but I can feel the music

I said before and I'll say it again:
"We're nothing without all our demons"
This kind of devil music is the yeah thing

I said before and I'll say it again:
We'll be here no matter what, my friend"
We are everything you'll ever need,
Just bite the hand that feeds

Bring out your romance,
Just sing for your halo
Bring out your feelings
And let all your love go

Bring out your romance,
Just sing for your halo
Bring out your feelings
And let all your love go

Hell yeah
Walk away

Hell yeah
Walk away

Hell yeah
Walk away

Hell yeah
Walk away

And the devil just laughed and walked away
Just laughed and walked away

And the devil just laughed and walked away
Just laughed and walked away

Where the light is
There is darkness
Contradictions and all your temple
This is feeling and I don't know how it gets that way,
But it's on, it's on and you fucking love it

And the devil just laughed and walked away

Bring out your romance,
Just sing for your halo
Bring out your feelings
And let all your love go

Bring out your romance,
Just sing for your halo
Bring out your feelings
And let all your love go
