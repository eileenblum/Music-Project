We are machines inside your heart
Let's go back to the start
We are what we are
In a heartbeat's second we'll cut the chords
This time I'm not sure we'll move forward

(Put your cold) hands on there, so what can't you see
Why can't you see?
(You and) I should be counting signs for a hundred miles

Tell them to turn it up and fill it up on hate
Just turn keys and drive on
The sooner, the better pull it out
And drive on straight
Turn the keys and drive on

We are what we are
And if we change
You should know we did it to please ourselves

We are machines
In a heartbeat's second we'll cut the chords
This time I'm not sure we'll move forward

(Put your cold) hands on there, so what can't you see
Why can't you see?
(You and) I should be counting signs for a hundred miles

It's not the end of you and me
It's not the end of you and me, yeah

Tell them to turn it up and fill it up on hate
Just turn keys and drive on
The sooner, the better pull it out
And drive on straight
Turn the keys and drive on

Tell them to turn it, they are returning

They are returning and this is no big truth

Tell them to turn it up and fill it up on hate
Just turn keys and drive on
The sooner, the better pull it out
And drive on straight
Turn the keys and drive on
