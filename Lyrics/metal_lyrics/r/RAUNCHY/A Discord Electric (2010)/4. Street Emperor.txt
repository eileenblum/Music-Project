I'm not the preacher here
If I could reach I would reach
Into the belly of the beast
And feast on the sex and sin
Thirty shades of the seven

Come here, lay with me
And taste what I have to give
All the greatness of the flesh
The flesh we are made off

Your taste will haunt me in my dreams
And I'll touch you sweetly
You rapture this dirty devotion
The gloom of the man

The arising, the dragon's fire
Saturday vultures with high class fever
I got a secret you all want to know
Just take all your clothes off

Oh, think I'll have a say
Just might get my way
Oh, for a little while

So let's fight
Let it out, see them changing
Just don't wait
Let it out, just you change

Come here, let me take you away
To keep the precious moments at bay
You can pray if you wanna see
All the good things that got away
Hell yeah

The arising, the dragon's fire
Saturday vultures with high class fever
I got a secret you all want to know
Just take all your clothes off

Oh, think I'll have a say
Just might get my way
Oh, for a little while

So let's fight
Let it out, see them changing
Just don't wait
Let it out, just you change

Try to forget
That nothing waits in the dark
But won't you rather be gone
Get up now, everyone falls

Try to forget
That nothing waits in the dark
But won't you rather be gone
Get up now, everyone falls

Try to forget
That nothing waits in the dark
And don't you grab till we're gone
What was in our hands before

The arising, the dragon's fire
Saturday vultures with high class fever
I got a secret you all want to know
Just take all your clothes off

Oh, think I'll have a say
Just might get my way
Oh, for a little while

So let's fight
Let it out, see them changing
Just don't wait
Let it out, just you change
