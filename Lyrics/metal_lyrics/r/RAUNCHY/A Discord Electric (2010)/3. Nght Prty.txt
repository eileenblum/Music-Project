I think I'm in love with the glamorous hills
The beauty of the sea, the beauty in me
I am the man that will love you to death
But I know for sure, it ain't a part of me

Oh Captain, my Captain
Would you please sail me to sea?
Well, I'm losing the war, I can't see it clear
All that's left is the gloomy sounds I hear

For now I am done
The hand feeding is right on
For now I am done

Too fast to ever get a hold off
Like flowers in the heart of darkness
Like roses blacker than your mother's soul
Now it's gloomy and out of control

For now I am done
The hand feeding is right on
For now I am done

And back then I was down
Suddenly it felt better
And better than her

This is the nght prty
This is the nght prty
Take it away

I gave you a Siberian kiss
When you left me at the nght prty
Have you been drinking again?
I will not fall overboard

I gave you a Siberian kiss
When you left me at the nght prty
Tell me have you been drinking again?

Your taste still haunts me in my dreams
It's killing me, this safety of illusion
It's time to bury you in my heart

For now I am done
The hand feeding is right on
For now I am done

And back then I was down
Suddenly it felt better
And better

For now I am done
It feels like escape now
Right now where I am down
When your kiss doesn't feels safe

Back when I was down
Suddenly it felt better
It's better with you
