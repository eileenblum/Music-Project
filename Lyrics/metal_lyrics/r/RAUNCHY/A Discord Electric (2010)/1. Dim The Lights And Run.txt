You don't think you'll make it What's wrong with faking
You don't think you'll make it You look old so fake it
What's wrong with thinking Now you really gotta lay it all
down and on and on
You don't think you'll make it You look old so fake it
What's wrong with thinking Now you really gotta lay it all down
You always think you'll break it You took all so fake it
Now what's wrong with sinking Now you really got a boat to row

Sending out the signals This is a call for celebration
This new music is in the blood we all need to feed

Sending Out signals Call for celebration
This is new music Dim the lights and run
Sending Out signals Call for celebration
Only for a while Only for a day
It's just begun Dim the lights and run

Take it just take it break it just break it
Got everything you wanted But still you wanted more and more
Fake it just fake it Scream it just scream it
You will make it through the day With nothing left to say

Sending out the signals This is a call for celebration
This new music is in the blood we all need to feed

Sending Out signals Call for celebration
This is new music Dim the lights and run
Sending Out signals Call for celebration
Only for a while Only for a day
It's just begun Dim the lights and run
