We've been working
Like machines for hours now
Since crack of dawn
We have not talked together

I guess the more things change
The more they stay the same
But we've built cities of glass
And we won the wars

You could bleed it, you could feel it
If you go down that road, you will see it
You could fake it, you could break it
If you want me I will never see it

Take it back, just take it back now
That we have come so far
I hate to admit it

But it takes a real man
It takes a real man
To look deep in the jar
Just pull yourself together

We've been riding through the night
For ages now
Since the great depression
We have not slept for a day

I got what you want
But I can't feel what I have
And if you go down that road
I will be right in your tail

You could bleed it, you could feel it
If you go down that road, you will see it
You could fake it, you could break it
If you want me I will never see it

Take it back, just take it back now
That we have come so far
I hate to admit it

But it takes a real man
It takes a real man
To look deep in the jar
Just pull yourself together

Take it back, just take it back now
That we have come so far
I hate to admit it

But it takes a real man
It takes a real man
To look deep in the jar
Just pull yourself together

Take it back, just take it back now
That we have come so far
I hate to admit it

But it takes a real man
It takes a real man
To look deep in the jar
Just pull yourself together
