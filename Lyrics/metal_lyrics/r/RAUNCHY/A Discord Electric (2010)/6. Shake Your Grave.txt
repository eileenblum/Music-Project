Well, I'm feathered
And torn by this life I have led
Live like you mean it
And don't miss a second of it
Phone up the man downstairs
And call him what you want

Hurting yourself as you speak
Those words of night
All you can do is sit back
And let her talk for a while
Where is my heart
And your love is cast aside

Do you want it?
Yeah
Do you need it?
Yeah

So fucking creepy
Yeah
Why don't you act
Like you fucking mean it?

Please stand up now
I'm coming home
Feel them talking
Behind your back

Do you want it?
Yeah
Do you need it?
Yeah

So fucking creepy
Yeah
Yeah

Witches, they are all witches
But we're equal on the deathbed, bleeding
If death's coming quick, it best come now

Morals are questions
The starving feed their young
We know there are still hearts to be won
Who are facing the firing line
Momma, this is my last goodbye

Please stand up now
I'm coming home
Feel them talking
Behind your back
All the rumors feel so alive

All the way down
I really thought I'd remember
All the way down
I really thought I'd remember

Only way is down
(I really thought I'd remember)
They'll catch you if you fall

Only way is down
(I really thought I'd remember)
They'll catch you if you fall

Please stand up now
Please stand up now

Please stand up now
I'm coming home
Feel them talking
Behind your back

All the rumors feel so alive
Please stand up now
I'm coming home

Please stand up now
I'm coming home
Feel them talking
Behind your back
