We are the death of the funeral
We are the pulse on your holiday
We are the vows at your wedding
We are the sentiment in between
What do you say?

We won't go back to the beginning
To slit the throats of your fiction
We are the party of darkness
We are a newborn sensation

I want to believe you
I will do the best I can
And no one will defy you
We are the rumors in your worship

It's like before
I can't complete this
The minute you're gone
I will stop the hollow sound

I want to believe you
I will do the best I can
And no one will defy you
We are the rumors in your worship

We are the words spilled on the page
We are your rage when you dreamt of age
We are the party of the big scene
We are the light in your blackout
Say what

We are your real emptiness
We were the pleasure of your heat
We are the love and the obscene
We are the life in the dark street

I want to believe you

It's like before
I can't complete this
The minute you're gone
I will stop the hollow sound

It's like before
I can't complete this
The minute you're gone
I will stop the hollow sound

Dear future, I got what you want
I can see it in your eyes
It feels like I've been here before
Your taste's the same, so are the lies

There's an empty hole in me
But it's a hole I can call my home

I want to believe you

It's like before
I can't complete this, complete this
The minute you're gone
I will stop the hollow sound

It's like before
I can't complete this
The minute you're gone
I will stop the hollow sound
