You got me right where you want me
Now what is your plan?
I'm not ready for this kind of magic

It's time to party

Let's do shots in the bar
And cast another stone
Pride is just a matter of morals
Cash and code

Follow me down this road
I'll give you what you want
Now what do you need?
Just say everything

If only you'll be my tiger crown
Now what do you need
To feel alive in this ghost town?

It's time to party
And fuck all the rules

This time I know you feel it
(Let's just break away)
I don't know what to believe in

1, 2, 3, you'll get over me
I was your cheap fuck to lay
Don't forget a thing
I want to see you again

Follow me down this road
I'll give you what you want
Now what do you need?
Just say everything

If only you'll be my tiger crown
Now what do you need
To feel alive in this ghost town?

It's time to party
And fuck all the rules

This time I know you feel it
(Let's just break away)
I don't know what to believe in

If that's what you say
This time I know you can feel it
But there's something wrong
With all my ways

Because I don't know
What to believe
If that's what you say
Let's just break away

Oh, c'mon
The tiger crown
You'll be my tiger crown

This time I know you feel it
I don't know what to believe in

This time I know you feel it
Let's just break away
I don't know what to believe in
If that's what you say

This time I know you can feel it
But there's something wrong
With all my ways

Because I don't know
What to believe
If that's what you say
Let's just break away
