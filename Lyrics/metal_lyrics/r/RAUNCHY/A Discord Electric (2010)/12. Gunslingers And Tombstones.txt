We're surfing the waves of the blues
Through times of gloom and the confused
New world police is a western feeling

We're not proud of this
Not just a little bit
Party girls and pick up lines
At your funeral

We're living in a cold world's industry
Right next to the new sheriff in town
O' how we fail to see
The mouth of the shark

You should not bow down
And give praise to the beast
You should rise up high
Above their ungodly feast

Rode the ride we've been given
Close to those who care
And always pay tribute
To those who dared

We're taking the chance of light
I'm telling through times
Where no skies are bright
I'm still telling you
I might be back, I might be back

We're taking the chance of light
Through times
Where no skies are bright
Oil, porn and war
Is a western way of life

We're not made of steel
It's just how we feel
Dirty deals and cheap girls
Beside your coffin'

We're living in a cold world's harmony
Right next the portrait of the patriot
O' how we fail to feel
The mouth of the shark

[Incomprehensible]
Close to those who care
And always pay tribute
To those who dared

You should not bow down
And give praise to the beast
You should rise up high
Above their ungodly feast
Gives praise to the beast

We're taking the chance of light
I'm telling through times
Where no skies are bright
I'm still telling you
I might be back, I might be back

Don't it feel like as if
We're taking the chance of light
I'm telling through times
Where no skies are bright
I'm still telling you
I might be back, I might be back

Who's next in line
For the big fucking get-away
You big cowboy
Who's next in line
For the big fucking get-away
Gunslingers and tombstones

Don't be long, don't be gone
I think you might be back
If so, break my back

We're taking the chance of light
I'm telling through times
Where no skies are bright
I'm still telling you
I might be back, I might be back

Don't it feels like as if
We're taking the chance of light
I'm telling through times
Where no skies are bright
I'm still telling you
I might be back, I might be back

We're taking the chance of light
Through times
Where no skies are bright
I'm still telling you
I might be back, I might be back
