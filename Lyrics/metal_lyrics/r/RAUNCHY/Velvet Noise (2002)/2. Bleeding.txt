They want you so very bad, it's glooming for miles
And the boys are talking about it all the while
And down like from totally far down they see you tweaking
And your lips are shivering, your secret story is leaking

You don't turn on the lights, dont talk on the phone
You hope that for at least a day, they'd leave you alone
And down like from totally far down they see you tweaking
And your lips are shivering, your secret story is leaking

Kicking and screaming, bleeding, becoming what you detest
Is what your proceeding
