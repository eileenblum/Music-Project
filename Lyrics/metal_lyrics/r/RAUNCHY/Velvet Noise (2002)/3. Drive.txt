I can't smell this
I can't feel this
I can't eat this even touch this
I can't smoke this so face this
I can't play this

I want you to take it away
Grrr move it I don't want it

Could I choose
What I'd choose
This is how I want it to be

You can't smell me
You can't feel me
You can't taste me even see me
You cant hear me so tell me how I fake it

I want you to take it away
Grrr move it I don't want it

Could I choose
What I'd choose
This is how I want it to be

I can't write this
I can't drive this even feel this
I don't need this
