Emptiness hold my hand and join me here tonight
Let me be your friend
Let's look at girls in fights
Let's get drunk
we've got nothing to lose tonight
Give it away
It's ours so give it away its alright

Could it be taht my situation does that it suddenly seems like the world
is
Coming down on me
I must try and find substance or sense and stability

Don't eject
It just can't be that hard
Don't eject
Change event
It just can't be that hard to change event

I tend to forget that thoughts reflect my words
I better contemplate
Cause words reflect my actions in which some relate
Those I need
In those I need to depend
No escape
I better contemplate it's alright

Could it be that my situation does that it suddenly seems like the world
is 
Coming down on me
I must try and find substance or sense and stability

Don't eject
It just can't be that hard
Don't eject
Change event
It just can't be that hard to change event
