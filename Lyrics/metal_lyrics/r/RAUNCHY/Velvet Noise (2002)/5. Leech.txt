I tried just to avoid you
I was never able to
Cause you were always around
Anywhere you could appear
You spoiled it all for me
Nobody else could see
The pain you put me in
I never needed a friend

I wanna meet you there
And I will take you out
Cause I wanna break your bones
And make you regret that you ever came here

You feed on my appearance
My response is your response
You lie behind my back
I want to place an end
Never again will you pretend
In he what you never were
As leech I'll bury you

I wanna meet you there
And I will take you out
Cause I wanna break your bones
And make you regret that you ever came here
Well you did not understand
No you did not understand

I wanna meet you there
And I will take you out
Cause I wanna break your bones
And make you regret that you ever came here
