Explosions in my thoughts keep going on and on
It's keeping me awake till the crack of dawn
I'm so paranoid
I hope nobody is ever gonna see me like this
I'm twisting and turning my eyes feel like they're burning
I don't know what I'll do please stop before I lose my mind

I am falling through the holes of my mind
I know that it will be that way till the crack of dawn

What is this shit that i jjust can't do nothing about
Talking is useless help is useless
I'm going out of my mind

I lay down to rest my soul
Until the words of glory has been told
My pillow is soft and warm
I'll leave spots in the crack of dawn

I am falling through the holes of my mind
I know that it will be that way till the crack of dawn

Though it's all so quiet
Nothing can keep my thoughts from being wild
