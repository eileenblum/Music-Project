There is somebody I meet when I'm drunk
Someone looking better than me
She don't sweat like little pink pigs
Don't smell like the sweat on my cheeks

And there is somebody around every time
Someone I don't care about
Smelling awfully good as well
But I am better company

There is something I don't want her to know
Something I don't want to tell
But I know that she sees right through me
And there is nothing that I can do

And there is somebody around every time
Someone I don't care about
Smelling awfully good as well

All that people want is a piece of flesh
They wanna bring it home

Somebody really starts to make me mad
Someone I couldn't care less about
I want him to get out of my view
He is really in my way
And there is somebody around every time
Someone I don't care about
Smelling awfully good as well
But I am better company

All that people want is a piece of flresh
They wanna bring it home
Tonight it's all about getting laid
A giant human flesh light
