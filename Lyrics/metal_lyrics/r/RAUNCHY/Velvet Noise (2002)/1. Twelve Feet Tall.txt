Avoiding the bypass
Feeling at least
Silence, overrated
Our time, we made it

Missing hours alone
Lack of inspiration
No time left for consideration

Nothing is gonna bring me down tonight
Nothing is gonna pass me by
My perfect night my attention
I wanna be the one
The center of
Twelve feet tall women
Gasping for heat burning
Fire-water green silk-cut-shag
Crank it up till it bleeds
Whisky/coke skirts fights birds choke
Lever to wheels high speed fuel peaks me

Like roaches surviving
Take it higher, we're climbing
Loose the losers
Choose the choosers
Nothing is gonna bring me down tonight
Nothing is gonna pass me by
My perfect night my attention
I wanna be the one

The center of
Twelve feet tall women
Gasping for heat burning
Fire-water green silk-cut-shag
Crank it up till it bleeds
Whisky/coke skirts fights birds choke
Lever to wheels high speed fuel peaks me
