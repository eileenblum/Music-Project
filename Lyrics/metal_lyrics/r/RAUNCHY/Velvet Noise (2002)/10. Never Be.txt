What if I tried to forget all about you
Pretend that you and I never was and never would be

WHY (when I tried it never made a difference)
WHY  (why cant I be the one you want?)

When ever I tried to regret all about you
What we had was no good and never could be

WHY (when I tried it never made a difference)
WHY (Why cant I be the one you want?)

Never be the same when you're not here

What if I tried to forget all about you?
Pretend that you and I never was and never would be

WHY (when I tried it never made a difference)
WHY (why can't I be the one you want?)
Never be the same when you're here
