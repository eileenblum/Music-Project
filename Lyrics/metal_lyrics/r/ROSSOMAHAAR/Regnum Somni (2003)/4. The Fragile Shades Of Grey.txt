See him, who ariseth from these dreary waters
What doth thy imagination tell thee?
Those pale dim lights make all eternity end...
... and who laugheth now?

Sleep... it leads you right unto dimensions never seen
Illusive dreamvisions, aeoms passing in a moment
They all dwell therein, there where your second 
Sight's blinded and delight stands for pain

Fragile existence disheartedly brought to
Comdemned shell of torturous co-existence
Men and insects, both with solus departed
This cannot be

Stop for a moment (please stop)
Conceive, create and produce your own angels
Demons of the same kind
Anyone or anything you'd dare to trust

Naturally, everything seems to be an absurd
Absurd to a maximum extent
However, please dream on and walk on
The path you chose, what a jewel of 
Subterranea it hides?
And is it jewel at all?

One billion questions yet with no answer
Dream a dream and go deeper deeper deeper!
Deeper into time and space all created by yourself

And now would please you go back to externality
Tell me... can you see anything now?
In these waters dark as hell itself probably is, (yes)
Still the vision's recognizable...

See him, who ariseth from these dreary waters
What doth thy imagination tell thee?
Those pale dim lights make all eternity end...
... and who laugheth now?
