Sham ecstasy or aggressive apathy
Forsaken space or ungodly garce
Star-ashen depravity or the lack of gravity
Futile malevolence or sick coherence

Seductive immortality or heartless subnormality
Vicious purity or envenomed obscurity
Chthonian dawn or hesperus' throne
Deflowered misjudgment or logical confinement

Abducted abandoned abruptly asphyxiated
Beaten broken blandy bestialized
Angelized apathized apologetically abused
Blinded bereft becomingly beheaded

Cautioned cribbed cravenly condemned

Devoured decapitated divinely disincarnated
Enthroned entangled entirely eviscerated
Dethroned degraded deleteriously demented
Enlightened erased equivocally ensepulchered

Sham ecstasy or aggressive apathy
Forsaken space or ungodly garce
Star-ashen depravity or the lack of gravity
Futile malevolence or sick coherence

Seductive immortality or heartless subnormality
Vicious purity or envenomed obscurity
Chthonian dawn or hesperus' throne
Deflowered misjudgment or logical confinement

Incommutable inconsequence...
... or diversionary law of the laws?
