Ravens flew and all colors disappeared

Darkness emeged from the bleakness
Of this mortal world what a disgusting place

A step closer to the pits of hell

You life distracted, your soul departed
The sacred aim completed

All flowers withered in universe so pale

This is the place no one may ever reach
A point of no return

Far beyond the within

Caverns made of sulfer, conceald in
Everlasting snowfalls of gray

The only river flows deadly frozen

There're no more tears, and no more peace
No loving soul to cover you

No more sun to grant us warmth

All horizons weep in laughter
For they're shattered

None of the prophecies fulfilled

There's no more trust in dreams
Luing bastards of despair

Our desires died the death of poor

It's the wrong place to seek shelter
It's all too wrong

Oblivion (still) has a color: bloodred
