I am
... your miserable deity
Solemn stigma of a stubborn god
I was
... your fake adversary
Adolescent euphony for you to hear

I am
...coldhearted cauldron of impurity
I come forth
... and crawl back forward
I breath your air
... and steal your nonexistent hell

How does it feel like, to know there's no savior?
And there had never been
How does it feel like, to know you/re all alone?
In a universe so emotionless

What if noise stands for music
And color stands for language
When solar deities have been overthrown
And horizons aren't so distant anymore

I am
... your childlike conscious
I am
... your exiled mind

And I'll make sure
You never know who I really am
