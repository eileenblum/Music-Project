Algol, to Thee I sing my song 
Oh star of Evil and obscene light, 
Perpetual in your seductive nothingness 
Grant me thy power, grant me thy all-devouring might... 

For I am a feeble human soul 
Itching for the planetary rule 
To become one with the Elements... 
To hover above the Cosmic seas eternally... 

From the depths of my darkest nightmares 
Reincarnated, I rise again... 
Conceiving the glorious future awaiting me 
Far beyond the limits of earthly fancies 

Within the dominions enslaved by torment 
Thousand human cries sound so sweet... 
Their tears run dry 
Crimson limbs, crowned with suffering 
Enthroned through embalmment... 

Pale forespoken skies turn black again and forever 
Sunset is near, nightfall comes - my desired destiny 
Silhouettes clothed in twilight crawl into my burial dream 
Rulers of the visionary land, they endow me with their ecstasy 
I wither and behold the clouded landscapes grow dim... 

Lost is my visual form, forgotten is my former life 
Now I'm at one with mists of eternity...
