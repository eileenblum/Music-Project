Alone and sorrowful, the divine essense crawls 
Along the dying remains of heavenly kingdom 
Once adorned and now forlorn, 
Questioning anything, but meaningless and painful 

Bitter memories of past apocryphal superiority, 
Flesh and soul now departed in more than racking way... 
Necromantic lust for vital pleasures and devilish desires, 
For precious taste of blood and sulphur throne of wisdom... 

Sinful and infidel in spirit, 
With bloodstained sword 
It once joined the battle for the Divine's triumph 
For salvation and a glory of the Heaven's Lord... 

Forgotten and betrayed, it wanders through infinity, 
Alone and tearless... 
Enchanting odes from the distant woods so vast 
Cherish it's neverending pain, encircling in oblivion... 

Detested is the dying surface of the earth 
Surreal and naked is it's torturing tristesse 
The mournful silence is so sweet... 

[narration:]

Into the very depths of Heddenah's gardens 
Through the enflamed spheres it ascended 
Lusting for revenge... 

Countless centuries will pass 
And some day the betrayal is avenged 
For every sin shall be atoned 
For every pain shall find it's rest...&gt;
