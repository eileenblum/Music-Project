The hammer falls, breeding awe-inspiring wickedness 
Ephemeral in it's regressive condemnation 
Pulsating protoplasma rages upon the burning ocean 
Mirroring the further mental transmigration... 

The crescent moon grows old 
And airy castles made of glaring starlight 
Endure the utter suffering 
Sparkling in this moonless winternight 

[narration:]
The consuming parallels are broken, 
Perished are the chambers of Utopia... 
Sacrilegious and hidden, transenflamed and disgorged 
Into portals of chaos the Space emerges...
