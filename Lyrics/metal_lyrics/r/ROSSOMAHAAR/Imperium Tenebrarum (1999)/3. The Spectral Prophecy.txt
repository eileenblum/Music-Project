[narration:]

From the dark stars They came before man was born, 
Unseen and loathsome They descended to primal earth...&gt; * 

Among the underwater gardens filled with grief 
Beyond the astral landscapes so dark and sorrowful 
Where no vital creature may abode and live 
A ghastly shadow rises from the deepest caverns 
Of once forgotten R'lyeh... 

[narration:]

And Their blasphemies were great upon the Earth 
All creation bowed beneath Their might 
And knew Them for Their wickedness...&gt; * 

Cloaked in the fiery sombre mists, 
The Cthulhu's essense sweeps along the dying Tellus, 
No man's eye can see His visual form and rejoice of further living... 
Floating through the pale abyssic eclipse, 
Through forbidden formulas He summons the Darkest One... 

... FINALLY THE SEAL HAS BEEN BROKEN, 
CHAOS IS HERE AT LAST...! 

[narration:]

And They shall rule where They once ruled 
As foulness you shall know Them 
And Their accursedness shall stain the Earth...&gt; *
