Eternal in my shapeless form I reach the dark domain 
Soaring above these lands of torture 
Fragments of eternity disappear as sunlight fades, 
Rearranging to ephemeral darkened silhouettes 

Reborn in bacchanalia of diabolical shades 
Chariotry of Righteous Wrath splits the nightly sky 
In exposed midnight vault 
Crimson tears of wisdom embrace these mighty warriors 
Their thoughts coloured in black, 
Bitter dreams cast in despondency... 

I behold the moonrise and make up my farewell song 
Drowned among the fierceful lunar waves of blessed Nocturnal Sea... 
My feelings are numb, though I scent another scarlet dawn 
And everflaming solar hatred burning restlessly... 

Walk into my affliction and see my despair 
Fly with me, beyond the gates of Death Herself - 
Into the domain beyond all horizons...
