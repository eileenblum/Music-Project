Deep inside the woods, whose sight's embraced with
Wintry fluid
The wolves come forth the sacred fire, whose flame's enshrouded in
My deep passion and anxiety

Memories of pride, memories of hunger
The lust forsaken, the hate bereft
Bitterness and strength, they all come into one
One and only, those far behind I've left

Praise the somberness of outer worlds,
Raise your hell and grant me your bereavement
The luminary gods dwelling in my reveries,
Buried in the infinite concealment

The sun of the sleepless, the one we bark upon at night...
The dawn brings it's regular disease,
Granting us it's incinerating warmness
Dearest phantoms of the night, they're finally released...

Whom dost shine this magic light upon?
The ghastly theatre of nature, is it thee?
Whom dost mortify this scintillation among the cosmic lawns?
The answers hidden within the very depths of me...

Those crystal lakes of an alien origin
What will they spawn and how will they act...
Entangled in barbed wire is the divine pigeon
What kind of peace will these long-dead spheres bring...

Mythical source of an ancient knowledge
A fountain of repulsion, truthfully the one I've longed for
The legions march across my motherland
The one deep beneath the surface of the earth

In the night, in deepest solitude my spirit is reborn
To fly high above the woods and explore the caverns of the
Underwater lands, reigned by a supreme king with horns
Will I worship him or cease...?

Cease into the space, rise above the mental reign
Afraid the natural and listen to what the looking glass will say...
Unite with my spirit lovers, for the gates are open
And the circle is now complete...
