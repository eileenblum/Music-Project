[Narration:]
ï¿½The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are and the Old Ones shall be
From the dark stars They came before man was born,
Unseen and loathsome They descended to primal earth...ï¿½ *

Among the underwater gardens filled with grief
Beyond the astral landscapes so dark and sorrowful
Where no vital creature may abode and live
A ghastly shadow rises from the deepest caverns
Of once forgotten R'lyeh...

[Narration:]
ï¿½Wantonly the Old Ones trod the ways of darkness
And Their blasphemies were great upon the Earth
All creation bowed beneath Their might
And knew Them for Their wickedness...ï¿½ *

Cloaked in the fiery sombre mists,
The Cthulhu's essense sweeps along the dying Tellus,
No man's eye can see His visual form and rejoice of further living...
Floating through the pale abyssic eclipse,
Through forbidden formulas He summons the Darkest One...

... FINALLY THE SEAL HAS BEEN BROKEN,
CHAOS IS HERE AT LAST...!

[Narration:]
ï¿½After day cometh night; man's day shall pass,
And They shall rule where They once ruled
As foulness you shall know Them
And Their accursedness shall stain the Earth...ï¿½ *
