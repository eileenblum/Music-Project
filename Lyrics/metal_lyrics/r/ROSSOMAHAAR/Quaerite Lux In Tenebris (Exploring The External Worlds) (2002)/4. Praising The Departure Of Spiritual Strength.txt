Welcome to my dearest gallery,
The exhibition of my doubts...
Come inside and rejoice with my philosophy,
Enjoy my faded images of grief...

Welcome to my sweet and scarlet world,
Where wretched conquerors cringe by my feet...
Loathsome often are the human ways,
Since one never knows what awaits him 
Behind that dark and twisted corner...

Pariah for some - idol for the masses
What will be my human end,
Either worthless one, among the visionary ruins,
Or immortality, among the minds of men...?

I keep on following my own way,
Fighting - and feasting upon their condemned souls
Yet one more resistance has been overcome, so to say
This is my path, this is my world, these are my fouls
(... foul-fiends, the dearest ones...)

Yet again you're welcomed in my lair
Yet again you're invited to meet earth's most wanted scum...
Yet again you cross my path and lose your own
Yet again you give birth to indifferent perception... 

Praise the loss of strength, run away in fear
Is this what you've spent your life for?
Praise the lack of energy, humiliate and sear
Is this what you've dreamt those nights of?
Hail yourself, for you're the newborn anchorite 
Is this what you think the life should be alike?

My gallery grows day by day,
Even though I never knew the difference 
Between day and night, for I was born
Blind into this world...
