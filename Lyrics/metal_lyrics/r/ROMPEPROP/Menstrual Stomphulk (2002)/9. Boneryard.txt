[IMPETIGO 1990]

Strolling through my boneyard
A ghoulish midnight stride
A walk among the corpses
Fills my heart with pride...

A score of screaming victims
To me they scream no more
40 or 400 I've lost count
Buried 'neath the earthen floor...

One by one they met their doom
Through macabre &amp; nefarious means
Midnight in my boneyard
The wind blows through the trees...
