Darker days are approaching the storm to us
Rain falls with a potency never seen
The good old days are vanished in the mist of times
But the flame of ancient hordes is still alive
Conflicts are imminent
Be prepared for years of agony in a fearful dark...

We canÂ´t allow dirty governments of tyranny
We must not accept states of impartiality

You have thought we are little more than slaves
But you know we will be only silenced in graves
I think it will be better to pray for us
Because the air is overloaded
With the scents of war
Our pagan roots will show the way...
Ancient writings very occasionally lie...

Turn a deaf ear to the liar flags

WeÂ´re dealt  to their flags...
But too many flags...
DonÂ´t fall with them...
In dark days because they have brought disgrace
Because they have brought dark days...

Who wrote your laws...?
Who break the chains...?
We have no options...
We must free our life of any servilities

Who wrote your laws...?
Who break the chains...?
We have no options...
We must free our life of any servile submissiveness

Dark desires in the moon, have taken control of my dazed soul...
We have been lost in the forest,
Until we have been captivated in its revealing bright...

Away, donÂ´t turn your eyes away from truth... Away

Your mouth is plenty of rubbish
The chests of dirty stolen black old
We have been kneeling down in front of the throne
But the fallen masks uncovered a face that should never be shown

Through the clouded sky
A shinning light
Keep your aims in safe
Even when the dark days hurt...
Disguised but uncovered in time...?

Flags die when their sons deserted them
Gods falls down of their own temples
Every beginning has an ending...
And we have seen the fire on the face of your idols...
