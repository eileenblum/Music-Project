Glory for those who let their fears in past
Having taken the enemies lands
Glory for those who will reach the stars of nightfall
To never come back...
So wait by the side of the almighty Crom...

Words in the wind, I can hear you, I can feel you in
Blowing the sea, to the mountains of Grief
Row to the mist, it is written in our destiny
Words in the wind, take your weapons and shields
Spirit of wind, I can find you as far I can see
Blowing the sea, take a swig of my drink!
Row to the mist, our brothers didnÂ´t die in vain
Spirit of wind, I can hear their screams in my dreams...

From the other side of the Stygian lake
Songs of battles will pray in your name
At war...!

No mercy on your blade
Nor sign of a small benevolence
Never look back or future will clit your throat
Why we fought will be buried into the oblivion
Grant me at last
With the head of the traitor as the price of revenge

Grant me revenge!
Grant me revenge in the name of the proud of the fallen ones
under years of domain
Send me strength through the air of the highest clouds
DonÂ´t let ravens feed their young birds with my entrails...
Arisen from earth!
Alive in our chest!
A new time will come...
To meet the dead

Ice becomes red
As we move forward
The howls of pain
Will be the sound of reward

Many men will be lost in the blood
But much more were sent with no hope in their soul to the eternity...

Eternity
Dream of vanity
I hope be worth
I wonÂ´t deceive you in this world...

Eternity
I feel, be real, at last
Be free, as the ashes in wind...

Unfurl the sails
WeÂ´re going back home
Remember the life as a breeze from the north...
We have the breath
For whom we have fought
Allowing our ships to be drawn towards them...
