Nightmares between the heaven and the promised lands
I feel myself immersed in bitterness
There is no rest for midnight travellers...
... In paths donÂ´t led by a northern star...
When desecrations knock a broken hope
Adversities advise the slaves of hate
Lost, immersed, imprisoned...
IÂ´m fighting versus myself

Maybe the coming days take out the worst of us
Maybe weÂ´re victims of a playing Gods...

Scales have turned the weight of blindness
Against the eyes that gaze at sun...
We have been burnt by its reflections...
In our depths we are slaves of hate
Lost, immersed, imprisoned...
IÂ´m fighting versus myself to (the) death...

The days when we were undefended are gone beyond recall
A fortress of rage has been built inside on my own remains
Reborn from the pain, I take on mistakes
With no regrets...

Intrudes in forbidden lands
Souls in torment which will never find their rest

Ah! DonÂ´t be deceived by a future which never will come
Before the lighting strikes the ground
There is always an spirit which blows in the storm...
Against you
