The flame is in the fire
The fire is in the sky
Thousand coming flaming arrows whistle in the night
Dead bodies hide the landscape
Falling on my side
The smell of flesh makes drunk the senses
DonÂ´t make we waste the time and...

Let me fight... IÂ´ll never be surrendered, I swear
Rise me high... Take me to the glory, in fight...

The soldiers are surrounded
The hangman holds his rope...
DonÂ´t be out of alignment
If you donÂ´t want feed his wolves
The flame is in the fire
The fire is in my eyes
My eyes are burning, My head is turning
You know itÂ´s fate to throw us  back!

When the beams of the moon drank their shelter
It could be listened the counterattack shout
Gods were pleased with the scene of a few, against many...
A cry for help were the last words that many said
Before the sword stab its edge in their necks...
Keep back their troops
DonÂ´t drop your guard
We have strength enough to hurt them all down

IÂ´ll never forgive
I canÂ´t get memories out of my mind
Every promise you did in a past
Was a lance inside the dark

WeÂ´ve been living enclosed in the firing line

WeÂ´ll never defeat
Stronger feelings arise in our hearts
WeÂ´d prefer to die in these damned fields
To decay in captivity...
Sick of standing to behold the pain
Of oppressions which came with the "king of lies"
We canÂ´t know what is, in store for us...
But you will be caught in your own traps...

WeÂ´ve been living enclosed in the firing line

Nine days until we were rearmed
Becoming closer to their hidden camp
Nine whole nights on their trail
Expecting any kind of dirty play

Nine days without repite
You know that many of us remained behind
Moonlight has been ou ally
We are going to defeat you under
The light of the Northern star

When the beams of the moon drank their shelter
It could be listened the counterattack shout
Gods were pleased with the scene of a few, against many...
A cry for help
Will make the punishment to fit your crimes
YouÂ´ll never bring us down...
