Ashes in the emptiness...

ItÂ´s written in the forbidden scrolls...
That the jewel of the black sea should never be found
Confronted nations devastated for gold
Every beast displays an instinct and we learned to destroy...

More than two ages have slowly gone by
And the conquerors desire hasnÂ´t been satisfied...
Another heads, the same stone...
Human being has been corroded by the same snake fangs!
