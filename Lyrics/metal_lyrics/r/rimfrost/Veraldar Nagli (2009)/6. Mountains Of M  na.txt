Our land is our heart
And our land and heart is black
We gave our souls to death
Cursed mountain heights of doom
Cuts through the air and atmosphere
We keep this land of rime ice dark and cold
No one who enter this land will leave
You must stand before the kings

We are the demons in this dimension
We answer to no one
For here we are in command
No one who enters this land will leave
Face your sentence, now kneel!

By the land of rime ice
You stand in fear of us
By the mountains of doom
You tremble in fear of us

the freezing valley appears
The realm we walk
Icy paths leads to our thrones...
