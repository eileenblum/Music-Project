The land of the dead
Lies beyond the fading sun
A horizon cursed
By the last sunbeams of daylight
The human race walks in ignorance...
Far away

A greater end awaits as we pass the clearing
And our journey has begun
A choking mist over earth
Colours the sky in death
Damned we are before its end
Beyond the kingdom of Scandinavium we are led

In here the fallen kings of the north rest
Great warlords as they ones were
Still cold in their graves
As their hatred grows
Soon they will take it back, what they've lost

A flame beyond the fields
A leading star of our men
The road is leading us to a forgotten past
An aeon of bloodshed is yet to come

In here the fallen kings of the north rest
Great warlords as they once were
Still cold in their graves
As their hatred grows
Soon they will claim it back, don't you think it's yours!

Winters darkness and its sweeping veil is here
Winters coldness guide our souls to vengeance
Winters darkness and its sweeping veil is here
Winters sadness and its creeping death is here
