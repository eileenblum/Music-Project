Does it speak again?
As it calls from its source
In the heart of the shadows
On a pale horse it ride
led by the night

It walks through everything
From steel to metal
Cursed in eternity
The flight of the ones who falls
Led by a spell that was told in the night

Do you fear the one?
He walk among us
A shadow you can't see
Arisen from the underground
Do you hear the one?
He ride among us
He's the taker
The harvest is on

There it is again!
As it calls from its source
In the heart of the shadows
A conqueror of life and death
Led by the night

It walks through anything
Through flesh and bone
Cursed in eternity
The flight of the ones who falls
Led by a spell that was told in the night

Do you fear the one?
He walk among us
A shadow you can't see
Arisen from the underground
Do you hear the one?
He ride among us

Over the fields he flies
In a drowning world of lies
Rides through the nocturnal night
As one, as one he took his flight
Over the mountains he rides
Beyond, beyond the fading sun
The last creature alive
He seeks his end...
He seeks his end!
