Rise the banner up high
I stand in the eye of the storm
The heathens marching to war
Heart of the night roars
The battle of the damned

Cold as ice
I summon the demons of a world beyond
As the followers of light follows the stream so bright
I walk my own ground
Alone I stand in the rime of tide
My heart is black
And runs with veins of possession
My madness is a fact

As the shores of Scandinavium
Are coloured red by defend of our tribe
Wings of ravens in the high
Death by a sight, about the warriors in tide

My heart is cold
Cold as ice
I summon the demons of a world beyond
As the followers of light follows the stream so bright
I walk my own ground
Alone I stand
Stand in the rime of tide
My heart is black

When we are marching to the end
Man to man, brothers rise your swords with me again
With triumph in our hands
One and all we stood by our land
One on one we fought til the bitter end
Together we walk in the halls up north!

As the shores of Scandinavium
Are coloured red by defend of our tribe
Wings of ravens in the high
Death by a sight, about the warrior in a time
My madness is a fact
My heart is black
Alone I stand in the tide
