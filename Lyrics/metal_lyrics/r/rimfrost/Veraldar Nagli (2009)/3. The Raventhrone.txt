From a like of fire I rise
Runes from the past has taken it's toll
Prophecy is ending while I'm descending
Resurrected in flesh, bounded by blood

Fear the one who brings death in his hands
Step in my way for your coming curse
Now hear the warriors, long ago dead
Riding lands never seen by a living man

From a like of fire it rises
Runes from the past has taken it's toll
Prophecy is ending while I'm descending
Resurrected in flesh, bounded by blood

And nothing they will see
They won't see me coming

Still the ravenbirds are flying
As the world kneels under my reign
The followers of time are dying
As I slay in a kingdom beyond
My vengeance strikes through hate and hunger
Ravenous
Ravenous is still my fate

Only through vengeance I'll enter the Raventhrone

A plague sweeps the earth, a killing machine unleashed
No kingdom come, only death is real
Now here the warriors
A cry froze in time
Our king is home again

I'm leaving this world behind
To my brothers in the halls up high
I walk this earth on last time
Through the gates of asa land
They ride to me in haze
Our king i home again

I'm leaving this world behind
And I'll enter the kingdom of rime
When I walk the fields of home
Then I know...

I'm leaving this world behind
And I'll enter the kingdom of rime
When I walk the fields of home
Then I know...
The Raventhrone is mine
