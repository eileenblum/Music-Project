I've become what I am
A mankinds disease
I am death incarnated

I bring plague
I am fear I am chaos and I am everywhere
Today the bells tolls for you
And still I am everywhere

In a time forlorn I spread my breath
Venomous and black
To think I just rode the tide
Now hell awaits, my poison is still
still it's black

I exhale

On my enemy's land I stand
A king never beaten down
The fading dawn of men embraces the blackness
Strong I stand
Stand as king

On my enemy's land I rise
A slave towards the throne
The fading dawn of men embraces the blackness
Towards I walk
Walk as king

I exhale
