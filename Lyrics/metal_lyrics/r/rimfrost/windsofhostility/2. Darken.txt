Winter full moon bane
Frozen is the soil
I'm watching the horizon
And the stars that glows in endless darkness

Feeble screams from distant below
And a following roaring
This forest is haunted
The forest conceals me in its shadows

A weapon flects in the nocturnal light
To war
Blood will be spilled on our lands
And it will not ours

The sky is heard
When I lift up my mighty sword again
Enemies are walking our lands
Diabolical we rise

The black hordes of Rime
Tide has turned

Fullmoons bane
Through my heart
As I'm watching the horizon
Winters bane
Through my heart
As the full tide of battle roars

With armor on
Sword in my hand
Demons by my side
We fought this war and won

Wolves eyes awaiting
When ravens seen high on the Darken sky
We are one with the nature... Invisible
North wind blows to our greatness

Feeble screams from distant beyond
And a following roaring
This forest is haunted
The forest conceals me in its shadows

With armor on
Sword in my hand
Demons by my side
We fought this war and won

Releasing my evil desires

Fullmoons bane
Through my heart
When I'm watching the horizon
Winters bane
Through my heart
When the full tide of battle roars
