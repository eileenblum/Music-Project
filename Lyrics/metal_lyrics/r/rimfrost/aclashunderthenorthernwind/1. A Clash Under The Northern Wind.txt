[Music by Throllv/Hravn, lyrics by Throllv]

Beyond the borders of the world
A realm so vast and dark
Frozen hills under sheer white smoke
The enemy cower at the sight of our mark
Our bloodline wears the cloak of the night
Ice runs through our veins
United we stand here to fight
Finally it has come to this day

In the North I'll die

I am the warden of the North
I protect and guard the land
As they harbor under the mountain fort
Cast to black, as they die by my hand

A frozen world remains unseen to man
Beyond the known, past space and time
An ancient world drowns on turning tides

A frozen world remains unseen
Burn, burn them down!

Burning fires, raining blood
On obsidian soil the fallen ones lie on frozen mud
As the night grows cold

[Instrumental]

Burning fires, raining blood
On obsidian soil the fallen ones lie on frozen mud
I rise, I fly
Over white lands
And misty river beds

With blood hot rage
I'll give rise to a plague
Yonder hollow time
A land of ice and rime

[Instrumental]

The frozen world echoes unheard
Beyond the known, past space and time
A quivering universe
The world drowns on turning tides
Night sky fires
Testifies to the coming battle
On the blackest of night
Bear witness to the slaughter of cattle

With blood hot rage
I'll give rise to a plague
Yonder hollow time
A land of ice and rime

Earthquake trembling
Chaos ascending
Beyond the known, past space and time
A raging universe
A kingdom in cold by the kings of old
Rising banners
Testifies the great clash is here
On the blackest of night
We ride to battle, we know no fear!

With blood hot rage
I'll give rise to a plague
Yonder hollowness
A land of the ageless

[Instrumental]

In the shadow of the raven throne
In the shadow of the night

In the shadow of the raven throne
In the shadow of the night

In the shadow of the night
Rip out my heart
Crush my bones
Burn my flesh
Set fire to all I am
Set fire to all I've been

Under a blood red sky
I open my eyes
Our enemy's scattering all over the fields
My battle axe is their bane
The northern wind sings loudly now
At our foes defeat
I am the warden of the North
A son of the nights black sheet

Don't come!
You'll run!
From the Norsemen
High above in the golden halls
Begone!
Succumb!
By the North wind
Long gone chants are once again sung
