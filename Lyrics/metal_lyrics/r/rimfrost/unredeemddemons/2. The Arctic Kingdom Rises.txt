Frost nights white goldWe are the unholy threeThe portals to hell are rising highThe frozen ground is shakingHere they comeBrothers and sonsIn the sign of the winters black soulWe will fightOur kingdom will reign Breathe in the cold airMy sword is shining white The artic kingdom risesDawn and Twilight never reachNever touch the horizonNorth star shines brightEternal solar eclipseLight fades away Ill raise my sword to the starry skyLet my black horse take me to higher groundsAt higher grounds iwill battleHear my kingdom is calling my nameAt the mountains of glaciersIn eternal septh of snowTriumph brothers and sons My heart is cold as iceWinterdemond is arisen
