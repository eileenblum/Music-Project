Im riding through night so coldIm searching for thy christian soulForest filled of haze looking eyes of malliceHymn of glories treesHera my disharmonious voice Oak with frost surrounds thy spiritsKnight so dark approach your flesh so rottenThe sky is filled of solemn darknessWailing cry is heardBy the devil she's defiled She's no longer pure no longer innocentHer soul belongs to me now Her filthy face is guarded by the eyes if crystals carves We're flying over valley of the hoarfrostOur home our landIn a place were the sun never shinesAnd were the blizzard never ends we are the kings
