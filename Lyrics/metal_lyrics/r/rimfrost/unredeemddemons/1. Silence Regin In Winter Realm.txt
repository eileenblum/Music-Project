A horizon is rising beyond the northern starsWhite frost and crystals prevail on the dark mountains of witchcraftThe everending grief which winter feels blows out in snow over fandscapes of ice Where silence reigned in cold winterrealm...Where silence reigned over black mountains In the ancient valley of winterreign demones obey the masters of hoarfrostMasters of the tundra A chilly wins blows in my face as i grievemy ferocious wintersoulThe mourning star is my darkened sorrow for this land of laying waste Silence reigned in cold winterrealm of fiendeSilence reigned over black dragons of mountains
