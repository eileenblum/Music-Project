It echoes, it echoes in the wind of fate
The wind is a breeze of ice and snow
For you to die in its mighty burden
It's the calm before the storm

Summoning the demons
The invoke of a new era
For your destiny to show you
Its truth stands written in time
We are the unredeemed
The unredeemed demons
Flying together again brothers and sons
To the final holocaust

Blow the horn
For the hordes to come
Giving evil a face
Now hear them marsch
There's a fire burning inside of us all
An ancient curse
A sign of the coming apocalypse
Rites from the nocturnal
Straight from hell

Through the raging storms
Its messenge stands clear
For all who fears them
Its name echoes in time
Hordes of Rime

A heart of cold solid rock
Built from the ashes of the so called life
Can you see it blazing
Through out the woods
The hatred burns,
Like an eternal fire through skin

Through the raging storms
Its messenge stands clear
For all who fears them
its name echoes in time
Hordes of Rime

From the raging storms of hell
An army of a thousands dead
True are the warriors who rides by our side
They are the hordes
Hordes of Rime
