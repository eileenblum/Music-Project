Beyond the way ravens avoid to fly
On icy paths horses refuse to ride
A never blessed land
In this dimension evil takes root

The moon is the source of light
In valleys and hills far away
Northernmost the mountains rest
A land untouched so pure it lay

The tale has been told before
A mystic land no man ever seen

A myth of eternal blizzard
In the stormy land of Rime
At the frosty gates of winter
They were seen
In blazing fire, in ashes it dies
Winds of hostility blows the horizon

When demons rode the sky
From fire to ice
A frozen world unknown
Pitch black caves of glaciers
Death from above
A frozen world unknown

Follow me to a time unknown
Follow me to the world i show
Into A Frozen World Unknown
Come with me to ages ago
Follow me
Into A Frozen World Unknown

A long time ago
North, in the black mountainchains
Steel meets rock
Those who created this land
Those who strikes the hammer
Deeply in the mountainhalls

Lightning strikes the dwarflords axe
This deed was never forgotten
So when you're walking our lands
Remember who rules this world
Honour this land
Never breathe here
But every single man
Who here rest his foot
Falls
