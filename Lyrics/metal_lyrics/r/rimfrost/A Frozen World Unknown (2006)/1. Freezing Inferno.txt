"The judgement day is here
Far from the north
Ancient rites sets us free
Unhallowed we aproach
Winters cold biting nights
Everthing lies frozen
The world has ended
This is the Freezing Inferno"

When the light of the human race fade
The last sundown for earth to live
The arrival of the four is near
Horsemen of doom
We fly with them on the apocalypse
Ruling the worlds destiny
With it's future in our hands
The decision has been made

Destructive souls of mankind
Weak and morbid
They will be sent beneath
To rest in agony
The wise men who once spoke
About the worlds destruction
Their visions turned to gold
When the final era lived through

When darken embrace the skies
We look down at empty eyes
The tide has turn
For you to burn
A curse has been told
The reaper at hold
And he takes you away
He will return for more

The judgement day is here
Far from the north
Ancient rites sets us free
Unhallowed we aproach

Winters cold biting nights
Everthing lies frozen
The world has ended
In this Freezing Inferno
