Here I stand again
Standing proud and unconqered
Are you prepared
To meet my furious evil
Here I stand again
With thousands of brave men
A horn echoes in the wind
With drawn weapons to battle we go
I run in the front line

You have gathered here today
Never to return
When I run in your way
I let my axe speak
A never spoken language
Will I be the one
The one who once return
Oh... I'll be the one
The one who forever stands strong

I laugh when I send you to your god
When I have slayed your legions
To the very last man
I smile when your fortress burns to the ground

Our enemies are lying dead
Many has fallen today
On the lonely road to the Mighty Halls They'll Walk
Many northman they arrive
Up in the north they rest
They watching you step by step
Brave men who wants their revenge
They'll meet you up in the north again

When my destiny is calling
Hundreds of men I have slayed
With my twinaxe I'm walking
The lonely roads so pale
When my destiny has brought me home
My kinsman are standing strong
With war-paint and armor
Weapons drawn to the sky

They welcome their leader
With a final hail

Oh... On black wings i arrived
To my army on the other side
Listen to the wind
The dark age has arrived
Now hear the battle cries
We rise again
Mighty we reign
