The battle of the damned has ended
And the mist sweeps over the unholy earth
Ashes of the soil
The course is set
Bringing back from death
Breathing in the brimstone
The graves of the unhallowed are opened
I am entering the shadows of the fallen
The ressurection of the wicked three
Has begun...

Wide opened eyes
Death a moment away
These eyes once again glows with hatred
Bringning back fear to life
In thoose we call sinners
We mimic the hell as we know it
Pain lives through us

Wandering the silent grounds
Led by the choirs of the dead
We play the symphony of the wicked three
For each note played one man falls

Striking with a force
A force you never thought existed
Like the strenght of a thousands storms
The battle roars
We harvest the holy souls
To be banished from ifes light
Prepare yourself for us
You wear the crown of thorns

Got you!
Surrender on knees to be conversed
Like lightning to the ground
In a blackened sky
We spare no one to nothing
Only pain, strong as thunder
And a mighty blow

As you lie dying
I can feel ou breath
Thick as blood
This is how we revenge your sins
With the dark gods power
We ride the unsacred storms
Buried forever, bounded to the other side
