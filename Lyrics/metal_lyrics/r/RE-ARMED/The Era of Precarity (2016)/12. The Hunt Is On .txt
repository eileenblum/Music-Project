The hunt is on! One day you will wake up and ask yourself; How much more I
can take? Along the way you will understand, this world is absolute
nonsense - Heartache, carnage, devours this world - Rituals of profane
bloodshed - The hunt is on! There's a void that needs to be filled - Live
the statement: Kill or be killed! Degeneration will be complete as mankind
decays to obsolete - Heartache, carnage, devours this world - Rituals of
profane bloodshed - The hunt is on! Trust in me, I trust no one except
myself - Me, myself and I! Heartache, carnage, devours this world -
Rituals of profane bloodshed - The hunt is on!
