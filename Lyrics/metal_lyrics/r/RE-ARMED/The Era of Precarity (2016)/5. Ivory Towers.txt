Do you really think that they care where you come from and who you are?
They are seperating people like a human cattle - The wolves from the sheep
- Inside their filthy minds is found a sickening - Need to control
everything from the great ivory towers - Perseverance holds a key for the
hour of reprisal - Deny, all these lies, what they've been hiding from us
- Inside their filthy minds is found a sickening - Need to control
everything from the great ivory towers - No more waiting for a change of
seasons - Revived to fight against all odds - Don't let them decide are
you dead or alive! Blessed be thy serpent sons - Those who dominate -
Slithering like rats and snakes from the great ivory towers - Don't let
them decide are you dead or alive!
