The kingdom of slaughters and dealers - Imperium - Burning the shelters
that we called home - The price of ignorence - Ignorence! These wastelands
buried our dreams of hope - Memorial - We became cursed beyond belief -
Its needless for us to pray for empathy and burn in redemption - They
don't understand - Who sends the storm steers the vessel - Bow down to the
void - Darkness decends upon us all - Rising global genocide - Demolition
is a part of the new world order - Apathy is forcing us to sleep -
Narcolepsy - Mimicking, panicking and hating the things that made us fear
- Fear the unknown - Hail the leaders of deception - Dancing with the dead
under the harvest moon - Bow down to the void - Darkness decends upon us
all - Rising global genocide - Demolition is a part of the new world order
- Our freedom is taken! Taken! Our freedom is taken! Bow down to the void
- Darkness decends upon us all - Rising global genocide - Demolition is a
part of the new world order
