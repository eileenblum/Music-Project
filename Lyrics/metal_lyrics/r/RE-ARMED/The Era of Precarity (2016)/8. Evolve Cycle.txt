Stand up! Working as a slave for the corrupt system - Combine forces - All
the victims of the treadmill - The stress is overwhelming - Mistakes,
calling my name - The last line of self-defense - These eyes of
desperation, seen in the broken mirror - Taking another cursed step once
again - Again and again - Chained to a hourglass - Paralyzed in the
silence - Failing for eternity - Trying to reach the skies - Turn on, tune
in, drop out - Enough! Enough is enough! - Taking back what they took from
us - Sacrifices need to be revenged - Tearing down these empty walls - No
one is safe from this rebirth - Making the final judgement - There is no
turning back - Destroying every single thing - Awakened to have a meaning
in this roulette of life - Reformation has begun - Our strenght is knowing
we are the underdogs - Combine forces - Hear the roars of resurrection -
Resurrection!
