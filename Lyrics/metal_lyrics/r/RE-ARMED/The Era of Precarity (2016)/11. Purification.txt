Furious winds whip up billions of tiny sand grains into massive walls of
death and destruction - The flat land rolls away to horizon - The sky
pressing down like a dark blanket - Just before your eyes! Volcanos erupts
and spits compounds of lava, ash, dust and gas into the night sky - This
is the last time you see the stars - Monster storms, ice caps melting,
raging wildfires - Purification - Ongoing decay created by carbon based
lifeforms - Like a self-fulfilling prophecy in motion - Right before your
eyes - Chaos never ends! Respect the existence! Expect the resistance!
Nature is ripping apart everything what we love - Humans days are numbered
- Futile screams of SOS - Oceans are filled with bodies - Tidal waves of
toxic waste - Mass of rotting corpses - Storms collide and waters rise -
Storms collide, waters will rise, winds of plague - Purification - Ongoing
decay created by carbon based lifeforms - Like a self-fulfilling prophecy
in motion - Right before your eyes - Revenge of the planet earth is
shredding us to pieces - Respect the existence! Revenge of the planet
earth burns down the human nature - Expect the resistance! Respect the
existence! Expect the resistance! Respect! Expect!
