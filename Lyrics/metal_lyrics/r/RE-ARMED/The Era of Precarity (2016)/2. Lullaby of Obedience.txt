I am the fear that keeps you wake at night - The one who makes you crawl -
Get back in line - I am the guilt that's ripping your guts inside -
Twisting your thoughts - Commit suicide - You better keep your head up
high - You better not close your eyes - I want you to sing with me this
twisted lullaby; We are living in the era of precarity - Forced to kneel,
obey and apologize for our existence - I am the rage that's growing up
inside - The lost and found - What you've left behind - I am the shame -
You know it cuts like a knife - Deep down inside you know you're living a
lie - You better keep your head up high - You better not close your eyes -
You're living a lie - You better keep your head up high - You better not
close your eyes - I want you to sing with me this twisted lullaby; We are
living in the era of precarity - Forced to kneel, obey and apologize for
our existence - Step by step closer to the edge - Signs and symptoms of
mental breakdown - Breath by breath, inch by inch - Trying to stay alive -
Inhale, exhale - Just hold your breath now - We are living in the era of
precarity - Forced to kneel, obey and apologize for our existence
