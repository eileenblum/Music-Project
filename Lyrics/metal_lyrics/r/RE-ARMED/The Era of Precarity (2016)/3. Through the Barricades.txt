The past is written in a stone - The ink is already dry - When all is said
and done - No compromises need to be done - May the bridges we burn light
the way for revolution - Rise up and revolt - Stand up for something or
you will fall - This is hell on earth and we are the living dead - Cutting
the roots, stabbing the eyes, eating the hearts of surveillance - Dreams
turn into nightmares and shadows will fall.. Through the barricades we
roam ruthlessly to resist - Follow the leaders and destroy yourselves -
Lifeless or breathing? My question still stands - Where is the focal point
to find away out? The rejection of an early grave - Spinning the roulette
of life - Betting it all on one spin - What the future holds? The tables
may have turned - Blinded to believe that there would be a moonlit future
- Sink in to evil and reclaim what you're worth for - This is hell on
earth and we are the living dead - Cutting the roots, stabbing the eyes,
eating the hearts of surveillance - Dreams turn into nightmares and
shadows will fall.. Through the barricades we roam ruthlessly to resist -
Revolution!
