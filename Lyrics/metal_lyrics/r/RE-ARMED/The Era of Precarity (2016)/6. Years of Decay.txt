Torn apart from the inside out - Circles are closing in - Where is the
light? End of the line? How would you describe yourself; Sleepless?
Breathless? Hopeless? Dauntless? Restless? Graceless? Relentless? Open up
and spill your guts - Make an honest mess 'til your kingdom of dirt
swallows the last drop of hope - Wipe! Wipe your mouth there's still a
tiny bit of bullshit around your lips - Words can light wildfires! After
ego collapses only the flames remain - Explore the promissed land and
become the chosen one - Fearless? Reckless? Hopeless? Dauntless? Heedless?
Tearless? Regardless? Embrace these years of decay - I, I can't stand -
I'd rather be hurt with the truth - I am not comfort with a lie - Words
can light wildfires! Torn apart from the inside out - Circles are closing
in - Where is the light? End of the line? How would you describe yourself?
After ego collapses only the flames remain - Explore the promissed land
and become the chosen one
