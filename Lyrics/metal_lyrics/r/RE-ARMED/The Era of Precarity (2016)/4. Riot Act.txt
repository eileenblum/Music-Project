Seeking fearlessly a new life meaning - Days are everblack - Life is
fading - Scream or suffocate - Taste madness - We live in a minefield -
Forever - Betrayed, enslaved another thousand years - All they care about
is money, fame and power - Define our absence - Infect the system -
Remember these words; I owe you nothing - Reaching out for a better escape
from this degeneration - Violence cleans up the streets - The darkest
hearts will prevail - Morals are bankrupt - Don't trust anyone - Lives are
thrown away - Forsaken - Rise to retaliate - There's no second change -
Redeem the paradise - Forbidden - Increase the pressure - Behold
extinction - Welcome to the land of greatest griefs - Receive the beating
- Beware of monsters - Controlled by murderers and thiefs - Reaching out
for a better escape from this degeneration - Violence cleans up the
streets - The darkest hearts will prevail - I owe you nothing - You owe me
everything - I owe you nothing!
