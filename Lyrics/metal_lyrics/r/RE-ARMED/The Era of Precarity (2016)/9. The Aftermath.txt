The leaves of grace have been fallen - Human values are forgotten - Break
the mirror what once was sacred - What have we learned? Because we are;
Concealed by corruption - With margins of freedom - Defilement of human
race - Embraced by destruction - Smother in toxic truth - Observe the
oblivion - Democracy, now burned to the ground - Situation must be
sustained - Hypocrisy, destroying the weakest minds - We shall see who
survives - Deconstruction day after day - In the end there's nothing to
save - I can't stand the price we have to pay for our freedom - There's no
point - There's no reason - Aftermath of a war - War! Deconstruction day
after day - In the end there's nothing to save - Democracy, now burned to
the ground - Situation must be sustained - Hypocrisy, destroying the
weakest minds - We shall see who survives
