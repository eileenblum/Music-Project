That's the way the story goes again and again, Trapped between the judgment
Hole that never ends, God says that truth can only dignify, Honesty in all its
ways in all should guide

But riding in the common would, Framed we are to see, Every time we play it
"straight", Get's so hard to "achieve"

S.H.O.U.T. So I think S.H.O.U.T.

Sweating out the quest of my humanity, I rely in all my faith simplicity
God, I say that truth can only dignify, But honesty in all it's ways sometimes
Misguide

Cause riding in the common world, Fremed we are to see, Every time we play
It "straight", Get's so hard to "achieve"
So I think...

S.H.O.U.T. So I think... S.H.O.U.T.

Sometimes Honesty Only Upsets Truth S.H.O.U.T. S.H.O.U.T. And Truth is!?...
