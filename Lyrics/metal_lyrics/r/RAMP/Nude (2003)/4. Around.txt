Choosing a tape, I settle down the better mood, Ignition is on ready for my inquietude
I step for the road with no stop inside my head, leaving behind four walls that almost drove me mad

So taking the wheel, I reveal all my bounds, I shun I evade, I get lost I get found
Cruising I flee, Getting the, Most profound, I drift and I fade,  Through the road I'm around

Driving around I find myself and all my doubts, The love and the hate the litle things that
Life's about, So facing the movement, I can keep my mind away
Enough to believe that I can sort things out and be okay

So taking the wheel, I reveal all my bounds, I shun I evade, I get lost I get found
Cruising I flee, Getting the, Most profound, I drift and I fade,  Through the road I'm around

So taking the wheel, I reveal I get found, I shun I evade, Through the road
I'm around
