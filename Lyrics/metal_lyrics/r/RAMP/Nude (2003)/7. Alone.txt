I, feel the time, slowly drifting in my veins, Memories, remains
Confined, I'm alive, somewhere by the autumn leaves, Falling in between

'Cause no one's there to hold my head up high, No one's there to peace my mind

Alone, lies my soul, I'm so cold, I'm afraid, To find hollow life
Sleepless night, empty days

Opaque fading eyes stumble in my face, Through the crowd I forsake
Demised I'm aside weaked by the lonely haze, Of no point, no aim

'Cause no one's there to hold my head up high, No one's there to peace my mind

Alone, I'm afraid, To find hollow life, Sleepless nights, empty days

Alone...
