Caught, Caught, Caught, Caught

I see the shame in you and makes me wanna smile, The acts you disapproved
now settle down your trial

The moral of refuse, The guilty of excuse, spitting in cite, Sieving in life
...and makes me wanna smile... ...and makes me wanna smile...

Caught, Caught, Caught, Caught

You failed just like me once so criticized, Now feel how hard it is, to heal and pacify

The moral of refuse, The guilty of excuse, spitting in cite, Sieving in life
...and makes me wanna smile... ...and makes me wanna smile...

Caught, Caught, Caught, Caught
