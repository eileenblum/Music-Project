Secrets, Little hides, The other things, The b-sides, The alter facts
The unknown, The inner self's, The unshowned

And so it's written on these lines, Seven deadly sins, Ancient flames on human shrine
Evil creed

The sickly Pride the Gluttony, The filthy Lust and all the Envy
The selfish sloth the blinded wrath, The Greedy lies that wrap our path

And so it's written on our lives, human policy, what we show and what we are
Ambiguity

Secrets seal all these faces calls, Little burning weeds
So you and I we are black and White, Choosing what to be, Besides...

the litle girls the Gluttony, the Filthy Lust the obscenity
The Greedy lies the blinded Wrath, The sickly Pride The selfish Sloth
The Envy the control, The vanity the leading role

Secrets seal all these faces calls, Little burning weeds
So you and I we are black and White, Choosing what to be, Besides...
