Prime, prime, prime, prime

I see the sun turning into shade, I see the spark turning into violent flame
I see the love turning into rage, Givin' me a part of it, a part of every stage

Givin' me my sight, Givin' me my strife, Crossways, Crossways

I see the end turning into start, I see an all turning into a just a part
I see the small turning into wide, Givin' me a part of it, a part of every side

Givin' me my sight, Givin' me my strife, Crossways, Crossways

And makes me go insane, Blows me away, To feel the down this life, So unwind
Leaving behind, Foward to find, Questing reply, Searching prime, Prime

So everyday I twist, And try to snatch my role, But then again I miss
The artifice of control, I can't stop this turbulence that shakes my logic mind
I can't stop this evidence, yeah, everything's a sign
Crossways, Crossways
