So many times, I taste the flavor of defeat, The ending line for a moment incomplete
A broken vouce, a broken heart, a broken sky, I feel so aside

Drop, Drop down, Drop, Drop down

Uncertainty drawn me back into the field, Once again, I dream about what could be real
I push it hard I take it out to the extreme, I try to redeem

Drop, Drop down, Drop, Drop down

I suffocate inside I crawl, I'm closing in I can't recall, The smile I had upon my face
The love I had yet enlace

Let it out, let it out, let ir out, 
Let it out, let it out, let ir out, 
Let it out, let it out, let ir out, 
Let it out, let it out... Drop Down

So taking life by the way that it should be, Sometimes it's best to rely and set things free
Giving a chance opening and letting it through, I star something new

Drop, Drop down
