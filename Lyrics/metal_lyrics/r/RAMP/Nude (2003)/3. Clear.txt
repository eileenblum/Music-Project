I swallow hate from your betrayal and face deception flood, Surrounded by the tryth that things will never return, Again, The same its not what used to be, Now it's a new reality
Now things are turning clear

I've followed you until the end believing every word, For me you where the sanity against the most absurd, A guide, a friend, An Honest understand, A faithful healing Holy land

So insane, Now I break ...and try to turn things... Clear

I know that I have made mistakes but that's the way it is, I don't deny that somehow I have made you Shed some tears, But all I keep it's what I can't forget, You're give up, my regret

Thrown away, Now I face ...That I must turn things... Clear
