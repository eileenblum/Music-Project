Diving in and diving out, Between the past, I lose myself to find, Somehwere a path
Giving the best of me, I fall so blind, Living my memories, On present Hides
Grows the pale sin, And I deny, to seal what is so real, everyday I die by my hands
To feel...
Sane, Sane, Sane, Sane, Insane

Dying in and dying out, Im so obsessed, Wasting my dignity, On something fast
Fading the best of me, I can't resign, living my memories, On present times
Grows the pale sin, And I deny o seal what is so real, Everyday I die by my hands
To feel...
Sane, Sane, Sane, Sane, Insane
