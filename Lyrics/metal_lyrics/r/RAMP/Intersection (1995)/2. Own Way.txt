Wake up man don't be afraid
Of the story of your life
See all these things we do
Do you think they're right?! 

Think
There's a time for us to learn
To approach, to imitate
But there's a time to build
A way we can create 

Facing one more day
Where everything seems so grey
You pay the price you have to pay
Fighting for your own way 

Take it out from yourself
Face this truth you have to fight
Grab your future in your hand
Turn it into something bright 

Scream it out and be yourself
Proud within your own beliefs
And never ever stop to think
That you can't reach your deepest dreams 

Facing one more day
Where everything seems so grey
You pay the price you have to pay
Fighting for your own way 

Our own way 

I do believe in my own way
In steps I take among these days
So you don't care if people stare
We can't all say what we all say 

Each one should have his own way 

So I leave you with this tale
For you to carry on
Just think about this questions
We're living on 

There's so much yet to find
To discover to combine
Just have an open view
An open mind 

Still... 
Facing one more day
Where everything seems so grey
You pay the price you have to pay
Fighting for your own way
