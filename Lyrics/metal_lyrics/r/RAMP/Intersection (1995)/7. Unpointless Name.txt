Born to rule our own existence
To make prevail all the community sight
It seems so understood all the causes for it's nature
But there's a view to take another side 

See
All that we might say
By a book of rules
Can be so well twisted
Into some name tool 

So I
Face all these lies you say
See you rape my life
Through my unpointless name
In my name... name... name... named pointless unpointless name 

Laws should be our true defense
To rule to teach the common sense
But overpowered hands switched this direction
And innocence is granted by the right connection 

See
All that we might say
By a book of rules
Can be so well twisted
Into some name tool 

So I
Face all these lies you say
See you rape my life
Through my unpointless name
In my name... name... name... named pointless unpointless name 

And Everything is made in the name of justice... justice... justice 

So I
Face all these lies you say
See you rape my life
Through my unpointless name
In my name... name... name... named pointless unpointless name
