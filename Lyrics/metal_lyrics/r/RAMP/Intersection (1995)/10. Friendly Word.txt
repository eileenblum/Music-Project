Friend these words I write and think of you
In all the pain my silence dragged you into
I can't belive now, how could I have been so cold?
To you my friend, to close my eyes to leave you all alone

So down I felt ashamed
afraid to try
To share my love
A word, a smile

Friend this blame, this cross I bear with me
Remembering your face, this truth now I start to see
These are things that we think but they aren't quite the same
And moral can be so immoral, insane
To judge to chose this love we can exchange

So wrong I felt ashamed
afraid to try
To share my love
A word, a smile

Now friend I understand
How love can change a man
How strong can be a word
A friend, a friendly word

Friendly word...
