Through friends we feel
The sense of life
Through love we seal
The point of life
Through the hate we show our pain
This fire kept inside our brain
Through humanity
This we see 

Through war we show
We show our race
Through loss we cry
Unforgotten faces
Through the time we learn to wait
To improve through our mistakes
Through God we try
To justify 

Blame... I see it through
Life... Ain't nothing but a clue
Feel... Be more than wise
Learn... You're wasting to much of your time 

Life's a drug, we all take
Life is pain, it's a mistake
Life is shame, life is clear
Life is strenght, life is fear
Life's a trail with many stones
Different flesh, different bones
Life's a mess, life's a clue
Life is what you're passing through 

Through 

Blame... I see it through
Life... Ain't nothing but a clue
Feel... Be more than wise
Learn... You're wasting to much of your time 

Through life we dream
And through life we kill
Brother's, through
