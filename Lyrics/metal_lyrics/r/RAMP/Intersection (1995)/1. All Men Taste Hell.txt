All we are created
Created with ambitions
So different ways are taken by
Different life submissions 

Freedom, career, money, priden
Human relations, family life
Crossroads positions we choose and try
But still we all have lies 

All men taste hell
All men taste this hell 

Still living for ideals
We slip away through time
For something we give ourselves
But something we leave behind 

All men taste hell
All men taste this hell 

This hell 

Balance
We all search for
Frustration
We're all slaves of 

All men taste hell
All men taste this hell 

This hell
