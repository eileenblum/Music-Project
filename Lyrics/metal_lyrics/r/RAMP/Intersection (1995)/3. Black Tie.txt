You're awake
To a new view of life
A new level of mind state 

You're afraid
Of what should be the end to see
What next it's going to be 

In my life, in my race
I've wasted so much space 

Seemed to be
Far away
Now you taste
Your mistakes... waiting for the black tie 

You're depressed
Now you'd like to turn back
Life ain't just success 

You're redeemed
Now you cry and you know why
You've missed the real sense of life 

Seemed to be
Far away
Now you taste
Your mistakes... waiting for the black tie 

You take them all out
In this hell you see
You pay for all your blames
But your life is gone you see
To cold endless pain 

Seemed to be
Far away
Now you taste
Your mistakes... waiting for the black tie 

You're... dead
