Infight I see the world
A war of pride
Big business so well known
For sale all human rights 

Hands shake in action
Peaceful intentions
Honest promises 

Suitcases weapons
Starvation happens
Heartfelt policy 

So you say
Hollow tales
So you say
Hollow tales 

The face of consequence
A thousand cries
A speech of confidence
A tale to justify 

Hands shake in action
Peaceful intentions
Honest promises 

Suitcases weapons
Starvation happens
Heartfelt policy 

So you say
Hollow tales
So you say
Hollow tales
