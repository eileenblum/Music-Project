I, I rom through everywhere
I, I've quitted stop taking care
Cause I, I've used up all my strenght
From life I'm gone into this dawn
Trying just to keep on hanging on 

Tied walking through this night
So afraid of my life
In this trip I try to see 

I, I try to breath again
Yeah I, I try to start once again
Cause I, I have to have some faith
To pray for a goal for the day for a sight
To leave everything to feel right 

Tied walking through this night
So afraid of my life
In this trip I try to see 

So I face my face on the mirror's day
In search of a gleam of a smile
Of my pure lost innocence
Of all that I had left behind
But wishes are far away
Away from what they used to be
Now from life from existence
Nothing else I can see... So I
Free myself
Away to feel
Something new 

Tied walking through this night
So afraid of my life
In this trip I try to see
