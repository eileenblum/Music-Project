I'm straight in line
Like a machine
Down numb's parade
Now I have to be... like you 

Strictly deprived
Of will, liberty
I think about all the freedom of choice
In all this crap that we call democracy 

Captive throught your bind
Engaged forced to "fight" 

Chained by your sense
Why? Can't you see?
I have my life
My own war my moral dignity 

And this ain't the right place for me, to be 

Here I'm now so brave
A servant a maid
Blinded, castrate
Manhood outraged... like you 

Deep I feel so abased
And I think all about the prank
That is gonna face the same 

Free will, choice could find
Right soldiers for this "fight" 

Chained by your sense
Why? Can't you see?
I have my life
My own war my moral dignity 

Like you 

Call me slacker call me scum
But don't love a gun... like you 

Chained by your sense
Why? Can't you see?
I have my life
My own war my moral dignity 

I don't wanna be... like you
