Smileless faces parking cars in the streets
We see this misery 

AND 

While we close our eyes it grows constantly
The richness made by poverty 

In this arms... you can see this pain 

There's no mind... lost
They're all snatched to the same 

So I'm walking in this maze
Nothing seems to change
What I have to face
It's no fate 

Endless human sacrifice
It grows on
Do you think it's god will? 

NO 

But we keep on just pretending to feel
And neverminding what is real 

So I'm walking in this maze
Nothing seems to change
What I have to face
It's no fate 

So I'm trying to define
What I feel inside
Nothing more than hate
To this fate 

Yeah, cause this is no kind of fate
