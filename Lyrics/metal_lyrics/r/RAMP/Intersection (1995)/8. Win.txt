Can you see it in this way
Life is just a long day
In the journey of ourselves 

But there's so much we can do
To believe in and make true
And all depends on you 

So you, so you keep on dreaming by yourself
Cause:
Where we live, how we die
It's just a thing to see outside 

Real truth it's inside
It's what we want to be 

So you've got to win, win for yourself 

So you've got to win 

No one seems to understand
What's the point of our life's plan
The aim we're living for 

So they scream into our ears
Stiring up our biggest fears
In this life we're gonna face 

But you, but you keep on dreaming by yourself
Cause:
Where we live, how we die
It's just a thing to see outside 

Real truth it's inside
It's what we want to be 

So you've got to win, win for yourself 

So you've got to win 

So I leave you with my own advice
Ain't no one better than you to know what is right
In your feelings there is your plan
And in your life you're the real boss, man
Keep on searching in yourself
Ain't no answer in someone else 

So you've got to win, win for yourself 

So you've got to win 

Yeah, someday we got to win
