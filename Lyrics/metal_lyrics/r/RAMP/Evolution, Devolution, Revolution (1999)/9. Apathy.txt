Yeah, we all went blind
Wearing masks of life
Forgetting what was done
Done for ourselves
Yeah, we all seem tied
Selfish hypnotised
Going slitly mad
Throwing away

All that magic youth
Of our strong refuse

Yeah, we all went blind
Wearing plastic smiles
Wasting what we've done
Trowing away

All that magic youth
Of our strong refuse
All our history
All our fights

Wake me up, I'm blind
APATHY
Cut my ropes, I'm tied
APATHY
Slap my face, my mind
APATHY
Bring me back to life
APATHY
