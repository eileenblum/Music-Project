Come into real world
Find that you're not alone
See that we all must be
An active voice of society

For joy for pain
For love remain
For truth for peace
Unchain release

Come
Come
Come
Come

Come and show an attitude
Don't base liveon excuse
Come and bring your different sight
Your different view of what is right

If You're there

(music: Ramp, lyrics: Rui Duarte)
