Fear, fear's a word that blends
Feelings of a constant change
Upon a trail
Gold, gold is memory throne
That shines the strenght to face the unknown
That keeps us high in this sky of life

For old times sake
For old times sake
We roll the dice

Unroll, lies a future bold
A tale, a secret to be told
Our destiny
So days, days just flow away
Across this game we play
That we can't stop
Till our dying pray

For old times sake
For old times sake
We roll the dice

Just like an endless wheel
Our path is to move on
To take the better thrill
And go on

For old times sake
For old times sake
We roll the dice
