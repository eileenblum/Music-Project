Holy lines
Bible vine
Spring almighty voice
Shared faith
Common grace
Light upon a different choice
Moral rules distinct tools
Frame divine approach
Modern trails classic tales
Sail upon this sacred coast

A belief so divine purified spell
Congregates human race
On his own created hell

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Roman church
Leading curse
Preaching middle age
Confiscates human life
Through a simple condom cage
New born sekt's
Growing facts
That can't be refused
Issue of a social life
Of an abyss we accuse

A belief so divine purified spell
Congregates human race
On his own created hell

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
