Close your eyes
Free your reasons guide
Take a breath of simple life
Feel the air coming through your soul
Dragging you into unknown

For a while, just fly, just let it flow
For a while, just slide, just let it go
For a while, don't mind, just take it slow
For a while, taste time and feel your own, roam

So wipe the tears
From your raging smile
Settle down your trembling mind
Waste your fears make'em go away
Feed your strenght to break this strain

For a while, just fly, just let it flow
For a while, just slide, just let it go
For a while, don't mind, just take it slowv
For a while, taste time and feel your own, roam
