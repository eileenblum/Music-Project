Morning wakes within the sun
Blows a silent breeze
Falling dew enchants the air
With fragance streams

A new day is set
In way to fulfil
All his nature course
But feeding the wheel
Of live is revealed that we're not alone

Roles unknown
Roles unknowed
Cold blended scourge fills the air
Mutated sins fill the air

The air, the death twisted air

Basic things we've took for granted
Seem now to unseal
Human size on natures soul
We try to steal

And millions of lives fade in decease
Throught mans disrespect
Bursting a fight of unbalanced concealed
Breathing others debt
