Here we stand again chatting with our heads
About all the things we think
We should already have
Cause we try it real hard we've given all our best
But still we're so confined related to our past
It's all the same
It never change 

Pressurised within competition
Wrestling for a chance
Feeding hope against the addiction
Rights of an equal admission sense

Helping hands inherit lives
Helping friends for us denies
If we could only try

Honesty integrity
Values that no value have
All we get is the sympathy
Of a cousin of a sister's friend

Helping hands inherit lives
Helping friends for us denies
If we could only try
Helping hands
Helping hands

They twist and break our hopes
Through their friendly works
They drag us down and steal
What is so real

So caught between our expectations
And our parent lives
It ain't so easy to carry on
Building dreams so high

Helping hands inherit lives
Helping friends for us denies
