Lost in the gutter
a face behind the shame
Just hangs for another
Another hollow day

Begging hands
Modern man?
Mystified
Social plans

Unknown undercover
Dispised by the same
Alone as no others
A house, a friend, a name

Begging hands
Modern man?
Mystified
Social plans

Noone rejected as a bastard son
Noone submitted to silence a man can be noone

Begging hands
Modern man?

Noone rejected as a bastard son
Noone submitted to silence a man can be noone
