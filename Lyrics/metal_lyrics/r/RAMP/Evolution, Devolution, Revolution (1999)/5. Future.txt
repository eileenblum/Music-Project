What is ours...
What is ours...

Slowly as some actions save quickly man destroys
Possibilities to embrace a future joy

Crime...
Crime...

Profits raise inhuman race seller's of our youth
Desert seas vanished trees unvoided truth

Crime...
Crime...

Yeah no one cares, we just stare, watching crime assign
Yeah we dispise and waste our pride giving all away

Betting what's our... 

Future... Future... Future... 

What is ours... 

Yeah no one cares, we just stare, watching crime assign
Yeah we dispise and waste our pride giving all away
Betting what's our...

Future... Future... Future...
