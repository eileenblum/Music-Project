Walking in this world of secrets
You grow inside
Awakening through the years you live
To the powers of mind

So many things are said
Of this maze of misery
The light we hold inside
But we cannot see

Search your truth
Behind the wall
Search your truth
Behind the wall

From the Budas of Nepal
Through the oriental seas
"Mighty stories" are told
Things "out of reality"

Self control they all say
Of your spirit of your mind
The step for us to reach
A different time

Search your truth
Behind the wall
Search your truth
Behind the wall

So awake begin to realise
That you just know a tiny part of your mind
Close your eyes send yourself into yourself
Seek inside and maybe you will find
The truth of mind... mind

But:
Through the years of your life
Other things you have earned
Pre-conditions on your mind
"Mighty truths" that you have learned
Of your spirit of your mind

So, if you want to find
Things that are behind this prision
You must climb this wall we've built
This so called "Wall of reason"

Search your truth
Behind the wall
Search your truth
Behind the wall
