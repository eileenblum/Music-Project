Another friend had gone away
There is no place I'd like to stay
Another girlfriend lost again
I just can't suffer this pain

I can feel deep inside
There's something wrong with me
I think I know what it is
But nobody else can see

Born in the wrong time
And in the wrong place too
There's nothing I like in this world
And nothing I like to do

I'm not turning crazy
I only see what is bad
Because I'm a realistic
I'm not some kind of mad

Disillusions growing day by day
No reason to be alive
Disillusion there is no escape from them
In this wrong place and time

My soul is empty, my life is in vain
I only see eyes looking at me, as if I was insane

Disillusions growing day by day
No reason to be alive
Disillusion there is no escape from them
In this wrong place and time
