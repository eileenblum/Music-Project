When I look into people
They're looking into me
How hard I try
I cannot set free

I close down in myself
That's my protection
But day after day
Grows this bloody tension

Trying to get a way out
Trying just to be "sain"
I only see my room
To release all this pain... all this pain

Locked in my room
Out of this world
I face myself
Getting in control
Sorrow... breaks... and life will... it takes

So I feel this emotions so deep
Refuted from the outside world
And I close down in my room
Trying to get in control... control

And so I've the time
In my own life
Where things that come and go
Begin just passing me by... passing me by

Locked in my room
Out of this world
I face myself
Getting in control
Sorrow... breaks... and life will... it takes
