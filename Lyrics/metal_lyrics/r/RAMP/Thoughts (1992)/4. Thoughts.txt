Day after day this weird sensation
Come and make me think in a different way
It's like thinking without thinking
Just letting thoughts flow away

Old passions and mistakes
Future visions, thoughts that awake
Past and future in a fusion of time
All this confusion invading my mind

Trapped in my thoughts

Thoughts, thoughts, trapped in my thoughts
Trapped in my mind
Thoughts, thoughts, trapped in my thoughts
Where there's no time
Thoughts, thoughts, trapped in my thoughts
Trapped in my mind
Thoughts, thoughts, trapped in my thoughts
Where there's no time

Fears that I try to fight
Dreams that come to light
Seems like a self therapy
Keeping me away from lunacy

Thoughts, thoughts, trapped in my thoughts
Trapped in my mind
Thoughts, thoughts, trapped in my thoughts
Where there's no time
Thoughts, thoughts, trapped in my thoughts
Trapped in my mind
Thoughts, thoughts, trapped in my thoughts
Where there's no time... time

Misteries of the unconscious
Builders of a personality
Reflections of a life
What I hear and what I see
