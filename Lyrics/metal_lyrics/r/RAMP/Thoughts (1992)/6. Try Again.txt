When everyday life starts to get you down
And your problems seem to many
When your job is shit and the rent is sue
And you're down to your last penny
Where do you go? Who do you count on?
When there's no time left to hide
When your parents don't like it and they told you so

I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do

Now I'm not here to preach
Or tell you the way you got to live
Just stop and think about what you want
And what you want to give

God Dammit life is what we're here for
Not to watch fucking TV
But if that's where you think the answer is
Then bother get away from me
Engaged forced to "fight"

I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do

Now there's no easy answers
But here's my final advise to you
Take control of your life man
Work hard follow thru
And if a friend is travelling a rocky road
Then help him on this way
Tell him that he's got to try again
And try harder everyday

I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do
I look at you - And I know what to do

You got get up in the morning and try again
Not tomorrow, do it today
Young or old, it don't matter man
Don't let your life slip away
You got to take a chance, push yourself
Stand up for what you know it's right
Don't take no shit from anyone
Let'em know that you're ready to fight
Right soldiers for this "fight"
