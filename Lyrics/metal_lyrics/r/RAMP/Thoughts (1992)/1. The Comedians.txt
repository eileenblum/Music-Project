Bodies are fighting in the dark
For a long lost part
Playing a death game
They've got no fear for their veins

Gloomy faces are falling apart
They've lost their heart
They've losing trace
Of their tie of their space

These are the comedians
Playing the game of life
Got nothing to gain
Didn't start in time

All waiting for the train
Think it's in vain
But dreams are not so worth
So fall back to earth

Comedians were left at the station
A long time ago
Still don't believe in heaven
Like a thousand years before

You out there staring at me
Thinking I'm funny
But look at yourself
You may no be just someone else

These are the comedians
Playing the game of life
Got nothing to gain
They just pretend they're still alive

These are the comedians
Playing the game of life
Got nothing to gain
Didn't start in time

All waiting for the train
Think it's in vain
But dreams are not so worth
So fall back to earth... earth... earth... earth...
