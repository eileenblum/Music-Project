It's just a matter of attitude
What I'm going to talk about
You may not believe it
But you have the right to doubt

You think you are a made man
Who knows the mighty truth
Who reached what so many
Never reached in their youth

You spread garbage on the street
You break bottles on the ground
Thinking you already know
All that in life can be found

You think you are a made man
Who knows the mighty truth
Who reached what so many
Never reached in their youth

I'm not here to preach on you
Or tell you what things to do
I just try to make you understand
There's so many things to live for... "man"

In the beginning I am
Trying just to be a better man
In the beginning I am
See what you are and take a stand

Doesn's matter if you're young
Not even if you're old
You'll never but never know
All that's going in this world

In... the... beginning... I... am
From this you'll reach a better day
From a child to man you'll find the way
Seeing how much we can do
To live a life that's passing through you
You'll see to many times
Different truths in just one life

I'm not here to preach on you
Or tell you what things to do
I just try to make you understand
There's so many things to live for... "man"

In the beginning I am
Trying just to be a better man
In the beginning I am
See what you are and take a stand
