Remember when you look at the sky
Seeing the clouds passing by
The sun so bright in your eyes
What a beautiful sight
We see this misery

Green grass among the earth
Birds singing soft melodies
Memories of a happiness
That's no longer reality

Waiting till the day when nature wins
Remembering all of your sins
You are watching death unfold
You are the last child in this world

Facing now a new life
No shining but fury eyes
Hating all "the enemies"
Without knowing why

They put a gun in your hands
With orders to kill
You're a fighter in a war
That is setting your time to be killed

Waiting till the day when nature wins
Remembering all of your sins
You are watching death unfold
You are the last child in this world

Waiting till the day when nature wins
Remembering all of your sins
You are watching death unfold
You are the last child in this world
