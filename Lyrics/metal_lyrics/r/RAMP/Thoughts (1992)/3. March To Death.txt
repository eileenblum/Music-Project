Everyday I think those same fucking shits
Trying to find out why mankind exists
But everyday the answers are the same
Answers that for me nothing explain

Running from place to place
Always the same disguise
I fight for my life without a reason

Breathing polluted air
Eating garbage anywhere
I feed my march to death

Marching yo death

Locked in a life with no sense
Where all dreams belong to the past
My fate it's only one... March to death

Running from place to place
Always the same disguise
I fight for my life without a reason

Breathing polluted air
Eating garbage anywhere
I feed my march to death

Running from place to place
Always the same disguise
I fight for my life without a reason

Breathing polluted air
Eating garbage anywhere
I feed my march to death
