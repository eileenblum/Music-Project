Waiting for daylight, but darkness prevails
All that I've strived for, has ended and failed
Nothing remains of my once envied past,
A prestigious, pretentious, failure at last.

As my curtain starts to fall, my final journey hits the floor
My existence fades to black, there is no turning back
All the weakness we can't see, all the failure put on me
All the hate behind their eyes, I defy them for I will rise...

We'll never forgive and we'll never surrender
Raise your fists, and make your stand with me
We'll never forgive and we'll never surrender
Shackles break into my arms again

Waiting for daylight, but darkness prevails
The liars you died for, have ended and failed
The stench of deception could blind all our ties
But we will stand stronger and fuck all the lies

As my curtain starts to fall, my final journey hits the floor
My existence fades to black, there is no turning back
All the weakness we can't see, all the failure put on me
All the hate behind their eyes, I defy them for I will rise...

We'll never forgive and we'll never surrender
Raise your fists, and make your stand with me
We'll never forgive and we'll never surrender
Shackles break into my arms again
