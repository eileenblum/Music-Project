I've always found, that hatred was made from past failures
Burning inside my head, scorching my memories
Now you remember,
The ones you left behind
Now your wounded,
Like a thorn stuck in your side
The faces loom in to your deterrent grin
The lost children have found their way in... Now their home, again
As I stare at the faces that lie before me, don't burn out my eyes
Just who do you think you are?
When your life turns black, do you purify?

The bloodstained walls that bear your name
Scream as loud as the fists that broke them too
Paralysed at the feet of your family
The knife comes down as the blood soaks through and through

Tear out the heart and soul, of the patriarchal figure
His severed ties has crucified this perfect family picture

As I stare at the faces that lie before me, don't burn out my eyes
Just who do you think you are?
When your life turns black, do you purify?

Just look all around you...
Our fists are poised and clenched
And these words you will heard them,
I speak for the victims,
You are not alone...
Now sing, these words with me

As I stare at the faces that lie before me, don't burn out my eyes
Just who do you think you are?
When your life turns black, do you purify?
