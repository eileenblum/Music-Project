These false beliefs will fuel our denial,
The last debris will crumble in front of our eyes,
Just so we can see the truth behind the lies
Nobody said this was easy,
An unveiling of things that we don't want to hear,
Confiding in idols that preach their own bible,
Doubting the strength in our hearts

If you can stand up to the masses,
And preach and sell your gospel,
Then I'll take back all the scars,
Of which your the root and the cause

Pay the price unearthing,
The sacred hand that buries the truth,
Who believes in the land of the free?
I'll show them, their God can bleed

There is not one who'll save you now,
The new uprising has turned this table round,
The blood you spill on honest ground,
Contours the landscapes of our time

Stripped back to callous numbness,
That you have enforced tenfold,
Chasing rainbow and mirage,
Selling your miracle cure,
But what is more?
To carry my burdens,
Like my heroes before...

Pay the price unearthing,
The sacred hand that buries the truth,
Who believes in the land of the free?
I'll show them, their God can bleed

I am the one to bring you down,
Sent from the streets I was sown on,
We are the sons of everymen,
We will not break, we will not bend

Pay the price unearthing,
The sacred hand that buries the truth,
Who believes in the land of the free?
I'll show them, their God can bleed
