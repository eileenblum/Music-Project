Sucked in,
Engulfed by feelings I don't know,
Descending deep inside this darkening place,
Its bright lights will drag you down,
I'm drawn in to the city of vultures

Circling, preying,
They'll take you down alive,
Unless we save ourself this time,
Unless you save yourself...

We're falling down,
Tonight, tonight
From blinding lights,
That drew me in,
Tonight

I'm caught in this vicious betrayal,
Of what I knew as truth,
And this city full of liars and brutes,
Will make me stay and learn their way,
I vow to struggle,
I promise to put up a fight with fists in the air,
I have no more fear

We're falling down,
Tonight, tonight
From blinding lights,
That drew me in,
Tonight

We are the elite in this city of broken dreams,
We will not regret, relent, conform or bend,
For this is who we are, this is who I am...

We're falling down,
Tonight, tonight
From blinding lights,
That drew me in,
Tonight
