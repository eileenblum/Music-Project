I can't steer away from the tragedy before me,
Its burning luminescence holds my eye,
I can not understand it, you are so disenchanted
In your shadow of a life
I hold this one truth to myself: To never forget where I have come from
Your lies beguile us all, but theres still a chance to change,
You must forsake the facade, and realise just who you are

For what you've done, you've faded to blackness (blackness)
Your closing eyes, sink into darkness

You've turned your back on what you believe,
For the sake of walking through a dream,
Your startling contradictions,
All derive from your life's own fictions
Illusions give you all the pride,
That you need to deal with whats inside,
But you'll never wipe the tears from your eyes,
Because your living a selfish lie

I hold this one truth to myself:
To never forget where I have come from
Your lies beguile us all, but theres still a chance to change,
You must forsake the facade, and realise just who you are

For what you've done, you've faded to blackness (blackness)
Your closing eyes, sink into darkness (darkness)

We're so determined to blaze our own trail,
That we forget who we are and we cover ourselves in lies
But I will not, for I have sovereignty,
In the eyes of those who may judge me,
I will overcome

For what you've done, you've faded to blackness (blackness)
Your closing eyes, sink into darkness (darkness)
