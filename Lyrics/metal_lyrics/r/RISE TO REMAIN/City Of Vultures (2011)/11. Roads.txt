There are shades I have yet to define,
When all I seem to do is climb,
To better understand,
The life thats in my hands,
And what I seek to find in this world

On these darkened roads,
Where blood runs cold,
They clipped my wings and I'm going down

We let this world get the better of us,
Possessions state who we can and can not trust,
But did we ever stop to ask who we are?
Some live life by age old rules,
Sent forth from a king and kept alive by a fool,
But they'll never understand,
What it means to raise your hand
Its time to readdress your rights,
Its time to fight...

On these darkened roads,
Where blood runs cold,
They clipped my wings and I'm going down
For the life we have in our beating hearts,
Is all that we have left

Faces and memories,
Are the only real things,
And they are worth this struggle

Our lives are one single chance to make things right,
This time, no turning back I'm taking flight

On these darkened roads,
Where blood runs cold,
They clipped my wings and I'm going down
For the life we have in our beating hearts,
Is all that we have left
