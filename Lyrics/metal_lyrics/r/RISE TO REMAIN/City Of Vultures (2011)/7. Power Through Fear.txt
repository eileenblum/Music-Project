Divinity will rise and destroy
I am the wolf amongst the sheep
and I will erase all the things that you hold dear

No more heroes, no more Lies
No more saviours on which you can rely

I was created from self righteous tears
Not from devils not from demons
But from those from preach power through fear

For once in this life I scorched the skies
I am the remedy to humanity
I'm the dirge of those who died
I'm the devil turning glass into the sand
the shadow on the wall
i'm the subtlety of endless sleep
for this demon is a man

I am the great plague bearing down
I am the land clearing flood
I am the iron fist that pulverises kingdoms into dust
And now I will show you what it means to suffer
and what it means to die

For once in this life I scorched the skies
I am the remedy to humanity
I'm the dirge of those who died
I'm the devil turning glass into the sand
the shadow on the wall
I'm the subtlety of endless sleep
For this demon is a man

For once in this life I scorched the skies
I am the remedy to humanity
I'm the dirge of those who died
I'm the devil turning glass into the sand
I'm the shadow on the wall
I'm the subtlety of endless sleep
For this demon is a man
