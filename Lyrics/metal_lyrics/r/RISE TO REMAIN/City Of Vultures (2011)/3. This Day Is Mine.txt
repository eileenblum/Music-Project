Vicious authority from the mouth of hate,
Spewing forth all the lies that you can make,
Just one look in the mirror tells your tale,
When will your jealousy resolve?

So what gives you the right?
You'll see that this day is mine

Now the time has come,
I see you cover your eyes to shield yourself
You're better off in the dark after all...
What did you take me for?
A fool, or a liar?
I'll bet your shaking in your goddamn boots

So what gives you the right?
You'll see that this day is mine
You'll never understand
Its not some "divine hand"
That makes me the person that I am
So what the hell are you gonna do now?

So what gives you the right?
You'll see that this day is mine
This day is mine
This day is mine
This day is mine
