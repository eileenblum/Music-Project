In the arms of anonymity,
You have made your bed,
But was it worth it?
When you had to raise your voice

Because I don't want to waste my days,
Walking around these hopeless streets,
Watching silent nights,
Watching myself fade...

Now I know I'll figure this one out on my own,
Raise up my voice, and scream and shout
Well I won't stand for nothing,
Because I can't hear you talking,
I will live out loud

You once had a dream,
But the feeling of being made you weak,
And now you talk in your head,
Your lifeless body feels like the walking dead,
Living in fear of consequences,
Does not adhere to a life worth living,

And I don't want to see the day when the hearts of people turn the other way,
Reposed in silence,
With nothing to say...

Now I know I'll figure this one out on my own,
Raise up my voice, and scream and shout
Well I won't stand for nothing,
Because I can't hear you talking,
I will live out loud

Now I know I'll figure this one out on my own,
Raise up my voice, and scream and shout
Well I won't stand for nothing,
Because I can't hear you talking,
I will live out loud

Your talking in whispers
