The revolution comes alive
Now its time to take a side
Who are you?

With bombs falling from the mouths of the lord's in seat
When every day comes forth to claim the weak
I won't listen, I won't listen
When we're face down, revelling in mess we've made
When city walls transform into a cage
We aren't victims, we aren't victims

So hear us, and know its all
A promise, to overcome
They strive for control but they won't take our lives away

I've realised, that you are the only one who feels
Your changing life
Your situation does not dictate who you are,
Or who you become in this world

When all hope seems to far out of reach,
When all the fools want to judge and preach
Remember truly, who's still with you
Stand tall in your solidarity,
And as one there is immortality,
For you are defined, by the life you leave behind

So hear us, and know its all
A promise, to overcome
They strive for control but they won't take our lives away

We've opened up the sky,
We are the warriors,
With a halo of embers everlasting in our hearts,
We will fight on together,
We will last forever
