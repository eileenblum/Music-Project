It's killing season
Persuasion will determine the outcome.
The victim will have bloodied hands and a snake will make them so
Welcome to hell on earth
instigated by the lies created from the mouths of bretheren.

This time we've lost, but at what cost?
The meaning of trust is a broken Hymn

The serpent has spoken and his will has been done
Is this the end of the world?
betraying our brothers to see how far we can rule
Now the time is right
There's no turning back
No turning back

So set me free of this demon deep inside
the serpent utters every line that you will speak henceforth
Everything you know has been erased
replaced by traitorous endeavours
with sounds of twisting tales tightening your blindfold

This time we've lost, but at what cost?
For now my voice will cry for change

The serpent has spoken and he's in everyone
Is this the end of the world?
Betraying our brothers to see how far we can rule
Encased in walls of greed and control
With serpentine lies on your tongue

I've searched and tried
I'll break away these chains
I will not be consumed
I refuse

Is this the end of the world?
Betraying our brothers to see how far we can rule
