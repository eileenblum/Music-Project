Mouth sewn shut, abandoned to speak
With the dawn of a new day rising, we all will know...

Shall I not be heard? I will not
For they can't stand up, and bite the bullet
Their justice lies with pain, their justice is not belief
Killing, maiming, interrogating all who're true to their word

Behind life and death, lies the line we all must cross one day
For we are the same...
And as I dream, of something real, we all will weep, for we can not feel

Pray for something new, the bridges will burn, as we cast our divides...

Bring me to my knees, and laugh awhile
As you see the destruction you've caused
I will not be, brought down by mistakes in my past
Destroy, rebuild, enslave is not the only way
For you will decay...

Destroy other relations, with a pure race
Created by intolerant bigots
Who would destroy a world
For their own power

Behind life and death, lies the line we all must cross one day
For we are the same...
And as I dream, of something real, we all will weep, for we can not feel

The rivers are weeping, as the streets rain blood
As we now pass judgement, let the bridges burn...

Behind life and death, lies the line we all must cross one day
For we are the same...
And so we, in sickness, cry out our gaping maws, and so we, in sickness, reject our lives for dirt.
