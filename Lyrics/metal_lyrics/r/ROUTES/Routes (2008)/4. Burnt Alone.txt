What's the matter baby
Did you burn did you burn did you burn?
Do you want to drink with me again?
Come with me, burn with me, in the sun whose always drinking
Come with me and burn alone burn alone one more time
Baby no one's home

Burnt

Whatâs the matter honey
Are you afraid are you afraid are you affraid
Please donât be scared and burn with me again
Whatâs the matter now?
Do you wanna drink with me
Burn babe alone with me again, please
Burnt alone

Burnt [2x]
