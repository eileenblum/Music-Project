Oh

Do you know the meaning of your life?
Everything is lying but who never dies
Do you know you never walk alone?

No one wants to help you fly into your own
I say yeah
Uh come on and fly

No one can help you and listen to my voice
I wanna save you
[2x]

Yeah
Come on and fly

Yeah

Do you know the meaning of the sun?
Everything is flying, but you never run
Do you know you never walk alone?
No one wants to help you fly into your own

I say yeah
Come on and fly

And no one can help you and listen to my voice
I wanna save you
[2x]

Yeah
