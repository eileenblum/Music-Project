Iâm coming now for you just baby
Iâm coming now for love
Iâm coming now to take you baby

With a spaceship weâll go
We will meet your friends now baby
Theyâre called the alien

Strange body and strange nose baby
They live in out...
In outer space space

With a spaceship baby
We will meet friends
With a spaceship baby
With the alien

Strange body and nose
Strange color and ears
Just the alien, call me alien
[2x]

The alien
