Watch over your knees the space blue around
Take cover with me and Iâll take care of you
The space blue again, can you face it again
Watch over again

Into the space blue

Spooky

Watch over your feet the space blue again
Careful not to fall in it and take care of me
It is the space blue, is still the space blue

Into the space blue
Space blue around
