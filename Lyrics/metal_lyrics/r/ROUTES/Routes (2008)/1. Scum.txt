When I was born I had a dream...

Are ya ready for...

When I was born
I had a dream
That when I grow up
To be a scum like my dog

Now Iâm young, I have a guitar
Iâm drinking, Iâm rolling
Yanno I am scum

Now Iâm old
I have no hair
Iâm too old to play
But Iâm still I'm drinking I'm rollin

Now Iâm old
I have no hair
I'm drink I'm rollin
Yanno I am scum

Now I'm dead
I donât need your help
You can't leave me now
But please keep on drinking and rolling

Now I'm dead
And on your breath [?]
Yanno I am scum
