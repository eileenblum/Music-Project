Deep in the battle
I raise my voice
With my heart and my sword
Fist of metalâ¦

Painting my skin
With fight and to win
My voice is my force
Heart of metalâ¦
Into the darkness
Walking my way
With my force and my fate
Brain of metalâ¦

Crushing your grave
I spit in your breed
Forever I am
The solid metal rulesâ¦

In the land of violence
My creations, are walk in the night
The sounds of magic and darkness
Infiltrations, of rivers of might

Fields of blood and fire
Fulminations, screams in the night
This is the sound of perfection
My obsession, Solid Metal Rulesâ¦
