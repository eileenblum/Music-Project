Faith I never had fate
The darkness surrounds me always
The world be destroy, your home, my home
And every religious betrayers

I burn again' it's really again
I offer my soul to pagan gods
Deep darkness my home and hearten my soul
Almighty!!! My rituals of fire

Hey!!! I see you in the end
My forces are summoning to Gaia
My hate is the throne, the abyss my home
My sounds are litanies of power

I burn again' it's really again
I offer my soul to pagan gods
Deep darkness my home and hearten my soul
Almighty!!! My rituals of fire

Feel the essence of my hate
See my horns grow to you
Smell my putrid live of hell
Near to pagan throw
Near to pagan throw

Hey!!! I see you in the end
My forces are summoning to Gaia
My hate is the throne, the abyss my home
My sounds are litanies of power

I burn again' it's really again
I offer my soul to pagan gods
Deep darkness my home and hearten my soul
Almighty!!! My rituals of fire
