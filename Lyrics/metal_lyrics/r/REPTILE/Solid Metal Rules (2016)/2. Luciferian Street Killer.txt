Dark, he's the fog
This is his art
He's the hellion killer
Blood he need your blood
Ripping fast your soul
Blood he need your fucking blood
As he crush your heart
Ghoul of the ancient times, everyone says.

He's the terror of night
All things gets wrong, when the madness grow
He smells like death, with a gun made of bones
He smells like death, with a gun made of bones

Victims are crying, as he says, I'm your fear, my name is Hell
Victims are dying, their corps back to earth,
Never more fear and never more, PAIN!!!
Never more fear and never more, PAIN!!!

Walking on he's self, fascinated by the artist
Depression is his blade, violation is his hard fist
Crawling like a reptiles
Faster than withe lighting
Darkest than deep graves
Killer!!
