Wake up, Illusions of danger
Bad warrior you nameless
Stupid fucker
Mother fucker hellâ¦

Wake up, you look at the mirror now
And no one hear you call
You never be a warrior
Fuckin' never hellâ¦

Here, my revenge is here
Near, mother fucker near

Wake up, Illusions of brave heart
You never deserve it
Your life is a wrong turn
Mother fucker hellâ¦

Wake up, this life is not a dream
You can lose, you can win
But never surrender
Fuckin' never hellâ¦.
