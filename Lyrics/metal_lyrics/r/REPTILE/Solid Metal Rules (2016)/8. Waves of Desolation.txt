Walking around
And thinking in hatred
Smoking the weeds of power
Alone againâ¦

In burial waves of sadness
I hear mi ancients,
They said me sacred secrets
The world will fallâ¦

My memory remember
Old pagan rites of evil
The age of earth empire
With oldest godsâ¦

Your eyes your name, your parents
Will death, stop crying
Families, religions
There not surviveâ¦
There not surviveâ¦
