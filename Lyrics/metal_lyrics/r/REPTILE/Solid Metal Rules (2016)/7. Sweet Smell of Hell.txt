Welcome to wild kingdom
There is only freedom
Hell is only yours

Now you live in fire
In the extreme of magic
Greatness its wait for you

Feel the Moon lighting fell
Feel your soul your black wings
Let star, this magic ritual

Now you fear for nothing
Fear and pain are nothing
Breath, Sweet smell of hellâ¦
Breath, Sweet smell of hellâ¦

You can remember, those dark days we are walking on earth
You can remember those smell
To doom riders you offer you faith, you offer your pain
You can remember those daysâ¦
Those Darkness, hatredâ¦
Feel good times, we are walking on hell
Feel good times, we are walking on hell

Into the darkest void, fall to breath fall to see the down
Rise your soul, to hell flames
And you embrace by force, embrace by him embrace by the mighty
Voice is the prince of hell, here welcome youâ¦
