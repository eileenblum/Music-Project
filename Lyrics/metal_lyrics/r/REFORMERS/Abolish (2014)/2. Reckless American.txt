[feat. Jonny from Winds Of Plague]One day every idol will fade away
Get on your knees and pray
Reckless American

We whore ourselves away every single day
to graven images and idols that we create
We've worshiped a god who looks just like us
We've lost the meaning
of having one God and serving one King
They call us the land of the free
and the home of the brave,
but we've become the land of the chained
and the home of the slaves

God I'm in over my head again
I've given in to these hollow attractions
Hey you reckless American
Stop giving in

Idolizer!

We love images
Hollow attractions
False gods
It's all distracting
Filled with idolatry
We've lost the meaning
of having one God and serving one King
Stand unwavering

God I'm in over my head again
I've given in to these hollow attractions
Hey you reckless American
Stop giving in

One day every idol will fade away
Get on your knees and pray
that hell won't have it's way
One day every idol will fade away,
revealing Christ as the one true King

Hell won't have it's way

Our one nation under God
has become the land of the chained
Our one nation under God
has become the home of the slaves
Reckless American
