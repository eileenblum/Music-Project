We've built our lives on everything destructive
We've settled for a lie
We claim to be one nation under God
but we've taken Him out of everything
and we wonder why everything is falling apart

All we see is anger and envy and pride
Becoming the standard of our lives

With every breathe in my lungs
I will advocate change
The world wont be the same
With every step that I take
and every word that I speak
you will sense conviction

This is the reason for change
May the Lamb who was slain
receive the full reward of His suffering
Take this broken standard away
Take it away
Set the record straight
Set it straight

We are the one's
who will see injustice shut down
Shut it down
We are the one's
who will see the standard turned around
Turn it around

With every breathe in my lungs
I will advocate change
The world wont be the same
With every step that I take
and every word that I speak
you will sense conviction

Destiny
You see the brokenness in the world
and you think it's your destiny
Destiny
That's not the way life's suppose to be
Destiny

The standard remains
but we'll see it slowly fade
Love in place of hate
No injustice will remain
Righteousness will reign
One way worth living
Uncompromising
Loving the Truth

We are the one's
who will see injustice shut down
Shut it down
We are the one's
who will see the standard turned around
Turn it around
