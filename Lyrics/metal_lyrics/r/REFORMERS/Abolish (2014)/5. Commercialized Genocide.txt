I feel sick to the pit of my stomach
Everyone's blind and everyone's running
I'll stand up even if I stand alone
I will not let these things go unknown

We've been force-fed
what to think,
what we wear,
who we are and define
what life is meant to be
Our culture
The mind molders
Creating replicas
A new world order

We've learned to justify infant homicide
Mass genocide
Life's been reduced to a dollar sign
God change our twisted minds

So many people fight the system
Miss the symptom
All for the sake of human rights
We fight for the choice but not for the life

People are people
All politics aside
We all deserve life
Fight for life

You call it planned parenthood
I call it a money maker
Two billion a year
Then one thing should be clear
They're only after the dollar signs
Fight for life
Open your eyes
This is commercialized genocide
End this commercialized genocide

So many people fight the system
Miss the symptom
All for the sake of human rights
We fight for the choice but not for the life

People are people
All politics aside
We all deserve life
Fight for life

We've been force-fed
what to think,
what we wear,
who we are and define
what life is meant to be
Our culture
The mind molders
Creating replicas
A new world order

We've learned to justify infant homicide
Mass genocide
Life's been reduced to a dollar sign
God change our twisted minds
End this commercialized genocide
