[feat. Justin Singh of The Great Commission]Too young to know what to believe
To deep to turn my eyes
from all these worthless things
I bought into the lie
I spent time crossing lines
I committed the crime
I defiled my eyes

Truth be told it's all just a lie
It takes control
And blurs every line
It's all selfishness,
this filthy game we play
Am I the scum of the earth
for feeding this industry

It changes everything

I made a covenant with my eyes
I close this chapter of my life
I found a way out
I found a way out of this awful crime
That filth I found attractive
Kept in chains, I was a captive
Now I'm free
I'm free by Jesus Christ

Truth be told it's all just a lie
It takes control
and blurs every line
We sit behind a screen
and click click away
While that girl gets filmed to get her pay
We see these images and buy into the lie
That it's okay and we have some filthy twisted right

I made a covenant with my eyes
I close this chapter of my life
I found a way out
I found a way out of this awful crime
That filth I found attractive
Kept in chains, I was a captive
Now I'm free
I'm free by Jesus Christ

This evil empire will never stand a chance
So see Christ crucified
Believe and take a stand
There's no doubt in my mind
that this won't be a fight
But it's worth it
With clenched fists swing at the world tonight
Fight

Rip out the foundations
Break the legs of this giant
Watch it crumble and fall to it's knees
Take it down
Burn it down
Porn never pays
You won't even know who you are anymore
It changes everything
Porn never pays
