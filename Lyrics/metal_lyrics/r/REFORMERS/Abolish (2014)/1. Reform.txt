Reform
We won't conform

I speak the hearts of every person
who is bound, beaten and broken
This is your time
Freedom is now

This is the way to see a reformation
Allegiant to one King and to the calling
This is the time to see Christ as the only way
From the chief Cornerstone we shall not stray

All by grace
I'm able to stand before the throne of God
Grace
I'm covered by Your perfect blood
Grace gives me a reason to fight
Grace brought me from darkness
and into the light
This grace is enough to see
social injustice brought to an end
and every form of immorality broken
This grace is enough to see
the whole world changed forever
God raise up reformers
End this age

Reform
We won't conform
