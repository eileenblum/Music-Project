We pray for the chains of injustice to break
(Pray)
To see hope overcome the hopeless place
(Pray)
For those of you who have strayed away
(Pray)
For the lonely, lost and afraid

Forever broken
Forever in need
This is the reason
why we knock and ask and seek
Somewhere along the way
we've neglected to pray
Used God like a whore
then chose to throw Him away
We chose to throw Him away

This is a test to eliminate the sickness
This will separate the faithful from the faithless

I won't waste my words on everything that's selfish
On everything I want
I'm done with playing games with God
His favor can't be bought

Prayer's been confined to a positive fable
Thirty silent seconds to make us feel stable
We only pray when we're in need,
have bills to pay or mouths to feed

This is a test to eliminate the sickness
This will separate the faithful from the faithless

We are the new generation
Born to pray
and lay down everything
We are the new generation
Born to pray
and born to change everything
Born to pray

We pray for the chains of injustice to break
(Pray)
To see hope overcome the hopeless place
(Pray)
For those of you who have strayed away
(Pray)
For the lonely, lost and afraid
