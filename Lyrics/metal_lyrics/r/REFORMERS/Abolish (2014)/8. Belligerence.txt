Where's the peace in the lives we lead
There's no joy in a life marked by suffering
Why live a life fueled by hate
Break the cycle
Be the change

Passed down through the generations
Taught to feed the hate
like it's the only way
These are the lies
that remain right before our eyes
Negativity
This is your reality
All we see is hate
This is your reality
I know that we can change
Your negative reality
Break the cycle
Be the change

Somewhere along the line
we learned to live in hate and negativity
We're at the point
where we've learned from our mistakes
It's time to change our ways

Angry, abused, beat down and broken
Cast out and important to no one
These are the lies that we feed inside
Slaves to hate till the day we die

We are all to blame
We stay the same,
never learning from our mistakes

Somewhere along the line
we learned to live in hate and negativity
We're at the point
where we've learned from our mistakes
It's time to change our ways

Break, break, break
the negativity
Break, break, break
Break it
Your negative reality

Passed down through the generations
Taught to feed the hate
like it's the only way
These are the lies
that remain right before our eyes
Negativity this is your reality
