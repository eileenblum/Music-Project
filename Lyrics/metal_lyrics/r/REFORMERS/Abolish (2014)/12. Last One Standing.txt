[feat. Brooke Reeves of Impending Doom]Standing strong

I wanna be the last one standing
Known for integrity
Faithful longevity
I wanna be the last one standing
Never giving up
Quitting so easily
I wanna be the last one standing

I've been taught to stand up for what I believe
even if it means nothing
As if we're taking the time
but we're running blind
What's the point of standing strong
if quicksand is what you stand on

I've been strong and I've been weak
And I've stood up to fight
I've been brought to my knees
We will never give up,
never lose control
Walk down the road less traveled

Standing strong
All this talk of standing strong makes me sick
when I realize we stand for nothing

When life's built on a strong foundation
giving up is never an option
When you feel weak and broken
giving up is never an option

I've been strong and I've been weak
And I've stood up to fight
I've been brought to my knees
We will never give up,
never lose control
Walk down the road less traveled
