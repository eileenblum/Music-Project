I'm at the end of my rope
I was scared of change
That the end result was suffering
I failed myself too many times
One false move might set it off

I felt conviction
A past repeated
I was afflicted
I've been here before
My resolve is in shambles

I said I'd never let it get this far again
I'm going to change
My word as my witness
One more hit
It's fine
I will be done tonight
The bowl is cashed
I'll give this a chance

Time and time and time and time again
I felt this sickness
Over and over again I said I'd beat it
Time and time and time and time again
I was broken
Over and over again God pulled me through

He watched over me through my insanity
I don't deserve grace like this
He had mercy on such a sinner like me

I thought this life was mine
This life has bled me dry
I'm so tired and alone
Will I find rest for my soul
Addiction has stole my soul
Will I ever be whole

Time and time and time and time again
I felt this sickness
Over and over again I said I'd beat it
Time and time and time and time again
I was broken
Over and over again God pulled me through

He watched over me through my insanity
I don't deserve grace like this
He had mercy on such a sinner like me

I'm at the end of my rope
Through His blood that was spilled I am free
Free from guilt
Free from shame and things that bind me
Emanuel, Son of Man
You know exactly who I am
Jesus, Messiah, Lord of all
Only You can make me whole
