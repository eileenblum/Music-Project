Truth is truth
Let it convict you
I'm not the one placing the blame
Truth is truth
Let it convict you
There's no reason to stay the same
Truth is truth

We've been fed American filth
that has it's roots buried in hell
From Christian roots to American devils
Seduced on every level
We've become the rebels

Tolerance is hate
so go against the grain
Too many souls are on the line
And if you speak your mind
Truth for humankind
It's called judgement
They'll say it loud,
"You're such a bigot!"
With 2x4's ruining sight
How will we know what's wrong
from what is right

We've been lost and confused
Twisted the truth
We've been conflicted, yeah
We've been concerned with pleasing everyone,
but I'm done with running
from confronting sin in love

Every sin is counted the same
This is a call to turn from our ways
Repent and turn from our ways

Hell is on the loose
You don't get to pick and choose
what's right for you
Truth is truth
I'll say it again
Truth is truth
Infidelity
Twisted sexuality has become our reality
Put Christ on the cross
There must be a cost
What's your response

I'm done pleasing everyone
(What's your response)
We've been lost and confused
Twisted the truth
We've been conflicted, yeah
We've been concerned with pleasing everyone,
but I'm done with running
from confronting sin in love

Truth is truth
Let it convict you
I'm not the one placing the blame
No time for tolerance or weak acceptance
Let's call sin what it is
Abomination

We've been concerned with pleasing everyone
I'm done with running from confronting sin in love
We've learned to tolerate every sin
we know to hate
