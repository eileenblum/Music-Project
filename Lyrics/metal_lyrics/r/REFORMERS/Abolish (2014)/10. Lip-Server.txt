One reason
No double standards
One way to stand for truth
Unchanging
No double standards
One way to stand for truth

Too many people rely on uninvested hope
Represent a God they don't even know
Mean what you say and say what you mean
Faith is the evidence of things unseen

I know that I am just one man
I know I've been the hypocrite
but now I'm seeing clear
what most seem to fear
Unchanging and steadfast

Another promise is just a broken word
When will we ever change
When will we ever learn
To say one thing
and do the other
gives Him a bad name
Makes me a coward

God come open our eyes
To be unstoppable make us immovable

I know that I am just one man
I know I've been the hypocrite
but now I'm seeing clear
what most seem to fear
Unchanging and steadfast

One reason
No double standards
One way to stand for truth
Unchanging
No double standards
One way to stand for truth

Lip-server
You rely on uninvested hope
Lip-server
Represent a God you don't even know
Lip-server
Where is your integrity
Lip-server,
end this hypocrisy
