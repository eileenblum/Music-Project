There's a false sense of security brewing
in every man and woman alike
That says money is power
and greed is just another means to survive
(Greed Machine)

Deliver me from the American dream
that fuels the ego and feeds the disease
Deliver me from the American dream
Set me from idolatry

It's now or never
It's do or die
Why store up treasures in this life

We've been conditioned to believe
that all the fortune and fame
is what we want and life's a game
A game that's won by cheating and lying
The cycle repeats

Deliver me from the American dream
that never satisfies and keeps me wanting
Deliver me from the American dream
Life is more than money, power and greed

What would it profit a man
to gain the whole world
but lose his soul

We've been conditioned to believe
that all the fortune and fame
is what we want and life's a game
A game that's won by cheating and lying
The cycle repeats

Get rich
You'll die trying
You can't bring your money to the grave
Get rich
You'll die trying
Riches won't keep you safe
Get rich
You'll die trying
You can't bring money to the grave
Greed machine
