Universe will expand itself forever, expand itself forever
As these fairy field's keep holding our existence
Blinded by the shadow of doubt
Since our maker trusted his origin strain to mankind

They still deny his life purpose
Like a stereotyped measure of all things
You are nothing but a slight grain of sand
FOREVER!
You're nothing but a slight grain of sand
You're nothing but a slight grain of sand
Through the vast cosmic lands of creation
Alpha and Omega a dethroned reality
Reality

A dethroned reality
Assimilate the final destination in endless past-times
A dethroned reality
Assimilate the final destination in endless past-times
Open your mind to the internal human core
And reach the infinite forms given by the endless visions beyond our sight
Drawing the planes of the universal designs
Let the strength fulfill you
Drawing the planes of the universal designs
Disembowel earth's shell and taste the elixir of invention
Let the strength fulfill you
Alpha and omega a dethroned reality
Alpha and Omega

Seeds and custodiers of light
Crawling beneath their feets
Assimilate the final destination
Self-isolated by a false conception of an illusion in your hands
