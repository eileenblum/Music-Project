That's here, that's home
The aggregate of our joy and suffering
On a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam
The delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe
Are challenged in the great enveloping cosmic dark
In all this vastness, there's no hint that help will come from elsewhere
To save us from ourselvesâ¦
