Before fight
Gravity is back enhancing the instability of the senses
The wind is crashing out the bones, knowing
Knowing that all this is dharma!
Dharma's infinitely contoured
The body is trembling over a wild horse, and the arrows are bordered
Without, without any desire of blood
A war zone made by swords in a lost culture
False gurus that are breaking everything apart, everything apart
Vanished by those with a Blind King who killed the father of Yadus
Still, still blocked by fear
Blocked, blocked by fear
Vanished by those with a Blind King
A war zone made by swords in a lost culture
This field of glory beholds our souls living this world
This field of glory beholds our souls living this world
OH BHAKTIVEDANTA!
Now I'm confused by my duty, and I've lost all the composure because of a fucking petty weakness
I ask you to tell me clearly what value is better for me
Now wake up your conscious with this song and prepare yourself
ATOMS STOP DANCING
And their beautiful mouth starts with Yoge saying your specific duty as a KSHATRIYA
You must know that you don't have any better occupation
Than fight with the light of knowledge
So you don't have to crumble
Fight with the light of knowledge
Fight with the light of knowledge
So you don't have to tremble.
