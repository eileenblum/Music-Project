Internal impulses directing every thought through a single reflection
Directing all thought through a single reflection
Staring at time burning on its dimension (its dimensions)
Staring at time burning on its dimension
A complexity interacting in our brains
Which no one has interrupted by thousands of years
An intense pulse changing the blood into milk
Changing the blood into milk
Shivers make directions shake
Shivers make directions shake

In this constellation
Stars are the thoughts balancing with your air-drop
Raising you up
In this constellation
Stars are your thoughts balancing with your air-drop
Raising you up
No one has interrupted by thousands of years
No one has interrupted by thousands of years
Exhale the creation coming from interloping dimensions
Inhale the purpose of those who are there, outside the sphere of nature
KURUKSHETRA is the field of activities
Currently disturbed by false egos
Identity is now lost
Transcendental vibrations pointing five-dimension spots
Five-Dimensional Spots

Skilled men realize
How intelligence scape and the ego stay
Shattering memories while they understood, while they understood
The electrical sense appearing one more time
Intelligence now stay and the ego scapes
Through their air drop
Inhale
Exhale
Inhale
Exhale
Raising you up
Raising you up
Raising you up

Realizing different natures as human vectors
Floating around an infinite session
All surrounded by ourselves
And the cosmic one
KSIRODAKASAYI

With a single fragment of himself he pervade and support
This entire universe
