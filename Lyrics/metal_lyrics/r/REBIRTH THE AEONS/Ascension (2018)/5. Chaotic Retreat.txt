Modern human consider himself the smartest being
Defiled with empty dissemination
For is sub-human inquires, an engagement
Caused by political chaos, political chaos
Within a deeper perspective into those changes that must come from the inside
Within a deeper perspective into those changes that must come from the inside
The questions made before a speculate mind
Empty by ego, shallow on dust
Speaking fearless before eyes opened
Transforming the vision of and idle man, into compassion for his straitened islands
Understanding (standing), reflecting (reflect)
Eventually we all considered, there may be a way to learn
Through light
Uncontrolled might, connected to an insatiable stomach
The ease seems wrought in ignorance developing
Why are the JIVAS unable to grant that?
How big creation is
Essence of time achieving its dynamic into a universal path
Realization should be in our bodies and minds
Within a deeper perspective into those changes that must come from the inside
Within a deeper perspective into those changes that must come from the inside of his own mind
Transforming the vision of and idle man, into compassion for his straitened islands Straitened islands
Understanding, reflecting
Eventually we all considered, there may be a way to learn in all of this
Self-defined geniuses in the dark, diminishing the light that came with us (in all of you) Self-defined geniuses in the dark, diminishing the light that came with us
