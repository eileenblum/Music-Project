The age of the divine has reborn from the ashes of an old world
To gaze us with his incandescent discharge
Erase everything you've learned
Because the infinite motion has begun
For all of us

Discover the awareness, reconstruct the internal core
Don't try to scape, don't try to scape this calling
Revitalize the everlasting disregard
And be torn apart upon this material existence
Don't try to scape this calling

We will make your balance return
Just choose not fall and set aside your apprehensions
Set aside your apprehensions

Recover lively energy, submerge in harmony
Hold onto your last breath, exhale
Hold onto your last breath, exhale
Exhale
Breath
Exhale
Our inner light will give you the abilities
To don't make ever again the same mistakes
Don't make ever again the same mistakes
Don't make ever again the same mistakes
Recover lively energy, submerge in harmony


Remember what we've said in all your dreams, we'll fight
We'll fight for what is yours
We'll fight for what is fucking yours
Fight
You were the chances, you were the ones meant to be
Connection is the consequence of the comprehension unity
The unique tool to make you stay in your frequency

The age of the divine is now alive
To gaze us with his incandescent discharge
An irreversible process to raise new forms of life
