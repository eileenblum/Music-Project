The reckless oaths of youth
Our futures, shrouded with ghosts
Each division, with precision, tears me up.

Are you receiving transmissions? Do you copy?
Whatâs your position? Is anyone out there?

A stranger in my own home, re-ignited fear
Open my eyes &amp; disappear.

With colourful flaws
That echo through eternity
Our division
My superstitions
Haunt me.

Does it crush you? (I feel it crush me)
Iâm at fault, does it linger?
(A constant looming) re-offender.

I canât pass on blame when itâs there to share
A fading image of who we were.

My recollections come and go
On repeat, constant cycles
These divisions, my inhibitions come and go
Finding things I thought Iâd lost
Losing things Iâd never had
These divisions, their incisions, cut me up.

Sometimes we lose our way
But I can hold dear those memories.
