Oh I, I believe in motions, of findings, that are far from
Transparent. Itâs remarkable what becomes uncovered.

When instinct does not mislead
There is no pleasure in unveiling truth
When the answers are so bleak you must be lifeless
To seal all speech.

Leaving warmth unspoken, threatening already broken bonds
Your palm was always open (understand you stand alone)
Your palm was always open.

Eyes pried wide to resilience (the bleeding off of energy)
Build it up and reconstruct
(This backbone has been reformed)
Thereâs intensity in this influence.

Eclipse what should have been
Miles and boarders and the unfamiliar
(Soaring past the moment of breaking)
Evolution in these strange surroundings
I find it inspiring.

But you covered tracks to protect
All that separated you from your wishes.
