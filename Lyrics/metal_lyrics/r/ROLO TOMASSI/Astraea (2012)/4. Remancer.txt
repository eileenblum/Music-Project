A hard lesson to understand I educate and learn nothing
Teaching how to make the most of a wreck
Indulge in emotions, swallow them whole, and immerse
Yourself in these consequences.

Uncover neglect with a halfhearted attempt and now
Youâre representing everything that we stood against.

An easy lesson so Iâm told, to pass through the underhand
This knowledge will ensure to isolate
Feet tripping over tales, mixing myths with minor truths
And occupying mouths.

Whatâs left of endearment? Hollowed out devotion
Fuelling advances, elevated memories.

Revising my statement, revisiting my soul
I rebelled against perfection and watched it devour all.

Seeking out perspective, unearthing everything
I disagree without regret, forever learning to settle for less.
