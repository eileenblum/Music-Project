Temeramental, faltering foundations
I feel it slide, collapsing from the inside.

Uneasily Iâll find my feet, Iâll remain capable
Reinforced for now, but itâs still perishing.

My discomfort directs me, vexed by irrational scrutiny
Assuring plagues of despair, articulated fears.

Inflicting such pitiful catastrophes
Sabotage my subconscious, sparing me

Drained and dragged, confined in my mind
Unravelling twisted reasoning
Shining forth, drawn to this glow
Unfortunate for the tormenting.

Far behind Iâll see, this falling short of everything
Far behind Iâll see, there is cause for release
Far behind Iâll see, the lack of ability to collide
Far behind there will be no remorse this time.
