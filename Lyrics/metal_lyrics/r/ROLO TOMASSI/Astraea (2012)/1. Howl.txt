A fresh impact onto the unknown
As promising as beginnings go
Disrupt momentum, it helps us move on.

Undeniably in doubt, confronting this argument
The past is limited with silence
Enlighten and repent.

Holding fragile moments dear but not one is sacred to you.

Mistaken immortality for failures
Debilitated and taken down.

Blinded by intelligence at a lifetimesâ expense
All that is evident misted with ignorance.

Disregard induced this decline, exhausted, scorned
Worn and resigned.

Whatâs impractical? Whatâs impossible?
To lead it on for so long
Withdraw to where weâve been before
To go so far and no further.
