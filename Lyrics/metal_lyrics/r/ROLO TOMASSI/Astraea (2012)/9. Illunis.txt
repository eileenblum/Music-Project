The sheer disrespect of this, to disregard and feign bliss
I listened to the movement now Iâm stunned to silence.

Claim to love it, unconditionally
But boast with resent with charmless ease.

What seems to get overlooked is this is not compulsory
This isnât who we are lost in the lines inbetween.

Your bitterness in this business, a hate supreme and merciless
Pierce with distaste to watch it bleed
Romanticizing misery, this league is bred to criticise
And now we watch it multiply, fail to resist intrigue in
Interest, detonate the illusion of affluence.

This sunrise brings entitlement and we fight to earn it
All is not lost for this lost art
Though itâs forged with lukewarm sentiment
When all else is laid to rest.

How dare I dare to demonstrate?
What was beloved is now waste.

Grieving the death of easier days
Against dominating waves
Laboured breath forcing it to wake
Call control on what you did not create
Reduce this weight before we sink
Revive and reverse, resist and return.

Conquering my despair
The true prevalence
Of passion.
