Obey the trap
Alternatives expect affliction
Actions hold no meaning
Hold on motive
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on .

Concentrate on consciences trace circles
And words break whats not already broken
Tessellating to the pattern with the other puzzled pieces
Don't you delve into something unknown
Everybody wants
A hand to hold,
I am holding out my hand,
We are holding out out hands,
(Holding out hands) holding in everything else
Encore, encore what for?

Everybody wants a hand to hold,
I am holding out my hand,
We are holding out out hands,
(Holding out hands) holding in everything else
