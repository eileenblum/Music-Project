An ideal existence, discovering a book perfectly written
Minds go: this cycle must continue
Legs are chained to the pedals

Elastic has to give at some point
Expand, contract, decrease contact
When the smallest things trigger grave danger, grave digger

This presets a lie
Will insides decide to grow up and not give in?
