Enter: fragments, cast offs, one offs
Exposed from your everyday life

Intelligence arose from every striking pose
And oh, I know they like the fragility of handmade
There's a sense of decay as they control
Some burn, some melt

Until significance, a cruel awakening as irrelevant as honesty

Wake up, realise, disappear
