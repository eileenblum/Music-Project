When do you think the search is over?

Confusion kissed me on the cheek, and left a taste so bittersweet
Unsure where I've been, the distance, it blisters
Locked up with the villain

(Time is worthless, time is worthless) When... hearts
(Time is worthless, time is worthless) When... hands

Mindless wanders searching for answers
Riddled with guilt for sins not yet committed

(Time is worthless) When hearts are magnets
(Time is worthless) When hands are magnets
(Time is worthless) When hearts are magnets
(Time is worthless) When hands are magnets
(Time is worthless) When hearts are magnets
(Time is worthless) When hands are magnets
(Time is worthless) When hearts are...
(Time is worthless) When hands are...
