Timidly approach the wolf,
Wondering about the necessities and the variables
For this procedure,
There lies mischief in his eyes,
Tomorrow or compromise,
Sketched out relentless frames of mind,
Untouched by consideration but floored by the drawback,
Cement is cracking around what was once secure.

Make the difference through distance
Fall and never hit the ground
Tormented in a full house
I'll try not to make this hard
You'll try not to make this heard

Elaborate the escape,
Feathers spat on the floor
