Glorious facade, slick tongue persistence
Syllable after syllable
Enchanting the artless
They're fish on hooks
Reel them in, cast them out

I see the flicker and burn
The breath inhaling the fumes
This temporary flame dances to a different tune
I see the flicker and burn
The breath inhaling the fumes
This temporary flame dances to a different tune

When you come to point your finger, you'll find three are pointing back
Can you taste the end?
