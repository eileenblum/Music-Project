Scouring history and scratching all the years away,
My discipline is failing.
Unfortunately uninvited memories, invade ecstasy.

This disease should be kept locked away,
Iâve heard nothing good or pure,
Mesmerized by acts of torture.

Iâm condemning it to withdraw, long live loss.
Inadequate as a face of this
Dishonest against the faithfulness of others,
Iâve felt uneasier than this.

Hearing scandal of a guilty party with graceless stories, youâre the gospel of a gentle truth.
Associate and circulate with a company of hideousness, thereâs no authority to match.
Make your first move as itâs not my place to show, my only advice is be delicate to disguise your need to do so.
