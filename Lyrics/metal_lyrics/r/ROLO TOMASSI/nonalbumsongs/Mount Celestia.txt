Persistently hesistant, anxious and quick to mark
To not know this could exist, an existence without conflict
Now what has been created, what I have always wanted.

No approval needed as unsure as Iâve ever been
Certainty is guidance as pure as you could ever know
Defying all judgement I see you with me.

Chasing a longing, an aspiration for affection
Miraculously moving out of where others have come to fail
I never expected to land on my feet from where I fell.

A quick grasp on cascading matter, no approval needed
Itâs hard to find expression, but right here is where I want to be
Unexpected beauty intertwining with reality, I see you with me.

For you to know I care, we donât need to make them see.

This is it right here, and I see you with me.
