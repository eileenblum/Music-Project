i want to fill your pores
because i've sussed what they seep
tired of tales
something to find to hide behind
hide between the lines
zipped lips and bitten tongues
scrawled vowels bitterly twisted
non verbal sounds

secrecy slurs your speeches
loyalties lie between these lines
keep your eyes peeled for what's real
it's obsessive it's compulsive
