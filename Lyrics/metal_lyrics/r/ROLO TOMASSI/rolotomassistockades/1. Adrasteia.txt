It swells and aches and I feel it pulse
Cryptic ways laced with vexation
Strands and stitching comes undone
Weigh it up and wear it thin

I don't believe in luck
I don't believe we're fortunate

I don't believe in luck
I don't believe we're fortunate

Trembling before our universe
This is how we structure the world

Consumed by curiosity
Every light burns out around me

Moderate this insecurity,
As acts are shivering
Clutch tightly the consequence of hope
With fleeting fury

I know obsession
Hail fierce revenge
Endorse unsteadiness,
I'll fill these voids with cursed resent
I placed the stars, isolated in suspense

Strong and strong willed
A vengeful fate
Shake off this haze,
The severity of self-punishment
I'll fill these voids with cursed resent
Embrace this plaguing dread

I know obsession
Wax, wane and waver
To fear these elements,
The severity of self-punishment
I placed the stars, isolated in suspense
Embrace this plaguing
Dread

I know obsession
Hail fierce revenge
Endorse unsteadiness,
I'll fill these voids with cursed resent
I placed the stars, isolated in suspense

Embrace this plaguing dread
Embrace this plaguing
Dread

Strong and strong willed
A vengeful fate
Shake off this haze,
The severity of self-punishment
Embrace this plaguing dread

Feelings that should be rectified
But I can see no reason
Why
