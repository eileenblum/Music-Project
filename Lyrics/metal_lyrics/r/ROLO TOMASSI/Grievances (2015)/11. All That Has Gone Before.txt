At the end
See this will close with clarity
Leave nothing unturned searching for perfection
Let it commence

The hold this has on me, strengthened by the permanence of scars
We can't be loved as we are
Deafened by discontent, I am nowhere

The hold this has on me
How it orbits the fallen in this uneasy calm
We can't be loved as we are
The dull numbness of demise, I let it die

To search for the other half in this uneasy calm
With the rise and set, shattered sharp misery
In the sweetness of these secrets
There's structure to this ruin

To flee from the other half in this uneasy calm
Hidden in the permanence of scars
Disconnected and undone
Devastated by these ruins, I am nowhere

We can't be loved as we are
With the rise and set, I am nowhere

I am nowhere, there is no glory in the air
We can't be loved as we are
With the rise and set, I am nowhere
(Hidden in the permanence of scars)
We can't be loved as we are
With the rise and set, I am nowhere
(The dull numbness of demise, I let it die)
