There is no good
Shake your head at me and Iâll shake mine right back at you
Disappointment isnât a desire of mine
Plagued with fragmented thoughts of why?
Too shameful to describe
With weary assurances I sit by
And await no reply
There is no good
(Digesting the oldest fucking trick)
Catch me if you can
Dipping in and out of disgust
(Smirk at the disadvantage, I know I did)
Try to keep up

Now let us convince
Thereâs no desire
There is no desire
Now let us convince
Where is your desire?
There is no good
There is no goodbye
