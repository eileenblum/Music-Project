Quick to draw, not like before
With these new habits, in old haunts
And no lines are left because theyâve all been said before

Arrive to deceive, captured in reverie
Are you taken aback? Because Iâve heard some vicious rumours and some shameful facts
And with no dismay, warned not to outstay your welcome.

Out of luck when youâre weighed up
Take responsibility for what you mean then what you say

Itâs a pain that feeds on an intolerance of this
The unfair nature of some,
Fighting a losing battle but I wonât go without an explosion
