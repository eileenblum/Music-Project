Iâm bringing it down now.
Ripping it down from corner to corner
Tearing the flesh then running for shelter
Nothing has mattered as much as this
Losing it now, dazed and addicted

Lashing out for, something real
Hanging by a thread, pulling myself up again.

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Iâm a liability if there ever was one
Well the devil likes them young

I always knew it was going to be like this
Dragging myself back
Sit back, relax, this is my mask
Iâm the queen of all you see you can never win with me
Figure it out, deal with it because I am feeling cruel
