A romance to bleach the soul
A restlessness beyond my control
We love to rot and rot for love
And history repeats and haunts us
Is it enough? It this what you were thinking of?

Sometimes itâs threadbare but you know Iâm still here
Same mistakes forever but you know Iâm still here
With memories best left to neglect

Trying to banish these thoughts instead of them following me, broken into some already structured symphony

Iâm lost but you know where Iâll be found

Tell me what this means to me.
Speak freely from your heart.
Art for hearts sake
