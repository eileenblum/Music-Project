Smashed glass proceedings
Wide open party wounds
Tasteless movers and shakers and candlestick makers
I've watched from afar and I've led the processions of faint heart believers and sons of the night

What did you want to learn?
A scale of notes that could drown out the world
Or put off what's been on your mind?
Forever never seemed so long at the time

Our sense of adventure only ever outweighed by these perfectly scripted desires
Such horror, mischief and desperate decadence, tall tales from the lips of liars
But when that beat drops, beat drops, beat drops, beat drops
Well I'm back to where I was before
I've been low, low, as low as I can go
But when I feel it, I'll still hit the floor

Pull up the flowers

Oh my stars
With scars, scabs and everything in between
How can this be?
Jaded but serene
