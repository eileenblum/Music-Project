I had a dream of pain
pain coming out of my heart.
Couldn't breathe and lost your world.
diving in the dark, floating through the picture of the time frame.
Awaking in the yell of war scenes, changing into a prey
like all around me.
My horse's hurt, dying in my hands.
I don't keep my anger, without spite I cut human lives by the sword.
Cry and weeping all around.

Streams of blood, replaced with a stream of tears,
Thanks to God I am the winner
I praise Lord for his heart.
In my mind is love light of my life.

WHY???

Raped and murdered, is it the reward for my faith?
Death is just a mirror, time is just a river.
I don't want to live in a world without light!

Lost and sold out turning to the God.
His face of stone recoils from mine.
Death is more merciful,
let the fire finish my agony!!!

Let the smoke take me away
into the eternal distance.
Just want to light on his white chest,
hear his heart like a bell calling me.
