At evens used to hear the tempting Angel's song,
over spans of human bones dinging in the sky.
Boundless desire trying to vault through the time'
tween death and stable humanness.
From elds handing over the collusion with heaven,
for bow to death they want to touch the stars.
Just touch for a moment to feel like gods,
control awhile the flow of human streams.

Choirs of birds will hush, when envoys of death come down,
to a war that humans can never win,
caused by foolishness and disrespect to the star rulers.
Inert bodies will grace a hides of fields,
like blooms of death looking up the sun.
And hundreds of grooms start their grass on the dead,
trim their brothers as a tax to their gods.
aneled head sits on the throne of anguish.

Crowds of rats lie underfoot.
Ruler's char offers a kid and may rats drink its blood.
Calix of wordly blood born from mouth to mouth.
With desire stronger than sense.
Imbibed with the blood gone you feel,
It's the blood been drunk in the dry clay.
Unaware you're part of it,
You won't awake and no way back.

At evens used to hear the tempting Angel's song,
over spans of human bones dinging in the sky.
