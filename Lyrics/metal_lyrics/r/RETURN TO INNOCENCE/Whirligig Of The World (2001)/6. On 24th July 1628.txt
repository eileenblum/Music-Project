Hands are shaking down and bloody torture
Has tears in its eyes and its pain

My dear daughter, don't know why just me
Shall be a servant, a servant of Satan

Who didn't plead a guilt will be tortured
Why are you dying my brother-in-low
You are dead and your family is suffering
You have never seen her

My eyes don't serve me, my ears are deaf
They long for salvation, the salvation of soul
I'm leaving my daughter, I'm dying
I'm sorry, I know what I did, I know that I'm innocent

The tree ear from flash is shining on my journey
No I'm not a wizard in spite of protest
He killed my wife for little of ashes
You must go my daughter, even if you didn't want

The seventeenth century is written in history
A major is murdered in spite of doubts
However they haven't any doubt about his daughter
Though she disappear forever and she survived centuries
