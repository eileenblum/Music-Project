The sky line is red
The gods guard the time
Nothing but wait
To full your breath
Why can not hear
Your cry all the time
My lungs getting full of blood
Flowing out of your mouth

At the last sunset
My empty heart was extinct
Oh, darling, don't hesitate
And take it in your palms
And eat it all

Thats the only way I can keep myself alive
Come to this place every
Evening and pray
As thats the only way I can live again

We stay shelled in an infertile egg
Every dark slumber fills up our solitude
A plastic operation will serve as
A medicine for our grief

I still am empty and helpless missing you
Drove me to the edge of abyss
It will be enough to stop the clock
and we will be again together
You and me

Time came to a stand still, I'm falling
At light speed, I cant hear anything
But the clock tick

The shade of mine stays far away, far behind me
The wind has torn off the skin of my face
It's strange find myself beautiful just now

It's the first of May
The time for love
So lets go and make the fires
And then we will be
Dancing on our graves
Let everyone see that we
Cannot live without each other
