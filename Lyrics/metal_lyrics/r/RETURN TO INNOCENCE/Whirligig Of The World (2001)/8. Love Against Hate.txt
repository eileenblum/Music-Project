Lots of lies and hate
Beauty wearing cruelty inside
Fashion and terror don't believe her
It's only a wasty dirt and lie

If you want to find the right love
So you never find it
You can only find it in
Yourself or in god

Imagine, when you should love everybody
So you will die for grief
And when you should hate everybody
So you will stay strong

Here in this world it's better to hate
Than to love, 'cause it's easier

If the love wins so it will be
Immortality and if the hate, continues the death
Love against hate
