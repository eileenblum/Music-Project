Gloomy clouds, gloomy cold
White crow, black peacock
The moon is shining, black castle
The winged snake is cereding - from the sea

Dreams have already been broken down and the night
Is dying, hate, evil, horrible might, I don't want to sleep
- well it's a day now

Cold is reflecting from faces
Eyes your face are pale
Angels and world permanent
Theres no place for the escape

Dreams have been already broken down and the night
Is dying, the hate cutting through my dream
No, don't want to sleep, I haven't got no power to
Kill or live, I don't know how - to go on

The pain persecuting the shadow, don't know how
From the darkness and what to do with this
The black north wind is blowing and I can only hope
- in the end

the girl's scream is cutting
through the darkness
ticking of clock
is resounding brightly

some unknown might pushing me back and
I don't want a pain, a poison and a remedy
