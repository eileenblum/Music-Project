Been there,
Been where?
I've been where you stand today
The fear,
The tears
I've wiped away and raised my head
I share your grief
Your loss is less than You might think
Scream, then rest
Your eyes need shut to shine again

A scorched world crumbling down
The dove of peace opens her wings
A ray of white thru the rising ash
Blinding in the wall of black

In crimson evenings
The sound of waves against the shore
Brings me back to a time I chose to forget,
close eyes and slip into the evermore
Opress yourself and you will see
that Opression feeds Depressions seed
The times in Life when You're alone
Make shure to remind Yourself to let You 

Shine My love
Let the springs of ashes bloom
From dirt shall rise the coming tide
If You allow Yourself out from Your hide
The Pain will burn for years
But the burn will seperate your years from fear
The cost is nothing but Your pride
If you dare,
Let strenght be what You breed

Life screams
Life kicks
Life rips Your heart out of Your chest,
You're left to bleed
Once here,
Soon there
- At the point where emotions lose control,-
They take the place of Your needs
Once in isolation gone
You didn't even see it Yourself
It's too late to regret
You've no time to forget
Stare the devil in the eyes,-
before it's to late,
to late to

Free My soul
From these evil seeds You've sown
I no longer recognize love in their Eyes
The threath of our Egos must be defied
All the hundreds come before
All Prophets I deny
For I know that the truth is in us all
Now Listen,-
Listen before it dies

I call out from beyond
The grave
