Call me insane they may
for leaving all I have,
but he took a part of me,
so I shall take him down.

Rage born from defeat
is feeding a grand obsession.
Hate blows in my sails
n' makes sure I carry on.

Seeker, traveller,
enemy whom dares though warned.
Seeker, traveller,
enemy whom dares though warned.

The light I had in life,
is left on darkened shores.
Forgotten 'cause of the bitter grief.
Exchanging love for loathe.

[Chorus]

Invaders
This chase is lost
Your hunt is but futile,-
Your life is the cost
Bring you down, take you under
You are in my domain 
I will see the calm be dead again

Heeling, creaking, flooding, under the weather and underneath the waves.

Thank you dear captain for giving us a cold, wet grave.

Seeker, traveller
Seabeast, traveller, entity; you stood your ground.
Seabeast, traveller, entity; you rose and won.
Seabeast, traveller
