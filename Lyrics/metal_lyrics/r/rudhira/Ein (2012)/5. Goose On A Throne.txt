Hey pretty bird
Tweet in my ears what i want to hear
Find fools for the cross,-
Feed the masses with fear
Give us all what we want
Soil the bait with tears

Greasing yourself with our griefs
Feeding yourself with our beliefs
We're eating it up 'cus we're naÑve

For reasons unknown
There's a goose on the throne
(Left there alone)
For reasons unknown
There's a goose on the throne
(Now pick up your stones)

Scheming and deceiving
Stealing and receiving
Serving up lies to get your support.
And that's not a worry 'cause you get what you want

Bribing and conspiring
The highest bidder hiding
Behind your money-stuffed, wide open cunt
And that's not a worry 'cause you still get your vote

Rolling your dice on others expense
Spinning the game to get all the gain.
Dancing with the devil disguised as an angel,
once with the crown let the party commence.

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
