[lyrics: ThornÃ¦s]

The wings i shedÂ 
upon your bed
between your legs
out of myself
Inside your flesh
amongst our sweat
my innocence
all for your love
Intentions vague
our skin did blush
we wrecked our bond
Because of the moments rush

We've got a choice
You've got the looks
I've got the lust
So with a thrust

Feel Love-
The way we tangle into one
Be Love-
Allow desire to become
The wings to take you to your personal bliss
To make a temple of mere flesh
So set your Bodies free

The look that told me what you craved
The invitation that i gave
The arching back, The raising hair
-Anticipating pulsing skin-
The eager movement of your hips
The sweat that glues us as we kiss
No other needs, when feeling this
I'm tasting you between my lips

Silhouettes,
play on white
Hungry shadows,
flames invite
Mirroring,
the dance of flesh
Entwining bodies,
spiritless!

Shells play out the game of shells
From abstract will from inner wells
What form they shape for eyes in skies
Remains unseen for outward eyes
