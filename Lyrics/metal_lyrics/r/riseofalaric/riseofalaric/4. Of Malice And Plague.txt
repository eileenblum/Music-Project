For years we've stood our ground
In an attempt to survive
Extinction lingers on
The women are shrieking
Lemons, deaf, force-fed regret
Gifts from a heartless god
No way to fill the void
No price of existence
No place to see, no words to hear
Look inside yourself
For the reason of mans decline
We have destroyed ourselves
Look inside yourself
Blessed deaf ears fall prey
Leave this and go on searching
Time comes and time ends
Portray yourselves as nothing
Why would you pray?
What are you praying for?
Because we are a dying breed.
We are a dying breed.
