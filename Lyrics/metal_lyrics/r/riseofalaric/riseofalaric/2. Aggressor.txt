The sins we commit
Could never be relived
To feel it is like a
Small piece of gods strength
In my eyes, ascension
I awake and arise
I'll make you choke on your own blood
And every threat you make
Just adds to all my broken faith
Flesh and years is all that remains
A second chance was never my goal
Paralyzed an blinded
I'm taking more than you know
Seclusion, the darkness
We all have been swallowed whole
Turn your backs on all that remains
You'd do the same if it
Wasn't your own life
Flashing right before your eyes
Is your single chance to walk away
A seething cesspool of human decay
Flashing right before your eyes
Clinging to life with nothing but me
On my side
I will dissect you, you'll be reborn
Why would you pray when
I am the epic one
You found your place right on your knees
They shall uncover everything
That we have done here tonight
They will reveal this stage of sacrifice
A desperate attempt to satisfy
An effort to choose my words
What are you afraid of?
The roll of aggressor has changed
