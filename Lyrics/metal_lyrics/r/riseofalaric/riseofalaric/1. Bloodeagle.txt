Into the abyss
Two nails in each of your eyes
Darkness surrounds you
The stench consumes
Buried deep inside
Eggs hatch and eat their way out
I'll laugh as you cry
As far as they'll know
You never took your last breath
I'll make sure to cover
My tracks and erase you
I will be the last
Thing your eyes will ever see
Before I let you die
Lay awake in shame
With my hands bloodstained
I awake in time
To proclaim myself as your king
Lay awake in shame
With my hands blood stained
So let's pretend your life
Will always be the same
It's like my eyes caught the sight
Of your blood
I wanted it all to leak out
And curse the ground
Bodies surround me and I
Could not be more pleased
Racing against the sun
To the body of this one
Out of the night
And into the daylight
Face down against the wall
Blood soaked clothes and all
Face down against the wall
Butchering all that saw
A nightmare with no end in sight
This could take all night
