We've all been fed to a whore
Incarnated to see the death of all
Soon it will be over and
All life will cease to be
All our hatred turns to greed
We're all running on life support
This is the death of man
This is the end, we are no more
Your simple prayers
Can't save anyone now
This is the death of man
Running from the sea
You can't escape this nightmare
We're all in too deep
To know where to go
Destroying us
Nothing more than a memory gospel
As for the end, it isn't over yet
For what we've done
Nothing more than a memory gospel
As for the end
You can't escape this nightmare
We're all in too deep
To know where to go
We've all been fed to a whore
Incarnated to see the death of all
Soon it will be over
And all life will cease to be
All our hatred turns to greed
You can't escape this nightmare
We're all in too deep
To know where to go
This is an example of why
Man cannot control himself
