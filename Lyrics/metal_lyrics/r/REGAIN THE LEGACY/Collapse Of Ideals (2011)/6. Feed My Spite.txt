It was our fate. The purpose of all our broken life! But you've buried the art belonging to everyone!
It was your lie! Your riddles stated by destiny! In sound streams I could hear only -- goodbye!

If you'll hide in my stolen heart - I'll erase you for nothing!
Your diligence for me false!

No! We will not be aside while all temptations are dying, and eyes of muses are filled in perspiration!
No! I'll Kill It Alone! Then you will come back home! Because I know...

It was our war! Another day, another hate!
Before a dawn we are so weak and there are no forces to suffocate!
Let cross the line! Run through my pain to feed my spite!
I eat your wings! And my time has stopped!

If you'll hide in my stolen heart - I'll erase you for nothing!
Your diligence for me false!

No exit! I can't escape this place! Just one more grave on my own battlefield!
I saw that! Your demons had arisen! And my last bullet was for them!

Dead beauty is so infectious!
I eliminate weak cells! The next plague in my Renaissance! It never breaks me!
I've been burnt by a poisonous look, but have not hardened!
Just came here, bitch, and feed my spite!

If you'll hide in my stolen heart - I'll erase you for nothing!
Your diligence for me false!
Your Insanity, Immorality has stopped all my thoughts! So I'm flying for tomorrow!
