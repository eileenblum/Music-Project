The small hearsay wanders that we are united by one secret!
We know that the gods of future play with our sins!

So hold my hand until the end!
We should see through a prism of oblivion!
They wrote in blood our testament!
The Rules of our life!

Don't be afraid of predictions of rotten elders!
Don't turn away! Don't be a shade! You have no time to be empty!

Someday we'll catch the light!
Wings allowed to fly!
It's eternally or never!

We are going forward!
Together we will break this utopia!

Higher and higher!
We'll never stop these movements!
Our fate -- to draw the sun!
But we'll never speak about it!
