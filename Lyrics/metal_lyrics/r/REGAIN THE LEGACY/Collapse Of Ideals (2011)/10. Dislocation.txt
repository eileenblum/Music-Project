Withheld at horrible night, spawned in plague day of blackest sign
But replaced mass of the vessels which I've devastated in time!
No one listens, no one calls! Only bewitching echoes of horn!
They are pulling me down! Down! To six feet in the ground!

It is sacrificed life where hatred corrects!
For your majesty I will drink my blood until the end!

Welcome to outcast tower where are all stay on knees!
They cut their flesh to the bones!

Comprehension is close! On the verge of madness of soul!
With a key from demons cage, where sit the creatures of unmerciful human rage!
With your pity existence, without questions, and with empty eyes!
We will expect you in our refuge of night!

Welcome to outcast tower where are all stay on knees!
They cut their flesh to the bones!

For your majesty I will drink my blood until the end!

It is sacrificed life where hatred corrects!
For your majesty I will drink my blood until the end!

Welcome to outcast tower where are all stay on knees!
They cut their flesh to the bones!
So welcome to my outcast tower where are all stay on knees!
You'll cut your flesh to the bones!
