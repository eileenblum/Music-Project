One step &amp; two step!
But you are stand still!
Under hypnosis of mystical will!
Three step! Four step!
You'll wake up the dead, try to hide the beast that never sleeps!

You are so closer and I can feel your rust from within!
All bile of the decaying hearts of fallen heretics!
Their souls are stinking! Show me - the prophecy!
Prove them - their ideals have been blackened!
But all-consuming and denounced swarm absorbing the dawn!
Full of chaos age erase the human minds! Now each of us the exile!
I saw the rage! It is circulates in their iron veins!
I saw that eyes! The eyes of girl with no fear to die!
Let it will be first breath! Regeneration of values for the dying man!

One step &amp; two step!
But you are stand still!
Under hypnosis of mystical will!
Three step! Four step!
You'll wake up the dead, try to hide the beast that never sleeps!

Find all fragments of eternity
Fight with sadistic slavery
We came down the Earth
Your idols will be fixed
So stop hiding the beast!

Her eyes Burns in Fire of omniscient, napalm of all-seeing!
Scorned by the gods of treachery!
It eats from within morally!
Burns me down! Beast burns me down!
