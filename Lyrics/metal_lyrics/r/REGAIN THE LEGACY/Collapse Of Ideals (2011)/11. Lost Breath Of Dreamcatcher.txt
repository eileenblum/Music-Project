It's the beginning of our last masquerade!
So come here to eat sins for descendants!
The emergency will come so late! We'll get stuck in spiders' web!

What a dance? Looks like magical haze!
What a noise? Sounds like the song of the siren!
That priest! He kneels! Screaming about his blasphemy!

We've forgotten bloody reigns!
We believe in shameful grace!
As if in a lethargic dream we lose our breath!

Everything goes around! Somewhere lost! Found by Someone! It's an infinite wave!
We can't wait for the tables turned! I can give a part of soul!
For the breath of Dreamcatcher! Ones Again!

Liars! You've accustomed to eating the fire from your malice hands!
Silence! Will be broken with the first prayers of the leper in hell!
No one will stop us on a way to the mutilated will!
Tonight the roots of the past will be cut down and prepared!

We've forgotten bloody reigns!
We believe in shameful grace!
As if in a lethargic dream we lose our breath!
