Everyone but me complicate the elementary!
This day all have flashed with mescaline in nerves!
Anyplace but Here the torment day so pure and clear!
I hold my breath and don't look down!

Tell me your confession! It's not my decision to keep your mind in the lie!
So I left you alone! You couldn't go! These sheets are burning!
And you are chained, so better pray! We'll never turn back again!

I saw how heroes fall! The complete task and nothing at all!
They were slaves to own redemptions!
Fear no your enemies, before we meet!
Instincts are not ready for liberation!

Tell me your confession! It's not my decision to keep your body alive!
So I am in chains, so better pray! We'll never turn back again!

Your tides are invisible!
Mistakes are critical but I close eyes!
It's all hypocrisy! You're telling them! They're slashing me!
It's hard to be my perfect enemy!

I close a door and go away! Your god can't save you!
Stop trying to pray! The soul's so fragile!
You have surrendered to me with shameful loyalty!
It's just a Ritual game with the accused nation!

Your tides are invisible!
Mistakes are critical but I close eyes!
It's all hypocrisy! You're telling them! They're slashing me!
It's hard to be my perfect enemy!
