It's time to wake up, my dear child!
The fairytale is over for you!
Again in the world of witches drinking potions, and venal, greedy kings!

Walk down the street, through blackness and dirt sale,
You will not notice decrease in the grief
And lewd condemnation!

The crucified bodies on Calvary hill!
Do you still think we've got out of mother's belly?
You a virus!
So you need one more delayed vaccine!

So defiantly, so disgustingly and feverishly ominous dwelling!
Inhumanity and unholiness reflected in their scalpel!

Cut over the cut covered a breathless body which was better than anybody of us!
In your eyes it's strangled by an umbilical cord! Here is everything's eventual!

And no one can see your motley world! Just sleep in the oblivion!
There you have no a place! In bloody silence we build the palaces of hatred and pain!
These illusions we live! The last thing you should to know - Saint Stilian is dead!

Wake up! We're losing control!
Dark wave washes horizon!
Unborn uttering last squeal!
We can betray our blood just one time in our life!
