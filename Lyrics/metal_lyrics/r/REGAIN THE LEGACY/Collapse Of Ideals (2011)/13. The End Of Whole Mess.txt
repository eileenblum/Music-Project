In those days when all of us will go blind,
You can feel that we live in the shadows!
In expectation of updated life,
We are ready to jump in a chasm!

Twenty seconds to fall - or fly on call!
It is senseless reflect, when you halfway downwards!

Among total ruin it is necessary hope only for yourself!
Among total ruin it is necessary wait for a miracle!

Forty miles to creep- or be defamed!
But we're all dying breed! Remember it!

Deliver us from those who live illusions in anabiosis!
That's what I have devoted!
Deliver us from those who live illusions in anabiosis!
That's what I've dedicated my life for!

Fifteen days to rise or be broken into splinters at last!
But we're not only figures in this world of glass!

Among total ruin it is necessary hope only for yourself!
Among total ruin it is necessary wait for a miracle!

Deliver us from those who live illusions in anabiosis!
That's what I have devoted!
Deliver us from those who live illusions in anabiosis!
That's what I've dedicated my life for!

It is a new page in destinies book!
The end of whole mess!
But pages in blood!
Still waiting for involving in infinite game - rusty process!
And all of us fade! Fade!
