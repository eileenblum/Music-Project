We jump in to the portals of the mimicry!
The surgical opera begins again!
By uncontrolled darkness the portraits will turn black!
With pictures of the almighty faces and their broken necks!

This century of lunacy devours our mentality!
Chronology! We'll never see! Those victories that couldn't be!

They are playing our requiem! These notes are making me calm!
But dissimulated pentagram reminds about that sound!
Wretched one from scorned world just ghost in modern realm!
He is slaughtered in our souls, Regained our legacy!

We are slowly disconnecting with them! This code is colored by red!
Dead signal calls! Sic time is running out!
So follow our horn and fall into the darkness!

We've brought the total decimate for your world!
Simurg has risen -- now it's your turn!
This is beginning of whole mess, so jump with us!
