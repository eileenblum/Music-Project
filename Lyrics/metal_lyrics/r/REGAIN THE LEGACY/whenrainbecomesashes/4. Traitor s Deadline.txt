Through the age of treachery
So fragile to see the collapse of ideals!
I begin my painful trip on highway to nothing!
My fucking coma!
Nocturne lifestyle - end of forgotten reign!

Why we sleep so long!?
Dream cannot get us higher!
Black mirror of your soul - crashed and burnt!

Don't apologize for your feebleness! It was written!
Run behind forgiveness inside the flames!

When I scream -- no one hears me!
I always knew that I chose torture!

I was deserted by my pride,
But what you kind of God you've let me gone and I've got stuck inside!
Forever lost in my mistakes - our horrible part of living!
No word to world! No swirling!

Why we sleep so long!?
Dream cannot get us higher!
Black mirror of your soul - crashed and burnt!

White noise takes us away! You were here and now you're gone!
Has found the way on a line at number nine!
Its sarcastic race among undead!

In the light - the end of your line! One more step! And hold your breath! Your way...
