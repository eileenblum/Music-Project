It can't be Forget!
Creators visit the hell! Without pretending they are standing on the grave of deceit!
Want dominate with red crown on a head!
Searching for exits -- find only questions of bloodiest content!

Towers are falling! Seams are dispersing!
Through flying ashes not to see a gleam!

Children of war suck the blood from mother's veins!
Give them the weapon - they'll take us under control!
We lost our chance! Decay in the past!
And now our legends become a dust!

Here the black sea -- we've drown down! There stone wounds -- can't be licked!
All that was created perishes in us! Overwhelming blindness - then explosion!

The great warned about harm! They were right! Now we only pieces of flesh!
We wait our turn on the slaughter! And the sky fertilizes us ashes!

Fires of horror rise from under the ground!
The fallen will wake, shrouding in anger the crowd!

Consciousness borders are erased! All of that it's necessary - wait!
The cycle is broken! Look at bloody rising, hatred lever has absorbed the light!

This day -- rain becomes ashes!

Missiles are ready! All of us under the gun, in sharp-clawed paws of creeping harm!
And cold wind brings far sounds of pain of those who could not reject pressure!
Mercury cloud of the world that we could not constrain will appear in eyes!
Human essence - Anthropogenous extinction - a payment for our phobias!
