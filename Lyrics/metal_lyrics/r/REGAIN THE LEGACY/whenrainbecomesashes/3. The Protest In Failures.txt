Every Time I Look For You, Sometimes
I'm Bleeding Through -- And Ask Myself
What Have I Done, What am I Doing?
How Can You Punish Yourself?
We Must See Our Reflection!

Those Things Can Change Us -- Cold!
Reform This Illness World -- My Own!

The Quiet Place Where You Can Hide
So Harder Understand
I Couldn't Find - The Protest In Failures
I Waned Be Sadistic Satisfied Without Regret To Us
Pain Makes No Sense For Those Who Never Feel Rejection

I know what they're Hiding From Me!
Another Side Another Life -- I Know we can see!

Only Devil Knows When It's Done!

At The End They Show Us The Rules Of Hate
And We'll Stay On The Knees
Those Who Set On Top -- False
We Sawed The Truth And Washed By Blood Of Insanity
I Want To See The Flesh Outside This Faithless World

I Know What They're Hiding From Me!
Another Side Another Life -- I Know we can see!

Tel Me Who Am I
I Want To Know
Burn The Barricades Of Unknown - We Can't Be Alone
And Last Sinner Will Cry Inside My Mind
These Contradictions Failed When Chains Will Break!

Those Things Can Change Us -- Burn!
Reform This Illness World -- My Own!

I Know What They're Hiding From Me!
Another Side Another Life -- I Know we can see!

I Know What They Hide, I Know What You Hide!
I Know What We Can, I Know And We Must!
Must Change Oneself Despite The Rules!
