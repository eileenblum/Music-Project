Your way was so long! One by one they betrayed and leaving!
We are buried all hopes inside, and the light has appeared the night!
The outcasts slip away! Through thorns, suppressing grief and rage! Are assured that will find itself! It's last chance to stay alive!

You've chosen anger! So do I! We will enslave empty spaces! We just ghosts who fly from severe reality to decaying pleasures!

Fist compresses a grain of defect, which we live! Pity weaknesses! We're a legion of damned on an endless way to the new keeper of secrets!

Sounds of hope, which we believe in - transformed in death's smell!
This is damned place -- where we're destroying ourselves again!

So long! We collected death sins - and then could not let go!
Choose our side! Let's light a torch in last beams of the blackening sun!

Revived freedom in your hands! And your head! Never forget what you stood for!
Pray! Pray for victims that lay down for the new reservation of blackest sun!

The outcasts slip away! Through thorns, suppressing grief and rage! Are assured that will find itself! It's last chance to stay alive!

You've chosen anger! So do I! You've chosen anger for those who fall, creating a new reservation!
