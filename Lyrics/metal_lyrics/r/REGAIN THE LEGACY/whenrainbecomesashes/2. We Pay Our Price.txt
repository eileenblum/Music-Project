When Intentions Burns weâre Falling Down
And God Of Revenge Chosen Knife
Suffer Unlocked And Resisting Rise
Between The Humans In Fear That Canât Realized!

We always Knew â No Pity For The Weaker!

They Say âHire The Conscienceâ! This Dirt Can Bring Down Us All!
Coins Plunge Like a Bullets
Through Horizon Of Sand With Words R.I.P. On The Stone!

Canât Understand!
Theyâre Lying âWe Buy!
Canât Understand!
They Lied â We Buy!

Their Impatienceâs Going Down To Sickness!
No One Ignore But No One Canât Save Oneself!
You Pay Your Price!
Weâre Pay Our Fucking Price!

Canât Understand!
Theyâre Lying âWe Buy!
Canât Understand!
They Lied â We Buy!

Between Two Lies We Searched The Exit!
Screaming on Fate But Standing Steel!
Everyone Want Scream so loud!
And Without Power Lie Down Underground!

Canât Understand!
Theyâre Lying âWe Buy!
Canât Understand!
They Lied â We Buy!
