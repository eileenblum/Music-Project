[M. Teske]

So you tell me stories
I guess itÂ´s all a lie
Did you think I wouldn't see it
So you got a secret
And you got a darker side
But you are not superior
A little cute two-faced
With your deceiving smile
The night accused - no compromise

The time has come
Pay for your sins
No turning back

Only the names have changed
The act remains the same
Your responsibility - a blasphemous contract
Your center of the world
Has no human signs
The iron cross youÂ´re bearing:
Search for your soul

Did you dance with yourself?
Do you know what it feels like?
Living in riddles, living a lie
With a roof on fire
Tear off the disguise
Unexplained - you cheatÂ´nÂ´lie

The time has come
Pay for your sins
No turning back

Only the names have changed
The act remains the same
Your responsibility - a blasphemous contract
Your center of the world
Has no human signs
The iron cross youÂ´re bearing:
Search for your soul
