[M. Teske]

I just canÂ´t believe my eyes
It turned out this way
It seems that IÂ´m lost in lies
IÂ´m trapped in this way

Across the seven waters
Erase the rules inside
The ashes keep burning
Burning all the way

Go straight my way
Til it is over.
IÂ´m here so strong
Now and forever

Long ignored all the signs
Too late for a change
My instincts are far too late
A gordian knot

Sacrifice your senses
Regain the open mind
And when the night is over
Just do it all again

It ainÂ´t over

And though I look from afar
WasnÂ´t I too blind to see?
Why won't you tell me something?
Don't read between the lines
