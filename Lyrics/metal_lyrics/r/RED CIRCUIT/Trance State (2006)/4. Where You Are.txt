[M. Teske / C. Somapala / D. Wolff]

The final answer revealed the truth.
The lies mask our land from the oath
My soul unfilled - desperated
What turned to stone gave inner signs
The vision of an unborn face
My roots are torn - I'm torn apart

IÂ´ll grab my heart out
And hurl it at the sun
The belly of the heat, devoured by flames
Another journey
Into the madness
I'm alright at some certain point
WHERE YOU ARE

Watching the wheels of different youth
A face, no grin, nothing more to say
All words had enough conversation
I'll build some distance
Caused by the fire
Stupid heads, so all alone

WHERE YOU ARE
Affirm the echoes of the past
Reflect an image for a mask
Silent cries will arrive to change it
WHERE YOU ARE
