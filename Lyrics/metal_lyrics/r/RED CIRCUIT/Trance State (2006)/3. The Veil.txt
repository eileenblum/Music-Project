[C. Somapala]

Her silky hair
Why does she hide in nature's sunlight
Her angry stare
A phantom figure of the night

The eyes of fire
Burns me insane
And drags me to the ground
I get higher
When she entertains
A sequined veil around

Her lewd motions
Captured my soul, full of lust
Why can't you see
An erection with angel dust

The eyes of fire
Burns me insane
And drags me to the ground

Her heavenly rhyme
I'm tangled in a dream of lost souls

The eyes of fire
Burns me insane
And drags me to the ground
I get higher
When she entertains
A sequined veil around
