[M. Teske]

I knew you for so long
As a brother in arms
Should have seen it before
But all warnings have failed
I hear echos from afar
Inside my head
Is it mistrust?
My heart feels betrayed

Is it gold you're after?
WhatÂ´s a judas kiss?
Or the fate of generations?
Follow whatÂ´s deep inside

Turn my wine to water
Riddles to be solved
Hidden treasures of the past
Reveals the mystery - Is it gold?

WhatÂ´s the draw of the cards?
To possess all senses
WhatÂ´s your El Dorado?
WhereÂ´s your desert storm?

With a tunnel vision view
This pain will remain
Exploring yourself
And fall into flames

Is it gold you're after?
WhatÂ´s a judas kiss?
Or the fate of generations?
Follow whatÂ´s deep inside
Turn my wine to water
Riddles to be solved
Hidden treasures of the past
Reveals the mystery - Is it gold?
