[M. Teske]

You follow philosophies
Dismantled by agencies
Pushing the folks to the fire
And hiding their faces behind a mask
IÂ´m so exhausted
Trying to convert the world
About the evil core
And facts don't deny!

ItÂ´s so hard to be like god

No barricades for the crusade
Awake in a better land
The way to make a change
And finally switching on their head
Can you listen? Do you listen?
Or is the damage done?

ItÂ´s so hard to be like god
Drown in a sea of lies!
