[M. Teske]

Whisper my name, scratch my back til I scream
Pulsating blood in our veins
Playing the game, sudden urge deep within
Never tried to break the stare, takinÂ´ the time

You might have been queen
Mistakes are unforeseen
You might have been queen

Follow the rules of mystical minds
A roleplay of pleasure and pain
Intimate secrets, keeping self respect
Got the right to stand tall, enlightened minds

You might have been queen
Mistakes are unforeseen
Seasoned with a sense of sin
You might have been queen

I seek the sun
Expose cheating minds
Or trust in the long search for truth beyond
Howl at the moon
Like a half-blinded dog
Did you ever believe in anyone else?
