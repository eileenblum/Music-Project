[C. Somapala]

A gleaming light,
Riding thru the night
To a vicious place, I've never been
I see your eyes,
It's heavenly and lies
Drags me down to the edge

Far away, living insanity
Miles away, endless thoughts
Back to the screen

A flashing site,
A surfing delight
The most precious place I've ever been
The fear inside
Has no demise
In cyberspace, drives me insane

Far away, living insanity
Miles away, endless thoughts
Far away, forgive desire
Miles away, aimless lust
Back to the screen

ItÂ´s time to look ahead
Alone in exile as in conflict
Shades of colors turn to grey
Never be the same
Split in pieces, years in seconds
WhereÂ´s the way back home?
