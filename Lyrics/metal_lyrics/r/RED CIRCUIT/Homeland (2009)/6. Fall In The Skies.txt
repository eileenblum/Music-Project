The signs and flames of the universe
Should refine the look in your eyes
Who holds the key to the door on the borderline
That warns us of the fall in the skies

As the story is ending all will come to a sense
Neutralize your mind defending frames

Take a spaceship and fly away with me tonight
We are sunchasing minds
While we follow the songs of the night we are blinded
By the sunfiction, soulpicture, light

Losing our way, we run over paganfields
Like a storm, through the machines of time
I see the wings of a dragonfly,
They burn when she comes so near
Stay away stay away - away from this fire

As the story is ending we will come to a sense
To remind us all before it's too late

Take your spaceship and fly away with me tonight
We are all dragonflies
Blinding our sunchasing minds
By the sunfiction, soulpicture, light

All is coming to an end
All is coming to a sense
I saw this life is a lie
Before I fell into the skies
