Life's not a fairy tale
It's not an ugly truth
Depending on our point of view
Bloodfoam of thunderstorms
Which cruises through the earth
It doesn't mean this world
Is going astray - astray

Talk to me, show the inside of your soul
All the secrets serve their needs
Even sinners fall in love

Can't defy
Touch the stars and dare to see it
From the other side
A point of no return
See the truth
Breathing deep in danger
Just to dare to picture this
And canonize your sins

I wanna see the light
I wanna have it all
And I just wanna catch you if you fall
I wanna chain your heart
I wanna eat your soul
Immaculate eyes, burning inside

Feel with me, show the belly of your rose
There's no bitter taste of pain
Touch all bases, wind it up

Can't defy
Touch the stars and dare to see it
From the other side
A point of no return
See the truth
Breathing deep in danger
Just to dare to picture this
And canonize your sins

Canonize your sins

Talk to me, show the inside of your soul
All the secrets serve their needs
Even sinners fall in love

Can't defy
Touch the stars and dare to see it
From the other side
A point of no return
See the truth
Breathing deep in danger
Just to dare to picture this
And canonize your sins
