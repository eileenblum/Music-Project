A foreboding leads through mysterious fields
And nobody knows
A stranger to myself in mystical lands
Nobody knows the way

I'm on the border to face the fight
I'm on the way for my search inside
I wanna drown in the night
Before I rise I finally see the light

I see the light into the dark
I see the light into the dark

A visionary daze, death and rebirth at once
It's like liquid pain
A dream within fields of pure reality
Alone with this strange demon

And I'm still trying to face the fight
I'm on my way to the frozen might
I wanna drown in the night
Is it the search for the truth of the light?

I see the light into the dark
I see the light into the dark

Where we go, where we flee
I see clouds, clouds chasing lights

Before I rise I finally see the light

I see the light into the dark
I see the light into the dark
I see the light into the dark
Into the dark
