Drinking from the sunlight feels like flying
Sipping from a star shows me the deepness of my soul

Cannot get away, I cannot get away, I can't deny it
So I'm losing control, I'm losing control
God I'm losing control

Another day, another life
I cannot get enough, I can't deny it
Another fate, another try
I welcome all my demons, I'm losing my control

Feels like Absinth, like Absinth
Feels like Absinth, Absinth
The tango of my soul feels like Absinth, like Absinth
Feels like Absinth, Absinth
I'm about to lose control, to lose control

On another day another try
Like a leading trace into my darkness

A toxic smile, a hidden lie
What's the preparation for the voices call

Feels like Absinth, like Absinth
Feels like Absinth, Absinth
The tango of my soul feels like Absinth, like Absinth
Feels like Absinth, Absinth
I'm about to lose control, to lose control

The nature of the game is addicted to the rule
I just don't wanna paint this picture blue

Here we are and my love is alive
Let's celebrate this calm before the storm

Cannot get away, I cannot get away, I can't deny it
Si I'm losing control, God I'm losing control

Feels like Absinth, like Absinth
Feels like Absinth, Absinth
The tango of my soul feels like Absinth, like Absinth
Feels like Absinth, Absinth
I'm about to lose control, to lose control
