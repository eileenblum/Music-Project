The darkest sky is cleared
And the frozen ice will melt
And the sky above is filled with desert's sand

The sky above is built
For the brightness of the stars
Beyond the stars we'll rise again

The symbols of the past
Have ruled my way too long
And soon they will be forgotten

Eyes of a child killed the mystery
So my wheel keeps turning

Healing waters, dreamless sleep
Whispering silence
Healing waters from another world
Here in these long forgotten fields

The nerd is getting wise
And the judge will quit his job
It's all filled up with crazy hope

Spark will start the fire
Cause the truth was always there
And I was just too blind to see

Buried beneath
The secret of this world
Buried beneath the secrets
Buried beneath the secrets

The eye of a child is true
And my wheel is turning

Healing waters, dreamless sleep
Whispering silence
Healing waters from another world
Here in these long forgotten fields

The eye of a child is true
And my wheel is turning

Healing waters, dreamless sleep
Whispering silence
Healing waters from another world
Here in these long forgotten fields

Healing waters, healing waters
Healing waters
Here in these long forgotten fields
