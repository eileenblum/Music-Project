Silence, reasons - came to an end
Distance, prayers - are fading away

A vision that cures, voices inside
You can sleep when you're dead

Changes, mistakes - wasting a life
Father, mother - words are in vain
You're hiding behind those staring eyes
You can sleep when you're dead

Can you change this life?
Can you stop this strife?
Staring at the sky
Can't remember why

Silence on the way, forces me to stay
Can't define what's wrong
Can't believe what's going on

Sensitive words, nobody hears
Silence surrounds your state of mind
Everything spins, so paralysed
It's time to take another way

You can sleep while you're dead
