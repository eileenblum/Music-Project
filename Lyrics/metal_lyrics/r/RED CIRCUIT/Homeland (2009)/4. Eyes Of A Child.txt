What has done wrong? This world is a mess
See mother's fighting for their guns

I wanna live and wanna die
Will you put roses on my grave?

The madman - salutes you
You better take care and look at yourself
You better watch out now
A cold day in hell is like paradise

Through the eyes of a child it's clear to see
As time flushes forward the innocence dies

How do we know and where do we go
Mighty echoes of forgotten worlds

The promises are worth less than lies
Are the assassins on their way?

Is it to strong to go for the fight?
The whores you chose might pay the price

The madman - salutes you
You better take care and look at yourself
So better watch out now
A cold day in hell is like paradise

The eyes of a child endless wisdom
As time flushes forward no innocence dies

This way we know where we should go
Mighty echoes of forgotten worlds

When children cry the innocence dies
