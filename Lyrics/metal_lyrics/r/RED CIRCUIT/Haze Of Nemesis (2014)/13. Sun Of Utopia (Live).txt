It's just amazing - when the silence is roaring
This is amazing - like the light in your eyes

I can see you hiding when the dark horse is rising
I will be around there when the laughter cries

This is amazing - you're creating a nightmare
This is amazing - are you scared in the light?
Your sun featuring arrow
Is married to a blind gunman
I am calling and we're going just to

Reach out for the sun of Utopia
Watch out for a sign in the sky
In charge of the freedom in heaven
Starring as the damage is done

Reach out for the sun in the sky
Reach out for the sun of goodbye
Reason you can't ignore

Lying in the name of all gods
Turning words into the absurd
Denying all human signs

I see you're dancing on nothing
Meet your personal hangman
I am calling and we're going just to

Reach out for the sun of Utopia
Watch out for a sign in the sky
In charge of the freedom in heaven
Starring as the damage is done
