[originally by Deep Purple]I have often told you stories about the way.
I lived the life of a drifter, waiting for the day.
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me, love me
And I would surely stay.

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung.
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill goin' 'round.

I guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune.

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new.
In days of old when nights were cold,
I wandered without you.
But those days I thought my eyes had seen you standing near.
Though blindness is confusing, it shows that you're not here.

Now I feel I'm growing older
and the songs that I have sung.
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill goin' 'round.

Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune.
I can hear the sound of a windmill goin' 'round.
Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune,
Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune..
