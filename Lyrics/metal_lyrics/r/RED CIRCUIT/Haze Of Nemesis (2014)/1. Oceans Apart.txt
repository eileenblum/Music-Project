The riddle will remain
A shattered dream is alive
A labyrinth can drive mankind insane

How to ease the pain?
The murmur is too loud
Watch me on my stairway to the sun

Oceans apart
Does it feel far away?
Hollow inside
On a road I've been before

On another day
You push me around
But this is not the field to play on

So far from god
More far from you
I'm nailed to that cross
Which tears me apart

Answering the sun
I'll follow the moon
I can't sit and wait
That won't keep me alive

I can see
A dead man walking
Reflecting only myself

So tell me now
Is it me to be judged
Is all that I see just a lie?

One empty world
One love that dies
Kissin' the snake
Open that gate
