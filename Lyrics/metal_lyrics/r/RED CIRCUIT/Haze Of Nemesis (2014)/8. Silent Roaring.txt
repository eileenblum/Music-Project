It cannot be undone
The blood is on your cheek
You smashed a life
And that's not nearly all

This is so unreal
Can lifeless creatures still bleed?
Are you afraid to sleep forever?

Buried beneath the secrets
Of this world, the eyes of a lie

Silent roaring, evil seed
Just ashes remaining
Silent roaring - too loud to be heard
We live in god-forsaken lands

No more moral rules
You nearly broken them all
Nothing in this world remains the same

No matter where you are
No matter what you do
You are accountable for what you've done

The eye of a child is true
Is what we believe
Your eye of a lie

With a heart made of stone
You smacked a rose down to the ground
The damage is done
Your incantation stoked by hate
