[feat. Amanda Sommerfield]Can I die, heart on hand
What's the reason for losing my way?
My wound never heals
But I love you to death
Can you forgive all the mistakes that I've made?

Can I die, face the fire
Can I discern between evil and good?
I regret all the things that went wrong
Will I be damned?

Worlds will collide
There is no time to waste
Can I rewind
That would feel like coming home

Where is the way to rescue my love?
Awakening in silence that feels so absurd

Praying and bleeding
These screams from inside
Cannot get away from a lifetime love

Waiting for love
Longing for love
Bound by this begin
And my words might fail again

Worlds will collide
As it slips through my hands
Can I rewind
That would feel like coming home

Worlds will collide
As I picture the scene
It's not a game
'Cause no one can win
