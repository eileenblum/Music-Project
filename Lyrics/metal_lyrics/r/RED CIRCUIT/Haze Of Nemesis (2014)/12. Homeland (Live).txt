And it seems like natural day

In the mess we call it freedom
Hides a misery called the death
Just an error in the system
Of our world defending plan

So we're waiting for absolution
Politicians will do the rest
And they're terrorizing nations
With blind missionary faith

We create an everlasting faith
But homeland is so far away

For the virus of the money
It'll ever be the same
All the pirates of the brave new world
Are sailing under holy banners name

Still we're longing for absolution
Haven't learned a single thing
And we're terrorizing nations
It's a never-ending world commanding shame

And it seems to me like never-ending days
Homeland is so far away
Seems to me like never-ending days
And homeland is so far away

Homeland is so far away
