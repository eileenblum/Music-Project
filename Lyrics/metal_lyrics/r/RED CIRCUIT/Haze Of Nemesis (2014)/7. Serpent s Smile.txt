The surface of truth
Is scratched by a lie
The madman appears in so many ways

Your return to dust
With dope for a brain
Ain't no alibi

What is the book to learn how to lie?
Am I a pawn in your game?

Am I delayed? No time to run
Now it's too late, the die is cast

Facing a serpent's smile
Burning a page of life

The promise you kept means nothing to me
The future is far more important than this

Justice, revenge or just even sins
It means a clean record

False sanity is driving me mad
Takes over my head

A karma that burns, rotten inside
Within this mist, stay alive

Time will not heal
The scars on my soul
But even though
Whisper a wish tonight
