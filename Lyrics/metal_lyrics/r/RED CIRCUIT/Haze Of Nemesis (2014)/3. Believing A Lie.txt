I had to hide
Can you say the spider acts on his own?
Persecute this delusion
Just a poke towards my world

I believed in a lie
All human values passing by
Life taking on a legal crime
The trace is clear to see

I've been to paradise
The homicide of angels unavenged
I don't know if I'd already died
My awakening just seems in vain

I believed in a lie
All human values passing by
So the trace is clear to see

See the tides of time
The wisdom of all gods ignored
See yourself in time
Another world torn

Have a look at ancient times
History repeats itself
Now as I roll the dice
The principle of pain pays its dues

I believed in a lie
All human values passing by
Life taking on a legal crime
The trace is clear to see
