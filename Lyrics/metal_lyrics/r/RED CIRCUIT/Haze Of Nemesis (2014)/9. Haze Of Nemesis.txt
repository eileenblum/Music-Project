To my amazement I'm not alone
The madman joins my home
Shivering waters, I can't defy
Don't mind the rain falls down
Falling down

Totally exiled deep inside my brain
Crossing the border in a single day

The ashes will remain
In a picture of my burning grave
Beyond eternity
I await the haze of Nemesis

Between the flintstones, a dying flame
Too small to warm my place
Show me the fire, I see again
The picture of my grave

Totally exiled deep inside my brain
Crossing the border in a single day

The ashes will remain
In a picture of my burning grave
Beyond eternity
I await the haze of Nemesis

Totally exiled deep inside my brain
Crossing the border in a single day
Heaven's divided, I'm splitting the scene
Chaining the flower of my memory
