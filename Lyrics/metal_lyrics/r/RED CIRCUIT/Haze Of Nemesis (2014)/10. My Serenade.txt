Past is gone and that nearly
Pulled me under
Caught in a circle
Of a space time ring of fire
My ambitions are alive

Finally arrived
Fulfilled my vision
Turning the cards
Correcting what went wrong

In the blink of an eye
Time is passing by
Bleeding skies

My serenade, a timeless tale
I can feel the fire
Reveal a newborn child

Walking on air and I can see the sign
A true believer is one of a kind

In the blink of an eye
Time is passing by
Bleeding skies

My serenade, a timeless tale
I can feel the fire
Reveal a newborn child

So I'm forced to have a closer look
My world has changed a total mess
And I can realize myself
With fatal grins and pain of loss
You can't see the love we shared
Is erased and wiped out
There seems no second chance
But I cannot survive on my own

And the smell of gasoline
Will lead me to an answer that fulfills
My inner wish, I can't deny
This world will never see and realize
The evil eye

I probably may have sinned
But hear my serenade
A love that dies
Is born to sin

His serenade, a timeless tale
He's been through the fire
To hell and back again

I'll find a way 'cause there's more
I'll find a way but I cannot survive
Cannot survive, cannot survive
On my own.
