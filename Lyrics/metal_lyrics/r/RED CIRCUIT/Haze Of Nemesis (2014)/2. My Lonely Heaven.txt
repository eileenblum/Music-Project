Searching for God
With immaculate eyes
Agreement to hate
Stealing our souls

The contract is signed
My damage is done
The scroll darkened the light

I'm still awake
Regret on my lips
All because of your word

My true intent
Making it worse
Swallowed by fallacies' spite

My lonely heaven, my love till I die
I signed a contract to sell my life
Oh lord save my soul
The evil awakes
I'm stitching my wounds
Blinded by faith and remorse

What a disgrace
Six feet under dreams
I feel I'm buried alive

This burden sends
A mental disease
So passionate love turns to pain

I'm ready to fly
In fire I see the light

My lonely heaven, my love till I die
I signed a contract to sell my life
Oh lord save my soul
