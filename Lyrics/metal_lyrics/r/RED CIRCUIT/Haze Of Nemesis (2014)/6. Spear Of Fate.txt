Is there any other change
To see it like I do
My mind will picture a scene

It's the same with you and me
A lie among us all
Apocalyptical signs

The spear of fate is waiting for its poke
The murders hate
The spear of fate

The exhumation of this world
Made it clear to see
The past continues today

The waste of blood has gone too far
The virgin's sacrificed
But I won't give up the fight
The spear of fate is waiting for its poke
The murders hate is rising all the way
As the master called your name
His voice released the animal
The spear of fate

We all should know
The seed of good is growing slow
Be patient on the way

Be a safe place
Treat your brother like yourself
One step for the world

Expose yourself to the universe
You don't need a god

And take the challenge every day
Guidance everywhere
