Buy the most expensive coffin
buy the life that you desire
buy the most beautiful lover
buy the friends that you don't have.
Swing and move just like a peacock
filled with nothing crowned with gold

Buy respect and some ideals
until you have no soul to sell.
Hide your misery and sorrow
behind the vanity of your dreams
buy the hopes of your tomorrow
it's a bargain, they come cheap.

And when death will come to claim you
I'll be watching from afar
when all your gold will turn to dust
Oh, what a nice corpse you are!
