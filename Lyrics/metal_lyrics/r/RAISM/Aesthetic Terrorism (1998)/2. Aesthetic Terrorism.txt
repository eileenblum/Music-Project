Surrounded by shadow beings
tasteless worthless humans
trapped into a world of pacifism
no hate, no love, just grey.

Huge oppressive buildings
trying to reach the stars
cold masses of concrete
like huge funeral stabs.
I'll burn your buildings down
I'll reap your hearts apart
crush your filthy temples
and make the world a better place
A better place for living beings
and not for walking corpses.

All that I want around me
are the people that I love
are the people that I hate
people that make me live.

All that I want around me
are images of beauty
pictures that keep me alive
that send my spirit higher.

YOU ARE NOT NEEDED
YOU'RE A PLAGUE
