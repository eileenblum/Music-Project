Come in
and show me
how it feels to own
all you've ever wanted

Drowning
like a fly in my drink
you talk me about being on the brink

The ways
you try to put me down
to ground
Sweet revenge
for the things I've done

Till now
I've always thought
things may be wrong
and sometimes
it's more than what it's worth

Stares down
nothing left to say
it's the loudest sound
I have ever heard

So you know
how it feels
wake up feeeling grey
nothing much to think and nothing much to say

How does it feel
to treat me like you do?
How should I feel
still gazing at the moon
