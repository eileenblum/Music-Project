all the things (I feel) you confuse
put them here (in my mind) with some glue

(I learnt the story so enjoy it high)
It's the same, I'll fly to reach my little town
In the shame I'll forget you
Now take, well it's my new address

So please take some money for the picture
I'm not ready to keep something precious
I will speak no more about my feelings
But I thank you for bringing me Budapest
