I can't wait for you this time
What makes me wonder
Feel so low some days
Don't ask me what comes next

I can't wait for you this time
Things make me wonder
Midnight has been calling me
and something's over

I can feel the distance
to a past that's on its way
Is the wait enough to
make you go down on your knees?

I could go out in style
going back from where I came
Feel so low some days
it's the hardest thing I've done

When it's cold some days
Don't ask me what comes next
Then I'll be glad

In the shadows of the silver tree line image
Of the high
Skyward brilliance left above
To hone each sparkle in the sky

And I know
all that I'm trying
When I'm in need of your smile
Is a waste of time
