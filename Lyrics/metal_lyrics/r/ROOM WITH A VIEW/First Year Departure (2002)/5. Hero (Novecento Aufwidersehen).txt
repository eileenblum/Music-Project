before they lay their hands on you
and make you just like the rest

it's time to make amends for all
the fun
all the damage done

i need to be cleansed
it's time to make amends

I watched you change into a fly
I never really mean it
and I watched a change in you
it's like you never had wings
now this is a lie

I watched you change into a fly
the room is small, the room is bright
tonight I'll dream of hours so long
without (even) trying
Im' flying, I scream
Now you feel alive

"Is this how it happens?
Is this how it feels?"
"Is this how a star falls?
Is this how it feels?"
"Is this how a star falls?
Is this how it happens?"
"Is this how it feels?"

and I don't want to be
a hero of the time
no matter where you take me
take me away

away
I can feel so clearly
that the time has come
