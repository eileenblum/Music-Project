This season must die
it's falling dead behind me
Another light grows into me
the tears turn into fire

Forever
It will fall

And this illusion is near to fall
forever is not ever
Through a frozen memory I had to live
but now it's time to leave it

For a second of your life
Tell me if it's true
(The king must die)

Just a second of your time
Anyone will do
(I'll play my rules)
