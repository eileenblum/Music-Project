She uses to sleep with the lights on
She's not so happy, feels not secure
Feels like she's waiting for something to change
Something she's been dreaming for a while
She lights a match, drops and wait for
Something she's been dreaming for a while

Now everything she wants
Seemed to hide behind
her smile and her eyes
And I'm locked down here
Remembering our goodbyes
"Will you call back?"
That's what she's praying for
Could she ever know
That I'm locked down here
Remembering our goodbyes

She lights a match, drops and wait for
something she's been dreaming for a while
As the flames start to embrace us
Words cloud our minds with waves of regret
