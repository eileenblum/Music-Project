Three years by now i keep on thinking
it's hard to think
I should come down to earth

The tides have turned, horizon's fading
How would i wish you to see how it feels

It's the same old inborn feeling that
I don't belong here, I don't belong anywhere
stealing words along the silent smiles

Sometimes I lay awake in your room
while thinking that this couldn't be
Sometimes I lie asleep all day long
because there's nothing left to see

Now close your eyes, and I'll be swimming
And water's moving just right through the sound

The tides have turned, horizon's fading
I won't be home before the morning comes

All that is gone
It used to be easy
But I've never even tried

Now winter's come
and I should be waiting
'cause reasons like seasons
they constantly change

But this winter is lasting forever
This circus we're in has decamped
and those pills divide us from sanity
and show how fate turns around in the overtime
and I'm
so tired
of days
that feel just like the nights
that feel just like the nights
that feel
I have to start
all over again
