It's time to hear inside you
It feels like a prayer
Everything's clear
Everything, everything...

Across the sky
I'll leave you
Miles far away
Everything's seen
Everything everything is revealed

I should've known how you'd feel
now i know i fear it's time
to change direction
I should've known how you'd feel
now i know I fear that's not
the right direction

It's time to feel inside you
It seems like a prayer
Everything's clear
Everything, everything...

Across the sky
I'll leave you
Miles far away
Everything' seen
Everything everything

Penitence
You've come to take me home
One last farewell
