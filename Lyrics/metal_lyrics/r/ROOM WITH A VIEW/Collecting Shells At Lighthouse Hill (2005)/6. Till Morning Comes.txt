Step aside from the morning light
New faces come and go
And we don't want to feel this
We don't want to stand right there
Between the devil and the deep sea
Bear up and walk away.

Their lies still burn
but we won't stop dreaming
I hold my breath
Until I'm shaking
(Time's not waiting)
Our wounds still hurt
but we won't stop dreaming

Tight! Hold tight!
Remember what I said
Please take these hands
And we'll never fall apart
Till morning comes

Feed the flames,
Winter's drawing close now
our time is drawing near
Step outside to apologize
a blindfold tiring walk
Bear up and walk away
