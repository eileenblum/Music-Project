Guide me
Comfort me
Into this emptiness
Into this void that's consuming us

Time kills
Stands so still
Into this emptiness
Into the fire...

Cross the farther side of heaven
"How are you feelin' now?"
Hoarsely will you speak....

If you died right now you
Know that I would die too
(I'd die too)
All I've left to give you
My own life without you
Nothing'll never part us
Never

Guide me
Comfort me
This hope that you've concealed
But I would rather have you forget it

Being
Constantly
In flight from what I've done
It is a spiral
