Say goodbye
Sailed away from you
This summer's a tragic drive
and time is poetry

Say you tried
Dream yourself away
While waiting for the tide out
We could start a fire

Seems I'm still
waiting for
this coming season
but this time is the last time
(Last time, last time)
I'll leave for
the sunrise
of this coming season
'cause this time is the last time

Close your eyes
Fade the pain away
You wish upon a star but
Do you know what stars are?

Night has come
People slip away
Rain falls as no life's given
You can't help but feel alone

This summer storm brings me your
your last breath
The things that you've concealed
are the things that you had come to fear the most

I'll run until my heart'll burst
and hold my breath
My thoughts are still of you
And this is what I've come to fear the most
