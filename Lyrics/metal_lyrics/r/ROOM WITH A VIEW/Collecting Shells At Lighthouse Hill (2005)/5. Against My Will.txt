Sounds Like - I'm watching those reflections falling
Downtime - A clear picture of this situation
Goals Fade - There's a room where lights won't find you
No Way - It's the ending music for you

Lights Out - Every sound now turns to silence
No way - It's the ending music for you

It's a lying down to stand
and it won't be long now
Against my will
I feel you

Sounds Like - I'm counting my convictions falling
Downtime - Every failure's just as sweet as the last
Goals Fade- When you shoot the dice I must be off
No Way - It's the ending music for you
the ending music for you
