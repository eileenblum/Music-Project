You were born into the wrong family; you got categorized from day one.
Are you any worse than anyone else is or did your genes determine your fate?
It is time to learn to get by in your life, to accept where you came from; no sense in fighting back, you are born to be less than the others are.
Poverty was invented to make smart people simple.
The poor class is sustained to make right people wrong.
There's no way to educate that unselected mind; the classified brain is destined to be untalented.
No way to educate the useless brain, people from below shall breed into a class that stays low.
