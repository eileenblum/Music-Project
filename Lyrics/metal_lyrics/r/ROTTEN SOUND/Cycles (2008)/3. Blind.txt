Every pitiful day is wasted on useless things; every measure is taken to make ridiculous commitments.
Our openness leads us to total insanity; our inner minds melt and cause instability and anxiety.
Questioning is kept outside these blinded minds during all the cruel days we go forward.
We are blinded to be all alone in this world, we are bound to stay in front of those eyes, we are grinded by our ways to give and it is time to let go and give away all there was before.
The criticism against what used to be wrong is weakening; it is time to open the filthy box inside our senseless minds.
