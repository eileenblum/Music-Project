We distrust everything we see.
Take a look around - it won't be in there.
No one will save us from our misery inside this depressive state.
Possessed minds, blinded ways and monstrous days to kill...
We leap to a new destination and greet other simple slaves.
Pain eats something inside us and fools have chosen to stay alone.
They want to run this community and the pool of stupidity leads our lives.
Possessed minds, blinded ways and monstrous days to kill...
We distrust everything we see.
Take a look around - it won't be in there.
No one will save us from our misery inside this depressive state.
Possessed minds, blinded ways and monstrous days to kill ourselves.
