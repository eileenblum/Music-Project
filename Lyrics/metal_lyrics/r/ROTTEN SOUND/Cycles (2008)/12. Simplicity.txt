Work gives everything one ever needs; vacations have become obsolete.
Stupidity, slavery, simplicity, greed and insanity.
Pleasure is not what we seek; we shall only dwell in our misery.
Work gives everything one ever needs; vacations have become obsolete.
In the places we spend our time, we sleep but do not live and let go.
Birth, education and work make us the slaves of this society, stupidity, slavery, simplicity, greed and insanity.
