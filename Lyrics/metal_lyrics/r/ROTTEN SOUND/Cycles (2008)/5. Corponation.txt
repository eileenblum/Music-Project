We live to feed the nation; we die to serve the corporation.
The societies we lived in the past provided the ways of the free world; the evolution through he past generations is to be devastated.
The cultures we have spice our reason to live; they take us to higher levels of humanity.
The merging of the nations as parts of the company.
Die for this nation!
Neglect that nation to come, forget the corporation and kill the corporation!
