Our minds are fed every day.
The internet feeds our needs and we follow every single word that has ever been told.
It's time to get sick; sicker than you ever were, sicker than anybody else was, to stick the sickness into pieces of our minds.
Do not be scared; today is your day.
Do not feel any pain as this day was already sold.
Sold out!
We are spoon-fed with bent truth; we're taking it as if it were something new.
Our minds are the subject of a global fraud; it is mindless to ignore it and not to see through it all.
