We are heading back to the Stone Age; we are doomed to be saved- Things will become more simple through survival instincts when the globe becomes overloaded and the South is enslaved.
Is there anything worth saving, as the cycles will take us back here again?
Cycles of insanity are cleaning up this globe through the decimation of this arrogant race in charge.
Five thousand years from now, we'll see this again, the cycles of stupidity, the repeated history.
Back to the Stone Age; we are doomed to be saved- Things will become more simple through survival instincts when the globe becomes overloaded and the South is exploited.
Five thousand years from now, we'll see this again, the cycles of insanity, the repeated history: we are the cancer of this globe.
The precious planet Earth is now polluted, raped and molested by the retarded human race that destroys it piece by piece.
