The expensive labor of the North makes the Western World to calculate that costs to be less elsewhere.
World War III will not be what we have foreseen; it won't be a nuclear winter, but a fight for survival in the world within.
Your corporation is moving to the South and the East: it rules their industry and makes your management filthy rich.
This planet cannot take the burden from the South; it can't bear the growth and the greed of the North.
All this kills nature, changes the climate, consumes vitality and reveals the last crisis.
Prophecies of doom will finally come true; the apocalypse will be revealed.
World War III will not be what we have foreseen; it won't be a nuclear winter, but a fight for survival in the world within.
