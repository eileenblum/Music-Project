Money runs everything around us; it keeps the worlds turning, growing and burning.
Sustained growth is a lie; it cannot be done.
Greed and loss of humanity are throwing outside the values we have and one cannot live without a promise to earn some more.
Lord is to be praised and sacrificed in the names of the bills and cards.
You cannot survive without, you cannot have too much, money runs everything, and it is possible to buy another life.
Lord is to be praised and sacrificed in the names of the bills and cards.
Wars are to be declared in the names of these new gods.
The ownership of material is to be fought over this time until there is nothing else around, other than burning saviors and gods.
The lord is to be praised, the Jesus is to be sacrificed in the names of the gods: bills, coins, credits and cards.
