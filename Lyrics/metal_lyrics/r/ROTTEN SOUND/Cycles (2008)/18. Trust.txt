Promises made for commitments with insane meanings; nobody was able to see through their fake sincerity and dishonesty.
Openness outside their twisted minds is deceiving everyone around them.They have said many things they never meant to say.
They can live with the lies coming out of their mouths.
They have no second thoughts even when they have deceived their precious beloved community.
The simple human race is deceived by their leaders; the trust was gained over a very long time until they were nailed.
Openness outside their twisted minds is deceiving everyone around them in every possible way they know.
