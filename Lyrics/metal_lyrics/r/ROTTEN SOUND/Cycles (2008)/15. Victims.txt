You saw what was coming; you could have resisted everything.
It was our time to get up and that was our day to win.
You are victims of your own apathy, victims of passive democracy.
Another chance came across and making a stand against was in your hands.
It was the time to get up and shout, to use your vote and to choose the left side.
You are victims of your own apathy, victims of passive democracy.
