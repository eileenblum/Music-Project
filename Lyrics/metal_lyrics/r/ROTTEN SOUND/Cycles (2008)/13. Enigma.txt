Alone in my mind I know that someone else is in control.
My will was altered for the first time before I learned how to doubt.
My will to live is almost gone; there is no need to suffer anymore.
Deep down in my brain I am becoming more afraid.
There must be someone else in charge of my inner self.
My will to live is almost gone; there is no need to suffer anymore.
Lies inside my pitiful head are what I need to go on.
My will to give has gone and I am alone in this oppressing world.
Demons from the past shall eat me alive at last.
My will to live is almost gone; there is no need to suffer anymore.
Lies inside my pitiful head are what I need to go (on).
My will to give has gone and I am alone in this oppressing world.
Demons from the past shall eat me alive at last.
Who took over my mind?
Who's controlling my head?
Who is in charge of my brain?
