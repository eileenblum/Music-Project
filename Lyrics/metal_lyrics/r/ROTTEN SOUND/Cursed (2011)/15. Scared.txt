Being scared is what keeps you alive
As there is nothing left after the chance to die
'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
'Cause your every breath
Is scared to death
