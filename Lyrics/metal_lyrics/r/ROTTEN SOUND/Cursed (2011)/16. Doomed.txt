Autopsy of our minds
Shows the moment we dies
Th point in our lives
When we dried from inside

Every piece pf potential
We were born with
Has been sucked dry
By the global fraud

Doomed, insane destructive society
Powered by the curses of humanity

We had to consume
To keep the system alive
We were forced to destroy
Until everything was gone

Doomed, insane destructive society
Powered by the curses of humanity
Doomed, insane curses of humanity

We accepted the rules and became slaves
When we ran through our micro-universe
The office spaces, our luxurious homes
Ate us from inside until it was time to collapse

Autopsy of out minds
Shows the moment we died
The point in our lives
When we dried from inside

Nobody was given
A chance to take a breath
Unaccepted Leftists
Were hated to death

Doomed, insane destructive society
Powered by the curses of humanity
Doomed, insane curses of humanity
