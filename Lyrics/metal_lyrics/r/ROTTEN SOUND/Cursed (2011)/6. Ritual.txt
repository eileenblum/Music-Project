You are all alone
Surrounded by your beauty
Your excellence in everything
In fulfilling all possible needs

Fueled by your social greed
Fueled by your social greed

Ensure that nobody gets ahead
Exceed more and more

Live to achieve all the targets
Of the social greed

Beneath all, hollow and vain
Solitude shall prevail

Salvation is the ritual!

You're all alone in this world
Surrounded by you vanity
Excellence of your existence
Is an illusion we can't see

Beneath all, hollow and vain
Solitude shall prevail
Salvation, redemption
by the ritual suicide
