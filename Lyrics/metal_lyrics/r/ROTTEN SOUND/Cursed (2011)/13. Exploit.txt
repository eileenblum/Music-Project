Live the greed
Make more than you spend
Cut down the resources used
Minimize your labour costs

Steal time from the poor
Pay the minimum wage
In the cheapest territories
On the starving continents

Dictate the living standards
Oppress the governments
To follow your business plan
Created to enslave

Exploit and dominate
Starve, steal and get rich
Remember to donate
In a sudden moment of guilt

The level of income
You have defined
Shall be enough
To live, feed and breed

Exploit and dominate
Starve, steal and get rich
Remember to donate
In a sudden moment of guilt
