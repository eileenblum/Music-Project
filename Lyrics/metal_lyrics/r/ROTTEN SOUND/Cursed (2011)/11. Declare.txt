The world
That nobody
Can not
Live without

The natural human behaviour
Is driven by violence and hateful thoughts
Towards the heretic cultures
To destroy their infidelity

Nations Shall declare
Wars on each others societies
Taking each other's lives
Killing to spread...

The world...
That
Nobody...
Can not..
Live without

Human nature is drawn easily
Into bloody competition
Winning comes before all values
We claim to follow gracefully
Competition is to be amplified
Into retribution
By mixing religion
With the need to compete

Nations and the people in them
Shall declare war on other communities
They take each other's lives
And kill the world
That nobody
Can
Not
Live
Without
