The crust that holds your innards is what you lean onIntestines inside are as hollow as the crust is thin Enjoy the emptiness of fake happinessBecome the rightful owner of the unnecessary Day by day you drift away from this realityEvery hour you lose some more of your self-esteem You keep yourselves busyBy serving your mastersSlaves of societyIgnoring reality Enjoy the emptiness of fake happinessBecome the rightful owner of the unnecessary To gain more materialTo improve exteriorTo strive for excellenceTo become superior Enjoy the emptiness of fake happiness Become the rightful owner of the unnecessary Day by day you drift away from this realityEvery hour you lose some more of your self-esteem Enjoy the emptiness of fake happiness
