Privileged ones have a possibility
To oppress and to dominate
Entitled ones have an opportunity

Exploit

Being in charge creates an illusion
Of superiority
Promoted have a delusion
Of right to distress the weak

Intoxicate!

Deteriorate!

Power is sex
Domination is lust
It makes them think
That they're better than us
Power is sex
Domination is lust
It makes them think
That they're better than us,
That they're better than us!
