Consumption is needed
By the holy system we live in
Need to buy new hollow things
Creates the demand
For an army of slaves

Fake ecology
By green economy

Everything is made of
Recycled materials
To be consumed again in the future

Beware of global warming
Make sure you recycle everything
Become proud and green
Clean conscience for system needs

Suffering and feeble
Planet we drain is to extinct
