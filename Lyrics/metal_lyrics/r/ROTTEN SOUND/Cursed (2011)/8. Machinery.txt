We have criminalized
Oppressive Slavery
People accept the social pressure
To work as voluntary corporate slaves

To be the ones with the lowest wages
Who can barely support themselves

We have glorified
Working endlessly
People are born to embrace
The daily pressure to work like machines

Machines...
Machines!

The egotism
of the ones in charge
Is making sure
That the less privileged ones will remain
To be the ones with the lowest wages
Who can barely support themselves

We have criminalized
Oppressive slavery
People are born to embrace
The daily pressure to work like machines
