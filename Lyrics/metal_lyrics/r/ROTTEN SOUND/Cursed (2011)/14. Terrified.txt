A painful awakening
Hurting like never before
How to process
The pressure and stress?
How to give everyone
More than they can take?

We are terrified to live
We are terrified to die

Every single failure
Takes us closer to catastrophe
Fighting bank is not an option
For the servants of "life"

Being a human
Is harder again
When we have just
Woken up another day

Nothing will save us
No one can help
Because we're the smallest
and sickest things alive

We are terrified to live
We are terrified to die

A painful awakening
Hurting like never before
How to process
The pressure and stress?
How to give everyone
More than they can take?

Humanity equals insanity
Creating more depravity
Leading us to the stupidity
Of infinite inhumanity
