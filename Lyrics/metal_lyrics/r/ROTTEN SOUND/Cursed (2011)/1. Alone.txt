No one is better than me,
Everyone is beneath my every deed,
All my scared Actions
Should Be claimed Divine

Winning Team
Takes It all alone

Competing is the key
Defeating the weak is the way
Destroy all obstacles
Exterminate all other forms of life

All My scared actions
should be claimed divine

Winning Team
takes it all alone

Victory for the sake wining
brutality for the joy of killing
Insanity to create fake sanity
Socially distorted individual
