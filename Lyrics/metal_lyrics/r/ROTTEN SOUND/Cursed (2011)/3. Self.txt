Who are these tiny people
That pass my life close by?
How minor and unnecessary
Has everyone else become?

This is my universe
This is my throne

Particles around
My existence only proves
My gravity has more influence
Than all the gods to whom you('ll ever) bow

This is my universe, This is my throne,
My existence is a blessing for this globe,
I am taking over this place by destruction of grace
I shall run over your meaningless trails of life

Become my follower
Or be my enemy,
Become my follower
Or be crushed â By my will
