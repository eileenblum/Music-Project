Addiction caused by the stress
Weakened by exhaustion

Most of us lose our independence
The unemployed become a total failure

Nothing is enough
Greed drives us to doom
Fear of recession
And how much per capita may drop

Addicted to selling the times of our lives
Forced to give ourselves away

Until we are
Ready to retire
And to realize we sold
Our lives too cheap

Everyone of us
Spends our prime time
By selling ourselves
To the companies, societies and greed

Addicted to selling the times of our lives
Forced to give ourselves away

Until we are
Ready to retire
And realise we sold
Our lives for too cheap

Dying of boredom
Unable to relax
After decades of slavery
We can't live peacefully

Or die gracefully
