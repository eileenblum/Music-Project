It's time of being sorry
Time to leave your money
Time to ask (for) forgiveness
Time to forget your life
Time to open your eyes
Time to wonder why
Time to feel the truth
It's time to be afraid
Afraid!
We wish to live long enough
To die a natural death
Before intestines start to melt
From the environment we live in
Fear of drinking
Fear of eating
Fear of breathing
Fear of living
We wish to see enough of this place
Before it falls apart
Storms caused by the pollution
Will take down the world of today
Fear of drinking
Fear of swimming
Fear of eating
Fear of tasting
Fear of breathing
Fear of smelling
Fear of living
Fear of being
Time of being sorry
Time to ask (for) forgiveness
Time to forget your life
Time to open your eyes
Time to leave clean profit
Too late to ask (for) forgiveness
Now it's the time to shut up and die
