We are born to earn, they are waiting us to serve
We will be part of the machines raising the GDP
Leader ruling our world are unable to learn
Social health, eating wellbeing to death
Insane leaders, insane rules
Invented system in the government
Slavery is pushed down our throats
Approved lies
Lies!
Living up to the social rule book, it gives your life away
Join this army of fools, retire in misery
Rules by our leaders (are) fed to us since we were born
This system is the only accepted way to live until we die
We are born to learn how to earn, they are waiting us to serve
We will be part of the machine raising the GDP
Leaders ruling our world are unable to learn
Social health, eating wellbeing to death
Insane leaders, insane rules
Invented system in the government
Slavery is pushed down our throats
Approved lies
Invented rules, invented leaders
Are fed to our minds since we were born
Until we die
Until we choke
Rules are being pushed
Down our throats
