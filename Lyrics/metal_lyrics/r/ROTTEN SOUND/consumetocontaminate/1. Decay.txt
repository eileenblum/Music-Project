You can own a gun for your protection
But you can't drink on the streets
You can shoot anyone passing through your yard
And it's unsafe to walk outside alone
Synthetic social safety
Of your mindless society
Will collapse one day
By corruption and decay
Fear makes people ready to server in wars
Against other fools praising other false gods
When your safety is endangered
Take your gun and make sure their safety is gone

Synthetic social safety
Of your mindless society
Collapses today
To save this historic day!
Leading you to subjective
Oppressive, offensive freedom
Turning you from a thinking being
Into ignorant obeying moron

You can own a gun for your protection
But you can't drink on the streets
You can shoot anyone passing through your yard
And it's unsafe to walk outside alone
Synthetic social safety
Of your mindless society
Will collapse one day
By corruption and decay
Fear makes people ready to server in wars
Against other fools praising other false gods
When your safety is endangered
Take your gun and make sure their safety is gone
