The shadow of a ruined planet
Reflection of the clouds of devastation

A mixed population
Brought up the devastation

Even the wings of grief
Aren't able to carry on

The silence
Of the polluted societies

Burned corpses...
Crunchy and black...

A mixed population
Brought up the devastation

The stench of rancid meat
Fills the air
The outer-space must take this planet
And renew its nature for the next tyranny

The silence
Of the polluted societies

Gods weren't the ones
Who created this fate

A mixed population
Brought up the devastation

Was it greediness, envy or intelligence?

The silence
Of the polluted societies
