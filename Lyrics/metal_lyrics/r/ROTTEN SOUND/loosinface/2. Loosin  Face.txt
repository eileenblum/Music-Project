I have lost my face
In front of all
The unpleasant phase
But still I must go through

Torn apart from me
Ripped away in different scenes

All alone I must now crawl
Through the muddy truth
The facts around make me grow
Teaching how to learn from faults

Torn apart from me
Ripped away in different scenes

I have lost my face
In front of all
The unpleasant phase
But still I must go through
