Progression of technology
A frightening process of our time
Much too fast
Enormously huge

Little of this, 
A small amount of that
I'm horrified as I wait it to be done
The big one, the merciless, the powerful

Saviour - the pieces of metal
Saviour - dreadful and cold
A pressure wave - the releaser of the gods
The pressure wave - the harvester of the technology

The urge to success in experiments
Is rising the blood pressure of the scientists
"Can I feel the forces beyond that trigger?"
A way to reduce the overpopulation

Saviour - the pieces of metal
Saviour - dreadful and cold
A pressure wave - the releaser of the gods
The pressure wave - the harvester of the technology

Progression of technology
A frightening process of our time
Much too fast
Enormously huge

The pressure wave gives relief
Takes everything with it
A warm breeze of toxic wind
Raging above all of our kind

Saviour - the pieces of metal
Saviour - dreadful and cold
A pressure wave - the releaser of the gods
The pressure wave - the harvester of the technology
