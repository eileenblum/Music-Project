A child is born
A child is born
The bred bastard
Reaction on nature gives the birth
Makes it solid, starts the life

Brain inside says: do whatever you want
Society, I won't agree
The law brings you down
Decree kills your soul

A child of an aristocrat wants to submit
The child who's able to think by himself
The abuse of a feeling individual
An independent child wants to feel his feelings

Brain inside says: do whatever you want
Society, I won't agree
The law brings you down
Decree kills your soul

You fucking dick!
You can't bring me down!
I want to mutilate your useless balls with my boots!
I'm a winner, a strong one, a child of nature!
