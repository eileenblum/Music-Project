You sold your worthless soul
A soul you couldn't support through
Through the minor phenomenon
The phenomenon you call your life

The fault
Unrequited existence
A cold
Efficient, depressive acceptance

Studying the informal sources with no doubt
A mental suicide with no hate or grief
I pity your substance
The substance with no reason to be

The fault
Unrequited existence
A cold
Efficient, depressive acceptance

"You even can't notice...
How worthless being you are...
When you float in the mainstream,
The empty faces in a faceless flow.
You study the informal sources...
With no doubt.
I pity your substance
The substance with no reason to be"

You sold your worthless soul
A soul you couldn't support through
Through the minor phenomenon
The phenomenon you call your life
