The words of wisdom
Intoxicating the people
Full of shit and lies
Raging lies of pain

Abuse, manslaughter, honor
Death for the government

Your controlled brain
Destroying your life
Black rain falls down
Everything's ruined beneath (it)

Abuse, manslaughter, honor
Death for the government

Bureaucracy
Bureaucracy

Who in the fuck created it?
You megalomaniac human being!
The black rains (are)
Ending your days

Abuse, manslaughter, honor
Death for the government

Bureaucracy
Bureaucracy
