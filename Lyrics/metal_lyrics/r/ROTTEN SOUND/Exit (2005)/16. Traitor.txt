[Music: Q / Lyrics: G]

Stealing from your family
Destroying your security
Safety of our well-being
Torn by your dishonesty

Traitor

Free education
Made with high taxation
Gives total equality
Full of possibilities

Traitor

[Bridge:]
Supporting black economy
Run by organized crime
Eating up the cornerstones
We have based our lives

[Repeat bridge]

Traitor

[Repeat 2nd verse]

Stealing from your family
Destroying your security
Safety of our well-being
Torn by your sickness and total dishonesty
