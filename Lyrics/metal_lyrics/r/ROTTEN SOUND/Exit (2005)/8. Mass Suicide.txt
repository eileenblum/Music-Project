[Music: Q, K  / Lyrics: G]

We all live in this sick world
We all give to its violent call
Insanity has driven us further
Towards this disgusting nightmare

[Chorus:]
Transportation eats the oxygen
Contaminated water is what we drink
Pollution, killing the plants we need
Mass suicide caused by the engineers

We all live in this dying world
We will witness its final fall
Caused by machines made to serve our needs
Destructive effects were not seen

[Chorus]

We all live in this sick world
We all give to its violent call
We all live in this dying world
We will witness its final fall
