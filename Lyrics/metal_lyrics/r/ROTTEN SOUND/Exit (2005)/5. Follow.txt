[Music: Q  / Lyrics: G]

We are rated by normality
One shall never stand out
Personalities are deflated
During the first days in school

Belong to society by following the rules
Belong, with no way to choose

Survive with all of the fools
Live a boring life through
Judging from other people
Ones that are judged in here too

Belong to society by following the rules
Belong to society with no way to choose
Belong to society by following the rules
