[Music: Q / Lyrics: G]

Cars are blown apart and people are torn
Because of the war with the V.S.A.
Horrific events close to our homes
People get killed when they step outside

Casualties of the war

Guilty of living in the western world
Judged by an enemy with no humanity
Basing their hate on the religion
Oppression by subordination

Enemies with no gun

Terror among people walking on the streets
Horror within, everyone who thought they are safe

Casualties of the war

Objects of bombings with no reason to be killed
Victims of wars without hostile thoughts

Enemies with no gun
With no gun

Cars are blown apart and people are torn
Bodies flying in the air, pieces falling everywhere
Horrific events close to our homes
Because of the war against Violent States:

Victims of the secret war,
Enemy with no gun
Objects of the bombings
With no reason to be killed
Casualties of these wars,
Enemies with no guns
Casualties of these wars,
Without any hostile thoughts
