[Music: Q, T, K / Lyrics: G]

Evil needs, divine seeds, in your sick mind
Looking for the god to obey
Belief over deceivers, driving their own needs
Seeking for the one that saves

Leaders taking over their followers

Too weak to think rationally
Thoughts of living forever
Living your life in the lies of the priests
Promising eternity and bliss

Leaders taking over their followers
For their salvation needs

Leaders taking over their followers
For their salvation needs
Generic exploitations
Of weak human beings
Trust your soul to promised after-life
And sure redemption
Deceit made by preachers
Declaring a fake salvation

Now you all are dead, time to face truth
No heaven, no hell, nowhere to exist or dwell
You're turning into mud and dust, fertilizing our soil
Like an enormous pile of human shit in foil
