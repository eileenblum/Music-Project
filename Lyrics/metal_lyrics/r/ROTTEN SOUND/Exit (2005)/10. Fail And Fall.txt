[Music: T / Lyrics: G]

Targets are set at maximum, sacrifices are made to run
Achievements are required to become exceptional

Investing in people, insisting in perfection
For the targets of us all we will fail and fall

Goals are checked annually,
Sense is forgotten mutually
Competence is checked again
Like one year ago, nothing has changed
