[Music: Q / Lyrics: G]

Freedom of speech cannot be heard
Freedom of thoughts in our heads
No one can keep our privacy
No one can help us to escape

We all live in this sickness, it stinks, but no complaints
Sucking our nature dry, creating a void and misery
Illusion of democracy chewed and swallowed easily
Twisted society has tricked all of us into this madness

Freedom of kids living on the streets
Freedom of men working on the fields
No one can take that away from them
No one, except for the western cancer

Turning them into arrogant bastards,
Feeding the greed of their invented needs
Disease of violence and ignorance
Killing the innocence
