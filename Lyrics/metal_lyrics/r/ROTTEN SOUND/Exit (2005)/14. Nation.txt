[Music: Q, K / Lyrics: G]

Unfair election, everyone was forced to choose you
Fear was spread by the executions of antagonists

Fake nation

Corruption while calculating the final results
Major share of the given votes made stability

Blinded by the dominion, drunken from the given throne
You make rules to verify that people shall obey
Reign by tyranny, crawling nationality
People are turning into disinterested slugs

Fake nation

Dominion... Corruption... Disintegration
[2x] Your nation will fall
