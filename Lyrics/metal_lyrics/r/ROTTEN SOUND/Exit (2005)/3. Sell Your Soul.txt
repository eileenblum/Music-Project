[Music: T / Lyrics: G]

Gaining more property
For your social value
Losing inner self
Not needed to succeed
Urge to get filthy rich
With inhuman deeds
Taken from your dull life
That does not exist anymore

[2x] Sell your soul and die alone

Gathering money for your safety
And to increase your assets
Giving no help
To the underprivileged
Joy was not gained
Only the hollow pain
Being afraid of losing
Your stolen wealth to the thieves

[4x] Sell your soul and die alone
