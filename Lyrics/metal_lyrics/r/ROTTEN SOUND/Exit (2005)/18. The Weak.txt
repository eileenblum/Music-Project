[Music: Q / Lyrics: G]

Diversity enriches this world
It brings more depth to our lives
Differences in the cultures around
Should not be suppressed away

Purifying the weak genes,
Insanity of the rich
They'll pass forward a feeble mind
And a genetic disease

Races are here to stay

Mental diseases are like a plague
The sickness spreads around
They won't even see what they have done
When madness is normality

Races are here to stay

[Chorus]
Nazis were too weak to see
Richness of colours of skins
Today's ways to purify
Is close to their main themes

Races are here to stay

Purification of genes
Insanity of the rich
They'll pass forward a feeble mind
And a genetic disease

[Chorus]

[4x:]
There's only one colour,
The colour of human skin
Different shades of darkness
Are frightening only the weak
