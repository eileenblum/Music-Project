[Music: Q  / Lyrics: G]

They were built during the cold war
To keep the balance of fear
Some of the warheads have been disabled
Some of them just got too old

But there's still enough of them
To destroy this evil place
To wipe away all this sickness
Created by human race
Terrorists have them in their hands
Able to revive the blame again
The balance can be destroyed
By a well planned hostile blast

[Chorus:]
Total havoc rises above us
Flames of hell are taking control
Infernal fire burns everywhere
Taking down all signs of life

You're blinded by the flash
Ears were torn in the aftermath
Praise the sun above you
For the very last time
Prepare for the winter
It shall reap the survivors
It will clean up this place
From this malicious race

[Chorus]
