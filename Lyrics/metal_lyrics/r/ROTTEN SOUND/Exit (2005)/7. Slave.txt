[Music: Q, K / Lyrics: G]

[Chorus:]
Enslaved by society chosen by your free will
Enslaved by democracy and fake equality
Enslaved by society run by your energy
Enslaved by acceptance and your ignorance

Improving social status
Through your slavery and greed
Seeking new ways to gain more
Credibility with misery

Doing as much as you can
To create envy among colleagues
Slavery supports the status
You call your identity

[Chorus]

Working insanely to fulfil
Material slavery
Feeding the needs of your greed
By trying to buy your bliss

Ownership of your property
Is generating ecstasy
Freedom of insane consumption,

Disease of a dying western world

Enslaved
