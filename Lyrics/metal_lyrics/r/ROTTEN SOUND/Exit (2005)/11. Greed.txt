[Music: Q / Lyrics: G]

Low humanity, earning more property
No efforts to help the poverty

[Chorus:]
Greed takes over and kills all of thee
Going lower in morality

Masses will suffer, starve and suffocate
Oppress the poor, the wealthy don't care

[Chorus]

Starving citizens earning taxes for the entitled

[Repeat 1st verse]

[Chorus]

[Repeat 2nd verse]
