An old man is mugged on a shiny day, people are passing by
They all just watch away
Most of them feel sick, perverts are getting some kicks
Not a soul is giving a hand, none of the feel involved
Too afraid to go in between, too busy to stop the man bleed
Ignoring humanity, saving it for some future activity
Helping means responsibility, It lives from pain
When you are afraid hero is tied deep inside
Too afraid to go in between, too busy to stop the man bleed
Ignoring humanity, saving it for some future activity
Saving it for some future activity
In the deepest caves of your mind you feel like an abused child
Hiding, hiding insanely getting more and more afraid
An old man is mugged on a shiny day, people are passing by
They all just watch away
Most of them feel sick, perverts are getting some kicks
Not a soul is giving a hand, none of the feel involved
Too afraid to go in between, too busy to stop the man bleed
Ignoring humanity, saving it for some future activity
Too afraid to go in between, too busy to stop the man bleed
Ignoring humanity, saving it for some future activity
Saving it for some future activity - Saving it for some future activity
