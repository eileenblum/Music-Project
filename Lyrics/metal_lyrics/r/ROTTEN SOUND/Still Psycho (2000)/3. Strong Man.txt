An arrogant bastard you are, without value you lie your life
Your spineless core is in a fragile crust
Strongman - Moron
The acts of violence you share can not be reasonably explained!
Strongman - Moron
You beat and get beat again!
Days are passing, weeks are going by, more numb and idiolent you will be
People around are changing every day, leading into being alone and isolated
Still you will beat to gain more respect, adored you will be
But some day the bastards around will make you suffer like you do it today
Strongman - Moron
You beat and get beat again!
Days are passing, weeks are going by, more numb and idiolent you will be
People around are changing every day, leading into being alone and isolated
