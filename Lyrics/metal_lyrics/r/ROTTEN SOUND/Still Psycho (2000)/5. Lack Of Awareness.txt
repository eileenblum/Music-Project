Your life's so neat, no fear of vile days
Energy is spent completely to serve only basic needs
Illusion of supremacy, ruptured by a trivial event
Oter forms of life could be just arond the corner
Different dimensions might still exist in your own house
A story written by another of your kind
Is experienced without a single chew from your mind
Understanding the facts, getting behind the scene
Realizing and feeling (the) utter certainty
When your head is a servant the body shall follow
Values are taken completely from outside
Your life's so neat, no fear of vile days
Energy is spent completely to serve only basic needs
Illusion of supremacy, ruptured by a trivial event
Without a single chew from your mind
Understanding the facts, getting behind the scene
Realizing and feeling (the) utter certainty
Understanding the facts, getting behind the scene
Realizing and feeling (the) utter certainty
