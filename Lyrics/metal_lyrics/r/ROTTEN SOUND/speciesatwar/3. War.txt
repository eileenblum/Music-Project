Scorched by wrath
Razed through divinity
Blood was to be spilled
Guts were to be thrown

Blessed, sacred wars
Insanity through gods
Alone in the total darkness
You will wander in the army of fools

Divinity
Drove you insane
Subjective truth
Burned your mind

Peaceful villages wish they were not born
Under the blade of the privileged swords

The ruthless masses
Glow through the faith and glory

Their fearless loath
Will begin to grow an oath

Blessed by the wise-men
Summoning their powers
Soldiers of fortune show how they slayed

Divinity
Drove to berserk
Imbecile sheep
Burned the earth

Blessed, sacred wars
Insanity through gods
Alone in the total darkness
You will wander in the army of fools
