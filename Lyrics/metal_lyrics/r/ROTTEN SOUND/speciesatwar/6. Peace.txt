After every conflict the winner is reclaimed
Ruthless men who were insanely brave
Nobody won anything
Than masses of bitterness and insanity

It's time for peace
It's time to forgive

Slain, humiliated losers
Thank their conquerors

For saving the precious lives
For raping their priceless wives

It's time for peace, it's time to forgive
But neither of the sides will ever forget
It's time for peace, it's time to forget
The traumatized ones will never be able to forgive

The inglorious casualites of war
Were doomed to bleed to death

In the eyes of the winners
Terrors and horrors of war

It's time for peace, it's time to forgive
But neither of the sides will ever forget
It's time for peace, it's time to forget
The traumatized ones will never forgive
