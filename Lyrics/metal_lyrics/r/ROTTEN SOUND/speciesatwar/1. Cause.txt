Every single time
An empire went wild
Your urge to believe
Increased drastically

Causes to justify blood
Deeds to cause more grudge
Terror and misery

There was no light or no other side
The chosen gods did never prevail
There is no light and no other god
The chosen one will never be saved

The bloody history
Religious glory
Your minds are flooded
By wonders and frauds

There was no light or no other side
The chosen gods did never prevail
There is no light and no other god
The chosen one will never be saved

Every single time
An empire went wild
Your urge to believe
Increased drastically

Causes to justify blood
Deeds to cause more grudge
Terror and misery
Causes of misery
