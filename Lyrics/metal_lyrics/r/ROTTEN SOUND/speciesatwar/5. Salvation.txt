Saved from the fears of dying
Relieved by someone divine
Within the holy ghosts and spirits
Wonders the eternal serpent of lies

Salvation from the reality
Takes away your mortality
Salvation ensures the false relief
To all of you useless slaves
Until the starving maggots 
Feast on your useless bodies

Weakness of mind
Futility of life
Pushes you to seek
For the eternity
However you live
Whatever makes you die
Makes no mistake
There is no after-life
Today is the day
Tomorrow is too late
As the freight train of fate
Might take you away
