Enslavement, forced to believe in him
Everyone shall begin to praise the mystery
People are told to live gracefully
Before it's too late to be saved from the humanity

Solving the problem that does not exist
There is no way to live eternally
There is no such thing, there never will be
Anything to rely on your misery

Living your days
Killing the time
Trusting a fraud
Killing the days
Losing your time to live
Trusting someone
Who lies to your face

Enslavement, forced to believe
Everyone shall begin to praise
Someone told the right way to live
Before it's too late to be saved

Living your days
Killing the time
Trusting a fraud
Killing the days
Losing your time to live
Trusting someone
Who lies to your face

Defining the issues that shall never be
Derived from your desperate misery

There is no such thing, there never will be
There is no way to live eternally

Living your days
Killing the time
Trusting someone
Who lies to your face

Living your days
Killing the time
Trusting a fraud
Killing the days
Losing your time to live
Trusting someone
Who lies straight to your face
