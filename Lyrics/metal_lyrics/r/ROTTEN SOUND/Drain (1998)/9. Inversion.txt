[Lyrics: Jorma, Keijo]

Without thoughts you rise your fist
That gets me really pissed
One black man, twenty white men
Beat him just for being black

What if you wake up...
Tomorrow being black?
Are you gonna kill yourself?
Or change your policy?

You got to be bold, that's what you have been told!
Everything you do as your leader tells
If you don't beat, you will get beat
When you beat, it grows lots of hate

What if you wake up...
Tomorrow being black?
Are you gonna kill yourself?
Or change the racial policy?
Y(e)ah!

Without thoughts you rise your fist
That gets me really pissed
One black man, twenty white men
Beat him just for being black
Thrash!

You got to be bold, that's what you have been told!
Everything you do as your leader tells
If you don't beat, you will get beat
When you beat, it grows lots of hate

What if you wake up...
Tomorrow being black?
Are you gonna kill yourself?
Or change your policy?
