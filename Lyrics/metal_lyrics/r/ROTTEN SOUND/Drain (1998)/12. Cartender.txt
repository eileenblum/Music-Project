[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Jorma, Keijo]

One big whiskey bottle in your hand
Soon it will run into your head
And what did you do, you fucking nerd
You took your car and made someone dead

Cartender -
ambassador of death
Cartender -
human insect

Why don't you express...
Your repressed mind with something sane
The combination you use today
Is going to turn against itself

Cartender -
cruel killer
Cartender -
you fill me with anger

Here's my decent hint
If care a thing about anything
You should think of others too
And not just be such a fool
Iiiaaaai!

[lead: Juha]

One big whiskey bottle in your hand
Soon it will run into your head
And what did you do, you fucking nerd
You took your car and made someone dead

Cartender -
ambassador of death
Cartender -
human insect
Cartender -
cruel killer
Cartender -
you fill me with anger
