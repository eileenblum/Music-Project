[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Jorma, Keijo]

Like they wear you wear
Like they think to do you do
Like they act you act
Like they don't think you don't think
Personality, you don't have single one
Everything in your head is gone
Follow the big business
And fall into the emptiness

Stop not to think
The only way to not is sink
Do it yourself
You don't need anybody's help

Personality, you don't have single one
Everything in your head is gone
Follow the big business
And fall into the emptiness

Stop not to think
The only way to not is sink
Do it yourself
You don't need anybody's help
