[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Jorma, Keijo]

You bought a one way ticket to Brazil
Oh, you wanna go in there and fuck!
You tiny tool seeks for tiny little boys and girls
To fill up your sick little joys

Dirty bucks...
Crowns full of stains...

I wish you get caught
A trip to hell you should have bought
A death sentence should be the consequence
But how to protect then all the little worms?

You abuse, humilate, violate
Violate under aged lads
You humilate, violate and escape
With the dirty currency of our society

You bought a one way ticket to Brazil
Oh, you wanna go in there and fuck!
You tiny tool seeks for tiny little boys and girls
To fill up your sick little joys

Dirty bucks...
Crowns full of stains...
