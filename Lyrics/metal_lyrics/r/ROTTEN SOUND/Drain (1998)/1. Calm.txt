[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Keijo]

Lost in a maze
The mess, the bitter task
No way to praise the face
The head with no sense

Calmness equals emptiness!

Nonsense was expressed
Unclear, unfocused
Never to feel the same pain
In my own personal hate!

Calmness Equals Emptiness!

Just useless rage within
Unbound terror while sleeping
Unrequited feelings for being sane
A loveless, bitter, messy cave
Messy cave!
Nonsense was expressed
Unclear, unfocused
Never to feel the same pain
In my own hate!

Why am I so still?
How shall the days to come be performed?
Why the calmness?
Why not just urge to void and disaster?

Lost in a maze
The mess, the bitter task
No way to praise the face
The head with no sense
