[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Jorma, Keijo]

You use your traditional mind
Which can not see another kind
A selfish one-way road
That's a serious thing I have to remind

All you feel is hate
You live for your rage

One way system in your mind
That's the thing we don't like
Can't you see you're not alone
Your brain is still in cradle

All you feel is hate
You live for your rage

[lead: Juha]

Is there anything we can make...
Like put there some fucking sake?
We'd like to see you sane
No fucking way some things can't changed!

All you feel is hate
You live for your rage
