[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Jorma, Keijo]

You put that shit into your veins
To end up your private mortal pains
It will leave in you some stains
No brain, no face and no grace

Or did you really have them at all?
Did you leave them at a birth stall?
I despise you and the shit you take
And all of the mistakes you have ever made!

Give all of us a change
And stop taking that fucking nonsense
It will leave in you some stains
Some brain, some face but still no grace

Or did you really have them at all?
Did you leave them at a birth stall?
I despise you and the shit you take
And all of the mistakes you have ever made!

The loser inside of
Of your container
Grabbing tighter
Chemicals take over
(Finding the perfect way to grab tighter
Your soul is going to be internally swollen)
