[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Keijo]

No one shall leave me alone
Not a single person should break me apart
I shall be the hardest shell
I, myself and me are not fragile

None of them around...
Alone at last!
None of the worshipping losers...
Alone at last!

No-one, no-one with me
No-one can not live without me
I will never be the same
Without someone who is really afraid

None of them around...
Alone at last!
None of the worshipping losers...
Alone at last!

Ego, an internal way to be great
I believe in you, but you won't get in me!
Total loss of caring around
Alone, at last I am an individual!

[lead: Juha]

Yeah!
Not a person who might care...
Alone at last!
I will survive all alone...
Alone - and lost!
