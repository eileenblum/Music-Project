[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Keijo]

Sounds from outside
Wandering from the concrete walls
Roaming until they're all dead
And I am still awake

Seems so quiet
Feels so unsilent

Bouncing around
Roaming unbound
Machinery a'la urban dream
The juice of materiality

Seems so quiet
Feels yet so unsilent

Electricity is spent
Lifeless, but able to breed
Enabling the surge
The endless, bottomless drain
The smell of gas in the air
Feeding the polluting needs

One can's scream when being surrounded by darkness
While being kept in the depths

Machinery a'la urban dream
The juice of materiality

One can's scream when being surrounded by darkness
While being kept in the depths

Sounds from outside
Wandering from the concrete walls
Roaming until they're all dead
And I am still awake

Seems so quiet
Feels so unsilent
