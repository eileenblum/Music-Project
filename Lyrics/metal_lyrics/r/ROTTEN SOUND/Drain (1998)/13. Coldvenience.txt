[Music: Mika, Rotten Sound]
[Lyrics: Keijo]

One individual lies on a floor of an empty room
In an apartment stuffed with functionality and a lonesome fool!
A midget size fridge full of novelties for oral needs
Gorgeous little things to rip off the weakest of us all!
The attic above so heavy that it forces down the roof
Inhalation made less possible by the walls closing by
Noises coming far from below unattaching everything but a soul:
The innermost, claimed to be divine, an object full of faults

A hope for nobody to see
The recession of normality
Loaded with Hotel-TV
Dark thoughts and mortality

Voluntary way
To drive you less sane
Unexpected reactions
From energetic persons

One individual lies on a floor of an empty room
In an apartment stuffed with functionality and a lonesome fool!
A midget size fridge full of novelties for oral needs
Gorgeous little things to rip off the weakest of us all!

A hope for nobody to see
The recession of normality
Loaded with Hotel-TV
Dark thoughts and mortality

Voluntary way
To drive you less sane
Unexpected reactions
From energetic persons
Mostly weak, ruined and ruptured
mental abilities
Unexpected reactions
From dull persons
