Uuuaah!
Join the collective, the holy family
Isolation from individuality
Learn the book, obey the rules
Manipulated like the other fools

The jesus fucking christ:
The super satan full of lies

You are the lambs,
Inhale the light
No more free speech...
In the nearest sight
Believe the lies...
Or perish in hell
And from the heaven's gates
You are expelled

The jesus fucking christ:
The super satan full of lies

Holy cross, the symbol of fear
Holy spirit, in front of you appears
Holy book, literally full of crap
Holy man: kill yourself or wake up!
Holy cross, the symbol of fear
Holy spirit, in front of you appears
Holy book, literally full of crap
Holy man: kill yourself or wake up!

Join the collective, the holy family
Isolation from individuality
Learn the book, obey the rules
Manipulated like the other fools

The jesus fucking christ:
The super satan full of lies
