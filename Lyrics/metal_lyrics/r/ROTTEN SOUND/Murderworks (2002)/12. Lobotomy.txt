[M: Q, ROTTEN SOUND]
[L: G]

So many years of education, millions of hours are spent to learn
A clear vision is reflected, the perfect future, the ignorant bliss

We are born to sell
The best time to create
Will to live is sucked efficiently
By the 8 hours of lobotomy

Slaves all we are, free will of ours will fall
Become as an insignificant part, a tiny wheel of the society

We are born to sell the best time to create
Will to live is sucked efficiently by the 8 hours of lobotomy

By the 8 hours of lobotomy

Five days a week we sell our time
Lobotomy by free will to gain a decent life
We are born to sell time to create
Will to live is lost by the cost of sanity

So many years of education
Millions of hours are spent to learn
A clear vision is reflected
The perfect future, the ignorant bliss

We are born to sell
The best time to create
Will to live is sucked efficiently
By the 8 hours of lobotomy
