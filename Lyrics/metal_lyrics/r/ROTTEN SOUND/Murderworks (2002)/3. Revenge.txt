[M: Q, ROTTEN SOUND]
[L: G]

You?re entitled to kill for your government
You need to gain glory by punishing innocent
No understanding of the deeds
No mercy in the acts of violence

Murder works
For a while

Searching for right victim named as an enemy
The enemy has to do the same
Both of you have the same assignment:
Destroy the faceless evil with no name

Murder works
For a while,
But it leaves
Stains behind

Declaration of
Mass madness
Believe the reasons
Prepare to kill
Murder
In the name of the gods
Revenge
To get salvation

You?re entitled to kill by your government
You need to gain glory by punishing innocent
No understanding of the consequences
No mercy in the acts of violence

Murder works
For a while,
But it leaves
Stains behind
