[M: Q, ROTTEN SOUND]
[L: G, Jorma]

Corporation waits
The retirement

Sucked dry
Until the day we die

They will squeeze
Every single drop

Sucked dry
Until the day we die

More to do with less people
No complains are accepted
They are turning us insane
Take my advice and run away

Away

Full capacity has been reached
Our resources are all totally used until we are all deceased

Our minds are sucked completely dry
Get unemployed or prepare to kiss all of us goodbye

More to do with less people
No complains are accepted
They are turning us insane
Take my advice and run away
