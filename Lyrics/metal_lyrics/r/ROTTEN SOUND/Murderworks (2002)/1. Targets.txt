[M: Q, ROTTEN SOUND]
[L: G]

Targets!

Dying inside
Drying with mindless cry
Finding a brand new ?life?
By rejecting the urge to fly

Flying by own free will
Going with the internal wind
Facing some problems:
The unseen cracks, the visible gloom

Numb creative mind
Dull social life
No achievements
No plan to meet the targets

Targets!

How to find a new key
When the previous have gone bad?
I?m locked from inside

Externally lost, internally chaos

Flying by own free will
Going with the internal wind
Facing some problems:
The unseen cracks, the visible gloom

Numb creative mind
Dull social life
No achievements
No plan to meet the targets

Targets!
