[M: Q, ROTTEN SOUND]
[L: G]

Among all of us they?re sleeping still
Waiting for the right moment to take over the fertile ground around
Some are trying to resist but none can refuse
They?ll make you feel strong they?ll be the source of awesome powers

Seeds of hate
Source of human plants
Just add some water daily
To get them up nicely

Be aware of the decades to come
One of these years the change will take place
One of these moments the flick of insanity is found
Couple of these weeks we?ll be totally blackened

Seeds of hate
Source of human plants
Just add some water daily
To get them up nicely
Seeds of hate
Source of human plants
Just add some water daily
To get them up nicely

One of those hours of violence
Those hours will make you snap
Into fragile parts to be snapped again
Those parts will be seeded around

Seeds of hate

Among all of us they?re sleeping still
Waiting for the right moment to take over the fertile ground around
Some are trying to resist but none can refuse
They?ll make you feel strong they?ll be the source of awesome powers

Seeds of hate
Source of human plants
Just add some water daily
To get them up nicely
Seeds of hate
Source of human plants
Just add some water daily
To get them up nicely
