[M: Q, ROTTEN SOUND]
[L: G, H]

I feel confident, everything is clear
Deed was justified, Nothing to fear
I'm an outlaw now, there's nowhere to go
But I do not fear to be captured
Now we are even with the past shit
The bubbles under will not erupt
Too late to regret, it is done now
Hands in dirt, head just a mess

The agony and pain
Helps to clear my head
This decision
Was easier than ever

I feel rational, this was meant to be
But all this filth just makes it so unreal
Someone needs to clean up this mess
Causing my head to explode (to explode)
I'm all alone, can't tell to anyone
But the voices in me are just as real
This burden is getting too heavy to cope
It's time to end the pain, and let myself go

The agony and pain
Helps to clear my head
This decision
Was easier than ever before

Sudden moment flicks before my eyes
What is done did not make everything allright
Loud and clear, voices in my head
Have taken total control in me

I feel confident, everything is clear
Deed was justified, Nothing to fear
I'm an outlaw now, there's no way out
But I do not fear to be captured
I feel rational, this was meant to be
But all this filth just makes it so unreal
Someone needs to clean up this mess
Causing my head to explode (to explode)

The agony and pain
Helps to clear my head
This decision
Was easier than ever

Sudden moment flicks before my eyes
What is done did not make everything right
Loud and clear, voices in my head
Have taken total control in me
