Genetic explosion of life
A microscopical cell get stitched
Boiling, oozing, suffering
Raping of a cell, denying the pleasure

We travel through the nerves
We make a journey inside of the sense

The earthly joy vanishes under these eyes
The life, a realistic judgement for these fools

We travel through the nerves
We make a journey inside of the sense
