Fully alerted,
Totally discalm:
I experience and see...
My minority

Am I an influence to the powerful force
Around my minority?

It's too late...
To understand...
The disappearance of...
Painless days

I despise, 
I worship, 
I reinforce, 
I live and disdain

Inclining the throes by destroying the roses of hope
From the hands of despair

A painful...
Quest
The eternal burden...
On my chest
