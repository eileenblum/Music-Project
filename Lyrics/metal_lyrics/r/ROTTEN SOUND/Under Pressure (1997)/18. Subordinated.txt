You don't want to kill,
But they will beat you...
If you don't want to shoot
A child, a woman, an old man

You can't use your head
You only can obey...
The orders coming from the faceless...
Superiors with no feelings

You don't want to kill,
But they will beat you...
If you don't want to shoot
A child, a woman, an old man
