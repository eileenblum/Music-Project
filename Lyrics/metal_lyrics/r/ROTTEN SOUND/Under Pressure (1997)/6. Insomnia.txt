Grief has been faced
Blood should have been tasted
Feelings were embraced...
When we awakened

For how long...
Have we been framed in a shell?
For how long?
The stopped time around us shall tell!

The sleep was slept
All sorrows were kept
Cries were wept
Still sensing the depth

For how long
Have we been framed in a shell?
For how long?
The stopped time around us shall tell!

Embodiment of fear
Suddenly so clear
Entombment by tears...
During these years

For how long
Have we been framed in a shell?
For how long?
The stopped time around us shall tell!
