A man from out there
Won't brag with materiality
The sparkling wine
Is not to be found from his mouth

Renewer loves everyone
Renewer improves everything
Renewer, the man of labour
The need to give - inside of his soul

He takes the intelligence
Into his hands
As he sticks a fork in your brain
He stabs a knife inside of your head
Awakens the idea of perfect existence

Renewer loves everyone
Renewer improves everything
Renewer, the man of labour
The need to give - inside of his soul

He doesn't get paid from this work
Intuition makes him do what he does
Experience drives him into these deeds
An ability to give is what he needs

A man from out there
Won't brag with materiality
The sparkling wine
Is not to be found from his mouth

Intelligence:
In the head of a renewer
The change,
The achievement, the reality
