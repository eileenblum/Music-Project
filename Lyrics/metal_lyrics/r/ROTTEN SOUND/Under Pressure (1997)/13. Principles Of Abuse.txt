Forced obedience of dominant authorities
Mockery of civilized ordinances
Banning of free opinions
Among the minor classes of the societies

Ways to neglect the humanity
Things that despise individuality
Disdain of the democracy
Rejecting the principles of equality

No consideration of even-handed justice
On contradictions preferred from below
All motions interpreted as revolting actions
Against their ideal way of living in a society

Ways to neglect the humanity
Things that despise individuality
Disdain of the democracy
Rejecting the principles of equality

Insubordination, unrecognition
Resisted by suppressive powers from above
An unseen terrorization by the policy and corruption
Abuse of citizens who recognize the unfair actions

Ways to neglect the humanity
Things that despise individuality
Disdain of the democracy
Rejecting the principles of equality
