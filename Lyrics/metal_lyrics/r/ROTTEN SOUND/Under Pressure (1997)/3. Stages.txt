All your opportunities..
Filled with obligations
The difficult settlements...
With b(l)inding commitments

Insurance...
By a ceremonial play on a stage
Insurance...
By a right jump in the right place

Youâre deceived by a fraud...
Instructed how not to get caught
You act like a frog...
Taught how to leap back and forth

Insurance...
By a ceremonial play on a stage
Insurance...
By a right jump in the right place

The words of subordinative bastards:
"Hierarchy in the policy,
And the structure you are in...
Are efficient only the way...
We dress, think and obey"

The hard decisions...
In serious occasions
Makes them become as stages
Of yourself-denying phases

Insurance...
By a ceremonial play on a stage
Insurance...
By a right jump in the right place
