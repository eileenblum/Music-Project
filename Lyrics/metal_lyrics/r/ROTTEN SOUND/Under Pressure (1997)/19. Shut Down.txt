You donât realize it at all
That you are just one fucking fool
Open your mind, thatâs the tool
To fight the enemy so cruel

Your mind, itâs closed
Itâs locked and the key is thrown away
Open it and realize
Something must be done

Day by day while you think
You start to find the systems missing link
It wonât change this way
Until your minds have changed

Your mind, itâs closed
Itâs locked and the key is thrown away
Open it and realize
Something must be done

Itâs not just the human race
Itâs this whole fucking place
Universal soldiers donât fight with their arms
They use their minds and hearts

Your mind, itâs closed
Itâs locked and the key is thrown away
Open it and realize
Something must be done

Itâs not just the human race
Itâs this whole fucking place
Universal soldiers donât fight with their arms
They use their minds and hearts

They use their minds and hearts...

They use their minds and hearts...

They use their minds and hearts...

They use their minds and hearts...
