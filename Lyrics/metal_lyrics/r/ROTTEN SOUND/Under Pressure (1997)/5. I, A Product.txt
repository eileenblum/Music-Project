Once I was so warm
The grass in mouth tasted good
The feelings of pleasure
Filled my mind

The shelves of all grocery shops
Are full of us
Glowing in the fancy packs
Chewed in the mouths of human rats

You take me in your car
What a fuck are you doing?
You fucking shit!
You just fooled and pissed me off

The shelves of all grocery shops
Are full of us
Glowing in the fancy packs
Chewed in the mouths of human rats

I, a soul of an innocent being
I tell you this, you greedy thing
I shall eat your guts and soul
Like the grass that was in my mouth

Once I was so warm
The grass in mouth tasted good
The feelings of pleasure
Filled my mind

The shelves of all grocery shops
Are full of us
Glowing in the fancy packs
Chewed in the mouths of human rats
