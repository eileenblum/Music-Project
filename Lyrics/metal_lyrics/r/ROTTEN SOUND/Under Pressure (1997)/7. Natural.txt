I am an oarless boat
In the lake of obscurity
With no destiny I float
From the misery into unknown

Naturally, fighting the waves I face
Unconsciously towards the feelings I taste

Iâm a leaf of an autumn tree
Born to give an ability to live
Unable to resist the day of the truth
The day Iâm too weak to hang on

I am the snow in the sky
Inside the clouds condensed from the lies
The humidity with no hope
As the day of falling is coming so close

Naturally, fighting the waves I face
Unconsciously towards the feelings I taste

Iâm a leaf of an autumn tree
Born to give an ability to live
Unable to resist the day of the truth
The day Iâm too weak to hang on

I am an oarless boat
In the lake of obscurity
With no destiny I float
From the misery into unknown

Natural ways
Iâm forced to evaporate
Numbered are my days
And all alone I must then go

Naturally, fighting the waves I face
Unconsciously towards the feelings I taste
Unnaturally, resisting the freezing winds from the sea
No match against the nature I encounter and feel
