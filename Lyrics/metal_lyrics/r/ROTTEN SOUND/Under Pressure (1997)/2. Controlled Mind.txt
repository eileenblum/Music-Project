His eyes are standing still
With lies his brains will fill
He does like he is told
His brains are on the hold

Controlled mind

Your mind is filled with hate
And hate breeds useless rage
You think you are great
When you have lost your fate

Controlled mind

Controlled human mind
Greatest weapon of all mankind
Free human mind
Greatest thing in all mankind

Controlled mind

Your mind is filled with hate
And hate breeds useless rage
You think you are great
When you have lost your fate

Controlled mind

Controlled human mind
Greatest weapon of all mankind
Free human mind
Greatest thing in all mankind
