âWhy do we fucking pay?
Weâre loosing the luxuries...
We should have gained...
With the profit we have earned!â

Unsocial thoughts from the privileged ones
The ones that will survive...
Noticeable number of socially weak
Are considered to live like bums

âWhere do we get food today?
Those assholes at the parliamentary
Have decided to cut the benefits
Our ancestors earned yesterdayâ

Macro-social thoughts from an outcast
The cast that just complains...
Excessive loads of politicians
Are said to be the responsible ones

âHow can we pay our debts?
When we canât rise the taxing rates
Or to give away less benefits
Nor to lower our own salariesâ

âWhy do we fucking pay?
Weâre loosing the luxuries...
We should have gained...
With the profit we have earned!â

Purely calculative thoughts by the highest ones
The ones who must decide...
Outstanding pressure from all citizens
Because of the fact they all shall deify

Why do we fucking pay?

Why do we fucking pay?
