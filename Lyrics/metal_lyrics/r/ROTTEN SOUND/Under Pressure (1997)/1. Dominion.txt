All civilizations have found their creators
Some unnatural phenomenons
No physical evidence of their existence
Only psychological addiction

Is this casual form we're living in
Just a bus shift into eternity?
You must not perform any sins
Or it's changed into infernality

For some individuals it's hard to understand
There is not, nor is going to be any specific plan
There always must be a greater dominator
These sheep seem to need a fairy-tale creator

How to think without brains?
After you've taken your last breath?
A life based on a lie
A lie based on a life
Life after death

Dominion!

For some individuals it's hard to understand
There is not, nor is going to be any specific plan
There always must be a greater dominator
These sheep seem to need a fairy-tale creator

For some individuals it's hard to understand
There is not, nor is going to be any specific plan
There always must be a greater dominator
These sheep seem to need a fairy-tale creator
