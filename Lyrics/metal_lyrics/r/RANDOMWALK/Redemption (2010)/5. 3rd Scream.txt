Thrice held another scream,
In time to kill my dream
Down lies, the cosmic fiend,
I think it has my face...
Here comes, the jester dance,
A blur inside my eyes
3rd scream, deliver me,
I know he has my face...
And the screams in your dreams
Are growing louder than hell,
The pain arrives; you smell the fear inside you.
And the screams in your dreams
Are growing louder than hell,
Inside the silent place you've always been.
Scream one, delirium,
The voices hunt me down
Chimera, seducing bane,
"I want to know your sins..."
Sneak inside the nightmare,
1.000 deaths to come
Just one more, creeping in, drilling on, burning through,
"Tell me your fucking sins..."
Scream two, oblivion scars,
That burn beneath the stars
Medusa limbs invade me,
I think she has my face...
Failing light, the traitor weaves,
Beholder of my sins
3rd scream, deliver me,
I know he has my face...
And the screams in your dreams
Are growing louder than hell,
The pain arrives; you smell the fear inside you.
And the screams in your dreams
Are growing louder than hell,
Inside the silent place you've always been.
