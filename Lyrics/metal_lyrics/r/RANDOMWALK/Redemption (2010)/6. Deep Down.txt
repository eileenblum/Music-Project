Smeared edge of a knife that went all the way,
But found no heart left.
Deep down inside,
You bite your tongue to feel alive...
Still crawling, still drowning,
You find no breath inside you,
Still freezing, still bleeding
And still you wonder why...
Deep down inside, you're emptier still...
Deep down inside, you're on your own...
Deep down inside, where your beasts reside...
Deep down inside, you are alone...
Void eyes that stare at your empty shell,
But see no meaning.
Deep down inside,
You find no way to feel alive...
Still crawling, still drowning,
Still sucking pride and fraud.
Still freezing, still bleeding
And there's no wonder why...
Deep down inside, you're emptier still...
Deep down inside, you're on your own...
Deep down inside, where your beasts reside...
Deep down inside, you are alone...
