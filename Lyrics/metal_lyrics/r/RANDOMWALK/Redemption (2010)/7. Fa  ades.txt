Your sick remains,
The scourge of all her promises,
Shattered debris,
Inflict another wound...
Before you know,
You drink the poison of your tongue,
Another war,
Another absolution...
Unseen, unheard,
You swept the smile of your faÃ§ade.
Concealed, lifebled,
You counted countless pieces...
Familiar sounds,
You turn to look around you,
Thorns in your side,
The canvas waits the final touch,
Before you know,
You drink the poison of your tongue,
Another war,
Another absolution...
Unseen, unheard,
You swept the smile of your faÃ§ade.
Concealed, lifebled,
You counted countless pieces...
