Alone, again...
My only friend and I
Alone, once more
Licking the mirror...
Give me another smile,
I love to look inside your eyes,
Give me another touch,
My god I feel so cold...
I am cold fever
I am Judas tainted lips
I am everything, I am anything
I am tears of grief that slowly drip
I can't recall
How many nights I've spent
Alone, once more
My self infection...
Give me another smile,
I love to look inside your eyes,
Give me another touch,
My god I feel so cold...
I am cold fever
I am Judas tainted lips
I am everything, I am anything
I am tears of grief that slowly drip
I'm cold...
