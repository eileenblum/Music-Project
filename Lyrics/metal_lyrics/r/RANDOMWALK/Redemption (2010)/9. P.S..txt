Vain... It's all I see.
You see the lights and smile
And sweep the stains of me.
Veiled... Put out of sight.
So no one sees my smile.
I sheathe my blood red fangs.
The wishes that you hoped to draw me near,
Are nothing but another kind of suicide,
The final act you've always yearned to see,
It's me, it's me...
For all the times your torrents brought me down,
For all the priceless moments that we used to share,
For all the things you knew I couldn't bear,
Please die â goodbye...
Please let me spoil
Let me degenerate
Wipe out the stars above
I am the spiteful core...
Please let me spoil
Let me degenerate
Entwine your heart within
Let's drink another sin...
Vain... It's all I see.
You see the lights and smile
And sweep the stains of me.
Veiled... Put out of sight.
So no one sees my smile.
I sheathe my blood red fangs.
