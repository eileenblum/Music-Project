Far cries, far sighs,
The wind that slowly burns your back
Thick lies, demise,
The emptiness of slain goodbyes,
Your flesh, denies,
Another blow that brings you down,
Numb eyes, surprise,
The lady's hand upon you,
As you see the blood beneath your wings
Far cries, far sighs,
Wild acid curses drill your mind,
Thick lies, crawl deep,
In your intoxicated sleep,
Swift glance, inside,
The shallow graveland of your past,
Dead eyes, surprise,
The lady's hand upon you,
As you see the blood beneath your wings
