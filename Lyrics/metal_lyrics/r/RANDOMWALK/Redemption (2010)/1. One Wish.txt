I wish to begin with a kiss
and find the evergrey
to flood, to fill one more delusion
that satisfies my woes...
One dream, one breath,
One more flat line to pace,
Another night I tolerate
The filthy shit that seems to be my face.
Another night goes by...
I need a sound,
I need a voice that speaks my name,
A different eye to recognize
The tortured fiend that used to be myself.
Beneath my secret smile,
I lick my curse.
Another fading light,
Another night.
I wish, to become the machine I so despise
and feast on cries,
To dissolve and fly
and drown inside my ugly lies...
I wish to sleep,
I wish to smile,
Deep down inside
I wish to covet my denial.
It's growing darker with each breath
