Fireflies navigate me,
You did enough to break me,
Headstones indicate the path I have to take...
Never have I failed to endure my torment,
Never have I stained my prideless eye,
With this disgusting pointless fiction you call cry...
I close my eyes and sleep on my own,
I close my eyes and dream on my own,
I look inside and feel there's nothing left to heal,
I close my eyes and die on my own.
Break,
I break in silence...
Fall,
I fear to breathe...
200.000 cuts that left me bleeding,
No one's here to hear me screaming...
Hours burn through,
My eyes feel so demeaning,
Can I infect you to receive another lie?
Better to forget any goddamn feeling,
Better to succumb in a restless feeding,
To eat my prospects and my fantasies away...
I close my eyes and sleep on my own,
I close my eyes and dream on my own,
I look inside and feel there's nothing left to heal,
I close my eyes and die on my own.
Break,
I break in silence...
Fall,
I fear to breathe...
200.000 cuts that left me bleeding,
No one's here to hear me screaming...
