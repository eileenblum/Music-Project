Faces down, I greet you with another fall.
Faces down, just breathe without a sound.
Touch me merrily,
Strike me gently,
Cuddle me hard again,
For I am he who grants you life...
Burn, Dark, Beat me gently,
Frown, Drown, Hold me down,
You're blessed to forget.
Faces down,
So scared to look around,
Lonely shades of grey,
I think I'm one of them...
Faces down,
So scared to look around,
Lonely shades of grey,
We breathe without a sound...
Faces down, I'm in need of another scar.
Faces down, so scared to breathe aloud...
Whisper bluntly,
Pry about me,
Lick my pride again,
For I am he who brings you light...
Flee, Scared,
One more denial,
Scorn me, Mock me,
Hold me down,
You're blessed to forget.
