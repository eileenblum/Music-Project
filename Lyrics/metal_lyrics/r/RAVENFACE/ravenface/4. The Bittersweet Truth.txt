How could I ignore
The writing written on the wall
It's so clear now

There's nothing else to live for 
When it all falls away
And every lie I fell for. 
A higher price to pay

Looking back
That time is done
And everything that I've become
Such a wasted soul
This life, is spent
I've lost control

If I had one
Last request
In spite of this
That when I'm gone
Your ashes will be missed

[Chorus:]
And so it begins
Eating away from the inside out
You've suffered your sins
And try to forgive but you cant get out
Living a lie
Keep it inside
There's no where to hide
The bittersweet truth
The bittersweet truth
We're all going down now

How could I
Ignore these words
Breaking me apart

Pushed in that direction
Blinded by perfection
Broken heart
Broken lives
Pale minds and bitter lies

[Chorus:]
And so it begins
Eating away from the inside out
You've suffered your sins
And try to forgive but you cant get out
Living a lie
Keep it inside
There's no where to hide
The bittersweet truth
The bittersweet truth
We're all going down now

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
And so it begins
Eating away from the inside out
You've suffered your sins
And try to forgive but you cant get out
Living a lie
Keep it inside
There's no where to hide
The bittersweet truth
The bittersweet truth
We're all going down now
