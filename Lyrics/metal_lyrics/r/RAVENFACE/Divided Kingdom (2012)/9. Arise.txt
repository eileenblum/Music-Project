I spent my life running away from you
Still trying to find an answer
You'll break before I do
Fuck you and everything you stand for

I promise you'll feel the pain that you've given
So honest
Regardless
This fight remains unfinished

Open up my eyes and show me daylight
We nearly made it through the darkest night
Set yourself aside and be reminded
Walk your own path, you decide it

I've cut myself into pieces
Searching a future that never existed
Why should I give up my life
If you're just so misguided

I promise
You'll feel the pain that you've given
So honest
Regardless
Oh

Open up my eyes and show me daylight
We nearly made it through the darkest night
Set yourself aside
And be reminded
Walk your own path
You decide it

I've spent my life running away from you
Still trying to find an answer
You'll break before I do
Fuck you and everything you stand for

Counting the battles of the past
Can't escape it's grasp
Somebody help me breathe again
Open up my eyes
Awakened life
Begin again

Open up my eyes and show me daylight
We nearly made it through the darkest night
Set yourself aside and be reminded
Walk your own path, you decide it
Arise
