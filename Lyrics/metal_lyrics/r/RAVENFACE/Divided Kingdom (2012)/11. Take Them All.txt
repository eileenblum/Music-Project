Tonight my eyes are open
Tonight they start to drown [?]
This is our time to show them
That they won't keep us down
Keep us down

Tonight, call to arms
To stay our ground and fight
To turn the tables on them
End of their lives tonight

Tonight my eyes are open
Tonight they start to drown [?]
This is our time to show them
That they won't keep us down

You can tell me it's a war [?]
But I can't wait to
Tell you what a waste of love that fades [?]
Put on a fight 'til the bitter end
There's nothing left

Break
Fall
We won't be stuck
Before we fucking take them on [?]
Burn
It
Open your eyes

I try to tell myself
That this is what I need
But I'm still searching for
the missing puzzle piece

Tonight my eyes are open
Tonight they start to drown [?]
This is our time to show them
That they won't keep us down

You can tell me it's a war [?]
But I can't wait to
Tell you what a waste of love that fades [?]
Put on a fight 'til the bitter end
There's nothing left

Break
Fall
We won't be stuck
Before we fucking take them on [?]
Burn
It
Open your eyes

[?] this is our war
The Earth stand tall
And then we are

Break
Fall
The Earth won't fall [?]
Burn
It
And burn it all [?]
