Someone living in memories
locked away in transparency
Someone pull me out and help me see
I don't even know what I believe
You're all I see

Oh can you save me ?
Oh can you save me ?

Someone living in memories 
locked away in transparency 
Falling down from grace to apathy
Just to haunt me in my dreams

Pull me out and help me see
I don't even know what I believe
What I believe

Oh can you save me ?
Oh can you save me ?

Pull me out and help me see
I don't even know what I believe (I believe)
You're all I see

Oh can you save me ?
Oh can you save me ?

Someone living in memories
locked away in transparency
Falling down from grace to apathy
Just to haunt me in my dreams

Locked away in transparency
Locked away in transparency
Locked away in transparency
