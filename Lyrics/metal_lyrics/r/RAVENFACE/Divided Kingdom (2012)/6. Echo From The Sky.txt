[Chorus:]
The weight of the world is holding us down
The fire will rise and will burn to the ground
These words you will hear
Echo from the sky.

And here at the end
We cannot pretend
That we didnât see our futures.
For heaven for hell
We made this ourselves.
We are the architects.

[Chorus:]
The weight of the world is holding us down
The fire will rise and will burn to the ground
These words you will hear
echo from the sky.

Are you ready to die?
