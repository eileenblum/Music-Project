[feat. Chris Clancy Of Mutiny Within]Can we be safe from the hell that we brought on ourselves?
Will we be free when this storm has passed?
Doubt will survive when weâre barely alive.
Reduced to ashes in the aftermath.

Choking our freedom
(Reduced to ashes in the aftermath)
This is a divided Kingdom
(Reduced to ashes in the aftermath)
The aftermath

[Chorus:]
We come alive
We shed new skin.
As we breathe and bring new life.
We bring new life.

Can we be safe from the storm we end time in a sky[?]
We know our future but weâre chained to the past
Doubt will survive when weâre barely alive
Reduced to ashes in the aftermath.

[Chorus:]
We come alive
We shed new skin.
As we breathe and bring new life.
As we bring new life.
Bring new life.

Now is the time to welcome tomorrow and start again.
It seems to be clear as the fear and the sorrow
For the day we await our end.

Choking our freedom
(Reduced to ashes in the aftermath)
This is a Divided Kingdom
(Reduced to ashes in the aftermath)
The Aftermath

[Chorus:]
We come alive
We shed new skin
As we breathe and bring new life.
We bring new life.
