[Chorus:]
Do you remember when all we wanted,was nothing but each other and something that was solid?
Now that itâs over, Iâve got a little room to breathe,
Nothing but memories to keep me sober.
Nothing but memories
A perfect vision of the past.
Should never resisted
If life has taught me one thing
Itâs that our happiness is fleeting
And nothing but sorrow remains.

Got to break the cycle
We need to grieve
Find a way to let this this thing out
Iâve been chasing the sky for too long
For too long

[Chorus:]
Do you remember when all we wanted,was nothing but each other and something that was solid?
Now that itâs over Iâve got a little room to breathe,nothing but memories to keep me sober.

[Chorus:]
Do you remember when all we wantedwas nothing but each other and something that was solid?
Now that itâs over Iâve got a little room to breathe,nothing but memories to keep me sober

If life has taught me one thing
Itâs that our happiness is fleeting
And nothing more than sorrow remains.
Sorrow Remains.
