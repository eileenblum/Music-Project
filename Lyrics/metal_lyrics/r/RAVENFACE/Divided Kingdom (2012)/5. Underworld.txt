Some people go through their miserable life
Hiding themselves in the caring skies [?]
The people crying atleast for a while [?]
The sin is the war [?]
And the first one's the smile [?]

Temptatious ? [?]
? my ending
They cannot be controlled
I sold my soul to the underworld

[Chorus:]
Have you forgotten where you were
When I was down
That it was you
Who kept me crawling on the ground
(Where were you)
I wanted you
I needed you
My life was broken into two
This time I'm going alone

Some people go through their miserable life
Nothing else but themselves in mind
It's just a matter parting[?] your time
Because sooner or later
There'll be noone seeing your sight

[Chorus:]
Have you forgotten where you were
When I was down
That it was you
Who kept me crawling on the ground
(Where were you)
I wanted you
I needed you
My life was broken into two
This time I'm going alone

Temptatious ? [?]
? my ending
They cannot be controlled
I sold my soul to the underworld
I sold my soul to the underworld

Have you forgotten where you were
When I was down
That it was you
Who kept me crawling on the ground
I wanted you
I needed you
My life was broken into two
This time I'm going alone

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Have you forgotten where you were
When I was down
That it was you
Who kept me crawling on the ground
(Where were you)
I wanted you
I needed you
My life was broken into two
This time I'm going alone
