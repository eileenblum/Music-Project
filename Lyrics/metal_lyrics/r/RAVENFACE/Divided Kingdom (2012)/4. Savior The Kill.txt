Your rested tongue is dipped in venom
And decided in the wrong direction.
Your words mean nothing.
The rivers in front of you
Will always speak the truth.
You want to savor the fucking kill.

[Chorus:]
The knives in my back are starting to sting.
The fire in my heart is lingering.
You want to know what itâs like to give alone everything?
See the world through my eyes.
Letâs get our stink on it [?]
Destroying everything around you
You wonât let us have destruction.

[Chorus:]
The knives in my back are starting to sting.
The fire in my heart is lingering.
You want to know what itâs like to give alone everything?
See the world through my eyes.
See the world through my eyes. [4x]

[Chorus:]
The knives in my back are starting to sting.
The fire in my heart is lingering.
You want to know what itâs like to give alone everything?
See the world through my eyes.
