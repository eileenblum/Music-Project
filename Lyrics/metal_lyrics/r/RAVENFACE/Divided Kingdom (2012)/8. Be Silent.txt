We are the virus
Are you too blind to read the warnings?
It's not a matter of wealth
There's no one coming here to save you
You've got to save yourself

We're walking a path to destruction
How can you live when you're part of the problem?

They will find you and take everything away from you

I'm so sick and tired of the waiting
I don't have the time or the patience

[Chorus:]
Who do we think we are?
Like this whole world is ours
We build it up so we can tear it apart
Who do we think we are?
Like this whole world is ours
I won't be silent while you tear it all apart

There's no one coming here to save you
You've got to save yourself

[Chorus]

I'm so sick and tired of the waiting
I don't have the time or the patience

[Solo]

[Chorus]

Who do we think we are [3x]
