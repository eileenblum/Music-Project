There's blood on my hands
And it's not mine
I can't escape this time
There's no way out or to outrun this crime

I refuse, deny, escape your lies
The truth is blind
You're seeing through dead eyes

I'm looking for a reason
But all I seem to find
Is nothing but the memories
I thought I'd left behind

[Chorus:]
I pray to God to save me
But God's not on my side
Does he see that I am drowning
We all drown beneath the tides
(We all drown beneath the tides, yeah)

Can we turn back time
Forever wait in line
For me to take what's yours
And you to take what's mine

This is my serenity
It is what makes us free

I'm looking for a reason
But all I seem to find
Is nothing but the memories
I thought I'd left behind

[Chorus:]
I pray to God to save me
But God's not on my side
Does he see that I am drowning
We all drown beneath the tides

I refuse
(Refuse)
Deny
(Deny)
Escape
(Escape)
Your lies
(Your lies)
Until
(Until)
It's gone
(It's gone)
Eeeaah

We all drown
Beneath the tides
We all drown

We're seeing through dead eyes
You'll drown beneath the tides
You'll drown beneath the tides
Beneath the tides
You'll drown beneath the tides
Beneath the tides
