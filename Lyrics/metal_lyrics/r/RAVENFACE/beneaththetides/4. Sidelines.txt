Our days are numbered
I can feel their weight
It's pushing down on me
It only fuels our hate

I've seen the world now through open eyes
I've seen enough of it
To know we're just devils in disguise

Oh, and in the end there will be no divide
There is no right or wrong
So my advice is put yourself aside
And pray it takes you soon

[Chorus:]
This is where we make our stand
My whole life
I've been waiting on the sidelines
For someone just to give me a chance
Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting for a lifetime

And will you come for me?
And save me from my hate
You're far away from me
And pull me out before it's too late

[Solo]

I'm falling fast now through empty spaces
Filling up my mind with half familiar faces
Of people, broken hearts, and broken homes
Desperatley searching
For a place just to call their own

Oh, and in the end there will be no divide
There is no right or wrong
So my advice is put yourself aside
And pray it takes you soon

[Chorus:]
This is where we make our stand
My whole life
I've been waiting on the sidelines
For someone just to give me a chance
Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting for a lifetime

And will you come for me?
And save me from my hate
You're far away from me
And pull me out before it's too late

[Chorus - Spoken:]
This is where we make our stand
My whole life
I've been waiting on the sidelines
For someone just to give me a chance
Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting for a lifetime

[Spoken:]
And will you come for me?
And save me from my hate
You're far away from me
And pull me out before it's too late

Pull me out before it's too late

[Chorus:]
This is where we make our stand
My whole life
I've been waiting on the sidelines
For someone just to give me a chance
Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting for a lifetime

And will you come for me?
And save me from my hate
You're far away from me
And pull me out before it's too late
