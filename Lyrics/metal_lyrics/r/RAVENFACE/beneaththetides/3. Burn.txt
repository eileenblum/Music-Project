My head is a battleground
Conflicting constantly
The fire inside
I'll burn it out of me

Heavy heart in my hand

[Chorus:]
Her dreams have turned to dust
But now there's no way back
With all our bridges burned
I only Blame myself
I wish that you could see
How bright you made me burn

Give me your hand
And I'll make my way back home

Your mind is a mystery
A puzzle missing a piece
The fire inside
I'll burn it out of me

Heavy heart in my hand

[Chorus:]
Her dreams have turned to dust
But now there's no way back
With all our bridges burned
I only Blame myself
I wish that you could see
How bright you made me burn

Give me your hand
And I'll make my way back home

Their minds made up
They'll never learn
And so I light the fuse
And so I watch you burn

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Her dreams have turned to dust
But now there's no way back
With all our bridges burned
I only Blame myself
I wish that you could see
How bright you made me burn

Give me your hand
And I'll make my way back home
