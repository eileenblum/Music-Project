Time waits for noone
So make your move
Trapped in the undertow
It must be hard to breathe
Playing with fire
It will transpire
Oh, what a mess we made [?]

An open wound in a salting life [?]
?
You dug your own grave
The choices you made
Stuck in the mirror for so long to be [?]

I wait for noone
So make your move
Trapped in the undertow
It must be hard to breathe

[Chorus:]
The days are passing me by
I will learn to live [?]
The laugh and look in your eyes [?]
The days are passing me by

I tried to run [?]
But the ?
But now I'll be alive
I am left with nothing

I wait for noone
So make your move
Trapped in the undertow
It must be hard to breathe

[Chorus:]
The days are passing me by
I will learn to live [?]
The laugh and look in your eyes [?]
The days are passing me by

[Solo]

We're paying for the weight [?]
Of our old mistakes [?]
Always running
?

We're paying for the weight [?]
Of our old mistakes [?]
Always running
But nobody ever escapes
Your body never escapes
Your body never escapes

[Chorus:]
The days are passing me by
I will learn to live [?]
The laugh and look in your eyes [?]
