[Solo 1/2]

Plastic faces in the dark
Empty spaces and emptier hearts
This time I'm taking back what's mine
Waoh!

[Chorus:]
Lights from your eyes
Guide the way
Through darker times
We'll find a way
But each day is getting longer
The wounds will soon be gone
And we'll raise the dead together
This is the resurrection

Yaoh!
Something
Somewhere
Went wrong
Dispair
But I
Don't care
This is the end
Try me
One time
You'll see
I'm fine
This is the last time

[Chorus:]
Lights from your eyes
Guide the way
Through darker times
We'll find a way
But each day is getting longer
The wounds will soon be gone
And we'll raise the dead together
This is the resurrection
(This is the resurrection)

Goddamn!
Well we're the ones you love to hate
But every fucking thing
You ever said to me
Was just another force
Behind my back
Pushing me
To fuck you up

Zomg, they're shit, fuck them, fuck Ravenface

Shut the fuck up, bitch
I'll break your fucking face
This is the sound of me not giving a fuck what you think

[Solo 2/2]

[Chorus - Whispered:]
Lights from your eyes
Guide the way
Through darker times
We'll find a way

[Chorus:]
Lights from your eyes
Guide the way
Through darker times
We'll find a way
But each day is getting longer
The wounds will soon be gone
And we'll raise the dead together
This is the resurrection
