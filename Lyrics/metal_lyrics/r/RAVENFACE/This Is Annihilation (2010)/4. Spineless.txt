Sit the fuck down,
You're done now,
Crawl underneath your throne,
Of homemade authority.
Fuck you,
Spineless as the day you were made,
Yourself is the only one betrayed.
We built ourselves,
On everything you hated.
We shall not,
Crumble under your attacks,
The spineless are the first to fall.
Face to face,
We'll settle this today.
Pathetic jealousy,
A framed failure,
Is all you are to me.
Spineless as the day you were made,
Yourself is the only one betrayed.
We built ourselves,
On everything you hated.
We shall not,
Crumble under your attacks,
The spineless are the first to fall.
Oh my god!
I hate the very ground your walking on now,
I hate the very air you breathe.
Such scum,
Putrid,
Pathetic,
In every way,
I'll make you pay.
We built ourselves,
On everything you hated.
We shall not,
Crumble under your attacks,
The spineless are the first to fall.
Everyone,
Hates you.
We built ourselves,
On everything you hated.
We shall not,
Crumble under your attacks,
The spineless are the first to fall.
