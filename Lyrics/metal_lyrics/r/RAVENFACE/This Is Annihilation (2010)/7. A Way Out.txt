Somebody save me
I feel it on the inside [?]
Don't let it take me
But it's growing far too fast to hide

I feel ?
Nothing more than ?
I will not choose the way [?]

The truth is
We all fall down [?]
There's noone who can save me now
Just take my hand
I'll guide you without [?]
We'll leave the path behind us [?]
We'll find a way out
We'll find a way out

?
?
It couldn't happen
But deep inside I know it did
My spirit left me [?]
Nothing left but darkness and empty hate

The truth is
We all fall down ?
There's noone who can save me now
Just take my hand
I'll guide you without [?]
We'll leave the path behind us [?]
We'll find a way out
(Save me)
[?]
We'll find a way out
We'll find a way out
