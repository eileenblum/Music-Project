Million dollar industries
Dump their sewage into seas
Pollution of the environment
Garbage and waste in abundance

Oceans full of plastic parts
Global warming, greenhouse gas
Deadly diseases in the air
But no one really cares

Cruel dictators rule the world
Populations being observed
Chemical warfare, air attack
Nuclear destruction, striking back

Corrupt criminals without fear
Third world war is almost here
Everything's out of control
Toxic rain will fall

Whey do the guilty close their eyes
As the world burns down in flames
All these criminals deserve to die
A death list of thousand names

Why do we still close our eyes
As the world burns down in flames
All these bastards have to die
Now it's time to end their dreadful games

Dead future

Look what we have done
Look what we've become
All hope is gone
And nowhere to run

Abandon all hope
Darkness descends
Mankind is lost
And this is the end

The extinction of mankind
Is just a question of time
Say goodbye, my friend
'Cause this is the end
