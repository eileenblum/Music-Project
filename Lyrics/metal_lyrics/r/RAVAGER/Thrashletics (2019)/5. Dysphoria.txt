Raised as daddy's little princess
No one knew how much he hated dress
Didn't like to play with dolls
All he wished was having balls

Raised as mommy's mighty knight
No one knew how much she liked girly tights
Pants felt like a prison
She was forlorn and unforgiven

People alienate
What they cannot seize
Fear turns into hate
Man turns into beast

Deny and segregate
What they cannot grasp
A meaningless charade
Possible at last
We can

End all dysphoria
Gender dysphoria
Gender dysphoria
Individuality
End all dysphoria
In a free society

Time to realise
Everyone lives their own lives
What other people do
Is no business of you

People care too much
About other's living in their own ways
Expecting them to budge
But who are they to judge

People alienate
What they cannot seize
Fear turns into hate
Man turns into beast

Deny and segregate
What they cannot grasp
A meaningless charade
Possible at last
We can

End all dysphoria
Gender dysphoria
Gender dysphoria
Individuality
End all dysphoria
In a free society

Time to realise
Everyone lives their own lives
What other people do
Is no business of you

People care too much
About other's living in their own ways
Expecting them to budge
But who are they to judge
