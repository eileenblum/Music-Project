Bang your heads, raise your fists
Show your horns, circle pits
Cartridge belts, skinny pants
Muscle shirts, sweatbands

Long hairs, white-colored boots
Let's go crazy, come on, dude
Sweaty bodies, exhausted air
Freaky people everywhere

Broken noses, losing tooth
Death from thrashing overdose
No surrender, party time
Everybody's feeling fine

Don't recover, just go mad
Spin around, lose your heads
Walls of death, mosh attacks
Fuck the posers, let us thrash!

Pogo dance, hit the ground
Blood will flow, enjoy the sound
Drums are fast, guitars shred
Vocals screwing off your head

Lose control, total wreck
Kick some asses, break some necks
Doing hells, swirling hair
Shattered glasses everywhere

Diving stages, flying high
Falling down, but never cry
Ultra violence, monster thrill
When we're on stage we're gonna kill

Strike with power, give the best
Side by side with our guests
Drinking beer, eating flesh
United forces, let us thrash

All for one and one for all
If we hit the floor, we can always crawl
Rage, chaos, pogo dance
Time to fight, time for violence

Mosh! Bang! Circle pits!
Time to go insane
Attack! Madness! Holy shit!
You will lose your brain

Pit stop
Don't stop in the pit
Pit stop
Don't stop in the pit

Elbows from hell straight in your face
Demolished clothes, you are ablaze
The pit covered in blood

Pit stop
Don't stop in the pit
Pit stop
Don't stop in the pit
