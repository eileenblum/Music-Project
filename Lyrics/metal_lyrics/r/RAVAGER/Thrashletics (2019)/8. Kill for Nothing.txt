You want to be a hero
You're nothing but a tool
Death will be your prize
You are just a fool

They teach you how to live
From the cradle to the grave
They teach you how to murder
An inculcated hate

They teach you how to feel like
No empathy, no love
They teach you how to think
But nothing is enough

Your leaders are protected
Like cowards in their caves
In safety they forge plans
You're nothing but a slave

Why are you so stupid
How could you be so blind
Only one reason
You must have lost your mind

Brainwashed, manipulated
You do everything they want
Like a brainless zombie
You are on the hunt

They send you on your mission
A suicide for god
Your targets in position
No turning back to stop

I don't live in fear
And I don't change my life
I won't disappear
To survive

I just want to understand
What's going wrong in your head
What's the reason for your hate
Why do you want us dead

Maybe you want to take control
By spreading fear and fright
Fighting for a holy war
Determine our life

Kill for nothing
Die without sense
Kill for no one
Die without sense

Kill without warning
Die for a god unknown
Kill without reason
Die your death alone

Your battle's almost over
And now your work is done
But you are not a martyr
You are the nameless one

Now that you are dead
only ashes will remain
Blood is on your hands
You're the one to blame

Tell me how it feels like
To be a murderer without face
I hope you burn in hell
Be punished for disgrace

I don't live in fear
And I don't change my life
I won't disappear
To survive

I just want to understand
What's going wrong in your head
What's the reason for your hate
Why do you want us dead

Maybe you want to take control
By spreading fear and fright
Fighting for your holy war
Determine our life

Kill for nothing
Die without sense
Kill for no one
Die without sense

Kill without warning
Die for a god unknown
Kill without reason
Die your death alone

Kill for nothing
Die without sense
Die, die, die
Kill without sense

Kill, kill, kill
Die for a god unknown
Die, die, die
Die your death alone
