It makes me sick
When I'm surfing the World-Wide Web
And everyone thinks there are no rules

It makes me sick
When I see all those wannabe heroes
Behind their keyboards thinking they're cool

It makes me sick
When I read the social-media garbage
Full of bullshit, idiocy and hate

This can not be true, this can not be real,
But we all live in a society of blunted state

It makes me sick
When I turn on the TV I have to vomit
What I watch on the screen

It makes me sick
When I listen to the radio
A frog is croaking, or maybe a teen

It makes me sick
When I see all the casting shows
Where adult people make a fool of themselves

This can not be true, this can not be real,
But we all live in a society of blunted state

I just can't believe
How jaded we've become
How stupid we are
What happened to us

I often ask myself
If that really can be
Perhaps it's a dream
What is happening to me

I wanna close my eyes
So I'm far away
And I can imagine
My own perfect day

I still can't believe
How jaded we've become
How stupid we are
What happened to us

Take a look into the mirror
What do you see
You are a part of this forlorn
Grotesque and loathsome society

Take a look into the mirror
What do you see
You are a part of this forlorn
Grotesque and loathsome society
