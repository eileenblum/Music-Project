Inhumane atrocities, civilians had to die
An order of barbarity, the government told a lie
Maintaining their innocence, don't belong to Vietcong
Murderers without empathy, the slaughter's just begun

They kill and kill and kill, the bullets flew like rain
Achievement of their body count, disconnect their brains
Humiliated women, mutilated, raped to death
Stacked up in the ditches, a bloodbath to the last

Suffer
Despair
Murderers
Warfare

Infants, unarmed elders, they never had a chance
Butchered out of boredom, slaughtered for revenge
Old women were praying, then beheaded from behind
Pinkville called the horror, you keep it in your mind

An incredible massacre, smothered by the government
Concealing its existence, their loss of innocence
They deceived the public, 'til pictures called the truth
Disbelief in modern life, thousands had been used

Suffer
Despair
Torment
Warfare
Cowards
Deniers
Murderers
Liars

Slaughter of innocents
No more search and destroy
Slaughter of innocents
Walk through the hell on earth

Slaughter of innocents
No more search and destroy
Slaughter of innocents
Walk through the hell on earth

Slaughter of innocents
No chance to survive
Slaughter of innocents
There is no way out of this hell
For you

Bombs are falling
Machine-guns fire roaring
Death is calling

Start the murder in a bestial way
Let the napalm rain
Take no prisoners on this bloody field
Atrocities day by day

The stench of rotten flesh pervades the air
No one will survive
In this carnage they had no chance
A tragedy through the years

Bombs are falling
Machine-guns fire roaring
Death is calling

People crying
A lot of bullets flying
Victims dying

In this hell

Of pain, of sorrow
Of horror and misery
Of sadness, of torment
Of torture and agony
