We are the legion
The ones you fear
Our time has come now
The end is almost here

We are invincible
The force that can't be killed
You'll become our slaves
Now we rise from our graves

From the fiery holes
Prepared for the war
It's time for us to rise
In the dark of night
We raise our flag
It's time for us to fight

We are born for war

When sky turned black
We are ready for attack
We are hungry for war

We are thirsty for blood
Camouflaged in blood
You can hear us roar

Legions of hate
Possessed by the devil
Straight out of hell

Troops of the flame
Guided by Satan
Cursed by a spell

We show no mercy
United in pain
We sold our souls

Creatures of evil
Rise up with power
From abyssal holes

The storm of the thrashletics
Thrashletics out of hell
The storm of the thrashletics
Thrashletics out of hell

From the fiery holes
Prepared for the war
It's time for us to rise
In the dark of night
We raise our flag
It's time for us to fight

We are born for war!

It's time for desperation
Prepare for your demise
Time for decapitation
You'll lose your heads tonight
