Pumped inside my body, running through my veins
My heart is beating fast, you're relieving the pain
Yearning for impact, for insertion, for the prick
Really my last hope before blood is getting thick

You are deadly poison, like the devil in my soul
Bury me alive, let me die in that hole
Life is so pointless and it doesn't make no sense
This couldn't be the end, give me a last chance

Give me a last chance

I can't see it coming, I am dazed and confused
Blew away emotions, I am already used
Raping all my senses, I am lost and forlorn
The flash begins again, but don't let me mourn

Begging not for mercy, give me more from the dose
Don't stop that feeling, that's the pain that I chose
Hiding in the shadows and creeping from behind
Bereavement of my body, obscuring of my mind

Obscuring of my mind
Obscuring of my mind

Mindblender
Mindblender
Mindblender
You are creeping from behind
And blending all my mind

Push me down
Take me high
Catch my soul
Let me fly

Clean my senses
Blend my mind
Drive me crazy
Make me blind

I hate you
You love me
End my life
Set me free

No more torture
Take my breath
Show no mercy
Bring me death

Mindblender
Mindblender
Mindblender
You are creeping from behind
And blending all my mind
