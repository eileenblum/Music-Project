Now your death has been decreed
The law must be obeyed
You kneel before the tyrant's throne
Broken and afraid
The axe will fall upon your neck
No place to run or hide
Your corpse will join the bones of those
Who by the law have died

Axe of death waits to fall
From below you hear Hell's call
Say goodbye to the Sun
Time ran out, your days are done

Hatred you feel in vain
Sentenced to die you'll pay for your acts
Blessed by an end to pain
The headsman will strike with a swing of the axe
For heaven hope is faint
And there is no escape from your restraint
Your soul death shall reap
Night shall be endless in eternal sleep

Now your path comes to its end
Just a show for the crowd
Finding hard to understand
How your death is allowed
Facing odds that seem to be
Impossible to beat
You wonder what will be the face
Of the destiny you'll meet
