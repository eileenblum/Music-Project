If you touch me
I'll be close to you
Satisfy your heart
Fulfilled of good blood

In the night
I'm ready for your love
Oh baby baby â you come and get it hot
Love all night
Tonight you feel you're in paradise
Steal my soul
In my bed you feel like a woman

Welcome to my fire
In through the fire
Welcome to my fire
Sweet desire

If you need me
You'll get all of me
My body is burning
And teasing into your body

In the night
I'm ready for your love
Oh baby baby â you come and get it hot
Love all night
Tonight you feel you're in paradise
Steal my soul
In my bed you feel like a woman

Welcome to my fire
In through the fire
Welcome to my fire
Sweet desire

I'm your man
And I'm proud to be
Side by side
You groove in my life

In the night
I'm ready for your love
Oh baby baby â you come and get it hot
Love all night
Tonight you feel you're in paradise
Steal my soul
In my bed you feel like a woman

Welcome to my fire
In through the fire
Welcome to my fire
Sweet desire
