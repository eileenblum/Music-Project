A flash in the night
Virgin steel
Forged to fight
This slayer will kill

Facing the wind
Death or glory
Riding my horse
Battle cry

Splitting their skulls
Their blood I spill
Defying my enemies
With an iron will

Facing the wind
Howling and black
Warriors fall
Before my attack

Tasting their blood
Slaughtering and maiming
Strike after strike
Fear my way!

For the ancient gods
That still watch us from above...
Valhalla will be there
When I feel cold and dying...

A flash in the night
Virgin steel
Forged to fight
This slayer will kill

Tasting their blood
Slaughtering and maiming
Strike after strike
Fear my way!

Facing the wind
Facing the wind
Facing the wind
Facing the wind
