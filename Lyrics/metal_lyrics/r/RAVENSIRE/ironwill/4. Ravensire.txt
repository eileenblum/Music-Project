The sign of the
Warrior
With the wolf by my
Side
And I'm holding my
Shield
I keep our flame alive
And I engage the
Enemy!
And I give them loss!
I'm lord of the dark
I'm Ravensire!

Raven call
Raven claw
Warning in the night
In this night!
Ritual curse
Ripping flesh
You can't defy the
Blade
This blade!

My journey
To the underworld
Mystic wisdom
By the Gothic runes

Ravensire
Lord of the
Dark abyss
Ravensire!

Raven black
Brave attack
Clashing steel in fray
Doomsday!
Raven flies
Ghastly cries
Omens are revealed
Fate is sealed!

Dark portents
Dire arts of yore
Deathly calling
To the heart of war

Ravensire
Lord of the
Dark abyss
Ravensire!

It's the raven's flight in the night
Dark fate from the sky
I've been cast by the
Witch's eye
Forevermore I will fly!

Raven call
Raven claw
Warning in the night
In this night!
Ritual curse
Ripping flesh
You can't defy the
Blade
This blade!

Ravensire
Lord of the
Dark abyss
Ravensire!
