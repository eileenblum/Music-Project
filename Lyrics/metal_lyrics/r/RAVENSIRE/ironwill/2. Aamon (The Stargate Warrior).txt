Open the gate
Traveller of time
Worship the old
By the wizard of dawn
A singer will praise
The anthem to cry
Fortress in the sky
Glory in the night
Search for the light

A kingdom invader
Rips through the sky
Freedom defender
To extinguish 'em all!

Aamon
Lead the fight!
Aamon
Raise their hope!

Thirst for life
Eternal fate
No inner worm
The host of the
Goau'ld
Rule with their faith
Fight or be slave
Holding the sword
Skill and the might
I'm last man to fall

A kingdom invader
Rips through the sky
Freedom defender
To extinguish 'em all!

Aamon
Lead the fight!
Aamon
Raise their hope!

A kingdom invader
Rips through the sky
Freedom defender
To extinguish 'em all!

Aamon
Lead the fight!
Aamon
Raise their hope!
