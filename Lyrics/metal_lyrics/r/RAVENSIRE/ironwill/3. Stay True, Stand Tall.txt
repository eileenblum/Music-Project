I warn you
No step back
No rest for the wicked
Resisting
Strung out
By falsity and betrayal
Encouraged by justice and valor and might
Rising armies of virtue
Imprisoned, repressed, restrained and enchained
Spread out to keep up the fight

Heathen to the cries
From betrayal
Tears from the skies
All in vain...
Deceived by those lies
Was our fate...

I'm screaming
In anger
I watch the vultures soaring
Defeat them
At all cost
I keep my honour pure
Suppressed by the masses who seek to enslave
A phoenix will rise from the ashes
Trouncing forever the will of the false
Paving its way for the masters

Heathen to the cries
From betrayal
Tears from the skies
All in vain...
Deceived by those lies
Was our fate...

I won't fall
I won't fall
I won't fall
I won't fall
I won't fall

Stay true!
Stand tall!
Stay true!
Stand tall!
