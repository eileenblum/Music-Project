Alone walking through the night no brothers by my side
For I am old my wealth resides in tales I tell with pride
Many years I wandered, and lived life to the full
For this planet can be so kind, yet can be so cruel
White bearded and old
Soon to meet death's clutch
My hands blades did hold
And my eyes have seen so much!
Come sit by the fire
For the night is dark and cold
If such is you desire
Come hear the tales of old
Once the world held magic that now men did forget
Many foes and friends along my journey have I met
You never know for sure where danger may dwell
A fragile woman may be worse than all the fields in Hell
Hear the tales
Of bliss and woe
Time to learn
And know
Come sit by the fire
For the night is dark and cold
If such is you desire
Come hear the tales of old
Alone walking through the night no brothers by my side
For I am old my wealth resides in tales I tell with pride
Many years I wandered, and lived life to the full
For this planet can be so kind, yet can be so cruel
White bearded and old
Soon to meet death's clutch
My hands blades did hold
And my eyes have seen so much!
