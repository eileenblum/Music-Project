Along the green shores of a river
Where once Norsemen settled for winter
Our dragon sails, his heart feeble
Escaping the wrath of the invincible, yeah
So shall the bards sing in times to come
Crosshaven
After fear, slaughter and misery
Torn and ravaged we long for sanctuary
Pleading ancient spirits to strike back
Against our foe, o mighty gods attack, yeah
So shall the bards sing in times to come
Crosshaven
Scattered and battered
The mighty invincible, vanquished
Crosshaven
Crosshaven
Crosshaven
Crosshaven
On the pool we raise our spirits
Having been pushed beyond our limits
It's time to recover from the mighty fray
And return to the high seas in search of prey, yeah
Yeah...
