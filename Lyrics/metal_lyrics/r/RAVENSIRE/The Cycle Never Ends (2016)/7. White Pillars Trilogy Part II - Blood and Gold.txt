Far away, from the cold north
Towards the riches of the holy land
They sailed with a saga ahead
With their crosses and swords in hand
Mighty crusader and king
Would have many stories to tell
He reached the end of the world
In his hands Lisbon and Sintre fell
Sigurd, Crusader
With tales to be told
The way to the East
Paved with blood and gold
Sixty ships and five thousand men
So much to plunder on the way to the east
Swords of steel in the name of Christ
To take the life of every man and beast
Al-Andalus never tried
Such fierceness in battle and barbaric rage
Wild Norsemen converted to Christ
The lion of Norway set free from its cage
Sigurd, Crusader
With tales to be told
The way to the East
Paved with blood and gold
By the mouth of the westernmost river
There lay a fortress of infidel men
And there Sigurd saw arches of stone
With white pillars, timeworn by then
Sigurd, Crusader
With tales to be told
The way to the East
Paved with blood and gold
The fortress was left behind
Onward they sailed, the brave and bold
But there, at the end of the Earth,
There once stood a temple at times of old...
