Into the night the moon shine was bright
I walked on to the stones of old
Where druids once sang and dark leaves now hang
My mood was fearless and bold
Circle of the sun
Lives of men undone
Who was to say what words I should pray
There in the circle of stone
And the cromlech was dark and silent
And the circle I entered alone
And there, possessed by visions
Of a journey to the past
Dreams so real they made me feel
Into a world of yore I had been cast
Times of peace and war
To live forevermore
Seasons changing fast
On a journey to the past
Following my way
As I walk on night and day
Oh... oh...
Stone of Crom whose dark gaping holes
Now vacant, black secrets hide
They murmur atavistic tales and myths
Of death heads that lay inside
Priests now gone were all around
And acknowledged my presence there
Ancient men who ruled back when
True magic was everywhere
Times of peace and war
To live forevermore
One day I shall rest
Upon this world so vast
Ever shall I stay
And never be away
Oh... oh...
Silent
Ancient priests
Hold forth
Staves ablaze
Birth and death
Dying breath
Dying nights
Dying days
Gazing at the sky
Until the day I die
Following my way
As I walk on night and day
