Night was coming to its end
As our prow ploughed the sea
On to the end of the Earth
We sailed untamed and free
Millennia ago
Before the night has died
I'd walk down to the stone
And see the temple rising high
Temple of the Sun
At the end of the Earth
The cycle never ends
Of life, death and rebirth
Wild waves would whip the wharf
And dark and jagged tusks
I longed to stay and watch the sky
For a thousand dawns and dusks
White altars shining bright
Under celestial light
The priests would charge the price
Victims for the sacrifice
Temple of the Moon
At the end of the Earth
May we travel safe
When our vessel leaves its berth
Far away we shall sail
For the glory of Rome
May the gods give us strength
And take us safely home
Millennia ago
Before the night has died
I'd walk down to the stone
And see the temple rising high
Temple of the Sea
At the end of the Earth
By the Ocean that defies
Our courage and our worth
Temple of the gods
Now lost under the sand
I'll see your pillars still
For the end is not the end
