As the dusk gives way to night
The embers' glow grows strong
By the bonfire once a light
The procession is come and gone
Ghosts that rise out from the woods
With memories once held dear
Moving on without a sound
Oblivious to pain and fear
The forest is dark and deep
All is silent like a grave
Do the spirits come in search
Of life that they still crave
Or are they caught between the worlds
Unable to find rest
Burdened by the sins and torment
And anguishes of their past
They march without so much as a nod to acquiesce
Should I try to interact with the ones that came to pass?
Memento ????
De profundis clamavi ad te, Domine: Domine, exaudi vocem meam
????
Kyrie eleison. Christe eleison. Kyrie eleison. Pater noster.
Et ne nos inducas in tentationem. Sed libera nos a malo.
A porta inferi. Erue, Domine, animas eorum.
Requiescant in pace...
Amen...
Phantom glow amidst the trees
Looming from beyond the tomb
Land of never ending darkness
Where all flowers ceased to bloom
I fear that if they lift their heads
To gaze at me with gaping holes
Their eerie light will capture
And forever take away my soul
They march, pale line of light
Sepulchral, expressionless
And the breeze chills to the bone
And the sky is overcast
