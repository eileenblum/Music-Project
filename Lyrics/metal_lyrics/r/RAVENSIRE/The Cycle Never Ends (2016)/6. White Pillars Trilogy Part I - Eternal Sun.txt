Where the land ends and the sea will begin
The King of the realm was summoned to see
Buried in sand, by the ocean blue
Ancient stones bearing portents and prophecy
Surely these stones from an antique past
Blessed in the name of the mother of Christ
Now disclosed by God for all to see
Were the sign of a glorious destiny
When waters mingle
From East and West
We raise our gaze to the eternal Sun
Men of high knowledge came see the stones
Francis of Holland would later recall
A circle of altars from ancient Rome
The Sun and the Moon at the center of all
Then a tower was built on the salt-covered rock
A lighthouse to guide the ships to the land
In time those memories would also fade
And the tower as well was lost in the sand
When waters mingle
From East and West
Our lives go on the endless cycle
We raise our gaze to the unconquered Sun
The time we now live in will soon be the past
Maybe the stones and naught else may last
But for now I toil under the Sun
From the stories that ended, a new one begun
Retrieved from the sand where long they did rest
Altars to gods, and pillars so white
A millennium past, the writings at last
Again praise the Sun under his light
When waters mingle
From East and West
