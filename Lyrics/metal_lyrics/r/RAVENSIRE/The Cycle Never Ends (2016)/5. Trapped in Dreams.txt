A deep but troubled slumber
From which I could not wake
Dreams and visions grip me
Like the coils of a snake
See the rising mountains
It's madness they spell
Crimson skies above
From which angels fell
In the night, paralyzed
Evil nightmares, tormenting me
Trapped in dreams; eldritch schemes
I must wake up to be set free
Oh... oh... oh... yeah... yeah...
Swift descending darkness
Swallowing the light
Sorcerers surround me
Perform an evil rite
Vicious monsters rising
From the depths underground
I grip sword and dagger
With courage newly found
In the night, paralyzed
Evil nightmares, tormenting me
Trapped in dreams; eldritch schemes
I must wake up to be set free
Oh... oh... oh... yeah... yeah...
