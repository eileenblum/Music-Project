A dark banner stabs the red sky
Winds of war blow
And armoured fighters march on
Heavy are the hearts of men

Voices silent, unbroken the sound
Of chain mail and shield
Under the red sun of Mars
And the ominous flights above

Ravens fly
Birds of doom
Kill or die
Battles loom

Warriors to the slaughter holding their swords
Warriors marching to die

Dark grim helmets never turn back
Ravens caw, dead eyes will be pecked tonight
Relentless the gods of war

Drums will pound
Steel will sing
Dreadful sound
Fatal sting

Warriors to the slaughter holding their swords
Warriors marching to die

The Ravensire holds up the sign
All about it the fray will be chaos unleashed
But forward to the end we march

March on
