Since time immemorial man has prayed to the gods
Carving altars sacrificing to avert disgrace
Statues have been sculpted to the blind goddess of luck
But nothing will prevent the course of Fatum god of fate

Fate is unyielding
Fate did decide
Relentless god whose rule is law
By which even gods abide

Fate is inexorable

Fate will crush your life
Or fate will place you on a throne
To triumph you must fight
But you can't triumph on your own

Fate is inexorable

You cannot cower you must suffer
The arrows and slings
And you may yet receive the prizes
That good fortune brings

The ancient sisters weave the threads
Dictate your destiny
You walk the road that leads to glory
Or fatality

Fate is inexorable

And if you have the strength
For taking your life in your hands
Maybe fate will smile upon you
Before your journey ends

To gods above for love and bliss you may wish to pray
But maybe only fate's the one that truly leads our way

What hold the hands of fate?

"Ducunt uolentem fata, nolentem trahunt"
[Cicero]
