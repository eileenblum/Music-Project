Taken down below where the decadent assemble
To the hole whose name makes all gladiators tremble
The place where slaves are crushed and fed to human beasts
The caverns made of iron like the shackles on my wrists

Iron pits
Sand made of ground bone
Iron pits
I stand to fight alone
Iron pits
Where savagery dictates
Iron pits
Who lives to cross the gates

The darkness foul and primal holds torches flickering
Specks of diseased lighting circling the ring
Arena drenched in blood where gods of death abide
Where if one survives only strength and speed decide

One day I'll kill the tyrants I'll wield the iron blades
Laugh as I behead them and watch as their life fades
But now there's just a whirlwind of swords that clash and sing
And a longing for the glory that my victories will bring
Bludgeoning and slashing, screaming as I maim
To live beyond this horror is my one and only aim
With sinew, bone and blood, with strength and skill and wits
I'll fight to slay and vanquish and rise from the iron pits
