A life spent walking dusty paths
Twixt endless realms to roam
A cave upon a windswept crag
Was for a while my home

I swam a channel full of sharks
And climbed the steepest walls
And I saw phantoms gleam at night
And I heard their eerie calls

Upon a blacksmith's anvil
I have seen the sparks fly mad
And often since my sword's blade
Has been painted bloody red

Golden spires blazing
Beneath a baking sun
And dark valleys were witness
To the wanderings I have done

"And I have known a deathless queen
In a city old as death,
Where towering pyramids of skulls
Her glory witnesseth.
Her kiss was like an adder's fang,
With the sweetness Lilith had,
And her red-eyed vassals howled for blood
In that City of the Mad."

I sometimes find myself
As if by chance alone
To tread old well-known pathways
Of ancient cobblestone

The air itself whispers to me
My weary bones are sore
So maybe I can spend the night
To then journey evermore

"And I have slain a vampire shape
That drank a black king white,
And I have roamed through grisly hills
Where dead men walked at night.
And I have seen heads fall like fruit
In a slaver's barracoon,
And I have seen winged demons
Fly all naked in the moon."
