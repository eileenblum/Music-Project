Behold, the dark spire looms
Perched upon yon mountain black
Howling winds like furies scream
As if flying to attack

Across the moat's watery depths
Hiding shapes that swim beneath
Jaw-like gaping drawbridge beckons
With dark metal pointed teeth

And I cross
Towards the dark
Beyond the portcullis

Spiders weave their fatal webs
Framed in tragic bony white
And town madmen tell the tales
Of spectres dealing mortal fright

Is the bounty worth the risk
Can a blade kill what is dead
Does the labyrinth hold foes
That lie in wait to cut my head
