When the sun begins to rise
And the mist fades and dies
Night is left behind

On towards a clear sky
In a sea of golden light
I taste the freedom that's mine

I draw the sword
I draw the sword!

Friends now gone are left behind
But I did not run out of time
And I still carry my sword

Winding road where do you lead
Will I triumph, will I bleed
I trust my strength and my speed

I wield the sword
I wield the sword

My own lord
I draw the sword
