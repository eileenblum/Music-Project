To the mire of delusion I was cast
Gnarly trees around me hide the faint monsters of my past

Visions in my mind
Dire warnings of the terrors I may find

Foul beasts that lurk
Deadly in the murk
I must vanquish

All that's left behind
The life that was mine
I relinquish

Distant lightning, death or worse
Fearing neither hex nor curse

Into the night, ready to fight
I walk in this accursed maze
Fighting my fear knowing evil is near
Ever 'til the end of my days

Any time may be the time to die
Mortal weakness the gods are deriding in the sky

Beastly howls I hear
Inhuman throats drawing near

Gust of wind blows
Terror that grows
I suppress

Fear holding sway
Ready to slay
On I press

Twisting pathways, rank damp stench
Knotted root and crooked branch

Into the night, ready to fight
I walk in this accursed maze
Fighting my fear knowing evil is near
Ever 'til the end of my days

Vile forest, deathly gloom
Evil fate, swamp of doom
