Before the gates of Ilion
The bodies of brave warriors lie
We have come from distant lands
To siege and conquer or die

Far above the storm clouds gather
Dark as the high stone walls
We attack never to yield
Until the city falls

And lightning struck from the sky
And we marched to kill or die

Gates of Ilion
Fire burns the sky

Behold the son of Telamon
Fearless, strong, godlike
As he casts a whirling rock
The heir of Priam to strike

Diomedes' charge is deadly
Many men he fells in rage
And the gods walk the fields of battle
As both armies engage

And arrows rained from the sky
And all throats howled the war cry

Gates of Ilion
Fire burns the sky

[Sarpedon's speech:]
My friend, if we could escape this war and live forever without growing old;
If we were ageless, I would not fight on in the first line of battle, nor would I send you to those wars where men attain glory.
But now, a myriad of shapes of death attack us, no mortal man can avoid.
So let's go forward, and bestow glory upon others or conquer it for ourselves!

And lightning struck from the sky
And we marched to kill or die

Gates of Ilion
Fires reach the sky

So many fallen lie dead
So many men to be mourned
And the tears stream down Tethys' face
Of her son's fate she'd been warned

Soon we will cross the gates
In victory to burn and destroy
Forever all men will remember
The fall of the city of Troy
