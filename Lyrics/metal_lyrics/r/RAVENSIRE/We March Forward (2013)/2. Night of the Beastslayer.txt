While gazing at the fire
Hear me, o dark soothsayer
We meet in this moonlit night
Old clairvoyant and beast slayer

No witness to our conclave
But skulls with hollow eyes
Black shadows dance with the flames
And tonight the creature dies

Ready to strike
With torch and steel
The beast in the night
I'll fight and kill

With sword and fire I rise
Tonight the creature dies

I vanish into the black
And mingle with stone and tree
My quest will have but one end
My death or my victory

Ready to strike
With torch and steel
The beast in the night
I'll fight and kill

A flash of the blade
A flaming arc
Will announce my arrival
And ignite the dark
