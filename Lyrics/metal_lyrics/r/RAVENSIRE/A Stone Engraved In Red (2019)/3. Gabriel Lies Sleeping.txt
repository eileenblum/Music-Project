Gabriel lies sleeping
At the edge of the universe
His breath is mighty as the lightning bolt
I the end of time finally at hand as prophesied
And does he dream, the saint, of the time
When angels sinned in revolt

Gabriel lies sleeping
At the edge of the universe
One day his trumpet he will blow in rage
The prophets have revealed
The visions of the end of man's age

Cast down below
Man is lost

Behold the raging fire the wrath of the Sephiroth
Cast down below - man is lost

Uriel's sword of flame
Is men's bane from the hand of God
Creator that once sent down the flood
Apocalyptic fate decreed by the father of all
He who gave life, angered, condemns man of all
Behold the voice
That speaks and destroys

Behold the raging fire the wrath of the Sephiroth
Cast down below - man is lost
