I am the god n the mountain
I am a howling gale
Less evil than good
A half-forgotten tale

Fire of purification
I was gleaming in flame
I drew up my hammer
And the storm came

God of lightning, god of thunder, god of rain
I am frightening, I cause wonder, I soothe pain

I am mist on the mountain
A haven for the beasts
A flash alights the altars
Fire for the priests

Standing on the rocks
High among the clouds
I bring fertile rain
that my land enshrouds

Boar of daring, wisdom spark, eagle flight
Fires flaring in the dark bring the light

Who shapes the weapons at the fires of the forge
Who but, I keeps mysteries under lock
Who rules the dance of the fire orbs
And penetrates with the mightiest cock

God of poets, god of strife, god of skill
I deliver unto life and I kill

Votum solue!
