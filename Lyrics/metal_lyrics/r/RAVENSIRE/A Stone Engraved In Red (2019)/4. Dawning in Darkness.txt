Gazing at the horizon, awaiting a new day
I accuse my doom, in this godforsaken place
On a barren field I lie, still, my mind astray
All alone and shattered, my fate I must embrace

When the ghoul cries
The night will never die
Howling up to the sky
Dawning in darkness - I rise

Yet no solace will I find when the morning comes
Demons lurk beyond, far away I hear their drums
And I'm cloaked in darkness, perpetual black void
Ready to take on the hunt, I won' rest 'til they're destroyed

When the ghoul cries
The night will never die
Howling up to the sky
Dawning in darkness - I rise

The vertigo of the chase
I hide in opaque shades
Evil I despise
Still the gloom light and hope fades

When the ghoul cries
The night will never die
Howling up to the sky
Dawning in darkness - I rise

Cast in an endless trap, my mind yields to despair
No amount of death that's left makes it easier to bear

Nightmare eternally, insanity is there for me
Swallowed by misery, shining light again will I see
