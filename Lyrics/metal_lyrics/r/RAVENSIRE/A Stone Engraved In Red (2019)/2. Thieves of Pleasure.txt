I evoke the dawn
Of a thousand years of longing
Whose light caressed the walls
Of the city I was born in

The summer breeze was warm
In Alshelb towards the west
And peaches round as breasts
Invited calm and rest

Red lips
Holding secrets
Fan the flames
Of desire

Eyes with lashes
Thieves of pleasure
Ignite the blood to burn like fire

Stricken by the plectrum
Their ouds' strings deftly played
Filled the air with songs
That spread throughout the glade

Red lips holding secrets
Flames stirred by a fan
As water stirs the sense
Of the thirsty man

Flies the hawk
Over forests
Open wings
High above

Eyes with lashes
Thieves of pleasure
Oh, beware the burns of love

Warriors strong as lions
Not as dangerous, still
As women whose curved hips
Can subdue strength and will

The summer breeze was warm
In Alshelb towards the west
And peaches round as breasts
Invited calm and rest

Red lips
Holding secrets
Fan the flames
Of desire

Eyes with lashes
Thieves of pleasure
Ignite the blood to burn like fire
