Far from the west with sword and spear
I came to Karnag, I travelled here
I walk amongst the stones aligned
And spirit voices resound in my mind

There are men living their final night
Honour gods through sacrifice
Some brood with no hope, some gasp in fright
Threefold death, fire and ice

Insatiable is Toranos' altar
Before it men stumble and falter
The wooden giant shall be their urn
Voices in horror scream as they burn

The stones of Karnag witness this night
Honour gods through sacrifice
Cruel and blood lustful this hallowed might
Threefold death, fire and ice

The smoke is rising up to the sky
The fate of men, to live and to die
I walk amongst the stones aligned
And spirit voices resound in my mind

The stones of Karnag witness this night
Honour gods through sacrifice
Cruel and blood lustful this hallowed might
Threefold death, fire and ice
