Now that even the echoes of the battle clamour died
My dying eyes gaze above up to the pouring sky
The blood soaked earth receives the drops like tears the clouds now cry

After the battle - all is past
After the battle - I have died
After the battle - long for
After the battle - a wild horse to ride

Whatever is true, the deed is done, in war we fought and fell
Maybe domes of gold await or just the depths of hell
Bur now is come our day of doom, here our lives were spent
Good or bad we fought to death - there's nothing to repent

After the battle - all is past
After the battle - I have died
After the battle - long for
After the battle - a wild horse to ride

Broken swords and shattered shields upon a crimson plain
Far above the field I see the ravens come for us
Life drains away I sink a dream
I see a stone engraved in red
And my sons and their sons will drink to memory and name

Whatever is true, the deed is done, in war we fought and fell
Maybe domes of gold await or just the depths of hell
Bur now is come our day of doom, here our lives were spent
Good or bad we fought to death - there's nothing to repent

After the battle - all is past
After the battle - I have died
After the battle - long for
After the battle - a wild horse to ride
