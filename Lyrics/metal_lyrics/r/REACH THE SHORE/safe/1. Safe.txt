Safe about what? Safe about who?
Kiss me on my left cheek, my right's already bruised
Safe about them, or maybe safe about you?
Are they a mass, or maybe just a few?

They're swearing, you'll bow your heads again
(lockdown the city)
You'll hide behind your windowpanes
They're decreeing, you'll shut your mouths again
(lockdown the city)

Think twice about a demagogic speech
There should be nothing pernicious, but the truth is hard to preach
Think twice and the prey may become the hunter
Think about respecting your claims, and think beyond the shutter
Think twice about a demagogic speech
There should be nothing pernicious, but the truth is hard to preach
Think twice and the prey may become the hunter
Think about respecting your claims and how we're supposed to feel
