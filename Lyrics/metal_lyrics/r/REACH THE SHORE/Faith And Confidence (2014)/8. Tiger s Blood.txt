[feat. Adrien Schockert]I am just feeding scavengers
I am only a few remains
I wonât let it go
All these souls that built meâ¦

â¦and those that have caused my loss
I cursed their souls
Painless and valueless
They will be pillars of my grave

Go on, eat my flesh
Let it choke you
Crows and hyenas
Let it turn your stomach
Dogs and vultures
Taste your own harm

But I didnât worry
About my own life

Their vigilance should not subside cause
Iâm suffering so Iâm alive

Even if he stumbles,
A man on the edge of the death
Is still alive [2x]

Donât beg me to move
To prove youâre right
My bodyâs not a burden
Itâs a detail

Those who have dropped me
Will dive with me

I will not let them suffer
Those who matter to me
I will keep them away from me

Because,
Even if he shivers
A man on the edge of the death
Will still remember
Will still love
(LOVE)
