[feat. JÃ©rÃ©miah Zeghers]Break.

I can hear a voice
Thatâs howling my name
Dividing myself like love was hate

Making me dig up tearing nails
&amp; bring me to strain

Burning my brain
That canât merge
Forcing me to wince
Prevents me since

My tongue is attracted to the razor edge
Iâm holding my hands, Iâm biting my lips
&amp; Iâm thirsty of a balance
Oh if I could leave

Stuck in a demonâs jaw
Disguised as my twin
The wounds are staining the grins while ego is killing humility

Why, the link is raw
While the others seem so quiet
So peaceful

Denial breeds denial
Iâm trying to repulse

The hell thatâs in my head
Common sense is becoming a fucking glitch

Face the fierce
Who wreak havoc

Oh, the mind drifter is collapsing
All endeavor is failing

I canât remember
What was once
The young sane
Before I become a Janus

If you could pick up my pieces
And get me closer to the brightness
Give me peace in me

What if I was wrong?
I should accept my entire being
The bastard and the brave

Self acceptance is freeing up
And even behind the storm and rain
The sun will still rise, here.
Will still rise, here.
