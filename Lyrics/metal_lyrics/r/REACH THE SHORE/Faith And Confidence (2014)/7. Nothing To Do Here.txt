It's time to leave
Finally be myself
I'll discard the rest
As free as I was down yesterday
No more duty, no more chore
All these burdens are just
Pieces of shit
I was smiling with a dagger on the throat
I let myself die with no will and no desire
But i found out
My own reason to live
A loss of time
I had chosen neither
Vice nor virtue
I chose not to choose
But I killed myself to reborn as I had always wanted to be
I betrayed the gift of my life
It's time to leave
Finally be myself
I'll discard the rest
As free as I was down yesterday
Finally be myself
I'll discard the rest
I never knew what it's like to be okay
I've rejected my own boring heaven
I'd rather be in harsh reality
And live now
I've rejected my own boring heaven
I'd rather be in harsh reality
I swear to never relive those days
I will not let time take its course
Take its course
