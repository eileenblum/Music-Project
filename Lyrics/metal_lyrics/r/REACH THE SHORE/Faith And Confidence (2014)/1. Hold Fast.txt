Sometimes I let myself
Be taken by distress and despondencies
I will not drift away
Not now not here

And even if we never perceive the cliffs
Hold fast
Hold fast
And even if we never feel the breeze
Hold fast
Hold fast

I will not hit the bottom
As Iâm not dead
I will still be aware

I will not hit the bottom
As Iâm not dead
I will still be aware
(And hold fast)
