I saw &amp; I felt

Make this affecting
Make this real
Reconsider these last hours

Ups and downs
Made us grow up
They opened our eyes

Question yourself!

When we are lying
Donât drink my words
When I am smiling
Donât try to see through my eyes
I saw &amp; I felt

What can stir my heart
And I canât find it in a bed
I canât find it with anyone

I thought I could force myself
To make this relationship more than what it is

All our expectations of us
Lead only to a misconception
No spark lights in me
No bird sings on us

This great charm would not be enough for me
Youâll never actually understand
What I am

An empire in the sheets
But a beggar in the heart
Everything you brought me withers me away

A man who loved
A cursed man
I understand you blame me

But nothing tickles my knees
Nothing in you reminds me of her

Now you know
That there is no lust in love
