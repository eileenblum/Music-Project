If you have enough conscience
Deny the fate

All I would like to have
All I would like to be
I donât want it to appear
In an other way
Than my hands, than my sweat
Kneel and hope other than yourself
An easier way, a wrong way

(A path without pitfalls)

Old men listen to a preacher and are
Convinced not to believe in themselves
Money crashing down the stone
Poor mother coins for a healing wind
All this will for gods of straw

A consciousless line of people
Falling from the cliff shrine

Seek out for the gold
Seek out for the greatness
Bones to create an ornate shrine
Ashes and drops to feed the gods

All I would like to have
All I would like to be
I donât want it to appear
In an other way
Than my hands, than my sweat
In a world forged by tales and myths

An endless circle
A perfect play
Ashes and drops
To feed the gods

Tear down the idols
Melt the gold
A new pattern of life
For this age of wisdom

I can believe in hope
But I will host the confidence
