Here we go

I have guts not to fear
Of whatâs in my head that tries to change
My life, my mind and my purpose
I will trust my senses
And my forebodings

Am I trying to provoke
A process of dreaming
Sleeping is seeing
And dreaming my new faith

People just want to know
But they avoid understanding

My memories always seem more beautiful
And I crystallize my past
I thought I could lock myself in
And hide the truth (and hide the truth)

And I try to keep in mind
That I am a sinner and wrongful
Knowing who I am
Will be my ataraxia

I feel I donât want to
Sleep in a fucking solace
I can foil my head and finally trust my eyes
Finally get my head out of the clouds
Dreams are what I had refused to value
I donât belong to any of them

I am a creature of will
I am a seeker of what I really am

I have guts not to care
Of whatâs in my head that tries to change

I will trust my senses
And my forebodings [x2]
