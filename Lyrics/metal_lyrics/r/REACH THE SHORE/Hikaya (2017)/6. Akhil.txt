Tell me why isolation means nothing to me 
I don't know how to express
That I appreciate every time air fills my lungs

Look and watch but don't interpret my smile
Because nothing could capture my feelings better

Maybe you're seeing empty hands 
Cause your soul is white and mine is full of colours
But they lived to pull my head out of the sand
Maybe one day your sky will be clearer

Learn the difference between used and worn
The world is ancient, where simplicity rhymes with utility

Erase it all with open arms to the world
Through the keyhole you've only seen some dust and stones 

I could lay out the unknown in your mind
Erase all the doubt that makes you blind
I'm no more a bird than you're a creep
Could I be heard before you fall asleep?

This is my path, my way to be happier
Don't call me fatalist because I accept death with life

Erase it all with open arms to the world
Through the keyhole you've only seen some dust and stones 
Fulfil yourself, don't stay alone
Jaded and dazed
And create your own wealth

May the wind parch my tongue
May water stop feeding me [2x]
