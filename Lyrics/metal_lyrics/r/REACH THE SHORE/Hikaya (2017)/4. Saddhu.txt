We've seen this once before
We broke the olive branch, broke and hoped to make our spirit soar
We dug deep into this trench, dug deep to meet our own grave

Sing me another moral fable and teach me how to walk
Straight in the eye now tell me, now tell meâ¦

What's the point to salt this earth?
Your flaws destroyed your mother
What's the point to take an oath?
Another decoy to play the beggar

Tell me, are you concerned?
Tell me, oh tell me what you learned
Lie to me, once again my brothers

I know, I know that it doesn't make sense to you
I will enlighten our lands and discern what were true

We were gods, we were exiled
When the moist air wrapped us like his child
Now bring us back our smile

Let's see how our limbs hold up down in here
Be fair and let us make one more thing clear

What's the point to salt this earth?
Your flaws destroyed your mother
What's the point to take an oath?
Another decoy to play the beggar

Tell me, are you concerned?
Tell me, oh tell me what you learned
Lie to me, once again my brothers

From one human to humanity
I'll try my best, I'll die without any rest
I'll ravage the hate and restore the decayed
To feel at peace
