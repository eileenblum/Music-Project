Without knowing when
Without knowing where you stand
How could you be what you need to be
Surrounded by threats
Inflicted by desires
I could place some bets
While your heart is pierced with spires

Raise your head and find a purpose
Amid a mist of grunts and sobs
If your senses are doubtful then know 
That the only truth reigns in your sorrow

Velvet and emerald
The fate of abundance stays ephemeral
In hell or in heaven
You will get what you're given

I'm not blaming you
For putting wrong names on what you don't understand

Raise your head and find a purpose
Amid a mist of sweets and words
But in the end, as you'll be nervous
You'll run through those wards

You'll run in a circle
You'll crawl on marble

Let them stroke your hair
Nothing could be easier 
Oh if your eyes could only see the best in you 
More than pride, cherish your sins
This is what you've decided to do

Here is no innocence
Only a feast of ignorance
Here is no penitence
Only a beast in your presence

And if you're seeking for a foe
He's hiding in your mind
A bastard born in you
An instinct moving down your spine

Let them stroke your hair
Nothing could be easier
Oh if your eyes could only see the best in you 
More than pride, cherish your sins
This is what you've decided to do

Now run
