Refresh yourself under a cascade of bodies and sweat
Let's play through a swamp to watch the moon set

I live when your blood runs like hunted deers
I live when the aftermath dies in your tears

Keep taking me as a saviour
Since violence is your favourite flavour

Lie to others, lie to yourself
Watch me, burning your candle
Lie to others, lie to yourself
Watch me build a truth that you can't handle

The veil is dancing with the wind of substances
My whispers are creating devotees
Eyes of the world can now admire who you really are
A rotten fruit devouring itself like a dying star

Keep spinning around into my web
Let it impede your vows

Lie to others, lie to yourself
Watch me, burning your candle
Lie to others, lie to yourself
Watch me build a truth that you can't handle

The veil is dancing with the wind of substances
My whispers are creating devotees
Eyes of the world can now admire who you really are
A rotten fruit devouring itself like a dying star

I am three, three trees that have grown
In a garden beneath your skin
I am the light in the shadow of the unknown
I am king in the realm of sin [2x]

I am king in the realm of sin [2x]
