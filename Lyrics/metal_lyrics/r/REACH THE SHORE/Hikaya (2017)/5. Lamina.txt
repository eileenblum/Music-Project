Under the ground where creatures lick my wounds
Before I run down, blurred by some sounds
The Ariane's thread in the palm of my hand
Lead me out of this maze where I can't stand [2x]

No lights, no exit
Sun's warmth is what I covet
Holy spirits, holy corners
Make me juggle from tears to anger

Left or right, I don't know what to fight
Up or down, now I see my own legs drown
My claws have to hang on to the crest
Cause I still feel strength deep inside of my chest
