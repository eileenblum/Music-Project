I could use so many words to tell you
That we kept the flame alive and made everything eternal

I chose a path and made it mine 
I chose a path and made it mine 

Like our idols, we created stories in our images

The inkwell cries for nothing
We wrote the tragedy, we wrote the signs
The inkwell cries for nothing
Because we were too blind to read between the lines

As brief as a sigh
As familiar as a story you've always had in your mind

We shiver every time we remember that everything has an end
We lose time forcing destiny

The inkwell cries for nothing
It will always cry
