Falling under
You feel no pain
Seeing black
You know the hate
Losing grace
But no one cries
Venomous trap
This pain of mine

Deprived devotion
You feel no pain
Spine in fits
You know the hate
Taking shape
But no one cries
No escape
This pain of mine

Feel emotion
Is this your potion?
Destroying everyone's motion - and you
See your own fears
See your own truth
Discover everyone lies [x2]

Sound relief
You feel no pain
Years of peace
You know the hate
Hate of you
But no one cries
You make me spew
This pain of mine

Falling under
Never hate another but you
Seeing black
You've aimed to drop me before now
Losing grace
You've tried before but failed
Venemous trap
I can't cry

[CHORUS (x2)]

[CHORUS (x2)]

Destruction begins again
Our lives are changed a little more
I'd like to see you but I'd like to pretend
That I loved you it had to end
You destroyed your life a little more
So the pain you just turned to bore
I'm sick of you in me
Get the fuck right out of my life

Don't want you fucking with my head
I'll take you out
Don't want to fuck with my head
I'll take you out
Don't want you fucking with my head
I'll take you out
Don't want you fucking with my head
I'll take you out

So I held my head in shame
Bitter cries defy your game
Don't try to play your fuckin' shit
In time I'll disagree
So I held my head in shame
Bitter cries defy your game
Don't try to play your fuckin' shit
In time I'll disagree

[REPEAT CHORUS]

You know I'll fuckin' deny

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Destruction begins again
So I held my head in shame
Our lives are changed a little more
Bitter cries defy your gane
I'd like to see you but I hate to pretend
Don't try to play, you fuck shit
That I loved you, it had to end
So I held my head in shame!

Broken fingers are justice
Taking baby for rides
You left me so lonely
That's why Im standing here
Ripping my insides out

You see me running and you feel hatred
This is the feeling I get every day
You throw the petrol and the matchstick
You stupid fuck you forgot to light it

I see you hiding in the shadow
With all the fear and twisted pain
I hear you running 'cause your footsteps cry
You only ever talk because it's too late
Slight invasion of death you brought me
You'll never take me away
I used to love you but it's just no fun
I feel it done inside me

Take me away
Far away
Take me away
Far away

[REPEAT VERSE 2]

[REPEAT CHORUS]

And now you hate because you're just a swine
I see you run because you're just a swine
And now I'm hiding because you're just a swine
And now I'm running because you're just a swine [x2]

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Take me away
Far away...

Death only through the eyes of your mind
Watching no one
Slowly turning around
Disrespectful
This is no one clear
Distant hearing
Death only because I'm wrong
Fucking whore

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Kill the insane [x2]

You always let me fall astray
So love will fear all
How many lies will you tell today
Distant vision
Your lonely eyes were so thoughtful then
Lethal hearing
'Cause your side was dominant
Your fear for fear

[REPEAT VERSE 1]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
