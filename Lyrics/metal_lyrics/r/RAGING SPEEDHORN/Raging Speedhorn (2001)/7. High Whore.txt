Such power in concrete tone
Such violence but I already know
I wouldn't tell you, you gotta let it go
I wouldn't show you, you really wanna know
You're so tricky, you've got to let it go
You're so pretty, you've got to let it show
Fuck this - I want my own show
I cry just to let them know

So why'd you have to pretend
To what's going on
Reap more havoc from our future
Or what's left inside
Get on your high whore
Never trust in me
Get on our high whore
Never believe me
Get on your high whore

[REPEAT VERSE 1]

Angry voices now
They are looking round
Before the anger takes me
Or what's left inside
Get on your high whore
Never believe me
Get on your high whore
Never trust in me
Get on your high whore
Never believe me
Get on your high whore

You lie
We hide

Broken promise leaded vapour
My life
Despise
Vices calling me dragging me under

Dragging me under!
This darkness brings out Marcus
And my evil side
I try to recognise
And conceal
The fucking pain
My evil pain
Don't feel the same
You can come
And feel my pain

[REPEAT BRIDGE 1 (x2)]

...And out comes Marcus
Screaming with claws
Fighting all with violent cause
And screaming
Get on your high whore
Get on your high whore
Your high whore


In your eyes [x7]
