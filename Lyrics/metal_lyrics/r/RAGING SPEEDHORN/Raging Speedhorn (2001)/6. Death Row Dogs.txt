I realise you're not the only fuck
I fear all I am pain
This angel seen as devil
Such pain must be desired
Before time
This is the hand that pushes you under
This is the hand that keeps you there
While most of them are fucking you over
I'm dreaming of watching you drown

You're just a sacramental item
You kinda wanna fight them
Straight through me like a rake
Am I your one night mistake?
All because I lie
All because I blind
All the evil I hide
All the lies I wrong

You face stares at me
So fuckin' ugly
Ugly
You terrorize my children
Get out my sight slut
I'm out of my mind
Wandering slowly
Sabbath begins
They creep beside me
Holding the blade
Never again
Succumb to my temple
I see you
You livin' in me
Know you hate me
Never look in your eyes
Killin' life

Give me frustration
No Surprise

You're still standing
With my soul
Fuck your eating
From my skull
So what the fuck am I decide
Deny do what the feeling bides
You and hate
So what the fuck have I done to be
Shit like a broken mind
You and me
So what am I supposed to do
When I'm falling behind
You and hate
And what it's all worked out to be
Where it's you in my mind

You're still standing
With my soul
Fuck your eating
With my skull...
