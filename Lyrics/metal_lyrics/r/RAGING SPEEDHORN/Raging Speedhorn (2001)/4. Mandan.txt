One last chance and you will see
You're will belong
No one cares enough for me
You're in my eyes
Distance built between you and me
Never again
One last chance and you will see
You always lie
I can't cry and deny
Don't fuckin' lie to me
You will laugh and I will die
You're always fuckin' fake
No one cares, it's you or me
Never again with you
It's all fucked and you can see
You only lie

No more tomoroow - fuckin' lie
Yourself alone
No more tomorrow - your life's a lie
Screaming because...

One last chance and you will see
You're in my eyes
There's no time for you and me
Don't fuckin' lie
There's no smell and you can tell
Never again
You are not in my cell
Your open lie
Distance built between you and me
You always lie to me
Time has gone and I can't see
You fuckin' piece of shit
This is not enough for me
You always lie to me
No one knows what you will be
Your fuckin' bleed

[REPEAT CHORUS]

What do I know, I will not follow
Screaming because, I will not follow
Faces unknown, I will not follow
Know what you know, I will not follow

Loser!
Will not fuckin' be denied!

What do I know, you're always angry
Faces are known, you're always angry
Bitches will come, you're always angry
Know what you say, you're always angry
Feelings allow, you're always angry
Pictures of me, you're always angry
Screaming so hard, you're always angry
Pictures of you, you're always angry

Tosser!
You will never be denied!

Screaming so hard, you'll always be denied
Known all my life, you'll always be denied
Known all my life, you'll always be denied
Screaming so hard, you'll always be denied
Screaming so hard, you'll always be denied
Pictures of you, you'll always be denied
Bitches for me, you'll always be denied
Bitches for me, you'll always be denied
Fuck for your own
