Now I can see the thunder
You disrespect my blunder
We slide into another
And fake like we are brothers
Your fire
Deny it
You're so sick
For power

I've seen the hate that you bring
I've been the fate that you sing
You're my disgrace
You're my insane
You're the blood
That burns in my head

Now I can see the thunder
You disrespect my blunder
We slide into another
And fake like we are brothers
Your vengeance
And preference
Fucked this up
Not again

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[REPEAT VERSE 1]

Your fire
You fuckin' rise all
Such power
I'm disappearing
For fuck's sake
Bleed me dry
Born stubborn
Fuck this way

You fuckin' rise all
This is the fuckin' craze
I'm disappearing
See through the eyes of your disguise

The dead existance
Your fire
Nobody hears me
For power
The dead are crying
This is a fine line
Desire I'm singing
Can't touch you
I spread much lies
Your fire
We're in disguise
Before I load it up and go!
