Your sore eyes

Dragging me down
Before my eyes
Fuck this dream
It's not reality
Go!

Knives cut through fist and faces
Only one victim next to you
Knives cut through fists and faces
Only one victim next to you

Difference build
From stick and bone
Lick the blade
Let blood surround

[CHORUS (x2)]

Take me
To another place
Falling motionless
In Voids
Before I better recognise
Disguise lies broken

Angry
Bitter knives twisting
Deeper mind flaws
Controlling you concious
Don't follow
Just turn away
Back to the other ones
Inside you burning it
So long discomfort
Mind speaks to me anyway
Open and licking up
Your face in pieces
Angry and fuckin' up
Fingers bleed from touching

Why'd you have to be so hard of hearing

When you know I'm right
Because you're fuckin' wrong
Because you know
You know
You know
You're fuckin' right
Fuck
