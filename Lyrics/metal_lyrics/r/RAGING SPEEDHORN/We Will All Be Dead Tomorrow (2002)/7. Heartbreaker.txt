I tried to be someone
Feelings that I left behind
Tried to take it
Before you're mine
Now we must go
Can't be someone else
Lost in nothing
This time we lose it all

(Now) I tried to be someone
(I fucking hate you) Feelings that I left Behind
(You) tried to take it
(Said you loved me) Before you're mine
(Hell) Now we must go
(Freezes over) Can't be someone else
(The sun) Lost in nothing
(Goes supernova) This time we lose it all

(Hell) Now we must go
(Freezes over) Can't be someone else
(The Sun) Lost in nothing
(Goes Supernova) This time we lose it all
[REPEAT]
