You will be dead tomorrow
If you don't read the signs
You tried to break the law
By kicking ass and getting high

[CHORUS]
(Good times)
We gotta drink some more alcohol
Whiskey and wine
(Good times)
A good smoke is all I want
The chronic youth
Fuck you, we're drunk and proud
God save the chronic youth

You said you loved to party
Bullshit you know you don't
You say you've got a problem
Get high until you don't

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Get the fuck up, back the fuck up
God save the chronic youth!
Get the fuck up, back the fuck up
God save the chronic youth!
(Cry!) The chronic youth! [x2]
We are the chronic youth! [x4]
Get the fuck up, back the fuck up
One bang and your eyes are dry
Get the fuck up, back the fuck up
One sip and you're pissed and high!
