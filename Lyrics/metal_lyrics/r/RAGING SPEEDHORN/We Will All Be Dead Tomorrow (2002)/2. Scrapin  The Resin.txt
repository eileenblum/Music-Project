You have found the wizard
But he tried to hide
It can hide from no one
Fucking up your mind

[CHORUS]
No one takes it away - scrapin' it
You can reach for the sight - scrapin' it
And your eyes are open - scrapin' it
Now mix up the hype

You will be someone
The pipe that burns your throat
The resin we scraped from the hash pipe
Fucked up and so damn high

We like your resin - we did it our way
We like your weed - must be some way
Fucked up on something - they did it our way
Makes my throat bleed
Smoke the mother fucker

[REPEAT CHORUS x3]

You can smoke with me son - we did it our way
Now the trouble's begun - must be some way
Never alone on my own - they did it our way
Starving and so fucking stoned
Drop the mother fucker

Want to be like - no one
Now you're someone - fuck you
Want to be like - nothing
Now you're someone - you will never take it
Fucking whore

Do not try to beat on me
Nothing left for you to see
Now I'm sick of your ride
All the shit I hold inside

You will not be surprised
You will not be surprised
You will not be surprised
Never again

Do not try to beat on me
Nothing left for you to see
Now I'm sick of your ride
All the shit I hold inside

Here I am I'm all alone
Nothing left for me to own
Here it is to take from me
Take it now it's fucking free

You will not be surprised
You will not be surprised
You will not be surprised
Never again
