I hate you all
Because you're free
Can't hear what you say to me
Get fucked, don't scratch my back
Stay the fuck away from me

I hate them all
For what they've done to me
All lies, where did the money go?
Hope you choke on your brandy
Big friends, but you're stepping back
When the shit hits the fan

[CHORUS]
Hate! This song is for you
Hate! You never thought we knew
Hate! This song is for you
Hate! And now we're back

To set the record straight
Don't want to do this now
How about if I kill them all?
You helped me get through this
By telling lies and faking all
What the fuck?

You never give me the time of day
You'll never fucking take my life
Don't want to be like you
Not so great to be you
Just fuck off, you don't own me
I'm sick of having all this

[REPEAT CHORUS]
