Twenty pints today
And we're on the way
It's in his curse
He's the voodoo man
I only drank it
Put his curse on me (Put his curse on me)
Changed my blood for alcohol
Try to set me free (Set me free)
He's a voodoo man
With blackened hands
He's a voodoo man
Selling my soul

Fuck the voodoo man
Fuck the voodoo man, he's angry
Gonna make you pay
Gonna fuck your mind
Gonna sell your soul
Gonna take it away
He's a voodoo man

Fuck the voodoo man [x7]

I only drank it
Put his curse on me (Put his curse on me)
Changed my blood for alcohol
Try to set me free (Set me free)
He's a voodoo man
With blackened hands
He's a voodoo man
Selling my soul

Fuck the voodoo man!

Put his curse on me - Try to set me free
Fuck the voodoo man - I only drink it
Fuck the voodoo man - Put his curse on me
Fuck the voodoo man - Changed my blood for alcohol
Fuck the voodoo man - Try to set me free

Fuck the voodooman [x4]
