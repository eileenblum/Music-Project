Don't you want me to be?
Try to be you it's not right
Destroy it all before
This is the end once more
Taking of innocence
Wanting of innocence

[CHORUS]
You will fall below line (Abort the love)
The pain which we all know (Crucify)
Now you come to my world (Sacrifice)
The pain will swallow you whole (Fuck your mind)

Destroy it all before
This is the end once more
Ask me nothing - fuck that
Time has come now - fuck off

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Why, Why - Fuck
Why - You lie
Why - Destroy
Why - And fuck your mind
Why - Die
Why - your life
Why - Fuck you

Now you come to my world (Sacrifice)
The pain will swallow you whole (Crucify)

Now you take me
Such a loser
Fuck your mother
Nothing for you
