In search of knives
Kill the losers
More to life
What changed the young man's mind?
Come with me
Run from me

[CHORUS]
As its me and you man
Minds in darkness
Eat the cake and you lose your mind
Can't believe it's fucking happening
One slice and you're feeling high
Ate too much I nearly died
More Jack it'll be OK
Can't believe it's fucking happening
Still stoned it's another day

In search of knives
Kill the losers
More to life
What changed
Come with me
Run from me

[REPEAT CHORUS]

We search for truth
Picked the wrong day
If life's the question
Is death...
The answer?
The answer?
The answer?
The answer?

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Me and you man!
