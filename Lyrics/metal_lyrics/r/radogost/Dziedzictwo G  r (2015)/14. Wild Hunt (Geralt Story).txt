They all think I'm weird
They want to dominate me
Why did I shed my blood for them?
Since they believed it is tainted?

Every night the past chases me
Witchers domain and fear
I've got to rise my sword again
It's the war for purity of flame

I survived all attempts
So many wound so many graves
Monsters live inside you
And that's the bitter truth

Murderer! Freak!
You call me!

Constant eternal fight (eternal fight)
For honor for power for fame
Always on bloody path (bloody path)
Between hatred and flames

Blaze and betrayal
That's all that I can find
It's time to draw my sword
Strait towards wild hunt

Strait towards wild hunt
Towards wild hunt
Strait towards wild hunt
Yeah!
