[music: Å. Muschiol, M. Wieczorek; lyrics: M. Wieczorek]

The old man had predicted the death of mine
I mocked him over a pint of beer
Now ravens fly over the battlefield
Black eyes looking at me

Treacherous arrow cut the thread
Sword finished the rest
The grass is red with my blood
Christian tore my chest

Goodbye my brothers, goodbye companions
Iâm leaving the bosom of Perun
Remember my name, remember my courage
I go along with the moon

Hordes of enemies came from the west
They brought us to their god
All sacred fires were extinguished
We know that they are mad

Enough is enough, we reached for swords
We took prayers to Swantewit
And went to the battle, a hundred to thousands
But nothing was agreed

Goodbye my brothers, goodbye companions
Iâm leaving the bosom of Perun
Remember my name, remember my courage
I go along with the moon

There remaind only mound and song
Courage lost in the night
Sing bard about the Slavs
Theyâre still alive and fight!
Sing bard about the Slavs
Theyâre still alive and fight!

Goodbye my brothers, goodbye companions
Iâm leaving the bosom of Perun
Remember my name, remember my courage
I go along with the moon
