[music: Å. Muschiol; lyrics: M. Wieczorek]

They are coming great and mighty
I must flee, I have to hide
They want to take me to death and fires
All my faith I have to fling aside

I can be paid
For forests of this land
And even moreâ¦
But not for war!

Recruiting lists are already sent
But I fuck it now!
I want to live! I donât want to die
For someoneâs whims, for social class

I can be paid
For forests of this land
And even moreâ¦
But not for war!

Bloodthirsty troops are ready
But it is not for me
Not for me
Itâs never been
For me

You can chop me in pieces
You can burn me in fire
I can give my life for forest
I can give my life for lore
Not for war
Never more

You can chop me in pieces
You can burn me in fire
I can give my life for forest
I can give my life for lore
Not for war
Never more
Not for war
Never more
âNoâ for war
