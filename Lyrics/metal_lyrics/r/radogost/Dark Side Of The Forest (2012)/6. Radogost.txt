[music: Å. Muschiol; lyrics: M. Wieczorek]

Itâs time you took the challange
Because thatâs what you were born
Sacred knife is waiting for you
Narrow path cowerded with thorns

Swear allegiance once again
Lords of the moon and the sun
You have to stand in the darkness
Ritual has just begun

Here comes the old god â itâs Radogost
Eternal power â great Radogost
Now and forever will shine his axe
Itâs your salvation, your only fate!

No father, no mother â youâre son of trees
Your power is magic â feel her dark kiss
Redemption and freedom are in your head
You have to believe and go ahead

Itâs time you took the challange
Because thatâs what you were born
Sacred knife is waiting for you
Narrow path cowerded with thorns

Swear allegiance once again
Lords of the moon and the sun
You have to stand in the darkness
Ritual has just begun

Here comes the old god â itâs Radogost
Eternal power â great Radogost
Now and forever will shine his axe
Itâs your salvation, your only fate!
