[music: Å. Muschiol; lyrics: M. Wieczorek]

In the freezing night, from the darkness and ashes
Iâm cominâ to you, for your greatest treasure
You have no chance, you burn in my fire
In my name â die, my squire!

You believe me immensely â Yes, I spit on it!
Now you kneel before me and wait for the hit!

I will take your soul forever
You have never been too cleverâ¦
Will not help you any tears
Now I come out from the dark

I will take your soul forever
You have never been too cleverâ¦
Will not help you any tears
Now I come out from the dark

I will take your soul forever
You have never been too cleverâ¦
Will not help you any tears
Now I come out from the dark
