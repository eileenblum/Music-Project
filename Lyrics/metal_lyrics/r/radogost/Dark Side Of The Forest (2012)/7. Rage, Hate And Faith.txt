[music: Å. Muschiol, J. MusioÅ; lyrics: M. Wieczorek]

Listen to this â the saga begins
The story of glory, salvation and fear
The old burial mounds know bloody truth
The memory of heroes begins to disappear

They knew only that way:
Rage, hate and faith
There were cursed forever
For rage, hate and faith

Listen to this â the saga begins
Of fire and death, power and pain
Everything is gone, burried in the dust
The one who survived stayed insane

They knew only that way:
Rage, hate and faith
There were cursed forever
For rage, hate and faith

Death, scream, anything is possible
Fires are burning everywhere
Death, scream, anything is possible
Fires are burning everywhere

Life, peace, this is no longer possible
Fires are burning everywhere
Life, peace, this is no longer possible
Fires are burning everywhere

Rage, hate and faith!
Rage, hate and faith!
Rage, hate and faith!
Rage, hate and faith!
