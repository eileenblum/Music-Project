[music: Å. Muschiol; lyrics: M. Wieczorek]

Now itâs time to run
Time to slam the door,
Extinguish all lights
And plug every hole

Her magic emerges from among the trees
Can you feel it? Be careful! It brings disease!

Bloody witch â She lives there in the mighty forest
Every child, terrified, knows this darkest story

Come, my child, sit by the fire, Iâll tell you a joke
I will give you chocolate and even let you smokeâ¦

Oh no, donât touch me!
Now give me your life!
Oh no, please leave me!
Look into my eyes!

Why are you afraid of me? I will sing you song
Then you go to sleep so sweet â it will not be longâ¦

Oh no, where am I?
Stop fucking squirming!
Oh no, Iâm terrify
My knife feels like killing!

Bloody witch â She lives there in the mighty forest

Why are you afraid of me? I will sing you song
Then you go to sleep so sweet â it will not be longâ¦

Oh no, donât touch me!
Stop fucking squirming!
Oh no, please leave me!
My knife feels like killing!
