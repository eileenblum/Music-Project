[PART I: JOURNEY TO DEATH]

I saw this (a) long time in fantasies:
Old chest with gold and white pearls
Whitout it, Iâll never be truly free
Iâm ready for Deadly Race

Hellish creatures lurking there
And many traps to avoid
And in the dungeon old witch lives -
Immortal devils whore

âMany were the daredevils who headed off with the mission to slay the witch and destroy the evil. None of them saved their lives. Mighty infernal magic covered valleys with poisonous mist making the way to the old gloomy castle treacherous and invisible. But even that didnât intimidate the knights. Mislead by the valuable prize, they headed towards certain death.â

What kind of darkness?
Gods help me!
In distance I hear screams
I am so tired
Gods help me!
What kind of fire is there?

[PART II: IN THE CLAWS OF DESTINY]

Welcome, dear warrior
You are my victim!

No one will help you, no one!
Give up your hope forever!
Just let me show you what fear is
Now Iâll teach you pain!

Serve me for ever!
Give me your strength!

[PART III: SCREAM OF TRAGEDY]

Is this the end of my life?
Is this the end of my way?
Hereâs where the desire of gold leads to
What else can I say?

Is this the end of my life?
Is this the end of my way?
Hereâs where the desire of gold leads to
What else can I say?

End of my life
Now I will die
