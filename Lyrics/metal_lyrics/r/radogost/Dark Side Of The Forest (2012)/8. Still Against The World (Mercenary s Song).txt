[music: Å. Muschiol; lyrics: M. Wieczorek]

Price for our heads isnât terrible
Our blades wonât disappear
We walk in the shadows bringing death
We will teach you all about fear

Always strong, always great,
Still against the world
Always ready to fight,
Still against the world

Always strong, always great,
Still against the world
Always ready to drink,
Still against the world

Slowly (the) time will come when the purse will shine
Then weâll go into the battle and no matter why
We will cut and chop, burn and rape, and rob
All the reasons are sufficient, even if theyâre lies

Still against the world

Every day is the same â beer and fight
Everywhere we bring about fear
One bad look and a sword will stab you
We donât heed any tears

Always strong, always great,
Still against the world
Always ready to fight,
Still against the world
Always strong, always great,
Still against the world
Always ready to drink,
Still against the world
