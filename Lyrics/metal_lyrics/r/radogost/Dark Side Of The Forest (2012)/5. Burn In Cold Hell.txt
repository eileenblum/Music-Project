[music: Å. Muschiol; lyrics: M. Wieczorek]

Welcome to the end
Here on fucking Earth
For two thousand years
Here reigned disrespect

In ancient history
There was honor and pride
Now gods sent you
Message on how youâll die

Burn for slander, burn for weakness,
For your damned lies
Burn forever in cold hell, burn alive!

Thereâs no redemption here
No fucking second chance
Just pain remained here
And no forgiveness

Where is your plastic world?
And look â where are you now?
You lose, little man
Your head falls down

Burn for slander, burn for weakness,
For your damned lies
Burn forever in cold hell, burn alive!

You wonât get a second chance -
Only death, only pain

You wonât get a second chance -
Only pain, only death

Burn for slander, burn for weakness,
For your damned lies
Burn forever in cold hell, burn alive!
