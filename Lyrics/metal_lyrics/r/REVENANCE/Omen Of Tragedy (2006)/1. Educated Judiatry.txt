Coming to meet me
Flashlight, gun in hand a big fucking man, plainclothes dt
Throw me against the wall try to touch my balls
I exercise my rights as stated in the 4th amendment
You fucking pig
Minding my own business
Wish I had a witness
Where is your probable cause
Your breaking your own rules and abusing your authority
What makes you any better than me
Possession of a plant which grows from the earth
I ask you who is worse
If you ask me your the fucking criminal abuse of authority
Command by the law to be my protector
And in turn your the predator
If you ask me your the criminal abuse of authority
It will never change
Fuck the police
It will never change
Living in the shadow of the badge is not living my way
Dare I call this freedom
Dare I even say what's in your pocket?
Non of your business
The 4th amendment?
What's in your pocket
Non of your business
The fourth amendment?
Take a piss on it
Scum of the earth
Who are you to tell me what I'm fucking worth
I am a human being
And for this I am strong
You'll never knock me on the fucking ground
Your paycheck comes from my taxes
You can't fucking push me around
I know my rights
You'll never knock me on the fucking ground
Your paycheck comes from my taxes
You can't push me around
Why don't you fuck off now?
I committed no crime
Why don't you fuck off now
It's about that time
