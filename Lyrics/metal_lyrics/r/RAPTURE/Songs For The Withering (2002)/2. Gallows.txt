You drift away in a bitter dusk by scattering the snow that held
Angel-like images in our blurry memories of childhood.
Escaping every when, who or why
Ebony eyes disappeared
I cannot longer bear this as it revels in my misery

If only I didn't care, I'd smile and merrily wave my hand goodbye
My possessions are gone, there is no point to go on
Our foolish intents built my future plans
I can't go forwards or back
I am stuck in a forever dying moment

More ...I sway here forevermore
Until lovely gaia is burnt to the core
You'll find me at the gallows

I sleep by the gallows in complete solitude that I used to cherish
But now my visions are clear and solarsigns in a nebular hill
Cast a fallen morning star right behind me and it sighs:
"you won't feel a thing, it is only great relief
So slit your wrists open by this"

Begone at the silent shores.
Shine on! this is the end of the world
All beauty is lost and so is all you had ever abhorred

And I raise my blindfold gaze
A night mare of ending my life becomes a part of
This miserable joy of reality
To sell my fortune
To leave them all behind
To hide all the trails as I never existed
Nothing remains irrelevant in these murky chambers...
Dark and dismal chambers of agony

A cruel gathering of tragedies lead our way to the dreamscapes
Where they feed the rope by our necks
No feet on this solid soil but a floating silhouette
Against the setting sun
By gravity life force flows slowly away
It is silent at the gallows again
