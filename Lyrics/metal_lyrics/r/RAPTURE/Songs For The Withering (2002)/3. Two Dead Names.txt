One day darkness showed up at my door
Ate the light, closed my world
Told me the demons where here
And that I was wrong
All along

Everything washes away
Fear and despair
Never knew what they meant
Until the black
Came my way

In our full circle
We fed each other
In the fall

In this cold year
That consumed the strength, the will
With so little to hold near

If I was the sky
Would I hold you dear
(or come crashing down)
Two dead names waiting
Two dead names

Reaching out with cold hands
Wishing it would all come together
(in a final infinite white)
Two dead names screaming
Two dead names

"And so I leave this world, where the heart
Must either break or turn to lead."
[Nicolas-Sebastien Chamfort (1741-1794)]
