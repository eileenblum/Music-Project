Here we are
Together in this darkness
Enveloped in the
Deepest shade of black
Connected through this misery
Lingering in the air

The burden of goodbye
A heavy ringing in my ear
It's a silent reminder
An afterthought of sorts

Bad dreams, hollow sleep
Of dark rooms, empty homes
And things without names
Memories of murder
The shades that fell

I wouldn't prefer to answer
The question
The last quiet cord to be
Severed
Nothing to take with you
Nothing left for you to keep

The music is over, there's no-one here
It's snowing heavily
I can't even see my breath escaping
Never to return

"I lingered around them,
Under that benign sky;
Watched the moths fluttering
Among the heath of harebells
Listened the soft wind
Breathing though the grass;
And wondered how anyone
Could ever imagine unquiet slumbers
For the sleepers in the quiet earth."
[Emily Bronte (1818-1848)]
