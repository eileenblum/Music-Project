It was all in the rain
It was in her eyes
Tears dropped in anguish and distress
In the nerves of pain was boiling warmth of grace

We run against the tide, severed with the losses of logic
Love left me unimpressed, I keep on walking the path of tragedy

Let me attend, let me represent
My muse lays dead down on the brimstone row
Wounded night - let your children descend
Arteries cut - now let that inspiration flow

We run against the tide, severed with the losses of logic
Love left me unimpressed, I keep on walking the path of tragedy

Before the last breath - inhale
Before the final death - exhale

Can you live with the lie and still keep your faith?
Did you think you could fly without any damage done?
You can't bear the burden of the lonely so you'd open the gate?
Find yourself relevant in a world that is gone
Did you think you could fly without any damage done?
Rain runs its tracks to the ground in which you'll eternally dwell

"angels... they never existed
My belief is not enough twisted
To hold up such religious characters.
What were you thinking of?"
[Timothy Findley]

A great stone by the tree - details carved
No candlelight beside
For frozen rains looked after that its fire would starve
Like the blaze she died

No more running against the tide
Only the grandeur of abiding
She keeps on lying beneath the trails of rain...
Lifeless... silent
