(isolation is complete
Diseases on our skin
Reflect us upon the earth
The light is dim and the air is dead
Through delirium I realized why!)

Now I draw the line
To resign from the world of mine
Begin from being no one
Rise higher and higher to hit the ground
See divided earth as reflections:
Debris of mankind under desperation
Rise higher and higher to hit the ground

Bid farewell to the casket vultures
Maggots our only friends...from now on
A magnet-like deadend trap
Awaits us all in the end

And it is so...
Futile - in the end, fragile -in the end
Precious -in the end, vicious -in the end

Our shelter is the emptiness
The stretched void for all
Dying arrangements demand
Bittersweet caress after all
Nihilistic - perfection - nihilistic
Transfixion for the butterflies of joy
The truth unfolds: to the end with nothing...

Like thy insects in envenomed rapture
They reach for the warmth, light and the beauty
Wings burnt, pin-transfixed and life force withered
Another ignorant one for my collection

Bid welcome new airless home in a box
Maggots our only companion from now on
Sinews relaxed you know this can't go on forever
It awaits us all in the end
