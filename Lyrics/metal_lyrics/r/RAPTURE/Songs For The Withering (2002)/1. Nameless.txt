I'm sleeping with a knife again
I'm just a drawing on the wall
Sooner or later everything falls apart
Every day a punishment

I have tried so hard to do right
Fought to heal every hurt
Every turn I take
Leads me back to where I started from

All my dreams
They die on me
And I don't think
There's ever healing it

The days grow long
Filled with empty hours
When I wake up alone
With these shadows as my only company

Splinters of glass at my feet
Silence in her white dress
Like dust on books no-one reads
And beds no-one sleeps in anymore

(speechless nameless sleepless alone)

"...the fog is rising"
[Emily Dickinson (1830-1886)]
