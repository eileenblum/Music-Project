So the curtain fell and fierce facades revealed
Sunken within the emptier vision of a light to reach I'm not afraid the shadows here but the voices inside enthrall
Spellbound to slumber again
Still I pursue resistance in vain
Will you embrace this apathy?
Would you cherish the melody when silence is golden?
When the silence is colder?
Would you name it a tragedy when there is nothing left of me?
The stillness is golden in my silent chrysalis stage
This is the day when all light fled
Shapeless figures left to perceive
Blood in my hands proving my mischief
Consuming every urge and need
Will the voices faint away in the distance when this stage has passed
