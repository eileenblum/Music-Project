This burning sensation
I lie still afraid to breathe
in this empty cold room
Come to me oblivion
I'd like to be something
I'd like to be somewhere else
Hope has fled me
The time is near
It's easier to just slip away
than to try and fight my way
out of this state of half existence
Last night I dreamt of a place deep down where I could find peace
Come to me oblivion
