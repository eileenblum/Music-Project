This liquid enlightenment solves even the problems of the deepest kind
Knife is on the table and noose attached
Bottle is open but the misery remains
There are things they couldn't know
Friends all gathered he is still alone
Atrocities that followed carved a cross to heavy to bear
Darkness grew greater every single day behind that friendly yet empty stare
Investigations have been open since she left us far behind
We wonder why she is longer around
Some say she has crossed the borderline
Chill is felt when passing the chair that moth-bitten blanket hid
Stairway down to the invisible one still unfixed like the trace of the struggle:
"Weep... your sobbing won't affect me now
Suffer...It is merely music to my hears
Turn your back on me
Is that the best move you could do?
Pretending is over now
I don't give a fuck about you"
We know why she is no longer around
But on whose hammer did she die? -Mine
We won't see her ever again
