It is not a wreck of your hopes
Mere delusion
It is time to give up the ghost
Don't follow me into the dark
Can't hold on anymore
For all I persisted here
is wasted like the time before us
Empty voices
Hollow chambers
The rooms we used to revel in
Passion cease and life expire
Pulse that depends on wires
Death whispered and chose to guide
And now the bed is cold on my side
This darkness of mine
The shattered and the painful light
Looming close
Keeping distance away from reach
It is happening again and I have no strength in me
When there is no hope
the memories won't fade
But will you lose your faith again today?
