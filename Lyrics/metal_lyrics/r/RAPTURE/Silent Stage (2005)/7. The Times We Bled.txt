Waking moments spent with splinters in my throat
There with our wounds open we stood bleeding the heart dry
Facing the water, hoping for wings to carry us towards daybreak and never let hope die
Then the tow giants came falling down
Took even the unspoken and threw it all away
Thought it would take a lifetime to hid everything away to make the heart whole
And every day without fail I held my heart in my hands
Slowly turning pale
Hoping it would miss a beat
One too many and rot away
Just hold me for a second now
Let's not say a word
Let me catch my breath, dear
and hold it before it escapes
One last time
