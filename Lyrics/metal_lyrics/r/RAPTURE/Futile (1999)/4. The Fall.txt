I see it's time again
As the night's cold sneaks in the day
And here we lay down
In this purest white
Impervious grey
As summer lay dying
Falling, falling
And leaves us alone in this grey
A silent season
The falling year
This coldest of feelings
A sound that creeps over me
The thirsty earth
A fevered slumber
Creeping over me
Forever circle
Forever it creeps over me
As the year decays
And I fall
Again
