Please fade away
My stillborn dream
Still you sink into me
And still I breath
Deeper and deeper from what I had of you
If I only knew
What was to come
Would've ended it all
Now it's just too much for me
Everywhere I see you
Scraping my skin
I'm forever lost
In my intoxicated me
After everything is done
I feel good letting go
Maybe forgetting is easy
But everything is too silent
And the colors are all gone
