My mistake was letting you know
Sharing all that I had
With someone I never knew
In the end
I'm hearing voices
Of people thought long gone
Once again I fear
I'm losing control
In the end
Everything's inside
Every disease I hide
Bleeding and in pain
Cold and tiredly giving in
Come and burn with me
Slit open my world of pain
Sometimes at winters hour I feel quite dead
Just like in the end
