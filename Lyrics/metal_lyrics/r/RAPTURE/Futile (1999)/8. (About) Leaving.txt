Feeling lonely in a crowd
Forever passing a thousand
Nameless homes and lights
I tried closing my eyes
I hated my reflection
Those bitter eyes
And their thousand hates
This life is slowly killing me
Stealing me of every breath
In the end I couldn't care
All I know
Is that I hurt
Tearing me from my waking hours
Is the sweet misery
Of a dark day
No matter how long this will last
I know for sure that one day
I will leave with a sad smile on my face
