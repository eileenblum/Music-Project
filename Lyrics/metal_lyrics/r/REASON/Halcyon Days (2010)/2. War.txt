Firewalls between us
Grey flames of the shattered moon
War...no one knows where it goes
No time to die

Our perishing deals
Incurious  remedy
War...no one knows where it goes
(It) grows in your hearts

Fate is reeling, like a step of Heaven's scale
Jaded minds  open the rift on the burning hell
Silence of the final dawn
Wordless speech in discordance
Foulness veils our useless vice
Elevated sacrifice
Your vanity would patronize
Dissoluting self-disguise
Doubt prevails over the souls
Supplicate without remorse

Into the light
Let the Lord Of Mourning be crowned
