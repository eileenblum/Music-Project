I used to be a chosen dreamer,
Treading now on the unbelievers' way
The sinners' god is now my leader
Tempted me and I go to astray

Why???
I cannot see it, I don't believe it, what have I done???
I'm a blinded ruler, a blessed intruder
Bearing shame

Holy lores, weak-hearted seers
Let me see, and I will not confess
Remedy is in your fears
Crawling prophets
We must have been deranged

The wisdom of the fools
My blindfold heirs presume
No glory for the Fake
No believers to be disarrayed
The power of the fools
The sleeping soul is reborn
Catharsis or disgrace?
The answer disappears
