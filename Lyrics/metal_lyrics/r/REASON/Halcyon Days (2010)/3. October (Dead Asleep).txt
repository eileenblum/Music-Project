Death is overwhelming
Scatters and deflects
Evolution
Trembles in meagre respect
Shades of my insanity
Withering deeply in me
Stumps of my everlasting lie

Where am I running to?
Treachery stains the embracing sky
Here's no crest for my mortality
False glory grown in me
Is this my last goodbye?

Seasons, self-righteous hosts
Sweeping time
False breedings are tainting the cores
Despoiled sun

Run and hide
To sleep forever

Deepening scores rip my time-withered skin
My growling voice dissolves the chants blazing in green

I can't stay
My path is coming to an end
Grey, shivering dreams are lulling the land

I should sleep until everything dies
On this hallowed land
The cycle halts, I'm fading away
Silently
It's over

As the sun falls down
Last oblique ray
The final sprigs burn out
Ash-seeds of Fate

Seeds, self-righteous moors
False breedings are tainting the cores
No shelter, no prowess, no pain halts time
