I swallowed the pain
Floating on dismay
It is your light, that covers... warm cover

The only word I breached
Embracing  arms  released
It is...

Heal me, heal me
With your horns
Solitary, ugly gross
Hiding my false trace again
Wrong direction, softened chain

All I ever wanted is
All I ever needed is
All I ever lost, is still in the bottom
All I  ever grabbed, had sunk in my soundless shame

Why am I revoken
I'm standing still
Look at me, look at me
How  I rise again
Betrayed and raped
But I'm not afraid
All has gone
But the breast's still luring me
