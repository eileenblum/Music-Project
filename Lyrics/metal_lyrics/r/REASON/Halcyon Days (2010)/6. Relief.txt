It's a pact, that you forget
No subscription would be checked
But the words will still remain
Just be yourself, poor man
A premonition like a proof
Empty words ignore the truth
But the words will still remain
Just be yourself, poor man

It's a pact that you forget
No subscription would be checked
Like a neverending maze
Flaunting its blackened blaze
There is nothing in your hearts
No respectful memoires
But those words will still remain
Just be yourself, poor man

Dream evolves the Man
From dust to shade
Blessed seeds of Everflesh
Will sawn upon our graves
Do not revive the Past
Oh, those long ailing grinds
Future remarks the End
The peace of a supreme prize
