All the same
I Chased the Cheshire looked for all the same relief
And further more
I dug in further more than you can bury deep, it's so
Sad to see 
So glad you found your own way out
Arraign your head with crowns invisible, high
Remember why you're here, is to inspire

For what it's worth
It's hollow pantomiming what's it worth to you
To be sure 
Lick the needle to be sure you're truly through, it's so
Sad to see 
So glad you found your own way out
Arraign your head with crowns invisible, high
Remember why you're here, is to conspire

Apart from all of these still waves
The fissures open to align 
Have some water, friend, you're looking pale
This wasn't part of the design
Beware the storm, avoid the frozen rain
Ash the passing dusty collar
Inserting spikes for their embrace 
Forgetting why you're here, is to inspire

Bleeding, it's how they found us, so responsive, draining out across the floor 
Seeping through the chasm, frail and wanting, needing nothing less than more
Curtain, vague illusions from the sideshow to dispel the fantasy
Bleeding, ever bleeding, always bleeding 'till the vein runs dry

Here, take this nail and push it inside in fuckin' hatter
You'll feel so much better as this nerve dies 
In true Alice fashion
Drive out the centering
