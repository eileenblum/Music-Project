Oh Child, Deceive me
Enter the same the same as I
Moments pass as desperate contortions unfold
Seeking placid sanity a moment of calm
Cancerous anxiety and thieving doubt rain
Sheltering indifference to dignify rage

Begging for a line drawn in the sand to separate the prophets from the men 
Then bittersweet the wicked so the guise of harmony can breathe again delighted
Hear me son the rivers dry again foretell the fate and lead us to the edge
Let the prideful sinners bear the gold and buy acceptance

Breathe again
To waste away inside here
The years in turn your haunting words have never left my ears
My mind oh reckoning pride is the mirror through which we must break

Wretched disfigured confused and distracted
Down in this cellar it's cold dark and manic
Clinging indifferent privilege demands
You excuse your excuses, excuse your excuses 
And blame, you blame
Fearful, deceiver, dim motives erratic 
This dream too ambitious this vision too drastic
Choke down rhetorical scraps from the attic
Forever to stand there and still just refuse to change
Just change

Set the nightmare alight and
Dance till these flames illuminate
the cause for the lie
Redemption is not beyond our time
