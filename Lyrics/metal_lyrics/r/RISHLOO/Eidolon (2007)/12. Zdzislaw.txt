I've crawled this corridor once before to the shadows where it ends
Peeled back all of the paper doors to remind me where I've been

Seeds to be sown,
who would've known
The balance fractured
This far in

Who left this
Way open?
Unguarded
Paths chosen

All guilty
They stand in judgment of, those who would travel and
All are guilty
To swing the pendulum, to eat the temporal

They all know harvest time is coming soon

I hold a fragile light before faces stone ascend
Luminous for what it's worth in an amber ragged mist

I left this
Way open
I wanted
Paths chosen

All guilty
They stand in judgment of, those who would travel and
All are guilty
To swing the pendulum, to eat the temporal

We all know harvest time is coming soon

Listen spoke in broken words

To those who would try to hide
Beckoning the Earth to draw you nigh
Make your vendetta of the ground, sundered ground lover
All opposing gravity rise rise rise rise
