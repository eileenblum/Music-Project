Who's there?
I've forgotten
Who said?
Run away
Run where

Against the wall's an armed forgotten
This amputee holds mending tools
I look to the left to see the hand on the knife
Chiseled a glance improved the stone paradigm
Must hurry back before the endless rise

Paradise employs the martyr
I'm too willing to take the name from them

Approach the clouds a winged imposter
To trip among the gods so proud
I look to the right to see my feet to the sky
Embellish the fall to encourage the lie
Must hurry back before the endless rise

Paradise denies the lover
I'm too willing to take the name for them
For them

Sever the scavengers' wings casting out from the heavens unbeautiful things
Beggars, orphans, willful widows clutch the ground 
Hopeless, outcast, harlots trying to hold on 
We're all so willing to take from them

Take the feathers if you wish I will fly with or without them
Fly on high 
Fly on high
