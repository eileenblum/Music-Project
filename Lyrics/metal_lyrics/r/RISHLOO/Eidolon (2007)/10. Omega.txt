God this must, must be for certain if you are here
Raise my world an ossuary staring through the gate wide-eyed 
Did you think I'd salivate and beg 
Don't sell me tones of liberation standing in a cage
May you find that in this sinister lapse we'll heal our sight 
Save your tears my child
Take it, hold it, keep it, know
We choose this suffering

There they stand straining to scrutinize the sage 
String me up these soap box augers 
Seeking out the ways divined here from the citadel its claimed 
Serpents waiting in the shadows keep us from the dream
May you find that in this sinister lapse we'll heal our sight 
Save your tears my child
Take it, hold it, keep it, know
We choose this suffering

I pushed the button and I pulled the trigger
I killed our brothers and murdered our sisters 
I am the pattern the plague and the prison 
And I tore the wound and let it bleed.

May you find that in this sinister lapse we'll heal our sight 
Save your tears my child
Take it, hold it, keep it, know
We chose this suffering and we are not alone
