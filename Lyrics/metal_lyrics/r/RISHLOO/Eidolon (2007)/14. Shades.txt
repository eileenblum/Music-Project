We're, if at all, slaves to a pawn caught in a cautious lie
If at all, staggering weightless haggard stained cynical 
It all tastes sweet

Leave me to sway here, if at all 
Listing ageless 
Wait, wait and see

Come here to rest 
And then cosset the crows 
Who murder the raven 
And those who cast the losing die

Leave me to sway here, if at all 
Listing ageless
Wait

Trace these suicide shades 
Uncovered through this pious lullaby 
Praise to suffer 
While we brace ourselves
Shaking hands on the alter
See these paths to their end 
Through the pulse of hate

And now walking along the earth
It always turns inward
To let their souls writhe
Silting softly it is wanting
Hate

Trace these suicide shades 
Uncovered through this pious lullaby 
Pray and suffer
Erase...
