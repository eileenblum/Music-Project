Cedar grains cling to woven skin upon walls I know frail truths feed borrowed dreams grown cold 
And from here I beg release and hope 
I hope

Breathing through these lines
Innocence lost among the torment of grace within the storm 
Seeking darkness in the dawn
While the emptiness divides every purpose with the light 
I fade, I fade

Without a key, without a sound 
Without a chance to hold the light 
It reaches in between the seams 
To tease the madness and the grief
To curse the walls, to cure the need
To curse the damned who damn the need
The need to know what lies beyond, beyond the walls

Turn the key (turn the key...)

And set free 
This I swear
It's not enough for me to die alone
Uproot these veins that fail to bleed
So I will know and I will still believe we're better 
Than these lies that we have learned to breathe 
Breathing I step beyond the past and let it go
