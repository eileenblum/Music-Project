Under this canvas he hides a dream 
A trick of the type too cheap to be free
Makes your burgeoning inquiry
More easily answered
Oh a sight they have come to see
We shan't disappoint, they've paid for a scene
And a scene they shall have indeed
This dark, dark evening.

Join us inside, that's the way here
Come now, just step right-up in line!
It's freaks, fools, and fire!
Come nearer, come closer, it's nearly time!
You there, and you there, come one and all!

It looks better in Red my calico friend 
Let us brood on the hue of need
What finds your favor?
No, the show must go on instead
With hundreds of eyes at two to a head
And the blindness is thrice complete
When all stand watching.

Step aside make way for the stars' presence!
Better beware, there's lights and glittering!
Gaze deeper, stare harder, it's nearly time!
You there, and you there, come one and all..

So plain...

So have you ever wondered where were the demons they told us of?
Be patient, they're coming, shortly revealed to you
And I do think you'll find a dead-ringer
Much still hides you curious minds
There's no hurry.

Now where are my manners?
Round and around..
Why, I believe they've all arrived..
Out, out, from the wings.

Set all the props in place, lower the lights and wait.
Now, bring them in, let them watch, let the spectacle rise.
Hold your breath, this suspense lead the arrogant dead eyes.
More than them will you spend for the vision of your life.

Let the curtains fall down
Look now, and see, that's quite the motley
Disguise you've borrowed.
My friend, it seems quite odd
But you are the show you've paid for!
Step through the mirror and now the circus spins on and on so,
Come one, come all, tonight!
