Fuck! What have you done?
I was out wandering with gods
What? Are you mad at me?
Some other reason leaves to me instilled
like a madman I'll defend the end of the World
as ennui
Who said a little upper won't help you find your way to the light?
In a parallel
subtlety - denied
Save them - or don't save us
for the skin that we steal in the name of your willing god
what are you, an asshole that can breathe without any air?
drinking the tears of parasites, are you satisfied?
Ooh! there's a carving on the wall
the affair is a piece of the estranged, do you see?
I am aware of the signs, the lapses in space and time
I am a fingertip away - I may...
Bonjour, just a few remaining words...
caught up in a mouthful-full of innuen-du-monde, adieu
our manic missive manifest of modern mystery
weigh the weightfulness of mighty-fine conceit
we are allowed, allowed, allowed to weep
we know right where they'll drown their vendettas in wine
so where do we, where do we, where do we sign?
take it all...
