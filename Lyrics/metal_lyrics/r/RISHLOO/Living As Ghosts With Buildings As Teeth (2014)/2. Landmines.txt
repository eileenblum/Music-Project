This may be Where the Sidewalk Ends
far below me are shimmering surfaces
water-I need water
I've killed everyone here except for my daughter

she had sixteen points to make
five were heads-the other ten were snakes
chasing their tails, bringing her father down
what does it say?
what does it say? Whether you're better than them?
Whether it's a matter of sliding out over?
Slave to the limit-goodbye my friends
I'm beginning to bond with what I lost sight of

safe to crawl across this tin-can-tightrope walk
I want to crawl across
I want to crawl across this footprint dialogue fog
I want to crawl, crawl
I donât think we should all, we should all, we should
forget a bit about it
mnemonic man, mnemonic man, do you recall
when you pushed a little further?

weâre just here to burn your cities down
caught a lot of love-heard a lot of empty voices
got a lot to learn to overcome my motives
and then move beyond those ordinary ways
we have seen the naked, automated cabaret
and weâve moved, weâve moved on
so move us onâ¦

Iâve had enough of idle reverie, I for one can only see
what dreams may come for us
weâve had enough of flight and gravity
spill me out evolved and screaming:
Iâm not meaningless

Left up to you Iâd drown in the desert
Left up to you Iâd use up forever
choking down your plastic waterâ¦
