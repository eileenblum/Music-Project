It's enough
spirits spill from my lungs
sympatico, villainy, betrayed by my tongues
who wants to be worthless?
apparently, I do
change your life and smile a lot
they're takin' you, so give 'em all that you've got
just to prove it's you
down, down, Apocalypse Submarine
I'm sure I read somewhere
It's safe to get out and go swimming
called her home to weather her veins
and who should we blame for these shivering pains?
maybe we die, oh, simply to reach?
out of the confines, out of phase
to ready love to relieve at least all of it
unafraid to know you're through
down, down, Apocalypse Submarine
I'm sure I read somewhere
it's safe to get out and go swimming
see them worry
it couldn't be-oh brother, I know
you realize in the waiting room
all I have today I owe to the Road
hey man, don't be afraid ever
I am on the ride of my life
through the land none of us ever walk at ease
I walk alone
I'm sorry I left without saying
I should have said...
