Violent spinning darkness
Disaster unrestrained
Whispers of the ravaged, lost behind the rain
He lands among the fallen
Pushes out an empty hand
Shuts his eyes and turns away
Screaming out against the end

Tonight I cannot rest because I ache
Tomorrow brings the agony of day
To sleep perchance to dream of all that's lost
And all the things we'll never get to say
In the echoes of anger
Brought from silence too late
In this moment of disaster
There's a clarity
To hate

Now his days are empty, lonely lost and grey
She spends too many hours just trying not to break
Down before the others
Who will never know their pain
Or the endless years of nightmares
That never go away

Tonight I cannot rest because I ache
Tomorrow brings the agony of day
To sleep perchance to dream of all that's lost
And all the things we'll never get to say
In the echoes of anger
Brought from silence too late
In this moment of disaster
There's a clarity
To hate

Why? Won't someone tell me why?
Won't someone tell me why?

Why?

I hate to remember, but I can't forget
I hate to remember, I just can't forget
I hate to remember this is all I have left
I hate to remember 'cause I'm tired of this shit and I ache
