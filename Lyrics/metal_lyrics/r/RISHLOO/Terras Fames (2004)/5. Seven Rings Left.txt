Shadow of a soul you
Come to me and wait for my approval
To kneel here Sacred is the ground I tread
Leave no footprints
perfect in your eyes, you fool
Lay the lesser down
This blood so dark and red
Won't eat away the chains
That hold you where I wish
Where I wish
Watch my every move so calculated
Hunted by the prey but sly, indifferent
Swallow all your pride the poison's
Better that way
When this scent arises new
Lover of a lie
Immersed inside yourself
Dream your fractured mind away inside this cell
Oppression, anger, fear and pain
Restrain the fire to hold the flame
To burn, to sear, to penetrate
Allowed a voice to scream my name
Grasp in your greed for the riches
Give up the hopes for your pride
Drink down the wine like a glutton
Follow the lust in my eyes
For I am the master so envied
Free to be wasteful and sloth
Fear now the wrath of my power
Counting the sins to stay lost
And weak and alone and ashamed
Afraid, so afraid
Of mistakes and failures to be
Perfect, passive and unquestioning
You're awake now, but far too weak
So wait
Worry, hide in shadow
Do not speak, do not dissent, and lay down
Take it, celebrate this pain
Tear away the covers
Useless vestiges of comfort
Pointless tokens of a difference
To hide from me
Throw away the balance
Senseless running without conscience
Endless circle or a spiral
We'll always bleed
The same
So lay down
Lay down slave
Lay down, down
Lay down
Slave
Lay down, down
Lay down
Slave
Lay down, down
Lay down
Slave
Lay down
