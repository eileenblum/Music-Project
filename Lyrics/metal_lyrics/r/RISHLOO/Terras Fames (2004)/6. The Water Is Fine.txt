Give to me
My angel, my lover, my friend
Dissolving my mind again
Dissolving my world again
Take my dreams, my wishes, my hopes and my wants
And make them all real just once
Tonight

Fall away
Walking on water
To see if the surface still breaks

Further down
Uncertainty goes with its curse
Of questions of virtue and worth
Inside

Fall away
Walking on water
To see if the surface still breaks

And I hold on now to
Give in to this taste of
One chance to be broken

Falling here and I send for
My soul to be saved
Hold this light before my time
When I stand 'til I break
Watch this fallin' from the end!

Drink of the water, just swallow it down
To taste, absorb, below, below, below
And fear for the drowning
Drink of the water, just swallow it down
To taste, absorb, below, below, below
To fear for the drowning
And nothing can touch me now
And no one can bring me out

This ethereal comfort starts to wear itself thin
Dazed and back where I started
Feel this fear creeping in

As the nightmare grows clearer
I see nothing is right
and I see
See

Sideways
All I believed is lost and shattered and
Sideways now
This fragile cloak so torn and tattered is
Sideways
Forcing me to notice this world so
Sideways now
Failing, falling, breaking, turning so
Sideways
Just pull me in and shove me under
Sideways
Just hold me down and end what's left of me

I fall from the light
At peace here
The water is fine
