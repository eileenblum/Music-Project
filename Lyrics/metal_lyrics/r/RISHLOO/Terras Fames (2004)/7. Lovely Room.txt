I try and remember a night before this
The mirror reflects, but it lies to me
I breathe in the breeze open-eyed to feel this
And slip into arms dipped in wine

To sleep
In a house of gods, in an empty room
There will be no scars and I will be there
Soon
I will be there soon

I glance at a clock lost in time, it's bleeding
Past echoes of rain I cry out for peace
I slip past the door painted red to save me
And offer my own, lose control

And release
In a house of gods, in an empty room
There will be no scars and I will be there
In a house of gods, in an empty room
There will be no scars and I will be there

They may believe that there can only be one end
But I will not wait until the blood is on my hands
Serenity is just a choice of breath away
Condemn each other, but forever I will stay
In a house of gods, in an empty room
There will be no scars and I will be there

In the house of God, in a lovely room
There will be no scars and I will be there
Soon
I will be there soon
