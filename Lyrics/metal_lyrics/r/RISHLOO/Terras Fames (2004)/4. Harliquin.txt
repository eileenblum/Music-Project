Try, seeker, try 
To find this path of mine 
I weave a simple line 
Take care to watch my flight 
Place your fingers here to guide me 
Guide me under 
One must lead the other 
See, the way I bring 
Can change easily 
The end knows those who come 
But each can run away with us 
Place your fingers here to guide me 
Guide me under 
One must lead the other 
Walk here softly through this door or never 
Follow me into my sanctum 
There are no words, so watch as I 
Strip away layers, I strive to find paces 
I reel from each image, a product of loss 
Bearing away my wholeness, fooled by my own hands 
Offer a useless notion to satisfy demands 
Paint me again so deeply 
Illusions from within 
Make me a tragic canvas 
For the dye inside my skin 
Sorry you never asked me 
Sorry you never tried 
Grief you hold so shallow will pass away in time 
Shards of my identity 
Scattered here upon the ground 
Fragments of a tragedy 
Dig in coarse to bring me down 
Kneeling in my agony 
Reaching in to pick them out 
Holding on so desperately 
'Til they cut inside and drown 
In this prison of my misery 
In the vessel of my doubt 
In the court of endless suffering 
In the hall where I am bound 
To these servants of a history 
As they circle all around 
They stand in their delight 
I lay my hands upon these wounds and cry in empty ridicule 
Broken words and Hollow truths 
I've crept inside a sorrowful embrace 
Cruel embrace 
Await my claim 
So stay away 
Stay away 
Away [repeated]
