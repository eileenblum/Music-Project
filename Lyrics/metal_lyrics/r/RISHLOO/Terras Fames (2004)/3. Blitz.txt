I turned from the world but the world turns me
They show you the way but I can't even breathe
So I grit my gnashing teeth against a fence I cannot see
And I wish to fucking hell there was no between
Secondly and first of all, just because and why
I list the constant questions, I kept them all inside
But you won't give your thoughts to me so I won't give you mine
And you won't waste your words on me so I won't waste your time

You betray everything when you refuse to see
The truth of your trial is lost so listlessly
You watch us go by as we laugh and we cry
You look down and realize you're not who you think
Could there be anything?

Embracing the pendulum so I do not fall behind
And I'm weaker than the next in line
So I'll do my best to represent the evidence of all that I've spoken

With a withered, twisted finger you're turnin' back the time
With a withered, twisted finger you push 'em all in line
And you smash to fuckin' bits your world when everything's alright
And you smash to fuckin' bits my world when everything is fine

You betray everything when you refuse to see
The truth of your trial is lost so listlessly
You watch us go by as we laugh and we cry
You look down and realize you're not who you think
Could there be anything?

Embracing the pendulum so I do not fall behind
And I'm weaker than the next in line
So I'll do my best to represent the evidence of all that I've spoken

Watch the world go by you
Each time
Feel this one day, forget the next
Live life through lies
Empty inside
Wondering why
Just give it up you're not for real
Don't know a thing about how I feel
You're just a lie because you try
To believe
What you won't see and nothing's true
If you give up and if you lose
And run away when things get gray
I won't be left when you confess
When you admit you're full of shit
I can't comply and take your side
I understand that's all you have
But it's just not enough
There'll never be anything
To justify your wasted life
You've fallen so far behind
And we're weak as our one best try
So I'll let it fall and die away and whatever's
left is forgotten
Forgotten
