I listened to your words, I sat at your feet
Then I watched you drown millions in suicide
Philosophies
Then I stand in the balance with gold in my hands
And weep like a beggar
In silence again

I want to know why
You just sat there, watched millions of your
people die
Without lifting a finger

Here we are at peace, if only for a time
To sleep perchance to scream
In silence for our crimes
