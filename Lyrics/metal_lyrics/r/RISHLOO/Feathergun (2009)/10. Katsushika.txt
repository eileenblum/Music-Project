Hello, I'm the whisper-clap man tuggin' on my sleeves, doin' all that I can do
can you weather the moment whether the fortune comes before the end?
you should be satisfied as well

now we're counting all the hours on the second hand for days
mending ties with broken time in many different ways
if all of us spin 'round 'til every one of us is down

impressing pressure in dialect forms
ride the spiral seas beyond the storm
learn and decide, fall 'til you fly
take a breath and dive

let's go, have you stepped to the edge, stared into the sea from the foot of your bed?
have you woke in a dream to sleep through the meaning and mean everything you said?
you will be satisfied as well...

...just below the waterline I see
just below the waterline I lay
below the surface I believe there is a place of love and wonder where all we are and dare to be is fearlessly discovered
wrapped within the motion of the unrelenting struggle, oh this sinking feeling seeing everything in double
oh, what beautiful monsters
you're all beautiful monsters
you're all beautiful...
