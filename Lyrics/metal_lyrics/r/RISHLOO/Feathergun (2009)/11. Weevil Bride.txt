And in the end we caught our weevil bride
she was arraigned in garments' genocide
we took her home to where our mirror stood, like she knew we would so she smiles
she sings oo-oo-oo, I've been here before
many years ago, before the war
and it goes on and on and on until you're gone
and I just need to know that everything is fine and everyone's alright

they take our tongues and give us guns, two coins for the ferryman for when you're gone
the weight of souls drives his boat ashore and he sails no more
staring out across the end he sings oo-oo-oo I've never been here before, even years ago after the war...

...chiseling the granite from our dusty eyelids, harvesting the stones we throw
we caught a virus from the periscope inside us, we caught a virus from the periscope
we caught a virus from the periscope inside us, we caught a virus, we caught a virus
star-struck freeze frame capture that coin-filp fateful harmony-muted feedback
with your cold hands on the foreheads so feverish and frantic while madmen lay your landmines in the ballroom

and I want some, yes please
send us back as amputees with starry rags and shiny things
let me back into the sun
how many times must all this be said?
on and on until we're gone, we're all children of light cut from the same thread
