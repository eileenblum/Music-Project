And I could never waste you, only want a taste
Give all I have before this by thinking it's too late
I've promised just one more for sentimental loan
Cross off the line of tragic, pass boundaries of what's torn
But I am my own
And I am alone
And now that I've committed, drowning blissfully
Take all for only nothing, just trying not to see
These lies are more than losing when memories are gone
The benefit's disaster and everything is wrong
But I am my own
And I am alone
Sometimes I try to make me someone I can't be
And somewhere out there I'm in search of tranquility
Returning to familiar, the problems all replay
I try to understand them in my fucked up little way
I guess it all was pointless,
I don't matter either way
And I guess I just amount to one more number on a page
But I am my own
And I am alone
Sometimes I try to make me someone I can't be
And somewhere out there I'm in search of tranquility

[2x]
And once again I climb inside
What I know was once my life
If you're lonely watch me die
Just know I'll haunt your dreams at night

But I am my own
And I am alone
Sometimes I try to make me someone I can't be
And somewhere out there I'm in search of tranquility
Is this the last time
Just one more last time
This is the last time
But nothing left for me
