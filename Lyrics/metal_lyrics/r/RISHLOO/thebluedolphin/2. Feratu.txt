One more night,
Then it's one more sun
That leaves me wondering.
One more fight
And I'll lose these wings.
My certainty falters.
Surrender to uncertain mystery
And release me
While innocent lovers cry
And bittersweet lovers sigh
Losing sight
And this path I'm on
Just keeps on narrowing.
All this time I feel so lost,
This darkness swallows me.
Surrender to uncertain mystery
And release me
While innocent lovers cry
And bittersweet lovers sigh
And fall into
As I embrace the nothingness
Your memory leaves me obsessed
Obsessed
And surrender to uncertain mystery
And release me
While innocent lovers cry
And bittersweet lovers sigh
And fall into
As I embrace the nothingness
Your memory leaves me obsessed
Obsessed
You leave... leave me...
You leave... leave me...
