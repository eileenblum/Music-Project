Behind the veil of the mournful
Their revolting stench lingers
No values too profound to exploit on their way to eternal doom
At hand is the search for means
To bring on armageddon
Controlled by their filthy hands they will cleanse the holy lands

Beneath the cenotaph they burn
Forever and ever

The suffering seemed endless
But death washed away their lies

Fornever laid to rest
A drowning human cesspool
Bred by liars to conform to this life of waste

Behind the veil of the mournful
Their revolting stench lingers
No values too profound to exploit on their way to eternal doom

Deep below the rotten reigns
Their realm of filth is growing
Deep inside they breed their lies but their demise still is rising

Dying pains of the filthy ones
As their realm will fall
Dying pains of the liars breed as we wash away their lives

The suffering seemed endless
But death washed away their lies

Fornever laid to rest
A drowning human cesspool
Bred by liars to conform to this life of waste

Beneath the cenotaph they burn
Forever and ever
