Death has made its call
The reaper has come for your soul
Swaying on the edge of insanity
Reality has fled your mind

Morbid scenes replayed over again
Inside your own hell
The dead now awakens to drag you down below

Dead forever dead and forsaken by your god
Submerged in a pool of your everflowing blood

Dying you lay down
To rest your drained out shell
Slowly losing your grip
Insanity cloaks your fading thoughts

Dead forever dead and forsaken by your god
Submerged in a pool of your everflowing blood

Never to return to the realm above
Forever trapped in hell and the suffering that comes there of

Tumbling through the turmoil or broken dreams
Cast into damnation forever as it seems

Pain so immense drives you on your quest
Inside your rotting flesh dwells a soul of unrest

Never to return to the realm above
Forever trapped in hell and the suffering that comes there of

Dead forever dead and forsaken by your god
Submerged in a pool of your everflowing blood
