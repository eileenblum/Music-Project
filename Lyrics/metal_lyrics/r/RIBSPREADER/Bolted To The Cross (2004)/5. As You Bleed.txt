Spewed from a womb of uneartly origin
I am the witches brew festering on all living

I hear your feeble voice as you're evoking me
Soon you'll comprehend what you've unleashed
As you bleed

Dead to the world but then I awoke
I have come for your life through the burning smoke

I hear your feeble voice as you're evoking me
Soon you'll comprehend what you've unleashed
As you bleed

I am the dawning of the undead world
Born only to make you bleed

Surviving on the fear your weeping brings
There is no other pain but me
Soon no more life will be left in you dead rotting carcass

Spewed from a womb of unearthly origin
I am the witches brew festering on all living

I hear your feeble voice as you're evoking me
Soon you'll comprehend what you've unleashed
As you bleed

I am the dawning of the undead world
Born only to make you bleed
