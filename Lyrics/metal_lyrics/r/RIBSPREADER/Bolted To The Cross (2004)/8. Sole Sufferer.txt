Mourn your loss
On your deathbed
Wishing you were never born into a life of pain
Putrid sickness
Your demise has come to be
Nothing left to do but to slowly rot away

Pusfilled maggot creature
Attach yourself to the cross
Beg forgiveness for your sins as you squirm

Crawl in your filth
Guilt ridden sole sufferer

Conjure your lies
Based upon your fears
Your purgatory grows within your rotting mind

Fools to the slaughter
A willing selfmade sacrifice
Suffer your beliefs
And they will become reality

As soon as you die your lies will be forgotten
Dead and gone dejected into hell

Suffer your beleifs
And they will become reality

Mourn your loss
On your deathbed
Wishing you were never born into a life of pain

Pusfilled maggot creature
Attach yourself to the cross
Beg forgiveness for your sins as you squirm

Crawl in your filth
Guilt ridden sole sufferer
