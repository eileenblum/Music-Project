Morbidity brutally awoken as life ceases rapidly
Decomposed serenity
Extermely dead and rotting feeding the worms
Shredded gutted disemboweled

Dead forever dead
Rotting from inside
Breeding your demise as you slowly die

Morbid life reeks from you devoured by the maggots
Now you quench insect hunger
Become the womb of vermin spawn as you decay
Devoid of all human life

Dead forever dead
Rotting from inisde
Breeding yyour demise as you slowly die

You lay dead rotting from within
Crawling with vermin
Slowly rotting into the soil
Merging with remains of the moulding

Dead as autumn leaves
Cold and stiff decaying corpse

Brutally deceased
Decaying slowly in your coffin
Reduced to meat you feed the worms now and forever

Dead forever dead
Rotting from inside
Breeding your demise as you slowly die

Morbidity brutally awoken as life ceases rapidly
Decomposed serenity
Extermely dead and rotting feeding the worms
Shredded gutted disemboweled

Dead forever dead
Rotting from inside
Breeding your demise as you slowly die
