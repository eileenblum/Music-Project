There's no haven to shelter your rotting soul
Morbid growths emerging from your decaying flesh

Blessed in suffering by your god
Some day soon you will be dead

Pain ablaze like bolts through your limbs
Escape the hell by shedding your skin
Remain in suffering
Forever

Lifeless bleeding carcass eaten by worms
Festering morbidity devouring all
Left inside your soul

Lifeless you squirm in pain

Heavenless you burn forever

Searing pain
Inside your dying soul
Abused to edge by the demons within your putrid corpse

There's no haven
To shelter your rotting soul
Morbid growths emerging from your decaying flesh

Blessed in suffering by your god
Some day soon you will be dead
