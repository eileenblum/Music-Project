Forced into a reign of faith
As will succumbs to predestined ways
Beliefs forged to achive control
The suffering is endless

Systems to enslave the slesh
Drugs for the sickened soul
Locked in chains kept restrained
By their religious means

Remnants of life left behind scattered like sheep
Nothing left to save you now but those hollow beliefs
That you hold

Breeding the curse of boredom
The cross of inane existence
Feeding lies to the voice inside
To obliterate the gaping hole that grows

Remnants of life left behind scattered like sheep
Nothing left to save you now but those hollow beliefs
That you hold

Hollowed out inside
Nothing but an empty shell
Trapped in a vortex and sucked down into hell

Into hell we go

Suffering supreme is what you'll know
After your descent into the everflow
Streams of your blood feeding the soil
Squirm in pain as your flesh starts to boil

Forced into a reign of faith
As will succumbs to predestined ways
Beliefs forged to achieve control
The suffering is endless

Remnats of life left behind scattered like sheep
Nothing left to save you now but those hollow beliefs
That you hold
