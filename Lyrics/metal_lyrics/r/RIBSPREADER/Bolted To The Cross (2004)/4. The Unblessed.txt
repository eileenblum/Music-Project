Damned to walk the earth
As this rotting creature
Unblessed with eternal life to suffer through aeons

Shunned from the living
To dwell in the past
Suffer the blessing that will forever last

Morbid visions lingers
Inside my clouded mind
Pieces of what once was but now has come to rot

Morbid reflections
Nothing left but to rot
Feeding the soil my remains
The unblessed dead

Forever damned to dwell

Only alive to suffer
The spell of the undead
Damned to forever dwell
Within a rotting shell of pain

Morbid visions lingers
Inside my clouded mind
Pieces of what once was but now has come to rot

Shunned from the living
To dwell in the past
Suffer the blessing that will forever last
