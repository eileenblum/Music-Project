I stab you in the back
To release you from your pain
You'll prefer to be dead
When the hacking begins

I thrive on human flesh
I'm autopsy obsessed

The sickness taking over
The urge is here again
I seek out the well fed
They give more flesh when dead

I thrive on human flesh
I'm autopsy obsessed

Autopsy obsessed I need another body
Autopsy obsessed, obsessed by flesh

I stab you in the back
To release you from your pain
You'll prefer to be dead
When the hacking begins

I thrive on human flesh
I'm autopsy obsessed
