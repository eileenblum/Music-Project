Awake in silence
The world has gone
Retching as lungs inhale the air of this crypt

You know you're not dead
Still you're here rotting
Is this a dream
Not dead but buried

So many ways
Into the grave
You have walked them all and now it's all to end

You know you're not dead
Still you're here rotting
Is this a dream
Not dead but buried

Not dead but buried
Damned forever
Not dead but buried and rotting alive

This is your home
A crypt of slime
Feeding the worms until it's time again to die

You know you're not dead
Still you're here rotting
Is this a dream
Not dead but buried
