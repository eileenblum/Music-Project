Decaying life
And the stench that breeds
Rotting corpses dwell inside this tomb
There is no way out
Submerged in the rot
You will soon become one with the dead
Morbid reflections
Ways of the dead
Sickened lives cast into hell

Morbid reflections
Of the undead

Rancid horrors
The decomosing arise
Searching for the living to feed their hunger

Morbid reflections
Of the undead

Breeding the filth of the undead
The lingering sickness forever goes on
The spawn of the dead alive
Feasting on your soul

Morbid sickness
Inside your soul
Undead craving swallows you whole

Decaying life
And the stench that breeds
Rotting corpses dwell inside this tomb
There's no way out
Submerged in the rot
You will soon become one with the dead

Morbid reflections
Of the undead
