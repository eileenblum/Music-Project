Fierce determination
To nail the black robed liars
Crucifix spells 666

Bolted to the cross
Mourning the loss

Worms
Inside your coffin
Eating your rotting soul

Defaced disfigured cremated
Only ashed remain
Embedded in your remnats of dust
The cross you wore to praise your lord

Your days of molestation
Has gone away
No one hears your cries
Repent your deeds as you slowly die

Fierce determination
To nail the black robed liars
Crucifix spells 666

Bolted to the cross
Mourning the loss

Worms
Inside your coffin
Eating your rotting soul
