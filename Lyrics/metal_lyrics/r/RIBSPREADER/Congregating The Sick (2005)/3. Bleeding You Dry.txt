Drained from the fluids of life
Drying as you're dying
Blood is no more flowing
It resides inside my jars
Drained from your scars
I'm bleeding you dry
Coughing nothing but air
No fluids in your system

Mummified while still alive
Is what you'll suffer

Drained from your scars
I'm bleeding you dry

I bleed you dry
And feel you die
The life I take from you is the ultimate high

Nothing slows the drainage
From your open veins
No use in crying as tears are drained

Drained from the fluids of life
Drying as you're dying
Blood is no more flowing
It resides inside my jars

Drained from your scars
I'm bleeding you dry
