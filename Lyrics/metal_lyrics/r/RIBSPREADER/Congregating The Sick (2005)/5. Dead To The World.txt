Six feet under
Trapped inside a coffin
Clawing to get out
Unheard screams echoes inside

Dead to the world

Inside my tomb
There is nothing but darkness
Deep down below
Where I dwell in suffering

Decaying slowly
Infested by sickness
Forgotten by the living I'm rotting alive

Preumed dead and gone
Still I'm breathing
Laid to rest
But still not dead

Six feet under
Trapped inside a coffin
Clawing to get out
Unheard screams echoes inside

Dead to the world

Decaying slowly
Infested by sickness
Forgotten by the living I'm rotting alive
