From cathedral spires
We rull our filthy hordes
Sickening wolves in sheepsclothes
Come to mass and give
Your souls and flesh
This is rape for a cause

Kneel for me
As I breed my sickness in you

Prey on the innocent
This is our agenda
Defiling the young to make them into us
Come to mass and give
Give your soul and flesh
This is rape for a cause

Congregation of the sick
Congregation of the foul

Spawning the soulless
To feed our needs
Feating the weak to quench our hunger

Congregation of the sick
Congregation of the foul

Kneel for me
As I breed my sickness in you
