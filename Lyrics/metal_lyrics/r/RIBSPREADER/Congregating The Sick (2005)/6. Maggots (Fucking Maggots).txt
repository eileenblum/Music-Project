Maggots in my head
Feeding though I'm not quite dead
To fester on my flesh
Their one and sole objective

Festering on my dying flesh

Maggots
Maggots fucking maggots

Submurged in filth
Their bodies worm their way inside
Drenched in rancid discharge
Slwoly I am eaten

Festering on my dying flesh

Maggots
Maggots fucking maggots

Nothing slows their progress
Into my decaying brain
Feeding on my death
Choking my last gasping breath

Maggots in my head
Feeding though I'm not quite dead
To fester on my flesh
Their one and sole objective

Festering on my dying flesh

Maggots
Maggots fucking maggots
