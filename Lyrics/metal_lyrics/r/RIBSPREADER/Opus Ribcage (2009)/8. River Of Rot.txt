A landslide of human sickness
This world has come to end - as we are torn away
And then came plagues and boils - that tore our naked flesh
Our flesh was ripe for the reaping

In the river of rot
Mankind will end her days!
In the river of rot
We will pay for our sickened ways!

A landslide of human sickness
This world has come to end - as we are torn away
And then came plagues and boils - that tore our naked flesh
Our flesh was ripe for the reaping

In the river of rot
Mankind will end her days!
In the river of rot
We will pay for our sickened ways!

All of humanity dying
This is the final day
The sickened pray and whimper
They think we can be saved

In the river of rot
Mankind will end her days!
In the river of rot
We will pay for our sickened ways!
