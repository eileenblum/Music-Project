Pushed back to the recoil
Emptying every chamber loaded
Flesh torn to mangled meat
The line is cross there is no retreat

All it takes is bullet rain
Their lives will end today
The hint for the final kill
Is getting closer still
Haunted by the memories
The debris of the slaughtered dead
Infected by the need for carnage
It breeds inside my head

Dying dead decomposed
You are dead!
Dying now for my hands
You are dead!

All it takes is bullet rain
Their lives will end today
The hint for the final kill
Is getting closer still
Haunted by the memories
The debris of the slaughtered dead
Infected by the need for carnage
It breeds inside my head

Dying dead decomposed
You are dead!
Dying now for my hands
You are dead!

Pushed back to the recoil
Emptying every chamber loaded
Flesh torn to mangled meat
The line is cross there is no retreat

Dying dead decomposed
You are dead!
Dying now for my hands
You are dead!
