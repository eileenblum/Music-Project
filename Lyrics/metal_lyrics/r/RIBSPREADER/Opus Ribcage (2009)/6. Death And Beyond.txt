There is only one place to go
There is only time for a final show
I will take you there - and end your suffering

Death
Death and Beyond
(you can go but I can't follow)
To Death and Beyond
I suffer left below

There is only room for chosen few
So be happy that I chose you
I will take you there
And take away your life

Yeah...
Death and Beyond
(you can go but I can't follow)
To Death and Beyond
I suffer left below

I am the taker of lives
It's because I despise my own
I suffer just as you forever - yeah

Death and Beyond
(you can go but I can't follow)
To Death and Beyond
I suffer left below
