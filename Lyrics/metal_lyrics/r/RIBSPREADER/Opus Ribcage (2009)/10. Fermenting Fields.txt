Do not open the door to the cellar
Down there only death dwells
Do not dig your way through that wall
As you will fucking die!

As night comes and evil draws near
Stay away from the places you fear
As curiosity claws just stay away
Just wait until the break of day!

But you could not stay away...
You just had to go there...
You could not wait until it was a little bit safe...
And now you feed the fermenting fields...
The stupidity is sickening...
They just have to go where no one is meant to go...
The stupidity is just baffling...
They just had to fucking die

As night comes and evil draws near

You could not wait until it was a little bit safe...
And now you feed the fermenting fields...
The stupidity is just sickening...
They just have to go where no one is meant to go...
Their stupidity is just baffling...
They just had to fucking die!
