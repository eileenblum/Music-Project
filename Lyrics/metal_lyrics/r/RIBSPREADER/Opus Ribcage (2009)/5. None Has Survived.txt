Rotting away in a pit of decay
Trapped like an animal - withering away
Once sedated and brought to this place
Who would do such a sickened thing?

You are not the only one
Yet none has survived
You are just one of the many
And none has survived

Once you had a life, meaning as well
Now you're trapped in a carnal hell
Once you were free and lived as you pleased
Now you're trapped and soon deceased

Eaten by maggots while you're still alive
Tied down rotting, still you're screaming

Ignored by the beast that ravaged your life
Now you're left to die alone

You are not the only one
Yet none has survived
You are just one of the many
And none has survived
