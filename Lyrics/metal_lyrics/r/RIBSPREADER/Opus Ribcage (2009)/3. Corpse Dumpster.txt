And when I am done you will breath no more
Left to rot away in my corpse dumpster

You had the misfortune to cross my ways
This is now the end of your days
Your only purpose has now been served
As your intestines are brutally torn loose

And when I am done you will breath no more
Left to rot away in my corpse dumpster

My way of life is to bring on horrid dead
I reek of sickness and fetid breath
You will never know how I became this beast
You will only know my trade of severing meat

Fornicating the remains of your flesh
The maggots fester - as I dig into the wet

And when all is just a pile of rotting sick
You will be bagged and thrown away

Fornicating the remains of your flesh
The maggots fester - as I dig into the wet

And when I am done you will breath no more
Left to rot away in my corpse dumpster
