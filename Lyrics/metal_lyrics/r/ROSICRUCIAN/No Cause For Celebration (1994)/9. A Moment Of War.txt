Nothing is moving but time
are you aware of what I can see
Like a serpent around a lifeless ground
hate is salvation, helps me be
Once and for all this will now be settled
the price is an eye for an eye
How far are you prepared to go
there won't be no trial so what's the use to deny

There is no use to argue
We must always disagree
There is no use to argue

My eyes are bleeding
The final battle stands before
My eyes are bleeding
I can't hold back anymore
Now there is no turning back in this moment of war

It's sad to see that you are not any
different than all the rest
Pretending you care and want to help
obviously for your own interest
Kept in the dark again, some things never change
but every story got an end
I've run out of patience, it's the calm before the storm
is this to much for you to comprehend

There is no use to argue
We must always disagree
There is no use to argue

My eyes are bleeding
The final battle stands before
My eyes are bleeding
I can't hold back anymore
Now there is no turning back in this moment of war

Everything got it's season
too late you realized
Time has come to reveal your treason
and that I'm the saviour that has raised
You can take everything I got
but you can never take my pride
You can try to controle my life
but you will never ever be my guide

There is no use to argue
We must always disagree
There is no use to argue

My eyes are bleeding
The final battle stands before
My eyes are bleeding
I can't hold back anymore
Now there is no turning back in this moment of war
