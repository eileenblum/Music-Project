The silence is choking me, I can't longer breathe
the emptiness is blinding me, I can't longer see
A silent war based on the rage within
no one can see it boiling under my sign
Every step is a burden
Every breath is in pain
Life's bitter poison, pumping through my veins
Luck has run out and I can't break the chains

Left out in the cold, who will ever
know what has been told, it's gone forever

When I think I've made it
again kicked back in the great maze
When I think I've made it
hysterically hallucinating through the endless haze

I wish that this was a dream
the reality is not what it seems
I meet my saviour with a scream
feeling the stench of life

I have no conscious, I can't feel no guilt
I can't care less about the things that were built
I'm sitting alone watching my life go by
when surrounded by leaches there is no use to try
Every second is like a life time
Every effort without no gain
Life's bitter poison, pumping through my veins
Luck has run out and I can't break the chains

Left out in the cold, who will ever
know what has been told, it's gone forever

When I think I've made it
again kicked back in the great maze
When I think I've made it
hysterically hallucinating through the endless haze

I wish that this was a dream
the reality is not what it seems
I meet my saviour with a scream
feeling the stench of life
