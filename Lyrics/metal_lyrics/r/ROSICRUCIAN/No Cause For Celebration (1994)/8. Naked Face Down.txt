You better listen this time
if you want a glance
But if you try to grab it
ha, not a chance
If you cannot take it
so why are you here
Cause there are no shortcuts
And now the end is near

You think you know me, ha!
but you don't even have a clue
You think you know me
you even think I believe in you

Hey, what's your problem
what do you have to prove
I'm surprised by your
every single move
Always preaching things that
I all ready know
I'm so fed up with you
and my hate will glow

Just one more word
from your mouth and you'll be
Naked face down
Just one more word
from your mouth and you'll be
Naked face down

You always talk so big but
you are just a churl
You're a little boy trapped
in a mans world
I can read you like an
wide open book
The dark will get you now
when I've placed my hook

You think you know me, ha!
but you don't even have a clue
You think you know me
you even think I believe in you

Just an empty face that
cover an empty brain
Take of your mask, don't give me
that fake smile again
You try to improve with a
nice and false image
But I see you through boy
this will end in scrimmage

Just one more word
from your mouth and you'll be
Naked face down
Just one more word
from your mouth and you'll be
Naked face down

You think you know me, ha!
but you don't even have a clue
You think you know me
you even think I believe in you

Your opinion's worthless
a waste of my time
Take a look at yourself
on your back they climb
If you cannot make it
don't place your bet
Cause I know what I want
and that's what I'll get

Just one more word
from your mouth and you'll be
Naked face down
Just one more word
from your mouth and you'll be
Naked face down
