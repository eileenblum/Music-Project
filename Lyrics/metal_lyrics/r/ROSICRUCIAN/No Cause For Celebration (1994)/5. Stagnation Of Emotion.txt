Now you're trapping it all up, it's a game
but you're standing in a corner in shame
When you open your mouth
snakes fly out
because you cannot live your life in endless doubt

Like rubber your mind works, you're insane
ticking slow and hard you're in pain
If I tell you now
trust will die
Stay alive just one more day and you'll try

Floating through the compact dark
Blue as water is your mind
Feel your empty life's last spark
You will never know when and what I'll bind

Searching the tale, stagnation of emotions
Searching the pale, stagnation of emotions
Courage to all the brave
unstring the forgotten crave
Forcing you to feel
if this is not for real
That's all that I plead
that's who you will be
Stagnation of emotions

You lay down on the floor, cold of fear
so burning and frozen, it's so clear
you have failed once again
lost it all
it's all gone and you'll come when they call

Floating through the compact dark
Blue as water is your mind
Feel your empty life's last spark
You will never know when and what I'll blind

Searching the tale, stagnation of emotions
Searching the pale, stagnation of emotions
Courage to all the brave
unstring the forgotten crave
Forcing you to feel
if this is not for real
That's all that I plead
that's who you will be
Stagnation of emotions

If you're trapping it all up, it's in vain
it is no way out now, it's down the drain
You have failed once again
trust will die
it's all gone and you'll fall when they cry

You lay down on the floor, wet of fear
so burning and soaking, it's getting near
When you open your mouth
your brain burst out
because you cannot live your life in endless doubt

Floating through the compact dark
Blue as water is your mind
Feel your empty life's last spark
You will never know when and what I'll blind

Searching the tale, stagnation of emotions
Searching the pale, stagnation of emotions
Courage to all the brave
unstring the forgotten crave
Forcing you to feel
if this is not for real
That's all that I plead
that's who you will be
Stagnation of emotions
