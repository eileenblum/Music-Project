Are you around when I am crying
I cannot trust the words that you say
Are they just not the signs of your greed
the day will come when you must repay
I believed in your soul and the things that you said
but the memories are all turning grey
I got no feelings left, you think I'm misled
but it's only yourself that you've betrayed

I will love to watch you fall

Feel your own blade
cutting deep into your back
Feel your own blood
feel my hate
I'll get you what you need
for the brains that you lack
I'll love to watch you bleed

Cause it's all just

Words without meaning
Words without meaning
All that you say

After the wake if morning ever comes
only the emptiness will stay
Out of the past into the frozen world
are you man enough to meet another day
Like a tree without roots you got no control
you are too lost to find the only way
Through the tunnel of lust you run with your burden
you think you're god - but it's me you must obey

It's only yourself that you betray

Feel your own blade
cutting deep into your back
Feel your own blood
feel my hate
I'll get you what you need
for the brains that you lack
I'll love to watch you bleed

Cause it's all just

Words without meaning
Words without meaning
All that you say
Words without meaning
all just
Words without meaning
All that you say

It's only yourself you've betrayed
