In a place you've never been
a place full of hate and sin
Step into the ring
up straight you think, but you got nothing to win
Do the walk, the walk of shame
talk back at it, not a thing to claim
It's the only time that'll never be
don't get lost cause you'll never be bound to me

Bleeding cause yet to come
Living by yourself six feet down
Alone in a hole so wet and cold

Colours flash before my eyes
Not a word about the real cause
Why this way? The price of lies
I try to stop but I got my own laws

Bleeding cause yet to come
Living by yourself six feet down
Alone in a hole so wet and cold

Colours flash before my eyes
Not a word about the real cause
Why this way? The price of lies
I try to stop but I got my own laws

Opening, opening of the glory end
