If you could see what I cannot be
You'd understand why I can't be whole
Life is piercing me on its spike
My unawareness is taking its toll
I can feel things you would never understand
The pain so satisfying in the silence
Everytime I go there someone bring me back
My calmness turning into violence

Only an arms length is holding me back
Reality flushed through my head
What I can see my hands cannot touch
The silence must not be fed
Sometimes - I wish I was there with you
There in the silence where our worlds collied
But this would be purely mental suicide

All this pressure that's building up
Temptation makes me weak
The way you do the tings you do
Just take me back - take me with you

The barrier is there and closing in
Soon it will have passed me by
It meant not to be, I still want to go
And I can't stop wondering why
My conscious mind is fighting back
Unconscious though I may be
Dying - fighting - the trial, my choice to live again

All this pressure that's building up
Temptation makes me weak
Bending - giving in
Cannot live - got to be

Within the silence
The silence is complete
Within the silence
My gos - is dead - and lying by my feet
Within the silence

If you could see what I cannot be
You'd understand why I can't be whole
Life is piercing me on its spike
My unawareness is taking its toll
I can feel things you would never understand
The pain so satisfying in the silence
Everytime I go there someone bring me back
My calmness turning into violence

Only an arms length is holding me back
Reality flushed through my head
What I can see my hands cannot touch
The silence must not be fed
Sometimes - I wish I was there with you
There in the silence where our worlds collide
But this would be purely mental suicide

All this pressure that's building up
Temptation makes me weak
Bending - giving in
Cannot live - got to be

Within the silence
The silence is complete
Within the silence
My gos - is dead - and lying by my feet
Within the silence
