Active life surround my eyes,
like ants progressing to the hill
Back and forth a pole in the ground
something for time to kill
My weary mind, captured in this bundle of flesh,
my pleasure is my pain
Blind eyes can see your path is mistaken
those with lights - are those to win

I will - create - a labyrinth where all exists are shut
The cause - of death - mistaken since it's all in your mind

The way - of all flesh
Lust within flames beneath
The way - of all flesh
Again your conscience breathe

You trample your circles around,
both eyes shut, your god ain't crowned
Come to me and I'll seal your fate,
commit your sins and feel your hate
Reality is bound to be washed away,
open eyes will show the way
We are all and all are one,
we won't commit until all is done

I will - create - a labyrinth where all exists are shut
The cause - of death - mistaken since it's all in your mind

The way
The way
The way - of all flesh

The way  - I can see it
The way - I can feel it
The way  - Of all flesh
