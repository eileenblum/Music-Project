Look upon the adversary's living their lives in chairs
Gibbering mindless answers to questions
And governing the nation without care
So summon now against the mockery
You can't just syare in disbelief
Just listen to their crackbrained policy
You don't need this bullshit, but democracy

You're sitting in a cramped position, a change must be done
So gather now for the insurrection, now it's up to everyone
This is the hour of liberation for all who has lived in fear
Dispose the tyrant and his corrupted court, you must be severe

You've got to rise - against their policy
You need democracy
Justice - is what you want
It's what you need - to deny the prophecy - instantly

Testament to its sturdiness incoherent screams of fright
Sons of omission - break out of your prison
It's coming down, it's pouring down
It's falling can't you see - it's the way it's got to be
So defy the oppression - to create your own fate

Light - will you live to see the light
You may be sacrificed - crucified
Maze - you can't find the way
It becomes a possession to - defy the oppression
Nothing left - left to say

Vengeance upon your hatred oppressors
Before it's over blood will be shed
Weapons shattering human flesh
the unprincipled harvest is red
Under the pretence of restoring civil order
they send their armies forth
Impassive foemen choking the disorder

Fighting back but time is running short
Jubilant shouts died into whispers of fear
the mass is driven back
Nothing left that you can do
This is a cul-de-sac
So heed my counsel and don't let it happen again

We must take preventive steps
Do you like - what you see - all around
Is it what you want

You've got to rise - against their policy
You need democracy
Justice - is what you want
It's what you need - to deny the prophecy - instantly

Testament to its sturdiness incoherent screams of fright
Sons of omission - break out of your prison
It's coming down, it's pouring down
It's falling can't you see - it's the way it's got to be
So defy the oppression - to create your own fate

Light - will you live to see the light
You may be sacrificed - crucified
Maze - you can't find the way
It becomes a possession to - defy the oppression
Nothing left - left to say
