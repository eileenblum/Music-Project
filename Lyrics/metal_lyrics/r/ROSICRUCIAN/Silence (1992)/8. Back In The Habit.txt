Within your mind your brain injury has been transmitted
and it's multiplying piece by piece
You share your pain by giving death
as your hatred against society increase
A weak law government society in which crime pays
Slay a man and become a convict for a day
The organized criminality walks free as our laws decay
But scums like you will have their punishment

Death penalty in the public opinion
But with psychiatric care you're learn to conform
Mental disturbance since the birth is no excuse
for taking lives of the unborned
The lust to kill an irresistible temptation
a sickness without any cure
We've got to root it out with death condemnations
No salvation cause god doesn't exist

Be held responsible for your deeds
No more victims for your greed
We're demanding your death - or else you'll be
Back in the habit, habit again

Death penalty in the public opinion
But with psychiatric care you're learn to conform
Mental disturbance since the birth is no excuse
for taking lives of the unborned
The lust to kill an irresistible temptation
a sickness without any cure
We've got to root it out with death condemnations
No salvation cause god doesn't exist

Be held responsible for your deeds
No more victims for your greed
We're demanding your death - or else you'll be
Back in the habit, habit again

Schizophrenia is no excuse, for acting like you do
To slay is your only need,
it's disgusting to breath the same air as you do - you to

Your sanguinary delinquency mus have its final end
You deserve death penalty
How can you call yourself human - you're just shit to me

Be held responsible for your deeds
No more victims for your greed
We're demanding your death - or else you'll be
Back in the habit, habit again
