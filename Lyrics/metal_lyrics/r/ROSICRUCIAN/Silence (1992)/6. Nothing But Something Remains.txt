I'm sent down here to make you follow
Can you see the fear in the eyes of the one you betray
These eyes are your own, the gates to your soul
If you deny yourself it will take it's toll

I am the one and my message is content
Hold me above all or hold me in contempt
Followers of the slanderer, the hideous one
convert yourself, to father and son

The wrath of divinity has delivered me
To break the seals, to make you see
Reality is vanishing, drifting away
Day into night and night into day

A stillborn child, the gulf is empty
Forgiveness for your sins you ask of me
Ask yourself do you truly believe
Who's to give and who's to receive

What is my colour, what is my fate
Why am I sent here to this world of hate
Enlighten me, make me see
I need to know or I can't be

Father - I have sinned
Relieve me this burden I bear within
Give me salvation, now I see
I am all and lent to be

Does anybody wonder
Does anybody really care
If they'll go down under
When nothing but somethings remains

Riders of the apocalypse
The seven angels of death

Compressed wrath of god
Nothing but something remains

I'm the alpha, I'm the omega
The first and the last, the beginning and the end
The beginning you saw, the end you will not
Blessed is the powers that I have got

All is done, the seals are broken
I stand alone on the path I've chosen
All alone day after day
With no one to talk to and nothing to say

What is my colour, what is my fate
Why am I sent here to this world of hate
Enlighten me, make me see
I need to know or I can't be

Father - I have sinned
Relieve me this burden I bear within
Give me salvation, now I see
I am all and lent to be

Does anybody wonder
Does anybody really care
If they'll go down under
When nothing but somethings remains

Riders of the apocalypse
The seven angels of death
Compressed wrath of god
Nothing but something remains

The rivers have turned to blood
The sky is pitch black
Life has come to an end - silence

Does anybody wonder
Does anybody really care
If they'll go down under
When nothing but somethings remains

Riders of the apocalypse
The seven angels of death
Compressed wrath of god
Nothing but something remains
