Since the first ray of light created life
The mystery about this earth has been unsolved
a creation by a superior force
the only answer before the truth was to be told
Now when we have surveyed the reality
There are stills some dreamers who believe in the holy writ
The fear of death, to be forgotten in a grave
to slowly moulder away in a pit

Forced to believe in a celestial empire after death
This sound like crap to me
you're dead when you can't breath

Forgive us our trespasses and immortal we will be
and attain the divinity
The preaching of lies has spread out far to wide
but never during his ascendancy
I don't have to believe in a figure from a fairytale
I ain't afraid of no infernal flame
A believer or an atheist - the death will be the same

Forced to believe in a celestial empire after death
This sound like crap to me
you're dead when you can't breath

The cross - a sign of the crucifixion
of a son of god
For me just a sign of human blood
The faith - in a distracted mind
don't say no prayers for me
I am what I will be

Autocratic faith - what I can't see I can't believe
Autocratic faith - what I can't see I can't believe
Autocratic faith - you must obey your creators will
Shed no blood, do not kill
You must obey your creators will

The cross - a sign of the crucifixion
of a son of god
For me just a sign of human blood
The faith - in a distracted mind
don't say no prayers for me
I am what I will be
