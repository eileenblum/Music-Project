Why am I so lonely, it's time moving back
I sleep on the edge of my mind
Once I was stable, could act, I was able
I found all the things you couldn't find
False - spurious - the worlds you once said
emotional violence - left me for dead

This is the way - so people say
As I walk into the darkness
Along the walls - truth crawls
feeding on its own carcass
Fate - ripped away
Frenetic silence burns inside
Contaminate - the things I say
Don't feel my lies

Tell me do you know, who you're crucifying
Tell me do you know, who you're crucifying

You're so impure, so full of guilt
You taunt me with impunity
I must vanquish the sorrow, obliterate the fear
Get back into reality
Crushed - by your guile - I doubt my ability
Come oblivion - come deliver me

This is the way - so people say
As I walk into the darkness
Along the walls - truth crawls
feeding on its own carcass
Fate - ripped away
Frenetic silence burns inside
Contaminate - the things I say
Don't feel my lies

Tell me do you know, who you're crucifying
Tell me do you know, who you're crucifying
