Afraid of the pleasure, afraid of joy
Daddy's little incestious toy

You are so good you know it all
But there is no one there to catch you when you fall

What's your right, to ruin our fate
if money is all that matter s we'll pay with hate

Isolated in your own cute world
Too naive, to dumb to see
a life worth nothing be our guest we'll waste you for free

Mr harmless
It's time that you confess
Is it that tough
Mr harmless
Aren't you borned enough

Open your eyes, and see what you'll find
It's time to wake up narrow mind

Life goes on, you think you'll last
the day will come when you realize, you wasted past

Will you exist, the morning after
what has been means nothing, your death means laughter

Asexual freak
from reality you hide
the only way out for you is suicide

Mr harmless
It's time that you confess
Is it that tough
Mr harmless
Aren't you borned enough
