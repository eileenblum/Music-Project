You have lived your life in mystery
unaware of the unknown
You can still the body, but not the soul
of the feeling of not being alone
Your own deep mind is pulsing with life
but of this you nothing know
No time now to regret your choice
without salvation you will go

The immortal soul takes many bodies
acquiring experience and character growth in each
Discording each as it's use is fulfilled
and taking new ones until the highest is reached
The different viewpoints we all have
influence our attitude towards life in different ways
To the one, death is the end of all
to the other, just the end of a phase

The atheist belief the dark pit of life
A pit in which so many dwell
Denying the facts so often proved
You don't care, you do nothing
and you do it well

Esoteric traditions, the knowledge of the qabalistic tree
Esoteric traditions, the art of healing and esoteric philosophy

The right hand path is the one I'll tread.
