when you face the dark infinity you're standing where existence seize to be

take your last breath and the lights fading our eternaldarkness awaits say 
your final prayer and read the holy words then you realize its too late

now accept afierlife as a lie no resurrectionn when you know its time to 
die al your memories will always be gone you're falling deep down into oblivion

no it dosen't matter if you pray lying in the ground and rot away

take your las breath and the lights fading out eternal darkness awaits say 
your final prayer and read the holy words then you realize it'd too late

[chorus]
