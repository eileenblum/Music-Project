i breake the silence with another soul decay i'm always there when you're 
going insane

and when you're looking in the mirror you'll be staring in my face

you better know what i can do if you belive i'll take you crazy and i will 
never leave

and when you try to get away, i will come back yo you to haunt you once 
again

hear no evil, the begining of the end of the end see no evi, if you think 
i'm not your friend speak no eil, because you can not deny the deceiver, 
inside your mind

i am inside you now wherever you may go and you can feel your insanity 
grow

and if you try to use your head, i will return again to repossess your 
soul
