i fear for my life of sin
years of darkness are haunting me at nigth
my black soul of fire burns like
crosses in the sky
now listen to judgement day
behold all evil serpents
of the past
feel my vengeance like dragon
breathing down your neck
burning the bridge of fear now
figthing the ghost and demons
down
facing the witches of the dead
the ngels of death's
upon your head

don't feel remorse
of what i've done
you better face my wrath and run
i'm gonna make you feel insane
this is the future masterplan

listen to the tales of lies
all your search for piece of minds is
gone
like a ton of bricks i pound you right
into the ground
signs of apocalypse
appearing in the sky
before your eyes
wiht a tail of fire i am coming right
at you
ages of fea is here for you
it dosen't matter what you do
it makes no difference what you say
now i am here to make you pay

[chorus]

now you better listen to the voices
of the past
listen to the undertakers call
open your mouth
and take a bite of dacay
i'm the keeper of the evil crystal ball

[chorus]
