out of the twilight and into the black the words gas been spoken there's 
no turning back time's running out there's no future for you the moment 
will come at the time of doom

listen to choirs of the ritual killing behold all the servants of death 
you'll feel alone at your honor of pain feel the power rushing through 
your veins now

now join my ritual, se the candles, burns at the altar of human sarifice 
listen to the the evil chant , see the blood run red the steel of dagger 
cuts deep

into the cult of dmnation and fear preachers of blasphemy always is near 
victims of blood has been banished to hell

listen to choirs of the ritual killing behold all the servants of death 
you'll feel alone at your honor of pain feel the power rushing through 
your veins now

[chorus]
