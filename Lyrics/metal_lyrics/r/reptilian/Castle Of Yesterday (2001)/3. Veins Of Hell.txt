i've gone to dark places travelled to hell and back breathing fire always 
through bleeding eyes watching the flow of pain endlees misery

riding the vortex of agony and fear pain is the key when you're into the 
veins of hell

walking the path of the alredy long lost souls a journey of doo through 
the landscape the sea of blood

[chorus]

the final destenation is unknown to me walk forever inside the maze i am 
lost in the pits of hell trapped inside myself

[chorus]
