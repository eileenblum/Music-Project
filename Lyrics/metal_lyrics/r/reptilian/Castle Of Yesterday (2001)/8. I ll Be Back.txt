i want to feel you from inside, i want to keep you in my 
dreams i don't want to stand outside and watch you from behind never 
thought that i could give you give you what yo want never thought that i 
could take so take so much from me like a stranger so , i am feeling now 
and i dont know how , to expalin the things all the things that you broke 
down and cried what you ask you why always wanted to be so much closer 
that today always wanted to stay whit you like i did yesterday if you wnat 
to cry out now, well that's okay whith me if you want to keep your 
silence,it's okay with me, you never cared like a stranger so i am feeling 
now and i dont know how ,to explain the things all the things that you 
broke down and cried what to ask you why

hey, you will see , i'll be back in your dreams i will sing that old song for you

and let me take you to, where the skies are high and the voices of love 
will return to you when the time is fading away

you never tould was going on inside your mind you never showed me anything 
that i could still belive if i were you, i wouldn't turn my back againts 
the night there's nothing left for us unlees you see whats going on
we're falling down
like a stranger so, i am feeling mow
and i don't know ow,
to explin the things
all the things that you broke down
and cried
want to ask you why

[chorus]
