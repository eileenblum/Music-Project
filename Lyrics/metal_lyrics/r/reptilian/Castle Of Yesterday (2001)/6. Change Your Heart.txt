come to me i want you to be here close to me i always want you near 
sacrifised, mezmorized can't you make you disapear

never gonna live without you never gonna cara without you change your 
heart don't waste me never gonna live without you nevere gonna care 
without you change your heart change your heart change your heart

suddenly what used to be my dream ceased to be i am trapped in reality and 
i'am... sacrifised, mesmorized cant just make you disappear

[chorus]
