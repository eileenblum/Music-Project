tke it for granted i'll return, from theses days filled whith horor 
feeling abandoned in despair i will drown all my sorrow will drown all my 
sorrow home, the castle of yesterday calling me lost in a world full of 
fear no, i will not surrender to violence home when the ending is near 
when the ending is near leaving the present to the past, in a time where 
belongs endless reminder of what i had but where did the things go wrong 
where the things go wrong

[chorus]
