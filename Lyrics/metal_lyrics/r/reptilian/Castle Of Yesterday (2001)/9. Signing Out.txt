all you dreams were doomed
to fail
now your life is deadly pale
you betrayed me just behind my
back

when i sacrificed my time
you became the worst of slime
you were hiding all the cards from me

now take a good look
you're lonely
i hear you calling
i see you falling
i see you cring
i hear you lying
i hear you, you're screaming
i see you ,you're dreaming
i'm signing our

when we played it seemed so good
all was fine we understood
no one knew
what's gonna happen next

[chorus]

vanity is in your head
and it seems your brain is dead
thinking you are some kind
of genius

[chorus]
