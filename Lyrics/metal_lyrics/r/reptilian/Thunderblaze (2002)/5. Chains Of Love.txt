The day I met you, it was the day that changed my life
I was blinded by the  beauty of your eyes
First time I saw you, I was hoping you're the one

You took my heart and the feeling was true
You gave me love and I can't break free no matter what I do

You lock me up in chains of love
And I won't break out
You lock me up in chains of love
And I won't break out

My soul's on fire. You give me love, I'm burning up
Can't hide the feeling igive you love and I can't stop
Nothing can split us. Our love is harder than a rock

You changed my life, it was a new start
Love came around and I hope that we will never be apart

You lock me up in chains of love
And I won't break out
You lock me up in chains of love
And I won't break out
