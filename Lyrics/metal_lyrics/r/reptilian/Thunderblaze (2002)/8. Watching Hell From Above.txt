Let me tell you a story of strangers
That came from above
They were bringing some dark magic evil
You never dreamed of

Never trust a wish you have
Never trust a lady's crying
Always doubt the first advice
Time for you to die

See light in the dark
Came from stars
With an alien lust
Aiming for you, yes, you
Watching hell from above
A story of love
Something you should have known
Getting on you

What's the secret behind the masks
Facing you know
You've been fooled by nice looking faces
Ripping you off

Never trust a wish you have
Never trust a lady's crying
Always doubt the first advice
Time for you to die

See light in the dark
Came from stars
With an alien lust
Aiming for you, yes, you
Watching hell from above
A story of love
Something you should have known
Getting on you

See light in the dark
Came from stars
With an alien lust
Aiming for you, yes, you
Watching hell from above
A story of love
Something you should have known
Getting on you
