I will stop for no man. Gonna march all over you
And I will die laughing when I run you through
When the smoke is clearing, there will be bodies everywhere
I depend on metl. The sword's always my friend

I will hunt you down, using steel and sacred force
You will die by my hand and the blade

You'll be falling. I'll be standing. Death is rising
I'm the conqueror
Blood and honor. Battle fury death is rising
I'm the conqueror

I will hunt you down, using steel and sacred force
You will die by my hand and the blade

The quest for glory slaying enemies
Gazing at the stars and victoy
I'm a man of fire, an iron warrior
I'm made for fighting on the battleground

I will hunt you down, using steel and sacred force
You will die by my hand and the blade

You'll be falling. I'll be standing. Death is rising
I'm the conqueror
Blood and honor. Battle fury death is rising
I'm the conqueror

I am the master, the battle is calling
Your final moment has come, now you're falling
Hunting for blood and I walk over dead men
Fear for the soldier of death and destrution
