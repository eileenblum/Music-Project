All them storm clouds piling up lightning strikes tonight
Look up the blackened sky devoured the last light

Se blazing fire in your eyes
Your head's in the eletric vice

Do you feel the pain in the thunderblaze? A burst of fire
Got eletric veins in the thunderblaze. It takes you higher
Make  you wish the oain return delivering your heart body and soul
The sky begins exploding the death roll
Immortal thunder rushing when you're in the fire

The sky reveals its face of rage, releasing acid rain
Now you're in the power storm, all you feel is pain

Se blazing fire in your eyes
Your head's in the eletric vice

Do you feel the pain in the thunderblaze? A burst of fire
Got eletric veins in the thunderblaze. It takes you higher
Make  you wish the oain return delivering your heart body and soul
The sky begins exploding the death roll
Immortal thunder rushing when you're in the fire

All them storm clouds piling up lightning strikes tonight
Look up the blackened sky devoured the last light

The sky reveals its face of rage, releasing acid rain
Now you're in the power storm, all you feel is pain
