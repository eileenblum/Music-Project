Twistin' my mind in confusion
Drivin' my heart 'til it melts
Vengeance or dark retribution
Burning I'm hotter than hell

Here I stand with my pride
Here I'm standing and you're out of sight
And I'm asking myself was it all wrong
Was there something that I never knew?

You said it all, said it all, was so wrong
But I won't stop crying til you come along
Please hear my words or I will turn to stone
And I won't stop crying 'til you come along

Reaching for some existence
Sinking in deepest despair
Fighting invincible distance
Make-believe thoughts you are there

Here I stand with my pride
Here I'm standing and you're out of sight
And I'm asking myself was it all wrong
Was there something that I never knew?

You said it all, said it all, was so wrong
But I won't stop crying til you come along
Please hear my words or I will turn to stone
And I won't stop crying 'til you come along

Suddenly see your face
Reach out my hands, try to touch you
But there's no one there
There's not a trace
Suddenly realize all of the thing I've done
It's all been in vain
Help me!

You said it all, said it all, was so wrong
But I won't stop crying til you come along
Please hear my words or I will turn to stone
And I won't stop crying 'til you come along
