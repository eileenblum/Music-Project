Stop into this twisted world again
Ain't no use, there's no escape my friend
Once you're in, you start to look around
And you're facing destituted minds and no one knows
What I see through the window
Broken hearts and people selling souls
Still they go on

Madman city ain't no pretty
Place to visit
But it makes me feel good

Time for game don't get second chance
Hold your right you're caught within its hands
Once you're in, you start to look around
And you're facing destituted minds and no one knows
What I see through the window
Broken hearts and people selling souls
Still they go on

Stand alone you're skinned down
To your bones
There's nothing left, you can't go on
Can't go on
Everythinh you once had
It's all history
Yes! Everything is gone
Can't go on
No No No

Ain't no use, there's no escape my friend
Once you're in, you start to look around
And you're facing destituted minds and no one knows
What I see through the window
Broken hearts and people selling souls
Still they go on

Madman city ain't no pretty
Place to visit
But it makes me feel good
