The things I hear, the fading prayers inside my head
Embracing death
But still the blood runs through my veins
My rotting eyes are still wide open, seeing
The lights of burial ground
Left here undead left six feet under
Now hell awaits
Darkness calling me and I know death has just begun
Facing the grim reaper although I am still alive

I know life is at its end
Let the undertaker see the becoming
I am dying in my sleep
It's dawning of fear
I am still alive

I try to move, I try to scream in agony
Seeing the dark hearing the silence of the pain
Now I am doomed to be alone down here
The voice of death is calling me
Inside my mind I am alive 'til the end of time

Darkness calling me and I know death has just begun
Facing the grim reaper although I am still alive

I know life is at its end
Let the undertaker see the becoming
I am dying in my sleep
It's dawning of fear
I am still alive

Deep down in the ground I surrounded by soil
Entering the void of doom
Eyes wide open seeing the realm of death
I am facing the eternity of the zombie sleep
Infinite dreams of undead
I am falling into the pits of the living hell
Hearing the sounds of the funeral rites
I am alive and rotting away
