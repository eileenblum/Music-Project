Feel the force getting a grip on my bones
As the temperature's falling I'm turning to stone
By the time I got to you
Light swallowed by fear
And that moment, my eyes saw the truth
Love wasn't near

When the sun shines in vain
And the darkness will reing
The knight's bounds to come
Only those who are born
Under the stars falling low gonna know
Will I go, I don't know
Will I go again?

Listen up maybe it will be your name
Thry to stay out of being part of this game
By the time when evil breaks through
Light's all disappeared
Then all horror and terror will win
Dark times begin

When the sun shines in ven
And the darkness will reing
The knight's bounds to come
Only those who are born
Under the stars falling low gonna know
Will I go, I don't know
Will I go again?

Read the signs rainbow are falling
Hear the wolves cry with fear
See the trees, their leaves start to falling
Though the spring just go there
No more love, no more compassion
No more love, no more compassion
Frozen deep in our souls
Nature's struckwith inner disturbance
Will the knight reach his goal

Time

Time to die!!
