Sitting lonely by the window
Another raging storm in sight
Live or die tomorrow
Don't give a damn tonight
Wish I could see through time

Oh will I be the one, be the lonely one?
Don't want this kind of freedom
Oh sure you want to live this world we found
No, don't consider I do
How 'bout you
How 'bout you

Wind of truth is coming closer
Lock my door to hide away
Can't escape tomorrow
One-way ride to hell
Feel like I've been doing time

Oh will I be the one, be the lonely one?
Don't want this kind of freedom
Oh sure you want to live this world we found
No, don't consider I do
How 'bout you
How 'bout you

Lonely 'til the of time
Loneliness will ruin my mind, ruin my mind
Bound to meet the faith I fear
All alone through all these years
When you were mine, you were mine

Oh will I be the one, be the lonely one?
Don't want this kind of freedom
Oh sure you want to live this world we found
No, don't consider I do
How 'bout you
How 'bout you
