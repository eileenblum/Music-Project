when the time has come for the battle of gods
the time of regret is too late
the last season of dominationis here
releasing the slaves of the faith
sky is turningredand the clouds fills the sky
predecing the nightmare of fear
now it's too late to repent all your sins
the moment of jugement is here
i know you fear the divine annihilation
and messengers of hell
look at the sky for the signs of salvation
gates of evil open as you...

lift up your head and recive retribution
behold nemesis
open your eyes and look into redemption
behold nemesis

the kinddom of evil and eternal pain
is facing the power of light
no turning back or escaping the fate
in great agony you will die
you feel armageddon and listen to war
and still you expect to live on
deny the ilusion when you realize
the pain  really starts when you're gone
i know you fear the divine annhiliation
and messengers of hell
look at the sky for the signs of salvation
gates of evil open as you...

[chorus]
