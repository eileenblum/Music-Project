(Linder)Deep in the pits of your soul, You feel your blood begins to boil
The constant fear of my wrath it's the reality, your fate
Looking for another vengeneace with a burning eye
Searching for another victim in the sky, I fly on demon wings

Prowling in the sky Racingwith the wind
A shadow from below I fly on demon wings

I am the angel of fire I am the demon of lies
And put despair in your heart A silent  flying warrior
Looking for another vengeneace with a burning eye
Searching for another victim in the sky, I fly on demon wings

Prowling in the sky Racingwith the wind
A shadow from below I fly on demon wings

I am aiming at your hollow soul Bringing agony and sorrow 
I am watching when you face the end Keeping fire burning in your eyes
I am there to see your suffering Ready to bring out the devil

I am gonna kill you now, you are surely gonna die
Never gonna show another face of hesitation and I gonna see you falling
Into deeper misery and I will
See you in your final pain It will never go away
In the dark oblivion You're floating in the veins of hell and following the
Master plan and you behold the nemesis of never ending agony
And I am there when you begin to scream
The evil wings of demons they are flying right at you
And hear the voice of death is in your head
Now hell is waiting for you and I spread my wings of fire and I feel
The blood of demons in my veins
