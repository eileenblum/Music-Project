Enter, the human-god's theatre
An abomination of self-flesh creation
Acceptance is getting weak, regression
An endless attempt of digression
Igniting hatred into flames, combustion
Within this corrosion
Degenerating all solution
Triggering retaliation!

An encompassing trail of sickness,
Useless...remains

A corrupt judge presides
From certain injustice
Living hell that we breathe
Apostasy

Devious enigma
Haunting the world to collapse
A synthetic industrial machinery
Instrumental death

Subliminal verses, for the absinthe mind
A justified reason for redemption
An irony

A corrupt judge presides
From broken injustice
Living hell that we breathe
Apostasy
A triumph of all dirty greed
Embracing the sorrow
Injecting the insanity
Survival, aggression,
Reinventing reminiscence
Omission, decaying creation!
