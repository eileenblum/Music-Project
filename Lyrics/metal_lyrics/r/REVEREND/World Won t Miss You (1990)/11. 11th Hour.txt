A ray of light
A new child is born
A bludgeoned life
Emotions ripped and torn
From deep within
He cannot lose or win
When he was born
This child from hell
Condemned to sin

Evil schemes to manipulate and rape
More violence in this world
Of blood and hate
Don't want to go
The fear inside to die

Eleventh hour
Conscience calling
Eleventh hour
Die is cast
Eleventh hour
Sky is falling
Thrive on power
But it won't last

First time planned
He's setting course
The killing thoughts
And no remorse
He's getting slick
As time goes on
The death and bodies
Keep adding on and on

Evil schemes to manipulate and rape
More violence in this world
Of blood and hate
Don't want to go
The fear inside to die

Eleventh hour
Conscience calling
Elenth hour
The die is cast
Eleventh hour
Sky is falling
Thrive on power
But it won't last

Eleventh hour
Conscience calling
Elenth hour
The die is cast
Eleventh hour
Sky is falling
Thrive on power
But it won't last
Eleventh hour
Conscience calling
Elenth hour
The die is cast
Eleventh hour
Sky is falling
Thrive on power
But it won't last
