Revolution of youth
Rebellious they stand
Thriving on disobedience
No new attitude
No new means or way
To satisfy, hunger they crave

Use youth as a weapon
That you can't control
It's a world for the young
Out with the old

Find yourself powerless
In their hands
Authority stands no chance
With a gun to its head
Gun to it's head

In battle they clash
A war never won
For these gaping generations
Discipline, it clouds all their little dreams
Your support's all they really need

Use youth as a weapon
That you can't control
It's a world for the young
Out with the old

Find yourself powerless
In their hands
Authority stands no chance
With a gun to its head
Gun to it's head

How does it feel
Staring down the barrel
Welcome to madness
Hope I've lead you there

Revolution of youth
Rebellious they stand
Thriving on disobedience
No new attitude
No new means or way
To satisfy, hunger they crave

Use youth as a weapon
That you can't control
It's a world for the you
Out with the old

Gunpoint
Gunpoint
Gunpoint
Gunpoint
Taken at gunpoint
