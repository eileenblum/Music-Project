No, I can't believe my eyes
The memories are too clear
Your face shows no scars
Your hollowness so real

Please - tell me it's a dream

Frozen, moments lost
Remembrance of when
Our differences stood in the way
Beyond the shake of hands
Now the bombshell hits
I see it more and more
You shall be greatly missed

Please tell me it's a dream
This rude awakening
Through a different light we see
With a rude awakening

We take so much for granted
Till it hits us close to home
Once the seeds are planted
We sit and watch them grow

Maybe with luck it will go away
Hide the truth and force decay
Awaken

Maybe with luck it will go away

Now I see my grave mistake
With no chance to repent
My pride was so much greater than
My will to make amends
Hatred blinds our judgement
As our bridges burn away
Till where's nothing left to save

Please tell me it's a dream
This rude awakening
Through a different light we see
With a rude awakening
Please tell me it's a dream
This rude awakening
Through a different light we see
With a rude awakening
