I see a nine your old
Selling crack in this hole
A violent world, no self respect
No moral values left
Livelihood now is theft
Watch it crush you
Why don't we call it suicide

Keep all that shit away from me
Can't you see I'm no fool
Tempt your fate, fuck with me
The world won't miss you

Struggle to meet supply
People demand their high
Sedating masses, no questions asked
Our sons and daughters raised
Into this blinding maze
Resisting pressure from their peers

Face to face, don't turn away
I need to know what motivates
Genocide, the poison crutch
That consumes your life with lust

Keep all that shit away from me
Can't you see I'm no fool
Tempt your fate, fuck with me
The world won't miss you

Hey man, how can you face each new day
What gives you the right
To take another's life
And expect yours to be saved

Face to face, don't turn away
I need to know what motivates
Genocide, the poison crutch
That consumes your life with lust

Keep all that shit away from me
Can't you see I'm no fool
Tempt your fate, fuck with me
The world won't miss you
Keep all that shit away from me
Can't you see I'm no fool
Tempt your fate, fuck with me
The world won't miss you
