Walking alone
In his mind where he storms
Rules have been laid there
He fails to conform
Tell him the lie
Teach him to die
Send him to war
While he's questioning why

Watch the canvas
Grow crimson each day
Dear God, just stop it
They'll take you away
Do what you're told
Don't try and be bold
Leader of fools now
I'm joining your fold

See them laugh
While we bleed
In their eyes
We're deceived
What we are to the gods
All our lives just facade

So now it's finally
Come down to just this
Saying goodbye
With a sweet Judas kiss
The actor's last day
In an ignorant play
All that is done
Now there's nothing to say

See them laugh
While we bleed
In their eyes
We're deceived
What we are to the gods
When our lives have all gone
