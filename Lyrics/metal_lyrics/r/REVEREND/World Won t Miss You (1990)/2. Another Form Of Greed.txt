Just got ripped off
For something that you worked for
Get some revenge
Gonna make somebody bleed
They faked your mind
You think they're your friends or
No one's there in your time of need

Give up your life
And they've taken your soul
Highway to hell
And you're paying the toll
Vengeance is sweet
So says your creed
It's all just a form of greed

You've had enough
Been used for many reasons
Took it all
Sick and painful abuse
Made some mistakes
In loans, some cash, some treason
Now you realize
You've been taken on the blues

Give up your life
And they've taken your soul
Highway to hell
And you're paying the toll
Vengeance is sweet
So says your creed
It's all just a form of greed

No time to rest
You've got some heavy plans laid
You're fading fast
It's getting too late
Poisoned veins
Or a bullet to the head
Your last request
You know you'll soon be dead

Give up your life
And they've taken your soul
Highway to hell
And you're paying the toll
Vengeance is sweet
So says your creed
It's all just a form of greed
Give up your life
And they've taken your soul
Highway to hell
And you're paying the toll
Vengeance is sweet
So says your creed
It's all just a form of greed
