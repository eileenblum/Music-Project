A row a scars that cut me
Way too deep
I'm numb to life anymore
So just let me be
Can't seem to scratch and pick
On life as earth as known
Can't come back
It's too late now

Seems to feel like candles in the wind
They're going still strong
No one will win

It's way too late to feel bad
For yourself
The damage has been done and you're
Going down
Can't seem to scratch and pick
On life as earth as known
Can't come back
It's too late now

So many times to fall out
So many times
This world has left us out
Out in the cold
Cold sun is finally going down
Your life is worthless now
And you're going drown
Your hate and spite that drives you insane
Put the gun to your head and you've lost all that pain

Took the fire
Burning you higher
You threw it away
You could feel it
Taking you down
Now your life's blown away

So many times to fall out
So many times
This world has left us out
Out in the cold
Cold sun is finally going down
Your life is worthless now
And you're going drown
Your hate and spite that drives you insane
Put the gun to your head and you've lost all that pain
Threw it away
Dropped the fire
Taking you higher
Threw it away
Threw it away
Threw it away
