Betrayed, you've lost your face
Disappear without any trace
Shortened lifespan
Cutthroat, you've lost your usefulness
More of a burden alive
Loose ends are no sacrifice

Nonexistent, silence breeds
Memory lost, nothing seen
Patiently, with no remorse
They let the blood run its course
A bullet lodged in your brain
Ice running through their veins

Meet an early grave
No secret safe
You choose your fate
Killing time
Bonded by blood, red communion
Your creation
Killing time

Your life is at their dispense
Fine line, can't repay your debt, no way
Hunted, fair game, easy prey
Torment, leaves you no escape

Sitting duck, no time to wait
Guinea pig, used as bait
Target, one blast
No pain, there's death on impact
Silenced threat, put at bay
Secret's lost, DOA

Meet an early grave
No secret safe
You choose your fate
Killing time
Bonded by blood, red communion
Your creation
Killing time
