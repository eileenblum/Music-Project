Nightmare coming true
Reality so vivid, can you face the truth
Logic, don't you realize
We're blinded as the propaganda rules our lives

Torn and frayed
What's left of this life we've made
A tiny glimpse
Of a world that we haven't seen since

Money controls us all
I've had it up to here with your path of sorrow
First fuck and take no names
One mans loss is another mans gain

Desperate
Desperate
Desperate
Desperate

Torn and frayed
What's left of this life we've made
A tiny glimpse
Of a world that we haven't seen since

I've seen the future, the outlook's grim
Child of tomorrow is cursed to live
Endangered species, they'll drop like flies
Who's going to answer their desperate cries to live

How could we let it slip away
At such a cost, an utter waste
What must it take for all to see
Death for mankind because of his greed

I've seen the future, the outlook's grim
Child of tomorrow is cursed to live
Endangered species, they'll drop like flies
Who's going to answer their desperate cries to live
