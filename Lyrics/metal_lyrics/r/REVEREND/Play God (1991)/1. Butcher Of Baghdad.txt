Naughty, naughty, little boy
Grown up now still play with toys
Arm your soldiers, show your strength
Wave your colors to war's brink

Follow him - his banners fill the blood red sky
Preaching, beating
Pounding hatred into his people's minds

So damn us now, dictator rules
Making wise men play his fools
Sing his praises, the master calls to you

Feed the people all your lies
Gaining power at what price
Desert kingdoms in the sun
Now the bloodshed's just begun

In our veins flows blackest crude
The lifeblood of mankind
His hands upon our throat and balls
Now he starts to squeeze

So damn us now, dictator rules
Making wise men play his fools
Sing his praises, the master calls to you

Unsuspected fatal gasp
People die from mustard gas
Babies born from man-made wombs
Soldiers rape the healing rooms

Young men die for all your sins
In a war nobody wins
To pay for the atrocities
We'll bring you to your knees

So damn us now, dictator rules
Making wise men play his fools
Sing his praises, the master calls to you
