Look in my mind - tell me what you see there
Is it not dying? Oh, dying

Paradise - once belonged to me, yeah
And now it's dying - oh, dying

Force-fed culture, who am I?
Someone I may never find
And it'll be the death of me
It'll be the death of me

Look to the sky - the clouds rain down on me now
As if they're crying - oh, crying

The world's at war - our fight should be for peace
But no one is trying - oh, trying

Force-fed culture, who am I?
Someone I may never find
And it'll be the death of me
It'll be the death of me

I try and try so why can't I
Control this rage inside of me?
Now I hide behind these eyes
My innocence has died

Look in our world - tell me what you see there
Is it not dying? Oh, dying

Politics - should set our minds on fire
But they're all lying - oh, lying

Force-fed culture, who am I?
Someone I may never find
And it'll be the death of me
It'll be the death of me

I cannot see who I should be
And it will be the death of me
The death of me
