Slide down a rail of razor blades
Bathe in acid rain
Your bed of nails, a good night's sleep
Old wounds reopening

They're pushing, provoking
They warp the mind - you must obey
And they're coming to take you away

Dying on a crucifix - you sadomasochist
Distorted visions of liberty
Denying all you know to be free

They're pushing, provoking
They warp the mind - you must obey
And they're coming to take you away

Beware of strangers bearing gifts
All they want is censorship
A smiling face can take you down
Pounding your head into the ground

They're pushing, provoking
They warp the mind - you must obey
And they're coming to take me away
