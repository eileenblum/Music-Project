Do you know what you're looking for?
Can't seem to get it right
If you saw it plain as day
You'd be blinded by the light

Can't you see what this does to me?
Suspicions start to grow
Toying with my confidence
What does the future hold?

Time won't wait this time
Please make up your mind

Don't let the world pass you by 
Here's your morning wake-up call
One chance to see what sticks
When we're thrown against the wall

Time won't wait this time
Please make up your mind

Tight rope walking, light-speed talking
Speaking not a word
Are you afraid that chance you take
Might jeopardize your worth?

How far can you bend before
You break the live you got?
You think you know what's going on
What is or is not hot

Now our lives hang in the balance
Waiting for the word to go
All our bags are packed and ready
But still the door is closed

Time won't wait this time
Please make up your mind
