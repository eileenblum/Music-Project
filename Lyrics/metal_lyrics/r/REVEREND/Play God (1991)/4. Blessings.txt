Shine down a ray of hope â to vigil over me
Speaking words as they come
My heart knows what to say

Listen, I beg of you â before time slips away

Who's to say they're right or wrong
It's just something we must face
When ignorance fuels the firestorm
Giving guilt someone to blame

Listen, I beg of you â before time slips away
Free them and spare all of my pain

Take what you want from me
I'll die to set others free
But I know what your intentions hold
You'll be the death of hope

I laugh inside, you clip my wings
I sit and count my blessings
Cure in hand, you watch me bleed
As I close my eyes in eternal sleep

Into the ground they lower me
I pray someday you'll learn
That evil stalks our immunities
And pleasure bears a curse

Listen, I beg of you â before time slips away
Free them and spare all of my pain

Take what you want from me
I'll die to set others free
But I know what your intentions hold
You'll be the death of hope

I laugh inside, you clip my wings
I sit and count my blessings
Cure in hand, you watch me bleed
As I close my eyes in eternal sleep
