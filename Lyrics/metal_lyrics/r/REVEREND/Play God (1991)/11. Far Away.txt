Silence is the only sound that I can hear
Trying to recall anything that was real
Numb through my veins,
Greet the coldness, I embrace
Take me far away from yesterday

Sift through my life
That lies shattered on the ground
Cutting my fingers, the pieces won't sort out
Turning away, I can never look back
Help me understand the reason why

Still the air is quiet
All the questions hang unanswered
Sitting by your resting place
I gaze into your past

Oh, tell me why you've left me here 
Alone and by myself - together on that night
When Death called your name 
And finally took you home
