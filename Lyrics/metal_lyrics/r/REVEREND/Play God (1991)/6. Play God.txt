I hide what I feel inside
It seems better locked away
Mainline opinions - no middle ground in hate

Salted wounds bubble with pain
As we plummet deeper in our headstrong ways
We're seen for color, judged for race
It's a vicious circle man must face

Oh, to be free again, but no
We'd rather - Play God with violent intent
Play God in our twisted heads - Play God

Programmed at birth, for what it's worth
Truth we're not to see
A history that's handed down
A hatred you can't see

Games we play every day - they vary with the fool
Shape the thought, mold the crowd
Manipulate the tool

Oh, to be free again, but no
We'd rather - Play God with violent intent
Play God in our twisted heads
Play God nothing left to be said - Play God instead

When you know you've bought
Conditioned thought
Quick, run the other way
But for every one that sees the light
There's ten to take his place

We'll play God - Play God - Play God
