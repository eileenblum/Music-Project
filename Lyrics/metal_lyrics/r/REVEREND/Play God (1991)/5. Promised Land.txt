Trust in me, my pretty one
Surrender all, you must succumb
The void awaits impatiently
As you pray the Lord your soul to keep

Close your eyes, take my hand
I'll take you where you've never been
Come and rest your weary head
As I lead you to the Promised Land

Down, down, now there's no way out
You see you've gone astray
You'll scream, and try to shout
Your lifetime torn and frayed

Drenched in sweat, your body cold
You leave behind your troubled world
All your anger, all your fears
Once in my arms, will disappear

Peaceful slumber beckoning
The lure of pleasure reckoning
Dreams of what you'll never have
Lie beyond the Promised Land

Down, down, now there's no way out
You see you've gone astray
You'll scream, and try to shout
Your lifetime torn and frayed

Come with me, I'm the man
Walk with me to the Promised Land

Down, down, now there's no way out
You see you've gone astray
You'll scream, and try to shout
Your lifetime torn and frayed

Down, down, now there's no way out
You see you're here to stay
You'll scream, and try to shout
Your life's been torn away
