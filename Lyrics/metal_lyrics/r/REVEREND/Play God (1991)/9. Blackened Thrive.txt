Brave with our words, yet sharp as a knife
So offensive to you, to others they inspire
These words I so abuse are called my Freedom of Speech
So listen if you like, but don't tell us what to speak

Do you know? Did you see my show?
Feed me controversy
And realize the blackened thrive
Ban me, I guarantee
I'll capitalize on your closed mind

Pray for your children, I'm here to take their souls
Hear my secret message, my marketing hoax
Denounce my name and tell all your folks
I'm the one last great Satanic game show host

Do you know? Did you see my show?
Feed me controversy
And realize the blackened thrive
Ban me, I guarantee
I'll capitalize on your closed mind

Never in you lifetime
Have you been in control
They used to cut our tongues out
Now they tell us "Vote!"
So righteous in your anger
We smell your slow decay
The people are all sick
Of everything you say

Do you know? Did you see my show?
Did you listen? Do you care?
Feed me controversy
And realize the blackened thrive
Ban me, I guarantee
I'll capitalize on your closed mind

The blackened thrive - the blackened thrive
