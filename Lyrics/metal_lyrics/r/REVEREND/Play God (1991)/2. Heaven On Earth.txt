Swinging like a wrecking ball
Tearing down these four grey walls
Chains of slavery gone away
New aggressions, grave mistake

Show me all that I have missed
Trapped away in the abyss
A heart of stone, a madman's pain
A world so cold, defiance ensures gain

I've seen Hell, you all were there
Paying for what you've done to man
Your bodies raped, your souls all burned
The price you pay for Heaven on Earth

Deep in blood, repent my sins
Why ask God to forgive?
Jesus loves me, yes he does - Ha!
But Satan laughs, he knows he's won

Lay in the lion's den
Flesh is what you feed to them

I've seen Hell, you all were there
Paying for what you've done to man
Your bodies raped, your souls all burned
The price you pay for Heaven on Earth

Now lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

The jaws of death open wide
To swallow those of us inside
The scales of justice far outweigh
The price of sin for which we pay

Heaven - Heaven on Earth

I've seen Hell, your souls are burned
The price you pay for Heaven on Earth
