Embrace those divine hands and sit
cocoon in the breath of our fire
Embrace our warmth
Share in this momentary laughter
Sing its praise
Come sit around this fire
Comes rest your woes
Wayfarer, let them guide you
From where only loss awaits
Place yourself on the pyre
And join us in our dance
Where is the voice
Where is the sound
Where is the whisper
Bring us he who lifts their mouth
Brings us he who takes copper from their eyes
Atone, and collapse
Gabriel sound your horn
Bless our souls
