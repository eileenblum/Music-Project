Embrace in the hands of the divine
Cocoon in its warmth
Embrace and share in a moment
And sing its praise
Come rest by a fire
Come rest your woes sweet wayfarer
Come rest from burdens embrace
First for a few moments allow
Me to express my ways
A creed of isolation in silhouettes
Oddly familiar, and oddly at peace
Quietly weeping, a dance in the breath of embrace
Quietly sleeping, never noticed
Quietly offering, a home for those lost souls
First for a few moments allow me to express my ways
A creed of salvation, one of disbelief by name
But faith in gracious movements
Are you quietly weeping
Are you quietly offering
A quick and quiet resolve
Glutton bested me
Actions of want and desire
Glutton bested me with roots bound reaches
To blend with those of no will
