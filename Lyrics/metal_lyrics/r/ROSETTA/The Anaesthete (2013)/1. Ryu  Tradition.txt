Indulge securely this apology
Where silence is salient
Where silence is still
Indulge this offering
Forgive my silence
Embrace the atonement
Embrace the silent
Embrace the outpour
Vacate the angst
Atone and sing
Confess and rest your sweetly wings
Sometimes I think that these stars
Are calling me back, calling me home
Please accept this small offering,
The dim light of gods
Come now and rest
Come rest well
Sometimes I think these stars
Are fireflies of home calling me
In the silence I'll atone, collapse, embrace
