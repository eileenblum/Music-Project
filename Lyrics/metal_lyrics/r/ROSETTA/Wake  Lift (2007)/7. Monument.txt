We are moments, men, and places.
We are planets, monuments to stars.

Monuments to aid souls
They are the watchmen,
we are just man

Release
Revolve
Renew

These strings, I'd change the fabric to relieve

These strings hold the last of memories

These strings hold the whole of every man

Inhale
Transfer
Release
