The Turkish army's on the march against
The Crusaders on retreat
The canon roars and the city falls to the enemy
Thousands were sacrificed, driven away at night
Lost their goods
Enslaving the young, killing the old
That's how the story's told

The Christian knights, Dracul on their side
Stop the sultan's invasion
They hold the fortress, ride on their horses
Straight through the enemy lines
Fight them down, most die on the killing ground
The rest runs away
The banner held high up in the sky
The sign of victory

Far away against the demons force
They just fight like brothers in arms
With fear and hate they follw Draculs call
They just fight like brothers in arms

Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like

Far away against the demons force
They just fight like brothers in arms
With fear and hate they follw Draculs call
They just fight like brothers in arms

Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like - Brothers in arms
Fight like - Brothers in arms
