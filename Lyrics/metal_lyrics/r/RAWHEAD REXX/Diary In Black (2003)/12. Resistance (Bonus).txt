We've heard about his terror
Will it last forever?
Spreading the disease
Force the people on their knees
Take them down to the ground
Hope is lost and never found
Again and again they try to break
The chains that prevent them to run away

Living in the underground
Like phantoms and we make no sound
Fight against the terrorist
Forever we resist

We are the - resistance
We are the - resistance

He massacres his rivals
Wrote his own holy bible
Put his knis in your gut
Write his words with your blood
You have to fight for your lfe
We give the power to survive
We gotta stop this terror
So we'll be free forever

Did you hear the message last?
"I'll never let repeat the past"
If you read between the lines
You will find the lies

We are the - resistance
We are the - resistance
We are the - resistance
We are the - resistance

Living in the underground
Like phantoms and we make no sound
Fight against the terrorist
Forever we resist

We are the - resistance
We are the - resistance
We are the - resistance
We are the - resistance
