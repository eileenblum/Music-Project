I'm on the way to the land
Out in the sand
Heat burns my mind
Hope that the kingdom will come
The light of the sun
Is making me blind

Some day we fly away and
Find the promised land

Saint, saint and sinner
The beginner of a perfect world

The noise of destruction's still there
Ending somewhere
Not far away
Search for a safe place to hide
In the cold night
Where we can stay

Some day we fly away and
Find the promised land

Saint, saint and sinner
The beginner of a perfect world

We're saint and sinner
Saint and sinner
We're saint and sinner
Saint and sinner
We're saint and sinner
Saint and sinner

Saint and sinner
The beginner of a perfect world
Saint and sinner
The beginner of a perfect world
