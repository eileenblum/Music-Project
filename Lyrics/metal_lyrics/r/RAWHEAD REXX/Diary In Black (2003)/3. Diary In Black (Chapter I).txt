He grew up in the land of the half moon
The sultan's the almighty god
There's no rescue lying in the dungeon
Torture and pain he'll never forget

Muslim against the Christian, history repreats
Once put into the prison for there's no release
Years gone by in slavery, hatred reaches it's limit
Before is was too late he could escape

Every word is written with blood - diary in black
Shining souls are buried in the moat - diary in black

He grew up in the land of the half moon
The sultan's the almighty god
There's no rescue lying in the dungeon
Torture and pain, he'll never forget

Every word is written with blood - diary in black
Shining souls are buried ni the moat - diary in black
Every word is written with blood - diary in black
Shining souls are buried ni the moat - diary in black

Diary in black
Diary in black
Diary in black
