Black soul, white light, so different in it's primal way
Rising sun the tides of sea belong together till the final day

Hate to love
Love to hate yourself
Enslave the evil
In man, in man, the evil in man

Evil dreams born again
You awake at night, there's silence
Pump pressure in your brain
It's gonna make you violent

Hate to love
Love to hate yourself
Enslave the evil
In man, in man, the evil in man

Demon shadows on the wall
Wander around, follow a call
Scary faces staring at you
Searching for something crawling to you
Invoke your dark side
Release you from the evil might

Hate to love
Love to hate yourself
Enslave the evil
In man, in man, the evil in man
In man, in man, the evil in man
In man, in man, the evil in man
In man, in man, the evil in man
