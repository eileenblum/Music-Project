I'm waiting in my cell for what will happen to me
The chiming of the bell reminds me of the land of the free
The years in the darkness has marred my eyes
But in my mind I still can see the beautiful sky

I walk the winding road
Up to the fields of gold

The time has come, I'm six feet from the edge
All my life I have no regrets
Time has come, I'm six feet from the edge

I can hear the footsteps coming down the floor
I can feel their presence when they reach the door
Is it fear or is hell near, veins feel like fire
My mind's clear, I disappear flying higher and higher

I reach the heavens gate
Into the light I fade away

The time has come, I'm six feet from the edge
All my life I have no regrets
Time has come, I'm six feet from the edge

I fly into the sun
Lord, I'm coming home

The time has come, I'm six feet from the edge
All my life I have no regrets (have no regrets)
Time has come, I'm six feet from the edge
The time has come, I'm six feet from the edge
All my pride I'll never forget
Time has come, I'm six feet from the edge
