I'm a master, I'm a prodigy
Don't trust your eyes 'cause it's not what you see
I'll take away your pain and free your mind
You will never be the last in line

I promise you freedom, the heaven on earth
Destroy the oppression, create a rebirth

Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call

Metal gives you power to survive
Break down the wall and fight for your life
Protect your home against the evil might
I'll guide you thruogh the battle side by side

And even the angel of death will appear
The bible of metal will kill your fear

Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call

Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call - to the metal war
Follow my call
To the metal war
To the metal war
To the metal war
To the metal war
