The dragon's born into a murderous world
But no one knew it will get much worse
Water will turn into blood
And soon it will water the ground

The tears all like rain in the garden of pain
Brightness is fading away

The army in black is coming back
Return of the dragon - dragon

Child out of hell grew up in a death machine
With hate in his eyes he's out of control
He follows his rule and kills all the fools
When ever they get in his way

The tears all like rain in the garden of pain
Brightness is fading away

The army in black is coming back
Return of the dragon - dragon

The tears all like rain in the garden of pain
Brightness is fading away

The army in black is coming back
Return of the dragon - dragon
The army in black is coming back
Return of the dragon - dragon
