Tonight the stars shine bright and the sky is clear like water
Mountains high through the valley the river floats in glitter silver

The land of my own is gonna be strong
King of the world, protect my home

Dragonheart is fighting for the victory - Dragonheart
Dragonheart is gonna set us free

The rain is falling and it washes away the crime
The pain is fading if we stand the test of time

All for one and one for all, freedom call
That's what we're fighting for

Dragonheart is fighting for the victory - Dragonheart
Dragonheart is gonna set us free

Dragonheart is fighting for the victory - Dragonheart
Dragonheart is gonna set us free
Dragonheart accept nothing less than victory - Dragonheart
Dragonheart is gonna set us free
