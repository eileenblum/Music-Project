Say what you want, say what you feel
Say what you like, say what you will do
Promise me love, promise me hate
Promise me everything, don't hesitate

Watch every step you take
Watch every move you make
Sounds like words from an old song or is it fake?

I'm the machine
Keep your mind clean
I'm the machine

Cut out your heart, cut out your soul
Right from the start, get you under control
Forgiveness will fail, your life is for sale
It don't cost a dime and no one will pay

Watch every step you take
Watch every move you make
Sounds like words from an old song or is it fake?

I'm the machine
Keep your mind clean
I'm the machine

Say what you want, say what you feel
Say what you like, say what you will do
Say what you want, say what you feel
Say what you like, say what you will do

Watch every step you take
Watch every move you make
Sounds like words from an old song or is it fake?

I'm the machine
Keep your mind clean
I'm the machine
