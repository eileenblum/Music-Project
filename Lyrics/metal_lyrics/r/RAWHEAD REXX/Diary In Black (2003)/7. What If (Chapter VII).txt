Sitting here in darkness watch the rain fall down
Feel your shadow stroking down my skin
I try to hold your hand but I'm all alone
The whisper iof your voice is just the wind

The days drift on and on
I'll never know the reason why you're gone
Blood on my hands, again?

What it we're side by side
What if I throw the line?
What if you'd caught the rope?
Whenever I just try to turn back time
I try to ease my mind

You're laying down the stairs, your heart gets cold
I close my eyes and fool myself
We're walking hand in hand the long and winding road
Up to the sky and touch the sun

They say they told you I'll nevr cine back again
Out in the fields I'd died and gone
I'm still here and I will find you

What it we're side by side
What if I throw the line?
What if you'd caught the rope?
Whenever I just try to turn back time
I try to ease my mind

What it we're side by side
What if I throw the line? (The days drift on and on)
What if you'd caught the rope? (I'll live until I find you)
Whenever I just try to turn back time
I try to ease my mind
Forever
