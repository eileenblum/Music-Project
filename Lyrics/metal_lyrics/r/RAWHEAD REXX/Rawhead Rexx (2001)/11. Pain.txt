An old man in an old house
Some kind of silence is around
He's lonely you think he's a good guy but don't trust your eyes

Cause
Pain
He's searching for
Pain
He's back for more
Pain
His goal is to spread the pain
Pain
He's searching for
Pain
He's back for more
Pain
His goal is to spread the pain

He offers a drink and some food
Then he takes them home
When time's right with his evil might
He kills them and they may roam

With
Pain
He's searching for
Pain
He's back for more
Pain
His goal is to spread the pain
Pain
He's searching for
Pain
He's back for more
Pain
His goal is to spread the pain

In his dreams he's back in time
When he was a young guy
Dressed to kill these lower kind
Of the human being
He's proud to be a part of this system that builds a mankind
That's strong and armed to stand the test
Of time and other dangerous minds
The rush of blood still in his vain
This killer instinct lives on the evil thoughts burned in his brain
Will never stop to hold on
Clean the streets from tramps and scum
The mission he is chosen for
He's the hunter of all crime
He's the horrible ruler

Pain
He's searching for pain
He's back for more
Pain
His goal is to spread the pain
Pain
He's searching for pain
He's back for more
Pain
His goal is to spread the pain
