In a dark morning hour he's coming into town
People said the way he's walking
Seems like he was gliding around

Living in the house upon the hill he never leaves
Standing at the door with open arms
He is spreading disease

Out of hell he's coming
From dusk till dawn
He steals away our souls
With black eyes he's watching
Just for someone
Who's following the wild
Wild and dangerous

Scream
Follow the scream
Follow the scream

Dealing with the dream of all these ordinary guys
Changing all the things they're proud of steal away
Things they can't hide

Out of hell he's coming
From dusk till dawn
He steals away our souls
With black eyes he's watching
Just for someone
Who's following the wild
Wild and dangerous

Scream
Follow the scream
Follow the scream
