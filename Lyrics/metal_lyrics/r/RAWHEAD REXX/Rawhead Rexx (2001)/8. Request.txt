Aggravation across the nation
Termination instead passion
Words unspoken visual talking
Nothing common that could be broken

Hide your feelings stop just kneeling pull the trigger you just deliver
From what your hating this awful cheap thing
You never needed you never feel it

Why should we try
Why should we try
Request will be denied

Horror vision strange decision
Request will be denied

Constitution's a disillusion
Same old story so don't be worried
Mind relocation - isolation?
Slave and master become world disaster
Fight for freedom fight for honor
Bloody mission mind transmission
No corruption in this nation
What a joke there's no expectation of life

Horror vision strange decision
Request will be denied
No more anger that's what we fight for request will be denied
