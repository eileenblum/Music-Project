The first time in this place
Blinded by your lovely face
Can't stand the inner might can't let you out of sight

I had visions of love and freedom
My emotions were filled with pure feeling
So tell me
Why i've got blood on my hands
And my heart is bleeding
I try to remember what i've done
That you're still sleeping
I try

Next time at your place
I fell in disgrace
By acting that way
Destroying the gate

You opened for me
To come close to your heart
Throw an arrow straight into
And cut it out
That is why i've got blood on my hands
And my heart is bleeding
I try to remember what i've done
That you're still dreaming
I try
Yes I try

I had visions of love and freedom
My emotions were filled with pure feeling
So tell me
Why i've got blood on my hands and my heart is bleeding
I try to remember what i've done
That you're still sleeping why i've got blood on my hands
And my heart is bleeding
I try to remember what i've done
That you're still dreaming
