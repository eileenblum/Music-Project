I'm the man with a mission sailing over sea
To bring you what you need
Under god and king I'm serving
You have to believe me I grant you creed
Feel my desire the unholy fire
Set out by the sacred storm
Trust in god gave me the power
To decide between death or life

The sacred mission's still alive,
We fight for the holy war spreading the vision of the might,
We fight for the holy war

We conquer the world with might from below
And if we need to we fight for the gold
We need "presents" for the church to rule the world,
Don't be afraid you infidel slave
I'm the messiah on earth still the fire
Will burn till the world is done,
For everyone who's without trust,
I give you this warning your life will turn to dust

The sacred mission's still alive,
We fight for the holy war
Spreading the vision of the might,
We fight for the holy war
Division will show you the freedom

The sacred mission's still alive,
We fight for the holy war
Spreading the vision of the might,
We fight for the holy war

The sacred mission's still alive,
We fight for the holy war
Spreading the vision of the might,
We fight for the holy war
