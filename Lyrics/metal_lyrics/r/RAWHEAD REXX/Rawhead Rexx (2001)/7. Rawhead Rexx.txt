I've got the devil inside of me
Don't believe
Full moon rises every night
Casts shadows over me

Feel so unsatisfied
Can't stand the inner might
Loose every ground connection
Loose every range of sight

I feel so insecure
Wait for a wonder cure
My heart will break in two
The darkness in my soul
Makes me to play this role

Rawhead rexx
Loosing ground connection
Rawhead rexx
My only self protection

Transmission in my head
Are gonna drive me mad
My needs are out of reach
That's what I can't cope with

I feel so insecure
Wait for a wonder cure
My heart will break in two
The darkness in my soul
Makes me to play this role

Rawhead rexx
Loosing ground connection
Rawhead rexx
My only self protection

I feel so insecure
Wait for a wonder cure
My heart will break in two
The darkness in my soul
Makes me to play this role

Rawhead rexx
Loosing ground connection
Rawhead rexx
My only self protection
Rawhead rexx
Rawhead rexx
Rawhead rexx
Rawhead rexx
