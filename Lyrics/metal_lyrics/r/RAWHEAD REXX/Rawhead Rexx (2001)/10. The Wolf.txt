Can you remember what the old man said
His words were filled with fear and hate can you forget the sparkle in his eyes
Oh lord that's when he told his tale

Hundred years ago
The creature coming through the snow
Killing all the people
Ripping every kid that lived here in town

It's the wolf
The wolf
The wolf
Howling creature
It's the wolf
The wolf
The wolf
Howling creature

The moon is rising in the dead of the night when man changed into wolf
The taste of blood is gonna drive it mad
Its nature calls he's on the loose

Now it's back
It resurrects this awful scenery of course there's none who survive
His deadly misery

The wolf
The wolf
The wolf
Howling creature
The wolf
The wolf
The wolf
Howling creature

Hundred years ago
The creature coming through the snow
Killing all the people
Ripping every kid that lived here in town

The wolf
The wolf
The wolf
Howling creature
The wolf
The wolf
The wolf
Howling creature
