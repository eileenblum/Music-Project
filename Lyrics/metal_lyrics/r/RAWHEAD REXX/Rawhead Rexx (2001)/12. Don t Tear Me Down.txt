I'll never forget the words you said
The day as my faith was dying
Imaging the time we never had
Feeling the pain

Without a trust in a better place
You can't have fortune anyway
It's easier said than done my friend
To play this game

Now i start walking the winding road
Feels like my shoulders are overload
Search for a sign it's out of sight
Just darkness is killed by the light

Don't tear me down
Down to the ground
Don't tear me down
Down to the ground
You evil evil evil master of pain

I should never loose my inner will
Never give it away
I am the one who will pay the bill
The price is to high to pay

The time is come to leave this masquerade
This foolish game I play
To stop this unruly hate

Now I start walking the winding road
Feels like my shoulders are overload
Search for a sign but it's out of sight
Just darkness is killed by the light

Don't tear me down
Down to the ground
Don't tear me down down to the ground
You evil evil evil master of pain

Don't tear me down
Down to the ground
Don't tear me down
Down to the ground
You evil evil evil master of pain
