Rolling on a lonely highway
Somewhere out in no man's land
Frozen ice at night in dessert
Burning heat a day out in the sand

Reach a town far out in a valley
The sky is black the thunder roars
Empty streets no friendly welcome
Staring shapes standing in the doors

When the day turns into night
Something evil's there
You can't control these darkened might
Makes you despair

Town of skulls
Town of skulls

At moonlight people change to zombies
Without any heart or soul
Search for human being suck their life out
Just to take control

When daylight turns into night
Something evil's there
You can't control these darkened
Might makes you despair

Town of skulls
