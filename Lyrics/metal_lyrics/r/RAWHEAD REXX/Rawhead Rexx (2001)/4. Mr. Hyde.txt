When the daylight's fading
There is danger in the air
Murder's in the street
The fear is everywhere
Another dreadful action
Another kill in town
The phantom disappears but the killer's still around

Creeping in his darkened tomb
He changed to mr hyde
Vision of a better man
He changed to mr hyde

Chemical reaction
Is what he needs in life
Forms that don't work
Cut him like a knife
Fanatic obsession
To play another roll to be another man
Makes him lose control

Creeping in his darkened tomb
He changed to mr hyde
Vision of a better man
He changed to mr hyde

His magic potion works he falls asleep
Yes his common sense is getting weak transmissions in his mind begin to start
What a pain please forgive me my god

When the daylight's fading
There is danger in the air
Murder's in the street
The fear is everywhere
Another dreadful action
Another kill in town
The phantom disappears but the killer's still around

Creeping in his darkened tomb
He changed to mr hyde vision of a better man
He changed to mr hyde
