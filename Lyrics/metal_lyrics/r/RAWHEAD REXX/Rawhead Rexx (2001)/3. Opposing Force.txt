Twilight shining bright
When he's coming out his eyes are open wide
An angel's face in this place
Is so unusual but it is beautiful

She feels like stone the moment she gets in touch
Mister nice guy's acting that so much

Darkness and coldness
Come slowly upon the end of life
With his fingertips on his lips
He smiles to her but he just lies to her

Kiss of death from lips that taste so sweet
Evil breath makes her fall asleep

Opposing force
Opposing force - occult magic
Opposing force
Opposing force - or higher tragic

Opposing force - don't trust a stranger
Opposing force - beware of the danger
Opposing force - he's coming to get you
Opposing force - why do you belong to
