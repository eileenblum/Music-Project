In the land of the burning horizon
Lives the man about i'm telling this tale
He calls himself holy messiah
But his words come straight out of hell

He preaches heaven on earth
That the holy church
Will survive

His believers are begging for freedom
And for a better life in paradise
But the price they're to pay for salvation
Is to die with the prophet lies

He preaches heaven on earth
That the holy church
Will survive
When armageddon is near
They make their sacrifice
Without any fear

Sons of mayhem
Sons of mayhem they are
Sons of mayhem
Sons of mayhem they are

They don't hear the laughter
Coming straight out of hell
They're under his spell
But they don't hear the laughter
The laughter
The laughter

Just like lamb by the slaughter they follow
To the altar of sacrifice
Their way is slaved with sorrow
Believing his words till their death

He preaches heaven on earth
That the holy church
Will survive
When armageddon is near
They make their sacrifice
Without any fear

Sons of mayhem
Sons of mayhem they are
Sons of mayhem
Sons of mayhem they are
Sons of mayhem (they're sons of mayhem)
Sons of mayhem they are
Sons of mayhem (they're sons of mayhem)
Sons of mayhem they are

In the land of the burning horizon
Lives the man about i'm telling this tale he calls himself holy messiah
But his words come straight out of hell
