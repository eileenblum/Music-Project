Walking under pressure
Through divided depths
With a wall of water
On our right and left
The surging waters standing
Firm like a wall
The deep waters congealed
In the heart of the sea
Darkness upon us
Oppressors behind us
Desperately wanting to survive
I believe in victory
I believe in light
I believe that one day
We will arrive to our destiny
I believe in victory
I believe in life
I believe in Him
Who will lead us through darkness
Baptized in the sea
Renewed to follow him
Dying to our own desires
Giving birth to his schemes
Darkness upon us
Oppressors behind us
Unshakably determined to survive
I believe in victory
I believe in light
I believe that one day
We will arrive to our destiny
I believe in victory
I believe in life
I believe in Him
Who will lead us through darkness
The Lord is our strength and our song
He has become our salvation
When we pass through the waters
He will be with us
And through the rivers
They shall not overtake us
When we walk through the fire
We shall not be burned
I see victory
I see light
I see us
Fulfilling our destiny
I see victory
I see life
I see Him
- The Son of Man
Sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One
And coming on the clouds of heaven
[Ex. 15, Is. 43, 1 Cor. 10, Rom. 6, Mark 14:62]
