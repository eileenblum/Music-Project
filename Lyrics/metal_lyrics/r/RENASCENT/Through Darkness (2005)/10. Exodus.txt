Drifting in the wind of the Nile
The one made to set his people free
Chosen - not because of his deeds
But by God's sovereign will
Called by God from a burning bush
Anointed to do his will
To rescue the Israelites from their misery
And to bring them to their own land
Listen, O heavens, and he will speak
Hear, O earth, the words of His mouth
Signs and wonders will follow him
For he will proclaim the name of the Lord
"I am the Lord, the great I Am,
And I will break the bondage of slavery
I will redeem you with an outstretched arm
With mighty acts of judgment
So now, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh
To bring my people out of Egypt
Go! I will help you speak
And teach you what to say"
Listen, O heavens, and he will speak
Hear, O earth, the words of His mouth
Signs and wonders will follow him
For he will proclaim the name of the Lord
In your unfailing love You will lead
The people You have redeemed
In your strength You will guide them
To your holy dwelling
You will bring them and plant them
On the mountain of your inheritance
- The place You made for your dwelling
The sanctuary your hands established
The Lord is a warrior
Sabaoth is His name
Your right hand, O Lord,
is majestic in power
You throw down those
Who boldly oppose You
You blow with one breath
And the sea covers them
The nations will hear and tremble
Terror and dread will fall upon them
Who among their false gods
Is like You, Lord?
Who is like You
- Majestic in holiness
Awesome in glory
Working wonders?
The Lord will reign forever.
[Ex. 1-15, Deut. 32, Ps. 78 &amp; 106, Is. 52:11-12, Micah 7:15]
