The Lord reigns in heaven and on earth
Robed in majesty and armed with strength
Your righteous throne is from all eternity
Your Kingdom cannot be moved
The seas have lifted up
The seas have lifted up their voice
The depths have raised up
The depths have raised up their pounding waves
How great are your works, how profound your thoughts!
How immense are the halls of your justice, how high your ways!
Your statutes stand firm, holiness adorns your house
You are exalted for endless days!
Mightier than the thunder
Mightier than the great waters
Mightier than the breakers of the sea
- the Lord on high is mighty
The Lord reigns in heaven and on earth
Robed in majesty and armed with strength
Your righteous throne is from all eternity
Your Kingdom cannot be moved
Ps. 92 &amp; 93
