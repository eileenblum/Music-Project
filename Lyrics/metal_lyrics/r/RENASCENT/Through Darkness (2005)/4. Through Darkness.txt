I see darkness around me
Uninvited spreading its fear
Burn their eyes burn their souls
Walk them through the fire
We can make a difference
By choosing right from wrong
- Creator of Life
Break the chains and let our souls dwell in the light
The vermins among us
Infesting what once was pure
Evil entwining
Our spirits so vague
The frustration
Of this cynical world
Hatred is born love is torn
But in the end we will prevail
Beware of your judgemental thoughts
Denial of truth, thirst for blood
The conviction is yet to come
The hourglass counting its time
We can make a difference
By choosing right from wrong
- Creator of Life
Break the chains and let our souls dwell in the light
The vermins among us
Infesting what once was pure
Evil entwining
Our spirits so vague
The frustration
Of this cynical world
Hatred is born love is torn
but in the end we will prevail
They fooled themselves trusting an illusion
That solid path will take them nowhere
We can make a difference
By choosing right from wrong
- Creator of Life
Break the chains and let our souls dwell in the light
The vermins among us
Infesting what once was pure
Evil entwining
Our spirits so vague
The frustration
Of this cynical world
Hatred is born love is torn
but in the end we will prevail
