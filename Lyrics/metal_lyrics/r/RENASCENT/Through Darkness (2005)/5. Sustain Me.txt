I hear the screams from beyond
The power of my memories
So fragile and weak
Some end to this pain I seek
I live among these stones
The living dead and bones
Light is here by God
But the reflex is dark
I want this to end
Spirit of love be send, now
The heat of my blood fires on
Adrenalin in my veins
Afraid of my thoughts
And this thing of my brain
Iâm at the end of this way
O God I know what you say
I know Iâm saved
But I am dirty and raved
Please fill me up with your spirit of hope
Have mercy on me, O God
According to your unfailing love
According to your great compassion
Blot out my transgression
Wash away all my iniquity
And cleanse me from my sin
Let me hear joy and gladness
Let the bones you have crushed rejoice
Restore to me the joy of your salvation
And grant me a willing spirit
To sustain me
You are awesome, O God
You, who answer my call
You bring life to the stones
Even to the dead and bones
I walk among the dark
But your light is my guide
You have lifted my life
To the depths of your love
Ps. 51
