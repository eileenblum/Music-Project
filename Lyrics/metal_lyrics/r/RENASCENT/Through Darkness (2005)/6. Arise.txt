Arise, shine
For your light has come
And the glory of the Lord
Rises upon you
Darkness covers the earth
Thick haze is over the peoples
But the Lord rises upon you
And his glory appears over you
Nations will come to your light
Kings to the brightness of your dawn
Pass through, pass through the gates!
Prepare the way for the people
Build up, build up the highway!
Remove the stones
Raise a banner for the nations
Lift up your eyes
And look about you
Your sons and daughters
Come to you from afar
The wealth of the seas
Will be brought to you
To you the riches
Of the nations will come
Then you will look and be radiant
Your heart will throb and swell with joy
Pass through, pass through the gates!
Prepare the way for the people
Build up, build up the highway!
Remove the stones
Raise a banner for the nations
Awake, awake, O Zion
Clothe yourself with strength
Put on your garments of splendor
Shake off your dust
Rise up, sit enthroned
Jerusalem, the holy city
Pass through, pass through the gates!
Prepare the way for the people
Build up, build up the highway!
Remove the stones
Raise a banner for the nations
[Isaiah 52, 60 &amp; 62]
