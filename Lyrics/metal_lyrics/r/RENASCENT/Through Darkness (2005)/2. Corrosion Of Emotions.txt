Empty hollow minds
Weary fragile souls
What is the meaning of your life
You're walking endless miles
Broken lies, fallen skies
Sorrow deep within your mind
Why keep digging down deep into the pain
Walking among the living dead
Dwelling in the supremacy of sorrow
Corrosion of emotions
No escape when redemption is lost
Why decline eternal life
Repent
Or you'll find yourself swimming in the Lake of Fire
Worthy is the Lamb seated on the throne
His blood has covered our sins
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
Whoever believes in Him shall have everlasting life
Why keep digging down deep into the pain
Walking among the living dead
Dwelling in the supremacy of sorrow
Corrosion of emotions
No escape when redemption is lost
Why decline eternal life
Repent
Or you'll find yourself swimming in the Lake of Fire
You raise your head up to the skies
Change your ways like the shifting tides
Have you lost the sense of time
Completely blind to see the signs
Heaven and earth will pass away
But His Word will endure
There will be signs in the sun and the moon
Distress of nations with perplexity
Your pain can be healed in His name
Your shame taken away
'Cause our Lord has conquered the grave
By His grace we are saved
[John 3:16, Luke 21:25,33]
