Warriors of the morning
I call you forth into battle
Warriors of the morning
Stand fast and obey
You are a people
The nations have not yet observed
A people that the Church
Has desired and waited for
I call you out
Of dry and dead religion
I call you out
Of self-serving and man-made rules
I whisper and call you to come forth
And stand fast in the liberty of the Spirit
Come forth
And be inspired
Come forth
With dedication
Come forth
With purity of heart
Come forth
For I have risen
To be your King
Let the warriors of the morning arise!
The sons of the living God, coming forth in the Spirit
Will change the spiritual atmosphere
And correct the way of the nations
By bringing forth the power of divine purpose
I call you out
Of dry and dead religion
I call you out
Of self-serving and man-made rules
I whisper and call you to come forth
And stand fast in the liberty of the Spirit
Come forth
And be inspired
Come forth
With dedication
Come forth
With purity of heart
Come forth
For I have risen
To be your King
I have a sword in my hand
And I go forth to battle
Come, My people, and be empowered to join Me
In this battle of the end of the age
Come forth
And be inspired
Come forth
With dedication
Come forth
With purity of heart
Come forth
For I have risen
To be your King
Let the warriors of the morning arise!
