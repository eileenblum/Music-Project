The truth is not so hard to find
Open your eyes and you'll realize
The fool has said in his heart
Chaos around, there is no god
They have chosen to suffer
To believe in nothing
Deeper and deeper the wounds they cut
Scenes of a tragedy
Ignorance is walking by their side
Broken promises all the time
Nations standing in confusion
Without answers or conclusion
Only the fool has turned aside
Fighting the truth burning their flesh
Less they hear less they believe
Blind leading the blind
Dead eyes see no future
The simple truth they fear
Hollow cold despair, shattered realities
Betrayal is at hand, vanishing into the void
They have chosen to suffer
To believe in nothing
Deeper and deeper the wounds they cut
Scenes of a tragedy
Ignorance is walking by their side
Broken promises all the time
Nations standing in confusion
Without answers or conclusion
Only the fool has turned aside
Fighting the truth burning their flesh
Less they hear less they believe
Blind leading the blind
Blindfolded points of view
Why don't you accept the truth
Wake up, wake up
Why walk in the deepest pit
When you can ask for his graceful hand
Jesus.. Jesus
Ask for His hand
Ask for salvation
And youÂ´ll be saved
Ignorance is walking by their side
Broken promises all the time
Nations standing in confusion
Without answers or conclusion
Only the fool has turned aside
Fighting the truth burning their flesh
Less they hear less they believe
Blind leading the blind
