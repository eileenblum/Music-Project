On the cross a human shape lost its form, blood and mockers' laughter
Pain and blood-thirsty viewers, bruises and evil words
An innocent man dying slowly and painfully as people watch and despise
Betrayed by a friend, He is left to die
The Son of God
Who has come to take the sins of the world
He was crucified
For all our sins and iniquities, like a lamb led to be slaughtered
He was in the world, and the world was made by Him,
And the world knew Him not
Persecuted and defamed like a malefactor
Cursed for the goodness of His acts
Finally sentenced to the uttermost death
No one knew what this man was intended to do
The Son of God
Who has come to take the sins of the world
He was crucified
For all our sins and iniquities, like a lamb led to be slaughtered
Left to die
That we may gain eternal life
Abandoned
A man of sorrows and suffering, rejected by all
He was in the world, and the world was made by Him,
And the world knew Him not
