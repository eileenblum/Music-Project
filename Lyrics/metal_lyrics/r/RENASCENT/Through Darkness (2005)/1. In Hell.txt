Born to this world of pride and deceit
Dropped out of life, no place to fit
Pushed around and trampled on the ground
Left aside, choosing to hide
Being alone, trapped in silence
Living in shame, is everything in vain?
Do I want to live?
Do I want to die?
What will happen then? Is it worth to try?
The gates of Hell are wide open
Enter into suffocating darkness
The unseen horrors in the furnace of fire
Burning torment, rotting in pain
In Hell it's too late to realize
That it is worse than this life
No release by suicide
Without forgiveness and sacrifice
We are all condemned to burn in fire
Cold, corrupted world filled with lies and despise
Busy, wasted lives and hollow, empty eyes
Searching for success, working night and day
Finally drained empty and thrown away
Being alone, trapped in silence
Living in shame, is everything in vain?
Do I want to live?
Do I want to die?
What will happen then? Is it worth to try?
There is only One who can save you from this hell
The Son of God who shed His blood for our sins
The ultimate sacrifice to forgive our wrongings
And whoever calls His name will be saved
The gates of Hell are wide open
Enter into suffocating darkness
The unseen horrors in the furnace of fire
Burning torment, rotting in pain
In Hell it's too late to realize
That it is worse than this life
No release by suicide
Without forgiveness and sacrifice
We are all condemned to burn in fire
Jesus save me!
