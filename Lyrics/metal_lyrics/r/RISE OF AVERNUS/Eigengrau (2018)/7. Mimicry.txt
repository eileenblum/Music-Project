Passage of time
The bleakness of unraveling sanity
enticing to my eyes

A static pattern

A duality of awareness
This moment an eternity

Invading my subconscious
This daemon takes control
Swirl to grey

I fall, it wanes
A separation splinters
My soul is stripped
From fragments
To shards into decay...

One inside...
Pieces redirected
One inside...
And spawn into continuum...
