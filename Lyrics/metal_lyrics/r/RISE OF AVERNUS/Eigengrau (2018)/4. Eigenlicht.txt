Smoke swirls between the teeth of these oceans
A cognitive fracturing of the line
Between grey and nothingness
A perception
A projection
To soften the edges of our abilities
To see the whole

A visual static we cling to
An incompleteness
Distortions obscuring our sights
To overcome the void

Although we dwell
So sightless
We see a shade
A ghost of light

An inability to comprehend
Encompassing nothingness
So fearful we are
That we lucidly hallucinate
For even within a place
Where light can't exist
We still seek it
We still long for it

To overcome the void...
