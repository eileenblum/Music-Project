Within this cell
Horror in the mind divine
Scar the flesh with purifying flames

The mind is a shell today
Trying to get sense of control
Outside the death of life, mine
Witness the sign
the godhead destroyed for you

Failure bleeds you
Welcome to the end of time
Come, reflect
And stare into our vacant eyes

Existence is meaningless....

Ruled by my will
Exit this vessel
Void of incandescence
Destroying all that is me

Wipe the ground
Crush the bone
Into dust lying scattered
Accept the end of my life
