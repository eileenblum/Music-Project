Into the dawn
A faded memory
A story once told
Of rebirth into slavery

Ages have gone
Manipulation fruitful
Plagues of lies swarm over man
Imminent extinction

One moment, total awry
For once was fascination
is now a light to lead the blind

Wounds open wide
Splintered into a self mangled mind
A nightmare to behold
No solace and nothing to hide

Granted absolution
For sins that have now come to light
Shame, sin and power
Now gaze upon the circle of time
