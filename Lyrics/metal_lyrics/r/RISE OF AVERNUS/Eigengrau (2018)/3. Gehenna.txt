Fade to silence
Shallow, sinking, drowned
My emersion
Body at one with dirt

Within this cold earth
I seek the refuge promised to me

I've opened a world
Now forsaken, everything I knew

Once again I see the reason
Empty and afraid
My faith into nothing remains
Feel the anger seething
Guilt and suffering
As my soul is rotting away

What was this faith bestowed upon me?
Questioning this final betray
Beneath the lies, a sordid memory
Begin to tear through the veil

Transcendence, another reality
Flooding of visions
Shattered into entropy
