This rope that binds this moment
Coiled, now unwinds...
Retrained, embracing torment
Fractured soul and mind
A grand sense of failure
Awareness fades
A witness, I'm emanating
Into the unknown

Strain, sickness, dismay
reality splinters
Husk, sapless, no longer yield
Pass to the grey...

Begin disintegration
Call to the sky!
Winds echo within this torment
Neotoric rise!

Unseen Into Atherium
Taken away
Resolve into the source of
The beginning of time
