Scatter the flock
Disperse all that serves
To keep the zealots
Bound here
Release and dissolve
The shackles on our will
So rusted
So tarnished
Sever the strings
Which have forced us to mime
This grotesque matinee

So convinced of severance
That we were cut away
Blind to the fingers which pull us
Each and every way
This hold, never relinquished
Choking more each time
The cycle repeats

There's no air left
Reprieve so far away
The strangulation grows with
Every breath we take
In this anoxic tempest
We become the fray
Embodiment of war

The inner pulse distorting
Slipping out of time
To create a constant misconception

This aberrant line
The masses mourning
A prelude to the mass of silence
