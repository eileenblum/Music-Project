I've been alseep for what feels like a century,
Dormant I lie encased in this cell,
Come wake me from my slumber,
Only you can break this spell...

Imprisioned within this hell,
I scream but you can't hear me,
Like a bird forgotten in it's cage,
I cannot forfeit freedom,
Now that I've had a taste.

Poison swells inside my fragile limbs,
Tormented I lie encased by walls of glass,
I scream but who can't hear me,
Frozen I make no sound

Imprisoned within this hell,
I scream but you can't hear me,
Like a bird forgotten in it's cage,
I cannot forfeit freedom,
Now that I've had a taste.

The spell is not broken,
By my will of fire,
A lustful desire haunts you til the end,
A mannequin lifeless,
Suspended and timeless,
As you lay in your decay,
I know you cannot be saved,
Still your essence lingers on inside my heart.

Beneath the frozen hand of time,
I kneel before such beauty,
Immortalised by death,
Her lifeless body still calls to me.

Trapped with my own thoughts,
Of injustice and remorse,
You were my last hope,
Nothing left but sorrow,
I surrender.....
