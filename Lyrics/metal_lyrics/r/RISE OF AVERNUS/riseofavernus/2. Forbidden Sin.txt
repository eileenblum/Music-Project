I promise that I will never speak your name
I will keep you in secret
Even if I will never feel your touch
Even if I will never taste you again
I will take this to my grave

Barriers crumble every time I stand before thee
Suffering in silence
You pass right through me
... and I will take this to my grave

I keep you in secret
You pray on my every weakness
A wash of colour fills in the grey lines
As my body trembles beneath your commanding presence
I am but a puppet that bends at your will.

You light up the bleakness
You know that I can not resist
The look you gave could end my life
Over a thousand times

Barriers crumble every time I stand before thee
Suffering in silence
You pass right through me

Lie with me
No-one will ever know
Divinity of this moment
Shall never be
Tainted or unveiled
This forbidden sin it tastes too pure to sour
