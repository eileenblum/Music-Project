I stand here alone
Taunted by voices I can't decipher
The wind whispers my name
But I'm afraid to listen

Come with me to the valley
So I can reward you
And I will spare you from the uncertainties of life
Enter the darkness where I hide
Worship me and I will make you my queen

With only my thoughts to keep me company
I wait for her to join me in this tomb
You waste your innocence on those who only mean you harm
What purpose does it serve to the restless mind?

Just say the words and I will grant your darkest desires
We belong together forever

She will meet her peril here
Like those before her
Blood will be shed

I've got nothing left to lose
And I have given all I can bare to this meaningless pursuit

In the absence of clarity give me your hand
And I will grant you the silence you seek
