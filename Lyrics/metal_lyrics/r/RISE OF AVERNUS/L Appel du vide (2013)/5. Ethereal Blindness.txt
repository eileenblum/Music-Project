Judgments arise
A mindless callow hatred desecrates all life
A prison of flesh
A paradox of meaning echoes through our minds

And I close my eyes
Instead of witnessing the failures of mankind
We have not learned
A new day brings another promise unfulfilled.

Betrayed by loss
Corruption settles in my conscience like frost
Distorting my sight
There is nothing that can ease my jaded mindâ¦.
Hideâ¦ as your lies coming crashing down
But I will care no longer now
