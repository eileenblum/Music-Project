Facing a withered, splintered line
The empty vessel is born
Fragments dissolve and redefine
Thos parasite breathing life within me

Shadows destroy the light
And knowingly shape themselves
They criticize all of my darkest fears
Of past woes left behind

Illusive words
Ignite the fires of despair
Refuse the truth untold
And remedy fear

The darkness that surrounds us
Cannot hurt us
It is the darkness in your heart
You should fear

Drawing closer to the vivid now
A veil of ruin now ablaze
Broken and weary
Thoughts will deceive you
Time and time again
Weâre all still falling through this place
And I canât find serenity

Lucidity dwells within me
I now sanctify my suffering
Abandon my fear

Ignite the fires of despair
Glory adorned
No longer weaken
