Within the mist, envenomed waters
Beyond her will, in desolate darkness
Crimson lines around her shadow
The final dirge from glass into ashesâ¦.

In peril lies porcelain painted in crimson
No soul can hear the cries
That drift through the mire

So take one more shallow breath
For it shall be your last
The abyss awaits in silence

And I will taunt you
Till you bore me
No one can tame the beast within
And I will hurt you
If you let me close enough to crawl my way into your skin.

I am the shadow cast in the moonlight.
I am the shiver that runs down your spine
I am the nightmare that keeps you from sleep but you let me in
