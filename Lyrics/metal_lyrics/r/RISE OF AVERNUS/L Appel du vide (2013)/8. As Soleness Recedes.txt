Vain glorious, world is your own now
No longer affected..
As you reach for the dream, that is the way of flesh
Promises hallowed

With each passing moment, the breath is more shallow
The outside fades away
Grasping the past, remoted ignorance
The splendor fades away

Emptiness
Now a shell
Seed of demise
Suffering
Disillusion
A tainted divide
From homage to absence
Into obscurity
Slaves dance on Into the sound of nothing
