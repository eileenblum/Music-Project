Maybe I have come to see the light
Beneath the bludgeoning
Lies a truth I cannot hide
Within this darkness calls
And I wait for one to find
The key that sets me free

The hurt inside you is a rumour
With one caress your walls fall down
There is no fear here only freedom
My voice will guide you if you listen
â¦ If you listen

For years Iâve tried to find a cure here
But still she comes to me at night
Confounded lovers blind intentions
These fading memories haunt me still

Coiledâ¦
As passion devoured by flame
Winter has martyred his heart
Lifeless and cannot be saved
Tearing purity apart
Desolation now remains
Transgressions of once was bound
Her scenery turning to grey
As sorrow is all that is found

Lamenting in mirthless sorrow
As your voice draws me near
This requiem will not relent
In the years since youâve passed
Echoes of your cries still torture me
And I can still hear your screams

Maybe I have failed to see the plight
As those around me fold
Within this reckoning
Stands a creature from my past
Still waiting to be saved
Disenchanted remain
