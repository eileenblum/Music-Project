Beneath a veil of false smiles and laughter
The pain creeps in
So I put on a mask to conceal the magnitude of losing you
But in every spare moment
My thoughts return to you

So I have no choice but toâ¦.

Embrace the mayhem
Vanquish the darkness
Your only enemy is your own mind

I can no longer hear your footsteps
So I must wander this path alone
Still I cling to your cold remains
As the greatest part of me is slipping away

In every spare moment my thoughts return to you
âcos in my mind you are still alive
Let me keep my sweet delusions

Iâve saved you so many times before
But this time itâs different
Canât rescue you from the rain that passes through the soil
And as it breaks down your body
Soon youâll be nothing more
Than brittle bones beneath the ground

In every spare moment my thoughts return to you
