Fearâ¦. An ominous darkness
Within the still of silence, in virtue paradise beckons
Lossâ¦. Into the heart of all ruin
The unsung awakening, yearningâ¦ devoured frailty

Coldâ¦ Staring eyes
Formlessâ¦ The weakening structure
A shadows reflection within my disdain
A myriad of voices are one in the same
Fall into embers, a weakening will
The sorrow and rapture
The inner light has diedâ¦

Iâve tried to salvage all the pieces of what you left behind
And now I canât recognize myself anymore

Severing the strings to life
All the glory and the suffering
The beauty of what is left behind
Lost, the memories wash over my eyes
And I slowly fadeâ¦.
Into dreams beyond life
