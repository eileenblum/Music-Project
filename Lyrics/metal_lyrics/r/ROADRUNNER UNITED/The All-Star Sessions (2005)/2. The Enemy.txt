I finally found myself
I tried to erase all this hate from my body
I tried to end all the lies, all the pain that I caused everyone
But it all seemed so fucking useless

I canât forgive
And I canât forget
Donât you know who the fuck I am
Iâm the enemy

Iâve lived a life of regret
Iâve had this burden of guilt suffocating
Itâs time to shed this disguise
And itâs time to rise and destroy
Everyone in my fucking path

I canât forgive
And I canât forget
Donât you know who the fuck I am
Iâm the enemy

Take a good look at me
Iâm your enemy

Donât try to make amends
Thereâs just no need to pretend it will all be ok
You can try to run and you can try to hide
But itâs all fucking pointless

I canât forgive
And I canât forget
Donât you know who the fuck I am
Iâm the enemy
