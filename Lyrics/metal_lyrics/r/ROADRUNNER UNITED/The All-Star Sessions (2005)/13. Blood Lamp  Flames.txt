You thrust the knife into my side with words you say you realize
That I came to speak of what I see no matter what you do to me

I stand --- no compromise --- I feel --- prepared to die

Falling, our lives were led astray when we fell from grace
Calling, your life wonât be denied when washed with blood and flames

You thrust the knife into my side with words you say you realize

I stand --- no compromise --- I feel --- prepared to die

My life for yours, this raging war, as I stand in the midst of darkness screaming

Falling, our lives were led astray when we fell from grace
Calling, your life wonât be denied when washed with blood and flames

My life for yours, this raging war, as I stand in the midst of darkness screaming
We know our roots, we know the truth, the strength of our foundations

I stand --- no compromise --- I feel --- prepared to die

Falling, our lives were led astray when we fell from grace
Calling, your life wonât be denied when washed with blood and flames

My life for yours, this raging war, as I stand in the midst of darkness screaming
We know our roots, we know the truth, the strength of our foundations
