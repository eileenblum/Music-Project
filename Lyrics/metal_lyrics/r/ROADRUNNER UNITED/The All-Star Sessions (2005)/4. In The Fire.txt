âConfessâ¦ Witchâ

I see the moon outside
With its evil grin
Watching the priest tonight
Accusing ME of sin

Oh, help me, âNo, you're gonna dieâ
Oh, help me, âNo, just say goodbyeâ

In the fire, on blackened wings I fly
In the fire, to Hellâ¦ and then I dieâ¦
Oh it's still the same
Can you tell me why?
Witches then are Witches today

âConfessâ¦ Witchâ

A thousand years of pain
Between here and then
Did we all die in vain?
Oh it's just insane

Oh, help me, âNo, you're gonna dieâ
Oh, help me, âNo, just say goodbyeâ

In the fire, on blackened wings I fly
In the fire, to Hellâ¦ and then I dieâ¦
Oh it's still the same
Can you tell me why?
Witches then are Witches today

âDie Witchâ¦ Now go to Hellâ

In the fire, on blackened wings I fly
In the fire, to Hellâ¦ and then I dieâ¦
Oh it's still the same
Can you tell me why?
Witches then are Witches today
