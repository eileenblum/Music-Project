Like an earthquake racing through the fault line
Silent stalkers creep
Ardor of a tangible delusion skewing what remains as real
A sinister and unexpected raid infiltrates like a thief unheard
Demarcation of coherence and delirium crumbles to the floor
Comprehension awry

Vacillating powers of the spirit formally at war
Dialectics failing by the minute
Imps possess the child she bore

Fractured soul
Constitution down
Hope is gone
Allocate the unsound
Constitution down
Allocate the unsound

The unknown is the cross to endure
Still no assessments ensure
Breakdown of chaos prevails
What does tomorrow entail?

Fractured soul
Constitution down
Hope is gone
Allocate the unsound
Constitution down
Allocate the unsound
