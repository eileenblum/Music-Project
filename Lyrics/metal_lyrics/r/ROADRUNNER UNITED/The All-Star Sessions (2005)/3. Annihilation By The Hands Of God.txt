The prophets of God have left you solaced indeed
A zombie of Jesus insane with his belief
Is all that you know and all you take as you go
Youâre one with the rich and only take from the poor

Nailed to the cross by your hands and your feet
Your washed up religion is now worthless and weak
Tenacious conviction has caught up with your soul
Thereâs no place for mercy in the myths of your lord

Little lamb of sacrifice, full of Bible hymns
Hiding in the house of God, from his suffering
Pray the son will come and call just to make us dead
Bring upon the end of timesâ¦worship if you dare

Wiping out masses just for shits and a grin
Is all an illusion of the spell that youâre in
Religious confliction has impaired your control
In his resurrection, revelations unfold

He is you the sacrifice, in the house of bless
Crucify yourself to death just to get to him
Dieâ¦. will youâ¦.

Annihilation by the hands of God
Mutilate meâ¦.
Annihilation by the hands of God
Unforgivingâ¦.
Annihilation by the hands of God
Christ ill willingâ¦.
Annihilation by the hands of God
Heaven hates youâ¦.

When itâs time, I wonât look back
Heavenâs gates under attack

Satanâ¦.
Satanâ¦.
Satanâ¦.
Satanâ¦.

Little lamb of sacrifice, full of Bible hymns
Hiding in the house of God, from his suffering
Pray the son will come and call just to make us dead
Bring upon the end of timesâ¦. worship if you dare

Annihilation by the hands of God
Mutilate meâ¦.
Annihilation by the hands of God
Unforgivingâ¦.
Annihilation by the hands of God
Christ ill willingâ¦.
Annihilation by the hands of God
Heaven hates youâ¦.
