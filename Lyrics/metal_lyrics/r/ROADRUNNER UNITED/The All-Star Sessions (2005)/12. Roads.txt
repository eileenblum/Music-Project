The voice of loss is sighing through the rain
And as I turn around
Nothing is to be found
For hours now upon this endless road
Is it taking me
Where I long to be?

Alone

A soaring hope is reeling in my head
I canât remember this
But it must be what I miss
Suddenly I find Iâm standing still
Staring at the ground
Waiting for your sound

Again
