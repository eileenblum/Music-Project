They came from the sky
And they came from the sea
They came from the inside of a television screen
Babies of bastards
Breeding as one
The fate of Earth is doomed
I quit! Iâm done!

Some kind of darkness come creep over me
On what legal meat does our Caesar do feed?
So we could never be this freeâ¦no!

I donât want to be a superhero
Never really cared about society
I donât want to be a superhero
I donât care so donât call me

They came from the sea
And they came from the sky
Captain America is going to die
Babies of bastards
Breeding for fun
The fate of Earth is doomed
Get your gun, Iâm done

Some kind of darkness come creep over me
On what legal meat does our Caesar do feed?
So we could never be this freeâ¦no!

I donât want to be a superhero
Never really cared about society
I donât want to be a superhero
I believe in a conspiracy

Some kind of darkness come creep over me
On what legal meat does our Caesar do feed?
So we could never be this freeâ¦no!

I donât want to be a superhero
Never really cared about society
I donât want to be a superhero
I donât care so donât call me
