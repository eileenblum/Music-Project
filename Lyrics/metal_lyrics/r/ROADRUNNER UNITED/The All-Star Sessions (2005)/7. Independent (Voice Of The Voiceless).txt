Who are you to put us down?
Who are you to cut us down?
Who are you to point finger?
Who are you to criticize?

We who are with sacrifice
We who are with blood and fire
We who are from the beginning
We who are âtil the end

Independent - Voice of the Voiceless

Who are you to criticize?
Who are youâ¦ make up lies?
Who are you to pass judgement?
Who are youâ¦ destroy life?

We who are the voice
We who are of the voiceless.
We who are to live and die
We who are... we arise

Independent - Voice of the Voiceless

Deus de vida longa aos meus inimigos
Para que possam ver de pe minha vitoria

(God grant my enemies a long life
So they can watch my victory)
