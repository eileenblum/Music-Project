Children carry out your voice, it really matters
Carry on about your fight and who it shattered
The blood is skewn around
And they will kick a man when he's down
Children carry out your voice, it really matters

We are never right
We are forever wrong
And I believe
As I ran inside
We are good enough to be true

Children rise from this with forty words and forty fists
Carry on around their hope before they're broken
If the people live in doubt and scream the way out, the way out, the way out!
Children carry out your voice it's all that matters

We are never right
We are forever wrong
And I believe
As I ran inside
We are good enough to be true

And we don't want to know everything
We wanna know one thing
Only tell us where the blood is
We will clean it up

And we don't want to know everything
We wanna know one thing
Only tell us where the blood is
We will clean it up

We are never right
We are forever wrong
And I believe
As I ran inside
We are good enough to be true

We are never right
We are never wrong
And I believe
As I ran inside
We are good enough to true
