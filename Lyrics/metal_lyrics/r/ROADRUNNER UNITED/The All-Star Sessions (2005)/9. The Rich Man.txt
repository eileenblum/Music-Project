Somehow, I think Iâm going home
Even though my friends canât reach me
I donât know how I ended up alone
All I know is you canât save me
They only asked us to believe
They only wanted us to follow
I think Iâm old enough to see
I think Iâm going home tomorrow

I believe inâ¦
Sinners and hypocrites
Burning in the desert for a rich man
Liars and lunatics
Lead us to the slaughter for our last stand
Killers and idiots
Dying in the desert for a rich man
Sinners and hypocrites
Gather us together for the master plan

I didnât bother with my faith
How will my family recognize it?
Somehow, I think Iâm going home
But I still canât comprehend it
I know I donât want to die
But I know dying will not end it

I believe inâ¦
Sinners and hypocrites
Burning in the desert for a rich man
Liars and lunatics
Lead us to the slaughter for our last stand
Killers and idiots
Dying in the desert for a rich man
Sinners and hypocrites
Gather us together for the bastards

I know the truth is all a lie - my skin is cracking on my lips
I donât pretend that I can understand why we are doing this
My heart has bled a thousand times - how will I live with what weâve done?
The only comfort is the knowledge that Iâm not the only one

Why am I here?
What did I do?
Why?
