Just what in the world has come over you
Is it some kind of game youâre playinâ with me

Fed up, tired and lonely
Gonna run away and hide
Was riding, tryinâ to get to heaven
Was riding down the road feeling bad
Left me standing in the doorway cryinâ
âTil my eyes begin to bleed

Just what in the world has come over you
Shall I hold you close or let you go by
Just what in the hell has come over you
Is it some kind of game youâre playinâ with me

Blind
Tired
Blind

You left your feelings out there hanging
Just donât know what Iâm gonna do
Itâs just a game, itâs the same old story
This kind of love could you ever be true
You left me standing in the doorway cryinâ
Iâd give anything to be with you

Just what in the world has come over you
Shall I hold you close or let you go by
Just what in the hell has come over you
Is it some kind of game youâre playinâ

Just standing in the doorway cryinâ
Gonna run away and hide
Got no place left to turn
Is the love in your heart turning

You left me standing in the doorway cryinâ

Just what in the world has come over you
Shall I hold you close or let you go by
Just what in the hell has come over you
Is it some kind of game youâre playinâ with me

Blind
Tired
Blind
Tired
Blind
Tired
Blind
