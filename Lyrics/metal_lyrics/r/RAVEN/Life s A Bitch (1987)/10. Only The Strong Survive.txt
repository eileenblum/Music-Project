You burned me
You turned me
Led me astray and you tortured my soul
Now there's no way
'Cause you had your say
I'm taking control, you can all go to hell

I'm gonna tell you how I feel
I'm gonna make it real

Only the strong survive
You got to be tough
Got to stand tall
Only the strong survive
And I'll challenge you one and all

You used me
Confused me
Blinded my eyes with a glittering prize
No blindfold
'Cause the lies are old
We're back in the real world and you're gonna learn

You gotta fight until you drop
I'll never stop

Only the strong survive
You got to be tough
Got to stand tall
Only the strong survive
And I'll challenge you one and all

I'm bleeding
I'm needing
Total insanity straight to the top
I'm not dreaming
My mind is reeling
You know that I'm gonna fight 'til I drop

Only the strong survive
You got to be tough
Got to stand tall
Only the strong survive
And I'll challenge you one and all

Only the strong survive
You got to be tough
Got to stand tall
Only the strong survive
And I'll challenge you one and all
