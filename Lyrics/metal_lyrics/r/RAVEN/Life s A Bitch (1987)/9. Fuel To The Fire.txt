Running and running around
Seems like my feet never touch the ground
Over and over and then
We got our backs to the wall again
What you see is what you get
Maybe you can survive
But the long and the tall and the short of it
Is keeping the drive alive

Come on - It's all or nothing
Come on - You know what to do
Fuel to the fire
And the fire's burning you

Come on and turn up the noise
I like the speed and I like the toys
Reaching for more and more
Breaking your face, break down the door
You can bitch and you can scream
Working the nine-to-five
The only way that I can change my life
Is keeping the drive alive

Come on - It's all or nothing
Come on - You know what to do
Fuel to the fire
And the fire's burning you

Running to the future
Got to keep a-moving, blaze the trail
Find that holy grail
You can bitch and you can scream
Working the nine-to-five
The only way that I can change my life
Is keeping the drive alive

Come on - It's all or nothing
Come on - You know what to do
Fuel to the fire
And the fire's burning you
Come on - It's all or nothing
Come on - You know what to do
Fuel to the fire
And the fire's burning you
