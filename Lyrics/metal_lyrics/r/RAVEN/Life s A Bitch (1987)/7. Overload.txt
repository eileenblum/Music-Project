Think we reached the limit
Turned and locked the door
You don't really know the score
Listen to the thunder
The electric Roar
Look what we have got in store

One way ticket
Going off the edge
Under pressure, Under fire
It will never end
There's only one why to satisfy yourself
Make everything louder then everything else

We're heading for the overload
We're heading for the overload
Maximum intensity is what it really means to me
Heading for the overload

In the line of fire
Decibel attack
There can be no turning back
Mission of destruction
Shockwave in the air
Dealing out the airway stare

One way ticket
Going off the edge
Under pressure, Under fire
It will never end
There's only one why to satisfy yourself
Make everything louder then everything else

We're heading for the overload
We're heading for the overload
Maximum intensity is what it really means to me
Heading for the overload

You know that it's essential
To make the strike
The ultimate potential
Will be unleashed - look into the light

One way ticket
Going off the edge
Under pressure, Under fire
It will never end
There's only one why to satisfy yourself
Make everything louder then everything else

We're heading for the overload
We're heading for the overload
Maximum intensity is what it really means to me
Heading for the overload
