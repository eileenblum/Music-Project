Hiding in the shadows
Crawling underground
Weighing up their chances
Making not a sound
No one would go down there
No one but a fool
Would disregard the warnings
And disregard the rules

No one can control
They don't understand
This violence lives inside
The heart of every

Hunter - Right behind you
Seeker - No escape
Killer - Savage and the hungry
Hunter - No Survivors
Seeker - No escape
Killer - Savage and the hungry

Like a human wolfpack
They hunt until they drop
You won't last the distance
They will never stop

No one can control
They don't understand
This violence lives inside
The heart of every

Hunter - Right behind you
Seeker - No escape
Killer - Savage and the hungry
Hunter - No Survivors
Seeker - No escape
Killer - Savage and the hungry

Scratching at my flesh
I feel my muscles start to mesh
Got to get away
And make it to the light of day

Hunter - Right behind you
Seeker - No escape
Killer - Savage and the hungry
Hunter - No Survivors
Seeker - No escape
Killer - Savage and the hungry
[Some mental ad-liberties and that's ya whack, kidda!]
