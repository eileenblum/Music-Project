In my manor start no fight
Take no chance with me
Watch your mouth heading south
A flying lesson for free

You sold me out
And they put me away
But now I'm back
I promise, you're gonna pay

Pick your window, you're leaving
Pick your window, you're leaving
You're leaving right now

Jelly Knight and Eddie Huggins see
They all say you put the finger on me
Bring out your bottles, your knives and your chains
I've got a .22, I'm gonna blow out your brains

You sold me out
And they put me away
But now I'm back
I promise, you're gonna pay

Pick your window, you're leaving
Pick your window, you're leaving
You're leaving right now

Pick your window, you're leaving
Pick your window, you're leaving
You're leaving right now

[solo]

Pick your window, you're leaving
Pick your window, you're leaving
You're leaving right now

For you I got some concrete shoes
I got them made to measure
To make you walk the plank tonight
Well, that would be my pleasure

You sold me out
And they put me away
But now I'm back
I promise, you're gonna pay

Pick your window, you're leaving
Pick your window, you're leaving
You're leaving right now

Pick your window, you're leaving
Pick your window, you're leaving
You're leaving right now
