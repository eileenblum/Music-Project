Pressure building up inside my head
Get the strangest looks, what have I said
Got to snap out but I just can't start
Feel as if I'm gonna fall apart

Get a grip on the line
Keep your balance, see the danger sign
Gonna run out of time

Playing with the razor
Running for your life

Every step is leading me astray
Wish that I could see the light of day
Fact or fiction, I just cannot tell
This twisted tightrope taking me to hell

Get a grip on the line
Keep your balance, see the danger sign
Gonna run out of time

Playing with the razor
Running for your life
Burning with the fever
That cuts me like a knife

Get a grip on the line
Keep your balance, see the danger sign
Gonna run out of time

Playing with the razor
Running for your life
Burning with the fever
That cuts me like a knife
