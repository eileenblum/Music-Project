You said it's time to get together
Stop the fight
You're always saying that two wrongs
Don't make a right

But as you're throwing down the sword
You pick the knife up
And you stab me in the back

You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar

I never did believe
A single word you say
Your kind of promises
Won't see the light of day

But as you're promising the earth
You turn around and then
You take it all away

You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
You made the summit
But you'll never reach the top

You'll never fool us
With your crazy power play
You think you're making progress
Who cares what you say
If I don't stop, I know
You'll blow us all away

You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
You're a liar
