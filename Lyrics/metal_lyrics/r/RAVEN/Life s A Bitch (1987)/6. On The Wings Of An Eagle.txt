Bandits sighted, fear ignited
Searchlights are cutting the night
Fighters rising to the challenge
Enemy to the left and the right

Never have so many owed
So much to so few
Reach for the sky, it's do or die
Our future's depending on you

On the wings of an eagle
Heading straight for my goal
Gonna fight till the finish
With my heart and my soul

12 O'clock high, burning the sky
Danger comes out of the sun
Guns are screaming, hit full throttle
Eye for an eye, the damage is done

Never have so many owed
So much to so few
Reach for the sky, it's do or die
Our future's depending on you

On the wings of an eagle
Heading straight for my goal
Gonna fight till the finish
With my heart and my soul

City burning, table turning
Attacking source of the hate
Firepower, overlord
Gold, juno and sword

Never have so many owed
So much to so few
Reach for the sky, it's do or die
Our future's depending on you

On the wings of an eagle
Heading straight for my goal
Gonna fight till the finish
With my heart and my soul

On the wings of an eagle
Heading straight for my goal
Gonna fight till the finish
With my heart and my soul
