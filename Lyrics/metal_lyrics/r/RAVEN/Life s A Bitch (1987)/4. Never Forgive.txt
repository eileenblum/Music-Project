Trouble all around us every day
People gunning for us say we're in their way
They wanna try and stop us, bring us down
We got to pull together, each and every town
Listen, what I'm saying - you can take a hike
If you want to welcome in a new Third Reich

All those years
Don't the memories send a chill down your spine
Arguments, battle plans
You got yours - here's mine

Raise your hands - into battle
Raise your hands - into war
Raise your hands - the scene
Never forgive, never forget

Preachers, congress - censoring
Sell our freedom, it's a living sin

All those years
Don't the memories send a chill down your spine
Arguments, battle plans
You got yours - here's mine

Raise your hands - into battle
Raise your hands - into war
Raise your hands - the scene
Never forgive, never forget

All those years
Don't the memories send a chill down your spine
Arguments, battle plans
You got yours - here's mine

Raise your hands - into battle
Raise your hands - into war
Raise your hands - the scene
Never forgive, never forget
Raise your hands - into battle
Raise your hands - into war
Raise your hands - the scene
Never forgive, never forget
