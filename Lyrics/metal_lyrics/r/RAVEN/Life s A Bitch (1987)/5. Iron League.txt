It makes no difference who you are
You're gonna feel the same
When the power's at its height
Feel the energy - inside of your veins

You gotta have the will to win
There ain't no way we're giving in
You got to take it up to the extreme

Welcome to the iron league
We will never rest
The iron league, the iron league
Take the muscle, put it to the test

We got the electricity
Right before your eyes
This ain't no game we're playing
Take the challenge - cut it down to size

We're in our element at last
Our colors nailed upon the mast
We're gonna take it up to the extreme

Welcome to the iron league
We will never rest
The iron league, the iron league
Take the muscle, put it to the test

There's no rules, no limit
A battle zone and we're in it
Got the urge to go over the top

Welcome to the iron league
We will never rest
The iron league, the iron league
Take the muscle, put it to the ...

Welcome to the iron league
We will never rest
The iron league, the iron league
Take the muscle, put it to the test
