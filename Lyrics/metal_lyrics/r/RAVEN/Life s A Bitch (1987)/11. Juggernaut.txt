Sixty years of hate
Breaking down the gate
The object is to dominate
With subterfuge and lies
And absolute disguise
Will no one wake
Can no one see the writing on the wall

Relentless
In excess
Nothing lives and none can stand in its way
Crash course
Full force
Crushed before the might juggernaut

We got to stand and fight
This creature forged in fear
We got to make the message clear
With omnipresent eyes
The beast prepares to rise
Biding its time
Waiting until the moment comes to kill

Relentless
In excess
Nothing lives and none can stand in it's way
Crash course
Full force
Crushed before the might juggernaut

Stand and fight
This creature forged in fear
We got to make the message clear

Relentless
In excess
Nothing lives and none can stand in it's way
Crash course
Full force
Crushed before the might juggernaut

Relentless
In excess
Nothing lives and none can stand in it's way
Crash course
Full force
Crushed before the might juggernaut
