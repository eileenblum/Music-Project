You want satisfaction
You want to make a deal
Waste your life living in a world
That's totally unreal

You, you can run but you can't hide
You, you can't run and hide
Run and hide

Now you're on the street
Taking it day by day
Using every angle
But no-one believes a word you say

You, you can run but you can't hide
You, you can't run and hide

Catch yourself falling
Deep in the crack
Hunger is calling
Twisting the knife
In your back
You, you can run but you can't hide
You, you can't run and hide
Run and hide
Run and hide
Run and hide
