Can you hear me, can you see me
Cos I'm screaming as loud as I can
Something coming in the distance
Getting nearer it's all part of the plan
People over here, people over there
Everybody's calling but you don't stop there
Coming from the front, coming from behind
Coming pretty soon you'll be out in your mind

Lost inside your four walls
Trapped in your disguise
When will you open up your mind and realise
When your world comes tumbling down
You won't even be around
When your world comes tumbling down
When your world comes tumbling down
You won't even here a sound
When your world comes tumbling down

Feel the power, feel the fury
Eyes are blind but now they see
Nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide
Better wake up it's the end of the ride

Lost inside your four walls
Trapped in your disguise
When will you open up your rise and realise
When your world comes tumbling down
You win gonna be around
When your world comes tumbling down
When your world comes tumbling down
You win gonna here a sound
When your world comes tumbling down

Wake up, listen to you need

Lost inside your four walls
Trapped in your disguise
When will you open up your mind and realise
Open up your eyes
When your world comes tumbling down
You win gonna be around
When your world comes tumbling down
When your world comes tumbling down
You win gonna here a sound
When your world comes tumbling down
