Red hot fever running through my veins
Losing contact paralysing pain
Try but you can never hold me back
Right behind you on your track

Don't care how long it takes
Don't care what they say
Even though you bring me to my knees
Nothing comes easy price you got to pay
Got to take it all the way

Still Hungry, Still Hungry
Still Hungry for you
Still Hungry
Devoured but I'm Still Hungry
Still Hungry, Still Hungry
Still Hungry for you

Crawling closer almost within sight
Turn but you are gone into the night
One step forward always two steps back
But I'm never going to stop my attack

Don't care how you torment me
So close yet so far
Always leave me stranded in the dark
Nothing comes easy price you got to pay
Got to take it all the way

Still Hungry, Still Hungry
Still Hungry for you

I'm tormented can't you see
Bonded inextricable to you

Still Hungry
Still Hungry for you
Still Hungry, Still Hungry
Still Hungry for you
Still Hungry
Devoured but I'm Still Hungry
Still Hungry
Still Hungry for you
