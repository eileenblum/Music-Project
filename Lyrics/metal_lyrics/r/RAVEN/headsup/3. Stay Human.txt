Living in amongst us
No-one listened, no-one realised
No-one saw the fury in those eyes

No lights no life just an unending fight
To stay human, stay human

Living in a nightmare
These four walls are bursting with despair
Unknowing of the world out there

Half blind with fear count the cost it's so dear
To stay human, stay human
No way out
No match no life just an unending fight
To stay human, stay human

A family held prisoner
Man who lead them lost within his mind
Strangled by the ties that bind
Man who lead them lost within his mind
