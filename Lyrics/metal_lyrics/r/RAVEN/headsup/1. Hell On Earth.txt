Stranger inside my head
Discord in my mind
Storm-clouds growing closer
Vultures gonna rob me blind

No way out
Just look around there's nowhere left to turn
Face the facts
You know I'm in too deep and I'm getting burned

Hell on Earth, Hell on Earth
No escape there's nothing I can do
Hell on Earth
And there's nothing I can do
And it's all because of you

No trust you know I ain't gonna listen
Cut your losses and get away
Maybe later I know I can make it
Tomorrow's gone I'm living for today

No way out
You see the mirror start to crack
No more choice
Can't you see I've got a monkey riding on my back?

Hell on Earth, Hell on Earth
No escape there's nothing I can do
Hell on Earth
And there's nothing I can do
And it's all because of you

Falling to pieces and I just can't stop
Can't you see I'm bleeding?

No way out
Just look around there's nowhere left to turn
Face the facts
You know I'm in too deep and I'm getting burned

Hell on Earth, Hell on Earth
There's no escape there's nothing I can do
Hell on Earth
And there's nothing I can do
And it's all because of you
Hell on Earth, Hell on Earth
There's no escape there's nothing I can do
Hell on Earth
And there's nothing I can do
And it's all because of you
