Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I want it
You've got it
The thrill of the kill

Primetime
Nightline
Got to get my fill

I wish somebody could help me
Trapped inside this dream
I wish somebody would listen
Got to hear me scream

Cause I've seen it on the TV
But no one would believe me
And I heard it on the radio
On the radio

I'm not changing
The channel
I don't know the score

I can't tell
What is
The real world then and more

What will it take tomorrow
While you're sitting there
I wish somebody would listen
The don't really care

Cause I've seen it on the TV
But no one would believe me
And I heard it on the radio
On the radio

What will they tell you tomorrow
To keep you hypnotized
I wish somebody would listen
Cause all they tell is lies
Lies
Lies

Cause I've seen it on the TV
But no one would believe me
And I heard it on the radio
On the radio

Cause I've seen it on the TV
But no one would believe me
Cause I've seen it on the TV
But no one would believe me
Cause I've seen it on the TV
But no one would believe me
Cause I've seen it on the TV
