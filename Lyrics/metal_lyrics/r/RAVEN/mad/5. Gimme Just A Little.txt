I got heart
I got soul
I got the guts to reach my goal

I got a fever
But it's all right
'Cause it's the fever that keeps me alive

I got rhythm
I got rock
Now it's a race to beat the clock

I got a fever
But it's all right
'Cause it's the fever that keeps me alive

When I'm hungry and I'm hot
Well no thanks this is what I've got

So fuckin' don't ya want
Don't ya

Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little of what I got coming
Give ya just a little more time
Hangin' on the edge of the line
Sick and tired of runnin' around

I got style
I got class
I got an attitude
I like broken glass

I got a fever
But it's all right
'Cause it's the fever that keeps me alive

I want money
I want love
And all the dreams I'm dreamin' of

I got a fever
But it's all right
'Cause it's the fever that keeps me alive

I want gloves
I want power
C'mon lock and strike me out

So fuckin' don't ya want
Don't ya

Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little of what I got coming
Give ya just a little more time
Hangin' on the edge of the line
Sick and tired of runnin' around

When we signed on the line
You got yours
But I didn't get mine

I got a fever
But it's all right
'Cause it's the fever that keeps me alive

Are you real
Are you fake
'Cause it's time to make or break

I got a fever
But it's all right
'Cause it's the fever that keeps me alive

I won't ask for much
Just a little of a Midas touch

So fuckin' don't ya want
Don't ya

Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little
Gimmie just a little of what I got coming
Give ya just a little more time
Hangin' on the edge of the line
Sick and tired of runnin' around
