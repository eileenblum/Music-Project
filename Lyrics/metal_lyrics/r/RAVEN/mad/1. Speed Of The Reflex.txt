You think you've got it down
You think you're really tough
But when the bell rings out
Are you tough enough?

Keep your guard up high
Time to do or die
Never ever stop
Gonna make it

Stick to your guns
You've got a ticket tonight

Speed of the reflex
Laying down the law
Speed of the reflex
Breaking down your door

You think you'll make them quick
You think you will succeed
You'd better watch your mouth
I'm gonna make you bleed

When they strike back
They're gonna give you hell
You feel my pride
Cut right through you

Make no mistake
I am the king of the ring

Speed of the reflex
Laying down the law
Speed of the reflex

Give me a stage
That is built from rage
'Cause I am the king of the ring
And I won't go down
For no one
No one, no one, no one

I'm thunder, I'm lightning
I'm coming your way
And you've got a price on your head

Muscle and might
You're in for one hell of a fight

Keep your guard up high
Time to do or die
Never ever stop
Gonna make it

I've got this thing
I am the king of the ring

Speed of the reflex
Laying down the law
Speed of the reflex
Breaking down your door

Speed of the reflex
Laying down the law
Speed of the reflex
