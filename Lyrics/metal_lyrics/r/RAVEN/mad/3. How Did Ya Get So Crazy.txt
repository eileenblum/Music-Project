You like it hard you liked fast
And we all have the power to make this last

But tonight when the lights go down
They won't know what's in store
And just when you thought you'd seen it all
We'll come right back with more

How did ya get so crazy
Because of rock 'n' roll
How did ya get so crazy
Because of rock 'n' roll

Don't stop flagging when you think you've had enough
My body's just big got to get real tough

But tonight when the curtain rises
They we'll take on you
And just when you thought you've had enough
We're gonna prove you wrong

How did ya get so crazy
Because of rock 'n' roll
How did ya get so crazy
Because of rock 'n' roll

Tonight when the lights go down
The won't know what's in store
And just when you thought you'd have seen it all
We'll come right back with more
We'll come right back with more

How did ya get so crazy
Because of rock 'n' roll
How did ya get so crazy
Because of rock 'n' roll
