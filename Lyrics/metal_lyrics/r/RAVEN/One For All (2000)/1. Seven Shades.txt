Living in the past
It seems the futureâs here so fast
It almost seems like yesterday
When I could see you follow
Wipeout in the ocean
Then the goddess blessed the ground you walked on
Trust in you has gone
Iâll build a dream machine so fast and clean
Play the game youâll see what I mean

Crazy, lazy and thereâs nothing I can do
But soon I will be kicking
Seven shades right outta you
You think Iâm mental, incidental
And you say my time is through
But Iâll be kicking seven shades outta you

Black and blue and red all over
While you been living in clover
Acting kinda dumb living so high and mighty
Living in the dirt I tell you
My attitude could buy and sell you
Trust in you has gone
Iâll build a dream machine so fast and clean
Rip you into shreds 
like nothing you have ever seen

Crazy, lazy and thereâs nothing I can do
But soon I will be kicking
Seven shades right outta you
You think Iâm mental, incidental
And you say my time is through
But Iâll be kicking seven shades outta you
