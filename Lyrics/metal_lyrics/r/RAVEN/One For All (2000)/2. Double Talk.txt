Nice to see you, I canât stand you
But we got big plans for you and thereâs more
Weâre excited, more like bored stiff
I canât wait till youâre ready
to walk out the door

Play the game itâs all the same
Buy you and sell you
You gotta play ball
I hear your words but I know what you say
So listen to me cos I know

Doubletalk â All I get from you
Double meaning but I can see
Double talk â take a walk
Or itâs double trouble from me

Super project I got no respect
A dime a dozen youâre our number one
On the guest list no way Iâll miss
Out come the knives 
just as soon as youâre gone

Such a big shot thanks to daddy
Even rehab canât unchain your brain
Such a charmed life just donât cross me
Just keep your nose out
and you stay in your lane

Doubletalk â All I get from you
Double meaning but I can see
Double talk â take a walk
Or itâs double trouble from me
