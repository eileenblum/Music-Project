Theyâll build you up to knock you down
Theyâll do their best to try and run you out of town
Donât you show it donât mean nothing
You know that you can make it through

You think Iâm crazy 
But itâs you thatâs gonna learn
You see me crash
But man itâs you thatâs gonna burn

You gotta roll with the punches
You gotta get to whatâs real
You gotta take what theyâre giving
to get what you want
If you have to beg borrow or steal
You gotta roll with the punches
Youâd better do what you can
You gotta roll with the punches
and pull yourself up
and fight just like a man

Just set your sights way upon high
Feet on the ground
while youâre reaching for the sky
Keep on pushing to the front line
You know that you can make it through

You think Iâm crazy 
but thereâs something you donât know
Give as good as I get
It donât matter if youâre friend or foe

You gotta roll with the punches
You gotta get to whatâs real
You gotta take what theyâre giving
to get what you want
If you have to beg borrow or steal
You gotta roll with the punches
Youâd better do what you can
You gotta roll with the punches
and pull yourself up
and fight just like a man

You think Iâm crazy 
But itâs you thatâs gonna learn
You see me crash
But man itâs you thatâs gonna burn

You gotta roll with the punches
You gotta get to whatâs real
You gotta take what theyâre giving
to get what you want
If you have to beg borrow or steal
You gotta roll with the punches
Youâd better do what you can
You gotta roll with the punches
and pull yourself up
and fight just like a man
