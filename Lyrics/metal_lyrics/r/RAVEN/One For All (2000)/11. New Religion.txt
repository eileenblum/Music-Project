Take a moment, look around
Tell me what you see
No colour, black and white
Anger and misery

Standing on the edge of a nightmare
Thereâs no future there is just today

Thereâs a new religion
Youâd better save yourself
A new religion
A new religion

You can slash and burn
But the worm will turn
Everything you want more
The wolf is at your door

Standing on the edge of disaster
Thereâs no future
There is just today

Thereâs a new religion
Youâd better save yourself
A new religion
A new religion
A new religion
A new religion

Standing on the edge of a nightmare
Thereâs no future there is just today
On the inside getting nowhere
Timebomb it will explode

Thereâs a new religion
Youâd better save yourself
A new religion
A new religion
A new religion
A new religion
