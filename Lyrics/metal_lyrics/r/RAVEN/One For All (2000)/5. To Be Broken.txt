Take the book in your right hand
Wonât you swear on your life
The words you utter are vicious
Yeah they cut like a knife

False honour false glory
False witness twisted story
Blinded with both eyes open
You think the rules are yours 
To be broken â to be broken

Innocent until proven
Yes youâre guilty as sin
Record as long as your arm
They donât know where to begin

False honour false glory
False witness twisted story
Blinded with both eyes open
You think the rules are yours 
To be broken â to be broken
