Lost in this nightmare
No way out of this charade
Just one direction
If weâre ever to be saved
Future is fading 
Overwhelmed with emptiness

When youâre driven to the breakpoint
and thereâs nowhere else to go
Keep your balance
and donât look below
Just keep pushing past the limit
Leave the agony behind
The battles in your mind

Itâs the hunger inside
inside of your eyes
Burns you alive
As you reach for the prize
Itâs the fever deep within
Possessing your soul

Cast out in darkness
Sell your soul
Just to stay warm
Cry out for freedom just hold on
through the storm
Body is screaming
But the torture never stops

When youâre broken
Down and busted
And the whip is at your back
It takes everything youâve got
To pick yourself up and get back
on the track
With inhuman concentration
Drag yourself up to the top
To survive you know
You cannot stop

Itâs the hunger inside
inside of your eyes
Burns you alive
As you reach for the prize
Itâs the fever deep within
Possessing your soul
Burns you alive
As you reach for your goal

Itâs the hunger inside
inside of your eyes
Burns you alive
As you reach for the prize

Itâs the hunger inside
that eats you alive
