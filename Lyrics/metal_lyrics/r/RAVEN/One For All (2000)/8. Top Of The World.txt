Muscle in the backroom
Power on the street
Your tentacles lie everywhere
And no one beats the heat
Inherited the playground
Untouchable to all
Youâre climbing oh so very high
But itâs a long long way to fall

Lord of your domain
Holder of the key
Think that youâre invisible
but itâs so plain to see

On top of the world
But youâll never hear a sound
On top of the world
But youâre going down down down
Youâre going down

Shakedown at the market
Skimming off the cream
Not an eye can testify
To what itâs never seen

Master of chaos
Answering to none
Think youâve finally arrived
But soon you will be gone

On top of the world
But youâll never hear a sound
On top of the world
But youâre going down down down

Master of chaos
Answering to none
Think youâve finally arrived
But soon you will be gone

On top of the world
But youâll never hear a sound
On top of the world
But youâre going down down down

On top of the world
But youâll never hear a sound
On top of the world
But youâre going down down down
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down
