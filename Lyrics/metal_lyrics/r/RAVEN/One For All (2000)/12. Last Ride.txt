The gates are open and Iâm on the street
Yeah Iâm ready to fly
10 years burns you up inside
When itâs caused by someone elseâs lie

Set the snare and bait the hook
The hunter lies in wait

Itâs the lasting impression
that I see upon your face
Whereâs the glowing reception
Arenât you ready for the race

Itâs the last ride
Iâm gonna take you on the last ride

So much we got to talk about
Itâs been so very long
You locked the door
and broke the key
Destroyed the man that once was me

Iâve got so much to show you
So very much to give

Itâs the total deception 
that put me into that place
Too late for redemption 
Arenât you ready for the race

Itâs the last ride 
Iâm gonna take you for the last ride
Into your nightmare
Come on Iâm gonna take you down

Iâve got so much to show you
So very much to give

Itâs the lasting impression
that I see upon your face
Whereâs the glowing reception
Arenât you ready for the race

Itâs the last ride
Iâm gonna take you on the last ride
Iâm gonna take you for the last ride
Iâm gonna take you for the last ride
