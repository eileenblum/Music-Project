Donât need distractions Iâve had my fill
Give me the gasoline powered
Thrill of the kill
Smell of burning rubber burning up the track
Fighting for position 
Adrenalin attack

No better feeling burning in your soul
Borderline insanity right out of control
Pushing to the limit of machine and man
Gonna give it everything â
Everything I can

Get that motor running 
Foot down to the floor
Push it even harder
Til you can do no more
Just get me on that road
Screaming round the bend
Get that motor running again

Got pole position Iâm on the ball
Ultimate velocity 
You know Iâm standing tall

Holding on for dear life
Up against the wall
Gonna take no prisoners 
Hear my battle call

Get that motor running 
Foot down to the floor
Push it even harder
Til you can do no more
Just get me on that road
Screaming round the bend
Get that motor running again
