Dogs of war I hear your call
Across the lines where heroes fall
Thereâll be no end thereâll be no sign
Fighting âtil the end of time
All Iâve ever wanted
Iâd trade to stay alive
I know the clock is ticking
Just how long can I survive

In the line of fire
Got a ringside seat to judgement day
In the line of fire
Headlong into darkness
Headlong into hell

Dogs of war no guarantee
of life or death just misery
Fight for honour fight for law
Fighting to sustain the war

All Iâve ever wanted
Means nothing in this place
Cast away this madness
and disappear without a trace

In the line of fire
Got a ringside seat to judgement day
In the line of fire
Headlong into hell

Fight for honour fight for right
Fight to turn away the night
No retreat just reap the whirlwind 
Dogs of war I hear your call
Across the lines where heroes fall
Thereâll be no end thereâll be no sign
Fighting âtil the end of time
All Iâve ever wanted
Iâd trade to stay alive
I know the clock is ticking
Just how long can I survive

In the line of fire
Got a ringside seat to judgement day
In the line of fire
Headlong into hell
In the line of fire
Got a ringside seat to judgement day
In the line of fire
