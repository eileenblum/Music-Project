Think that youâre the chosen ones
Heavier than thou
said that youâll re-write the book 
But youâre illiterate so how
Donât want to hear your attitude
Donât need to hear your bitch

I wanna see whoâs gonna follow
Here today and gone tomorrow

I donât wanna I donât wanna
I ainât gonna be your kangaroo
I ainât gonna I ainât gonna
You ainât gonna put me in your zoo
I donât wanna I donât wanna
I ainât gonna be your kangaroo

Empty vessels make the greatest noise
And boy youâre deafening
Lowest common denominator
Take the money and see you later
Go jump on the bandwagon
Youâre headed for a fall

I wanna see whoâs gonna swallow
You ainât gonna see me follow

I donât wanna I donât wanna
I ainât gonna be your kangaroo
I ainât gonna I ainât gonna
You ainât gonna put me in your zoo

I ainât playing by your rules
Find yourself another fool
And when your ship goes down
No-one will recall a sound
And youâll be running outta town

Cornholed and potholed
with nowhere to hide
When theyâll look back at you
Theyâll just think your brains were fried
Jump upon the gravy train 
before it leaves this town
Your 15 minutes almost up time
You were going down

I wanna see whoâs gonna follow
Tattooed now and gone tomorrow

I donât wanna I donât wanna
I ainât gonna be your kangaroo
I ainât gonna I ainât gonna
You ainât gonna put me in your zoo
I donât wanna I donât wanna
I ainât gonna be your kangaroo
I donât wanna I donât wanna
I ainât gonna be your kangaroo
