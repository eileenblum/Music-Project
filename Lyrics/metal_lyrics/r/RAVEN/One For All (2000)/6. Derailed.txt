Looking for trouble
When you knocked upon my door
I knew the ground rules
But I didnât know the score

All seemed too good to be true
Too late I realized

You derailed my one track mind
Donât think I wanna come and see you sometime
Derailed me just in time
You scared the hell outta me

Taking control
You had me revved up fit to break
I should have known 
that you had much more than it takes

We made the play by play
Your bonus point got in the way

You derailed my one track mind
Donât think I wanna come and see you sometime
Derailed me just in time

Thereâs no deceiving what youâre revealing
Made all the right moves
Made all the wrong turns
Turnd up the heat and
got my fingers burned

Taking control
You had me revved up fit to break
I should have known 
that you had much more than it takes

I got myself up off the floor
I got the hell right out the door
I hit the street in seconds flat
There ainât no way, no way
No turning back

You derailed my one track mind
Donât think I wanna come and see you sometime
Derailed me just in time
You scared the hell outta me

You derailed my one track mind
Donât think I wanna come and see you sometime
Derailed me just in time
You scared the hell outta me
