You've got me coming and going
You floor me without a sound
I try to roll with your punches
But you keep laying them down

Giving me a hard time
Making me lose my mind
You're giving me a rough ride
You've got me going
You're driving me wild

I've got my hands on your assets
It brings the tears to your eyes
You wanna check my credentials
You're gonna get a surprise

Giving me a hard time
Making me lose my mind
You're giving me a rough ride
You've got me going
You're driving me wild

You've got me coming and going
You floor me without a sound
I try to roll with your punches
But you keep laying them down

Giving me a hard time
Making me lose my mind
You're giving me a rough ride
You've got me going
You're driving me wild
