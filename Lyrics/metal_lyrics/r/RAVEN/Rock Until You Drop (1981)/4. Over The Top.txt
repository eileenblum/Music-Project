Time to get up and it's time to get down
Pick myself up and no messing around
Tell all the boys that it's time to move out
We're on our way and we ain't got no doubt

Yeah - we're going over the top
Yeah - we're going over the top

I'm going dizzy my head's in a spin
I'd like to stop but where would I begin
We're going crazy the place is alight
Looking for action you'll get it tonight

Yeah - we're going over the top
Yeah - we're going over the top

Time to get up and it's time to get down
Pick myself up and no messing around
Tell all the boys that it's time to move out
We're on our way and we ain't got no doubt

Yeah - we're going over the top
Yeah - we're going over the top
