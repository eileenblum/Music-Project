Running - blinded in the night
Gotta pick my feet up off the ground
Keep out of sight and make no sound
I tried to tell them no right from the start
I'm a runaway a raging fury
A burning stallion with thunder in his heart

You can burn my body
You can tear my soul
Bend me with your torment
But still the answer's
no no no no no no no!
You won't get me on the hell patrol

Shadow maker - help me out
Got to find a place to hide tonight
A place that they won't know about
The hell patrol won't stop until they've won
You can run away a million times
Yet still the hidings just begun

You can burn my body
You can tear my soul
Bend me with your torment
But still the answer's
no no no no no no no!
You won't get me on the hell patrol

Running - blinded in the night
Gotta pick my feet up off the ground
Keep out of sight and make no sound
I tried to tell them no right from the start
I'm a runaway a raging fury
A burning stallion with thunder in his heart

You can burn my body
You can tear my soul
Bend me with your torment
But still the answer's
no no no no no no no!
You won't get me on the hell patrol
