Marching - to the front we are
Fighting - for the right to be
Living - in a place that we call our own

Fight we will fight
And they will run
Through the snow and
The raging sun
Steel will clash
Their blood will run
For the future

Dying - for the women and the
Children - Oh the forge a generation
And to carry on the quest 'till the day they can rest

Fight we will fight
And they will run
Through the snow and
The raging sun
Steel will clash
Their blood will run
For the future

Darkness - will descend on the mountain
You will attack from the West side
I will attack from the rear
