I've been to hell but I came through
And now they say I'm not good for you
Your Mammy says I'm a technical hitch
And your Daddy says I'm a son of a bitch
Life ain't the same for a man of war
Don't even know what I was fightin' for
They say kill I say why - no mercy too late to cry

So many memories too much pain
Same old nightmares again and again
Guns to the left of me guns to the right
Nobody's hero
Nobody's hero
Nobody's hero
Only the strong survive
You've got to come and get me if you want me alive

Looks like I'm left on the shelf
I'm just a prisoner within myself
Try so hard but can't break free
Everybody's giving me the third degree
Brand me a killer brand me a liar
My head is spinning but my hearts on fire
Name, rank and number my lips are sealed
I'll keep my shooting for the battlefield

So many memories too much pain
Same old nightmares again and again
Guns to the left of me guns to the right
Nobody's hero
Nobody's hero
Nobody's hero
Only the strong survive
You've got to come and get me if you want me alive

No where to run no where to go
No where to hide when the lights are low
No one to feel no one to touch
No wonder I'm feeling tired so much

So many memories too much pain
Same old nightmares again and again
Guns to the left of me guns to the right
Nobody's hero
Nobody's hero
Nobody's hero
Only the strong survive
You've got to come and get me if you want me alive
