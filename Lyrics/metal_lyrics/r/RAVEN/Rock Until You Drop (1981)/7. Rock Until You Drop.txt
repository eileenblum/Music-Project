Don't think you can make it
Don't think you want to try
Sit back in your easy chair
And the world will pass you by
Life is what you make it
That's what people say
You've got to get it together
Make it your own way

You've gotta rock
Rock until you drop

Got to get some action
Got to rock tonight
Got to get the volume
To slay you with its might
Get into metal
That's what it's about
Come on everybody - Now lets hear you shout

You've gotta rock
Rock until you drop

So you think you're sitting pretty
But your life is passing by
Make no sign of living
It don't matter if you die
You've got to think of something
Give it all you've got
Make your life worth something
Or it'll cost the lot

You've gotta rock
Rock until you drop
