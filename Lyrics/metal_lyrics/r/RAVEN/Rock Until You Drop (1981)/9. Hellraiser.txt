Look out!
Mama let me out on a Saturday night, she said
'Now go out and get her, go and hold her tight', I said
'Now Mama you don't understand
Every time I touch her hand
It's like I'm burnin' in the fires of hell
And if I hold her too long, you never can tell
What'll happen to me, wouldn't want you to see'

Look out!
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look out!

She's like a live bomb shell, like a flash out of hell
And when she's shaking her - ooh - well, everyone fell at her feet
And that's neat and she took me completely
By surprise with her ultra sonic eyes
That were flashing like hysterical danger signs
That said beware where you tread or you'll go out of your head

Look out!
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look out!
