Don't want no one night stand
I don't need no helping hand
You ain't comin' round to drink my booze
You won't get the money you lent
You know the stuff that pays my rent
Just stick around cos' you're gonna lose

Just leave don't look behind you
I don't need your money honey
Just spend it on a loser
I don't need your money honey
Get off my back
Get off my track
And I'll tell you if you want facts
I don't want no rich fat daddy trying to change my life
when I just wanna relax

I don't want your Barclay card
You know you make my life so hard
You think you got me feeding out of your hand
Go take a ride in your Lotus Elite
I'll stick to walking on my two feet
I've got to prove to you that I'm more than a man

Just leave don't look behind you
I don't need your money honey
Just spend it on a loser
I don't need your money honey
Get off my back
Get off my track
And I'll tell you if you want facts
I don't want no rich fat daddy trying to change my life
when I just wanna relax

Just leave don't look behind you
I don't need your money honey
Just spend it on a loser
I don't need your money honey
Get off my back
Get off my track
And I'll tell you if you want facts
I don't want no rich fat daddy trying to change my life
when I just wanna relax
