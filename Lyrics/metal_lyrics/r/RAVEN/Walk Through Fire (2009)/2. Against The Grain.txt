Like a fish out of water
Just a man on the run
Under starter's orders
Long before you hear the gun

You think you're in with the in crowd (in with the in crowd)
but you're out in the cold
today you're giving the orders (giving the orders)
tomorrow you'll be bought &amp; sold

Take a good had look tell me what you see
that's the difference between you &amp; me
you've changed but I've stayed the same
you've compromised but I'm forever
against the grain
against the grain

Make the right impression
squeeze into the mould
twisted by obsession
believe all you're told

Just take it all for granted (all for granted)
but it's not what it seems
the power lust that you've planted (lust that you've planted)
will push you to the extreme

Take a good had look tell me what you see
that's the difference between you &amp; me
you've changed but I've stayed the same
you've compromised but I'm forever
against the grain
against the grain

You think you're in with the in crowd (in with the in crowd)
but you're out in the cold
today you're giving the orders (giving the orders)
tomorrow you'll be bought &amp; sold

Take a good had look tell me what you see
that's the difference between you &amp; me
you've changed but I've stayed the same
you've compromised but I'm forever - against the grain
