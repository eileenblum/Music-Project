Made the overture no word of a lie
the only answer that I got was no reply
gonna take a page right out of your book
turn the tables on you &amp; I'll put you on the hook

Hit me for six but I'm coming back around
like a bulldozer I'm gonna knock you down
no hesitation &amp; you know there's ain't no doubt
like a bulldozer I'm going to knock you out

The story given just doesn't ring true
the opportunity was given to you
responsibility is flushed down the drain
its time you understand and the meaning of pain

Hit me for six but I'm coming back around
like a bulldozer I'm gonna knock you down
no hesitation &amp; you know there's ain't no doubt
like a bulldozer I'm going to knock you out

The story given just doesn't ring true
the opportunity was given to you
responsibility is flushed down the drain
its time you understand and the meaning of pain

Hit me for six but I'm coming back around
like a bulldozer I'm gonna knock you down
no hesitation &amp; you know there's ain't no doubt
like a bulldozer I'm going to knock you out
