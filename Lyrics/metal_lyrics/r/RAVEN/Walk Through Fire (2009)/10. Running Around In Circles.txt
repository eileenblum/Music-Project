I'm running just to stand still
can't seem to catch a break
winner on a losing streak
I'm giving but they always take

Time is getting tighter - will I stand or will I fall

I'm running around in circles
bit I know just what to do
the hour is getting nearer
gotta make that leap of faith over to you

Tied up and feeling real tied down
falling out of range
busting outta this balloon
time to make a change

Run out of excuses gotta do this on my own

I'm running around in circles
but I know just what to do
the hour is getting nearer
gotta make that leap to you

I listened hard I under stood
but in the end it did no good
I realized I had to see
what was waiting there for me
