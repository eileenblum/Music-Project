Hear the rumors wolves
are at your heels
fragile fingers strangle
broken ideals
no illusion see the light of day
fading faster cannot get away
fingers pointing knives
are at your back

No surprise you know there
ain't no wonder
if you let go your know
you're going under now
just get a grip on yourself
just get a grip
just get a grip on yourself
just get a grip
just get a grip on yourself

Ancient history rears
its ugly head
truth is twisted as
the lies are read
makes no difference
what they're trying to said
I'm never giving them
the time of day
I got two fingers for you
get outta my way

No surprise you know
there ain't no wonder
if you let go you know
you're going under now
just get a grip on yourself

Friend or foe just try to
hold the wire
you're the one who's gonna
take you higher
if you let go you know
you're going under now

just get a grip on yourself
just get a grip
just get a grip on yourself
