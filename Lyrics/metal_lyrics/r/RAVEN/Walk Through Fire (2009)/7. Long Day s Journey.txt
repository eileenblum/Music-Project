In the evening when its over
and the smoke is coming down
when you wake up will you realise
that your luck ain't turning round
at the start line under the gun
but it does not feel the same
you hit bottom for the last time
and there's no-one else to blame

You never listen - that's why you never learn
you saw the straight line but still you made the turn
one day soon you're gonna realize

It's a long day's journey
back to the beginning - back to the start
long day's journey
back to the beginning - once again

See you building all your bridges
just to see them burn
taking twisted pleasure
showing no concern
diving headlong into darkness
with no safety net below
will you wake up will you come back
when there's no where left to go

You never listen - that's why you never see
you saw the straight line &amp; turned around to me
is this the day you're gonna realize

It's a long day's journey
back to the beginning - back to the start
long day's journey
back to the beginning - once again

It's a long day's journey
back to the beginning - back to the start
long day's journey
back to the beginning - back to the start
long day's journey
back to the beginning - once again

Back to the start once again
