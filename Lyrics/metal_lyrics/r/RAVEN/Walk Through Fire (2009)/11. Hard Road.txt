I still remember I still recall
where I was when they started it all
from hall to hotel the cast would change
kept firing but were always out of range

Gonna take you by the hand
gonna make you understand

Its a long hard road you gotta travel
to get where you belong
it's a long hard road but in the end
it can only make you strong
make you strong

The wind grew stronger the tide had turned
we crossed the ocean as the bridges burned
I still remember I still feel
we made a bargain but you broke the deal

But the battle rages on
even after you are gone

Its a long hard road you gotta travel
to get where you belong
it's a long hard road but in the end
it can only make you strong
make you strong

Win or lose its ll the same
As long as you are still in the game
you may be down but there's no doubt
they can never really count you out

But the battle rages on
even after you are gone

Its a long hard road you gotta travel
to get where you belong
it's a long hard road but in the end
it can only make you strong
its a long hard road
its a long hard road
its a long hard road you gotta travel
to get where you belong
