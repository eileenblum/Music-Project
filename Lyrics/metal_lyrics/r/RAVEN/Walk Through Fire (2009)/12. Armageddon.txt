You think I'm crazy
maybe it's true
but I know that
I got one up on you
I know what's coming
and you won't learn
until the time is right
and unholy fire fills the night

Nobody knows it's the end
no-one knows it's the beginning
nobody has to pretend
no-one can see that
it's all coming down
all coming down

You think I'm cracked up
but you will know
when it's too late to try
&amp; stop the show
It's open season
you're gonna learn
and when the time is right
we'll be burned with
cauterizing light

Nobody knows it's the end
no-one knows it's the beginning
nobody has to pretend
no-one can see that
it's all coming down

All coming down

And when the time is right
and you never will
believe the sight

Nobody knows it's the end
no-one knows it's the beginning
nobody has to pretend
no-one can see that
it's all coming down
