No explanation intimidation
you'll never know 'til I'm right up on you
I've got the element of surprise

I'm crushing under your radar
I'm getting close to my goal
I'm breaking through your defences
you know this time I'm taking control

You let your guard down
I'm in with no sound
you'll never guess what I'm going to do
looks like lady luck's run out on you

I'm crushing under your radar
I'm getting close to my goal
I'm breaking through your defences
this time I ain't gonna stop

Do you look in the mirror
In the back of your mind
hiding round every corner
too late

Every time you stepped on someone
you'll feel it like it's A thousand ton
you've given freely &amp; now it's time
to take what's coming - coming you

This information and my elation
going at you at maximum speed
sling your hook pal time to believe

I'm crushing under your radar
I'm getting close to my goal
I'm breaking through your defences
this time I ain't gonna stop
