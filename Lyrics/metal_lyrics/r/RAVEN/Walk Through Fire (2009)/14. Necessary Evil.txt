[Japanese bonus track]

Take the one way ticket
strapped into your seat
gonna take you out of bounds
and knock you flying

You'll dedicate assimilate
and detonate

It's a necessary evil
- it's a beautiful disease
It's a twisted kind of logic
gonna take your spirit higher
while it drags you to your knees

Think you're going crazy
when it takes control
got a vice grip on your mind
and squeeze your soul

You'll dedicate assimilate
and celebrate this fury

Once you start the journey
you'll never reach the end
you'd best hold on with all you got
and come out swinging
