Tunnel vision never seeing
what lies behind
no decision necessary
they'll feed your mind

Why don't you open your eyes
cos there's too much to see
gotta cast away your chains
set yourself free

Breaking you down
turning you round
taking you way underground
breaking you down
turning you round
I'll turn it up until you can see it

Black &amp; white is all you got no shades of grey
if you step over the edge
its gonna blow you away

Why don't you open your mind
cos there's no turning back
gotta cast away your chains
listen to me

Breaking you down
turning you round
taking you way underground
breaking you down
turning you round
pulling you under

Daily beloved
we are gathered here today
to celebrate the power
the glory the truth
of sheer volume

Breaking you down
turning you round
taking you way underground
breaking you down
turning you round
