[Montrose Cover]

Start with a Sun and move on out
The future's in the skies above.
The Heavens unfold and a new star is born.
Space and time makin' love.

Oh, what a time we had
Livin' underground.
I move to station number five
See you next time around.

As far as you want and close as you need
It's all in your mind you know.
This old Earth hasn't really seen it's day
It's here...time to go.

I remember when it was so clear
We were young but the memory still remains.
To pick fruit from a tree, fish from the seas
Now nothing's left here but the stains.
But I can't cry no more, can only be glad
That there's other places we can be.
If the time suites you right I'm leaving tonight
Come fly away with me!
