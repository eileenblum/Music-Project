The pressure builds and there's no escape
there's no illusion caught on the tape
you think you'll falling it ain't over
light in the tunnel supernova

If you can't take the heat
if you can't keep the beat
there's only one way

Walk through fire and you're gonna burn
walk through fire past the point of no return
walk through fire
only way to take it to the edge &amp; push as far as you can go

The starter's gun but you're in last place
each obstacle slams into your face
the odds are you'll never win this race

If you can't do the time
if you can't see the sign
there's only one way

Walk through fire and you're gonna burn
walk through fire past the point of no return
walk through fire
only way to take it to the edge &amp; push as far as you can go

Over the edge into the flame
losing your mind but you will gain
you're soul will scream
you're brain will burn there's no escape there's no return

Walk through fire and you're gonna burn
walk through fire past the point of no return
walk through fire
walk through fire and you're gonna burn
walk through fire
