[single 1981]

That complacent tramp setting the world on fire
Cunts to smell you're ready to kill
And the father that calls me a liar

[Chorus:]
You can't shimmy down
Be her in this town
You won't know the score
To the break of the dawn
You're totally wiped out
Oh you're gonna cut down
You're gonna be ow wiped out!

Ow

White fox is burning Lucy's been
In the wrath of the fire
You chosen the wrath of my breath
And you knew I would

[Chorus]

Turn you in for it kill
It can't hurt inside pain
Make you see her right now
All you want is.. ??

[Lead break ]

Ow

Oh yeah!

[Repeat verse 1]

Wiped out!
