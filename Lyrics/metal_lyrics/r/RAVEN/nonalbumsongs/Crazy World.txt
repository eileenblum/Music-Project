[single 1981]

whoa
whoa

Violents and downbeats panic in the street
Anger and frustration boiling the blood
Drain all your confidence like water from the tap
You are screaming but you never rule the school
Take your chances in this crazy world, live in fear
Don't hesitate, you gotta concentrate any ounce of fear

While we are stripping back you make me feel so good
Twisting my mind like a pig on a spit
I'm just running out of time and time again
Black sparing[?] like a epileptic fit
Take your chances in the crazy world, live in fear
Don't hesitate, you gotta concentrate any ounce of fear

[Lead break]

You can't go down
You waste your time
You want the world

I take my chance
You waste no time
I want my yell

I look around and I just lose control of my senses!
Tripping at my mind and at my soul defenceless!

[?] putting the risk to accept were never strong with a view
Way to play it on my mind and tell you what to do
We gotta get out of this place and we're are game and will
I shake hands with the sick you should have seen them!
Take your chances in a crazy world, live in fear
Don't hesitate, you gotta concentrate any ounce!
OUNCE!
GET OUT OF HERE!!
