I carried you now you broke my back
It's always two steps forward and three steps back
Ain't no use in denying the truth

All too late
There's no time to clean the slate
I'm taking it to the extreme
I'm gonna make you scream

Never believed what everyone said
You told me it was all in my head
Now I know not a word was true

No escape giving me too little too late
I'm taking it to the extreme
I'm gonna make you scream

Lies - one after another
Lies - could not see the sign
Lies - I had to discover
Lies - the end of the line
