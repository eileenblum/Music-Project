So high and mighty
Got your finger on the pulse and in control
I wear my hatred
Like a badge of honour nailed right through my soul

No surrender
We will remember
There's no forsaking the call
Never give in to what they're giving you
No surrender just give your all

No sense of wonder
I can see the lesson but you'll never learn
But come tomorrow
You'll be flying high so I can make you crash and burn

No hesitation
There's no hiding place there ain't no holy ground
Tried and convicted
Got the verdict and we're gonna hunt you down
