The signs were clear for all to see
Data manipulated easily
The waters muddied the buck was passed
Running so fast to try and save your ass

You crossed the line too many times
Too high too far too soon

You can't stop a chain reaction
You can't stop a tidal wave
You can't stop the silver bullet
That's gonna put you in your grave

You told the story and it all rang true
But every loose end pointed back to you
The broken pieces of your twisted schemes
Grinding against you as you start to scream

Breaking the unwritten law
Too high too far too soon

Why didn't we listen closely
Why didn't we seek the truth
Why did we believe?
