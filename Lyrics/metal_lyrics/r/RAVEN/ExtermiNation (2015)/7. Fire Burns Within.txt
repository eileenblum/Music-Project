No one knows where it's from
No one can know where it's been
But it's the air we breathe
But when you see the light
Deliver second sight

It's no mystery to the faithful
Our reality one and all
Stand up when you hear the call

There's no holding back when the fire burns within
You gotta unleash the power
There's no turning back when the fire burns inside

They don't know how it feels
They don't understand the truth
But it's the air that we breathe
But when you hear that sound
And feel the thunder
