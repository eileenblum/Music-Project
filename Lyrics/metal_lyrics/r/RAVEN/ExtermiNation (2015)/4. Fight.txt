Think you got the best of me got it figured out
Am I down for the count you know there ain't no doubt
I'll be coming back at you stronger than before
Obliterate and decimate and you will be no more

I'm gonna
Fight fight - never giving in
Fight fight - you know I'm gonna win
Fight fight - never gonna stop
Fight fight - I'm gonna rock until you drop

Bones are made of iron
Born and bred to rock
Coming from the bottom and I'm headed for the top
Never gonna stop me you're rotten to the core
With metal fists of fury you will hear this lion roar

It's not the money it's not the power
Anticipation of the final hour
It's being one with the game

I'm gonna fight for what is right
I'll take my place in history
Not giving in not giving out
This ain't over
With everything that I got
I'm gonna lift myself up and
And tear you down

Not giving in not giving out - no this ain't over
