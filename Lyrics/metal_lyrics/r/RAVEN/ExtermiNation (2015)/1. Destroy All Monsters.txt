A battle never ending
Fear and doom descend
Join with us and fight them
Join with us, my friends

'Cause it's time to be a hero
Time to push them back
Weaponize your anger and attack!

See the people running
As the mighty cities fall
An alien grip around my throat
I'm up against the wall
Unleash atomic firepower
Gonna kill them all

Destroy all monsters
Screaming burning death from above
Destroy all monsters
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack
Destroy all monsters
Screaming burning death from above
Destroy all monsters

Exterminate [4x]

Walking dead among us
Demon in the eye
Infiltrate and decimate
Your theories are all lies

Tearing us to pieces
There's got to be a way
Lock and load
It's judgment day

See the people running
As the mighty cities fall
An alien grip around my throat
I'm up against the wall
Unleash atomic firepower
Gonna kill them all

Destroy all monsters
Screaming burning death from above
Destroy all monsters
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack
Destroy all monsters
Screaming burning death from above
Destroy all monsters

Exterminate [4x]

We're fighting for life itself
Until the bitter end

With devastating torment
The mighty giants fall
Monuments of hatred
A lesson to us all

My friends don't look too human
It's getting hard to tell
They're gonna have to burn in hell

See the people running
As the mighty cities fall
An alien grip around my throat
I'm up against the wall
Unleash atomic firepower
Gonna kill them all

Destroy all monsters
Screaming burning death from above
Destroy all monsters
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack
Destroy all monsters
Screaming burning death from above
Destroy all monsters

Exterminate [4x]
