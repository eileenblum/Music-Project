On the edge of madness in the grip of fear
Disconnected on the edge 'til all hope disappears
Every time you tried to shoot me down
My dreams denied without a sound

A light comes out the dark there's something you don't know
An obsessive infection that's never letting go

The blood runs red
Kill the things you do kill the things you said
The blood runs red
Under my tank treads

Slashing with the razor cutting to the bone
Destroy every tie I held until I was alone
Every time you tried to hunt me down
My dreams denied without a sound

They lock the door and throw away the key
It's just not enough to paralyse your destiny

And now you know breathe in the pain
And now you know how it feels to be insane
