The torture isn't over
They nailed me to the door
Didn't need a hammer
I was beaten by the law

It never makes no difference
The hooks are in too deep
Sanity is screaming
The madness never sleeps

Beaten not broken crawled across the floor
Beaten not broken I could never find the door

Hold on with all you got for one more day
Tomorrow's coming you will find another way
Believe and you can make it one more day
Unchain yourself and you can make it through

Time for graduation time to win the prize
I reached out with open arms but every time I was denied

Back at the beginning hunger for the taste
Only way to win is to get back into the race

You can make it
