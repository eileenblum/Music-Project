I told them I showed them
Each face just passed me by
They saw me ignored me
I saw the truth to be a lie

Another day another way
You understand that I'm your hero
Tried to see - reality
But every turn brings me to zero

You looking at me but you never see my eyes

Start again to make amends
But all I see is the bitter end

I can't wait until tomorrow
Gotta make you suffer today
I can't wait until tomorrow
It doesn't matter what you say
Spiralling out of control

Another day another way
You understand that I'm your hero
Tried to see - reality
But every turn brings me to zero

You'll never see the real me
The file corrupted and the line is broken
Ostracised in your disguise
The hidden words are never spoken

You see me talking but you never hear a word

I elect to disconnect
Shut it down once and for all

I can't wait til tomorrow
