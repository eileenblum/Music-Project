They tried to tell me this ain't working
I wouldn't listen - was on a mission
They tried to tell me this is broken
I told 'em flat out to go to hell

No handouts nothing comes easy
No cashback no guarantees
No assets other than anger
No cure 'cos I got the disease

It's not what you got it's the way that you do it
It's not what you got it's the way that you rock
It's not what you do it's the power you give it
It's not what you got it's the way that you rock

They tried to tell me take it easy
I wouldn't listen was on a mission
Showed me like it was on TV
I told 'em flat out to go to hell

Take every chance that comes near you
Break everything in your way
No assets other than anger
Stealing tomorrow just to make it today
