Striking the hour we got the power
Gonna hook it deep inside of you
We got the attitude give me the aptitude
Giving you a metal rendezvous

Crank it higher your desire
Time to devour making it louder
Pushing it over the top

Feeding the monster
United and conquer
Give it and it's coming back to you
Feeding the monster making it stronger
Believe it and you know you'll make it true

And now you feel it - your sanity slips
One way ticket nowhere else to go
Reaping the whirlwind crazy how it begins
Over the edge hit the undertow

Undeniable, indescribable
Unpredictable, unforgettable
Indivisibly, electricity
Perfect symmetry synchronicity
