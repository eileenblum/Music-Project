When there's nothing more you can do
When your fears are all coming true
When your eyes are blinded by doubt
And you don't want to know what it's really about

Hard to tell the darkness from the light
In your soul you know what's wrong and right

Got to drag yourself out of the door
Never know what today's got in store
Trust in nothing but what you can feel
Cast aside the distractions and get to what's real

You can turn the corner keep it true
Within your soul you know exactly what to do

Cross the river of no return
Leave it all in the distance to crash and burn
Cross the river of no return
Just look forward into the sun

Can't believe when they tell you it's right
Truth is not always shown in black and white
All the reasons were hidden away
For the lost and the lonely someone must pay

You can tell the darkness from the light
Inside yourself you've got the power
And you've got the right
