I heard his voice on the radio he set the town alight
I saw his face on the video a problem child all right
Strutting his stuff on the stage
The man was back in town
High voltage to the highway to hell
You had to hear the sound

Just a force of nature like a hurricane
You all know his name

He was the thunder down under
A rock n roller through and through
He was the thunder down under
Spotlight pirate of the rhythm and blues
He was the thunder down under
The one and only rock and rolling man

With a wink and a story he'd always pull you in
Telling you about Rosie and the city of sin

He didn't want to be a millionaire
He only had one goal
But it's a long way to the top
When you want to rock and roll

Just a force of nature like a hurricane
You all know his name

He was the thunder down under
A rock n roller through and through
He was the thunder down under
Spotlight pirate of the rhythm and blues
He was the thunder down under
Did the bad boy boogie til his final stand
He was the thunder down under
The one and only rock and rolling man
