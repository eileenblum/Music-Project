See the madmans grinning face holding his gun up to the sky
Etched in their minds the time and place
Too bad they never
Questioned why a nobody could raise himself to infamy
Open your eyes and you will see
Nothings as it appears to be
In the wilderness of broken glass
Liars bury the twisted past
See the proud men in control sifting sand but they all know
Truth is not the object here nail the blame
On the scapegoats skin storys over
Feed the furnace and push him in
See the photos watch the movie the camera can lie
No escaping these conclusions
You stripped away the innocence
Gave birth to years of dissonance
Paranoia rears its head
Long live the king - The king is dead
Wall of silence starts to fall piece by piece it is revealed
Time and time again it seems
One man rises, one man stands, one man speaks out
Shows the blood upon their hands will not bow to their demands
No more.
