Don't want the negative
Gimme the positive
Things are tough enough I don't
Want to hear you whine
Don't want no third rate second
Stringer wannabees
Call in the first division make 'em crack
it up because

I'm hungry - I need to feed come on
I'm hungry - Don't want no second best
I'm hungry - Won't buy what you sell
Because
I'm hungry - gimme gimme gimme
The real thing.

You tried to tear it down rip it out and let it die
Who cares for quality selling mediocrity
But hiding underground the keepers of the flame
Don't want no imitation they don't need alternative.
