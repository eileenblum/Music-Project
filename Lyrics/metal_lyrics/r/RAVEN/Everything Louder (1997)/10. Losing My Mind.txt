You come on like a freight train no way out in sight
You want to go the full nine yards morning noon and night
Can't take it anymore you set my brain alight
Oh no - You got me going
Oh no - One more time oh no - I hear you coming
Won't you draw the line
Losing, losing, losing, losing my mind, losing, losing
Everything I say or do
One more night is gonna break my back in two
You got me under pressure mile after mile
I know the show must go on but I cannot raise a smile
Can't take it anymore right out of control
Won't you listen cant you see
You keep this up you know you're really gonna be
The death of me
I need a month to relax I gotta get some peace
Trouble is once you start you never ever cease.
