Each time like the first time last shot that I'll get
Got to hit the target I aint got no safety net
Taking all the chances put that foot down to the floor
If nothing else I Know theres just one way to go
Its my philosophy 
Push hard - You'll see
That its meant to be 
No pain no gain
You pick yourself up and you do it again 
No rest never stop
Like I told you gonna rock until I drop
Feel down from the mountain bleeding on the floor
I can hear them laughing but they don't known the score
Work my fingers break your bones 7 I'll
Knock down that door
They think thats its a sin to have the will to win
Its my philosophy 
I'll kick so hard you'd best be on your guard.
