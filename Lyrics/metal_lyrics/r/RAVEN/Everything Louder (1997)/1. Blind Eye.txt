Brought up hard on a mean street take
The rough with the smooth
You gotta go with the flow now get
Right into the groove
Think you're gonna be righteous no 
Room here for a saint
You see me coming and you best beware
Turn a blind blind eye
Out of sight is out of mind
Turn a blind blind eye
Never seek and you wont find
Turn a blind blind eye
If you don't see then you dont lie
Gimme an alibi - You never saw nobody die
Striking out at the market feel the turn of the screw
No way you can repay them - Hey well
I can help you
You want the slate to be wiped clean
Get them all off your back
Just tell the story theres no looking back
Is that your consience calling you
Maybe theres something you can do 
To help you make it through the night
You keep your lips sealed tight
No matter how much you pay them
What you're willing to do
Take a hard look around you this was
Coming to you
If you live like a hard man gonna die behind bars
You're out the picture noone need beware.
