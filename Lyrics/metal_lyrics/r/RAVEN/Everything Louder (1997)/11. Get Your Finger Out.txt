Wake up in the morning go right back to bed
All you got is comic songs running through your head
Keep on going nowhere you'll just disappear
Pull yourself together
Get your finger out and get into gear
You want to make the big time what you got to fear
Pull yourself together
Get your finger out and get into gear
Running on that treadmill 9 to 5 and more
Hey if thats all there is to life
I'm never gonna cross that door
It doesn't matter who you are don't care what you do
If you're really trapped the only one thats gonna 
break the chains is you.
