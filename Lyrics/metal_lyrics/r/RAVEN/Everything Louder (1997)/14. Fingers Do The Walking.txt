I know what I want I'm gonna grab it with both hands
Gotta keep a moving to satisfy demand
You got what I want and I'll right through that door
The only trouble is I'm always wanting more
Wait until their backs are turned before you know
I'll let my fingers do the walking and you'll see what I can do
Fingers do the walking and I'll walk all over you
There aint nothing you hold sacred that I cannot take away
Let my fingers do the walking and I'll be right on my way
You can keep your mortgage and your 9 to 5
I'll just take your money and get it in my car and drive
You think I'm crazy well be that as it may
Look in your walley guess how much made today
Wait until your backs are turned before you know
You think its all over 'cos I'm under lock and key
Talk to my lawyer and I'm sure he'll disagree
Soon as I make bail I'll disappear into the night
Can't help if I don't know whats wrong and what is right.
