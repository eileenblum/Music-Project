Do you know what you're doing think you
Made the right move
Don't you think you'd be better take rough with the smooth
Do you know where you're going setting off on your own
Don't you think it'd be easier staying inside the comfort zone
I can feel it I can see it
Know that I'll reach my holy grail
No disguising no denying gonna reach out
I'm gonna climb up the mountain
I'm gonna reach for the sky
Do you know what you're doing you've been here for so long
Did you ever consider it was us that made you strong
Hey you should be grateful we made you
What you are today 
I don't know how could you stand up and walk away
I'm gonna climb up the mountain
I'm gonna reach for the sky
I'm gonna stand on top of the world.
