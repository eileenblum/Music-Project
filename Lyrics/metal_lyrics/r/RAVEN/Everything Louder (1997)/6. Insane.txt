Yes I heard the story great white 
Hope once and future king
Well that was then and this is now
Lured by the glory turned to make it real again
Don't look back in anger
Don't look back in pain
Just look to the future
And concentrate like you're insane
Like you're insane
No reciminations nothing ventured
Never nothing gained
And I got my hands full
Its never if you win or lose you just
Got to keep on fighting
Listen to yourself 
You're the only one who knows
No limitations
Take what you got and make it work
I got a mean streak - Its half a mile wide
I'm gonna push you and reach the other side.
