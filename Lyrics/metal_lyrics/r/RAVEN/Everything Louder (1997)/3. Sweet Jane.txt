Under the microscope building up their hope
Stinging them on you really got it down
Another sad sack falls prey to your attack
Crawling after you all over the town.

Sweet sweet Jane dont you hear me
They stare at you but you just don't see
So insane its so easy
You pull their chain oh so viciously
They love you for your mind not your body.

They way she walks that walk she got
That curvature
She knows so well its gonna drag them down
Busting out on top and leaving them behind
But thats as close as they'll get no doubt.

Just what I've always wanted but I can never be
So wrapped up in herself she's never gonna see.

You want an eyeful - She's so delightful
Check out the merchandise all on show
But if you get too close she's gonna burn you
One way ticket and its time to go.
