Hunting seeking move in for the kill
Into focus you won I hear a sound until
Rights read in monotone and then they're stripped away
Trust is eroded confidence betrayed
You're turning you're burning fabric of your life is torn apart
Crushed between the wheels
Crushed between 
One law - Slow strangulation by red tape
One law - Stealing time what does your future hold now
Burning wreckage one that got away
Fingers pointing let the chips fall where they may
You're turning you're learning
Swift manipulation of the truth
No light lost in the darkness - Reach out but who can you trust
Nightmare breaking the silence no one gets out of here alive.
