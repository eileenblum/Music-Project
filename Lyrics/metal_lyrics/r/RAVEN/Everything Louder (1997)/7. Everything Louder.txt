Never travelled  your road stubborn as a mule
Worked and slaved to make it real I bet you think that I'm a fool
But if you listen me I'll tell you what I've learned
There aint no easy way
You got to pull together you got to make a stand
You got to get your goal in sight never give in to their demands
And make everything louder than everything else
Stretch to the limit and better yourself 
When you're backs to the wall you must answer the call
When it seems you must stumble remember
All for one and one for all
All the talk I'm hearing you say the lifeblood's disappeared
The only thing thats missing is what used to be between your ears
I've never listened to you but I'm about to make you see
This is our philosophy
you got to make it happen theres no one else it must be you
You got to get your goal in sight never give in and follow  through
They never want to listen they think the bridge is burned 
Oh but theres a better way
