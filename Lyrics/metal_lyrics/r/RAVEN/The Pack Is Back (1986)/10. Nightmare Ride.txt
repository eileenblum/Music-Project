Jolts of power, turbo charge
Ultra streamline fuselage
Engines reeling into gear
Take a journey into fear
You know your time has come
Let's have some fun

Can you take the strain inside
Come with me on the nightmare ride

Bound in terror, gagged in shock
Break the limit, smash the lock
Smokin' rubber hits the track
No release, no turning back
The journey just begun
Let's have some fun

Jolts of power built to last
Skull and crossbones on the mast
She's a rebel with a cause
Start to run but she's all yours

You know your time has come
Let's have some fun
The journey just begun
Let's have some fun

Can you take the strain inside
Come with me on the nightmare ride
