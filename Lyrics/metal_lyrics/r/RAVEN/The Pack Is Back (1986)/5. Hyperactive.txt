Red lights, baby
Always drive me crazy
Bull fights, that's right
All night long
Hot shot, bad girl
Gonna make your hair curl
Pinball, that's right
All night long

Every day I cry
Every day I die
It's a game I'm in
And we're out to win
So the wheels go rolling on
I'm talkin' bout hyperactive acceleration
Hyperactive acceleration
Start your engines
The boys are back
And they're right on track
For their hyper-act

Telecaster
He's the master blaster
Does he S.P.
All night long
Slapshot iceman
Really is a mad man
Gung-ho, wacko
All night long

Every day I cry
Every day I die
It's a game I'm in
And we're out to win
So the wheels go rolling on
I'm talkin' bout hyperactive acceleration
Hyperactive acceleration
Start your engines
The boys are back
And they're right on track
For their hyper-act

Loud mouth, screamin'
Gets you when you're dreamin'
Jumpin' Jack Flash
All night long

Every day I cry
Every day I die
It's a game I'm in
And we're out to win
So the wheels go rolling on
I'm talkin' bout hyperactive acceleration
Hyperactive acceleration
Start your engines
The boys are back
And they're right on track
For their hyper-act
