Seeing
Rising up the crowds
Is believing
Standing tall, standing proud
All we need is the spark
The bite is worse than the bark

We are the rock rock dogs
We are the rock rock dogs
We are the rock rock dogs
No one can stop us now

The thrill
Creeping out from the black
Of the deal
The heat of breath on your back
All we need is the spark
The bite is worse than the bark

We are the rock rock dogs
We are the rock rock dogs
We are the rock rock dogs
No one can stop us now

We are the rock rock dogs
We are the rock rock dogs
We are the rock rock dogs
No one can stop us now

Look out

We are the rock rock dogs
We are the rock rock dogs
We are the rock rock dogs
No one can stop us now
