Somewhere deep in the night
War plans are discussed by the lamplight
Faces smile with delight
Freedom is the key for a rumble tonight

Cold and hungry
Reckless to the bone
Fighting for
The only cause they know

Young blood running in the night
Young blood on the streets
Young blood fight for the right
Young blood got their hands on the power

Somehow on the far side of town
They know what's about to go down
Switchblades gleam in the night
Freedom is the key for a rumble tonight

Watching, waiting
Till they hear the call
Let the heavens help us all

Young blood running in the night
Young blood on the streets
Young blood fight for the right
Young blood got their hands on the power

Hands on the power

Watching, waiting
Hear the call
Let the heavens help us all

Young blood running in the night
Young blood on the streets
Young blood fight for the right
Young blood got their hands on the power

Hands on the Power
