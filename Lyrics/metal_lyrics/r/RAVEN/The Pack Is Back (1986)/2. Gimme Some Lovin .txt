Well my temperature's risin'
And my feet on the floor
Twenty people rockin'
And they wanna go more
Come here, baby
I don't know what you've got
But you better take it easy
'Cause this place is hot

So glad we made it
So glad we made it
Come on gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day

Feels so good
Everything is soundin' high
Better take it easy
'Cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day
And I don't know what to do
Wait a minute, baby
It could happen to you, and I'm

So glad we made it
So glad we made it
Come on gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day

So glad we made it

Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Come on gimme some lovin'
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin', gimme some
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' everyday
