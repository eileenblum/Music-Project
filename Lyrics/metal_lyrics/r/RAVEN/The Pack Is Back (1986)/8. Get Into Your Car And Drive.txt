Some of us have it
Some of us not
Tell me what it takes
Tell me what it takes
Give me a reason
Throw me a line
Show me what I got
You know it what I need

If you take it, break it
Throw it around
Well there's a fire burnin'
Down below

Lonely is the road
That never ends
(You gotta) Live it, love it
You gotta stay alive
Get into your car and drive

Look at tomorrow
What do you see
Hit the city lights
Hit the city nights
Where will take me
Nobody knows
I'll just keep on drivin'
Drivin' all the same

If you take it, break it
Throw it around
Well there's a fire burnin'
Down below

Lonely is the road
That never ends
(You gotta) Live it, love it
You gotta stay alive
Get into your car and drive

You better run for cover
The fire's burning hot
Watch out

Lonely is the road
That never ends
(You gotta) Live it, love it
You gotta stay alive
Get into your car and drive
