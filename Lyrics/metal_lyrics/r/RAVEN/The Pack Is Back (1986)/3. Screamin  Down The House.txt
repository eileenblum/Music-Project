Hear a noise
Up and down the street
The foundations are rockin'
And the crowd burnin' my feet

Come on in and join the fun
The night is strong
And the party's just begun
Oh it's just begun
Whatever you want I know we got it
Listen here, my friends
'Cause a chance like this
Might ever coming again

Because we're screamin' down the house
Screamin' down the house
You never should've left us alone
No, you never should've left us alone

Because we're screamin' down the house
Screamin' down the house
You never should've left us alone
No, you never should've left us alone

Don't come around if you wanna relax
I got a brand new system
And it's turned up to the max
Up to the max
the girls are waitin'
And the boys are prowlin'
The drinks are free
And you can blame it all on me
Whatever you want I know you got it
Listen here, my friends
It's a party that you
Really should attend

Because we're screamin' down the house
Screamin' down the house
You never should've left us alone
No, you never should've left us alone

Because we're screamin' down the house
Screamin' down the house
You never should've left us alone
No, you never should've left us alone

Rockin', how's that
Rollin', hows that
Screamin'
The party's just begun

The neighbors say
You've gotta keep it down
But I don't care
If the law comes hand in gun
I'm public enemy number one

Because we're screamin' down the house
Screamin' down the house
You never should've left us alone
No, you never should've left us alone

Because we're screamin' down the house
Screamin' down the house
You never should've left us alone
No, you never should've left us alone
