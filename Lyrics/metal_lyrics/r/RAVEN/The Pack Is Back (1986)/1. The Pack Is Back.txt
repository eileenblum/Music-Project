Here we are
What are we doin'
Take a look
What do they want
So much for an easy livin'
We just wanna scream

Matchstick woman
Matchstick man
Individuality
Down the drain
Baby take that tan
Pleasure and pain
Don't you know what you can do
When it's only up to you

[Chorus:]
Open your hearts and shout it (hey)
You've gotta stand up and be counted
Open your arms and shout it
The pack is back
Open your hearts and shout it
You've gotta stand up and be counted now and forever more
The pack is back

Shake it, break it, tear it down
You want power, we've got muscle

Attitude, power will kneel this town
Now it's gotta stop
Don't you know what you can say
Just the (________) of the day

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Don't you know what you can do
When it's only up to you

The pack is back [2x]
The pack

[Chorus 3x]
