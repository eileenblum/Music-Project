Got my blood on the boil
Got my heart on the run
And I'm in for the kill
Before the day is done
You've got everything I love
You've got everything I hate
But there's just one thing
I've got to know

Can you feel me
Walkin' down your spine
I want you
To tell me that you're mine

All I want is all I need
All I want is all I need
All you've got is all I need
All I need

Take my money, take my gun
I'll do anything for fun
'Cause I'm in for the kill
Before this day is done
Put my life on the line
Tie my soul to the tracks
But there's just one thing
I've got to know

Can you hear me
Callin' out your name
Got my mind on putting you
To shame

All I want is all I need
All I want is all I need
All you've got is all I need
All I need
