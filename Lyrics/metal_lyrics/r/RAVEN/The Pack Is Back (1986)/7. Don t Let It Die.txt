In the air there's a feeling
Ready tonight
From now I'm just believin'
What is right
Don't need the trouble, don't need the fuss
Drop the gun on the floor
Give you all I've got
But you want more

Nobody likes when the bad girls wins
Nobody likes it at all
Can you feel the heat
Can you feel it tonight
Don't let it die
Don't let it fly away
Don't let it die
'Cause I'll get you back someday
Don't let it die

You can run to the sunset
Run if you can
From now I'm just believin'
I'm a man

Maybe you're crazy
Maybe you're not
How can I understand
All I want is you to take my hand

Nobody likes when the bad girls wins
Nobody likes it at all
Can you feel the heat
Can you feel it tonight
Don't let it die
Don't let it fly away
Don't let it die
'Cause I'll get you back someday
Don't let it die

Don't let it die
Don't let it die
Don't sweat it, forget it
Don't let it die

Maybe you're crazy
Maybe you're not
How can I understand
All I want is you to take my hand

Nobody likes when the bad girls wins
Nobody likes it at all
Can you feel the heat
Can you feel it tonight
Don't let it die
Don't let it fly away
Don't let it die
'Cause I'll get you back someday
Don't let it die

Don't let it die
Don't sweat it, forget it
Don't let it die
