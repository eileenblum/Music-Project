North Atlantic winter halfway through the homeward run
Headwind grows to force 8 as the ice blots out the sun
The captain eyes the compass and holds stead to south-east
But look over to starboard see the rising of the beast

The hunter picks his victim out, the weakest of the pack
He rises and delivers his attack
Run silent, run deep
Destructor below
All hell breaks above
They're after your blood

Explosion! And in disbelief the others turn and stare
And see the bail of fire that is spewed into the air
Destroyers seal off escape and respond to the attack
And drop their deadly cargo down to break the hunters back

The hunter is the hunted, the tables turned on you
Nothing else that you can do
Run silent, Run deep
Destructor below
All hell breaks above
They're after your blood

Blasted out the water, only wreckage tells the fate
Strewn across the ocean as the captain grips the rail
The incident is over turn the helm full speed ahead
A pause and turns his mind to work nothing to be said

[REPEAT 2nd CHORUS]
