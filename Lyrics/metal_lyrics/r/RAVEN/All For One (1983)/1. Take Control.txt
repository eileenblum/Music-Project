Up to here with promises
No we can't take no more
It's time to take what we can get
And even up the score

[CHORUS:]
Rising to the challenge
Take our chances with both hands
Take control
Ain't gonna lose it
Gonna take control now!

Work our fingers to the bone
We're fighting tooth and nail
Our backs may be against the wall
But there's no way we can fail

[CHORUS]

We're watching and we're waiting
In position lying low
We're too far gone to go back now
It's now or never, GO!

Scorched earth lies behind us
As we assume command
We're going up and we won't ever stop
It's time we made a stand

[CHORUS]
