Ever since I met you, been out of my mind
Never was a bad boy, never unkind
Might have been a hurricane once or twice
Gonna shoot you right between the eyes

[CHORUS:]
Run a million miles away
That's not far enough
Cause I'll come knockin' on your door
Screaming murder
I won't let them take it, take it away
Never, never away from me
I won't let them take it, take it away
Enough is enough and I'm aiming for you

Maybe no money maybe no job
Calling me a liar, calling me a slob
No sense of security
I want you do you want me?

[CHORUS]

First you push me up
Then you drag me down
I'm, I'm running blind
Don't you know you're blowing up my mind

[CHORUS]
