The plans were laid, the sights were set
Slaughtered were the brave
The children died just where they stood
Chistened in their graves

[CHORUS:]
Seek and destroy
Seek and destroy

Has God foreseen with aged eyes
A weapon far supreme
A holocaust to wipe the slate
And crush immortal dreams

Fire wind
Flash back
Mass attack
Wiped out

[CHORUS]

Weapon after weapon
After all that we've been through
Will we ever reach an end
You know it's up, it's up to you

The planet stands a monument
To all that lives and breaths
But what is war a tyranny
That evil men conceive

[CHORUS]
