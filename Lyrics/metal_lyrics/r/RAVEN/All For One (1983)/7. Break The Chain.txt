I've waited too many times
It's got to be now, It's got to be right
All night I've studied the signs
It's got to be now, It's flight or fight

Can't back out
Too much at stake I gotta get through
No mistake
Now is the time and I know what to do

[CHORUS:]
They ain't gonna take me away, No
I'm gonna break, break the chain
They ain't gonna take me away, No
I'm gonna break, break the chain

On the wire day after day
See the difference I just can't believe
The grass is greener that's what they say
I know that it's true and I gotta leave

Inch by inch
Cutting through see the light of day
No mistake
Now is the time and I know what to do

[CHORUS]

Cut the cable see the light of day
Cut it higher I'll be on my way

Can't back out
Too much at stake I gotta get through
No mistake
Now is the time and I know what to do

[CHORUS]
