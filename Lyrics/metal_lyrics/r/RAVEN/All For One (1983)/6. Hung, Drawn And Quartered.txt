Underneath the chambers
Right beneath their eyes
Sitting on a powder keg
Ending all their lies

Sentry turns too quickly
Everything is lost
Overpowered caught red-handed
What will be the cost

[CHORUS:]
Hung, drawn and quartered
Split from ear to ear
Hung, drawn and quartered
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldn't put me back together again

Ground into submission
They burn me to the bone
Question after question
In that mocking tone

Treason! Verdict of the jury
Black cap judges head
Take him to the wooden scaffold
Hang till you are dead

[CHORUS]

Dragged out by the kings guard
Branded by the crowd
Mornings entertainment
See them laugh aloud

Placed upon a funeral pyre
Dressed up to the nines
Every year razed to the ground
A 100,000 times

[CHORUS]
