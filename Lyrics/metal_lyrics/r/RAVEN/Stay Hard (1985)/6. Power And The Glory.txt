Take a look
Take a look around you
... at what you see
Mirrors in the air
Mirrors everywhere
They're reflection onto you
And they're reflecting onto me

well I just can't believe
This is the way

The power and the glory
Is what they want
The power and the glory
Is what they need
The power and the glory
Is what they want
They want the power, the power

The power and the glory

Listen to the leaders
Telling all the lies
Madness with desire
People tell your children
Not to play with fire

well I just can't believe
This is the way

The power and the glory
Is what they want
The power and the glory
Is what they need
The power and the glory
Is what they want
They want the power, the power

More power
The power and the glory, oh

Painted red or yellow
Painted black or white
A message to the mind
One small step for man
One giant step backwards for mankind

well I just can't believe
This is the way

The power and the glory
Is what they want
The power and the glory
Is what they need
The power and the glory
Is what they want
They want the power, the power

The power, power, power, power

well I just can't believe
This is the way

The power and the glory
Is what they want
The power and the glory
Is what they need
The power and the glory
Is what they want
They want the power, the power

well I just can't believe
This is the way

The power and the glory
Is what they want
The power and the glory
Is what they need
The power and the glory
Is what they want
They want the power, the power

They want the power, yeah
