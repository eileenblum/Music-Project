Take higher
Push it harder
You gotta take the strain
Sweat is runnin'
Breath is fire
Can you feel the pain

Take it to the top
Gotta psych it out
Power to the metal
Power to the metal
Never gonna stop
Until you reach the bar

Stay hard, stay wet
Stay hard, stay wet
Stay Hungry

Don't go runnin'
Keep it comin'
Push it one more time
Heart is jumpin'
Blood is pumpin'
Time after time

Take it to the top
Gotta psych it out
Power to the metal
Power to the metal
Never gonna stop
Until you reach the bar

Stay hard, stay wet
Stay hard, stay wet
Stay Hungry

Stay hard, stay wet
Stay hard, stay wet
Stay hard, stay wet
Stay Hungry

Stay hard, stay wet
Stay hard, stay wet
Stay Hungry
