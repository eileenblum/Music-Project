I'm gonna hunt you down
Just when you think that you're a getaway
I'll find every clue you drop
And never never stop
While I am undercover
Can you take the chance with your life

When the going gets tough
The tough gets going
And when the  going gets tough
The word is out
When the going gets tough
You'll hear me coming
And when the going gets tough
The tough get going

I got your fingeprints
I know you told me a story
Why man, the third degree
Is what you'll get from me
I don't need your money
I just want my blood on the run

When the going gets tough
The tough gets going
And when the  going gets tough
The word is out
When the going gets tough
You'll hear me coming
And when the going gets tough
The tough get going

Go

Hot blooded nightmare
Nowhere left to run

One million to one
Oh I'm coming, oh I'm closer
Hot on your trail
So close the sirens
Begin to wait

When the going gets tough
The tough get going
When the going gets tough
The tough get going
