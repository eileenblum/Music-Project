I love rock and roll

Baby do you wanna be my swing you could hang with me now
Do just what I say I cannot take it any other way out

Let your conscience set you free
Baby that's the way it's gotta be

Don't you love me, don't you want me, you know what it's all about
Take you to the top I'm gonna break and shake and wear you out

Come back to my house of sin
Now we're gonna race, I'm gonna win

Feel me burning
Wheels are turning
Red light, green light, run
Time to have some fun!

Ask no questions, tell no lies
Yours is not a reason why
Yours is but to do or die

One you're gonna have me and you know I'm gonna give you, that's right
Trouble at the bubble gonna huddle in the rubble tonight

Take the key and lock the door
Let me show you what I've got in store

No more talking
Just star walking
Red light green light run
Time to have some fun

Ask no questions, tell no lies
Yours is not a reason why
Yours is but to do or die

Come on! Come on! Bring it up!

Feel me burning
Wheels are turning
No more talking
Now we're walking...go!

Red light, green light, run!
Time to have some fun!

Ask no questions, tell no lies
Yours is not a reason why
Yours is but to do or die

(Oh yeah! Come on! Come on!)
