Here we go

You got me comin' and goin'
You fool me without sound
I try to roll with your punches
But you keep layin' them down

Givin' me a hard time
Makin' me lose my mind
You're givin' me a rough ride
You got me goin'
You're drivin' me wild

I got my hands on your assets
It brings the tears to you eyes
You wanna check my credentials
You're gonna get a surprise

Givin' me a hard time
Makin' me lose my mind
You're givin' me a rough ride
You got me goin'
You're drivin' me wild

Come on, drive crazy

You got me comin' and goin'
You fool me without sound
I try to roll with your punches
But you keep layin' them down

Givin' me a hard time
Makin' me lose my mind
You're givin' me a rough ride
You got me goin'
You're drivin' me wild
