I see that look in your eye
I know that you've got your mind
Set on movin' me
You say I'm too much to bear
I don't care

Maybe you...
Too hot to handle
Oh yes, I'm so scared of
There's still an ace in my pack

Raise your hands, put up a fight
Just make sure you get it right
Raise your hands
Get it, get it right

Raise your hands, put up a fight
Just make sure you get it right
Raise your hands
Get it, get it right

Why don't you bury your head
Too much to say
About too much of nothing
Banging your fist on the wall
You're just an out-dated fool
You don' t like my hair
I ain't gonna take anymore

Raise your hands, put up a fight
Just make sure you get it right
Raise your hands
Get it, get it right

Right, right

You gotta get it right
You gotta get it right
Get it right, oh get it right
You gotta get it right
You gotta get it right
You gotta get it right, yeah

Come on, come on, get it right
You gotta get it right
You gotta get it right
