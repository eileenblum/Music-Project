I can't move a inch
Looks like I'm trapped and here to stay
It doesn't really matter anyway, hey hey

Wet with perspiration
You know I'll do what I can
Got on, cut me loose
And let me show you what I am
I'm a restless child
Runnin' wild

I want freedom, I want power
I want time to play
I just can't have it any other way, hey hey
Nothing like a feeling

When the wind is in your hair
You can scream and shout
But I don't care
Because I know I'm a restless child
Runnin' wild
Restless child
Runnin' wild

I have got to run
I just can't take another day
It doesn't really matter anyway, hey hey

Wet with perspiration
You know I'll do what I can
Got on, cut me loose
And let me show you what I am
I'm a restless child
Runnin' wild

Restless child
Runnin' wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild
Runnin' wild
Restless child
I'm a restless child
