Nowhere to run
Caught in a trap
Deep in the heart and soul
Of the cold

Writing a line
Thinking of home
Wondering if you're
Waiting for me

Day after day
Let us pray for the sun
It's so cold out here now
And we're all on the run

Don't ask me why
why am I here
Deep in the heart and soul
Of the cold

Vision of white
Blinding my eyes
Sometimes I wonder
If I'll survive

Day after day
Let us pray for the sun
It's so cold out here now
And we're all on the run

Nowhere to run
Caught in a trap
Deep in the heart and soul
Of the cold

Vision of white
Blinding my eyes
Sometimes I wonder
If I'll survive

Day after day
Let us pray for the sun
It's so cold out here now
And we're all on the run
