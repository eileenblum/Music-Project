Oh yeah

Can't take the pace
It gets me riled
First you say no
Then you drive me wild
I ain't gonna take anymore

Bolt the windows, lock your door
You're gonna see what I've got in store
You're gonna get's comin' to you
Right now

It goes on and on and on and on and on
I won't take your foolin' around
On and on and on and on and on

Time after time
I've called for you
You're far too busy
Or you're feelin' blue
I ain't gonna take anymore
Your old lady can fly like a kite
Your dad won't put up much of a fight
The count has begun
You, me, now

It goes on and on and on and on and on
I won't take your foolin' around
On and on and on and on and on

It goes on and on and on and on and on
I won't take your foolin' around
On and on and on and on and on

Time after time
I've called for you
You're far too busy
Or you're feelin' blue
I ain't gonna take it, no

Bolt the windows, lock your door
You're gonna see what I've got in store
You're gonna get's comin' to you
Right now

On and on and on and on and on

I won't take your foolin' around
It goes on, on and on
It goes on, on and on
It goes on, on and on
You drive me wild
It goes on, oh yeah
