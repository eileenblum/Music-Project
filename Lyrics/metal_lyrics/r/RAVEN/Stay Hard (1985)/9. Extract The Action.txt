Let's go

Burnin' down the black
Huntin' for the one
You wanna take into your arms
Motor runnin' smooth
Motor runnin' clean
Tell you just exactly what we like
Make you sweat, make you smile
Won't let you go

Gotta extract the action
Take it, take it
Gotta extract the action
Make it, make it

Waitin' for a strike
Time is bringin' the bait
Into the eyes of woman child
Play that rhythm hard
Play that rhythm fast
Tell you just exactly what we like
Make you sweat, make you smile
Won't let you go

Gotta extract the action
Make it, make it
Gotta extract the action
Take it, take it

Watch out, here I come

Make you sweat, make you smile
Take...

Gotta extract the action
Take it, take it
Gotta extract the action
Make it, make it

Gotta extract the action
Take it, take it
Gotta extract the action
Make it, make it
