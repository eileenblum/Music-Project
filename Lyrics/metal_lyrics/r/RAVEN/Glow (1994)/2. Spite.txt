I'm the man, I'm the only one
That all your dreams depend upon
Believe in me, give your trust
I'm gonna grind you into dust

Because I want to
Because I want to
Don't ask me why
Because I want to

On the town one of the guys
But everything about you I despise
Think you're going right on track
But I'm the one who'll put the knife into your back

Because I want to
Because I want to
Don't ask me why
Because I want to

I'm the man, I'm the only one
That all your dreams depend upon
Believe in me, give your trust
I'm gonna grind you into dust

Because I want to
Because I want to
Don't ask me why
Because I want to
