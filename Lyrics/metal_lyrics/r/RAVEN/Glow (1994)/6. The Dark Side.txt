Try to keep my head held high
On the ground reaching for the sky
Balanced on the long and narrow way
But every now and narrow way
My good intentions and my dreams
Are cast aside as something
Rears its ugly head

The dark side comes to the surface
Turns me inside out
The dark side like whirlwind
Tears me up and then it spits me out

On the level pulling through
But all alone it gets to you
Slowly silently it drags you down

The dark side comes to the surface
Turns me inside out
The dark side like whirlwind
Tears me up and then it spits me out

Under the hammer
Knowing you can't turn back home
But there's no way out
Every step just leads you to the edge

The dark side comes to the surface
Turns me inside out
The dark side like whirlwind
Tears me up and then it spits me out
