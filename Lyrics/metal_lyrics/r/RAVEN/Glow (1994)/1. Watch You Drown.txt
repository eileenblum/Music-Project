You have so much to give
You climbed so high and left them take it
Lost in you prison cell
You took all the answers
Took the keys and threw them all away

Does it feel better
Do you feel good
Nobody's laughing
Everybody
Watch you drown
Slowly down you the bottom
Watch you drown
Saw you turn and throw yourself away

Run take one way ride
The easy way destroy the future
Burn all the bridges down
Stare at the barrel
Took the keys and threw them all away

Does it feel better
Do you feel good
Nobody's laughing
Everybody
Watch you drown
Slowly down you the bottom
Watch you drown
Saw you turn and throw yourself away
