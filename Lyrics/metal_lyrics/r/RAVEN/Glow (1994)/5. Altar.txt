Nowhere is a place you've left behind
Somewhere is where you're going to be in time
Lying to yourself will always get results
Laughing at the truth embracing the insults

Everyone crawl on their knees
Like moths to the flame
You're mesmerized on your way
To the altar, this way to the altar
The altar of lies

Winning the only thing the ultimate
Take with open arms the keys to seal your fate
Each line every word rehearsed and polished bright
Swear to anything just to win the fight

Everyone crawl on their knees
Like moths to the flame
You're mesmerized on your way
To the altar, this way to the altar

Take up the challenge step into the ring
Take all that theyâre giving
Up know it doesn't mean a thing
When you're in the hot seat
When your world is overturned
They'll be there to watch you burn

Winning the only thing the ultimate
Take with open arms the keys to seal your fate

Everyone crawl on their knees
Like moths to the flame
You're mesmerized on your way
On your way, on your way
To the altar, to the altar, the altar of lies
