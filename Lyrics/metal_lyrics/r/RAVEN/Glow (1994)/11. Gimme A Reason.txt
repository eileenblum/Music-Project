You take the money with your left hand
And then you spend it with the right
You might as well be setting it alight

You took the motor turned it to a wreck
Bought enough rope to put around your neck

Just gimme a reason to listen to you
Just gimme a reason I'll know what to do
Why should I believe what you're saying is true

Itâs like you're talking on a knife edge
But you'll never make it through
Why don't go and buy yourself a clue

You want a free ride to the end zone
You'll be a winner any day
A winner? Yeah, right!

Just gimme a reason to listen to you
Just gimme a reason I'll know what to do
Why should I believe what you're saying is true

Think you're acting like a big shot
Instead you're acting like a clown
Shooting high but you're going down
No matter what happens from now on
I'll never really understand
What the hell were we thinking

Just gimme a reason to listen to you
Just gimme a reason I'll know what to do
Why should I believe what you're saying is true
