Place your head under the hammer
Hold your throat under the blade
Close your eyes and you will see
You'll turn over everything to me

You may be rich you may be strong
And you'll believe that I can do no wrong
But in the end you'll realize

Just another victim
Just another fool

Know it makes no difference what you do or say
You're never going to see the light of day

Write you name in blood on the paper
Such a future in store for you
Close your mind the doors will open
Too far gone now to turn around

You know they're got you on the run
Still you're not listening to anyone
But in the end you'll realize

Just another victim
Just another fool

Know it makes no difference what you do or say
You're never going to see the light of day

Place your head under the hammer
Hold your throat under the blade
Close your eyes and you will see
You'll turn over everything to me

You know they're got you on the run
Still you're not listening to anyone
But in the end you'll realize

Just another victim
Just another fool
Just another victim
And we will reap what we have sown
