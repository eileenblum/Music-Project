Hiding the bruises
Never talking out of turn
He keeps on pushing
Why will she never learn

The bigger they are harder you fall
See you smiling
But your backs against the wall
Lets you go but you're never free
There's always the danger he'll snap
And turns on you

Dazed and so very lost
If you stay you must count the cost
Fairy tale turns into nightmare
Itâs going to happen again

The bigger they are harder you fall
Take you and break you
Just so he can watch you crawl
No remorse and there's no recall
And always the danger he'll snap
And turn on you
