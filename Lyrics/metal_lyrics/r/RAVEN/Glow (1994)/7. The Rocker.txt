[originally by Thin Lizzy]I am your main man if you're looking for trouble 
I'll take no lip 'cause no ones tougher than me 
If I kicked your face you'd soon be seeing double 
Hey little girl, keep your hands off me 'cause 

I'm a rocker 
I'm a rocker! 
I'm a roller too, baby 
I'm a rocker! 

Down at the juke joint me and the boys were stompin' 
Bippin' an a boppin', telling a dirty joke or two 
In walked this chick and I knew she was up to something 
I kissed her right there out of the blue 

I said 
I'm a rocker 
I'm a rocker! 
I'm a roller too, baby 
I'm a rocker!
