Take the sound from the fury
The light from eyes
Give me time to remember
To forget my disguise
All the doors I have opened
Slam in my face
Give me strength to still win the race

Far and wide, deep inside
One thing for sure I know
In the end, can't pretend
Without you there's nowhere to go

Build me up when I'm broken
Keep me out of the rain
Give me time to recover
Get away from my pain
After so long itâs found me
Pulled me so deep
After all that has happened
This time I won't sleep

Far and wide, deep inside
One thing for sure I know
In the end, can't pretend
Without you there's nowhere to go

Build me up when I'm broken
Keep me out of the rain
Give me time to recover
Get out of my way

Far and wide, deep inside
One thing for sure I know
In the end, can't pretend
Without you there's nowhere to go
