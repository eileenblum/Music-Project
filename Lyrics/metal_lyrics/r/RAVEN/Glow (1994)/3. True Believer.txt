Listen and keep your mouth shut
Time to cut your ties
Something I'm going to give you
Will open up your eyes
You need me to open up the doors
Someone to show it all
If I can I'll never let you see
Behind my wall

I'll make you - A true believer
I'll take you - Up to the top
I'll make you - A true believer
Pull together and we'll never stop

Make it tough to make you hungry
What you save I'm going to spend
You'll get me up the ladder
So I can bleed you 'til the end
Don't question what I'm doing
Don't think that I'm not on the ball
I'll rise up but you will fall

Take from your treadmill
Set you onto mine
Difference is you'll burn out
You'll never see the signs

I'll make you - A true believer
I'll take you - Up to the top
I'll make you - A true believer
Pull together and we'll never stop

Makes no difference
There's nothing you can do
What you don't see
All for one and all for me

I'll make you - A true believer
I'll take you - Up to the top
I'll make you - A true believer
Pull together and we'll never stop
