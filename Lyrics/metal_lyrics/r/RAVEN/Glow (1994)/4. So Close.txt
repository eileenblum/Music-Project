Take the time to see what done
Realize I've fought
But never really won
Long time since I made up my mind
To leave it all behind

So close and so far away
I needed to go my own way
You tried but there was something in me that died
So close and so far away

Try to see the good not bad
Let it slip away
Something that I never had
And if the chance came to do it all again
You know that nothing changes

So close and so far away
I needed to go my own way
You tried but there was something in me that died
So close and so far away

It took so long
To realize what was wrong
To see the way ahead

So close and so far away
I needed to go my own way
You tried but there was something in me that died
So close and so far away
