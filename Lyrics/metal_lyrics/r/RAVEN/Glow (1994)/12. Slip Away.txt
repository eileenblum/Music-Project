Running headlong dead-end street
Sinking slowly in too deep
Falling faster almost out of sight
Getting harder just to see the light

Something lies in wait for me
Hear it coming but I cannot see
Feel it tearing me apart

Question burning in my brain
Hold the answer but it won't remain
Play for time but there's nothing left
Second guessing myself to death

I can't believe
That you would curl up and die
I can't believe
That you would cut every tie
I can't believe - there's nothing I can say
I can't believe - that you would let go
Let go
Let go
And let slip away

And you say that I don't have to stay
But he pain in your eyes gives you away
And you're talking so tough
But I hear the words
You're going to throw it all away

I can't believe
That you would curl up and die
I can't believe
That you would cut every tie
I can't believe - there's nothing I can say
I can't believe - that you would let go
Let go
Let go
And let slip away
