Untouchable, intractable
Completely in command
Your word is law
And no-one here
Has dared to make a stand

Surround yourself with your own kind
Cast out the other fools
Corruption sets the currency
And violence sets the rules

You think you got me

I`m gonna stay free
I just don`t want to be
Part of the machine - machine

Heretics, unbelievers
Excommunicate
Disagree and raise your voice
And you will seal your fate
But I will take no more of you
Your parasitic world
I`ll make you fall by your own hand
There`ll be no need for future plans
