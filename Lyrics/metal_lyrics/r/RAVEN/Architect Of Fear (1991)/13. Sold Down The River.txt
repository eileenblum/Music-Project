Running from the future
Hiding in today
Consequences obvious
But no-one`s getting in your way

Sold me down the river
Take a look and see
Sold me down the river
There`s nothing left for me

Slash and burn your birthright
Building to destroy
Going on a one-way ride
It`s self-inflicted genocide

Sold me down the river
Take a look and see
Sold me down the river
There`s nothing left for me

Who wants the world ?
Take a good hard look around you

Buried in your wasteland
Chocking on your air
No deposit, no return
No solution - do you care ?
Sold me down the river
Take a look and see
Sold me down the river
There`s nothing left for me
