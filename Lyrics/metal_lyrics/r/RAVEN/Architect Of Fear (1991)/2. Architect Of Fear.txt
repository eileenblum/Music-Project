Lord forgive me I know not what to do
You stand there mocking me
You don`t know what I`ve been through
Get up, get out
You hear the sound
You see the light
Don`t you know the end`s in sight

Riding apart your future past will disappear
Destroyer of your hopes you stand before the
Architect of fear
The architect of fear

Pain/pleasure - you`re not fooling me
Your agony is like an open book and you belong to me
Shut up, sit down
And wait, your turn
You give, we take
There`s no forgiving your mistake

Riding apart your future past will disappear
Destroyer of your hopes you stand before the
Architect of fear
The architect of fear
Riding apart your future past will disappear
Destroyer of your hopes the architect of fear

All your words of wisdom fall on stony ground
Said you`d lead the faithful and make them realise
But you lied

Trusted you implicitly, every word and deed
Said that you`d unburden me and make them realise
But you lied

Raw power, tears into my soul
You stand there mocking me
Obliteration is your goal

Riding apart your future past will disappear
Destroyer of your hopes the architect of fear

Riding apart your future past will disappear
Destroyer of your hopes you stand before
The architect of fear
