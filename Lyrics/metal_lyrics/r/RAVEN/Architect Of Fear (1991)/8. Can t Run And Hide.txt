You want satisfaction
You want to make a deal
Waste your life 
Living in a world that`s totally unreal

You - you can run but can`t hide
You - you can`t run and hide
Run and hide

Now you`re on the street
Taking it day by day
Using every angle
But no-one believes a word you say

You - you can run but can`t hide
You - you can`t run and hide
Run and hide

Catch yourself falling
Deep in the crack
Hunger is calling
Twisting the knive
In your back
