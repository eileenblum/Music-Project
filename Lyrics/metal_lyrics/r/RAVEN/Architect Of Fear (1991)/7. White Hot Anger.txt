At the sound of the hell
In the space of a heartbeat
There`s no telling why
Reinforcing the point
Slowly sharpen the razor

Edge of night is falling
Answers will be found
Without warning

Losing my cohesion, control slips away
Retribution - judgement day

White hot anger, white hot anger
Tearing me up, ripping my heart
Burning

Think the end is at hand, got the future all planned
There`s no turning, denying the truth
Inch by inch, one by one, soon they all will be gone

Edge of night is falling
Answers will be found
Without warning

Gaining domination, losing sanity
Violence burns inside of me

White hot anger, white hot anger
Tearing me up, ripping my heart
Burning

No explanation
Your realisation
My destination
To let you survive my attack

White hot anger, white hot anger
Tearing me up, ripping my heart
Burning
