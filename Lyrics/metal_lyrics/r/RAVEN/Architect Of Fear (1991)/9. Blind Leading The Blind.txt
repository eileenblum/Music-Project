On the border between ignorance and fear
Cross the thin red line
Threaten everything that we hold dear

All for the good of the human race
Everybody`s got to be put in their place
Why should we listen
Why should we listen to the

Blind leading the blind
Closing their minds
Leaving us over the edge
Blind leading the blind
Closing their minds
Leading us into nowhere

On a deadline to strip away the prize
No turn unstoned
Won`t you open up those jaundiced eyes
All for the good of the human race
Torture with a savage grace
Why should we listen
Why should we listen to the

Blind leading the blind
Closing their minds
Leaving us over the edge
Blind leading the blind
Closing their minds
Leading us into nowhere

On a deadline to strip away the prize
Cross the thin red line
And we`ll have nothing left except your lies
