Power, glory, you had it all
One of the people and you answered the call
Don?t try to tell you didn`t know
If you had any guts you`d get the hell up and go

Rising power takes you to the top
Rising power no way that you`re gonna stop

Heart attack
One way ticket going on the rack
Heart attack

Caught in the act, a real surprise
They know the truth, the camera never lies
You say entrapment, I know the game
You think you`re right but you`re completely insane

Rising power takes you to the top
Rising power no way that you`re gonna stop

Heart attack
One way ticket going on the rack
Heart attack

Rising power takes you to the top
Rising power no way that you`re gonna stop

Heart attack
One way ticket going on the rack
Heart attack
