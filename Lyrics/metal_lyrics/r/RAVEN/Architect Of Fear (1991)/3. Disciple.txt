Come to my side, give me your hand
It`s time that you entered our world
The power we hold, for you will unfold
As long as we keep you alive

Just pledge alliegance
And keep the faith

Kneel and pray

Blood of my blood, flesh of my flesh
We are now one and the same
Live by the sword, you`ll die by the sword
Nothing of you will remain

Just pledge alliegance
Never forget

Bleeding - your life
Stealing - your future
Robbing - you blind
You cannot see

Take what was yours, make this thing mine
Banish your memory today
Holding the torch, wielding the axe
No-one can stand in our way

To make my future
I kill the past
