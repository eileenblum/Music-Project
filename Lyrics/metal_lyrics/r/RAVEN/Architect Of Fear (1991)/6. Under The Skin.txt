Think you got the answer, all in black and white
Insulate and segregate the darkness from the light
Take a look around you
Think you got it right you got it wrong
Locked in a mask of pain
You say they`re all to blame
Never to break the chain
You know that we`re really all the same
Under the skin

Running from the future, living in the past
Iron grip is weakening how much longer can this last
Take a look around you
Power that you hold will disappear

Locked in a mask of pain
You say they`re all to blame
Never to break the chain
You know that we`re really all the same
Under the skin

What of your master plan
Strangled by your own hand
Man against brother man
You know that we`re really all the same
Under the skin
Under the skin

Crosses burning, no-one learning
There is no turning back
Tear down your kingdoms of anger and hatred
Your whole world is under attack
Perceptions are twisted, truth is resisted
Fighting to hold back the night
Bigotry and injustice
When are you gonna see the light

Locked in a mask of pain
You say they`re all to blame
Never to break the chain
You know that we`re really all the same
Under the skin
