Look in the mirror
Tell me do you like what you see
What you`ve done to your body and soul
All of the changes you put me through
Like a fool I was blinded
What can I do

No point running, no point hiding
Nowhere to go, you can`t run from yourself
No point crying, no point lying
Over and over again

Got the devil, got the devil inside you
Ain`t nothing that you can do
Got the devil, got the devil inside you

Look in the mirror, emptiness stares back
As cold recognition floods into your mind
All of the changes, I was so blind
I was running from myself, losing my mind

No point running, no point hiding
Nowhere to go, you can`t run from yourself
No point crying, no point lying
Over and over again

Got the devil, got the devil inside you
Ain`t nothing that you can do
Got the devil, got the devil inside you

I`m getting weaker, he`s getting stronger
Don`t know if I can hold on

No point running, no point hiding
Nowhere to go, you can`t run from yourself
No point crying, no point lying
Over and over again
