I grow weary of your words
To me their mysteries have been unfuried
Shadows closing in
Try to break out of the fight
Running from the light
Just let me go into the night
Let me get away from here
Just let me go into the night
Let me fly

Shattered hopes and broken dreams
Scattered on the shore
I don?t need you anymore
Leave you far behind

Just let me go into the night
Let me get away from here
Just let me go into the night
Let me fly

Shattered hopes and broken dreams
Scattered on the shore
I don?t need you anymore
Leave you far behind

Just let me go into the night
Let me get away from here
Just let me go into the night
Let me fly

Just let me go into the night
Let me fly
