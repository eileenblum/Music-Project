Woke up this morning - Wrong side of the bed
You and your fooling make me see red
I'm cut out as much as I can
You and your fooling made me a man

You're in for the kill
You're in for the kill whatever
Whoever you are, I just don't care
The fact that we met, You're gonna regret, baby
I got a chainsaw in my hand
And it's spinning round and round

My mama told me - stay clear of girls
All that they are after is diamond and pearls
I'm cut out as much as I can
You and your fooling made me a man

I am the cat, baby, you are the mouse
Lock all your windows and stay in the house
I'm going crazy, my fever is high
My time to live, Baby, your time to die

line up:
John Gallagher  - vocals &amp; bass
