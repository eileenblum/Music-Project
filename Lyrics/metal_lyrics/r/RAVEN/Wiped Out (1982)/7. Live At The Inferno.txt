Poison in the heart, thunder in the soul
Fighting with your own insanity
Living in the age of power
Living in the age of might
I am the way of the fight

Heavy metal mayhem
Let me hear the ther on that guitar
One more battle scar
The faces will glow, the army will grow
Into the fire and out, and we're blazing

Live at the Inferno

Look at me and listen, open up your eyes
Can you feel the trembling on the earth
We all do our best at failing the test
Black suits and bow ties won't rest

Burning blood and leather
Seven-fifty roaring through the crowd
Do you want it loud?
Tomorrow's today, You're wasting away
Into the fire and out, and we're blazing
