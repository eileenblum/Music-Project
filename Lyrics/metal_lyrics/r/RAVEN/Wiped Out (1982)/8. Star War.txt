Ten billion people look to the sky
Flooding their hearts with the tears that they cry
In the air is a nightmare threatening their lives
Painting the thunder with steel

Time to fly, shooting star
Into the black of the night
The world is in your hands
Star War
Is this the beginning of the end?

Into the fire and out from the cold
Reading the lines of the story that told us
To live and let live
Make no demands
Why do you come here and ruin our plans?

There is a race to be won
There is a race to be saved
The prayer is for the brave

Time to fly, shooting star
Into the black of the night
The world is in your hands
