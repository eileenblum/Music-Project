Race with the devil - on your marks, get set, go
Hell bent on getting to where I don't know
Leaving our sector, into the unknown
Now more than ever we are alone

Faster - Give it all you got
Faster - We can never stop
Faster than the speed of light

Blue shifted galaxies squeeze into view
A circular rainbow that we can smash through
Pushing to the limit, the overdrive screams
Taking us further than our wildest dreams

Over the limit, cacophony reigns
Crushed into oblivion, nothing remains
Just a hole in the fabric of space and time
Swallowing all of our screams
