Blazing is the sun over the horizon
Marching through the snow
Freezing to the core
Fighting back the pain, locked in mortal combat
Giving a path through a driving blizzard
Marking out a trail
Smashing the ice with muscle and hammer

To the limit, never stop
To the limit, to the top
Darkness calling, shadows fall
Hear me calling, hear my call

Fifteen thousand feet, danger all around us
Mother nature fights, will she ever rest
What is there to prove, climbing up a mountain
Why do we do it, Why do we suffer?
Just because it's there
Maybe we're crazy, maybe we're madmen

Man will never stop searching for a challenge
Standing here, above
Nowhere left to go
Reaching into space, Is this hell or heaven?
Never a day in the life of a sinner
Goes by without a cause
I'm on the top, I am a winner
