Good rocking is what I need
We're getting ready the fight
Tomorrow's just another day
Gonna set this town alight - tonight
People, they just don't understand
What it means to me
Look into my eyes, can't you realise
That it's a madman you see

Burning hot, the beams will shine
Lighting up the sky
Ripping at your heart and soul
It's a chain reaction
Never ending power is what we will supply
Hold back the fire, Then let it burn

Survival of the fittest
Is the name of the game
Come closer, let me see ya
You know we're all the same
Destruction on the faces
Of the new recruits
On your marks, are you ready?
We're gonna run with the devil
