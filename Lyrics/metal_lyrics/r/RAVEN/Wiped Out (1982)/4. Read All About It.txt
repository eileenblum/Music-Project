Multi-vehicle pile-up, wreckage everywhere
People stop and stare
Violent prison breakout, protests on the roof
Killer on the loose

Write it down, turn it round
Black and white, dynamite
Things we say, that we do
Is this true?
What's in the news?
READ ALL ABOUT IT

Dominated country, treating them like fools
Marshall law in rule
Working man he strikes out, never gets enough
Modern times are tough

What's the latest fashion, paper underwear
Do you really care?
Looking for the TV, what's in store tonight
Can't they get it right
