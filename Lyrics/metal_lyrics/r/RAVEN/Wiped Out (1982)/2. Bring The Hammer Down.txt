Stuck in this town, boy, you can't break free
The arm of the law giving you the third degree
Can't get no job to earn my pay
Gonna lose control by the end of the day

Heads are going to roll in this town tonight
Hear my blood boil, the end's in sight
With all your might - BRING THE HAMMER DOWN
Get out of my way - BRING THE HAMMER DOWN
Nail him to the ground - BRING THE HAMMER DOWN
We're not gonna break it if we ain't gonna take it

They think they're clever, thinking we're the fools
Those power crazy people with their iron rules
Kids on the street, looking for a fight
Listen to those sirens as they wail all through the night

They put me in the slammer, threw away the key
Crucified my body, killed the man in me
Hey, Mr Jailer, let me out I've done my time
The only future for me was a life of crime
