Get back you fools, I'm gonna take this one alive
You won't catch me, I have the will to survive

You threat, take care
Watch out, Bomb scare
No sleep tonight, You got to time it right

Hot sweat like rain, is driving into my eyes
You laugh at me, There's no way you can survive

Red, Black or white, I've got to time it right
Not much time, take it slow, Easy now, Don't let go
Tweezers pull, Keep your cool
No demands for shaking hands
