Man want fire, Man want power
Since time began
Always a hero, Always a rebel
With a gun in his hand

Fire power, Fire power
In the hands of a madman

Look out danger, here he comes
Wanna place your bets
Take your changes - wheel of fortune
Russian roulette

Shadows in the night
And he's coming after you

Fallen angel rides with the devil
Down in hell
Gone in body, Gone in spirit
Only time will tell

Smoking barrels tell the story
Take the power with the glory
Don't need brains, Don't need muscle
Crazy people deal in trouble
