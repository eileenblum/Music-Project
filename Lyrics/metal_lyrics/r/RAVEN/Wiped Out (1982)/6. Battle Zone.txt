Raging inferno, inside my head
Vision's hazy, driving me crazy
Senses are dead
You won't bring me down, Turn my head around
Fingers a-tingle, panic tonight
No time to worry what's going to happen
Time is right
You won't bring me down, Turn my head around

March through the battle zone
Lost inside this battle zone
Eye for an eye, life for a life
Danger, Danger, Danger, Danger

Call me a liar, deal me an ace
Dead or alive we can survive
Taking the race
You won't bring me down, Turn my head around
Too many people after my blood
Running for cover, trying to hide
But doing no good
You won't bring me down, Turn my head around

Look for someone, Where did it go
Tell me the month, tell me the day
I just don't know
You won't bring me down, Turn my head around
The more that I'm giving, the more that you take
Tell me an answer, show me a reason
Give me a break
You won't bring me down, Turn my head around
