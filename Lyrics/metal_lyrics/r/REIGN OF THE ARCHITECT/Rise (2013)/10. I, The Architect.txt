[Instrumental]I am a man
with the smiles of hyenas,
Delightful and shy
dazzling axes.
Tearing the tears of a jackal.

No serpent will slip through the grass
no herd will be fed on safe meadows
for serpents are nothing but arms
and meadows are throats and tongues, and the stars are my eyes-

and there is no greater evil than I,

the architect.
