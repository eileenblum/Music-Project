[Storyteller:]
It has been a month since that night
And no one knows his whereabouts
Her tender heart now twisted irrecoverably
To keep their secret shut

[The Girl:]
I keep hearing the echoes of my frailty
Never knowing what comes next
It haunts me over and over in my dreams
Ostensibly, my dying crest

[The Girl, The teacher &amp; Choir:]
There are no other explanations
Prevarication led to death
As we try to find some comfort
We only find ourselves

[Storyteller:]
Those secrets are never easy to keep
And doubt encloses her to an end
Little did she know about
A little boyâs revenge

[The Girl:]
Can I?
[The teacher:]
Can you?
[The girl &amp; The teacher:]
Keep a secret to yourself?

[The girl:]
I must be going insane
I canât recall the things heâs done
I donât deny the things Iâm being told,
But am I really just a pawn?
