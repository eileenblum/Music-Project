[Storyteller:]
That night we were searching a shoulder to cry on
Leaning heads on the shoulder of war
Silently letting our children go
(They go, they go, they go)
Watching the sparrows fly into the narrow ravine in the sky
Once we wished upon a star
Now weâre shooting stars at daylight

Up on a hill- a soldierâs dying word
âWhat is that in the fog?!â
His whisper then becomes a scream
The piper got himself some new machinery

[Soldiers:]
Bravo team to Alpha leader, target is on sight
Asking for permission to pursue the fight
Permission granted, Bravo team, green light, Get to go
Abort! Mission compromised! These bastards somehow know!

[The Architect:]
Armies will not stop me
I have won
When theyâll take one down
A thousand more will come
The stabs that once tore my back
Scarred into sheaths for daggers
Iâll avenge this blood of Cesar
You sheep in Brutusâ leather

[Storyteller:]
Look high above the clouds, beyond the human reach
Madly crafted aircrafts, diving into the breach
Speeding winged destroyers, black metallic wraiths
Bombing the horizon, diminishing our lives
Cities rattle loosely, as fragile as a glass
Shattering beneath the green flameâs power-lust

[Choir:]
It all seems so hopeless,
We cannot possibly overcome those foes
The enemyâs unstoppable
Mankindâs future remains unknown

[Soldiers:]
Fall back, regroup at delta HQ1
We must reconvene with headquarters, the damageâs done
We need to understand what weâre facing, we need another plan
I fear, my friends, that this war has just begun
Is that Headquarters? Did they answer our call?
The line is dead commander, the bombs began to fall
I fear weâre on the brink here; we need some backup, fast!
No military in history faced an enemy so vast

[The Architect:]
Sing me a song and Iâll tell you a story
A tale of a place I once knew
Where my future was young where Iâve sunk down my worries
A place where a Daffodil grew
And we wished to the stars
When we saw them get closer
And they took away breaths
And Iâll never return
Sing me a song so I could remember
How it is to be among friends again

[Choir:]
It all seems so hopeless,
We cannot possibly overcome those foes
The enemyâs unstoppable
Mankindâs future remains unknown
[Storyteller:]
This was just a bitter sweet endeavorâ¦
This was just a bitter sweet endeavorâ¦
Sing me a songâ¦
