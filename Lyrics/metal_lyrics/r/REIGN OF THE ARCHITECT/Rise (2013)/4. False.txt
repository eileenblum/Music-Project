[The Girl:]
A monster in a boyâs skin
How dare you come to me?
You wonât fool me twice
Iâll put an end to all your lies!

[The Architect:]
What are you speaking of?
Iâve done nothing wrong,
It was me, who was rejected,
Ran down, dried out and manipulated

I will pay the price,
Someone elseâs lies,
Wished I could belong here then
Now all I see is you
I tried to be much more then I could ever
Be with me donât flee from me
My love do you believe?

[Storyteller:]
Surrendering the mind,
Believing heathen gods
A mirror to our ugly kind

[The Girl:]
You leave me no choice, deeds wonât go undone
[The Architect:]
What are you talking about?
I told you before; I wonât say it again,
I wonât try to explain, I donât need to regain
Your trust anymore!
[The Girl:]
I canât get back the things you stole
You took advantage of me when I was out of control (you, out of control)

[The Teacher:]
All is fair in love and war
[Storyteller:]
And war the world will get,
Sheâs no Helen there was no Troy,
But soon her Troy will burn
[The Teacher &amp; The Storyteller:]
I thought I could achieve my goals,
But then I got obsessed,
Iâm (so) sick of chasing dreams,
Iâll hunt them down instead

[The Architect:]
I led no one astray, the accusations are blank
Like the light dissipating, Iâll be fading to black
No one to believe me, I could never do harm
Crossed by the one that I love
Itâs surreal!
[Storyteller:]
A lesson never meant to be learnt
As hard as the truth, in the lying of man
Itâs so real
[The Architect:]
Believe in a false, let dishonesty stain
I run away from you, as far as I can
