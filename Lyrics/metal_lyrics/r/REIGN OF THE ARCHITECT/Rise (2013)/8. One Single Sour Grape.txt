[Father:]
We heard no sighs, no signs of distress
Even as a child he was always caressed

Why should you blame yourself?
I had paid all of my debts,
With my own tired hands
I was there building a nest

This child fed on your sores
(All is gone)
Still you love him so
(On and on)
Onward he will go
(Our son is gone)
Leaving you alone
This ungrateful son of yours

Dim the lights in the window
Gone are the days we were home
At least weâre together
For all that I care he could never return

This child fed on your sores
(All is gone)
Still you love him so
(On and on)
Onward he will go
(Our son is gone)
Leaving you alone
This ungrateful son of yours
