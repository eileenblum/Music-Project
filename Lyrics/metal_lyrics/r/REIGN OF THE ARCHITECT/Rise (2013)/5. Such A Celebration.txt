[Storyteller:]
Itâs her prom night.
A night of love from the first sight
Of royal dresses and a carriage ride
A kiss to seal her lips of rouge

As she enters
She steals the stares of the dancers
A sudden fear turns against her
As if theyâd hurt her if they could

Sheâs heading fast towards a faster answer
Drunk queen of the night
No charming prince to make it better, elsewhere
Just one more sip of wine

[The Teacher &amp; The Storyteller:]
He was longing for the shores of your porch
Romeo gently took whatâs yours and refused to let go

[Choir:]
It was such a celebration
Night was yours and you were his
He threaded your strings of devastation
Used you like a puppeteer

[Storyteller:]
Her teacherâs whim
A dreamerâs scheme
Lies spread their wings and veil

Itâs her prom night
A night of love from the first sight
A night of naive dreams and endless lies
Who really kissed her lips of rouge?
