[Ruin:]
Pour the fuel for the war machines; Grease your weapons raw
An army of cloned splinters, a vast destructive claw
To cleave down all the impotence that man has sought to fake
This day, my proxy-brothers, an old manâs world we take
[Razor:]
These foundations are fragile, cannot be put to threat
Donât you dare, my brother, foil the plans weâve set

[Storyteller:]
And while the world kept turning, the architect arose
Conductor of the brutal symphony that he composed
The dawn upon a new age of a feral hateful scheme
A throne thatâs built from future graves and a crown of shattered dreams

[Razor:]
Break communications, set the traps we need
First we take the shoreline cities then, my lord, we puncture in
I want to see their leaders begging as they bleed
I want to tear their human hearts and flay their blotted skin
[Rapture:]
Donât forget my brother, you ambitious little fiend
This conflictâs resolution states that we will win

[Storyteller:]
And while the world kept turning, the architect arose
Conductor of the brutal symphony that he composed
The dawn upon a new age of a feral hateful scheme
A throne thatâs built from future graves and a crown of shattered dreams

[The Architect:]
Degenerating into the decadence of what I mustnât be
While the consequences of my decisions are deformed by these impious three
The uncertainty that broke my inflamed bones
Has now outgrown the boundaries of my private throne

[Rapture:]
Why you seem so lost, lord? Weâve just begun
Weâll thrive and cast a shadow over every rising sun
Our divisions all stand ready to savor victory
Let the green flame now engulf everything you see

[Storyteller:]
And while the world kept turning, the architect arose
Conductor of the brutal symphony that he composed
The dawn upon a new age of a feral hateful scheme
A throne thatâs built from future graves and a crown of shattered dreams

And while Iâm still breathing, the architect arose
The conductor of the brutal symphony that he composed
[The Architect:]
(Iâm still breathing; Iâm the conductor, shattered dreams)
The dawn upon a new age of somberness and rigor
[Storyteller:]
(He is still breathing; heâs the conductor; he is the architect)

[The Architect:]
The dawn upon a new age of somberness and rigor
A throne thatâs build from wasted youth and my vacant, shattered dreams
Iâm still breathing.
