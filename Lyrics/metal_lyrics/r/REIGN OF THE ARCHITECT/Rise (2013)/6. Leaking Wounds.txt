[The Architect:]
I canât remember how long
I kept running without purpose
I canât remember when
It started to rain again

It all seems blurry now
All my troubles, all my efforts
Smudged anger, clearness stained
And nothing is left to obtain

(I close my mind)
Itâs like to redefine forlorn
(Heartâs beating strong)
It raises all hatred and all scorn
(I bare this cross)
To be so left behind
(Became surreal)
How could these lies truncate lifeâs flow
(I close my mind)
I wonât become the things I hate
(Heartâs beating strong)
I wonât let my soul to deflorate
(I bare this cross)
To be confined
(Became surreal)
To the closure of the life I used to know

Feels like I ran for days
Soaked with rain, with tears and sweat
I just canât comprehend
Whatâs been done to me

So this is how it truly feels
How they soften this rigid fate
How reality became surreal
And changed everything I used to be

(I close my mind)
Itâs like to redefine forlorn
(Heartâs beating strong)
It raises all hatred and all scorn
(I bare this cross)
To be so left behind
(Became surreal)
How could these lies truncate lifeâs flow
(I close my mind)
I wonât become the things I hate
(Heartâs beating strong)
I wonât let my soul to deflorate
(I bare this cross)
To be confined
(Became surreal)
To the closure of the life I used to know

Heartâs beating strong. Like a dozen hammers
I try to close my mind to vices and vile thoughts
If fate made me a monster, a monster I shall be
Am I to bare this cross alone or to untie the life I knot?

Now I understand
I was merely a pawn
Woven in a web of lies
And all the spiders have withdrawn

Just for a moment
I wish I could bestow
My wrath upon this world, a closure
To the life you used to know

(I close my mind)
Itâs like to redefine forlorn
(Heartâs beating strong)
It raises all hatred and all scorn
(I bare this cross)
To be so left behind
(Became surreal)
How could these lies truncate lifeâs flow
(I close my mind)
I wonât become the things I hate
(Heartâs beating strong)
I wonât let my soul to deflorate
(I bare this cross)
To be confined
(Became surreal)
To the closure of the life I used to know

And underneath a crying sky
When all emotions slowly die
And in this modern exile
I leave my hate a bigger room to grow
(I donât understand!)
What is this flickering white light?
What are those voices full with spite?
And as I avert my eyes
I bid farewell to the life I used to know
