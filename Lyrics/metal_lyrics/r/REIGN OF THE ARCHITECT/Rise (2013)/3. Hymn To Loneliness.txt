[The Architect:]
I wish I could start over, I wish I could ignore
The voice that led me astray
The aching in my heart, my soul is empty and torn apart
Yet all I care is this, will she love me someday?

[The Teacher:]
Donât you let her distant words get through your shell
[The Architect:]
Itâs all too little and much too late
[The Teacher:]
Come forth tribulation, donât you dwell
Let me soften this wretched fate

Donât let these words get through your shell
Shed this boyâs skin, become a man
Come forth emerging passion; give in to its charms
Welcome these embracing, yearning arms

This desireâs incomplete
And fell onto this world
[The Teacher &amp; The Architect:]
A song left unsung, at the top of my lungs
[The Teacher:]
With no answers
I will never admit

[The Teacher &amp; The Architect:]
These venomous throes of rejection
But I feel, if I must, as this lust turns to dust
Torn asunder

[Choir:]
We weave a web of silky spins
Old Samsonâs hair grows gray and thin
No guiding hand, our journey ends
Before it begins
The wolves that prey our loversâ bed
The howls disguised as serenades
Our sharpened teeth, that yearn to taste
It all turns to sand

[Storyteller:]
Nomads had often sung
Of heroesâ tragic passion
And despite the modern age
They will sing once more
Still in our dreams, faces
Are kissing us sweet and precious
An ever missing goddamn cupid Yet
Lets us die aloneâ¦
