[Storyteller:]
Forsaken for a month, like a ship lost at sea
Climbed up from the tranches of his worst fears
Dragged unnoticed undetected sheltered from the sun
No light can reach the surface, the past canât be undone

[The Architect:]
Of all that have set,
Iâve made you three
For all that will rise
Please forgive me

[Storyteller:]
Looking into a shattered mirror
His destiny resolved
Erupts out of his interiors
The master-plan unfolds
Haunted by 3 different voices
He shed them into life
3 Splints of former self
The rising tide

[Razor:]
Welcome to a world of hate, weâll make sure you feel at home
[Rapture:]
Forget your past mistakes, let go of all youâve known
[Ruin:]
Just point the right direction and nothing will remain
[The Architect:]
Who are you three figures? Who am I to reign?

[Razor:]
We are the first three splinters, mere servants to you, lord.
[Ruin:]
We make sure your wishes are granted, and your enemies destroyed
[Rapture:]
Weâre here to give advice, to consult and comfort
[The Architect:]
Who am I to set the world ablaze? Is this what I want?

[Storyteller:]
The three misbegotten characters pulled him out of his state
In the dark of night they slithered and shed light unto this fate
One to endure in darkness, to ensure the rain will last
As the old turns to sorrow, tomorrow will turn into dust

Looking into a shattered mirror
His destiny resolved
Erupts out of his interiors
The master-plan unfolds
Haunted by 3 different voices
He shed them into life
3 Splints of former self
The rising tide
