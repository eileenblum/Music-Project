[The President:]
Again I hear those drums of war
Reciting a million tragedies.
The sky began to fall,
Our luck had changed its course
Into the shape of threnody.
And as we flogged a dying horse
They will flog humanity.
The judge has no remorseâ¦

[The Architect:]
Paint the doorpost with your own blood
Your wrists are many, but Iâm afraid that I canât get enough.
Compared to you I had no name
But I will overcome your fame
You had your empire, but this time
Itâs your guts, my glory.

[The President:]
Generals,
Where is our god?
I need his guidance.

[Ministers and generals choir:]
Heâd forsaken his herd
You need to form a (You need to form a better plan)
For defense
For revenge
Now you have
One last chance
You must save
Us all!

[The President:]
Twilight
Weâll strike at dusk,
Like a thousand sunsets!
Our final breath!!

[Ministers and generals choir:]
Weâll turn our backs on fate
We wonât be subjugated â No!
[The President:]
Retaliation will be hard
[Generals &amp; The President:]
Even if it means, we will exist no more!
As one we will storm into the storm!
[The President:]
So long, our loving home!
Fighting with all that weâve got!
[Generals &amp; The President:]
Weâll shed every blood
[The President:]
This is our dying day, our bloody dawn!

[The Architect:]
Man had worshipped the gun
Sniffed its powder, kissed the feet of war
Now itâs time for the cannons
To return a favor!

[The President:]
Get ready loyal men!
This is the point of no return!
To the end! To the death! To our own page in this miserable book!
Retaliation will be harsh!!!

[Ministers and generals choir:]
We must retaliate!
