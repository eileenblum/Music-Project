[The Architect:]
This is futile, hapless effort to reach anotherâs heart
Knot I canât untie, puzzle I canât solve

[Choir:]
Watching from afar, Distant as the stars
[The Architect:]
As all sentiments but the longing dissolve

[Storyteller :]
This was just a bitter sweet endeavor
[Storyteller &amp; The Architect:]
A girl chased by a boy, a boy chasing a dream
Acerbic taste of youth is swinging into whole
As my teenage hopes and wishes drown into a stream

[The Girl &amp; The Architect:]
âWe never really had that sort of true connectionâ
How come I never had a say, never had a say in games we played?
âIt didnât have to come to this, it wasnât my intentionâ

[The Architect:]
One vague smile from her and I saw the world begin to fade

[Storyteller:]
Darkness fell; heâs finally opened its eyes
Rejection, despair, woe and compromise
Gazing on a pale horizon with vision unclear
The last hint of light is fading away
Casting shade that rolls over the sundialâs face

[The Architect:]
Weâre lost in our lives like rats in a maze
Our feelings are smothered by indifferent haze
Our worldâs so hectic, chaotic, unjust
We might find a shelter though the shelter wonâ last

[The Architect &amp; Choir:]
Those are the feelings that hold us together
A thought that crosses us as theyâre conducting the theme
Acidic taste of loneliness is blistering our tongues
The things that make us human make us scream

[The Architect:]
âWe never really had that sort of true connectionâ
I feel like I succumb, I shuffle back and I restart
âIt didnât have to come to this, it wasnât my intentionâ
She smiled indifferently but with a different heart
