[The Architect:]
The morning dew is almost here
To quench my thirst for a new dawn
I drink alone the nightâs last tears
But then I see a setting sun
Who are you strangers looking down my soul?

[Antecedents:]
We are your forefathers, exiles from beyond
We came to complete what must be done
We traveled far and crossed a thousand suns
We are the ones who gave mankind its crown

[The Architect:]
What does this mean?
It canât be happening to me, itâs not real
[Antecedents:]
Reality, oneâs pitiful observation
The truth for what you see before you is not bestowed in ancient lore

[Storyteller:]
He will quickly go back a million years in time
All the cosmic knowledge will be embedded into his mind
As history seems clear, mankindâs vast decline
Love and hate and all human feelings, now a song without a rhyme
Fragile is the human heart, impulsive when resigned
So they plant the seeds of hate with his wrath to intertwine

[The Architect:]
So you want me to pass judgment upon the human race,
To execute, chase and pursuit, in military pace?

[Antecedents:]
We are your forefathers, exiles from beyond
We came to complete what must be done
We traveled far and crossed a thousand suns
We are the ones who gave mankind its crown

[Storyteller:]
The Morning dew is almost here
Itâs the beginning of a new dawn
Few are the swords, gone are the seers
No one can stop their chosen one

âAs we return home, back to where weâve left
Nothing changed but mankindâs coming fateâ
