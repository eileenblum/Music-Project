[Music by Riverside, Lyrics by Mariusz Duda]

I need a place where I can belong
This alternate world is not my home
I suffocate here

The hollow laughs of the hollow men
Embarrassing Carnival Parade
Can't stand more lights!

I don't care if those times are over
I'm not going to live like everyone
I don't care if those times are over
My future is living in the past

I feel like the touchstone
In a river of wounded hearts
What happened to our days
They used to be so full of life
In a different way

Used to be so easy
Used to be so good between us
Words had a different meaning
The simple things were significant

I don't care if those times are over
I'm not going to live like everyone
I don't care if those times are over
My future is living in the past

Even clowns don't scare me anymore
