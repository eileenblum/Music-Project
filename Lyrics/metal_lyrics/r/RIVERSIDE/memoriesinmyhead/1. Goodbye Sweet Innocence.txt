[Music by Riverside, Lyrics by Mariusz Duda]

I'm covered in dust
Lying next to you
Waiting for my judgement day
Feel the warmth of the hearth
Your kiss of destiny
Cure for pain and misery

When something ends
Something else begins
We are moving on

Life happened to us
We are not the same
But we've managed to survive
Stuck at the crossroads of time
Between future and past
Diverse worlds under the same sky

And when something ends
Something else begins
So let me silently fade away
Forget us in the flame

I know it hurts
The sky has fallen down
I know it hurts
Flowers have died back
I know it hurts
But look at the sun
It's about to rise again

Cause when something ends
Something else begins
So let me silently fade away
Forget us in the flame
