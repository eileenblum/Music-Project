Close your eyes
Don't be afraid
I'm with you
This place is safe
We found a camp
We have supplies
They will let us stay the night

Close your eyes
I'll tuck you in
Mum will sing
To make you sleep
Don't mind the noise
They're just the bombs
A part of music for this song

When the night
Begins to fall
You and I
In a safety zone
The former world
Shall not return
But we'll survive intact
Again
