[Part I - Where Are We Now?]

I'm your lie
I am your pretending
I'm the cause
Of your shame and anger
I'm your crime
Swept under the carpet
Your vanity
With all consequences

Living a distorted day
Distorted life
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?
Living in a fallen land
With fallen minds
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?
What have we done?

I'm your sloth
I am your aversion
Intolerance
I'm your private wasteland

Living a distorted day
Distorted life
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?
Living in a fallen land
With fallen minds
In an uncertain place without the sun
Where are we now?

Living a distorted day
Distorted life
In an uncertain place without the sun

Where are we now?
What have we done?
Where are we now?
Who have we become?

[Part II - Dancing Ghosts]

We've been waiting for brighter days
How could we've known we were happy?

Dancing ghosts
Singing ghosts

Where are we now?

Dancing ghosts
Singing ghosts
