Day outside grows black
I lie faceup in my shell
Squeeze my eyes shut
And feel like falling into blank space

Had allowed that life to drift
For Iâve chosen a different trail
When light fades
I feel like falling into blank space

So you realized
Ingested real life
Grew up in the time of
Pushing through the crowds
So you realized
Chose unreal life
Settled in the mobile
Handy pocket size

Wanted to be your light
Illuminate your smiles
Wanted to be your cure
Bridge between self and us
Wanted to be your prayer
Wipe the tears from your eyes
But I turned my back

Could have been a tree of dawn
Rooted deeply in the ground
Bearing fruits
Far away from falling into blank space

But I took refuge from myself
In the crowded solitude
Now I dash
And feel like falling into blank space

Wanted to be your light
Illuminate your smiles
Wanted to be your cure
Bridge between self and us
Wanted to be your prayer
Wipe the tears from your eyes
But I turned my back
Got lost inside
