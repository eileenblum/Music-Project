When I scroll back through our recent days
I try to understand
How we could forget
We made a promise to one another
That nothing would ever break what we had
Now we never talk when we fall apart
We never talk when we fall apart
We pretend weâre ok
Surrounding ourselves with one-way friendships
And so-called friends

I know we got used to new us
And I donât want to be there
I donât want to be there
Where we are
I know we got used to new life
And I donât want to be there
No, I donât want to be there
Where we are

Silence fallen between
All the doors are locked
All the words unsaid
And weâre still afraid of time
Started to keep ourselves
At a distance that we could control
Not too close
Not too far
Now we never talk when we fall apart
We just never talk when we fall apart
We pretend weâre ok
By filling up our inner space
With little hates
And so-called love

I know we got used to new us
And I donât want to be there
I donât want to be there
Where we are
I know we got used to new life
And I donât want to be there
No, I donât want to be there
Where we are

So walk away with me
