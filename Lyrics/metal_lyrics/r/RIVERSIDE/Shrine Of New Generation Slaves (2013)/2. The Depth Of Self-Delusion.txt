I could be foreign forever
To your otherland
I could be foreign forevermore
To your promiseland
One life was great
But anotherâ¦
No, I donât want to live on the edge
I wonât follow you
I found my own
I will stay

I could be foreign forever
To your hastenland
I could be foreign forevermore
To your neverland
One little brick then another
And I will build that wall anyway
You can find me there
Rested and calm
Without mask
This is where I will stay

Look around where we are
Who we are
What we always want
Twenty four
Seven
Three sixty five
Sometimes little more
I was chasing your shadow
Not knowing
Iâd become your slave

I could be foreign forever
To your otherland
I could be foreign forevermore
To your promiseland
One life was great
But anotherâ¦
No, I donât want to live on the edge
I wonât follow you
I found my own
I will stay
I could stay forevermore

I've said a farewell
To never-ending smiles
I did not look good in red
From my place I can finally see
How much of this shade I called myself
Was me
And what was left behind
