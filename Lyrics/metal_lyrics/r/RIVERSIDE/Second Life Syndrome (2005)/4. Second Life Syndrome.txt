[Part One - From Hand To Mouth]

From day to day
From hand to mouth
We're turning around
Vicious ritual
Getting used to it all
Falling down again
We're waiting for
The decrees of providence
I don't want to waste
Any more of my life
Live from day to day
Live from hand to mouth
Facing the light
I brush aside your plans
I'm going to have
It all my own way
And when that all shattered I felt I'd broken my fall
Couldn't pretend that I felt strong about us anymore
Without your help I finally started to live my own life
I just want you to know this time

[Part Two - Secret Exhibition]

I just want to feel your sigh on my neck
Want to feel your breath
Feel your need to stay
You don't know my name
Don't know my face
Only thoughts I share in my secret place
Secret exhibition
Cure for loneliness
I've ground to a halt
There's no turning back
You know there are things I just can't forget
You've helped me so much
To learn to be detached
But when that all shattered I felt I'd broken my fall
Couldn't pretend that I felt strong about us anymore
Without that help I finally started to live my own life
And I know I don't need you now
Secret exhibition
Cure for loneliness
Life is much too short to be whiled away with tears
Secret exhibition
Cure for loneliness
I erase you now
I don't need you now
I erase you now with all of my past
