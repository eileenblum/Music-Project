Hi my friend
Shake my hand
Tell your lie
With your artificial smile
Don't be mad
I just want to help you
To say these words out loud
I don't like you cause they like you
I hate you cause they love you
I wish you ill cause they wish you well
I'm so happy when they f you
Strike a blow
For my fall
Crush me down
And just say these words out loud
I don't like you cause they like you
I hate you cause they love you
I wish you ill cause they wish you well
I'm so happy when they f you
And this is what we do
And this is who we are
Why don't you want to stop
You always see my life up against your life
I don't like you cause they like you
I hate you cause they love you
I wish you ill cause they wish you well
I'm so happy when they f you
Tell me your lie!!!
