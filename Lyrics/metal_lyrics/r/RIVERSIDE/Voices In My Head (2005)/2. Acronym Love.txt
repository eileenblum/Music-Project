This is harder then I thought it would be
Being there in my prozac dreams
Saw your beauty and I kept in mind
Imagine your smell and touch
Imagine all of us

I'm sure we want to find our place
We're alone inside - that'll never change

GD &amp; R time (Grinnin', Duckin' &amp; Runnin' time)
FITB (Fill In The Blanks)
FWIW (For What It's Worth)
FUBAR (Fouled Up Beyond All Repair)
ICOCBW (I Could Of Course Be Wrong)
ICOCBB (I Could Of Course Be Blind)

I'm sure we want to find our place
We're alone inside - that'll never change

This is harder then I thought it would be
I'm still here in my prozac dreams
Seeing your beauty
Keeping all in mind
No chance to survive
My Love
Goodbye
