Hello Rainbow Box
Need you to survive

White is for my health
Blue for happiness
Thanks to Red I die and live
With a shade of smile on my face

Alpha waves appeared
I've crossed a line
Sea of memories
Feel I'm going down

Achromatic day
Got choked by colored pills
I thought that I could
But the icy water closed over me

You know
Want to feel alive
Need you more
Anytime

You know
Want to feel alive
Need you more
Anytime
