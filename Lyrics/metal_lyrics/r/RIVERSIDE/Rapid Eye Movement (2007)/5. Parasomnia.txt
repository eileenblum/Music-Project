Lying here on the floor
Starting to come around
What you did Mr. Hyde
What you got me into this time

There's blood on my hands
Emptiness in my mind
I don't remember my name
Don't recall who I am

What's wrong with me now
I'm shying from the light
I start to realize
Feel I'm falling down
Every inch of my skin
Feel the pain I saw
The self, I was running away from, just back!

Lost the light of day
Lost my picture of you
This nightmare I was afraid of
Just becoming the truth

Oh no
What have I done
Can't just put it all behind me
Can't afford to lose my mind

Oh no
What have I done
You don't know how much I need to
Find a way to bring you back

Lying here on the floor
Starting to come around
What you did Mr. Hyde
What you got me into this time

Drugged from sleep
In front of the mirror
Shrugging off the darkest fear
Keep asking myself the same question
When did I turn to this side of me
When did I turn to this side

I need to find a way
To bring you back again
