In a mood like this
Don't want to pull away from you
Don't want to hurt you
Shut you out
Or push you away

In the mood like this
I want some place that is just mine
And nobody else's
Just mine

Complete indifference
TV life instead of talk
We're drifting apart
Lip reading
And so distant now

I miss what we had
I miss someplace that was just mine
And nobody else's
Just mine
Place for me to hide
Inside of me

For you
I will be
For you
I will escape again
Want to see in your eyes
That you want us back
That there's hope for us
