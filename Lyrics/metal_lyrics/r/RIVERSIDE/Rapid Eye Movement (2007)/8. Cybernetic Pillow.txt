Last time I made you up
You looked so bright
I was about to believe in angels

Searching my lucid dream
Came up against
Pictures of your imagination

Feel the pain
Feel the pain

I am looking for you now
Somewhere far off in my mind
I wish you told me everything
There is no way I can get around that
But if this is only a dream

Does it follow
One day must we wake up?
But if this is only a dream
Soon I'm cold

I feel no pain
I feel no pain

But if this is only a dream
Does it follow
One day must we wake up?
But if this is only a dream
I can just
Soon I'm cold

[Guitar Solo]

Soon I'm cold
Last time I made you up
You looked so bright
I was about to believe in angels
