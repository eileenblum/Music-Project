Even if I had my life to live (over again)
Even if I had my life to live (over again)
I would keep coming back to the same place
Waiting on the shore for me to return [x2]

I'm nourished by
Your day's residues
Seeing through the veil
Unclose your mind

I'm the reflection of
All your waking lives
Narcoleptic sins
Unclose your mind

In the depth of my
Can control your life
With your shell around
Unclose your mind

I'm your amber light
Way of passing time
Movement of your eye
(Incoherent chant)

I'm your better life
Hidden desire
Never Neverland
Unclose your mind

We could be so good
Broken looking-glass
So much left unsaid

Fearless on top
Fearland at heart [x7]

[Incoherent chant]

And now you will be my soul mate
I am going to make you up again
It's OK now but I don't know how long it needs to last
Sooner or later I want you to come and get me out of here
Sooner or later I want you to come and get me
Sooner or later I will need you
Sooner or later

Closed inside
I have my life back
Trapped inside
I give my life back [x2]

[Incoherent chant]
