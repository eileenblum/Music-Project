One day we'll find our way
Straying from the road
We thought we could go
Until we would fade.

Traveling across the fallen earth
And the foreign lands
We survived
To believe that this is not the end
This is not the time

Moving unseen beyond
The shadows
Waiting for
The birth of a star we can follow

One day we'll find our time
Come to realize
That our history
Came full circle

Traveling across all the dried up seas
And the foreign lands
We survived
To believe that this is not the end
This is not the time

We crane our necks for youth
We know weâll make it through
And we can go back to the forest

Letâs go back to the world
That was 30 years ago
And letâs believe this is our time
