I feel I have to share
What I do
Or where I am
Thereâs an urge within
I canât ignore

Hashtag me and go
Iâm addicted to your love
Iâm addicted to my aimless drive

Thereâs a mask upon my face
I canât live without
So you wonât recognize me
When I am in the crowd
I lost my calmness in the world
Where everything is searchable

Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out

I donât have my place
Iâm in here and everywhere
Just another day in hd frame

So hashtag me and go
Cause Iâm addicted to your love
Iâm afraid
Youâre the only friend Iâve got

Thereâs a mask upon my face
I canât live without
So you wonât recognize me
When I am in the crowd
I lost my calmness in the world
Where everything is searchable

Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out
Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out

Hashtag me and go
Cause Iâm addicted to your love

I lost my calmness in the world
Where everything is searchable

Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out
Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out
