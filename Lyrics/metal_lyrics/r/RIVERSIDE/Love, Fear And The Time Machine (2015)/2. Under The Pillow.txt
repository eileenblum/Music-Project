Hey you,
Somewhere in the mirror
What happened today with your face
Your eyes
Sank in their hollows
And the ocean of your disgrace

Itâs no shame
You havenât done what you were supposed to
And did what you didnât want to
1-UP!
The amount of self-deception
Slowly starts killing you
Inside

Youâre faced
With a new decision
Between the dawn and the day
Melting
Between the life you got used to
And something you donât understand

I know
It demands an effort
And the pills to get rid of this pain
Not a chance
Iâm sorry, Birdy
Iâm your favourite voice inside your head

Hey you,
Rise and shine!
You must learn to stand your ground
How long can you hold your breath under the pillow?
You kept yourself to yourself
Day by day
Growing delusions in the blue flowerpots

Your filter bubble
On the touchscreen display
Has recommended to you
What you should want

While youâve been watching too much daytime TV
Dreaming on demand
Your âfrom tomorrowâ just became âyesterdayâ
Made you crawl again
Under the bed covers

Hey you,
Rise and shine!
You must learn to stand your ground
How long can you hold your breath under the pillow?
How long can you hold your breath under the pillow?
How long can you hold your breath under the pillow?
