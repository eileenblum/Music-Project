a murder of crows descends once more and
strip the bones of sinners and god-men alike
cleansed and swallowed I'm only dreaming Norway
the lowly owls look of silence
whats going wrong hold the light out
whats going wrong wrong wrong
we are the only
bring on the fear
enshrouded nightfall
with lonely fear
biting cold
no time for lonely thoughts
a murder of crows descends once more and
strip the bones of sinners and god-men alike for the final time
whats going wrong wrong wrong
biting cold air and animal intent
breathe your last
free at last
breathe your last
free the past
breathe your last
free at last
breathe your last
feel the past
all the doors are open but all the angles wrong
all the stars are right now but
all the angles wrong
all the angles wrong
