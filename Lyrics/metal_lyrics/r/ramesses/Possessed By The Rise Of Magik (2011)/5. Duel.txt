blood spills fourth in coppers rivers
smoke filled tombs and icy shivers
end time certain give in to grieving
understand this is believing
lie awake in tombless sleep
decrepit ghouls that stalk and creep
while witches brew prepared for two
crescentian moon glow buried deep
blackened rainbow feel this knowledge
nameless mortal foe unwound
blackened rainbow
blackened rainbow
blackened rainbow
before my eyes a spectral
holy light and pierced by grief
don't ever look
it never lived
initiation into nothingness
blood spills fourth in coppers rivers
smoke filled tombs and icy shivers
end time certain give in to grieving
while witches brew prepared for two
crescentian moon glow buried deep
buried deep
beneath the blackest rainbow
beneath the blackest rainbow
beneath the blackest rainbow
beneath the blackest rainbow
behold the wooden horror foretold
coffin and crucifix
soul bound beneath the blackest of rainbows
