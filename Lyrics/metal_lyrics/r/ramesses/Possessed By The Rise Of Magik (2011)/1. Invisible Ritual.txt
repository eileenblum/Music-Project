blinding ice
holding fort
lanterned night..
knowing force
laughter funereal
laughing eyes
severing ties
holding out for my time
holding me inside
cosmic landslide
with tones like this
ritual
fire
unholy force
blinded eyes
sight for none
sight for zos
ode to none for my time
holding me inside
convulsing inside
with tones like this
I'm only dreaming of the end.
