we stand before you and the gods and old ones
towering in shimmering light
echoes of mans predecessors
amongst deep unpennetrable forest and pillars of black stone
burning forever eyes of the night the ram with a thousand young draws near
into dwindling sight atop the low mountains the storm breaks and floods and blinds the eye
the seven standing stones cast their shadows of inevitability
and the plague beak wearer stalks the shadows of mankind
obsidian omnipotent immortal drawn in the shadows of our past
