I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling
we always fall
were armed with hexes
a life less real
tumble down wasted
wasted
I'm falling down
no no I walk alone
hear no more laughter
I'm falling down down
I'm falling down
I'm here now deal
my card is marked
raw deal war life funereal
bet down to death..
now deal
face down
your card...
I'm falling down
no no down down
I'm falling down
I'm hear now deal
my card is marked for you
I'm hear now deal
your card is marked
a deadly thirst crumbles in my veins
and blueing underneath and buried in your grave
beneath the rusty nails and to the worms beneath
endless burial deception
endless burial
beyond belief
beyond belief
burial
through the soil and the rotten wood and to the mantle core
through and through beyond and down into the end
the end
the end
until the end
until the end
until the end
until the end
the bitter end
until the end
this bitter end
this bitter end
the end
the end
possessed by the rise of magik
