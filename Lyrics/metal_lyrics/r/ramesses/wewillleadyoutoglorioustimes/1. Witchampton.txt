Only life perished smiles
Magnificence drowning miles
Holy life hollow bones
Sightless eyes overthrown, overthrown
Only life perished smiles
Magnificence drowning miles
Holy life hollow bones
Sightless eyes to see
No throne overthrown
Perished life over throne
Buried life endless strife
Though it never can decide the lie
Holy love go in low
Holy life hollow bones
Sightless eyes overthrown
King without a throne
King without a throne
Blackened heart crystal skull
Culled messiah only where?
Devil mind Devil mind
Tide cast in time
This time
Two drops for eternity...
But don't turn back
We won't turn back
There's no way back
