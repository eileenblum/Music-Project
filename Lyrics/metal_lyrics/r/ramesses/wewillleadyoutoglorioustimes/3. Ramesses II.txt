Lowly earth unto consume
Coldest winter aeon tomb
Aptitude awakening
Mysanthropic alchemy
Curse the eye repeatedly

Woe frown here I am
Slow dance where I stand
Bloodied oceans righteous blood
Incantate me I am god

Fight the stand beyond life
Arise the ashes
Liar messiah
Doomicide you decide

Lowly earth unto consume
Coldest winter aeon tomb
Aptitude awakening
Mysanthropic alchemy
Thorrs the eye repeatedly
