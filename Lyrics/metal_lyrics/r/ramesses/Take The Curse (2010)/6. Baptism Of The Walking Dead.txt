All Rise to The Sabbath
Into The Circle
Low Key

Baptised at The Sabbath
Walk Blind
Low Key

Into The Circle
Drawn Swords
And spell The Pentagram
with strokes of Five

All Rise to The Sabbath
Into The Circle
Low Key

Baptised at The Sabbath
Walk Blind
Low Key

Lay on your back Blinded by Sun
Blackened as before
All your work undone
Cascading through these Fields of Death
Burning your Mind
Burning your Mind

Spitting Coffin Nails
The Deadening End
Always Knowing the Task
Lifeless Timeless
Glory and Light

Crushed by Fate
Born too Late
And now The Blood
