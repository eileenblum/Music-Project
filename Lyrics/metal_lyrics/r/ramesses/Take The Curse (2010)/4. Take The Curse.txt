Look The Witch in The Eyes or You'll never know
There's a banging at my door now Feel the Terror grow
Look The Wolf in The Eyes because You've always known
There's a taste of Blood in here now Take The Curse I've sown

Now Bring the Fire to me
And live The Prophecy
Proceed with No Will
Bring The Fire

We've got a name for you
Mark Your Grave

Look The Witch in The Eyes or You'll never know
There's a banging at my door now Feel the Horror Show
Look The Wolf in The Eyes because You've always known
There's a taste of Blood in here now Take The Curse I've sown

Now Bring the Fire to me
And live The Prophecy
Now Bring the Fire to me
Smash The Chalice

Now Bring the Fire to me
We've got a name for you

I - I am Pure Nothing but Truth
Transfusing of Blood and Mind
The Ritual began a lifetime ago
Engulf me in Oceans of Crimson
Unleash The Daggers of Hate
Draw blades and Instigate to
Some one to love
Some soul to Sacrifice
Open your Heart
