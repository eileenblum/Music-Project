Open Wide
Slow Sun Down
All the time
Made to Fail
The only Tie
Eternal Winter
Fading Light
Makes things Bitter
Now together
Be Together
The Beautiful End is sight
To a Land that Time Forgot
In your Hands
Then Feel the Power
Sucking your strength
Feel your Grave
Your Grave

Before Shades of Doom
Blood before Water
Now Fire Forgotten
Then Witness
The Winter
