Stand Back Behold
Look back take hold
Listen to the visions in Your Mind
Liars All Behind

Cries Overthrown
Half alive Iron Crow
Low
I'm Alive Down so Low
Iron Crow
Hold me Down and fly so High
Down So Low
Iron Crow

Stand Back Behold
Look back take hold
Listen to the visions in Your Mind
Liars All Behind

Cries Overthrown
Half alive Iron Crow
I, I'm Alive Down so Low
Iron Crow
Hold me Down and fly so High
Down So Low
Iron Crow

Darkness try as you might
Take me Down
Heavy times
Feel the Fire
Sit Down Fools
Fools

Low the Might
Low Rivers Tonight
Black Hole
Nova Ways
Making Waves
Those Blackened Wings Alive Now

No Life
Now rise again
Known unto another Light
