Killers Grim set on Fire and Magic
Smashed Black Hash at Funeral Masses
Engulfed in Petrified Stone
Wide gashes flow deep
Ravine-bound waters so cold near Freezing
Crows my last supposed sanity
I spy through hard dead thoughts
belied by self and Buried like before
Presumed on Fire for the last time Forevermore
Now Die Happy

Lie Low Head held High
Eyes Down Grim Lies
More time buried by More Loss
Lay Down Burnt Cross

I've taken the time to know The Deadening End is
Real and Here and Now
like Poison Arrows

Staggering through my Mind eclipsed by All Mankind
Seeping Through my very Being
I'm Loosing mi will to Live Again
What's this

Creeping Terror
Shackled in your Reality
Grim Vibes Embroiled in Twisted Love
Devotion running Blind
