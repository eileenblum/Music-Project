Smashed and Bloody encircled in flame
Swirling dark wings
Black Hash Mass

I'm Falling down and My Eyes did Bleed
I saw The Beast
Your turn to believe

I was Born a Wolf or was it a Witch
I can Touch The Sky
or Learn to fly
I was alive at a quarter to three
The Jackal laughs
and so do We
I will return in your Hour of Need
Clean Ritual Burn
Let The Ancients Bleed
