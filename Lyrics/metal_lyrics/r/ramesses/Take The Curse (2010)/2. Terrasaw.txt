Every time I check you seem alive
Vital signs are up We still have time
I taste your Fear that Grows
But they will never know
Don't Look Now I think I may have Lied

Nobody know this
Just You Me and Death
Keep you till twilight
til Your Last Breath

Sick to The Soul

Every time I check you seem alive
Vital signs are up We still have time
I taste your Fear that Grows
But they will never know
Don't Look Now I think I may have Lied

Nobody know this
Just You Me and Death
Keep you till twilight
til My Last Breath

Didn't know
Didn't know

Tried Before
Tired of Life
Killers Thoughts on Haunted Nights

If Id had known
You were lies
Tunnel Vision always right so right

When You
Awake free of Life
Tied Below exit light
