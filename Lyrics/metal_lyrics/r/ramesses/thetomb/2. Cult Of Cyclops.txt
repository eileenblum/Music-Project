Pain do they know cry out
Behind Why Deal blinded blind life
To Eternal Fires I own I own your kind

One eye for Tomorrow
Bred to Suffer
Darkest Shadows
Child of Woe
One Eye Open
Bred to Suffer
Cold Tomorrow

Pity you carry me through
Pity you carry me
Pity you carry me through

Hear the Void let me breathe
All I want and all my Sorrow
Poison Arrow
Born of Lie for all my life never
Golden Arrow

Hear the Void let me breathe
Boy of night all will know
All will know

Look on my Eye
The one behind
Frozen Arrow
Let me see
My eyes are blind
Poison Arrow

One Day one Deal for
Prison
Obey
Let me see
Overlord Poison Arrow
Lord of Naught

Pity you carry me through
Pity you carry me
Pity you carry me

Hear the Void let me breathe
Pull the line Poison Arrow
One eye down
Born to Suffer
Darkest Shadows
Poison Arrow
