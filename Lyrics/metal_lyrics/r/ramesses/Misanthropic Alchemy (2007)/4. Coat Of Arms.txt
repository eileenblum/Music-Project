From souls so lost and old
To shores awash with cold
And ice comes smashing down
With strokes of power
Shades of death
Encapsulate the moon

Once again bludgeoned minds
Contorted souls give way
Landslide thoughts of old
Where god begun
From souls so lost and old
To shores awash with cold
And ice comes smashing down
With strokes of power and
Shades of death
Encapsulate mother hate

Torn from the grave
Coat of arms tonight
Glimpsed through shattered eyes
Souls lost and old
