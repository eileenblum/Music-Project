Sold out, hung out to dry
Sold out, lead out to die
Sold out, hung out to dry
Sold out, bled out too dry

Holding on to die
Holding on to die
Holding on to die
Holding on to die
Plead with me to die

Sold out, hung out to dry
Sold out, lead out to die
Sold out, hung out to dry
Sold out, hung out to dry

Every way you loose, everywhere is hate, everyone is dead
All of this is real, every way you loose, everyone is dead
Everywhere is hate, everywhere you look, everything you do
All of this is real, all of this is real
Everyone is dead, dead, dead, dead
