Don't want to feel
Don't want to feel
Don't want to feel
Don't want to feel
Don't want to feel
Behold the seal
Wading through chaos
Eternal screams
Echoing mountain
Land of doom
Trail of the damned
Doomed to death of
Deadly night

There's a place where we all know
With blackened treetops full of crows
The plough of loathing splits the earth
Lay down, accept this ghastly curse

There's a place where we all know
With blackened treetops full of crows
The plough of loathing splits the earth
Lay down, accept this ghastly curse

Distress then inside me
My cold be only
Dying behind cold 
Rip the seal
Behind the seal
My doom
Chaos I own
Eternal we sleep
Echo mountain
The death knell, the blue sky
Heaven denied
The devil afraid to leave me
I own all of your blood
Trail of the damned
Walk with me, hand in hand
