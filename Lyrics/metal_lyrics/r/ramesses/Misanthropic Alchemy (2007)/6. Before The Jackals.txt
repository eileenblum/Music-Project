Do what you want, on borrowed time
Night after night, with murder in mind
Follow the wall beside your hovel
Pill after pill, bitter swallow
We all know
We all know
We all know
Take what you want, but warnings sound
Night after night, with murder in mind
Look now, the jackals feed
False alarms, signs of life
We all know
We all know
We all know
We all know
Do what you want, on borrowed time
Night after night, with murder in mind
Look now, the jackals feed
Beg or follow, let me breathe
Through the tomb
Damn me with unknown
Through the gloom
To the bright side
Mine mind, burnt out
Live wire
Mine mind, lights out
Time right
Lights out, lights out, lights out, lights out
