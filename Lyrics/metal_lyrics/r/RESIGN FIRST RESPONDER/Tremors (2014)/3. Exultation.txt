The search for forever
Life begins at the end of your comfort zone
Experience is what happens when you don't get what you want
Believing in each others light, in each others dreams
I'm feeling way too alive
It exhumes from every pore and shimmers in every nerve.
Why can't you feel the same way?

I love this world, but it is so unkind
So unforgiving, be the beacon, true honesty
They may not like what they see, but at least it's not hidden
Minding your presence but my shadow is dying in your radiance
Like the sun, block, shade
Like the sun, block, shade
I love this world, but it is so unkind
So unforgiving, be the beacon, true love
