After all the cattle have been bled
The wines been cheered to the dead
Made from the bloodshed
The cattle have been bled
The wines been cheered to the dead
Made from the bloodshed
Through treacherous lies

I've seen the skies change from grey to white
To see the end of this fight, it's taken all of my might
And it's taken over my mind
But now I can finally see what this world means to me
What makes it real and what makes you feel valuable - because you're cherished by those unexpected and unseen
To see the end of this fight, it's taken all of my might
It's taken over my mind but now I can finally see
What this world means to me

What makes it real, and what makes you feel alive?
Alive - for once in your life - alive

And these paths unseen are usually the paths most often tread
But not in this case, no, not with us
We were told of our fate, but we fought
For what we wanted to be right, but was so wrong
It was oh so wrong, it was so wrong
The underlying factor will remain the same

I've seen the skies change from grey to white
To see the end of this fight, it's taken all of my might
To prove it to you and push it right through is all I really need
To prove it to you and push it right through is all I really need

Know it was wrong of you to think so clear
So clear I was transparent
Know it was wrong of you to think so clear
So clear I was transparent
So clear, I, your brother
Your brother, transparent
Your brother, transparent
So clear, I, your brother
Your brother, transparent
