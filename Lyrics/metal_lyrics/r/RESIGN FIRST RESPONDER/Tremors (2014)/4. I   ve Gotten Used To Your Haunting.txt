Conjure up a fictitious decision and choose blindly
This is the only chance you'll get (the only chance you'll get)
True love is the willingness to...

Risk everything you have or everything you want
Deciding what you'll risk will define your existence
A turning of tides is all that's needed to tear you apart
Oh brave coward - dive in, dive in, dive in.
Dive in! Dive in! Dive in...

So hoist your sail, almighty one, and face the storm head on
At least you'll drown with closure

A solid rock against a wild ocean
A solid rock against a wild ocean
A solid rock against a wild ocean
A solid rock against a wild ocean

Rise from the dead, oh heavy hearted, your life starts now
Rise from the dead, oh heavy hearted, your life starts now
Rise from the dead, oh heavy hearted, your life starts now

Oh how distance can dissolve and shift your focus
Oh how distance can dissolve and shift your focus
Oh how distance can dissolve and shift your focus
Oh how distance can dissolve and shift your focus

I just know I can't have it both ways and I'll never be satisfied
Look into these eyes
Look into these eyes
Classified by those who really have no say
It breaks me down
It breaks me down and shines right through
I just know I can't have it both ways and I'll never be satisfied
