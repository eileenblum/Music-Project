Red light
You murdered me for curiosity
This king has no clothes
Reach out to me so I can be set free
Help me believe in honesty
I am aware of the tremors in this path in which were bound to stumble

Circumstantial equality
Unorthodox ambiguity

But I have not forgot to personify forgiveness and passion
A metamorphosis my darling

Like a butterfly in chrysalis
Like a butterfly, chrysalis
Like a butterfly in chrysalis
Like a butterfly, chrysalis
We're becoming our future selves
Shower all I hear in your love
Shower all I hear in your love
Shower all I hear in your love

I will shower all that I hear in your love for you are my beacon

One truth, the only reason
Let kindness honesty and passion resonate from you
One truth, the only reason
Let kindness honesty and passion resonate from you

Like a butterfly you can be complete
Like a butterfly you can be set free
Like a butterfly you can be set free
Like a butterfly you can be complete
Like a butterfly you can be complete

And I will not pry
Be the one to push you around
As you pry away
I will be the one who sets you free
