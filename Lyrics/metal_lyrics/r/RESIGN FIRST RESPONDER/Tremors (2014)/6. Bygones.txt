A frailty, a fracture
The final line between you and I
The way your eyes and gentle gestures have graced my life
Has only opened me up into
A cycle of inconsistencies
Used to the cold
Numbness, my home
Our numbness, my home

As I watch her climb to boundless self-endearment, I can only cry
What if, all is for not, and when we go our separate ways you leave with more pride than I, more confidence than before?
And I'm left wondering if enhancing your self-worth was a fault

Tempt not a desperate man
As this feral sickness succumbs with every passing gesture of belief

I cannot help myself
Stumble myself into disbelief and concoctions of the hostile kind in my mind
Losing hope in genuineness
Ripples firmly through every aspect of reason
Every aspect of reason, it's wrong I know

But can we see beneath the surface, personal agendas, coordinate our lives
Personal agendas coordinate our lives
Personal, personal, personal, personal agenda
Personal, personal, personal - personal!

And ultimately drive you
Drive you deeper into the black
A realist surrealist
A malice-fuelled malcontent
Your overwhelming aphid similarities
Self-known pariah
Manage your expectations
A realist surrealist
A malice-fuelled malcontent
Your overwhelming aphid similarities
A realist surrealist
A malice-fuelled malcontent
Your overwhelming aphid similarities
Socially accepted, self-known pariah
Manage your, manage your expectations
Manage your...
